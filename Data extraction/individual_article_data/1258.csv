0,Introduction and background,"Organic aerosol (OA) constitutes a large fraction of the overall aerosol budget, with planet- and human-scale outcomes a consequence of this ubiquity. Aerosol particles scatter light [Tang, 1996], change the earth's albedo [Lohmann and Feichter, 2005], and serve as cloud condensation nuclei, all of which have ramifications for the climate [Charlson et al., 1992]. These particles have also been implicated in the exacerbation of negative human health outcomes [Dockery and Pope, 1994; Dockery et al., 1992]. The size and chemical composition of aerosol particles are important drivers for each of these effects, which in turn are determined by the nature of the aqueous environment of a particle. This aqueous environment, and ultimately the physical properties of an aerosol, are influenced by interactions with both directly emitted and secondarily produced chemicals—from anthropogenic and biogenic sources [Rothfuss and Petters, 2017]. The uptake and aerosol-phase reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) impact the production, growth, and chemical complexity of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) [de Gouw and Jimenez, 2009; Poschl, 2005; Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012]. Examples of this process and its consequences abound. Atmospheric- and particulate-phase pollutants in a smog event in the Los Angeles basin have been traced from primary anthropogenic source emissions to SOA chemical load [Schauer et al., 2002]. Films composed of organic acids and alcohols with anthropogenic (large population centers) and biogenic (sea spray) sources have been shown to prolong the lifetimes of aqueous aerosols [Gill et al., 1983]. Pollution from large biomass burning events in Amazonia has been shown to interact with VOCs, soil dust, and more than a dozen elemental metals [Rizzo et al., 2010] to produce aerosol particles that reduced total surface solar radiation by more than 30% [Oliveira et al., 2007]. These examples highlight the importance of elucidating the direct role atmospherically relevant chemicals play in SOA production chemistry and SOA physical properties, with the eventual target of linking individual classes of VOCs to downstream effects—both climatic and human health. SOA production chemistry typically happens through two broad types of reactions. Photooxidative processes convert primary VOCs, such as isoprene, to alcohols, peroxides, and carbonyl compounds. Once these secondary compounds partition to the aerosol phase, they can cyclize, undergo dehydration reactions, and/or form larger oligomers [Carlton et al., 2009; Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012]. Non-oxidative processes, on the other hand, involve ‘dark’ reactions that build higher molecular weight compounds and oligomers from, for example, amine and small dicabonyl building blocks [Galloway et al., 2009; Galloway et al., 2011; Maxut et al., 2015; Noziere et al., 2009; Sedehi et al., 2013; Shapiro et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011]. Chemical reactions between two such starting materials found abundantly in OA, glyoxal and ammonium sulfate, produce SOA with physical and chemical properties that contribute to the aforementioned atmospheric effects [Trainic et al., 2011], and this chemistry is the focus of the work presented here. Glyoxal has an estimated global budget in the teragram range [Fu et al., 2008], with predominant sourcing from the oxidation of small primary VOCs. Subsequent partitioning to the aerosol phase represents a significant atmospheric loss pathway for glyoxal [Ervens et al., 2011; Volkamer et al., 2007], and this aerosol availability is a reason for the broad interest in studying non-oxidative, glyoxal-based SOA chemistry. Prior research on non-photooxidative systems highlights the complexity of glyoxal and ammonium sulfate reactions, while also offering details about SOA production chemistry. For example, UV–Vis studies of the reaction between glyoxal and ammonium sulfate find prominent absorption features that arise on a variety of time scales [Lee et al., 2013; Maxut et al., 2015; Shapiro et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011]. Mechanistic studies show that these light-absorbing species include imidazoles [Drozd and McNeill, 2014; Kampf et al., 2012; Maxut et al., 2015; Teich et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2011] and offer tantalizing clues to the diversity of larger, longer-time evolution products [Liggio et al., 2005; Noziere et al., 2009; Powelson et al., 2014; Shapiro et al., 2009]. Based on these prior studies, a schematic of the reactions in the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate system under study here is shown in Fig. 1 , for the production of imidazole (IM), imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC), and biimidazole (BI). Under non-photooxidative conditions, SOA-forming reactions involving glyoxal produce either acetals and glyoxal self-oligomers or a sequential series of heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing compounds. The present work focuses on the latter pathway, exploiting the strong absorption bands of imidazole and its derivatives in the near-UV to follow product formation. A number of studies have sought to extend this bulk-phase glyoxal and ammonium sulfate ‘model system’ to more atmospherically relevant conditions. These largely fall into two groups: changing the amine [De Haan et al., 2009a; De Haan et al., 2009c; Powelson et al., 2014; Sedehi et al., 2013] or dicarbonyl [De Haan et al., 2009b; De Haan et al., 2011; Sareen et al., 2010; Sedehi et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2010] or changing the bulk aqueous environment, and thus the composition of the solvent in which the reaction takes place. Examples of the latter include adjustments to solution pH and temperature [Sedehi et al., 2013] and ionic environment [Noziere et al., 2009]. More significant modifications to the solvent environment include using an organic matrix of sugars or sugar alcohols [Drozd and McNeill, 2014]. Little other work has been done thus far to study how amine and dicarbonyl reactions are influenced by the myriad VOCs accessible to particles as they age. Aerosol particles can have a diverse range of physical and chemical properties [Rothfuss and Petters, 2017], and making connections between specific VOCs, or classes of VOCs, will help to improve comparisons between aerosol sampling and modeling studies with laboratory-based research. To that end, we present here a bulk-phase study examining the effect of seven atmospherically relevant, short-chain alcohols—methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol—on the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate model system. Specifically, the goal is to understand the effects of a more complex, though well-defined, solvent environment on the reactivity of these SOA-mimicking solutions. The seven alcohols are all found as VOCs from a diversity of sources, and thus understanding how each alcohol affects SOA-forming reactions offers the potential to tailor aerosol growth models to account for source characteristics and proximity. Anthropogenically sourced alcohols include fuel additives methanol, ethanol, and tert-butanol [Grosjean et al., 1998; Pereira et al., 1999; Seinfeld et al., 1994], rubber de-vulcanization agent 1-propanol [Azad and Andino, 1999], industrial solvent 2-butanol [Ballesteros et al., 2007], and 2-propanol, a solvent in household cleaning agents and detergents [Hippelein, 2004]. 3-Methyl-2-butanol is one of more than eighty VOCs shown to originate from microorganisms living on building materials [Claeson et al., 2002]. In addition, birch trees and blossoming rye have been shown to emit 2-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol, respectively [König et al., 1995]. A collection of relevant physical properties for these seven alcohols can be found in Table 1 . To the best of our knowledge, atmospheric concentration data for 2-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol are not known, though, as a group, the C1—C4 alcohols should be in the low ppb range [Donaldson and Anderson, 1999]. Whether from large industrial or narrowly localized emission sources, these alcohols have the potential to interact with particulate matter in the atmosphere. The laboratory-based experiments here seek to elucidate details about reactivity and product formation and they will help enhance the complexity of modeling studies, in addition to aiding the interpretation of results from future laboratory studies [Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Glyoxal (Sigma Aldrich, 40% by weight in H2O), ammonium sulfate (Sigma Aldrich, 99.0%), methanol (Pharmco-Aaper, 99.8%), ethanol (Pharmco-Aaper, 99.5%), 1-propanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%), 2-propanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%), 2-butanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%), and 3-methyl-2-butanol (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) were used without further purification. At ambient laboratory temperature (20–22 °C), tert-butanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) was a solid, and was re-liquefied in a warm water (∼25–30 °C) bath for approximately 30 min before use. 2.1.1 Stock solution preparation Solutions used in all kinetics experiments contained 3.0 M ammonium sulfate and 0.095 M glyoxal in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ, Thermo Scientific Barnstead NANOpure). The glyoxal and ammonium sulfate concentrations were comparable to previous studies on similar systems [Noziere et al., 2009; Sedehi et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2011]. The solution of glyoxal and ammonium sulfate, but lacking an alcohol, will subsequently be referred to as the ‘stock’ solution. 2.1.2 Alcohol solution preparation Alcohol-containing solutions were prepared at five concentrations: 0.010 M, 0.10 M, 0.25 M, 0.50 M, and 1.0 M. The top end of this range was limited by the solubility of ammonium sulfate in aqueous alcohol. All solutions were made using an identical sequence of additions. Initially, ammonium sulfate was dissolved in approximately 15–20 mL of ultrapure water, to which alcohol was added. Then, glyoxal and more water were added to make 25.00 mL of mixture. All solutions were immediately warmed to 23 °C and held in a circulating water bath (Cole-Parmer Polystat). Time zero for all experiments was established by the addition of glyoxal."
3,UV–Vis spectral data collection,"2.2 UV–Vis spectral data collection UV–Vis spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 220 spectrometer, using 1.0 cm quartz cuvettes in a temperature-controlled (23 °C), 8-cell changer. The kinetics run for each alcohol consisted of a blank (ultrapure water), the ‘stock’ solution, solutions containing the five different alcohol concentrations, and a control solution of ammonium sulfate and 0.50 M alcohol, but no glyoxal. Cuvettes used in the spectrometer were capped to prevent evaporative losses. We expect that alcohol loss to the headspace (approximately 25% of the total volume) has not appreciably affected solution chemistry. Initial solution pH was found to be approximately 3.5 for all mixtures, and no adjustments were made to either the stock or the alcohol-containing solutions."
4,Reaction kinetics,"2.3 Reaction kinetics Descriptions of the reaction kinetics used can be found in more detail elsewhere [Noziere et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2018], and only a brief synopsis is given here. Absorbance values, A(λ), obtained via the UV–Vis spectrometer, are converted to extinction coefficients, ελ, via the Beer-Lambert law (1) A ( λ ) = ε λ l where l represents the optical path length for the samples, in this case 1.0 cm. Reactions identified as obeying first-order kinetics can be described using (2) ε λ ( t ) = ε ∞ ( 1 − exp ( − k I t ) ) while reactions obeying second-order kinetics can be described using (3) ε λ ( t ) = ε ∞ ( 1 − 1 / ( 1 + C ∞ k I I t ) ) where ε ∞ represents the absorbance at long reaction time, k I and k II are the first- and second-order rate constants, in units of s−1 and M−1s−1, respectively. C ∞ represents the long-time concentration of the product of interest and calculated by dividing ε ∞ by the absorption cross section of the product, at the wavelength of measurement (310 nm for IC data, 250 nm for BI data). This requires good absorption cross section data for the wavelengths of interest. Maxut and coworkers used crotonaldehyde data at 209 nm as a proxy for imidazole in their kinetics analysis [Maxut et al., 2015]. Because the IC data are taken far from the imidazole λ max , where we assume the crotonaldehyde data are less relevant, we use a combined pseudo rate constant parameter instead of C ∞ k I I in Equation (3), (4) ε λ ( t ) = ε ∞ ( 1 − 1 / ( 1 + k p s I I t ) ) where k p s I I = C ∞ k I I . To determine rate constants for the production imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde, we assumed a sequential process wherein imidazole is formed first and then reacts with glyoxal to form IC—consistent with the scheme as shown in Fig. 1. The rate equation used for the IC absorption data can thus be described as the sum of Equations (2) and (4) plus an offset term, (5) f ( t ) = O + ε ∞ I C ( 1 − exp ( − k I C I t ) ) + ε ∞ I M ( 1 − 1 1 + k I M I I t ) where O is the offset, ε ∞ I C , ε ∞ I M , k I C I , and k I M I I are the long-time absorption values and rate constants for IC and IM, respectively. As discussed below, Equation (5) fits the UV–Vis data more effectively than either Equation (2) or Equation (4) alone. The biimidazole (BI) channel, monitored at 250 nm, presents a more complicated kinetics picture. An equation similar to Equation (5), adding a term for BI, was not successful—the equation never produced fits to the data. Instead, we adopted a simple first-order description using a slightly modified version of Equation (2) to include an offset term (6) f ( t ) = O + ε ∞ B I ( 1 − exp ( − k B I I t ) ) where ε ∞ B I and k B I I are the long-time absorbance value and rate constant, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Imidazole production in absence of alcohols,"3.1 Imidazole production in absence of alcohols The UV–Vis absorption spectrum for the model system (stock solution), an example of which is shown in Fig. 2 , is appreciably similar to previously reported spectra for this system at comparable reactant concentrations [Lee et al., 2013; Noziere et al., 2009; Shapiro et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011]. An individual absorption spectrum was collected every 20 min, though to show the time evolution of product formation the figure only displays data taken every 90 min. Major absorption bands include imidazole (centered at 207 nm), imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC, centered at 284 nm), and biimidazole (BI, centered at 274 nm) [Maxut et al., 2015]. Note that the kinetics data reported here were recorded at different wavelengths, as detailed below. Additional, higher molecular weight compounds give rise to the minor features at longer wavelengths, such as the shoulder feature at ∼320 nm. The present study focuses specifically on the production of IC and BI, whose absorption features are shown in the figure inset."
7,Alcohol species- and concentration-dependent behavior,"3.2 Alcohol species- and concentration-dependent behavior Kinetics traces for each alcohol showing the absorption of IC or BI as a function of reaction time (the time since glyoxal addition) for the series of concentrations (0.010 M, 0.10 M, 0.25 M, 0.50 M, 1.0 M) are shown in Fig. 3 for ethanol and tert-butanol (the rest can be found in the Supplementary Information, SI, Fig. S1). In each pair, the top set of traces corresponds to the production of IC, monitored at 310 nm, and the bottom set to the production of BI, monitored at 250 nm. These wavelengths were selected based on work by Maxut and coworkers, in an attempt to isolate the behavior of each product channel [Maxut et al., 2015]. In addition, to visually account for the difference in extinction coefficient values for the two product channels, the BI data have been scaled by a factor of 0.595 (based on ε I C = 10205 M−1cm−1, ε B I = 17138 M−1cm−1, at the λ max for each [Maxut et al., 2015]) and plotted as concentration versus time. As shown in the schematic in Fig. 1, IC is likely formed before BI, with this sequential production an additional reason for the observed absorption differences. Based on the data in Fig. 3 and the SI (Fig. S1), it is clear that the alcohols exert an effect on the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate system. The spectra from the alcohol addition sequences do not look appreciably different from the stock solution spectra in Fig. 2 other than an increase in absorption across all product channels, indicating, in most cases, the alcohols are affecting product formation. Example spectra for the solution containing 1.0 M ethanol are shown in Fig. 4 . No new peaks arise, no previously observed peaks disappear, and the peak envelope does not change shape, other than due to increased product formation. This suggests that the alcohols do not behave as reactants in the production of the observed imidazoles. The behavior of the system in the presence of an alcohol also varies based on the concentration of that alcohol in solution. As alcohol concentration in solution increases, there is a general increase in the production of IC and BI, as given by increased absorption in both product channels (see, in particular, the ethanol data in Fig. 3 as well as Fig. 6 below). More than the mere presence of an alcohol in solution, however, the observed effects also depend on the identity of alcohol species added. Another example of species and concentration-dependent activity can be found in the early time anomalies found in the spectra of 2-propanol and 2-butanol solutions (both 0.50 and 1.0 M; see the SI). This behavior is repeatable, disappears by around 5 h of monitoring, and exists even in solutions containing no glyoxal, and thus does not appear to be a feature of the reactive system. It is instead indicative of changes to the solvent environment, through which reactivity is eventually altered. The behavior of the reactive system in the presence of the different alcohols highlights the importance in understanding the molecular-scale changes to the solvent environment imposed by the alcohol. We can begin to assess these changes by shifting from an intra-alcohol to an inter-alcohol perspective. As alcohol concentration increases, three groups become apparent: there is a ‘more productive’ group containing 2-propanol, 2-butanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, and ethanol; a ‘less productive’ group containing 1-propanol and tert-butanol; and finally, methanol, which behaves unlike the other six. This differentiation is also illustrated in the dynamic range of the responses to alcohol addition—going from, for example, a low concentration of 0.10 M to a high concentration of 1.0 M. The stronger the perturbation imposed on the reactive system by the addition of an alcohol, the larger the difference in product absorption (of IC or BI) after 48 h of reaction time. In both product channels, ethanol and the secondary alcohols exhibit the largest dynamic range. Methanol, on the other hand, produces little effect regardless of concentration. There is no immediately obvious pattern to these groupings other than the secondary alcohols are the most reactive, suggesting the underlying mechanism of action is more complicated than simple structural or physical property considerations might initially imply. For example, methanol has the highest (pure substance) dielectric constant while 3-methyl-2-butanol has the lowest, and if changes in overall solvent polarity were driving reactivity differences these two alcohols would produce effects opposite of those observed. This may indicate that bulk properties, such as dielectric constant, are not useful proxies for the molecular-scale effects of the alcohols on the solvent environment in these SOA-mimicking solutions, a conclusion also reached in other studies involving alcohols [Onori and Santucci, 1996]. A further exploration of the reactivity differences in the presence of the seven alcohols, by looking at relative long-time absorption (the ratio of the long-time absorption of an alcohol-containing solution to the long-time absorption of the stock solution) versus alcohol concentration for both product channels, is shown in Fig. 5 . While the data show the general trends discussed above, intriguing deviations become evident. There are several instances where a local maximum in IC or BI production (as given by the value of the long-time absorption) exists. These two regimes are most frequently found centered on approximately 0.10 M, including for methanol, tert-butanol, and 1-propanol, particularly in the BI channel, between 0.10 M and 0.25 M. This behavior suggests the mode of action of the alcohols on the system depends on the concentration in a non-monotonic way (see Section 3.5 below for further discussion of possible alcohol modes of action)."
8,Rate constants for alcohol containing solutions,"3.3 Rate constants for alcohol containing solutions In addition to qualitative descriptions of the effect of alcohol addition on SOA chemistry, rate constants extracted from fits to Fig. 3 traces using Equation (5) (for IC) and (6) (for BI) are presented in Tables 2 and 3 for IC and BI, respectively. A comparison of the ‘stock’ solution rate constants for both channels to prior studies of the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate system suggests an un-settled picture of the reaction kinetics. Previously published rate constants for the formation of IC from IM and glyoxal include (2.01 ± 0.40) x 10−12 M−2s−1 [Yu et al., 2011] and (2.5 ± 1.5) x 10−7 s−1 [Maxut et al., 2015], while for the production of BI the range includes from (0.074 ± 0.002) x 10−9 M−1s−1 to (7.19 ± 0.44) x 10−9 M−1s−1 depending on starting glyoxal concentration [Kampf et al., 2012] and (6.3 ± 3.6) x 10−7 s−1 [Maxut et al., 2015]. The average values reported here of (4.03 ± 2.02) x 10−6 s−1 for IC production and (3.48 ± 1.75) x 10−6 s−1 for BI production—assuming a similar error to Maxut and coworkers (the deviations given by the fitting routine are approximately 10%, though this likely underestimates the actual standard deviation)—are, given the error bars, approximately within an order of magnitude of the first-order constants from Maxut. Though our fitting method is different from theirs (as are some reaction conditions), we both retrieve similar kinetics information on the system. Illustrative fits to both IC and BI traces, for solutions containing ethanol and tert-butanol, can be seen in Fig. 6. Additional information on the quality of the fitting routines for both IC and BI traces can be found in section 1.2 of the SI. As with the qualitative discussion above, when alcohol is added, clear species- and concentration-dependent trends become apparent in the rate constant data for both the IC and BI channels. For the IC channel specifically, the alcohol data break into two groups, one containing methanol, ethanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol with minimal, or no, concentration dependence, and one with the other four alcohols (1-propanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol) with more significant dependence on alcohol concentration. There are no immediately obvious structural similarities between the concentration dependent and non-concentration dependent groups."
9,Mechanistic insights from kinetic data,"3.4 Mechanistic insights from kinetic data In assessing the kinetics data presented here, an important distinction must be made between the reaction rate (as given by the rate constant) and rate of product formation (as given by the changes in the observed absorption values over time). tert-Butanol offers an instructive example of how to use rate constant and product formation data to extract clues to any underlying mechanism(s) of action. From Table 2, it can be seen that tert-butanol has relatively large rate constants across the concentration range, ending with the largest obtained value of 6.61 × 10−6 s−1. Figs. 3 and 5, however, reveal limited production of IC (and BI) over the 48 h of the experiment, at least compared to high-producers such as 2-propanol (see Fig. S1) and ethanol. These results suggest that the addition of tert-butanol to solution induces the rapid production of IC (and BI), with that production reaching a steady state. Biimidazole production is not concomitantly enhanced nor is the shape of the absorption spectrum appreciably changed, indicating IC is reacting to form some combination of larger compounds that absorb poorly, small quantities of other imidazoles, and/or products along pathways to which we are blind. Besides tert-butanol, the data for several other alcohols offer possible mechanistic insights. For the alcohols with rate constant trends that are flat or only slightly increasing—particularly ethanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol—but lead to appreciable IC production, it is possible that the alcohols interact with the water/sulfate matrix to sequester the reactants and products, concentrating them in a smaller volume of available water. This would result in a larger rate of production, independent of the rate constant. Though the fits to the BI traces have fewer easy-to-identify trends than the IC data in general, every alcohol exhibits a lower rate constant at 1.0 M than at 0.50 M, suggesting that additional alcohol impedes BI production in some as-yet-unexplained way. Finally, similar to the IC data, the addition of tert-butanol appears to result in steady-state behavior for the production of BI, albeit at a lower concentration than for IC."
10,The effect of the solvent on imidazole production,"3.5 The effect of the solvent on imidazole production Alcohols are known to affect the structure of water, imposing a localized patterning, or organization, that changes the solvation environment, and this behavior offers a possible explanation for the mechanism of reactivity enhancement in the presence of alcohol-containing solvents. While reactions in aqueous solutions are influenced by the surrounding solvent and its interactions, through solvation, with reactants, products, and transition states [Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012], the solvation shell composition in mixtures containing alcohol and water can differ appreciably from a water-only solvent [Reichardt, 2007]. A diverse body of non-SOA studies have observed these solvent-organizing traits, suggesting this is robust behavior across alcohol/water systems [Alavi et al., 2010; Onori and Santucci, 1996]. In these systems, the alcohol modifies the solvent by inducing the formation of aggregates, with the type of aggregate based on alcohol concentration. At low concentrations, ‘cages’ with a single alcohol molecule surrounded by water are formed, while at high concentrations solvated clusters of alcohol aggregates form. The micro-heterogeneities of solvated alcohol molecules at low alcohol fraction add localized organization to the solvent not present in bulk water and are responsible for clathrate-like structures that result in a diminution of ‘excess’ molar volume that affects adiabatic compressibility, changes to dielectric relaxation times versus bulk water, and changes to the formation of micellar aggregates through modification of the solvation around the isolated chains [Onori and Santucci, 1996]. Together, these observations account for the behavior of alcohols with rate constants that do not appear to depend on concentration, the poor explicative power of the bulk dielectric constant, and the non-monotonic behavior found for some of the alcohols. The alcohol concentration in solution that corresponds to the changeover point between two markedly different solvent/solute relationships—single alcohol solvation and aggregate formation—is the critical fraction. This demarcation decreases as a function of increasing tail hydrophobicity, ranging from 0.11 for methanol down to 0.025 for tert-butanol [Onori and Santucci, 1996]. The values of these fractions for binary alcohol/water solutions are close to the concentration ranges for the work presented here, which give alcohol fractions of up to about 0.016 for methanol and up to about 0.017 for tert-butanol. Onori and Santucci find the transition from water-alcohol interaction to an environment with the possibility of alcohol-alcohol interactions to be smooth under most of their experimental conditions, and we may be seeing the onset of the transition from below to above a similar critical fraction in the data in Fig. 5, as demonstrated by the presence of two different reactivity regimes. The smaller critical fractions here may be due to the significant differences in solution composition between the two studies—binary mixtures versus an ammonium sulfate/water/alcohol solvent surrounding a complicated chemical reaction. Other chemical species relevant to our solutions can induce patterning in water and may also influence SOA-forming reactions. The sulfate dianion itself can exert influence over water molecules out to 3 solvation shells. This strongly affects spatial patterning, though not necessarily the characteristics and number of hydrogen bonds in the new water network [O'Brien et al., 2010]. Because our SOA-mimicking solutions contain substantial amounts of sulfate, the alcohols offer another water-organizing component to solution that can increase the total number of water molecules tied up in micro-heterogeneities or compete with sulfate for hydration by water [Feng et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2010]. At high alcohol concentrations, above approximately 1 M, we find significant ‘salting out’ of ammonium sulfate. In this high concentration regime, it seems likely that the alcohol out-competes sulfate to interact with water, while at low alcohol concentrations the complex solvent matrix likely contains both types of interactions. While the ternary water-salt-alcohol matrix is complex in its own right, it is also important to consider the effect of this environment on the imidazoles, because the time evolution of their production indicates that they have the potential for extended hydrogen bonding interactions with the solvent. Organic chemistry literature on reactive systems involving both alcohols and imidazoles suggests that alcohols do influence the solvation environment surrounding imidazole (and its derivatives), and can both increase (via imidazole activation) or decrease (by blocking access to a reaction site) reactivity. Proton transfer reactions involving protonated imidazoles are enhanced in the presence of solvent mixtures of water and tert-butanol; the deprotonation is facilitated by the stabilization of bulk water by the alcohol [Ralph and Grunwald, 1969]. Imidazole-catalyzed nitroaldol reactions can proceed more quickly in mixed alcohol-water solvents than in water alone, because under these more heterogeneous conditions the reaction species are each surrounded by the most preferable component of the solvent [Phukan et al., 2008]. In a nucleophilic reaction involving imidazole, reaction rates in a 96% ethanol solvent were an order of magnitude lower than in a more dilute alcohol-water solvent. This difference was attributed to ethanol being better than water at solvating reactants, but worse at solvating the transition state—with water playing a more significant role in the mixed solution [Al-Terairy et al., 2008]. In contrast, while methanol exhibits strong hydrogen bonding interactions with water [Shin et al., 2013], adding more to the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate system under study here seems to make little difference on reactivity. Experimental work involving imidazoles in solvents containing methanol offers a possible explanation. Acetonitrile promotes reactivity more than methanol in systems involving imidazoles because the alcohol preferentially solvates the heterocycle, resulting in an increase in its activation energy [Yoh et al., 2000]. Another study, in chloroform, finds methanol preferentially solvating imidazole, relative to water, due to a stronger acceptance of the N—H hydrogen by methanol [Spencer et al., 1982]. As seen in the kinetic traces in Fig. 5 (and Fig. S1), solutions containing methanol exhibit what appears to be an inverse concentration dependence, where higher concentrations of methanol lead to less reactivity than at the lowest alcohol concentrations. Deactivation of imidazole to further reactivity in the presence of increased methanol is a possible explanation. Though the picture of alcohol interactions with imidazoles appears complicated, the increased production of IC and BI as alcohol fraction in solution increases suggests a general mechanism (excepting methanol) whereby alcohols promote the production of light-absorbing compounds more readily than they deactivate imidazole."
11,Conclusions,"The seven alcohols studied elicit changes in chemical reactivity in the glyoxal and ammonium sulfate system. The addition of an alcohol likely alters the composition of the solvent by inducing the formation of micro-heterogeneities of hydrated alcohol molecules in an already complex solution environment containing solvated sulfate ions and a mixture of reactants and products. If, as has been suggested elsewhere [Onori and Santucci, 1996], the water in the SOA-mimicking solutions exists in two forms, bulk and hydrating, then micro-heterogeneities and hydrated sulfate clusters may force a partitioning of the reactants to the remaining bulk phase, concentrating them within a smaller effective solvent volume. An exclusionary mechanism such as this would explain the ethanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol results where the production of light-absorbing products is large, but the reaction rate constants are similar across the concentration range. For the alcohols with concentration dependent rate constants, we cannot tell based on the present work if a concentrating effect induces an acceleration of expected reactive encounters, or whether the thermodynamics of the system change because of some aspect of the new solvent environment. One clathrate hydrate formation study found that the addition of alcohols does change the thermodynamic activity of the hydrate-forming solution, through changes in the water-water hydrogen bonding network [Alavi et al., 2010]. Regardless, the magnitude of the observed effects on reactivity, as given by production of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde and biimidazole, depend on both the species and the concentration of the added alcohol. While the general trend of more alcohol in solution leading to increased formation of imidazoles is observed for all the alcohols under study, it seems clear the mode of action for each alcohol is not the same. For several of the alcohols, there appear to be two reactivity regimes—with effectively a critical fraction at approximately 0.10 M—above and below which it appears the production kinetics for IC and BI follow two different trajectories. In general, below the ‘critical fraction,’ the slope of the relative absorbance change over concentration change, is appreciably larger than the slope after that point. The reactivity results do not correlate directly with tail hydrophobicity, as they do in other experiments [Onori and Santucci, 1996], nor with bulk dielectric constant. The additional complexity of chemical reactions in the ternary solvent used here, versus binary alcohol/water mixtures, presents multiple competing hydration targets for both the alcohols and water, as evidenced in the sulfate and imidazole solvation studies discussed above. Further work is needed to fully understand the molecular-scale mechanism(s) for the differences in reactivity as a function, for example, of alkyl chain composition or the details of salt-solvent interactions. The work presented here offers several important implications for future studies of atmospheric aerosols. Properties that describe a solution in bulk, such as dielectric constant, are not necessarily reliable predictors of subsequent system behavior, at least for alcohols (see, for example, the data in Table 1 versus Tables 2 and 3). The composition of the solvent clearly influences SOA chemistry: the ternary sulfate/water/alcohol solvent matrices studied here readily reveal composition-dependent behavior. Actual aerosol particles contain more complex mixtures of organic compounds, with varying degrees of oxidation, and inorganic salts, potentially at concentrations far exceeding the present work. The myriad additional functional groups in these real mixtures are likely to result in both competitive and cooperative effects in the chemical and physical properties of an aerosol, and thus warrant further study. Indeed, the alcohol/water solvent system itself is complicated, and requires a deeper assessment of the role of both the intermolecular interactions, but also of the structural behavior of, and between, components [Franks and Ives, 1966]. Finally, because the alcohol concentrations used in this study (0.010–1.0 M) are several orders of magnitude larger than the concentrations an aerosol are likely to be exposed to (which based on the Henry's Law values in Table 1, are on the order of μM), two comments regarding relevance are warranted. First, the data presented here show that two orders of magnitude changes in alcohol concentration are enough to significantly alter the kinetics of the system. Our expectation is that these results suggest the importance of concentration, and concentration changes, of solvent-relevant chemical species in aerosol phase chemistry. Second, the water content of an aerosol particle can vary by at least two orders of magnitude, as a function of relative humidity [Kreidenweis et al., 2008], and so the results here offer an approximation of the type and magnitude of the changes in reactivity that a drying or wetting particle would experience."
