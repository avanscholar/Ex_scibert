0,Introduction,"The synthesis of functional chemicals by ‘tandem catalysis’ signifies an exciting frontier in chemical science. Tandem catalysis has received a great deal of attention as an efficient strategy involving a chemical transformation of substrates via coupled catalysis reactions. Of the three types of tandem catalysis, often categorized by the mechanism of reaction as either auto, assisted or orthogonal [1], the auto tandem catalytic process typically describes a sequential transformation of a chemical through two (or more) mechanistically distinct reactions performed by a single catalyst. Hence, the catalyst is capable of executing both reactions spontaneously as well as simultaneously via compliant interaction between the substrates, catalyst and any additional reagents added at the inception of reaction. Auto tandem catalysis is proven to be remarkably proficient as it has been applied in the prominent Shell Oxo Process as well as in the homogeneous metal catalysed synthesis of esters from acid chlorides by sequential Rosenmund-Tishchenko reactions [2,3]. Tandem catalysis has high potential in the sustainable route of fuel and chemical production, primarily via chemical transformation of waste generated through this line [4]. The biodiesel industry is one of the great trades for alternative renewable energy sources with bio-glycerol generated as the waste or by-product of the manufacturing process. The viability of biodiesel industry is highly dependent on the utilization of bio-glycerol produced as it directly helps to defray the large-scale production cost and industrialization of biodiesel [5]. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, approximately 10 billion litres of bio-glycerol will be produced worldwide by 2020, as the market for bio-diesel is kept growing. Hence, the greener way of eliminating this bio-waste would be valorising it to provide value-added chemicals that would instead tune the manufacturing loop into becoming more sustainable energy industry [6]. Transforming this bio-glycerol is also highly crucial as treating it as waste is both less economic and environmentally friendly. Glycerol is a non-toxic bio-molecule which is used as an animal feedstock besides being used as a platform for various chemical production through biological conversion as well as catalytic modification due to its multifunctional structure [7]. Anaerobic fermentation of glycerol typically results in the production of 1,3-propanediol, hydrogen and low molecular fuels such as methane [8–10]. Glycerol is also chemically modified through various catalytic processes such as acetalization [11], dehydration [12], etherification [13], hydrogenolysis [14], oxidation [15], and steam reforming [16]. As much as other catalytic processes do, glycerol acetalization is correspondingly acquiring particular interest where many heterogeneous catalysts have been tested for this process. Some of these include distinct hierarchical (micro-mesoporous) MFI zeolites [17], lacunary silicotungstates anchored to large pore zeolite Hβ [18], silica supported Rhenium (Re) nanoparticles [19], SBA-15 supported Molybdenum phosphate [20], mesoporous activated carbon supported bimetallic Nickel-Zirconia (Ni-Zr) [21], Ni promoted M-AlPO4 solid acids [22], Copper (Cu) promoted mordenite solid acid catalyst [23] as well as titanate nanotubes [24]. Glycerol acetalization is a liquid phase reaction in which the type of substrate (aldehydes or ketones) reacted, and catalyst used decides the end product of the reaction. Biodiesel additives are one of the attractive products from glycerol acetalization where it can be produced via many reaction routes. The literature on glycerol acetalization proved that more than 80% of glycerol conversion with 77% selectivity towards solketal (biodiesel additives) was achieved when the reaction was performed with 1:4 glycerol/acetone molar ratio and y amphiphilic niobium oxyhydroxide catalyst [25]. Another study reported on similar reaction performed with niobium-aluminum mixed oxides synthesized by a sol-gel process demonstrated a high catalytic activity and selectivity to solketal up to 85% and 95% respectively [26]. Besides that, a recent study performed on glycerol acetalization catalysed by lignosulfonate-based macro/mesoporous solid protonic acids showed that the reaction resulted in 100% glycerol conversion with more than 50% selectivity towards solketal when 1 mol of glycerol was reacted with 4 mol of furfural or methyl levulinate at 50–70 °C [27]. The current study is focused on the selective production of an oxygenated fuel additive, 1,3-dioxalane which is a cyclic ether. Besides being used in the gasoline production line, 1,3-dioxalane also serves as an aprotic solvent for various polar polymers as it rapidly dissolves polyester, urethanes, and epoxide [28]. In addition to that, the small size of the molecule also enables easy penetration into various compounds, allowing polymer-based coating process, as well as being used as an intermediate for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products [29,30]. 1,3-dioxalane also has extensive usage in lithium batteries [31], electroplating [32] as well as textile [33] industries. Hence, the selective production of this molecule is highly crucial due to the growing demand and broad applications existing in the market. Conventionally, 1,3-dioxalane is formed via a Lewis-acid catalysed reaction of ketones with oxiranes [34]. The homogeneous acid catalyst typically used for the synthesis of this molecule include p-toluenesulfonic acid [35], rhodium (II) acetate [36], manganese (III) acetate [37] and tin (II) chloride [38]. However, due to corrosion and non-environmental friendly issues, these catalysts are slowly being replaced by more advantageous heterogeneous catalysts which are reusable and can be separated easily from the liquid products. As such, recent literature was reported on the synthesis of 1,3-dioxalane from an acetalization of ethylene glycol with acetone, where the reaction was catalysed by Zirconia-pillared Tunisian bentonite clay [39]. Iron (FeCl3·6H2O) is a cheap and straightforward lewis acid catalyst that has been reported recently for green acetalization of glycerol with various carbonyl compounds. The study has published that acetalization with ketone results in excellent selectivity (97–100%) towards 1,3-dioxalane compared to the aldehydes which are only up to 76% [40]. In line with these findings, the current research is focussed on the auto tandem conversion of bio-glycerol with benzyl alcohol into 1,3-dioxalane over ferric chloride (FeCl3) modified MCM-41 catalyst. This study involves a unique approach of utilising glycerol both as a solvent and a feedstock facilitating tandem catalysis towards the direct synthesis of oxygenated fuel additives from glycerol and benzyl alcohol. The reaction progresses successfully to produce 1,3-dioxalane primarily by in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and subsequent condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with glycerol. Glycerol primarily acted as green solvent to facilitate the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and as a fuel additive precursor to produce 1,3-dioxalane in the preceding reaction. Immobilisation of a lewis acid FeCl3 on MCM-41 support attracts significant attention as it offers an alternative environmental-friendly, reusable and stable solid acid catalyst with a potential to overcome the disadvantages of catalyst separation, corrosion and hazardous pollution problems associated with conventional lewis acid catalysts. The structural and chemical properties of the newly synthesized FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst were characterized using XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDX, XPS, NH3-TPD, BET and 29Si solid state NMR analyses. Various reaction parameters such as temperature, time, reactant mole ratio and catalyst weight were optimised to obtain the best glycerol conversion and selectivity towards 1,3-dioxalane. Based on the theoretical and experimental investigations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been elucidated."
1,Experimental details,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The synthesis of FeCl3 incorporated MCM-41 catalysts was carried out by two preparatory methods including one-pot hydrothermal synthesis (direct method) and post-synthesis metal incorporation (indirect method). 2.1.1 Synthesis of MCM-41 The hexagonal mesostructured silica MCM-41 support was prepared by the hydrothermal procedure described in the literature [41]. In a typical procedure, 10.1 g of hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB, >98%, Aldrich) functioning as the structure-directing agent is mixed with an aqueous solution containing 3.4 g NaOH and 300 mL distilled water, until complete dissolution. To this solution, 57.8 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Aldrich) used as silicon source is added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The synthesis gel was kept under stirring for about 12 h. Subsequently, the synthesis mixture was transferred into Teflon lined autoclave vessels and kept under static hydrothermal conditions at 100 °C for 48 h (aging). The resultant product is filtered and washed free of sodium ions, followed by addition of HCl to bring pH to 7. The filtrate was dried overnight at 100 °C and calcined at 550 °C for six h to completely remove the template CTAB. 2.1.2 Synthesis of FeCl3/MCM-41 2.1.2.1 One-pot hydrothermal synthesis (Direct): In this method, a solution of FeCl3 (2 wt%) in acetonitrile was added dropwise to an aqueous CTAB solution after complete addition of TEOS. After FeCl3 addition, the synthesis mixture is kept for aging followed by washing and filtration. The solid thus obtained was oven-dried overnight at 100 °C and then calcined at 400 °C for 6 h. The as-prepared catalyst was labelled as FeCl3/MCM-41 (D). 2.1.2.2 Post-synthesis metal incorporation (Indirect): The pre-synthesized and calcined MCM-41 support (BET surface area >1000 m2/g) was used for the preparation of FeCl3/MCM-41 catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation method. A required amount of 2 wt% anhydrous FeCl3 was dissolved in acetonitrile and stirred for 10 min to obtain a clear solution. To this, 2.93 g of MCM-41 is added and kept under stirring to get a homogeneous suspension. The slurry was gently heated at 45 °C to evaporate acetonitrile. The resultant solid was allowed to dry at room temperature and then oven-dried overnight at 100 °C, followed by calcination at 400 °C for 6 h. The resultant catalyst was labelled as FeCl3/MCM-41 (I)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed on a Rigaku’s Miniflex X-ray diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kβ radiation (λ = 1.392 Å). The measurements were conducted in the range of 2θ = 2–80° using a beam current of 15 mA and a beam voltage of 40 kV. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the catalysts were recorded on UATR PerkinElmer Spectrum Two instrument with a spatial resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans within the spectral range of 4000–400 cm−1. The morphology and the elemental composition of the catalysts were analysed on a Phenom XL Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analyzer (SEM-EDX). A beam voltage of 10 kV at 5,000x magnification and a backscatter electron detector (BSD) were used to capture the scanning electron micrographs. A beam voltage of 15 kV at a high vacuum pressure (1Pa) and a secondary electron detector (SED) were used for the surface elemental analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalysts was performed on a Thermo k-Alpha XPS instrument with core levels aligned with C 1s binding energy of 284.6 eV and a pressure of 1 × 10−9 Torr. The specific surface area of the catalysts was estimated using N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K by the multipoint BET method taking 0.0162 nm2 as its cross-sectional area using Autosorb 1C (Quantachrome instruments). The mesoporous silica framework structure of MCM-41 catalysts was examined using 29Si solid-state NMR technique performed on DD2 Oxford Magnet AS-500MHz spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). The temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was performed with 10% NH3–He in Ar (50 mL min−1) from 80 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 on a AutoChem 2910 Micromeritics instrument."
4,Reaction procedure,"2.3 Reaction procedure A direct acetalization reaction of glycerol with benzyl alcohol was carried out in a 50 mL round bottom flask under reflux conditions. The flask was charged with glycerol (10 mmol), benzyl alcohol (12 mmol) and 100 mg of catalyst. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at 100 °C for 60 min. The products were identified by GC-MS and analysed using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a DB-Wax capillary column (Agilent, 0.32 mm, 30 m) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion of glycerol and selectivity to solketal were calculated based on the following equations: Glycerol Conversion ( % ) = moles of glycerol ( initial ) − moles of glycerol ( Final ) moles of glycerol ( initial ) × 100 Solketal Selectivity ( % ) = moles of solketal formed moles of glycerol converted × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results 3.1.1 XRD analysis The low-angle and wide-angle XRD patterns of pure MCM-41, FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst prepared by indirect post synthesis metal incorporation method and FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst prepared by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method are presented in Fig. 1 (A & B). As shown in Fig. 1A, the low-angle XRD pattern of MCM-41 revealed the presence of characteristic diffraction peaks of (100), (110) and (200) at 2θ = 2.4°, 3.96° and 4.53° respectively, indexing to the hexagonal symmetry of MCM-41 [42]. Those three characteristic peaks were also observed in FeCl3/MCM-41 catalysts, which suggests that the incorporation of FeCl3 had no deteriorating effect on the long-range order of MCM-41. However, the decrease in the intensity of peaks in case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst is clearly distinguished, which indicates that the effect of the method of incorporation of FeCl3 into the MCM-41 framework influences the structural and textural properties of FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst [43]. According to the wide-angle XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1B, the MCM-41 exhibits a characteristic broad diffraction peak ranging from 2θ = 15°–30°. The intensity of the peak is slightly weakened after the incorporation of FeCl3 into the MCM-41 support framework. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction peaks that correspond to the crystalline phases of FeCl3, FeOCl as well as Fe2O3 were observed in case FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst. The appearance of these phases was probably due to the incorporation of FeCl3 into the hexagonal framework of MCM-41 via post synthesis method followed by calcination that enabled the thermal condensation of FeCl3 with accessible hydroxyl groups in the silica framework and the growth of crystalline phases [44]. The inset XRD pattern (b) shows the corresponding FeCl3, FeOClx and Fe2O3 phases marked as ∗, #, $ respectively and given with appropriate hkl values based on the standard values. However, no characteristic diffraction peaks associated with FeCl3 were detected in FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst, which is a clear indication of the amorphous phase. Moreover, the direct synthesis method incorporates FeCl3 species into the synthesis mixture before hydrothermal processing, which would possibly result in the structural breakdown of the catalyst [45]. Therefore, the XRD pattern of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst clearly demonstrated the retention of mesostructure and long-range order of MCM-41 together with the presence of incorporated iron species into the mesoporous silica framework. 3.1.2 FTIR analysis To investigate the bond formation and the nature of interaction between FeCl3 and MCM-41, FTIR spectra of pure MCM-41, FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) and FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalysts were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2 , MCM-41 exhibits a band at 454 cm−1, which is due to tetrahedral Si–O bending modes, and this band was slightly shifted to higher wavenumber after FeCl3 incorporation. The absorption band at 810 cm−1 and a band at 1050 cm−1, with a corresponding shoulder at 1248 cm−1 are assigned to the external asymmetrical stretching modes of Si–OH and the internal bending vibration of Si–O–Si respectively [46]. These vibration bands were shifted to 800 cm−1 and 1048 cm−1 in FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst and to 790 cm−1 and 1036 cm−1 respectively in FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst. This is due to the interaction or binding of FeCl3 with silanol groups of MCM-41. However, in the case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst, the absorption band at 1036 cm−1 was found to be less intense with the disappearance of the corresponding shoulder peak. Both MCM-41 and FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst revealed the presence of O–H bending vibrational band at 1628 cm−1 that did not appear in FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst. These variations clearly indicate the structural differences of the catalyst in terms of the original structure of MCM-41 and the interaction of FeCl3 with the mesoporous silica framework because of the effect of preparation method. Additionally, all the samples display a broad band centred around 3079-3450 cm−1, that corresponds to the O–H stretching vibrations of the silanol groups in the adsorbed water. 3.1.3 29Si solid state NMR The 29Si solid state NMR was performed to study the interaction of FeCl3 with the surface of MCM-41 catalyst. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the spectra revealed two characteristic peaks because of the chemical linkage established between FeCl3 and the silanol groups of MCM-41. The first peak was observed at chemical shift δ = — 107 ppm with a highest intensity corresponding to the framework silica. The second peak was observed at chemical shift δ = — 94 ppm with less intensity characteristic of terminal silanol groups of MCM-41. The chemical shifts of both the characteristic peaks were significantly altered after FeCl3 incorporation on to MCM-41. Also, peak broadening was observed in case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst, which is probably due to the associated weak magnetic moment and the nanocrystalline FeOClx formation. 3.1.4 SEM analysis Scanning electron micrographs and elemental composition of MCM-41, FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) and FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The mesoporous MCM-41 (Fig. 4a) revealed particles of uniform spherical morphology while the loading of FeCl3 showed fine aggregates of crystallites in case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst (Fig. 4b) large non-uniform aggregates in case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst (Fig. 4c). The atomic concentrations of all the elements performed by a semi-quantitative elemental analysis at discrete points are listed in the tables below the SEM images and confirmed the presence of Fe and Cl in FeCl3/MCM-41 catalysts. 3.1.5 XPS analysis XPS analysis of two catalysts prepared by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) and post-synthesis metal incorporation method FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) was performed to obtain a further understanding on the structural changes and to know the surface distribution of iron species on MCM-41. The results obtained are presented in Fig. 5 . XPS core-level spectra of Fe 2p level in case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) appeared at 711.3 eV and 724.2 eV which corresponds to trivalent iron chloride species and iron oxide species respectively. However, in the case of FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst the Fe 2p level spectra appeared different with a slight shift in binding energy to 711.5 eV and moreover the peak due to trivalent iron oxide species did not appear. This is a clear indication of a structural change in FeCl3 incorporation on MCM-41 because of the effect of preparation method. Si 2p level spectra of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) showed two distinct chemical shifts at 104.2 eV and 103.3 eV corresponding to the silicon present in the silica framework and surface silanol groups respectively. But the binding energies of silicon present in FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst was observed to shift towards 104 eV and 102.9 eV which indicates changes in the surface silanol groups and silica framework during the preparation method. Both FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) and FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalysts showed two chemically distinct O 1s species at 533.5 eV and 532.1 eV which could be assigned to hydroxyl oxygen of silanol groups and silica framework oxygen respectively. However, the broadening observed in FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst around the binding energy region 530–531 eV indicates the formation of Fe–O linkage."
7,Catalyst performance,"3.2 Catalyst performance The direct synthesis of biofuel additives from glycerol and benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst is presented in Scheme 1 . The reaction involves in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and subsequent condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with glycerol to produce 1,3-dioxalane (5-membered) and 1,3-dioxane (6-membered) as major and minor products respectively. Glycerol herein acts as a green solvent that facilitates the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and as a precursor for the formation of biofuel additives. The formation of 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane depends on the type of hydroxyl groups of glycerol molecule involved in acetalization. 1,3-dioxalane, commonly known as Solketal is thermodynamically less stable but kinetically more favourable hence obtained as a major product in glycerol acetalization reaction. Similar observations in a microwave reactor were reported in our previous study [23]. 3.2.1 Influence of preparation method In general, the preparation method and the textural properties of catalysts are closely related with the catalytic performances of catalysts. Therefore, we initially studied the effects of preparation methods (direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis and indirect post synthesis method) on the catalytic activity of FeCl3/MCM-41 catalysts for the glycerol acetalization with benzyl alcohol under the reaction condition of 100 mg catalyst, 10 mmol of glycerol, 12 mmol of benzyl alcohol at 100 °C and 60 min of reaction time. From the results, it was observed that the effect of preparation method had a significant effect on the catalytic activity. Remarkably, the activity of catalysts prepared by post-synthesis method was found to be prominent than the catalysts prepared by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. The glycerol conversion (92%) and product selectivity (75% dioxalane and 25% dioxane) was found to be considerably high over post-synthesized catalysts when compared with those prepared by direct one-pot hydrothermal method (59% glycerol conversion; 37% dioxalane and 12% dioxane). This could be attributed to the better interaction of FeCl3 with MCM-41 during post-synthesis metal incorporation method and FeOClx formation due to the reaction between FeCl3 and surface silanol groups on MCM-41 that acts as a strong Lewis-acid site, corroborated by XRD, XPS and solid state NMR techniques. Moreover, previous research [42] also revealed that post-synthesis methods are a promising technology having received much attention and resulting in high catalytic activities. Owing to the good performance of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalysts prepared by indirect post-synthetic metal incorporation method (or Incipient Wetness Impregnation Method), the as-synthesized catalysts were adopted for further optimisation studies of glycerol acetalization reaction with benzyl alcohol. 3.2.2 Influence of reactant mole ratio The effect of glycerol to benzyl alcohol mole ratio was studied by varying the ratio from 1:1 to 1:4 over 2 wt% FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst. As observed in Fig. 6 , the glycerol conversion was found to be increasing from 72% to 92% with an increase in the mole ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 and remained same at a further increase to 1:4. This indicates the saturation of benzaldehyde (formed via in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol) required to react with glycerol over the catalyst active sites. In contrast, the selectivity to dioxalane gradually showed a decline with a steady rise in the selectivity to dioxane when mole ratio increased from 1:1 to 1:4. The best selectivity to dioaxalane (75%) and dioxane (25%) was attained at 1:3 mol ratio of glycerol: benzylalcohol and therefore is the optimum mole ratio for the reaction. 3.2.3 Influence of catalyst amount The effect of the amount of FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst on glycerol conversion and product selectivity was studied by varying the catalyst amount in the range of 50–150 mg. As can be seen from Fig. 7 , the increase in the catalyst concentration increases the conversion of glycerol progressively from 73% to 93%. This is attributed to an increase in the number of available catalytically active sites with an increase in the amount of catalyst. The selectivity to dioxolane reaches saturation conversion at 100 mg of the catalyst amount beyond which the selectivity dropped to 58%. This is due to the increase in the selectivity to dioxane with an increase in catalyst amount. Hence, 100 mg of the catalyst was considered to be optimum for the maximum glycerol conversion and selectivity to dioxalane. 3.2.4 Influence of reaction temperature Another set of experiments were conducted to examine the effect of temperature on the glycerol conversion and product selectivity in glycerol acetalization with benzyl alcohol. The experiments were performed at four different temperatures (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C) while keeping other reaction parameters constant (i.e., GL/BA molar ratio of 1:3, catalyst amount 100 mg and 60 min of reaction time). The results are presented in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8, a substantial enhancement in the conversion of glycerol and selectivity to dioxalane was observed as the temperature increases from 60 °C −100 °C. The glycerol conversion varies between 64% and 92% at 60 °C and 100 °C. The dioxalane selectivity ranges between 52% and 75% at the same temperatures. As the temperature elevated to 120 °C, a further increase in glycerol conversion (95%) occurred while the selectivity to dioxalane dropped slightly to 74%. As a result, 100 °C was considered the appropriate temperature for the reaction. 3.2.5 Influence of reaction time To examine the variation of glycerol conversion and product selectivity with time, acetalization of glycerol with benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst was analysed at different time intervals (reaction time varied from 15 to 75 min). As can be seen from Fig. 9 , the conversion of glycerol was increased with an increase in the reaction time. The conversion reached about 51% within 15 min and its maximum value of 95% after 75 min. One can, however, note from Fig. 9 that the kinetically favoured product dioxolane was formed initially as the major product and with an increase in time the selectivity towards the thermodynamically more stable product, dioxane increases slowly to a maximum of 32%. At 60 min of reaction time, the best activity with 92% glycerol conversion and 75% selectivity to dioxolane was detected while at 75 min, the selectivity to dioxolane reduced to 68% though there was a rise in glycerol conversion (95%). This behaviour can be explained by the ionic attack of a hydroxyl group of glycerol on the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde formed via benzyl alcohol oxidation that favours the formation of 5-membered dioxalane and represents the fastest and determining step during acetalization [47]. As the reaction progresses, active site-glycerol-benzaldehyde complex facilitates the formation of more stable dioxane which could be due to multiple nucleophilic attacks of the hydroxyl groups of glycerol."
8,Control experiments,"3.3 Control experiments Several experiments of glycerol acetalization were conducted without a catalyst, as well as with only MCM-41 support, with only 2 wt% FeCl3 active species and with 2 wt% FeCl3/MCM 41 (I) catalyst separately under identical reaction conditions of 100 mg catalyst, GL/BA molar ratio of 1:3 at 100 °C and 60 min of reaction time. From Table 1 , it is evident that the reaction without catalyst did not facilitate glycerol acetalization reaction. The presence of MCM-41 showed diminutive progress towards the formation of 1,3-dioxalane which could be attributed to the acidic nature of MCM-41. It is interesting to note that the active species FeCl3 retained its activity with significant improvement in the reaction at a rate of 89% glycerol conversion and 65% selectivity to 1,3-dioxalane. However, the activity of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst was superior among others with a larger turn over number, which is ascribed to the high acidity high surface area and uniform dispersion of FeCl3 over MCM-41 verified by NH3-TPD and BET analyses."
9,Heterogeneity experiment,"3.4 Heterogeneity experiment In an effort to prove the heterogeneity of catalyst, an experiment of glycerol acetalization with benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst was carried out under optimised reaction conditions. The catalyst was filtered off from the reaction mixture after 30 min of reaction time and allowed the filtrate to undergo the reaction up to 60 min (Scheme 2 ). Both the samples obtained after 30 min and 60 min were analysed on GC for the activity. It is noteworthy that glycerol conversion in both the samples remained the same at 68%. This clearly indicates that there was no metal leaching from the catalyst during the course of the reaction. Therefore, the results provide an evidence that FeCl3 does not leach from MCM-41 support and thereby FeCl3/MCM-41 is a true heterogeneous catalyst for the tested reaction time (see Scheme 3)."
10,The reusability of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst,"3.5 The reusability of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst The activity and stability of FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst was examined by recycling it through five successive reaction cycles. The catalysts were recovered from the reaction mixture by simple centrifugation, followed by washing with acetone and distilled water several times. The separated catalyst was then subjected to drying in an oven at 100 °C and used for further runs. The reactions were performed under similar conditions employed for the fresh catalyst, and the results are presented in Fig. 10 . A marginal decrease in glycerol conversion was observed after the fourth reaction cycle while the selectivity to both 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane remained unchanged. This trivial change in glycerol conversion could be probably due to mass transfer limitations. The recovered catalysts were characterized by FTIR, BET and NH3-TPD to check for any significant changes. The FTIR spectra of recovered catalyst retained the structural bands of MCM-41 suggesting that the structure of recovered catalyst remained intact (Fig. 11 ). The BET surface area and acidity of recovered FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst is comparable and consistent with that of the fresh catalyst (Table 2 ). Hence, it can be concluded that the stability and activity of the catalyst persisted up to five reaction cycles without any significant variations."
11,The plausible catalytic reaction pathway for the acetalization of glycerol with benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst,"3.6 The plausible catalytic reaction pathway for the acetalization of glycerol with benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst The present study demonstrates the direct synthesis of biofuel additives, 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane from glycerol and benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst. The reaction progresses by a tandem catalytic pathway involving in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and subsequent condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with glycerol to produce 1,3-dioxalane. The probable reaction pathway for formation of 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane from glycerol and benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst is shown in Scheme 2. The reaction typically involves three mechanistic steps: i) coordination and activation of carbonyl group; ii) nucleophilic attack of –OH group of glycerol on to carbonyl group (-CO) of benzaldehyde; iii) dehydration and cyclisation of the intermediate species resulting in the formation of isomeric 5-membered 1,3-dioxalane and 6-membered 1,3-dioxane. The 5-membered product formation was found to be highly favourable and obtained as a major product because of the stable carbocation formed by the attack of a secondary hydroxyl group of glycerol, in accordance with the previous reports [20,23]."
12,Conclusions,"A novel and sustainable method for the synthesis of fuel-oxygenated additives over a highly efficient, recyclable and stable tandem catalytic system has been established by way of two industrially significant reactions: glycerol acetalization and benzyl alcohol oxidation. FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst has demonstrated a new green synthetic pathway for the production of 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane by a promising one-pot tandem catalysis. The catalyst has established the dual capacity of catalysing the in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and succeeding condensation reaction of glycerol with benzaldehyde to produce 1,3-dioxalane. Besides, glycerol was proven to be a green solvent in the primary reaction and as a feedstock in the succeeding reaction. This auto tandem catalytic reaction has shown a significant elevation in 1,3-dioxalane selectivity than the previously reported studies. A very good conversion (92%) and selectivity to the product (75%) were achieved under solvent free condition at 1:3 Gly/BA mole ratio, 100 °C and 60 min reaction time. The influence of catalyst preparation method on the catalytic activity was found to be substantial that the catalyst prepared by post-synthesis method was much more efficient than that prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. The enhanced activity was attributed to the increased interaction between active FeCl3 and MCM-41 support and high surface area. Compared to the FeCl3/MCM-41 (D) catalyst, FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst showed great efficacy due to the formation of active FeOClx species by thermal condensation of FeCl3 with silanol groups of MCM-41. The catalytic activity is well correlated with physico-chemical properties of the catalyst derived from XRD, FTIR, SEM EDX, XPS, BET, NH3-TPD and solid state 29Si NMR analyses. The catalyst was found to be stable and well reusable for five consecutive catalytic reaction cycles without considerable decrease in the activity and selectivity. The novel methodology and the developed FeCl3/MCM-41 (I) catalyst presented in this work offers a promising green synthetic route with a great potential for industrial applications in the production of bio-fuel additives."
