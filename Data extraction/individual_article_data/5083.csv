0,Introduction,"Organic synthesis by using photocatalysis (such as photocatalytic selective oxidation of aromatic compounds [1,2] and photocatalytic epoxidation of olefins [3,4]) receives increasing attention, since photocatalysis offers an alternative green route for the production of organics [5]. p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) is known as an important ingredient in the synthesis of many industrial chemicals, e.g., dyes [6], rubber antioxidants [7] and aramid textile fibers [8]. Generally, PPD is obtained by the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) under H2 atmosphere [8]. However, this process suffers from the limitations of rigorous reaction conditions, high cost and tedious procedures. Recently, the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD by using photocatalysis in the presence of HCO2 − or C2O4 2− ions as hole scavengers has been reported [9–12]. This method provides a new feasible approach for the PPD production because it achieves the one-pot preparation of PPD in water via utilizing sunlight. Furthermore, this reaction has been systematically studied in our previous work [11,12]. Carbon dioxide radical (CO2 −) is detected in the above system. This species has strong reductive ability (CO2 −/CO2, −1.80V vs. RHE [11–13]), and therefore can reduce 4-NA to PPD in water (4-NA/PPD, −0.30V vs. RHE [14]). In order to further understand the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD, we focus on searching new active species which are suitable for the photoreduction of 4-NA and clarifying their formation processes. In previous work, alcohol radicals (R’OH, R’CH2,C2H4 and i-C3H6) have been reported to show strong reductive abilities (from −0.54 to −0.69V vs. RHE) [15–17]. And some researchers have noticed the potential applications of these radicals in photoreduction reactions [18,19]. However, the roles of these radicals in the photoreduction reaction are still unclear. It is not clear whether these radicals are intermediate products or active species. Similarly, the clarification of their formation processes is also an interesting problem. It is not sure whether the alcohols react with photoinduced holes or hydroxyl radicals (OH) to give alcohol radicals. Furthermore, as far as we know, little attention has been paid to these species for the photocatalytic reduction of PPD. Herein, the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD via photocatalysis in the presence of different alcohols (CH3OH, C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH) was investigated in detail upon purging with N2. Electron spin resonance technique was introduced to detect the presence of these active species and to clarify their formation process in this system. Furthermore, on the basic of the experimental results, a mechanism was proposed to explain the photoreduction of 4-NA in the present alcohols. Our results may allow us to provide a new insight into the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD by using photocatalysis in the presence of alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD,"2.1 Photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD For the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA, an ozone-free 300W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Perfectlight Co., Beijing, intensity: ∼1.35W/cm2 at λ =300nm and 0.96W/cm2 at λ =420nm) with an infrared filter was used as the light source. Prior to the catalytic test, 80mg of a photocatalyst (TiO2 (Degussa Co.), ZnO (Aladdin Co.), PbBi2Nb2O9 (self-made [11]) or CdS (Aladdin Co.)) was suspended in 80mL of 4-NA (A.R., Alfa Aesar Co.) aqueous solution (20mg/L) in a reactor (100mL). After adding 0.2mL of an alcohol (CH3OH, C2H5OH or i-C3H7OH, A.R., Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.), the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30min to ensure eliminate oxygen in the system by purging with nitrogen (>99.95%). As the reaction proceeded, 4mL of the suspension was taken at a certain interval and was filtrated. The 4-NA and PPD concentrations during the reaction were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 380 and 238nm with a Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian Co.), respectively. The whole photocatalytic process was carried out under N2 bubbling with a flow rate of 60mL/min."
3,Electron spin resonance,"2.2 Electron spin resonance 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker A300 spectrometer at room temperature. General instrument setting are as follows: microwave power, 6.35mW; modulation amplitude, 3G; receiver gain, 1×103; time constant, 10.24ms; sweep time, 42s; center field, 3507G; sweep width, 80G. The ESR signals were generated from a photocatalyst suspension (5mg of the sample powders dispersed in 0.5mL of ultrapure water) in the presence of 5μL of alcohols and 15mM DMPO (97%, J&K Co.) under band-gap irradiation. Prior to the experiment, the ultrapure water (resistivity, 16.5MΩcm@25°C) was further purified by active carbon (2mm & down, Alfa Aesar Co.)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD,"3.1 Photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD Fig. 1a shows UV–vis spectral changes of the 4-NA aqueous solution over TiO2 photocatalyst as a function of irradiation time in the presence of CH3OH under UV light irradiation (λ ≥300nm). A rapid decrease in the absorption of 4-NA at 380nm along with simultaneous appearance of two peaks at 238 and 305nm has been observed. The peaks observed at 238 and 305nm are the characteristic peaks of PPD [10–12]. The results reveal that 4-NA can be reduced to PPD by TiO2 photocatalyst in the presence of CH3OH. The absorbance of PPD at 238nm in the UV–vis spectrum is 1.25 after 25min of UV light irradiation, while the 100% of 4-NA is converted. Therefore, the selectivity of PPD is ∼98%, since there is a liner relationship (A =0.0822 C −0.0054, R 2 =0.9994) between the concentration (C) and the absorbance (A) at 238nm for PPD [12]. Furthermore, GC–MS analysis results indicate that only PPD is detected after the reaction (see Figs. S1 and S2). These suggest that 4-NA can be efficiently reduced to PPD in the present system. Control experiment (4-NA and CH3OH without TiO2 photocatalyst) exhibits negligible photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA (see Fig. S3a), which indicates the photolysis of 4-NA can be ignored under UV light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 photocatalyst was also carried out under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm). No significant reaction of 4-NA is observed (see Fig. S4). These results reveal that the reduction of 4-NA to PPD is attributed to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 photocatalyst. For comparison, the photoreduction of 4-NA over ZnO photocatalyst in the presence of CH3OH was also investigated in this work. As shown in Fig. 1b, ZnO photocatalyst shows photocatalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NA to PPD, giving 100% of 4-NA conversion and 99% of PPD selectivity after 6h of UV light irradiation. In our previous work, PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS are active photocatalysts for the photoreduction of 4-NA in the presence of C2O4 2− and HCO2 − ions, respectively [11,12]. However, as shown in Fig. S5, no significant photoreduction of 4-NA is observed in the presence of CH3OH under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm) when PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS are used as the photocatalysts."
6,ESR analysis,"3.2 ESR analysis DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique has been introduced to investigate the photoreduction of 4-NA over different photocatalysts in the presence of CH3OH. Fig. 2a shows DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra of the samples aqueous suspensions under band gap irradiation (λ ≥300nm for TiO2 and ZnO; λ ≥420nm for PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS). ESR signal of the DMPO-OH adduct can be detected in the TiO2 and ZnO aqueous suspensions under UV light irradiation (λ ≥300nm). The formation of the OH radicals can be attributed to the reaction between photoinduced holes (h+) and H2O molecules (h+ +H2O→ OH+H+). However, PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS cannot produce OH radicals due to the low redox potentials of valence bands (VB) for PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS (E VB (PbBi2Nb2O9)=2.30V [11], E VB (CdS)=1.90V [20] and E (OH/H2O)=2.72V [21] vs. RHE). When CH3OH is introduced into the presence system, sextet characteristic peaks of the DMPO-CH2OH adduct are clearly observed in the ESR spectra for TiO2 and ZnO (Fig. 2b) [22]. It has been reported that the reduction potential of methanol radical (CH2OH) is −0.54V vs. RHE [15]. Therefore, the species can reduce 4-NA to PPD (E (4-NA/PPD)=−0.30V vs. RHE [14]). This can explain that TiO2 and ZnO show photocatalytic activities for the reduction of 4-NA to PPD in the presence of CH3OH, whereas PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS do not. Moreover, the signal intensity of the DMPO-CH2OH adduct in the ESR spectra for TiO2 is stronger than that of ZnO. As a result, TiO2 photocatalyst shows higher photocatalytic activity than ZnO photocatalyst for the reduction of 4-NA in the presence of CH3OH (see Fig. 1). In this work, similar phenomena were observed in the photoreduction of 4-NA over TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts due to their similar energy band structures. However, TiO2 shows higher photocatalytic activity than ZnO for the reduction of 4-NA to PPD. For the sake of simplicity, further work for the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD was mainly carried out over TiO2 photocatalyst."
7,Formation of CH2OH radical,"3.3 Formation of CH2OH radical As shown in Fig. 2, illuminated TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts can produce OH radicals, and therefore can give CH2OH radicals. This may suggest that OH radicals rather than photoinduced holes of photocatalysts react with CH3OH to give CH2OH radicals. In order to confirm the formation process of the CH2OH radical, DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra of TiO2 photocatalyst suspension in the presence of CH3OH and H2O with different volume ratios under UV light irradiation have also been obtained in this work. Fig. 3 shows that sextet characteristic peaks of the DMPO-O2 − adduct are observed in the TiO2 photocatalyst methanol suspension. This confirms that TiO2 photocatalyst can produce photoinduced electrons under UV light irradiation. However, the absence of the DMPO-CH2OH adduct signals in the ESR spectra is also observed. The DMPO-CH2OH adduct ESR signals can be detected when H2O is introduced into this system. As mentioned above, illuminated TiO2 photocatalyst can react with H2O to give OH radicals. The results confirm that OH radicals rather than photoinduced holes of TiO2 photocatalyst react with CH3OH molecules to produce CH2OH radicals. The possible formation process of CH2OH radical is shown as follows [22]. CH 3 OH ⟶ OH CH 3 O ⟶ H shif t CH 2 OH"
8,Effect of CH2OH radical,"3.4 Effect of CH2OH radical Generally, photoinduced electrons of TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts have reductive abilities (E CB (TiO2)=−0.20V, E CB (ZnO)=−0.07V vs. RHE) [20,21]. However, the reduction potential of 4-NA to PPD is −0.30V vs. RHE [14]. Therefore, the photoinduced electrons (e−) of TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts cannot reduce 4-NA to PPD due to their low redox potential. They only can participate in the reduction of water (e− +H2O→OH− +H2, E (H2O/H2)=0.00V vs. RHE [21]) because H2 is detected in the present system. Compared with photoinduced electrons, CH2OH radical has stronger ability, and therefore can reduce 4-NA to PPD. In order to confirm the effect of CH2OH radical on the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD, the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD over TiO2 photocatalyst has been carried out under different conditions. As shown in Fig. S6, no significant photoreduction of 4-NA is observed after 25min of UV light irradiation neither in the presence of TiO2 photocatalyst upon purging with N2, or in the presence of TiO2 photocatalyst and CH3OH. However, 4-NA is rapidly reduced to PPD in the presence of TiO2 photocatalyst and CH3OH upon purging with N2 under UV light irradiation (Fig. 1a). Evidently, both the addition of CH3OH and N2 atmosphere are indispensable for the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA over TiO2 photocatalyst. N2 atmosphere has been proved to be an important factor for the formation of the active species [11,12]. For the effect of CH3OH, as mentioned above, TiO2 photocatalyst can produce CH2OH radical in the presence of CH3OH under UV light irradiation. The CH2OH radical has strong reductive ability. Therefore, this radical is an active species responsible for the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD."
9,Effects of other alcohols,"3.5 Effects of other alcohols As mentioned above, TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts show the photocatalytic activities for the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD under UV light irradiation in the presence of CH3OH upon purging with N2. In this work, other alcohols (C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH) have also been used to investigate the photoreduction of 4-NA. As shown in Figs. 4 and S3 , 4-NA can be efficiently reduced to PPD over TiO2 photocatalyst in the presence of C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH under UV light irradiation, giving 100% of 4-NA conversion and 98% of PPD selectivity. The total organic carbon values of the 4-NA aqueous solution before and after the photoreduction reaction have been measured by a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-V CPH, Shimdzu Co.). The slight change of the total organic carbon value may be ascribed to the oxidation of alcohols by the TiO2 photocatalyst under UV light irradiation (see Table S1). Therefore, the photoreduction of 4-NA rather than the photooxidation of 4-NA is observed in the present system. Furthermore, ethanol (C2H4OH) and isopropanol ( i-C3H6OH) radicals are detected by the DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique (Fig. 5 ). These alcohols radicals, like CH2OH radical, have strong reductive abilities (C2H4OH, −0.61 vs. RHE; i-C3H6OH, −0.69V vs. RHE) [16,17]. As a result, C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH are the efficient additives for the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD. Moreover, the signal intensity of the DMPO-CH2OH adduct in the ESR spectra is stronger than that of the DMPO-C2H4OH adduct or the DMPO- i-C3H6OH adduct (see Fig. 5). Therefore, compared to other alcohols (C2H5OH or i-C3H7OH), TiO2 photocatalyst shows the highest photocatalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NA in the presence of CH3OH (see Fig. 4)."
10,Mechanism for the photoreduction of 4-NA,"3.6 Mechanism for the photoreduction of 4-NA As a part of this work, the 2H (D)-labeled experiments have been carried out to confirm the hydrogen atom source of PPD. Fig. S2b shows that the molecular ion peak of PPD is observed at m/z =108 in the MS spectrum. However, when D2O is used as the solvent, the MS spectrum gives an ion peak at m/z =110 corresponding to the molecular ion peak of the D-atom-containing product [D]-PPD (see Fig. S7). The photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD was also investigated in the presence of CD3OD. As shown in Fig. S8, there is no a detection of [D]-PPD by the GC-MS analysis. The results indicate that the PPD formation is formed by the hydrogen transfer reaction between the 4-NA and H2O molecules. Therefore, the main process of the photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD can be described as follows [11]: On the basic of the above results, the mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD via using photocatalysis in the presence of alcohols (CH3OH, C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH) is proposed as follows (see Fig. 6 ). When a photocatalyst (TiO2 or ZnO) is illuminated under light (hv ≥band gap), electron–hole pairs are created. Then, the photoinduced charge carriers migrate to the catalyst surface and participate in the redox reaction. Photoinduced holes react with water molecules to give OH radicals (h+ +H2O→ OH+H+), while photoexcited electron directly participate in the reduction of water (e− +H2O→OH− +H2) under N2 atmosphere. The OH radicals will further react the alcohols to produce alcohol radicals (R’OH, R’CH2,C2H4 and i-C3H6). These radicals have strong reductive abilities (E (R’-OH/R’O)=−0.54 to −0.69V vs. RHE), and hence can reduce 4-NA to PPD (E (4-NA/PPD)=−0.30V vs. RHE)."
11,Conclusions,"Photoreduction of 4-NA to PPD over various photocatalysts (TiO2, ZnO, PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS) was investigated in the presence of CH3OH upon purging with N2. DMPO spin-trapping ESR analysis results indicated that CH3OH radical was detected in the present of TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts. Its formation was attributed to the reaction between the CH3OH molecule and the OH radical. This radical had strong reductive ability. Therefore, TiO2 and ZnO showed photocatalytic activities for the reduction of 4-NA in the presence of CH3OH, whereas PbBi2Nb2O9 and CdS did not. C2H5OH and i-C3H7OH were also found to be efficient additives for the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA to PPD due to the presence of ethanol and isopropanol radicals. Furthermore, the results of the isotopic tracing method indicated that the PPD formation was formed by the hydrogen transfer reaction between the 4-NA and H2O molecules. Our results could provide a new insight into the preparation of PPD by using photocatalysis in the presence of alcohols."
