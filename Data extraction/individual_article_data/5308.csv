0,Introduction,"The process of selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons with multiple unsaturation is widely used both in bulk and fine organic chemistry [1,2]. This process is especially important for the purification of alkene streams after steam cracking or alkane dehydrogenation since acetylenic compounds are poisonous for the polymerization catalysts used in the production of plastics [3,4]. Moreover, selective hydrogenation is used in the synthesis of terpenoids and vitamins A, E, K [5–7]. Various metal catalysts are known to exhibit high activity in the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds; however, palladium is proved to be by far the most selective metal for semihydrogenation due to its higher adsorption affinity to the alkyne/diene compared to that of the monoene formed [8–10]. Nonetheless, resulted alkene, as a rule, easily undergoes further hydrogenation to corresponding alkane, especially at high pressures and temperatures [11–13]. To achieve the highest possible alkene selectivity various factors including metal dispersion, carbon deposits, promoters, additives and operating conditions should be considered [3,8,14]. For example, the effect of particle size plays the crucial role in the hydrogenation process as it affects both activity and selectivity [15–18]. Apparently, there is an optimal particle size for each catalyst. It was found that decrease in dispersion may contribute to the decrease of specific activity as crystal planes with high coordination numbers, characteristic of larger particles, are typically less active in hydrogenation [8,19]. On the other hand, increasing dispersion may also bring a decrease in specific activity due to strong complexation of the highly unsaturated alkyne to atoms of low coordination number on small metallic particles and may cause the drop in selectivity as the activation of the π-bond needs the presence of a multiatomic site and the probability of the formation of such a site decreases greatly as the metal nanoparticle size decreases to <2 nm [20–22]. Selectivity of palladium in semihydrogenation may be further improved by promoters (other metals) or various additives, including carbon monoxide, amine and sulfur compounds [23,24]. Conventional catalyst for this process – palladium on quinoline-promoted CaCO3, known as Lindlar catalyst [25,26] – employs both of these strategies. On the one hand, these modifiers change the electronic density of the palladium, which affects the relative adsorption strength of the reactant, intermediates and hydrogen. On the other hand, promoters and additives may block the part of the metal surface and consequently affect the geometry of an active site. The choice of the support plays important role in the semihydrogenation, since the close interaction that can arise between the support and the active phase is analogous to that between the active phase and the catalyst modifiers [14]. Interactions with the support affect the key characteristics of the active phase – dispersion, particle shape, electronic properties and stability [27]. That is why in recent years apart from the Lindlar catalyst and traditional systems based on oxide materials [28–31], alumosilicates [32–34] and carbon [35–38], the materials with incorporated functionalities are of great interest. Firstly, in this way the expenditure of additives is reduced and the stage of their removal from the product is excluded. Secondly, careful selection of monomers and adjustment of the material structure allows to control morphology and surface features of metal phase more precisely. In recent years, MOFs [39–42] and organic materials, including dendrimer- and cyclodextrin-based materials [43–47], as well as polymers, resins and organic frameworks [48–52] with incorporated functionalities were used as supports for various transition metals in semihydrogenation. One of the types of materials used in hydrogenation processes are porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) – polymer materials constructed of aromatic rings, connected to each other by covalent C–C bonds [53,54]. Their distinctive features are high specific surface areas, chemical and physical stability and rigid structure. Due to aromatic nature of PAFs, a wide range of well-known and relatively simple techniques of functionalization is available [55–58]. Thorough selection of reagents and synthesis conditions allows to obtain materials with already implemented functionalities and structural characteristics tuned for specific purposes. All aforementioned advantages make PAFs promising materials for heterogeneous catalysis, because they allow to effectively stabilize transition metal nanoparticles and therefore solve the problem of their aggregation and deactivation thus improving stability of the catalyst [59,60]. It is also possible to tune electron and geometrical characteristics of the active phase by the incorporation of various functionalities [61,62]. Recently we reported the alkyne semihydrogenation using palladium catalysts, based on porous aromatic framework PAF-20 and its aminated derivative PAF-20-NH2 [63]. It was shown that modification of PAF with amino groups leads to the decrease of hydrogenation activity, but significantly enhances its selectivity towards required olefin and reduces deactivation of the catalyst due to metal leaching as well. We also developed active and selective catalysts based on porous aromatic frameworks modified with the ethanolamine groups [64]. It is worth noting the problem of a significant decrease in the porosity of hybrid materials, which may be overcome by changing of the modification approach. In current work we investigate the influence of the modification strategy on the hydrogenation activity of palladium catalysts supported by amino-modified porous aromatic frameworks. We believe that the control of the functional group implementation at the stage of the support synthesis will impact catalytic properties. Four palladium catalysts, based on porous aromatic frameworks modified with amino groups using two different routes, were synthesized and tested in the semihydrogenation of 1-octyne, phenylacetylene, 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrakis-(p-bromophenyl)methane was synthesized starting from tritylchloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) and aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, 99%) using the method described elsewhere [65]. Synthesis and modification of PAFs were performed using palladium (II) acetate (Aldrich, 99.9%), triphenylphosphine (Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, 99%), 1,4-benzenediboronic acid (ABCR, 96%), 4,4′-biphenyldiboronic acid (ABCR, 97%), trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich, ReagentPlus®), HNO3 (Component-Reaktiv, high-purity grade), SnCl2•2H2O (Aldrich, 98%) and H2SO4 (Reakhim, high-purity grade). Methanol (Arcos Organics, 99+%), dichloromethane (Irea 2000, analytical grade), tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Khimmed, high-purity grade) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (Ruskhim, high-purity grade) were purified according to standard procedures [66] and used as solvents. Sodium borohydride (Aldrich, ≥98%) was used for the preparation of catalysts. Phenylacetylene (Aldrich, 98%), 1-octyne (Aldrich, 97%), 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene (Aldrich, 96%) were used as substrates in hydrogenation reactions. Detailed synthetic procedures for the preparation of tetrakis-(4-bromo-3-aminophenyl)methane and porous aromatic frameworks are presented in the Supporting Material."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Catalysts were synthesized by impregnation of the support material with the solution of palladium (II) acetate in dichloromethane, which was subsequently reduced with sodium borohydride. The calculated amount of metal was 5% wt. A typical procedure for the synthesis of Pd–PAF-NH2 catalysts includes several steps. First, the support (150 mg) was dried in a vacuum at 60˚C for 1 h in a round-bottom flask. Then, it was impregnated with 16.7 mg (0.074 mmol) of palladium (II) acetate in 10 mL of dichloromethane. The flask was equipped with a magnetic stirrer anchor and a reflux condenser, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days. After that the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum at 30°C and the resulting material was suspended in 4 mL of methanol. Then 6 mL of 0.12 M solution of sodium borohydride in water-methanol mixture (1:1 vol.) was added dropwise to the resulting suspension. After stirring for 2 days the catalyst was isolated by filtration, washed with water (2 × 50 ml) and alcohol (2 × 50 ml) and dried in a vacuum at 60°C for 6 hours. The resulting product represented a light-grey powder."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests 1 mg of the catalyst and calculated amount of the substrate were placed in a thermostatically controlled steel autoclave equipped with a glass test-tube and a magnetic stirrer anchor. The substrate/Pd ratio (mol/mol) was ∼20000 for each catalyst and substrate; all reactions were run without solvents. The autoclave was sealed, filled with hydrogen to a pressure of 1 MPa and exposed at 60˚C for required amount of time; after that, the autoclave was cooled below room temperature and depressurized. In the recycling experiments, reaction was finished after the first run, the used catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and washed with diethyl ether, followed by centrifugation. The process was repeated twice, and the resultant solid was used directly in the next run with the same amount of fresh substrate."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations IR spectra were taken with a Nicolet IR2000 (Thermo Scientific) instrument using multiple distortion of the total internal reflection method with multi-reflection HATR accessories, containing a 45˚ ZnSe crystal for different wavelengths with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. All spectra were taken by averaging 100 scans. The 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy was performed with a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.6 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts are reported δ (ppm) relative to TMS (0.00 ppm). DMSO-d6 was used as a solvent. Solid-state 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE-II NMR 400 WB spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.6 MHz for 13C with using of 4 mm H/Х MAS WVT probe. Samples were packed into a 4-mm-diameter zirconia rotor and spun at the magic angle at a rate of 12 kHz. A RAMP cross-polarization pulse sequence was used with ramping of 1H-channel power from 100 to 70%, 2 ms contact time and 2 s recycle delay. For high-power proton decoupling during the acquisition the SW-TPPM sequence (τ = 8 μs, φ = 15°) was used. The 13C chemical shift scale was referred relatively to the CH2 group of solid adamantane (38.48 ppm), which was used as secondary external reference. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K on a Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390 instrument. The samples were out-gassed at 110°C for 6 hours before measurements. The surface area (SBET) was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on adsorption data in a range of relative pressures P/P0 = 0.05–0.2. Pore volume and pore size distribution were determined from the adsorption branches of isotherms using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) pore model for carbon slit pores. Total pore volume (Vtot) was determined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.965. TEM analysis was conducted on a JEM-2100 microscope with accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The processing of the micrographs and the calculation of the average particle size were conducted using the ImageJ software program. The Pd content in the catalysts was determined via atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) on an iCE 3000 Series AA spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, United States) with flame atomization. The data were processed using the SOLAAR software. Chemical composition was determined in Thermo Flash 2000 elemental analyzer in Center for Collective Usage «Analytical Center for the Problems of Deep Refining of Oil and Petrochemistry» of A.V.Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, RAS. XPS studies were performed on a PHI VersaProbe II 5000 instrument using excitation with Al Kα X-ray radiation at 1486.6 eV. The calibration of photoelectron peaks was based on the C1s line with a binding energy of 284.5 eV. The transmission energy of the energy analyzer was 160 eV (survey scans) and 23.5 eV (individual lines). Deconvolution of palladium high-resolution spectra was performed using CasaXPS v. 2.3.19PR1.0 software. The analysis was performed in the center “Materials Science and Metallurgy” of NUST MISiS. Analysis of the reaction mixture was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and a HP-1 column (50 m × 0.32 mm × 1.05 µm, 100% dimethylpolysiloxane grafted phase). Helium was a carrier gas; the analysis was carried out in a constant pressure mode (1.53 bar). The initial oven temperature was 60°C with a hold time of 4.0 min, then heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 200°C where it was held for 5.0 min prior to cooling. Chromatograms were recorded and analyzed on a computer using the HP ChemStation Rev.A.06.01 (403) software. Conversion was calculated by changes in the relative areas (S) of substrate and products peaks according to formula: Conv , % = ∑ S , % prod ucts S , % subs trate + ∑ S , % prod ucts × 100 % Substrate and product peaks were identified by retention times of the corresponding reference standards. An absolute calibration method was used for quantitative analysis. 1-Octene, styrene and 2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene were chosen as the target products in the hydrogenation of 1-octyne, phenylacetylene and 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene, respectively. Selectivity and yield on each product (i) for each reaction were calculated according to formulae: S e l i , % = S , % i ∑ S , % p r o d u c t s Y i e l d i , % = C o n v , % × S e l i , % 100 % Activities of the catalysts were expressed as turnover frequencies (TOF) and calculated as the amount of a reacted substrate (in moles) per mole of Pd per unit of time with the account of catalyst dispersity D according to the formula [11]: TOF , h − 1 = Conv × υ ( Subs trate ) t , h × υ ( Pd ) × D The average particle size (d) obtained by statistical treatment of the TEM measurements was recalculated to dispersion value as D = 0.885 / d [19]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the materials,"3.1 Characterization of the materials The well-known reported methods for modification of porous aromatic frameworks with amino groups include the nitration of polymer with nitric acid and subsequent reduction of nitro groups with tin (II) chloride [67,68]. These methods can be combined into a strategy called “post-functionalization”. Despite relative simplicity of this strategy, it has some drawbacks. Final distribution of the functional groups in the framework is random, they can also block the pores on the outside surface, therefore creating “dead space” in the bulk of the material [69]. At the same time, porous aromatic frameworks with amino groups can be synthetized from amino-modified monomers. In this case, the amount and position of amino groups are specified, and they are equally distributed in the material. This strategy may be defined as “pre-functionalization”. It was used earlier for the synthesis of several modified PAFs [58,70,71], including amino-modified ones, but with other monomers [59,61]. To establish the impact of the functionalization strategy on the properties of palladium catalysts, we prepared amino-modified porous aromatic frameworks of different porosity (Fig. 1 ). For the first time we attempted to synthesize PAFs from amino-modified monomer tetrakis-(4-bromo-3-aminophenyl)methane – the aminated derivative of tetrakis-(p-bromophenyl)methane. PAF-20-NH2-pre and PAF-30-NH2-pre materials were obtained using 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid and 4,4’-biphenyldiboronic acid, respectively. The difference between PAF-20 and PAF-30 materials lays, therefore, in the number of aromatic rings between the carbon nodes: for PAF-20 there are three rings, and for PAF-30 – four. We also synthesized amino-modified PAFs via post-functionalization strategy. In this case, PAF-20 and PAF-30 were synthesized from tetrakis-(p-bromophenyl)methane and corresponding diboronic acids in first place. Then they were modified with amino groups by nitration with nitric acid in trifluoroacetic acid media and subsequent reduction of NO2-groups with tin (II) chloride, resulting in PAF-20-NH2-post and PAF-30-NH2-post frameworks. Obtained materials were characterized by IR-spectroscopy, solid-state CP-MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption. IR-spectra for all frameworks demonstrated absorption bands in the region of 1608, 1484 and 3300–3500 cm−1 corresponding to amino groups (Fig. 2 , S1). The characteristic absorption band for the C–Br bond was not observed at 1076 cm−1 proving the completeness of cross-coupling reaction. It should be noted that absorption bands at 1529 and 1344 cm−1 corresponding to nitro groups after their reduction disappeared completely in the spectra of post-modified materials. CP-MAS 13C NMR spectra for all materials contain signals at 65 ppm for quaternary carbon atoms in the nodes of tetraphenylmethane units and in the region of 110–150 ppm for sp2-hybridized carbon atoms of aromatic fragments (Fig. 3 ). Peaks in the region of 145–146 ppm refer to carbon atoms bonded to NH2-groups [72]. The ones in the regions of 112–125 ppm and 140–144 ppm correspond to secondary and tertiary carbon atoms in substituted phenyl rings, respectively [56,72]. Peaks at 126–128 ppm and 137–138 ppm are assigned to secondary and tertiary carbon atoms, respectively, in non-substituted phenyl rings [73]. In pre-modified materials signals at 145–146 ppm and 140–144 ppm are resolved better, than in post-modified ones, due to the lower intensity of peak at 140–144 ppm, while the intensity of the peak at 137–138 ppm is higher. These observations are consistent with our statement about define location of amino groups in the structure of the pre-modified frameworks, as in their case the number of tertiary carbon atoms in substituted phenyl rings is statistically lower, than in non-substituted ones, and for post-modified materials with random distribution of -NH2 groups situation is reversed. Porous structure of the materials was examined using low-temperature adsorption-desorption of nitrogen (Table S1). All isotherms show a rapid N2 uptake at low pressure (P/P0 = 0–0.05), indicating a presence of micropores (Fig. 4 ). The adsorption curve has a slight slope in all cases, which may demonstrate the presence of mesopores in the materials. However, the hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption branches can appear not only because of mesoporous nature of the materials. For example, a large hysteresis loop that close only at low pressures may indicate diffusional limitations or swelling effects in PAFs [74–76]. The shape of hysteresis loop is different for pre- and post-modified materials. In case of PAF-20-NH2-pre and PAF-30-NH2-pre nitrogen uptake at low pressures (P/P0 = 0–0.05) is more abrupt, desorption and adsorption branches are almost parallel and close to each other. This may be a consequence of the pre-functionalization approach: due to the uniform distribution of amino groups, pores in these materials are well-connected and can be filled very fast. In contrast, for post-modified materials significant nitrogen adsorption continues up to P/P0 = 0.25. Also, the slope of the desorption curves is less than of the adsorption ones, and the difference between them increases with the decrease of pressure. This fact may denote limited pore availability in post-modified frameworks, which results in slower nitrogen diffusion during adsorption and desorption. Moreover, pre-modified PAFs significantly adsorb nitrogen at high pressures starting from P/P0 = 0.85–0.9. Typically, this means the presence of large pores (more than 10 nm) in the materials, which can be interparticle spaces in case of PAFs. Despite the fact that the contribution of these pores does not exceed several percent of the total pore volume, we can expect some large metal particles in palladium catalysts taking them up. Pore size distribution (PSD) for each material was calculated using the 2D-NLDFT model of N2 adsorption over carbon with standard slit pores. All PSD graphs contain intense peaks with maxima below 2 nm. The reason of this phenomenon is probably framework interpenetration [69,77,78]. On the other hand, a sharp adsorption of nitrogen in the region of low pressures, characteristic for both microporous and mesoporous PAFs, may be the cause. It should be noted, that for pre-modified materials both PSD plots are almost identical, while for post-modified materials they differ significantly. This means that in pre-modified materials pores are well-connected and can be filled or emptied quickly. In contrast, post-modified materials contain pores with limited access that provide diffusion restrictions. According to PSD curves, PAF-20-NH2-pre contains mesopores with an average diameter of 2.6 and 22 nm, PAF-30-NH2-pre – of 3.1 and 22.5 nm. Mesopores with the average pore sizes of lower boundary of the mesoporosity are in good agreement with the theoretical pore width for these materials, whereas bigger mesopores seem to be their special feature and could not be attributed to the voids between polymer particles. Similar PSD were observed for PAF70-NH2 and its derivatives [61]. In case of PAF-20-NH2-post and PAF-30-NH2-post PSD curves contain only mesopores of lower boundary of the mesoporosity in the range of 2-3 nm, which are smaller than ones in pre-modified materials."
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the catalysts Palladium catalysts were synthesized by the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles into pores of supports. Materials were impregnated with dichloromethane solution of Pd(OAc)2 [61]. After that, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the metal was reduced by the water-methanol solution of sodium borohydride. TEM microphotographs of the catalysts demonstrated the successful introduction of palladium nanoparticles into the pores of PAFs (Fig. 5 ). All catalysts contain palladium nanoparticles that are evenly distributed through the material. Particle size distribution curves for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post (Fig. 5, a) and Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post (Fig. 5, b) are close to normal (Gaussian) and exhibit maxima at 3.0 and 3.4 nm respectively. Distributions for pre-functionalized catalysts Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre (Fig. 5, c) and Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre (Fig. 5, d) demonstrate maxima at 2.3 and 3.7 nm respectively, and possess long tails up to 7–8 nm. It should also be noted that larger particles are located closer to the surface. That indicates the presence of bigger mesopores closer to the surface, while smaller pores are located most likely deeper in the material grain. Tables 1 and 2 present elemental composition of each catalyst determined by elemental analysis and XPS data. The last display that none of the obtained catalysts contains any traces of boron or bromine. Nonetheless, small amounts of phosphorus still remain from PPh3 used in Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. A significant amount of oxygen in all catalysts can be explained by the rapid oxidation of highly dispersed palladium nanoparticles during storage in air [79,80]. We compared bulk and surface concentrations of palladium. In all cases, except Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post, the amount of palladium on the surface is higher than in the volume of catalyst grain. The highest surface concentration of palladium is observed for pre-modified PAFs, which is consistent with the TEM data. We also considered bulk and surface ratios of palladium and nitrogen. In case of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post both ratios are equal, which indicates the uniform distribution of metal particles in the porous structure of the material. For both Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post and Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre Pd/N surface ratio is slightly higher than bulk one, which is consistent with higher palladium weight content for them and TEM data demonstrating the particles located closer to the surface in case of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre surface palladium to nitrogen ratio is three times higher than the bulk one, which is also correlates with the elemental analysis and TEM micrographs exhibiting a significant share of particles in the surface layer of the support, but is not related to uneven distribution of metal particles in the structure of the framework. All XPS spectra contain two sets of peaks related to Pd0 and Pd2+ (Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2) (Table S2 and Fig. 6 ). Both sets of signals for each material have lesser binding energies comparing to catalysts based on non-modified support (Fig. S2), which prove the impact of amino groups on electron density of the palladium [81,82]. It should also be noted, that binding energies for Pd0 3d5/2 in case of pre-modified catalysts are shifted stronger than for post-modified ones. This observation may be connected not only with the influence of amino groups as the binding energy of Pd 3d5/2 related to Pd° correlates with the particle size – the larger the particles, the lower the binding energy is [16,20]. Palladium nanoparticles in post-functionalized catalysts are smaller. They possess higher surface areas and higher uncompensated surface partly positive charge, therefore Pd0 binding energy is also higher, and Pd2+ phase becomes predominant for them [11,16]. For both pre-modified catalysts Pd0 phase prevails over Pd2+ fraction, because of the presence of large metal particles on the surface of the materials (Table. 2). More accessible pores in these supports influence not only the size of nanoparticles, but also their availability for XPS analysis."
9,Catalytic tests,"3.3 Catalytic tests To estimate the influence of the support structure on catalytic activity, obtained catalysts were studied in the hydrogenation of C8-unsaturated hydrocarbons, including 1-octyne, phenylacetylene and 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene. All the reactions were carried out in the absence of any solvent, which is desired for industrial processes due to the elimination of solvent removal step during product purification. At first, 1-octyne was examined as a representative aliphatic alkyne (Fig. 7 , S3 (a, b), S4). Terminal aliphatic alkynes are known to be highly reactive and prone not only to overhydrogenation with the formation of the corresponding alkane, but also to the isomerization of the resulting terminal alkene to internal alkene isomers [83–85]. In case of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post conversion of 1-octyne reached its maximum of 95% at 90 min. The highest selectivity towards 1-octene was 58% at 15 min and 51% substrate conversion, however, it dropped drastically afterwards up to 0% at 120 min. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post the pattern of the reaction differed significantly. The conversion of 1-octyne peaked at 73%, the selectivity decreased from 91% at 60 min to 87% at 120 min and then stayed almost the same. While for both catalysts octane was the main byproduct, in case of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post the share of isomeric octenes was also considerable and selectivity towards them went up to 14% at 120 min (Fig. S3, a). After 90 minutes of the reaction 1-octene was completely transformed to octane and iso-octenes. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post the ratio of 1-octene and octane has not changed after 120 min with the proportion of isomeric octenes being almost negligible. For Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre the conversion of 1-octyne peaked at 80% at 120 min, for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre the maximum conversion of 85% has been achieved within the same time. For both of these catalysts kinetic curves exhibit almost linear trend specific for zero-order kinetics, when the reaction rate is independent of substrate concentration and remains constant. With the use of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre the selectivity towards 1-octene remained at the level of 99% from 30 to 90 min of the reaction, however, it dropped to 90% at 180 min because of octane formation from 1-octene. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre the selectivity levelled off at 98% after 60 min. For both of these catalysts octane was the main byproduct, octene isomers were detected at negligible concentrations lower than 1%. The highest activity of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post (Table S3) may be attributed to the high Pd dispersion which results in an ensemble effect. Small particles (d < 3 nm) tend to contain a number of low-coordination active sites (steps, kinks or adatoms), which are typically more active in hydrogenation than larger particles containing crystal planes with high coordination number (terrace atoms) [19]. The explanation for the selectivity drop may be based on two factors. On the one hand, in comparison with Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre, which is also characterized with the low dispersion, the effect of strong interactions with amino groups resulting in increased selectivity, but decreased activity is demonstrated for pre-modified catalyst. On the other hand, Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post is based on framework with slightly smaller pores, comparing to Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post, and is characterized by small particles lying deeper in the catalytic grain, so the diffusion of hydrogenation products from the pores of the catalyst is hindered, and the possibility of 1-octene isomerization or its further hydrogenation to octane increases. Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre and Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre demonstrate much higher selectivity than catalysts of post-modified series, because of the enhanced interaction of the amino groups with the palladium nanoparticles. However, as in case of catalysts based on post-modified materials, PAF-20-NH2-pre creates additional diffusion limitations for 1-octene so it cannot leave the porous structure of the material and hydrogenates further to octane. The difference in dispersions of these two catalysts should be also taken into account, as Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre contains larger palladium particles. It is known that alkyne hydrogenation is a structure-sensitive reaction, because the activation of the π-bond needs the presence of a multiatomic site and the probability of the formation of such a site increases with decreasing dispersion, which contributes to higher selectivity [21,22]. We decided to vary the ratio of substrate and palladium to test its influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity (Tab. S4). Experiments showed that the hydrogenation of 1-octyne for all four samples is strongly affected by substrate/Pd ratio in different ways, proving the distinctions in their structures. The increase of substrate/Pd ratio for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post from 20000 to 40000 leads to the significant decrease in activity, but also contributes to the sharp rise of selectivity, as large excess of alkyne efficiently suppresses alkene readsorption and, therefore, overhydrogenation. It seems that the ratio of 20000 is insufficient for this catalyst, which leads to low selectivity in the conditions of our study. The decrease of the ratio to 10000 for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post leads to the slight increase of conversion and to the dramatic drop of selectivity towards 1-octene up to zero with octane as the main product, which correlates with tendencies observed for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post at the 20000 ratio. Activity of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre increased less significantly after the ratio decrease than in case of Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre, most likely because of hindered diffusion of substrate; selectivity of this catalyst also dropped significantly. Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre was the only catalyst whose selectivity towards 1-octene remained at the same level as in case of higher substrate/metal ratio, which indicates enhanced interactions between amino groups and palladium surface and positive effect of reduced dispersion. Phenylacetylene was chosen as a representative terminal aromatic alkyne (Fig. 8 , S3 (c), S5). Selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene is one of the most important problems in petrochemistry, since it is poisonous for the catalysts of styrene polymerization [3,14]. The activity of all catalysts in the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was lower than in case of 1-octyne. This phenomenon can be explained by both steric and electron factors. On the one hand, planar phenylacetylene requires larger adsorption area, and on the other, the weak -M-effect of phenyl ring can impede substrate adsorption on palladium nanoparticles [86,87]. For post-modified catalysts reaction trends remain the same as in case of 1-octyne. It should be noted, that on the initial stage of the reaction Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post demonstrates higher activity (Table S3) than Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post, which is most likely related to the facilitated diffusion of bulky phenylacetylene through larger pores of PAF-30-NH2-post. However, this effect was further compensated by the enhanced hydrogenation activity of smaller palladium particles in Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post. Conversion of phenylacetylene reached 100% at 120 min with Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post and 71% at the 180 min with the use of Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post. Selectivity towards styrene reached its maximum at 86% at 90 min with further drop to 79% at 120 min for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post and levelled off at 92% for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post. We suppose that in case of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post low selectivity is determined by the combination of steric factors, high dispersion and insufficient interactions with amino groups. On the one hand, the diffusion is hindered both for rigid planar phenylacetylene permeating the porous structure of the framework and for the products of the reaction leaving it, and on the other hand, small particles contribute to overhydrogenation, while the influence of amino groups is not enough to suppress this process. The trends of the reaction course for pre-modified catalysts resemble those for post-modified ones. At the initial stages of the reaction rate is higher for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre, however, after 30 minutes the reaction slows down noticeably, while for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre the reaction rate increases significantly at the same time. But again, facilitated diffusion for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre is then overcompensated by the effect of small palladium particles in the structure of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre. On the other hand, due to lower dispersion and enhanced interactions of amino groups with the metal particles, Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre proves to be the most selective. Its selectivity levelled off at 97%, while for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre selectivity dropped significantly after 60 minutes and declined to 94% afterwards because of ensemble effect for small palladium particles and retarded styrene desorption and its subsequent removal from the porous structure of the framework. We have further examined the effect of the support on the semi-hydrogenation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene as a representative aliphatic conjugated diene (Fig. 9 , S3 (d, e), S6). For such substrates the product distribution is determined by the stability of corresponding π-allyl intermediates, which are formed at the first stage of hydrogenation and are influenced by mean particle size and its local environment. For all of our catalysts the product of 1,2-addition 2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene was the main one. For post-modified catalysts the tendencies detected in the hydrogenation of previous substrates remained unchanged (Fig. 9). Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post is more active, than Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post (Table S3). The conversion of 99% for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post has been achieved in 30 minutes, for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post – in 60 minutes. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post selectivity towards 2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene maintained at the level of 75–76% even after reaching the 100% conversion of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene, for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post it dropped to 72%. Kinetic features of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre were similar to post-modified catalysts. However, this catalyst is slightly less active, than the ones of post-modified series, but more selective. This pattern is in agreement with both our suggestions about the hindered diffusion into the pore structure of PAF-20 framework and enhanced electron effects of amino groups confirmed by XPS data. Full conversion of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene has been reached after 90 minutes, and selectivity towards 2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene levelled off at 83–84% by the end of the reaction. It should also be noted that for post-modified catalysts 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene/2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene ratio was 1:5 and remained almost the same through the whole process (for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post it decreased to 1:3 after complete transformation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene), while for Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre it became slightly higher (∼1:7) by the end of the reaction. Kinetic features of the reaction differed significantly for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre. This catalyst was much less active, maximum conversion reached only 73%. The kinetic curve was characterized by the induction period. Distribution of the products also differed greatly: 2,5-dimethylhexane was not present up until the latest stages of the reaction, 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene/2,5-dimethyl-2-hexene ratio maintained at 1:2 throughout the whole process. The shape of the curve indicates most likely a case of self-poisoning by the chemisorbed 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene with the induction period and the low activity of the catalyst in general being the result of the adsorption rate predominance over the reaction rate. This process is typical for small electron-deficient particles (<4 nm) possessing mainly edge and corner atoms with low coordination numbers, which promote strong complexation of the highly unsaturated substrate [8,15,20]. It was also noticed that increasing nanoparticle electron deficiency shifted the selectivity of buta-1,3-diene hydrogenation in favor of 1,4-addition which correlates with high share of 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene in our case [88]. It should be noted, however, that according to XPS data among all catalysts in this study Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre possesses the smallest binding energies of Pd 3d5/2 related to both Pd0 and Pd2+ phases, which indicates, on the contrary, the presence of electron-rich atoms. In addition, this catalyst is characterized by the presence of large particles 6–8 nm in the subsurface layer of the support. It is worth noting, that not only electron, but also geometrical features of the metal surface influence the substrate adsorption [8,19]. They are determined, on the one hand, by metal dispersion and, on the other hand, by the functional groups that block part of the active sites, which influences geometry of adsorbed species [83,89-91]. We suppose that post-modified catalysts and Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre mostly provide active sites, that allow formation of diene species adsorbed predominantly by only one π-bond [92]. In case of Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre we suggest that the presence of larger particles containing crystal planes contributes to 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene adsorption in di-π form, therefore the chances of 1,4-addition are also higher. While amino groups definitely influence the electron characteristics of the metal surface in case of this catalyst, their amount is not enough to change the geometry of active sites to match the ones of post-modified catalysts and Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre. Overall lower activity could be explained by high substrate/metal ratio. When this ratio for Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre is decreased from ∼20000:1 to ∼5000:1, activity of the catalyst rises significantly up to the conversions of 77% in 1 hour. The product distribution for this catalyst, however, remains unchanged, thus proving its dependence from the catalyst structure. Recyclability tests were carried out for all catalysts (Fig. 10 ). The catalytic activity of Pd–PAF-20-NH2-post maintained almost the same during six runs of the recycle process. For Pd–PAF-30-NH2-post and Pd–PAF-20-NH2-pre catalytic activity had slightly decreased after the second run. However, it levelled off afterwards, so this phenomenon can be explained by the mechanical losses of the catalyst during the regeneration process or the wash out of some particles from the surface of the material. Catalytic activity of Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre increased significantly after the first run and returned to its initial activity only by the sixth cycle. Such tendency confirms our previous conclusions about the adsorption of the substrate. We suppose that the first run of the reaction is crucial and strongly adsorbed species can change the structure of an active site, this modification is higher for the substrate more adsorbed [24]. As a result, metal atoms are extracted by the hydrocarbon and produce higher activity sites."
10,Conclusions,"Highly selective palladium catalysts based on amino-modified mesoporous aromatic frameworks were developed. It was shown that frameworks obtained by different functionalization routes had different structural characteristics. Materials synthesized via pre-functionalization route possessed higher surface areas and developed porosity, which affected the properties of the resulting catalysts. The porous structure of PAFs determined not only size and distribution of palladium particles, but also geometry of active sites and eventually the course of the reaction and selectivity towards target olefins. For catalysts of PAF-20 series hindered diffusion of the substrate and reaction products to and from the active sites of the catalyst contributed to the overhydrogenation of the substrates. Catalysts of PAF-30 series had no problem of retarded desorption. However, in case of Pd–PAF-30-NH2-pre the structure of the framework affected active phase in such a way that the process of the substrate adsorption started to play vital role for the activity of the catalyst and final product distribution. At the same time, enhanced adsorption of the substrate increased selectivity and stability of the catalyst."
