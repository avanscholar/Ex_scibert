0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from water, as a clean and renewable energy process, provides a promising approach to mitigating climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions due to excess consumption of fossil fuels [1–7]. Offering efficient and sustainable photocatalysts to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy, which is available in unlimited supply, shows growing potential. Of many possible photocatalysts, TiO2 is regarded as ideal, thanks to its outstanding stability, nontoxicity, and low cost [8–10]. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been limited by its wide bandgap of ∼3.2 eV, which confines its optical absorption to the narrow UV region (∼4 %) of the total solar spectrum. TiO2 also has the downside of rapid charge carrier recombination [11–14], and therefore must be modified with noble-metal co-catalysts such as Pt, Pd, or Au to enhance charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under irradiation with solar light [15–17]. Finding a way to achieve a high level of solar hydrogen production using TiO2 photocatalyst without the use of noble metals is thus crucially important for practical applications [18–20]. Very recently, defective TiO2 (also called reduced TiO2 or colored TiO2, such as grey TiO2) has attracted much attention as a co-catalyst-free photocatalyst for solar hydrogen production from water [21]. Its enhanced photocatalytic activity has been attributed to introduced defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies, Ti3+), which act as co-catalytic centers in the same way as noble metals. A particular type of defective TiO2 exhibits solar photocatalytic hydrogen production activity comparable to that of Pt-modified TiO2 [20]. The synthesis of defective TiO2 photocatalysts, however, is usually carried out by exposing TiO2 to a reductive atmosphere such as hydrogen gas as part of a high-pressure/high-temperature treatment [22–26]. Some forms can be synthesized under less extreme conditions (e.g., hydrothermal reactions), but hazardous or expensive reagents are still needed [20,27,28]. The synthetic process of TiO2 for introducing defects clearly needs to be more economical and environmentally benign. Nitrogen (N) doping in TiO2, which is a well-known strategy to narrow its band gap and make it active under visible light, can simultaneously introduce oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the lattice [29–34]. N-doping in TiO2 can be performed under milder conditions than those used for synthesizing defective TiO2 while still requiring hazardous reagents like NH3 gas [31]. Moreover, the concomitantly formed Vo in N-doped TiO2 (and sole Vo in TiO2) are thought to act as recombination centers for photogenerated electrons and holes and thus decrease its solar (UV lightinduced) photocatalytic activity [33,34]. On the other hand, some reports note that a particular type of Vo in TiO2 can improve charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency [35–38]. N-doped TiO2 accompanied by Vo, if adequately designed under convenient conditions, thus appears to be a promising platform material for facilitating the application of solar photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. In the present study, we report the synthesis of Vo-bearing N-doped TiO2 via simple calcination in air of a spherical assembly of layered titanate nanosheets having an organic N source, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), as its synthesis solvent in the structure. This process leads to the topochemical conversion of the precursor to a spherical assembly of nanosheets composed of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with both N dopant and Vo (Scheme 1 ). The obtained material shows state-of-the-art-level co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from water, which can be explained by its Vo-induced high charge separation efficiency as well as a possible hierarchically mesoporous nature (i.e., high surface area) [39–42]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical mesoporous spheres,"2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical mesoporous spheres The layered protonated titanate (LPT) precursor was synthesized by the solvothermal reaction reported by Lou’s group with some modifications [43]. 25 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, Chameleon, 99.8 %) was gently stirred with 8.3 mL of DMF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8 %) for a few minutes, followed by the addition of titanium (IV) butoxide (TBOT, 0.83 mL, Sigma Aldrich, 97 %). The solution was then transferred to a 50-mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept in an electric oven at 200 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave had cooled, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min, washed with ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C to obtain LPT. The as-prepared LPT was then calcined in air at 450 °C in an alumina crucible for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min–1. The calcined LPT was named LPT-450. LPT was also calcined at 550, 650, and 750 °C to prepare products named LPT-550, LPT-650, and LPT-750, respectively. Likewise, a control sample, Solv-P25-450, was prepared using P25 (Sigma-Aldrich) with DMF and IPA."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer, with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA at a scan rate of 1˚ min–1. Micro-Raman scattering measurements (Photon Design Company) were carried out at room temperature using a 532-nm excitation light source. FTIR spectra were measured on a Shimadzu FTIR-4200. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were observed using a Hitachi SU-8230 microscope, operating at 10.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope, operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI Quantera SXM instrument, operated with Al Kα radiation at 20 kV and 5 mA. The binding energy shift was calibrated using the C1 s level at 285.0 eV. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was carried out at room temperature at a microwave power of 0.05 mW using a JEOL FA-200. Thermogravimetric curves were recorded using a Hitachi TG/DTA6200. UV–vis diffusion reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence spectra were obtained from a FP8500DS fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO Corporation) with an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. 1H and 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian 600PS solid NMR spectrometer. The resonance frequencies for 1H and 13C were set to 600 and 151 MHz, respectively. A 3.2 mm diameter zirconia rotor with a rotation speed of 20 kHz was used for 1H NMR, whereas a 6 mm diameter zirconia rotor at 7 kHz was used for 13C NMR. Prior to the 1H NMR measurement, the sample was heated under N2 flow at 150 °C to remove water molecules. N2 adsorption/desorption was carried out at −196 °C using a MicrotracBel BELMAX after the samples had been evacuated at 100 °C for 12 h."
4,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production 2 mg of the powder was dispersed into 5 mL aqueous methanol solution (1/1 in. V/V) in a Pyrex glass test tube (34 mL), with no noble metal co-catalyst (such as Pt) added. The solution was deaerated by Ar bubbling for 30 min, sealed with a silicone rubber septum, and then irradiated with a solar simulator (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd.) while stirring. The evolved headspace H2 was quantified using a Shimadzu GC-2010 plus gas chromatograph equipped with a BID detector. For AQY % measurement, a Pyrex glass tube was irradiated with monochromated light using an Ushio 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a Bunkoukeiki SM-25 monochromator. The number of incident photons was determined using a Bunkoukeiki S1337-1010BQ silicon photodiode. Apparent quantum yield (AQY %) for photocatalytic hydrogen production was defined as [number of H2 molecules evolved] × 2/[number of incident photons] × 100."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology The layered titanate precursor, layered protonated titanate of K2Ti2O5 (H2Ti2O5·nH2O) (LPT), was prepared via a solvothermal treatment of TBOT in DMF and IPA at 200 °C followed by calcination at 450 °C, following the method in the literature but with some modifications [43]. The powder XRD pattern of LPT, shown in Fig. 1 a, is assigned to H2Ti2O5·H2O [44]. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1b) also revealed that LPT had Raman peaks at 275, 385, 449 and 705 cm–1 ascribable to H2Ti2O5·nH2O [45,46]. As shown in the SEM image and TEM image (Fig. 1d and inset), LPT is composed of spherically assembled nanosheets of H2Ti2O5·nH2O. The LPT hierarchical spheres showed a BET surface area of 150 m2 g–1, which is higher than that of a typical nanoparticulate TiO2 like P25 (Fig. 1c). Upon calcination of LPT at 450 °C in air, the layered structure of LPT was transformed into anatase TiO2, while the original hierarchical spherical morphology was retained (Fig. 1a–g). High-resolution TEM imaging (Fig. 1g) confirmed the calcined product (LPT-450) to be composed of assemblies of nanosheets of anatase nanoparticles. The high BET surface area was also retained, as shown in Fig. 1c. The starting LPT was therefore topochemically transformed into hierarchical mesoporous anatase. Synthesis and calcination of LPT have been reported previously [43]; however, its nitrogen doping, concomitant Vo formation and photocatalytic activity have never been demonstrated previously. In this study, we first investigated whether N would be doped in the calcined product (LPT-450) after the topochemical conversion process, since the pristine LPT, prepared via the solvothermal reaction using DMF, had significant amounts (∼13 wt%) of an organic impurity containing N, as shown by the TG-DTA analysis and IR spectroscopy data (Figs. S1 and S2). Solidstate 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR revealed that LPT showed peaks due to DMF and dimethylamine formed via the decomposition of DMF, while LPT-450 hardly showed any such peaks (Fig. 2 ). In the light of the facts that LPT has only small amounts of water molecules in the interlayer space (H2Ti2O5.0.003H2O, Fig. S1) and its gallery height is calculated to be 0.42−0.69 nm as a result of subtracting the single layer thickness (0.27−0.54 nm) from the basal spacing (0.96 nm, Fig. 1e), organic compounds such as DMF and dimethylamine were likely located in the interlayer space of nanosheets, in addition to between nanosheets, and decomposed before introduction into the anatase structure of LPT-450. We next evaluated the chemical states of the introduced N species and possible introduction of Vo in LPT-450 using XPS. The high-resolution XPS core-level spectra of N 1s of LPT (Fig. 3 a) showed a peak at 402.2 eV, which is assignable to the nitrogen in adsorbed DMF and dimethylamine [47,48], and consistent with the 13C NMR results (Fig. 2). On the other hand, LPT450 exhibited a peak at 400.1 eV, which is assigned to the interstitial nitrogen dopant in TiO2 lattices, indicating the presence of the TiON bond, that is, the concomitant formation of Vo [32,33] (note that the peak due to the substitutional nitrogen dopant in TiO2 often appears at around 396 eV [33]). The amount of doped N in LPT-450 was estimated to be 0.4 atomic%. As shown in the Ti 2p-region XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b), LPT-450 exhibited two peaks at 458.8 and 464.5 eV due to the presence of Ti4+ in the TiO2 lattices. No obvious peaks due to Ti3+ were observed (around 457.1 eV) [49]. LPT shows a Ti 2p-region spectrum similar to that for LPT-450; however, the two peaks in the former were observed in a significantly lower binding energy region than those in the latter. This is explained by the fact that H2Ti2O5·nH2O (K2Ti2O5) is composed of uniquely fivecoordinated Ti atoms, unlike most forms of titania, including anatase, which is composed of sixcoordinated Ti atoms [50,51]. Likewise, LPT-450 and LPT exhibited similar O 1s-region spectra (Fig. 3c); they have peaks at around 530 eV with a shoulder peak at around 532 eV, which are assigned to lattice O and surface OH in TiO2, respectively. We further performed EPR analysis to confirm the introduction of Vo and investigate the kinds of Vo in LPT-450 (Fig. 4 ). In contrast to P25 composed of anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles with a relatively high crystallinity [52,53], LPT-450 gave a strong EPR signal at g = 2.001, which is a characteristic feature of Vo. The signal at g = 1.97, belonging to Ti3+ did not appear, which is consistent with the above XPS results. The creation of Vo is normally associated with trapped electrons at Vo sites, forming color centers (called F-centers). The color centers in TiO2 are classified as F-centers (electron pair trapped in Vo, Eq. 1), F+-centers (a single electron trapped in Vo, Eq. 2), and F++centers (electron pair deficient Vo or anion vacancy, Eq. 3) [54]. (1) Vo + 2e− → F (2) Vo + e− → F+ (3) Vo + 0e− → F++ In the case of LPT-450, the shape and sharp EPR signal with g = 2.001 can be assigned to F+-centers (an electron trapped in Vo) [21,55]. Importantly, F+-center-type Vo in TiO2 was reported to play an important role in enhancing solar (UV-induced) photocatalytic activity [55]. Thus, we expect LPT-450 to show high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution via water splitting. Solid state 1H MAS NMR analysis was conducted to further confirm the presence of Vo in LPT-450. As shown in Fig. S3, LPT-450 has significantly more intense peak at 1.7 ppm, assigned to terminal hydroxyl groups [56,57], than P25. It was reported that the presence of terminal hydroxyl groups in anatase was correlated with Vo formation in the lattice [58]."
7,Optical properties,"3.2 Optical properties Generally, doping with non-metal elements, including N, and introduction of Vo, alters the electronic properties of TiO2. We therefore evaluated the electronic band structure of LPT-450 using diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy and valence band (VB) XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 5 a, LPT-450 shows significant visible light absorption up to 500 nm, which is caused by the presence of the N dopant and Vo. From the Tauc plot (Fig. 5b) obtained from the UV–vis result, the bandgap energy of LPT-450 was calculated to be 3.08 eV, which is consistent with the typical and commonly reported bandgap value of anatase (3.1–3.2 eV). The VB XPS spectrum of LPT-450 (Fig. 5c) revealed the VB peak to be located at 2.69 eV. By combining the above results, the energy diagram of LPT-450 can be obtained as depicted in Fig. 5d. The bandgap of LPT-450 (3.08 eV) is not narrow enough to make it active under visible light (λ > 400 nm, see below). However, the introduced Vo, which has been shown to donate electrons in TiO2 [59], can improve charge transport in LPT-450 and shift the Fermi level toward the CB, enhancing the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron and hole [35,60,61]. Furthermore, due to the two-dimensional nature of anatase in LPT-450, the introduced Vo may locate predominantly on the surface rather than in the bulk, where it can trap photogenerated electrons and hold back charge recombination [36,38]. To confirm the above scenario, we further performed a PL analysis of LPT-450. P25 is mainly composed of anatase nanoparticles (∼80 %) while the co-existence of rutile nanoparticles is thought to enhance the charge separation (and photocatalytic) efficiency via the transfer of photoexcited electrons at the rutile and anatase interfaces [52,62]. As shown in Fig. 5e, even P25 exhibited PL peaks (e.g., a peak at around 400 nm due to the bandgap transition). Remarkably, LPT-450 showed considerably lower PL peaks than did P25, suggesting that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was considerably suppressed in LPT-450. For this reason too, we can expect high solar photocatalytic activity on the part of LPT-450."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The solar photocatalytic activity of LPT-450 was evaluated via H2 production from water containing methanol as a sacrificial agent under irradiation with a solar simulator (λ > 300 nm, 1 SUN) without using any co-catalyst. Fig. 6 a and b respectively show time-course H2 evolution profiles and the rate of H2 evolution on different materials. As expected, LPT-450 showed excellent photocatalytic activity that was 33 times higher than that of P25, a benchmark TiO2. The H2 evolution rate of LPT-450 was 1035 μmole h–1 g–1, which is considerably higher than that obtained by many conventional co-catalyst-free defective TiO2 types (∼300 μmole h–1 g–1, Table S1) [21]. To evaluate the solar photocatalytic activity of LPT-450 more objectively, the AQY was obtained. The AQY of LPT-450 was 16 % at 365 nm, which is comparable to that of Pt-modified P25 (28 % at 365 nm) and a co-catalyst-free defective TiO2 with an exceptionally high activity (44 % at 365 nm) under similar reaction conditions [20]. LPT-450 can be synthesized using a safer and easier method than for conventional defective TiO2. We can therefore claim that the state-ofthe-art-level co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was achieved using more economically benign defective TiO2. LPT was inactive in the present photocatalytic reaction. A control sample (Solv-P25-450), prepared by the solvothermal treatment of P25 with DMF (and IPA) followed by calcination at 450 °C, also showed activity that was almost identical to that of P25. This is explained by the fact that P25 was not able to adsorb N precursors effectively for it to be doped in the lattice (Fig. 2). Our results show the advantages of the present material design for LPT-450. The stability of the LPT-450 photocatalyst was further investigated for hydrogen evolution from water containing methanol under solar simulator irradiation (Fig. 6c). After four cycles, LPT450 provided stable photocatalytic hydrogen activity with no apparent degradation of the original activity. Furthermore, LPT-450 showed the similar activity and stability even when the irradiation time was largely extended (Fig. S4). These results show the durability of the material for solar photocatalytic hydrogen production. To obtain a clearer insight into the mechanism of solar photocatalysis on LPT-450, we investigated the action spectrum in H2 evolution on LPT-450 from water containing methanol (Fig. 6d). In contrast to the UV light region (< 400 nm), the AQY on LPT-450 for the reaction did not correlate with the photoabsorption of LPT-450 in the visible light region (> 400 nm). This result indicates the negligible visible light response of LPT-450 and provides evidence of the abovementioned photocatalytic mechanism in which the induced Vo mediated by N doping plays a dominant role in enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency. As described above (Fig. 1c), LPT-450 has a larger BET surface area (99.4 m2 g–1) and significantly greater mesoporosity than conventional nanoparticulate TiO2 such as P25 (50 m2 g– 1). Its morphological nature (hierarchical mesoporous sphere), in addition to its electronic structure, may therefore play an important role in the high co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic activity of LPT-450. Finally, we investigated the effect of the calcination temperature of LPT on the structure and photocatalytic performance of the products. As shown in Fig. S5 a–c, LPT-550 and LPT-650 were composed of hierarchical anatase assemblies like LPT-450 while LPT-750 was composed of rutile particles. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic H2 production activity of LPT-450 was considerably higher than that of others (Fig. S6 a). Lower-temperature calcination of LPT might suppress the complete removal of the introduced organic molecules (Fig. S1), leading to effective N doping and concomitant Vo formation in the calcined product and then attain its higher charge separation efficiency (Fig. S6 b)."
9,Conclusion,"We have reported a new, readily achieved, and safe strategy for synthesizing oxygen-defective TiO2 that shows efficient co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic hydrogen production activity from water. A layered titanate (H2Ti2O5·nH2O) nanosheet mesoporous assembly, having an N source (N,N-dimethyl formamide) as its synthesis solvent in the structure, was calcined, leading to topochemical conversion to mesoporous assemblies of nanosheets of anatase nanoparticles with an N dopant and concomitantly-introduced oxygen vacancies. The synthesized material exhibited, under solar light irradiation, excellent photocatalytic activity that is considerably higher than that of many conventional types of co-catalyst-free defective TiO2. This high activity is mainly ascribed to nitrogen doping-induced oxygen vacancies that are capable of facilitating charge separation. Since a wide variety of TiO2 types and titanates with different structures and morphologies are available, we anticipate that the synthetic strategy presented in this work can be extended to create more TiO2 and titanate-based co-catalyst-free photocatalysts that show enhanced performance."
