0,Introduction,"Environmental concerns about reducing greenhouse gases have stimulated the search for clean energy sources. Biologically derived organic materials and residues currently constitute a large source of waste biomass [1]. Use of these biomass-rich resources for bioenergy and related bioproducts could contribute to the displacement of fossil fuels as our primary energy source and could reduce GHG emissions. Hydrogen (H2) is a clean bioenergy substitute for fossil fuels, producing water as its only by-product when it burns. The higher heating value of hydrogen is 3042 cals m - 3 , the highest of all known fuels [2,3]. Currently 90% of H2 is being produced from methane reformation or electrolysis of water and contributes to only 3% total energy consumption. These processes are both energy intensive and not environment-friendly [2]. Research on biological H2 production has been carried out for over a quarter century [4] and a wide variety of biological H2-production processes have been investigated, including direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo-fermentations and dark fermentation. Anaerobic dark-fermentation systems offer the best potential for practical application [3]. Some basic advantages over other processes include: (i) better process economy for lower energy requirements, (ii) process simplicity, (iii) higher rates of H2 production, and (iv) utilization of low-value waste as raw materials [3,5,6]. Significant amounts of H2 may be produced from cellulosic feedstocks (straw, wood chips, grass residue, paper waste, saw dust, etc.) using conventional anaerobic digester technology and natural consortia under conditions that favor H2-producing acetogenic bacteria and inhibit methane-producing bacteria [7,8]. However, depending on the pathways used by the organisms within the consortium, hydrogen yields may be variable [4,5]. Clostridium thermocellum is a gram-positive, acetogenic, thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium that degrades cellulose and carries out mixed product fermentation, synthesizing acetate, H2 and CO2, as well as lactate and ethanol under different growth conditions [9–15]. C. thermocellum expresses a suite of cellulolytic enzymes that are exported from the cell and assembled into a complex structure on the surface of the cell called a “cellulosome” (reviewed by Lynd et al. [34] and Demain et al. [16]. The bacteria attach to cellulose particles via the cellulosome, and the enzymes within the cellulosome efficiently degrade the cellulose to glucose and cellulodextrans, which are transported into the cells for metabolism. Of all known cellulose degrading microorganisms, C. thermocellum displays the highest rate of cellulose degradation [14,15]. Because of its high rate of cellulose degradation and propensity to synthesize H2, carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetate, C. thermocellum offers the potential for producing H2 from cellulosic waste biomass. The optimal growth temperature of C. thermocellum, 60 ∘ C , precludes the growth of many other microorganisms (contaminants), and allows for C. thermocellum-enriched cultures to be maintained even when non-sterile substrates are used. This also eliminates the need for sterilization of the incoming biomass, which would otherwise be required for pure-culture fermentation process [16], and because of the decreased solubility of gases at higher temperatures (Henry's law), the higher growth temperature facilitates more efficient removal of product gases such as H2 and CO2. In this paper, we present data from our preliminary investigations of H2 production by C. thermocellum 27405 cultured on cellulosic substrates and on cellobiose (a major soluble product of cellulose hydrolysis). The experiments presented allowed us to compare the degradation of purified cellulose fibers to the degradation of wood fibers after they had been subjected to a delignification process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sources of chemicals and substrates,"2.1 Sources of chemicals and substrates All chemicals and reagents for media and substrates were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The delignified wood fiber (DLW) used in these experiments was provided by Lignol Innovations Inc., Vancouver, BC."
3,Microorganism and media,"2.2 Microorganism and media C. thermocellum 27405 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was employed for all growth experiments. Fresh cultures were maintained by routinely transferring 10% (v/v) inocula into fresh 1191 media (composition provided by ATCC) containing 1– 2 g l - 1 cellulose or cellobiose. This complex medium contained (per liter of distilled deionized water): KH2PO4, 1.5g; Na2HPO4 · 12H2O, 4.2g; NH4Cl, 0.5g; MgCl2 · 6H2O, 0.18g; yeast extract (BD 212750), 2.0g; 0.25 mg ml - 1 Resazurin, 1.0ml; vitamin solution, 0.50ml; mineral solution, 1ml. Deaerated sodium sulphide (reducing solution) was prepared under nitrogen using sodium sulphide crystals in distilled water to a final concentration of 200mM, and was added to a final concentration of 2mM after the medium was made oxygen free. Vitamin solution contained the following (per 1000ml): biotin, 20mg; P-aminobenzoic acid, 50mg; folic acid, 20mg; nicotinic acid, 50mg; thiamine, 50mg; riboflavin, 50mg; lipoic acid (thioctic acid), 50mg; cyanocobalamin, 10mg. Mineral solution contained (grams per litre): trisodium nitrilacetate 20.2; FeCl3 · 6H2O, 2.1; CoCl2 · 6H2O, 2.0; MnCl2 · 4H2O, 1.0; ZnCl2, 1.0; NiCl2 · 6H2O, 1.0; CaCl2 · 2H2O, 0.5; CuSO4 · 2H2O, 0.5; Na2MoO4 · 2H2O, 0.5."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Batch experiments were designed with three different initial concentrations of four substrates, cellobiose (CB), α -cellulose ( α C), shredded Whatman paper no. 1 (WP), and DLW. Balch tubes (Bellco Glass Co.) with a working volume of 26ml were used as reactors for all batch tests. Substrates were added to a concentration of 0.1, 1.1 and 4.5 g l - 1 representing low, medium and high concentrations, respectively. All tubes containing 10ml of 1191 medium and cellulosic substrates were air sealed with butyl rubber stopper and aluminum seals. Each tube was reduced with 0.1ml of reducing solution after being gassed and degassed (1:4min) four times with 100% nitrogen according to the protocol described in Daniels et al. [17]. Tubes were autoclaved and then, when used as substrate, filter sterilized cellobiose solution (anaerobic) was added to specific batch (containing only 1191) to achieve the desired concentrations. All batches were inoculated from freshly growing cultures in serum bottles (125ml) at exponential phase. The inoculum for the cellobiose tubes was grown on 1 g l - 1 cellobiose, while the inoculum for the cellulosic biomass tubes was grown on 5 g l - 1 α -cellulose. The volume of inoculum used was 10% of the culture medium volume, which corresponded to a dry weight equivalent of approximately 250 mg l - 1 . Low, medium and high substrate concentration batches were incubated for 3, 8 and 11 days, respectively, to ensure growth until stationary phase. Three replicates of each experimental end point were taken."
5,Analytical procedures,"2.4 Analytical procedures Product gas composition (H2 and CO2) was measured using gas chromatographs (Gow Mac model-580) with thermal conductivity detectors. The column used for hydrogen quantification was a stainless steel 1 8 in × 8 ft column packed with molecular sieve 5A (60/80 mesh) with nitrogen as carrier gas. For CO2 analysis, a stainless steel 1 4 in × 8 ft column packed with porapak Q column was used with helium as carrier gas. All gas measurements were corrected by calculating their solubility in water [18] and carryover amounts with inocula. Amount of CO2 in solution as bicarbonate was taken into account for correction using the equilibrium constants and the final pH. Cellobiose and glucose were measured by liquid chromatography techniques using an anion-exchange CarboPac-PA1 analytical column ( 4 × 250 mm ), and an IonPac AS11-HC anion-exchange column (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to measure acetate, lactate, formate, and pyruvate. For ethanol quantification a GC packed column AT-1000, 6 ft × 1 8 in OD, 15% H3PO4 on 100/120, Chromosorb W-AW (Alltech associates) was employed. All end-product measurements reported were corrected for end product carried over with the inoculum. Yields of H2 ( Y H 2 ) were expressed as moles of H2 produced per mole of glucose equivalents converted to organic end products. Yields of ethanol and organic acids were also expressed as moles per mole of glucose equivalents converted to end products. The glucose was calculated on the basis of the amount of measured end products. Since each ethanol, acetate, and lactate are derived from a pyruvate molecule and glycolysis of one glucose generates two pyruvates, the amount of glucose converted to fermentation end products was calculated as the sum of moles of ethanol, acetate, lactate, and pyruvate obtained divided by 2."
6,Results,
7,Gas production,"3.1 Gas production Fig. 1 displays the total H2 and CO2 produced from cellobiose and three cellulosic substrates. Cellulosic substrates produced similar to somewhat higher amounts of H2 and CO2 than cellobiose in cultures with 0.1 and 1.1 g l - 1 substrates. At substrate concentrations of 4.5 g l - 1 , cellobiose and DLW produced similar amounts of H2, while α -cellulose and filter paper produced less H2."
8,Gas ratios,"3.2 Gas ratios Ratios of H2/CO2 calculated using the measured gas quantities for different substrates, are presented in Table 1 . H2/CO2 ratios varied from 0.97 to 1.31 for all substrate concentrations, except for 0.1 g l - 1 cellobiose, where the H2/CO2 ratio was 0.88. Moreover, H2 and CO2 amounts estimated on the basis of fermentation end products were similar for all four substrates."
9,Acids and alcohol production,"3.3 Acids and alcohol production Acetate and ethanol were major end products of fermentation by C. thermocellum for all substrates (Fig. 2 ). Formate synthesis was also observed in all the cultures. For the various cellulosic substrates used, formate constituted between 4% and 10% of fermentation products, but up to 20% at the higher concentrations of cellobiose. The proportion of acetate produced as molar fraction of the total end products measured decreased by 25–30% as substrate concentrations changed from 0.1 to 4.5 g l - 1 . Lactate production was undetectable at 0.1 g l - 1 substrate, but increased at higher initial substrate concentrations. High concentrations of lactate coincided with lower final pH values, and were associated with lower yields of H2 observed in cultures with 1.1 or 4.5 g l - 1 filter paper, and in cultures with 4.5 g l - 1 α -cellulose (Fig. 1). At 4.5 g l - 1 concentrations, lactate constituted almost 37% of total moles of products, with a 2–3% contribution from extracellular pyruvate (see Table 2 )."
10,Effect of substrate concentrations on H2 yields,"3.4 Effect of substrate concentrations on H2 yields Fig. 3 illustrates the differences in yields of H2 under different substrate concentrations for the various cellulosic substrates. The amount of glucose equivalents consumed to determine the yields were calculated on the basis of the various end products formed, and does not take into account the carbon used for biomass formation. In general, yields of H2 on cellulosic substrates were similar to cellobiose cultures containing 1.1 or 4.5 g l - 1 of substrate, but were somewhat higher at the lowest substrate concentration. Hydrogen yields were lower at high concentrations of cellulosic substrates and cellobiose, where low H2 yields may be correlated with high lactate production. Indeed, when cellulosic substrates were used, the cultures with the highest lactate levels had the lowest H2 yields and lowest pH. Cellobiose cultures appear not to follow this relationship, this may correlate with their significantly enhanced formate production. While hydrogen yields were similar for all three cellulosic substrates tested, they reached the highest value of all carbon sources on DLW, where an average final yield of 1.60 ± 0.67 mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose equivalent was obtained, when taking into account all three substrate concentrations tested. Table 2 compares amounts of fermentation products from cultures containing cellobiose or DLW for the three different initial substrate concentrations. Both substrates had similar ethanol/acetate ratios and total H2-production levels. Despite increased initial substrate concentrations, the ethanol/acetate ratios were similar (approximately a 3:4 ratio). Formate was observed under all conditions tested, with increased amounts produced as the substrate amount increased. Lactate levels, which represented less than 10% of the total moles of end products at the end of the experiment in cultures containing low or medium substrate concentrations, rose to between 23% (cellobiose) and 34% (DLW) when high concentrations of substrates were present. Extracellular pyruvate production, detected at the 4.5 g l - 1 substrate concentration, is consistent with the use of pyruvate as a carbon overflow product. It should also be noted that, while the 0.1 and 1.1 g l - 1 batch cultures consumed all the substrate provided, a significant residual amount of soluble glucose remained in the 4.5 g l - 1 cultures, indicating that cell growth did not stop because of carbon limitation, but rather, that the cells had carbon excess throughout growth. For all the 4.5 g l - 1 cellulosic cultures, fibers were still visible when the cultures were terminated for analyses."
11,Discussion,"Our data indicate that C. thermocellum produced as much or more H2 and fermentation end products when cultured on cellulosic substrates than when cultured on cellobiose. Final H2 yields averaged 1.60 ± 0.67 mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose in cultures containing DLW, compared to the average of H2 yields for the cellobiose cultures at all three substrate concentrations, 1.50 ± 0.67 mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose. This value is comparable with many previous studies. Yields of 1.7–1.9mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose were achieved with pure sucrose [19] through nitrogen sparging. Batch fermentation of starch by Clostridium beijerinckii AM21B resulted in H2 yields of 1.3– 2.0 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose [20], and a mixed microflora in sludge compost produced yields as high as 2.4mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose [21]. Both H2 (as a proportion of all electron sinks) and acetate (as a proportion of all carbon end products) decreased in carbon-excess cultures ( 4.5 g l - 1 of substrate). The decreases in proportion of acetate and ethanol corresponded to an increase in the proportion of lactate, when end-point measurements from cultures containing low, medium, or high substrate concentrations were compared. Relative to acetate, the most significant change in end-product proportion was observed with lactate. Extracellular pyruvate production was evidence of overflow metabolism caused by inhibition of carbon flow toward acetate and ethanol and induction of the pathway to lactate. High concentrations of lactate were generally observed in cultures where the pH dropped below 6.8 and total H2 accumulation was highest. Similarly, residual soluble sugars, coupled with lower pH, appearance of pyruvate and higher yields of lactate relative to other end products were also observed at the end of growth in batch cultures of Clostridium cellulolyticum under carbon-excess conditions [22], where carbon is no longer the growth limiting nutrient. Formate was detected consistently among the fermentation end products. This was a surprising observation, but not totally unexpected as the C. thermocellum genome (http://genome.ornl.gov/microbial/cthe) contains genes pfl and fnr, respectively encoding pyruvate–formate–lyase (PFL) and PFL-activating protein [23–25]. A gene corresponding to adhE, which encodes alcohol dehydrogenase E and is known to negatively regulate PFL expression in E. coli [26,27] and Streptococcus bovis [28,29], is also present in C. thermocellum, and may modulate the use of PFL relative to pyruvate–ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The data for low added substrate ( 0.1 g l - 1 ) in Fig. 2 and Table 2 indicate that the amount of carbon recovered in the fermentation end products exceed somewhat the amount of glucose equivalents added to the medium. The added yeast extract in the medium is not expected to have had an impact on the production of hydrogen or fermentation end products, since C. thermocellum is a specialist organism with a limited range of fermentable substrates [16]. Indeed, Johnson et al. [30] demonstrated that the addition of 6 g l - 1 of yeast extract had no impact on biomass production or levels of fermentative end products compared to a minimal medium where the yeast extract was replaced by vitamins. While the data presented were corrected for end products being transferred with the inoculum to the various batch cultures, the substrate carried over with the inoculum was not, and may account for the extra amounts of end products detected at the lowest level of added substrate. In our experiments, the cultures were not stirred, and H2 gas bubbles may have been trapped on or under insoluble cellulosic substrates, especially in cultures containing DLWs. Localized high concentrations of H2 in these cultures, especially in cultures with high substrate concentrations, may have provided unfavorable thermodynamic conditions, shifting the flow of carbon away from acetate (and H2) or ethanol to lactate synthesis. These observations are consistent with previous studies [31,32]. In high substrate concentration cultures, where most lactate was observed, the H2 partial pressure ranged between 20 and 24 kPa (measured at 19 ∘ C ). At 60 ∘ C , however, the partial pressures were over 60 kPa . Similarly, partial pressures of 10 to 20 kPa initiated a metabolic shift away from H2 production and towards lactate in Caldicellulosiruptor saccharlolyticus grown at 70 ∘ C , with cessation of hydrogen production above 56 kPa hydrogen [33]. Therefore, localized high H2 concentrations could have been responsible for inhibiting H2 synthesis in cultures containing high substrate concentrations. This may also explain the higher H2/CO2 ratios, and lower lactate to acetate ratio obtained in cultures containing soluble cellobiose compared with the fibrous DLWs in high substrate conditions."
12,Conclusions,"We observed H2 production by C. thermocellum 27405 cultured on three insoluble cellulosic substrates, as well as on cellobiose. As ligno-cellulosic biomass comprises a huge portion of our organic waste, fermentation by C. thermocellum offers potentials for converting cellulosic waste materials such as DLW to H2 gas. Indeed, its H2 production from DLW was similar or better than that observed for pure cellulose substrates ( α -cellulose, Whatman paper) or cellobiose. Batch fermentations established that C. thermocellum 27405 may be useful for conversion of cellulosic biomass to H2, even under non-optimized culture conditions. Lactate was a significant carbon and electron drain in the cultures with the highest H2 concentrations. Formate was an unexpected additional drain under all the growth conditions tested. Nevertheless, sustainable H2 production from cellulosic biomass by C. thermocellum may be possible if bioreactor conditions are maintained at near neutral pH (approx. 7.0) and gas products (H2 and CO2) are removed rapidly to maintain low H2 partial pressure."
