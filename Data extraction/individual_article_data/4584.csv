0,Introduction,"Selective photo-oxidation of primary aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes is a prominent chemical transformation in synthesis chemistry. This is due to carbonyl groups which are the result of the first photo-oxidation stage of the wide range of organic compounds. Aldehydes derivatives are also useful in the stuffing, confectionery, beverage industries and used as precursors for many drugs [1]. Usually, for these types of transformations, titanium dioxide is one of the best practical and useful photo-catalyst. It has different benefits such as high efficiency, availability, nontoxicity, high chemical stability and suitable redox potential of the band gap; Degussa P25 (a mixture of rutile and anatase) as a commercial TiO2 has attracted a great deal of attention [2]. As the light source, mercury lamps, UV lamps and sunlight have been successfully used [3]. Recently, visible light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been used as an attractive means to initiate photo-catalytic reactions. Using LED as a visible light source has many advantages such as low cost, readily available, high photon efficiency, needing low voltages of electricity and power stability during long time operation [4–6]. In the direction of green chemistry, recently, researchers have interested in using the combination of LED as visible light irradiation source and semiconductors (TiO2-P25) as photo-catalysts [2]. In 2014, Zand et al. reported photo-reduction of nitro-aromatic compounds into corresponding anilines using TiO2 Degussa P25 under blue LED irradiation. They showed that TiO2-P25 photo-catalyst can be activated under high intensity of blue LED lamps [7]. Zhao and co-workers reported a procedure for aerobic photo-oxidation of alcohols by using TiO2/TEMPO/alizarin red catalyst. Also, they used features associated with dye-sensitized TiO2 for these types of oxidations [8]. On the other hand, Imamura and co-workers studied the reduction of nitrobenzene and oxidation of 2-propanol in the presence of O2 by using redox balance (RB) as an indicator. It could be deduced from results, after complete reduction of nitrobenzene, even excessive photo-irradiation was not helpful for re-oxidation of aniline. Furthermore, chemoselectivity was assessed and realized only nitro groups reduced in the existence of other reducible groups such as chloro- or bromo- nitrobenzenes [9]. Also the photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols conducted by purging O2 gas under UV-light and blue LED lamp irradiation by Higashimoto et al. It was the first report of performing such reactions under visible light irradiation which was resulted in high conversion and high selectivity on TiO2 [10]. The coupling of two semiconductors with different band gap could enhance the visible light activity because the charge separation and the energy range of photo-excitation could be increased [11]. A mixture of CdS-TiO2 was also used by Higashimoto for one-pot synthesis of imine from benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene under visible-light irradiation. They showed that loading CdS on TiO2 provides higher photo-catalytic activity [12]. The accelerating effect of adding external Bronsted acids on photochemical yields has been investigated by Zhao in recent years [13]. Kozlov et al. investigated the photo-catalytic activity of TiO2 in the presence of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide. Their results showed a direct relation between photo-catalytic activity and sulfuric acid concentration while it has a reverse relation with NaOH’s concentration. Indeed, sulfuric acid improved the adsorption constants of the reagents, intermediates and products on the surface of TiO2. In fact, by increasing acidic sites on the catalyst surface, photo-catalytic activity increased by 20–30% [14]. Furthermore, an extensive progress has been observed toward the surface modification of TiO2 with both inorganic and organic acids significantly accelerated the conversion of the alcohol. As expected, acceleration was observed in the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol on TiO2 when acid was directly added to the reaction mixture [15]. However, these physically adsorbed acids which react as homogeneous catalysts will cause the environmental difficulties such as difficult separation. Furthermore, homogeneous acid catalysts have other disadvantages such as using specialized reaction equipment, increasing operational difficulties, high energy consumption and the formation of large amounts of waste products [16–21]. Due to these problems, heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts by immobilization of sulfonic acid on the surface of various solid supports has produced the heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. These solid acids are appropriate for economically and environmentally friendly because they have some advantages such as reusability of catalyst, mild reaction conditions, using less toxicity, readily available precursors [22–32]. Solid acids, which were introduced by zolfigol, have played a key role in the catalyzing. He developed a reaction between silica gel and chlorosulfonic acid, in which sulfuric acid was immobilized on the surface of silica gel by a covalent bond. Applying silica sulfuric acid as a solid acid support could be great proton source, which was considered for implementation reactions under heterogeneous condition [33]. Amoozadeh research group, have done great efforts on the surface modification of nano-catalysts, especially synthesis of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts for organic reactions. Nano-titania sulfonic acid (n-TSA) was reported by the reaction of Nano-TiO2 with chloro-sulfonic acid, which represented the first examples of new solid acid nano-catalysts [34]. In further researches, they introduced a number of new heterogeneous solid acid Nano-catalysts such as Nano-Fe3O4@TDI@TiO2 [35], Nano-WO3-supported sulfonic acid (n-WO3-SO3H) [36], Nano-zirconia-supported sulfonic acid (n-ZrO2-SO3H) [37] and TiO2-coated magnetite nanoparticle-supported sulfonic acid (nano-Fe3O4–TiO2–SO3H) [38]. All these heterogeneous solid acid catalysts were prepared for the first time by covalent grafting of sulfonic acid on the surface of various solid supports and they were employed as a solid acid in the synthesis of organic reactions. Several advantages have been reported for these catalysts such as good stability, high reusability, mild reaction conditions, environmentally benign conditions, easy separation and operational simplicity [39–42]. Based on the above, we decided to prepare the TiO2-P25-SO3H as a new heterogeneous solid acid catalyst and use it in the photo-catalyst reaction for the first time. This method provides both effects (acceleration of adding acid and green chemistry) for the photo-oxidation of alcohols. In this context, TiO2-P25-SO3H catalyst displayed a high potential toward the facile oxidation of aromatic alcohols using blue LED irradiation. The environmentally friendly green chemical procedures showed by using this new photo-catalyst and the LED light irradiation. The purpose of the present work is designing a selective method for photo-oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones by using the ‘TiO2-P25-SO3H’ as a new powerful photo-catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and instruments,"2.1 Materials and instruments All chemicals were purchased from the Merck and Aldrich chemical companies with no need for further purification. TiO2-P25 (ca. 70% anatase, 30% rutile; BET area ca. 50 ± 15 m2 g−1) powder was kindly supplied by Degussa Co. Progress of reactions was assayed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on commercial plates coated with silica gel 60 F254. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was implemented on a Shimadzu FT-IR 8400 equipment using KBr pressed powder plates in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed by applying a Du Pont 2000 thermal analysis apparatus under air atmosphere heated from 0 °C to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for the TiO2-P25-SO3H powder sample were conducted on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) using Cu-Kα radiation of wavelength 1.54° A. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the photo-catalyst were reached by a Mira 3-XMU scanning electron microscope. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Model ARL PERFOMIR’X) was used for the elemental analysis. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, Model Sinco S4100, Korea) was used for determination of the optical band gap (Eg) of TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a BAL-TEC SCD 005 scanning electron microscope instrument operating at 10 kV. TiO2-P25-SO3H was fixed on a double sided adhesive carbon disk and sputter-coated with a thin layer of gold to avoid sample charging problems."
3,Preparation of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H,"2.2 Preparation of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H TiO2-P25-SO3H was easily prepared by using of a suction flask that was equipped with a constant-pressure dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube for conducting HCl gas over an adsorbing solution (i.e., water) and this flask charged with the TiO2-P25 (crystalline with anatase/rutile) (4 g) in dry CH2Cl2 (20 mL). Then the mixture was stirred slowly in an ice bath and chlorosulfonic acid (1 ml, 15 mmol) was added drop-wisely over a period of 30 min at room temperature while HCl gas evolved from the reaction vessel. Stirring of the mixture was continued until HCl evolution was seized. After the addition was completed, shaking of the mixture was continued for 30 min A white powder of nano-TiO2-P25 supported sulfonic acid was obtained. Then, the solid powder was washed with ethanol (10 mL) and dried at 70 °C. The prepared TiO2-P25-SO3H was dried at 120 °C for 6 h."
4,Photo-catalytic conversion experiments,"2.3 Photo-catalytic conversion experiments The photo-activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H was evaluated by photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation. The photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol tests were conducted in a 15 mL Pyrex glass equipped with a water circulating jacket to control the temperature of reactions. Photo-reactor was fixed at room temperature during the experiments. Artificial irradiation into Pyrex reactor was provided via 4 × 3 W blue light emitting diode lamps as the visible light source. TiO2-P25-SO3H (0.05 g) was suspended in 5 mL acetonitrile, then benzyl alcohol (150 μmol) and nitrobenzene (50 μmol) as an oxidant to enhance the photo-catalytic oxidation activity, was added. Furthermore, in each experiment, the mixture was magnetically stirred in the dark condition to prove the requirement of light irradiation for product formation. In order to ensure the photo-activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H in visible light wavelengths, the UV–vis adsorption spectra of photo-catalyst and emission spectrum of blue LED were investigated. Due to literature, the absorbance spectrum of TiO2-P25 overlaps with a part of emission spectrum corresponding to blue LED, indicating the photo-activity of TiO2-P25 under blue LED irradiation [7]. The absorbance spectrum of TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H was compared in Fig. 1 . The range of overlap region for TiO2-P25-SO3H has been more extended than TiO2-P25. It means the photo-activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H in visible wavelengths has been improved. Scheme 1 shows the expected stoichiometry of photo-catalytic formation of benzaldehyde and aniline via oxidation of benzyl alcohol and reduction of nitrobenzene. Photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and photo-reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline need two holes and six electrons, respectively. The atom efficiency (AE) [43] of photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under present condition is 71.14% as could be seen in Eq. (1). The photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol would be more noteworthy if the reduction process led to formation of valuable compounds. The appropriate rate of AE indicates that the negative electrons and positive holes are consumed for production of valuable compounds. According to this viewpoint, the photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using nitrobenzene is “green”.

5,Result and discussion,"We have designed, prepared and characterized nano-titania supported sulfonic acid as a novel class of nano photo-catalyst (Scheme 2 ). This novel photo-catalyst was characterized via FT-IR spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)."
6,Characterization of TiO2-P25-SO3H,"3.1 Characterization of TiO2-P25-SO3H Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is a significant technique for identification of the functionalization of nanoparticles. So FT-IR spectra of the nano-TiO2-P25 and nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H were analyzed (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Due to the reported IR spectra for –SO3H, the FT-IR spectrum of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H exhibiting the presence of sulfonic acid functional group [44]. In order to assess the percentage of the chemisorbed sulfonic acid group on the surface of nano-TiO2-P25, TGA was applied. The thermogravimetric analysis comparison of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H with nano-TiO2-P25 in the temperature range of 0–800 °C was accomplished (Fig. S2). TGA curves demonstrate two and three stages of weight loss, for TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H respectively, which has a reasonable coordination with literature [44–45]. On the basis of TGA results, it can be concluded that nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H has a high thermal stability confirming that it can be safely used in organic reactions with high temperature. X-ray powder diffraction as is a noteworthy analytical technique, which was used for evaluating the phase purity and crystal structure of photo-catalyst. The XRD patterns of nano-TiO2-P25 before and after modification were compared (see details in Supplementary Fig. S3). In accordance to the Debye-Scherrer equation, the average crystalline sizes of the nano-TiO2 were approximate to be around 32 nm from XRD pattern. Similar peak intensities of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H and nano-TiO2-P25 indicating the stability of the crystalline phase of nano-TiO2-P25 during surface sulfonate-modification. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) as a helpful analytical technique was operated for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of nanoparticles. The EDX analysis demonstrates the existence of oxygen and sulfur in addition to titanium in the nano photo-catalyst, which approves the presence of SO3H on nano-TiO2-P25 (Fig. S4). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was applied for measuring SO3 weight percent in synthesized nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H. In accordance to XRF results, the amount of SO3 on the surface of photo-catalyst was weight percent of 5.85, confirmed that immobilization of SO3H on TiO2-P25 was carried out accurately. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was employed to study the surface morphology and understand the particle shape and size distribution features of nanoparticles. It can be deduced from the SEM images of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H that the average particle size of the spherical nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H powder is about 25–45 nm which reveals that the photo-catalyst is in nano size (Fig. S5). 3.1.1 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) The band gap energies of TiO2-P25 and modified sulfonated photo-catalyst are compared by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Fig. 2 ). As indicated in Fig. 2, the band gap energies of these photo-catalysts, (TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H) are 3.1 eV and 2.6 eV respectively. So, it is evident that a considerable decrease on band gap energy and red shift take place by immobilizing the SO3H groups on the surface of TiO2-P25. Therefore, photo-activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H would increase along visible wavelength. The VB and CB potential edges of TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H are calculated according to the literature [46,47] (Eqs. (2), (3)). (2) ECB = X − Ee − 0.5 Eg (3) EVB = ECB + Eg ECB and EVB are the conduction and valence band edge potentials of a semiconductor, respectively. Electronegativity value of the semiconductor is shown by X, which is the geometric mean of the electronegativities of constituent atoms. The energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale is Ee (∼45 eV). The band gap energy of the semiconductor compound is expressed by Eg. Based on above equations, ECB potentials of TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H are calculated −0.62 eV and + 0.42 eV respectively. Also, based on the same calculations, EVB potentials of TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25-SO3H are calculated + 2.48 eV and + 3.02 eV respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . As indicated in the literature and mentioned above, there is a reverse relation between the EVB amount and the oxidizing ability of photo-catalyst. So TiO2-P25-SO3H is more powerful for photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation. In fact, the presence of covalently grafted -SO3H groups on the surface of TiO2-P25 is at the origin of this enormous success."
7,Evaluation of photo-catalytic activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H for the photo-oxidation of alcohols,"3.2 Evaluation of photo-catalytic activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H for the photo-oxidation of alcohols As photo-oxidation has raised a wide attention in the realm of functional group interconversions in synthetic organic chemistry, we have decided to investigate the applicability of nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H as a novel heterogeneous photo-catalyst in the photo-oxidation of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes. For this purpose, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of nitrobenzene as an oxidant under blue LED irradiation as a model reaction was explored to establish the possibility of the method and optimizing the reaction conditions. The obtained results are list in Table 1 , which shows the condition reaction involving a solution of benzyl alcohol (150 μmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL) with 0.05 g of nano-photo-catalyst in the presence of nitrobenzene (5 × 10−2mmol) under N2 atmosphere (1 atm) irradiated by four high blue LED 3 W lamp at room temperature. The reaction conversion was observed by gas chromatography (GC) and FT-IR. As can be seen, neither irradiation alone nor the photo-catalyst without light irradiation acquired any conversion of benzyl alcohol (Table 1, entries 1 and 6). Subsequently, the presence of nano-photo-catalyst under visible light irradiation for this reaction was Obligatory. A 60% conversion of benzyl alcohol was obtained with 0.01 g of the photo-catalyst (Table 1, entry 2). It is evident that an increasing amount of photo-catalyst obtained a considerable enhancement of the photo-oxidation (Table 1, entry 3). At the next step, the concentration of nitrobenzene as an oxidant was investigated and the results showed a quantitative conversion (100%) for 5 × 10−2mmol nitrobenzene using 0.05 g TiO2-P25-SO3H after blue LED irradiation for 7 h. Also, the results illustrate that a higher yield and shorter reaction time were achieved, when the reaction was used the nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H, which confirms the high efficiency of this nano-photo-catalyst. Notably, the greater photo-catalytic activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H was most likely related to the SO3H groups of the photo-catalyst, which could provide efficient acidic sites. Fig. 4 represents the effect of irradiation time on the photo-catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Additionally, the consumption of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene, and formation of benzaldehyde and aniline in an acetonitrile suspension of TiO2-P25-SO3H for 420 min photo-irradiation under optimum condition was monitored. It is evident that after photo-irradiation, amounts of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene monotonously would decrease, while amounts of benzaldehyde and aniline would increase as the photo-oxidation product of benzyl alcohol and photo-reduction product of nitrobenzene, respectively. It could be pointed out that the activity of TiO2-P25-SO3H under blue LED irradiation was remarkable, while there is no photo-catalytic oxidation reaction when no photo-catalyst exists at the same condition. The plausible mechanism for the preparation of benzaldehyde from photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol using TiO2-P25-SO3H as photo-catalyst is outlined in Fig. 5 . When TiO2-P25-SO3H absorbs visible light irradiation from blue LED, it will produce a positive hole (h+) in valence band and electron pair (e−) in conduction band which is the first stage of the reaction [48]. It is noteworthy to mention that, benzyl alcohol oxidizes with the hole to benzaldehyde and the electron reduces nitrobenzene to aniline. Recently specific emphasis has been gained on the use of visible light for photo-catalytic reaction [49,50]. In this report, experiments with TiO2-P25-SO3H under LED light were conducted for the oxidation of alcohol compounds. The results indicated that nitrobenzene can be considered as an expedient oxidant in photo-catalytic oxidation of alcohols under visible light irradiation and in this condition TiO2-P25-SO3H acts as a high efficiency nano-photo-catalyst. Alcohol aromatic compounds possessing functional groups such as nitro, methoxy and halide were oxidized selectively into their corresponding carbonyls and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Interestingly, this method is applicable for a broad variety of aromatic alcohols carrying both electron withdrawing and electron releasing groups. As it is presented in Table 2, the alcohols with electron releasing groups (Table 2, entry 6 and 7) reacted faster compared to electron withdrawing substitutions (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). All the aryl alcohols were oxidized in great yields affording a single product, which diminish the attempts to separate unreacted starting compounds. It is obvious from Table 2 that nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H can act as an effective photo-catalyst for photo-oxidation of aromatic alcohols and it is highly efficient in minimizing the reaction time. It is notable that the most efficient pathway for carbonyl production is ascribed to photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols by TiO2-P25 supported sulfonic acid under blue LED irradiation. In this study, to assess the efficiency of the new photo-catalyst for selective photo-oxidation of aromatic alcohols, it was compared by TiO2-P25 (Table 2). At the next step, in order to promote greener organic synthesis and also for practical applications and stability of this new nano-photo-catalyst, the level of reusability was also tested. From this point of view, after completion of the reaction, photo-catalyst was separated by centrifuge and washed with solvent. After washing in the second stage, the color of TiO2-P25-SO3H was slightly yellowish. The photo-catalyst can be reused at least five times without any remarkable drop in its photo-catalytic activity or the yield of reactions (Fig. 6 ). This result shows that no change in the nature of the photo-catalyst is detectable, after each reaction and –SO3H groups were tightly connected with nano-TiO2-P25, most likely because of a covalent linkage."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, for the first time, we have introduced nano-TiO2-P25-SO3H as a novel and powerful covalently grafted solid acid nano-catalyst for the selective photo-catalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes under visible light irradiation. This efficient photo-catalyst can be generalized well to the current procedures in the field of photo-catalysis reactions. TiO2-P25-SO3H was well characterized by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, EDX and SEM analyses. The successful immobilization of sulfonic acid groups was evaluated by FT-IR and TGA. The XRD presented crystallinity retention of nano-TiO2-P25 after treatment by acidic reagent. SEM results confirmed nanometer-sized particles of the photo-catalyst and the presence of Ti, S and O atoms was demonstrated in the EDX spectrum. In this study, nitrobenzene as a new capable oxidant has been developed for the converting alcohols to related carbonyl compounds in suitable yields. This method has some notable advantages such as operational simplicity, excellent photo-catalytic performance, mild reaction condition, simple work-up without column chromatographic purification, environmental friendly and reusability of the photo-catalyst for five consecutive cycles with consistent activity."
