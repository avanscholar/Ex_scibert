0,Introduction,"In recent years, molecular hydrogen (H2) gas has attracted intense research attention because of its tremendous potential as a clean and sustainable energy vector, which circumvents the looming environmental and energy shortcomings associated with the use of traditional fossil fuels [1]. Indeed, H2 has the highest energy density value (~120 MJ Kg−1) if compared to other fuels (e.g., ethanol or gasoline), and its combustion leads to an enormous heat release. Moreover, the by-products generated by H2 combustion are carbon-free and environmentally friendly [2]. Additionally, to its application as an energy source, molecular hydrogen is also applied in several industrial processes. In short, H2 is employed as a hydrogenation agent of unsaturated and nitro-organic compounds to produce a wide range of relevant products to the food and pharmaceutical industries [3]. Up to date, water electrolysis, ammonia cracking, or hydrocarbon reforming are the main methods employed to produce H2 on a large scale. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and, most of them, environmentally aggressive [4]. Besides that, some drawbacks associated with the storage and transportation of the produced H2 limit its direct application [5]. Therefore, considering the problems mentioned above, chemical hydrides have been believed to be ideal hydrogen-storage materials, providing hydrogen from their decomposition reaction [6]. Among these compounds, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has drawn special attention due to its high H2 storage capacity (~10.8 wt-%), controllable H2 evolution rate, high purity of the H2 produced and the nontoxicity of its decomposition products [6]. Currently, metal based-catalysts are usually used to boost the decomposition of NaBH4, which generates H2 at a considerable rate [7]. Among several possibilities involving metallic compounds as catalysts, the metal nanoparticles have attracted particular interest due to their well-documented physicochemical and surface properties [1,8]. Unfortunately, the applicability of metal nanoparticles can be restricted due to their tendency of aggregation and precipitation, especially in an aqueous medium, where the NaBH4 decomposition is commonly performed [9]. A promising strategy to solve this issue is the utilization of solid supports to immobilize and stabilize the nanoparticles, which guarantees their attractive catalytic properties [10,11]. As additional benefits, the nanoparticles supported on solid supports can be recovered and recycled, without losing its catalytic efficiency [1]. Recently, many studies have reported the use of graphene-based materials as prominent supports for metal nanoparticles since this carbon-derivative exhibits high chemical stability, high surface area, and superior electron mobility [10,12]. Overall, these properties ascribed to the graphene-based materials aid in improving the catalytic performance of the metal nanoparticles [12]. Graphene consists of a 2D monolayer of conjugated sp2-carbon atoms, which is commonly obtained by the reduction of graphene oxide (GO), and, due to that, it could be denominated as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [13]. Notwithstanding, graphene or rGO also undergoes aggregation in aqueous or non-aqueous solutions impairing the immobilization of metallic nanoparticles. Besides, this undesired aggregation makes difficult a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles through the carbon structure during the immobilization process [14], affecting their catalytic performance [11]. To overcome this limitation, rGO has been modified with various organic small molecules or even macromolecules [15,16]. Because of their nontoxic, biocompatible, and hydrophilic nature, polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitosan have been tested in the functionalization of rGO [17,18]. Due to these features, the modification of rGO sheets with polysaccharides seems to be a suitable strategy to enhance their dispersion in the reaction medium, as well as avoid their extended aggregation [19]. Furthermore, the functional groups in the polysaccharide backbone can improve the immobilization of metal nanoparticles on the rGO-polysaccharide hybrid material [19]. In this context, we describe here the preparation of a novel hybrid material based on rGO grafted with carboxymethyl chitosan (denoted as rGO-CMCHT) to act as support of metal nanoparticles for H2 generation. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCHT), a water-soluble chitosan-derivative, exhibits interesting properties that can enhance the dispersion of rGO in the aqueous medium, as well as their supporting ability towards the nanoparticles [20]. By this approach, rGO-CMCHT is obtained as a powder, which is a limiting issue from a practical viewpoint since its recovery and reusability can be harmed. So, a rGO-CMCHT thin film has been prepared via deposition on a glass (GL) substrate by using a dip-coating technique to overcome practical issues. Next, the thin film was employed as solid support for the synthesis and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Various studies encourage the use of AgNPs for H2 generation from the decomposition reactions of hydrogen carriers, likely due to their high catalytic efficiency associated with their outstanding stability [21]. The prepared thin film (denoted as GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag) was extensively tested as a catalyst for H2 generation from NaBH4 decomposition reactions performed in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of this novel hybrid catalyst, the H-species generated in situ from the NaBH4 catalytic degradation have been utilized for the hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene (NB) to aniline (AN)."

3,Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide grafted with carboxymethyl chitosan (rGO-CMCHT),"2.2 Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide grafted with carboxymethyl chitosan (rGO-CMCHT) Graphene oxide (GO) was firstly functionalized with carboxylate groups as a synthetic strategy to improve its reactivity, thereby allowing to increase the grating efficiency of CMCHT on its structure. The experimental procedures performed to synthesize the carboxylated-GO (CMGO) and CMCHT, as well as their full characterization, are detailed and discussed in the Supplementary Information. The grafting of CMCHT on CMGO was adapted from the protocol described by Yang et al. [22]. Briefly, CMGO (0.05 g) was sonicated in distilled water (40 mL) for 30 min until complete dispersion. Then, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) (0.05 g) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (0.025 g) were dissolved in water (10 mL) and added to the CMGO dispersion under magnetic stirring to activate the carboxylic groups. After activation step (3 h at room temperature), a CMCHT aqueous solution (50 mL, 1 mg mL−1) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was heated to 50 °C and stirred for 24 h. Next, the mixture was vacuum filtrated, and the recovered reaction product, denominated as CMGO-CMCHT, was purified with diluted hydrochloric acid (1 mol L−1) and water to remove the unreacted compounds and byproducts. Finally, the CMGO-CMCHT was dried by lyophilization (−55 °C for 6 h). The final hybrid material, rGO-CMCHT, was synthesized by the subsequent reduction of the CMGO-CMCHT using fructose as a reducing agent [23]. Briefly, fructose (0.2 g) was added into a homogenous solution of CMGO-CMCHT (125 mL, 0.5 mg mL−1), followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min. So, the pH was adjusted to 9 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), and the solution was refluxed at 80 °C under continuous stirring for 3 h. After that, the system was cooled down, and the recovered solution was filtered under vacuum and repeatedly washed with distilled water until neutral pH. The product, a black solid, was dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. For comparative purposes, the raw CMGO was reduced to rGO using a similar approach."
4,Preparation of the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film,"2.3 Preparation of the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film The thin film was prepared via deposition on a glass (GL) substrate by using a dip-coating technique, which is outlined in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the GL substrate was functionalized by an acid treatment using a “piranha” solution [24]. For this, the GL substrate (rectangular shape − 22 mm × 40 mm × 1 mm) was sonicated for 30 min in acetone and, further, in distilled water to the removal of all organic and inorganic impurities. The cleaned GL substrate was dried under N2 atmosphere and, then, it was added into a reactor containing the “piranha” solution (200 mL), which was prepared by the mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide (volume ratio of 7:3), under constant stirring for 1 h. The system was maintained in an ice bath to control the temperature (~20 °C). This acid treatment allowed the introduction of hydroxyl groups (OH) on the substrate surface due to the strong oxidant activity of the “piranha” solution. Then, the modified GL substrate was thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum oven. Next, the substrate was sonicated in an aqueous solution of NaOH (100 mL, pH 12, 0.1 mol L−1) for 1 h to convert the hydroxyl groups on the substrate surface to alkoxide groups. Finally, the negatively charged GL substrate was dip-coated into a cationic deacetylated-chitosan solution (CHT, 100 mL, 1 mg mL−1, pH 3) for 100 cycles. After the dip-coating cycles, the substrate covered with the CHT thin film (labeled as GL/CHT) was washed with distilled water and dried under vacuum at 30 °C (overnight). Then, GL/CHT was further dip-coated into a negatively charged rGO-CMCHT solution (100 mL, 1 mg mL−1, pH 6) for another 100 cycles, resulting in additional coverage of the substrate with a rGO-CMCHT layer (Fig. 1). Again, the resulting thin film (denominated as GL/rGO-CMCHT) was washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum oven at 30 °C. For comparative purposes, the GL/CHT thin films were also covered with a layer of CMCHT, CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, or rGO (100 mL, 1 mg mL−1 of CMCHT, CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT or rGO, pH 6, 100 cycles) using the same dip-coating process described above. These thin films were labeled as GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, and GL/rGO, respectively. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized in situ on the surface of the prepared thin films (GL/CHT, GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, GL/rGO, and GL/rGO-CMCHT) according to the method previously reported [1]. Briefly, each film sample was immersed in an AgNO3 solution (100 mL, 0.1 mol L−1) for 24 h at room temperature to allow the adsorption of silver ions (Ag+). Next, these samples were recovered, soaked in distilled water and, then, oven-dried (40 °C for 24 h). The amount Ag adsorbed on each film was quantified by the microwave-induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP-OES) technique with operating parameters adjusted according to manufactures guidelines, and the atomic emission signal was measured as a peak height mode of an analytical curve (R2 ≈ 0.999). For that, the initial amount of silver ions in the solution (C0), the amount of these ions in the solution after the immersion of the films (C1), and their amount in the purification medium (C2) were measured by MIP-OES. Then, by a direct subtraction ([C0 − (C1 + C2) × V]) considering the volume of solution (V), the amount of adsorbed silver ions by the films were determined. After that, the Ag-loaded samples were immersed in a NaBH4 solution (100 mL, 50 mmol L−1) for 30 min at room temperature to reduce the Ag+ ions. Next, the film containing the AgNPs was thoroughly washed with distilled water and oven-dried (40 °C for 24 h). These film samples were labeled as GL/CHT@Ag, GL/CMCHT@Ag, GL/rGO@Ag, and GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag."

6,Catalytic hydrogen generation,"2.5 Catalytic hydrogen generation The catalytic decomposition of NaBH4 was performed by immersing the prepared thin films directly in the reaction medium following the protocol described by Hostert et al. [1]. This reaction was also performed in the presence of thin films without the AgNPs, as well as in the absence of the catalyst. Briefly, NaBH4 was dissolved in distilled water (0.2 mol L−1, 100 mL) in a closed vessel, and the system was kept under stirring (100 rpm) using a magnetic bar at a constant temperature in a water-bath. Thus, the thin film was placed in the solution (0.1 g), and the generated gas (H2) was collected in an inverted measuring cylinder containing water, immersed in a beaker filled with water (2 L). The volume of water displaced was related to the amount of gas produced by the ideal gas law (PV = nRT). The system was completed isolated to guarantee that all gas produced is collected. The conversion efficiency was calculated using the theoretical molar amount of H2 stored in NaBH4 and the measured molar quantity of H2 generated from the decomposition reaction measured per time [25]. Additionally, the H2 generation arising from the NaBH4 decomposition using the prepared thin films was also investigated in methanol (MetOH), ethanol (EtOH), and isopropanol (PropOH) as alternative solvents. For these experiments, the same procedure described above was used, and reactions were kept at room temperature (~25 °C). At the end of the experiment, any precipitate was observed."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation,"2.6 Catalytic hydrogenation Catalytic activity of the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film was also tested in the hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene (NB) to aniline (AN) in different solvents (water, MetOH, EtOH, and PropOH). For this, the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag film (0.1 g containing approximately 1.20 mg of AgNPs) was placed in a reactor filled with an NB solution (5 mmol L−1, 100 mL). Next, NaBH4 was directly added into the reactor (final concentration of 0.2 mmol L−1), which was sealed. The system was kept under stirring at room temperature for 120 min. The conversion of NB to AN was monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy in the wavelength range of 200–500 nm. The absorbance band of NB at λmax = 265 nm at the beginning and the end of the experiment was used to determine the conversion efficiency of NB to AN. An analytical curve was built with the NB concentration varying from 0.1 to 10 mmol L−1 in each solvent tested. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are expressed as average values."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of rGO-CMCHT,"3.1 Characterization of rGO-CMCHT The synthesis of rGO-CMCHT encompassed three steps: (i) the functionalization of GO sheets with carboxylic groups (resulting in the CMGO intermediate); (ii) the grafting of CMCHT on CMGO sheets, and (iii) the reduction of the CMGO moieties to rGO. An illustrative scheme referring to the second and third steps is shown in Fig. 2 . The reaction between CMGO and CMCHT was mediated by an EDC/NHS mixture that promotes the activation of the carboxylic groups of CMGO, allowing the nucleophilic attack of the amine groups of CMCHT [26]. As a result, stable amide bonds are formed between CMCHT and CMGO (Fig. 2a). Next, the CMGO-CMCHT intermediate was reduced using an alkaline solution of fructose. This sugar exhibits a strong reducing activity in alkaline solutions (pH > 9), promoting the reduction of epoxide and carboxylic groups of the CMGO moieties (Fig. 2b) [23]. The chemical nature of the synthesized compounds was investigated by FTIR analysis (Fig. 3 ). The FTIR spectra of CMGO and CMCHT were deeply discussed in the Supplementary Information. As compared to the CMGO spectrum, CMGO-CMCHT exhibited new bands ascribed to the CO stretching (at 1653 cm−1) and NH bending (at 1572 cm−1) due to the amide bonds formed between the CMGO and CMCHT (Fig. 3a) [22]. Moreover, the band associated with the OH stretching was narrowed and shifted to a higher wavenumber (from 3420 cm−1 to 3445 cm−1). The CMGO-CMCHT spectrum also exhibited the characteristic band of the carboxyl groups (COOH) of CMCHT (at 1750 cm−1), while the intensity of the absorption bands related to the CH stretching (2995–2815 cm−1 region) was increased in intensity. Therefore, all these above-mentioned features confirm the successful synthesis of the CMGO-CMCHT intermediate [22]. The further reduction of the CMGO to rGO caused some changes in the FTIR spectra obtained for the resulting compounds, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b. Overall, both spectra (rGO and rGO-CMCHT) exhibited a similar pattern, where the intensity of the bands associated with the O-functionalities of CMGO was decreased. For instance, the bands related to the CO stretching of the epoxy groups (at 1093 cm−1, 1018 cm−1, and 865 cm−1) practically disappeared from the rGO and rGO-CMCHT spectra, which confirms the reduction of these compounds by the sugar. These results fully agree with previous reports [27,28]. In contrast, the rGO-CMCHT spectrum still exhibited the bands attributed to the carboxylic groups and amide (at 1750 cm−1, 1653 cm−1, and 1572 cm−1), suggesting the maintenance of the rGO-CMCHT linkage. Additionally, compounds containing the grafted CMCHT moiety (i.e., CMGO-CMCHT and rGO-CMCHT) were also analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S5). As assessed, the resonance signals from the CMCHT are observed in both 1H NMR spectra recorded from CMGO-CMCHT and rGO-CMCHT indicating that the polysaccharide was not degraded after the reduction step. However, resonance signals ascribed to CMGO-CMCHT and rGO-CMCHT exhibited different shapes and different chemical shifts compared to CMCHT. In general, these discrepancies can be related to the low amount of polysaccharide grafted on these samples and due to the presence of the graphitic structure that induces an upfield shifting of the proton signals due to its diamagnetic nature [29,30]. Moreover, signals ascribed to the carboxyl groups of CMGO-CMCHT and rGO-CMCHT were overlapped due to the grafting reaction and changes in their chemical environment [29,30]. It is important to mention that the low solubility of CMGO in the deuterated solvent prevented its characterization by 1H NMR spectroscopy. After the reduction step, the rGO-CMCHT still preserves free carboxylic groups on its structure, as demonstrated by FTIR and 1H NMR analysis. The concentration of carboxylic groups in rGO-CMCHT was calculated to be 2.47 ± 0.24 mmol g−1, while for rGO, this value drops to 1.06 ± 0.15 mmol g−1 (information about the procedure used to estimate the concentration of carboxylic groups in these materials is given in the Supplementary Information). These data are straightly related to the zeta potential values measured to these samples (−46.67 ± 5.51 mV for rGO-CMCHT and −13.74 ± 6.02 mV for rGO). It seems reasonable to infer that this difference regarding the zeta potential values is due to the carboxylic groups of the CMCHT moiety. On the other hand, the negative zeta potential measured for rGO may be associated with reminiscent carboxylic groups in its structure. Overall, the carboxylic-rich rGO-CMCHT structure confers to this compound a noticeable negative potential, which assures its good dispersity and stability in an aqueous medium, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . Under pH conditions close to neutrality, the carboxylic groups are fully deprotonated (pKa ≈ 4.5), thereby, electrostatic repulsion among the rGO-CMCHT sheets prevents their aggregation and coalescence [31]. Also, the extended polymeric structure of the CMCHT can contribute to this behavior due to the steric impediment [3]. Interestingly, even before the reduction step, the compound CMGO-CMHT also showed good dispersion in the aqueous medium, which highlights the role of the grafted polysaccharide. Indeed, both compounds containing the grafted CMCHT moiety only presented signals of precipitation after 1 week in repose, while the CMGO and rGO quickly aggregate after 10 min. This characteristic also affects the Tyndall effect of the compounds (Fig. S6). In general, the CMGO-CMCHT and rGO-CMCHT still preserve this effect, while the CMGO and rGO aggregated and they do not show an efficient scattering of light. As an additional benefit, the presence of the CMCHT moiety in the rGO-CMCHT can enhance its interaction with positively charges species (such as metallic ions) as compared to rGO. This feature allows, for instance, to immobilize/stabilize metal nanoparticles in a more efficient way [32], which is one goal of this work. Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique widely used to evaluate the lattice structure and the electronic, optical, and phonon properties of carbonaceous materials [5]. It is well-known that two distinct bands (G and D bands) are observable in the Raman spectra of graphitic materials [5]. Overall, the G band originates from the vibration of sp2 carbon atoms (in CC bond) in the 2D hexagonal lattice, while the D band is associated with the sp3 carbon atoms of lattice distortion and/or defects in the graphene sheets [13]. The Raman spectra of CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT are shown in Fig. 5 a. As observed, all compounds showed the G and D bands in their spectrum with some modifications. As compared to CMGO, the G and D bands in the CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT spectra were blue-shifted, indicating the reduction of these compounds and, thereby, the removal of oxygen-functional groups in the basal plane of the carbonic sheets [5]. Such inference can be elucidated from the evaluation of the ratio between the intensity of the D and G bands (ID/IG), which is used as a yardstick to quantify the extent of disorder in carbon-based materials [5]. During the reduction of this kind of material, the oxygen-containing functional groups are removed from its basal plane, which would result in a decrease of the ID/IG ratio [13]. For the proper calculation of the ID/IG ratio for each material analyzed, the data collected from Raman spectroscopy were firstly fitted by a Lorentzian curve. So, the ID/IG ratio calculated for CMGO-CMCHT (1.30), rGO (1.13), and rGO-CMCHT (1.07) showed to be lower than that calculated for CMGO (1.50). These results suggest that the oxygen-containing groups in the graphene basal plane decreased and that sp2-hybridized domains increased in CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT [33]. In addition, according to the calculated data, the reduction of CMGO-CMCHT seems to be more efficient than to CMGO. This result can be explained by the better dispersion of CMGO-CMCHT in the reaction medium as compared to CMGO, which facilitates its interaction with the molecules of the reductive agent. As expected, the ID/IG ratio values calculated for rGO and rGO-CMCHT were lower as compared to unreduced compounds (CMGO and CMGO-CHT). However, the lower ID/IG ratio value of CMGO-CMCHT as compared to CMGO was unexpected since the grafting of CMCHT on CMGO would promote the increase of sp3-hybridized sidewall carbon that would theoretically increase the ID/IG ratio [13,34]. Accordingly, it is possible to infer that the CMCHT has an active role in the reduction of the CMGO sheets. As earlier reported, CMCHT could be used as an alternative reducing agent, being used for the synthesis of gold and platinum nanoparticles [10]. Although the exact reduction mechanism of these metals by CMCHT is still not completely understood, the hydroxyl groups at the C6 position were considered to be involved in the reduction process [10]. In order to verify the reduction of the prepared materials by fructose, UV–Vis analyses of CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT were also performed (Fig. 5b). The UV–Vis spectra of CMGO exhibited a broad absorption peak centered at 250 nm related to π → π* transitions of conjugated CC bonds presented [35]. After the grafting of CMCHT moieties on CMGO sheets, the π → π* transitions bands were shifted to 256 nm likely due to the increase of unsaturated conjugated bonds (i.e., CC domains), since as more π → π* transitions, the less energy to their electronic transition is necessary, which results in a higher λmax [14]. Therefore, the shifting of this band in the CMGO-CMCHT spectrum suggests some kind of reduction in the CMGO moieties. The absorption spectra recorded for rGO and rGO-CMCHT also showed the band assigned to the π → π* transitions of conjugated CC bonds in higher wavelength regions as compared to CMGO (λmax ≈ 269 nm for rGO and 275 nm for rGO-CMCHT). So, this result confirms the reduction of these compounds by fructose and the increment of sp2 domains in the basal plane of the graphitic sheets. In addition, the absorption band due to the CC electronic transitions in the rGO-CMCHT spectrum was shifted to a higher wavelength (275 nm), confirming that the reduction of this compound occurred in a more efficient way as previously suggested by the Raman data. Moreover, using the UV–Vis data, the energy gap (Eg ) of the compounds was estimated by Tauc plots using the following equation [15]: (1) α h ν 1 / 2 = K h ν - E g where α is the absorption coefficient of each compound, h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency, K is a proportionality constant, and Eg is the gap energy. The values of Eg are equal to the intercept on the abscissa by the best fitting of α h ν 1 / 2 in the function of h ν (Fig. S7). In this work, α was treated as the maximum absorbance value of each compound in order to simplify the calculations [15]. The values of Eg of CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT were calculated to be 4.23 eV, 4.21 eV, 3.95 eV, and 3.87, respectively. As assessed, rGO-CMCHT possesses the lowest Eg value among all the synthesized compounds, which stand out that it has an excellent electronic mobility property due to its low resistivity to electron conduction. This result is outstanding since it implies that the graphitic sheets of rGO-CMCHT have more CC domains than the other synthesized compounds and, at the same time, it indicates that the CMCHT moieties were grafted preferentially on the edges of CMGO sheets and not in their basal plane [16]. The structural features of CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT were investigated by XRD analysis (Fig. 6 a). The diffraction pattern of CMGO exhibited a peak centered at 2θ ≈ 13.2° assigned to the (001) crystalline plane of the GO [23]. After the grating reaction, the (001) diffraction peak was shifted to 2θ ≈ 15.1° confirming the partial reduction of CMGO by the CMCHT moieties [17]. Comparatively, the diffraction patterns of rGO and rGO-CMCHT showed diffraction peaks related to the (002) crystalline plane of the rGO graphitic sheet at 2θ ≈ 20.1° and 20.4°, respectively [36]. The presence of these diffraction peaks in higher diffraction angles is because of the reduction of these compounds by the fructose [23]. Additionally, the diffraction peaks shifting was more pronounced for rGO-CMCHT than for rGO, corroborating the discussion that the CMCHT moiety has an active role in the reduction efficiency [17,23]. The interlayer distance (d) between the carbon sheets of each compound was estimated from the XRD data by using Bragg’s equation ( λ = 2 d sin θ ) [23]. The estimated d-spacing values for CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT were 0.33 nm, 0.30 nm, 0.24 nm, and 0.22 nm, respectively. According to these data, the grafting of CMCHT decreased the d-spacing between the CMGO sheets, which strengthen the suggestion that this reaction preferentially occurs at the edges. Indeed, considering that the carboxylic groups of CMGO are mainly distributed at the edges of the sheets, it is reasonable to consider that the CMCHT chains were preferentially grafted at this position [37,38]. On the other note, the reduction of CMGO resulted in a decrease of d-spacing estimated for the rGO and rGO-CMCHT compounds. This result can be ascribed to the efficient reduction of the oxygen-containing groups in the basal planes of the CMGO sheets, which decrease its interlayer distance [23]. The thermal properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated by TGA analysis since it provides relevant information about the thermal behavior of the samples, which is closely related to their chemical nature [39]. As observed from the TGA curves (Fig. 6b), all samples presented distinct thermal behaviors. The CMGO showed an initial weight loss stage (~4% of weight loss) in the temperature range of 37–235 °C due to the evaporation of adsorbed water [40]. The second weight-loss stage (~12% of weight loss) noticed for CMGO appeared around 260 °C, which is a result of the thermal decomposition of its oxygen-containing functional groups [40]. After the temperature exceeds 363 °C, the weight of CMGO falls fair steadily due to the degradation of the remaining carbonic structure [39]. The TGA curve of CMGO-CMCHT is very similar to CMGO, although some discrepancies can be noticed. The main difference is related to a higher weight loss of this sample in all degradation stages, likely due to the presence of the CMCHT moieties grafted on the CMGO sheets [28]. For rGO, the TGA curve showed enhanced thermal stability with a lower weight loss profile until the end of the analysis (~16% of weight loss). This trend is typically observed for reduced graphene-based compounds [27,39]. At last, the rGO-CMCHT curve also showed enhanced thermal stability likely due to the same reasons that for rGO (i.e., reduction by fructose). From TGA data, the CMHT content in the CMGO-CMHT and rGO-CMCHT compounds was estimated to be 0.12 mg mg−1 and 0.10 mg mg−1, respectively. TEM images were used to analyze the structure and morphology of the CMGO, CMGO-CMCHT, rGO, and rGO-CMCHT compounds (Fig. 7 ). As observed, CMGO possesses a sheet-like structure with a large thickness, smooth surface, and wrinkled edges caused probably the insertion of carboxylic groups [32]. The CMGO-CMCHT compound also presented a sheet-like structure with enhanced thickness compared to CMGO, which could be due to the presence of the CMCHT moieties grafted on CMGO sheets [12]. However, the maintenance of stacked sheets in this compound is strong evidence of the insertion of CMCHT chains at the edges of CMGO sheets. According to the TEM images, the reduced compounds (rGO and rGO-CMCHT) showed distinct morphology. The rGO-CMCHT still exhibited a sheet-like structure, but with a smoother surface than CMGO-CMCHT, likely due to the removal of the oxygen-containing groups of the basal planes of the graphitic moiety of rGO-CMCHT [28]. Finally, the TEM image recorded from rGO revealed that its graphitic sheets are thinner than the other materials synthesized in this work, confirming its efficient reduction by fructose [17]."
10,Characterization of the prepared thin films containing AgNPs,"3.2 Characterization of the prepared thin films containing AgNPs As aforementioned, a thin film based on rGO-CMCHT was prepared on a glass substrate aiming its further use for AgNPs immobilization and, then, in catalysis. For comparative purposes, three other thin films were also prepared and characterized (GL/CHT, GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, and GL/rGO). So, the as-prepared thin films were left in contact with a solution containing Ag+ ions to adsorb them. The amount of Ag adsorbed on each film (mg of Ag adsorbed by a gram of film) was estimated from MIP-OES analyses. In general lines, the GL/CMCHT film adsorbed the highest amount of Ag (34.00 ± 1.50 mg g−1) followed by GL/CMGO-CMCHT (12.70 ± 1.08 mg g−1), GL/rGO-CMCHT (12.00 ± 2.00 mg g−1), GL/CMGO (11.20 ± 1.12 mg g−1), GL/rGO (10.20 ± 1.30 mg g−1) and GL/CHT (10.00 ± 0.80 mg g−1). This is an expected result since GL/CMCHT possesses the greatest amount of carboxyl groups (negative sites) to interact with the Ag+ ions. From all film samples prepared, the GL/CHT film adsorbed the lower amount of Ag+ ions. The CHT solution was acidified (pH ~ 3) to prepare this film, a condition where the amine groups in the polymer structure were protonated [41]. As a result, the interaction between these functionalities and the Ag+ ions is limited, and their adsorption is limited. On the contrary, the GL/CMGO film adsorbed more Ag+ ions likely due to the presence of carboxyl groups in the CMGO structure that can bind efficiently these ions. The film sample containing rGO adsorbed more Ag ions than GL/CHT because rGO possesses remaining carboxyl groups and an enhanced effective area that guarantee more accessible interaction sites [1]. Regarding the higher amount of Ag loaded in the GL/CMGO-CMCHT and GL/rGO-CMCHT, when compared to GL/CHT, GL/CMGO, and GL/rGO, it should be related to a synergistic effect between the rGO and CMCHT [42]. Interestingly, the amount of Ag ions adsorbed by the GL/rGO-CMCHT and GL/CMGO-CMCHT films is similar, which indicates that the reduction reaction did not affect negatively the adsorption of the silver ions. The Ag+ ions adsorbed on the thin film samples were reduced using NaBH4 as a reductive agent. After the reduction of the adsorbed Ag+ ions, all film samples became darker, which is typically attributed to the formation of the nanoparticles [43]. UV–Vis analyses were performed to investigate this process (Fig. 8 ). The spectra recorded from GL/CHT@Ag, GL/CMCHT@Ag, GL/CMGO@Ag, GL/CMGO-CMCHT@Ag, GL/rGO@Ag, and GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag were normalized by direct subtraction with UV–Vis spectra of GL substrate [1]. One of the most important characteristics of metal nanoparticles is their surface plasmon resonance, a physicochemical phenomenon observed in these particles due to the collective oscillation of conduction electrons excited by the electromagnetic field of light [44]. Due to this, an electric field is induced around the nanoparticles. A restoring force in the metallic nanoparticles results in a single resonance wavelength, which depends on several factors such as the particle size and shape [44]. The resonant frequency for these resonance oscillations corresponds typically to UV–Vis and, thereby, AgNPs have an absorption band in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Mainly, AgNPs are known to exhibit a UV–Vis maximum absorption in the wavelength range of 340–500 nm, which depends on the size and shape of the nanoparticles [1,44]. The spectra recorded from the pristine films (i.e., without Ag) and the Ag+-loaded films were not shown here since they did not exhibit noticeable absorption bands. In contrast, all films containing the reduced Ag exhibited a sing characteristic absorption band assigned to AgNPs, confirming their synthesis. As observed in Fig. 8, these absorption bands appeared at different wavelengths, which can be explained by the different composition of each film. As previously mentioned, the UV–Vis absorption spectrum profile of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) is dependent on their shape and size. Metallic nanoparticles, especially Ag nanoparticles, have different plasmon modes depending on their shape resulting in different UV–Vis absorption bands [45]. For instance, the UV–Vis absorption spectrum of Ag nanoprisms exhibits three distinct absorption bands, while Ag nanorods have two separated absorption bands associated with longitudinal and transversal excitation, respectively [45]. In the case of spherical nanoparticles, only one absorption band in the spectrum is present [45,46]. Therefore, according to the UV–Vis data, the synthesized AgNPs in the different film samples have a spherical-like shape. Moreover, the maximum absorption wavelength is proportional to the size of the nanoparticles [47,48]. As assessed, the highest wavelength (λmax = 436 nm) was verified for the AgNPs immobilized on the GL/CMGO film, while the lowest (λmax = 344 nm) was noticed for the GL/rGO-CMCHT film. Thus, according to the data showed in Fig. 8, the AgNPs synthesized on the GL/rGO-CMCHT film have the smallest size, which could be beneficial to catalysis [1,49]. Notwithstanding, since the experimentally measured UV–Vis spectrum is a weighted average of the absorption spectra corresponding to the nanoparticles present in the sample, it can be used to roughly estimate the size of the nanoparticles through the Mie model [50–53]. The Mie model gives estimation for the particle size of spherical nanoparticles and is useful when the wavelength is comparable to the particle diameter and scattering is dominated by a single scattering process (i.e., one plasmon resonance mode). Since the AgNPs synthesized in this study are spherical according to the UV–Vis analysis, the Mie model can be applied to estimate the size of the nanoparticles. By fitting the UV–Vis spectra recorded from the prepared AgNP-loaded films by a Lorentzian curve, the Mie model can be simplified and the diameter (d) of the nanoparticles can be estimated by Eq. (2) [51]. (2) d = ν F × λ 2 π × c × Δ λ where d is the diameter of the nanoparticle (nm), ν f is the electron velocity corresponding to the Fermi level of silver (1.39 × 106 m s−1), λ is the absorption wavelength, c is the velocity of light and Δ λ is the full-width at half maximum of the absorption band of the fitted curve. All the UV–Vis spectrum were fitted by a Lorentzian curve using the Origin Pro 8.5® software [51,53]. Thus, according to Eq. (2), the AgNPs synthesized in situ on GL/CHT, GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, GL/rGO, and GL/rGO-CMCHT films showed the following average size: 5.30 nm, 6.20 nm, 7.00 nm, 5.70 nm, 5.00 nm, and 4.80 nm. Here, it is important to mention that the estimated diameters by Eq. (2) are average values and it could differ from the TEM measurements, for example. This discrepancy arises mainly because the Mie model did not take into account the anisotropic behavior and the polydispersity of the nanoparticles [54]. However, many studies already reported a good relationship between the size obtained from the Mie model and the experimental measurement (TEM and XRD analyses), including nanoparticles supported in glass substrates [51,53–57]. Thus, the estimated diameters for the synthesized Ag nanoparticles are still useful, for instance, to compare the catalytic activity between the catalyst prepared in this work [53]. On that account, the estimated diameters confirm that the AgNPs synthesized on the GL/rGO-CMCHT film have the smallest size, while the biggest Ag nanoparticles were synthesized on the GL/CMGO film. This behavior is consistent with previous literature, which also highlights the role of graphene (or reduced graphene oxide)-based materials (such as the rGO-CMCHT) as nucleating agents for the growth of the metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape [1,46]. Interestingly, the nanoparticles synthesized on the GL/CMCHT film also exhibited a bigger size than the GL/CMGO-CMCHT and GL/CHT films. For this last, the size of the synthesized AgNPs is similar to those on the rGO and rGO/CMCHT films. Then, although the GL/CMCHT film had immobilized the highest amount of Ag, it is not capable of efficiently control the size and, probably, the shape of the nanoparticles. The chemical interactions existing in the prepared thin films were investigated by FTIR analyses (Fig. 9 a). The FTIR spectra recorded from GL/CHT, GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, GL/rGO, and GL/rGO-CMCHT exhibited similar bands associated with adsorbed moisture (at 1635 cm−1) and SiO bond (at 668 cm−1), which is characteristic of the GL substrate [59,60]. The GL/CHT spectrum exhibited bands related to the NH stretching (at 3529 cm−1) and bending (at 1560 cm−1) due to the presence of CHT deposited on the GL substrate [43]. The FTIR spectrum of GL/CMCHT showed a narrowed band associated with the OH and NH stretching (at 3445 cm−1) [43] and a noticeable band attributed to the CO stretching of the carboxylic groups of CMCHT (at 1756 cm−1), which was shifted as compared to CMCHT. Such differences are likely due to the electrostatic interaction between the CHT and CMCHT layers. The GL/CMGO film exhibited the bands of the CMGO compound, including the band attributed to the carboxylic groups (at 1730 cm−1). It is possible to note in the GL/CMGO-CMCHT spectrum the typical bands of CMGO-CMCHT with some changes, likely due to its interaction with the CHT layer. The GL/rGO spectrum did not exhibit the characteristic bands of rGO. However, the band attributed to the OH stretching was narrowed and shifted to a higher wavenumber (at 3465 cm−1) as compared to the GL/CHT spectrum. Despite that, the band due to the reminiscent carboxylic groups in the rGO sheets was still observed (at 1744 cm−1). Comparatively, the GL/rGO-CMCHT exhibited the band characteristic of the carboxylic groups of CMCHT (at 1754 cm−1) and a shoulder-type band associated with the amide bond (at 1629 cm−1) [22]. The adsorption of Ag+ ions on the prepared thin films has caused some changes in their FTIR spectra, as observed in Fig. 9b. The main changes are related to the shifting of the OH and NH stretching bands for higher wavenumber regions, as well as its narrowing in all spectra. Interestingly, the intensity of the bands attributed to the carboxylic groups in the Ag+-loaded GL/CMCHT, GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, and GL/rGO-CMCHT spectra decreased in intensity after the adsorption. These results suggest that Ag+ ions interact preferentially with the hydroxyl, amine, and carboxylic groups that are available on the surface of the prepared films [61]. After the AgNPs synthesis, the FTIR spectra of GL/CHT@Ag, GL/CMCHT@Ag, GL/CMGO@Ag, GL/CMGO-CMCHT@Ag, GL/rGO@Ag, and GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag exhibited some slight discrepancies as compared to the spectra recorded from the Ag+-loaded films. In general lines, the bands associated with the different vibration modes of the hydroxyl, amine, and carboxylic groups were shifted to different wavenumber regions and/or their absorption intensities were changed. Such behavior indicates that the Ag+ ions that interacted with these functional groups remain bound to them after the reduction reaction. This stabilizing effect mediated by functional groups present on the polysaccharides concerning metal nanoparticles has been widely reported [62,63]."
11,Catalytic hydrogen generation,"3.3 Catalytic hydrogen generation The generation of H2 can be done by the decomposition of hydrogen-storage compounds, such as NaBH4, which possess many advantages to other production methods [6]. However, this reaction has low-efficiency rates at room temperature without the use of an appropriate catalyst [1]. Herein, we investigated the use of GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film as a potential catalyst for the H2 generation from the NaBH4 decomposition reaction under aqueous medium. The NaBH4 decomposition occurs via a catalyzed hydrolysis process often performed in water since this solvent is eco-friendly and abundant [7,64]. The volume of H2 gas generated was monitored as a function of time, and the collected data were expressed as the H2 generation rate. In parallel, experiments using GL/CHT@Ag, GL/CMCHT@Ag, GL/CMGO@Ag, GL/CMGO-CMCHT@Ag, and GL/rGO@Ag as catalysts were also performed. Another important comparison was made by using the bare thin films (without AgNPs) to catalyze the decomposition reaction, as well as a reaction without any catalyst. In both cases, a negligible volume of H2 was generated (approximately, an H2 generation efficiency of 10%). The kinetic profiles obtained are described in Fig. 10 . As illustrated in Fig. 10, the H2 generation efficiency changed as a function of the film sample; however, no induction time was necessary for all samples. The volume of H2 generated from the reactions catalyzed by the Ag-loaded thin films increased in the following order: GL/CHT < GL/CMCHT < GL/CMGO < GL/CMGO-CMCHT < GL/rGO < GL/rGO-CMCHT. Here, the AgNPs act as catalytic sites for the hydrolysis reaction and the subsequent H2 generation, as shown in Eq. (3). Since the GL/rGO-CMCHT film contains the smallest AgNPs and, therefore, the more reactive nanoparticles [1], the higher H2 generation ability of this film is expected. However, the lower H2 generation efficiency of the GL/CHT (34%) compared to GL/CMGO (62%) and GL/CMGO-CMCHT (85%) is an unexpected result, since the AgNPs immobilized in the GL/CHT film are smaller than the nanoparticles in the GL/CMGO and GL/CMGO-CMCHT films. Besides that, higher and faster H2 generation efficiency achieved by the GL/rGO-CMCHT film compared to the GL/rGO film is an intriguing find because the Ag nanoparticles embedded in these films have a similar size (a difference of ~0.20 nm). These observations suggest that the size of the nanoparticles may not be the only factor affecting the catalytic H2 generation. Indeed, the results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between the graphitic structure and the AgNPs that favors the H2 generation. Such synergism between graphitic materials, such as graphene (or rGO), and other metal nanoparticles has also been reported by other authors that investigated their use in H2 generation reactions [65,66]. (3) N a B H 4 ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) → catalyst N a B O 2 ( a q . ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) Generally, the mechanism of the NaBH4 decomposition is based on two surface-mediated steps that encompass: (i) the adsorption of the borohydride (BH4 −) ions on the catalyst surface, and (ii) the reaction of these adsorbed species with the water molecules [42]. The transfer of H− from the chemisorbed BH4 − ions to the AgNPs characterizes the first step of this reaction. Next, the H− species reacts with the water molecule to produce H2 [42]. In summary, the mechanism of the NaBH4 decomposition is based on charge transfer reactions. Overall, materials containing rGO have intrinsic charge mobility properties, that can accelerate (i.e., catalyze) these reactions and more H2 would be generated [67–69]. A generic mechanism for the NaBH4 decomposition on the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag was proposed in Fig. 11 , where the CMCHT moieties were omitted to simplify the explanation. In short, the effect of the graphitic material on the reaction is mainly assigned to the improvement of the catalytic activity of AgNPs during the electron transfer process of the H− species from the BH4 − ion to the adjacent nanoparticle and the water molecule [42]. This transfer process can happen directly from one Ag nanoparticle (Fig. 11a) or the metal nanoparticle to the graphitic structure and, then, to the water molecule (Fig. 11b) or even from one nanoparticle to the adjacent nanoparticle through the graphitic layer (Fig. 11c). Herein, the matrices used to support Ag nanoparticles (i.e., GL/CHT and GL/CMCHT films) are inert and, therefore, cannot conduct electrons, which support the suggestion that only the first mode of charge transfer occurs. In this case, the nanoparticle is isolated and the electron transfer is kinetically slower, which could hamper the H2 generation [67–69]. On the other hand, the graphitic structure of GL/CMGO, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, GL/rGO, and GL/rGO-CMCHT films allows more pathways to the electron transfer to the water and, then, the H2 generation is improved. This effect is strengthened by the faster H2 generation of the graphitic-based films when compared to the other films prepared. Additionally, the electron-mobility in the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag film is higher than in GL/CMGO@Ag, GL/CMGO-CMCHT, and GL/rGO@Ag (rGO-CMCHT has a lower energy gap as discussed previously), thus, enhancing the catalytic activity of the AgNPs embedded in the GL/rGO-CMCHT film. Obviously, the effect of the smaller size of the Ag nanoparticles is boosted by the electron-conduction property of the support [69]. We also hypothesize that CMCHT has a secondary role related to the enhancement of the interactions action between the reactants (e.g., AgNPs and NaBH4 molecules). In general lines, the experimental results seem to agree with these statements and confirm our initial hypothesis that the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film catalyzes the H2 generation from the NaBH4 decomposition reactions efficiently. The kinetic data of H2 generated from the reaction catalyzed by GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag were fitted using the pseudo-first-order model, denoted by equation (4). This kinetic model is suitable to evaluate the NaBH4 decomposition reaction, and H2 generation since the concentration of water (act as reactant) is much higher than the concentration of NaBH4. Thus, it can be considered that the water concentration remains constant during the reaction [70]. Moreover, the maximum concentration of H2 generated is closely related to the initial concentration of NaBH4 ( H 2 max = 4 BH 4 - 0 ) [70]. (4) ln H 2 t = ln H 2 max + k app t where H 2 t is the concentration of H2 generated in each time interval (t), H 2 max is the maximum concentration of H2 generated (theoretical value), and kapp is the apparent rate constant for this reaction, which can be obtained from the slope of the linear plot of ln H 2 t against t (Fig. S8). The kapp value calculated for the reaction catalyzed by GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag was 6.40 × 10−2 min−1 (R2 ≈ 0.988), indicating that this catalyst shows a remarkable potential to efficiently catalyze the H2 production from the NaBH4 hydrolysis. The kapp values for the other prepared catalysts were not calculated since they exhibited a lower catalytic efficiency. Although this valuable kinetic data, the H2 generation rate is commonly expressed as the maximum rate of H2 generation (MRP, expressed as mL min−1 g−1), which takes on account the catalyst mass (in grams). The MRP can be calculated by the following equation: (5) MRP = V t × k app m cat where V t is the total volume of H2 generated from the reaction (mL), kapp is the reaction apparent rate constant (min−1) and m cat is the catalyst mass (3 mg of rGO-CMCHT@Ag deposited on the glass substrate) [1]. Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) at room temperature (~25 °C) was calculated per Eq. (6) [66]. (6) TOF = n H 2 n AgNPs t where TOF is the turnover frequency (min−1), n H 2 is the total number of H2 moles generated, n AgNPs is the number of moles of Ag embedded in the catalyst, and t (min) is the reaction time. Finally, Arrhenius’ equation was used to estimate the activation energy (Ea ) for this reaction catalyzed by GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film [7]. By this equation, the value of Ea was estimated to be 20.10 kJ mol−1 (R2 ≈ 0.989). All the kinetic and thermodynamic data calculated for the H2 generation catalyzed by the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag is summarized in Table 1 , including its comparison with other catalysts used for generating H2 under similar experimental conditions. Overall, the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film showed excellent catalytic activity, having an outstanding TOF value and a lower Ea for the H2 generation from the NaBH4 decomposition as compared to other catalysts reported elsewhere. Also, the novel catalyst prepared in this work presented a higher MRP value with respect to the other comparative materials. This impressive catalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the rGO-CMCHT and the AgNPs, which are homogeneously distributed through the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag, favoring the rapid and efficient H2 generation from the NaBH4 decomposition [2]. In order to investigate the versatility of the catalyst prepared in this work and to widen its range of applicability, NaBH4 decomposition reactions were performed using different alcoholic solvents such as methanol (MetOH), ethanol (EtOH), and isopropanol (PropOH). These small alcohols are considered eco-friendly solvents, being largely used in organic synthesis [71]. The H2 generation rate data collected from the alcoholysis reactions were compared to those collected in water, and all of them are put together in Fig. 12 . Overall, the reaction mechanism using these solvents is similar to that observed in water, since the selected solvents are protic (i.e., hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen atom), and the reaction by-products also are harmless [49]. According to the data depicted in Fig. 12, the H2 generation profile for the alcoholysis reactions is similar to the hydrolysis, but some differences can be noted. Overall, the H2 generation rate is faster as the polarity of the medium increases. Such behavior is clearly noted when the kapp values, which were estimated by using Eq. (4), are examined (Fig. S8). The kapp value was higher for MetOH (4.70 × 10−2 min−1) than for EtOH (4.51 × 10−2 min−1) and PropOH (4.30 × 10−2 min−1). However, the H2 generation was still faster in water (6.40 × 10−2 min−1). Photographic images showing the evolution of H2 gas from each tested reaction can be found in the Supporting Information (Fig. S9). Overall, this trend could be understood because the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag film has several functional groups available on its surface to interact with the solvent molecules. Thus, the contact between the AgNPs and the reactants (NaBH4 and the solvent molecules) is favored by the film nature. Since water is the most polar solvent, the functional groups on the film can easily interact with this solvent, and the reaction proceeds in a fast way. Besides, the solubility of the NaBH4 is also enhanced in more polar solvents [49]. Indeed, as the polarity of the medium increases in the following order PropOH < EtOH < MetOH, the H2 generation rate became faster, which corroborates the kapp data. It should be highlighted that the H2 generation efficiency achieved with the use of the novel catalyst (GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag) was higher as 90% (for all tested solvents), confirming its versatility. Additionally, the same GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film showed a remarkable catalytic activity for at least ten consecutive H2 generation reactions (reuse experiments) performed in aqueous and non-aqueous media. Even after ten successive reactions, the H2 generation efficiency did not drop below 95% for all tested solvents (Fig. S10). These results suggest that the thin film stabilizes the AgNPs efficiently, as well as, strong adhesion occurs between the rGO-CMCHT layer and the substrate. MIP-OES analysis performed using aliquots collected from the reactions did not demonstrate the presence of leached Ag. As an additional advantage, the handling of the catalyst is straightforward. After each reaction, it was recovered and washed with water, oven-dried and, then reused in a new reaction. The simplicity related to the use, recovery, and reuse of this novel catalyst is desirable for practical purposes."
12,Catalytic hydrogenation of NB to AN,"3.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of NB to AN Another important application of molecular hydrogen is its use as a hydrogenation agent for several alkenes, alkynes, and nitro compounds to obtain valuable products and intermediates in organic synthesis [63]. Overall, hydrogenation reactions require H2 generated with considerable rate and yield, which is usually achieved by using metallic catalysts. The experimental results described in the previous section strongly suggest that the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film catalyzes at the same time the H2 generation and the hydrogenation reaction. As a proof of concept, the catalytic activity of the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film towards the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (NB) to aniline (AN) was investigated in aqueous (water) and non-aqueous (MetOH, EtOH and PropOH) media. This reaction is widely reported as a model hydrogenation reaction, and the conversion rate can be monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Typically, this reaction does not occur in the absence of a catalyst [72]. This statement was confirmed by control experiments that were performed in the absence of the catalyst. In this case, the UV–Vis absorption spectra of NB did not exhibit any significant change up to the end of the experiments (data not showed). Conversely, the characteristic band of the AN arises around 230 nm for the reactions performed in the presence of the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag. Simultaneously, the typical absorption band of NB (~265 nm) disappears from the spectra recorded from all tested reactions (see Fig. 13 ). Further, the AN absorption spectrum also exhibited a shoulder approximately at 279 nm, which was also reported previously [72]. The conversion efficiency of NB to AN according to the solvent decreased in the following order: water (93.2 ± 2.7%) > MetOH (81.4 ± 2.4%) > EtOH (75.1 ± 5.6%) > PropOH (69.0 ± 1.1%). Again, the reaction efficiencies varied according to the solvent polarity. The best results were obtained to the reactions performed in high polarity media, which is consistent with the results found to the H2 generation. Since the H2 acts as the hydrogenation agent in the conversion of NB to AN, it is consensus that a high concentration of H2 in the medium could enhance reaction efficiency. The NB hydrogenation mechanism using this kind of heterogeneous reaction system has several complex steps, which are mainly based on a hydrogen spillover process [72]. Commonly, the freshly generated H2 molecule is activated on one catalytic site (AgNPs) on the surface of the catalyst, while the catalytic hydrogenation occurs on another site. Thus, the split of the hydrogen atom (as H−) needs to travel from the first catalytic site to the second. In this scenario, the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag film has a crucial role in the hydrogen atom transfer due to its highlighted electronic properties [72]. In summary, the results described here are consistent evidence that this novel hybrid thin film shows a dual ability to catalyze two reactions at the same time. Most important, the catalytic efficiencies towards the H2 generation and hydrogenation reactions are kept for aqueous and non-aqueous reaction media."
13,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a novel heterogeneous catalyst based on reduced graphene oxide grafted with carboxymethyl chitosan (rGO-CMCHT) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was prepared as a thin film to act as a catalyst in H2 generation from NaBH4 decomposition reactions. Firstly, rGO-CMCHT was synthesized by an environmental-friendly and straightforward approach, where CMCHT was grafted on the rGO sheets. As assessed, the synthesized hybrid compound exhibits interesting electric properties (i.e., lower resistivity to electron mobility) due to its small energy gap (Eg ). Also, the functional groups available on their structure have a leading role in immobilizing and stabilizing AgNPs. The thin film (GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag) was readily prepared by deposition on a glass substrate via a dip-coating technique. Experimental results toward the H2 generation from NaBH4 decomposition demonstrated that the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film has an impressive catalytic activity, which allows boosting the H2 generation rate (in aqueous and non-aqueous media). The pronounced catalytic ability of this thin film was not observed for other thin films prepared for comparison. Synergistic effects between rGO-CMCHT and AgNPs confer to the catalyst a singular performance. As compared to other catalysts used in H2 generation reactions, the TOF and MRF values calculated to the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film were comparable or superior. Reuse experiments demonstrated that the GL/rGO-CMCHT@Ag thin film could be reused for at least ten consecutive NaBH4 decomposition reactions (under different media) without impairs the H2 generation rate significantly. Also, it was demonstrated that the catalyst could also be used for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. All these finds suggest that this novel thin film prepared with rGO-CMCHT and AgNPs is a promising catalyst for energy-based applications and/or for the synthesis of hydrogenated organic compounds."
