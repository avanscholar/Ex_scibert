0,Introduction,"The continuous flow of the blood in veins is vital for the healthy body. Similarly, the uninterrupted supply of the clean energy is required to power the good living standard, high economic growth, political stability and clean enviornment. Hydrogen gas is counted as the one of the most efficient and clean fuel [1]. However, most of the current hydrogen production based on utilising the carbonaceous sources i.e. methane, which perturbs the earth's environment by releasing green house gases (GHGs). Therefore, a carbon-neutral source of hydrogen is required for getting clean energy and for sustaining the good health of the earth. Abundantly available water might be a suitable candidate and eco-benign source for the hydrogen production. The electrolysis of water is the most commonly used technique for breaking of water and for producing hydrogen. A polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) cell (with the efficiency 70-82%) are used to generate the hydrogen gas by electrolysis, in which 1 Kg hydrogen production required ~39.72 kWh/Kg specific energy [1] (two times higher than the same of the solid fuels i.e. 13.89 MJ/Kg) that can be generated from 50–55 kWh electricity supply [2]. But the electricity produced by ustilising the conventional fuels also releases natorious GHGs. Therefore, we are looking for the ecofriendly way of breaking water for hydrogen production. In this view, the solar energy in associastion with the photocatalyst is a ecofriendly way of water splitting. Consequently, the copious account of the heterogeneous photocatalysts (metal alloys, oxides, caron-rich materials, chalcogenides, or inorganic perovskite, etc) are used for water splitting. However, carbon-rich materials such as carbon nanotubes, carbon nitrides, and graphene-based materials had attracted great attention of material scientists due to their invincible properties. The highly fascinating optoelectronic properties of graphenes, made them the superior candidate over the other materials of same class, which are the result of their free sp 2 electron-rich 2D-carbonaceous framework, low bandgaps, high surface area, good mechanical stability, and high electronic mobility of graphitic materials [3]. Above characteristics made them the choiciest material to be used in the fields of sensors, catalysis, adsorption, biotechnology, medical, energy conversion and storage, and many more. Moreover, a large number of graphitic materials are used in water splitting. Few of the state of arts examples of this class are mentioned in Table 1 . Therefore, we focused on developing a marvel material by using GO for efficient hydrogen production by photocatalytic splitting of water. The phosphor is a most abundant element of the earth's crust. And phosphates has attracted a considerable attention of researchers because of their reasonably good strength of the active sites on their surfaces. Monophosphate/orthophosphates are demonstrated an anionic PO4 3− group, which possess a regular tetrahedral structure and well-known for their infinite chains like structures: (PnO3n+1)−(n+2), (PnO3n)−(n) and (P(2m+n)O(5m-3n))−(n) [12] and thermal stability. These chain-like structures of metal phosphates can easily be spread over the GO layers to provoke open pathways for fast ion migration than 1D network through the inductive effect of the PO4 3- (causes a quite higher redox couple) that results in good ionic conductivity for the transition metals oxides [13–15]. Metal phosphates systems are prone to mimic the basic principles of the natural enzymatic catalysis process, wherein the weak interaction such as electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the functional group are the dominating factors. Furthermore, nickel-based materials are quite popular as a catalyst due to their lower cost and their superior activity and stability with maximum tunability (Nobel Laureate Paul Sabatier declared the nickel-metal as a spirited horse) [16]. Moreover, the nickel catalysis plays a prominent role in many synthetic transformations reactions ranging from cross-coupling reactions in which carbon-carbon bonds are formed to reduce the electron-rich carbon bonds [17]. So, the low cost conductive additives (carbon materials such as carbon black, graphite, carbon nanotubes, and graphene) can be added to explore good conductivity in nickel compounds. Graphene sheets can provide the best support for generating a conducive atmosphere for nickel phosphates (NPO). Therefore, we had selected nickel phosphate based graphenes for photocatalytic water splitting, where phosphate ion act as bridging groups between graphene oxide sheets and metal precursor [18]. The PO4 3− units of NPO tithered with the hydrophilic part of GO. The tetrahedral geometry and the strong affinity of phosphates towards the metal ions results in the higher thermal and chemical stability in NPO than their organic counterparts. So, the composite of NPO and GO leads to a promising materials can show the superior catalytic capacities to metal oxides [19]. Therefore, we had fabricated nickel phosphate embedded graphene oxides for water splitting purpose."

Afterward diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DHP; 2mmol) was dropwise added to the above solution. Thereafter the mixture was kept for 2h aging at RT. Then the slurry was exposed to direct sunlight (12.00 pm to 1.00pm) irradiation for 1h. The solution was filtered and washed several times with DIW and dried in air oven at 70°C for overnight, resulted in a light green crystals."

In which, the graphite powder (2g) and NaNO3 (1g) were added to 36N H2SO4 (46mL) in a 500mL beaker and stirred for 15 min in an ice bath, followed by the slowly addition of KMnO4 (6g) to the above mixture. The resulted solution was stirred and mixed well with distilled water (92mL) for 2h at RT and allowed to settled down for 30min, followed by stirring for 1h after addition of distill water (280mL) and 30% H2O2 (20mL). Then the suspension was washed several times with water till the pH 7 of the solution attained. The GO exfoliation was made by mild sonication of solution for 30min at RT. As synthesized dark brown powder of GO was dried in an air oven at 60°C for overnight."
5,Synthesis of nanocomposite (GO:NPO),"2.4 Synthesis of nanocomposite (GO:NPO) The nanocomposites of graphene oxide and NiPO4 were prepared by taking the different ratio of GO:NPO (i.e. 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 075, 01.00, 1.25, 1.50 and 2.00) by dispersion of 2g GO in 100 mL distilled water and resulting solution sonicated for 1h to get homogeneous dispersion. Aforesaid dispersion was augmented with 3mmol NiNO3.6H2O and dropwise addition of 2mmol DHP to form a greenish–brown precipitation, and after complete precipitation, the mixture was aged for 2h and exposed to direct sunlight for 1h. Then, the solution was filtered and washed with DIW, the resulted powder was dried at 70°C for overnight heating in the oven. The photoreduced RGO–Ni3(PO4)2 heterojunction was a consequence of the following process [Eqs.

Afterwards the sample was kept in oven for one hour.
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesized nanocomposites was observed by using diffractometer (Rikagu Ultima IV type II model) establishe at IIT, Kanpur and University of Kota, Kota, in the range of 2θ = 5-60o at 45mA current and 30 mV voltage supply. All investigations are made by using the copper target (Cu Kα radiation) and ultrafast detector in reflection mode. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the series of GO:NPO composites were studied by using FESEM microscope (SEM; JEOL, JEM 2100) and FESEM supported EDS (Oxford instrumentation) analyses, respectively at MNIT, Jaipur. FTIR spectra of the samples were observed using IR spectroscope (PerkinElmer, G-FTIR) of MNIT, Jaipur, India. UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer (bench-top Model, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 750, USA) with double-beam and double-monochromatic provison used for examining the UVVis spectra at MNIT, Jaipur. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of nanocomposites were detected through a JEOL JES-FA200 X-band (~ 9 GHz) spectrometer under Helium gas was used as an exchange gas at 100 Torr at University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan. The g-factor and line width of the ESR signals were calibrated using a standard Mn2+ marker sample. The calibration of the g-factor was performed using a software program from the JEOL ESR system considering high second-order correction for the effective resonance field. The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: sweep time of 2.0 min.; center field of 319.5 mT; sweep width of 7.5 mT; modulation frequency of 100 kHz; modulation width of 0.08 mT and microwave power of 0.5 mW. To minimize experimental errors, the same quartz tube was used for all ESR measurements. The ESR spectrometer was coupled to a computer for data acquisition and instrument control. ESR supported density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for spin density calculation on 1.00 GO:NPO sample using the software Gaussian 09. Raman spectroscopic measurements were made on dual wavelength micro-Raman spectrometer (DXR, Thermo Scientific) at the 5 seconds exposure rate at 532nm excitation wavelength. All studied samples show a non-saturating status. The steady state photoluminescence Emission (PLE) spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer (LS-55) Fluorescence Spectrometer at MNIT, Jaipur. The composites were dispersed in distill water and were excited at 407nm for observing the corresponding emission spectra. The time-resolved PL emission was recorded at 407 nm excitation using magic angle polarization using a commercial TCSPC setup (LifeSpec-II, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) of IIT, Kanpur. 10 mm quartz cuvette has been used for steady-state and time-resolved PLE experiments. Ex-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopic study of the GO:NPO series was performed at Ni K-edge (8340eV), P K- edge (2150eV), C K-edge (284eV) and O K-edge (532eV), respectively at beamline BL20A of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.7 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The GO:NPO nanocomposites (0.3 g) were stirrered well with 120 mL of aqueous methanol (20% CH3OH of pH=7.0), kept in a reaction cell (volume ~150 mL, Pyrex glass) with water jacket (to maintain the reaction temperature 25°C). Reaction cell was air sealed with a rubber septum and plastic wire lock. Suspention of nanocomposite was purged with Ar gas for 1h by keeping cell pressure 1 atmosphere to expel the air. Subsequently, the suspension was exposed to the 300 W Xe lamp (>420 nm, light intensity 1 ×1021 photons per hour Xe lamp-HX1, ISS- Model PE300UV). The gaseous products generated as a result of all photocatalytic reactions, was hourly monitored for 3h. As produced gases were collected over the inverted gas collection graduated cylinder by displacement of water from a water fill. The gaseous products were subjected to be tested with the gas chromatograph (Shimazdu, TCD and molecular sieve of 5 A columns)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Morphological changes with increasing GO content in GO:NPO composite,"3.1 Morphological changes with increasing GO content in GO:NPO composite Here, we synthesized the nanocomposite of graphene oxide and NiPO4 (GO: NPO) by mixing nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate with GO [20] in different proportions (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 075, 01.00, 1.25, 1.50, and 2.00) and by exposing the mixture to natural sunlight for 1h. With the increasing ratio of GO in composite the morphology of the samples changes, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . As synthesized GO:NPO nanocomposites are morphological analysesed through FESEM images, elemental mapping images, their corresponding EDX profile and elemental compositions, as shown by Fig.s S1(i)a- S1(i)c to- S1(ix)a- S1(ix)c, Fig.s S2, Fig. S3 and Table TS1. Pure NPO crystallized in a marigold flower shape but the composites showed the layered structures of GO loaded with NPO. With increasing GO content in GO:NPO composites, the nickel and phosphorus percentage concentration gradually decreasing along with increasing the carbon content in composite. The 1.00 GO:NPO (Fig. S2a-S2f and Table TS1) sample exhibited the highest carbon content in their layered structure along with the few rod-like fixtures that did not observed in other samples. Moreover, the elemental mapping images of 1.00 GO:NPO composite revealed that the GO surfaces are sparsely populated with NPO particles, which might lessen the chances of recombination of the charge carriers due to an appropriate distance between the active centers on the surface. These properties make them more active for photocatalytic water splitting."
11,Crystallography of GO:NPO composite,"3.2 Crystallography of GO:NPO composite The XRD profiles of the series of the GO:NPO nanocomposite (pure NPO, 0.25 GO:NPO, 0.50 GO:NPO, 0.75 GO:NPO, 1.00 GO:NPO, 1.25 GO:NPO, 1.50 GO:NPO, and 2.00 GO:NPO), are shown in Fig. S4a (before water splitting) and Fig. S4b (after water splitting). The composite contains two prominent phases i.e. GO, and nickel phosphate. First, GO phase exhibited a prominent reflection along 001 planes at 2θ =11.50°(belonging to graphite-like carbon (001) plane (JCPDS no. 75-1621)) with an interplanar distance d001 of GO~0.80 nm, attributed to the oxygenated functional groups (C=O, C-O-C, COOH, OH group-containing oxidized regions of GO with sp3-carbon), and structural defects [21]. The diffraction pattern observed for the 001 planes of GO towards a higher angle side of the range (2θ =7−12°) of (001) plane, which indicates the lower amount of residual water intercalated in the basal planes of GO [22]. On careful observation a weak (002) plane- diffraction was found at 2θ=26.54° with interplanar distance d002~0.334nm due to the nonoxidized (sp2-carbon) regions of GO phases that represents the presence of rGO phase. The weak diffraction pattern observed along (002) plane, represents the low reduction of GO. The reflections observed at 2θ =30.00-34.00o, 42.79 o and 78.00o are associated with the third Ni3(PO4)2 phase (orthorhombic (63); standard JCPDS card No: 71-115) with the lattice parameters a=4.76Å, b=4.76Å, c=6.41Å, α=90.00°, β=90.00°, γ=66.25°, volume=145.59 Å3 , space group Cmcm (C 2/m 2/c 21/m) and point group mmm [23]. The XRD study reflected the gradual increase in graphene oxide in GO:NPO composite, resulted in the gradual enhancement in the peak at 2θ=11.5o and diluting of the NPO peaks of the composite. The highly distorted NiO6 octahedra loaded on GO layers through their corners that connected with the cross-linked distorted PO4 3− tetrahedra site, which are not directly linked with phosphate site via hydrogen bonding [24]. Almost the same XRD patterns (Fig. S3b) were obtained for the post-photocatalysis -operated composites, pure NPO and GO samples except the few Pt refelections (standard JCPDS: 70–2057 (111), (200) and (220) due to Pt-loading before photocatalytic reactions) [25] that confirmed the stability of the composites, pure GO and NPO phases under the water and light exposure."
12,Electronic structure of GO:NPO composite,"3.3 Electronic structure of GO:NPO composite 3.3.1 UV-Vis spectroscopic study The UV-Vis spectra of the series of GO:NPO composites with their pure counter parts are exhibited by Fig. 2 a. The spectra possess three major peaks, centered at (i) 250nm (weak), (ii) 400nm (strong), and (iii) 550nm to 800nm (a broad first excitonic peak). Peaks around 250nm, attributed to n-π* electronic transitions (O2−(2p)-→Ni2+(2þ)) between the conjugated double bonds of the basal plane of GO and NPO [26,27]. One major absorption band found in the visible region with maxima at 411nm, attributed to the electronic transition from O2−(2p) to Ni2+(3d) orbital and credited to the tetrahedral structure of Ni ions [28,29]. Furthermore, the broad peak around 550nm to 800nm belongs to the octahedral structure of Ni ions [30,31]. The first excitonic peak observed due to the d-d transition/ charge transfer [32] between the loaded nickel phosphate species and GO plane. A small peak detected at 305 nm attributed to the n - π* transitions, exhibited due to the presence of C-O-C or C-OOH bonding,belongs to graphene oxide. The high energy absorption band for this GO:NPO composite represent the dominanting tetrahedral coordination of Ni and their phosphonic linkages with composite network. The optical absorption spectra obtained for the studied samples with a broad and asymmetrical absorption that contributed by the multiple energy transitions. Which can be explained in terms of the overlapping of the two or three component absorption bands [33]. The defects manifested as the reduced nickel metal centres in basal plane of graphene oxide, might evident as a distinguish broad absorption peak at red wavelengths that risen up to the near IR [34,35]. In comparison to the pure NPO, all other peaks show a hyperchromic effect due to the distorted molecular geometry (supported by XRD, Raman, FTIR study and ESR supported DFT calculations) [24]. The composites:1.25 GO:NPO and 2.00 GO:NPO, show a hyperchromic effect and the rest of the composites show a hypochromic effect with respect to the pure GO. Furthermore, the compound 1.00 GO:NPO exhibited the highest degree of distortion with respect to the pristine GO sample (Fig. S4), which is also confirmed by FESEM images (Figs. 1, S1 and S2). The optical band gap Eg was calculated by using the Kubelka-Munk relationship in UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectral study (Fig. 2b and Fig. S5) and Equation 4 [36]. (4) Kubelka-Munk function F(R) = K/S = (1-R)2 /2R …. A graphical presentation of (K/S* hν)2 Vs hν, (Fig. 2d) used to calculate the band gap by the extrapolation of the linear region of the (K/S* hν)2 against the photon energy hν plots at (K/S* hν)2 = 0. The values of band gaps are listed in Table 3. The multiple band gaps for the pure nickel phosphate was calculated using diffuse reflectance spectra Kubleka Munk plots i.e. 4.52, 3.48, 2.68 eV, which is consistent with reported value i.e. 3.04 eV [37]. Their corresponding valance band and conduction band positions of the energy levels of the composites was determined by using the following empirical Eq. (5) and exhibited by Fig. 2c [38]: (5) ECB=XNPO−EC−1/2*Eg ..... Where, the absolute electronegativity of the element XE=1/2*[EEA+EIP], absolute electronegativity of composite XNPO = (Xa Ni+Xb P+Xc O)1/a+b+c, and EVB=Eg-ECB ECB= conduction band energy position(lower), EVB= valance band energy position(upper), EA = electron affinity of the element, EIP=first ionisation potential, EC=Energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV i.e. kinetic energy of hydrogen) and Eg= corresponding band gap and a, b, and c are the number of atoms, present in the compound. Therefore, the ECB and EVB of the solid solution were measured versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The corresponding conduction band (CB) and valance band (VB) positions (Fig. 2c) of the NPO for the band gap 4.52eV are estimated as :ECB=-0.64 eV and EVB=3.88 eV, for the band gap 3.48eV are ECB=-0.12 eV and EVB=3.36 eV and for the band gap 2.68eV are ECB=+0.28 eV and EVB=2.96 eV. Due to the unknown number of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in GO, the band positions for GO can not be experimentally calculated. 3.3.2 FTIR spectroscopic study FTIR analysis is an outstanding investigation tool for the study of phosphate-chemistry through the stretching and bending vibration of the chemical bonds. Figs. 2e (pre-water splitting) and 2f (post water splitting), illustrated the FTIR profile of the pure GO, pristine NPO and all GO-NPO composites within the wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The infrared band υ1 around 3450 cm−1, belongs to the water-hydroxyl stretching region of the composite [39]. Where, the IR spectral-bands -υ2 and -υ3 located in the region 3100−2500 cm−1 (alcohol and carboxylic acid stretching), assigned to non-equivalent water molecules that give rise to in-phase and out-of-phase stretching behavior (Fig. 2e, Fig. 2f and Table 2) to the basal plane of GO [39]. Infrared bands located in the range 1750−1725 cm−1, associated with the saturated υC=O stretching vibration, which is absent here. Aromatic C=C /υ(C=O) bond streching of unoxidized sp2 carbon domain and δ1(H2O) bending vibrations revealed as IR bands at 1660−1600 cm−1 region, sp3 δ2C−H weak bending vibration occurred at 1400 cm−1 [40]. A characteristic symmetric υ4C-O stretching band observed at 1240 cm−1, represents the stretching vibration of C–O-H (due to phenols, ethers, and epoxy groups) and bridged P-O-P bonds (that limits the basal movement). Antisymmetric stretching modes of PO4 3− [41] with the free υ4P-O band and C−O−C axial deformation responsible for the strong FTIR spectral features at 1077 cm−1 [42]. Similarly, the shoulder band υ5 observed around 885 cm−1 attributed to 2O–P–2O symmetric stretching [43], P–O–H bending vibrations [44], C−H aliphatic deformation vibration, residual oxygen, and functional carbon. The bending vibration of a water molecule appeared at 740 cm−1 (δ3-H2O). The IR bands observed aaround 560-585 cm−1 are assigned to δ4 (Ni-O, C−C stretching vibrations, and symmetric bending mode of PO4 3−) band that show blue shift that confirm the minimum loading of NPO for 1.00GO:NPO composites that might act as catalyst for breaking/ reduction of GO plane. The study reveals the presence of NiO4 tetrahedra, NiO6 octahedra, and PO4 tetrahedra in the composite, which are not regular feature as they shared corners and edges of above [45]. Moreover, the FTIR spectra revealed by the Figs. 2e and 2f exhibits the presence of the −OH, C=O, C=C, C−O−C, C−O, C−H, C−C, PO4 3−, and Ni-O, etc, on the GO surface and shifting in IR band around 1070 cm−1 towards the lower frequency region with gradual increase in GO amount in composite, ensured the tethering of NPO to GO through PO4 group and Ni–O band [46,47]. Post application IR analysis of composite are represented by the Fig. 2f that did not show any significant changes, confirm the stability of composite phase. Minimum sized -multiple υ2 and υ3 peaks found for 1.00 GO:NPO composite, exhibited the lower content of COOH, -OH groups in comparision to the rest of the studied samples, confirmed the rich carbon content in composite. Furthermore, on increasing GO content in composite, the IR peak υ4 (due to PO4 3- & Ni-O-P in the region1010 to 800 cm−1), not only exhibits the red shift but it also show multiple divisions (specially the 1.00 GP:NPO composite). Both of above factors might contributed to the broken honey comb skeleton of GO that resulted by the reduction in number of COOH, C-O-C, etc bonds, which might increases the carbon content of the composite. 3.3.3 Steady state photolumeniscence study The PL emission signals used to acquire the information about the trapping of charge carriers, interfacial migration/ transportation of the photogenerated charge pair in materials. The photoluminescence spectra of the pure NPO, pure GO and their composites are shown by Fig. 3 a (steady state PL), recorded at 407 nm excitation for the aqueous despersion of the GO:NPO composites. The studied samples exhibits the two emission bands at 460nm (strong; blue emission) and 575 nm (medium; green emission). These multicolored (blue and green) emissions are representative of the existence of a many intermediate states within band gap and relaxation process occured through various paths. The peaks centred around 460nm were related to the radiative recombination of charge carriers linked to the spin allowed transitions i.e. 3T2g(P)→ 3A2g (F) and 3T1g (P) → 3A2g (F), respectively [48]. The PL peak around 575 nm assigned to various type of defects (i.e. cation vacancy, cation antisite, oxygen vacancy, oxygen antisite, cation interstitial, and oxygen interstitial). If the visible photoluminescence observed by the material without any activator ion, attributed to the presence of defects (in most cases due to the oxygen vacancies). The jumping of one electron from a neutral VO state, resulted in a Vo 1+ O- defect(leads to green emission). Furthermore, removal of one more electron from VO state, generates Vo 2+ O- defect (leads to blue emission) [49] Therefore, the electronic transitions between CB and O-defect states (Vo 1+and Vo 2+ defects near VB) in addition to the impurity states at the bottom of the CB, lead to emissions in the green and blue regions [49]. The PL emission represents the recombination between holes and the excited electrons, and a lower PL intensity emission is probably due to a lower recombination rate under the light irradiation [50]. Therefore, the sample 1.00 GO:NPO shows the shortest PL peak, confirms the lowest defect concentration in composite with respect to the other studied samples. The schematic representation of the dual emission mechanism along with hydrogen production is illustrated in Fig. 10. 3.3.4 Time Resolved Photoluminescence Spectroscopy The time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy focused on giving information about the lifetime of excitons and recombination dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers from the decay curves and the well-fitted data with a exponential function, expressed by the Eq. (6) and average decay life time expressed by Eq. (7) [51]. (6) I(t)=ΣAie−t/τi ….. (7) And average decay life time τavg=ΣAiτi 2/ΣAiτi ….. Where, I(t) = intensity, τi is the photoluminescence decay time and Ai is relative magnitudes of τi. Furthermore, we had investigated the TRPL spectra of samples at 407 nm excited by a 532 nm laser, illustrated by Fig. 3b. The declining PL intensity with time indicates the quenching of photogenerated carriers owing to the recombination process. Table 3 and Table TS2, show the τavg values of life time of the photocarriers, which correspond to the photoluminescence of the free exciton states. The increase in GO content of composite leads to the decreased decay life time τ(avg) till 0.75 GO:NPO sample then an increase in life time was observed for 1.00GO:NPO (9.3ps),which further exhibits the decay in life time till 1.25 GO:NPO then further increase was found for 1.50 GO:NPO and 2.00GO:NPO samples. The relatively slow photoluminescence decay dynamics can be elucidated by the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type of recombination process for the holes and trapped electrons as well as diffusion of excited charge carrier [52]. The luminescence decay plot is an indicative of the presence of two major types of defect centre (typical of oxygen vacancy-related defects with lifetime value of the order of 6.49–26.74 ps) at different levels. The deep defects corresponds to the green emission, while the blue emission arises due to the shallow defects near to the conduction band. Speciously, the peak position of the PL spectra of the composites is subject to the sp2 structures (strongly associated with the C=C, C-OH and COOH (or C=O) functional groups) and oxygen containing functional groups [53]. The red shift in emission bands are indicative of the differences in relaxation time, associated with the solvation process of a polar solvent like water [54]. 3.3.5 Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is the most effective method to study the spin states in an electronic material. Fig. 4 a and Table TS3 shows the ESR spectra and obsertvation conditions of the pristine NPO and GO:NPO composites, observed at 300 K. Their studied parameters: g-factor, ΔH pp, number of spins, mass, spin concentration, and line shape of the pristine NPO and GO:NPO nanocomposites are exhibited by Table 4 . Pristine NPO did not show any ESR signal that refelected the diamagnetic behavior of the material with all paired electrons. The g–factor values of the composites are well correlated with the pure carbon ESR signal range (g=2.0022–2.0035) except the sample 1.00 GO:NPO (g=2.00469), which also exhibited the highest spin concentration 3.46 × 1018 spins per g, dedicated to carbon-related dangling bonds of S = ½ spin in GO lattice [55]. Two symmetric and isotropic ESR signals with zero-crossing g-factor values are observed for the all samples. The study also revealed the occurrence of two distinct Lorentzian components in ESR spectra, because of intrinsic C-related types of defects. ESR signals with the Lorentzian shape leads to the presence of the charge carriers in graphene oxide[49]. These mobile charge carriers contributed to the higher spin-orbital interaction that use to localize the spins. The high spin-orbital interaction causes the larger g-factor values for 1.00 GO:NPO sample, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table 4.. It also results in larger ΔHpp value for charge carriers at room temperature due to the incoherent electron-phonon scattering phenomena (through Elliott-Yafet (EY) spin relaxation mechanism) associated with the broadening of the ESR spectrum [56]. The maximum ESR linewidth observed for 1.00 GO:NPO sample that symbolizes the good charge transfer capacity of the sample. A decrease in ESR signal intensity observed with an increase in GO content of the composites till 1.00 GO:NPO sample. Thereafter a gradual increase in intensity was observed with increasing GO component. Here, the maximum spin concentration exhibited by the 1.00 GO:NPO sample because of low defects in comparison to other samples. That also supported the good charge transfer capacity of the sample by suppressing the charge-carrier recombination possibility. Strong ESR signals attributed to the localized states (in form of atomic vacancies, adatoms, extrinsic impurities, etc.) and delocalized charge carriers [57]. 3.3.6 ESR-supported DFT spin density calculations The prominent graphitic geometrical structures (coronene (S=0), triangulane (S=1 / S=2), and a bowtie-shaped fragment (S=0)) are theoritically tested with ESR supported DFT spin density calculations. The ESR signals found only for triangulane structure of nanocomposite and no ESR signals found for coronene and bowtie-shaped geometry shapes of composites due to their spin quantum number (S=0). Therefore, the triangulane structure of nanocomposite 1.00 GO:NPO was processed for the DFT spin density mapping and spin population calculations by taking triangulane triplet (S =1) spin states. Three basis used for DFT calculation by using UB3LYP (unrestricted Becke'sexchange function three parameters hybrid with Lee, Yang, and Parr correlation functions) -3-21G-doublet, 6-31G+(d) and -STO3G-doublet functions. The accuracy in 3D structure of 1.00 GO:NPO is essential for the spin population calculation. Thus, the optimization of the composite was done for the molecular structure of triangulane GO-NiO4-PO4 at 3-21G-doublet, 6-31Gd-doublet, and STO3G-doublet, levels (Fig. 5 ) and for the triangulane structure GO-NiO6-PO4 at STO3G-doublet level. The corresponding spin density distribution of these states are calculated (2.3905, 2.4099 and 1.9776, and 2.1082) as shown in Figs. 5a-5h and Table 4. Isotropic g-factor were measured using the Gauge Independent Atomic Orbital method [58] by taking the average of the corresponding xx-, yy-, and zz- components (Table 5). The large g-value associated with the spin density localization of NPO not due to the graphene because Ni and P atoms are heavier than a carbon atom. In this case, spin-orbital interaction becomes large, which also enhanced the g-factor in DFT calculations. The average of g-factor of the three triangulane geometeries of GO-NiO4-PO4 -STO3G-doublet and one GO-NiO6-PO4-STO3G-doublet geometries is 2.0037, which are in close approximation to the experimental g-value (2.0046) of 1.00 GO:NPO. Therefore, it can be interpreted from DFT calculations of spin density that the sample 1:00 GO:NPO may possess three GO-NiO4-PO4 -STO3G-doublet geometrical and one GO-NiO6-PO4-STO3G-doublet geometrical -arrangement along the GO basal plane in a single unit. 3.3.7 Raman spectroscopy Raman spectral details of the pristine NPO, pure GO and the GO:NPO composites (0.25 GO:NPO, 0.50 GO:NPO, 0.75 GO:NPO, 1.00 GO:NPO, 1.25 GO:NPO, 1.50 GO:NPO, and 2.00 GO:NPO) are exhibited by the Figs. 4b and Table 6, which confirmed the formation of a composite. In looking to the Raman spectrum of the samples, composite 1.00 GO:NPO showed the exceptional behavior with respect to the other members of the series. All composites exhibited the major Raman bands positioned around the Raman shifts: 550, 777, 1075, and 2414 cm−1 along with two very weak peaks between the frequencies 1075 to 2414 cm−1, i.e. 1300 and 1500 corresponding to the D (first-order phonons) and the G peaks of GO/rGO, which was generated due to the sp3 and sp2 hybridization in carbonaceous materials, respectively. Intensity ratios of the peaks D and G define the degree of the defects that developed during the preparation process [59]. The integrated intensity ratio of D and G -bands offers the information about the structural/edge defects. Table 6 represents the ID/IG values for studied samples, which are consistent with the reported values i.e. 0.83 to 1.93 [60–61]. The Raman reflection at ~2414 cm−1 belongs to the 2D peaks (second-order phonons). The peak intensity ratios IG/I2D used to calculate the number of GOs layers. The calculated IG/I2D ratios are less than 2 that indicates the presence of the unimolecular layer of the graphene [61]in composite. The peak positioned at 500 cm−1, assigned to the NiO6 octahedra in stretching mode, which intensity increases with decreasing NPO content in the GO:NPO composite, confirmed the interaction of NPO with GO. The weak Raman bands near 500 cm−1 is a result of low concentration of NiO6 octahedra (in agreement with DFT calculations) and a strong Raman band near 1000 cm−1 associated with the Ni–O stretching mode of NPO [62–63]. The shoulder band at 500 cm−1, indicates the presence of the non-stoichiometry nickel oxide [63]. A new band near 770 cm−1 is observed for 0.50GO:NPO and 1.00GO:NPO spectra, are more intense than other spectra. These bands are attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of P–O–P/ P-O-Ni bridges, which is the fingerprint region of P2O7 4− oxoanions, formed due to the PO4 3− groups tethered GO [64–65]. The intensity of the band around 1075 cm−1 increases with increasing P content in the composite samples, suggesting the presence of PO4 3− groups on the NiO surface. The symmetric and asymmetric P–O stretching modes of the free PO4 3− oxoanion are located at 938 cm−1 and 1027 cm−1, respectively, and the stretching modes of the PO4 3− groups are expected to have similar frequencies [66]. The weak peaks at 435 and 585 cm−1 observed for the 1.00GO:NPO spectra, can be assigned to O–P–O symmetric and antisymmetric bending modes, respectively, with a small P vibrational contribution [61]. Above obsevations suggested the presence of the Ni supported pyrophosphate groups on GO surface with the lesser P content. 3.3.8 X-ray absorption analysis The chemical environment of the studied elements in composites and pristine samples are deliberated using X-ray absorption analyses (XANES: pre-edge, edge, and white line region) at K-edge of carbon, oxygen, nickel and phosphorus elements. In XANES spectra, pre-edge (weak) absorptions, appeared due to a quadrupole allowed dipole-forbidden excitation i.e. 1s to 3d (Δl = ±2) and used to estimate the ligand-field, spin-state, and centrosymmetric-state. Pre-edge intensity signifies the deviation from centrosymmetric and metal 3d-4p orbital mixing. The pre-edge intensity pattern is dependent on a) spin-state, b) oxidation-state, c) ligand field splitting and d) multiplet effects. Metal K-edge absorptions are dipole allowed (Δl = ±1) and rising-edge region used to calculate the geometric structure, metal-ligand overlap via shakedown transitions, ligand arrangement in certain cases, and charge on the metal center. The white line of the XANES region used to define the anisotropy in arrangement. 3.3.8.1 Ni K-edge XANES The atomic and molecular orbital energy positions (i.e. peaks and shoulders observed in the Ni K-edge XANES spectra) of the Ni in pristine NPO and GO:NPO composites are shown in Fig. 6 a and Fig. S6. The Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the composite samples demonstrated the five peaks (including shoulders), as a small and broad pre-edge absorption peak (feature A at 8333.083 eV; due to (i) a quadrupole component of 1s(Ni)→3d(Ni) excitations, and (ii) a small dipolar component of 3d(Ni atom)-2p(O atom) hybridization. A1s(Ni)→3d(Ni)), edge (the edge feature (absorption jump) at 8344.057 eV; 1s(Ni)→ 4p(Ni), the white line peak (features B at 8349.208 eV; 4p(Ni)→ 3d(Ni)), followed by a small shoulder (feature C at 8365.333 eV; 1s→4p), a broad absorption peak (feature D at 8398.69 eV) due to multiple scattering and very broad feature E at 8482.238 eV due to the single scattering in EXAFS region. Although, the pre-edge feature A is Laporte forbidden case due to the mixing of the Gerade symmetric 1s electrons of Ni with 3d/4p electrons of the Ni and but overlapping of the Ni 3d orbital with 2p orbitals of the oxygen of phosphate [67–69], is dipole-allowed. The small-sized pre-edge peak observed in Fig. 6a for the GO:NPO composites because of the minimal distortion (no degeneracy and no Jahn Teller distortion) and centrosymmetric (e.g. octahedral symmetry) pure quadrupole transition, where the mixing of metal 4p and 3d orbitals are forbidden [67]. Broad peak reflected the octahedral arrangement of the elements around the Ni metal. That resulted in the six-coordinated Ni (octahedral) without any non-centrosymmetric arrangements (e.g. tetrahedral (Td ) geometry). The main absorption edge jump attributed to a 1s→ 4p electronic transition that jumps to the white line feature B[68]. No change in edge position of the composites, accounts for the same oxidation states of the Ni ion present in all nanocomposites. Sharp white line peak B attributed to the octahedral arrangement of elements around the Ni element. In the Ni K-edge XANES spectra the dipolar originated peak A´ (Fig. S6) is of nonlocal nature, caused by hybridization (Ni 4p-3d mixing via strong Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization) of empty 4p states of on-site Ni with empty 3d states of the Ni atoms situated at the fourth coordination shell [69] and contributed to the 180◦ Ni-O-Ni antiferromagnetic interactions. Due to the nonlocal origin of the feature A´, its position is insensitive to the core-hole attraction and, thus, the A-to-A´ peak separation can be used to estimate the value (Fig. 6c) of the charge transfer gap (5.2062, 5.1142, 5.095, 5.083, 6.089, 6.0067, 5.78, and 5.438 eV for the pure NPO, 0.25GO:NPO, 0.50 GO:NPO, 0.75GO:NPO, 1.00GO:NPO, 1.25GO:NPO, 1.50GO:NPO and 2.00GO:NPO, respectiviely) in GO:NPO composite which is in good correlation with the reported value (5.5 eV) for GO [70]. The substantial gradual red shifts in the energy position of the feature B observed for composites with increasing GO content. The structural water might increase the coordination number around Ni by increasing the main-edge crest in the Ni K-edge XANES spectrum [67]. The shoulder of white line peak B (denoted as C) indicate the formation of a well-ordered crystal structure with first O atom shell around Ni atom, which consequently changes the chemical environment (high O2– in compared with OH–) of Ni. Ahead of the shoulder C of white line peak, feature D (Fig. 6a) associated with the multiple scattering by the next nearest oxygen neighbors (second shell of O atoms taken in to account) and indicates the similar Ni–O bonding environment [71]. A broad and weak feature E, attributed to the third shell of O atom around Ni atom. 3.3.8.2 C K-edge XANES The carbonaceous content of the composites is identified by their C K-edge XANES patterns, exhibited by the Fig. 6b, Fig S7a and S7b with energy region 280-320 eV. The overall C K-edge spectra demonstrated the presence of the honeycomb carbon network of graphene oxide. XANES C K -edge profile of the studied samples included three main peaks: (i) 286.48 eV (A: quinines;sp2 hybridized carbon; 1s→π* (C=C)), (ii) 289.70 eV (B: white line peak; 1s → σ(C-H) / 1s→ π* (C=O)) and (iii) 292.99 eV and 293.80 eV (C: excitonic peak; 1s→ σ* (C-C)) [49]. Besides above-mentioned peaks, two more minor and broad peaks are found at photon energy ~ 299.11 eV (sp3 hybridized carbon; 1s→σ1* (C=C) resonances) and 304.38 eV (sp3 hybridized carbon; 1s→σ2* (C=O) resonances) [72]. These peaks are responsible to double bonds in the honeycomb carbon network and carbonyl groups. Ratio π*/ σ* (~0.25) used to estimate the relative concentration of the sp2 domain in the sp3 matrix in GO, where the carbon atom attached to the oxygen gives the account of the degree of oxidation in GO. The observed intensity ratio of the σ and π resonances for the pure NPO is 4 with a sharp B and broad feature C of 20 eV width, associated with the four P=O bonds [73]. Lowest height of the whiteline peak for 1.00GO:NPO sample is a signature of the minimal defects. All spectra exhibited the relative abundance of the quinones and aromatic carbons in composites. Finally, a broadening of the π* exciton peak, vary from 1.0 eV in the spectrum of NPO to 3.0 eV (Fig. 6b) that confirms the reduced local order with an increasing amount of GO in the composite. The strong on-set photon energy of the σ* transition at 291.8 eV indicates about the core excitonic character of composites that go hand in hand with a good delocalization process [74]. With an increasing amount of GO in GO:NPO composites (Fig. 6b), the excitonic peak changes (initially decreases up to 0.75GO:NPO than start raising for 1.00GO:NPO afterwards decreases up to 2.00GO:NPO). The stronger excitonic peak observed for 1.00GO:NPO along with shortest white line peak, reflected the lower defects and higher-order arrangement in the composite. Afterward broadening of the σ2* (C=O) resonance reflected the lowering of the local order in composites and multiple-peaks composed of the layered regime of the GO [75]. The splitting in excitonic peak found only for the 1.00 NPO:GO sample with extra feature σ1*, associated with the autoionization spectrum, and σ2⁎ excitation, showed the presence of the multiple layers in composite [74]. 3.3.8.3 O K-edge XANES O K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is an emerging technique for studying the chemical environment around the bulk oxygen. Figs. 7 a and 7b represented the O K-edge spectrum of the studied pristine and composite samples. The O K-edge spectra exhibited the gradual development in oxidized regions of the compounds that comprised of two pre-edge A′ (COOH group, 1s→π* at 528.70 eV) [76,77], and A′′(C=O group bonded to an aromatic ring, 1s→ π * at 531.31 eV) components, originating from the COOH [78], edge component (C– O from epoxide, 1s→ π * at 534.35 eV) [79], The peak B belongs to π * resonance of the carbonyl group, fingerprint region C (white line peak; σ∗ states of O-H and C-O due to the basal phenolic groups, 1s→ σ * at 537.70 eV) [78,80] and extended peak D (shoulder peak; C=O group, 1s→ σ * at 542.65 eV) belongs to the σ * resonance of the carbonyl group [76,79,81] bonded to an aromatic ring, inherented by the graphene plane. Pristine NPO compound, possesses two prominent XANES peaks i.e. one pre-edge peak A at 531.53 eV (due to P=O group, 1s→ π *) and other white line peak B at photon energy ~537.66 eV (due to the basal phenolic groups O-H group, 1s→ σ *). The gradual increase in the GO content in GO:NPO composite, leads to the bifurcation of pre-edge peak (A’ and A’’) with blue shift and gradual increase in the shoulder peak D was observed. Close observation reveals the blue shift in O K edge XANES profile by incorporation of NPO with respect to the pure GO (A at 532.81 eV and B at 538.35 eV) [22], which is the signature of addition of bulky NPO to GO layer. In GO:NPO composites, the hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups bonded with the aromatic ring exist in the basal plane of GO and carboxylic (COOH) group attached to the edges of GO [79,81]. Furthermore, the fine structures of the oxygen K -edge spectra demonstrated the remarkably sharp, distinct features that suggested a locally ordered arrangement of oxygen atoms [82] in the pure NPO. Preedge peak A’ reported at the photon energy 528.0 eV due to the OH-group, reported for 1.25GO:NPO and 1.50GO:NPO samples [76,83]. Enhancement of GO amount in composite reduces the height of the white line peak due to the decrease in anisotropy (rather the composite 1.00 GO:NPO shows the highest anisotropy). But the gradual development of the shoulder peak D was observed with the increasing GO content in composite,assigned to the increase in carbonyl group bonded to an aromatic rings. Edge observed at around 534.0 eV, related to the p state of C– O bond of epoxide group [76], while peak C at 535.5 eV found in a fingerprint region of OH groups [77,79]. This finding demonstrates that NPO species hooked up with the aromatic graphene rings of the basal plane of GO, as previously argued by the line shape analysis of the C1s XANES spectra of GO [84]. 3.3.8.4 P K edge XANES The series of NPO:GO nanocomposites were observed for phosphorus K -edge XANES study (Figs. 8 a and 8b), in which GO content varies from the ratio 0.00 to 1.25 concerning NPO in the composites. Phosphorus K -edge XANES spectra are not observable for higher GO concentration composites i.e. 1.50 and 2.00 GO:NPO due to high carbon amount. The overall shapes of all observed spectra are almost similar with variable peak intensity and photon energy postions. The XANES spectra of the composites show six noticeable XAS reflections at 2149.81 eV (A: pre-edge; P(1s)→P(3d) and Ni(3d)), 2152.75 eV (B: white line; P(1s)→P(3p) and O(2p)), 2158.25 eV (C: continuum resonance; (1s)→ multiple scattering), 2164.25 eV (D: continuum resonance; (1s)→ multiple scattering), 2168.50 eV (E: continuum resonance; (1s)→ multiple scattering) and 2183.95 eV (F: continuum resonance; (1s)→ multiple scattering). The typical pre-edge feature A around 2149.00 eV, associated with the considerable covalent interaction of the cation (Ni+), and anion (PO4 3−) with graphene sheet. The origin of the pre-edge peak is the hybridization of P 3p electrons with the incomplete Ni 3d electronic layer of the conduction band (CB) associated with a PO-Ni bond / PO(OH)-Ni bonding (Nickel oxy-hydroxide phase to phosphorus) bond [85], and showed the presence of the inorganic phosphate group that decreases with increase in GO content. That means the inorganic phosphate group attached to Ni, inspite of the carbon of GO sheets. The pre-edge resonance peak A of composites gets diluted along with the down ward move of the peaks by increasing the amount of GO in GO:NPO composite. Apart from the electronic transition 1s → 3p transition (edge), the 1s → 3d (pre-edge) transition is a dipole forbbiden according to the X-ray transition selectivity rule that resulted in comparative low intensity of pre-edge [86]. The spectra demonstrated the gradual changes in chemical enviorment around the P atom of the PO4 3− tetrahedral, which is an indicative of the inner-sphere complexation. The strong edge measured for all composites due to the dipole-allowed electronic transition P1s→P3p or O2p, where the 3p orbitals are empty for phosphate compounds with the +5 oxidation state of phosphorus [87]. As there is no considerable shifting in photon energy of edge with GO variation, it is suggested that the oxidation state of the P remains same (V) that can be used to extract the effective atomic charge of the absorber as the symmetry of the investigated phosphates remains same [88]. Minor shift in the energy positions of the absorption edge cling to the valence-charge transfer leads to the formation of chemical bonds and the presence of the oxidation states of the phosphor. White line resonance B occurred at photon energy 2152.75 eV (standard value =2152.4 eV), a higher value reflected the replacement of the lower atomic radii element carbon (70 pm) with phosphorus (100 pm). Because of the PO4 3- group has Td-symmetry, therefore the white line is assigned to the electronic transition P 1s to an unoccupied valence electronic state formed (by overlapping of P 1s with P sp3 hybrid- and O 2p-orbitals) [89]. Bridging P-O-P units causes a slight splitting of the white line due to transitions into different unoccupied electronic states (P-O type). We consigned the resonance peaks beyond the whiteline peak B: as the continuum resonances C, D, E, and F, generated due to the multiple scattering (MS) of the photoelectron wave function at the neighboring atoms. The continuum resonances occurred at the almost same energy positions for all studied samples in the region of 2160-2166 eV due to the formation of bridging P-O-P and P-P units as indicated by Fig. 8a. In these composite phosphates, the chemical variation in the second coordination sphere of P reflected the continuum resonance. Moreover, the multiple bond character of peak 2158.25 eV (continuum resonance: C) of the composite representing bridging O-species that diluted in compared to the terminal bonded O-atoms, which is reflected by the corresponding larger bond lengths [90]. All composites showed the resonance at 2164.25 eV (continuum resonance: D), affiliated to the P-O-P and P-P bond. Continuum resonance refelected at photon energy 2168.50 eV (E) and 2183.95 eV (F). The broad peaks in the continuum at 2183.95 eV, 2168.50 eV, and 2164.25 eV, assigned to the multiple scattering with respect to the first O, second O, and third O neighboring shells, beside the phosphorus atom."
13,Photocatalytic reactions of composites,"3.4 Photocatalytic reactions of composites 3.4.1 Hydrogen production by reduction of methanolic water The GO:NPO nanocomposites (with ratio 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50 and 2.00) are used to generate hydrogen gas through photocatalytic water splitting in 20% aqueous methanol under irradiation of 300W-Xe light irradiation. In absence of light exposure, none of the composites or pure compounds produced any gaseous products that proves the water splitting reaction over GO:NPOs is a purely photo-induced process. All nanocomposite samples exhibited the good hydrogen production ability and composite 1.00 GO:NPO demonstrated the maximum activity i.e.15.37 μmol/h−1 (Table 7 and Figs. 9a-9i and Fig.10a) among studied samples. Fig. S8 illustrated the reproducibility for the nanocomposite 1.00 GO:NPO and GO in three consecutive cyles (3h) to show the good sustainability of the hydrogen production. These results go hand in hand with the observation obtained from the XRD, UV-Vis DRS, UVVis absorbance, FTIR, ESR, Raman,PL, TRPL and XANES (at Ni K edge, C K-edge, O K edge and P K edge), analyses. The XRD and ESR analyses proved the composite 1.00 GO:NPO as the turning point in terms of photocatalytic water splitting ability. Below, which the composites are NPO rich and their hydrogen generation ability gradually increased with increasing GO concentration but beyond this point, the hydrogen generation ability of the samples start decreasing, gradually. ESR study also revealed the maximum spin concentration (3.46×1018 spin g−1) observed with the high g-value (2.00469) for 1.00 GO:NPO sample of the series with respect to the pure GO (spin density~3.5(3) × 1019 spins g−1) [91] and ESR g-value range = 2.0022–2.0033) [92]) due to larger spin-orbital interaction and competent type–II heterojunction interface between the two phases (GO and NPO) are the signature of the good charge transfer capacity of the sample in comparison to the other samples. In this spatial separation (electrons and holes separated by the interface), the electron- and hole -wave function overlapping lowered down in comparison to the direct band gap semiconductors [93], that causes a large decay time to falicitate higher activity of water splitting. FTIR spectra revealed the presence of a bridged Ni-O-P arrangement that might restrict the bond motion of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the IR spectral band positions of composites ensured the gradual strengthening of the NPO bonding with GO through PO4 group and Ni—O (NiO6/NiO4) bands. Furthermore, the intense Raman band observed near 770 cm−1 for the 1.00 GO:NPO composite, attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of P–O–P/ P-O-Ni bridges, which is the fingerprint region of the P2O7 4− oxoanions, confirmed the GO is well connected with PO4 3− group oriented reactions. The excitonic character of the aromatic and quoniline part of the GO carbon facilitates the maximum delocalization of electron through the 1.00 GO:NPO basal plan. The ESR supported DFT calculation used to suggest a structural model of GO:NPO, where the hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups bonded to the basal plane (single-layered aromatic ring) of GO and carboxylic (COOH) group attached to the edges of GO sheets. NPO tethered to the GO by Ni (octahedrally/tetrahedrally arranged NiO6/NiO4 in GO plane) and PO4 3− end as illustrated in Fig. 5 The above study reflected the spin-density profile of the triangulane molecular structure of the composite GO:NPO supported with DFT calculations of spin density that the sample 1:00 GO:NPO may possess three tetrahedral GO-NiO4-PO4 -STO3G-doublet geometrical arrangements and one octahedral GO-NiO6-PO4-STO3G-doublet geometrical -arrangement along the GO basal plane in a single unit that might contributed to the oxygen defects. Raman spectra suggest the almost equiproportional sp3 and sp2 carbon in 1.00GO:NPO. The steady state PL and TRPL further confirm the relation of oxygen defects and rate of recombination of charge carriers. Low PL intensity of 1.00GO:NPO corresponds to the lower rate of recombination that falicitated the high hydrogen production from water. Furthermore, it is cleared from the ESR (broad and short peak for 1.00 GO:NPO) spectral shape that the photogenerated carriers hold good charge transfer capacity and minmal oxygen defects that can suppressed the charge-carrier recombination possibility. Furthermore, highest spin concentration also facilitate the delocalisation of electrons in GO network. These results go hand in hand with the water splitting activities. The highest charge transfer gap (6.089 eV) observed for the 1.00 GO:NPO that confirm the retention of the charge carrier that inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, contributed towards high efficiency for hydrogen formation from methanolic water [94]. Fig. 10b demonstrated the schematic electron transfer mechanism of photocatalytic water spliting in hole-sacrificial electrolyte solution. Existence of the extra pre edge feature A′ (due to the -COOH group) and pronounced shoulder peak D (due to carbonyl resonance) in samples beyond 1.00GO:NPO (i.e. 1.25 GO:NPO, 1.50GO:NPO and 2.00GO:NPO) in O K-edge XAS profile of studied samples leads to decrease in photocatalytic activity of the composites. Maximum white line peak for 1.00GO:NPO reflected the higher concentration of the phenolic (-OH) group in the sample also leads to the higher hydrogen production capacity of the composite. Furthermore, the P K-edge study announced the exixtence of the inorganic phosphate group decreases with increase in GO content. That means the inorganic phosphate group attached to Ni, inspite of the carbon of GO sheets and formation of bridging P-O-P and P-P units at NPO loaded GO. Comparatively regular arrangement of the elements around phosphorus further confirmed by P K edge XAS study. In GO:NPO composite, when nickel phosphate molecule (octahedral or teterahedral) landed on GO surface then its four oxygen atom of nickel attached to the GO atom through bridging P-O-P and P=O units. The scheme of electron transfer mechanism is shown by Fig. 10b, which is strongly supported by PL emission, FTIR, XANES (Ni K-edge, C K-edge, O K-edge, P K-edge) experimental studies. when the photocatalytic material was exposed by the light then electron jumped from VB to CB. Electrons at CB reduce water to generate hydrogen and the hole left at VB power the oxidation process of methanol to generate HCHO or HCOOH or CO2 or CO. Above two photocatalytic processes are hurdled by recombination process. Because at the bottom of the CB, some electron rich O-defects i.e. Vo are present. These electrons of Vo dive from Vo to Vo + and Vo 2+ defect states to emit green and blue luminescence light, respectively, This recombination suppress the number of electrons at CB and overpower the hydrogen production(by reduction of water) process. Therefore, the composite was loaded with co-catalyst Pt to reduce the rate of charge recombination. There is one single reason behind the recombination process, one or more than one reasons such as elemental synergy at interface, charge transfer gap, morphology, band gap, number and type of defects, ratio of sp2 and sp3 carbon, substituents of GO plane, number of graphene sheets (in this study it is one), life time of the carriers, are the important driving forces behind the recombination process, which reduces the hydrogen generation activity. 3.4.2 Apparent quantum efficiency of H2 evolution The apparent quantum yields of hydrogen production strongly depend on the measurement methods, the reaction conditions, composition of the photocatalytic material, etc. and it was calculated by using following formula in Eq. (8) [95,96], namely: (8) AQY = [ numb er of reac ted elec trons or holes ] [ numb er of inci dent phot ons ] = [ numb er of hydr ogen mole cules evol ved x 2 ] * 100 [ numb er of inci dent phot ons ] Where, energy E=nhν, n= number of photons, h=Planck's constant and ν= frequency, One can get number of photons per second by dividing the energy by Planck's constant, you should get photons per second. The measured ARQ show the results between 0.0674% to 0.1852%. Initially, the calculated AQY inceases with GO amount in composite till 1.00 GO:NPO(0.1852 %), afterwards it started decreasing till pure GO."
14,Conclusion,"We synthesized a nanocomposite of NPO and GO through a green method, by using natural sunlight. As synthesized composites had major two components: GO and NPO with the minute rGO. Various analytical and theoretical approches used to examine the samples to determine the final structure of the composite and to study the effect of variation in the ratio of GO and NPO in composite on their water splitting activity. Finally, all composites along their respective pure compounds are used for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation in methanolic water under 300 WXe light exposure. The composite 1.00GO:NPO behaves in an exceptionally good manner for hydrogen generation with respect to the other studied samples of the same class [22]. The apt number of active sites with competent interface present on the basal plane of GO, leads to the highest spin concentration in the sample. A structure design resulted from the DFT spin density of state calculations and experimental analyses was used to illustrate the water splitting mechanism for hydrogen generation. Efforts to perform the in-situ XANES study at synchrotron center (RCAT, Indore, India) along with the hydrogen generation through water splitting is in process. Moreover, a similar study with cerium phosphate and GO composite is under process. A study found that the low-cost composite 1.00GO:NPO that show quite good photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production."
