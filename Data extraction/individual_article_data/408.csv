0,Introduction,"Waste from the orange industry holds great potential as substrate for biogas production. Brazil is considered as the main producer, followed by the United States, India and China (Calabrò et al., 2016). Citrus Peel Waste (CPW) is composed mainly of citrus peels and bagasses, produced at an approximate level of 500 t for each 1,000 t of processed fruit (Ruiz and Flotats, 2016). Despite the availability of many alternatives, there is still no standard destination for its final disposal and, as a consequence, the surplus residue will eventually be discarded around the production sites (Calabrò et al., 2016). During anaerobic digestion, it is possible to obtain other products of biotechnological interest than biogas, such as organic acids and alcohols, produced in the acidogenic and acetogenic fermentation stages. Regarding CPW, Ángel Siles López et al. (2010) reported its use as raw material mainly for the production of second generation ethanol, commonly in aerobic processes, and succinic acid in fermentative processes. Camargo et al. (2019) evaluated the effects of different pretreatments to obtain H2 from CPW, such as hydrothermolysis (180 °C; 15 min) and alkaline delignification (NaOH 5M; H2O2 1%; 24 h). In natura CPW fermentation was more favorable than pretreated CPW. When the main purpose of the fermentation process is to obtain hydrogen as final product, the desirable metabolic routes are those that produce acetic acid and butyric acid as the main fermentation products (Hawkes et al., 2002). Similarly, propionic acid and reduced products, such as alcohols and lactic acid, should be produced in low concentrations (Hawkes et al., 2002). The possibility of using consortia instead of pure cultures to obtain acetic acid can also be advantageous, since it reduces the costs of using specific medium. In this scenario, studies on new ways to obtain organic acids and solvents from processes are promising, especially when reconciled with anaerobic digestion, given the possibility of obtaining hydrogen and/or methane. Furthermore, through anaerobic digestion, degradation of recalcitrant organic residues, such as lignocellulosic residues, can be obtained. The most frequently used inocula for the production of biogas are sludge from several types of wastewater treatment plants (Su et al., 2016), manure, and also the ruminal content of cattle or goats, as it can provide a consortium rich in cellulolytic and fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea (Calabrò et al., 2016). Indeed, under given operational conditions, the efficiency of the degradation process of different residues is directly related to the presence, prevalence and activity of different microbial populations involved. However, the microbial composition of these inocula is often unknown. One of the most abundant genera related to dark fermentation is Clostridium, which can produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during the exponential growth phase, while alcohols are dominantly produced during the stationary phase (Cebreiros et al., 2019). This is probably due to the pH reduction of the medium after the exponential phase. This consequently favors the alteration of the metabolic pathways. Lin et al. (2007) evaluated several species of Clostridia, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. butyricum, C. tyrobutyricum and C. beijerinckii. The authors verified that C. beijerinckii is more efficient in the production of hydrogen than the other species mentioned, producing 2.1 mmol H2/mmol glucose. The main products of glucose fermentation by Clostridium species were butyric acid and acetic acid at pH above 5. Below this pH value, a shift of metabolic pathway from acetic/butyric to lactic acid/ethanol end-products was observed in some species, such as C. butyricum. In addition to the inoculum composition and concentration, other variables are relevant to the processes for H2 production in anaerobic reactors, such as temperature, initial pH, concentration of nutrients and, mainly, the type of substrate used (Woo et al., 2015). Due to the high number of relevant parameters, experimental designs are useful to establish the optimal operational conditions for each fermentation process. The Rotational Central Composite Design (RCCD) allows to obtain a polynomial model, which can be used to describe both the effect of each factor studied and the interaction between different factors in a response of interest (Rodrigues and Iemma, 2014), i.e H2 production. Based on the regression model, it is possible to obtain the optimal operating conditions in order to maximize the production of the compound of interest. According to Wang and Wan (2009), continuous systems are more indicated to organic matter removal from waste and wastewater, due to the higher expected efficiency in relation to discontinuous systems. However, the optimization of operational parameters in batch reactors allows the transition of the process, to be applied in continuous reactors and to scale up more efficiently, since the reactor stability depends directly on the stability in its initialization phase (Bakonyi et al., 2014). The main objective of the present study was to characterize the microbial community and the functional activity of different reactors applied to lignocellulosic waste fermentation, operated in conditions identified after the optimization of three distinct parameters by means of RCCD: allochthonous inoculum concentration (2.32–5.68 gTVS/L), pH (4.32–7.68) and CPW concentration (1.55–28.45 g/L). The results described may contribute to better understand the microbial communities involved in processes of dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass and the preponderant metabolic pathways."
1,Material and methods,
2,CPW collection and storage,"2.1 CPW collection and storage The in natura CPW was used to obtain the biogas production assays produced at the Laboratory of Biological Processes of the University of São Paulo (São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil). For this purpose, fresh and ripe oranges (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck, var. Pera-Rio) were used, removing juice and seeds and separating their peels and bagasses, in order to obtain residues similar to that of industrial plants. CPW was dehydrated in a drying oven at 50 °C for 24 h and milled with a knife mill (Wiley TE-650/1) in order to obtain particles <1 mm, which were stored in polyethylene plastic bottles at 4 °C until use. The CPW physicochemical characterization regarding the composition of macro and micronutrients is described in Camargo et al. (2019), obtaining Total Solids (TS) 211 g/kg, Total Volatile Solids (TVS) 201 g/kg, nitrogen 7005 mg/kg, phosphorus 882 mg/kg, Ca 5290 mg/kg, Cu 62 mg/kg, Fe 46 mg/kg, Mg 1123 mg/kg, Mn 9 mg/kg, Ni < 1 mg/kg, K 9570 mg/kg, Na 193 mg/kg, Zn 23 mg/kg, in addition to 25% of lignin (% of TS) and 6.3 g/kg of total carbohydrates."
3,Inocula selection,"2.2 Inocula selection 2.2.1 Autochthonous inoculum A mix of autochthonous and allochthonous inoculum was used as microbial source, being their proportions settled in accordance to Table 1 . The autochthonous inoculum was obtained according to Camargo et al. (2020b) in Peptone Cellulose Solution (PCS) culture medium with the following composition: 5% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 5% CaCO3 and 5% NaCl. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1M HCl and 1M NaOH. In these conditions, 5 gTVS/L of in natura CPW (peels and bagasse, <1 mm) were added to 500 mL Duhran® flasks, with 250 mL reaction volume and 250 mL headspace, under N2/CO2 (70/30%) atmosphere, closed with butyl caps and plastic threads. The reactors were incubated at 30 °C under static and dark conditions for approximately 120 h. The autochthonous inoculum was composed of 1.7 gTS/L and 1.4 gTVS/L. It was submitted to 5,000 rpm centrifugation and the liquid fraction was discarded before use. 2.2.2 Allochthonous inoculum Two granulated sludges from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were compared, in order to select the one with higher H2 concentration potential using CPW as substrate. The sludges compared were (1) applied to the thermophilic treatment (55 °C) of sugarcane vinasse, from Usina São Martinho (Pradópolis, São Paulo, Brazil), and (2) applied to the mesophilic treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater, provided by Avícola Dacar, (Tietê, São Paulo, Brazil). The thermophilic sludge had a pH of 7.1, and was composed of 36.7 gTS/L and 20.4 gTVS/L, 65 mg.L−1 of acetic acid, 39 mg.L−1 of lactic acid. The mesophilic sludge had a pH of 7.4, and was composed of 59.5 gTS/L and 48.3 gTVS/L, 49 mg.L−1 of acetic acid, 19 mg.L−1 of lactic acid. The sludges were stored in plastic containers with capacity of 30 L at 4 °C until use, and underwent trituration using a household blender for 0.5 min for granule disruption before use. In addition, it was submitted to 5,000 rpm centrifugation, the liquid fraction was discarded before use, and the solid fraction was transferred to the batch reactors (3 gSTV/L). The assays were carried out at 55 °C and 37 °C using both sludges, separately, with inoculum concentration of 3 gSTV/L and 15 g/L of CPW, in 500 mL Duhran® flasks, with 250 mL reaction volume filled with PCS medium, and 250 mL headspace, under N2/CO2 (70/30%) atmosphere, closed with butyl caps and plastic threads. The reactors were incubated under static and dark conditions for approximately 120 h, or until the H2 concentration was stable. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1M HCl and 1M NaOH. The sludge used as inoculum in the assays where higher H2 concentrations were obtained, was used as inoculum in the Rotational Central Composite Design (RCCD) assays, in concentrations according to Table 1."
4,H2 production and optimization through RCCD,"2.3 H2 production and optimization through RCCD The optimization assays via Rotational Central Composite Design (RCCD) was performed as described in Rodrigues and Iemma (2014), and both the fixed conditions and the independent variables to be evaluated were chosen according to the Placket & Burman screening design described in Camargo et al. (2020a), according to its significance to the H2 production reported by the aforementioned authors. The influence of the independent variables was evaluated through a complete factorial design of 23, including 6 axial points and 3 central point repetitions, totaling 17 assays. The variables were allochthonous inoculum concentration (x1; 2.32–5.68 gSTV/L), substrate concentration (x2; 1.55–28.45 g/L) and pH (X3; 4.32–7.68) (Table 1). In addition, the fixed conditions were autochthonous inoculum (1.5 gSTV/L), peptone concentration (5 g/L), headspace volume (40%) and temperature (30 °C). The assays were performed under semi-static conditions (manually agitated before each biogas collection), since in a previous study using lignocellulosic waste (coffee processing waste) to obtain H2, agitation parameter did not show any statistical significance (Villa Montoya et al., 2019a). H2 production data using in natura CPW as substrate and the allochthonous inoculum (UASB sludge) in unoptimized conditions (15 g/L of CPW, 2 gTVS/L of allochthonous inoculum, pH 7.0, 30 °C, PCS medium) were used as reference for comparative purposes. The data about the unoptimized assay are described in previous research (Camargo et al., 2019), where the authors obtained 13.31 mmol H2/L."
5,Kinetics,"2.4 Kinetics The anaerobic batch reactors were conducted in triplicates, in 250 mL Duhran® flasks with 40% headspace, at N2 atmosphere, closed with butyl cap and plastic thread. The reactors were incubated in the dark at 30 °C under semi-static conditions (manually agitated before each biogas collection) until H2 production showed stability (approximately 40 h), that means, any variations ±1.0 mmol/L at least in the three last measurements. The stability was confirmed by means of the R2 parameter obtained using the Gompertz model. Start time of H2 production, maximum H2 production rate and maximum H2 concentration potential were determined with the modified Gompertz model (Zwietering et al., 1994). The kinetic parameters were calculated using Eq. (1) in OriginPro 9.0 software. (1) Y ( t ) = P . e x p − e x p ( R m . e P [ λ − t ] + 1 ) } where. Y(t) = logarithmic ratio between H2 concentration (mmol) at time t and its initial concentration, Rm = maximum H2 production rate (mmol/h), e = Euler number (2.71828182) λ = start time of H2 production (h), P = maximum H2 concentration potential (mmol/L). 2.4.1 Analytical methods Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Volatile Solids (TVS) and pH were analyzed according to APHA/AWWA/WEF (2012). Total carbohydrates (Dubois et al., 1956) and total phenolic compounds were analyzed by colorimetric methods (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012). Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) and alcohols were evaluated using gas chromatography (Shimadzu® GC-2010) according to Adorno et al. (2014) for determination of acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), lactic acid (HLac) and ethanol (EtOH). The determination of limonene content was performed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) according to Camargo et al. (2020c). Biogas composition analyses were performed in a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu® GC-2010), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The column used was Carboxen 1010 PLOT, 30 m × 0.53 mm. Temperature of injector, furnace and detector were of 220 °C, 130 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Argon gas was used as carrier, with column flow of 5.66 mL/min, and a volume of 12 mL/min (Camarg et al., 2020)."
6,Microbial community characterization,"2.5 Microbial community characterization Triplicate samples of approximately 50 mL from the inoculum, as well as from optimized reactors, were collected at the end of operation time for genomic DNA extraction. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The liquid phase was discarded and the biomass was washed in 10 mL of PBS buffer (NaCl 8%, KCl 0.2%, Na2HPO4 1.44%, KH2PO4 0.24%) (Green and Sambrook, 2012) and stored at 4 °C in the meantime. Extraction was carried out using FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals™), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The extracted DNA was analyzed on Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometers (ThermoFisher Scientific), to measure its concentration (ng/μL) and purity (260 nm/280 nm ratio). Library preparation and metagenomic sequencing were performed at GenOne Biotechnologies (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) on a HiSeq 4000 platform PE150 (2x150 bp), using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina NEB #E7645, following the manufacturer's guidelines. FASTQ format sequences were obtained after sequencing via Illumina HiSeq platform. The raw sequences were submitted to the NCBI SRA database under accession numbers SRX7704207 to SRX7704212 (BioProject PRJNA605706). After a sequence quality control with FastQC and MultiQC, poor quality reads and bases were filtered with the Fastp v. 0.20.0 preprocessing tool (Chen et al., 2018), with length_required >50 and default settings, removing PolyG and PolyX tails at the 3′ ends. The obtained trimmed reads were pooled together and co-assembled into contigs with metaSPAdes v. 3.14.0 (Nurk et al., 2017) with option meta, and keeping contigs >1000 bp. Quality control of the contigs was performed using Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies (QUAST) computing metrics based on their size and GC percent, according to Gurevich (2013). The tool Prodigal version v.2.6.3 (Hyatt et al., 2010), with option meta, was applied for gene prediction. Bowtie2 (Langmead, 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1923) was used to map the reads back to the obtained contigs. Finally, the tool HTseq-count version 0.10.0 with option union, count mapped reads per predicted genes was used. Taxonomic annotation at gene level was performed with the tool Kaiju (Menzel et al., 2016) against sequences available in NCBI nr database. Annotation was performed with a 1E-5 cutoff for E-value and a minimum identity of 60%. Functional and metabolic annotation was performed with GhostKOALA against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), KEGG Orthology (KO) database (Kanehisa et al., 2016) and with dbCAN (Yin et al., 2012) against the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes) (http://www.cazy.org/), and defined according to protein homology using HMMER server. The metabolic pathways were mapped to KEGG database using the Pathview package (Luo and Brouwer, 2013). Differential gene expression analyses based on the negative binomial distribution were performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) package (threshold = 0.005), while graphical visualizations were obtained with ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009) package, and R basic functions (https://www.R-project.org/)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,H2 production and optimization by RCCD,"3.1 H2 production and optimization by RCCD After preliminary assays, carried out in order to choose the most appropriate allochthonous inoculum, the granulated sludge from UASB reactors applied to the thermophilic treatment of sugarcane vinasse was selected, since higher H2 concentrations were observed when this inoculum was evaluated both in mesophilic or thermophilic ranges, at 30 °C (12.54 mmol/L) and at 55 °C (5.19 mmol/L), when compared to the mesophilic sludge, also evaluated in the same temperature conditions (3.33 and 8.46 mmol/L, respectively) (Fig. A1). Rodrigues et al. (2019) used the same thermophilic sludge as inoculum in mesophilic assays (37 °C) in order to obtain H2 in batch reactors using glycerol as substrate, and obtaining 15.14 moL H2 mol−1 glycerol added. In this way, it was possible to infer that, besides the thermophilic source of this inoculum, it can be favorable to H2 production in mesophilic ranges. The RCCD was performed with fixed conditions according to the results obtained in the screening design described in Camargo et al. (2020a): autochthonous inoculum (1.5 gSTV/L), peptone concentration (5 g/L), headspace volume (40%) and temperature (30 °C). The experimental conditions and the results obtained for P (Y1), Rm (Y2) and λ (Y3) are summarized in Table 2 . In order to evaluate the influence of independent variables, such as allochthonous inoculum (x1; 2.32–5.68 gSTV/L), substrate concentration (x2; 1.55–28.45 g/L) and pH (x3; 4.32–7.68). According to the conditions established in each assay, P values were observed between 0.01 mmol H2/L (E11) and 29.26 mmol H2/L (E8), Rm between 0.01 mmol/h (E11) and 2.48 mmol/h (E13) and λ between 3.74 h (E4) and 20 h (E8) (Fig. A2). It is noteworthy that besides the allochthonous inoculum used (UASB sludge), there was no significant methane production in any of the conditions evaluated, i.e, the observed values were lower than 1.27 mmol (limit of methane quantification of the method used). The regression model obtained for P includes only the statistically significant terms (p ≤ 0.1), namely two linear terms (x2 and x3), a quadratic term (x2 2) and an interaction term (x2.x3), referring to the variables of pH (x2) and substrate concentration and pH (x3) ( Eq. (2) ). For P, the variable allochthonous inoculum concentration (x1) was not considered significant (p = 0.9972), as well as its interaction with the other variables. (2) P = 15.29 + 7.35 x 2 − 1.97 x 2 2 + 1.38 x 3 + 4.70 x 2 x 3 where. P = maximum H2 concentration potential (mmol/L); x2 = pH, linear effect; x2 2 = pH, quadratic effect; x3 = substrate concentration (g/L), linear effect; x2x3 = interaction between x2 and x3. Based on ANOVA (Table 3 ), the obtained model is statistically significant, since the percentage of explained variation (R2) was of 91.21%. Based on the F values (ratio between the model and its error), it was possible to reject H0 (null hypothesis), since the Fcalculated for regression/residuals (31.1) is approximately 12.5 times higher than the Ftabulated (2.48) for experiments with 10% confidence interval and with 4 degrees of freedom for regression and 12 degrees of freedom for residues. Since the Fcalculated of the lack of fit/pure error (deviations of observations from the mean) is 2.2 and the Ftabulated for experiments with 10 degrees of freedom for lack of adjustment and 2 degrees of freedom for pure error is 9.39, it can be inferred that the model has an appropriate fit. In addition, the p-value of the lack of fit (p = 0.35505) was not significant, while the p-value of the regression is highly significant (p ≤ 0.00001). The response surface for P was obtained according to the regression model (Fig. 1 ). According to the surface, the conditions applied in the validation assay were 4 gTVS/L of allochthonous inoculum, initial pH of the reaction medium of 8.98 and 29.8 g/L of CPW, corresponding to the predicted optimal conditions. For Rm, only a linear term (x2) regarding the substrate concentration was considered as statistically significant at the significance level adopted (10%). However, the percentage of explained variation (R2) was too low (61%). However, it was observed that the optimal experimental conditions could be similar to those obtained for P, namely 28.45 g/L of substrate for a maximum Rm of 1.54 mmol H2/h. Similarly, for λ, only the interaction between x2 and x3 (substrate concentration and pH) was found to have a significant effect (p < 0.1). Nevertheless, a very low percentage of explained variation was observed (R2 = 33.14%). The pH is an influential factor in H2 production and, concomitantly, VFA production in anaerobic digestion, especially owing to its effect on the enzyme hydrogenase and because ATP is used to ensure cell neutrality rather than to produce hydrogen (Chuenchart et al., 2020). In addition, pH may also influence the resistance of certain microorganisms to limonene, due to the defense mechanism known as homeoviscous adaptation, where cells tend to keep the membrane fluidity constant, regardless of environmental conditions, through changes in the content and length of the fatty acid chains (Ruiz and Flotats, 2014). In this study, a direct relation was observed between the initial pH and substrate concentration, since the interaction between them was significant for P (p ≤ 0.1). Mu et al. (2006), optimized both P and Rm using the response surface method, indicating as optimum conditions the pH 5.5, 34.8 °C and 24.8 g/L of sucrose, to obtain P of 252 mLH2/g and Rm of 1511 mLH2/h. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned authors also indicated the variables pH and substrate concentration as interdependent, as in the present study (x2x3), where 1.37 mmol H2/g TVS of CPW (12.3 mLH2/g TVS of CPW) and Rm of 0.13 mmol H2/h (1.19 mL H2/h) were obtained in the optimized conditions. After RCCD, it can be observed that the assays with the lowest final pH values, namely E3 (4.51) and E7 (4.96), can be correlated with longer λ (≥10 h) and higher amounts of substrate (23 g/L). However, high H2 concentration was observed in these assays (11.24 and 27.39 mmol/L, respectively). Based on these results, it was possible to infer that the microbial consortium used could overcome the limitations related to this longer adaptation period, such as the higher VFA accumulation and acid pH caused by the increase of the substrate concentration. In addition, other explanation to these long λ observed could be the thermophilic origin of the allochthonous inoculum used (UASB reactors operated at 55 °C). Similarly, lower H2 concentrations were observed in the assays where pH ≥ 6.0 was achieved at the end of the operational time, such as E6 (2.75 mmol/L) and E11 (≤0.01 mmol/L), where the lower substrate concentrations were evaluated (7.0 and 1.5 g/L). In short, phenolic compounds concentration and dissolved carbohydrate removal were also quantified in the RCCD assays (Table 2), however, no strict pattern was observed between the Gompertz parameters (P, Rm or λ) for its initial and final concentrations. Similar results were observed by Villa-Montoya et al. (2020), since no increase in P was observed for the same parameters using coffee processing wastes as substrate. Several types of carbohydrates can be found in CPW, such as glucose, xylose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, cellulose, pectin and lignin-like compounds, representing about 80% of its volatile solids (Choi et al., 2013; Lotito et al., 2018; Satari et al., 2017). The readily available sugars can affect the interpretation of the CPW biodigestion, since the dissolved carbohydrates are first consumed before the polymers and the lignocellulosic biomass. In the present study, removals were observed at the minimum of 17% in E11 (inoculum 4.0 gSTV/L, substrate 1.5 gCPW/L, pH 4.0), the same where the lowest P was observed (0.01 mmol/L) and the lowest substrate concentration was evaluated. Similarly, the maximum dissolved carbohydrate removal (67%) was observed in E12 (inoculum 4.0 gSTV/L, substrate 28.5 gCPW/L, pH 6.0), where one of the highest P (20.75 mmol/L) were obtained, which can be attributed to the readily available carbohydrates monomers due to its greater substrate concentrations (Shen et al., 2018). When comparing the optimized and unoptimized conditions, it can be inferred that higher removal of dissolved carbohydrates (51 and 42%) were related to higher hydrogen concentrations (48.47 and 13.31 mmol H2/L, respectively) in the same assays, due to the carbohydrate bioconversion to organic acids, such as acetic and butyric acids, with concomitant hydrogen production during dark fermentation. Concerning the variations observed in the phenols concentration in all assays, it was observed that in the assays with lower production of phenolic compounds after fermentation (0.5–1.7 mg/L), greater values of P were detected (E4, E8, E9, E10, Optimized and Unoptimized, of 12.10–48.47 mmol H2/L). On the other hand, it was also observed that in most of the assays there was increase in phenol concentrations, which could be attributed to lignocellulosic depolymerization during hydrolysis, which can generate lignocellulose-derived compounds (i.e. furan derivatives, phenolic compounds and lignin), and may affect microbial growth by damaging its cellular membranes (Quéméneur et al., 2012). It is noteworthy that, according to studies evaluating the H2 production from phenol-containing substrates in anaerobic reactors, low phenol concentrations (≤800–1000 mg/L) exhibited only minimal effects on the cell growth rate, not affecting the H2 production (Buitrón and Carvajal, 2010; Tai et al., 2010). In the present study, the phenol concentrations varied from 16.69 to 22.82 mg/L, which suggests this parameter probably had no significant effect on any of the applied conditions. Regarding the substrate concentration, Desvaux (2005) indicates that this parameter is relevant for lignocellulosic biomass fermentation, since cellulolytic microorganisms must adhere to the substrate in order to be able to hydrolyze it, which could explain the high concentrations of CPW in the optimum conditions (29.8 g/L). Additionally, high substrate concentrations lead to higher readily degradable carbohydrates, resulting in rapid hydrolysis and higher VFA accumulation (Jiang et al., 2018). This VFA accumulation is a consequence of the anaerobic digestion process, where the readily degradable oligomers are converted into VFA and alcohols by acid producing bacteria, where formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids are the most common ones, depending on the operational conditions (Shen et al., 2018). It is known that high ionized VFA in the environment can lead to excessive anion accumulation in the cytoplasm, and acidification of the latter can occur due to VFA crossing the cell membrane freely, dissociating inside the cell, decreasing the proton motive force across the membrane and also affecting the cell metabolism, thereby reducing the growth potential (Jiang et al., 2018). The higher VFA production along the operation time can explain the lower pH at the end of the incubation period and also the longer λ observed in the optimized assay (17.35 h, pH 4.80) when compared with the unoptimized assay (4.60 h, pH 5.30). One possible explanation is that more time is required for the VFA consuming and hydrogen-producing bacteria to adapt to the stressful environment (Jiang et al., 2018); in addition, the high recalcitrance of cellulose and toxicity of lignin and lignin derivatives can affect the hydrolytic activity, since cellulolytic enzymes can irreversibly adsorb dissolved lignin (Masih-Das and Tao, 2018). When analyzing all the RCCD assays (Fig. A3), it can be seen that the main metabolites produced in most of them were HAc and HBu. The reactor with higher concentrations of these compounds was R8, with 2244 mg/L of HAc and 1683 mg/L of HBu at the end of the operational time (35 h). It is highlighted that in the same assay, higher H2 concentration was observed (29.26 mmol/L). Similarly, the main VFAs observed in all the reactors with high H2 concentration (≥20 mmol/L) were HAc and HBu, such as R12 (20.75 mmolH2/L, 797 mgHAc/L and 3,181 mgHBu/L) and R07 (27.39 mmolH2/L, 1,228 mgHAc/L and 1815 mgHBu/L). All the mentioned assays were operated with CPW concentrations above 20 g/L and pH above 7.0. The greater HPr and HVal concentrations were observed in R3 (1,353 and 691 mg/L, respectively). In Fact, 11.24 mmol H2/L was obtained, probably due to the concomitant HAc production, which reached 2,713 mg/L. It is possible to assume that the high VFA production occurred due to the lower pH in this assay (4.5) and high CPW concentration used (23 g/L). EtOH production in R4 was observed, where the same CPW concentration and same pH was applied, and similar H2 concentration was observed (16.29 mmol H2/L). The reactor R5 was operated with higher pH (7.5) and lower concentration of CPW (7 g/L), and the main organic compound produced along the operational time was EtOH (2,777 mg/L). In this reactor, one of the lowest H2 concentration was observed (2.35 mmol H2/L), probably due to the predominance of the solventogenic pathway (Łukajtis et al., 2018)."
9,Validation assay,"3.2 Validation assay The validation assay (Fig. 2) was planned according to the optimized conditions predicted by the surface response (allochthonous inoculum 4 gTVS/L, 29.8 gCPW/L and pH 8.98). The fixed conditions where set out according to the Plackett & Burman screening design in Camargo et al. (2020a). The H2 concentration value predicted by the regression model was of 42.18 ± 5.1 mmol H2/L, while the experimental value obtained was of 48.47 ± 2.2 mmol H2/L. Based on the validation assay, it can be stated that the H2 production was optimized, since the P value obtained (48.47 mmol/L) was 3.64 times higher than the P value obtained before its optimization (13.31 mmol/L) (Camargo et al., 2019). In addition, the Rm value (4.70 mmol/h) was also higher than in previous assays, where the maximum Rm observed was 2.64 mmol H2/h. Regarding the analyzed VFA and alcohols (Fig. A3), the main metabolites produced at the end of the operational time were HBu (3,731 mg/L) and HAc (3,516 mg/L). Moreover, the concentration of HBu was higher than that observed in the unoptimized reactor (1,317 mg/L). It was also observed that EtOH and HPr concentrations were slightly higher in the optimized reactor (188 and 324 mg/L) when compared with the unoptimized one (116 and 209 mg/L). HLac, HCap and HVal values were below the detection limit of the method along the operational time. In the unoptimized reactor, the maximum concentrations were the following: 175 mg/L of EtOH, 4,354 mg/L of HAc, 1317 mg/L of HBu, 23 mg/L of HCap, 65 mg/L of HLac, 209 mg/L of HPr and 42 mg/L of HVal. The VFA concentrations can be related to the successful anaerobic fermentation (Zhao et al., 2018). It is known that the HPr production route is not favorable to H2 production and its production is often an indicator of anaerobic digestion inhibition (Xing et al., 2020). Even so, none of the experiments reached the inhibitory limit of 1000 mg/L (Shen et al., 2018). Moreover, HPr can be converted to HAc, simultaneously leading to H2 production ( Eq. (3) ) (Mazareli et al., 2020). Similarly, it is known that the metabolic pathways involved in HAc and HBu production is closely linked to H2 production: from 1 mol of glucose, 4 mol ( Eq. (4) ) and 2 mol ( Eq. (5) ) of H2 are generated, respectively.

10,Microbial characterization,"3.3 Microbial characterization Microbial communities in optimized conditions, at the end of the incubation period, were compared to the microbial community in the allochthonous inoculum, by shotgun metagenomics. This approach was used to gain insights into the mechanisms of CPW fermentation and H2 production, by identifying the microorganisms and metabolic pathways. Both taxonomic and functional annotations were assigned to each predicted gene, enabling a taxo-functional analysis of the microbial communities. Based on the quality control of the obtained raw sequences, the latter were within the standards with respect to the metrics currently used for this step (Chen et al., 2018; Ewels et al., 2016) (Table A1). By analyzing the rarefaction curves based on taxonomic information at genus level, it was observed that a plateau was almost reached for the optimized biomass samples, indicating an adequate depth of sequencing to access the microbial taxonomic community content. For allochthonous inoculum biomass samples, the curve remained slightly upward, thus it is not possible to state that the number of sequences obtained was sufficient to fully sample the richness of the microbial community of these samples; however, it was sufficient to access to the dominant taxa and biological functions. The ecological index analysis (Table A2) allowed to compare the values obtained for the biomass samples under optimized conditions and allochthonous inoculum. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H′) takes into account both the number of taxa and its dominance, and indicates greater diversity in the allochthonous inoculum biomass samples (H' = 6.0) compared to the optimized biomass samples (H' = 2.7). Based on the Simpson index, it was observed that, consequently, lower dominance occurred in the optimized assay samples (0.8), in comparison to the inoculum (1.0), probably due to the selection of the populations at optimized conditions, which led to an increase in dominance and, consequently, a decrease in diversity. The richness was compared using the Chao-1 index and the Observed number of taxa, where it was possible to observe greater richness and observed number of taxa for the inoculum (10,204.6 and 10,202, respectively) compared to the optimized conditions (9,222.7 and 8,216, respectively). It is worth noting that the difference between the richness values calculated via Chao-1 and the Observed number, refers to the correction of variance adopted in the calculation of the first index, since it is assumed that the number of observations for a taxon has a Poisson distribution (Hughes et al., 2001). In addition, for the variation estimated by means of the standard error (Chao-1 se), good reproducibility was found, both for the inoculum (if = 3.2, 10.198, 10.199 and 10.209), and optimized samples (if = 84.5, 7,708, 8,140 and 8,800). The variations in the microbial community after the optimization were analyzed for different taxonomic levels. The dataset was associated to 3 different domains (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota) and Viruses, 163 phyla, 466 orders, 423 classes, 848 families and 2,581 genera. Proteobacteria (40.51%), Bacterioidetes (21.24%), Firmicutes (9.76%) and Thermotogae (8.04%) were the average most abundant phyla in the allochthonous inoculum. In the optimized samples, there was a high increase in the dominance of Firmicutes (89.54%), while the abundance of the other mentioned phyla drastically decreased (4.78; 0.55 and 1.57%, respectively). Firmicutes bacteria are specifically known for their syntrophic relationships in anaerobic reactors, as well as the production and degradation of a wide diversity of VFA, such as HAc and HBu (Yutin and Galperin, 2013), the main metabolites obtained in the optimized reactors (HAc 3516 mg/L and HBu 3731 mg/L). Woo et al. (2015) applied RCCD to optimize VFA production from rice straw, concluding that the variables temperature (39.23 °C), substrate concentration (52.23 g/L) and initial pH (10) were significant to obtain the maximum VFA concentration (12,370 mg/L). Similarly to the observations in the present study, the authors reported Firmicutes as the most dominant phylum in these conditions. Consistent with the ecological index values, there was greater diversity in the allochthonous inoculum samples when compared to those after optimization, which is clear in Fig. 3 . Several genera were observed in similar average abundances in the allochthonous inoculum, such as Coprothermobacter (4.32%), Defluviitoga (4.36%), Fervidobacterium (2.93%), Fluviicola (5.01%), Marinospirilum (2.75%), Pseudomonas (2.14%) and Sulfirimonas (11.68%). After optimization, there was a clearly strong selection of the genus Clostridium, and its relative abundance varied from 0.43% in the allochthonous inoculum to 79.78% in the samples of the optimized reactors. In addition, a slight increase in the relative abundance of Paraclostridium was observed, from ≤0.01% in the allochthonous inoculum to 1.93% in the optimized reactors. Clostridium members are gram-positive rods which have varied metabolisms, producing VFA and alcohols (butyric, acetic, formic, lactic and succinic acids and ethanol) from carbohydrates, peptones and other organic compounds (Yutin and Galperin, 2013). Similarly, Rabelo et al. (2018) identified several species of the Clostidiales order in anaerobic reactors to obtain H2 from lignocellulosic residue (sugarcane bagasse). The species identified by the aforementioned authors were Paraclostridium bifermentans (previously C. bifermentans), Ruminiclostridium cellobioparum (previously C. cellobioparum), R. cellulolyticum (previously C. cellulolyticum) and C. sartagoforme. Clostridium beijerinckii is one of the genus identified in anaerobic processes, and is known to able to produce butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, acetone, butyrate and acetate under different operational conditions (Fonseca et al., 2019). This species can consume several sugars, such as glucose, starch, xylose, cellobiose, and shows no preference between glucose and xylose as substrate, being able to consume them both simultaneously (Cebreiros et al., 2019), which is important since xylose is one of the main monomers in CPW (Choi et al., 2015). According to Gomez-Flores et al. (2017), C. beijerinckii is not able to hydrolyze cellulose. However, in a recent study, Cebreiros et al. (2019) reported cellulose hydrolysis products leading to butanol production (4.2 g/L), using a C. beijerinckii DSM6423 strain after enzymatic pretreatment of eucalyptus sawdust as main substrate. In the present study, butanol production was not observed, probably due to the different operational conditions applied, since Cebreiros et al. (2019) used an isolated strain, meaning that with no syntrophic interactions, which are important since these interactions can determine the main pathways in C. beijerinckii fermentation (Gomez-Flores et al., 2017), lead to acetogenesis instead of solventogenesis. Despite the few studies relating the ability of C. beijerinckii to produce H2 (Gomez-Flores et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), C. butyricum, is a well-known species able to be a H2-producer in anaerobic reactors and also to produce butyrate as main metabolite (Detman et al., 2019). According to Detman et al. (2019), these bacteria represent one of the species that preferably use butyric acid fermentation pathways, were sugars are converted to butyrate after glycolysis, or alternatively, lactate and acetate can also be converted to butyrate. In this study, butyrate concentrations of 3,731 mg/L mg/L were observed along the operational time, probably due to monomers conversion. According to Yutin and Galperin (2013), most Clostridium species are able to hydrolyze pectin, one of the main components of CPW, which explains its high relative abundance with the substrate used. The authors state that biotin is the only vitamin required by Clostridium, and products derived from yeast are rich in biotin, such as the yeast extract (YE), a component of the PCS medium, could have favored the growth of Clostridium. Similar results were observed by Villa-Montoya (2019), with higher relative abundance of Clostridium (88%) at pH ≥ 7.0 in mesophilic conditions (30 °C) during H2 production from coffee processing waste. Similarly, after optimizing H2 production from sugarcane bagasse and obtaining 1.5 mmol/L of this compound, Soares et al. (2018) indicated that the most dominant genus was Clostridium (33%) in the optimum conditions (2.77 g/L of yeast extract and 5.84 g/L of sugarcane). Rabelo et al. (2018) reported Paraclostridium bifermentans (62.69%) as one of the main genus in reactors optimized by response surface methodology, applied to sugarcane bagasse anaerobic digestion, where the optimal conditions were 7.0 g/L of bagasse and pH 7.2, leading to the concentration of 23.10 mmol/L of H2. In the present study, Clostridium relative abundance reached up to 79.78% in the optimal conditions. Camargo et al. (2019) observed lower relative abundance of Clostridium (18.67%) with 3 g/L of in natura CPW, 2 g/L of allochthonous inoculum (sludge from UASB reactors applied to sugarcane vinasse thermophilic treatment), 37 °C and PCS growth medium at initial pH of 7.0. Under these conditions, the aforementioned authors observed 13.31 mmol/L of H2 and 4,355 mg/L of HAc concentration. Since in the present study the relative abundance of Clostridium was higher (79.78%), it can be stated that the conditions applied in the optimized reactors (allochthonous inoculum 4 gSTV/L, CPW 29.8 g/L and pH 8.98) were favorable to this genus. Besides, it is possible to associate the dominance of Clostridium to the high HBu production in the optimized assays (3731 mg/L), since this genus is widely known to convert carbohydrates to butyric acid and acetic acid (3516 mg/L in this study). The higher Clostridium relative abundance in the optimized conditions, when compared to the unoptimized conditions (79.78 and 18.67%, respectively), could explain the higher phenol removal in this assay (22.82–22.16 mg/L and 21.16 to 19.21 mg/L, respectively), since it is known that bacteria of this genus are able to consume phenolic compounds to produce hydrogen in anaerobic reactors containing lignocellulosic biomass as substrate (Tai et al., 2010; Villa Montoya et al., 2020). Tai et al. (2010) observed maximum of 67% of phenol removal (~400 mg/L) in reactors with phenol-containing wastewater and 5 g/L of glucose as co-substrate, with predominance of Clostridium butyricum species related to H2 production in these assays. The aforementioned authors also observed that in assays with low toxicity/pH (≤200 mg/L of phenols), this strain tended to assimilate glucose first, while in medium toxicity/pH (≤400 mg/L of phenols), the same strain tended to utilize phenol first. A reduction of Coprothermobacter relative abundance was observed from the inoculum (4.32%) for the optimized samples (≤0.01%), probably due to its affinity with thermophilic conditions (50–70 °C) (Gagliano et al., 2015), since this study was conducted at 30 °C. Coprothermobacter was identified in relative abundance of 41.73% in Soares et al. (2017) in similar allochthonous inoculum (sludge from UASB reactors applied to sugarcane vinasse thermophilic treatment), which can reinforce its affinity to thermophilic conditions. The same occurred to Defluviitoga genus, since its relative abundance was reduced (4.36 to ≤ 0.01%, respectively), and it is known that bacteria from this genus can be identified in reactors applied to anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic waste, such as corn silage and barley, but it has affinity to thermophilic temperatures (55 °C) (Maus et al., 2015)."
11,Gene annotation and pathway mapping,"3.4 Gene annotation and pathway mapping Among the KEGG categories, to which detected genes could be assigned, Metabolism was the most abundant, (12.15 and 13.70%), both for the allochthonous inoculum and optimized samples, respectively. About 78.90% in allochthonous inoculum and 83.50% in optimized samples could not be assigned to any KEGG category. It is worth mentioning that the impossibility to increase the percentage of genes successfully annotated is a current limitation of metagenomics, since low percentages can lead to the incomplete understanding of the microbial community taxonomy and functional potential. In the category Metabolism, the main pathways observed were the metabolism of carbohydrates (5.64 and 8.14%), nucleotides (0.66 and 0.74%), amino acids (1.87 and 1.71%), glycan biosynthesis (1.29 and 0.99%), vitamins and cofactors (1.84 and 1.54%), terpenoids and polyketides (0.40 and 0.28%), secondary metabolites (0.39 and 0.28%), among others (0.012 and 0.04%), for the allochthonous inoculum and optimized samples, respectively. Since there was only an increase in the abundance of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, only the metabolic pathways related to this category were considered for subsequent analysis. Among the main carbohydrate metabolism pathways, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (0.50 and 0.56%), citric acid cycle (0.55 and 0.19%), pentose phosphate (0.52 and 0.61%), galactose (0.32 and 0.99%), starch and sucrose (0.42 and 1.78%), amino sugar and nucleotide sugar (0.45 and 0.57%), pyruvate (0.83 and 1.11%), glyoxylate and dicarboxylate (0.70 and 0.43%), butanoate (0.45 and 0.49%), among others (0.91 and 1.41%), stand out in the allochthonous inoculum and optimized samples, respectively. Noticeably, Clostridium was the main genus associated to the increase in genes related to carbohydrate metabolisms, as well as H2 production. Its increase was indeed observed in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (0.18–83.93%), pentose phosphate (0.33–77.05%), galactose (0.10–86.87%), pyruvate (0.90–84.68%) and especially starch and sucrose metabolisms (1.69–86.52%) (Fig. A4). Similarly, the most abundant KO in the category carbohydrate metabolism were verified, especially those with higher proportions in the optimized samples than in the allochthonous inoculum (Fig. A5). K00615, a transketolase [EC:2.2.1.1] involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, had proportions of about 0.10% in the allochthonous inoculum and 0.17% in the optimized samples. K00656, a formate C-acetyltransferase [EC:2.3.1.54] involved in the pyruvate metabolism (pyruvate formate lyase), was also observed in the optimized samples at higher proportions (0.21%) than in the allochthonous inoculum (0.01%). This enzyme is important in the catalysis of the conversion of coenzyme-A to formate and acetyl-CoA, in anaerobic conditions (Srivastava et al., 2017). The reaction involving K00656 is an intermediate step in the production of acetate from acetyl-CoA, with concomitant H2 production (Srivastava et al., 2017); it is usually associated with several Clostridium species (Levin et al., 2006). In this reversible reaction, pyruvate and CoA are converted into formate and acetyl-CoA; formate can then be converted by formate dehydrogenase to H2 and CO2 (Jia et al., 2017). K01223 was one of the most abundant KO (≤0.001% and 0.26% in allochthonous inoculum and optimized samples, respectively). It is a hydrolase 6-phospho-β-glucosidase [EC:3.2.1.86] involved in glycolysis ( Eq. (6) ). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellobiose monophosphate (6-phospho-β-D-glucosyl-1,4-D-glucose) to D-glucose + D-glucose 6-phosphate. The same KO was observed in batch reactors applied to H2 production from lignocellulosic substrate (coffee processing waste) by Villa-Montoya et al. (2020) and in similar operational conditions (batch reactors operated at 30 °C at pH 7.0). (6) 6 p h o s p h o β D g l u c o s y l ( 1,4 ) D g l u c o s e + H 2 0 ↔ D g l u c o s e + D g l u c o s e 6 p h o s p h a t e K02761 is a cellobiose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase (PTS) system related with the starch and sucrose metabolism; it catalyzes the phosphorylation of sugar substrates with their translocation across the cell membrane (Keyhani et al., 2000). This KO was observed in percentages ≤0.001% in the allochthonous inoculum samples and of 0.19% in the optimized samples. K03737 is a pyruvate-ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase [EC:1.2.7.1 1.2.7.-] and it catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. This enzyme can be related with the metabolism of pyruvate, propanoate and also butanoate (Nakayama et al., 2013). This KO was at the 0.02% level in the allochthonous inoculum samples and 0.19% in the optimized samples. Besides that, when analyzing only the KO in pathways known to be related with H2 production (Villa Montoya et al., 2020) (Fig. 4), it was clear that K03737 was both the most abundant and the one that increased most. Two other KOs related with H2 production were observed at higher proportions in the optimized samples: K04072 (0.1%) and K00016 (0.08%). K04072 is an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase/alcohol dehydrogenase [EC:1.2.1.10 1.1.1.1] involved in several pathways, such as glycolysis, fatty acid degradation, degradation of aromatic compounds, pyruvate and butanoate metabolism, among others. These dehydrogenase enzymes may catalyze the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid ( Eq. (7) ) or also the fermentation of glucose to ethanol and CO2 ( Eq. (8) ) (Goodlove et al., 1989). (7) A c e t a l d e h y d e + N A D + + C o e n z y m e A ↔ A c e t y l C o A + N A D H + H + (8) G l u c o s e + 2 A D P + 2 P i → 2 E t O H + 2 C O 2 + 2 A T P + 2 H 2 O Finally, K00016 is a L-lactate dehydrogenase [EC:1.1.1.27] active in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways and common in all living beings. According to Villa-Montoya (2020), this enzyme could be involved both in the synthesis of lactic acid and alcohols, and also in the inverse route, which allows the H2 production from the same metabolites. In this pathway, the lactic acid can be converted into pyruvic acid after reduction of NAD+ ( Eq. (9) ) that can be converted into H2, CO2 and butyric acid. (9) ( S ) − l a c t a t e + N A D + → p y r u v a t e + N A D H + H + Noticeably, several KO related with H2 production were at lower proportions in the optimized samples than in the allochthonous inoculum, such as K00172, K00171, K00170, K00169 and K00123. Most of these KOs were related with Coprothermobacter, Defluviitoga and Sulfirimonas. It can be assumed that the operational conditions used in the optimized assays were not favorable to these bacteria, since most of them are thermophiles (Gagliano et al., 2015; Maus et al., 2015) and the assays were conducted at 30 °C. The Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes) in the allochthonous inoculum and optimized samples were analyzed by focusing on those directly related with cellulose/hemicellulose or lignin degradation (Janusz et al., 2017). They were quantified and related with the 10 most abundant genus associated to them (Fig. 5 ). It highlighted that the CAZymes were defined according to protein homology, which means that the same CAZy can represent distinct enzymes with different activities (Yin et al., 2012). The Auxiliary Activities (AA) ligninolytic group does not properly correspond to carbohydrate active enzymes, but since it comprises redox enzymes that act in conjunction with them, they are considered jointly. Lignin, for example, is not a carbohydrate but it is invariably associated with polysaccharides in the plant cell wall, where the cellulose fibrils are embedded in a lignin matrix (Janusz et al., 2017). In this study, a few AA genes were identified, but an increase between the optimized sample and the allochthonous inoculum was observed for only two of them: AA7 (from ≤0.001 to 0.04%) and AA4 (from ≤0.01 to 0.02%). According to Li et al. (2019), most of the enzymes related to the lignin depolymerization, such as ligninolytic peroxidases and laccases, are produced by fungi and few aerobic bacteria, where its heterogeneous polymers are oxidized to small aromatic molecules; the strains and mechanisms involved in the anaerobic degradation of lignin are still unclear. In the allochthonous inoculum samples, the genus Burkholderia was highly related (22.22%) with AA3 (cellobiose dehydrogenase), and it is worth mentioning that in a previous study (Akita et al., 2017), this genus was reported as capable of degrading lignin, however, its relative abundance decreased from 0.14 to 0.046% under optimized condition, probably due to the anaerobic environment. The ligninolytic AA7 is associated with glucooligosaccharide and chitooligosaccharide [EC 1.1.3.-] oxidase activities, reducing end glycosyl residues of oligosaccharides linked by α or β-1,4 bonds and glucose. AA4 is a vanillyl-alcohol oxidase [EC 1.1.3.38] group whose enzymes can catalyze the conversion of phenolic compounds with side chains in their aromatic rings into aldehydes. It is important to note that the AA3 group, mostly related with cellobiose dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.99.18] activity, was reduced in the optimized samples (0.001%) when compared to the allochthonous inoculum (0.054%). In the allochthonous inoculum, the main genera related with this group were Aureimonas (24.07%) and Burkholderia (22.22%). Zámocký et al. (2004) as well as Melo-Nascimento et al. (2018), related the Burkholderia genus to extracellular cellobiose dehydrogenase production. The assays with higher allochthonous inoculum concentrations (~5.7 gSTV/L) were those with higher phenols removal, probably due to the higher relative abundance of microorganisms known by their ligninolytic activity, such as Burkholderia (Melo-Nascimento et al., 2018) and other microorganisms adapted to these potential inhibitors. The AA and GH groups work in a synergistic manner since both act on the lignocellulosic structures (Melo-Nascimento et al., 2018). The Glycoside Hydrolases (GH) [EC 3.2.1.-] are a group of enzymes which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates. The cellulase family GH5 was the most increased family in the optimized samples when compared with the allochthonous inoculum (0.071–0.015%, respectively). According to Xia et al. (2014), GH5 exocellulases and members of the order Clostridiales are known to play an essential role in cellulose chain breakdown by expressing these enzymes as an extracellular enzymatic complex (cellulosomes) or non-cellulosomal free CAZymes, which degrade crystalline cellulose. Of the many functions related with the GH enzyme family, it is possible to highlight endo-β-1,4-glucanase/cellulase [EC 3.2.1.4], endo-β-1,4-xylanase [EC 3.2.1.8], β-glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21], β-mannosidase [EC 3.2.1.25] and cellulose β-1,4-cellobiosidase [EC 3.2.1.91]. According to Aspeborg et al. (2012), many enzymes in this group are cellulosomal components of bacteria such as Ruminiclostridium (i.e, R. cellulolyticum, previously C. cellulolyticum) and its optimum temperature range is in mesophilic conditions (Yutin and Galperin, 2013). Thus, it can be stated that the temperature used in this study (30 °C) may have been favorable to such bacteria. Other families related with cellulase/hemicellulase activity were observed, and increased in small proportions from ≤0.001% in the allochthonous inoculum to about 0.01% in the optimized samples, such as GH74, GH28, GH8 and GH48. Among these families, GH74 is highlighted, since it has endoglucanase [EC 3.2.1.4], oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.150] and xyloglucanase [EC 3.2.1.151] activities. Moreover, GH48 is a well-known endocellulase, with reducing end-acting cellobiohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.176], endo-β-1,4-glucanase [EC 3.2.1.4] and chitinase [EC 3.2.1.14] activity, and it is usually related with members of the order Clostridiales (Xia et al., 2014). After sequencing the complete genome of C. beijerinckii isolated from a sugarcane vinasse treatment plant, Fonseca et al. (2019) identified many functional enzymatic classes of the GH group [EC 3.2.1.-], especially related to β-glucosidase activity, such as β-D-glucoside and glucohydrolases [EC 3.2.1.21], which are complementary to cellulose hydrolysis, since they complete the final glucose degradation steps. Additionally, the aforementioned authors identified gene encoding enzymes that are directly involved in H2 production, such as genes encoding the electron carrier ferredoxin, pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase [EC 1.2.7.-], and Fe-hydrogenase [EC 1.12.7.2]. In the present study, the main KO related with the mentioned EC numbers for β-glucosidase activity was K05349 (55%), and with H2 production was K03737 (27.89%) in optimized conditions. Importantly, the family GH23 was dramatically reduced in the optimized samples when compared with the allochthonous inoculum, from 0.11% to 0.01%; this lysozyme is also known as peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase [3.2.1.17]. A possible explanation is that the conditions used in the optimized assay were not favorable to Sulfurimonas, the most abundant genus related with this CAZyme in the allochthonous inoculum (16.36%). The β-1,3- endoglucanase activity in this genus was observed by Villa and Veiga-Crespo (2009). The DESeq2 tool was used to detect differentially abundant genes. A total of 76,061 overabundant genes were detected, representing 52% of the 147,274 detected genes. Overabundant genes were considered as those with an associated p value ≤ 0.005, and more abundant in the optimized biomass samples than in the allochthonous inoculum samples. Most of the genes considered to be significantly overabundant in the optimized reactor samples were highly abundant, as expected (Love et al., 2014). These results were used to analyze the potential metabolic pathways of the process, using the tool Pathview, taking into account the overabundant genes in the samples of the optimized reactors when compared to the allochthonous inoculum. Based on this metabolic pathway analysis. Fig. 6 summarizes the possible conversion pathways of CPW and of the different lignocellulosic compounds to H2, as well as the main organic compounds accumulated during their fermentation in batch reactors using the optimal conditions according to the RCCD approach (30 °C, pH 8.98, 29.8 gCPW/L). In addition, a comparison between the results obtained in this study and studies with other solid wastes as feedstock was done in Table A3. Overall, it can be stated that the conditions applied in the optimized assays were favorable to the establishment of both, lignocellulosic degrading bacteria and also to H2 producing bacteria, such as Clostridium and Paraclostridium members."
12,Conclusion,"Based on the present study, the optimal condition for H2 production from CPW was 4 gSTV/L of allochthonous inoculum, 29.8 g/L of substrate and initial pH of 8.98. The validation assay was performed in these conditions, leading to the concentration of 48.47 mmol/L of H2, which is 3.64 times higher than the concentration value obtained before its optimization (13.31 mmol H2/L). Acetogenesis was the predominant metabolic pathway, with the maximum HBu (3,731 mg/L) and HAc (3,516 mg/L) concentrations obtained in the validation assay. Regarding the metataxonomic profile, it appeared that Clostridium genus was dramatically favored in the optimized samples (79.78%) when compared to the allochthonous inoculum (0.43%). Several genes related to H2 production were identified, such as pyruvate-ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase, pyruvate formate lyase, formate dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, L-lactate dehydrogenase, most of them associated to the genera Clostridium and/or Paraclostridium. Several functions related with lignocellulosic degradation were identified in the optimized samples, such as endo-β-1,4-glucanase/cellulose, endo-β-1,4-xylanase, β-glucosidase, β-mannosidase, cellulose β-1,4-cellobiosidase, cellobiohydrolase, among others. Finally, a differential gene expression analysis enabled to confirm that, among others, cellulose degradation and acetic acid production pathways were overabundant in samples from the optimized reactors."
