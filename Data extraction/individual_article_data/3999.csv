0,Introduction,"Energy is among the most important factors influencing economic and industrial development. Today, combustion of fossil fuels accounts for more than two-thirds of the world's primary energy utilization [1]. The growing global population, the increasing mobility of that population, the increasing production and consumption of goods, and the transportation of those goods are considerable concerns in future energy strategies. The need for clean, efficient, and affordable energy sources is often seen in contrast to the environmental and health issues connected with fossil fuel use. Projections for the next two decades assume the continued leading role of fossil fuel-based energy with a global share of about 30% of primary energy to be needed and utilized in Asia, mainly China and India [1]. While many alternatives to coal, petroleum, and natural gas are currently used or are being discussed for power generation (e.g., hydroelectricity and nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, tidal or wave energy) transportation of people and goods depends on the availability of high-density energy sources, primarily delivered to the market today as liquid fuels derived from petroleum. Because of associated greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel combustion has been identified as a key factor in climate change. As one example, Fig. 1 shows the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union (EU-27) in 2010. Around 80% came from energy-related sources, with about 63% from direct combustion of fuels, including about 20% from fuel combustion for transportation [2]. Emissions from petroleum combustion have also been implicated in the deterioration of air quality and, subsequently, of human health due to the formation of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and soot, and gaseous products from incomplete combustion. Because the transformation to the use of alternative energy sources for transportation is especially difficult, energy-efficient, clean combustion processes remain an important research topic. With advances in the development of engine combustion systems, such as homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) or related strategies that can adapt to a variety of fuels, the use of biofuels as alternative neat fuels or fuel additives is possible [3–7]. Energy independence, possible decreases in CO2, soot, and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and other factors are driving this possibility for transformation, with biomass-related fuel sources preferably grown on wasteland along with the use of agricultural residue, food waste, woody plant parts, or algae biomass presenting important topics of discussion and research [3]. Ethanol is the most widely used biofuel today. More than 7.3 billion gasoline-equivalent gallons of ethanol were used as gasoline additives in 2009 in the USA. The increase in the use of biomass to more than 4% of total primary energy utilization in the USA was therefore mainly due to ethanol production [3]. The largest production of fuel ethanol was in the USA, followed by Brazil (see Table 1 ). In 2010, these two countries accounted for about 86% of global fuel ethanol production [3]. Recent projections from the International Energy Agency [8] suggest that biofuel use will triple from 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) in 2010 to 4.5mboe/d in 2035, driven primarily by blending mandates, with the fuel ethanol supply rising from 1mboe/d in 2010 to 3.4mboe/d in 2035. To put this in perspective, global oil demand in the year 2035 is projected to reach 99.7 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), up from 87.4 mb/d in 2011 [9]. This article presents a comprehensive review of the combustion chemistry of alcohol fuels. The article begins by providing information on the history of alcohol production and use. Sustainability issues are addressed and important alcohol fuel properties are presented. As a prerequisite and background for the necessity of detailed combustion chemistry research, the combustion of alcohols and alcohol fuel blends in engines is addressed, with a focus on emission characteristics. The experimental and theoretical tools for addressing combustion chemistry of fuels are highlighted to provide an understanding of desired information and observable quantities. With the stage thus set, the article aims to give an extensive overview of fundamental combustion chemistry by considering studies of alcohol fuels in shock tubes, rapid compression machines, jet-stirred and flow reactors, and laminar flames. The value of information from such experiments is critically discussed. Subsequently, alcohol combustion chemistry is discussed by presenting a large body of experimental and modeling investigations covering the combustion of C1–C5 alcohols, with a special emphasis on ethanol and the butanol isomers. Ignition, flame propagation, qualitative species assignment, and full quantitative speciation, depending on the specific combustion regime, are considered. The combustion kinetics and development of a comprehensive mechanism relevant to alcohol combustion is presented. The article closes by presenting a summary of the distinguishing features of alcohol combustion chemistry and an outlook toward future research in this area."
1,"Alcohol fuels – origins, sustainability, properties, and present use","Ancient civilizations converted grains to ethanol using fermentation to produce low-alcohol-content wines and beers. Archaeologists have discovered primitive forms of distillation equipment dating back to antiquity [11], but these were used primarily to purify plant essences for medicinal purposes [12] and to make perfumes. Allchin [13] suggested that excavations in the Indian sub-continent together with ancient texts from the region provide evidence that distillation of alcoholic beverages dates back to c. 500 BCE. However, the first written account [14] of boiling wine and observing flammable vapors is found in the writings of Jabir ibn Hayyan (c. 721–815 CE). Al-Kindi (c. 801–873 CE) later described the distillation of wine in his Kitab al-Taraffuq fi al-‘itr (The Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations) [14]. This early knowledge of wine distillation by Arab chemists was transmitted to the West, and Latin texts from the medical schools of Salerno (c. 1100 CE) mention the production of highly pure alcohol [15]. Up to the present, distillation remains the industry standard for separation and purification of alcohols. Today, the primary source of ethanol continues to be microbial fermentation of sugars and starches. It is envisaged that in the future, lignocellulose will also be a source [4,7]. Historically, methanol was produced from the destructive distillation of pyrolyzed wood, but more recently it has been made from natural gas or coal via gasification to synthesis gas followed by methanol synthesis. Industry-scale renewable routes to methanol exist in the form of replacing coal with biomass in gasification processes [4]. The two isomers of propanol (n-propanol and iso-propanol) are typically produced from petrochemicals, but novel biological routes employing Escherichia coli are being explored at the laboratory scale [16,17]. The production of butanol isomers from biomass feedstock dates back to 1861 when Louis Pasteur first documented the fermentation of sugars to n-butanol [18]. The early 1900s witnessed a large growth in n-butanol production when Chaim Weizmann, while attempting to produce n-butanol for synthetic rubber production, discovered that Clostridium acetobutylicum could convert sugars into a mixture of acetone–n-butanol–ethanol (ABE) [18]. This production process reached commercial scales in the 1930s and 1940s, after which it lost market share to the more economically viable petroleum-derived n-butanol. Nigam and Singh [19] and Lee et al. [20] briefly reviewed the recent activities in bio-butanol research and indicated that biological pathways exist for the production of n-butanol, iso-butanol, and 2-butanol [16,21]. The fourth isomer of butanol, tert-butanol, is a petrochemical product. The higher alcohols, including the isomers of pentanol and hexanol, are currently derived from petrochemicals on relatively small scales. The production of pentanol and hexanol isomers (e.g., 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-pentanol) from biological sources has become an area of recent research activity [16,22,23]. In their book “The Forbidden Fuel: A History of Power Alcohol”, Bernton, Kovarik, Sklar et al. [24] provide a comprehensive history of the production and use of alcohol fuels (primarily ethanol) in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as the political and market factors leading to the eventual rise of petroleum fuels. Methanol (i.e., wood alcohol), derived from destructive distillation of wood, and ethanol were commonly used as lamp fuels prior to the 19th century. The first internal combustion engines developed in the 19th century, including those by Samuel Morey, Nikolaus Otto, and George Brayton, utilized ethanol as the fuel. Numerous engineers in the early 20th century observed that ethanol and ethanol/gasoline blends had anti-knock properties. The industrialist Henry Ford (founder of Ford Motor Company) and research engineer Charles Kettering (former Vice President of General Motors and former President of the Society of Automotive Engineers) were strong proponents of ethanol as a fuel for internal combustion engines in the USA. The internal combustion engine designer Sir Harry R. Ricardo extensively studied the use of alcohol fuels in combustion engines. In the Introduction to his 1931 book, “The High-Speed Internal Combustion Engine”, Ricardo [25] advocated the use of alcohol fuels. He explained, “It is perfectly well known that alcohol is an excellent fuel, and there is little doubt, but that sufficient supplies could be produced within the tropical regions of the British Empire, yet little or nothing is being done to encourage its development.” Ricardo then presented numerous experimental results testing hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., paraffins, aromatics, olefins, and naphthenes) and alcohol fuels in both spark-ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines. His pioneering early work on pre-ignition, which eventually led to the development of fuel octane ratings, showed that ethanol allowed for operation at a higher compression ratio due to its decreased pre-ignition propensity. Ricardo also noted that alcohol fuels had higher latent heats of vaporization and lower flame temperatures than petroleum-based ones, and that these properties could be exploited to increase power output and decrease thermal losses."
2,Origins and sustainability,"2.1 Origins and sustainability This review of research on alcohol fuel combustion chemistry would be incomplete without at least a brief mention of the intensely debated issues around biofuel sustainability. The highly cited articles by Farrell et al. [26] and Goldemberg [27] demonstrated that renewable ethanol fuel can be sustainably produced in many countries. More recently, researchers [28,29] showed that indirect land-use change (i.e., deforestation of Amazonian forests) caused by biofuel plantations in Brazil needs to be critically assessed to ensure sustainable production. A review on biofuels by Koh and Ghazoul provides a unique perspective on the environmental and societal impacts of biofuels [30]. The rapid policy-driven growth of biofuel use has led to serious environmental and food security concerns. Current biofuel technologies compete with the food industry for feedstock, and the diversion of corn, rice, and oilseeds to biofuel production is cited as the cause of rising food prices and global food shortages. In addition, large amounts of forested lands are being destroyed for biofuel feedstock production, leading to a loss in biodiversity and carbon-rich sinks. The competition for fresh water resources presents an additional barrier to widespread biofuel use. Despite these challenges, advances in biofuel feedstock and production technologies may have the potential to ameliorate the negative impacts of biofuels. It is clear from the literature that conventional bio-alcohol production from food crops, most notably corn, has limited potential [28,31]. Reasons for this include competition from the food industry [32], limited agricultural land for crop growth [31], and high energy input requirements for agricultural chemicals and harvesting [28]. For biofuels to live up to their potential as suitable alternative fuels, lignocellulosic biomass must be considered. Agricultural and forest residues as well as sources of lignocellulosic biomass offer advantages over food crop feedstock. These advantages include the ability for lignocellulosic biomass to be cultivated on marginal agricultural land, lower agricultural chemical requirements, lower energy requirements, and the potential for utilizing the lignin portion of the biomass as an energy source for the production process. For these reasons, the projected net energy gains from lignocellulosic alcohols are much higher than those from corn-based alcohol production technologies, and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions would then be much lower. Despite these inherent advantages, the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock to fuels is not yet at commercial scale, primarily because it is challenging to convert lignocellulosic biomass to alcohols without offsetting some of the possible net energy savings [28,31–33]."
3,Alcohol fuel properties,"2.2 Alcohol fuel properties Fuel property requirements for SI engine fuels are dictated by ASTM D4814, Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuels, and for CI engine fuels by ASTM D975, Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils. The physical and chemical properties of several alcohol, gasoline, and diesel fuels are presented in Table 2 . This limited data set includes some of the important properties relevant to utilization of alcohol fuels in combustion systems. The table includes all C1–C4 isomers, two C5 isomers, and normal C6–C8 isomers of alcohols along with their molecular structures. The following conclusions can be drawn from Table 2. • An increase in the molecular weight of alcohol fuels corresponds to a decrease in the oxygen content (wt%) and an increase in the carbon and hydrogen content. This results in an increase in the energy content, indicated by the fuel's volumetric lower heating value (LHV). C1–C3 alcohols have significantly lower LHVs than gasoline and diesel. Use of C1–C3 alcohols therefore tends to reduce fuel economy (i.e., miles per gallon). Alcohols with four or more carbons have LHVs closer to that of gasoline, and are thus beneficial for improving fuel economy [34]. • The presence of the hydroxyl moiety in alcohols causes them to be liquid at room temperature and thus suitable fuels for transportation applications. The lower alcohols (C1–C2) have lower boiling points, which depresses front-end distillation when blended with gasoline and diesel fuels. At present, US regulations fix ethanol concentrations in gasoline, so refiners vary butane concentrations in the fuel to meet summer and winter front-end distillation specifications. In conventional carbureted SI engines, this often leads to the problem of vapor lock, but recent developments in fuel injection (e.g., port fuel and direct injection) are more tolerant of volatile fuels [34]. Nevertheless, altering the distillation curve modifies fuel spray formation, vaporization, and in-cylinder mixture stratification, which are important design considerations for modern low-temperature combustion (LTC) engines [35,36]. The C3–C8 alcohols tend to have boiling points in the mid-point of the gasoline/diesel fuel range; they can be blended with petroleum fuels at greater concentrations with lesser impact on the fuel distillation curve. • The latent heat of vaporization (ΔH vap) of alcohols is significantly higher than those of petroleum gasoline and diesel fuels, which negatively impacts the ability to start the engine under cold conditions (i.e., cold-start). However, current advances in fuel delivery systems are largely able to deal with this problem. The higher molecular weight alcohols have less difficulty with cold-start operation due to their lower specific latent heat of vaporization. A fuel's latent heat of vaporization can also affect in-cylinder thermal stratification, which is important for controlling excessive pressure rise rates in LTC engines [35,36]. • The hydroxyl moiety in alcohols introduces a dipole moment to the non-polar hydrocarbon backbone. C1–C3 alcohols have short hydrocarbon chains, so they are more polar and more soluble in water than non-polar hydrocarbons. This fact lowers the upper limit of blending in petroleum fuels without the use of a co-solvent. Their water affinity also introduces challenges in their distribution infrastructure, which must prevent water contamination. Higher alcohols are increasingly less polar due to their longer non-polar hydrocarbon chains. They are thus easier to blend with non-polar hydrocarbons and they have lower affinity for water. • The ignition propensity (i.e., knock resistance, octane rating) of alcohols is perhaps their most attractive feature for internal combustion engine applications. A high octane rating correlates with a lower propensity for ignition and allows the SI engine to operate at a higher compression ratio without knocking. Methanol, ethanol, and propanol isomers have high research octane number (RON) and have long been used to improve the octane number of SI engine fuels. Butanol isomers have octane ratings similar to that of conventional gasoline and are thus suitable for SI engines. C5- and larger alcohols have octane ratings that are lower than that of gasoline, and hence decrease knock resistance when blended with petroleum SI engine fuels [37]. However, a decreased octane number correlates with an increased cetane number (i.e., greater propensity for ignition), making the larger alcohols suitable for CI engine applications. Alcohol fuel branching such as methyl substitution tends to decrease the ignition propensity (i.e., increase the octane number). Later sections of this paper provide fundamental explanations of how chemical features such as hydroxyl moiety and methyl substitution affect the ignition propensity. • An interesting feature of alcohols is their high sensitivity, defined as the research octane number minus the motor octane number (S = RON−MON). This unique fuel property can have benefits in modern LTC engines and highly boosted direct injection spark ignition (DI SI) engines that prefer high sensitivity fuels [38]."
4,Present use of alcohol fuels,"2.3 Present use of alcohol fuels Given the documented history of the use of alcohol fuels since the internal combustion engine was developed and their favorable physical–chemical properties, it is no surprise that alcohols continue to be attractive fuels for today's modern SI and CI engines. The purpose of this study is to highlight the importance of alcohol combustion in engines and thus to motivate the full investigation of their combustion chemistry. The following articles give a comprehensive overview of the use of alcohol fuel in engines. • Agarwal [7] reviewed a large body of literature to conclude that ethanol can be blended with gasoline fuel to improve engine performance and reduce emissions of CO and unburned HCs in exhaust. Up to 20% of ethanol can be blended with diesel fuel to reduce CO and NOx emissions. Hansen et al. [6] also discussed the potential uses of ethanol-diesel fuel blends, highlighting important blending characteristics and safety considerations. • Giakoumis et al. [44] studied diesel engines running on blends of ethanol or n-butanol with diesel fuel under transient conditions. They concluded that alcohol/diesel blends decrease engine-out PM and CO emissions, while increasing unburned HC and oxygenated (e.g., carbonyl) emissions. A clear trend on NO x emissions was not observed. • n-Butanol was studied as a fuel or as a blending agent for use in SI engines [34,45–52], CI engines [46,53–62], and motored engines [63]. iso-Butanol has also received attention from engine researchers with studies performed on SI engines [64–67] and in CI engines [68,69]. Niass et al. [70] demonstrated that 2-butanol and tert-butanol could be blended with gasoline fuel for improved engine performance. • In a series of papers, Gautam et al. studied combustion [34] and emission [47] characteristics of C1–C5 normal alcohols blended with gasoline. Their results indicated that there was substantial knock resistance when using alcohol fuels blends as well as an ability to reach higher compression ratio operation. • Vancoillie et al. [71] recently demonstrated the use of methanol as a fuel for SI engines at diesel-like efficiencies (up to 50%) and emission levels comparable to or lower than those of gasoline. In summary, these papers suggest that alcohols with various molecular structures (i.e., carbon number and substitution) can be used in today's SI and CI engines with minor modifications to the engine design. However, the details of the combustion chemistry of alcohol fuels, including pathways to potential pollutants, are less understood than are those of the hydrocarbons that constitute today's petroleum-derived transportation fuels [72]. Some aspects of concern regarding their perceived “cleaner combustion” image are the emissions of carbonyl species, such as formaldehyde (CH2O), acetaldehyde (ethanal, C2H4O), acetone (C3H6O), acrolein (propenal, C3H4O). These compounds present an air quality concern because they are toxic and irritating, as well as being precursors to urban smog (e.g., free radicals, ozone. and peroxyacyl nitrates) [73–75]. Pang et al. [76] conducted carbonyl emissions measurements in SI and CI engines using blends of ethanol–gasoline and ethanol–biodiesel–diesel. Their results showed that ethanol blending reduced tailpipe emissions of CO and PM, but increased total tailpipe carbonyl emissions. Engine-out emissions included high concentrations of acetaldehyde (e.g., see Fig. 2 ), which is a product of ethanol combustion. Armas et al. [77] showed that ethanol and butanol blends with diesel could reduce PM during warm engine start, whereas combustion instabilities led to increases in unburned hydrocarbon and CO emissions under cold-start conditions. Similarly, addition of n-butanol was seen to decrease smoke density, CO, and NOx emissions in diesel-n-butanol blends [57], but it increased (not further specified) unburned hydrocarbon emissions. The use of increasing amounts of n-butanol in gasoline in HCCI engines was seen to significantly influence formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions in a study by He et al. [78]. Formaldehyde levels increased with increasing n-butanol addition, almost irrespective of engine speed. The study concluded that formaldehyde, once formed, cannot be further oxidized in the cylinder under the conditions tested because n-butanol blending advanced ignition timing, reduced combustion duration, and decreased in-cylinder temperatures during the exhaust stroke. Emission of acetaldehyde were nearly independent of engine speed under the conditions investigated, but at any given exhaust valve closure timing, acetaldehyde levels increased with the amount of n-butanol in the blend (Fig. 3 ). Such effects were suggested to be a result of the different reaction mechanisms of gasoline and n-butanol to form acetaldehyde [78]. Reviewing several earlier studies, the authors suggested the level of aldehyde emission is a function of engine type, load, and combustion mode in addition to different pathways that may lead to their formation. Aldehyde formation and emission from combustion sources may cause underestimated health problems. A study by Jacobson [79] concluded that widespread ethanol use may increase the risk of cancer and ozone-related illnesses due to higher aldehyde emissions and increased unburned ethanol emissions, which break down to acetaldehyde in the atmosphere. Combustion chemistry studies of alcohols can help to determine the importance of oxygenated emissions by elucidating the role of fuel-bound oxygen during combustion. It is challenging to draw broad scientific conclusions from vehicle engine studies, especially in terms of emissions characterization, because of the highly variable nature of tested boundary conditions across studies (i.e., engine-out versus tailpipe, after-treatment technologies, varying loads, speeds, engine types, fueling methods, intake temperatures and pressures, and operating conditions). Nevertheless, engine research demonstrates the utility of alcohol fuels in practical applications and motivates the revision of regulatory policies around fuel and emission standards. Work on scientific approaches toward understanding the effects of alcohol fuels on combustion is the focus of the remainder of this paper, wherein fundamental chemical kinetic combustion experiments and simulations with well-defined boundary conditions are described. The fundamental combustion properties to be reviewed for alcohol fuels are the premixed laminar flame speed, homogenous ignition delay time, and product species distributions from gas-phase oxidation/combustion."
5,Fundamental combustion experiments,"Combustion in internal combustion engines is a complex process involving fuel atomization, vaporization, fuel-air mixing, ignition, and combustion. For example, Dec [80] has presented a phenomenological description, or “conceptual model”, for diesel combustion in a direct injected (DI) CI engine. As shown in Fig. 4 , liquid fuel is injected as a high-velocity spray into the combustion chamber, where it vaporizes upon impingement with high-temperature, high-pressure in-cylinder gases. Low-temperature reactions spontaneously ignite portions of premixed fuel and air at local equivalence rations of about 2–4 (i.e., fuel-rich conditions), which results in rapid heat release. The remaining fuel spray is then consumed in a high-temperature diffusion flame. Combustion gases are produced throughout the expansion process with insufficient oxygen available to completely oxidize all the intermediates. This unsteady, heterogenous, three-dimensional process is challenging to model, and it is difficult to decouple physical mixing processes from chemical kinetic processes. A similar conceptual model has recently been presented for partially premixed LTC diesel engines under low-load conditions by Musculus, Miles, and Pickett [81]. Computer simulations are capable of combining fluid dynamics, spray dynamics, chemical kinetics, and heat and mass transfer to reproduce ignition behavior, pollutant formation, energy release, and other features of engine operation. Such simulations are widely used in the automobile industry to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions. Westbrook et al. [82] provided a thorough review of computational combustion methods and their applications toward simulation of combustion in SI, CI, and HCCI engines. Typically, these engine simulations are computationally expensive, so simplifications in fluid dynamics, spray dynamics, and elementary chemical kinetics are made to run them on present personal computing technologies. Reducing the chemical fidelity in simulations would limit our ability to understand the comprehensive combustion chemistry of alcohols. Recent studies by Westbrook et al. [83,84] have shown that an understanding of engine-relevant phenomena can be obtained using detailed chemical kinetic models in simpler reacting flow simulations, given the appropriate boundary conditions. For example, the effects of oxygenated hydrocarbons on soot emissions from diesel engines were studied [83] using detailed kinetic modeling simulations of idealized rich premixed ignition and combustion of diesel surrogate fuels. The boundary conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratios) were obtained from Dec's conceptual model for DI CI diesel engine combustion [80]. The relative sooting tendencies of various fuels were then determined by summing the concentrations of soot precursors (e.g., acetylene, benzene, ethylene, toluene, etc.) following the rich ignition event. In separate studies, Westbrook has shown that similar simulation approaches can be used to the predict gasoline fuel octane ratings [85], HCCI engine pressure traces [85], and biodiesel fuel cetane ratings [84]. The success of the aforementioned approach toward improving an understanding of fuel effects in engines motivates us to first describe the study of alcohol fuel in idealized combustion systems (e.g., reactors and flames). In this way, the fuel's combustion chemistry can be precisely modeled, such that the effects of the molecular structure of the alcohol on combustion and emissions can be understood. We then delve deeper into the chemical kinetics and combustion chemistry mechanisms of alcohols, including simulation of idealized reactors using detailed chemical kinetic models. Finally, we demonstrate some examples of utilizing detailed chemical kinetic modeling simulations to understand alcohol fuel effects in internal combustion engines."
6,Combustion properties in selected idealized experiments,"3.1 Combustion properties in selected idealized experiments Investigating the combustion chemistry of alcohols requires conditions under which chemical kinetic processes govern the conversion of the fuel and oxidizer into products, and where mixing processes are considered negligible or at least limited only to gas-phase diffusion (e.g., perfectly mixed or slow mixing). These requirements have led researchers to the use of idealized reactors and flames for studying the global gas-phase combustion chemistry of alcohols at various temperatures, pressures, and mixture compositions. These include, but are not limited to, homogenous gas-phase batch reactors (e.g., shock tubes and rapid compression machines), jet-stirred reactors, plug flow reactors (e.g., laminar flow and turbulent flow reactors), laminar premixed flames, and non-premixed diffusion flames. The fundamental combustion properties investigated using these experimental systems include the homogenous ignition delay time, premixed laminar flame speed, and product species distributions from gas-phase oxidation and/or pyrolysis. The respective property can be monitored as a function of time t, temperature T, pressure P, or a specific spatial coordinate x. It has been demonstrated that a fuel's homogenous ignition delay can be correlated with its octane rating [86,87], which is a critical parameter for engine design and operation. Kalghatgi [88] notes that octane ratings are primarily determined by chemical kinetics rather than physical fuel effects (e.g., latent heat of vaporization, density, viscosity, physical mixing effects, etc.). The premixed laminar flame speed is a fundamental indicator of fuel reactivity at high temperature, and is also a critical parameter for determining the turbulent flame speed in engines. The emissions formed upon fuel oxidation and/or pyrolysis in ideal reactors are indicative of the species formed in engines under similar temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio conditions. Thus, understanding combustion in idealized systems can offer insights into a fuel's performance in practical engines. It is important to note that several researchers have had success studying alcohol combustion chemistry in non-idealized experimental setups. For example, Haas et al. [89] used an ignition quality tester to study the ignition chemistry of butanol isomers in reacting sprays. By matching the physical properties of the fuels, they were able to attribute differences in ignition delay times to chemical kinetic processes rather than physical processes (e.g., spray formation and droplet vaporization). In addition, HCCI engines have been used to study the combustion chemistry of alcohol fuels with reasonable levels of success. Some notable studies include investigations on interesting features such as HCCI engine low- and intermediate-temperature heat release and combustion phasing for ethanol [59,90–95], n-butanol [59,96], and iso-pentanol [97]. These studies offer insights into alcohol fuel/engine interactions, and describe engine-related phenomena that could be better understood with fundamental combustion experiments at relevant temperature, pressure, and mixture fraction conditions. The homogenous ignition delay is the time it takes for a homogenous gas-phase fuel/air mixture at a specified temperature and pressure to reach an explosive state resulting in a rapid release of heat and a rise in temperature and pressure. Ignition delay time measurements for fuel/air mixtures at high pressures (e.g., greater than 10 bar) and low to intermediate temperatures (e.g., 600–1000 K) tend to correlate well with fuel octane and cetane ratings, and thus are the most relevant to engine operating conditions. Fuels with longer ignition delay times under the aforementioned conditions tend to have higher octane numbers and lower cetane numbers. Ignition delay time measurements at lower pressures, higher temperatures, and/or on highly diluted mixtures are not representative of real engine conditions, but still provide valuable data for the testing and/or validation of chemical kinetic models. Recent reviews on low-temperature ignition are available in this journal by Battin-Leclerc [98] and by Zádor et al. [99]. Battin-Leclerc [98] presents a comprehensive description of various experimental setups used for measuring ignition delay times. For alcohols, these properties have been largely measured using rapid compression machines (RCMs) and shock tubes (STs). In both experiments, a test gas mixture comprising fuel, O2, and a diluent (e.g., N2, Ar, etc.) is rapidly raised to the desired temperature and pressure, and then held under near-constant-volume conditions until an ignition event occurs, typically measured as a rapid pressure rise or chemiluminescence emission. Fig. 5 presents typical ignition delay time measurements obtained in shock tubes and RCMs. When interpreting and modeling shock tube data, it is important to consider how the measurements were performed [100,101] and the existence of pre-ignition pressure rise [102,103]. Two approaches exist for handling pre-ignition pressure rise in zero-dimensional homogenous batch reactor simulations: the volume-varying approach and the pressure-varying approach. In the former method, the experimentally measured pressure time-history is converted to a volume history [102] (assuming isentropic compression) for use in the simulation, whereas in the latter approach the measured pressure profile up to the ignition time is used in the simulation to constrain the pressure. RCM data also need to be carefully interpreted by evaluating the compression time, compression ratio, heat losses before and after the end of compression [104–106], and potential reactions during the compression stroke. Ignition is a transient process of fuel reacting with oxygen to form intermediate species that eventually result in a radical chain-branching process [107]; experiments in stirred reactors and flow reactors that measure the transient and/or steady-state formation and destruction of low- and intermediate-temperature species can also aid in understanding the ignition chemistry of alcohols. Further details on the chemical mechanisms of low-temperature ignition unique to alcohol fuels are described in Section 4. The premixed laminar flame speed is simply defined as the velocity at which a flame front propagates into an unburned gas mixture at a fixed temperature, pressure, and mixture composition. It is a fundamental combustion property that is employed in describing more complex combustion phenomena existing in engines, such as the turbulent flame speed, flame structure, flame stabilization and instabilities, and flame extinction [109]. The laminar flame speed is an idealized combustion property that cannot be measured exactly. Therefore, experiments measuring laminar flame speeds attempt to achieve near-ideal conditions and account for non-ideal effects, such that they can be subtracted from the experimental data [109]. Laminar flame speed measurements of alcohols have been performed using a variety of experimental arrangements, including counterflow diffusion flames, spherically propagating flames, and burner-stabilized flames. The propagating flame front is typically observed using direct photography of the luminous zone, shadowgraphy, or schlieren imaging. A schematic of the counterflow twin-flame configuration at the University of Southern California [110], which has been used to measure the laminar flame speeds of many C1–C5 alcohols, is shown in Fig. 6 . The effects of the molecular structure of alcohol fuels on laminar flame speeds are discussed in Section 4. Emissions are undoubtedly a chief concern in the use of combustion technologies. Correlating the kind and quantity of combustion-generated species with the molecular structure of the fuel again requires experiments with idealized flames and reactors. The distribution of species depends on the type of experimental apparatus and its operating temperature, pressure, and mixture composition. Species generated from alcohol fuel combustion have been studied in shock tubes, RCMs, premixed flames, non-premixed diffusion flames, flow reactors, and stirred reactors. The species within the reacting gas and/or burnt gas mixture are analyzed online by using optical diagnostics or offline by transferring gases into a chemical analyzer. Online diagnostic techniques do not disturb the idealized flow conditions in the experiment, and they preserve the chemical nature of the test gas being sampled. These methods can measure a limited number of species present at relatively high concentrations using a variety of absorption and emissions spectroscopy techniques in the UV to IR wavelength ranges [111,112]. Offline techniques offer the ability to measure a larger number of species at lower concentrations than offered by online techniques, but at the expense of perturbing the experiment and test gas during the sampling process. The test gas is often extracted to a gas chromatograph with various detectors (e.g., flame ionization detector, thermal conductivity detector, mass spectrometer) or infrared spectrometers (e.g., Fourier transform infrared detector, non-dispersive infrared detector). Fig. 7 displays a flow reactor used at Ghent University to study the pyrolysis of alcohol fuels using several offline GCs. More recently, molecular-beam sampling into a differentially-pumped mass spectrometer (MBMS) [113–117] has proven a powerful tool for measuring a large number of stable and radical species from alcohol combustion with minimal disturbance to the reactive zone and/or sampled gases. In combination with synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single photon ionization, the MBMS technique (PI-MBMS) is even able to provide isomer-resolved quantitative species information from reactive environments such as the reaction zone of a flame [118,119]. Most recently, the technique was extended by the successful combination of a molecular-beam flame-sampling setup to a photoelectron photoion coincidence spectrometer (PEPICO) [120]. This technique adds an additional analytical dimension due to the observation of molecule-specific transitions from the neutral to a specific ionic state. First results show a high sensitivity for radical detection in combination with highly reliable isomer identification even for large species and multicomponent mixtures [120]. Table 3 presents a comprehensive summary of fundamental combustion experiments conducted on C1 to C6 alcohols, along with the diagnostic techniques employed in each, and the experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and mixture fraction). The remaining sub-sections in this section critically review the large body of experimental data on alcohol fuels presented in Table 3. The objectives of this review are as follows. • To elucidate historical trends in on the combustion chemistry of alcohol fuels. This is achieved by presenting a graph on the number of papers published for each family of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanols, etc.) per year since 1970. • To identify the variety of experiments and the range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture fractions studied for each of the alcohols, with an aim to highlight gaps on which future work could focus. • To identify exemplary experimental data sets that will aid in testing the detailed chemical models for elucidating the combustion chemistry of alcohols. • To reveal peculiar and intriguing experimental phenomena that require further investigation."
7,Developments in experimental combustion research on alcohols,"3.2 Developments in experimental combustion research on alcohols Fig. 8 presents a graph on the number of refereed journal articles published each year (since 1930) that describe alcohol combustion experiments. Accompanying the graph are 4-dimensional plots (see Fig. 9 a–e) representing the approximate range of temperatures, pressures, equivalence ratios, and years at which alcohol combustion has been studied. Only premixed oxidation studies are presented in the 4-D plots (i.e., pyrolysis and non-premixed flame studies are excluded). The earliest articles on alcohol combustion actually date back to the 1930s when researchers [254–256] were studying the “slow combustion” of methanol at low temperatures (400–750 °C) and sub-atmospheric pressures. These were the first studies to show that methanol thermally decomposes in two stages (CH3OH→H2 + CH2O→2H2 + CO), as well as to measure the reaction rates. Around the same time, Schultz and Kistiakowsky [257] studied the thermal decomposition of tert-butanol and tert-iso-amyl alcohol (1,1-dimethylpropan-1-ol) at 487–555 °C and sub-atmospheric pressures, identifying the low-lying molecular elimination pathways forming an alkene and water. From 1957 to 1960, Barnard [189,201,202] continued to study the pyrolysis of alcohols (iso-propanol, n-butanol, and tert-butanol), identifying the presence of carbonyl products (e.g., ketones and aldehydes), elucidating reaction mechanisms, and deriving kinetic rate coefficients. These pioneering studies were motivated by the chemist's fascination with various organic molecule reactions; there was no mention of the relevance of such work to alcohol as a fuel for energy applications. Nevertheless, these early experimental works contributed to laying foundations for understanding the combustion chemistry of alcohols, including the development of experimental methods, diagnostic techniques, reaction mechanisms, and rate coefficient evaluations. Together with theoretical work by Hinshelwood et al. [258] on chemical kinetics theory and by Semenov [259] on chain reactions, a detailed understanding of the combustion chemistry of alcohols was made possible. Indeed, the water elimination pathways observed by Schultz and Kistiakowsky [257] were recently shown to affect the ignition delay times at high temperatures of tert-butanol [260], and the greater concentrations of carbonyl products seen by Barnard [189,201,202] during alcohol pyrolysis when compared with alkane pyrolysis explains why these emissions are a source of concern in alcohol-fueled engines. Articles published in the 1970s through the 1990s reported results from alcohol combustion in experimental systems similar to those used in laboratories today (e.g., shock tubes, flow reactors, and premixed flames). The early works state, as their motivations, the need to understand the fundamental combustion chemistry of alcohols because of their potential use as alternative sources of fuels for internal combustion engines. The idea was then proposed that fundamental combustion experiments, on such topics as the ignition delay time and the premixed laminar flame speed, could aid practical engine design. These experimental studies were largely limited to methanol and ethanol, and there was less than one article published per year over the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. In 2003, there was a sharp increase in the number of articles published per year on these topics. From 2003 to 2013, the number of articles published is more than double that of all prior years combined. Ethanol became a topic of interest, while methanol and propanol isomers studies averaged of one or two papers per year. The significant growth in interest was in butanol isomers, on which there have been numerous papers published since 2008. Historically, there has been a scarcity of fundamental combustion data on higher alcohols (i.e., C5 and larger), as is also true for high molecular weight hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, aromatics, etc.). These low vapor pressure compounds complicate fuel vaporization and subsequent condensation in transfer lines, thus making it challenging to achieve well-defined mixture compositions in the reactor/flame. Experimentalists are overcoming these issues by using atomizers/nebulizers to produce ultra-fine droplets/aerosols together with various heating methods to promote vaporization and prevent condensation (e.g., diluent gas pre-heaters, heated transfer lines, heating jackets, etc.). Thus, the body of experimental data on higher alcohols is expected to grow considerably over the next decade. The recent interest in C4 and larger alcohols is a result of the industry's interest in using alcohols with higher energy densities in transportation applications, the design of novel synthetic biological routes to produce higher molecular weight alcohols, and the combustion scientist's ability to generate high-quality fundamental combustion data rapidly."
8,"Methanol, ethanol, and isomers of propanol","3.3 Methanol, ethanol, and isomers of propanol The summary of fundamental combustion experiments given in Table 3 provides an overview of the available studies relevant for development and testing of gas-phase reaction kinetics for the respective alcohol fuel and its derived intermediates. The list includes data acquired for pure, gaseous combustion of the respective alcohol under well-defined conditions and provides properties such as ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and species concentration profiles. Beyond these kinetics-related investigations, a substantial number of investigations focusing on the combustion properties of the liquid fuel (e.g. [261],) or the influence of alcohol addition to hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. [262–266],) are not considered herein. Similarly, studies on the “slow combustion” of alcohols, meaning a reaction time of several seconds up to some minutes conducted in the 1950's (e.g. [267]), and studies on oxidation of alcohols in supercritical water [268–271] are excluded herein. Cathonnet et al. [272,273] conducted a series of experimental studies on the oxidation and pyrolysis of methanol. Ignition delay time measurements are available for temperatures ranging from 700 K to 2800 K, a stoichiometry range of ϕ = 0.2–6, and pressures up to 40 bar are reported. The majority of ignition delay data was acquired from shock tubes in the 1970s and early 1980s. Extensive studies on shock tube ignition of methanol are provided by Bowman [123] and Tsuboi et al. [128]. Both cover a temperature range between 1500 and 2000 K and a wide stoichiometry range and offer parameterized expressions of their results. Bowman [123] additionally provides concentration time histories for some species. More recent studies are scarce; RCM results [151] were obtained in the low-temperature regime, while other studies focus on a wide range of topics and provide just a limited number of conditions for methanol [142,150,274]. Ignition delay times for ethanol are available up to 1900 K and 80 bar in the stoichiometry range of ϕ = 0.25–2. Studies in the high-temperature regime date back the 1990s and earlier spanning twenty-nine individual conditions, Dunphy and Simmie [275] provide the largest dataset for ethanol ignition. The parameterized ignition delay times are determined in a range of 1000–1700 K, ϕ = 0.5–2.0, and pressures between 2 and 4.6 bar. More recent investigations (e.g. [173,181]) of ethanol ignition are focused on the lower temperature region including results from RCMs. Overall, the amount of available ignition delay time measurements is somewhat larger than for methanol. Propanol is the smallest alcohol existing in different isomeric structures (n- and iso-propanol). Nevertheless, the available experimental data for both propanols are limited. Ignition delay time measurements are just provided by four studies [150,193,196,200]. Johnson et al. [193] provide a direct comparison of both isomers, and they report a higher reactivity of n-propanol compared to iso-propanol. A comparative study of all normal alcohols (including methanol, ethanol and n-propanol) was recently provided by Noorani et al. [150] with ignition delay times measured under comparable conditions. They concluded that ignition delay times for the alcohols (except for methanol) would be identical for a given stoichiometry which, however, is not correctly reproduced by the kinetic models tested in their study. A similar conclusion is drawn by Veloo et al. [110] when investigating laminar flame speeds in the lean-to-stoichiometric regime of methanol, ethanol and n-butanol. Laminar flame speeds for the C1–C3 alcohols are available for the stoichiometry range of 0.7–1.5 and for pressures up to 10 bar. Flame speed measurements are accessible by a broad variety of experiments and are typically measured with air as the oxidizer. For methanol and ethanol, several groups have measured experimental data under comparable conditions. Recent results are available using high-speed schlieren measurements in constant volume combustion chambers [145,148,167], from heat flux burner measurements [152,176], and flow field determination by PIV (particle imaging velocimetry) in a counterflow premixed flame setup [110]. In general the database is a little larger for ethanol than for methanol while for propanol just two papers report flame speeds [197,198]. Quantitative species profiles are the most challenging test case for kinetic models. Speciation data of methanol combustion from a variety of different flame and reactor experiments are available for temperatures and pressures up to 2100 K and 100 bar. For methanol, the quantitative data are primarily available from reactor experiments for temperatures below 1000 K. Typically some or all product and reactant species are traced, for example in the most recent study of Aranda et al. [153] that extends the database up to pressures of 100 bar. Additionally, concentrations of formaldehyde and some other intermediate species (CH4, H2, CO) are determined in most reactor studies. Compared to reactor experiments, quantitative data from higher temperature flame environments [127,131,134] are surprisingly scarce for methanol. The most detailed investigation from Vandooren and van Tiggelen [127] dates back to 1981 and provides fourteen species profiles obtained for three lean premixed flames. Speciation data for ethanol is available for a wide range of conditions and experiments. Pressures up to 10 bar and a temperature range up to 2400 K have been covered. Several MBMS [166,170,177,276–278] and other flame-sampling methods [165,168,184] provide detailed insights to the high-temperature regime. In contrast to methanol, higher molecular species (e.g., higher aldehydes such as acetaldehyde and soot precursors such as benzene) are detectable in rich ethanol flames. This is related to ethanol reaction pathways forming C2 hydrocarbons such as ethylene or ethyl radicals. Lower temperatures are covered by a similar number of various reactor studies. Even though no typical low-temperature regime exists for ethanol, recent results confirm a distinct reactivity even at temperatures below 800 K [186,279], which is rarely covered by most kinetic models. Again for the propanol isomers, only a limited number of speciation studies are available. Conditions cover pressures up to 10 bar and temperatures up to 2000K, while no speciation data was reported below 750 K. Extensive studies are provided by Kasper et al. [194] and Li et al. [192], both providing a large number of stable and radical species for flames of both isomers measured using MBMS setups with isomer-specific detection."
9,Butanol isomers,"3.4 Butanol isomers The four isomers of butanol are n-butanol, iso-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol. Prior to the 1990s, literature studies on the butanol isomers were limited to pyrolysis conditions. Interestingly, the primary focus was to determine decomposition rate of tert-butanol pyrolysis using batch reactors and shock tubes [202–205]. Norton and Dryer [133] were the first to reveal species profiles evolving from the atmospheric-pressure oxidation of tert-butanol in a flow reactor. A growing interest in the combustion of butanol isomers began in the mid-2000s with McEnally and Pfefferle's [206] study on the decomposition and hydrocarbon growth processes of non-premixed co-flow diffusion methane flames doped with 3500 ppm of each of the four isomers of butanol. Gas samples extracted from the flame revealed that the butanol isomers produce much higher concentrations of aldehydes and ketones than normal alkane dopants. They also showed that the substituted butanol isomers produce more propene and butene relative to n-butanol, which forms more ethylene. Their flame study motivated speciation studies in non-premixed counterflow diffusion flames of n-butanol [211,213], iso-butanol, and tert-butanol [227]. Detailed flame structures of low-pressure premixed burner-stabilized flames of all four butanol isomers were measured by Oβwald et al. [221] using MBMS. Subsequent low-pressure premixed flame studies with MBMS were conducted for n-butanol [218,225] and iso-butanol [232]. These flame speciation studies provide quantitative data and cross-comparisons of important aldehydes, enols, and alkenes produced during the combustion of the four butanol isomers. The premixed laminar flame speeds of the butanol isomers have also been measured at a wide range of conditions [110,150,210,214,217,228,236]. Other detailed speciation studies include experiments in ideal reactors under oxidation and pyrolysis conditions. Jet-stirred [208,211,215] and flow reactor [227] oxidation data is available at a range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios for all isomers of butanol. Atmospheric pressure pyrolysis flow reactor data has also been presented for all butanol isomers [216,224,225,233]. Species profiles during homogenous gas-phase ignition have been obtained in RCMs [220] and STs [111,112,230]. The ignition delay times of the butanol isomers have also received significant attention in the past 7 years. Moss et al. [207] studied the high-temperature ignition characteristics of all four butanol isomers in shock tubes, and concluded that tert-butanol is the least reactive isomers while n-butanol is the most reactive. These high-temperature results were later confirmed and extended to wider ranges of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios [108,212,230,240]. Although of relevance to engines, data for low- and intermediate-temperature ignition of the butanol isomers are limited. Weber et al. [104,105] conducted RCMs studies of all butanol isomers under high pressures and low temperatures of direct relevance to reciprocating engines. Only n-butanol has been studied under such conditions in STs [219,223,240] because ignition delay times for the other butanol isomers exceed maximum test times unless driver gas tailoring is employed."
10,Higher alcohols,"3.5 Higher alcohols As mentioned earlier, the experimental data available on higher alcohols (C5 and larger) are limited. For the pentanol isomers, there are data on n-pentanol [103,246], 3-methyl-1-butanol [245,249,250,252] (i.e., iso-pentanol), and 2-methyl-1-butanol [250,251]. Togbé et al. [246] studied n-pentanol and Dayma et al. studied iso-pentanol combustion [245] in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 bar and a range of temperatures and equivalence ratios. n-Pentanol produced 1-butene and pentanal, whereas iso-pentanol produced more iso-butene and 3-methyl-1-butanal. Similar to their other studies on butanol isomers, n-pentanol and iso-pentanol did not show low-temperature reactivity under these experimental conditions. Their data on various primary alcohols (namely, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-pentanol, and n-hexanol) revealed that they all produced similar intermediate molar fractions of formaldehyde, whereas secondary alcohols (namely, iso-propanol and 2-butanol), yielded less formaldehyde. Ethanol was shown to produce more acetaldehyde than the other tested alcohols, regardless of their structure. Similar JSR experiments on n-hexanol by the same group [244] yielded similar speciation results, except that hexanal was also observed. n-Hexanol exhibited low-temperature cool flame reactivity under the tested conditions, which was not seen in smaller alcohols. Yeung et al. [253] also measured species generated during combustion of n-hexanol in a counterflow diffusion flame and noted appreciable amounts of 1-pentene and 1-hexene. To compare the various pentanol isomers, Tang et al. [250] measured ignition delay times in shock tubes at temperatures above 1100 K, pressures of 1.0 and 2.6 bar, and varying equivalence ratios. Their results showed that the ignition delay times decreased in the order of iso-pentanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and n-pentanol, indicating that methyl substitution decreases reactivity. Heufer et al. [103] measured ignition delay times for n-pentanol and n-hexanol in a shock tube and RCM, spanning 9–30 bar and low to high temperatures, and compared them to previous measurements of alkanes. Their results showed that alcohol fuels ignite significantly faster compared to alkanes in the high temperature regime, whereas at low intermediate temperatures, the C5 and C6 alcohols exhibit negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior similar to C5 and C6 alkanes but with lower reactivity. In a recent premixed laminar flame speed study on 2-methyl-1-butanol, Li et al. [251] acquired data across a remarkable range of equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.6–1.8), initial temperatures (393, 433, and 473 K), and initial pressures (1–7.5 bar), as shown in Fig. 10 . Such a complete laminar flame speed data set at the elevated temperatures and pressures relevant to practical engines demonstrates the current state-of-the-art in measuring this fundamental combustion property."
11,Chemical kinetics of alcohol combustion,"Many combustion processes, including reactions in the flame zone resulting in heat release, reactions controlling ignition, and air pollutant formation mechanisms, occur at times when temperature and pressure are changing rapidly. These processes depend on the rate of each individual chemical reaction (i.e., the reaction kinetics), which are governed by the temperature, pressure, and the concentration of reactants and products. A recent review by Simmie [280] describes the development and application of chemical kinetics models of hydrocarbon fuel combustion. A chemical kinetic model consists of a reaction mechanism, species thermochemical data, and species transport data. The reaction mechanism describes the molecular level transformation of reactants (i.e., fuel and air) into products via a series of elementary steps. The chemical kinetic model is coupled with a physical model describing the geometry and operating regime of the specific combustion application. A large number of differential conservation equations describing the mass, momentum, energy, and species concentration are numerically integrated to generate species concentration and heat release profiles [281]. The governing equations can be solved using a numerical solver that evaluates the chemical kinetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of each differential element as time proceeds. A commonly used program for simulating chemically reacting flow systems is Reaction Design's CHEMKIN suite [282]. Other commonly used programs for simulating combustion include CANTERA [283,284], OPENSMOKE [285,286], CMCL Innovations' kinetics [287], and DETCHEM [288]. The CHEMKIN suite provides modeling of a wide range of combustion instruments, including shock tubes, premixed flames, diffusion flames, and partially and perfectly stirred reactors. Chemical kinetic mechanisms are coupled with thermochemical data on all the species in the mechanism to calculate forward and reverse reaction rates based on the principle of microscopic reversibility. Transport properties of the species are also included when attempting to model a combustion process in which mixing processes, such as diffusion, are rate-controlling (e.g., premixed and non-premixed flames). The process for developing and validating chemical kinetic models was outlined by Frenklach et al. [289] and summarized by Simmie [280]. Fig. 11 presents a flowchart of the model development process. Chemical kinetic models are developed and tested against experimental data from one or more well-characterized combustion experiments, such as those described above. The flowchart indicates that developing and validating a model is an iterative process involving experiments and simulations, which are combined to achieve a refined model. Computational chemistry and reaction rate theory are important for the accurate determination of reaction rate, thermochemical, and transport data, while sensitivity and reaction flux analysis help identify areas of the kinetic model that warrant further refinement. The remainder of this section discusses the development of chemical kinetic models for alcohols, specifically the formulation of reaction mechanisms and selection of rate coefficients. Not discussed are methods for determining thermochemical properties (e.g., group additivity [290–292] or ab initio calculations [293]), and methods for determining transport properties (e.g., empirical correlations) as described elsewhere [211,248,252,294–297]. Finally a consistent chemical kinetic model for common C1–C5 alcohols (i.e., methanol, ethanol, both propanol isomers, all four butanol isomers, and two pentanol isomers) is presented with the aim to improve understanding of the combustion chemistry of alcohols."
12,The molecular structure of alcohols,"4.1 The molecular structure of alcohols Before considering comprehensive chemical kinetic models, we should first understand the structural features of alcohols that distinguish them from other fuels and that, in turn, affect their molecular level transformations during combustion. Alcohols contain a hydroxyl moiety connected to a hydrocarbon chain, which results in unique thermochemical and reaction kinetics properties in comparison to hydrocarbons. These effects include phenomena such as weaker C–H bond strengths where the carbon is bound to the hydroxyl moiety and hydrogen bonding interactions when reacting with OH and HO2 radicals. These unique features provide interesting discussion points in regard to the combustion chemistry of alcohols. The molecular structures of alcohols are routinely determined using quantum chemistry software packages (e.g., Gaussian 09 [298]) to identify the most stable conformers and then to calculate bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The CBS-QB3, G3, and G4 composite methods are usually selected for their reported accuracies of 1.0 and 1.1 kcal mol−1, respectively [248,252,299–301]. Fig. 12 presents the results of such a calculation for n-pentanol [248] and iso-pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol) [252] showing the lowest energy conformer and BDEs calculated using various levels of theory. Extensive discussions on these calculations and comparisons amongst various levels of theory (e.g., G4 and CBS-QB3) are presented in Refs. [248,252]. Fig. 13 presents C–H and O–H BDEs calculated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory for methanol, ethanol, two propanol isomers, four butanol isomers, n-pentanol, and iso-pentanol [248,252]. Even considering the 1 kcal mol−1 uncertainty, there are some clear trends among the various alcohols. The O–H BDEs are strong in all alcohols, making it difficult to abstract the hydrogen atoms. The presence of the hydroxyl moiety weakens the C–H bond at the adjacent α-site, such that these hydrogen atoms are the easiest to abstract from all alcohols. The α-site in methanol is a primary C–H bond with the highest BDE (∼96 kcal mol−1) of all the α-C-H bonds in the alcohols. The α-sites in ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, n-pentanol, and iso-pentanol are secondary C–H bonds (BDE ∼95 kcal mol−1), whereas iso-propanol and 2-butanol contain tertiary α-sites with BDE ∼94 kcal mol−1. The rate coefficients for hydrogen abstraction on a per H-atom basis increase in the order of primary α < secondary α < tertiary α. The β-sites in the alcohols exhibit stronger than expected C–H BDEs, which is a consequence of the weakened adjacent α BDEs. The β C–H bonds are again ordered in decreasing strength for primary (∼103 kcal mol−1) < secondary (∼100 kcal mol−1) < tertiary (∼98 kcal mol−1) sites. The effects of the hydroxyl moiety are diminished beyond the β site [302], wherein the subsequent γ, δ, and ε C–H BDEs are identical to those of alkanes (e.g., primary (∼102 kcal mol−1) < secondary (∼99 kcal mol−1) < tertiary (∼96 kcal mol−1)). In the absence of any secondary effects (e.g., hydrogen bonding with OH radicals), hydrogen abstraction rates from the γ, δ, and ε sites can be estimated from established rate rules for alkane fuels [260]."
13,Formulation of comprehensive chemical kinetic models,"4.2 Formulation of comprehensive chemical kinetic models The comprehensiveness of a chemical kinetic model is measured by its ability to describe combustion phenomena extensively. A model is not considered comprehensive if it has only been tested against a single experiment because the role of each elementary reaction varies with temperature, pressure, and composition. For example, reactions between hydrogen atoms and fuel molecules are dominant in fuel-rich conditions, while reactions between hydroxyl radicals and fuel molecules dominate in fuel-lean conditions. Many reactions are important only at low temperatures, while others are dominant at high temperatures. In early work on chemical kinetic mechanisms for hydrocarbon combustion, Westbrook and Dryer [303] and Basevich [304] explained that a comprehensive model must be compared against experimental data covering chemically reacting flows at various temperatures, pressures, and reactant compositions in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, flow and stirred reactors, and laminar flames. This approach presents a challenge for modelers because experimental data spanning such a wide variety of conditions are lacking for the higher molecular weight alcohols. The development of a comprehensive model for alcohol fuels requires a basic understanding of hydrocarbon oxidation in combustion systems. This was first described by Semenov [259] in his description of free radical chain reactions in combustion systems, and led to the later descriptions by Lewis and von Elbe [305–307]. Westbrook and Dryer [303] and Basevich [304] applied these methods to small hydrocarbons, Miller and Bowman [308] to nitrogen combustion chemistry, and Battin-Leclerc [98] to low-temperature alkane oxidation. Comprehensive models for various alcohols exist in the literature, including Westbrook and Dryer's early methanol model [309], Marinov's [310] and Egolfopoulos et al.'s [159] ethanol models, and Sarathy et al.'s [260] butanol isomer model, to name a few. Following a recent review by Tran et al. [311], Table 4 presents a summary of comprehensive chemical kinetic models currently available for alcohols along with their experimental targets. A single comprehensive model capable of elucidating similarities and differences in the combustion of various C1–C5 alcohols is not available in the literature; however, such a model is needed to highlight differences in ignition delay times, premixed laminar flame speeds, and important combustion products. We therefore present a consistent C1–C5 alcohol model herein, but the reader should not consider this a “new” modeling study. Instead, this is an assembly of data on reaction mechanisms, rate coefficients, and species thermodynamic and transport properties available in the literature. The complete modeling files in CHEMKIN-PRO [282] format are available as Supplementary Material to this publication and from the KAUST website cpc.kaust.edu.sa. The chemical kinetic model was compiled and tested using a commercial version of CHEMKIN-PRO [282], so researchers using older non-commercial CHEMKIN versions or other simulation tools are encouraged to contact the corresponding author when compatibility issues hinder the models usage. Compiling a comprehensive model for alcohol fuel combustion first requires the election of a certain modeling methodology. At present, there are various methods for building a comprehensive chemical kinetic model, but most revolve around the same principles. Essentially, a model should include a consistent set of reaction classes and rate coefficient estimations or “rate rules”. Battin-Leclerc et al. [315] recently reviewed automatic generation methods for building chemical kinetic models, all of which have been used to develop models for alcohol fuels (e.g., CNRS Nancy's EXGAS by Battin-Leclerc et al. [207,316], MIT's RMG by Green et al. [121,233], and Milano's MAMOX by Ranzi et al. [317,318]). In this study, we follow the manual generation methods employed by Curran et al. [319,320] for large alkane combustion. Some key points described by Basevich [304] and Westbrook and Dryer [303] are considered, such as: • The chemical kinetic model should reproduce quantitative combustion properties, such as the rate of energy release, ignition delay time, premixed laminar flame speed, and product compositions. • The model should be detailed enough to be useful for kinetics investigations and explanations of combustion phenomena, for which simple schemes are not suitable. • The model should be developed in a hierarchical manner because combustion sequentially fragments the fuel into smaller intermediate species and eventually final products. For example, the early work by Warnatz [321] and Dove and Warnatz [322] demonstrated that laminar flame speed simulations of many hydrocarbons and methanol are primarily sensitive to the small molecule reactions H + O2 ⇄O + OH, CO + OH⇄CO2+H, and H + O2(+M)⇄HO2(+M). • A scarcity in fundamental kinetics data presents a concern because rate coefficients for many important reaction rates for alcohols are unknown. To resolve these concerns, one should compile experimental data on measured rate coefficients, utilize available quantum chemistry and theoretical rate calculations, and rely on estimates when necessary. • While this approach does present uncertainties, the objective is to limit the tuning of rate coefficients to force agreement between experiment and model, and to preserve the generality of the reaction mechanism. This approach is favorable because the mechanism can be easily updated as new reaction pathways and more accurate rate coefficients (measured or calculated) become available."
14,"Reaction mechanism, reaction classes, and rate rules","4.3 Reaction mechanism, reaction classes, and rate rules The detailed reaction mechanism for C1–C5 alcohols includes both low-temperature and high-temperature kinetic schemes for alcohol fuels. The mechanism is compiled in a hierarchical manner, starting with the oxidation of small hydrocarbons and alcohols, and then sequentially adding reaction mechanisms for larger alcohols. The base C0–C2 hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism used here is the recently published AramcoMech 1.3 developed at the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) by Metcalfe, Burke, and Curran with Ahmed from Saudi Aramco [314]. Their H2/CO/O2 sub-mechanism is based on the work of Kéromnès et al. [323]. The C4 and C5 alkane and alkene sub-mechanisms were taken from Healy et al. [324]. The methanol and ethanol sub-mechanisms are from the recent work of Metcalfe et al. [314] and Mittal et al. [187], respectively. The n- and iso-propanol sub-mechanism is from Johnson et al. [193] with several modifications explained by Man et al. [200] plus several important low temperature reaction pathways. For the higher alcohols, including the four butanol isomers and two pentanol isomers (n-pentanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol), few models [233,248,249,252,260] are comprehensive, such that they can be used to simulate both low-temperature and NTC reactivity (e.g., ignition) and high-temperature combustion phenomena (e.g., laminar flame speeds). Thus, the mechanisms for butanol isomers by Sarathy et al. [260], n-pentanol by Heufer et al. [248], and iso-pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol) by Sarathy et al. [252] are chosen for the present analysis. The important reaction classes are discussed in greater detail below. As noted previously, these reaction classes follow from methodologies initially established by Westbrook and Dryer [303,309] and later applied to n-heptane modeling by Curran et al. [319]. Several reaction classes that are not unique or important for alcohol combustion are omitted in the present manuscript. Readers are referred to the Supplemental Material of [260] for a more detailed discussion. Fig. 14 presents a generalized scheme for the primary mechanism of alcohol oxidation, to which the pyrolysis reactions are added for a complete mechanism. Methanol and ethanol do not exhibit low-temperature reactivity under typical combustion conditions, so including comprehensive low-temperature reaction pathways is not required. Table 5 presents experimentally measured reaction rate coefficients available in the literature for various alcohol-related reactions. This table is cited along with references to theoretical studies to highlight important rate coefficient studies, existing discrepancies, and areas for future work. The reaction classes included for alcohol oxidation are shown in Box 1 , approximately in sequence along the oxidation reaction from fuel to fully oxidized products. 4.3.1 Reaction class 1: unimolecular alcohol decomposition At high temperatures (above 1500 K) and under fuel-rich or pyrolysis conditions, the consumption of alcohols is dominated by unimolecular decomposition. Such reactions are important for correctly simulating soot emissions in fuel-rich combustion, ignition delay times in highly diluted environments, and non-premixed diffusion flame structures. In all alcohols, these reactions consist of simple C–C and C–H bond scission reactions. Unimolecular water elimination (i.e., dehydration) reactions are also important for alcohols. Moc et al. [325] explained that these reactions proceed via stretching of the C–O bond with a concomitant stretching and breaking of a C–H bond (α, β, γ, δ, etc.). They proceed via three-center (α carbon), four-center (β), five-center (γ), or larger transition state rings. The four-center reactions involving the β hydrogen atoms are the most thermodynamically favored and result in the formation of an alkene and water, as shown in Fig. 15 . The rates of these reactions can be determined experimentally, and several important studies are presented in Table 5. The rate coefficients of four-center dehydration reactions vary with the extent of substitution because this affects the number of abstractable β hydrogen atoms and their BDEs (i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary). The structure of the product alkene affects the global reactivity of the alcohol. 4.3.2 Reaction class 2: H-atom abstraction from the alcohol H-atom abstraction reactions are the primary means by which fuel alcohols are consumed in combustion environments. A variety of small radical species can abstract hydrogen atoms from alcohols (e.g., H, OH, HO2, O, CH3O2, CH3O, CH3, C2H5, etc.). The most important radicals are OH and HO2 radicals at low and intermediate temperatures and H radicals at high temperatures and/or under fuel-rich conditions; only rate coefficients and branching ratios for these will be discussed in this review. In alcohols, the H atoms can be characterized as hydroxyl, α, β, γ, etc., as well as primary, secondary, or tertiary (Fig. 13). These reactions are typically written in the forward direction (i.e., H/OH/HO2 + fuel), and the reverse rate coefficients are calculated based on the principle of microscopic reversibility. The rate coefficient for abstraction depends on the radical species and the type of H atom being abstracted. As shown previously, hydrogen bound in the OH moiety is the most difficult to abstract, followed by primary H atoms, while tertiary H atoms are the weakest and most easily abstracted. α C–H bonds are weaker due to the nearby presence of the OH group, whereas β C–H bonds are slightly stronger than analogous bonds in an alkane molecule. Accurate temperature-dependent rate coefficients and branching ratios for H-atom abstraction by OH radicals are especially important for simulating alcohol reactivity from 500 to 1500 K. As shown in Table 5 direct rate measurements of these reactions have been performed either at low temperatures (e.g., <400 K), which are of relevance to atmospheric chemistry, or at high temperatures above 1000 K. H-atom abstraction reactions by HO2 radicals have not been directly measured for any of the alcohols. The lack of direct measurements across the range of combustion temperatures thus requires application of computational theory and estimation methods to determine the appropriate rate coefficients for reaction mechanisms [326]. 4.3.3 Reaction classes 3 and 4: alcohol radical decomposition and alcohol radical isomerization Fuel radicals can undergo unimolecular decomposition via β-scission at high temperatures (e.g., above 900 K). In these reactions, the bond once removed from the radical site (i.e., β to the radical site) break to form an unsaturated species and another radical. β-scission of C–C and C–H bonds leads to the formation of unsaturated alcohols or alkenes (i.e., CC bonds), whereas β-scission of the O–H bonds results in the formation of an aldehyde (i.e., CO bond). Fuel radicals can also isomerize by transferring H-atoms from any carbon/hydroxyl site to the radical site. The rate coefficient for these reactions depends on the nature of the C–H bonds broken and formed (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary, or hydroxyl) and on the ring strain energy barrier. Typically, radical isomerizations involving 5-, 6-, or 7-member transition state rings are considered due to their lower ring strain energies. 4.3.4 Reaction classes 5–9: reactions involving unsaturated intermediates (enols and carbonyls) Carbonyls are formed in appreciable quantities during alcohol combustion. At high temperatures, H-atom abstraction and β-scission of parent alcohols can result in the formation of aldehydes/ketones. At lower temperatures, the reaction of α-hydroxyalkyl radicals with O2 leads to the direction formation of carbonyls. Typical carbonyl intermediates include formaldehyde (methanal), acetaldehyde (ethanal), propionaldehyde (n-propanal), acetone, butyraldehyde (butanal), and all possible isomers for C3 and larger carbonyls. A thorough review of aldehyde/ketone combustion is not available in the literature, and preparing one is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Highlighted briefly are several recent studies on carbonyl combustion experiments and modeling. The destruction pathways of formaldehyde have been extensively studied because all hydrocarbons are converted to CO through formaldehyde. Li et al. [313] presented a comprehensive chemical kinetic modeling study of formaldehyde combustion, and also reviewed much of the previous experimental and theoretical studies. Recent studies on combustion of propanal [327] and butanal isomers [328] were conducted by Veloo et al., and they present a complete discussion of previous works on these fuels. In general, aldehydes are consumed via hydrogen atoms abstracted from the weakly bound aldehydic H–CO site, following by α-scission to form CO and an alkyl radical. Larger aldehydes can exhibit low-temperature reactivity via oxidation of their alkyl intermediates [327,328], as shown in Fig. 16 . Enols are common intermediates during the combustion of alcohols via dehydrogenation. The isomerization of enols to aldehydes or ketones (i.e., enol–keto tautomerization) are slow in the gas-phase due to large energy barriers (∼56 kcal/mol) [329]; however, these reactions occur rapidly in the condensed phase or on surfaces [212]. The ketone/aldehyde tautomer is typically more stable than the enol form, such that reaction mechanisms need to include all realistic pathways for such tautomerization reactions. Enol–keto tautomerizations and isomerizations catalyzed by H radicals [218], as well as isomerizations catalyzed by HO2 [330] are important. The H radical catalyzed isomerization can proceed via an α-hydroxyalkyl intermediate species (e.g., C2H3OH + H⇄sC2H4OH; sC2H4OH⇄CH3CHO + H). Additionally, these reactions can be chemically activated, such that pressure dependent rate coefficients are necessary [218,331,332]. Reactions of an enol + HO2 forming an aldehyde + HO2 are based on the acetaldehyde/ethenol work of da Silva and Bozzelli [330]. These reactions are faster pathways of enol-keto isomerization given suitably high levels of HO2. These reactions are important for enols (i.e., CC–OH). Enol-keto isomerization catalyzed by carboxylic acids (e.g., formic acid), which is an interesting reaction mechanism recently proposed by da Silva [333], may also be important in combustion systems. By means of theoretical calculations, he explains that formic acid reacts with vinyl alcohol (i.e., ethenol) to form acetaldehyde via a double hydrogen shift mechanism, as shown in Fig. 17 . The proposed reaction is shown to be fast at low temperatures and with low concentrations of formic acid and is therefore important under atmospheric conditions [333]. Other important reactions for enols include H-atom abstraction reactions, addition of H radicals to double bonds, unimolecular decomposition of enols, and enol radical decomposition reactions [334,335] 4.3.5 Reaction class 10: reaction of O2 to α-hydroxyalkyl radicals to directly form an aldehyde/ketone + HO2 The reaction pathway involving the reaction of molecular oxygen to α-hydroxyalkyl radicals to directly form an aldehyde/ketone and HO2 is known to occur rapidly in the atmosphere. Some notable studies of this reaction include those in n-butanol [336,337] and iso-butanol [338]. Despite the known importance of this reaction pathway, there is very little information regarding the rate coefficient at combustion relevant temperatures. Recently, Zádor et al. [339] and da Silva et al. [340] conducted studies on the α-hydroxyethyl + O2 reaction system. They showed that the aforementioned reaction proceeds through an activated α-hydroxy-ethylperoxy adduct that rapidly decomposes to acetaldehyde + HO2. Furthermore, the decomposition reaction occurs with such a low barrier that conventional low-temperature chain branching pathways are unimportant, as shown in Fig. 18 . This reaction pathway essentially inhibits the low-temperature ignition behavior of alcohols. This reaction class should be included at all temperatures because the reaction of α-hydroxyalkyl with O2 can be competitive with β-scission reactions up to 1000 K (e.g., premixed flames, intermediate-temperature shock tube, etc.). 4.3.6 Reaction class 11: addition of O2 to alcohol radicals (R + O2 ⇄ROO) The addition of molecular oxygen to fuel radicals can form stabilized hydroxyalkyl peroxy radicals (ROO), and thus initiate the low-temperature chain branching process. These reactions are important in C4 and larger alcohols, but their rates have not been investigated in detail. From analogy with alkanes [319,320], the rate of O2 addition to a fuel radical may depend on whether the radical carbon is a primary, secondary, or tertiary site. Additional work is needed to determine rate coefficients for this reaction class using quantum chemical potential energy calculations and master equation methods. 4.3.7 Reaction classes 12–14: R + ROO⇄RO + RO, R + HO2 ⇄RO + OH, and R + CH3O2 ⇄RO + CH3O Reactions classes 12, 13, and 14 are grouped together because they are analogous reactions. Each reaction proceeds through a chemically activated ROOR′ adduct which decomposes to RO + R′O (where R′ = R, CH3, H). The reactions are analogous to CH3 + HO2 ⇄CH3O + OH [341]. 4.3.8 Reaction class 15: ROO radical isomerization (ROO⇄QOOH) including Waddington type reaction mechanism The second step in the low-temperature radical chain branching process is the intramolecular H-abstraction of hydroxyalkyl peroxy radicals (ROO) to form hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxy radicals (QOOH). The most important isomerizations include 5-member, 6-member, and 7-member transition state rings. For alcohols, the reaction rate coefficients for these reactions are not well studied, so estimations techniques are required. The rate coefficient depends on the nature of the broken C–H bond (i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary) and on the ring strain energy barrier [260]. Waddington type reaction pathways [342,343] are known to be a characteristic part of alkene oxidation, but are part of alcohol oxidation too. These reactions involve the β-ROO radical undergoing a six-membered ring isomerization to abstract an H atom from the hydroxyl moiety (i.e., forming an alkylhydroperoxide alkoxy), followed by a rapid decomposition. These reactions are chain propagating and compete directly with low-temperature chain branching pathways, thereby inhibiting low-temperature reactivity. Sun et al. [344] conducted theoretical calculations on these Waddington reactions for tert-butanol and iso-butanol systems. Their study suggests that the β-ROO radical almost exclusively reacts via the Waddington mechanism. Recently, Welz et al. [345,346] described Waddington-type pathways involving hydrogen transfer from the OH group as important for the γ-ROO and δ-ROO radicals via 7- and 8-membered transition state rings. 4.3.9 Reaction class 16: concerted eliminations (ROO⇄enol + HO2) The concerted (direct) elimination of HO2 from the ROO radical occurs via a 5-membered transition state and was first discovered in alkanes by Quelch et al. [347]. The same type of reactions is expected to occur in alcohols. Zádor et al. [99] explain that the O–O moiety leaves the ROO molecule, and takes an H atom from the adjacent C atom with it. This reaction pathway competes directly with the ROO radical isomerization pathway to QOOH. Therefore the concerted elimination path competes with the chain branching path and reduces overall low-temperature reactivity. It is also responsible for the majority of HO2 and enols formed in the low- and intermediate-temperature regimes. The rate coefficient may depend on the nature of both the C–OO bond and the C–H bond broken (i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary) during the direct elimination reaction; however, there is a lack of fundamental experimental and theoretical rate parameters studies on this reaction class for alkanes, let alone alcohols, to develop such a rigorous rate rule. 4.3.10 Reaction classes 17–20: ROO + HO2 ⇄ROOH + O2, ROO + H2O2 ⇄ROOH + HO2, ROO + CH3O2 ⇄RO + CH3O + O2, and ROO + ROO⇄RO + RO + O2 ROO can undergo bimolecular reactions with various radicals (e.g., HO2, CH3O2, ROO) to form ROOH, which readily decomposes to RO and OH radicals (i.e., class 21). ROO can also react with H2O2 to form another stable species and a peroxy species. This reaction sequence interconverts H2O2 to ROOH, which can decompose at relatively lower temperatures to produce OH radicals. These reactions are discussed in further detail in the previous alkane work of Curran et al. [319,320]. 4.3.11 Reaction classes 21 and 22: ROOH⇄RO + OH and RO decomposition The decomposition ROOH species leads to the formation of two reactive radical species. This reaction pathway is generally unimportant because the pathways forming ROOH from RO2 (i.e., classes 17 and 18) are in competition with the RO2 ⇄QOOH isomerization reaction pathways (i.e., class 15). However, it cannot be completely neglected because the concerted elimination pathway (i.e., class 16) increases the HO2 concentration, which enhances the ROO + HO2 ⇄ROOH + O2 (i.e., class 17) pathway. The β-scission of RO radicals leads to production of an alkyl/hydroxyalkyl radical plus an aldehyde/ketone/acid. 4.3.12 Reaction class 23: formation of epoxy alcohols via cyclization The cyclization of a QOOH radical to form an epoxy alcohol (i.e., analogous to a cyclic ether in alkane oxidation) plus an OH radical is an important pathway that competes with the critical chain branching channel QOOH + O2 ⇄ OOQOOH (i.e., class 25). The activation energies and rate coefficients for these reactions are not well known for alcohols, so alkane data [319] can be used as an estimate. This particular reaction is minor, as cyclic epoxy alcohols have not yet been measured in significant quantities during alcohol combustion [345,346]. 4.3.13 Reaction classes 24 and 25: QOOH⇄enol + HO2 (radical site β to OOH group) and QOOH⇄alkene + carbonyl + OH (radical site γ to OOH group) The decomposition of a QOOH with a radical site β to the hydroperoxy group leads to the formation of an enol plus HO2. The decomposition of a QOOH when the radical site is γ to the OOH group forms an alkene, an aldehyde or ketone, and an OH radical. 4.3.14 Reaction class 26: addition of O2 to QOOH (QOOH + O2 ⇄OOQOOH) The addition of molecular oxygen to hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxide radicals (i.e., QOOH) is the third step in the low-temperature chain branching process. The rate of O2 addition to a QOOH radical depends on whether the radical carbon is an α, primary, secondary, or tertiary site. 4.3.15 Reaction class 27: reaction of O2 with α-hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxy radicals (e.g., CH3CH(OOH)CH2ĊHOH + O2) The importance of molecular oxygen reaction with a α-hydroxyalkyl radical to form an aldehyde/ketone and HO2 was previously discussed (i.e., class 10). This reaction is important in inhibiting the low-temperature reactivity of alcohols. It has been shown experimentally under atmospheric conditions [348,349] and theoretically [350,351] that an analogous reactions occurs for O2 reaction to α-hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxy radicals (e.g., CH3CH(OOH)CH2CH.OH + O2), thus forming a carbonyl hydroperoxide plus HO2. In the n-butanol system, the eventual products of this reaction path are a hydroperoxide butyraldehyde plus HO2 [348,349]. The hydroperoxide butyraldehyde decomposes to give back OH; therefore, this reaction path is a form of low-temperature chain branching which produces one OH and one HO2 radical. 4.3.16 Reaction class 28: isomerization of OOQOOH and formation of carbonyl hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxides and OH including Waddington type reactions mechanism In this reaction class an OOQOOH radical isomerizes, releases an OH, and then forms a carbonyl hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxide species (i.e., analogous to carbonyl alkyl hydroperoxide in alkane oxidation). This is the fourth step in the low-temperature chain branching process. The rate coefficients for these reactions are estimated based on analogous reaction in alkane combustion [319,320]. An important underlying assumption in this methodology is that the hydrogen atom being abstracted is bound to the carbon atom bonded to the hydroperoxide (OOH) group, which has a lower C–H bond strength than a normal C–H bond and makes it easier to abstract. 4.3.17 Reaction class 29: decomposition of carbonyl hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxides to form oxygenated radical species and OH The decomposition of carbonyl hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxides forms an OH radical, a smaller oxygenated radical, and a stable oxygenate (i.e., aldehyde or ketone). This reaction pathway is the final step in the low-temperature chain branching process because it forms two radical species from one stable reactant. 4.3.18 Reaction class 30: epoxy alcohols reactions with OH and HO2 The epoxy alcohols formed via cyclization of a hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxy radical (i.e., reaction class 23) have an oxygen atom embedded within the ring. One can assume these species react via H-atom abstraction by OH and HO2, which are the predominant radicals at low and intermediate temperatures. The subsequent epoxy alcohol radicals then undergo β-scission to form smaller hydrocarbon and carbonyl species."
15,Model testing and analysis,"4.4 Model testing and analysis Following the extensive discussion on reaction classes, testing of the C1–C5 chemical kinetic model against experimental data is necessary. Comparisons of each alcohol oxidation sub-mechanism with experimental data are presented to demonstrate its performance across a range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture fractions of relevance to practical combustion devices. The goal here is not to include comparisons against all available experimental data for a specific alcohol fuel, but instead to follow guidelines for selecting the targets to be presented in this review article, which are as follows: • Premixed laminar flame speed simulations are important for flame propagation in SI engines; these are presented for all the fuels. Comparisons are shown for a range of equivalence ratios and, if data are available, at elevated pressures. • Homogenous ignition delay time simulations are important for SI, CI, and LTC engines; these are presented for all the fuels. Comparisons are presented for data obtained temperatures from 500 to 1500 K, pressures greater than 10 bar, and equivalence ratios ranging from lean to rich (whenever available), as these are the most relevant to internal combustion engines. • Simulating the concentrations of intermediate and product species is important for elucidating reaction pathways of alcohol fuels and simulating (potentially harmful) emissions from alcohol-fueled engines. Thus, comparisons are presented for data obtained in premixed flames, stirred reactors, and/or flow reactors at temperatures from 500 K and above, elevated pressures, and a range of equivalence ratios. • Data obtained in fuel/air (21% O2 and 79% N2) mixtures are favored over data obtained with other diluents (e.g., Ar). Several exceptions exist, such as premixed flame speciation studies where Ar dilution is used as an internal standard for calibration. • Studies under non-premixed (e.g., counterflow flames, coflow flames, etc.) and pyrolysis conditions are relevant to CI and premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) engine combustion and pollutant formation. Experimental studies and model simulations under such conditions are selectively presented to develop a mechanistic understanding of alcohol combustion in fuel-rich environments. • When available, experimental data from newer studies are favored over older data, unless the literature review has deemed the newer data inaccurate. • Comparing the combustion chemistry features across the various alcohols is facilitated by utilizing data obtained from the same experimental facilities under similar conditions. • All the simulations were conducted in CHEMKIN-PRO [282] using the appropriate reactor modules. Premixed laminar flame simulations accounted for thermal diffusion (i.e., Soret effect), assumed mixture-averaged transport, and the solutions were highly resolved with approximately 200 grid points (GRAD 0.1, CURV 0.1). Burner-stabilized premixed flames were simulated using the experimentally measured temperature profile as a boundary condition."
16,The combustion chemistry of methanol,"4.5 The combustion chemistry of methanol Methanol is the simplest alcohol and its oxidation mechanism provides the basis for the oxidation of larger alcohols. In hydrocarbon combustion, the recombination of methyl and hydroxyl radicals forms methanol (e.g., CH3+OH⇄CH3OH), and many intermediate species important to methane combustion (e.g., CH2O, CH3O, CH2OH, and HCO) are also relevant to methanol combustion. Notable comprehensive reaction mechanisms described for methanol are those by Westbrook and Dryer [309], Egolfopoulos et al. [137], Held and Dryer [312], Li et al. [313], Ing et al. [392], and Aranda et al. [153]. Table 5 lists manuscripts describing the direct rate measurement of methanol decomposition and important branching fractions. Srinivasan et al. [355] utilized the reflected shock tube technique with multipass absorption spectrometric detection of OH radicals to measure the rate coefficients of important product channels between 1591 and 2865 K. More recently, Lee et al. [360] and Lu et al. [359] measured methanol thermal decomposition rates behind reflected shock waves by atomic resonance absorption spectrometry of H atoms from 1660 to 2050 K and 1359 to 1644 K, respectively. Pressure-dependent rate coefficients using high-level ab initio calculations and master equation simulations by Jasper et al. [393] are in good agreement with the aforementioned direct experimental measurements. Jasper et al. [393] found that the branching ratio largely favors the (R1) channel (∼80%) with the (R2) channel (∼20%) being the second most important. The important reaction channels and pressure-dependent rate coefficients recommended by Jasper et al. [393] are utilized in the recent methanol mechanisms proposed by Metcalfe et al. [314] and Aranda et al. [153]. (R1) CH3OH ⇄ CH3 + OH (R2) CH3OH ⇄ 1CH2 + H2O (R3) CH3OH ⇄ CH2OH + H Hydrogen abstraction from methanol by H radicals have been studied experimentally prior to 2001, as reviewed in detail by Baulch et al. [352] (Table 5). Recent experimental studies have not been found in the literature, but a detailed high-level direct dynamic variational transition state theory calculation has been performed by Meana-Pañeda, Truhlar, and Fernández-Ramos [394]. The authors present good agreement of their calculated total rate coefficient ((R4) + (R5)) with the available experimental data. Furthermore, their calculations indicate a variation in the branching ratio with temperature, wherein that (R4) contributes to 100% at room temperature and ∼75% at 2500 K. (R4) CH3OH + H ⇄ CH2OH + H2 (R5) CH3OH + H ⇄ CH3O + H2 Hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals is the primary consumption pathway for methanol in lean and stoichiometric environments. Baulch et al. [352] reviewed the large body of experimental rate coefficient measurements prior to 2001. In 2003 and 2005, these reactions were studied at atmospheric conditions (<400 K) by Jiménez et al. [353] and Dillon et al. [354]. Srinivasan et al. [355] recently conducted high-accuracy experiments at high temperatures. The rate coefficients for (R6) + (R7) and its branching ratios were studied theoretically by Xu and Lin [395] using high-level computational theory. Their study noted the importance of characterizing pre-reaction complexes in this class of reactions. Their proposed rate coefficient in the temperature range of 200–3000 K is in good agreement with the available experimental data. Their calculations indicate a branching ratio that is largely independent of temperature; (R6) contributes to 96–89% of the total rate coefficient across the entire temperature range, which is in agreement with the recent combustion experiments of Rasmussen et al. [147] (R6) CH3OH + OH ⇄ CH2OH + H2O (R7) CH3OH + OH ⇄ CH3O + H2O Hydrogen abstraction from methanol by HO2 has never been measured experimentally. Metcalfe et al. [314] utilized brute-force sensitivity analysis to show that high pressure (30 bar) shock tube ignition delay times are sensitive to the rate coefficient for (R8). In studies of RCM, Kumar and Sung [151] and Aranda et al. [153] also highlighted the importance of this reaction's rate coefficient for accurately simulating RCM ignition delay measurements. The recent theoretical investigations include those by Altarawneh et al. [335], Klippenstein et al. [396], and Alecu and Truhlar [397,398]. Metcalfe et al. [314] compared the rate coefficients determined in various studies, including estimations based on analogies and/or comparison with experimental combustion data and theoretically calculated values. From 900 to 1000 K, the theoretically calculated values from Klippenstein et al. [396] and Alecu and Truhlar [397,398] deviated by a factor of ∼3.5–4. Aranda et al. [153] explained that the discrepancy between the high-level calculations is attributed to the different treatment of anharmoncity. As will be shown later, a definitive direct experimental measurement is needed to provide further guidance in reaction mechanism development. (R8) CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2 (R9) CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH3O + H2O2 The hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) and methoxy (CH3O) produced by hydrogen abstraction from methanol are primarily consumed via thermal decomposition (i.e., β-scission reactions), leading to the products of both reactions being formaldehyde and H radicals. The hydroxymethyl radical can also react with molecular oxygen to produce formaldehyde and H radicals. The methoxy radical is primarily consumed via thermal decomposition (R10). Rasmussen et al. [147] reviewed rate coefficients for (R10), and the preferred rate coefficient is based on the work of Hippler et al. [399]. Baulch et al. [352] reviewed the various rate coefficients proposed for R11, including those by Bowman [123], Tsuboi and Hashimoto [128], Cribb et al. [135,136], Greenhill and Ogrady [362], and Held and Dryer [312]. Baulch et al. [352] noted large discrepancies in the aforementioned rate coefficient recommendations. No detailed study of the pressure dependence of this reaction has been made, even though Greenhill and Ogrady [362] showed that fall-off effects are important. Baulch et al. [352] recommended using the rate coefficient for (R10) proposed by Held and Dryer [312], and this is the one most commonly used in recent methanol combustion models [147,314]. Baulch et al. [352] also reviewed the proposed rate coefficients for oxidation of hydroxymethyl by O2 (R12), and they noted an excellent agreement across experimental studies at low temperatures. The high temperature rate coefficient extrapolation from the work of Grotheer et al. [400] (at 298–684 K) shows good agreement with flame studies by Vandooren and van Tiggelen [127]. Baulch et al. [352] recommended a rate coefficient for this reaction by fitting the mean of the low-temperature data with the high-temperature measurements, resulting in a rate coefficient valid in the range 298–1200 K. (R10) CH3O ⇄ CH2O + H (R11) CH2OH ⇄ CH2O + H (R12) CH2OH + O2 ⇄ CH2O + HO2 The methanol mechanism utilized in this study is that developed recently by Metcalfe et al. [314], namely AramcoMech 1.3. This mechanism is chosen due to its comprehensive development and testing for methanol, as well as for hydrogen [323], hydrogen/CO mixtures [323], methane, and formaldehyde, which are all relevant to methanol combustion. In their paper [314], the authors present methanol model comparisons against shock tube ignition delay data from Bowman [123] (>1500 K, 1–11 bar, ϕ = 0.75–6.0) and from Fieweger et al. [142] (750–1250 K, 13–40 bar), flow reactor speciation data from Norton and Dryer [132,133] and Held and Dryer [140], and premixed laminar flame speed data from Veloo et al. [110] and Vancoillie et al. [152] (1 bar, ϕ = 0.7–1.5). Atmospheric pressure methanol/air premixed laminar flame speeds were recently measured by Veloo et al. [110] and Vancoillie et al. [152] near 343 K. The former utilized the counterflow twin premixed flame technique, whereas the latter employed the heat flux burner method. Egolfopoulos et al. [137] also utilized the counterflow twin flame technique to measure methanol/air flame speeds near 340 K, although they used a linear extrapolation to account for flame stretch, whereas Veloo et al. [110] utilized a more accurate non-linear extrapolation to zero stretch. Fig. 19 presents the experimental data obtained in the aforementioned studies. The recent data sets from Veloo et al. [110] and Vancoillie et al. [152] agree well for lean and stoichiometric mixtures, but rich mixtures are notably faster in the latter data set. The model from Metcalfe et al. agrees with both data sets under lean conditions and particularly concurs with the data of Vancoillie et al. [152] on the rich side, albeit there is only a single measurement at this condition. Additional experiments for methanol/air mixtures under rich conditions are needed to better validate the chemical kinetic mechanisms. The homogenous ignition delay of methanol has been well studied under Ar dilution at high temperatures above 1200 K (refer to Table 3). Kumar and Sung conducted RCM measurements at elevated pressures and intermediate temperatures of greater relevance to internal combustion engines (7–30 bar, 850–1100 K, ϕ = 0.25–2.0), again under Ar dilution (O2/Ar : 1/3.76). Their RCM data [151] in Fig. 20 displays methanol's Arrhenius-type monotonic decrease in the ignition delay time with increasing temperature. Simulations are also presented using the chemical kinetic model of Metcalfe et al. [314] (dashed gray line) and employing a volume-varying history to account for heat losses after the end of compression [104,106,401,402]. The model is able to simulate the qualitative Arrhenius behavior that is observed experimentally, but the simulated ignition delay times are quantitatively lower than those measured experimentally. Rate coefficients responsible for the discrepancy are discussed later. Fieweger et al. [142] measured shock tube ignition delay times for methanol/air and conditions comparable to SI engine conditions (i.e., 750–1250 K, 13–40 bar, ϕ = 1.0). Fig. 20 presents their experimental results along with simulations using the chemical kinetic model of Metcalfe et al. [314]. Methanol/air mixtures display long ignition delay times at high pressures and intermediate temperatures (i.e., 10–100 ms), which agrees with its high RON value (i.e., 112). Constant volume simulations (Fig. 20 thin dashed blue line) are presented at 40 bar, and the model displays the linear trend of decreasing ignition delay time with decreasing temperature. The data suggest significantly shorter ignition delay times at lower temperatures, but Fieweger et al. [142] attributed this discrepancy to the existence of a pronounced deflagration phase that causes the post-compression pressure to double prior to the main ignition event. The result is up to an order of magnitude decrease in ignition delay times for experiments affected by deflagration (e.g., open symbols in Fig. 20). Increasing pressure during the ignition delay time period is not ideal, and such phenomena can be modeled using volume-varying simulations, as explained by Chaos and Dryer [102] or pressure-varying simulations as explained by Zhu et al. [240]. When the former methodology (denoted as “vol hist sim” in Fig. 20) is implemented using a 10%/ms pressure rise rate (Fig. 20, thick dashed blue line and solid red line), the model simulations are in much better agreement with the experimental data. The oxidation of methanol in stirred and flow reactors has been studied to measure the global reactivity and to identify intermediate and product species distributions. A list of published studies is presented in Table 3, with the most notable ones being those at elevated pressures by Held and Dryer [312], Dayma et al. [146], and Aranda et al. [153]. Metcalfe et al. [314] presented comprehensive comparisons of their methanol model against the data of Held and Dryer [312]. Here the model is compared with JSR data at 10 bar [146] because the same facility and experimental methodology has also been used to study many other alcohol fuels. The data in Fig. 21 indicate that methanol is unreactive below 800 K and no intermediate or product species are measured. Above 800 K, methanol reacts to produce formaldehyde (CH2O), which has a peak concentration near 825 K, and is then oxidized to form CO and subsequently CO2. The model of Metcalfe et al. [314] qualitatively agrees with the consumption of methanol, the production and consumption of formaldehyde, and the generation of major product species (CO, CO2, and H2O). However, the simulated reactivity is shifted to lower temperatures (∼50 K) than measured experimentally. As will be discussed later, this is attributed to the selected rate coefficient for CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2. The general reaction scheme for methanol combustion in premixed flames, batch reactors, and stirred and flow reactors is presented in Fig. 22 . Methanol consumption is initiated by hydrogen abstraction by OH, HO2, and H radicals. As mentioned earlier, the branching ratio of hydrogen abstraction by OH strongly favors the formation of CH2OH with CH3O being a minor channel. Both these radical intermediates share their fate in the formation of formaldehyde, and once formed this species controls the reactivity of the system. Hydrogen abstraction from formaldehyde yields the HCO radical (formyl), eventually leading to the formation of CO and CO2 via the sequence CH2O → HCO → CO → CO2. Both Veloo et al. [110] and Metcalfe et al. [314] have shown that the laminar flame speed of methanol displays a strong positive sensitivity to the ubiquitous radical chain branching H + O2 ⇄ O + OH and the reaction HCO(+M) ⇄ H + CO(+M). The latter reaction produces the H radicals needed to drive the former reaction. The reaction of HCO + O2 ⇄ CO + HO2 has been shown to inhibit laminar flame speeds because it competes directly with the HCO decomposition channel and traps H-atoms in the hydroperoxyl radical. Fig. 23 from Kumar and Sung [151] presents a sensitivity analysis on ignition delay times measured in the RCM at 30 bar, 905 K, and under stoichiometric conditions, which is one of the points plotted in Fig. 20. The ignition delay is strongly promoted by the reactions CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2 and H2O2(+M) ⇄ OH + OH(+M). The former reaction produces the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that decomposes to form reactive OH radicals in the latter reaction. The importance of the reaction CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2 under combustion-relevant conditions is further highlighted in Figs. 20 and 21. Adopting the recent theoretically calculated rate coefficients from Alecu and Truhlar [397,398] slows down ignition delay times under RCM conditions and simulations are in better agreement with the experimental data. Their slower rate coefficient also slows the reactivity of methanol in the JSR bringing it into better agreement with the experimental profile and also improving formaldehyde agreement. However, the proposed rate coefficient also slows ST ignition delay times, resulting in an under agreement of the data from Fieweger et al. [142], which is consistent with the findings of Metcalfe et al. [314] when using the aforementioned rate coefficient to simulate ST data from Noorani et al. [150]. The various combustion modeling studies [147,153,313,314] and theoretical calculations [335,396,398] have not yet converged upon a agreeable rate coefficient for CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2, and thus a direct experimental measurement is greatly needed."
17,The combustion chemistry of ethanol,"4.6 The combustion chemistry of ethanol Ethanol is the most widely used alcohol fuel in transportation applications. Its oxidation mechanism is also an important sub-component of ethane and propane combustion models. Detailed chemical kinetic models for ethanol have been presented and tested against experimental data. Notable models include the first by Natarajan and Bhaskaran in 1981 [126]; the models by Egolfopoulos et al. [159] and Marinov [310] in the 1990s that were compared against data from shock tube ignition delay, laminar flame speeds, and chemical species concentration measurements in a jet-stirred reactor; and the comprehensively developed model by Frassoldati et al. [403] for ethanol and ethanol–gasoline mixtures. Other recent ethanol oxidation models that are widely tested (i.e., shock tube, jet-stirred reactor, flow reactor, flame speed, and flame speciation) include AramcoMech presented by Metcalfe et al. [314] and Mittal et al. [187] and the ethanol model by Leplat et al. [177]. A number of other models have also been presented for ethanol oxidation, but they tend to present comparisons against a limited set of experimental data [110,160,169,173,176,179,181,184,404]. The unimolecular thermal decomposition of ethanol proceeds primarily via a dehydration reaction (R13), C–C bond scission (R14), or C–O bond scission (R15). Baulch et al. [352] reviewed the limited number of related experimental studies (e.g., the direct measurement of (R13) by Herzler et al. [405]), but noted that none provided detailed temperature and pressure-dependent rate coefficients. More recently, Li et al. [370] measured the rate coefficient of (R13) by monitoring ethanol decay and ethylene production in a pyrolysis flow reactor with online FTIR sampling. Their experimentally determined rate coefficient agreed with that of Herzler et al. [405]. Tsang [406] conducted a master-equation analysis, concluding that R13 is the main reaction with C–C and C–O bond scissions being secondary processes, and assigned a rate in creditable agreement with the aforementioned experimental measurements [370,405]. Park et al. [407] employed ab initio molecular orbital theory and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) calculations to determine pressure and temperature-dependent rate coefficients and branching ratios, but their calculated rate for (R13) was 3.2 times higher than that of Tsang [406]. Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] recently conducted a definitive experimental and theoretical analysis using a high-temperature shock tube with ab initio variable reaction coordinate transition state theory-based master equation calculations. The rate coefficient of (R15) was measured directly using OH optical absorption, the total rate coefficient and that of (R13) + (R14) was measured by H-atom ARAS detection, and the difference gave the rate coefficient of (R13). They highlighted the sources of disagreement with previous theoretical calculations, noting that Park et al. [407] did not correctly account for the barrierless potential of (R13), while Li et al. [370] artificially lowered their transition state frequencies to match experimental data. In addition, the variations in pressure fall-off treatment from the use of different energy transfer models led to discrepancies in theoretical rate coefficient calculations. The branching ratios from Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] favor the dehydration reaction (R13) below 1400 K (ranging from 90 to 70% from 500 to 1400K), while C–C bond scission (R14) becomes increasingly important at high temperature (∼45% at 2000 K). The C–O bond scission (R15) in ethanol is negligible because its bond strength is significantly higher than that of a C–C bond. A recent shock tube study by Wu et al. [371] on ethanol decomposition using H-atom ARAS detection are in good agreement with previous works; however, the pressure dependence of the branching fraction is smaller than previous theoretical calculations suggest. (R13) C2H5OH ⇄ C2H4 + H2O (R14) C2H5OH ⇄ CH3 + CH2OH (R15) C2H5OH ⇄ C2H5 + OH H-atom abstraction reactions from ethanol proceed from the α, β, or hydroxyl sites. The total rate coefficient for H-atom abstraction by H radicals ((R16) + (R17) + (R18)) was first studied by Aders and Wagner in 1973 [408] in the temperature range of 295–700 K. The only other direct experimental measurement was recently performed by Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] at temperatures of 1054–1359 K, wherein the total rate coefficient was measured and individual rate coefficients were calculated from theory. The theoretically calculated rate coefficients from Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] and Park et al. [409] are in excellent agreement with the aforementioned direct measurements. The branching ratios are also in agreement, with (R17) being the dominant channel (∼99% at 500 K and ∼64% at 2000 K), (R18) contributing a maximum of 38% at 2500 K, and (R16) being negligible (7% at 2500 K) [366]. (R16) C2H5OH + H ⇄ C2H5O + H2 (R17) C2H5OH + H ⇄ CH3CHOH + H2 (R18) C2H5OH + H ⇄ CH2CH2OH + H2 OH radicals are the most important abstractors of hydrogen atoms from ethanol. Table 5 lists experimental measurements for the total rate coefficient ((R19)-(R21)) across a range of temperatures. Early works in the 1980s [361,362,376] studied this reaction at low temperatures of relevance to atmospheric chemistry, except for the study of Hess and Tully, who conducted measurements up to 750 K [364]. Bott and Cohen later performed higher temperature measurements (1200 K) [365] using a shock tube with laser absorption spectroscopy. In the past decade, the rate coefficient was again measured by Jiménez et al. [353] and Dillon et al. [354] in atmospheric temperature ranges and by Carr et al. [367] and Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] at combustion-relevant temperatures. The consensus among experimental studies is that the total rate coefficient is well established from 200 to 2500 K, but the proposed branching ratios vary greatly between studies. One challenge is that the individual rate coefficient of (R21) cannot be measured by monitoring OH radical concentrations because the β CH2CH2OH radical quickly decomposes to C2H4 plus OH above 600 K. Carr et al. [367] utilized isotopic labeling to measure individual rate coefficients of (R21) and (R22) below 550 K, but these temperatures were not directly relevant to combustion. Thus, theoretical calculations and/or estimations are necessary to better determine the individual rate coefficients. Such theoretical calculations have been performed by Xu and Lin [395], Zheng and Truhlar [410], and Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366]. In general, all these studies present total rate coefficients that can reproduce the aforementioned experimentally measured data. However, Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] had to adjust their theoretical calculations to obtain good agreement with data, whereas Zheng and Truhlar [410] noted that their lower level potential energy surface calculations (MS-VTST with M08-SO/6-31 + G(d,p)) agreed with experimental data better than did their state-of-the-art multi-path variational transition state theory calculations (MP-VTST with M08-HX/6-31 + G(d,p)). Table 6 presents branching ratios determined in several recent studies. The theoretical calculations of Xu and Lin [395], Zheng and Truhlar [410] (MP-VTST calculations), and Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366] (adjusted theoretical calculations), and the estimate from Tran et al. [184] (Evans–Polanyi correlation with ethane) all suggest that abstraction from the α site (R20) is dominant followed by the β channel (R21). The rate coefficients proposed by Carr et al. [367] suggest that (R19) is the dominant channel, which is unexpected given the high BDE of the O–H bond, and in disagreement with the other studies. The branching ratio of (R20) varies by about 20% between Zheng and Truhlar [410] and Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366], wherein the former places more importance on (R19) and (R21). Zheng and Truhlar [410] have identified inaccuracies in previous studies [366,395], such as unexpectedly high saddle point energies for transition states with hydrogen bonded structures in (R21), which explains why Sivaramakrishnan et al.’s [366] branching ratio for (R21) is lower than others. The MP-VTST calculations by Zheng and Truhlar [410] are the state-of-the-art in computational chemistry. It seems reasonable that their branching ratios would therefore be the most accurate given the high-level of theory employed. However, we recall that their total rate coefficient could not accurately reproduce experimental data. They [410] concluded that advances in computational chemistry are needed to make rate calculations more predictive, especially for reactions with stabilized pre-reaction complexes and hydrogen bonding in the transition states. (R19) C2H5OH + OH ⇄ C2H5O + H2O (R20) C2H5OH + OH ⇄ CH3CHOH + H2O (R21) C2H5OH + OH ⇄ CH2CH2OH + H2O Hydrogen abstraction from ethanol by HO2 has not yet been measured experimentally or calculated using theoretical chemistry. As shown previously for methanol and later for ethanol, ignition delay times of ethanol/air mixtures are sensitive to the total reaction rate and its branching ratios. One would expect the abstraction to favor the α site given its low BDE and the abstraction from the hydroxyl moiety to be negligible. Recent chemical kinetic models vary widely in their choice of rate coefficients for (R22), (R23), and (R24). Several proposed rate coefficients for (R23) (α) and (R24) (β) are shown in Fig. 24 . All studies suggest that abstraction from the α site is dominant at all temperatures, but the temperature dependence varies across studies. Estimates of (R24) by Marinov [310]and Tran et al. [184] agree with each other at 1000 K, whereas that of Mittal et al. [187]is nearly a factor of 3 higher. Leplat et al. [177] and Lee et al. [181] used the proposed rate coefficient from Marinov [310]. He assumed that (R23) had a rate coefficient similar to methanol's (R8) (CH3OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2OH + H2O2) and that the rate coefficient of (R24) was based on the derived rate expression of (R23). Marinov [310] assigned large error bars to his proposed rate coefficients and stated that they were highly uncertain. Recently, Tran et al. [184] proposed rate coefficients for (R23) and (R24) using Evan–Polanyi correlations proposed by Dean and Bozzelli [411] with ethane as a reference. This methodology accounts for variations in BDEs between ethanol and ethane, but not for secondary effects such as hydrogen bonds formed in transition states. A recent theoretical study by Zhou et al. [326] on hydrogen abstraction from n-butanol by hydroperoxyl radicals showed that hydrogen bonds in the transition state lead to ring structures. These were found to be important for the β and γ sites of n-butanol, resulting in lower energy barriers and higher entropy loss (i.e., lower activation energies and lower A-factors). Sarathy et al. [260] found that the rate coefficients determined by Zhou et al. [326] for n-butanol were suitable for combustion modeling; however, an increase in the α channel rate by a factor of 2.5 (within the uncertainty specified by Zhou et al. [326]) was needed to obtain better agreement with the results of intermediate temperature shock tube ignition delay experiments. Metcalfe et al. [314] and Mittal et al. [187] expected that such hydrogen bonding effects would also be important in ethanol. Mittal et al. [187] assigned (R23) a rate coefficient 1.75 times greater than the α channel rate recommended by Zhou et al. [326] for n-butanol. Their rate coefficient for abstraction from the hydroxyl moiety (i.e., (R22)) was that calculated by Zhou et al. [326] for the analogous reaction in n-butanol. Abstraction from the β carbon was estimated as the average of Zhou et al.’s [326] calculated rate coefficients from the δ and β channels in n-butanol. (R22) C2H5OH + HO2 ⇄ C2H5O + H2O2 (R23) C2H5OH + HO2 ⇄ CH3CHOH + H2O2 (R24) C2H5OH + HO2 ⇄ CH2CH2OH + H2O2 At high temperatures, the ethoxy (C2H5O), α-hydroxyethyl (CH3CHOH), and β-hydroxyethyl (CH2CH2OH) radicals produced by hydrogen abstraction from ethanol are consumed via thermal decomposition (i.e., β-scission reactions) and unimolecular isomerization reactions. Xu et al. [412] recently conducted a theoretical study on the decomposition and isomerization of C2H5O radicals. Senosiain et al. [413] also performed high-level quantum chemistry calculations for all the low-energy pathways of the reaction of ethylene with OH radicals. These included all C2H5O isomers following OH addition to the double bond in ethylene and subsequent isomerization reactions. Both studies noted that very few direct measurements have been made at combustion-relevant temperatures. The ethoxy radical (C2H5O) undergoes decomposition either by C–C bond scission (R25) to formaldehyde and methyl radical or C–H bond scission (R26) to acetaldehyde and H radical, with isomerization reactions being negligible. At 1 bar and 1000 K, the branching ratio of R25:R26 is approximately 73:27 [412]. The α-hydroxyethyl (CH3CHOH) also favors thermal decomposition at combustion-relevant conditions. The O–H bond scission forming acetaldehyde (R27) is in competition with the C–H bond scission leading to ethenol (R28) [413]. Both channels are thus important, but the path leading to acetaldehyde is favored according to calculations by Dames [414]. C–C bond scission to ethylene and OH radical (R30) accounts for about 90% of the destruction of β-hydroxyethyl (CH2CH2OH), with 10% going to form ethenol (R31) [412]. (R25) C2H5O ⇄ CH2O + CH3 (R26) C2H5O ⇄ CH3CHO + H (R27) CH3CHOH ⇄ CH3CHO + H (R28) CH3CHOH ⇄ C2H3OH + H (R29) CH2CH2OH ⇄ C2H4 + OH (R30) CH2CH2OH ⇄ C2H3OH + H At lower temperatures (below 1000 K) the reactions between α- and β-hydroxyethyl and O2 are important because the aforementioned decomposition channels are slow. Rate coefficients for these reactions were studied experimentally at low pressures (<10 mbar) by Miyoshi et al. [415] at room temperature using the laser flash photolysis-photoionization mass spectrometry method, and by Grotheer et al. [416] in the temperature range of 300–682 K using a discharge flow reactor with a low electron energy mass spectrometer. Zádor et al. [339] recently conducted a theoretical analysis and experimental product study of the reaction of hydroxyethyl radicals with O2. Their experiments studied the primary products of the reaction (not rate coefficient measurements) initiated by an excimer laser in a heated flow reactor coupled with tunable synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry. Pressure-dependent rate coefficients and branching ratios were computed (and not measured) in the temperature range of 255–1000 K using high-level ab initio potential energy surface calculations and state-of-the-art master equation methods. Around the same time as Zádor et al. conducted their work, the reactions of α-hydroxyethyl with O2 were also studied theoretically by da Silva et al. [340]. The potential energy surfaces of these reactions are complex, as shown in Fig. 25 from Zádor et al. [339], but theoretical studies help to identify the dominant pathways. Both theoretical studies are in excellent agreement regarding the CH3CHOH + O2 reaction, concluding that it proceeds through an activated α-hydroxy-ethylperoxy adduct that rapidly decomposes to acetaldehyde + HO2 (R31). The predominance of (R31) was confirmed experimentally by Zádor et al. [339]. Furthermore, the decomposition reaction occurs with such a low barrier that conventional low-temperature chain branching pathways are unimportant. The potential energy surface (PES) for the β-hydroxyethyl + O2 reactions (Fig. 25) is also complicated, but Zádor et al.’s [339] theoretical and experimental results indicate two pathways as dominant. First, as previously discussed, the Waddington pathway is shown to be important, wherein a β-RO2 radical is stabilized and then quickly decomposes to two formaldehyde and one OH radical (R32). The second important reaction is a concerted elimination reaction leading to the formation of ethenol and HO2 radicals (R33). The branching ratio between (R32) and (R33) is still uncertain due to the multi-reference character of the transition states (R31) CH3CHOH + O2 ⇄ CH3CHO + HO2 (R32) CH2CH2OH + O2 ⇄ OOCH2CH2OH ⇄ 2 CH2O + OH (R33) CH3CHOH + O2 ⇄ C2H3OH + HO2 The present analysis utilizes the ethanol mechanism by originally presented by Metcalfe et al. [314] and recently modified by Mittal et al. [187]. This mechanism is chosen due to its comprehensive development and testing for ethanol combustion. In their papers [187,314], the authors present ethanol model comparisons against RCM ignition delay data, (825–985 K, 10–50 bar, and ϕ = 0.3–1.0) shock tube ignition delay data by Heufer and Olivier [174] (down to 800 K, 13–40 bar, ϕ = 1.0); JSR speciation data from LePlat et al. [177] (890–1250 K, 1 bar, ϕ = 0.25–2) and Dagaut and Togbé [169] (770–1220 K, at 10 bar, ϕ = 0.6–2); flow reactor speciation data from Li et al. [161] (1045–1080 K, 1.7–3.0 bar) and Norton and Dryer [133] (1020–1120 K initial, 1 bar, ϕ = 1.18); premixed laminar flame speeds from Egolfopoulos et al. [159] (1 bar, ϕ = 0.6–1.8), van Lipzig et al. [178] (1 bar, ϕ = 0.6–1.5), and Gülder [129] (1–8 bar, ϕ = 0.7–1.4); and premixed laminar flame speciation data from Leplat et al. [177] (500–1800 K, 50 mbar, ϕ = 0.75–1.25). The laminar flame speeds of ethanol/air mixtures have been measured in a number of studies, as noted in Table 3, and there is reasonably good agreement across the various measurements obtained at atmospheric pressure and a range of unburned gas temperatures. Metcalfe et al. [314] and Mittal et al. [187] have shown that their ethanol model can accurately reproduce laminar flame speeds data at 298 K [129,159,178], 338 K [178], 363 K [159,178], 428 K [159], and 453 K [159]. Not presented in their paper is the performance of the model at elevated pressures. Fig. 26 presents the experimental data from Bradley et al. [172], which covers pressures from 1 bar up to 14 bar and a range of equivalence ratios. Their maximum equivalence ratio achievable at higher pressures was constrained by the safe operating pressure limit of their combustion vessel. The data indicates a decrease in flame speed as pressure increases, a qualitative trend that is accurately reproduced by the model. The quantitative agreement between the simulations and measurements are in need of improvement. At 1 bar, the present model simulates higher flame speeds than the measured data, which is a discrepancy not observed when comparing with data from other facilities [159,314]. At 2 bar, the model simulates higher flame speeds than the data by up to 10 cm/s, whereas at higher pressures the model simulations are generally within 5 cm/s of the experimental data. The sensitive reactions controlling the model simulations are small molecular reactions [314] and not specific to ethanol chemistry. It should be noted that the ethanol model proposed by Leplat et al. [177] provides much better quantitative agreement with the data from Ref. [172] at all pressures. The homogenous ignition delay of ethanol/air has been studied at a range of pressures and temperatures of relevance to internal combustion engines using both shock tubes and RCMs. A recent shock tube ignition study by Lee et al. [181] utilized schlieren imaging to show that pre-ignition reactions cause significant pressure rises prior to the main ignition event, and these pressure rises must be well characterized for comparison against chemical kinetic modeling simulations. Fig. 27 presents experimentally measured ethanol/air ignition delay times at a range of pressures using shock tubes [173,181] and RCMs [181] along with chemical kinetic modeling simulations that account for shock tube pressure rises prior to ignition. The RCM measurements at 30 bar exhibit Arrhenius behavior below 1000 K, which is extended to higher temperatures in the shock tube measurements. The discrepancy between measured ignition delay times in the temperature region covering both RCM and shock tube experiments is attributed to the aforementioned pre-ignition pressure rise phenomenon in shock tubes. The model is able to well reproduce both RCM and shock tube when facility effects are included, along with the experimentally observed decreasing ignition delay times with increasing pressure. The lack of NTC behavior in ethanol is consistent with its high research octane number. The combustion chemistry contributing to these features is discussed later. Speciation measurements during oxidation of ethanol have been studied extensively in flow reactors, stirred reactors, non-premixed flames, and premixed flames using a variety of diagnostic techniques (refer to Table 3). Here, the ethanol kinetic model is compared with JSR data at 10 bar from Dagaut and Togbé [169] and low-pressure premixed flame speciation measurements using MBMS by Leplat et al. [177]. Only selected species profiles are presented in Fig. 28 to highlight some important features of ethanol oxidation and the model's performance. The low-pressure premixed flames are burner stabilized, allowing the experimentally measured temperature profile to be used as a boundary condition for the simulation. In both the JSR and low-pressure flame, ethanol is oxidized to form acetaldehyde and ethylene, which are primary β-scission products. The model accurately reproduces the qualitative formation of these intermediates in the JSR and their consumption, but ethanol reacts at lower temperatures to form acetaldehyde in the model than in the experiments. Ethylene concentrations are correctly simulated in both the JSR and with the low-pressure premixed flame. Later, we highlight some of the important reactions controlling these products, namely hydrogen abstractions by OH and HO2 radicals. Ethenol (C2H3OH) is an interesting species that was not measured in the JSR or ethanol low-pressure flames due to experimental limitations; however, Xu et al. [179] recently acquired speciation measurements using molecular beam flame-sampling photoionization mass spectrometry. Ketene (CH2CO) has also been measured in low-pressure flames [177,179]. Simulations of ethenol and ketene under the low-pressure premixed flame conditions of Xu et al. [179] were not possible because their experimentally measured temperature profiles are not in agreement with those used for their simulations, and no discussion of this discrepancy is offered in their paper. Therefore, simulations of ethenol and ketene are presented under the flame conditions of Leplat et al. and presented in Fig. 28. The chemistry contributing to the formation of these intermediates is discussed later. The general reaction scheme for ethanol combustion in premixed flames, batch reactors, and stirred and flow reactors is presented in Fig. 29 . Ethanol consumption is initiated by hydrogen abstraction by radicals (denoted as R), such as OH, HO2, and H. As mentioned earlier, the branching ratio of hydrogen abstraction by OH favors the formation of CH3CH2OH with CH3O and CH2CH2OH being less important channels. At high temperatures, these radicals undergo β-scission wherein C–C and C–O bonds are favored, leading to the formation of stable intermediates, including ethylene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Highlighted in the figure is also the β-scission of a C–H bond in CH3CHOH leading to the formation of ethenol, a pathway responsible for producing this compound in premixed ethanol/O2 flames (Fig. 28). The acetaldehyde intermediate is primarily consumed via hydrogen abstraction from the aldehydic carbon; the subsequent radical then decomposes to form carbon monoxide. A minor pathway of acetaldehyde consumption proceeds via abstraction from the methyl group leading to ketene production. This is the primary route to ketene and explains why its maximum concentration in flames (Fig. 28) occurs after the acetaldehyde maximum. As shown earlier, ethylene concentrations are correctly simulated in the JSR and in premixed flames (Fig. 28). This agreement is due to the branching ratio of hydrogen abstraction by OH. The model by Metcalfe et al. [314] utilizes rate coefficients from Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366], which strongly favors the formation of α-hydroxyethyl (CH3CH2OH) (Table 6), while Mittal et al. [187] reduced the branching ratio to α-hydroxyethyl by 25% and increased the branching to β-hydroxyethyl radical by 25%. Calculations by Zheng and Truhlar [314,410] give lower weighting to the formation of β-hydroxyethyl (CH2CH2OH). Fig. 28 presents simulations using the C2H5OH + OH rate coefficients proposed by Tran et al. [184] that have total rate coefficients in agreement with experimental results and branching ratios similar to Zheng and Truhlar [410]. The decreased branching ratio assigned to the β-site decreases ethylene production and increases acetaldehyde formation. Simulations were also conducted to determine the importance of ethenol under the JSR and flame conditions in Fig. 28. Ethenol was simulated in very low concentrations in the JSR, but simulated low-pressure flame concentrations were found to be above 1000 ppm. A reaction path analysis showed that under the 10 bar JSR conditions, the decomposition of CH2CH2OH is primarily to C2H4 + OH, whereas in the low-pressure flame, the pathway to C2H3OH + H equally as important. Thus, the pressure dependence of these reactions alters the branching ratio of CH2CH2OH decomposition, which is a phenomenon that has not been studied in great detail to date. At low temperatures (i.e., below 1000 K), the α- and β-hydroxyethyl radicals can react with O2 to form products. As mentioned previously, the primary product from the α-hydroxyethyl channel is acetaldehyde + HO2. These reactions control the low-temperature ignition behavior of ethanol/O2 mixtures, especially at elevated pressures. The low energy barrier for the chemically activated α-hydroxyethyl + O2 channel precludes conventional peroxy stabilization and isomerization channels that eventually lead to chain branching processes in alkanes (e.g., ethane, propane, etc.) [340]. The β-hydroxyethyl + O2 channel proceeds through stabilization of a β-peroxy (β-RO2) radical that either undergoes a concerted elimination to form ethenol + HO2 or a Waddington isomerization and decomposition channel to form two formaldehydes + an OH radical. The β-channels are of minor importance in combustion systems because initial hydrogen abstractions by OH radicals strongly favor the α site at lower temperatures. The absence of an OH radical chain branching route in ethanol explains its lack of low-temperature reactivity, and this phenomenon will be shown to be important in larger alcohols as well. Fig. 30 from Ref. [187] presents a ‘brute force’ sensitivity analysis on shock tube ethanol/air ignition delay times at 30 bar, 1050 K, and stoichiometric conditions. These results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis conducted in other studies in shock tubes, RCMs, and JSRs [177,181,279]. The ‘brute force” sensitivity analysis quantifies the change in ignition delay time from a doubling and halving of each reaction rate coefficient. Similar to those previously shown for methanol/air mixtures, the ignition delay is strongly promoted by the hydrogen abstraction by HO2 radicals and H2O2 decomposition. The importance of the reactions involving C2H5OH + HO2 under combustion-relevant conditions is further highlighted in Figs. 27 and 28, wherein the rates for abstraction from the hydroxyl, α, and β sites are replaced by those proposed by Tran et al. [184]. Recall from Fig. 24 that the total rate coefficient employed by Mittal et al. [187] is approximately a factor of 2 higher than that proposed by Tran et al. [184]. Utilizing the latter rate coefficient slows the reactivity of ethanol in the JSR and improves agreement with the experimental data. However, the slower rate coefficient worsens the agreement of ignition delay times at 10 bar (Fig. 27) and higher pressures. Thus, direct experimental measurements and/or high-level theoretical calculations are needed to constrain this rate coefficient."
18,The combustion chemistry of propanol isomers,"4.7 The combustion chemistry of propanol isomers The two isomers of C3 alcohols are n- and iso-propanol. These fuels have received little attention from the combustion chemistry community with few experimental and kinetic modeling studies available in the literature (refer to Table 3). This lack of combustion data together with a scarcity of fundamental mechanistic and kinetic rate coefficient studies (refer to Table 5) has hindered progress in the development of comprehensive chemical kinetic models for the propanol isomers. Frassoldati et al. [195] and Man et al. [200] have presented kinetic models for the propanol isomers using primarily analogies with ethanol and the butanol isomers to assign rate coefficients. For the present analysis, we use the sub-mechanism recently proposed by Man et al. [200], which is essentially an updated version the propanol isomers kinetic model presented by Johnson et al. [193]. We also added several important low temperature reaction pathways based the reaction classes explained previously and rate rules derived from the modeling of butanol isomers [260]. Comparing the bond dissociation energies for n- and iso-propanol with those of other alcohols allow the estimation of rate coefficients for unimolecular decomposition reactions. The water elimination channels are important routes of fuel consumption at high temperatures, and the rate coefficients for these reactions are estimated based on analogies to n-butanol and 2-butanol [200,260]. Similarly, other C–C bond scissions in the propanol isomers can be assigned rates based on analogous reactions for the butanol isomers. The rate coefficients of H-atom abstraction reactions from the propanol isomers are not well studied. Abstractions from n-propanol proceed from the hydroxyl site (R34), α (secondary, (R35)), β (secondary, (R36)), or γ (primary, (R37)). Abstractions from iso-propanol proceed from the hydroxyl site (R38), α (tertiary, (R39)), or two β sites (primary, (R40)). As shown in Table 5, there is only one rate coefficient measurement of abstraction by OH radical at combustion relevant temperatures, performed by Dunlop and Tully [372]. Theoretical reaction rate studies for hydrogen abstraction from the propanol isomers are lacking. Thus, the site-specific rate coefficients for abstraction reactions by important radicals (e.g., H, OH, and HO2) must be derived using analogy with reaction rate coefficients established for n-butanol and 2-butanol [200,260]. This approach is tested for the case of iso-propanol + OH in Fig. 31 , wherein experimental measurements of the total rate coefficients from Dunlop and Tully [372] are compared with estimates based on analogy with 2-butanol [200,260]. The method of estimation using Evans–Polyani correlations [411] is within 25% of the experimentally measured values, which indicates the appropriateness of such techniques for estimating rate coefficients. (R34) nC3H7OH + R ⇄ C3H7O + RH (R35) nC3H7OH + R ⇄ CH3CH2CHOH + RH (R36) nC3H7OH + R ⇄ CH3CHCH2OH + RH (R37) nC3H7OH + R ⇄ CH2CH2CH2OH + RH (R38) iC3H7OH + R ⇄ C3H7O + RH (R39) iC3H7OH + R ⇄ (CH3)2COH + RH (R40) iC3H7OH + R ⇄ CH3(CH2)CHOH + RH The laminar flame speeds of the propanol isomers in air have been measured in a few studies. Beeckmann et al. [154] noted that the n-propanol chemical kinetic model proposed by Johnson et al. [193] could not well reproduce laminar flame speeds measurements by Veloo et al. at 1 bar [198] or their own 10 bar data [154]. Fig. 32 displays experimental [198] and simulated laminar flame speeds for n-propanol/air and iso-propanol/air mixtures at 1 bar. The present chemical kinetic model well reproduces experimentally measured values for both fuels across the entire range of tested conditions. The simulations and experiments indicate that iso-propanol is significantly less reactive than n-propanol, which indicates that methyl substitution decreases flame speeds. This effect of branching on flame speed is well established in alkane combustion; increased branching decreases formation of reactive H radicals and increases formation of stable allyl radicals [109,417]. The homogenous ignition delay times of n-propanol/air and iso-propanol/air mixtures have been studied at a limited number of conditions, primarily at higher temperatures and lower pressures [150,193,196,200]. Ignition studies at engine-relevant conditions (e.g., lower temperatures and higher pressures) are not available for testing chemical kinetic models. Fig. 33 presents comparisons of kinetic modeling simulations and experimentally measured shock tube ignition delay times for n-propanol/air and iso-propanol/air mixtures at pressures ranging from 1.2 to 16 bar, temperatures above 1100 K [200], and equivalence ratios ranging from lean to rich. The shock tube measurements display Arrhenius behavior across the entire range of conditions. iso-Propanol is notably slower to ignite (i.e., less reactive) that n-propanol at the same conditions. These features, as well as equivalence ratio effects, are well reproduced by the kinetic modeling simulations. The present set of tested conditions does not allow us to draw conclusions on the lower temperature (i.e., below 1000 K) reactivity of the propanol isomers. The general reaction scheme for n-propanol and iso-propanol combustion in premixed flames and batch reactors is presented in Figs. 34 and 35 , respectively. The combustion of the propanol isomers is initiated by hydrogen abstraction by radicals (e.g., OH, HO2, H, CH3, etc.). As in the case of ethanol, the hydrogen abstraction reactions favor the formation of α-hydroxypropyl radicals. At high temperatures, the β-scission products of fuel radicals from n-propanol are ethylene, propene, ethenol, propanal (i.e., propionaldehyde), and formaldehyde. Propanal further decomposes to form CO and ethyl radical (C2H5). The β-scission products of fuel radicals from iso-propanol are propene, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone. Subsequent decomposition of propene and acetone both form resonantly stabilized radicals, which inhibit reactivity. Therefore, iso-propanol exhibits lower flame speeds and longer high temperature ignition delay times that n-propanol because a larger concentration of stable intermediates are formed. At low temperatures (i.e., below 1000 K), the fuel-derived radicals react with O2 to form a range of products. The primary product from n-propanol's α-hydroxypropyl channel is propanal + HO2, while iso-propanol’s α-hydroxypropyl channel yields acetone + HO2. For both propanol isomers, the β-hydroxypropyl + O2 channel proceeds through stabilization of a β-peroxy (β-RO2) radical that undergoes a Waddington isomerization and decomposition channel to form one formaldehyde, one acetaldehyde, and an OH radical."
19,The combustion chemistry of butanol isomers,"4.8 The combustion chemistry of butanol isomers The combustion chemistry of butanol isomers has been an area of intense research activity in the recent six years. The primary focus of this work has been on n-butanol because industrialists have targeted it as an alternative fuel for deployment in the foreseeable future [418]. Nevertheless, the other butanol isomers are also gaining industry attention, and studying all the butanol isomers as a family of fuels can elucidate unique structural effects (e.g., methyl and OH substitution) on the global combustion properties and combustion emission profiles of alcohols. The first chemical kinetic model for n-butanol combustion was developed by Dagaut and coworkers [208,419] with comparisons against JSR speciation data (800–1100 K and 10 bar). Around the same time, Moss et al. [207] conducted high-temperature shock tube ignition delay measurements (1200–1800 K and 1–4 bar) and proposed a chemical kinetic model for all the four isomers of butanol using the EXGAS software [207,316]. Later, Sarathy et al. [211] extended the comparisons of Dagaut et al.’s butanol model [208,419] to atmospheric pressure measurements of JSR speciation, premixed laminar flame speed, and counterflow diffusion flame speciation. Black et al. [212] also proposed an n-butanol chemical kinetic model that was compared against Dagaut and coworker's JSR data [208] and their own shock tube measurements (1100–1800 K, 1–8 bar). The aforementioned n-butanol combustion studies laid important foundations, but all were limited in their targets because of the unavailability of data in various reactive environments. The first attempts to model a large set of experimental data for n-butanol were made by Harper et al. [121] and Grana et al. [213]. Harper et al. [121] utilized the automatic Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software [420,421] to generate an n-butanol combustion model capable of reproducing JSR speciation, counterflow diffusion flame species profiles, high-temperature shock tube ignition delay times, doped methane diffusion flame species profiles, and n-butanol pyrolysis experiments. Subsequently, the RMG software was utilized by Van Geem et al. [216] to develop chemical kinetic models for all four butanol isomers. Grana et al. [213] also developed a hierarchical chemical kinetic model with detailed sub-mechanisms for all four butanol isomers. Their n-butanol model was also widely compared against experimental speciation data from JSRs and counterflow diffusion flames, premixed laminar flame speeds, and high-temperature shock tube ignition delay times. Furthermore, Grana et al. [213] also included models for the other butanol isomers with comaparisons presented for all four isomers against high-temperature shock tube ignition delay data [207], iso-butanol species profiles in counterflow diffusion flames, and tert-butanol oxidation in a flow reactor [133]. Despite the noteworthy modeling studies prior to 2011, the models did not include the low-temperature peroxy chemistry needed to simulate ignition at engine-relevant conditions (e.g., low temperatures and high pressures). Again, the limiting factor was the lack of experimental data at such conditions to motivate such modeling studies. Heufer et al. [219] were the first to conduct shock tube ignition delay measurements of n-butanol at low temperatures and high pressures (10–42 bar and 770–1250 K). Weber et al. [104] later studied the ignition of n-butanol in an RCM at elevated pressures and low to intermediate temperatures (15 and 30 bar, 675–925 K, and ϕ = 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0). Both these studies demonstrated that butanol models simulated longer ignition delay times (by more than a factor of 10) at temperatures below ∼950 K, suggesting that important reaction pathways were missing from the models. Shortly thereafter, Vranckx et al. [223] obtained additional n-butanol shock tube ignition data near 80 bar (795 K–1200 K). Their experimental results showed that n-butanol exhibits NTC behavior at elevated pressures similar to alkanes, thus motivating the researchers to develop a simplified sub-mechanism for butylperoxy formation capable of simulating their experimental data. This simplified peroxy mechanism was later revised in a comprehensive modeling study by Sarathy et al. [260], which included detailed low-temperature reaction pathways for all butanol isomers. The model by Sarathy et al. [260] is capable of accurately simulating ignition of n-butanol, iso-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol at low temperatures and elevated pressures, as will be demonstrated later. For the iso-butanol isomer, Merchant et al. have published models of comparable accuracy [232,233] that also includes species and reactions leading to formation of aromatic byproducts. Furthermore, the model developed by Merchant et al. was developed independently yet well predicts a wide range of experimental data, and thus demonstrates the ability to formulate a predictive model a priori. The above background discussion exhibits the data-driven methodology that led to improved models for low-temperature combustion of the butanol isomers. As mentioned previously, the low-temperature ignition behavior of methanol, ethanol, and propanol isomers can be modeled successfully without the need for alkane-like peroxy chemistry. The following sections further describe the important reactions in the oxidation of the butanol isomers, including thermal decomposition, hydrogen abstractions, and low-temperature reaction pathways. The unimolecular thermal decompositions of the butanol isomers proceed primarily via dehydration reactions and C–C bond scissions. C–O bond scissions are however negligible because their BDEs are approximately 10 kcal higher than those of C–C bonds. Rosado-Reyes and Tsang [387] used a single pulse-shock tube to perform the first direct measurement of n-butanol dehydration. The authors also estimated C–C bond scission rate coefficients using their measured GC-FID/MS results. They showed that previous estimates used in combustion models [207,208,213] for these reactions were not in agreement with their rate coefficients. A notable conclusion from their work was the lack of pressure dependence observed for these reaction rate coefficients (1.5–6.5 bar), which they verified by master equation calculations. Thus, these reactions are at their high-pressure limit in practical combustion environments. Cai et al. [225] recently performed a theoretical study on the unimolecular decomposition of n-butanol using variational transition state theory with master equation modeling to provide temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients. At atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range of 850–1150 K, the rate coefficients for n-butanol dehydration calculated by Cai et al. [225] are a factor of 2–4 greater than those measured by Rosado-Reyes and Tsang [387]. The rates for thermal decomposition of iso-butanol [390], 2-butanol [388], and tert-butanol [203,204,386] have also been measured experimentally in single-pulse shock tubes. Rosado-Reyes et al. [390] showed that the dehydration rate coefficients of iso-butanol calculated by themselves and by Zhou et al. [422] were within a factor of 2 of experimental measurements, and that the pressure effects were minimal. The decomposition rate coefficient for 2-butanol was measured by Rosado-Reyes and Tsang [388], and their measured dehydration rate coefficients were in good agreement with the ab initio calculations of El-Nahas et al. [423]; however, the measured C–C bond scission rate coefficients were notably different than those from calculations [423]. The measured rate coefficients for tert-butanol dehydration by Tsang [203] were in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements of Lewis et al. [204] and the rate coefficients calculated from theory [386]. Rosado-Reyes et al. [390] also concluded that the rate coefficient of fuel alcohol dehydration reactions is controlled primarily by the available number of hydrogen atoms for water elimination, and not by the position of the OH group (primary, secondary, or tertiary). Shock tube species time-history experiments by Stranic et al. [111,112] provide experimental data under pyrolysis conditions that are sensitive to unimolecular decomposition rates. A recent modeling study by Vasu and Sarathy [238] showed that the majority of data from Stranic et al. could by accurately simulated by adopting the aforementioned unimolecular decomposition rate constants proposed by Rosado-Reyes et al. H-atom abstraction reactions from n-butanol proceed from one of five sites (α, β, γ, δ, or hydroxyl). 2-butanol (sC4H9OH) also has five unique abstraction sites with a hydroxyl site (R41), α site (secondary, (R42)), two unique β sites (a primary, (R43), and secondary, (R44)), and a γ site (primary, (R45)). iso-Butanol has three unique abstraction sites (α, β, γ, and hydroxyl), whereas tert-butanol has two (three βs and a hydroxyl). (R41) sC4H9OH + R⇄C4H9O + RH (R42) sC4H9OH + R⇄CH3CH2C(CH3)OH + RH (R43) sC4H9OH + R⇄CH3CH2CH(CH2)OH + RH (R44) sC4H9OH + R⇄CH3CHCH(CH3)OH + RH (R45) sC4H9OH + R⇄CH2CH2CH(CH3)OH + RH The H-atom abstraction rate coefficients by H radicals from the butanols have not been measured experimentally. Ratkiewicz et al. [424] and Carstensen and Dean [302] presented ab initio calculations for all four isomers of butanol. The latter authors explained that the OH group does not affect the rate coefficients of H-atom abstraction by H radical atoms after the β C–H site, and the rate rule converges to that for hydrocarbons. Based on this assumption, Sarathy et al. [260] assigned the H-atom abstraction rate coefficient by H radicals from the α carbon and hydroxyl moiety based on the ethanol + H work of Sivaramakrishnan et al. [366]. The β-carbon C–H BDE in n-butanol is between that of a secondary and primary C–H BDE of n-butane; the rate of abstraction was therefore calculated as the average of the two [212]. The abstraction rates for sites more than two carbons away from the hydroxyl group (e.g., γ and δ carbon atoms in n-butanol) were taken to be equal to analogous abstraction rates from secondary and primary carbon sites of n-butane [425]. Experimentalists and theoreticians have recently studied hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals in all the butanol isomers. The rate coefficients for all these isomers have been measured from low to high temperatures, as shown in Table 5. The total rate of n-butanol + OH at high temperatures (above 900 K) measured by Vasu et al. [380] and Pang et al. [381] are in good agreement with each other. Subsequent high-temperature studies (above 900 K) by Pang et al. on iso-butanol + OH [382] and 2-butanol + OH [383] have also confined these total rate coefficients within narrow uncertainty limits. Atmospheric chemistry researchers have also studied butanol + OH reactions at temperatures generally below 400 K. McGillen et al. [385] recently measured rate coefficients of hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals for all four butanol isomers at low temperatures, and their results showed excellent agreement with previous measurements [373,376–379]. Thus, it has become possible to estimate the total rate coefficient for all butanol isomers across low to high temperatures (220–1800 K), including the intermediate range of 400–1000 K where no measurements are available. However, less certain are the branching ratios of hydrogen abstraction reactions from the α, β, γ, and δ C–H sites and the hydroxyl moiety, because direct measurements are not available. Theoretical calculations [426–429] have been performed to determine these branching ratios, but they are often unreliable because their total rate coefficients do not match experimental data [260,385]. These reactions are particularly challenging to calculate due to very low energy barriers, the large number of butanol conformers, pre- and post-reaction complexes, and the theoretical treatment of the various hindered rotors. For this reason, Sarathy et al. [260] indirectly estimated site-specific rate coefficients by combining previous theoretical calculations, analogies with alkanes, and Evans–Polyani correlations [411]. Their estimated rate coefficients were shown to agree (i.e., within a factor of 2) with low- and high-temperature rate coefficient measurements, and they enabled accurate simulations of low-temperature ignition delay times sensitive to butanol + OH reactions [260]. Recently, McGillen et al. [385] (Fig. 36 ) employed an elegant approach of combining experimental rate coefficient measurements, room temperature end-product yields, and modified structure–activity relationships (SAR) of Bethel et al. [430] to derive self-consistent, site-specific rate coefficients for all four butanol isomers. The rates recommended by McGillen et al. [385] are yet to be tested in comprehensive combustion models of the butanol isomers. Future modeling studies should therefore make an effort to utilize them. Hydrogen abstraction from butanol isomers by HO2 has never been measured experimentally. Sarathy et al. [260] used a combination of theoretical calculations and estimations to determine these rates. The H-atom abstraction rates by HO2 radicals were based on the ab initio calculations (CCSD level of theory) for n-butanol + HO2 by Zhou et al. [326]. Their calculations considered primary effects (e.g., C–H BDEs) and secondary effects (e.g., pre-reaction complexes and transition states exhibiting hydrogen bonding) on the rate coefficient. Sarathy et al. [260] multiplied the α-channel rate coefficient by a factor of 2.5, to obtain better agreement with intermediate shock tube ignition delay experiments. Evans–Polanyi type correlations with the n-butanol + HO2 system were used to estimate abstraction rates for the other butanol isomers. Their estimations derive abstraction rate coefficients based on the proximity of C–H sites to the hydroxyl moiety (e.g., α, β, γ, etc.). In this way, the effects of hydrogen-bonded transition state complexes on the rate coefficients (e.g., entropy effects) are indirectly captured. The authors [260] found this approach to work well for iso- and 2- butanol, but not for tert-butanol, wherein the rate expression for H-atom abstraction by HO2 from a primary C–H bond of n-butane was used with the A-factor modified to account for reaction path degeneracy. The rates of hydrogen abstraction from the butanol isomers by HO2 were consistent with those previously mentioned for methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol, showing that abstraction from the α-site is predominant. At high temperatures, the various C4H9O radicals formed from n-, 2-, iso-, and tert-butanol react via thermal decomposition (i.e., β-scission reactions) and unimolecular isomerization reactions. Isomerization reactions are favored for 5- and 6-member transition state rings, which limits their importance to H-atom migration reactions between the γ or δ site and the hydroxyl site (i.e., γ-rad or δ-rad to O-rad). Isomerization reactions have been studied theoretically in n-butanol’s C4H9O radicals by Zheng and Truhlar [431], Xu et al. [432], and Zhang et al. [433], with reasonable agreement between the studies. Experimental or theoretical studies of isomerization reactions involving C4H9O radicals from 2-, iso-, and tert-butanol were not found. Studies on β-scission reactions for various C4H9O radicals are also limited to the n-butanol system. Simmie and Curran [434] theoretically studied the decomposition of butanol's α-hydroxybutyl decomposition to ethenol + ethyl, butanal + H, or butanol + H. Recently, Zhang et al. [433] performed a comprehensive theoretical study of the decomposition and isomerization of n-butanol’s hydrobutyl and butoxy radicals. Their calculations showed that the channel leading to ethenol + ethyl in the α-hydroxybutyl radical is dominant at all temperatures, which agrees with the calculations of Simmie and Curran [434]. The β-radical decomposition was studied theoretically using addition of OH to 1-butene as an entrance channel and subsequent decomposition, either back to the reactants or on to methyl + 2-propenol. The calculated rate coefficient for OH + 1-butene was in very good agreement with experimental studies at low temperatures [435]. Zhang et al. [433] found that the β- and γ-hydroxybutyl radicals decompose primarily to 1-butene + OH and propene + CH2OH, respectively. Below 800 K, the δ-radical can isomerize to form a butoxy radical, which then decomposes to propyl + CH2O. At higher temperatures, the δ-radical decomposes to ethylene + CH2CH2OH. The pressure-dependent rate coefficients calculated by Zhang et al. [433] are recommended for use in chemical kinetic models for n-butanol. Similar comprehensive theoretical studies are needed for the other butanol isomers. At lower temperatures (below 1000 K), reactions between C4H9O radicals (from n-, 2-, iso-, and tert-butanol) and O2 become important. Due to the number of carbon atoms, the possible low-temperature reactions pathways in C4H9O + O2 are numerous, including concerted elimination, stabilization of hydroxybutylperoxy (RO2) radicals, and subsequent isomerization, cyclization, and decomposition reactions. Welz et al. combined quantum-chemical calculations and experimental measurements of product formation to explore the low-temperature reaction mechanisms of hydroxybutyl radicals from n-butanol [346], iso-butanol [436], and tert-butanol [436]. For example, Fig. 37 presents stationary points on the PES for reactions of n-butanol’s α-hydroxybutyl and β-hydroxybutyl radicals plus O2 with the most important low-temperature products highlighted in red. The α-hydroxybutyl radical reacts with O2 to form butanal + HO2, a reaction similar to that discussed previously for α-hydroxyethyl radicals. This reaction proceeds through a shallow well, implying that stabilization of the α-hydroxybutylperoxy radical intermediate is only possible at high pressures. This concerted elimination reaction leading to an aldehyde + HO2 is the primary consumption pathway of α-hydroxybutyl radicals derived from iso-butanol [436] and 2-butanol. However, rate coefficients have not been measured experimentally or calculated. The β-hydroxybutyl radical from n-, 2-, iso-, and tert-butanol reacts with O2 to form the stabilized β-hydroxybutylperoxy radical (β-RO2), which is then subject to a variety of reactions. The most important of these is the Waddington reaction, which involves a six-membered ring isomerization to abstract an H atom from the hydroxyl moiety (i.e., forming an alkylhydroperoxide alkoxy), followed by rapid decomposition. In the n-butanol system, the β-RO2 Waddington pathway leads to propanal, formaldehyde, and OH. These reactions are chain propagating and compete directly with low-temperature chain branching pathways, thereby inhibiting low-temperature reactivity. Sun et al. [344] conducted theoretical calculations on these Waddington reactions in the tert-butanol and iso-butanol systems, showing their importance for the production of important carbonyl products. The γ- and δ-hydroxybutyl radicals from n-, 2-, iso-, and tert-butanol also react with O2 to form stabilized RO2 radicals. These can undergo concerted eliminations to form butenol + HO2, cyclization to form epoxy alcohols, internal H-atom migration to form butylhydroperoxides (QOOH), and subsequent low-temperature chain branching reactions. These pathways are largely unexplored, but can be included in models based on analogies with low-temperature oxidation schemes of alkanes. Welz et al. [346] also identified a low-lying water elimination pathway for the consumption of γ- and δ-QOOH radicals with a radical on the α site. Their importance in the low-temperature oxidation schemes for alcohols has not been rigorously tested in butanol combustion models. Detailed kinetic rate coefficient studies using state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods are needed to develop accurate chemical kinetic models for low-temperature oxidation of butanol and higher alcohols. The butanol model utilized in the present analysis is that developed by Sarathy et al. [260] for the four isomers of butanol with minor modifications to unimolecular decomposition rate coefficients, as described recently by Vasu and Sarathy [238]. This model has been comprehensively developed for combustion of butanol isomers at low and high temperatures. The model presented in Refs. [232,233] has also been comprehensively tested against iso-butanol data. In their paper [260], the authors present comparisons against shock tube ignition delay data, JSR speciation data, premixed laminar flame speeds, and low-pressure premixed laminar flame speciation data. The laminar flame speeds of n-, iso-, 2-, and tert-butanol/air mixtures have been measured in a number of studies, as noted in Table 6, and there is reasonably good agreement across the various measurements obtained at atmospheric pressure. Recently, Wu and Law [236] performed a thorough experimental study that measured premixed laminar flame speeds of the four butanol isomers at 1, 2, and 5 bar. The authors utilized the chemical kinetic model developed by Sarathy et al. [260] to interpret their results, as this model showed excellent agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 38 ). The authors [236] found that n-butanol has the fastest flame speed, iso-butanol and 2-butanol have similar flame speeds, and tert-butanol has the slowest. Wu and Law [236] further investigated the thermal and kinetic contributions to flame speeds to rationalize the observed differences. Comparable adiabatic flame temperatures and heat release profiles between the fuels indicated that thermal effects cannot be responsible for the variations in flame speeds. The underlying cause for differences in laminar flame speeds is attributed to formation of less-reactive, unsaturated branched intermediates in the case of iso-, 2-, and tert-butanol compared to the less-reactive straight-chain intermediates formed from n-butanol. The latter decomposes primarily to vinyl and methyl radicals, which accelerate flame propagation. tert-Butanol and iso-butanol flames produce iso-butene and branched oxygenates (e.g., branched enols and acetone). iso-Butene is less reactive due to the formation of the resonantly stabilized 2-methyl-allyl radical following H-atom abstraction, which results in lower flame speeds [109,417,437]. Similar branched unsaturated oxygenates formed in iso- and 2-butanol flames results in lower concentrations of reactive vinyl and methyl radicals and higher concentrations of less reactive allyl radicals [109], thus lowering flame speeds. The homogenous ignition delay of the butanol isomers at high temperatures has been studied by a number of experimentalists, as shown in Table 6. Recently, Stranic et al. [108] studied the ignition of n-, iso-, 2-, and tert-butanol at high temperatures (i.e., above 1000 K) and pressures ranging from approximately 1–50 bar (4% fuel in Ar/O2 mixtures). Both experimental data and simulation results using the model of Sarathy et al. [260] showed that n-butanol is the most reactive, followed by 2-butanol, with iso-butanol exhibiting similar reactivity, while tert-butanol is much less reactive. Molecular dehydration reactions are important in controlling the relative reactivity of the butanol isomers under these high-temperature, high-dilution conditions. tert-Butanol is the least reactive because molecular dehydration reactions form the stable iso-butene intermediate. The ignition of butanol isomers at low to intermediate temperatures and high pressures has not been studied extensively. Shock tube measurements of butanol/air mixtures at temperatures below 1000 K and elevated pressures have not been performed on the four isomers of butanol. n-Butanol has been studied under such conditions by Heufer et al. [219], Stranic et al. [223], and Zhu et al. [240]. Fig. 39 displays the measured and simulated n-butanol ignition delay times using conventional filling methods [219,223] and the constrained reaction volume (CRV) strategy developed by Hanson et al. [101] and applied by Zhu et al. [240]. The data obtained using conventional filling methods are simulated using variable volumes profiles that account for experimental pre-ignition pressure rise, while simulations of the CRV data are conducted under constant pressure conditions. In both cases, the model is able to simulate the temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio dependences. It is interesting to note that significant low-temperature reactivity of n-butanol is observed at pressures above 20 bar, a phenomenon not observed in the smaller alcohols. Therefore, low-temperature peroxy chemistry is needed in n-butanol chemical kinetic models to simulate engine-relevant ignition behavior. The ignition of all four isomers of butanol at low and intermediate temperatures and elevated pressures has been studied in an RCM by Weber et al. [105], as shown in Fig. 40 . Under such conditions, n-butanol is notably more reactive than iso-, 2-, and tert-butanol. Variable volume simulations using the model by Sarathy et al. [260] are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data, but improvements in quantitative agreement are needed. The study by Weber et al. [105] concluded that low-temperature peroxy chemistry is important to all butanol isomers, and accurate rate coefficients in this network are needed. More details on low-temperature reaction pathways are discussed later. Species evolving from the oxidation and pyrolysis of the butanol isomers have been studied in flow reactors, stirred reactors, non-premixed flames, and premixed flames using various diagnostic techniques, as shown in Table 3. Most studies have focused on high-temperature oxidation in flames and pyrolysis reactors. Recent experimental and modeling studies by Cai et al. on n-butanol [225], 2-butanol [235], and tert-butanol [224] have demonstrated the ability to reproduce high-temperature combustion and pyrolysis species. The authors combined quantum chemistry calculations to obtain rate coefficients for important unimolecular decomposition and β-scission reactions, and then compared their models with species profiles measured with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (VUV-PI-MS). Sarathy et al. [260] and Frassoldati et al. [318] have also developed combustion models of the four butanol isomers against VUV-PI-MS species profiles in low-pressure premixed flames studied by Oßwald [221]. Low-pressure premixed flames of n-butanol and iso-butanol have also been probed by Hansen et al. [218,232] by VUV-PI-MS. The important oxygenated hydrocarbon species arising from the combustion of the four butanol isomers are shown in Table 7 . All the butanol isomers produce formaldehyde, ketene, ethenol, and acetaldehyde. The C3 and C4 species differ among the isomers due to the different molecular structures. The pathways leading to the different species are discussed next. The high-temperature combustion of the butanol isomers differs notably from the low-temperature consumption pathways; we therefore present them separately. Fig. 41 presents the general high-temperature reaction schemes for n-, iso, 2-, and tert-butanol. The major product species arising from the direct decomposition of the fuels are in agreement with those measured in experiments, as shown in Table 7. At high temperatures, the principal consumption pathways are unimolecular decompositions (including dehydrations) and hydrogen abstractions followed by β-scission of fuel radicals. The primary stable decomposition products from n-butanol combustion are ethenol, 1-butene, 2-propenal, propene, ethylene, along with the radicals ethyl, hydroxyl, methyl, hydroxymethyl, and α-hydroxyethyl. iso-Butanol yields the stable intermediates n-propenol, n-propanal, iso-butene, and propene, plus the radicals methyl, hydroxyl, and hydroxymethyl. 2-Butanol combustion is notably more complex with stable products including iso-propenol, acetone, ethenol, 1-butene, 2-butene, 1-propenol, n-propanal, and ethylene, and the radicals methyl, ethyl, hydroxyl, and α-hydroxyethyl. tert-Butanol consumption is relatively simple due to the high degree of symmetry. iso-Propenol, acetone, and iso-butene are the important stable products, plus methyl radicals. The low-temperature oxidation of the butanol isomers is shown in Fig. 42 to help explain the differences in low-temperature reactivity discussed previously. Following initial H-atom abstraction by OH, the subsequent possible low-temperature reaction pathways for the butanol isomers distinguish their reactivity. n-Butanol radicals react with molecular oxygen and then can either lead to OH branching (via QOOH), OH propagation (via the Waddington mechanism), or OH termination (aldehyde/enol + HO2). It should be noted that some of the QOOH is used to form one OH radical and one HO2 radical that is also used to form low-temperature radical branching. The γ- and δ-hydroxybutyl radicals contribute most to OH branching in n-butanol. The α-hydroxy-butyl radical leads primarily to OH termination, and the β-hydroxybutyl radical leads to either OH branching, OH termination, or OH propagation. iso-Butanol is less reactive than n-butanol because chain branching evolves from γ-hydroxybutyl radicals; initial H-atom abstractions are slower from γ primary sites due to their high BDEs. In addition, the β-hydroxybutyl radical favors the OH propagation (Waddington mechanism) route because internal H-atom migration reaction leading to QOOH (and subsequent chain branching) can only proceed via high-energy barrier 5-membered ring transition states. The low-temperature pathways for 2-butanol show the same chain termination pathways for reactions involving its α-hydroxybutyl radical. The two β sites (i.e., one of the ethyl branch and one on the methyl branch) contribute little to OH branching because of competing OH termination and OH propagation routes. OH branching comes mainly from the γ-hydroxybutyl radical. tert-Butanol is unique because there are no α-C–H bonds. The three primary β-radicals can react with O2 and lead to OH branching and/or OH propagation. OH propagation via the Waddington mechanism is favored because the high BDEs of the primary C–H bonds slow internal H-atom migration reactions."
20,The combustion chemistry of higher alcohols,"4.9 The combustion chemistry of higher alcohols The combustion chemistry of higher alcohols (i.e., C5 and larger) has not been studied extensively. Several recent works in the past 3–4 years have focused on the isomers of pentanol and n-hexanol. Togbé et al. conducted experiments on n-pentanol [246] and n-hexanol [244] in JSRs and premixed laminar flames, and then developed chemical kinetic models to simulate their experimental data. n-Pentanol oxidation in the JSR did not exhibit any cool flame behavior; low-temperature kinetic pathways were therefore not included in their model. On the other hand, n-hexanol has cool flame reactivity and a low-temperature oxidation scheme was assembled to reproduce this behavior in the JSR. Neither of the models by Togbé et al. [244,246] have been compared against to low-temperature ignition data. Recently, Heufer et al. [248] and Sarathy et al. [252] developed comprehensive models for n-pentanol and iso-pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol), respectively, which were compared against ignition delay measurements in RCMs and shock tubes, speciation profiles in JSRs, and premixed laminar flame speeds. These pentanol isomer models form the basis for the present discussion on the combustion chemistry of higher alcohols. An extensive discussion on fundamental kinetic studies of high-temperature reactions (e.g., hydrogen abstraction, β-scission, radical isomerization) and low-temperature reaction pathways is not possible for the pentanol isomers because such studies are absent from the literature. Zhao et al. [438] employed quantum chemical calculations with master equation simulations to derive pressure-dependent rate coefficients for the unimolecular decomposition of three pentanol isomers (n-pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-methyl-1-butanol). As shown previously for the other alcohols, dehydration reactions leading the formation of water and an alkene are important from 900 K and above, whilst C–C and C–O bond scissions are competitive at higher temperatures (above 1200 K). Given the rather limited fundamental kinetic data available, Heufer et al. [248] and Sarathy et al. [252] developed comprehensive chemical kinetic models based on analogies to alkanes and alcohols of similar structures. The development of reaction classes follows the methods described in Section 4.3 and Box 1. This approach was first verified by quantum chemical calculations for C–H, C–C, and C–O bond dissociation energies that showed higher alcohols can be sub-divided into an alcohol-specific and alkane-like portion, as shown in Fig. 43 for n-pentanol. All reaction rate coefficients were assigned based on analogous primary and secondary alkane (e.g., n-butane and iso-butane) sites and α , β , and γ alcohol sites (e.g., n-butanol and iso-butanol). The low-temperature reaction mechanism for pentanol isomers is also assembled based on direct analogy with butanol isomers. Recent experimental and theoretical studies by Welz et al. [345,439] enabled the addition of several new low-temperature reaction pathways to the models. Welz et al. [345] described Waddington-type pathways involving hydrogen transfer from the OH group as important for the γ-ROO and δ-ROO radicals via 7- and 8-membered transition state rings. These reaction pathways were therefore added to the models using estimated rate coefficients [252]. Welz et al. [439] also presented a water elimination pathway from hydroxypentylhydroperoxide (QOOH) radicals where the hydroperoxide is on the γ-site and the radical is on the α-site. This reaction pathway is also adopted in the iso-pentanol model developed by Sarathy et al. using estimated rate coefficients [252]. The laminar flame speeds of n- and iso-pentanol/air mixtures have been measured in few studies, as noted in Table 3. n-Pentanol premixed laminar flames speeds were measured by Togbé et al. [246] at 423 K, and simulations using the present chemical kinetic model are shown in Fig. 44 . The model indicates that the laminar flame speed is very similar for n-pentanol and n-butanol over the whole range of equivalence ratios, a phenomenon which has also been observed for C5–C12 n-alkanes [440]. The concentrations of reactive H, OH, and CH3 radicals generated during the combustion of n-butanol and n-pentanol are similar, and thus their global high temperature reactivities, manifested as premixed flame speed or ignition delay, are similar. iso-Pentanol measurements and simulations at a temperature of 353 K are also presented in Fig. 44. Similar to the case of normal alcohols, the data and model indicate that iso-pentanol and iso-butanol have similar flame speeds. Again this is due to the fact that the intermediate pools of radical species are similar in iso-pentanol and iso-butanol flames. The homogenous ignition delay of the pentanol isomers has been studied in STs and RCMs, as shown in Table 3. Recently, Heufer et al. [103,108] studied the ignition of n-pentanol at temperature from 640 to 1200 K and pressures from 9 to 30 bar. The 30 bar ST ignition delay data were directly comparable to data obtained for n-butanol under similar conditions [219], as shown in Fig. 45 . Both the experiments and present chemical kinetic model indicate that n-pentanol has greater reactivity in the NTC region, which is attributed to its longer chain length promoting low-temperature chain branching reactions. Above 1000 K, n-pentanol and n-butanol exhibit similar high temperature reactivity, which is consistent with the flame speed comparison presented above. iso-Pentanol ignition delay measurements are available at pressures ranging from 7 to 60 bar [249,252], and model simulations near 20 bar are presented in Fig. 45. The data spanning lean to rich conditions show a strong equivalence ratio dependence at low temperatures that is less prominent at higher temperatures. The present chemical kinetic model simulations are able to capture the low-, NTC-, and high-temperature reactivity of iso-pentanol in the ST and RCM. Speciation measurements resulting from the oxidation of n- and iso-pentanol are available in JSRs. Researchers at CNRS Orleans have presented data at a range from lean to rich equivalence ratios for n-pentanol near 10 bar [246] and iso-pentanol near 10 bar [245] and 5 bar [252]. The chemical kinetic models for each fuel are able to qualitatively reproduce the transient fuel reactivity, formation of major product species, and profiles of oxygenated intermediates. In general, the important oxygenated products are identical to those presented previously for n-butanol and iso-butanol (Table 7), albeit C5 aldehydes are also produced from the reaction of α-hydroxypentyl radicals with molecular oxygen. The chemical kinetic model for iso-pentanol [252] indicates that the acetone present at low and intermediate temperatures arises from the water elimination pathway proposed by Welz et al. [439]. Both experiments and models indicate that the pentanol isomers do not display low- and NTC-temperature reactivity in the JSR under the conditions studied (1000 ppm fuel in air), which is a behavior consistent with smaller alcohols; however, Togbé et al. [244] showed that low- and NTC-temperature reactivity is observed for n-hexanol. Extensive studies on the reaction pathways for combustion of pentanol isomers are lacking, so presenting general high- and low-temperature mechanistic pathways is not warranted. The high temperature decomposition pathways are analogous to those already presented for the butanol isomers. For simplicity, we present actual pathway analyses performed for the combustion of pentanol isomers under specific low-temperature conditions. A reaction path analysis for n-butanol and n-pentanol under similar shock tube ignition delay conditions is presented in Fig. 46 to highlight the differences in their reactivity. It was previously shown that the n-pentanol exhibits greater low-temperature reactivity than n-butanol in shock tube ignition delay experiments. Both fuels undergo typical H-atom abstraction reactions followed by O2 addition to form RO2 radicals. The primary driver for greater reactivity in n-pentanol is its longer carbon chain length, which permits hydrogen atom abstraction on a secondary “alkane-like” carbon. The subsequent δ-ROO undergoes a six-membered ring internal isomerization to form QOOH, which later reacts with O2 and leads to significant chain branching. Other minor pathways contributing to the differences in low-temperature reactivity between n-butanol and n-pentanol are discussed by Heufer et al. [248]. For iso-pentanol, an NTC region reaction path analysis under JSR and ST conditions is presented. In general, the reaction pathways are similar to those presented and discussed previously for n- and iso-butanol. Similar to the other alcohols, α-hydroxypentyl radicals react with O2 to generate an aldehyde (i.e., iso-pentanal) and HO2. The other hydroxypentyl radicals react with O2 to form hydroxyalkyl peroxy (ROO) radicals. These radicals are mainly isomerized to hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxide (QOOH) or undergo a 5-centered concerted reaction to form HO2 and an enol species. Waddington type reactions are shown to be important for β-ROO radicals. The consumption of α-hydroxypentyl hydroperoxide radicals results in the formation of a cyclic ether plus OH (minor route in STs) or a concerted elimination to carbonyl hydroperoxide plus HO2 (major route in STs). The water elimination pathway is shown to play an important role during JSR oxidation, but it is not important during ignition delay under ST conditions."
21,Insights into engine-relevant phenomena,"A primary goal of this article is to use the knowledge gained on fundamental combustion chemistry of alcohols toward understanding their performance in internal combustion engines. In this section, the comprehensive C1–C5 alcohol kinetic model is utilized to predict the effects of alcohol fuel structure on laminar flame speed, homogenous ignition delay time, and combustion products. These are then related to engine-relevant phenomena, specifically pre-ignition and super-knock, fuel autoignition, and pollutant emissions. Kalghatgi [88,441] explains that pre-ignition is an abnormal combustion phenomenon that occurs in turbocharged DI SI engines, wherein a propagating flame front is established prior to the spark plug firing. Pre-ignition is different than traditional knock, which is an autoignition phenomenon caused by temperature and pressure increasing in the end-gas ahead of the spark-initiated flame front. Pre-ignition may cause the temperature and pressure of the end-gas to increase faster than it would under conventional spark timing, and thus may lead to a heavy knock or “super-knock” event. The criteria for pre-ignition to occur are a local hot spot that initiates thermal runaway followed by a propagating flame front. The probability of pre-ignition increases as as the fuel/air mixture's laminar flame speed increases [88,441]. Fig. 47 displays simulated laminar flame speeds for alcohol/air mixtures using the C1–C5 alcohol kinetic model presented herein. The figure also presents simulated laminar flame speeds for stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures of C1–C5 alkanes, n-heptane, and iso-octane using the kinetic model of Mehl et al. [86,442]. Amongst the alcohols, methanol has the highest laminar flame speed, followed by ethanol. The remaining C3–C5 normal alcohols (i.e., n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol) display similar laminar flame speeds, which are comparable to those of n-alkanes (ethane, propane, n-butane, n-pentane, and n-heptane). All the alcohols and alkanes have similar stoichiometric fuel/air adiabiatic flame temperature, so differences in laminar flame speed are attributed to fuel combustion chemistry. Chemical kinetic modeling reveals that methanol is the most reactive in premixed flames because high-temperature decomposition reactions (i.e., hydrogen abstraction and β-scission) primarily produce formaldehyde, which decomposes quickly to reactive H radicals. Normal C2–C5 alcohols decompose to intermediates that populate the H-radical pool at approximately the same rate, so these fuels display similar laminar flame speeds. It can be concluded with a high degree of confidence that larger normal alcohols (i.e., >C6) will display similar laminar flame speeds. Substitution of methyl or OH in C3–C5 alcohols (i.e., branching) leads to a reduction in flame speed when compared to normal alcohols, as is also shown for iso-alkanes. For example, tert-butanol/air and iso-octane/air mixtures display dramatically suppressed laminar flame speed due to multiple substitutions. Substituted molecules are not as effective at populating the H radical pool because their decomposition leads to the formation of resonantly stabilized radical intermediates. A complete understanding on the effects of substitution (i.e., location and degree) on combustion of alcohols is not yet available due to the lack of experimental data and chemical kinetic models for the many isomers of C5 and greater alcohol fuels. The aforementioned analysis suggests that methanol and ethanol will increase pre-ignition propensity due to their higher laminar flame speeds. Higher molecular weight normal and branched alcohols will not increase pre-ignition propensity compared to typical n- and iso-alkanes found in conventional gasoline fuels. Although higher laminar flame speeds can increase pre-ignition propensity, other fuel factors need to be considered. For example, low-molecular-weight alcohols have higher latent heats of vaporization, which can reduce in-cylinder temperatures and decrease pre-ignition propensity. Furthermore, an increase in pre-ignition propensity does not necessarily result in a super-knock event. As will be shown next, higher octane fuels with longer homogenous ignition delay times decrease knock propensity. Thus, although methanol and ethanol exhibit higher laminar flame speeds that increase pre-ignition propensity, their high octane numbers can inhibit the occurrence of super-knock. The autoignition of fuel/air mixtures is an important design consideration in SI, CI, and HCCI engines. Premixed fuel/air autoignition in SI engines, referred to as knock, occurs in the end-gas region due to increasing in-cylinder temperature and pressure following spark plug firing. A fuel's resistance to autoignition under SI engine conditions is quantified by its RON and MON values. Higher RON and MON values indicate lower autoignition propensity. In CI and LTC engines fuel/air autoignition is desired for controlling combustion timing and susbequent heat release. The cetane number of a fuel quantifies its autoignition propensity under CI engine conditions; higher cetane numbers indicate higher propensity for autoignition. There is an inverse correlation between CN and octane number (RON or MON). Fuels with RON < ∼60 and CN > ∼30 are suitable for CI engines [88,443], those with RON > ∼60–80 are suitable for LTC engines [444–447], and fuels with RON > ∼80 are appropriate for SI engines. It was previously stated that premixed fuel/air ignition delay time can be correlated with its octane rating [86,87]. ST and RCM ignition delay time measurements at high pressures (e.g., greater than 10 bar) and low to NTC temperatures (e.g., 600–1000 K) correlate better with fuel octane and cetane ratings than measurements at lower pressures and/or higher temperatures. Sarathy et al. [87] have proposed that the RON of normal and branched octane isomers can be closely correlated with their ST ignition delay time under specific conditions (e.g., 825 K and 25 atm). Fig. 48 presents the measured RONs of C1 to C5 alcohol fuels (from Table 1), as well as the primary reference fuel (PRF) mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane, versus simulated fuel/air ignition delay time at 825 K and 25 atm. The ignition delay time of PRF fuels are simulated using the comprehensively tested gasoline surrogates model by Mehl et al. [86,442]. n-Heptane has a RON of 0 and iso-octane has a RON of 100, and a non-linear relationship is observed versus the predicted homogenous ignition delay time. Methanol, ethanol, the propanol isomers, and tert-butanol have RON values greater than 100 and predicted ignition delay times longer than those of PRF100. However, n-propanol is predicted as less reactive than ethanol despite its lower RON (104 versus 109, respectively). n-, iso-, and 2-Butanol isomers have octane ratings similar to that of conventional gasoline (90–105) and shorter ignition delay times than PRF100. n-Pentanol has a RON of 82 and the model predicts its decreased reactivity compared to the other alcohols. The measured RON of iso-pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol) is 93, but the model predicts an ignition delay time closer to PRF100. The aforementioned discrepancies for n-propanol and iso-pentanol suggest that additional RON measurements are needed to reduce the uncertainties in applying the correlation, and more fundamental ST or RCM data is required to further refine detailed chemical kinetic models. The high sensitivity of alcohols fuels causes the correlation for alcohols to be quantitatively different than that for PRF fuels, which have zero sensitivity by definition. Higher molecular weight normal alcohols (C5 and higher) have lower octane ratings and display significant low- and NTC-temperature reactivity, thus making them more suitable for CI engine applications. C1–C4 alcohols have higher octane numbers and are more applicable to SI engines. The high sensitivity of alcohols fuels will improve performance in advanced engines, such as LTC and turbocharge DI SI engines [88,443]. An alcohol's ignition propensity is closely related to its molecular structure. Hydrogen abstraction from alcohol fuels is favored at the α-site (i.e., the C bonded to the OH group) due to its proximity to the OH moiety and lower BDE. The subsequent α-hydroxyalkyl + O2 reaction in alcohol fuels suppresses low-temperature reactivity by competing with conventional low-temperature radical chain propagating and branching reactions that initiate ignition processes. This inhibition of low- and NTC-temperature reactivity is the cause of high octane sensitivity in alcohol fuels. The branching ratio of forming the α-hydroxyalkyl radical decreases as the carbon chain length increases, so its inhibiting effects on ignition are lesser for larger alcohols. It is postulated that the critical chain length at which the OH moiety no longer affects low- and NTC-temperature ignition delay is 7–8 carbon atoms. Therefore, n-heptanol or n-octanol are expected to have ignition delay times and octane numbers similar to n-heptane and n-octane, respectively, but further research is needed on higher molecular weight alcohols to confirm this. Methyl and OH substitution in alcohols tends to increase ignition delay times (i.e., increase the octane number) because substitutions increase the number of primary C–H sites, which have higher BDEs and suppress low-temperature radical chain propagating and branching reactions. Fundamental speciation studies presented in this manuscript confirmed that carbonyl emissions commonly observed in engine research are due to the hydroxyl moiety in alcohol fuels. The important oxygenated emissions from C1–C5 alcohols are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde (i.e., ethanal), propanal acetone, butanal isomers, and pentanal isomers. The production of these species is directly linked with molecular structure and combustion chemistry pathways. At high-temperature stoichiometric or fuel-lean conditions, carbonyl products are formed primarily via hydrogen abstraction from the α-site and subsequent β-scission reactions. Methanol's α-hydroxymethyl radical produces formaldehyde, whereas ethanol's α-hydroxymethyl produces acetaldehyde. The α-hydroxyalkyl radicals in C3–C5 normal alcohols form ethenol, which quickly isomerizes/tautomerizes to form acetaldehyde. The high temperature formation of carbonyl compounds may be averted at fuel-rich conditions, wherein hydrogen abstraction reactions are less favorable and unimolecular water elimination reactions favor the formation of alkenes. The C1–C5 alcohols also produce carbonyls directly via α-hydroxyalkyl + O2 ⇄ aldehyde/ketone + HO2 reaction. At low and intermediate temperatures, this is the primary pathway to production of aldehydes and ketones, especially the higher molecular weight carbonyls found during combustion of C3 and larger alcohols. As noted in Section 1, fueling engines with alcohols decreases soot and particulate matter compared to petroleum hydrocarbon fuels. The chemical kinetic modeling work presented in this article does not enable the direct simulation of soot emissions during alcohol fuel combustion. Nevertheless, the present model's insights into fuel decomposition pathways, together with related works in the literature, enable a lucid understanding of how alcohol fuels reduce soot and particulate matter during engine combustion. Fig. 49 from McEnally and Pfefferle [448] presents the measured yield sooting idex (YSI) for various alcohols, n-alkanes, and ethers as a function of their carbon number. The alcohol data is presented for linear alcohols with various OH substitutions (e.g., n-butanol is a 1-alcohol, 2-butanol is a 2-alcohol and 3-pentanol is a 3-alcohol). The YSI is determined by doping an atmospheric pressure non-premixed methane/air coflow diffusion flame with 1000 ppm of the test compound and measuring the maximum soot mass concentration with laser-induced incandescence. The measured soot mass concentrations are normalized to a YSI using n-hexane as YSI = 0 and benzene as YSI = 100 (i.e., analogous to an octane rating) [448]. The dominant fuel consumption pathways in the YSI flames are high-temperature thermal decomposition reactions. Westbrook et al.’s chemical kinetic modeling study of soot formation in diesel engines has shown that soot is formed in rich combustion regions [83], wherein fuel consumption is dominated by high-temperature thermal decomposition reactions. Thus, the YSI measurements are useful for understanding fuel structure effects on soot emissions from engines. The results in Fig. 49 [448] indicate that the YSI of linear alcohols increases as the carbon number increases, which is also true for n-alkanes. Higher carbon number fuels increase soot formation because they inevitably form larger alkenes via unimolecular decomposition (i.e., Reaction class 1) and radical β-scission reactions (i.e., Reaction class 4). These large alkenes subsequently participate in PAH growth and soot formation processes [448,449]. The present chemical kinetic model has demonstrated that alcohol combustion at high temperatures directly results in the formation of large alkenes via four-center unimolecular decomposition reactions [206] (i.e., Reaction class 1 and Fig. 15). These reactions also sequester the fuel bound oxygen atom into a water molecule, thereby preventing the oxidation of carbon atoms and allowing them to participate in soot growth processes. Therefore, C4 and larger alcohol fuels have higher sooting tendencies compared to n-alkanes of the same carbon number. OH substitution in alcohols increases sooting tendency because the faster rates of four-center unimolecular decomposition reactions yield more large alkenes. McEnally and Pfefferle [448] explain that alcohol fuels exhibit lower soot emissions in engines studies because they are used to displace higher carbon number n-alkane fuels, which invariably have higher sooting tendencies. The fuel bound oxygen atom does not actually have any chemical benefit toward reducing soot; it's primary role is the modification of physical properties that enables smaller hydrocarbon chains and higher H/C ratio structures to be blended as liquid fuels [448]. Displacing high carbon number n-alkanes (e.g., n-heptane) and highly sooting aromatics [450] with a small carbon number alcohols (e.g., ethanol) decreases soot emissions from internal combustion engines."
22,Summary and conclusions,"The flammability of alcohols has been known for many centuries, and their combustion for energy dates back more than a hundred years. Despite this long history, a lucid understanding of alcohol combustion chemistry has only become available in the three decades preceding this article's publication date. Literature since the early 1930s was surveyed to provide a comprehensive summary of experimental and theoretical studies. A rapid growth in alcohol combustion chemistry in recent years can be attributed to the improvement of experimental facilities, development of innovative diagnostic techniques, and advances in computational hardware and software. This article's compiled knowledge of alcohol combustion chemistry enabled a better understanding of combustion in engines. Engine-relevant combustion phenomena considered were the fuel's ignition delay time, laminar flame speed, and emissions characteristics. These combustion features were analyzed by surveying fundamental combustion experiments in premixed laminar flames, batch reactors (i.e., STs and RCMs), and flow reactors (i.e., JSRs). This manuscript highlighted the progress made toward understanding detailed chemistry during low- and high-temperature oxidation; with new experimental targets and new theoretical insights, it is now possible to assemble semi-predictive models for alcohols fuels. Thus, a consistent and comprehensive chemical kinetic model for C1–C5 alcohols was compared with the experimental data, and then used to understand chemical contributions toward the aforementioned global combustion properties. The detailed understanding of alcohol combustion chemistry presented in this article provides a fundamental explanation of why these are fuels suitable for internal combustion engines. Higher molecular weight alcohols (e.g., C4 and larger) are beneficial for practical applications due to their higher energy densities. However, ignition delay times and octane numbers are lower for larger alcohols, making them more suitable for CI engines. Methyl or OH substituted alcohols of the same carbon number have higher octane values, so are inherently better SI engine fuels. Advanced LTC engine concepts may utilize the unique chemical features of alcohols to control ignition processes, improve combustion performance, and reduce emissions. From a fuel production perspective, engineers should strive toward producing alcohols spanning a range of carbon numbers for use in SI, CI, and LTC engines. Conventional refining processes (e.g., catalytic isomerization) can be used to produce the most desirable isomers. The increased carbonyl emissions that are unavoidable when burning alcohol fuels may be abated using appropriate catalytic after treatment technologies. Displacing higher carbon number hydrocarbons with lower carbon number alcohols having similar physical properties can reduce soot and particulate matter emissions. Thus, this combustion chemistry review suggests that alcohols are suitable alternative fuels for a wide range of combustion applications. A principal contribution of this review article is presented in Box 2 , wherein directions for future combustion chemistry research are suggested to enable the clean and efficient utilization of alcohol fuels in future internal combustion engines."
