0,Introduction,"It is known that chloro-fluoro aliphatic carbons (CFC) and bromo-fluoro aliphatic carbons (Halon) are environmental pollutants to destroy the ozone layer. Some techniques have been investigated to decompose such halogenated carbons. Among them, irradiation in alcohols is one of the effective methods to degrade not only CFCs but also 1,2-dibromotetrafluoroethane (Halon2402) (Nakagawa, 2015). Initial reactions of alcohol radiolysis are summarized as follows: (1) RCHOH -(irradiation)→ e− solv, RCHOH•+, RCHOH*, etc· (2) RCHOH•+ + RCHOH → R•COH + RCHOH2 + (3) RCHOH•+ + RCHOH → RCHO• + RCHOH2 + (4) e− solv + RCHOH2 + → H• + RCHOH (5) RCHO• + RCHOH → R•COH + RCHOH (6) H• + RCHOH → R•COH + H2 Here RCHOH denotes an alcohol molecule. Because alcohols are polar similarly to water, solvated electron (e− solv) and H• are generated from electrons ejected due to ionization of solvent molecules through mechanism similarly to that in water. On the contrary, two radicals; alkoxy radical (RCHO•) and hydroxyl alkyl radical (R•COH) are mainly produced from cation radical of a solvent molecule (RCHOH•+) (Eqs. 2 and 3) instead of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) produced from water radical cation (H2O•+) in water. The alkoxy radical can transform into the hydroxyl alkyl radical through a reaction with another alcohol molecule (Eq. (5)). In addition, the hydroxyl alkyl radical can be produced not only through these pathways but also through the hydrogen abstraction reaction from an alcohol molecule by H• (Eq. (6)). A mechanism of radiation-induced degradation of Halon2402 in alcohols is suggested as follows: (7) e− solv + BrF2C-CF2Br → BrF2C-CF2Br•− (8) R•COH + BrF2C-CF2Br → BrF2C-CF2Br•− + RC=O + H+ (9) BrF2C-CF2Br•− → BrF2C-•CF2 + Br− (10) BrF2C-•CF2 + RCHOH → R•COH + BrF2C-CF2H An anion radical of Halon2402 (BrF2C-CF2Br•−), which is produced by electron attachment (Eq. (7)) or by electron transfer from the hydroxyl alkyl radical (Eq. (8)), dissociates into Br− and a neutral radical of Halon2402 (BrF2C-•CF2) (Eq. (9)). The hydroxyl alkyl radical can be reproduced when Halon2401 (BrF2C-CF2H) is produced from the neutral radical (Eq. (10)). The G value, which is the yield of radiolytic products, of e− solv in alcohol is about 2 (100 eV)−1, while that of the degradation of Halon2402 is considerably higher by a factor of several thousands (Nakagawa, 2015), showing that most of Halon2402 are decomposed by chain reactions (Eqs. 8–10). Not only Br−, but also H+ is produced through the chain reactions so it is important to know effect of proton addition. Formation of dibromine radical anion (Br2 •−) through an oxidation of Br− in acidic methanol was investigated by pulse radiolysis (Dainton et al., 1972). It is expected that protons and halide anions (X−) are produced through radiation-induced chain reactions in alcohols. This would lead to production of dihalogen radical anions (X2 •−), which would influence the efficiency of the dehalogenation. Thus it is necessary to study whether X2 •− is produced or not during the radiolysis of alcohols containing the halogenated carbons. Halide anions are one of the most famous scavengers for •OH and the scavenging reaction leads to the generation of X2 •−, which is rather stable compared to •OH (Matheson et al., 1966; Zehavi and Rabani, 1972; Mamou et al., 1977). Based on this point of view, the detection of X2 •− has been used in studies of primary yields of •OH produced during water radiolysis (Baldacchino et al., 2006; Mirdamadi-Esfahani et al., 2009; Iwamatsu et al., 2016). Recently, a detailed mechanism of radiation-induced reactions in aqueous solution of bromide ion was revisited (Yamashita et al., 2015). El Omar et al. studied the radiolysis of aqueous solutions of concentrated halide anion (> 1 M), concluding that the water cation radical (H2O•+), can react with X− at concentrated conditions, to generate a halide atom (X•), which subsequently reacts with another halide anion to produce X2 •− (El Omar et al., 2012, 2013). As shown above, there are lots of studies on X2 •− produced by radiolysis in aqueous solutions. However, there are almost no reports on those in alcohol solutions except for a few of them in methanol (Dainton et al., 1972; Feldman et al., 1986). This would be because sodium or potassium halides cannot dissolve in the other alcohols like, 2-propanol and so on. In this report, Br2 •− produced not only in methanol but also in 2-propanol containing Halon2402 or hydrogen bromide was observed by pulse radiolysis to clarify its production mechanism and to deduce its influence in radiation degradation technique."
1,Experimental,"Halon2402 (liquid at ambient condition, >99%), hydrogen bromide (HBr) as 48% aqueous solution, and deuterium bromide (DBr) as 48% solution of D2O were supplied by Tokyo-Kasei, Sigma-Aldrich and Cambridge Isotope Lab., respectively. Dehydrated alcohols (methanol, methanol-d4, 2-propanol, and 2-propanol-d8), sodium bromide (>99.9%), and perchloric acid as 60% aqueous solution were purchased from Wako. All reagents were used as received. Sample solutions were prepared by diluting Halon2402, aqueous solution of 48% hydrogen bromide or its deuterated one, or sodium bromide together with aqueous solution of 60% perchloric acid into the alcohols. Each sample solution was individually purged with pure argon gas for more than 15 min just before pulse radiolysis measurement. Pulse radiolysis experiments were conducted at the LINAC facility at the Nuclear Professional School, the University of Tokyo. An electron beam was provided from an electron linear accelerator, energy and pulse duration of which were 35 MeV and 10 ns, respectively. The dose per pulse was ca. 70–100 Gy, which is measured by the thiocyanate dosimeter (an N2O-saturated 10 mM KSCN aqueous solution) (Buxton and Stuart, 1995). The absorbed dose was decreased down to 50 Gy, if necessary, by inserting attenuator plates of Pb at the upstream of the sample cell. Note that the absorbed dose shown here is measured for water not for the alcohols. To estimate the G-values, the absorbed dose was calculated using the density of each alcohol. The experimental apparatus has been described in previous reports (Lin et al., 2011; Hata et al., 2011; Yamashita et al., 2012, 2015). Each sample solution was puts in a quartz cell with a 1- or 2-cm optical path and irradiated at room temperature. Kinetics measurement was done at a certain wavelength and then sample solution was replaced by another one to measure at different wavelength. Fresh sample solution was used in each measurement to avoid composition change of the solution due to repetition of irradiations. Transient absorption spectra were extracted from a series of several kinetics data at different wavelengths."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Formation and decay of Br2 •− in alcohols containing Br−,"3.1 Formation and decay of Br2 •− in alcohols containing Br− Transient absorption of alcohols containing hydrogen bromide not Halon2402 was observed in order to investigate how Br2 •− is produced from Br− and decays in alcohols. Fig. 1 shows transient absorption spectra of 2-propanol containing 130 mM Br−. A weak absorption band of e− solv peaking at 780 nm was observed at 100 ns after the pulse. Other two peaks were observed at 360 and 740 nm. Both of them are attributed to Br2 •−, whose absorption coefficients in water are 9900 and 340 M−1cm−1, respectively (Hug, 1981). Kinetics at 360 nm is shown in the inset of the figure to show decay behavior of Br2 •−. The time profile obeys the second-order kinetics, showing that Br2 •− in alcohols decays mainly through a disproportionation reaction to produce Br3 − and Br− similarly to that in water. Both the yield and the decay rate of Br2 •− increased with the increase of Br− concentration. The acceleration of the decay can be understood by, so called, ionic strength effect. The rate constant of the disproportionation reaction at the limit of ionic strength of zero was determined to be 3.3 × 109 M−1s−1, which is comparable to the reported values in water; 1.9 – 2.4 × 109 M−1s−1 (Liu et al., 2002; Ross et al., 1992; D’Angelantonio et al., 1988). Figs. 2 and 3 show production kinetics of Br2 •− in 2-propanol and methanol containing a constant Br− concentration of 130 mM under condition of a constant absorbed dose of 100 Gy, respectively. Note that the absorbed dose shown here was measured for water. Amount of Br2 •− increased with the increase of Br− concentration and dose, implying that both Br− and the reactive species produced by radiolysis of alcohol are concerned with the process. One of the reaction concerned with Br− and the radiolytic reactive species would be an oxidation of Br− to Br•, which is a precursor of Br2 •−. In addition, the process in methanol continued for much longer time after the pulse (> 30 ns), though in 2-propanol, more than half of the build-up finished within the pulse (< 30 ns). Due to the finding, the species participating the process (Br− and the reactive species produced by radiolysis of alcohol) in methanol is less reactive than in 2-propanol. Effect of deuteration (replacement of hydrogen by deuterium) was also investigated. Generally speaking, in deuterated system, reaction rates are lower and the lifetimes of the reactive species are longer. Fig. 4 shows time profiles of deuterated alcohols containing DBr in comparison to those of non-deuterated alcohols containing HBr, giving two findings. First, the build-up process continued for longer time. Second, amount of Br2 •− considerably increased by deuteration. The findings indicate that the amount of Br•, a precursor of Br2 •−, increased by deuteration. Because the yields of alcohol radiolysis are not much different for non-deuterated and deuterated alcohols, it is expected that the lifetime of a reactive species produced by radiolysis of alcohol, which can oxidize Br−, becomes longer by deuteration. The longer build-up suggests that deuteration results in the decrease of reactivity and diffusion rate of the reactive species produced by radiolysis of alcohol. In alcohols containing HBr, not only Br− but also H+ is important. The Br2 •− production in methanol containing 100 mM NaBr together with perchloric acid was also investigated to estimate the effect of H+. Fig. 5 shows time profiles of acidic ([perchloric acid]: 10, 20, and 50 mM) methanol solutions containing 100 mM Br−. Obviously, there are two components in the time profiles; within and after the pulse. The former is attributed not only to Br2 •− but also e− solv. The different absorbance just after the pulse at 30 ns is due to the scavenging reaction for e− solv by H+, (more strictly, by RCHOH2 +) (Eq. (4)). Focusing on the slower build-up, the amount of Br2 •− increased with the H+ concentration while the formation rate was almost constant. The finding suggests that amount of Br•, the precursor of Br2 •−, increases with the acid concentration and that the reactions concerned with H+ are too fast to be observed. The apparent rate constant of the build-up of Br2 •− in methanol could be briefly estimated as 1.4 × 108 M−1s−1 based on the kinetic curves in the figure. The value was two order magnitude lower than the rate constant of the reaction, Br− + Br• → Br2 •−, in water; 1.2 × 1010 M−1s−1 (Liu et al., 2002)."
4,Transient species in alcohols containing Halon2402,"3.2 Transient species in alcohols containing Halon2402 Figs. 6a and 6b show transient absorption spectra of 2-propanol containing Halon2402 at concentrations of 10 and 100 mM, respectively. Three absorption bands were found in the spectra. First, a broad absorption commonly observed whose peak would be in the shorter wavelength than the observed range. Second, at the lower Halon2402 concentration, a tail of the broad absorption band of e− solv was confirmed around 400 nm, which is reasonable and explained by a slower scavenging reaction toward e− solv (Fig. 6a). Absorbance at 400 nm decreased from 0.017 in the 1st measurement to 0.008 in the 4th one. This means that the repetition of the electron pulse irradiation led to increase of the compounds having higher electron affinity like the halogenated products, acetone, proton, etc. Based on the fact that 100 ns is sufficient for 100 mM Halon2402 to scavenge all of e− solv, its rate constant can be estimated as 109 M−1s−1 or higher. Third, at the higher Halon2402 concentration, a new absorption band peaking at 360 nm, which is attributed to Br2 •−, appeared by repeating the measurement (Fig. 6b). Absorbance at the wavelength increased from 0.007 in the 1st measurement to 0.018 in the 4th one. In Fig. 6b, time profiles at the wavelength in the 1st and 4th measurements are shown in the inset, where two components clearly exist. In short, there are a faster build-up within the pulse and a slower build-up or decay after the pulse. The latter is attributed to Br2 •−, though the former is attributed not only to Br2 •− but also to other compounds whose peaks are at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. Similarly, transient absorption spectra of methanol containing 100 mM Halon2402 were also observed (Fig. 6c). The features are quite similar to those seen with 2-propanol (Fig. 6b), that is, absorbance at 360 nm increased by repeating the electron beam irradiation. Time profile at the wavelength is also shown in the inset. The slower build-up after the pulse is attributed to Br2 •−. In methanol, the build-up of Br2 •− after the pulse is slower and its amount is less than in 2-propanol. This fact indicates lower efficiency of debromonation in methanol to provide Br• and Br−, precursors of Br2 •−, which is consistent with the results reported with γ-irradiation (Nakagawa, 2015). As pointed out above, the time profiles of alcohols containing Halon2402 and HBr are quite similar, but there is a small difference in the build-up components. In the case of HBr, it took only about 80 ns in 2-propanol (Fig. 2) and 300 ns in methanol (Figs. 3 and 5) till the build-up component terminated. On the other hand, in the case of Halon2402, it took about 120 ns in 2-ptopanol (insets of Fig. 6b) and 1500 ns in methanol (inset of Fig. 6c). Such a difference suggests the species provided through the chain debromonation of Halon2402 (Eqs. 8–10), which is Br− or proton, would concern with Br2 •− production."
5,Mechanism of Br2 •− production in alcohols containing Halon2402,"3.3 Mechanism of Br2 •− production in alcohols containing Halon2402 Based on the considerations in the previous section, Br2 •− production in alcohols containing Halon2402 are summarized as follows. It initiates from debromonation of Halon2402 (Eqs. 7–10), followed by the oxidation of Br− into Br• by the reactive species produced by radiolysis of alcohol. In methanol, two pathways are reported for the oxidation; one is neutralization of Br− by a methanol radical cation, (CH3OH•+) (Feldman et al., 1986), the other is reaction with a methoxy radical (CH3O•) associated with acid (H+) (Dainton et al., 1972). In these reports, Br− concentrations were in the ranges of 0.5 – 2 M and 0.1 – 0.3 M, respectively. In the present study, the highest Br− concentration was 0.13 M and the total amount of Br2 •− increased with the H+ concentration, as shown in Fig. 5. Thus, it is indicated that Br− is oxidized through the latter pathway (Eq. (11)), while H+ is not necessitated to oxidize Br− in water (Eq. (11’)) and the rate of oxidation increases in acidic condition. (11) ( Methanol ) RCHO • + Br − ↔ RCHO − Br • − RCHOH + H + → + Br • (11’) (Water) HO• + Br− → HO-Br•− → OH− + Br• This is supported by the results obtained with deuterated alcohols. The deuteration increased Br2 •− yield as shown in Fig. 4, although it is known that deuteration does not increase the primary yield of the alcohol radical cation so much. In addition, the above mentioned discussion based on Fig. 5 has no contradiction to this. By ESR spin-trapping study in methanol, the relative yield of CD3O-adduct compared to CD2OD-adduct in deuterated methanol (methanol-d4) was higher than that in non-deuterated methanol (Nakagawa, 2016). The transform reaction from alkoxy radical to hydroxyl alkyl radical (Eq. (5)) becomes slower by deuteration because the abstraction of deuterium is slower than that of hydrogen. Thus, the lifetime of alkoxy radical becomes longer and the spin trapping of alkoxy radical, which is the competition reaction with Eq. (5), becomes more effective by deuteration. Such an effect of deuteration also increases the efficiency of the oxidation of Br− by alkoxy radical (Eq. (11)), resulting in higher production of Br• and Br2 •− as shown in Fig. 4. Because not only alkoxy radical but also hydroxyl alkyl radical are produced from the alcohol radical cation, the primary yield of alkoxy radical is lower than that of e− solv, which can be estimated as ~2.0 (100 eV)−1. This yield corresponds to the concentration of ~14 μM at 70 Gy. The yield of Br• should be lower than that of e− solv, thus the concentration of Br• must be lower than 14 μM. Such a concentration is too low for Br• to find another Br•, to become Br2, showing that it is difficult to think Br2 as the precursor of Br2 •− in this case. Finally, a reasonable mechanism of Br2 •− production from Br• is its reaction with Br− (Eq. (12)). (12) Br• + Br− → Br2 •− In alcohols containing Halon2402, Br− is provided through the chain debromonation of Halon2402 (Eqs. 8–10). As a result, the build-up component produced through Eq. (12) continued much longer than in alcohols containing HBr. The oxidation and reduction processes occurring in alcohol solutions are summarized in Scheme 1. The oxidation of Br− by alkoxy radical (Eq. (11)) competes with the transform reaction (Eq. (5)). In addition, Eq. (11) has a reverse reaction at lower H+ concentration. Thus, the yield of the hydroxyl alkyl radical increases through the transform reaction (Eq. (5)) at lower H+ concentration, resulting in effective reduction of Halon2402 (Eq. (8)). Apparent speed of Br2 •− formation in methanol was much slower than that in 2-propanol even though the rate of reaction concerned with H+ is enough fast. On the contrary, the rate of Br2 •− formation in 2-propanol decreased by deuteration, indicating the reaction concerns with the C-H bonding. In addition, the rate decreasing by deuteration was not observed in methanol. These results suggest different paths to release Br• associated with H+ (the right side of Eq. (11)). (13) ( Methanol ) CH 3 O − Br • − + H + CH fast → 3 O ( H + ) − Br • − CH slow → 3 OH + Br • (14) (2-Propanol) (CH3)2CHO-Br•− + H+ → (CH3)2CHOH + Br• In methanol, predominant path would be the H+ attachment to the lone pair of O-atom in CH3O-Br•−, which is a fast reaction and not affected by deuteration, followed by the release of Br•. Because Br• is released via the neutral intermediate following to the deformation and intra-molecular charge transfer, the rate of Br• production and the subsequent Br2 •− formation (Eq. (12)) become slower in methanol. On the contrary, the H+ attachment to O-atom in (CH3)2CHO-Br•− could be interrupted by the methyl-moieties and H+ would attack from the side of Br−. Thus, the synchronous O-H bonding and Br• release according to charge transfer would be the main path in 2-propanol. In addition, the oxidation of Br− would occur with the addition of acid. Stoichiometrically, the maximum concentration of H+ released from debromonation of Halon2402 is twice of the concentration of Halon2402, in short, 20 mM is the upper limitation of H+ released from 10 mM Halon2402. Interestingly, in the presence of 20 mM of H+, Br2 •− could be observed in methanol (Fig. 5) but not in 2-propanol (Fig. 6a), showing that this H+ concentration is sufficient in methanol but insufficient in 2-propanol to proceed the oxidation of Br−. Such difference could be explained by the redox potentials of Halon2402 and Br− in alcohols. It is necessary that the redox potential of the oxidizer is higher than that of the reducer. How easy the redox reaction occurs depends on the difference in the redox potentials between the oxidizer and the reducer. The relative variation of redox potentials for the reduction of Halon2402 by hydroxyl alkyl radical as well as for the oxidation of Br− by alkoxy radical are shown in Fig. 7. For electron transfer from the hydroxyl alkyl radical to Halon2402 (Eq. (8)), the hydroxyl alkyl radical is the reducer. The half-wave potential which is parallel to the redox potential of (CH3)2 •COH is lower than that of •CH2OH and decreases with increasing pH as shown in Fig. 7a (Asmus et al., 1966; Lilie et al., 1971; Henglein, 1976). Thus, the G value of de-halogenation in 2-propanol is larger than that in methanol and becomes larger in alkaline solutions (Sawai et al., 1978; Nakagawa, 2015). On the contrary, in the case of Eq. (11), the oxidizer is alkoxy radical and the reducer is Br−. Though the half-wave potentials of (CH3)2CHO• and CH3O• are not known, it is analogized from the case of the hydroxyl alkyl radical that the former would be lower than the latter and increase with the H+ concentration (Fig. 7b). Thus, it is reasonable that the redox potential of alkoxy radical at neutral or basic condition would not be high enough to oxidize Br− and become higher with adding H+. Though Br− is oxidized into Br• by alkoxy radical and consequently Br2 •− is produced in acidic alcohols, Br2 •− is formed from the reaction of Br− with BrOH•− in neutral water. This difference between alcohols and water can be explained by the fact that the redox potential of •OH is high enough to produce stable BrOH•− even at neutral condition. In the case of chlorinated hydrocarbons, the transient absorption at 350 nm of Cl2 •− did not appear by irradiation of the 2-propanol containing hexachloroethane, which is also degraded through chain reactions to produce chloride ion (Sawai et al., 1978) by the same mechanism as Halon2402. The redox potentials of halide anions are related with the electron affinity and that of Cl− is higher than that of Br−. In addition, the redox potential of Cl− would be much higher than that of alkoxy radical even with the presence of acid. As a result, it can be said that the oxidation of Cl− leading to production of Cl2 •− does not occur."
6,Conclusion,"Although irradiation in alcohols is an efficient way to treat toxic halogenated compounds, details of a mechanism of the radiation-induced degradation had not been clarified yet. Pulse radiolysis technique was used in this study to investigate early stages of radiation-induced reactions in alcohols (methanol and 2-propanol) containing Halon2402, and it was found that repetition of irradiation leads to accumulation of a transient species having absorption around 360 nm, which is attributed to Br2 •−. Since it is reported that the radiation-induced degradation of Halon2402 in alcohols results in production of Br− and acid (H+), thus, transient absorption of the alcohols containing Br− was studied. Influences of Br− concentration, absorbed dose, acid addition, and deuteration of the solvent alcohols were investigated, giving the following three findings. First, the deuteration resulted in significant increase in the amount of Br2 •− production, implying it is, among the radicals formed after ionization of the alcohols, alkoxy radicals not hydroxyl alkyl radicals that oxidize Br− into Br•. Second, acid was necessary in the oxidation of Br− into Br•. Third, Br2 •− is formed through the reaction between Br• and another Br−. The oxidation of Br− and the reduction of Halon2402 were discussed from the viewpoint of redox potentials of the related transient species. For the reduction of Halon2402, the redox potential of hydroxyl alkyl radical becomes lower at basic conditions than neutral or acidic conditions. Thus, basic conditions are favored in terms of efficiency of the debromonation of Halon2402. On the contrary, the redox potential of alkoxy radical increases with acid addition. This leads to easier oxidation of Br−. This oxidation of Br− by alkoxy radical competes with the transform reaction of alkoxy radical into hydroxyl alkyl radical, which induces the chain debromonation reactions. From the viewpoint of the oxidation of Br−, basic conditions is favored, too. As a conclusion, irradiation at basic conditions are recommended for the degradation of Halon2402 in order not only to increase the debromonation efficiency but also to neutralize the acid, which prevents the loss of alkoxy radical by oxidation of Br−. Difference of methanol and 2-propanol can also be explained by the redox potentials. The reduction of Halon2402 by the hydroxy alkyl radical is easier in 2-propanol than methanol while the oxidation of Br− by the alkoxy radical is more difficult in 2-propanol than methanol. Due to the difference, 2-propanol is more suitable than methanol to be used in practical treatment in the future. In addition, lower concentration of Br− is better to keep efficiency of the treatment, so in practical application it would be important to avoid accumulation of Br−."
