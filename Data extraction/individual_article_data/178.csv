0,Introduction,"The studies of the thermodynamic and transport properties of solvents at different temperatures in binary and ternary mixtures play a significant role in the chemical industry. These properties also provide useful information in understanding the types of intermolecular interactions in the liquid mixtures [1–3] and these interactions have been extensively used in the chemical, textile, leather and nuclear industries [4]. Further, the thermodynamic properties of binary mixtures help to understand the rate of reactions in the industries [5]. The information about these properties are useful in many fields of applied research and helps in many industrial, chemical and biological applications [6]. Several researchers focused on the study of thermodynamic and transport properties of non-aqueous binary liquid mixtures containing alcohols [7–10]. In this paper, we report the study of the IAA and BA components and these molecules are polar [11] and H-bonds of -OH groups could be associated with themselves in pure states [12]. The IAA is an ingredient of Kovac's reagent, used for the bacterial diagnostic indole test. It is mainly used as a solvent for surfaces and lacquer baths, inks for print, and dyes for wool as well as in the chemical production of photographic and pharmaceutical substances [13]. Further, it is also used for the composition of perfumes and the synthesis of fruit essences. The BA is an important solvent for gelatin, cellulose acetate, shellac and in pharmaceutical applications as an antimicrobial agent [14]. It is also used in the perfumery, in microscopy as embedding material, and veterinary applications for relief from purities [15]. The experimental values of thermophysical parameters such as density (ρ) and viscosity (η) of pure liquid solvents and their binary mixtures of IAA (1) + BA (2) had been measured at T = (293.15 to 318.15) K under atmospheric pressure. From these data, the V m E , V m,∅, 1, V m,∅, 2, V ¯ m , 1 , V ¯ m , 2 , V ¯ m , 1 E , V ¯ m , 2 E and ∆η values were counted. The 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra study was performed to explain the interactions between IAA and BA through the hydrogen bonding. At the same time, the existence of the hydrogen bonding in the above said binary system further confirmed by computational chemistry. The V m E and ∆η quantities were fitted with the R-K equation. This work provides some useful information on the design and large-scale industrial applications of the IAA (1) + BA (2) binary solutions."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Isoamyl alcohol (purity ≥99.0%) and ethanol (purity ≥99.9%) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Benzyl alcohol (purity ≥99.8%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich company. These chemicals were dried on molecular sieves type 4A before they were used. The above solvents information was given in Table 1 ."
3,Measurement,"2.2 Measurement An electronic single pan analytical balance (Dhona100DS model) with a precision of ±0.0001 g was used to weigh all the mass of test samples. 11 different concentrations of IAA (1) + BA (2) solutions were equipped freshly with an error of ±0.0003 g. The required parameters are measured on the same day and immediately after preparing each one sample. A pycnometer of 25 cm3 was used to determine the density of pure reagents and their binary mixtures. This instrument was filled with a test sample and located into a thermostatic water bath using an agitator for 30 min. The pycnometer was calibrated with double-distilled water at six equidistant temperatures of (293.15 to 318.15) K with a temperature in space of 5 K. To carry out this experiment, the procedure was repeated more than 3 times. The viscosity of different concentrations of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary mixtures was determined using an Ubbelohde viscometer (0.8–0.9 mm). This instrument with an appropriate quantity of samples was inserted in the thermostatic water bath for 30 min and the flow time of the solution was measured by digital stopwatch, in which every data was taken from the average of 10 sets of data with the error of ±0.03 s. The viscometer was calibrated by using chromatographic grade ethanol and redistilled water before each temperature measurement, respectively. A thermostatic water bath was used to maintain required temperature stability within ±0.01 K (INSREF model; IRI-016C, India). 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra of pure components and their equimolar mole fraction samples were determined by using a 500 MHz Bruker Advance III spectrometer (deuterium reagent CDCl3 was used) and a Nicolet (Nexus 670) FT-IR spectrometer (4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of 1 cm−1)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Density and viscosity,"3.1 Density and viscosity The density data were calculated according to Eq. (1) [16]: (1) ρ = m V where m is the molar mass of the solution and determined by electronic analytical balance and V is the molar volume. The viscosity data of the solutions were obtained by the following Eq. (2) [17]: (2) η = ρ A t − B t here ρ and t represents the density and flow time. A and B are parameters calibrated by double-distilled water and chromatographic grade ethanol. Table 2 reports a comparison of the referential and experimental density and viscosity values of the pure solvents (IAA and BA) at six temperatures and the experimental values agree very well with the literature values. The measured density and viscosity data of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary liquid systems with the mole fraction of IAA at a temperature from 293.15 to 318.15 K were listed in Tables 3 and 4 . The results of measured values are graphically represented in Figs. 1 and 2 . From Fig. 1, it can be observed that the density values of the IAA (1) + BA (2) system decreased with the increasing temperature at a constant mole fraction, and at the same time decreased with the increasing mole fraction of IAA at various temperature. The density of the system decreased with the mole fraction of IAA due to the density of IAA was less than the density of BA under the same environments. The distance between IAA and BA molecules gradually decreases with an increase in the temperature [18]. Fig. 2 indicated that the viscosity values of the studied system decreased with the increasing composition of IAA at a particular temperature and at the same time decreased with increasing temperature at fixed mole fraction. The IAA having less viscosity compared with BA when applied the same conditions and therefore, the viscosity of the binary system decreased with the amount of IAA increasing. The molecular moving energy increases with increase in the temperature, the internal friction decreased because of the increased intermolecular flow, resulting in the reduction of viscosity."
6,Volumetric properties,"3.2 Volumetric properties 3.2.1 Excess molar volume The excess molar volume (V m E ) of binary mixtures were calculated by using Eq. (3) and experimental density data [19,20]: (3) V m E = ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i ρ m − ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i ρ i where ρ m is the density of the binary mixture, ρ i is the density of pure component, x i is the mole fraction of pure substance and M i indicates the relative molar mass of pure solvent. The obtained results of V m E were noted in Table 5 and graphically fitted in Fig. 3 . From this Fig, it can be observed that the V m E values of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary system were negative deviations from the ideal behavior at 293.15 to 318.15 K in the entire mole fraction of IAA. The values of V m E for the binary system negatively increased up to IAA mole fraction (x 1 = 0.48) and then negatively decreased with an increase in the IAA composition at a certain temperature. The minimum point at x 1 = 0.48 designated that the volume contraction of the binary solution reached the maximum. The negative excess molar volume of the binary mixture was mainly related to three possible actions namely; (i) breaking action; after mixing of IAA and BA immediately breaking of bonds (intra‑hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole bonds) in like molecules and formation of new bonds between unlike molecules [21], (ii) H-bonding (HB) action (main contribution); the intermolecular H-bonding was formed between IAA and BA molecules [22], and (iii) fitting action; The geometry of the liquid molecular structure which allow the fitting of one molecule to another molecule [23]. The IAA and BA molecular size are similar, so the V m E negative deviations from the ideality because of the formation of new H-bond and this phenomenon leads to IAA and BA molecule very close to each other, resulting in a decreased volume of the binary solution compared with individual components. Table 6 shows a comparison of the V m E present data for the IAA (1) + BA (2) mixtures with Alavianmehr et al. [24] for the binary liquid mixtures of benzyl alcohol with 1-butanol and 2-butanol and Yeh and Tu [25] for the binary solutions of benzyl alcohol with 2-propanol at temperature 298.15 K. For the system containing isoamyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol, this did not occur. The V m E values agree with the literature values but more negative values were observed under study because of benzyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol molecules strongly association through the formation of new H-bonding and additionally, relatively hydrogen bonding (π⋯⋯H) between π-electrons of the benzene ring of BA and proton of IAA may also exist [26]. This results in more negative V m E values were obtained. As shown in Fig. 3, when the mole fraction of IAA was constant, the negative V m E decreased with increasing temperature [16] and which means that intermolecular interactions (IMI) gradually decreases in unlike molecules. This phenomenon recommends that, with an increase in temperature, the molecules gain sufficient energy to move away from each other and therefore the formation of new H-bonds capability was less at higher temperature i.e. volume was increased, resulting in the system move to the ideal axis with rising temperature. The order of the IMI of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary solution at different temperatures: IMI 293.15 K > IMI 298.15 K > IMI 303.15 K > IMI 308.15 K > IMI 313.15 K > IMI 318.15 K The studied system shows more non-ideal behavior at 293.15 K temperature. 3.2.2 Apparent molar volumes According to Eqs. (4) and (5), the apparent molar volumes (V m, ∅, 1 and V m, ∅, 2) of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary system were calculated [27,28]: (4) V m , ∅ , 1 = x 2 M 2 x 1 × ρ 2 − ρ m ρ 2 ρ m + M 1 ρ m (5) V m , ∅ , 2 = x 1 M 1 x 2 × ρ 1 − ρ m ρ 1 ρ m + M 2 ρ m where x 1, x 2, M 1, and M 2 represents the mole fraction and relative molecular mass of pure IAA and pure BA, respectively. The apparent molar volumes (V m, ∅, 1 and V m, ∅, 2) values were registered in Table 7 . A close perusal of Table 7 showed that the V m, ∅, 1 and V m, ∅, 2 values were positive and increased with increasing temperature for the binary system, which indicates that the total structural order was greater, in resulting weak intermolecular interactions occur in IAA and BA molecules at higher temperature [29]. At a certain temperature, the V m, ∅, 1 value increased, at the same time V m, ∅, 2value decreased with increasing concentration of IAA. 3.2.3 Partial molar volumes The partial molar volumes of IAA (1) + BA (2) binary mixtures were determined by via following relations [30,31]: (6) V ¯ m , 1 = V m E + V m , 1 ∗ + 1 − x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P (7) V ¯ m , 2 = V m E + V m , 2 ∗ − x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P where V m, 1 ∗ and V m, 2 ∗ indicates the molar volumes of pure components. The ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P derivative in Eqs. (6) and (7) was found by differentiation of R-K Eq. (13), which leads to the following Eqs. (8) and (9) for V ¯ m , 1 and V ¯ m , 2 [32]: (8) V ¯ m , 1 = V m , 1 ∗ + 1 − x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i 1 − 2 x i i − 2 x 1 1 − x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i i 1 − 2 x 1 i − 1 (9) V ¯ m , 2 = V m , 2 ∗ + 1 − x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i 1 − 2 x i i + 2 x 1 2 1 − x 1 ∑ i = 0 n A i i 1 − 2 x 1 i − 1 Therefore, from the above mentioned Eqs, the partial molar volumes ( V ¯ m , 1 and V ¯ m , 2 ) data for the system were predictable and were reported in Table 8 . The V ¯ m , 1 and V ¯ m , 2 values were positive and increased with the increasing temperature at the concentration of IAA was same. However, the V ¯ m , 1 value increased and the V ¯ m , 2 value decreased with the increasing mole fraction of IAA at a certain temperature. 3.2.4 Excess partial molar volumes The excess partial molar volumes V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E of IAA and BA were assessed by Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively [33,34]: (10) V ¯ m , 1 E = V ¯ m , 1 − V m , 1 ∗ (11) V ¯ m , 2 E = V ¯ m , 2 − V m , 2 ∗ The eventual values of excess partial molar volumes ( V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E ) were presented in Table 9 . In general, the negative V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E of values designated the presence of strong intermolecular interactions such as H-bond, molecules fitting, complex formation interactions in dissimilar molecules [35]. The negative V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E values were observed for the studied binary system indicated that strong intermolecular interactions (H-bond) formed between IAA and BA than those between like molecules."
7,Viscosity deviation,"3.3 Viscosity deviation The viscosity deviation data were calculated by using Eq. (12) [36]: (12) ∆ η = η m − ∑ i = 1 2 x i η i here η i and η m indicate the viscosity of pure solvents and binary solutions, respectively. The obtained viscosity deviation (∆η) data was located in Table 10 and depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of mole fraction of IAA at various temperatures. As showed in Fig. 4, ∆η values were positive and at a particular temperature, ∆η firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing concentration of IAA. When the mole fraction of IAA was constant, the values of Δη were systematically decreased with the increasing temperature and which suggested that IMI gradually decreased between IAA and BA molecules i.e. the thickness of mixture decreasing, and which means that the solution flows better at a higher temperature. For investigated binary system, the co-relation among IMI, HB, the thickness of mixture (TM) and temperature (T): IMI, HB and TM were inversely proportional to T due to the increased in the mobility of the molecules in the mixture with a rise in the temperature, resulting in weak interactions (H-bond) occur in unlike molecules. The order of the solution flow (SF) of binary system at different temperatures: [SF]293.15 K < [SF]298.15 K < [SF]303.15 K < [SF]308.15 K < [SF]313.15 K < [SF]318.15 K."
8,Correlation of the Vm E and Δη values,"3.4 Correlation of the Vm E and Δη values The values of V m E and Δη can be correlated by using R-K Eq. (13) [37]: (13) z cal = x 1 x 2 ∑ i = 0 4 A i 2 x i − 1 i where Z represents V m E and Δη are fitting functions, A i is the coefficient of the fitted equation. The standard deviation (σ) between theoretical and experimental values were computed using the following relation [38]: (14) σ Z = ∑ Z exptl − Z calcd 2 / p − n 1 2 where p is the number of experimental data points and n is the number of parameters. The calculated parameter (A i ) values along with the standard deviations were listed in Table 11 at six temperatures."
9,Spectral properties,"3.5 Spectral properties 3.5.1 1H NMR The proton-NMR spectra of IAA (1) + BA (2) liquid mixture with 0%, 50% and 100% mole fraction of IAA were exposed in Fig. 5 . In the 1H NMR of pure IAA, the chemical shift values of proton in various groups were appeared at δ = 2.49 ppm (H atom of -OH group), δ = 3.62 ppm (-CH2-O-), δ = 1.69 ppm (-CH2-), δ = 1.42 ppm (-CH-) and δ = 0.87 ppm (-CH3). Meanwhile, the 1H NMR spectra of pure BA, chemical shift (δ) of ortho hydrogen was at 6.79 ppm (2H), para hydrogen had δ = 6.90 ppm (2H), meta hydrogen appeared at δ = 7.31 (4H), δ = 3.64 ppm (2H) came from the hydrogen on -CH2 – and δ = 2.43 ppm (H) was due to hydroxyl hydrogen in benzyl alcohol. When IAA and BA are mixed with IAA concentration of 50%, as shown in Fig. 5, it is clear that the chemical shift value of the H atom of the alcoholic group is moved to 3.30 ppm. This process due to the H atom of -OH in IAA formed a new HB with the O atom of -OH in BA and vice-versa, which could be due to the lessening of the density of electron clouds around the alcoholic H-nucleus [39]. 3.5.2 FT-IR spectra Fig. 6 shows the FT-IR spectra of pure reagents and 50% concentration of IAA. The IAA and BA showed the strong and wide-ranging absorption peaks were at 3323 and 3328 cm−1, which due to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group [40]. When the IAA composition was 50%, the –OH stretching frequency was changed to 3315 cm−1 because of a new HB formation between IAA and BA molecules. The decrease in absorption peak of -OH and broadening of the band when the mixing of IAA with BA due to the weakening of bond strength (-O-H) and leading to specific interactions through new HB between the dissimilar molecules."
10,Computational chemistry,"3.6 Computational chemistry Using Gaussian 09 program [41], optimized structure parameters (bond lengths and bond angles), interaction energy and stabilization energy (NBO analysis) were obtained. The geometrical structures were optimized by using DFT with the popular hybrid method (B3LYP) [42] with a 6-311++G (d, p) basis set for all atoms. 3.6.1 Geometrical structure To explore the intermolecular HB interactions in the most stable structure associations such as isoamyl alcohol⋯⋯benzyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol⋯⋯isoamyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol⋯⋯benzyl alcohol was shown in Figs. 7–10 . The optimized structure parameters (bond lengths and bond angles) of the molecules were listed in Table 12 . Figs. 7 and 8 were displayed that cross-associations through HB interaction in unlike molecules. Figs. 9 and 10 were showed that HB interaction in similar molecules i.e. self-associations. Based on Table 12, the H-bond length for the four pairs of associations follows; IAA − O 17 − H 18 ⋯ ⋯ O 33 − BA 1.69514 A 0 < BA − O 33 − H 34 ⋯ ⋯ O 17 − IAA 1.74874 A 0 < IAA − O 35 − H 36 ⋯ ⋯ O 17 − IAA 1.75975 A 0 < BA − O 15 − H 16 ⋯ ⋯ O 31 − BA 1.8139 7A 0 And also, the ∆R(H┄Y) values as follows; associations: I > II > III > IV. From the above two orders, it can be understood that (IAA)-O17-H18⋯⋯O33-(BA) complex contained the short distance H-bond length and large ∆R(H┄Y) values and which indicates -O-H⋯⋯O- hydrogen bond in association-I was strongest H-bond among all associations. The ∆R(H┄Y) value represents the strength of the H-bond [43]. 3.6.2 Interaction energy The interaction energy between particles (atoms, molecules and ions) A and B were calculated by using Eq. (15) [44,45]: (15) ∆ E int AB = E AB AB AB − E A A + E B B where E AB AB is the energy of complex AB, E A A and E B B are the energy of components A and B. By using interaction energy, the stability of the H-bonded complexes was studied. The ∆E int was given in Table 13 . Based on this Table, we see that the interaction energy between molecules in four associations as follows; I O 17 − H 18 ⋯ ⋯ O 33 > II O 33 − H 34 ⋯ ⋯ O 17 > III O 35 − H 36 ⋯ ⋯ O 17 > IV O 15 − H 16 ⋯ ⋯ O 31 Among the four associated H-bonded complexes the highest interaction energy was noticed in complex-I and this indicates that more stability H-bonded complex formed compared with other complexes. The geometrical structures and interaction energies were followed a similar trend. 3.6.3 NBO analysis Generally, the nitrogen/oxygen/chlorine/fluorine atom with a lone pair acts as the good donor and X−H (X = O, N) as the best acceptor and charge transfer interaction (H-bond) formed between donor and accepter. The NBO analysis is further to study the relative strength of all H-bonded associations. According to second-order perturbation theory, the stabilization energies (E (2)) of IMI of all complexes were performed and tabulated in Table 14 . Based on this Table, the stabilization energy as follows: I > II > III > IV. The association-I was more stabilized energy due to the shorter the formation of new H-bond length (O17-H18⋯⋯O33) was observed [46]."
11,Conclusions,"This study reported the density and viscosity data for the IAA (1) + BA (2) binary system over the whole composition range for T = (293.15 to 318.15) K with 5 K intervals under atmospheric pressure. Based on these data, the excess molar volume (V m E ) and viscosity deviation (∆η) were calculated and correlated to the R-K model. The calculated V m E values were negative, the ∆η values were positive, and V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E values were negative at each component and temperatures. The lower V m E values of the binary liquid mixture and negative deviations were due to the formation of new chemical species between IAA and BA molecules through the strong intermolecular H-bonding. Further, the formation of new hydrogen bonds was confirmed by spectroscopic and DFT studies."
