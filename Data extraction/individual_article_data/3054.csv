0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas has been considered as a promising candidate to replace methane, which is usually produced through anaerobic digestion of various wastes. Compared with the chemical processes for H2 production, biological H2 production by fermentative process can be operated at ambient temperatures and normal pressures [1]. Furthermore, this process can reuse large amount of various waste materials from industries and agriculture. Biological H2 production facilitates both waste materials treatment and energy recovery [2]. In the H2-generating process from organic wastes, H2, CO2, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and sometimes alcohols, are simultaneously produced [1]. Hydrogen fermentation is a very complex process and is greatly influenced by many factors. These factors include temperature, pH, substrate concentration, carbon/nitrogen ratio, toxic substrates, etc [3–5]. Previous studies have demonstrated that temperature, pH and substrate are important factors controlling biological H2 production [6,7]. However, most of previous studies were conducted to evaluate effects of one or two factors on H2 fermentation. Since biological H2 production is influenced by two and more factors simultaneously, the conventional “change-one-factor-at-a-time” method is not appropriate for multifactor experiment design. Response surface methodology (RSM) is collection of mathematical and statistical techniques useful for designing experiments, building models, evaluating relative significance of several independent variables, and determining optimum conditions for desirable responses [8]. The RSM has been used to optimize the wastewater treatment process such as anaerobic acidogenesis [9]. This study was conducted to explore the effect of temperature, pH and substrate concentration on anaerobic H2 fermentation by using RSM, and try to find the optimum conditions for maximizing H2 yield."
1,Experimental methods,"A non-defined culture used in this study was enriched from anaerobic sludge, which originally came from a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating citric acid-producing wastewater. This reactor has a treatment capacity of 3000m3 d−1 and a working volume of 2000m3. It has been operated at pH 6.8 and temperature of 35°C for over ten years. Prior to use, the seed sludge was first washed five times with tap water, and was then sieved to remove stone, sand and other coarse matters. Thereafter, the seed sludge was heated at 102°C for 90min to inactive hydrogentrophic methanogens and to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria [10]. A medium with glucose as carbon source was adopted for H2-producing bacteria growth, and the balanced nutrient was dosed as follows (gL−1): Peptone 4.0; Beef extract 3.0; Yeast extract 2.0; l-cysteine·HCl·H2O 0.1; NaCl 5; KH2PO4 1.5, and mineral salt [11]. Hydrogen production experiments were conducted in a 5-l fermentor (Baoxin Biotech Ltd., Shanghai). A 180ml of culture, harvested at the exponential phase at 39°C and 150rpm, was quickly transferred to the fermentor for each batch test. The working volume of the fermentor was adjusted to 2.0l with distilled water. Prior to operation, the fermentor was purged with nitrogen for 10min to ensure anaerobic conditions. Temperature, pH and glucose concentration in the fermentor were changed according to the experimental design. The fermentor was stirred at a constant rate of 150rpm to ensure a thorough mixing and to facilitate rapid diffusion of H2. The pH of the mixed liquor was controlled automatically by feeding NaOH (4M) and HCl (2M) solutions via respective peristaltic pumps. The amount of biogas produced was recorded using water-displacement method. The composition of biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph as described previously [7]. Glucose was measured by using anthrone–sulfuric acid method [12]. RSM with a full factorial central composite experiment design [9] was employed in this study, as shown in Table 1 . The variables were coded according to Eq. (1): (1) x i = X i − X i ∗ Δ X i where xi is the coded value of the ith test variable; Xi is the uncoded value of the ith test variable, Xi ∗ is the value of Xi at the centre point of the investigated area, and ΔXi is the step size. Temperature (X 1), pH (X 2) and glucose concentration (X 3) were chosen as three independent factors in the experimental design. The central values of experiment design were selected as temperature 40.0°C, pH 5.5 and glucose concentration 10.0gL−1, which were as close as possible to the optimum values based on our previous studies [7,13,14]. Minitab (Minitab Inc., USA) was used for data analysis."
2,Results and discussion,"Full factorial central composite design (CCD) was employed to determine the individual and interactive effects of three parameters on H2 yield. The following response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables. (2) Y = A 0 + ∑ i = 1 k A i x i + ∑ i = 1 k A i i x i 2 + ∑ i k ∑ j k A i j x i x j where xi are input variables, which influence the response variable Y; A 0 is the offset term; Ai is the ith linear coefficient; Aii is the quadratic coefficient and Aij is the ijth interaction coefficient. The three factors and five levels CCD experimental results are presented in Table 1, where the regression coefficient values, standard deviation, t exp, and significance level are given in Table 2 . It could be seen that, A 1 and A 2, as well as the quadratic coefficients A 11 and A 22 are significant at a level less than 10%. Therefore, the linear effect of temperature (A 1) and pH (A 2), and their quadratic effects (A 11 and A 22) are the most influential parameters. The significance of these quadratic effects would have been lost if the experiments were carried out using the conventional methods. In addition, the values of A 1, A 11 and A 22 were less than zero, indicating a negative effect of these parameters on hydrogen yield. However, the linear effect of pH on hydrogen yield was positive, due to the value of A 2 larger than zero. On the contrary, the interactive effects of temperature, pH and glucose concentration on hydrogen production were slight, as their interaction significance levels are very high (24.8%, 39.2% and 56.4%, respectively). Such results were different with those in other hydrogen-production studies [4,13,15,16]. For example, in one of our previous studies it was found that the linear and quadratic effects of temperature, pH and substrate concentration, as well as the interactive effects between temperature and pH, temperature and substrate concentration were highly significant, while the interactive effect between pH and substrate concentration was slight [14]. Similar results were obtained by Wang and Wan [15] for hydrogen production using the mixed bacteria, except that the interactive effect between temperature and substrate concentration was slight. Such a difference is likely to be highly related to the different hydrogen-producing cultures used in these studies. The quality of the regression, estimated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA), is shown in Table 3 . If the model is a good predictor of the experimental data the computed F-value would be higher than the tabular F-value. The ANOVA results in Table 3 demonstrate that the model ensured an accurate representation of the experimental data, as the computed F-value (14.18) is much greater than the tabular F-value (2.76) at the 5% level, for the regression term. In addition, the lower P-values for the regression in Table 3 also confirm the adequacy of the model. Then, the optimum conditions for maximizing H2 yield, calculated by setting the partial derivatives of Eq. (2) to zero with respect to the corresponding variables, were temperature 38.8°C, pH 5.7 and glucose concentration 9.7gL−1. The maximum response value for H2 yield was estimated as 1.75mol-H2 mol-glucose−1. Different cultures might result in the different optimum conditions for hydrogen production. For example, the maximum hydrogen yield for a mixed culture was obtained at temperature 38.6°C, pH 7.2 and glucose concentration 23.9gL−1 [15]. However, for a pure culture Clostridium tyrobutyricum JM1, the optimum conditions for hydrogen production were: temperature 35°C, pH 6.5 and glucose concentration 18.4gL−1 [16]. The three-dimensional response surfaces and two-dimensional contour lines to estimate H2 yield over independent variables are shown in Figs. 1–3 . These figures depict the relative effects of two variables on the H2 yield when the third variable was kept constant in their zero level. In Fig. 1, The H2 yield increased with the increasing temperature or pH to its peak, but then decreased with a further increase in temperature or pH. The variation of pH is relatively more important than that of temperature on H2 yield. The two-dimensional contour lines show a symmetrical mound shape with the maximum response occurring within the central contour, further demonstrating that the interactive effect of temperature and pH on H2 yield was not significant. Fig. 2 also indicates that the variation of pH remarkably affects the H2 yield, while the variation of glucose concentration is less important. As shown in Fig. 3, the variation of temperature is relatively more important than that of glucose concentration on H2 yield. Overall, the important degree of three variables on H2 yield is: pH>temperature>glucose concentration. Our results show that operational pH plays a significant role in hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobic cultures. Earlier studies from batch experiments have reported that the optimum pH for hydrogen production varied based on different substrates, e.g., pH of 6.5 for xylose [17], pH from 5.5 to 5.7 for sucrose [6,18], and a pH of 6.0 for starch [19]. In this study, the optimum pH was found to be around 5.7 and the H2 yield almost reduced to zero as the pH closed to 4. Therefore, pH control is important as high fermentation rates lead to strong acidification due to the production of organic acids. This can affect both product distribution and even cell viability. There are two temperature phases that have been commonly used for hydrogen fermentation: the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The optimum temperature for H2 production in this study was located in the mesophilic range. From economical and technological viewpoints, the mesophilic condition is preferable to the thermophilic condition."
3,Conclusions,"Response surface methodology, including experimental design, model building and regression analysis, was successfully applied to optimize biological H2 production from glucose. The maximum H2 yield of 1.75mol-H2 mol-glucose−1 was estimated at the optimum conditions of temperature 38.8°C, pH 5.7 and glucose concentration 9.7gL−1. The linear and quadratic effects of temperature and pH on H2 yield were significant, while the interactive effects of three parameters were minor. The important degree of three variables on H2 yield is: pH>temperature>glucose concentration, whereas the variation of glucose concentration is less important."
