0,Introduction,"Atomically dispersed heterogeneous metal catalysts, including supported molecular catalysts [1,2] and single-atom catalysts (SACs) [3–5], are desired in catalysis. SACs have attracted extensive research interest since the pioneering reports by Lee and co-workers in 2007 [6] and by Liu, Li, Zhang, and co-workers in 2011 [4], which not only maximized the utilization of metal, but also resulted in unique catalysis as size of the active sites was down to atomic scale [7]. MeNC catalysts are a class of SACs in which transition-metal atoms (typically Fe, Co, and Ni) are stabilized in a carbon lattice by surrounding nitrogen atoms. They were first derived from metallomacrocyclic complexes and studied as electrocatalysts [8–10]. So far, various approaches have been proposed to synthesize high- performance MeNC electrocatalysts [11–13]. Beller and co-workers synthesized FeNC and CoNC catalysts by the pyrolysis of metal acetates and nitrogenous ligands with carbon black as support and pioneered their applications in organic synthesis [14–21]. In the early contributions, the roles of MeNC and metal/metal oxide have not been well distinguished, which puzzled the understanding of catalysis over MeNC SACs. By applying a post-acid-washing strategy, Zhang et al. [22] and our group [23] identified CoNC, but not cobalt particles, as the active sites for oxidative CC coupling and oxidative esterification of alcohols, respectively. To date, several configurations of MeNC active sites for organic synthesis have been discriminated by integrating advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations, such as FeN4 for H2O2 oxidation of benzene [24], CoN4 C8 for hydrogenation of nitroarenes [25], and distorted (NiN4)‧‧‧N for hydrogenation of cellulose [26]. Upon these SACs, very high activity and durability under harsh conditions have been observed. The aerobic oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes or ketones is important for the manufacture of drugs, fine chemicals, and fragrances. We have demonstrated that CoNC was the active site for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to esters in methanol [18,23]. Davis and co-workers [27] have investigated the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) on MeNC (Me = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) SACs in the aqueous phase and found that the activity of CoNC approached that of Pt/C [28]. Despite these promising results, it is still vague how MeNC SACs are involved in the activation of oxygen and the formation of products. It is widely accepted that the aerobic oxidation of alcohols undergoes a stepwise mechanism on noble metal catalysts: namely the insertion of metal within the OH bond, β-hydride elimination (usually rate-determining), and the regeneration of active sites by oxygen [29,30]. In this mechanism, metal particles can concurrently activate oxygen and alcohols [31,32]. In the case of nonprecious transition metal oxide catalysts, the Mars–van Krevelen (M−vK) mechanism is usually cited to elucidate the oxidation of alcohols, where an adjacent site allowing for the transfer of lattice oxygen is prerequisite [29]. For MeNC SACs, a fundamental issue is how to rationalize the multimolecular transformation for organic synthesis on a single metal atom, which is important for designing SACs and broadening their applications. It also should be noted that the elementary reactions may be complicated in the presence of solvent and other moieties in the liquid phase. Regardless of the common poisons, such as halogen anions [33], H2S [34], and SCN− [35], MeNC SACs are easily deactivated by products/intermediates, such as benzoic acid in the case of BA oxidation [28]. Chung et al. [9] found that bare FeN4 tends to bind with OH in water, which would hinder oxygen adsorption and activation on the bulk-hosted FeN4 sites during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For the oxidation of BA over CoNC, Li et al. [36] reported much higher activity in dimethyl formamide than in water, acetonitrile, or toluene, implying the significant influence of the solvent on the SACs. Hitherto, knowledge of the molecular picture depicting the complicated interplay between reactants/solvents and the assembly composed of the metal and coordinated atoms from the support has still been lacking. Here, we present a facile synthesis of a highly active CoNC SAC on planar graphite sheets for the selective aerobic oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde (BDH), using glucose, NH4Cl, and Co(NO3)2·6H2O as feedstocks. The formation of SAC was ascertained by aberration-corrected transmission electronic microscopy and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). A systematic kinetics and density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that high activity would be achieved at a medium concentration of BA and oxygen pressure. Competitive adsorption of BA and oxygen was observed, emphasizing the significance of balanced adsorption and activation of two reactants on SACs."
1,Experimental and Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Co(NO3)2·6H2O from Tanjin Kermel, glucose from Tanjin DAMAO, and NH4Cl from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory were used without further purification. BA was from Tanjin Kermel and other substrates were from Energy Chemical. Co2O3, Co3O4, CoO, and cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPC) were purchased from Aladdin. The synthesis of cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (Co/TPP) is described in the Supporting Information."
3,Preparation of CoNC SACs,"2.2 Preparation of CoNC SACs The CoNC catalysts were prepared as follows. First, 5 g of glucose, 10 g of NH4Cl, and 5 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 50 ml of water. Then the solution was stewed in an oven at 180 °C for 12 h to dehydrate glucose slowly [37]. After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was collected and ground. The obtained powder, denoted as CoNC, was heated to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 4.5 °C min−1 and kept for 2 h in Ar. For comparison, NC was prepared in a similar way without Co(NO3)2·6H2O. Next, the CoNC was thoroughly washed with 6 M hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 6 h and then was filtered and washed with DI water several times. After being dried at 60 °C overnight, the obtained powder was denoted as CoNC-H. Then the CoNC-H was annealed at 500–900 °C for 2 h under Ar. The resulting sample was denoted as CoNC-H-T, where T represents the annealing temperature. Next, the CoNC-H-T was treated by pickling again, denoted as CoNC-H-T-H. If it was annealed again, the sample was denoted as CoNC-[H-T]2. The synthesis offers a high yield of carbon, up to 65%. Typically, 1.3 g CoNC-H-800 can be obtained in one synthesis, allowing facile mass production."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas (S BET) were measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K in an ASAP 2010 analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in a Kratos Axis ultra (DLD) spectrometer equipped with an AlKα X-ray source. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. Spectrum decomposition was performed using the XPS PEAK 41 program with Lorentzian–Gaussian (L/G = 20%) functions after subtraction of a Shirley background. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope. Spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) images were recorded using a FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 microscope. Elemental analysis was conducted using a Vario EL III (Elementar, Germany). The content of Co was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (Hitachi Z-5000)."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a PXF-6 parallel reactor (Xi’an Taikang Co.) consisting of six 15-ml parallel tubes with condensers. Typically, 2 mmol of BA, 10 ml of n-heptane, and 50 mg of catalyst were added into the reactor. After being purged with O2, the suspension was heated to 90 °C. Then O2 (1.1 atm) was fed into the reactor with stirring at 1500 rpm (defining t = 0) to initiate the reaction. After a certain reaction time, liquid products mixed with catalysts were transferred from the reactor and then catalysts were filtered. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography to calculate the conversion and selectivity. The reaction was also carried out in a 50-ml stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon with stirring at 1000 rpm to study the kinetics. To study the solvent poisoning effect, the catalyst was added into 6-M HCl, NaCl, and KCl and 3-M H2SO4 aqueous solutions and different organic solvents with stirring for 6 h. Then it was dried overnight at 100 °C in Ar. For the recyclability test, the catalyst was filtered and washed with ethanol several times after reaction and dried at 60 °C overnight. Prior to the next reaction, the catalyst was regenerated for 3 h in 50% H2 at 250 °C."
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations All geometry calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program [38] in liquid media. The self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method based on the universal solvation model SMD [39] was adopted to evaluate the effect of n-octane instead of n-heptane, the solvent in the experiment, because n-heptane was not found on Gaussian's list. Considering the close physicochemical properties and dielectric constant of n-octane (ε = 1.94) to those of n-heptane (ε = 1.92), it is suitable to select n-octane as solvent for the calculation, rather than simply changing the ε value, which will not define a new solvent properly. For the catalytic reaction, the dispersion-corrected density functional DFT-D3(BJ) method [40,41], B3LYP-D3(BJ), with the 6-31+G(d, p) standard basis set for C, H, O, and N atoms and Lanl2tz basis set and the corresponding effective core potential (ECP) for the Co atom, were adopted to simulate the reaction mechanism. The natural charges and dominant occupancies of natural bond orbitals were analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis [42,43]. Unless otherwise mentioned, the Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG) is relative to the initial reactants obtained at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31+G(d, p)(SMD, n-octane), Lanl2tz level by frequency analyses in n-octane solution at experimental temperature (363 K)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis of CoNC single-atom catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis of CoNC single-atom catalysts As a widely accepted scenario for the construction of MeNC sites, well-defined coordination between metal ions and nitrogenous ligands is desired to generate the MeN x assembly, as typically represented by 1,10-phenanthroline in the pyrolysis method [25] and nitrogen-containing linkers in MOFs [12,44]. In this work, a facile method was adopted to prepare CoNC SACs without employing expensive organic ligands. We attempted to fabricate CoNC starting from glucose as carbon source and the inorganic salts ammonium chloride as nitrogen source and cobalt nitrate as cobalt source. The slow dehydration of glucose at 180 °C allows good dispersion of cobalt and ammonium ions. Subsequently, carbonization at 800 °C resulted in the formation of a mixture of cobalt oxides and CoNC assemblies. After the removal of CoO x particles via thorough acid washing, graphite sheets doped with cobalt and nitrogen (CoNC-H) was obtained. As shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information, uniform cobalt particles with a diameter of about 20 nm on porous carbon materials are observed after carbonization. Acid washing removed most of the cobalt particles to leave planar carbon flakes. The HRTEM images indicated the absence of particles, while the coexistence of N and subnanometer Co was demonstrated by the corresponding energy filtration TEM images. The removal of Co/CoO x particles was also supported by the XRD analysis (Fig. S2). To exclude the potential effect of metastable Co species and surface contaminants, CoNC-H was subjected to annealing at 800 °C and washing with HCl again. As shown in Figs. S2 and S3, the annealing caused the XRD reflection of Co nanocrystals at 44.2°, indicating the reaggregation of metastable subnanometer Co atoms, which could be further removed by HCl washing. By this treatment, the effect of unstable Co sites could be minimized (Fig. S4). Fig. 1 shows HRTEM and AC-STEM images of the CoNC-H-800 catalyst. Thin graphite flakes with wrinkles were generated by this simple method, as shown in Fig. 1a. The AC-TEM image (Fig. 1b) clearly shows the decoration of Co single atoms on the flat carbon flakes, demonstrating the formation of SACs. The N dopants were revealed by the EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 1c and d). The coexistence of Co and N on the flat carbon substrate suggested the coordination of Co and N atoms in this SAC. EELS was employed to reveal the chemical nature of the CoN coordination. As depicted in Fig. 1e, a broad π* peak at ∼401 eV in the N K-edge is indicative of sp 2 bonding of N with carbon atoms [45]. The broad peak at ∼408 eV corresponds to the σ* contribution, which is a signature of nitrogen-containing pentagonal defects, that is, pyrrolic nitrogen [46]. The chemical environment of Co, that is, the valence state, can be revealed by EELS by the intensity ratio or distance of L 2 and L 3 lines through a calibration method (see the Supporting Information for the calculation) [47,48]. The dependence of the valence state of cobalt oxides, using Co2O3, Co3O4, and CoO as standard samples, on the L 3/L 2 intensity ratio was first measured (Fig. S5). As shown in Fig. 1f, the good linearity validates the L 3/L 2 intensity ratio as a descriptor of the chemical nature of cobalt compounds. The ratio of CoNC was measured and compared with two typical cobalt complexes, cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPC) and cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (Co/TPP). The L 3/L 2 ratios of CoNC are close to those of CoPC and Co/TPP. The CoNC-H is almost the same as that of CoPC. After annealing at 800 °C, the ratio increased slightly, suggesting a change of chemical environment and a reduced valence state. Compared with the L 3/L 2 intensity ratios of Co/TPP and CoPC, it can be concluded that the chemical environment of CoNC SACs may be analogous to a Co atom coordinated with four nitrogen atoms embedded in carbon lattice, namely the CoN4 structure, which has been reported by several groups [12,25,28]."
9,BA oxidation activity of CoNC,"3.2 BA oxidation activity of CoNC The catalytic activity of CoNC SAC was probed by the selective oxidation of BA. As shown in Table 1 , the as-prepared CoNC and acid-washed CoNC-H have similar catalytic performance (entries 3 and 4), though the former has tenfold higher Co content in the form of cobalt oxide, corresponding to 13.4 times higher TOF after pickling. It is reasonable to conclude that the large Co particles are inactive in this oxidation reaction, in contrast to the atomically dispersed Co species surviving from the acid washing. This result indicates the crucial role of CoNC SAC to the catalysis [23]. The activity can be further elevated by annealing at high temperatures (see Table S1 for the effect of annealing temperature). To our surprise, CoNC-H-800 displayed such prominent improvement that 39-fold enhancement of TOF was achieved. Using 100 mg of CoNC-H-800 catalyst, high selectivity can be maintained in the whole oxidation process (Fig. S6), and 93.8% BA conversion with 97% BDH selectivity can be reached within 8 h. The excellent selectivity to BDH can be further supported by the oxidation experiment of BDH, which gave very low activity (Table S2). Considering the reaggregation of metastable Co atoms as aforementioned, the CoNC-H-800 was subjected again to acid washing and annealing to guarantee the absence of Co particles. CoNC-[H-800]2 displayed BA conversion very close to that of CoNC-H-800, while the TOF was high, up to 126.2 h−1, because of the removal of inactive metastable cobalt. This is among the most active non-noble-metal catalysts for BA oxidation (see Table S3). Table 2 shows the effect of substituent groups of the aromatic alcohol on the reactivity of Co-NC-H-800. Among the substituted methyls, the ortho substituent had a remarkable negative impact on the conversion of alcohol (entry 4), due to the steric effect. Regarding the electronic effect of substitutes, compared with H, electron-withdrawing halogens reduced the selectivity for aromatic aldehyde with increasing benzyl benzoate selectivity (entries 5 and 6), while electron-donating groups enhanced the selectivity (entries 2 and 7). This indicates that the electron-donating substituent groups are beneficial for the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols. Co-NC-H-800 also exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the oxidative esterification reactions (Table S4), showing wide application prospects."
10,Kinetics and reaction mechanism,"3.3 Kinetics and reaction mechanism Kinetics experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic behavior and the activation mechanism of substrates. As shown in Fig. 2 a, at low/medium O2 partial pressures, the reaction rate increases with p O2 in reaction order of 0.5 with respect to O2. At p O2 higher than 1.2 MPa, zero order of reaction with respect to O2 was observed, indicating the saturated adsorption of oxygen species. The effects of oxygen pressure are indicative of the presence of active sites adsorbing oxygen. Quite different dependences of reaction rate on [BA] were observed. As revealed by Fig. 2a, both at low and at high p O2, a negative effect of [BA] was measured, corresponding to the apparent reaction orders of −0.3 and −0.5 with respect to BA, suggesting the competitive adsorption of oxygen and BA on the same sites over SACs. It should be noted that, despite the competitive adsorption of two substrates, we never observed a negative effect of rate on p O2, suggesting that the adsorption of BA was stronger than that of oxygen. The saturated adsorption of oxygen and the negative effect of [BA] negate the possibility of adsorption of O2 or BA as the rate-determining step, and also suggest a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. In addition, negative effects of BDH and H2O were observed (Fig. 2c and d), indicating that the products may be adsorbed on the active sites and inhibit the activity. DFT calculations were carried out to verify the competitive adsorption of BA and O2 over CoNC SACs. According to the preceding characterization results, the CoN4 structure was applied for the calculation, which is the most widely cited model for CoNC SACs [49,50]. As depicted in Fig. 3 a, dioxygen is molecularly adsorbed on the cobalt atom of CoN4 to form a CoN4 O2 complex with a complexation energy of 17.4 kJ‧mol−1. In CoN4 O2, the OO bond is elongated from 1.215 Å for free O2 to 1.293 Å, while the CoO bond length is 1.935 Å, indicating that O2 is activated. By a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, it was determined that there are 0.358e migrating from Co to O2, which may facilitate the oxidative addition of the OH bond in BA. Apart from O2, BA (Fig. 3b) and BDH (Fig. S13a) can also be adsorbed on the CoN4. However, the CoN4–BA complex is more stable than CoN4 O2 according to their adsorption free energies (−28.4 vs. −17.4 kJ‧mol−1), as shown in Fig. 3e. This result validates the competitive adsorption between O2 and BA revealed by our kinetics experiments. On the other hand, strong BA adsorption may block the access of O2 to the active sites, evidenced by the positive adsorption free energy 5.03 kJ‧mol−1 of CoN4 BAO2. This result well rationalized the negative reaction order in BA as depicted in Fig. 2b. Nevertheless, an adsorption free energy decrease can be observed as BA adsorbs on CoN4 O2 (from −17.4 to −18.56 kJ‧mol−1), suggesting that the oxidation of BA involves the adsorption and activation of O2 and BA stepwise. A detailed analysis was carried out to understand the structure of CoN4 O2 BA using Multiwfn software [51]. The critical point charge density ρ in O⋯H was calculated to be 0.098e Bohr−3, corresponding to a distance of 1.774 Å. The potential energy density (V(r)) at the bond critical point (BCP) is −0.028 Hartree; therefore, the hydrogen bond energy could be evaluated as E HB = −36.5 kJ‧mol−1. It is reasonable to consider that the hydrogen bond interaction contributes to the stabilization of BA. More importantly, a strong π–π stacking interaction is observable between BA and the graphene sheet around CoN4 [51,52], with a distance of ∼3.604 Å. It is demonstrated that the π–π stacking interaction plays an important role in BA oxidation with aliphatic alcohols as substrates. Compared with BA, cyclohexanol and n-heptanol displayed much lower activity (Table S5, and see Figs. S9–S13 for more DFT calculations). Such strong π–π stacking interaction indicates that carbon around the Co atom may adsorb substrates as the second active site. In addition, the positive adsorption free energy 15.11 kJ·mol−1 of CoN4 O2 BDH indicates that the product tends to desorb from the catalyst, leading to the excellent selectivity of BDH (see Figs. S9–S15 for more information). A plausible reaction mechanism can be proposed based on the kinetics and DFT results to interpret the aerobic oxidation of BA over CoNC SACs. We assumed that the catalytic cycle was completed at an isolated CoNC site, which ruled out the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving two CoNC sites in an elementary step, because the Co content (0.38%, Table S6) on planar graphite sheets was too low to enable surface reaction between substrates on two adjacent CoNC sites (Fig. 1b; also see the Supporting Information for a rough estimate of the mean distance). Considering the stepwise mechanism [29,30], if the reaction starts with the adsorption of BA followed by dehydrogenation and the regeneration of active sites by oxygen, as proposed in the cases of Pd and Au catalysts, the reaction rate will always be zero-order with respect to oxygen [53], inconsistent with our kinetics study. The DFT results suggested that the formation of CoN4 BA would hinder the subsequent adsorption of O2. Hence, the formation of CoO through activation of oxygen may be prerequisite. Meanwhile, adjacent carbon atoms on the graphite sheet may act as the site for BA adsorption via π–π interaction. Based on those results, we proposed a dual-site L-H model as follows to interpret the kinetics over CoNC SACs: (1) O 2 ⇌ O 2 a q , (2) O 2 a q + σ 1 ⇌ σ 1 O 2 , (3) B A + σ 2 ⇌ σ 2 B A , (4) σ 1 O 2 + σ 2 B A → σ 2 B D H + σ 1 O + H 2 O , (5) σ 1 O + σ 2 B A → σ 2 B D H + σ 1 H 2 O , (6) σ 2 B D H ⇌ B D H + σ 2 , (7) σ 1 H 2 O ⇌ H 2 O + σ 1 , (8) B A + σ 1 ⇌ σ 1 B A , (9) B D H + σ 1 ⇌ σ 1 B D H . Eq. (1) depicts the dissolution equilibrium of O2 in solvent. Eqs. (2) and (3) depict the adsorption of O2 and BA, in which σ1 and σ2 represent the Co site and the CN support around Co, respectively. Eq. (4) describes the surface reaction between σ1 O2 and σ2 BA to generate BDH and leave an atomic oxygen at the Co site (σ1 O). The DFT calculation shows that the σ1 O site is thermodynamically unstable because of its positive formation free energy, even after being combined with a BA (Fig. 3e). It will be transformed fast by subsequent oxidization with BA to produce the second BDH (Eq. (5)). Therefore, Eq. (4) is considered to be the rate-determining step. Then, Eqs. (6) and (7) depict the desorption of the products. Finally, since the adsorption of BA and BDH is stronger than that of O2 (Fig. 3e), Eqs. (8) and (9) are added to emphasize the adsorption competition on the Co site. By doing so, a reaction rate expression can be derived as follows (see the Supporting Information for the derivation): (10) r = kKK O 2 K B A P O 2 B A ( 1 + K B A B A + K B D H B D H ) ( 1 + K K O 2 P O 2 + K H 2 O H 2 O + K P 1 B A + K P 2 B D H ) . This reaction rate expression can describe the major aspects of experimental kinetics data, as shown in Fig. 2 (see Fig. S14 for the kinetics discrimination from the E-R model and the L-H model without adsorption competition)."
11,Implications for the catalysis of CoNC single-atom catalysts,"3.4 Implications for the catalysis of CoNC single-atom catalysts Our results emphasize the strong adsorption of BA reactant on CoNC. Despite its necessity to further catalytic transformation, it actually results in low activity at high BA concentrations. This unique “self-poisoning” effect requires more careful design of surface reaction and adsorption to reach optimal catalytic performance of SACs. From this insight, some important implications for understanding SACs can be deduced. First, the strong adsorption of reactant BA implies that the interplay between SACs and molecules may be overlooked. In the case of the liquid phase reaction, the solvent effect deserves to be investigated. Fig. 4 a shows the effect of exposing CoNC SACs to various aqueous salt solutions on the activity. To our surprise, simply soaking the CoNC-H-800 catalyst with water reduced the conversion in n-heptane by almost half. More serious deactivation was observed from exposure to solutions containing chlorides and acids, since Cl− would block CoN4 sites [33] and H+ would protonate N [54]. Taking into account the extensive usage of MeNC catalysts for electrocatalysis, such as the ORR [11] and CO2RR [55], more attention should be paid to the potential effects of aqueous electrolytes. Similarly, pre-exposure to organic solvents had negative effects on the BA conversion, as shown in Fig. 4b. In general, the solvent with higher polarity reduced the activity more remarkably—for example, methanol and acetonitrile—while nonpolar solvents such as n-heptane can prevent adsorption on CoNC, which is suitable for BA oxidation. In addition, neither halogen ions nor polar solvents affect the selectivity significantly, indicating that poisons mainly block the Co site rather than inducing structural/electronic perturbation of Co sites. Analogously, Aravind et al. have reported CO poisoning effects on FeNC for ORR, in which CO reduced the catalytic activity without altering the reaction pathway [56]. This can be explained simply by considering the isolation of single-atom Co sites. Once the Co site bonds to a poison, it will lose activity, but its structural/electronic change will not affect others. Therefore, there is no significant change in selectivity. These results undoubtedly indicate that the catalytic activity can be profoundly affected by the strong adsorption of polar moieties. In this work, more experiments were carried out to understand the effect of water, as an example. Dodelet and co-workers [57] have observed a similar effect of water, that is, water flooding effect, for Fe/N/C as an ORR electrocatalyst, where water blocked the micropores and caused O2 mass transfer resistance. We dried the catalysts after soaking them under harsh conditions to remove solvents in micropores (Table S7). After degasification, the ratio of micropore surface areas was the same, indicating that the solvent in the micropores had been removed completely. However, it cannot regenerate the catalyst, suggesting that the deactivation was not caused by the flooding effect. Furthermore, an increase of activation energy by about 11 kJ‧mol−1 was observed for CoNC-H-800-H2O (Fig. S15), implying that the strong interaction between H2O and CoNC altered the structure of active sites. (For simplicity, [O2] is considered as constant because the solubility of O2 in n-heptane has very weak dependence on temperature [58].) Fig. 5 compares the Co2p 3/2 XPS spectra of CoNC-H-800 with and without exposure to water, exhibiting the presence of Co2+ (779.5 eV) and Co3+ (781.6 eV), accompanied by a shake-up satellite of Co2+ (785.0 eV) [23]. The binding energy of Co2+, usually assigned as CoN species in CoNC SACs [25,28], showed a significant downshift toward low energy by 0.9 eV. Although the precise structure of CoNC sites exposed to water is unclear yet, it is unambiguous that soaking in water can change the CoNC SACs. According to the FeN4 OH model proposed by P. Zelenay [9], OH would probably bond with Co as ligand in water. Once the Co site was occupied, it would be difficult for O2 to be adsorbed and activated, resulting in higher activation energy and lower catalytic activity. These results can also explain the effect of annealing temperature on catalytic activity, as shown in Table 1. Despite facilitating the formation of CoNC SACs, annealing at 800 °C may remove the adsorbates on the surface of SACs to maximize the activity (Table S8). Another important issue is whether self-poisoning deactivates the SAC and hampers recyclability. As shown in Fig. S16, we indeed observed a continuous decline of BA conversion by 43.5% during the four cycles. These results are indicative of the adsorption of reactants or products on CoNC SACs, which blocked the active sites. Xie et al. [28] have found that H2 treatment can remove CoO bonds effectively. Here, H2 treatment of CoNC SACs at 250 °C was carried out before the next run of the BA oxidation. By doing so, as shown in Fig. 6 , the catalyst can be recycled five times without noticeable loss of activity, indicating that the CoNC structure is stable but the regeneration procedure has to be carried out carefully to guarantee a clean surface of CoNC SACs."
12,Conclusions,"CoNC, a single-atom catalyst composed of isolated cobalt atoms coordinated by nitrogen on planar graphene sheets, can be synthesized from inexpensive raw materials by a facile one-pot method. It displayed a high catalytic activity approaching that of noble metal catalysts for aerobic BA oxidation to BDH in n-heptane. A L-H model involving Co sites adsorbing O2 and adjacent carbon sites adsorbing BA was proposed to interpret the experimental kinetics data and DFT results. Strong competitive adsorption of BA to O2 on the Co site was revealed, which resulted in a unique “self-poisoning” effect of BA on the reactivity, namely a decline of activity with increasing BA concentration. Our results suggested that the CoNC SAC may be susceptible to the polar molecules in these circumstances. This was demonstrated by significant deactivation after exposure to polar organic solvents and aqueous solutions. These insights into the catalytic effects of SAC for organic synthesis reactions pave the way to the rational design of MeNC catalysts, especially for applications to reactions involving multiple substrates."
