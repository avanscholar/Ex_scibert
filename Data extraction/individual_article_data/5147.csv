0,Introduction,"Inspite of striking advantages, one of the main challenges encountered with dark-fermentative hydrogen (H2) production process is the treatment of resulting acid-rich effluents with residual carbon source despite low substrate conversion efficiency (Srikanth et al., 2009, Venkata Mohan, 2010). Volatile fatty acids (VFA) are soluble acid metabolic intermediates formed along with H2 production during acidogenic fermentation (Venkata Mohan et al., 2007, 2008a). VFA present in these effluents can be further transformed to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) or can be used for biohydrogenation of fatty acids into alcohols. PHA is a group of biologically derived biopolyester of hydroxyalkanoates that accumulate as carbon/energy or reducing-power storage materials in microbial cells (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht, 2004). When a carbon source is available in excess and other nutrients are growth-limiting, biopolyesters are deposited as water-insoluble cytoplasmic non-sized inclusions by Eubacteria and Archaea (Rehm, 2007). VFA under low oxygen/anoxic microenvironment gets converted to poly(β-OH)butyrate (PHB) via various biochemical routes catalyzed by the action of different enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 1). PHB synthase plays a major role in biosynthesis of PHB (Solaiman and Ashby, 2005). PHA represents a potentially sustainable replacement for fossil-fuel based conventional thermoplastics due to their biodegradability and capability to generate from renewable resources. So far, many efforts have been made to produce PHA from commercial grade substrate using pure cultures, which are expensive due to their high substrate and production costs (Tong and Chen, 2007). Compared to carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, VFA have simple structure with lower number of carbon atoms [acetate (2C), propionate (3C) and butyrate (4C)], which facilitates its easy synthesis to PHA without the requirement of glycolysis and β-oxidation pathways by using less number of metabolic reactions and enzymes. Therefore, an attempt was made in this communication to study the feasibility of using acid-rich effluents from acidogenic H2 production process as substrate for bioplastics production in the form of PHB. This integration approach makes the overall process economically viable by decreasing the cost of PHA production as well as H2 production and also by enhancing the treatment efficiency of wastewater. Experiments were performed under anoxic conditions using aerobic mixed consortia as biocatalyst and evaluated with both synthetic VFA and acidogenic effluents from bioreactor."
1,Methods,
2,PHB accumulating biocatalyst,"2.1 PHB accumulating biocatalyst Aerobic consortia from an operating activated sludge process (ASP) treating composite wastewater from domestic and industrial origin was used as biocatalyst for PHB accumulation. Prior to inoculation, the culture was washed thrice in saline buffer (5000rpm; 20°C; 10min) and enriched in designed synthetic wastewater (DSW) (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008b) under aerobic microenvironment (120rpm; 28°C) for 24h."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate In the first stage, different VFA [acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), propionic acid (HPr) and mixture of three acids (HMc)] were used as substrates (1:100 dilution with water; HAc: 4.51kg COD/m3 day; HPr: 6.09kg COD/m3 day; HBu: 7.89kg COD/m3 day; HMc: 5.86kg COD/m3 day) for studying the feasibility of PHB production. In the second stage, acid-rich effluents from biohydrogen production process [anaerobic biofilm reactor (HBR)] were used (after 24h of operation) as substrates at various organic loading rates (OLR, 2.91kg COD/m3 day (H1), 3.54kg COD/m3 day (H2), 4.58kg COD/m3 day (H3), 7.53kg COD/m3 day (H4); as obtained from reactor without diluting) after adjusting the pH to 7."
4,Biohydrogen production,"2.3 Biohydrogen production A schematic detail of the integrated experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 1 . Bench scale anaerobic biofilm reactor (HBR) which was in operation for the past 5 years in our laboratory (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008b) was used for biohydrogen (H2) production in this study. DSW with increasing glucose concentration (12g/l, 18g/l, 24g/l, and 30g/l), was fed after adjusting pH to 6 (orthophosphoric acid). HBR was operated in batch mode with a retention time of 24h at room temperature (29±2°C) with continuous re-circulation (100ml/min). The treated acid-rich effluents from HBR was collected after 24h of operation and used as a substrate for PHB production after adjusting the pH to 7."
5,PHB production,"2.4 PHB production Anoxic suspended growth batch reactor (AxSBR) with total/working volume of 250/120ml was used for PHB production. Aerobic consortia (20ml) along with 100ml HBR/VFA effluent were fed to AxSBR after adjusting the pH to 7±0.1 (2N NaOH). After feeding the bioreactor was closed with septum (butyl-rubber) to create anoxic microenvironment. Most part of the bioreactor operation was performed under anoxic condition with intermittent air sparging using air-pump (for 2min/hour operation). Initially, 72h of retention time was provided for PHB production. As maximum PHB accumulation was observed at 24h, subsequent experiments were planned accordingly with a retention time of 24h. Optimum pH for PHB production was evaluated with HBR effluent at OLR 2.91kg COD/m3 day under varying redox conditions (pH 6, 7, 8 and 9). Similar operating conditions were used for evaluating PHB production with individual and mixed VFA. AxSBR was operated at room temperature (29±2°C) in batch mode with continuous mixing (100rpm). 2.4.1 Extraction and estimation of PHB from activated sludge The biocatalyst was separated from wastewater by centrifugation (3000rpm; 30min; 10°C) and the resulting pellet was washed with acetone and ethanol to remove debris (Kumar et al., 2004). The pellet after suspended in equal volume of 4% sodium hypochlorite was incubated at room temperature for 3h. The resulting mixture was centrifuged (3000rpm; 30min; 10°C) and the pellet was washed simultaneously with acetone and ethanol. The resulting pellet was dissolved in hot chloroform and passed through glass-fiber filter (0.45μm pore size) to separate the polymer from cell debris. The chloroform filtrate was used for PHB estimation."
6,Analysis,"2.5 Analysis PHB concentration was determined colorimetrically (Law and Slepecky, 1960). PHB polymer extracted in chloroform was evaporated followed by the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid (10ml) and heated in water bath for 10min. Sulfuric acid converts the polymer in to crotonic acid. The absorbance was measured at 235nm against a sulfuric acid as blank and compared with the standard curve prepared with pure PHB [natural origin, [–COCH2CH (CH3) O–] n , Aldrich]. The chloroform–PHB extract was analyzed by FT-IR (Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670; KRS-5; spectral resolution, 4cm−1; range, 4000–400cm−1). The PHB extract (40mg) after dissolving in CDCL3 (1ml) was analyzed by 1H NMR (Bruker AM (400MHz). Sudan black B (0.3g in 70% ethyl alcohol, 1ml saffranin as counter stain) stained on biocatalyst was observed under phase contrast microscope (Nikon M 318E). Sudan black staining helps to visualize the intracellular lipid inclusion. PHB granules are stained blue to black or blue to grey, while the bacterial cytoplasm is stained as light pink (Collee et al., 1989). Microbial community of the consortia used for PHB accumulation was evaluated using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) by the procedure described elsewhere (Amann et al., 1995). Cells recovered from 5ml of sludge (7500rpm, 5min, 28°C) was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8g of NaCl, 0.2g of KCl, 1.44g of Na2HPO4 and 0.24g of K2HPO4 per liter of distilled water (DW); pH 7.4). The samples were fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde at 4°C for 12h and washed twice with PBS and suspended in PBS: ethanol (1:1) solution to store at −20°C. 10μl of the fixed sample was applied in a well of a gelatin-coated glass-side, dried (1h, 46°C) and dehydrated in solutions of 50%, 80% and 96% ethanol for 3min each. For hybridization, 9μl of hybridization buffer (5 M NaCl (18μl), 1 M Tris.Hcl (2μl), 0.5 M EDTA (100μl), 10% SDS (100μl) make up to 10ml with DW) and 1μl of fluorescent labelled probe (50ng/ml) were added to a well. The hybridization was conducted for 2h at 46°C in a humidified chamber. Following hybridization, a washing step was performed for 20min at 48°C in a washing buffer [1ml of 1M Tris-HCl and 6.3ml of 5M NaCl make up to 50ml with distilled water]. The oligonucleotide probes (MWG–Biotech AG) used in this study were Pseudomonas (PB-00375), 5′-GCT GGC CTA ACC TTC-3′, Bacillus (BMY-0843), 5′-CTT CAG CAC TCA GGT TCG-3′, Acidobacteria (PB-00190), 5′-GGT CCA GGA TGC CGC CTT-3′, Sulfur reducing bacteria (PB-01333), 5′-GTT GCC AGG CAC CCC CAT-3′ and Acetate denitrifying bacteria (PB-01300), 5′-CGA CAT GGG CGC GTT CCG -3′. All the probes were labeled with 5′-CY3 modification. FISH images were captured using fluorescent microscope (Nikon M 318E). Microprocessor based sensor (ATMI GmbH Inc.) was used to estimate the produced H2 gas. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), VFA, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were analyzed as per the standard methods (APHA, 1998)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Biohydrogen production,3.1 Biohydrogen production H2 yield showed significant increment from 12.48mol/kg CODR to 16.21mol/kg CODR with increase in organic load from 2.91 to 4.58kg COD/m3 day and subsequent increase showed a drop (8.14mol/kg CODR) due to load shock (Table 1 ). VFA production was significantly low at 4.58 and 7.53kg COD/m3 day loading conditions. Substrate (COD) degradation efficiency was noticed to decrease with increase in organic load [33.33% (2.91kg COD/m3 day) to 8.86% (7.53kg COD/m3 day)]. Marked drop in the COD removal efficiency observed at OLR 7.53kg COD/m3 day supports the load shock behavior observed with H2 production. The effluent generated from HBR was in acidic pH range irrespective of the OLR used due to the formation of VFA.
9,PHB production,"3.2 PHB production The feasibility of PHB production was evaluated both with individual VFA and mixture of three VFA. Maximum PHB productivity was observed at 24thhour of operation (Fig. 2 a). Subsequent operation showed a visible drop in PHB accumulation suggesting the startup of famine condition where the stored granules get utilized for sustaining the physiological activity of the microorganism. However, PHB production was almost similar at 36thhour and 48thhour suggesting the equilibrium state due to simultaneous utilization of substrate and storage granules. Therefore, for all the subsequent experiments PHB accumulation was monitored at 24thhour of operation, where feast condition (excess of substrate) prevails leading to the storage of substrate in the form of PHB. Among the experiments performed with VFA as primary precursor, HBu showed higher PHB yield with a productivity percentage of 33% followed by HAc (32%), HMc (16%) and HPr (11%) (Fig. 2b). Relatively higher PHB production observed with HBu and HAc might be due to the involvement of less metabolic reactions and participation of less number of enzymes towards the conversion. Lower yield observed with HPr might be due to the complex metabolic pathway involving number of steps leading to PHB production. Presence of HAc and HBu in the mixture of acids (HMc) might be the probable reason for the observed higher PHB production compared to HPr. Higher PHB productivity observed with HAc and HBu mixture shows a positive sign for the proposed integrated biohydrogen-PHB process in the direction of enhancing substrate degradation. 3.2.1 Acid-rich effluents from biohydrogen producing bioreactor (HBR) The distribution of acid metabolites formed during H2 production process showed the presence of HAc (75±4%) in higher fraction along with relatively lower concentrations of HBu (10±3%) and HPr (6±3%). The metabolite data showed the feasibility of using fermentative acidogenic effluents as primary substrate for PHB production. Relatively higher fraction of HAc was observed in HBR effluents, which is considered to be crucial for efficient H2 yield during dark-fermentation. HBR effluents showed feasibility as primary precursors for PHB production (Fig. 2c). However, PHB productivity showed a decreasing trend with increase in OLR [2.91kg COD/m3 day, 25% followed by 3.54kg COD/m3 day, 15%, 4.58kg COD/m3 day, 8.5% and 7.53kg COD/m3 day, 6%] (Table 1, Fig. 2c). The observed lower PHB productivity at higher loading conditions might be attributed due to the load shock, where higher concentration of residual carbon along with VFA might cause a lag in metabolic activities. Generally, aerobic bacteria are more sensitive to higher loads than the anaerobic consortia. Even though, substrate load was increased, the retention time was maintained uniformly at 24h during HBR operation which lead to the formation of relatively lower VFA compared to the residual carbon in the effluents. This condition is more favorable to undergo oxidative pathway of residual carbon or other storage pathways like glycogen granules rather than VFA utilization for PHB accumulation. Operation at OLR 2.91kg COD/m3 day showed higher H2 yield associated with higher PHB productivity. PHB production was evaluated by varying redox conditions (pH 6, 7, 8 and 9) at 2.91kg COD/m3 day OLR keeping all the other conditions constant. Operation at pH 7 (25%) showed higher amount of PHB productivity followed by both pH 6 and 8 (15%) and pH 9 (8.5%). Higher growth rate of the microbial population and their metabolic activities might be the reason for the noticed higher PHB production at neutral redox condition. Operation at pH 9 doesn’t support microbial growth as well as metabolic activities which results in lower PHB production. Similar pattern of PHB production observed at pH 6 and 8 might be due to the decreased metabolic activities at acidophilic and basic redox conditions respectively. Higher PHB production was observed at 24thhour irrespective of the substrate used (both with VFA and HBR effluents) might be attributed to the prevailing feast condition in batch mode operation. During feast conditions cell growth was associated with the storage of substrate in the form of PHB. When the substrate concentration gets decreased due to utilization, the organisms start consuming the stored granules for their survival. FISH analysis performed with rRNA targeted fluorescent probes showed the presence of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Acido bacteria, Sulfur reducing bacteria (SRB) and Acetate denitrifying bacteria in aerobic biocatalyst producing PHB (Supplementary Fig. 2). All the observed bacterial groups were reported to accumulate PHB. Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 grown on octanoate showed accumulation of large quantities of PHB (Ayub et al., 2004). Bacillus brevis M6 showed good PHB production (41.67% w/v) (Yilmaz et al., 2005). Acidobacteria was reported to produce PHB when the gene of an intracellular D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate oligomer hydrolase was cloned and sequenced from a PHB degrading bacterium (Quaiser et al., 2003). Seven strains of SRB were tested for the accumulation of PHA (Hai et al., 2004). Desulfonema magnum (growth with benzoate), Desulfosarcina variabilis (growth with benzoate), Desulfobotulus sapovorans (growth with caproate) and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum (growth with caproate) accumulated PHB that accounted for 20 to 43% of cell dry matter. Desulfobotulus sapovorans and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum also synthesized co-polyesters consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate when valerate was used as the substrate. Polyphosphate accumulation by Paracoccus denitrificans was examined under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions (Barak and Rijin, 2000). 3.2.2 Characterization of PHB FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of C–H and carbonyl stretching band in the extracted PHB and compared with the standard PHB (Supplementary Fig. 3). The presence of absorption bands at 1726cm−1 and 1280cm−1 were the characteristic of CO and C–O stretching groups and were identical to those reported for PHB (Khardenavis et al., 2007), there by confirming the presence of biopolymer. NMR spectrum visualized three groups of signals corresponding to the characteristic of PHB polymer (Supplementary Fig. 2). A doublet at 1.30ppm represented the methyl group (CH3) coupled to one proton while a doublet of quadruplet at 2.57ppm resulted from methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an asymmetric carbon atom bearing a single proton. The third signal was a multiplet at 5.27ppm which was attributed to methyne group (CH). The methyl esters showed a sharp signal around 3.50ppm, corresponding to the CH3–O group of the esters. These results suggest the polymer to be poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Staining images captured at different time intervals showed similar pattern of polymer granulation inside the cell irrespective of the substrate used (Supplementary Fig. 3). Higher amount of polymer granules were observed at 24h followed by 48 and 72h."
10,Wastewater treatment during PHB production,"3.3 Wastewater treatment during PHB production 3.3.1 COD removal Treatment efficiency was also considered to be crucial along with PHB and biohydrogen production. COD, VFA and pH were evaluated at regular time intervals during the process (Fig. 2). COD removal was noticed in all the experimental cases during PHB production irrespective of the substrate used suggesting the effective function of the system towards carbon removal. Substrate degradation efficiency varied with the function of substrate used. Higher substrate removal was observed with HBu (ξ COD, 80%; SDR, 6.31kg CODR/m3 day) followed by HMc (ξ COD, 76%; SDR, 4.45kg CODR/m3 day), HPr (ξ COD 58.33%; SDR, 3.55kg CODR/m3 day) and HAc (ξ COD 55.78%; SDR, 2.51kg CODR/m3 day). In the case of HBR effluents, substrate removal efficiency showed a decreasing trend with increase in OLR [2.91kg COD/m3 day (ξ COD 53.57%; SDR, 1.55kg ODR/m3 day); 3.54kg COD/m3 day (ξ COD, 52.94%; SDR, 1.87kg CODR/m3 day); 4.58kg COD/m3 day (ξ COD, 33.95%; SDR, 1.55kg CODR/m3 day); 7.53kg COD/m3 day (ξ COD, 31.94%; SDR, 2.4kg CODR/m3 day)]. Relatively good treatment efficiency observed during PHB production in AxSBR supports the sustainable feasibility of the integrated process. 3.3.2 VFA removal During PHB production a continuous decrement in VFA concentration was observed in AxSBR (Fig. 2b and c). VFA consumption varied depending on the substrate used. Higher removal was observed with HBu (55.46%) followed by HMc (29.66%), HPr (22.09%) and HAc (19.4%). System pH showed an increasing trend with time during operation with synthetic acids. In the case of HBR effluents, relatively higher reduction in VFA concentration was noticed especially at lower OLR [2.91kg COD/m3 day (44.75%) and 3.54kg COD/m3 day (33.73%)] with the function of time. On the contrary, operation at higher OLRs (4.58 and 7.53kg COD/m3 day) showed fluctuations in VFA concentration due to simultaneous generation and utilization of VFA. Higher concentration of residual carbon source present in the form of carbohydrate gets degraded to its end products during this phase of operation, which might not support the optimum condition for effective PHB accumulation. During PHB production, pH showed decreasing trend with time at all the OLRs studied except 7.53kg COD/m3 day operation, where the pH showed increment from 48thhour (Fig. 2a)."
11,Conclusions,"Integrated approach of PHB production by utilizing effluents generated from dark-fermentative H2 production process as substrate was evaluated. Among the synthetic VFA, butyrate depicted higher PHB production followed by acetate, acid mixture and propionate. HBR effluents rich in VFA content showed the feasibility of PHB production but were dependent on substrate load. Neutral redox condition showed feasible microenvironment for PHB accumulation. Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Acidobacteria, Sulfur reducing and Acetate denitrifying groups were identified in PHB accumulating biocatalyst. Terminal integration of bioplastics production with dark-fermentative H2 production process appears to be a promising strategy to enhance treatment efficiency and to reduce the overall process cost when wastewater was used as substrate."
