0,Introduction,"The increasing necessity of fuel has generated a growing research for alternative sources. Hydrogen, a clean burning fuel [1], is expected to become a major energy source in the future. At present, there are several techniques to produce hydrogen from nuclear and fossil fuels [2], electrolysis and thermolysis; but also the development of alternative techniques as photocatalytic water splitting [3]. Currently steam reforming of hydrocarbons is the largest and most economical way to yield H2 [4,5]. However, this process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide that is a cause of global warming; in addition the hydrocarbons are becoming scarce. Therefore technologies based on natural, sustainable and clean technologies, like the hydrogen production from water splitting should be developed to meet future energy requirements. Photocatalysis is considered to be a key technology to generate hydrogen fuel since it involves absorption and conversion of solar energy to split water and generate hydrogen by irradiating oxide semiconductors. The band gap of a semiconductor should be larger than 1.23eV, corresponding to the water splitting potential; the conduction and valence band levels should satisfy the energy requirements to conduct the reduction and oxidation potentials of H2O, respectively [6]. Several semiconductor oxides such as TiO2, ZrO2, NbTaO3, NaTaO3, including transition metal oxides, have been studied as cocatalysts [7–9]; also the design of nanostructured TiO2-carbon materials has attracted the attention due to their high response under UV–vis region for photocatalytic reactions [10,11]. TiO2 has received greater attention because it is stable, noncorrosive, harmless, abundant and inexpensive. The ability of a photocatalyst such as TiO2 to reduce aqueous protons can be improved by using cocatalysts. Some studies have reported the use of gold as cocatalyst for titania [12,13]. It has been reported that Au/TiO2 exhibits good activity for several reactions [14], and it has been studied also for hydrogen production in the presence of methanol as a hole scavenger [15]. In this way, several studies for the deposition of gold nanoparticles have been reported for the photoactivity of TiO2 for water splitting varying the water/alcohol mixture [16], the wavelength of the illumination source [17], and also modifying the structure of the support [18,19]. Also, the deposition–precipitation method using urea as basifying agent (DPU) has shown to be an efficient method to prepare Au/TiO2 catalysts because it allows the preparation of very small gold particles with the advantage over other methods that all the gold in solution is deposited onto the support; therefore, there is no loss of gold in solution [20–23]. The progressive decomposition of urea in solution at temperature above 60°C releases OH− ions, which gradually increase the pH medium [21,24]. This method makes possible the slow precipitation of gold (III) species and avoids a brutal and local increase of pH, which could induce precipitation in solution. The gold precipitate and therefore the supported gold phase have been proposed to arise from the decomposition of urea [21]. To the best of our knowledge, Au/TiO2 prepared by DPU method has never been tested as photocatalyst in water splitting reactions. In this work, because of the importance of the optimization of gold-titania systems prepared by DPU for water splitting reactions, the direct influence of several parameters such as the effect of mass of photocatalyst inside the reactor, thermal treatment and average particle size as well as gold load were evaluated using a mercury lamp of low energy (2W) consumption. The photocatalysts were characterized by TPR, CO-DRIFTS, UV–vis diffuse reflectance, TEM, XDR, ICP and EDS spectroscopy."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Metallic gold nanoparticles were synthesized by deposition–precipitation [25]. To briefly describe the process, the TiO2 P25 support was dried for 24h at 100°C before gold deposition. The gold precursor, HAuCl4·3H2O (Aldrich 99.9%) was added to a container under vigorous stirring to obtain the desired gold loadings (0.25, 0.50, 1.0wt.% Au/TiO2) in a final concentration of 4.2×10−3 M. Afterwards, urea (Aldrich 98%) was added to the solution in a concentration 100 times higher than HAuCl4·3H2O. Then, the support was added to this solution to start the deposition of gold on the TiO2 surface. This suspension was kept in a sealed vessel and stirred vigorously at 80°C protected from light for 16h. After deposition time, the support was recovered by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 100mL of water at 50°C for each 100mg of catalyst prepared. Next, the recovered catalyst was dried for 2h at 80°C and stored under vacuum in a desiccator protected from light. To generate the metallic nanoparticles, the materials were treated under hydrogen or air flow of 100mL/100mg of catalyst at different temperatures and were labeled as follows: Au/TiO2-150, for the sample treated at 150°C; Au/TiO2-300, for the sample treated at 300°C; and Au/TiO2-500, for the sample treated at 500°C. All these temperatures were reached at a heating step of 2°C/min."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization To determine the crystalline phases of the photocatalysts, XRD patterns were obtained by a Bruker D-8 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. The diffraction intensity as a function of 2θ angles was measured between 5 and 90° using a step of 0.03°/min. To estimate the band-gap energy of the photocatalysts (E g), a Varian Cary 100 Scan spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (Labsphere DRA-CA-30I) was used. The equipment was calibrated with a Spectralon standard (Labsphere SRS-99-010, 99% reflectance). The obtained diffuse reflectance spectrum was transformed to a magnitude proportional to the extinction coefficient (α) through the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function: F ( R ) = 1 − R 2 2 R where R is the reflectance and F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function. The E g was estimated from the plot of the modified K–M, [F(R)× hv]1/2 vs. the wavelength of the absorbed light for indirect allowed transitions [26]. The chemical analysis of the catalysts was determined by using ICP on an Optima 4300 DV Perkin Elmer optical emission spectrometer and with Electron Dispersion Scattering (EDS) using a JEOL 5900-LV scanning electron microscope through micro analysis on an EDS Oxford ISIS. For the determination of the metallic particle size and TiO2 particle size, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM 2010 operated at 200keV. The particle size distributions and the average particle size were determined for the materials with different thermal treatments for the evaluation of temperature in the resulting particle size by counting about 500 gold particles for each sample. The average particle size was determined by means of the following equation: d a v = ∑ n i d i ∑ n i where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i . The standard deviation was calculated as follows: σ = ∑ ( d i − d a v ) 2 ∑ n i 1 / 2 Catalyst agglomerates size under reaction conditions was determined on a Z-sizer Nano ZS90 Malvern. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of the dried and calcined catalysts was performed in a RIG-150 unit under a flow of 10% H2/Ar gas mixture (30mL/min) and with a heating rate of 10°C/min from room temperature to 300°C. H2O produced during the reduction process was trapped before the TCD detector. CO adsorption was followed by FTIR spectroscopy to characterize the surface of the gold particles. The experiments were carried out in a Nicolet 670FT-IR spectrophotometer equipped with a Praying Mantis for DRIFT spectroscopy by Harrick. In each experiment, approximately 25mg of dried sample was packed in the sample holder and pretreated in situ under hydrogen or air flow (30mL/min, heating rate 2°C/min) up to the chosen temperature followed by a plateau for 1h. After the thermal treatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature under the same gas flow and then purged with N2, before the introduction of 5% CO in N2 (30mL/min). A spectrum recorded under N2 was used as reference, and then several spectra were recorded under the CO flow until the band intensity was stable."
4,Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production,"2.3 Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production The photocatalytic activity of the Au/TiO2 catalysts for hydrogen production was studied in a homemade photoreactor containing a volume of 200mL of a water-methanol mixture (1:1 molar ratio) and 100mg of the studied catalyst. The source of irradiation is a UV-PC mercury lamp with primary emission at 254nm with intensity of 2.2mW/cm2; this reactor was sealed and connected to a peristaltic pump to inject the sample into the gas chromatograph. The temperature of the photocatalytic reactor was stabilized at 25°C by a water recirculation bath in which the glass reactor was immersed and protected from light using a black cabinet. The determinations for hydrogen production were made in a Shimadzu G-08 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a Shincarbon packed column (2m length, 1mm ID and 25mm OD). The reaction was monitored for 10h. To assure the adsorption/desorption equilibrium, the system was stirred in the dark for 30min and degassed by bubbling nitrogen prior to the photochemical reaction."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Oxidation state of gold and E g values of the photocatalysts,"3.1 Oxidation state of gold and E g values of the photocatalysts The reducibility of gold in the catalysts was studied by TPR. Fig. 1 displays the TPR profile of 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2 which is characterized by a peak with a maximum at T =120°C. The reduction of the sample began at 100°C and ended at ≈165°C. A low-temperature reduction peak like this has already been observed for Au/TiO2 samples [27,28] and has been assigned to the reduction of oxygen species on the nanosized gold particles. Gold in dried Au/TiO2 was mainly present in the oxidized state III in agreement with former works [21,22]. In the case of 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2 calcined at 300°C (not shown), no reduction peak was observed, which confirms the previously-reported results that the supported gold precursor decomposes in air with temperature, it forms Au0 because of the instability of Au2O3 (ΔH f = +19.3kJ/mol) [29]. The decomposition of the precursor in air, and therefore the reduction of gold, begins at temperatures higher than 100°C according to Mössbauer [30] and UV, XANES and EXAFS results [22]. To investigate the oxidation state of the surface of the gold particles in the photocatalysts, the 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2 sample was studied by DRIFTS after in situ activation in hydrogen or air at 300°C (Fig. 2 ). The introduction of CO at room temperature into Au/TiO2 reduced in hydrogen at 300°C led to the appearance of one carbonyl band at 2107cm−1 that can be attributed to CO adsorbed on low-coordinated surface Au0 atoms [31,32]. A shoulder was also observed at 2075cm−1, assigned to negatively charged gold carbonyls [33,34] resulting from the creation of new sites of adsorption due to the reconstruction of the gold nanoparticles under CO [35]. The same DRIFTS study was performed after in situ calcination in air at 300°C of Au/TiO2 sample. The introduction of CO led to the appearance of the band at 2101cm−1, attributed to CO adsorbed on Au0 [31,32], confirming the result obtained by TPR that, after calcination in air at 300°C, gold is present in the photocatalyst as Au0. The photocatalysts were also characterized by UV–vis. The absorption spectra for TiO2 and for the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3A, the absorption of light as a function of the metal loading on the titania surface is presented. The photocatalysts were observed to present an enhancement of the absorption of light in the visible region around 550nm induced by the presence of the nanosized gold particles. The interaction of light on the surface of these metallic nanoparticles produced the effect known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and this effect is known to be characteristic of gold in metallic state [36]. As expected, this absorption increased as did the number of metallic particles on the surface of TiO2; for that reason, the intensity of the SPR increased as did the gold loading for the different photocatalysts. In Fig. 3B, the UV–vis absorption spectra of 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2 activated at different temperatures are presented. The spectrum of the fresh material (only dry) did not exhibit the SPR absorption which means that, as previously mentioned, gold species attached to the TiO2 surface were in the oxidized state [37]. After the activation of the samples, when gold species on the TiO2 surface were reduced and gold metallic particles were generated, the absorption of visible light by SPR of the materials occurred. The intensity of this absorbance depends on the shape and distribution of the metallic particles on the TiO2 support [38]. This signal was observed to increase as did the thermal treatment for 150°C, 300°C and 400°C, respectively. The sample treated at 500°C exhibited a broader spectrum and a red shift in the wavelength of absorption. This effect might have been due to some gold nanoparticles starting to sinter and presenting a bigger particle size, causing a wider absorption of light on the metallic surfaces [39]. The energy values corresponding to the forbidden energy (E g) for each material were calculated and are reported in Table 1 . The value for pure TiO2 was 3.2eV, while the values for the materials containing gold on the surface were between 2.9 to 3.2eV, indicating that in some cases there was a slight displacement of the E g of TiO2 to lower values when gold particles were deposited on its surface. Also, the nominal amount of gold determined for each material by electron dispersion scattering were in good agreement to the theoretical gold loading for each photocatalyst and are reported in Table 2 ."
7,Particle size of gold nanoparticles,"3.2 Particle size of gold nanoparticles The average particle size was determined for the photocatalysts activated at different temperatures by measuring about 500 particles for each sample. Fig. 4 A shows the particle size distribution; the materials treated at 150°C, 300°C and 400°C presented homogeneity of the particle size distributions of 2.8±0.2nm, 2.7±0.1nm and 2.9±0.2nm, respectively. The sample thermally treated at 500°C presented some sintering of gold particles resulting in a larger particle distribution and an average particle size of 4.4±1.6nm. Fig. 4B shows some TEM images of the samples activated at 150°C, 300°C, 400°C and 500°C for the sample 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2. The Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (0.25, 0.50 and 1.0wt.% Au) were also analyzed by XRD; however, in none of the analyzed sample, the presence of diffraction peaks associated to gold were detected, this is because in all cases the particle size was smaller than 5nm and also because the gold loading on the TiO2 samples was below the detection limit of this apparatus."
8,Photocatalytic performance of Au/TiO2 materials for hydrogen production,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance of Au/TiO2 materials for hydrogen production 3.3.1 Effect of metal loading on Au/TiO2 photocatalysts The actual gold loading of Au/TiO2 samples is presented in Table 2. As expected, practically all the gold present in the solution was deposited on TiO2 [21,22]. As previously reported [21] the use of urea (CO(NH2)2) makes possible to employ the real procedure of DP; in this process the Au3+ complexes are deposited onto the TiO2 surface as the result of the gradual raising of pH. As the precipitate is nucleated by TiO2 all the active phase (Au3+ complexes) becomes attached to TiO2 and none is left floating by itself [21,22,29]. Hydrogen production as a function of gold loading on TiO2 is presented in Fig. 5 A. It is shown that from the three gold loadings studied, the 0.5wt.% Au/TiO2 one presented the highest activity for photocatalytic water splitting, having a considerable improvement compared to pure titania. The increase of gold on the surface of the support (1.0wt.% Au) had a detrimental effect on the activity of the photocatalyst, decreasing hydrogen production by about 50%. The material with gold loading of 0.25wt.% increased the activity of the bare support but this gold loading on the surface did not reach the optimal amount of nanoparticles on the surface of titania. This effect could be explained as a compromise between the presence of metallic nanoparticles on the surface of the semiconductor acting as a sink of electrons avoiding the recombination of the hole–electron; nevertheless, at the same time, these metallic nanoparticles interfered with light passing to the semiconductor, preventing partially the transmission of UV–vis light to the TiO2 semiconductor. 3.3.2 Effect of thermal treatment on Au/TiO2 photocatalysts The evaluation of the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalysts for hydrogen production was carried out for the optimal gold content (0.5wt.%), for the fresh sample and for those activated in hydrogen at 150°C, 300°C, 400°C and 500°C; the results are shown in Fig. 5B. The fresh sample was observed to exhibit the lowest activity for water splitting, this may be due to the fact that gold was in oxidized form in that sample as shown by the TPR and UV–vis results. The activated samples had metallic gold particles well dispersed and deposited on the surface of titania. The activity of these samples also exhibited variations as a function of the temperature of activation. The Au/TiO2-300 sample showed the highest activity for water splitting, followed closely by the Au/TiO2-150 material. In this last sample, a small proportion of gold was still in oxidized state as shown in the TPR results. The presence of gold in oxidized state could explain the lowest photoactivity shown by this material compared with the sample activated at 300°C where all gold is as Au0. It is then assumed that the most effective temperatures to perform photocatalytic water splitting are obtained at low temperatures of activation, near 300°C. The treatment of the materials at higher temperatures (400 and 500°C) had a detrimental effect on hydrogen gas production. The activity of the Au/TiO2 materials decreased about 20% for the Au/TiO2-400 sample. In comparison with the sample treated at the optimal temperature Au/TiO2-300, in the Au/TiO2-500 sample, hydrogen production decreased by 40%. As observed by TEM (Fig. 4 and Table 2), the thermal treatment at 500°C caused an increase in the average particle size and also an increase in the distribution of the particle size (from 2.7nm at 300°C to 4.4nm at 500°C); this effect might cause a higher crystallization of gold nanoparticles [22,40]. As a result of this increase in the particle size distribution, the efficiency in the charge transference from titania to the metallic nanoparticles is reduced by about 40%, producing a negative global effect on the activity for hydrogen production. It is concluded then that both parameters, activation temperature and particle size, have an important effect on hydrogen production as can be observed in Fig. 6 . It is important to note that in the range of temperatures used for the thermal treatment of the Au/TiO2 materials, the average particle size of TiO2 crystallites did not change (Table 1). Moreover the particle size of catalyst agglomerates, determined by light scattering in the reaction conditions, was in all cases of about 2200nm. However it should be noted that the values of hydrogen production here reported are strictly valid for the experimental conditions of photoreactor geometry, UV irradiation and photocatalyst particle size, if this system would be scaled-up it should be taken into account the rate of photon absorption for each photocatalysts, as it has been described in some recent works [41,42]. 3.3.3 Effect of mass of photocatalyst on hydrogen production The diffusional effect on the reaction was analyzed for the optimal mass of photocatalyst by using the gold loading of 0.5wt.% and the optimal activation temperature, i.e., Au/TiO2-300. The results of these tests are shown in Fig. 7 A. Hydrogen production increased when the mass of catalyst increased from 0.075g/L to 0.50g/L, where the highest photocatalytic activity was achieved (1492μmolH2 g−1 h−1). When a higher mass of catalyst was used (0.75g/L), a decrease of 40% in hydrogen production was observed; this effect is associated to the excess of individual particles inhibiting the pass of light through the reactor, preventing the proper illumination through the photoreactor. Moreover, when TiO2 was in contact with other particles, it tended to agglomerate forming larger particles [43], which presented important light scattering and inhibited the proper activation of the semiconductor. 3.3.4 Effect of the oxidative or reductive atmosphere on the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts An evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production by gold nanoparticles deposited on titania surface was performed for materials thermally treated under two different atmospheres, oxidative or reductive by using air or hydrogen gas flow. It is observed (Fig. 7B) that when the materials were activated under air atmosphere, the overall hydrogen production was increased by 25% with respect to the same material treated under hydrogen flow. This behavior is in agreement with the results reported by Wu et al. [44]. In their work, they analyzed hydrogen production as a function of atmosphere for the thermal treatments of their TiO2 support prepared by the sol-gel method. The TiOH groups on the titania surface act as trapping centers for the valence-band hole, the principal oxidizing site on the TiO2 surface, leading to enhanced activity of the Au/TiO2 materials. In the case where the material was treated under hydrogen atmosphere, the surface of titania was reduced for the oxidation of the sacrifice molecule (methanol). Table 3 presents recent results obtained for gold-titania systems and some of the reaction conditions and characteristics of the catalysts used in these studies. As can be observed, the values for hydrogen production vary with the water:methanol ratio, gold loading, nature of the support, intensity of the source emission, among others. It is important to note that the comparison of the different results reported in the literature is very complex because the reaction conditions are different in every case. However, we want to remark the very low intensity of the UV-light source used in this work compared with the previously reported works. This is an indication of the high photoactivity of the catalysts reported here for hydrogen production, the effectiveness of these materials might be due to the deposition of the gold nanoparticles by DPU because this deposition method allows the formation of gold particles of homogeneous particle size distributions in close interaction with TiO2 [21,45]. In Fig. 8 , a diagram of the effect of the presence of gold nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface is presented. The mechanism is explained as the excitation of TiO2 by UV–vis light [46–48] forming the hole–electron pair (1); these induces the split of water molecules to oxygen and hydrogen ions (2), the electrons generated on the TiO2 surface are transferred to the metallic particle and reduce these hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas (3). Methanol might present a direct oxidation on the h+ generating hydrogen ions and aldehydes (4). The decomposition of methanol may proceed to aldehyde and hydrogen (5–7). The overall reaction is presented in (8). The effect of the gold metallic particles on the titania is to attract the electron charge to the surface of the metallic particle, avoiding the recombination of the h+–e− species, promoting the hydrogen formation."
9,Conclusions,"The deposition of metallic gold nanoparticles by DPU on the commercial TiO2 photocatalyst is an effective way to carry out hydrogen production from methanol/water splitting. The deposition method used here is an easy and feasible way to improve the photocatalytic properties of titania for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, several parameters were evaluated for this type of reactions such as mass of catalyst, gold loading on TiO2, activation temperature of Au/TiO2, and the gas used for the activation of the samples. From the results obtained, we may conclude that the optimal mass in the photoreactor for hydrogen production is 0.5g/L of the catalyst, and the optimal gold loading on the TiO2 surface is 0.5wt.%. The thermal treatment that produces the most homogeneous particles and the most active photocatalyst was achieved at 300°C. The influence of the gas for thermal treatment showed that when the samples are activated under oxidizing conditions, the activity of the catalyst is 25% higher than that of the samples activated under reducing conditions. The highest catalytic effect is observed for the Au/TiO2 samples where gold is in metallic state; oxidized gold seems to have a detrimental effect on the photoactivity. These results of this study contribute to the development of alternatives to produce cleaner energies, and also to the abatement of pollution, mostly generated by fossil fuels. The results described here provide an interesting path for gold nanoparticles synthesized by DPU, performing water splitting reactions using emission lamps with very low intensity (2.2mW/cm2)."
