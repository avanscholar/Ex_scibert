0,Introduction,"Biodiesel is widely produced from a transesterification process of methanol and vegetable oils. Generally, 10% of vegetable oils are converted to crude glycerol that can be used as feedstock for producing high value-added products, such as drugs, personal products, and healthcare products. In addition, it can be used as raw material for fuel additive production [1,2]. Rastegari and Ghaziaskar [3] studied the esterification of glycerol for the synthesis of monoacetin as fuel additive, causing a reduction of biodiesel production cost. There are many studies on etherification of glycerol and tert- butyl alcohol [4]. Due to the equilibrium limitation of the etherification reaction, excess tert-butyl alcohol is generally utilized to provide high product yield. For this reason, after etherification of tert-butyl alcohol and glycerol is completed, tert-butyl alcohol should be recovered [5]. However, this alcohol forms an azeotropic mixture with water, a byproduct of etherification reaction. Several techniques, such as membrane separation, pervaporation, extractive distillation, azeotropic distillation and pressure-swing distillation, have been proposed [6,7]. Azeotropic distillation can break the azeotropic mixture by adding solvents; however, solvents can also form an azeotrope with a component of the mixture. For pervaporation and membrane separation, suitable material can be selected for selective mass transfer across membrane. However, membrane-based separation is difficult to scale up and can have temperature limitations [8]. Minimum boiling azeotropic mixture can be separated by pressure-swing distillation [9]. However, it is not an economical process and requires high pressure operation [10]. Extractive distillation is widely used for separation of azeotropic mixtures [11,12]. There are many research papers on the design of extractive distillation in many systems, such as modified extractive distillation for separation isopropanol and water [13], separation of di-isopropyl ether (DIPE)-isopropyl alcohol by using 2-methoxyethanol as an entrainer [14], separation of n-propanol and water [15] and separation of the azeotropic mixture between CO2 and ethane [16]. Similarly, Cheng et al. [17] improved the separation of tert-butyl alcohol from the production of glycerol tert-butyl ether by using a stripping column to recover isobutylene and a rectifying column to purify products. The low pressure rectifying column was preferred for separating the azeotrope between glycerol and tri-tert-butyl ether of glycerol. For extractive distillation, suitable solvents or possible entrainers should be carefully selected in order to break the azeotrope and reduce energy consumption [18,19]. In general, types of azeotropic mixtures can be classified by using a residue curve map [20–23]. Serafimov [24] analyzed the types of residue curve map diagrams for ternary mixtures. Thus, the configuration of extractive distillation depends on the residue curve map diagram and vapor – liquid equilibrium [25,26]. To break the azeotrope of tert-butyl alcohol and water, a feasible entrainer should be selected for designing extractive distillation and azeotropic distillation [27]. Szanyi et al. [28] and Rodriguez-Donis et al. [29] developed the heuristic rules to separate non-ideal azeotropic mixtures. Green solvents with low environmental impact were concerned and residue curve map was analyzed for separation of iso – propanol and water by using ethylene glycol [26]. For tert – butyl alcohol recovery, Songlin and Huiyuan [30] investigated the separation of tert butyl alcohol from water by using cyclohexane as an entrainer. It can be seen that a two-liquid phase was formed and a heterogeneous azeotropic distillation was an effective process for separation. However, the boiling point of the entrainer was close to that of tert-butyl alcohol, and a mixture of the entrainer and tert-butyl alcohol still formed an azeotrope. Hence, tert-butyl alcohol of 63.27% was recovered and another distillation column was required for the purification. Berg and Yang [31] recommended that the relative volatility of mixtures should be higher than 2. Therefore, effective extractive solvents, such as hexyl acetate, 3-methyl-2-pentanone and 3-heptanone, were proposed. However, suitable amount of solvents and configuration of distillation were not analyzed. Furthermore, the production cost for the recovery of tert-butyl alcohol from glycerol etherification should be considered [32,33]. The optimum configuration of etherification of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol, including a reactive distillation and an azeotropic distillation, was determined in terms of minimal total annual cost. Because tert-butyl alcohol and water formed an azeotrope, extractive distillation using 1,4-butanediol as solvent was used. Although various entrainers were recommended, Lo and Chien [34] used glycerol from biodiesel production as a solvent for separating azeotropic mixtures of tert- butanol and water because of its high relative volatility compared to 1, 3-Butanediol and triethylene glycol at 0.3 atmospheric pressure. In addition, the criteria for solvent selection based on isovolatility and equivolatilty in a ternary phase diagram can be considered and thus, a family of glycol and ionic liquids is represented as feasible solvents. Imidazolium-based ionic liquid is the most popular solvent due to its stability and reductive conditions [35]. The use of ionic liquid such as 1–ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride can reduce 13% of the total annual cost compared with that of triethylene glycol [36]. Due to its high stability and repulsive effect, ionic liquid such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromine was proposed as new entrainer that can break azeotropic mixtures between tert-butyl alcohol and water [37]. However, environmental concerns of using these ionic liquids are less considered in the past. To design an extractive distillation, both the distillation configuration and solvent selection should be considered. The best configuration depends on economic and solvent selection. Thermodynamic insights using a residue curve map can be applied to determine feasible solvents and an optimization approach can be employed to find a suitable configuration of extractive distillation. Therefore, the aim of this research is to design an extractive distillation for tert – butyl alcohol recovery. A suitable entrainer for this extractive separation is also considered from both environmental and thermodynamic points of view. Thermodynamic insight for a ternary mixture of tert-butyl alcohol, water and entrainer is also analyzed. Furthermore, an economic assessment based on the minimization of a total annual cost is performed to determine optimal design parameters of the extractive and conventional distillation system with suitable solvents for the tert – butyl alcohol recovery system."
1,Process flowsheet description,"The design plant flowsheet of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) recovery consists of an extractive distillation, which is used to separate tert-butyl alcohol from water, and a conventional distillation column as a solvent recuperation (Fig. 1 ). The feed stream consisting of 66.16wt.% of tert-butyl alcohol and 33.84wt.% of water is introduced to the extractive distillation at the flow rate of 12.9kmolh−1 and temperature of 79.2°C. This stream is mixed with a make-up solvent and recovery solvent stream before being sent to extractive distillation. The waste water stream, which has a low boiling point, is removed at the top of the column, whereas the tert-butyl alcohol mixed with solvent is obtained at the bottom of the column. Then, it is sent to the distillation column to recover the solvent, and pure tert-butyl alcohol is obtained at the top of the distillation column."
2,Solvent selection,"Based on heuristic rules for solvent selection proposed by Doherty and Malone [6], the solvent should be environmentally friendly and cannot decompose, and its latent heat should be low. The solvent should change relative volatility of mixtures represented by a separation index. The solvent and the desired product should be in the same distillation region. The product should be in the stable node or unstable node in the residue curve map. Azeotropic mixtures between the product and solvent should not occur. Although Berg and Yang [31] listed 54 feasible solvents for separating water from tert-butyl alcohol, solvents that yield a relative volatility of more than 1.5 to 2.0 can be considered. Another criteria for solvent selection should take into account environmental impact, including Human Toxicity Potential by inhalation Exposure (HTPE) and Aquatic Toxicity Potential (ATP). Regarding the possible 54 solvents for tert-butyl alcohol recovery, there are only six suitable organic solvents (i.e. 3-octanone, hexyl acetate, 2-heptanone, 1,3 butanediol, 3 methyl 2 pentanone and butyl ether) due to their high relative volatilities. For ionic liquid solvents, there are 8 solvents such as 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4], 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [BMIM][TFSI], 1-Hexyl-3-Methylimidazolium Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [HMIM][NTf2], 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide [bmim]Br, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [bmim]Cl, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [bmim]PF6, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate[bmim]BF4, and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide[C4mim]Br. The next step for solvent selection is to consider environmental impact and thermodynamic analysis."
3,Environmental impact indicators,"Although there are many environmental impact indicators, only two key indicators are used: Human Toxicity Potential by inhalation Exposure (HTPE) and Aquatic Toxicity Potential (ATP) as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The time - weighted averages (TWA) and lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of chemicals are gathered from MSDS data [38]. (1) Score HTPE = 1 TWA (2) Score ATP = 1 LC50 The values of the indicator components including organic solvents and ionic liquid solvents are shown in Table 1 . The environmental scores of organic solvents show that 2-heptanone has the lowest ATP value and hexyl acetate has the lowest HTPE value. However, there is no information on the ATP scores of 1,3 butanediol, 3 methyl 2 pentanone and butyl ether. In this work, 3-octanone, hexyl acetate and 2-heptanone are considered. For ionic solvents, the ATP is computed from data reported in literatures [39–41]. Although [bmim]Br is claimed as a green solvent [37], the ATP value is higher than organic solvents. Thus, [BMIM][HSO4], [BMIM][TFSI] and [HMIM][NTf2] are considered candidate solvents."
4,Thermodynamic analysis and phase equilibrium of feasible solvents,"In this section, a thermodynamic analysis using a residue curve map is performed to find the suitable solvents. The NRTL-RK model is employed to predict thermodynamic properties and phase equilibrium of substances in the system. The interaction parameters are taken from the Aspen Plus 7.3 database or estimated using the UNIFAC-Dortmund modified method. The binary interaction parameters of TBA-H2O and other binary pairs are estimated from NRTL-RK model as shown in Table 2 . The NRTL-RK model is validated according to experimental data from Zhang et al. [37] as shown in Fig. 2 . It is confirmed that the model is fitted with experimental data and can be used to predict the thermodynamic properties. For ionic liquid solvents, as the databanks are not available in Aspen Plus, critical properties are predicted by using the group contribution method. In this study, the UNIFAC and COSMO – RS methods are used to predict binary interaction parameters. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the molar flow rate of solvents on a relative volatility. The result indicates that the relative volatility is increased with an increase in the molar flow rate of solvents. To determine a number of solvents, there is a trade-off between the process performance and costs."
5,"System 1: tert butyl alcohol, water, 3-octanone","5.1 System 1: tert butyl alcohol, water, 3-octanone Fig. 4 a shows the residue curve map indicating two azeotropes. The first azeotrope between 62.69% of tert-butyl alcohol and 37.31% of water is classified as an unstable node at 79.64°C. The second between 83.57% of water and 16.43% of 3-octanone is classified as saddle node at 90.46°C. This system is similar to isopropanol/water/ethyl glycol system reported by Pla-Franco et al. [26]. From the analysis of the residue curve map, there are two distillation regions. The feed including the solvent should be located in the lower distillation region. 3-octanone is located at a stable node,so it will be obtained at the bottom of the column with sharp separation. Furthermore, tert-butyl alcohol cannot be obtained at the top of the column due to its saddle node. Therefore, an additional distillation column is required. However, 3-octanone is a feasible solvent because the ratio of the boiling points between 3-octanone and tert-butyl alcohol is 2."
6,"System 2: tert butyl alcohol, water, hexyl acetate","5.2 System 2: tert butyl alcohol, water, hexyl acetate Fig. 4b shows the residue curve map that found one azeotrope between tert-butyl alcohol and water. Pure water and tert-butyl alcohol are saddle nodes while hexyl acetate is a stable node; therefore, pure tert-butyl alcohol cannot be obtained in one column. Although there is no distillation region, an amount of hexyl acetate should be considered. Otherwise, this solvent is ineffective. The mole fraction of water should be lower than 0.3 because mixtures of tert-butyl alcohol and hexyl acetate are obtained at the bottom of the column. The downstream output of this column is sent to the recovery column in order to purify tert-butyl alcohol. Although the ratio of the boiling points between hexyl acetate and tert-butyl alcohol is 1.21 from the residue curve map, hexyl acetate is considered a feasible solvent due to its low environmental impact."
7,"System 3: tert butyl alcohol, water, 2-heptanone","5.3 System 3: tert butyl alcohol, water, 2-heptanone This system is similar to tert butyl alcohol, water, 3-octanone system. There are 2 distillation regions and two azeotropes (i.e. tert-butyl alcohol and water, 2-heptanone and water), as shown in Fig. 4c. The additional column is required for recovery of tert-butyl alcohol. This is because pure tert-butyl alcohol is located at a saddle node. This solvent is a feasible solvent because the ratio of boiling points is 1.42."
8,"System 4: tert butyl alcohol, water, 1,3 butanediol","5.4 System 4: tert butyl alcohol, water, 1,3 butanediol This system consists of one azeotrope between tert-butyl alcohol and water, as shown in Fig. 4d. tert-butyl alcohol is located at a saddle node while 1,3 butanediol is at a stable node. Although the residue curve map of this system is similar to others, this solvent is not feasible because its relative volatility is low [31], which implies that separation is difficult. Furthermore, this solvent has a high environmental impact. In Fig. 3, the relative volatility between tert-butyl alcohol and water is lower than 1. Therefore, 1,3 butanediol is not a feasible solvent."
9,"System 5: tert butyl alcohol, water, 3 methyl 2 pentanone","5.5 System 5: tert butyl alcohol, water, 3 methyl 2 pentanone This system consists of two saddle nodes at pure water and 3 methyl 2 pentanone, and two distillation regions (Fig. 4e). Two azeotropic mixtures are located at tert-butyl alcohol/water and 3 methyl 2 pentanone/water. 3 methyl 2 pentanone is identified as a stable node. Azeotropic mixtures between tert-butyl alcohol/water and pure tert- butyl alcohol are located at an unstable node and a saddle node, respectively. The ratio of boiling points between 3 methyl 2 pentanone and tert butyl alcohol is 1.41. Although 3 methyl 2 pentanone can increase the relative volatility between tert-butyl alcohol and water, this solvent is not feasible due to the ratio of boiling point between 3 methyl 2 pentanone and tert butyl alcohol is lower than 2."
10,"System 6: tert butyl alcohol, water, butyl ether","5.6 System 6: tert butyl alcohol, water, butyl ether This system consists of one saddle node of pure tert-butyl alcohol, two saddle nodes of pure water and butyl ether, and two distillation regions (Fig. 4f). Two azeotropic mixtures are located at tert-butyl alcohol/water and butyl ether/water. The ratio of boiling points between butyl ether and tert butyl alcohol is 1.41. However, it is difficult to recover a pure solvent because butyl ether is located at a saddle node. Furthermore, azeotropic mixtures between tert- butyl alcohol/water still condense at the top of the column. Therefore, this solvent is not feasible under thermodynamic criteria. Similar to system 5, this solvent is not a feasible because the ratio of boiling point between butyl ether and tert-butyl alcohol is lower than 2."
11,"System 7: tert butyl alcohol, water, [BMIM][HSO4]","5.7 System 7: tert butyl alcohol, water, [BMIM][HSO4] This system consists of two azeotropes that are tert-butyl alcohol/water and [BMIM][HSO4]/water. The predicted boiling point of [BMIM][HSO4] is at 364.37°C. All pure components are saddle nodes. Fig. 4g shows two complicated liquid phase regions. When [BMIM][HSO4] is added into the mixture, the feed composition of tert-butyl alcohol, water and [BMIM][HSO4] is around 0.22, 0.11 and 0.66, respectively, that is close to the two liquid phase regions. Therefore, tert-butyl alcohol is lost and mixed in a waste stream. Thus, [BMIM][HSO4] is not suitable as a feasible solvent."
12,"System 8: tert butyl alcohol, water, [BMIM][TFSI]","5.8 System 8: tert butyl alcohol, water, [BMIM][TFSI] Fig. 4h shows two azeotropes between tert-butyl alcohol/water and [BMIM][TFSI]/water. The azeotropic mixture of [BMIM][TFSI] and water is located near pure water. All pure components are saddle nodes. Two liquid phase regions are located near pure tert- butyl alcohol, water and [BMIM][TFSI]. Therefore, a process flowsheet should include two decanters, resulting in an increases in a capital cost."
13,"System 9: tert butyl alcohol, water, [HMIM][NTf2]","5.9 System 9: tert butyl alcohol, water, [HMIM][NTf2] There is one azeotropic mixture between tert-buyl alcohol and water as shown in Fig. 4i. The boiling point of [HMIM][NTf2] is equal to water; therefore, they cannot be separated using a distillation column. The relative volatility between tert-butyl alcohol and water is not changed; hence, the azeotropic mixture between tert-butyl alcohol and water cannot separated by using this solvent. This implies that this solvent is not suitable."
14,Steady state design for extractive distillation and distillation column,"Simulation studies of the extractive distillation and distillation column are performed by using an Aspen Plus 7.3 simulator. Both the extractive distillation and distillation columns are operated at 1bar. The pressure drop in extractive distillation and distillation column is neglected. The numbering of the stages is from top to bottom, with stage 1 as the total condenser and stage n as the reboiler. The simulations of extractive distillation and distillation column are performed based on the RADFRAC module, which is a rigorous equilibrium-stage distillation model to describe a multistage vapor-liquid separation of the distillation column. For the steady-state design, a suitable solvent (3-octanone, hexyl acetate and 2-heptanone) is selected through desirable criteria, such as environmental friendliness and thermodynamic properties, as mentioned in the previous section. The effects of design parameters, such as molar flow rate of solvents and reflux ratio on percentage of water removal are considered for the optimization approach using an iterative optimization search method. The total annual cost (TAC) including the operating cost and annual capital cost is minimized as defined in Eq. (3). (3) M i n X TAC = TAC ope + TAC cap Payback Period subject to xwater in tert-butyl alcohol – solvent stream ≤0.05 xtert-butyl-alcohol ≥99.8 where X are design variables such as the number of stages, and feed location of the extractive distillation and distillation column. The tray sizing function in the Aspen Plus simulator is used to estimate the diameter of extractive distillation. The distance between trays is kept at 2ft. The calculation of capital cost (TACcap) and operating cost (TACope) is calculated following the procedure in Douglas [42]. The annual capital cost is calculated with a payback period of 10 years [43] and using the cost data from Appendix B of Douglas [42] book. The assumptions and specifications of extractive distillation and the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream include 1. The amount of water in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream is 0.05mol%. 2. The recovery of tert-butyl alcohol in tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream is 99%. 3. The feed stage of the solvent is fixed at stage 2. The design procedure of extractive distillation for separating water from tert-butyl alcohol is shown in Fig. 5 . The optimization of the total annual cost should be performed step by step. The design variables such as the number of stages and feed location are integer variables, whereas reflux ratio and reboiler duty are continuous variables. The design procedure starts with firstly specifying the number of stages and feed location. Then, the reflux ratio and reboiler duty are varied until the product specifications are met. Simulations are iteratively performed with different number of stages and feed location and the total annual cost is computed to determine optimal design parameters minimizing the total annual cost. The standard conditions of extractive distillation by using 3-octanone, hexyl acetate and 2-heptanone as solvents are summarized in Table 3 . For the distillation column, the assumptions and specifications of tert-butyl alcohol stream and solvent stream include 1. The purity of solvent in the solvent stream is more than 99.9mol%. 2. The purity of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol stream is more than 99.8mol%. The design procedure of the distillation column for separating tert-butyl alcohol from the solvent is similar to the extractive distillation (Fig. 5)."
15,Economic evaluation,
16,Case 1: 3-octanone as solvent,"7.1 Case 1: 3-octanone as solvent The effect of the mole flow of 3-octanone as a solvent is investigated as shown in Fig. 6 . The operating parameters are similar to the standard conditions. However, the reboiler duty and reflux ratio are adjusted until a composition of 0.05mol% of water in tert-butyl alcohol is reached. Fig. 6 demonstrates that percentages of water in tert-butyl alcohol decreases with an increase in 3-octanone flow rate. It can be seen that a mole flow lower than 11kmolh−1 of 3-octanone in the solvent stream cannot achieve the specification. For this reason, a mole flow of 11kmolh−1 of 3-octanone is used. The reflux ratio is also an important parameter and its effect on the extractive distillation is analyzed as shown in Fig. 7 . At specified reflux ratio, the reboiler duty is adjusted in order to reduce the amount of water in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream to 0.05mol%. The result shows that the mole flow of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream increases with an increase in reflux ratio. However, it is slightly increased when the reflux ratio is higher than 0.7. Moreover, 3-octanone lost in the wastewater stream increases when the reflux ratio is higher than 0.7. Fig. 8 shows the effects of the tert-butyl alcohol-water feed stage location on the total annual cost at different numbers of stages of extractive distillation. The minimum total annual cost is reached at the optimum feed stage location. The results show that the feed stage should be at a decent location when the number of stages is increased to maintain the amount of solvent within the column at an optimal value. Fig. 9 demonstrates the effects of the number of stages of extractive distillation on total annual cost. Increasing the number of stages of extractive distillation can reduce operating cost because of the reduction in reflux ratio. It leads to decreased reboiler and condenser duty. However, increasing the number of stages higher than the optimal value results in high capital cost. For the conventional distillation column, Fig. 10 shows the effects of the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent feed stage location on the total annual cost at different numbers of stages of the distillation column. Increasing the number of stages of the distillation column can reduce the operating cost because reflux ratio is reduced. Thus, the optimum number of stages should be a trade – off between operating cost and capital cost."
17,Case 2: hexyl acetate as solvent,"7.2 Case 2: hexyl acetate as solvent Fig. 11 demonstrates that the mole flow of hexyl acetate in the solvent stream at lower than 9kmolh−1 cannot meet the specification. For this reason, a mole flow of 9kmolh−1 of hexyl acetate is used. Fig. 12 shows that the mole flow of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream increases with an increase in reflux ratio and keep constant when the reflux ratio is higher than 1.2. Moreover, hexyl acetate lost in the wastewater stream decreases with an increase in reflux ratio in a range of 0.2 and 1.2. Fig. 13 a shows the effects of the tert-butyl alcohol – water feed stage location on the total annual cost at different numbers of stages of extractive distillation. Increasing the number of stages of extractive distillation can reduce the operating cost at the same specification as decreasing the reflux ratio, but capital cost is increased. Regarding the conventional distillation column, Fig. 13b shows the effects of the tert-butyl alcohol and solvent feed stage location on the total annual cost at different numbers of stages of the distillation column. The optimal number of stages for the conventional distillation column is 12 stages."
18,Case 3: 2-heptanone as solvent,"7.3 Case 3: 2-heptanone as solvent Fig. 14 demonstrates that a mole flow of 2-heptanone lower than 15kmolh−1 in the solvent stream cannot meet the specification. For this reason, a mole flow of 15kmolh−1 of 2-heptanone is used. Fig. 15 shows that mole flow of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol and solvent stream increases by increasing the reflux ratio. The 2-heptanone lost in the wastewater stream is decreased when the reflux ratio is less than 1.6, as shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 16 a shows the optimum feed location and the number stages of extractive distillation at the minimum total annual cost. Fig. 16b shows the effects of the tert-butyl alcohol and solvent feed stage location on total annual cost at different numbers of stages of the distillation column."
19,Comparison of different solvents,"7.4 Comparison of different solvents When comparing the total annual cost of extractive distillation, Fig. 17 a shows that using 3-octanone gives the lowest annual capital and utility cost while 2-heptanone gives the highest annual capital and utility cost. However, 3-octanone gives the highest solvent cost while hexyl acetate gives the lowest solvent cost. This finding is observed because solvent cost of 3-octanone is higher than hexyl acetate by 5.23 times, and 2-heptanone is higher than hexyl acetate by 8.54 times. For this reason, hexyl acetate gives the lowest total annual cost of extractive distillation. Fig. 17b shows that hexyl acetate gives the lowest total annual cost for the distillation column while 2-heptanone gives the highest total annual cost for the distillation column. This is because the amount of 2-heptanone used for recovery is the highest, and the boiling point of 2-heptanone is nearer to the boiling point of tert-butyl alcohol than the other solvents. Regarding the total cost, hexyl acetate gives the lowest total cost. It is noted that when comparing with the study by Lo and Chien [34], the total annual cost of the tert-butyl alcohol recovery process using hexyl acetate in this study (1.16×104 $/year per kmol feed) is higher than that using glycerol as given in Lo and Chien [34] (9.1×103 $/year per kmol feed). This may be caused by a difference in the feed composition of tert-butyl alcohol and the solvent and operating costs. When using [bmim]Cl as an ionic liquid solvent of tert-butyl alcohol recovery, Aniya et al. [36] reported the total annual cost of the process of 1.27×104 $/year per kmol feed, which is higher than that in this study. Table 4 shows the optimal parameters of extractive distillation and the distillation column for all solvents. Furthermore, environmental impact indicators can also be considered by product of the environmental score multiplied by the amount of solvent flow rate. The result shows that hexyl acetate is still the most suitable solvent because of the lowest amount of solvent needed. Regarding the effects of reboiler duty in extractive distillation, a higher reboiler duty can reduce water contamination in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream. However, increasing reboiler duty results in a decrease in mole flow of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol-solvent stream. For this reason, reboiler duty must be operated at an appropriate value, because reboiler duty should not only be high enough to separate water from tert-butyl alcohol but also be unable to reach the top of the column. However, a higher total annual cost is required. When considering the effect of the number of stages in extractive distillation, increasing the number of stages improves the separation of water from tert-butyl alcohol. For this reason, reflux ratio and operating cost can be reduced by increasing the number of stages. However, increasing the number of stages requires a higher capital cost. For the effects of reflux ratio and reboiler duty in distillation columns, increasing the reflux ratio results in an increase in the purity of tert-butyl alcohol but a decrease in amount of tert-butyl alcohol. The amount of mole flow rate of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol stream can be increased by increasing the reboiler duty. However, contamination of tert-butyl alcohol would also increase. The effects of reflux ratio and reboiler duty in the distillation column on the mole flow rate of tert-butyl alcohol and the purity of tert-butyl alcohol in the tert-butyl alcohol stream are similar in all solvents. Examples of the effects of the reflux ratio and the reboiler duty in the distillation column for separating tert-butyl alcohol from hexyl acetate is shown in Figs. 18 and 19 ."
20,Conclusions,"An extractive distillation and conventional distillation system for recovering tert-butyl alcohol from azeotropic mixtures with water is investigated. Solvents for separating tert-butyl alcohol from water, which are listed by Berg and Yang [31], are used in this work. Feasible solvents are firstly determined through criteria such as relative volatility, environmental impacts and thermodynamic analysis using a hierarchical approach and it is found that 3-octanone, hexyl acetate and 2-heptanone are suitable solvents. Simulations of the distillation system with different selected solvents are performed. Based on the total annual cost consideration, the results show that hexyl acetate is an appropriate solvent for the tert-butyl alcohol recovery process. Furthermore, the environmental impact indicator shows that hexyl acetate is still the most suitable solvent because of the lowest amount of solvent needed."
