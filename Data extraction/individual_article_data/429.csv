0,Introduction,"1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a bulk chemical of great importance in polymer chemistry, and it is mainly used in the production of rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber and resins such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin. Currently, over 98% BD in the world is manufactured in ethylene plant through the naphtha cracking [1]. In this process, BD is produced as a by-product, and therefore, the supply and the price of BD are significantly affected by the demand of ethylene. In recent years, the shale-gas revolution raised in the United States has influenced the global supply of some bulk chemicals such as ethylene. Shale gas is natural gas including up to 10% ethane, and ethylene is readily produced through the ethane cracking [2]. The production scale of shale gas is expected to further increased in the future, and the increasing production of shale gas will promote the production of ethylene from ethane [3]. Meanwhile, the development of the current practical process through naphtha cracking or other ethylene production processes will be influenced by the development of shale gas industry. In the case of the petrochemical industries of Japan, 3 out of 15 ethylene production plants have been shut down during 2013–2016 [4]. Such a situation is expected to lead to a deficit of BD supply and increase the market price of BD in the near future [1,3]. Therefore, alternative processes for the production of BD from other feedstocks are highly desirable. Biomass is a renewable resource with low CO2 emission, and the utilization of biomass resources to produce both chemicals and fuels has attracted much attention in the past decade [1,3–12]. The methods for converting biomass resources into useful chemicals, such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, have been established [5–8], and it is believable that more chemicals will be practically produced from biomass in the future. The above-mentioned recent trends in the global BD supply would provide new opportunities for the production of BD from biomass resources. Thus, biomass-derived ethanol and C4 alcohols are expected as potential raw materials for the production of BD. The production of BD from ethanol is an old practical industrial process in the period from the 1920s to the early 1960s [9], and now it has attracted wide attention again and accompanied with the increasing global production of bioethanol. In the ethanol-to-BD process, it is generally accepted that the formation of BD from ethanol proceeds through a sequence of reactions including dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reduction, and dehydration processes [1]. Generally, the active catalysts for the conversion of ethanol to BD are mixed metal oxides including base components such as MgO and ZnO, while the selectivity to BD is lower than 80% in most cases [10]. Since bioethanol is an abundant and cheap raw material, the ethanol-to-BD process has a large possibility to become an alternative process for producing BD [1,3,9,10]. Recent advances in the catalytic processes are introduced in recent reviews [4,11,12]. Besides bioethanol, biomass-derived C4 alcohols, such as 1,3-butanediol (1,3-BDO), 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,2-butanediol (1,2-BDO), 1- and 2-butanol, are also potential renewable raw materials for the production of BD [4]. Lignocellulosic biomass, which is the most abundant renewable resource, is readily hydrolyzed to sugars such as glucose and sorbitol [7], and the fermentation of sugars can produce C4 alcohols. For example, 1,3-BDO [13], 2,3-BDO [14], 1,4-BDO [15], and 2-butanol [16] can be produced from glucose by fermentation. Additionally, 1,4-BDO can also be produced through catalytic conversion of some biomass-derived platform chemicals such as furfural [17] and succinic acid [18]. These developments on the conversion technologies of biomass to C4 alcohols provide large opportunities for producing BD from C4 alcohols. Scheme 1 shows the production of BD from C4 alcohols, which is generally based on dehydration processes together with hydrogenation of butenes. A two-step dehydration is required in the conversion of butanediols to produce BD, and C4 unsaturated alcohols, such as 2-buten-1-ol (2B1OL), 3-buten-1-ol (3B1OL), and 3-buten-2-ol (3B2OL), are generated as the intermediates [4]. Therefore, the efficient formation of unsaturated C4 alcohols from butanediols is a key process to produce BD with high selectivity. In the case of mono alcohols such as 1- and 2-butanol, they are readily dehydrated to form 1-butene and 2-butene [19], which can be further dehydrogenated to produce BD [20]. In this review, we focus on the production of BD from biomass-derived C4 alcohols, which is an alternative route for the production of renewable BD. Firstly, the methods for the production of C4 alcohols from biomass-derived materials are introduced. Then, the potential routes including both the direct and the stepwise formation of BD from C4 alcohols are summarized, and the advantages as well as the challenges in each route for BD production are discussed."
1,Production of C4 alcohols from biomass-derived materials,
2,Fermentation of biomass-derived materials to produce C4 alcohols,"2.1 Fermentation of biomass-derived materials to produce C4 alcohols C4 alcohols, such as 1,2-BDO, 1,3-BDO, 1,4-BDO, 2,3-BDO, 1- and 2-butanol, are currently produced from fossil resources, and they have important uses in petrochemical industry [21,22]. The production of biomass-derived C4 alcohols has attracted much research interests, and the fermentation of sugars to form C4 alcohols is extensively investigated. Table 1 summarizes the production of C4 alcohols through fermentation. The order of the number of research papers published since 2000 is 1-butanol (ca. 1000) > 2,3-BDO (ca. 300) > 1,3-BDO (10) > 1,4-BDO (9) >2-butanol (2) > 1,2-BDO (0), where the number in parenthesis indicates the number of papers found in the search using Web of Science, although there are research works on the microbial production of 1,2-BDO reported several decades ago [23,24]. 1,3-BDO is an important building block for producing some industrial chemicals including pheromones, fragrances, and insecticides [13]. 1,3-BDO can be produced from 4-hydroxy-2-butanone through either chemical synthesis or microbial fermentation [25]. An equivalent amount of 1,3-BDO can be produced from 4-hydroxy-2-butanone through microbial fermentation processes [26,27]. 4-Hydroxy-2-butanone is also a petroleum-based chemical, while it is derivable from biomass-derived levulinic acid [28]. Glucose is available as a renewable raw material for the production of 1,3-BDO [29,30]. Kataoka et al. has reported that recombinant Escherichia coli can efficiently produce 1,3-BDO from glucose in a batch reactor, and 22.2 wt%yield of 1,3-BDO can be achieved from glucose at a production rate of 3.63mMh−1 [29]. 2,3-BDO is generally produced through microbial fermentation of sugars, which has a long history for >100 years [31]. Because of the important use of 2,3-BDO derivatives for the production of synthetic rubber, plasticizers, and fuel additives, 2,3-BDO has become a promising intermediate in the conversion of biomass resources to useful chemicals [1]. 2,3-BDO can be produced from sugars such as glucose [32], xylose [33], and sucrose [34]. As shown in Table 1, effective strains are dependent on the species of the raw materials: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus licheniformis, and Serratia marcescens can efficiently produce 2,3-BDO from glucose [32], xylose [33], and sucrose [34], respectively. Corncob and kenaf core are also available as raw materials for producing 2,3-BDO: Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae can produce 2,3-BDO from corncob and kenaf core hydrolysates with a yield of 50 and 39.2 wt%, respectively [35,36]. 1,2-BDO, which is currently produced through the functionalization of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons [22], is generally used as a starting monomer for the production of polyesters, polyethers and polyurethanes [37]. The microbial production of 1,2-BDO from biomass derivable materials is less reported. Lee et al. has reported the fermentation of 1-hydroxy-2-butanone to produce 1,2-BDO using Enterobacter aerogenes, and the yield of 1,2-BDO is 71.6 wt% [23] where 1-hydroxy-2-butanone is achievable from lignocellulosic biomass by pyrolysis [38]. Hasegawa et al. also has performed the reaction using a different bacteria species of Candida parapsilosis, and the yield of 1,2-BDO is 63.4 wt% [24]. 1,4-BDO is an industrially important raw material mainly used for the production of polymers such as polyesters, polyurethanes, and polyethers, while it can be converted to some useful chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone [5]. The production of 1,4-BDO from biomass has developed rapidly, and 1,4-BDO can be produced through either microbial fermentation or catalytic conversion processes. In the microbial production, Yim et al. firstly reported the direct formation of 1,4-BDO from sugars: >18 g L−1 of 1,4-BDO could be obtained from glucose by using Escherichia coli strains [15]. 1,4-BDO is also derivable from xylose: 37 wt% yield of 1,4-BDO is achieved through xylose fermentation using Escherichia coli strains [39]. Currently, the production scale of the bio-based 1,4-BDO is small, while some worldwide companies are developing and up-scaling the bio-based 1,4-BDO production from sugars [40,41]. Therefore, the production scale of biomass-derived 1,4-BDO is expected to increase in the near future. The production of biomass-derived 1- and 2-butanol has attracted great research interests because of their potential use as biofuels [21]. In contrast to ethanol, butanols as fuels have lower vapor pressure and contain less water, whereas they have higher energy content [42]. Butanols are even considered as ideal alternative fuels with better performance than ethanol [42]. 1-Butanol is also useful as an intermediate used for the production of paints and plasticizers in chemical industry, while 2-butanol is an intermediate in the production of methyl ethyl ketone [21]. Based on the demand projections, the value of biobutanols are expected to reach $18 billion by 2022 [43]. Thang et al. has reported a microbial production of 1-buanol from cassava slice hydrolysate using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains: 35 wt% yield of 1-butanol is achieved with a productivity of 0.46 g L−1 h−1 [44]. Clostridium beijerinckii can produce 1-butanol from wheat straw hydrolysates with a yield of 20 wt% [45]. Glycerol, which is a by-product in the production of biodiesel [46], can be converted to 1-butanol: 30 wt% yield of 1-butanol with a productivity of 0.43 g L−1 h−1 is achieved through glycerol fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii strains [47]. In contrast to 1-butanol, the production of bio-based 2-butanol is less reported. Chen et al. has conducted the microbial conversion of glucose to form 2-butanol using Klebsiella pneumoniae, which produces 1.03 g L−1 of 2-butanol from glucose [16]."
3,Catalytic conversion of biomass-derived materials to produce C4 alcohols,"2.2 Catalytic conversion of biomass-derived materials to produce C4 alcohols Catalytic conversion is another powerful way for producing C4 alcohols from biomass-derived materials. Table 2 summarizes the production of 1,4-BDO from biomass resources through catalytic conversion processes. 1,4-Anhydroerythritol, which is a dehydrated product of erythritol, can be used as a bio-raw material for the production of 1,4-BDO. Wang et al. performed the liquid-phase conversion of 1,4-anhydroerythritol to form 1,4-BDO using ReOx-Au/CeO2 and ReOx/C mixed catalysts, in which ReOx-Au/CeO2 was effective for the deoxydehydration of 1,4-anhydroerythritol to form 2,5-dihydrofuran, while ReOx/C was effective for the further conversion of 2,5-dihydrofuran to form 1,4-BDO [48]. In the process, 86% 1,4-BDO selectivity with a complete conversion is achieved. The catalytic conversion of succinic acid, which is a platform chemical derivable through the fermentation of glucose [5], to form 1,4-BDO is an attractive process, and many efforts have been made [18,49–52]. Luque et al. tested various Starbon®-supported metal catalysts in the hydrogenation of succinic acid, in which Rh/C and Pt/C showed high activities [18]: the selectivity to 1,4-BDO is as high as 90% over Rh/C at a low temperature of 100 °C and an H2 pressure of 1 MPa. Vardon et al. studied the transformation of succinic acid to 1,4-BDO over activated carbon-supported RuSn catalyst under continuous flow conditions at 170 °C and an H2 pressure of 12.4 MPa: the catalytic activity is stable during the reaction, and the yield of 1,4-BDO reaches 71% at a time on stream of 96 h [49]. The highest 1,4-BDO yield is recorded at 83%, which is reported by Ly et al. who performed the reaction using Re-Pd/TiO2 bimetallic catalyst in a batch reactor at 160 °C and 15 MPa H2 pressure [51]. Scheme 2 shows a route to 1,4-BDO from succinic acid: it is generally accepted that γ-butyrolactone is the intermediate in the conversion of succinic acid to form 1,4-BDO [50–52]. Furfural, which is a platform chemical derivable from sugars such as glucose and xylose, can also be converted to form 1,4-BDO [17]. Li et al. reported that a Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyzed the conversion of furfural to form 1,4-BDO via furanones as intermediates, and 92.7% conversion with 91.9% 1,4-BDO selectivity was achieved at 120 °C and 3.5 MPa H2 pressure [17]. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits both good recoverability and good recyclability in the initial five-run tests. In contrast to 1,4-BDO, the catalytic production of other C4 alcohols from biomass resources is less reported (Table 3 ). Murnieks et al. performed the hydrotreating of wheat straw in the presence of Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst and ethanol solvent at 300 °C and 7 MPa H2 pressure [53]. The major product is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol with a yield of 21.7%, while 1,2-BDO can be produced with a yield of 12.4%. Jin et al. performed the liquid-phase catalytic conversion of erythritol to form 1,2-alkanediols, and 1,2-BDO could be produced with 38.6% selectivity at 85.4% conversion over Cu/CaO-Al2O3 at 230 °C and 2.8 MPa H2 pressure [54]. Microcrystalline cellulose can be directly converted to some 1,2-alkanediols in a batch reactor over Ni/ZnO catalyst at 245 °C, and the selectivity to ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, and 1,2-BDO is 19.1, 34.4 and 10.1%, respectively, at a complete conversion [37]. Ethanol can also be the starting raw material for the catalytic production of 1-butanol through the Guerbet reaction route [22]. Hydroxyapatites and Mg-Al mixed oxides obtained from hydrotalcites are two promising catalyst systems for the vapor-phase conversion of ethanol into 1-butanol, and hydroxyapatites are generally more selective for the formation of 1-butanol than Mg-Al mixed oxides [55–58]. Ogo et al. prepared a strontium phosphate hydroxyapatite catalyst, which could provide 86.4% 1-butanol selectivity with 11.3% conversion at 300 °C [57]. In contrast to heterogeneous catalysts, homogeneous noble metal catalysts such as Ru [59] and Ir [60] complexes exhibit high activities and provide high 1-butanol selectivities. 1-Butanol selectivity over 90% at the ethanol conversion over 30% is obtained in the presence of a mixture of [RuCl2(η6-p-cymene)]2 and 2-(diphenylphosphino)ethylamine at 150 °C for a reaction time of 4 h. A high 1-butanol selectivity of 99% at 37% ethanol conversion is achieved in the presence of Cp*Ir[(2-OH-6-phenyl)pyridine]Cl with an ethanol/Ir molar ratio of 500 at 150 °C for 24 h [60]. Compared to 1-butanol, the catalytic production of 2-butanol from biomass is less reported. In a recent study, Lv et al. investigated the liquid-phase catalytic conversion of levulinic acid to form alcohols: a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst could produce 2-butanol at 63.6% selectivity with a complete conversion at 120 °C and 6 MPa H2 pressure [61]. Up to the present, only a part of C4 alcohols, such as 1,2-BDO, 1,4-BDO, 1- and 2-butanol, are derivable through catalytic biomass conversion processes. Among the C4 alcohols, 1,4-BDO can be efficiently produced from different resources in Table 2 although precious metal catalysts and harsh reaction conditions are required. In contrast to catalytic conversion processes, the microbial production has been extensively studied, and is relatively mature as introduced in Section 2.1. In most of the catalytic processes, high H2 pressures are required, which increases the production cost and limits their further applications in industrial scale. Therefore, the development of the catalytic conversion technologies under mild reaction conditions is highly required and expected. The current fermentation technologies for producing biomass-derived C4 alcohols have provided large opportunities for the production of BD from C4 alcohols, while it is believable that the development of the catalytic conversion technologies would further promote the possibility for producing BD from biomass-derived C4 alcohols."
4,Direct production of BD from C4 alcohols,"As shown in Scheme 1, the formation of BD from butanediols requires two dehydration steps, while the formation of BD from butanols requires a dehydration step followed by a dehydrogenation step. Different steps of reactions would require different catalysts under different reaction conditions, which will increase the difficulty in the direct production of BD from C4 alcohols in a single reactor. Although an effective catalyst for both the steps at the same temperature might be developed in future, it could not be found at the present. Nevertheless, some efforts have been made and some achievements have been reported."
5,"Direct production of BD from 2,3-BDO","3.1 Direct production of BD from 2,3-BDO Acid catalysts are generally used for dehydration processes [62,63], whereas solid acid catalysts such as bentonite [64] and HZSM-5 [65] primarily catalyze the dehydration of 2,3-BDO to form 2-butanone, and neither 3B2OL nor BD can be selectively produced. In 1945, Winfield firstly reported the efficient conversion of 2,3-BDO into BD using ThO2 catalyst, which provided 62% BD selectivity with 100% conversion at 500 °C [66]. However, further study of ThO2 is not reported until now, which would be due to the radioactivity of ThO2. Table 4 summarizes the reaction results in the direct conversion of 2,3-BDO into BD. Our group has conducted a series of work concerning with the catalytic conversion of 2,3-BDO to form 3B2OL and BD [4,67–71]. Scheme 3 shows the major products and their formation routes in the conversion of 2,3-BDO over metal oxide catalysts such as ZrO2, TiO2 and γ-Al2O3 [67]. Among the catalysts, γ-Al2O3 gives the highest BD selectivity of 41.8% at 325 °C, and 2-butanone is co-produced with a selectivity of 33.1%. It is proposed that BD is produced from 2,3-BDO via 3B2OL as an intermediate [67], which is further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation in the report of Zeng et al. [72]. Liu et al. studied the conversion of 2,3-BDO to BD over γ-Al2O3 [73], and they found that the co-existing water was effective for promoting the catalytic performance by suppressing the oligomerization of BD. The proper temperature is concluded to be 300–350 °C for γ-Al2O3 because low temperatures are preferable for the formation of 2-methylpropanol and high temperatures promote the formation of 2-butanone. BD can be selectively produced only at low conversion levels, and the highest BD selectivity is recorded at 60% with a conversion of 16% over γ-Al2O3 at 350 °C [73]. In the conversion of 2,3-BDO, the selectivity to BD is significantly improved over Sc2O3 catalyst [70]. The calcination temperature affects the catalytic activity of Sc2O3, and a Sc2O3 calcined at 800 °C can efficiently catalyze the dehydration of 2,3-BDO into 3B2OL at 325 °C as well as the further dehydration of 3B2OL to form BD at 411 °C. In a single reactor, 88.3% BD selectivity with a complete 2,3-BDO conversion is achieved over Sc2O3 at 411 °C. On the other hand, γ-Al2O3 shows a better catalytic performance than Sc2O3 in the dehydration of 3B2OL to form BD especially at low reaction temperatures such as 250 °C. Based on the above-mentioned results, the reaction is conducted using a dual bed catalyst system including Sc2O3 located at the upper layer and γ-Al2O3 located at the bottom layer (Fig. 1 ), and 94% yield of BD is achieved at 318 °C. In the process, 3B2OL is mainly produced together with BD over the top layer of Sc2O3, and 3B2OL is further dehydrated to form BD over γ-Al2O3 at the bottom layer. In a recent report, a similar dual bed catalyst system, which includes Sc2O3 at the upper layer and SiO2-Al2O3 at the bottom layer, is applied for the conversion of 2,3-BDO, and ca. 60% yield of BD is achieved [74]. Recently, the direct conversion of 2,3-BDO to BD over phosphate-based catalysts are often reported [75–80]. Nguyen tested a series of rare earth orthophosphates, and GdPO4 exhibited the best performance, which gave 58% BD selectivity with a complete conversion at 300 °C [75]. The GdPO4 catalyst gradually deactivates with time on stream due to the carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface. The co-feeding of water is effective for stabilizing the catalytic activity, but it reduces BD selectivity. It is proposed that the formation of an intermediate 3B2OL from 2,3-BDO is catalyzed by acid-base concerted sites, while the subsequent dehydration of 3B2OL to form BD is catalyzed by weak Brønsted acid sites. Amorphous calcium phosphate is also active for the direct conversion of 2,3-BDO to form BD, and the selectivity is obtained at a range of 30–35% with an almost complete conversion [76–78]. SiO2-supported sodium phosphate with a Na/P ratio of 1.82 provides 66.4% BD selectivity with a complete conversion at 400 °C, and the suitable Na/P ratio for the formation of 3B2OL and BD is 1.8–2.0 [79]. Tsukamoto et al. prepared a series of SiO2-supported alkali metal dihydrogen phosphates, and they found that the presence of alkali metal was effective for inhibiting the formation of 2-butanone, and therefore, increased the BD selectivity [80]. The order of the ionic radius of the alkali cations is well consistent with the trend of the catalytic activity for the formation of 3B2OL and BD, which is Cs > Rb > K> > Na ≈ Li. CsH2PO4/SiO2 is the most active catalyst, which gives BD yield of 91.9% at 400–404 °C, and the high catalytic activity of CsH2PO4/SiO2 is explained to be attributed to the combination of the appropriate acid-base property of CsH2PO4/SiO2 and the large ionic radius of Cs+. So far, only Sc2O3 and CsH2PO4/SiO2 are reported to exhibit high activity for the direct production of BD from 2,3-BDO. The catalysts provide similar BD selectivities under similar WHSV conditions, while Sc2O3 is much more expensive than CsH2PO4/SiO2."
6,Direct production of BD from other C4 alcohols,"3.2 Direct production of BD from other C4 alcohols The direct catalytic conversion of other C4 alcohols is less reported than that of 2,3-BDO. Table 5 summarizes the direct production of BD from 1,3-BDO, 1,4-BDO and 1-butanol. Our group has reported the catalytic conversion of 1,3-BDO using solid acid catalysts such as ZrO2, γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3, and the highest BD selectivity of 36% is obtained at 74.3% conversion over SiO2-Al2O3 [81]: a possible reaction pathway is proposed as shown in Scheme 4 . It is obvious that the reaction pathway is complicated. Besides the dehydration of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols, additional dehydrogenation of 1,3-BDO also proceeds to form 3-hydroxybutanal and 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, which can be further decomposed or dehydrated to various products. Therefore, it is not easy to selectively produce BD from 1,3-BDO using solid acid catalysts. Pera-Titus et al. conducted a series of work related to the direct conversion of 1,3-BDO to form BD using HZSM-5 with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios [82–84], and they found that a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio promoted the BD formation: the HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 provides a BD selectivity of 60% with a conversion of 95% at 300 °C [82]. Compared to HZSM-5, an Al-doped SBA-15 can provide a similar catalytic activity at a low temperature of 200 °C [84]. In the combination of the analyses of NH3-TPD, pyridine adsorption and 27Al NMR MAS spectroscopy, it is suggested that the presence of native Brønsted acid sites with medium strength is indispensable to obtain a good BD selectivity [82–84]. In a long run test of 102 h, ca. 20% decrease in conversion is observed in the case of either HZSM-5 or Al-doped SBA-15, which could be attributed to the coke deposition. We studied the catalytic conversion of 1,4-BDO over solid acid catalysts such as γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 [85]. The solid acid catalysts primarily produce BD at low temperatures with low conversion levels, whereas they primarily produce tetrahydrofuran at high temperatures with high conversion levels [85]. For example, SiO2-Al2O3 gives 67.2% BD selectivity with 26.6% conversion at 200 °C, while it gives 5.0% and 92.3% selectivity to BD and tetrahydrofuran, respectively, at 275 °C with a conversion of 99.7%. Therefore, acidic catalysts cannot efficiently produce BD from 1,4-BDO. In our recent report, Yb2O3 calcined at 800 °C exhibits a high activity for either the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to form 3B1OL or the dehydration of 3B1OL to form BD: 96.6% yield of BD is achieved at 360 °C at a low WHSV of 0.4 h−1 [86]. Scheme 5 shows the reaction pathway in the catalytic conversion of 1,4-BDO over Yb2O3. 3B1OL is the major product in the first-step dehydration of 1,4-BDO, while the formation of tetrahydrofuran is inhibited over Yb2O3. The decomposition of 3B1OL to form formaldehyde and propylene is the major side reaction that reduces the selectivity to BD. The direct dehydration of 3B1OL is not considered as a unique path for BD formation, and either 2B1OL or dibutenyl ether is the possible intermediate in the formation of BD from 3B1OL. An ionic liquid tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, which works as both a solvent and a catalyst, is also reported to be effective for the conversion of diols to form dienes: 94% BD yield from 1,4-BDO is achieved at 200 °C [87]. The direct conversion of 1-butanol to form BD was attempted by Kruger et al., who conducted the reaction using dual bed catalysts including γ-Al2O3 at the upper layer to catalyze the dehydration of 1-butanol to form linear C4 butenes and K-doped Cr2O3/Al2O3 at the bottom layer to catalyze the dehydrogenation of butenes to form BD [88]. In the process, the selectivity to linear C4 butenes exceeds 90%, in which the BD selectivity is as low as 15%. Since the selectivity to butenes is high, it is illustrated that the yield of BD from 1-butanol can be improved by using a recycle reactor configuration."
7,Stepwise conversion of butanediols to produce BD,"At the present time, only a part of C4 alcohols can be directly converted to BD. In most of the reports as introduced in Section 3, BD cannot be selectively produced from C4 alcohols. Although BD can be directly produced from C4 alcohols [70,76], the reactions proceed through C4 unsaturated alcohols as intermediates. The direct process is convenient, whereas it requires a specific catalyst to catalyze two reaction steps under the same reaction conditions, which will decrease the production efficiency and increase the difficulty for the selective production of BD. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the reactions into two steps, and study each of the steps separately. On the other hand, it is also important to study the dehydration of butanediols to C4 unsaturated alcohols, because they have important uses for producing medicines, agricultural chemicals, perfumes, and polymers [89]."
8,"Dehydration of 1,3-BDO to unsaturated C4 alcohols","4.1 Dehydration of 1,3-BDO to unsaturated C4 alcohols In our group, a series of works has been conducted on the dehydration of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols [81,90–98]. As introduced in Section 3.2, the reaction of 1,3-BDO over solid acid catalysts is complicated (Scheme 4), and it is difficult to obtain C4 unsaturated alcohols selectively using solid acid catalysts [81]. It has been found that CeO2 can efficiently catalyze the dehydration of 1,3-BDO to form two kinds of C4 unsaturated alcohols, 3B2OL and 2B1OL, in a fixed-bed reactor, and the total selectivity to 3B2OL and 2B1OL reaches 99.2% at 43.9% 1,3-BDO conversion and 325 °C [90]. The CeO2 catalyst is stable during a test for 5 h at 325 °C, and the reaction temperature above 375 °C decreases both the conversion of 1,3-BDO and the selectivity to 3B2OL and 2B1OL. The calcination temperature of CeO2 significantly affects the selectivity to 3B2OL and 2B1OL [93]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the specific surface area of CeO2 significantly decreases with increasing the calcination temperature, but the conversion decreases gradually. However, the selectivity to 3B2OL and 2B1OL shows a reverse trend that it gradually increases with increasing the calcination temperature. It has been known that CeO2 consists of the cubic fluorite phase, and the {111} facet is more stable than other facets [99]. In addition, the {111} facet grows with increasing the calcination temperature and becomes the predominant facet at high calcination temperatures [93,95]. It has been also confirmed by transmission electron microscope observation that the {111} facets are predominantly exposed on the surface of CeO2 with a large particle size [100]. Fig. 3 shows the image of the growth of {111} facet accompanied with the growth of the CeO2 particle size. Because high calcination temperatures lead to large CeO2 particles, which are effective for the selective conversion of 1,3-BDO to form 3B2OL and 2B1OL, the {111} facets are confirmed as the active facets. Table 6 summarizes the dehydration of 1,3-BDO catalyzed by rare earth oxides calcined at 1000 °C. Heavy rare earth oxides, such as Y2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, and Sc2O3, are effective for the selective formation of 3B2OL and 2B1OL [97]. On the other hand, light rare earth oxides except CeO2 show poor activity and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. Fig. 4 summarizes the relationship between the ionic radius of the rare earth cation and the formation rate of the unsaturated alcohols, which is calculated using unit surface area as an intrinsic catalytic activity. It is obvious that the formation rate of unsaturated alcohols from 1,3-BDO decreases with increasing the ionic radius, whereas CeO2 is an exception. In addition, the formation rate of unsaturated alcohols from 1,3-BDO over CeO2 is much higher than those over the other rare earth oxides. Therefore, CeO2 consists of extremely effective active sites which are for the selective conversion of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols. It has been microscopically observed that the {111} facet of CeO2 consists of multiple oxygen defects including point, linear and triangular forms [101]. Kosacki et al. indicate that the concentration of oxygen defects decreases with the growth of CeO2 crystalline [102], therefore, it is reasonable that the point oxygen defects predominantly exist on the {111} facet of CeO2 calcined at a high temperature. DFT and paired interacting orbital (PIO) calculations have been performed based on an adsorption model that 1,3-BDO is adsorbed on a point oxygen defect site [92]. The adsorption energy of 1,3-BDO on the point defect site of the {111} facet is −102.7 kJ mol−1, while that of 1,3-BDO on the stoichiometric {111} facet is −82.7 kJ mol−1: 1,3-BDO preferentially adsorbs on the point oxygen defect site, and the dehydration proceeds on the oxygen defect site. In addition, in the model of 1-butanol adsorbed on the point oxygen defect site, the adsorption energy is only −80.1 kJ mol−1. The relatively low adsorption energy of 1-butanol illustrates that mono alcohols are difficult to be adsorbed on the point oxygen defect site, which is consistent with the reaction result that the produced unsaturated alcohols are not further dehydrated to form other products in the presence of 1,3-BDO. The possible reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 6 , in which three Ce cations are exposed at a point oxygen defect site on the CeO2 {111} facet, and they work as the active sites for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO. The dehydration of 1,3-BDO proceeds based on the Ce4+-Ce3+ redox of CeO2, which functions as acid and base through electron transfer. ZrO2 also shows a catalytic activity for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO. Both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 are active for the conversion of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols, in which 3B1OL is the primary product [96]. However, in contrast to CeO2, the catalytic activity of ZrO2 is low. For example, a ZrO2 calcined at 400 °C provides 8.7% conversion with 3B2OL, 3B1OL, and 2B1OL selectivity of 25.2, 43.9, and 18.2%, respectively, at 325 °C. A high calcination temperature further decreases the catalytic activity, whereas that increases the selectivity to 3B1OL. The loading of CeO2 on ZrO2 is effective for increasing the catalytic activity, while the supported CeO2 prevents the formation of 3B1OL, and the main products turn into 3B2OL and 2B1OL. Recently, we have reported the catalytic activity of Y2O3-stabilized tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO [98]. The catalytic activity of Y2O3-stabilized tetragonal ZrO2 is also affected by the calcination temperature, and the sample calcined at 900 °C shows the best performance: the catalyst with a Y2O3 content of 3.2 wt% exhibits both a high and a stable catalytic activity with total 3B2OL and 2B1OL selectivity over 98% at 66% 1,3-BDO conversion."
9,"Dehydration of 1,4-BDO to 3B1OL","4.2 Dehydration of 1,4-BDO to 3B1OL Our group has conducted a series of work related to the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to form 3B1OL [103–111]. As mentioned in Section 3.2, acidic catalysts primarily produce tetrahydrofuran from 1,4-BDO [85]. The catalytic activities of rare earth oxides calcined at high temperatures are investigated [95,106,109], and some of the reaction results are summarized in Table 7 . Tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone are generated as the major by-products, while high calcination temperature of the catalysts can reduce their formation [106]. Although CeO2 shows an extremely high activity for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols, it shows a moderate activity in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO into 3B1OL. The change in the formation rate of 3B1OL from 1,4-BDO over rare earth oxides calcined at 1000 °C with ionic radius of rare earth cations in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO at 375 °C is added in Fig. 4. The formation rate divided by 4 is also traced as a dotted line in Fig. 4. That is why, in the reaction of 1,4-BDO performed at 325 °C, the formation rate was reduced to ca. one fourth of the rate at 375 °C. Except CeO2, rare earth oxides show a quite similar trend with that in the dehydration between 1,3- and 1,4-BDO at the same temperature. Heavy rare earth oxides, such as Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, and Y2O3, with a cubic bixbyite structure show high activities for the formation of 3B1OL, and ca. 80% selectivities to 3B1OL are obtained over the catalysts [106]. In contrast, the rare earth oxides with monoclinic phase, such as Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3, and with hexagonal phase, such as La2O3 and Nd2O3, show poor activity. Thus, it is suggested that the efficient catalysts have a cubic bixbyite structure in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to 3B1OL. The effect of the calcination temperature of Er2O3 on the catalytic activity and the specific surface area is shown in Fig. 5 . The specific surface area of Er2O3 decreases with increasing the calcination temperature, and thus particle sizes increased with raising the calcination temperature. The conversion is maximized at a calcination temperature of 800 °C, while the selectivity to 3B1OL increases with increasing the calcination temperature. Er2O3 consists of a single monoclinic structure at calcination temperatures of 600 °C or lower, whereas the Er2O3 samples calcined between 700 and 800 °C contain a mixture of monoclinic and cubic bixbyite structure. Furthermore, the Er2O3 shows a single cubic bixbyite structure at calcination temperatures of 900 °C or higher. The reactions over Er2O3 in a flow of either NH3 or CO2 gas are performed in order to understand the reaction mechanism because NH3 and CO2 poison the acid and base site on Er2O3, respectively [106]. The introduction of both NH3 and CO2 decreases both the conversion of 1,4-BDO and the selectivity to 3B1OL, indicating that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to 3B1OL proceeds via an acid-base concerted mechanism. Since the {222} facet of Er2O3 grows with increasing the calcination temperature [110], the active sites could exist on the {222} facet of Er2O3. The adsorption of 1,4-BDO on the {222} facet of Er2O3 is studied by DFT and PIO calculations which reveal an acid-base concerted mechanism as shown in Scheme 7 [110]. The hydrogen at position 2 is firstly abstracted by a basic oxygen anion and the hydroxyl group at position 1 is subsequently abstracted by an acidic erbium cation. The hydroxyl group at position 4 works for anchoring the 1,4-BDO molecule to the surface of Er2O3. It is clear that the mechanism in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO over rare earth oxides with a cubic bixbyite structure is different from the electron transfer-based mechanism in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO over CeO2. ZrO2-based catalysts are also active for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to form 3B1OL [103,104,106,110–112]. As shown in Table 7, monoclinic ZrO2 calcined at 400 °C provides 34.1% selectivity to 3B1OL with 94.4% conversion at 325 °C, while tetragonal ZrO2 shows a poor activity for the formation of 3B1OL [107]. A high calcination temperature of monoclinic ZrO2 such as 800 °C does not significantly improve the selectivity to 3B1OL, and it only decreases the conversion of 1,4-BDO. However, the high-temperature calcination is effective in the modification of monoclinic ZrO2 by heavy rare earth oxides, such as Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, and Lu2O3, for promoting the formation of 3B1OL, and 81.9% 3B1OL selectivity with 72.9% conversion is obtained over Yb2O3/ZrO2 [107]. The modification of monoclinic ZrO2 by either alkaline or alkaline earth metal oxides is also an effective method for the production of 3B1OL from 1,4-BDO [104,111–113]. The monoclinic ZrO2 modified by 1.0 mol% Na provides 71.8% 3B1OL selectivity with 18.7% conversion at 325 °C [104]. The temperature-programmed desorption experiments reveal that the modification of ZrO2 by Na decreases the acidic sites, but it increases the basic sites. The acid sites and the basic sites are preferable for the formation of tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone, respectively, while both of acid sites and basic sites are required for the formation of 3B1OL. In the reports of Zhang et al., the CaO-modified tetragonal ZrO2 calcined at 650 °C also shows a high catalytic performance, which gives 68.9% 3B1OL selectivity with 94.6% conversion at 350 °C [112,113]: the catalytic activity is stable within 300 h. The modification of monoclinic ZrO2 by CaO has also been studied by our group, and the temperature-programmed desorption experiments reveal that the calcination at 800 °C or higher leads to the formation of new basic sites, which are effective for the formation of 3B1OL from 1,4-BDO [111]. The new basic sites are originated from Ca-O-Zr hetero-linkages, which can be further created by co-impregnating CaO and additional ZrO2 on a monoclinic ZrO2 support: the formation of 3B1OL from 1,4-BDO is enhanced over an CaO-ZrO2/m-ZrO2 catalyst calcined at 800 °C, which provides 89.1% 3B1OL selectivity with 93.6% conversion at 350 °C."
10,"Dehydration of 2,3-BDO to 3B2OL","4.3 Dehydration of 2,3-BDO to 3B2OL Table 8 summarizes the dehydration of 2,3-BDO to 3B2OL over several catalysts. As mentioned in Section 3.1, traditional solid acid catalysts primarily convert 2,3-BDO into 2-butanone [64,65]. In our tests of the catalytic activities of rare earth oxides calcined at 800 °C in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO at 325 °C [68], the changes in the formation rate of 3B2OL from 2,3-BDO with ionic radius of rare earth cations are added in Fig. 4. In the dehydration of BDOs to form unsaturated alcohols, the reactivity of 2,3-BDO over rare earth oxides is quite lower than those of 1,4-BDO and 1,3-BDO. Among the rare earth oxides, Sc2O3 as well as In2O3 shows high catalytic activity for the formation of 3B2OL, and 85% 3B2OL selectivity with 99.9% conversion is achieved over an 800 °C-calcined Sc2O3. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the calcination temperature of Sc2O3 in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO at 325 °C. The specific area of Sc2O3 decreases with increasing the calcination temperature, which leads to the slight decrement in the conversion of 2,3-BDO. On the other hand, the calcination at 800 °C or higher improves the selectivity to 3B2OL, and thus a smooth surface of Sc2O3 with a high crystallinity is preferable for the formation of 3B2OL. In the dehydration of 2,3-BDO over monoclinic ZrO2, the calcination temperature is also an important factor: the sample calcined at 900 °C provides 57.1% 3B2OL selectivity with 49.8% conversion at 325 °C [67]. The modification of monoclinic ZrO2 by alkaline earth metal oxides is an effective method for further promoting the formation of 3B2OL from 2,3-BDO [69,71]. The conversion of 2,3-BDO and the selectivity to 3B1OL reaches 74.4% and 72.4%, respectively, in the reaction over BaO-modified monoclinic ZrO2 [71]. In the reaction over CaO-modified monoclinic ZrO2, poisoning gas of either CO2 or NH3 reduces both the conversion of 2,3-BDO and the selectivity to 3B2OL, which strongly suggests that the formation of 3B2OL from 2,3-BDO proceeds through an acid-base concerted mechanism [69]. Furthermore, it is confirmed that highly dispersed M-O-Zr (M = Ca and Ba) hetero-linkages are formed on the surface of the modified monoclinic ZrO2, and the hetero-linkages provide an appropriate acid-base balance that is efficient for the formation of 3B2OL from 2,3-BDO [71]. A possible acid-base concerted mechanism is proposed in Scheme 8 , and the basic (B) site is proposed to be originated from the newly generated M-O-Zr (M = Ca or Ba) hetero-linkages. This mechanism is also applicable for the dehydration of 2,3-BDO to 3B2OL over Sc2O3, which has a cubic bixbyite structure with a predominant facet of {222} at high calcination temperatures. The O2 – anion represents the basic site B, while the Sc3+ cations and/or the oxygen defect sites work as acidic sites, A1 and A2."
11,Conversion of unsaturated C4 alcohols into BD,"4.4 Conversion of unsaturated C4 alcohols into BD In the unsaturated C4 alcohols, 2B1OL and 3B2OL are readily dehydrated to produce BD over solid acid catalysts such as γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 [114]. SiO2-Al2O3 shows a high catalytic activity for the conversion of both 2B1OL and 3B2OL to form BD: BD selectivity of 97.1% with 99.3% 2B1OL conversion and BD selectivity of 93.4% with 77.4% 3B2OL conversion are obtained at an initial stage over SiO2-Al2O3 at 260 °C, whereas SiO2-Al2O3 is not stable in the dehydration of both 2B1OL and 3B2OL. The modification of SiO2-Al2O3 by Ag is an effective method for inhibiting the catalytic deactivation, while H2 as a carrier gas is indispensable. It is supposed that Ag metal works for cleaving H2 to H atoms, and that the produced H atoms can suppress the formation of coke and inhibiting the catalytic deactivation. The catalytic activity of the Ag-modified SiO2-Al2O3 is stable within 5 h in the dehydration of either 2B1OL or 3B2OL. In contrast to 2B1OL and 3B2OL, the conversion of 3B1OL over solid acid catalysts is complicated, and various reactions proceed as shown in Scheme 9 . The decomposition of 3B1OL primarily proceeds over solid acid catalysts: the selectivity to propylene is 53.1% over SiO2-Al2O3 at 260 °C [114]. On the other hand, some heavy rare earth oxides, such as Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, and Lu2O3, are effective for the selective formation of BD from 3B1OL [86]. A high calcination temperature such as 800 °C is also required for promoting the catalytic activity of the heavy rare earth oxides. In particular, a Yb2O3 calcined at 800 °C provides 96.7% BD selectivity with 99.6% 3B1OL conversion at a small WHSV of 0.37 h−1 and 340 °C. Since high reaction temperatures promote the decomposition of 3B1OL to form propylene and formaldehyde over the heavy rare earth oxides, a reaction temperature at 340 °C or lower is preferable for the formation of BD. It is also supposed that an acid-base concerted mechanism is applicable for the dehydration of 3B1OL to produce BD, and the possible mechanism is shown in Scheme 10 ."
12,Stepwise production of BD from C4 mono alcohols,
13,Dehydration of C4 mono alcohols to butenes,"5.1 Dehydration of C4 mono alcohols to butenes C4 mono alcohols such as 1- and 2-butanol are readily dehydrated to form 1-butene and/or 2-butene over solid acid catalysts [19,115–120]. Lu et al. performed the dehydration of 1-butanol over γ-Al2O3 membrane in a tubular reactor [115]. The γ-Al2O3 membrane provides 39.2% conversion of 1-butanol with 1-butene and 2-butene selectivity of 70.1 and 29.9%, respectively, at 250 °C where 2-butene is produced by the isomerization of 1-butene. The conversion of 1-butanol increases with increasing the reaction temperature, while it decreases with increasing the calcination temperature of the γ-Al2O3 membrane. Ashour has studied the effect of the reaction temperature and the calcination temperature of γ-Al2O3 in the dehydration of 1-butanol using a quartz flow reactor [116]. High reaction temperatures prefer the formation of both 1-butene and 2-butene, while the 1-butene/2-butene ratio decreases with increasing the reaction temperature because of the limitation of chemical equilibrium. Dibutyl ether and isobutene are also formed in the reactions, and a high reaction temperature promotes the formation of isobutene with the inhibition of the dibutyl ether formation. Because a high calcination temperature reduces the surface area and the total pore volume of γ-Al2O3, a low calcination temperature of γ-Al2O3 is preferable for the conversion of 1-butanol to form butenes. Wu et al. recently reported the dehydration of 1-butanol over Zn-Mn-Co-modified γ-Al2O3 [121]. The crystallinity and the acidity of γ-Al2O3 are enhanced by the modification of Zn-Mn-Co, and the Zn-Mn-Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst provides 96.24% selectivity to total butenes with a complete conversion at 400 °C. Gunst et al. studied the conversion of some butanols, such as 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and 2-methylpropanol, to form butenes over H-ZSM5 [19]. 2-Butanol is the most reactive one among the mono alcohols, and only 1-butene and 2-butene are formed in the dehydration of 2-butanol over H-ZSM5 at 230 °C or lower: 100% yield of butenes is obtained from 2-butanol over H-ZSM5 at 220–230 °C. Mesoporous aluminosilicates, which are synthesized from a commercial ferrierite as the framework source, are also reported to be effective for the dehydration of 2-butanol to form butenes: ca. 85% conversion of 2-butanol with 1- and 2-butene selectivities of 51 and 49%, respectively, can be obtained at 250 °C at a WHSV of 40.4 h−1 [118]."
14,Conversion of 1- and 2-butene into BD,"5.2 Conversion of 1- and 2-butene into BD The dehydrogenation of butenes to form BD can be divided into two categories including the non-oxidative and the oxidative dehydrogenation. In a non-oxidative dehydrogenation process, butenes can decompose to BD and H2 over supported metal oxide catalysts such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [121] and K-Fe3O4/ZrO2 [122]: BD selectivity above 80% is obtained. The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of butenes to BD is highly endothermic, and a high reaction temperature such as 600 °C is required for reasonable BD selectivity at high WHSV. In addition, the high temperatures also contribute to balance kinetic/thermodynamic effects because BD is not a stable product under the conditions [123]. Lower temperatures can also be used if a lower WHSV is acceptable. Kruger et al. performed the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene at a low temperature of 450 °C and a low WHSV of 0.76 h−1: BD yield of ca. 47% was achieved over K-doped Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas it could not be further improved due to the restrict of reaction equilibrium at 450 °C [88]. The non-oxidative dehydrogenation suffers from the thermodynamic restrictions on conversion and BD selectivity as well as the serious catalytic deactivation due to the rapid coke formation [20], in contrast to an oxidative dehydrogenation process. Therefore, recent research interests are mainly focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation. In an oxidative dehydrogenation process, butenes react with oxygen to form BD and H2O. The oxidative dehydration process, which is exothermic, can be performed at a relatively low temperature range of 300–550 °C, and it produces small amount of coke and cracking by-products [20]. The oxidative dehydrogenation proceeds through the Mars and van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, and therefore, the mobility and capacity of the lattice oxygen in metal oxide catalysts are important factors which determine the catalytic performance. Table 9 summarizes some excellent reaction results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of butenes to form BD. Bismuth molybdates- and ferrites-based catalysts are mostly studied [124–129]. The BD selectivity of 87% with 96% conversion and the BD selectivity of 88% with 75% conversion are obtained over Co9Fe3Bi1Mo12O51 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene and 2-butene at 420 °C, respectively [124]. The main by-product is CO2 in the reactions. Co9Fe3Bi1Mo12O51 can convert 1-butene and 2-butene to form BD with similar selectivities, while the reactivity of 1-butene is higher than that of 2-butene. The similar situations are also reported in the reactions over BiFe0.65Ni0.05MoOx [125] and ZnFe2O4 [128,129]. BiMoLa0.2Ox and BiMoCe0.2Ox are extremely effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene to form BD, and they provide ca. 95% BD selectivity with a conversion of ca. 74% at 440 °C [126,127]. In addition, the catalytic activity of the catalysts is stable without the deactivation within 100 h. The content of La and Ce in the bismuth molybdates can increase the oxygen mobility and promote the adsorption of 1-butene that leads to their high catalytic performances."
15,Concluding remarks and prospects,"This review summarizes the possible routes for the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived C4 alcohols, such as 2,3-, 1,3-, 1,4-BDO, and butanols, to form BD. Butanediols can be converted to BD through stepwise dehydration, in which unsaturated alcohols, such as 3B2OL, 2B1OL and 3B1OL, are the intermediates. Butanols can be converted to BD through a dehydration to form butenes followed by a dehydrogenation to form BD. Among the C4 alcohols, only 2,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO can be efficiently converted to BD in a single reactor, and such as a direct conversion process requires a catalyst system that is effective for both of the two dehydration steps under the same reaction conditions. For most of the C4 alcohols, a two-step conversion is reasonable because the two different reactions can be conducted using different catalysts under different reaction conditions separately. Solid acid catalysts are not effective for the dehydration of all the butanediols to form unsaturated alcohols because of the low selectivity to BD. CeO2 with a cubic fluorite phase shows the highest catalytic activity for the conversion of 1,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols such as 3B2OL and 2B1OL. The dehydration of 1,3-BDO over CeO2 is a structure-sensitive reaction, and the {111} facets of CeO2 are confirmed as the active facets. Several heavy rare earth oxides, such as Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, and Y2O3, with a cubic bixbyite structure show high activities for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to from 3B1OL as well as for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO to form 3B2OL and 2B1OL, which proceeds through an acid-base concerted mechanism. In the case of 2,3-BDO, Sc2O3 is the most selective catalyst for the formation of 3B2OL. The catalytic conversion of 1,3-BDO, 1,4-BDO, and 2,3-BDO to form unsaturated alcohols has been studied in detail. In contrast, 1,2-BDO cannot be selectively converted to form unsaturated alcohols, leaving a big room for innovation. In the unsaturated C4 alcohols, 2B1OL and 3B2OL are readily dehydrated to form BD over solid acid catalysts, which primarily catalyze the decomposition of 3B1OL to form propylene and formaldehyde. Heavy rare earth oxides, such as Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, are the effective catalysts for the selective dehydration of 3B1OL to BD. Butanols are readily converted to butenes over solid acid catalysts, and butenes can be efficiently converted to BD over bismuth molybdates- and ferrites-based catalysts through an oxidative dehydrogenation process. Among the various routes for producing BD, it is considered that the production of BD from 2,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO is more attractive and competitive. This is because 2,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO are readily derived from biomass, and they can be efficiently converted to form BD through either a direct or a stepwise process. In contemporary chemical industry, much attention has been paid for shifting society's dependence away from petroleum to renewable biomass resources. From the point of view of CO2 emission control, the production of biomass-derived chemicals is also essential and should be highly encouraged. The production of chemicals from biomass does not give additional release of CO2, and therefore, it is a powerful way to resolve the current environmental problems caused by excess CO2 emission. The catalytic conversion of biomass-derived ethanol and C4 alcohols are two potential ways for the production of renewable BD, and the development of the processes also contribute to solve the current shortage of BD supply. In addition, both of the processes are environmentally friendly. In contrast to the ethanol-to-BD process, the C4 alcohols-to-BD process can provide high BD selectivities, and the catalytic activities in most of the C4 alcohols dehydration processes are stable. On the other hand, the C4 alcohols-to-BD process would be costly due to the relatively high price of C4 alcohols. However, it is promising that the further developments of the C4 alcohols production technologies would reduce the cost. The conversion of C4 alcohols to produce BD is a new trend, and further innovations on the catalytic processes are still required. Nevertheless, we hope that the conversion of C4 alcohols to form BD would become a competitive process for producing BD in the future."
