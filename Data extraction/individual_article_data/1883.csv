0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid global population growth and economic development, the burning of fossil fuels in industrial, transportation and domestic sectors releases substantial nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases [1]. Nowadays, it has been recognized that many serious concerns including environmental pollution and global warming are associated with burning fossil fuels [2]. Those serious concerns have raised awareness to develop alternative and sustainable energy. To establish a low-carbon society, solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy and biofuels as renewable energy are developed in many countries [3]. Biofuels are becoming increasingly important because of environmental and energy concerns. Biodiesel, as one kind of biofuels, is mainly produced via the transesterifications of oil and fat using acid or base catalyst. Nowadays, biodiesel derived from vegetable oil, animal fat or waste cooking oils has been considered to be an effective and clean-burning alternative fuel due to its sustainable renewability, low exhaust emissions and high cetane number [4,5]. However, biodiesel, whose main composition is fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), has some drawbacks (poor cold flow property and low oxidative stability). The drawbacks mentioned above are truly dependent on the structural features of FAMEs, and have a certain extent limit for the application of biodiesel [6]. The high content of saturated FAMEs causes the poor cold flow properties of biodiesel. And, if the biodiesel has a high polyunsaturated FAMEs content, low oxidative stability will happen in the biodiesel [7]. Monounsaturated FAMEs are appropriate compositions to reach a balance between oxidation stability and cold flow property [8]. Many biodiesels (such as biodiesels derived from Jatropha oil and cottonseed oil) contain a high content of polyunsaturated components, namely polyunsaturated FAMEs. The polyunsaturated FAMEs are the undesired compositions for the good performance of biodiesel and needed to be upgraded to gain excellent biodiesel. Many researchers suggested that polyunsaturated FAMEs could be converted into monounsaturated FAMEs by the partial hydrogenation reaction, which would improve the oxidation stability and, meanwhile, keep the well cold flow property of biodiesel [9]. The conventional method of hydrogenation using hydrogen gas (H2) as hydrogen source has been widely reported in the upgrading of fats, oils, and biodiesels. Using H2 as hydrogen source, Thunyaratchatanon et al. investigated hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived FAMEs, the oxidative stability of hydrogenated biodiesels was improved [10]. It has been found that the conventional hydrogenation using H2 as hydrogen source is an effective way to upgrade biodiesel; however, this process of conventional hydrogenation is affected by a variety of factors such as temperature, pressure, amount of hydrogen, and hydrogen purity. For example, the hydrogen gas used in most reactions must be high in purity, which can affect process economics. For the conventional hydrogenation reaction, with the catalyst of nickel, the hydrogenation of fats and oils happens at the high temperature of 120–200 ℃ and the hydrogen pressure of 0.1–0.5 MPa [11]. The use of precious metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, and Ru) in conventional hydrogenation reaction decreases the reaction temperature; however, the reaction still requires high hydrogen pressure [12–14]. For example, Numwong et al. studied the partial hydrogenation of rapeseed oil-derived FAMEs over Pd/SiO2 catalysts at the temperature of 80 ℃ and hydrogen partial pressure of 0.3 MPa [15]. Furthermore, due to the explosive nature of H2 and the strict condition in use, a new hydrogen source used to replace hydrogen gas is necessary and in demand for the hydrogenation reaction. In comparison with hydrogenation reaction using hydrogen gas, using chemical hydrogen as hydrogen source has potential advantages. The chemical hydrogen can be supplied by chemicals of hydrogen donor via reaction. Formic acid, formates, phosphorous acid, phosphites, hydrazine and alcohols can be used as hydrogen donors in the hydrogenation reaction. Tike and Mahajani reported hydrogenation of soybean oil by using ammonium formate as hydrogen donor, and it was found that the hydrogenation reaction was carried out successfully at the condition of atmospheric pressure [16]. Hu et al. found an effective way for the selective hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural by using 2-butanol both as hydrogen donor and as solvent [17]. It has been recognized that because of mild reaction conditions, easy control of the reaction, no high-pressure vessels needed and simple process, the use of hydrogen donors can overcome some disadvantages of reaction which directly hydrogenated by hydrogen gas [16–18]. However, the hydrogen donors published in the literature for the hydrogenation of fats and oils were mainly alcohols [18], formic acid and its salts [19]. Wei et al. studied the hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel using isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen donor under microwave heating. It was found that the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl ester has successfully converted into the monounsaturated fatty acid methyl ester [18]. Sancheti and Gogate studied the ultrasound-assisted hydrogenation of soybean oil over Pd/C, and found that the soybean oil has been hydrogenated effectively using ammonium formate as hydrogen donor [19]. However, many hydrogen donors indeed showed low hydrogen utilization ratios in the hydrogenation reaction. For example, Tike and Mahajani studied the hydrogenation of soybean oil, and found that 26.7 mol ammonium formate was consumed for hydrogenation of 1 mol soybean oil [16]. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), as a hydrogen storage material, has a high hydrogen content [20]. Using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor would provide a new way for the hydrogenation of oils and fats. One of the most broadly used catalysts for hydrogenation of oils or fats is nickel due to its relatively high catalytic activity and low cost compared with noble metal catalysts, such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru). In the past two decades, Ni-B alloy catalyst has been attracted many researchers’ attention because of its special electronic properties and structures. Ni-B catalyst had an amorphous structure that would promote the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst since the amorphous structure was more favorable for the hydrogenation than the corresponding crystalline structure [21]. Li et al. found that the Ni-B catalyst had a lower selectivity for the formation of saturated fatty acids and trans-fatty acids during the hydrogenation of soybean oil compared with the commercial nickel catalyst [22]. However, the Ni-B catalyst was prone to aggregation, which would decrease the activity of catalyst. Lanthanum (La) was an effective modifier for inhibiting the agglomeration of catalyst [23]. Therefore, Ni-La-B catalyst has been synthesized for the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs. A new method for hydrogenation of FAMEs using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor has been proposed in the present work. With the new method, the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs has successfully proceeded under the mild conditions using reusable Ni-La-B as catalyst. Firstly, the effects of catalyst loading, reaction temperature, reaction time, water quantity, sodium borohydride amount on the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs have been studied. Moreover, based on the composition change, the properties of the hydrogenated FAMEs were briefly analyzed. Lastly, the reaction mechanism of partial hydrogenation for FAMEs using NaBH4 as hydrogen donor has been proposed. The present work would help to have a clear understanding of the hydrogenation of FAMEs using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor, and would provide a theoretical basis for the further development of hydrogenation reaction using NaBH4 as hydrogen donor in the hydrogenation of oils and fats."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Fatty acid (chemical pure), purchased from China Chemical Fine Branch, was used as a raw material for FAMEs synthesis. According to the previous work, FAMEs have been synthesized in the present work via the method of acid-catalyzed esterification. In this method, 20 g of fatty acid and 28 g of methanol were first taken in a three-necked round bottom flask, and then 0.4 g of H2SO4 (2 wt% as compared to fatty acid) was added into the flask. After that, the flask was placed and fixed in a thermostatically controlled water bath equipped with a magnetic stirring, and the reaction was progressed at 65 ℃ for 3 h in the presence of a reflux condenser. After the reaction, the samples were transferred into a separating funnel for phase separation. The separated upper oil phase was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution several times to remove the remaining H2SO4 and methanol. Finally, the oil phase of FAMEs was collected in a glass bottle containing anhydrous Na2SO4 for removal of the remaining water. Other chemical reagents, including Nickel chloride (NiCl2·6H2O, 98%), lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O; 96%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH; 96%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4; 96%), were obtained from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., China."
3,Preparation of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst The alloy catalyst used in this work was prepared by a chemical reduction method. Typically, a solution of 0.6 M nickel ions was prepared using NiCl2·6H2O as the precursor, and then La(NO3)3·6H2O (The quantity of La in Ni-La-B catalyst was specified at 5 mol% loading level of Ni) was added into the solution, forming the mixed solution. A 0.6 M NaBH4 solution was then prepared, whose pH was adjusted by NaOH solution to about 12. The nickel ions in the mixed solution were reduced by adding the NaBH4 solution slowly in an ice-water bath. The molar ratio of Ni to B was 1:2, which would ensure all the nickel ions could be reduced. Subsequently, the black precipitate was formed in the reaction system and was washed with distilled water and ethanol. Finally, the obtained catalyst (labeled as Ni-La-B) was stored in absolute ethanol."
4,Hydrogenation of FAMEs,"2.3 Hydrogenation of FAMEs The hydrogenation of FAMEs was performed in a three-neck glass flask with 250-ml capacity in a thermostat water bath. A NaBH4 solution was prepared by dissolving a certain amount of NaBH4 in the water, whose pH was adjusted to about 12 using NaOH. 7 g of FAMEs and the obtained NaBH4 solution were put in the three-neck glass flask. Afterward, a certain dosage of Ni-La-B catalyst was successively added to the flask. After the addition of all reactants, the flask was firmly sealed using rubber plugs. The sealed flask was placed in the thermostat water bath with a self-programming temperature control system. The mixtures in the sealed flask were stirred using a magnetic stirrer installed at the bottom of the thermostat water bath. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed by centrifuging. And then, the upper oil phase was separated from the lower aqueous phase. The tiny amount of water in the oil sample was evaporated at 105 °C for 3 h. Finally, the hydrogenated FAMEs sample was ready to be analyzed. In our work, each experiment of the hydrogenation reaction was done in duplicate or triplicate, and the final result was averaged."
5,Analysis of FAMEs,"2.4 Analysis of FAMEs The compositions of raw FAMEs (before hydrogenation) and hydrogenated FAMEs were determined using gas chromatography (GC-FID;1690A; Kexiao experimental instrument co., Led, Hangzhou, China) equipped an AT.SE-30 (30 m × 320 μm × 0.5 μm) capillary column. The injector ports and the detector of GC-FID were held at 260 °C. The oven temperature of GC was initially set at 60 °C. After an isothermal period of 3 min, the oven temperature was increased to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and then held for 5 min. Finally, the oven temperature was increased to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and further held for 15 min. [18]. The samples in the experiment were analyzed in triplicate, and the standard deviation was less than 5%. The iodine value (IV) is a measure of the unsaturation of a material. The iodine value of each hydrogenated FAMEs was calculated using Equation (1), according to the American Oil Chemist Society (AOCS) Official Method [24]. (1) IV = S a i × f i where ai represents the mass fraction of the ith FAME and fi represents the impact factor of the ith FAME. The impact factors of each FAME composition, obtained via AOCS Official method, are listed in Table 1 . Oxidation stability (OS) of FAMEs were predicted using Analyzer software [25–29]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of catalyst loading on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs,"3.1 Effect of catalyst loading on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs The catalyst loading plays a very important role in the progress of the chemical reaction. To evaluate the effect of catalyst loading on the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs, hydrogenation experiments were investigated with different catalyst loading (wt.%, based on the mass of FAMEs), and the other reaction conditions were as follows: sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g, water quantity 40 g, reaction temperature 85 °C, and reaction time 150 min. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 , with the increase of catalyst loading, both the content of C18:2 and the iodine value of FAMEs declined till catalyst loading of 10 wt%. In comparison with the C18:2 content of raw FAMEs (78.32 wt%), the C18:2 content of FAMEs only decreased to 76.61 wt% in the hydrogenation reaction without the catalyst. It showed that the hydrogenation reaction almost could not occur without the catalyst. When the catalyst loading was 10 wt%, the C18:2 content of FAMEs decreased to 9.17 wt%, and the conversion ratio of C18:2 (CRC182) increased to 88.29%. The CRC182 obtained at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% increased to 94.34%. As shown in Fig. 1(b), when the catalyst loading was over 10 wt%, the further increase in catalyst loading to 14 wt% did not have a significant impact on the reaction of C18:2 conversion. Besides, Fig. 1(a) showed that with the increase of catalyst loading from 6 to 10 wt%, the C18:0 content of FAMEs increased very slowly. Compared with the C18:0 content of 14.09 wt% at the catalyst loading of 6 wt%, the C18:0 content only increased to 18.76 wt% when the catalyst loading was 10 wt%. However, the C18:0 content increased quickly in the range of catalyst loading > 10 wt%. The content of C18:0 using catalyst loading of 14 wt% was 36.09 wt%. As mentioned above, more C18:0 generated at a high catalyst loading, which was against the cold flow property. The deep hydrogenation that happened at the high catalyst loading should be controlled during the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs. Moreover, it was observed from Table 2 that the iodine value was declined as the catalyst loading increases, demonstrating that the unsaturation degree of FAMEs decreased. Considering the results, the catalyst loading of 10 wt% could be regarded as the optimum."
8,Effect of reaction time on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs,"3.2 Effect of reaction time on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs The hydrogenation of FAMEs was conducted with catalyst loading 10 wt%, sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g, water quantity 40 g, and reaction temperature 85 °C. The change of composition in FAMEs, in terms of the C18:0, cis-C18:1, trans-C18:1 and C18:2 levels, during hydrogenation reaction is presented in Fig. 2 . The C18:2 content of FAMEs was rapidly decreased with time during hydrogenation. Meanwhile, both t-C18:1 and C18:0 contents increased gradually with time. As for the c-C18:1 composition, the content reached a maximum value of 27.47 wt% at 90 min, and then declined slightly after 90 min. Moreover, as shown in Table 3 , the iodine value of FAMEs was diminished as the reaction time increased from 30 to 150 min, demonstrating that the saturation degree of FAMEs increased gradually with the hydrogenation time. For the hydrogenated FAMEs at 150 min, a comparatively high c-C18:1 content (25.86 wt%; the maximum was 27.47 wt% at 90 min) was successfully obtained even under the highest conversion of C18:2 (88.30%; however, 69.70% at 90 min). Hence, 150 min could be regarded as the optimum reaction time."
9,Effect of reaction temperature on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs To study the effect of reaction temperature on the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs, hydrogenation experiments were investigated in the temperature range from 55 °C to 95 °C under the conditions as follows: sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g, water quantity 40 g, catalyst loading 10 wt%, and reaction time 150 min. An increase in temperature increased the reaction rates. Moreover, the temperature could affect the cis–trans selectivity in the hydrogenation reaction. It was observed from Fig. 3 and Table 4 that with the increase of reaction temperature, the C18:2 content of FAMEs decreased, while the C18:0 content increased. In comparison with the initial C18:2 content of 78.32 wt% in the raw FAMEs, the C18:2 content of FAMEs hydrogenated at 95 °C decreased to 9.12 wt%. However, the C18:0 content of FAMEs hydrogenated at 95 °C increased from 0.83 wt% of raw FAMEs to 27.2 wt%, and the t-C18:1 content increased from 2.29 wt% of raw FAMEs to 41.39 wt%. The CRC182 obviously increased as the reaction temperature increased from 55 °C until 85 °C. However, compared with the CRC182 obtained at 85 °C, the CRC182 at 95 °C remained almost unchanged. Moreover, as shown in Table 4, it was found that with the reaction temperature increase from 55 °C to 95 °C, the iodine value of FAMEs decreased from 110.49 to 67.99. The above analysis showed that the increase of temperature contributed to the hydrogenation of FAMEs. Moreover, it was also found that the low selectivity toward c-C18:1 appeared at the high temperature. This was attributed to the fact that the cis-isomer is isomerized to the more thermodynamically stable trans-isomer [18,30]. Hence, to obtain high hydrogenation of C18:2 and high content of c-C18:1, 85 °C could be regarded as the optimum reaction temperature."
10,Effect of hydrogen donor amount on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs,"3.4 Effect of hydrogen donor amount on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs Sodium borohydride, as a hydrogen storage material, tends to hydrolyze and releases hydrogen gas in the water. Thus, the sodium borohydride amount is a key factor in the progress of hydrogenation reaction, especially considering the solubility in water which decides the availability of sodium borohydride participating in the reaction [20]. With catalyst loading 10 wt%, reaction time 150 min, water quantity 40 g and reaction temperature 85 °C, the effect of hydrogen donor amount on the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs was investigated by conducting reactions at different sodium borohydride amount. The results are represented in Fig. 4 and Table 5 . It was observed that as sodium borohydride amount increased from 0 to 1.14 g, the C18:2 content decreased from 67.52 to 9.17 wt%, and correspondingly, the CRC182 increased from 13.79% to 88.02%. Table 5 showed there was a decline in the iodine value of FAMEs with the increase of sodium borohydride amount. It indicated that the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs at the sodium borohydride amount of 1.14 g, was more efficient. However, at the sodium borohydride amount of 0.38 g, which was the stoichiometrically required amount for the theoretical hydrogenation of C18:2 to C18:1, CRC182 only reached 59.07%. Therefore, an excess amount of sodium borohydride was needed, which helped to complete the conversion of C18:2 in FAMEs. Compared with the C18:2 content of FAMEs hydrogenated by 0.38 g of sodium borohydride (32.06 wt%), the C18:2 content of FAMEs hydrogenated by 1.14 g of sodium borohydride decreased to 9.17 wt%. The IVof FAMEs reduced to 75.05 at the sodium borohydride amount of 1.14 g. Thus, the sodium borohydride amount of 1.14 g could be regarded as the optimum."
11,Effect of water quantity on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs,"3.5 Effect of water quantity on partial hydrogenation of FAMEs With catalyst loading 10 wt%, reaction time 150 min, sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g and reaction temperature 85 °C, the effect of water quantity on the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs was investigated. It was seen from Fig. 5 that as the water quantity increased from 20 to 100 g, the C18:2 content of FAMEs decreased. When the water quantity reached 100 g, the content of C18:2 decreased from 78.32 wt% of raw FAMEs to 3.61 wt%, and the CRC182 reached 95.4%. As shown in Table 6 , as the water quantity increased from 20 to 100 g, the iodine value was gradually decreased from 102.77 to 68.31, which indicated that the unsaturation degree of hydrogenated FAMEs decreased. When hydrogenation reaction is performed using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor in an aqueous solution, water is involved in the reaction as represented by the following Equations ((2) and (3)): (2) BH4 - + 2H2O + 4Ni → 4H-Ni-H + BO2 - (3) BH4 - + 2H2O → BO2 - + 4H2 Under the action of catalyst, the sodium borohydride was hydrolyzed to produce H-Ni-H active intermediate and/or hydrogen gas. Besides the direct generation of H-Ni-H active intermediate as shown in Equation (2), the H-Ni-H active intermediate could be formed indirectly via the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, which was produced through Equation (3) even without the action of catalyst. It should be noted that compared with the hydrogenation process using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor, the generation of activated-hydrogen (i.e., H-Ni-H active intermediate) in the hydrogenation process using H2 as hydrogen donor was complex. In the hydrogenation process using H2 as hydrogen donor, the process of generation of activated-hydrogen (i.e., H-Ni-H active intermediate) included 3 stages: hydrogen gas was produced by hydrolysis of sodium borohydride; the hydrogen gas dissolved in the liquid reaction system and penetrated the liquid film around the solid catalyst; hydrogen molecule dissociated to hydrogen atom on the surface of catalyst [31]. Moreover, using H2 as hydrogen donor, the direct dissociation of hydrogen molecule to hydrogen atom required relatively high conditions. As a consequence, the condition of hydrogenation reaction using H2 as hydrogen donor was restricted (high temperature and high pressure) [11]. As for the hydrogenation system using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor, with lots of highly active H-Ni-H intermediate, which was generated even under a mild condition, the hydrogenation reaction of FAMEs could easily take place. The above analysis showed that the generation efficiency of activated-hydrogen in this liquid system was higher than the generation efficiency of the hydrogenation system using H2 as hydrogen donor. When a small amount of water was used, a relatively high concentration of sodium borohydride solution formed, resulting in more hydrogen gas produced through Equation (3) in the hydrogenation system. Actually, this was adverse to the efficient use of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of FAMEs. With a higher amount of water, the diluted sodium borohydride resulted in a less loss of sodium borohydride in the form of hydrogen gas and a higher generation efficiency of activated-hydrogen through Equation (2). However, when water quantity was too large, the concentration of reactants in the hydrogenation system would be too low, and, to some extent, the excess water would compete with the hydrogen donor for the active sites on the catalyst surface [18]. Thus, a low reaction rate for hydrogenation of FAMEs might appear at a too large amount of water [32]. Based on the reasons mentioned above, the FAMEs hydrogenated at water quantity 120 g showed a tiny decline in the content of C18:2, compared with that hydrogenated at water quantity 100 g. The water quantity of 100 g was chosen as the suitable condition for partial hydrogenation of FAMEs in subsequent experiments."
12,Analysis of hydrogenated FAMEs,"3.6 Analysis of hydrogenated FAMEs For the sample of raw FAMEs and hydrogenated FAMEs at the optimum conditions, the composition and some properties are presented in Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 and Table 7 . The C18:2 content of hydrogenated FAMEs finally decreased from 78.32 wt% in raw FAMEs to 3.61 wt%. The c-C18:1 content of hydrogenated FAMEs was 29.83 wt%. The contents of t-C18:1 and C18:0 of hydrogenated FAMEs were 46.33 wt% and 18.64 wt%, respectively. The iodine value of hydrogenated FAMEs finally decreased from 151.9 in raw FAMEs to 76.1, indicating that the unsaturation degree of hydrogenated FAMEs decreased. It showed that a favorable hydrogenated effect were achieved in the hydrogenation reaction using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor. Moreover, based on the compositions of FAMEs, oxidative stability of FAMEs were predicted. The raw FAMEs had low oxidative stability (4.10 h) owing to the high C18:2 content. However, the hydrogenated FAMEs showed high oxidative stability of 35.32 h, which was due to the high conversion ratio of C18:2 during the partial hydrogenation. In a word, the oxidative stability of FAMEs were significantly improved with this facile method of hydrogenation, namely using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor."
13,Evaluation of the technology for hydrogenation,"3.7 Evaluation of the technology for hydrogenation Some reported results on the partial hydrogenation of biodiesel using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source are summarized in Table 8 . Commonly, hydrogenation technology can be evaluated from two aspects: catalyst and hydrogenation conditions. The catalysts used for partial hydrogenation of biodiesel mainly include noble catalysts (such as Pd, Pt) and non-noble catalysts (e.g. Ni). Noble catalyst, especially Pd, exhibits more excellent catalytic performance than the non-noble catalyst in the partial hydrogenation of biodiesel. As shown in Table 8, when the Pd catalyst was used in the hydrogenation of biodiesel, different from the Pt and Ni catalysts, the oxidative stability has been significantly increased. It was further found from Table 8 that, for the partial hydrogenation of biodiesel using H2 as hydrogen source, the oxidative stability of hydrogenated biodiesel catalyzed by Ni catalysts was lower than hydrogenated biodiesel using Ni-La-B non-noble catalysts. Moreover, the hydrogenation technology using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source was the most widely used method for partial hydrogenation of biodiesel. However, this hydrogenation technology needs pressure vessels with a complex production process, which is due to the high hydrogen pressure needed for hydrogenation (even 4 bar under high temperature). Compared with hydrogenation technology using H2 as hydrogen source, the hydrogenation of biodiesel using NaBH4 as hydrogen source had the advantages of simple equipment and mild reaction conditions. Partial hydrogenation of biodiesel using NaBH4 instead of H2 as hydrogen source obviated the hazards of hydrogen gas which had a high diffusibility and was easily ignited. As shown in Table 8, the hydrogenation of biodiesel using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source was performed in the reaction temperature range from 80 to 120 °C. However, as reported [35], even though the hydrogenation of biodiesel using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source could be conducted smoothly when Ni catalyst was using at the low temperature of 80 °C, the hydrogenated biodiesel finally showed a poor oxidation stability. In the present work, the hydrogenated biodiesel using NaBH4 as hydrogen source over Ni-La-B catalyst under a low reaction temperature exhibited excellent oxidation stability."
14,Contribution function of generated H2 on partial hydrogenation and reaction mechanism,"3.8 Contribution function of generated H2 on partial hydrogenation and reaction mechanism Hydrogen gas was found to be present in the partial hydrogenation system using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor. The reasons for hydrogen gas existence were as follows: (1) hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of sodium borohydride, to some extent even without the catalyst; (2) self-combination of activated-hydrogen on the catalysts before hydrogenation reaction of FAMEs. However, it should be pointed out that the generated H2 might play some roles as hydrogen donor in the partial hydrogenation reaction. To explore the contribution function of generated H2 in the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs, an open system of partial hydrogenation reaction with different water quantity, which was without generated H2 because of the easy escape of hydrogen gas, was carried out under the condition as follows: sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g, catalyst loading 10 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, and reaction time 150 min. The results, including the closed system under the same conditions (same as in Fig. 5(b)), are shown in Fig. 8 . Compared with the CRC182 in the closed system, the CRC182 in the open system showed a slight decrease, indicating that the generated H2 did participate in the hydrogenation of FAMEs. However, in comparison with that of the open system at different water quantity, the CRC182 of the closed system was only increased by about 3.15–8.45%. Through the above analysis, it was safely concluded that the hydrogenation of FAMEs in this system mainly resulted from the direct generation of activated-hydrogen from BH4 - and H2O (via Equation (2)), and the indirectly formed activated-hydrogen from generated H2 made a very weak contribution to the hydrogenation of FAMEs. As found in the present work, catalyst, hydrogen donor and water all played very important roles in deciding the progress of partial hydrogenation for FAMEs. When the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs was performed using Ni-La-B as catalyst, hydrogenation reaction took place in the active sites of Ni component, which had the function of hydrogen activation. Hydrogen donor was adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst for hydrogen-donation to FAMEs. Moreover, it should be noted that, as found in Section 3.6, the water, as both solvent and reactant, could affect the supply of hydrogen donor in the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs. During the reaction, sodium borohydride and FAMEs were adsorbed on Ni-La-B catalyst [37]. Then active intermediate (H-Ni-H) was generated through the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride in the presence of catalysts (Path 1 in Fig. 9 ). An adsorption reaction took place between the H-Ni-H and the C = C double bond of FAMEs. The adsorption of C = C group on the Ni catalyst followed a d–π∗ feedback mechanism [21]. The Ni active sites in Ni-La-B catalyst became more electron-enriched because of the addition of boron, which was beneficial for the electron-donation from d-orbital in the Ni atom to π∗-orbital in C = C group [21]. This would promote the adsorption of C = C group on the Ni catalyst. When the C = C group broke, the hydrogen atom in the H-Ni-H was transferred to the C = C group of methyl linoleate [37,38]. The methyl linoleate converted to methyl oleate, and then the methyl oleate desorbed from the catalyst. However, methyl oleate might not be desorbed completely from the catalyst due to the strong adsorption on the catalyst or the re-adsorption by catalyst at the high catalyst loading, which would lead to the deep hydrogenation reaction (as found in Fig. 1). Moreover, t-C18:1 was formed because C–C bond could be rotated in the process of hydrogenation, which was easy to take place in the high temperature (as found in Fig. 3). An important point to note was that H-Ni-H could be formed in another way (Path 2 in Fig. 9), which was from the generated hydrogen gas. Compared with Path 1, Path 2 was complicated because two steps were required for the formation of H-Ni-H. The first step was the generation of hydrogen gas, even little amount in the hydrogenation system using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor; the second step is that after adsorption of H2 on the catalyst, the adsorbed H2 dissociated into the active hydrogen atom on the surfaces of catalyst, and H-Ni-H finally formed, which was due to the activation of the d-orbital vacancies of nickel atom by the free electrons from H atom [31]. Based on the above analysis, the reaction pathways involved in partial hydrogenation for FAMEs have been summarized and presented in Fig. 9."
15,Conclusions,"A new hydrogenation way using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor was studied for the partial hydrogenation of FAMEs with Ni-La-B catalyst. The optimum conditions for partial hydrogenation of FAMEs were as follows: catalyst loading 10 wt%, reaction time 150 min, reaction temperature 85 °C, sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g, and water quantity 100 g. Under the optimum conditions, the conversion ratio of C18:2 reached 95.4%, and good hydrogenation effect was obtained. Moreover, based on the analysis of the hydrogenation process, it was found that the hydrogenation of FAMEs in this system mainly resulted from the direct generation of activated-hydrogen from BH4 - and H2O. The activated-hydrogen formed indirectly from generated H2 made a very weak contribution to the hydrogenation of FAMEs. Generally, this work showed the partial hydrogenation using sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor was an effective approach for the catalytic hydrogenation of FAMEs. In consideration of the complexity of the economic analysis of technology, which involves raw material, equipment, production scale, control conditions (process technology), and even geographic market, future research should focus on the economic analysis of this partial hydrogenation technology; furthermore, the performance evaluation of the upgraded biodiesel in the application is another interesting issue."
