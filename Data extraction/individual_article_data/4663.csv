0,Introduction,"The chemistry of carbon dioxide (CO2) has drawn widespread attention because of the possibility of recycling CO2 to produce methanol. The methanol production from CO2 reduction has been of high interest since methanol is a vital raw material for the petrochemical and chemical industries [1–5]. As such, several technologies have been proposed to mitigate the carbon dioxide environmental impacts, as it is one of the major “greenhouse gases” released into the atmosphere. There are two well-known approaches for recycling carbon dioxide from fuel combustion or industrial processes: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which is based on the trapping of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants and industrial processes, and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) which relates to the conversion of CO2 into liquid fuel, such as methanol, hydrocarbons, dimethyl ether, and so on [6–12]. Particularly, the captured CO2 waste can be a good strategy to convert CO2 emissions into valuable products, such as green methanol [13–16]. This strategy also brings economic benefits and has growing environmental importance. In this regard, the synthesis of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation is one of the most promising, effectual and economic techniques for utilization of CO2, and it can be key to mitigate the release of CO2 into the atmosphere, also contributing to meet high energy demands. Much progress has been made toward the development of viable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation based on combinations such as Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, Cu/ZnO/SiO2, and Cu/ZnO/ZrO2. These catalysts have low cost, high activity, and enable high methanol yields from the CO2 hydrogenation [14,17–19]. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 is the main industrial catalyst used to produce methanol from Syngas (mainly H2 and CO). However, this catalyst can be deactivated under the CO2 hydrogenation reaction conditions due to the presence of water generated by the parallel reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), which accelerates the sintering of copper catalysts [14]. Although other Cu-based catalysts are suitable for CO2 hydrogenation, an efficientcatalyst exhibiting high selectivity, conversion, and functional stability at low pressure (less than 50 bar) has not been developed yet, mainly for scaled-up production under industrial operating conditions. To further improve the activity of catalysts based on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2, which do present good activity for methanol production, several changes have been proposed, including morphological, composition, and physico-chemical properties modifications [14,20,21]. The preparation method has been found to play a key role on the physico-chemical properties and activity of catalysts. Up to now, the ternary catalyst has been developed by impregnation, co-precipitation, reverse co-precipitation under ultrasound irradiation, precipitation-reduction method, combustion, and sol-gel [21–26]. Recently, the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method has been shown to form catalysts with high specific surface area and improved catalytic performance when compared with catalysts prepared by the conventional method. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts prepared by the one-pot surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method followed by reflux, using Pluronic® P123 block copolymer as a surfactant, for CO2 hydrogenation. This article describes important novelties on catalyst design and advanced in situ characterization to elucidate the reaction mechanism and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). Despite the significant progress in the development of catalysts for CO2 conversion to methanol, experimental evidence that the synthesis of methanol from the Cu-ZnO-ZrO2-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation occurs by the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 into CO* and O* onto the catalyst surface followed by dissociative H2 adsorption is still lacking in the literature. In this study, the mechanism was investigated by a combination of in situ ambient-pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) with a transmission cell. The purpose of this research is to provide insights into the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism, correlating the activity with the metal support interaction of CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts prepared by the one-pot surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method using different surfactant ratios."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of catalyst CuO-ZnO-ZrO2-(o) catalysts were prepared by the one-pot surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method using 30 wt.% Cu, 15 wt.% Zn and 55 wt.% Zr. In this procedure, aqueous solutions of ZrO(NO3)2.xH2O 99.5% (Acros organics), Cu(NO3)2.3H2O 99.9% (Vetec), and Zn(NO3)2.6H2O 99.9% (Synth) were prepared, and then mixed with Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) Pluronic® P-123 non-ionic surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich) (molar surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr ratios of 0, 0.015, 0.03 and 0.06). Afterward, a 0.5 M aqueous solution of NaOH 97.5% (Chemis) was added dropwise to maintain the aqueous precursors/P-123 solution at pH 11 under stirring at room temperature. The slurry formed was then refluxed for 24 h at 110 °C. Next, the materials were washed 2 times with deionized water and 1 time with acetone > 99.5% (Synth) and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h. Then, the resulting precursors were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The catalysts were designated as Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o), Cu-Zn-Zr-II(o), Cu-Zn-Zr-III(o), Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o), where the numbers (I-IV) correspond to the surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratios 0, 0.015, 0.03 and 0.06, respectively, and (o) represents the one-pot method."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 In situ and ex situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) The crystalline structures of the catalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction. The ex situ diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ =1.5406 Å) radiation source. The scan was performed from 10° to 80° at 10° min−1 rate. In situ X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded during the activation process in a D10B-XPD beamline at the National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light (LNLS) in Campinas-Brazil using a Huber diffractometer, Arara furnace, and Cyberstar detector. The parameters were: 2θ range from 30° to 55°, step of 2.51°and 10 s acquisition time per point, radiation with λ = 1.54996 Å selected with a Si (111) monochromator. After performing the XRD measurements at 25 °C, the samples were heated at 10 °C min−1 in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (5% H2/He) at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 from 25 °C to 250 °C for 1 h and new XRD patterns were recorded during 30 min. 2.2.2 N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were carried out in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer at -196 °C. First, the samples were outgassed under vacuum for 2 h at 250 °C and then saturated with N2. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (B.E.T) method using adsorption data in the relative pressure P/P0 range of 0.05 – 0.2. The pore size distribution was calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (B.J.H) method. 2.2.3 X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) The Cu and Zn contents of the catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence using a RaynyEDX-720 spectrometer (Shimadzu). 2.2.4 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) Temperature-programmed reduction analyses were performed in a Micromeritics Pulse ChemiSorb 2750 equipment. 50 mg of the sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube reactor and reduced under 10% H2/Ar (v/v) mixture flowing at 30 mL min−1, from room temperature to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.2.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) The sample was macerated using a mortar prior to preparing the diluted sample dispersions in isopropyl alcohol. The dispersions were sonicated for 10 min and then dropped on a nickel grid. The samples were analyzed using a JEOL JEM-2100 (LaB6) equipment operating at 200 kV. 2.2.6 Metallic copper surface area The metallic copper surface area (S Cu) was evaluated by the N2O chemisorption method. The experiment was carried out in an analytical multipurpose system. First, 200 mg of the sample was reduced in a 1.96% H2/Ar mixture under a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 250 °C for 1 h. Next, the catalyst was cooled down to 60 °C and a gas mixture 10%N2O/He was fed at 30 mL min-1. N2 was then used during 1 h at the same flow to remove physically adsorbed N2O. A new reduction cycle was then carried out from room temperature to 250 °C with the objective of reducing the surface of Cu2O to Cu°. The copper metallic surface area (SCu ) and Cu° dispersion (%DCu ) were calculated assuming a N2O:Cu stoichiometry of 1:2 and an atomic copper surface density of 1.46 × 1019 atoms/m2 [27]. 2.2.7 Temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) CO2-TPD experiments were performed in the same equipment used in the TPR analysis. First, the catalyst sample (200 mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube reactor and pre-heated at 200 °C for 30 min under Ar flow (25 mL min−1) to clean the surface and then cooled down to 40 °C. Afterward, the catalyst was reduced with a 10% H2/Ar (v/v) mixture, flowing at 25 mL min−1, from room temperature to 250 °C at 5 °C min−1 heating rate. After reduction, the catalyst was saturated in flowing CO2 for 1 h (25 mL min−1) followed by flushing in Ar for 1 h. The CO2 desorption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) from room temperature to 800 °C, at 5 °C min−1 heating rate, and Ar flow (25 mL min−1). The number of basic sites was calculated by peak integration from room temperature to 250 °C. 2.2.8 Ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) XPS analyses were carried out on a commercial SPECS AP-XPS chamber equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 EP MCD-9 analyzer located at the Chemistry Division of Brookhaven National Laboratory [28]. The powdered sample was pressed on an aluminum plate and then loaded in the AP-XPS chamber. The Cu 2p, Cu LMM, Zr 3d, O 1s, and C 1s XPS spectra were collected from fresh samples under 45 mTorr of H2 at room temperature, at 250 °C after reduction process, and several temperatures (25 °C, 200 °C, 225 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) under the reaction gas environment, 30 mTorr of H2 and 10 mTorr of CO2. For data analysis, the binding energy was corrected by adjusting the C 1s peak position to 284.8 eV for each sample surface. The XPS spectra were deconvoluted using the Gaussian–Lorentzian product function. 2.2.9 In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The FTIR measurements were carried out on a VERTEX 70 Bruker FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Specac transmission cell and an RT-Dla TGS detector at the Chemistry Division of Brookhaven National Laboratory. The spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm−1, with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The sample (50 mg) was placed in a cell by self-supporting wafer and activated with a mixture of H2 (10 mL min−1) and He (10 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. The reaction was performed following stepwise heating from 25 to 300 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min for 45 min at each temperature stage using a mixture of H2 (6 mL.min−1) and CO2 (2 mL.min−1). After the reaction, the CO2 was switched off while maintaining the sample under a H2/He mixture flow."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic tests were carried out in a high-pressure Microactivity Effi reactor (PID Eng&Tech) with an inner diameter of 9.1 mm containing 200 mg (60 − 80 mesh) of sample diluted with 100 mg of silicon carbide, alpha-phase 99.8 % (SiC, Alfa Aesar). Before the reaction, the sample was pre-treated at 250 °C under H2 atmosphere flowing at 30 mL min−1 for 1 h under atmospheric pressure. Then, a reagent mixture of H2 and CO2 at 3:1 M ratio was fed over 5 h at 30 bar. All gases used in this work were of high purity (99.9998). The effect of temperature from 200 °C to 250 °C, as well as the space velocity effect (GHSV = 100, 200 and, 400 mL min-1 g-1), were evaluated. The exit gases were analyzed in-line with a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) equipped with thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization detectors (FID) and three columns: HP pona, Plot-Q and, HP molesiev. The CO2 conversion (XCO2 (%)), methanol selectivity (S MeOH (%)), CH3OH formation rate and CH3OH yield were calculated by the normalization method according to Eqs. (1) - (4) [29]. (1) X C O 2 ( % ) = ( 1 - F C O 2 ( o u t ) F C O 2 ( i n ) ) x 100 (2) S Me O H ( % ) = ( m o l s o f M e O H p r o d u c e d m o l s o f C O 2 c o n v e r t e d ) x 100 (3) C H 3 O H f o r m a t i o n r a t e = ( F C O 2 ( i n ) . X C O 2 . S M e O H . M W ( M e O H ) W c a t ( k g ) ) C H 3 O H y i e l d = X C O 2 x S M e O H Where FCO2 (mol/h) is the molar flow rate, MW(MeOH) is the methanol molecular weight (g mol−1), XCO2 is the CO2 conversion and SMeOH is the methanol selectivity, and Wcat(kg) is the catalyst mass."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Cu-Zn-Zr-(o) catalysts. As can be seen, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the monoclinic CuO (JCPDS 48–1548)) and ZnO (JCPDS 36–1451) structures were visible for the catalyst obtained without surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o). The catalyst synthesized with a low surfactant ratio, Cu-Zn-Zr-II(o), showed only the CuO structure, while the diffraction peaks of ZnO and ZrO2 could not be observed, suggesting an amorphous structure. When the surfactant ratio is increased, the diffraction peaks of the CuO and ZnO structures appeared in the XRD patterns of Cu-Zn-Zr-III(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalysts. The diffraction peaks of ZrO2 were not observed for all catalysts. To gain insights into the temperature effect on the polymorphic crystalline ZrO2 phases, the sample obtained with the highest amount of surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o), was calcined at 600 °C and 500 °C. As seen in Figure S1A†, the tetragonal zirconia phase was crystallized at 600 °C, whereas it was amorphous at 500 °C, and the diffraction peaks of CuO were slightly thinner when the temperature was increased, as shown by the CuO (111) reflections (Figure S1B†). This indicates that treatment at 600 °C was enough to yield ZrO2 crystals and stabilize the tetragonal ZrO2 phase. Table 1 shows the Cu and Zn contents, textural properties, specific copper metallic area (SCu ), copper dispersion and the number of basic sites of the catalysts. The sample with a higher surfactant ratio, Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o), showed the highest specific surface area when compared with the catalyst without surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o), 219 and 150 m2 g−1, respectively. Similar behavior was observed by Chu et al., 2013 for Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts obtained using tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a surfactant. The catalyst prepared with TEAH showed a higher Cu surface when compared with the surfactant-free catalyst [30]. The Cu and Zn contents in the catalysts were determined by XRF analysis. As can be observed, the real Cu and Zn contents were close to the nominal values. In general, the specific copper metallic area and Cu dispersion of the catalysts were proportional to the surfactant ratio. The increase in the specific copper metallic area suggests that the copper particle size decreased with the increasing surfactant ratio. However, the lowest amount of surfactant did not improve the Cu-Zn-Zr-II(o) catalyst properties, when compared with the catalyst obtained without surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o). Figure S2† shows the CO2 desorption profiles of the Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts. As shown in Table 1, there is a good relationship between the molar surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr ratio and the number of basic sites. This suggests that the presence of a surfactant during the synthesis of the catalysts influenced on the surface Lewis basic ZrO2 sites that can adsorb CO2. Fig. 2 displays the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distributions of the catalysts. As presented in Fig. 2 A), the isotherms were classified as type IVb isotherms with an H2-type hysteresis loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials according to IUPAC. The type IVb isotherm is characteristic of conical and cylindrical mesoporous that are closed at the tapered end [31]. An H2-type hysteresis loop is typical of solid with a complex pore structure in which network effects are important. This is characteristic of materials that consist of particles crossed by nearly cylindrical channels or made up of aggregates or agglomerates, consolidated and unconsolidated, respectively, of spheroidal particles [32]. As can be seen, the presence of the surfactant did not alter the hysteresis shape as well as the pore shape. As shown in Fig. 2 B), all samples showed a broad pore size distribution from 2.6 nm to 6 nm, characteristic of mesoporous materials, and a higher frequency of pores centered at 3.7–4.1 nm. The sample obtained without surfactant and with the lowest surfactant ratio, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-II(o), showed the same pore diameter size. This indicates that the lower amount of surfactant has no effect on the pore size distribution. When the surfactant ratio was increased from 0.0015 to 0.03, Cu-Zn-Zr-II(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-III(o), there was a shift of the higher pore size frequency to a higher size value (from 3.7 to 4.1 nm). The TEM images and corresponding metal particle size histograms of the representatives Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The catalyst without any surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o), showed an average particle size of 11.3 nm (Fig. 4 A), while the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst, which was synthesized with the higher amount of surfactant, showed an average particle size of 4.0 nm. This means that the surfactant favored the particle size reduction. This is consistent with the effect of the surfactants polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) during the synthesis of catalysts, as reported in the literature [33,34]. Chitsaza et al., 2013 observed an uniform size distribution in the presence of the PVA and CTAB surfactants and a decrease in the particle size. Cattaneo et al., 2019 reported that the increase of the surfactant amount during the synthesis of AuPd nanocatalysts decreased the catalyst particle size. To evaluate the copper, zinc and zirconia dispersions at shorter length scales, STEM-EDS and corresponding TEM images were obtained for the catalysts with 0 and 0.06 surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratios. It was observed that the addition of Pluronic during the synthesis does not induce noticeable morphological differences in both catalysts. This analysis also showed that the Cu and Zn oxide particles (represented by the scattered red and green spots) have an intimate contact interface, (the less bright region on HAADF image), while the ZrO2 particles, the main compositional phase in the catalyst, represented by scattered blue spots, is more concentrated in the edges, suggesting a lower interaction of ZrO2 with the Cu and Zn oxides in both catalysts. However, it was not possible to distinguish the individual Cu and Zn particles, which were partially embedded in the ZrO2 phase. It is also interesting to note that the samples were prepared by the one-step method, thus all elements can be present both at the surface and bulk of the catalyst. Thus, an intimate CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 interface is expected from this kind of synthesis. According to the literature, Cu-based catalysts with optimal metal/oxides interface provide superior CO2 activation and conversion to methanol [35–38]. Fig. 5 shows the bright-field TEM images, the corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the Cu-Zn-Zr-III(o) catalyst. The ZrO2 particles had a rounded shape and no electron diffraction by SAED was observed. On the other hand, the inset showed that Cu had electron diffraction assigned to monoclinic C2/c CuO (tenorite) (JCPDS 48–1548) and electron diffraction of Zn assigned to hexagonal P63mc ZnO (Zincite) (JCPDS 36–1451). The SAED evidence agrees with the XRD data (Fig. 1). H2-TPR measurements were performed to evaluate the reduction behavior of the catalysts in the temperature range from 100 to 400 °C, and the profiles were deconvoluted by Gaussian function (Figure S3†). According to the literature, the pure CuO reduction profile is centered between 200 and 230 °C with a sharp peak [39]. Therefore, the distinct consumption of H2 observed for all catalysts between 170–290 °C is characteristic of the reduction of CuO to Cu°. The curves were deconvoluted into at least 2 or 3 peaks (α, β and γ in our nomenclature) for all catalysts, suggesting two kinds of reducible CuO species. The catalyst without surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o), showed a very broad peak that was deconvoluted into two peaks (α and β), corresponding to 225 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the onset of the reduction peak shifted to lower temperatures with the increasing surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratio, indicating that the sizes of the CuO domains decreased from Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) to Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o). The peaks (β and γ) at higher reduction temperatures correspond to CuO with larger particle size, whereas the smaller particles were reduced at lower temperatures (α). There were two or three deconvoluted peaks for all samples, suggesting that there are different kinds of CuO species. The α peak can be assigned to more structurally dispersed CuO species interacting with the Zn and Zr oxides, while the β and γ peaks relate to CuO weakly interacting, or bulk-like CuO species. The peak shifted to lower temperatures with the increasing surfactant molar ratio, indicating that the CuO domains sizes decreased accordingly. There is a clear relationship between the copper surface area and particle size and the CuO reduction temperature. Higher surface area and smaller particle size favored the CuO reduction at a lower temperature [40,41]. This means that the increase of the surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratio increased the surface area and specific copper metallic area containing smaller particles that could be reduced at lower temperatures, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, no ZnO and ZrO2 reduction profiles were observed within the experimental range evaluated (from 100 to 400 °C). Figure S3† shows the H2-TPR profile of the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst over a broad temperature range, where it was possible to see the reduction of ZnO to Zn° above 400 °C. The same behavior was observed by Donphai et al., 2016 [42]. As observed by the reduction profile of the catalysts (Figure S3†), the crystalline copper structure changes under a reducing atmosphere. Thus, to further investigate these changes, the catalysts were monitored by in situ time-resolved X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) under activation conditions (Fig. 6 ). Initially, all the as-prepared catalysts showed the CuO structure at room temperature. However, when the surfactant ratio increased, the diffraction peaks of ZnO became sharper, indicating the growth of the ZnO nanoparticles and substantial crystallization. With the increasing temperature under a reducing atmosphere, the CuO diffractions peaks gradually disappeared and others related to a Cu° face-centered cubic (fcc) phase appeared at 2θ ∼ 42.1° and 50.9° (JCPDS 4-0835) for all catalysts. This suggests that the CuO crystallites were reduced to Cu° at around 250 °C. Moreover, there was no crystallization of the ZrO2 phase or reduction of the ZnO and ZrO2 structures during the activation process. To understand the interactions between the Cu, Zn, and Zr species, and their chemical environment on the catalysts surface in relation to the use of surfactant, AP-XPS characterizations were performed on the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) (surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr = 0) and Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) (surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr = 0.06) catalysts. During the measurements, the freshly activated catalysts after H2 pretreatment and those exposed to the reaction atmosphere (CO2 + H2) at different temperatures were evaluated (Fig. 7 ). According to the literature, the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 is ca. 933.5 eV [43]. The freshly prepared Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) samples showed the typical peak characteristic of Cu2+, with the Cu 2p3/2 peaks at 933.75 and 933.26 eV, respectively, indicating that only CuO is present in the catalysts. After the reduction process and reaction conditions, the shake-up satellite peak at approximately 942 eV was not observed, suggesting that the reduction of Cu2+ species occurred in both samples. However, the distinction between Cu+ and Cu0 species is complex because of filled 3d shells [44], thus the Cu LMM Auger peak was further analyzed (Fig. 8 ). To investigate the Cu+ and Cu0 species after the reduction process and reaction condition, Fig. 8 shows the XPS spectra of the catalysts in the Cu LMM Auger region. According to the literature, the Cu0 and Cu+ LMM peaks occur at ca. 918.6 eV and 916.8 eV, respectively [21]. Under the reaction conditions, both samples exhibited Cu+ features, which confirms the partial oxidation of Cu0 to Cu+ during the reaction. However, further studies are needed for proper quantification of these species by deconvolution of the Cu+ Cu0 peaks due to the overlap of the Cu LMM and Zr 3p signals when Mg Kα radiation is used as the source [45]. Fig. 9 shows the Zr 3d spectra of the samples, with spin-orbit coupling energy of 2.4 eV. The corresponding Zr 3d5/2 is ca. 182.3 eV [46] for both catalysts. The profiles of the samples before and after the reduction reaction were quite similar. The Zr 3d peak is very broad, suggesting the presence of different Zr species. On the other hand, the profiles of the fresh and reduced samples were quite different from the profiles obtained under the reaction conditions. For both samples, the spectra indicate the existence of only one kind of zirconium species (Zr4+). This revealed that the chemical environment of Zr was almost identical during the reaction, regardless of the temperature. The Zr valence state on the surface of the fresh catalysts was determined by the deconvolution of the Zr 3d peaks in the XPS spectra, Fig. 10 . It is observed that the Zr 3d core level for both catalysts showed two broad peaks related to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2. The curves of the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) catalyst were fitted to Zr3+ and Zr4+ species, with Zr 3d5/2 ca. 183.63 and 181.87 eV, respectively, with a spin-orbit splitting value of 2.2 eV. The curves of the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst were fitted to Zr3+ and Zr4+ species, Zr 3d5/2 ca. 183.89 and 182.14 eV, respectively. The Zr4+/Zr3+ ratio on the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst surface was higher than of the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) catalyst, Zr4+/Zr3+ = 2.65 and 2.36, respectively. This suggests that the presence of the surfactant helps to stabilize the Zr4+ species on the catalyst surface. The binding energy positions of the Zr3+ and Zr4+ species in both catalysts are in good agreement with values reported in the literature [47,48]. To confirm the presence of two kinds of zinc species (ZnO and Zn(OH)2) on the catalyst surfaces, the deconvolution of the Zn 2p3/2 XPS spectra was used, Fig. 11 . The core level obtained for the Zn 2p3/2 state was quite broad, and it could be deconvoluted into two components located at ca. 1020.6–1021.6 eV and 1023.0–1023.5 eV. According to the literature, the peak at lower eV is ascribed to Zn2+ in the wurtzite ZnO phase, while the peak at higher eV is designated to Zn2+ in the hydroxide form [50,51]. The same components with different peak area intensities were observed for both samples. It is important to highlight that the presence of surfactant in the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst helped to stabilize the Zn2+ species in the wurtzite ZnO phase when compared with the catalyst synthesized without surfactant, Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o), ca. 54% and 17%, respectively. To gain insights into the oxidation Cu state during the CO2 hydrogenation, in situ FTIR was carried out during the steady-state on the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) and Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalysts, and Cu pure as a reference. Figure S4† summarizes how the experiment was performed: I) under activation condition, II) cooled down to 25 °C, III) reaction condition from 25 °C to 300 °C, IV) under CO/H2 mixture, flow at room temperature, and V) subsequent switching off CO. Fig. 12 shows the actual infrared spectra during the steps III and V. This new finding complements the AP-XPS characterization and offers a key to understand the copper behavior under the reaction conditions. During the CO2 hydrogenation, CO can be formed by the dissociation of CO2 into CO* and O* (CO2(g) ⇌ CO* + O*) and then, CO* can be desorbed into the gas phase (CO*⇌ CO(g)) or it can be hydrogenated to methoxy species and then to methanol. According to the literature, Cun+- bonded CO (n = 0, 1, and 2) has an overlapping spectral range of 2110-2080 cm−1. Generally, the stretching frequency in the range 2220−2150 cm−1 is assigned to Cu2+−CO, whereas the stretching frequency in the range 2160−2080 cm−1 is attributed to Cu+−CO. Furthermore, when Cu° is highly dispersed, it can also adsorb CO at the same Cu+ frequency. However, these two surface species can be distinguished by a simple flush or evacuation stability tests by which Cu°−CO is easily removed [52–54]. The measurements related to step III were carried out as a function of temperature (Fig. 12). The catalysts showed a peak at 2077 cm−1 from 25 °C to 200 °C assigned to CO bonded both to Cu+ and Cu°. However, with the increasing temperature, the intensity of this peak decreased. At 300 °C, a doublet was observed in the 2025-2250 cm−1 region for the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst, which is characteristic of the CO gas phase [54], and this doublet with a shoulder at 2077 cm-1 was found for the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) catalyst. Regarding step V, it was possible to note a complete elimination of CO* adsorbed on copper, and only signals related to CO(g) were observed. To confirm if CO is bonded to Cu+ or Cu°, a new experiment was conducted by CO2 switching off (Fig. 13 A). The band at 2077 cm−1, after CO2 switching off, was quickly removed. This means that CO was not only bonded to Cu+ due to the fast vanishing of this band, suggesting the presence of CO also bonded to Cu°. The presence of these species corroborates with the AP-XPS data under reaction conditions (CO2 + H2), where the presence of Cu+ and Cu° was observed. Moreover, the oxygen (O*) generated from the CO2 dissociation is reacting with Zn(OH)2 and Zr3+ present in both catalysts, producing ZnO and Zr4+ species, as revealed by AP-XPS (Fig. 9). The identification of the CO2 hydrogenation pathway intermediates is key to control the reaction selectivity. According to the literature, CO is an important intermediate and the strength of its binding energy to copper sites can drive the reaction mechanism through different pathways. Strong binding energy favors the pathway toward the synthesis of methanol and hydrocarbons, while weak binding energies lead to CO as a product (by RWGS) [55]. To correlate the catalytic activity with the Cu+/0−CO bonded, the peak at 2077 cm−1 was integrated and plotted as a function of temperature (Fig. 13 B). The peak area can be correlated with the amount of interfacial CO-adsorbed Cu+/0- sites on the catalyst surface. Upon heating, the peak area decreased for both catalysts. This suggests that the occurrence of adsorbed CO* species in a faster desorption/reaction. At the same reaction temperature, 200 °C, the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst showed less amount of CO adsorbed than the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) catalyst. This suggests that CO* adsorbed on the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst surface was hydrogenated to a product faster than the Cu-Zn-Zr-I(o) catalyst. However, this evidence alone cannot be used to identify the products formed. The catalytic performance of the Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts synthesized from different surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratios was evaluated in the production of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation. Fig. 14 shows the effect of the surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratio on the CO2 conversion (XCO2%) compared to the equilibrium conversion from the literature [58], and on the methanol formation rate at 250 °C and 30 bar. It is seen that the CO2 conversion increased as the surfactant molar ratio was increased. The Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) (molar ratio = 0.06) catalyst exhibited the highest and close to equilibrium CO2 conversion (ca. 23%). This indicates that this catalyst is promising for CO2 hydrogenation. The increase in the surfactant/Cu-Zn-Zr molar ratio increased the methanol production rate. This catalyst, Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o), presented a higher copper metallic area, smaller particle size, and a higher number of basic sites when compared with the catalysts with lower surfactant ratio or without surfactant. Additionally, the contact time effect was evaluated on the activity-selectivity of the catalysts, as it is another important factor that affects the methanol synthesis reaction. It was observed a significant increase in the methanol production rate with the increasing GHSV for all catalysts. This means that shorter contact time is favorable for methanol synthesis. However, the catalysts showed a decrease in the CO2 conversion when compared with the catalysts evaluated at GHSV = 100 mL min−1 g−1. The effects of temperature and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the methanol selectivity and yield were evaluated for the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) (molar ratio = 0.06) catalyst (Fig. 15 ). This catalyst was chosen because it showed the best methanol selectivity and the highest CO2 conversion among the evaluated catalysts (Fig. 14). The products obtained from CO2 hydrogenation were the same, regardless of the temperature and GHSV: methanol and CO. However, the methanol selectivity decreased with increasing the reaction temperature. Also, there is a relationship between methanol selectivity and the number of basic sites. CO can be produced by the RWGS reaction, a competitive pathway, where CO2 is converted into two undesired sub-products: CO and H2O. The methanol formation by CO2 hydrogenation is an exothermic reaction, whereas RWGS is a mildly endothermic reaction [59], This means that the RWGS reaction is kinetically more facilitated at higher temperatures (> 250 °C), in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 15A). According to the literature [1,14,56,57], two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the CO production: a) redox and b) formate decomposition. In the first mechanism, a) CO is produced by the oxidation of the Cu° nanoparticles to Cu+ via CO2, while Cu+ is reduced to Cu° by H2, forming water (CO2 + 2Cu° → CO + Cu2O and Cu2O + H2 → 2Cu° + H2O). Yet the second b), suggests that CO can be produced via formate decomposition (intermediate HCOO*), that is, formate is decomposed into CO and OH∗ species, and then Cu° is oxidized by the OH∗ species. It is important to highlight that Cu+ and Cu° were evidenced by XPS analysis under the reaction conditions, suggesting that the redox mechanism can be considered (Fig. 8). To understand how the methanol selectivity and yield of this catalyst are affected by gas hour space velocity, three different GHSVs were evaluated (Fig. 15B)). The plot clearly shows that the increase in space-velocity is beneficial to the methanol selectivity. A previous study by Yang et al. 2010 [60], demonstrated that the competing RWGS reaction rate is faster than the methanol synthesis by a factor of ∼102 at 300 °C. However, higher GHSVs and lower temperatures (<300 °C) can be less effective for the RWGS reaction, thus increasing the methanol selectivity. High space velocities provide a short residence time of reagents, CO2 and H2, in contact with the catalyst active sites. This means that a short residence time decreases the CO2 activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion as well as a decreased methanol yield relative to the CO2 conversion. As expected, the results of yields relative to the conversion decreased with increasing the GHSV, Fig. 15B). The values reached for the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst were 7.9%, 4.2% and 4.0% for GHSVs of 100, 200, and 400 ml min−1 g-1, respectively. Comparing our result reached by the Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst with a catalyst prepared by the one-pot surfactant-assisted co-precipitation method [41], there was an increase in the CO2 conversion and methanol yield under similar experimental conditions, see the comparison of catalytic activity for selected Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts at 30 bar and H2: CO2 3:1 in Table S1†."
6,Conclusions,"All findings show that there is a structure-activity relationship between the CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity and surfactant molar ratio, leading to an increase in the Cu0 surface area, basic sites, and a decrease of particle size. Cu+ and Cu0 were evidenced by in situ AP-XPS and transmission FTIR analyses under reaction conditions, suggesting that the redox mechanism can be considered during the CO2 hydrogenation. Accordingly, the catalytic activity over the CO2 conversion to methanol can be influenced by a combination of Cu+/0 properties with ZnO-ZrO2 physico-chemical properties. The Cu-Zn-Zr-IV(o) catalyst, obtained from the higher surfactant ratio, exhibited the highest and close to equilibrium CO2 conversion, as well as a good methanol selectivity at high GHSV. This indicates that this catalyst is promising to produce methanol by CO2 hydrogenation."
