0,Introduction,"Hythane, which’s defined as a gas mixture of hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4), which has been an attractive alternative vehicle fuel since the 1980s (Energy, 2014). Most of the hythane production processes in practice are adding H2 into CH4 but having disadvantages of using fossil-fuel-depended H2 (Liu et al., 2013). Thus, since the 2000s, many studies have focused on a more sustainable process called two-stage anaerobic biohythane production, in which bio-H2 and bio-CH4 were separately generated in two digesters and then mixed together to obtain biohythane (Wang et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2011). However, due to the high investment cost and operating complexity, the practical applications of these two-stage digesters are still very limited (De Baere and Mattheeuws, 2013). Another approach for obtaining sustainable hythane was recently proposed since 2015 as the single-stage anaerobic biohythane production process with bio-H2 and bio-CH4 being simultaneously-produced in only one digester (Pasupuleti and Mohan, 2015; Vo et al., 2019). For this innovative single-stage biohythane production process, there are many issues such as the reactor design, reactor operation strategy, as well as the mechanisms of how bio-H2 and bio-CH4 were both retrieved without phase separation has not yet been elucidated. In dark fermentation, H2 generated from H2-producing bacteria (hydrogenic bacteria) is mostly consumed by CH4-producing bacteria (methanogenic bacteria) in a metabolic pathway called hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate CH4 (4H2 + CO2 CH4 + 2H2O) (Blaut, 1994; Ferry, 2012). Thus, to increase H2 concentration in digester biogas, some treatments are required to suppress the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Krishnan et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2011). However, an inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis might lead to a reduction of CH4 production since hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis maintains a low H2 partial pressure condition, which is essential for metabolic reactions of methanogenic bacteria (Demirel and Scherer, 2008; Koster and Koomen, 1988). Therefore, to achieve a desirable biohythane production in a single-stage digester, it is at most crucial to overcome the conflict of H2 and CH4 production that relates to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Many anaerobic digestion studies have shown a significant improvement in biogas production when use entrapped cells (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014; Touloupakis et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2006). Cell entrapment technique allows the physical confinement of microorganisms within rigid and porous beads, providing shelters for microbes while allowing the diffusion of substrates and metabolic products (Park and Chang, 2000). This cell entrapment might be a promising approach to reduce the tension of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis issues since it could help to physically segregate the hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria within a digester. The idea is to separately entrap concentrated population of hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria as respective hydrogenic and methanogenic beads which play their roles as respective H2- and CH4- producers in the digester. Therefore, the key to monitoring the single-stage biohythane digester would relate to the biomass ratio of the entrapped hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria. Base on the above considerations, a preliminary study using sucrose substrate was done to investigate the potential performance of entrapped hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria at various biomass ratios in single-stage anaerobic biohythane production. The prospect of single-stage biohythane production technology and the comparison with two-stage reactors were also discussed. This is the first study on producing renewable biohythane via an innovative single-stage dark fermentation system and having a new attempt of using a biomass mixture of separately entrapped hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria."
1,Materials and methods,"The main experiments were conducted in an order of (1) inoculum collection, (2) cell entrapment for creating H2 and CH4 beads, (3) cultivations of hydrogenic beads in the bioreactor, (4) addition of methanogenic beads and (5) biohythane productions at various biomass ratios of hydrogenic and methanogenic beads."
2,Inoculum and nutrients,"2.1 Inoculum and nutrients The inoculum for biohythane production were hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria. The methanogenic bacteria were a digested sludge collected from an industrial wastewater treatment plant (Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Corporation, Taichung, Taiwan). The hydrogenic bacteria were obtained by heat-shocking the digested sludge at 100 °C for 30 min to suppress the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Wang and Yin, 2017). To prepare the seed bacteria for cell entrapment, the hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria were separately cultivated in two continuously stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) digesters with 1 L working volume (a length/diameter ratio of 1), whose characteristics were described in Table 1 . After 2 weeks of cultivation, the suspended solids (SS) were collected to be used as the respective inoculum to create the hydrogenic and methanogenic beads. The substrate and nutrients used for microbial cultivation were (mg/L): sucrose 15000, NaHCO3 6720, (NH4)2HPO4 700, NH4Cl 850, KCl 750, MgCl2·6H2O 810, MgSO4·7H2O 250, FeCl3·6H2O 420, CoCl2·6H2O 18 (Lin, 1986)."
3,Cell entrapment,"2.2 Cell entrapment The first step to prepare entrapped cells, hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria were separately centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min with a Universal 320 centrifuge. After decanting the liquid, the microorganisms were re-suspended in reverse-osmosis (RO) water. This step was repeated 3 times to wash away all the media in the preceding cultivation which might hinder the cell entrapment process. Hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria were then separately mixed with κ-carrageenan/gelatin (2%/2% w/w) solution to obtain mixtures of hydrogenic-bacteria/κ-carrageenan/gelatin and methanogenic-bacteria/κ-carrageenan/gelatin with a final entrapped biomass concentration of 5 g volatile suspended solids (VSS) per L of κ-carrageenan/gelatin solution for each type of bacteria. These mixtures were pumped to drip through a hollow needle into a 0.3 M KCl solution to form the respective round-shape hydrogenic and methanogenic beads with roughly 2.5–3.0 mm in diameter (Fig. 1 ) (Chibata et al., 1987). The beads were immersed in a KCl solution for 2 h to strengthen their durability and then stored at 4 °C for usage."
4,Single-stage biohythane reactor and operation,"2.3 Single-stage biohythane reactor and operation Biohythane production experiments were conducted using an anaerobic CSTR digester with 1 L working volume (a length/diameter ratio of 1) (Fig. 2 ) at operating conditions of pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and temperature of 6.5, 48 h and 37 °C, respectively. The hydrogenic and methanogenic beads were mixed at 4 biomass ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1, which were characterized by hydrogenic/methanogenic beads in volume ratios of 100/400, 200/300, 300/200 and 400/100 (mL/mL) or in weight ratios of 0.5/2, 1/1.5, 1.5/1 and 2/0.5 (gvss/gvss), respectively. To initiate the single-stage biohythane production experiments, the hydrogenic beads were activated by a pre-cultivation in the bioreactor for one week with a continuous operation mode at pH 5.5, HRT 48 h and temperature 37 °C. The methanogenic beads were then added to the reactor according to the designed biomass ratios. The pH was adjusted and fixed at 6.5, and the biohythane production experiments started. During the biohythane production experiments, total biogas, biogas composition, total carbohydrate concentration, VSS concentration, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and intermediate products (acetate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol and butanol) in the effluent were analyzed daily. After finishing the experiments of each biomass ratio, the hydrogenic and methanogenic beads were collected for determining their “biomass losing rate” to evaluate the cell entrapment efficiency. The carbon balance was analyzed to further quantitatively evaluate the direction of carbon element in the system."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Gas composition was determined using a gas chromatography 8700 T with a thermal conductivity detector (detector, 40 °C; injector, 40 °C; column, 28 °C; stainless-steel pipe column, 1/8 mm ID*4 m; carrier gas, argon). Intermediate products were analyzed by a gas chromatography GC-14A with flame ionization detectors (glass column, 146 °C; injector, 176 °C; carrier gas, N2; integrator, Shimadzu C-R6A Chromatopac; packing, FON). Biogas production was measured by an LMF-2 wet gas flow meter. The gas volume was corrected to a temperature of 25 °C and a pressure of 760 mmHg. Water quality analysis was according to APHA for COD, VSS and total carbohydrate determination (American Public Health Association, 1998 The energy yields were calculated by Equation 1 to evaluate the energy yielded from H2 and CH4 gases (Nasr et al., 2012): Energy yield EY kJ/ g COD = ( HY × 12.8 + MY × 35.8 ) / 1000 where HY is the H2 yield (mL/gCOD), MY is the CH4 yield (mL/gCOD) and 12.8 (kJ/L) and 35.8 (kJ/L) are the energy contents of H2 and CH4, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Biohythane production,"3.1 Biohythane production 3.1.1 Daily variations of biohythane production Biogas is the most obvious product showing the progress of an anaerobic degradation. In the present work, the biogas composition was mainly H2, CH4 and CO2. Fig. 3 depicts the daily variations of total biogas, CO2, H2 and CH4 production rates (mL/L-d) at different hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria biomass ratios. In the phase of H2 beads pre-cultivation (days 1–7), there was no methane production (Fig. 3) and no significant differences in total biogas, CO2 and H2 production for each biomass ratio (Fig. 3a–c). However, after the methanogenic beads were added (day 8), the production rates of total biogas, CO2 and H2 reduced drastically and their variation trends were dependent on the entrapped biomass ratio. In days 8–12, the H2 production rates dropped down significantly, from 938 to 967 mL/L-d to 2–315 mL/L-d (Fig. 3c), which accompanied the rise of CH4 production, from 0 to 39–407 mL/l-d (Fig. 3d). This reduction of H2 production rates and the presence of CH4 showing the occurrences of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. In dark fermentation, dissolved H2 plays its role as a very convenient vehicle for electrons transportation (Bélaich et al., 2012). H2 is utilized rapidly in anaerobic metabolism reactions of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with 4 mol of H2 being consumed to generate 1 mol of CH4 and, therefore, H2 being scarcely determined in an anaerobic digestion environment (Ferry, 2012). In practice, common biogas sources such as natural gas reservoirs and bio-CH4 digesters have a very insignificant amount of H2 (<0.1%) (Speight, 2018). Interestingly, Fig. 3c reveals that H2 production rates were not completely suppressed (except for the case of biomass ratio 1/4) but dropped to a constant value which ascended with the increment of biomass ratio. H2 production rates dropped from 938, 967, 960 and 952 mL/L-d (day 8) to 0.76 ± 0.09, 64.6 ± 3.9, 218.4 ± 7.4 and 324.7 ± 3.7 mL/L-d (constant values, at days 12–22) at the biomass ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1, respectively. It is notable that higher biomass ratios mitigated the H2 consumption due to their higher concentrations of entrapped hydrogenic bacteria. This result suggests a possible strategy of managing the H2 content in operating a single-stage anaerobic biohythane production process via controlling the biomass ratio. In contrast to H2 production, CH4 production gradually increased after the addition of methanogenic beads (day 8) and reached their steady-state conditions after days 13–15 (Fig. 3d). This resulted from slow methanogenesis, which is known as the rate-limiting step in anaerobic digestion (Ma et al., 2013; Mahmood et al., 2006). The CH4 production rate increased markedly from 88, 97, 23 and 40 mL/L-d (at day 9) to 389.1 ± 5.6, 394.8 ± 6.9, 245.2 ± 3.9 and 110.2 ± 1.4 mL/L-d (constant values, at days 13–22) at the biomass ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1, respectively. Noted that CH4 production was more significant at higher CH4 beads concentrations (lower biomass ratios). As compared to H2 production in Fig. 3c, this result shows the inverse correlation between H2 and CH4 productions in single-stage biohythane production. An observation of the daily variations of gas production rates shows that these rates reached their steady-state conditions one week after the addition of methanogenic beads (days 13–15, Fig. 3). At these steady-state conditions, the total biogas production rates were 862 ± 18, 968 ± 47, 1003 ± 44 and 915 ± 72 mL/L-d and CO2 production rates were 431 ± 15, 484 ± 21, 500 ± 14, 459 ± 33 mL/L-d at the biomass ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1, respectively (Fig. 3a and 3b). In summary, the potential to stably produce both H2 and CH4 from a single anaerobic digester having entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria has been demonstrated. Controlling the biomass ratio of entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria is a possible strategy for managing the H2 and CH4 production performance. 3.1.2 Hydrogen content in hythane Since hythane is conventionally produced by adding hydrogen into methane, the H2 content in hythane (HCH, defined as H2/(H2 + CH4) ratio by volume) is concerned because it affects the heating value, NOx and hydrocarbon emission, engine efficiency and safety of a hythane gas when combusted in an internal combustion engine (ICE) (Porpatham et al., 2007). In most cases, an HCH range of 15–30% is suggested to be the most desirable for ICE (Akansu et al., 2004; Akansu et al., 2007; Larsen and Wallace, 1997; Middha et al., 2011; Ortenzi et al., 2008). As summarized in Table 2 , in the present work, the compositions of H2(%)/CH4(%) in biogas (during steady-state) as respect to biomass ratio of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1 were 0.12/44.1, 6.9/40.6, 23.4/24.5 and 35.4/11.8. Based on the experimental results, for yielding an HCH of 15% which falls into the aforementioned HCH range for efficiently operating an ICE, the biohythane production would be suggested to be operated at a biomass ratio of 2/3 (equivalent to 200 mL/300 mL of hydrogenic/methanogenic beads by volume, or 1 g/1.5 g of hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria by VSS concentration) at the microbial conditions of pH, HRT and temperature of 6.5, 48 h and 37 °C, respectively. In combustion utilization, CO2 is an inert gas balancing the heating-value of a hythane gas. The CO2 contents in the biohythane gas were 48.1–53.6% and were almost independent of the biomass ratio (Table 2). To assure a high viability and applicability of this single-stage process, a strategy to monitor the HCH should be established to maximize the biohythane production rate and the wastewater treatment capability while keeping the HCH in a favorable range. In this study, the HCH ranged from 1 to 75%, which escalated respectively to the amount of entrapped hydrogenic microbes (1, 15, 49 and 75% at the biomass ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2 and 4/1, respectively). This suggests a possible strategy of controlling the HCH by adjusting the biomass ratio of the entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria."
8,Liquid intermediate products in biohythane fermentation,"3.2 Liquid intermediate products in biohythane fermentation 3.2.1 Distribution of the metabolic intermediates Fermentative bio-H2 and CH4 productions are always accompanied by the production of liquid metabolic intermediates such as alcohols, acetate, propionate and butyrate. Therefore, the information of intermediate distribution would help to understand the performance of biohythane production. Fig. 4 depicts the concentration distribution of intermediate products at the tested biomass ratios. In dark fermentation, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) areformed during the generation of H2 (acidogenesis/acetogenesis) and are converted into CH4 via acetogenesis and/or methanogenesis (Ferry, 2012). In acidogenesis, butyrate and propionate fermentation types are widely known and their characteristics are: (1) butyrate type: a proper anaerobic process with the products of acetate, butyrate, H2 and CO2; (2) propionate type: a fail digestion whose products are mainly propionate with insignificant gas products (Cohen et al., 1984; Dinopoulou et al., 1988). Fig. 4 shows that in all the tested biomass ratios, acetate (250–302 mg COD/L) and butyrate (32–780 mg COD/L) were the main liquid intermediates, indicating butyrate fermentation being dominant. 3.2.2 Comparison of intermediates in single- and two-stage biohythane production As shown in Table 3 , it is noticeable that there are significant differences in total VFAs (TVFAs) concentrations between the two reactors of a two-stage system, which is quite comprehensible since VFAs are mainly generated in the first reactor and then consumed in the secondary reactor. Unlike a two-stage system, a single-stage system co-generates H2 and CH4 in only one digester. Therefore, the VFAs are simultaneously generated and consumed during the fermentation and their effluents are hence the net results of production and consumption (Total VFAs = produced VFAs − consumed VFAs). The TVFAs concentrations at the biomass ratios of 2/3 and 1/4 (418 and 358 mg COD/L, respectively) were close to those in methanogenic reactors of two-stage systems. This could be explained by the domination of methanogenic activities in the single-stage digester because there had more entrapped methanogenic bacteria at these biomass ratios. On the other hand, at the biomass ratios of 3/2 and 4/1, the TVFAs concentrations were 556 and 1102 mg COD/L, respectively, indicating a stronger H2 production and the less effective VFAs conversion compare to their counterpart at biomass ratios of 2/3 and 1/4."
9,Biomass loss of the entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic beads during biohythane production,"3.3 Biomass loss of the entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic beads during biohythane production Cell entrapment is to increase the retention time of the microbes in a bioreactor. However, cell loss would occur when the bioreactor is operated for a long time. In the present work, a biomass losing rate was used to show a variation of the biomass concentration and was calculated by Eq. (2): Biomass losing rate ( % ) = 1 - Biomas s after / Biomas s initial ∗ 100 where Biomassafter and Biomassinitial are the biomass concentrations (gvss/L) inside the beads after and before the cultivations, respectively. The biomass losing rates (calculated by Eq. 2) in the single-stage digester at different hydrogenic/methanogenic entrapped biomass ratios are summarized in Table 4 . As shown in Table 4, the biomass losing rates at the tested biomass ratios were in a range of −7.0 to 17.6%. The biomass concentration (measured by VSS concentration) inside the hydrogenic and methanogenic beads was shown to be significantly greater than its counterpart in the liquid phase. This data shows the potential of ĸ-carrageenan/gelatin gel matrix in preventing cell washout to maintain the hydrogenic/methanogenic biomass ratio during the cultivation. Though, as compared to the initial biomass in the hydrogenic/methanogenic beads (5 gvss/L), it is noticeable that the biomass concentration was slightly reduced during the cultivation. This could be explained by the high porosity of ĸ-carrageenan gel matrix when adding the gelatin composition, which affected the attachment of the bacteria on the matrix (Gardin and Pauss, 2001). Further studies are necessary to develop a decent cell entrapment procedure for a higher entrapped biomass concentration in single-stage biohythane production, especially for long-term operations."
10,Organic consumption during biohythane production,"3.4 Organic consumption during biohythane production 3.4.1 Total COD removal efficiency Biogas production indicates the progress of a biological consumption of organic feedstock. COD removal efficiency is a common indicator used to show the consumption of an organic wastes feedstock (substrate for microbes) in a biological system. Fig. 5 depicts the data of total substrate consumption and total COD (TCOD) removal efficiency (TCODre) at the tested biomass ratios in the single-stage biohythane production bioreactor. The total substrate consumption rates were at the same level (97.6–98.4%) for the tested biomass ratios. However, TCODre were 57.6, 65.2, 74.4 and 81.9% for the tested biomass ratios, indicating an increasing trend at decreasing biomass ratio (higher concentrations of entrapped methanogenic bacteria) (Fig. 5). This could be explained as the TCODre of an anaerobic digester being mainly influenced by its methanogenic activities, since the H2 production is theoretically limited at the level of TCODre 33.3% (Jiang et al., 2018). Such kind of relationship between TCODre and methanogenic activities level had also been reported (Koutrouli et al., 2009). 3.4.2 Carbon balance analysis Carbon balance is a common parameter used to quantitatively evaluate the direction of carbon element in a bioreactor. The conversion of carbon can be calculated by Equation 3: C T = C G + C L + C S + C U (Eq. 3)where CT is the theoretical total carbon in the influent (g); CG and CL are the carbon converted to gas and liquid products (g), respectively; CS is the carbon contained in the solids (g), which in this case, assimilated as the biomass growth in the system; CU represents the unknown carbon loss due to substrate storage and transportation. CS was calculated by the formula of microbial cells C5H7O2N (1 g VSS contains 0.53 g carbon) (Wong et al., 2009). CG (%), CL (%), CS (%) and CU (%) were calculated by the ratio of the respective factor to CT. Table 5 shows that there was no significant difference in CS (%) at the tested hydrogenic/methanogenic biomass ratios (34.9–39.8%). In contrast, the CL (%) increased at high biomass ratios. This was resulted from the fact that higher hydrogenic/methanogenic biomass ratio yielded in more liquid intermediate due to higher producer/consumer ratios and causing a shift of carbon balance to the liquid phase (higher CL (%)). The CG (%) at biomass ratio 4/1 was slightly lower than its counterpart at other biomass ratios, which could be elucidated by its low CH4 content in biohythane."
11,Applications of the experimental results,"3.5 Applications of the experimental results It is certainly intriguing that a stable biohythane production could be achieved in the present single-stage dark fermentation system simply by monitoring the ratio of the cultivated entrapped biomass of hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria. Based on the experimental results, one of the prospective applications of the single-stage anaerobic biohythane production could be realized as upgrading the existed CH4 digesters by adding entrapped hydrogenic bacteria to produce H2 from these digesters. On the other hand, the present results also can be applied to some proposed systems, such as utilizing a coir pith or a portable bulkhead to separate the hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria (Pasupuleti and Mohan, 2015; Vo et al., 2019). These show that it requires only simple modifications to shift traditional CH4 digesters into biohythane production systems which could produce biohythane having higher heat efficiency and lower pollutant emission during its combustion. In a bioprocess, microbes are the key role to degrade the organics and analyzing microbial community would help the understanding of metabolic mechanisms. Although the present work did not show the microbial community, there was a report showing that a biohythane production using sugar-based substrate was dominated by Clostridium butyricum for hydrogenic bacteria and Methanovbacterium beijiingense and Methanothrix soehngeni for methanogenic bacteria (Park et al., 2010). In our lab, the dominant hydrogenic bacteria and methanogenic genus were Clostridium pasteurianum and Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium, respectively (Lay et al., 2016; Vo et al., 2019). When testing real feedstock, it is better to analyze the original seed community. In cell immobilization, the present work used κ-carrageenan/gelatin. However, there might have some limitations such as the occurrence of sulfated polysaccharide degradation by some anaerobic bacteria in long-term operation, which fact might reduce the durability of κ-carrageenan/gelatin carriers (Van Vliet et al., 2019). On the other hand, the κ-carrageenan/gelatin degradation might possibly shift the system’s microbial community since bacteria consortium usually depends on feedstock. This is one of the limitations of using κ-carrageenan/gelatin carrier in an anaerobic system. Table 6 summarizes a comparison of biohythane production in single-stage with two-stage system. An observation on Table 6, it is known that the biohythane production performance of the single-stage digester is comparable with many two-stage systems (Cooney et al., 2007; Lay et al., 2019; Si et al., 2019; Venetsaneas et al., 2009). Though, there’s still a huge gap between this single-stage system and many optimized two-stage digesters (Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Kumari and Das, 2019). At the current state, single-stage system is still outperformed by the two-stage systems in term of energy recovery, biodegradation and system stability. Base on the results of this preliminary study, to put this single-stage system into practice some further works are suggested to be conducted. (1) Other important operation parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH and temperature should be studied for a system optimization to maximize production rate, COD removal and decent biohythane composition (Kumari and Das, 2019; Liu et al., 2013). For an example, adjusting pH to balance H2 and CH4 fermentation in this single-stage system might be a critical strategy because the optimal pH value for hydrogenic bacteria (pH 5.5–6.7) differs from that of methanogenic bacteria (pH 7.0–7.2) (Ferry, 2012; Lay et al., 2019). (2) Real feedstock such as food and agriculture wastes should be tested for feasibility demonstration and fermentation type determination (Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Vo et al., 2019). In this case, the variation of microbial community should be analyzed."
12,Conclusion,"The possibility to stably co-produce H2 and CH4 in an innovative single-stage anaerobic digestion (dark fermentation) system by using entrapped hydrogenic and methanogenic bacteria has been demonstrated. The biomass ratio of entrapped hydrogenic/methanogenic bacteria markedly affects the performance of biohythane production in a single-stage system. Peak biohythane production was at a biomass ratio of 2/3 (weight ratio 1/1.5), in which H2 and CH4 production rates were 64.6 and 395 mL/L-d, respectively, with a H2 content of 15% and TCODre of 74.4%."
