0,Introduction,"Chiral compounds are important synthons in the synthesis of numerous pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavors and other value added fine chemicals [1,2]. Strategies to obtain molecules having a single stereogenic centre have gained importance in drug discovery because one of the enantiomer having an effective therapeutic action, while the other isomer exhibits undesirable therapeutic effect or toxic effect [3,4]. A number of chemical and bio-catalytic methodologies are known in the synthesis of value added chiral compounds. Biocatalytic reactions have proven to be a promising green methodology in the synthesis of chiral compounds. Mostly, the conventional chemical synthesis use expensive chemical catalyst or transition metals and requires multiple steps to get the desired product, whereas using biocatalyst (whole cells or by isolated enzymes) the reactions are carried out in single step under mild reaction conditions [5–7]. The biocatalytic reactions show substrate specificity and the products obtained are in good yields with high enantio- selectivity/purity. Though, it is believed that biocatalytic processes are superior to chemical methodologies in the synthesis of chiral molecules, the use of the expensive co-factors (NADH, NADPH) has limited their scope for commercial applications. An alternative approach to improve the biocatalytic efficiency in the synthesis of chiral molecules is by immobilizing biocatalysts (cells/enzymes); that enable the re-use of biocatalyst, resulting in enhancing their ability to catalyze a wide range of stereo selective reactions [8]. Several chiral alcohols/amino alcohols are known potential precursors in synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. In continuation to our interest in synthesis of novel chiral molecules of medicinal importance using biocatalysts [9–11], the present study is focused on extending our methodology for a continuous process of chiral alcohols/amino alcohols which are known building blocks for various pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products. There has been an increasing awareness in the use of biocatalysts in the biotransformation of pro-chiral compounds to their corresponding chiral products with high chemo-, regio- and enantio-selectivity [12]. Bio-reduction of pro-chiral ketones to their corresponding chiral alcohols using whole microbial cell system is advantageous over the use of isolated pure enzyme dehydrogenases (ADH) as they do not require expensive co-enzyme regeneration system (NADH, NADPH) [13]. Immobilization of whole cells/enzymes demonstrate several advantages like easy separation of cells from the reaction mixture, repeated or continuous use of biocatalyst with enhanced stability and enantio-selective properties. Keeping in the view the pros and cons of yeast immobilization, we here in report the synthesis of chiral alcohols using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker’s yeast) immobilized over functionalized alginate beads to give optimum bead stability and no loss of enzyme activity with a potential for continuous process."

4,Synthesis of chiral alcohols using functionalized alginate immobilized yeast cells,"2.3 Synthesis of chiral alcohols using functionalized alginate immobilized yeast cells The fermentation medium, in a total volume of 1L, consists of 20gL−1 glucose, 20gL−1 peptone and 10gL−1 yeast extract, to this yeast cells were inoculated, followed by incubation at 28–30°C for 48h. After optimal growth, the medium was centrifuged to isolate fermented yeast cells, which were then washed with sterile distilled water. These fermented yeast cells were immobilized different alginate matrix i.e. a) Calcium alginate immobilized yeast beads and b) Succinyl modified alginate immobilized beads as described in our earlier studies [14]. The degree of succinylation was determined by the titration method as described by Wurzburg [15]. To the 4% sodium alginate/succinylated alginate solution, 2% (v/v) of fermented S.cerevisiae cells were added and the resultant cell suspension (107cfu/cm3) was extruded through a needle with diameter-0.5mm injector added as droplets into 2% calcium chloride solution under continuous stirring to get the calcium alginate/succinylated alginate-immobilized beads. Beads having a diameter in the range of 1.5–2.5mm were selected for subsequent fermentation experiments. Cell viability was determined by plate counts. The stability of yeast entrapped in the succinyl alginate matrix (beads) was measured as described in [14]. The binding efficiency of yeast cells in the alginate/functionalized alginate matrix has been confirmed by SEM studies (Fig. 1 ). To the above immobilized yeast cells (10gm in 250mL of phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), the pro-chiral ketones 1a–9a or azido ketones 10a–12a, (100mg/mL) each were added and incubated at 30–37°C. The progress of the reactions at different time intervals was monitored by TLC and HPLC. After optimal biotransformation of ketones to respective chiral alcohols the immobilized beads containing yeast cells were separated and reused up to 7 cycles without much loss enzyme activity. Thus collected reaction medium containing products was extracted with equal amounts of ethyl acetate and the products obtained were isolated and purified by column chromatography. The spectral data of all the chiral products synthesized has confirmed by literature [9,10,17–23]. Further the chiral azido alcohols 10b–12b obtained were subjected to hydrogenation by using Pd nanoparticles to obtain chiral amino alcohols."
5,Synthesis of chiral amino alcohols by using palladium (Pd) nanoparticles,"2.4 Synthesis of chiral amino alcohols by using palladium (Pd) nanoparticles The chloride salt of palladium used for preparation of palladium nanoparticles according to the reported method [16], In brief palladium nanoparticles were prepared by adding 50mg of PdCl2, 6mL of 0.02M HCl and make up the volume to 250mL with water to get 1.2Mm H2PdCl4 stock solution. The prepared solution was sonicated for 3h and incubated at room temperature for 24h before use. Add 10mL of 1.2mM H2PdCl4 to the 10mL of de-ionized water maintaining pH 2.5, by adding 0.1M HCl. To this added 30mg of PVP, the solution was heated upto 100°C for 1h by adding ethanol drop wise (10mL) the solution was refluxed for 3h, which resulted in a dark brown colloidal Pd solution. Thus obtained Pd nanoparticles were separated and incorporated into the hydrogenation reaction of chiral azido alcohols 10b–12b to give chiral amino alcohols 10c–12c as described in the literature [13]."
6,HPLC and GC analysis,"2.5 HPLC and GC analysis The progress of product formation was monitored by TLC and HPLC analysis. Waters C18 column (250×4.6mm) using mobile phase Actonitrile:Water (80:20) at 254nm and the enantiomeric excess (ee) was determined by HPLC using Diacel-chiracel OD-H (50×4.6mm×3mm) and OJ-H using mobile phase n-Hexane: isopropanol (95:5) and PDA Multi detector at 265nm, with 1mL/min flow rate. GC analysis: For determining the enantiomeric excess of products 6b and 8b, (SHIMADZU, GC-2010) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a HP Chiral 10% cyclodextrin chromatography column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm).N2 was used as carrier gas and a sample volume of 0.1μL was injected by using a split ratio of 20:1. The column temperature was held at 120°C for 1min and was increased to 220°C at a rate of 2°Cmin−1, and then kept constant for 10min. The temperature of the injector and the detector were 240°C and 250°C, respectively [26]."
7,Results and discussion,"In this study the optimum reaction conditions in the synthesis of chiral alcohols 1a–12a by fermented yeast cells immobilized on derivatized alginate beads found to be pH 7.5 and incubation temperature was 30–37°C (Figs. S1 and S2). The results show that maximum conversion of pro-chiral ketones 1a–12a to respective chiral alcohols 1b–12b was observed after 24h by fermented yeast cells immobilized on to the alginate and functionalized alginate matrices (Schemes 1–3 ). When compared to other immobilized matrices the succinyl alginate beads immobilized yeast cells has shown promising reproducible yields of 60–99% and high enantiomeric excess of 93–97% ee (Table 1 ). The ortho substituted compound 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propan-1-one 9b has shown lower yields (50%) and enantiomeric excess (>20%) when compared to para substituted acetophenones 1b–6b, azido ketones 10b–11b and meta substituted compounds 8b [1]. The progress of bio-reduction of keto compounds to respective chiral alcohols by functional alginate immobilized yeast cells was summarized (Tables S1 and S2). The absolute configuration of chiral alcohols 1b–9b and 12b was found to be ‘S ’ (Prelog’s rule) [9], [17–19], whereas 10b, 11b has shown ‘R ’ configuration (anti- Prelog’s rule) [10]. The functionalized alginate beads shown maximum bead stability without functionalized alginate bead degeneration and thus improving the enzyme activity and enantio-selectivity (ee) even after repeated use of beads in a continuous process up to 7 cycles, (Fig. 2 ). Where as in calcium alginate immobilized yeast cells, diminution of enzymatic activity which is associated with loss of cell viability or decline in intracellular co-factor regeneration (NADH, NADPH) cycle resulting in loss of stability of alginate beads, resulting in decrease in enzyme activity after 3rd cycle. The improved enzyme activity in functionalized alginate immobilized beads containing yeast cells, may be due to high amount of water/medium around the cavities of beads, which helps in maintaining cell viability and enzyme activity (ADH), and also takes part in the internal cofactor (NADH, NADPH) regeneration system via, glucose present in the medium [20]. Thus the results establishes that the succinic anhydride derivatized alginate beads provide better integrity and intact support to the immobilized yeast cells without altering the extracellular (ADH) enzyme activity, in comparison to conventional calcium alginate beads. Several immobilized methods have been reported for immobilization of baker’s yeast cells on different matrices, resulted in low yields of 70–80% and enantiomeric purity 50–90% when compared to present study [21,22]. The main drawbacks of all these methods were decreased in the enzyme activity and stability of immobilized beads after few cycles due to dissolution of the matrix support. Therefore, all these known methods have limited scope in scale up and continuous production of chiral intermediates. Chiral compounds 1b–5b, 7b are the important intermediates in development of various drugs and agrochemicals [9]. Compound 6b used as chiral intermediate in the synthesis of anti viral CCR5 antagonists [17]. The compound 8b has its importance in the synthesis of drug (S) − (−) − fenfluramine [18], 10b–12b are the intermediates for synthesis of drugs (R) − (−) − tembamide, β-adrenergic blocker, (S) − (+) − fluoxetine respectively [23–25]. This study was further extended in hydrogenation of chiral azido alcohols 10b–12b to obtain respective chiral amino alcohols 10c–12c in good yields (85–92%), by implementing the Pd nanoparticles≤5nm, prepared by ethanol reduction and the particle size along with distribution was confirmed by TEM (Figs. 3 and 4 ), The absolute configuration of the synthesized chiral amino alcohols 10c, 11c found to be (R) configuration and 12c was (S), these values were compared with literature values [23–25]. The chiral amino alcohols synthesized (Scheme 3), are the known intermediates/precursors of the anti-hyperglycemic drug R − (−) − tembamide, β-adrenergic blocker, anti-depressant drug (S) − (+) − fluoxetine, respectively. Thus the study highlights the use of yeast cell bound functionalized alginate immobilized beads, which are stable and can be reused for more number of cycles without degeneration of beads and leakage of yeast cells. The developed methodology has shown greater advantage in synthesis of chiral compounds over conventional methods in demonstrating the recyclability, easiness and the use of yeast cell bound functionalized alginate immobilized beads without degeneration of beads and leakage of yeast cells, followed by the use of palladium nanoparticles in selective hydrogenation to obtain chiral amino alcohols. Thus the process enlightens the scope in the synthesis of chiral alcohols/amino alcohols of pharmaceutical importance."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, a continuous chemo-enzymatic synthesis of chiral alcohols followed by amino alcohols was achieved successfully by using functionalized alginate immobilized beads containing yeast cells with increased efficiency and high enantio selectivity by improving cell viability and co-enzyme regeneration system. This green process developed also overcome the drawbacks like waste management and product loss and has advantageous over continuous use of yeast cells immobilized in alginate beads. The yeast cells show broad substrate specificity and it has been observed that electronic effects were not influencing the stereo chemical features and enantio-selectivity during the process of bio-reduction of the keto compounds. Thus, the method developed provides a green approach to ameliorate the efficiency of biocatalyst in the synthesis of optically pure chiral alcohols and has tremendous opportunity in developing simple, easy, inexpensive and scalable route in synthesis of chiral compounds of biological interest."
