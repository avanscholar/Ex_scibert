0,Introduction,"Packaging in recent times emerged as one of the largest consumers of plastics; accounting for about 43% of India's total plastic consumption (FICCI, 2020). The demand for flexible packaging is escalating; driven by increasing use in the food sector. The food packaging industry is continuously looking for strong, flexible, transparent films with excellent thermal stability and barrier properties. Petroleum-derived synthetic polymers have become the material of choice for food packaging due to their easy processing and low production costs. However, these polymers are non-biodegradable in nature, thus creating many problems concerning post-consumption disposal of wastes. More than 8.3 billion tonnes of virgin plastic has been produced globally since 1950, out of which 60% has ended up in landfills and oceans (Geyer et al., 2017). The annual plastic waste generation of India is about 9.46 million tonnes, out of which only 60% is reported to be recycled, rest 40% remains uncollected (CPCB, 2017). The increasing plastic consumption and poor recycling have led to an exponential rise in the quantum of plastic waste. The trend towards banning plastic products comes in the wake of growing awareness on the consequences of depletion of fossil resources and the serious environmental threat associated with plastic waste. A deep need is felt to look for eco-friendly biodegradable packaging materials with new functionalities as an alternative to petroleum-based synthetic polymers. Numerous efforts have been made for replacement of synthetic polymers with relatively inexpensive, biodegradable, renewable and sustainable materials. These materials mainly include the chemically synthesized biopolymers such as poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (vinyl) alcohol (PVA), poly (caprolactone), poly (butylene) succinate; the microbially produced polymers such as polyhydroxy-butyrate (PHB), polyhydroxy-valerate and the naturally derived biopolymers such as starch, cellulose, chitosan, agar, gelatin, alginate etc. and their blends (Sarwar et al., 2018). Among all natural materials, starch is a potential candidate to produce biodegradable polymers since it is renewable, biodegradable and abundantly available at low cost. Starch can be thermally processed to obtain thermoplastic starch using suitable plasticizer. However, the films composed of only starch have certain drawbacks such as brittleness, rigidity, poor mechanical, thermal and barrier properties; rendering them unsuitable for packaging applications (Azahari et al., 2011). On the other hand, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the most popular water-soluble synthetic biodegradable polymers with excellent compatibility, easy processability and acceptable mechanical and thermal properties (Samzadeh-Kermani & Esfandiary, 2016). The only limitations of pure PVA as a packaging material are relatively high cost and the low biodegradation rate (Yurong & Dapeng, 2020). Polymer blending is an effective strategy to eliminate the defects posed by starch and PVA polymers. It offers promising potential in developing biodegradable composite films with improved properties at a relatively low cost. PVA has different morphologies in polymer blending such as matrix, microspheres (Guo et al., 2018) and fibers (Zhou et al., 2020). The composite films prepared by blending starch with PVA polymer can fill the property-performance gap between biodegradable and synthetic polymers. In recent past, PVA has been increasingly used in combination with the starch for the development of potential biodegradable packaging material (Negim et al., 2014; Sadhu, Soni, & Garg, 2015; Salleh et al., 2017; Yurong & Dapeng, 2020). The excellent compatibility between starch and PVA polymers has also been reported earlier (Abdullah et al., 2017). However, the effect of starch: PVA blend ratios in the polymer blending process have not been studied systematically. An extensive study is warranted to investigate the properties of starch-based composite films incorporated with various proportions of PVA. Against this background, the present study was designed to develop starch-PVA based biodegradable composite films using the solvent casting method. The effect of polymer blending on mechanical and barrier properties of developed films was investigated. The soil burial test was also conducted to study the biodegradability of starch-PVA films."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (Mol. wt. = 1, 25,000 approx., Degree of hydrolysis: 89%, Ash: Max. 0.75%, Viscosity of 4% aqueous solution at 20 °C: 35–50 cP) was purchased from Laboratory Rasayan, S.D. Fine Chemical Ltd., Mumbai. Analytical grade corn starch and glycerol were procured from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., India. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plates were used for casting of the film solution."
3,Preparation of starch-polyvinyl alcohol (SP) composite films,"2.2 Preparation of starch-polyvinyl alcohol (SP) composite films The solvent casting method was employed to prepare SP composite films (Fig. 1 ). Based on the preliminary trials, some modifications to conventional casting method were done. The method involves gelatinization of corn starch in the presence of water and plasticizer. For gelatinization, 6 g of dried corn starch was added to 100 ml deionised water. Glycerol was used as a plasticizer in the ratio of 1:3 (glycerol: starch (dry basis)). The solution of starch and glycerol was stirred continuously at 1000 rpm for about 30 min. During stirring, temperature was increased gradually from 40 °C to 95 °C to induce starch gelatinization. To the pregelatinized starch, PVA was added in different proportions (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of starch weight). The stirring was continued at 95 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete mixing. The viscous polymer solution obtained was casted on a PET plate and allowed to evaporate at room temperature for a day. Further drying of films was done in hot air oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The films were then peeled off from the PET plates. Very good stand-alone films with average 100 μm thicknesses were obtained (Fig. 2 ). The thickness of films was controlled by pouring a measured volume of film solution inside the casting plates. The films developed were coded as S, SP10, SP30, SP50, SP70, SP90 and P. The composition of various films developed is given in Table 1 ."
4,Characterization of SP composite films,"2.3 Characterization of SP composite films The composite films developed were characterized for their surface morphology, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile strength, elongation at break, bursting strength, water vapour permeability rate, oxygen permeability, water solubility, and water contact angle. Biodegradability of film samples was also studied using soil burial test. 2.3.1 Thickness The thickness of films was measured using a thickness tester (Instron® Universal Testing Machine, North America). Five readings were taken at the corners and centre of each film sample and the average values were recorded. 2.3.2 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR analysis of films was done using IRPrestige-21 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, USA). The analysis was carried at room temperature with average true range (ATR) of 700–4000 cm−1. 2.3.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Surface morphology of composite films was observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (Philips XL30 SEM, Netherlands). The film sample was mounted on the stub and air dried before sputter coating. The dried film sample was sputtered with gold–palladium under vacuum conditions in order to improve its conductivity. The coated sample was then viewed under SEM at 10×kV accelerating voltage and 500 × magnification. 2.3.4 Tensile properties The tensile properties-tensile strength (TS) and percent elongation at break (E) of films were measured in accordance with standard method ASTM D882 using Instron Universal Testing Machine (5566 model, England) attached with 500 N load cell. The film specimens of size 2.54 cm × 15 cm were used for the measurement. The initial grip separation and cross-head speed were set at 50 mm and 50 mm/min respectively. An average value of five readings was recorded for each film sample. 2.3.5 Bursting strength Bursting strength of composite films was measured by Bursting Strength Tester (Universal Engg. Corporation, India), according to the method described by Sachdeva et al. (2017). The film samples were cut into 5 cm × 5 cm specimen size and placed in the ring camp without tension and fastened securely. The film specimens were subjected to an increasing pressure by a rubber diaphragm expanded by hydraulic pressure at a controlled rate until the film bursts. The maximum pressure registered by the gauge was recorded. Triplicate readings were taken for each film sample and the results were expressed in kPa. 2.3.6 Water vapour permeability (WVP) WVP of the films was measured gravimetrically in accordance with ASTM E96 method (ASTM, 1993). The circular film samples of 6 cm diameter were cut and tightly mounted on the top surface of special permeation cups (3.5 cm diameter) containing anhydrous CaCl2, using paraffin wax. After taking initial weight, the cups were kept in a desiccator in which relative humidity was maintained at 84.34% using saturated KCl solution. The temperature inside the desiccator was maintained at 25°C throughout the experiment. Weight of the permeation cups was recorded at an interval of 24 h until a constant gain in weight was attained. The quantity of water vapour permeated through the films is calculated from the increasing weight of the cups and was plotted as a function of time. WVP (gm−1s−1Pa−1) of each film was calculated by dividing the slope of graph by the total area of the film exposed to transmission. 2.3.7 Oxygen permeability (OP) Oxygen permeability test machine (Labthink BTY-B1, China) was used to determine the OP of the films according to ASTM D3985 method (ASTM, 1988). The samples were placed in a cell and oxygen was passed on one side of the film. Chamber humidity was maintained at 65% and temperature at 25 °C. OP was expressed in cm3/m2. d.105Pa. 2.3.8 Water solubility (WS) WS of film samples was determined by measuring the percentage of film dry matter solubilized in distilled water after 1 h of immersion (Rhim et al., 2009). A film specimen of 5 × 5 cm size was cut from each type of film samples. The initial dry weight of each specimen was determined by drying at 105 °C for 6 h. The dried specimens were then placed in a beaker containing 50 ml of distilled water. The beakers were covered with aluminum foil and kept in controlled environmental chamber (65% RH, 25 °C) for 1 h with occasional gentle stirring. The film pieces remained in water after 1 h were removed from beakers, gently rinsed with distilled water and oven dried to obtain undissolved dry matter content. WS was calculated by subtracting the weight of undissolved dry matter from the initial dry weight and expressed as a percentage of the initial dry matter content. 2.3.9 Water contact angle The water contact angle was measured by using a contact angle goniometer (Rame-Hart Instrument C., USA). The film sample was kept on the sample stage. The water droplet of known volume (2 μl approx.) was allowed to fall on the sample through syringe. The illumination lamp and camera were kept on to capture image of a water droplet within 20 s after deposition. The contact angle was calculated by analyzing the shape of droplet using drop shape analysis software attached with the goniometer. The images of the droplets and contact angle values were recorded from the software. For each film sample, total 10 readings were taken at different places of the film. 2.3.10 Biodegradability Biodegradability of films was studied by soil burial test according to method described by (Medina-Jaramillo et al., 2017). The desiccators were filled with garden soil up to a height of about 4 cm. The film samples were cut into 2 cm × 2 cm pieces and weighed and then buried in the soil to a depth of ∼1 cm. The desiccators were kept at ambient conditions (27±5 °C temperature and 70 ± 5% relative humidity). The moisture of soil was maintained by spraying water twice a day. The degradation was recorded at regular time intervals (7th and 14th day) by carefully taking out the film samples and gently washing them with water to remove adhered soil and determining the dry weight of recovered samples. Weight loss of the sample over the time was used to calculate the degradation rate of film samples. Visual observations were also recorded with a camera."
5,Statistical analysis,2.4 Statistical analysis Results are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation of triplicate analysis of all parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant differences were calculated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS version 9.4). Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was performed for pair-wise comparison of treatment effects at 5% significance level.
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.1 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The physico-chemical structure and intermolecular interactions of starch, PVA and their composites were studied by FTIR spectroscopy in the range of 4000–700 cm−1 (Fig. 3 ). FTIR spectra of pure starch showed a peak at 3387.92 cm−1 due to stretching vibration of –OH group. CH2 stretching and C–H bending of alkane group was observed at 2930 cm−1and 1333 cm−1 respectively. A peak at 1641.42 cm−1was seen only in pure starch due to the flexion of the –OH molecules of water, indicating hygroscopic nature of starch polymer (Ferreira-Villadiego et al., 2018). The transmittance band at 1205 cm−1was a characteristic of C–OH bending. The peak at 1149 and 1076 cm−1 were attributed to C–O vibration and C–C stretching of C–O–C groups of the glucose unit in starch. Pure PVA presented most characteristic peaks corresponded to acetate and hydroxyl groups. The wider band at 3296.35 cm−1 was linked to the presence of intermolecular and intramolecular –OH hydrogen bond (Mansur et al., 2008). The peaks between 3000 and 2800 cm−1 indicated the vibrational stretching of C–H bonds of alkyl groups. The band at 1732 cm−1 was due to the carbonyl group (CO) of residual acetate groups of PVA. The presence of hydrocarbon (alkane) in PVA was confirmed by the peak at1373.32 cm−1 (Maziad et al., 2018). Three peaks in the 1000–1250 cm−1 region were ascribed to the C–O vibration of C–OH groups. When two polymers are blended, the chemical interactions between them cause changes in their characteristic spectra peaks. Composite film samples showed absorption peaks in the 3300-3000 cm−1 range, related to the stretching vibration of –OH groups of starch-PVA blend. A band was seen at wavenumber 2930 cm−1, which was arises due to the C–H group present in the starch and PVA. The blending of starch with PVA polymer was also identified by peak showing bending vibration of the hydrogen bonding of –OH group at 1710.86 cm−1and C–O stretching at 1076 cm−1. Similar findings were reported by Negim et al. (2014) and Maziad et al. (2018). In composite films, the peak intensity of C–O bonds in C–O–C groups increased with an increasing percentage of PVA. The FTIR graphs of composite films showed occurrence of strong hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA and starch components. Both polymers possessed large number of –OH and C–O groups, which could form hydrogen bonding network; improving the compatibility between them, resulting in improved properties of composites."
8,Surface morphology,"3.2 Surface morphology The surface morphology of starch, PVA and composite films was studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) at 500× magnification (Fig. 4 ). Both pure starch and PVA films showed a compact surface morphology. Moreover, pure PVA films had smooth and flat surface as compared to starch film, indicating formation of highly transparent and clear PVA films. In some composite films, particle domains with diameters in micron range were seen due to a certain phase separation. As PVA content increases, starch polymer reversed to dispersed phase from continuous phase, depicting the miscibility of amorphous portion of starch with PVA. The indistinct interface between two polymers indicated the presence of strong bonding interactions. The fact was further corroborated by fracture surface analysis of composite films. The SEM image of a fractured surface of SP70 film (Fig. 4h) showed a compact and homogeneous matrix indicating the integrity of the film structure. Similar results were reported for polyvinyl alcohol/starch blend by Tian et al. (2017). The excellent compatibility of starch with PVA helps to improve the mechanical behavior of SP composite films, which shows an agreement with the results of mechanical properties."
9,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties Mechanical properties of packaging films play key role in providing a physical protection to the packaged food from external environment. The poor mechanical properties due to the amorphous nature are the main drawback of starch films, limiting their applications in packaging (Yurong & Dapeng, 2020). The effect of PVA incorporation on mechanical properties of SP composites films was therefore investigated in terms of tensile strength (TS) and percent elongation at break (E) and bursting strength (BS). The results are depicted in Fig. 5 . 3.3.1 Tensile properties TS is the maximum amount of tensile stress that material can sustain before failure. On the other hand, E is an extension under traction, reflecting the elasticity of a material (Silva et al., 2013). Results showed that the tensile properties of SP composite films were strongly affected by the blending of PVA with starch (Fig. 5a and b). Pure starch film presented poor values of TS (2.3 MPa) and E (27.4%), whereas pure PVA films showed excellent tensile properties with 17.9 MPa TS and 219.8% E. There was a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in both the TS and E with the increasing incorporation of PVA from 10 to 90%. In case of composite films, increasing percentage of PVA resulted in 1.24–1.93 fold increases in TS and 1.93–3.74 fold increases in E values over pure starch films. The highest values of TS (4.39 MPa) and E (102%) were observed for SP90 films. It implies that although covalently bounded, the polymers chains of the composite films retained a high degree of chain flexibility. The improvement in mechanical behavior of composite films was due to high mechanical properties PVA on account of its flexible C–C backbone and large number of –OH groups (Tian et al., 2017). High TS and E values of composite films may also be attributed to the excellent compatibility between starch and PVA polymer on account of their strong hydrogen bonding interactions. Our results are in line with the findings of Tian et al. (2017) and Asrofi et al. (2019), who reported that the tensile properties of starch/PVA blends decreased with the increasing starch content. The increase in TS of composites films can further be related to the dilution of glycerol concentration with an increasing addition of PVA in the blend. Several studies have reported higher TS of starch-based biopolymers when decreasing the plasticizer concentration (Tarique et al., 2021; Zakaria et al., 2018). 3.3.2 Bursting strength Bursting strength (BS) of packaging film is a measure of resistance to rupture and represents a pressure required to burst the film sample. BS denotes the overall strength of the film and is largely depends on the tensile strength and extensibility of the film (Sachdeva et al., 2017). The effect of polymer blending on the BS of composite films is depicted in Fig. 5c. From the figure, it can be seen that the pure starch showed lowest value of BS (191.2 kPa) amongst all films. The highest BS of 328.5 kPa was possessed by pure PVA film. BS of composite films increased from 220.7 kPa to 37.9 kPa with increase in PVA content from 10% to 90%. Overall there was about 1.15–1.72 fold increase in BS of composite films as compared to starch films. High BS of composite films is accredited to the highly crystalline structure of PVA. When blended with the starch, the structure of PVA triggers a strong dimensional network formation between its vinyl group and hydroxyl groups of starch (Asrofi et al., 2019; Parvin et al., 2010). Increase in burst strength of starch-PVA blends with increasing PVA content is well supported by earlier literature (Ramaraj, 2007). During blending, starch forms a continuous phase with PVA as both the polymers are polyols. This is believed to be a reason for the good mechanical properties shown by starch-PVA blends (Salisu, 2012)."
10,Barrier properties,"3.4 Barrier properties Barrier properties are of key importance for any packaging material. Packaging films with low permeability or good barrier against water vapour and gases helps to maintain the quality of packaged food during storage. The permeability of a film depends mainly on its chemical structure, nature of permeate and environmental conditions. The barrier properties of pure starch, pure PVA and SP composite films were studied in terms of water vapour permeability (WVP) and oxygen permeability (OP) and the results are shown in Table 2 . 3.4.1 Water vapour permeability The water vapour barrier is quantified by the water vapour permeability (WVP), which measures the amount of water vapour that permeates per unit time and per unit area of packaging film at given temperature and relative humidity. The WVP of films ranged from 2.11 × 10−10 to 6.63 × 10−10 gm−1s−1Pa−1; with highest and lowest being exhibited by pure starch and pure PVA film respectively (Table 2). WVP of SP composite films were higher than that of PVA film and lower than that of pure starch film. Results depicted significant (p < 0.05) decrease in WVP of films with increasing PVA addition. As amount of PVA in blends increased from 10 to 90%, there was about 31.1–52.2% decrease in WVP, indicating higher water vapour barrier properties of composite films. Polymer blending of starch and PVA caused changes in structure and composition of resulting blends, which could be the reflected in low permeability. With the addition of PVA, the weight of polymers increases in the blend, leading to a lower concentration of glycerol, produces compact and dense polymer structure. As a result, composite films presented lower WVP values and thus high barrier properties as compared to native starch films (Tarique et al., 2021). Moreover, highly ordered molecular structure of PVA polymer on account of its semi-crystalline nature and abundant –OH groups may have contributed to the increased polarity and crystallinity and thus decreased WVP of SP composite films (Gomez-Aldapa et al., 2020). The opposite trend was reported by some researchers in their studies (Han et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2017), wherein WVP of starch films increased along with PVA content. However, our results are in line with the findings of Gomez-Aldapa et al. (2020). Similar improvement in water vapour barrier properties of potato starch: PVA composite films were noted by them. WVP of composite films decreased significantly, when the proportion of PVA increased. Authors stated that the phosphate groups naturally present in potato starch may act as a crosslinking agent, promoting a better interaction with PVA. Similarly, Azahari et al. (2011) concluded that the WVP of PVA/starch films with high starch content showed high WVP as compared to pure PVA owing to the hydrophilicity of starch. 3.4.2 Oxygen permeability The oxygen barrier is quantified by the oxygen permeability (OP), which indicates the amount of oxygen that permeates per unit of area and time through a packaging material at given temperature and relative humidity. OP values of composite films with various proportions of starch and PVA are given in Table 2. Pure starch film had higher OP (14.6 cm3/m2. d.105Pa) than pure PVA and composite films, showing poor oxygen barrier property of starch polymer. On the other hand, pure PVA film showed lowest value of OP (4.84 cm3/m2. d.105Pa), indicating excellent oxygen barrier. Moreover, increasing PVA content significantly (p < 0.05) decreased OP of SP composite films. OP of composite films varied from 6.2 to 12.7 cm3/m2. d.105Pa, depicting remarkable decrease (13–57%) in OP as compared to native starch films. Maximum and minimum decrease was noted at 90% and 10% of PVA incorporation. Decrease in OP of composite films can be explained by the modified structure of starch-PVA composite matrix. As verified through FTIR analysis, strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymer chains of starch and PVA created a polar trend which consequently limits the permeation of gas molecules through the matrix structure, thus imparts high barrier properties to composite films (Gomez-Aldapa et al., 2020). Results show agreement with study where blending of PVA with chitosan reduced the OP of PVA/cellulose nanowhisker/chitosan composites films, which can be used as food packaging films with excellent protection against oxidation (Li et al., 2015)."
11,Water solubility,"3.5 Water solubility Water solubility (WS) of films indicates the amount of soluble matter after immersion in water. The results are demonstrated in Table 2. High WS values film samples were well expected because all the constituents including starch, PVA and glycerol had hydrophilic nature. Results are consistent with the other studies (Cano et al., 2015; Abdullah et al., 2017). Pure PVA was almost completely soluble in water, showing about 90% solubility in water within 1 h. Nevertheless, pure starch exhibited significantly lower WS (25.3%) than pure PVA film. The incorporation of PVA to starch films appeared to increase the WS in a monotonically increasing manner from 16.6 to 106% with increasing PVA content from 10 to 90% accordingly. A marked increase in WS of composite films at high level of PVA incorporation was anticipated as PVA is highly hydrophilic and sensitive to the moisture (Ali et al., 2017). Results are in good accordance with those in PVA/starch blends cross-linked with glacial acetic acid (Negim et al., 2014), in which solubility PVA/starch blend films was observed to increase with increasing PVA ratio. The presence of hydrophobic residual acetate groups in partially hydrolyzed PVA may hinder the intra and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between the adjacent –OH groups, leading to high solubility of blends in water. The similar trend was seen in blends of potato starch-PVA, in which combining potato starch with PVA resulted in more hydrophilic films with high WS, mainly because of the increased hydroxyl groups (Gomez-Aldapa et al., 2020)."
12,Water contact angle,"3.6 Water contact angle The hydrophilic nature of pure starch, pure PVA and SP composite film surfaces was evaluated by measuring water contact angle (WCA) using goniometer. Generally, low WCA (<90°) signifies high wettability and thus high hydrophilic nature of material surfaces. Whereas, high WCA (>90°) represents low wettability and thus high hydrophobic nature of material surfaces (Sadegh-Hassani & Nafchi, 2014). All film samples showed WCA values below 90°, reflecting their hydrophilic nature, which is concordant with the water solubility results (Table 2). Apparently, pure PVA, which is well known water-soluble polymer, showed low water contact angle of 55.4°, which is in good agreement with the previous reports (Lim et al., 2015; Abdullah et al., 2017). As illustrated in Fig. 6 , starch film presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher WCA (84.2°) than pure PVA film. Blending of PVA with starch yielded low WCA values as compared to pure starch counterpart, depicting overall angle reduction of 11.5–27.9°. The remarkable improvement in hydrophilic behavior SP composite films could be associated with relatively large number of hydroxyl groups in PVA, leading to the film surfaces with high wettability. Pimanpang et al. (2006) reported that water contact angle (WCA) on polymeric surfaces reduces due to increase in polar groups such as CO and –OH. These groups have the capability of forming hydrogen bond with water molecules which will result in higher wettability. From the FTIR analysis it was evident that due to blending of PVA with starch, the intensity of the hydrophilic groups such as CO and –OH groups increases which can be attributed to decrease in the WCA of the composite film samples. The findings are further coincided with the increase in water solubility of SP composites with increasing PVA content (Table 2)."
13,Biodegradability,"3.7 Biodegradability Biodegradation is defined as the degradation or chemical dissolution of materials by the enzymatic action of living organisms such as bacteria, yeasts, fungi (Negim et al., 2014). Biodegradability of pure starch, pure PVA and SP70 composite films was studied by soil burial test at ambient conditions (Fig. 7 ). It was observed that all three films samples degraded rapidly in soil showing very high weight loss. Visual observations showed that the complete degradation of pure starch films occurred in one week, whereas pure PVA and SP70 composite film took 3 weeks for complete degradation. Weight losses of samples were not estimated exactly because even on 7th day of burial, all films were disintegrated into very small pieces, with soil adhered to them. Moreover, samples were completely degraded after 21 days showing no visual sign of any film pieces. The results indicated that the blending of PVA with starch slowed down the degradation rate of composite film. The findings are well supported by the biodegradation studies of starch/PVA blends by Negim et al. (2014). The authors reported starch/PVA films degraded in 10–14 days in moist soil depending on the molecular weight of PVA. Rapid degradation of film samples owing to the high moisture content of soil, which increases the solubility of film constituents leading to high weight losses in short period. Biodegradability study showed a promising potential of SP composite films for development of eco-friendly food packaging material."
14,Conclusion,"Strach-PVA composite film at vaious bleding ratios were prepared by eco-friendly solvent casting method. Polymer blending seems to be an effective strategy to overcome the limitations of biopolymers like starch and PVA. The incorporation of PVA to starch significantly (p < 0.05) improved the mechanical and barrier properties of resulting composite films. Highest improvement in mechanical behaviour was observed for the SP90 composite film, having higher comtent of PVA. SP90 film showed 1.93 fold increase in TS, 3.74 fold increase in E and 1.72 fold increase in BS over pure starch film. On the other hand, maximum PVA incorporation resulted in 52% and 57% decrease in WVP and OP of composite films respectively, depicting good barrier against water vapour and oxygen gas. FTIR spectra and surface morphology of SP composite films confirmed the excellent compatibility between starch and PVA polymer. The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between hydroxyl groups of starch and PVA resulted in dimensional network structure, which led to enhanced strength and barrier properties. The films containing higher percentage of PVA yielded higher WS and lower values WCA indicating hydrophilic nature of PVA. Interestingly, SP composite films degraded rapidly in moistened soil within 3 weeks of burial. Biodegradability study showed a promising potential of SP composite films for development of eco-friendly food packaging material."
