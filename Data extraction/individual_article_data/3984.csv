0,Introduction,"Foam (i.e., liquid foam) is a highly concentrated dispersion of discontinuous gas in the continuous liquid and devoted to various industrial applications, such as in food engineering, froth flotation, and oilfield development (Bhakta and Ruckenstein, 1997). Due to the high surface area and non-uniform distribution in bubble size, foam is exposed with the unstable state in its liquid films and tends to separate into gas and liquid with limited time. Three of the most important mechanisms that govern the decaying kinetics of foam have been clarified: drainage, coarsening and coalescence (Hill and Eastoe, 2017). Drainage is generally described as the liquid flow from lamellae to plateau borders (or nodes) via gravity and capillary suction, which is a main factor results in thinning of liquid films and increasing probability of rupture (Bhakta and Ruckenstein, 1995). Coarsening (i.e., Ostwald ripening) is a process of the mass transfer from the small bubbles to the big ones, where the driving force is related to the Laplace pressure (i.e., capillary pressure) and the diffusion coefficient of liquid films (including type of gas) (Farajzadeh et al., 2011; Almajid and Kovscek, 2016; Stevenson, 2010). Coalescence refers to the breakage of lamellae between neighboring bubbles, similar to the coarsening, it is motivated by Laplace pressure, gas diffusion and film thickness fluctuation, which eventually leads to the decline in the foam volume (Zeng et al., 2016a,b). Since these three processes are interrelated, it is usually observed that they promote mutually and determine the lifetime of foam (J. Wang et al., 2016b). In the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects of oilfield development, that foam involved, prolonging or controlling the foam lifetime would be of great significance (Sun et al., 2016). There are two kinds of effective methods to improve the foam stability: surfactants combination and foam stabilizers. The combination of two surfactants with different charges (e.g., cationic-anionic, nonionic-anionic and nonionic-amphiprotic) may produce the synergistic effect and increase the stability of foam, which is caused by the following changes: i) the reduction of CMC and the surface tension is believed to improve the arrangement of the adsorbed layers; ii) the creation of the viscoelastic monolayer is expected to increase the stability of liquid films (Sun et al., 2016; C. Wang et al., 2016a). The addition of stabilizers to the surfactant foam is deemed to be more efficient. For example, the water-soluble polymers can be used to increase the bulk viscosity and thus decreasing the drainage process; Nano materials (e.g., silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, and cellulose) can be applied to reduce the liquid drainage and coarsening by forming the aggregate structure inside the liquid films or creating the adsorbing position at the surface (Kumar and Mandal, 2017; Wei et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016). Therefore, the role of surfactants combination or foam stabilizers reveals that the stability of foam may be improved either by increasing the effective adsorption at the surface, by creating the viscoelastic monolayer along the films, or by forming the specific structure in the liquid films. In the porous media, foam can be generated in-situ via several mechanisms (i.e., snap-off, lamella division, leave-behind and pinch-off) (Zeng et al., 2016a,b). The presence of foam is known to help mitigate the poor sweep efficiency associated with gas injection (i.e., gas mobility controlling), and thereby increasing the enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Reducing the gas mobility is mainly depended on both the foam generation and the foam destruction. Besides the three decaying processes mentioned above, a critical bound value of the capillary pressure exists in porous medium must be coped with (i.e., the limited capillary pressure, P c * ), below which the liquid films of foam can be survived in a specific thickness, and is potential for controlling mobility (Farajzadeh et al., 2012). Note that the limited capillary pressure is closely related to the saturation of liquid phase (i.e., the foam quality) and the medium permeability (Farajzadeh et al., 2012, 2015). According to relations of the gas/water capillary pressure, a water saturation (S w * ) is observed to be corresponded to P c * , at or below which foam become coarse abruptly due to the insufficient liquid recruited for stabilizing lamellae (Khatib et al., 1988). The mobility controlling of foam suffers from an increasing impairment with decreasing the permeability, although the presence of a high value of P c * (Farajzadeh et al., 2015). However, for a given permeability of porous-media, a stronger foam can be created at a specific foam quality (Wei et al., 2018a). If adopting the foam flooding in a low-permeable reservoir, the addition of stabilizers with high bulk viscosity or incompressibility may be not recommended due to the unfavorable injectivity (Wei et al., 2018b). The low molecular alcohol (i.e., isoamyl alcohol) can be employed as a foam booster by improving the Marangoni effect at the surfaces (Pugh, 1996). In this study, aiming at alkyl glycosides (APG) we investigated the adsorption and viscoelastic behaviors at the surface in the presence of isoamyl alcohol as well as their foam performance, and then explored the stabilization of isoamyl alcohol to APG foam. Effect of crude oil on foam stability was also studied. Afterwards, we performed core flooding experiments to study the foam strength under the low permeability in terms of the foam quality. Finally, we employ the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to quantitatively investigate the oil displacement by foam flooding in the tight formation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alkyl glycosides (APG0814, Sugar group is 1.2–1.8, the average alkyl chain is 10.9) is obtained from Kelong Industry (Chengdu, China), and isoamyl alcohol is supplied by Kelong Industry (Chengdu, China). The brine used, as showed in Table 1 , is served as the formation water in all experiments. The crude oil (the acid number is 0.07–0.08 mgKOH/g, and the density is 0.935 g/cm3 and viscosity is 5.89 mPa s at 90 °C) used in the study is taken from a production well in the Xinjiang Oilfield, China. The low-permeability sand core, which is compose of 85–90% quartz sand and 15–10% ethoxyline resin, is obtained from the Northeast Petroleum University (Daqing, China) and its distribution of pore-throat size is showed in Fig. 1 . The gas (nitrogen with a purity of 99.9%) is obtained from Xinju Industry (Chengdu, China)."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Surface tension and viscoelasticity measurement The spinning drop video tensiometer (SVT20, Dataphysics Ltd., Germany) was employed to measure the surface tension and surface dilatation module under high temperature (90 °C). The spinning speed was fixed at 6000 RPM. Surface tension of each solution was measured more than three times as function of time and the averaged value was recorded. Surface dilatation module was measured under the frequency of 0.02 s−1 and amplitude is 500 RPM. 2.2.2 Bulk foam measurement One the foam was generated by using Waring blender (7012S, Waring Ltd., America) (blending at the speed of 6000 rpm for 1 min), the variations of foam volume and liquid drainage were recoded as function of time. To ensure the accuracy, the experiments were repeated more than three times. The temperature was fixed at 90 °C. Based on the foam rupture (bubble coarsening and coalescence) and the liquid drainage in bulk foam measurements, we introduce two indexes: foam composite index (FCI) and drainage composite index (DCI). As shown in Fig. 2 , the shaded area (S” and S’) can be applied to calculate the foam comprehensive index (Fig. 2(a)) and drainage composite index (Fig. 2(b)), which are described as eq (1) and eq (2). (1) FCI = ∫ 0 T "" 1 / 2 V f d t ≈ 0.75 V f × T "" 1 / 2 (2) DCI = ∫ 0 T 1 / 2 ' V s d t ≈ 0.5 V s × T 1 / 2 ' Where V f and V s are the maximum foaming volume and the maximum volume of liquid drainage, and T″ 1/2 and T′ 1/2 is the half-life time of bulk foam and liquid drainage, respectively. 2.2.3 Core flooding experiment To perform the foam flooding under high-pressure and high-temperature (90 °C, 100 bar), we employed the physical modeling device (Chengdu Core Technology Co. Ltd., China) and its schematic was exhibited in Fig. 3 . The experimental procedure: firstly, the solution of foaming agent was injected to saturate the core and cope with absorption loss due to the rock, and the system pressure achieved the back-pressure; then, 0.5 PV foam was injected at the velocity of 0.4 ml/min (it is proved to be effectivity in the sand core of our previous studies) (Wei et al., 2018a, 2018b), and the massflow meter (F-112AI, Bronkhorst Ltd., Netherlands) was used to controlled the velocity of gas. The foam morphology under the high-pressure could be detected from the visual cell. To eliminate the difference of geo-structure, the same core was used. To remove the gas trapped in core after each experiment, core was taken out of the core-holder and saturated with water via vacuum extrusion. In this study, the nuclear magnetic resonance (MesoMR23-060H-I, NIUMAG, China) was employed to investigate the residual oil in the porous media (the hydrogen atoms of crude oil could be detected). To eliminate the hydrogen atoms in the other fluids, deuteroxide was used to prepare the brine and foaming agents. The following steps of the core flooding experiments in the NMR (the core was scanned after each stage): (1) Crude oil was injected at a low velocity (0.1 ml/min) until no water was produced. (2) Water flooding was conducted as: water was injected at 0.2 ml/min until the water cut increased up to 98%. (3) Foam flooding was conducted as: 0.5 PV foam was injected at 0.4 ml/min and then water was injected at 0.2 ml/min until no oil was produced."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Adsorption behavior,"3.1 Adsorption behavior The effect of isoamyl alcohol on the surface tension isotherms in APG solution was studied by employing different contents of isoamyl alcohol, and the linear fitting was applied to confirm the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the equilibrium value of surface tension. From Fig. 4 , with increasing the contents of isoamyl alcohol, the surface tension isotherms are observed to move downward, indicating that isoamyl alcohol does make a difference to the adsorption behaviors of APG solution. As presented in Table 2 , the addition of isoamyl alcohol brings about a small increase in CMC and a decrease in the equilibrium value of surface tension (the reduce range is about 3.0 mN/m). As reported by Zana (1995), unlike the long-chain alcohols, isoamyl alcohol may impair the micellization process. In other words, the presence of isoamyl alcohol is better solvent for surfactant in solution than the pure water, which leads to a higher surfactant concentration in the micelle formation (Siddiqui et al., 2006). Therefore, the behavior above simply suggests that the increase of CMC in APG mainly results from the hindrance of alcohol in the micellization process. Meanwhile, the decrease in the surface tension of APG solution, especially at higher alcohol concentration, can predominantly reflect the fact from two aspects: First, APG molecules are expected to be more active at the surface (e.g., improving molecular arrangement or decreasing molecular entanglement) in the presence of alcohol (Rao and Ruckenstein, 1986); Second, the excess alcohol causes the interfacial activity (as presented in Table 2, the surface tension can be reduced from 62 mN/m to about 52 mN/m when 0.1 wt% isoamyl alcohol is added) and may modify the adsorption process in APG solution. To quantify the surfactant adsorption, we introduce the surface area per surfactant (A) according to the Gibbs equation, which can be formulated as follow (Eastoe and Dalton, 2000): (3) A = 1 Γ N A = − n R T / N A d γ d ( l n c ) where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, N A is the Avogadro number, γ and c is the surface tension and the surfactant concentration, respectively, and n = 1 in terms of the nonionic surfactant. The linear falling curves of Fig. 4 are applied to calculate the value of A, which is shown in Fig. 5 . From the results, the surface area occupied by a APG molecule is 72 Å, and it increases to around 77 Å when the isoamyl alcohol is added, indicating that the alcohol molecules may partly penetrate into the molecular layer at the surface and thus increase the intermolecular distance of APG (as presented in Fig. 8). However, the increased surface area resulting from the alcohol addition is very small (+5 Å), showing that the contribution of isoamyl alcohol to the packing density is not significant in the already stable adsorption layer."
6,Viscoelastic behavior,"3.2 Viscoelastic behavior Depending on the thermodynamic/kinetic characteristics of the adsorption layer, the dilational modulus (E * ) can be expressed as follow (Bochner de Araujo et al., 2017): E ∗ = δ γ / δ l n S = E ' + i ω E "" . Where E′ and E″ represent dilational elastic modulus and dilational viscous modulus, respectively. The dilational rheological properties at the surface are determined by measuring a change in surface tension caused by altering the oscillating amplitude. In this section, the viscoelastic properties (E’ and E”) of the water-gas interface were investigated in APG solutions with increasing isoamyl alcohol. Fig. 6 exhibits the variations of the elastic and viscous modulus as function of the concentration of isoamyl alcohol, and three concentration ranges can be can be observed: first, for the low concentration (≤0.01 wt%), elastic modulus is higher than viscous modulus, indicating a solid-like layer (Bochner de Araujo et al., 2017); second, for the middle concentration (0.02–0.04 wt%), the value of viscous modulus are much higher than that of elastic modulus, which means that the interfacial layer is more liquid-like instead of solid-like (Tong et al., 2014); finally, for the high concentration (≥0.06 wt%), elastic modulus is superior to viscous modulus, and both of them start to level off. It indicates that the transition of the adsorption layers of APG from solid-like to liquid-like state is closely related to the concertation of isoamyl alcohol. Firstly, with increasing the isoamyl alcohol (≤0.04 wt%), the alcohol molecules may penetrate into the monolayer, where the viscoelastic behaviors can be promoted due to the presence of short-chain molecules, especially the viscosity. Secondly, when the isoamyl alcohol exceeds to 0.04 wt%, the molecular orientation or molecular rearrangement may be improved due to the interactions between APG and alcohol, which is in favor to the create the elastic layer. As for a higher elastic layer, it is capable of creating the rigid interfacial coverage that resist the expansion/compression deformation (Tong et al., 2014). Owing to the fact that the viscous behavior tends to block the molecules diffusion from surface to bulk, the unidirectional diffusion from bulk to surface may be increasingly created in a higher viscous layer as the expansion appeared (Liggieri and Miller, 2010). Therefore, as presented in Fig. 6, the addition of alcohol makes both elastic modulus and viscous modulus increase in varying degrees, which suggests an elevating surface resistance against the deformation in bubble (Rojas et al., 2005)."
7,Foam stability,"3.3 Foam stability The values of FCI and DCI for each APG foam (0.2 wt% APG) were studied as a function of the concentration of isoamyl alcohol and the results were shown in Fig. 7 . It can be found that both FCI and DCI increase linearly with increasing concentration of isoamyl alcohol, and their maximums are observed mainly at 0.06 wt%, where DCI has increased by 50 vol% and FCI is near doubled in comparison to the case without alcohol. It indicates that the addition of isoamyl alcohol can hinder the liquid drainage from the film membranes, retard the coarsening between bubbles and reduce the thin films from rupture at the same time, which indeed promote the foam performance. Combined with the results of previous sections, we can expound the views to the stabilization of isoamyl alcohol to APG foam from four aspects as follow. ⅰ) Role of surface tension. For a given surfactant (APG), when it is applied to generate the foam, the total surface area is sharply increased. According to the Gibbs function, the external energy of foam system tends to become smaller. Therefore, the addition of isoamyl alcohol (as presented in Table 2, a lower surface tension is developed in APG solution) will increase the stability of APG foam from perspective of the surface energy. In addition, the pressure difference between gas bubbles (as presented by Laplace's equation) is proportional to the surface tension, and thus a lower surface tension can decrease the driving force for coarsening between bubbles. However, the decrease of surface tension of APG solution due to the alcohol addition is relatively small (Δγ < 3 mN/m), indicating that the contribution of surface tension reduction to the foam stability may be not significant as supposed. ⅱ) Role of surface viscoelasticity. Unlike the surface tension of adsorption layer, the viscoelasticity of surface is obtained from a non-equilibrium state via oscillating a gas bubble or a liquid drop (Dukhin et al., 1995). Once foam is created, the phenomena (e.g., drainage, coalescence and coarsening) contribute to the destabilization are emerged as a mean of reducing free energy, and the interface of liquid films cannot reach the equilibrium during this process. In this case, alcohol molecules may penetrate into APG molecular layers (see Fig. 5, a larger molecular surface area) and make them more viscoelastic. Since the surfactant monolayers endowed with high viscoelasticity, they can provide a temporary restoring force (e.g., Marangoni effect and unidirectional diffusion) to resist the stretching/compression of the liquid films caused by external disturbances (as shown in Fig. 8) (Pugh, 1996). Therefore, the presence of isoamyl alcohol gives APG foam a larger viscoelasticity to deal with the dynamic change of the liquid films and also stabilize them. ⅲ) Role of H-bond. As a kind of sugar-based surfactants, APG has four OH− groups in its head group and thus indicates a great potential to create the intersurfactant H-bonds. Meanwhile, the H-bond is 40 times stronger than the van der Waals force (related to the disjoining pressure) (Israelachvili, 2011), which plays an important role in influencing foam stability (Farajzadeh et al., 2011). It is hypothesized that APG and isoamyl alcohol are capable of forming intermolecular H-bonds via OH− groups (as presented in Fig. 9 ). The strong H-bonds is expected to increase the attraction between molecules and maintain the tight packed coverage, and hence rigidify the liquid films (Stubenrauch et al., 2017; Raykundaliya et al., 2015). In this scenario, the modified adsorption monolayers can hinder the liquid drainage and foam rupture, thus, foam stability can be greatly enhanced. ⅳ) Role of disjoining pressure. When the liquid films are drained to nanoscale, the surface interaction (the disjoining pressure (Π)) is increasingly prominent. For the nonionic surfactants (APG), the disjoining pressure is determined as the sum of the repulsive electrostatic force, the van der Waals force and the hydrophobic force on account of the classical DLVO theory (Farajzadeh et al., 2012). Act as a special force to balance the capillary pressure, the positive disjoining pressure can create a strong repulsive force between the two surfaces of liquid film and make it more stable (Buchavzov and Stubenrauch, 2007). In that regime, the presence of alcohol can provide an extra disjoining pressure on APG foam within a certain range of film thickness (as presented in Fig. 10 ), which may extend the lifetime of liquid films and stabilize foam."
8,Foam stability in the presence of crude oil,"3.4 Foam stability in the presence of crude oil In this section, FCI and DCI of APG foam (0.2 wt% APG) and APG-alcohol foam (0.2 wt% APG + 0.06 wt% isoamyl alcohol) were measured as a function of crude oil content, and the results were exhibited in Fig. 11 . It can be seen from the curves that, with increasing the oil content, both FCI and DCI decrease gradually in the APG foam, which indicates that the presence of crude oil accelerates the rate of draining and coarsening process and thus creates a significant damage on foam stability. In contrast to that, when alcohol is employed, each of the foam indexes reveals a variation tendency of increasing firstly and then decreasing and the optimal value is reached at the oil content of 5.0 vol%, suggesting that the addition of isoamyl alcohol can efficiently diminish the defoaming effect of crude oil. Meanwhile, values of FCI and DCI in APG-alcohol foam are much higher than that in APG foam, which indicates that the APG-alcohol foam outperforms the APG foam retarding the bubble destruction and liquid drainage. These changes are mainly attributed to the densely adsorbed coverage at the surface as well as the high surface viscoelasticity (as studied in the previous section), which may prevent the oil droplets from moving to the gas-water interface or creating unstable bridges across the liquid films. There are also H-bond interactions and disjoining pressure regime offer in some synergistic effects, and they are tightly improving the foam stability. To explore the interaction between foams and crude oil, four mechanisms responsible for the stability of oil-laden foams were introduced: entering coefficient (E), spreading coefficient (S), bridging coefficient (B), and lamella number (L) (Almajid and Kovscek, 2016; Wang et al., 2016a,b; Mensire and Lorenceau, 2017). (4) E = γ g w + γ o w − γ g o (5) S = γ g w − γ o w − γ g o (6) B = γ g w 2 + γ o w 2 − γ g o 2 (7) L = 0.15 γ g w / γ o w where γ gw is the surface tension at the gas-water interface, γ ow is the interfacial tension at the oil-water interface, and γ ow is the surface tension at the gas-oil interface. As exhibited in Table 3 , two foam systems present the positive values of E, S and B, suggesting that the oil droplets could enter and spread on the interfaces of gas-water and bridge across the liquid films, which may induce the rupture of foam. The lamella number is observed to be larger than one, indicating that the oil droplets may be trapped in the Plateau borders by capillary force (Almajid and Kovscek, 2016). These parameters imply two foams should be unstable when contacting with crude oil, which is generally in disagreement with the above assessments. Meanwhile, the role of alcohol in the oil-laden foam has not been demarcated. To more clearly investigate the improvement of isoamyl alcohol on the stability of oiliness foam, the foam morphology was studied by a Leica optical microscope to confirm that the difference between APG foam and APG-alcohol foam in the presence of crude oil. As shown in Fig. 12 , the involvement of isoamyl alcohol makes the gas bubbles more well-proportioned in contrast to the APG foam (Fig. 12(a)). With this configuration, a sluggish coarsening can be realized due to the smaller pressure difference between gas bubbles according to the Laplace's equation. From the right side of Fig. 12 (with a larger magnification), morphology and distribution behavior of oil emulsions are clearly observed in the liquid films: emulsions are inclined to gather into the plateau borders associated with the liquid draining, and the size of oil droplets is smaller in the APG-alcohol foam. Since the smaller size of droplets usually determines the more stable emulsions (Politova et al., 2017), the addition of isoamyl alcohol may impose a higher stability of the pseudoemulsion films in foam system (Lobo and Wasan, 1993), and therefore promoting the foam stability in the presence of oil."
9,Foam strength under low permeability,"3.5 Foam strength under low permeability In this section, the foam strength in the porous media can be quantified by the apparent viscosity (μ f ), as presented in eq (8) (Zeng et al., 2016a,b): (8) μ f = − k u f ∇ p = k A u f Δ P L Where k is the core permeability, ∇p is the pressure gradient along the core, and u f is the superficial velocity of foam. For a specific core, the apparent viscosity of foam is closely related to the pressure drop in porous media. The foam behavior in low-permeable formation was investigated by co-injecting gas and surfactant solution (0.2 wt% APG + 0.06 wt% isoamyl alcohol). As shown in Fig. 13 , when the foam quality increases from 0.14 to 0.67, the apparent viscosity increases gradually and ultimately reaches its maximum level at the foam quality of 0.67, which is specified as the low-quality regime in this process. As the foam quality continues to increase, a considerable decline in the apparent viscosity is witnessed, and the high-quality regime is therefore created. Between two regimes, the transition foam quality is observed at the maximum apparent viscosity (Wei et al., 2018a). Meanwhile, the pressure drop is shown as a function of foam quality, which indicates that foam possess a relatively good injectivity in its high foam quality under low permeability compared with the low foam quality. The foam micrographs in the high-pressure micro-visual cell were also studied and presented in Fig. 14 . For a low foam quality (0.67), the gas bubbles are highly dispersed in liquid phase and their sizes are very small (approximately around 20 μm, measured by Coreldraw). However, at the foam quality of 0.8, the bubbles are observed to be spherical and large (mainly centralized to 500 μm). As presented in Fig. 14 (a, b), foam texture of the low foam quality appears to be finer than that of high foam quality after 12 h, which implies the rupture of foam is relatively small at a lower foam quality. It can be evidenced from the results, in the low-quality regime, the bubble size may match the pore size of core (as shown in Fig. 1, the radius of pore-throat is 0.1–20 μm) and presents a fine texture in the tight formation, which indicates that the resistance of foam flow can be highly improved due to the bubble trapping and transportation (e.g., Jamin effect) (Lv et al., 2015). Therefore, the higher gas volume (not beyond the transition foam quality) may lead to a more effective way in mobility reducing. As for the high-quality regime, the bubble size is much larger than the pore-throat size and the foam bubbles appear to be a series of “gas slug” in the porous media, and foam strength is heavily determined by the lamellae. However, as the lamellae thin to the limited capillary pressure (P c * ), foam become unstable (Farajzadeh et al., 2015). In this scenario, foam lamellae would rapidly coalesce if the gas phase further increases, which is mainly because of the thinning in liquid films and the increase in capillary suction (Farajzadeh et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2016a,b)."
10,Oil displacement under low permeability,"3.6 Oil displacement under low permeability Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is recognized an effective way to investigate the fluid transportation in the porous media (Watson and Chang, 1997), and Mitchell et al. demonstrated that the signal amplitude obtained from NMR is positively depended on the liquid volume in porous media (Mitchell et al., 2012). In this study, we employ the NMR to quantitatively observe the oil displacement by foam flooding in the tight formation. As shown in Fig. 15 , there are two peaks in the curves, and the value of peaks decreases when water flooding was conducted. However, parts of signal amplitude increase rather than reduces (as indicated by arrows in Fig. 15). It suggests that the water flooding can displace the oil and, at the same time, change its flow direction to the other pore-throat. Afterwards, when the foam flooding is conducted, the decrease of signal amplitude is much higher than that after water flooding, and indicating that foam has higher ability in the displacing of the residual oil. In the slow diffusion regime of NMR, the relaxation time of hydrogen atoms is expected to be linearly correlated to the pore-throat size (V/S) (Mitchell et al., 2012), and the relationship can be described by (Yao and Liu, 2012): (9) 1 T 2 = ρ 2 S V Where T 2 is the relaxation time, ρ 2 is the transverse surface relaxivity, and S/V is the surface-to-volume ratio. Meanwhile, in consideration of the linear relationship between signal amplitude and oil volume (Mitchell et al., 2012), the oil saturation distributions as function of pore-throat radius can be studied. We select four types of pore-throat radius in terms of size, i.e., micropores (<0.01 μm), mesopores (0.01–0.1 μm), macropores (0.1–1.0 μm) and superpores (>1.0 μm), and the oil saturation distributions at different stages (in turn: the initial state, after water flooding and after foam flooding) are presented in Fig. 16 . From Fig. 16, after water flooding, the variations of oil saturation for four pore-throat are as follows: micropores (−13.14%), mesopores (−12.24%), macropores (+10.11%) and superpores (−6.90%). It suggests that, in addition to the driving out of pores, the oil may be jammed into the macropores via water flooding. As the foam flooding is conducted, the remarkable declines of residual oil saturation are observed in the following order: 8.96% in micropores, 5.28% in mesopores, 25.58% in macropores and 28.28% in superpores. It indicates that foam is to be able to efficiently displace the oil of whole pores and its displacement efficiency is more effective in the larger pores. This is mainly due to the fact that: First, the pore-sized gas bubbles (as illuminated in previous section) are likely to deform and create the microforce on the oil around the pore channels, especially in the presence of the high viscoelasticity of the liquid films (Sun et al., 2014); Second, foam is expected to create a bigger mobility reduction in the larger pores and diverted the foam flow into the smaller ones, which can generate a superior sweep efficiency (Pu et al., 2017); Final, the undersized pores (e.g., micropores and mesopores in this study) have a negative impact on foam performance, where, however, the combination flooding (gas and surfactant) may be created by the diverted fluids from the larger pores, and thus leading to a degree of oil displacement (Wei et al., 2018b). In these efforts, the EOR of foam flooding is 30.35% in the low-permeable core which is much bigger than that of water flooding (see Table 4 )."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, the addition of isoamyl alcohol to the APG solution causes a lower surface tension and a larger surface area per surfactant (A), and promotes the creation of CMC in a lower concentration. Meanwhile, both elastic modulus and viscous modulus of the APG solution present an increasing variation in the presence of isoamyl alcohol, which suggests an elevating surface resistance against the deformation in bubble. Bulk foam experiments indicate that isoamyl alcohol (0.06 wt%) has the advantageous effect on the performance of APG foam (DCI has increased by 50 vol% and FCI is near doubled). The role of isoamyl alcohol played in foam stabilization could be summarized as: reducing the surface tension, increasing the surface viscoelasticity, creating the H-bond and providing the disjoining pressure. Meanwhile, the addition of isoamyl alcohol can efficiently diminish the defoaming effect of crude oil and create a smaller emulsion in the liquid films, and thus improving the foam stability in the presence of crude oil. Core flooding experiments show that APG-alcohol foam (0.2 wt% APG + 0.06 wt% isoamyl alcohol) reaches the maximum apparent viscosity at the transition foam quality of 0.67 and exhibits a fine texture in the low-permeable porous media. Based on the NMR method in the low-permeable core, we observed that APG-alcohol foam is to be able to efficiently displace the oil of whole pores and its displacement efficiency is more effective in the larger pores, which ultimately promotes the EOR to 30.35%."
