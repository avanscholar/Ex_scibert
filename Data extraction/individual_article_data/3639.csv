0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an alternative ecologically clean energy carrier. Nowadays many countries invest great funds in the development of hydrogen power engineering based on fuel cells (FC). Overall funding for FC research in the European Union is estimated to be between 50 and 60 million Euros a year [1]. Generally there are five types of FC: alkaline, proton-exchange membrane, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate and solid oxide. The proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have many advantages such as low operating temperature, sustained operation at a high current density, low weight, compactness, the potential for low cost and volume, long stack life, fast start-ups and suitability for discontinuous operation [2]. These factors make PEMFCs potential and most promising candidates for a wide variety of power applications ranging from portable/micropower and transportation to large-scale stationary power systems for buildings and distributed generation. The carbon monoxide content in hydrogen fuel for PEMFCs should not exceed 20ppm [3]. The presence of CO2 has also a negative effect on PEMFC performance because anode catalyst is poisoned as it was ascertained by Janssen [4]. Due to the fact that hydrogen gas is difficult to store and transport it should be produced close to the final consumer. There are several methods of producing hydrogen or hydrogen-rich gas [5–8]. Currently the most common production method of high purity hydrogen is a multi-step process involving steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas to produce synthesis gas (CO+H2), water-gas shift reaction to convert CO into CO2 and CO2 removing. The main disadvantages of this method are CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, processing complexity and expensive process equipment. Direct non-oxidative catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and nanofibrous carbon is alternative one-step process to produce CO x -free hydrogen. NFC is valuable material which can be effectively used both in science and technology [9–12] so this method of hydrogen production could be more profitable than traditional ones. This process is commonly carried out by using Ni-based catalyst and methane (natural gas) as initial hydrocarbon at relatively low temperatures (500–800°C) [13–18]. According to thermodynamics the final products of decomposition of hydrocarbons at 400–800°C are hydrogen, methane and carbon. To produce H2–CH4 mixtures with more than 50vol.% of hydrogen the process of hydrocarbon decomposition should be carried out at the temperatures above 500°C or be accompanied by separation of methane from the reaction products that is quite complicated technical problem. Even though methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon (the main component of natural gas) and has the highest H:C ratio, other hydrocarbons that are produced by other fuel feedstocks (e.g. naphtha) could be considered. Propane can be used as an alternative feedstock for CO x -free hydrogen production (instead of methane or natural gas). Propane is inexpensive and widely available fuel which can be stored and transported easily in liquid state under small pressures. For example, in the European Union as well as in the Russian Federation propane is delivered in cylinders as domestic fuel and for vehicles at gas filling stations. Moreover, hydrogen could be easily separated from propane (much easier than methane) with simple membrane apparatus. These features make propane attractive for production of hydrogen used as fuel in autonomous electric power plants based on FC. Dokupil et al. [19] performed thermodynamic simulations and developed small-scale propane fuel processor integrated with a low temperature PEMFC for an electric power output of 300W. This modular system is composed of steam reformer with catalytic burner, two adiabatic water-gas shift reactors and selective oxidation reactor for CO purification with a lot of internal heat exchangers. Although process efficiency is quite high, there are substantial disadvantages concerning complicated construction and operation. The process of propane decomposition (both catalytic and non-catalytic) for production of hydrogen containing mixtures was investigated elsewhere [3,20–23]. Despite the high level of propane conversion (close to 100%) the authors did not succeed in getting both high integral hydrogen yield per gram of catalyst and high H2:CH4 ratio during a long period at the temperatures below 800°C. Savva et al. [24] reported results concerning the ethylene decomposition reaction over a novel Ni catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. The catalytic system with only 0.5wt.% of Ni loading presented very high hydrogen yield value of 296mol H2/g Ni for the ethylene decomposition reaction at 400°C. However this catalyst maintains stable activity during only 10h. After 14h complete deactivation happens and regeneration of the catalyst should be done. Moreover, despite the high value of hydrogen selectivity [23,24] the mechanisms of hydrogen and methane formation by catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition are still not clear and conditions of increasing the selectivity of hydrogen are not revealed. In patent [25] we reported the possibility of CO x -free hydrogen production with high H2:CH4 ratios by catalytic propane decomposition. The present work is devoted to studies of selective process of catalytic propane decomposition over Ni and Ni–Cu catalysts with different copper loadings at 400–700°C. The possible scheme of the reaction included intermediate steps of formation of active surface species is suggested for explanation the catalytic propane decomposition mechanism. The optimal technological parameters (temperature and catalyst chemical composition) for producing CO x -free mixture of hydrogen and propane with very small amount of methane over a long period of time are discussed. The schematic diagram of propane decomposition system for the production of highly concentrated hydrogen and NFC as valuable by-product is proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation It is ascertained that for decomposition of hydrocarbons the stable reaction can be provided by particles that are neither too fine nor too coarse [14,15,24]. Ermakova et al. [26] have studied thoroughly the influence of the size of active particles on the carbon as well as hydrogen yields. The maximal carbon and hydrogen yields were shown to be attained with the catalysts comprising a textural promoter in the amount of 10% and active particles of 10–40nm average diameter. Therefore, in this work methods which allow preparing catalysts with average diameters of particles in the mentioned range were used. Five samples of high-loaded Ni-containing catalysts were used for the process of propane decomposition into hydrogen and carbon. High dispersity and stability of active metal phase in these catalysts were achieved by using hard-to-reduce oxides such as alumina or silica as textural promoters. Supported catalysts with active particles of the required size were prepared by three different methods (Table 1 ). All methods have their advantages and disadvantages discussed below. The 90Ni catalyst was prepared by coprecipitation using aqueous solutions of salts Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NaOH as precipitate. The samples were carefully washed with distilled water until NO3 ions were no longer detected in the remaining solution and calcined in a continuous flow of nitrogen for 3h at 350°C. The disadvantage of this method is necessity of distilled water in large amounts for washing and removal of alkali metals. The 70Ni–20Cu catalyst was prepared using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Al(OH)3 as precursor of textural catalyst promoter. The reactants were mixed to the state of homogeneous paste and calcined by stepped heating from 150 to 750°C. Concentrated solution of ammonia was used as precipitant. This method seems to be very laborious. The 63Ni–23Cu, 50Ni–40Cu and 40Ni–50Cu catalysts were prepared by the heterophase sol–gel method. To prepare catalysts the precursor of the active component (NiO) was impregnated with the solution of the precursor of silica as textural promoter taken in the calculated amount. An alcohol solution of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was used as a supplier of silica. The impregnated precursors were dried at room temperature. This method for catalyst preparation seems to be the most simple and the least laborious. Therefore it was chosen as the most appropriate one to prepare the latter three catalysts. All the catalyst samples before the reaction studies were reduced in hydrogen at 550°C for 3h. After that samples were passivated in ethanol and dried in argon flow at room temperature in order to prevent pyrophoric phenomena. This procedure did not influence the properties of the catalysts."
3,Propane decomposition,2.2 Propane decomposition The propane decomposition experiments were performed in a flow quartz reactor 60cm3 in volume with a vibro-fluidized catalyst bed under atmospheric pressure. Undiluted propane flow of 100Lh−1 per gram of catalyst was maintained by Mass-Flow controller. The catalyst weight in all the experiments was 0.01g. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in the Fig. 1 . Hydrogen and argon were used for catalyst reduction and purging of the reactor respectively. Gases were fed the reactor from gas cylinders through pressure reducers and two-way valves. The reactor with catalyst bed was placed in electric heater and heated up to the reaction temperature. During the reaction a part of the gaseous products was taken by sampling valve and analyzed by GC using TCD and two chromatographic columns: “Porapak QS” for hydrogen and methane detection and “Carbo Erba” (zeolite) for propane and other hydrocarbons.
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalyst samples after propane decomposition were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images were obtained with a JEM-100CX microscope (accelerating voltage 100kV, coefficient of spherical aberration of the objective lens 2.8mm) at room temperature."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Non-catalytic thermal propane decomposition,"3.1 Non-catalytic thermal propane decomposition During catalytic decomposition the process of non-catalytic thermal propane decomposition which proceeds simultaneously can significantly affect the composition of reaction products. Therefore, the peculiarities of thermal propane decomposition in the same reactor but without a catalyst were considered. Fig. 2 shows the influence of temperature on the product distribution for non-catalytic thermal propane decomposition. Dotted lines represent thermodynamically equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen and methane under the same conditions. As it can be seen from the diagram the process of thermal propane decomposition is non-equilibrium and begins when the temperature is about 525°C. According to Fig. 2 the main reaction products are hydrogen, methane, ethane and ethylene. Concentrations of these products increase greatly above 600°C. Very small amounts of propylene were observed at the temperatures above 625°C. In spite of high value of propane conversion (almost 90%) at 700°C the hydrogen concentration does not exceed 11vol.%. It is considered that the homogeneous decomposition of hydrocarbon is the dominant route of chain initiation reaction in the gas phase because the bond energy of C–C is lower than that of C–H [29]. The following simplified free radical reaction mechanisms can be used to explain the data shown in Fig. 2. At first due to breaking of C–C bond in propane molecule initial free radicals (methyl and ethyl) are formed: (1) С 3 Н 8 → CН 3 + С 2 H 5 Then highly active methyl and ethyl radicals react with initial propane molecules and attach hydrogen atoms to form methane or ethylene and propyl: (2) CH 3 + C 3 H 8 → CH 4 + C 3 H 7 (3) C 2 H 5 + C 3 H 8 → C 2 H 6 + C 3 H 7 Propyl can either undergo β-scission of C–H bonds producing propylene and active hydrogen atom or decompose into ethylene and methyl radical: (4) C 3 H 7 → C 3 H 6 + H (5) C 3 H 7 → C 2 H 4 + CH 3 Active hydrogen atom attaches one more hydrogen atom from initial propane or reacts with another active hydrogen atom and converts into hydrogen molecule: (6) H + C 3 H 8 → H 2 + C 3 H 7 (7) H + H → H 2 The process of methane formation occurs simultaneously to the process of hydrogen formation and consists of the reactions (2) and (8): (8) CH 3 + H → CH 4 Thus, non-catalytic thermal decomposition of propane under certain conditions results in formation of gaseous mixture containing hydrogen, methane, ethylene and small amounts of ethane and propylene in reactions (1)–(8). It is supposed that methane concentration is higher than hydrogen concentration because breaking of C–C bonds dominates with producing highly active methyl radicals converted into methane (reactions (1), (2) and (8)). It should be noted that thermal propane decomposition under certain conditions could affect distinctly the catalytic decomposition only at temperatures above 600°C."
7,Propane decomposition on Ni catalyst,"3.2 Propane decomposition on Ni catalyst The product distribution of propane decomposition over 90Ni catalyst as a function of time on stream at 400–550°C is shown in Fig. 3 . It should be noted that hydrogen, methane and unreacted propane and no ethane and ethylene were observed under such conditions. Though the lifetime of 90Ni catalyst is more than 20h at 400°C (Fig. 4 ) hydrogen concentration is only 12vol.% at an early period of reaction and then it smoothly decreases to 7vol.% as the catalyst activity decreases. Overall, an increasing selectivity of hydrogen is observed with time on stream. At an early period of reaction methane concentration is almost two times more (22vol.%) than hydrogen concentration and by the end it decreases to 1.5vol.%. At the same time hydrogen concentration is 10–11vol.%. So, the H2:CH4 ratio changes from approx. 0.5 to 5, i.e. the selectivity of hydrogen increases 10 times over. An increase in the reaction temperature results in the increase of propane conversion and the selectivity of hydrogen. The H2:CH4 ratio at 500°C is about 17 by 6h time on stream. The maximum hydrogen concentration achieves 38vol.% at 550°C, but the rate of catalyst deactivation increases and catalyst is almost deactivated after 4h."
8,Possible reaction scheme,"3.3 Possible reaction scheme The heterogeneous decomposition of propane over 90Ni catalyst is not a simple process. It is considered that hydrogen formation is connected with simultaneous carbon deposition on catalyst particles by decomposition of hydrocarbons [30–36]. According to a generally accepted mechanism of carbon nanofibers formation [32,35,36] it includes an activation of the molecules on the Ni (100) and/or Ni (110) facets and formation of surface carbon, followed by carbon diffusion across the nickel particles and deposition of the carbon on the Ni (111) planes. The catalyst deactivation is usually accounted for by encapsulation of the metal particle into carbon when the rate of formation of carbon atoms on Ni surface becomes faster than the rate of their diffusion toward the deposition sites [37]. Otsuka et al. [38] suppose that hydrocarbon decomposes into carbon and hydrogen first, then the carbon is hydrogenated to methane. The supposition that hydrocarbon decomposition at relatively low temperatures can happen by C–C bonds breaking with the formation of CH x surface species on Ni particles surface is reported in [39–41]. These works demonstrate that the following dehydrogenation of CH x surface species can result in the formation of carbon and hydrogen. Based on experimental data obtained (Fig. 3) and analysis of the literature we suppose that decomposition of propane over Ni-based catalyst at relatively low temperatures (400–700°C) occurs on active centers of two types (S1 and S2). This process is accompanied by chemisorption with the formation of strongly-held species. Depending on the strength of C–S (carbon–center) bonds in chemisorbed species (S–CH x ) either the progressive loss of H atoms with the formation of carbon on the Ni particles surface or bonding of H atoms from gaseous phase with the formation of methane could happen. This assumption can be illustrated by the following reaction scheme including reactions (9)–(15). The first and the easiest reaction step is breaking C–C bonds in propane molecules with the participation of active centers S (S1 or S2). As a result, surface species S–CH3 and S–C2H5 are formed and the latter could decompose into S–CH3 and S–CH2: (9) C 3 H 8 + 2 S → S CH 3 + S C 2 H 5 (10) S C 2 H 5 + S → S CH 3 + S CH 2 In the case of S1 centers S–C bonds are stronger. Therefore, the following reactions lead to the formation of active H atoms and carbon depositions on catalyst: (11) S 1 CH 3 → S 1 CH 2 + H (12) S 1 CH 2 → S 1 CH + H (13) S 1 CH → S 1 C + H Hydrogen is formed by reactions (6) and (7) as in case of homogeneous pyrolysis. Methane is formed by bonding of H atom to the methyl surface species with the participation of active centers S2 with weaker C–S bond: (14) S 2 CH 3 + H → S 2 + CH 4 (15) S 2 CH 3 + C 3 H 8 → S 2 + CH 4 + C 3 H 7 Thus, the summary reaction of propane decomposition on Ni-based catalyst is: (16) C 3 H 8 → 2 C + CH 4 + 2 H 2 The suggested reaction mechanism is proved by the fact that Ni-based catalysts are the most active ones in the methanation reaction. We believe that the rapid deactivation of active centers S2 by deposited carbons results in decreasing the rate of methane formation and increasing the selectivity of hydrogen. Therefore, the strong dependence of selectivity of hydrogen on catalyst activity is observed. Temperature rise accelerates the reactions (9)–(15) both on S1 and S2 active centers. Therefore, the increases of hydrogen and methane concentrations at an early reaction period are observed (Fig. 3). The rate of carbon deposition on catalyst particles surface also increases and deactivation of active centers S2 happens faster. This could be explained by the supposition that the weak C–S bonds of these centers cause the low rate of carbon atoms migration through the bulk of Ni particles and their accumulation on the catalyst surface which leads to the deactivation of these centers. Thus, the data obtained show that monometallic 90Ni catalyst is not acceptable for hydrogen production by decomposition of propane. In order to increase the selectivity of hydrogen it is necessary to modify the Ni-based catalyst to reduce the amount of catalytic active centers S2. According to the literature [42,43] and following investigations it could be achieved by the introduction of copper to Ni-based catalyst."
9,Effect of Cu loading in catalyst,"3.4 Effect of Cu loading in catalyst Fig. 4 shows the product distribution of propane decomposition over 70Ni–20Cu catalyst at 500–700°C. It should be noted that catalyst lifetime considerably increased in comparison with 90Ni catalyst. The hydrogen concentration of 30–32vol.% during first 5h at 500°C is observed. The methane concentration is 2.5 times over than that of hydrogen at the beginning of the reaction, but sharply decreases from 70 to 5vol.% and finally falls almost to zero while the hydrogen concentration is about 10vol.%. Thus, an addition of copper to Ni-based catalyst results in increasing the selectivity of hydrogen and the catalyst lifetime. The hydrogen concentration increases with temperature like in the case of monometallic 90Ni catalyst (Fig. 3). At 550°C the maximum hydrogen concentration is 43vol.% for 70Ni–20Cu catalyst (Fig. 4). The maximum concentration of hydrogen at 600°C is about 65vol.% at an early reaction period and more than 35vol.% after 16.5h of time on stream. The initial methane concentration is about 50vol.% but after 5h it decreases to 10vol.% and remains at this level till the end of the period concerned. The total H2:CH4 at 600°C is 2.7. It should be noted that 70Ni–20Cu catalyst is still active at the end of experiment and hydrogen concentration is supposed to be decreased gradually afterwards for a long period of time. Besides hydrogen and methane very small amounts of ethylene and ethane (no more than 5vol.% total) are observed at 500–600°C. It is believed that ethylene and ethane are formed by non-catalytic thermal propane decomposition parallel to the main catalytic process. The experimental data obtained show that at temperatures above 600°C the hydrogen concentration changes slightly. However, the concentrations of methane and C2 hydrocarbons rise sharply. This suggests that in consequence of a gradual catalyst deactivation the non-catalytic mechanism of propane decomposition begins to dominate with increasing of C2 hydrocarbons concentrations. Total concentrations of hydrogen and methane are the sum of both catalytic and non-catalytic concentrations. Fig. 5 shows data obtained of propane decomposition over 63Ni–23Cu catalyst. It was found that the increase of copper loading in bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst leads to further increase in the selectivity of hydrogen and catalyst lifetime. At 500°C the hydrogen concentration at an early reaction period increases to 35vol.%. At the same time methane concentration decreases to approx. 3vol.%. At 12h time on stream methane concentration falls almost to zero (about 0.5vol.%) but the hydrogen concentration remains on the level of 17–18vol.%. The complete catalyst deactivation is observed at 39h time on stream. At 550°C hydrogen concentration increases to 49vol.%, residual concentration of methane changes slightly and ethylene and ethane are observed in the reaction products but no more than 2vol.% total. The total H2:CH4 ratio is 8.9. The maximum hydrogen concentration (82vol.%) at 700°C almost corresponds to equilibrium (Fig. 2). But the concentration of methane is 10vol.% at an early reaction period and then rises sharply to 26vol.% at 5h and continues increasing. So, the total H2:CH4 ratio is low (only 2.1). The increase of copper loading to 40wt.% in the Ni–Cu catalyst leads to further reduction of catalyst activity in formation of methane and the increase in selectivity of hydrogen. The product distribution of propane decomposition over 50Ni–40Cu catalyst is shown in Fig. 6 . At 500°C the maximum concentrations of hydrogen and methane do not exceed 20vol.% and 0.5vol.% correspondingly (Fig. 6). But hydrogen concentration remains at 10vol.% level, so that the total H2:CH4 ratio is 59.7. It should be noted that it is the highest H2:CH4 ratio obtained in this work. As the temperature raises from 500 to 550°C the hydrogen concentration at an early reaction period increases twice over. According to Fig. 6 the hydrogen concentration at 550°C is more than 20vol.% during 15h of time on stream. Then it gradually decreases but remains higher than 10vol.% during almost 45h with the almost complete absence of methane. The total H2:CH4 ratio is 11.7. There is a sharp increase of hydrogen concentration with temperature increasing to 600°C. The maximum hydrogen concentration (60vol.%) in an early reaction period increases almost 2.5 times over in comparison with 550°C. Then hydrogen concentration gradually decreases and remains no less than 30vol.% at 20h of time on stream. The methane concentration decreases sharply from 24vol.% to approx. 2vol.% at 5h. The total H2:CH4 ratio is 8.4 at 600°C. According to Figs. 4–6 hydrogen production by propane decomposition over all the used Ni–Cu catalysts at the temperatures above 600°C seems to be unsuitable because of the significant increase of C1–C3 hydrocarbons concentrations. The optimal temperature for hydrogen production by propane decomposition over Ni–Cu catalysts is 600°C. The hydrogen concentration in the reactor varies between 25 and 65vol.% during 20h of time on stream and the residual concentration of methane does not exceed 10vol.%. The 50Ni–40Cu catalyst is supposed to be the most appropriate for hydrogen production by propane decomposition at 600°C. The highly concentrated hydrogenous mixture with more than 30vol.% of hydrogen and less than 3vol.% of methane can be obtained. Further increasing copper loading in Ni–Cu catalyst leads to decrease in the selectivity of hydrogen. The product distribution of propane decomposition over 40Ni–50Cu catalyst is shown in Fig. 7 . At optimal temperature of 600°C the hydrogen concentration is 43vol.% at an early period of reaction and 28vol.% at 12h. The methane concentration decreases from 27vol.% to approx. 4vol.% at 5h of time on stream. So, the total H2:CH4 ratio is 4.4. It is lower than that by catalytic propane decomposition over 50Ni–40Cu catalyst at the same temperature. We can conclude that Ni–Cu catalyst with higher copper loading will not result in the increase in the selectivity of hydrogen. Table 2 summarizes data on the propane decomposition at 500–700°C over all the Ni–Cu catalysts used. The formation rates of hydrogen and methane were calculated from their concentrations. By integrating the formation rates against time on stream from the beginning to the end of reaction period the total amounts of hydrogen and methane were evaluated. The total hydrogen yield Y H 2 was defined as the number of moles of hydrogen formed per gram of catalyst (mols H2/g cat) during the whole reaction period t (h). Due to the long lifetime of catalysts used not all the experiments were conducted until their complete deactivation. Therefore in order to compare the data obtained the values of hydrogen yield during 10h of time on stream Y 10 H 2 (mols H2/g cat) were calculated. The average values of hydrogen concentration C H 2 (vol.%) which can be obtained after removal of C2–C3 hydrocarbons from reaction products were evaluated. The total H2:CH4 ratios were also defined for all the experiments and placed in Table 2. As it follows from Table 2 the total hydrogen yield of 60.8mol H2/g cat (corresponding to 35mol H2/g cat during 10h) is obtained by propane decomposition over the most appropriate 50Ni–40Cu catalyst at 600°C. After C2–C3 hydrocarbons removal a CO x -free mixture of hydrogen and methane with average hydrogen concentration of 90vol.% during 24h can be obtained. This hydrogen-rich gas is suitable for using in PEMFC without any additional purification because such a small methane amount (10vol.%) could be considered as inert admixture. Despite the hydrogen yield by catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene) could be higher as it was reported in [24] this process is proposed to be acceptable for large-scale hydrogen production."
10,Transition electron microscopy (TEM) examinations of NFC obtained,"3.5 Transition electron microscopy (TEM) examinations of NFC obtained As it was reported in number of publications [13–18,20,22–25] carbon nanofibers can be grown during catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons. Structure and morphology of carbon nanofibers strongly depend on catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock [30,36]. Fig. 8 shows the TEM images of carbon nanofibers grown by propane decomposition over 90Ni catalyst at 550°C. It can be noted that these carbon nanofibers as well as carbon nanofibers grown by catalytic methane decomposition [18] have stacked-cone (or so-called “herringbone”) structure. But by the propane decomposition the fibers with wider distribution of fiber diameters (from 10 to 100nm) are obtained. It should be noted that some fibers formed from propane on 90Ni (Fig. 8) have a branched form. We suggest that there are two mechanisms of these branched nanofibers formation presented in Fig. 9 . The first mechanism is “splitting” of a large metal particle into two smaller ones on which two fibers are grown. And the second one is “uniting” of two small metal particles in one larger particle to form one carbon fiber. According to Figs. 8 and 9 the mechanism of branched fibers formation by catalytic decomposition of propane should be “uniting” because the graphite cones of the fibers obtained after branching are directed towards the “branching point”. The cause of branched fibers formation could be the relatively high C:H ratio in propane and consequently the high rate of carbon deposition on catalyst particle surface. This leads to gradual increase of concentration of dissolved carbon in catalyst particle. As a result these metal–carbon particles have viscous-flow state due to oversaturation with carbon atoms [35,44]. The probability of “uniting” of two viscous-flow catalytic particles after their collision is higher than that of solid particles. Propane decomposition on Ni–Cu catalysts is accompanied by simultaneous formation of carbon fibers with different structure and morphology (Figs. 10–12 ). Nanofibers with stacked-cone structure as well as nanofibers with platelet structure are observed. In contrast to 70Ni–20Cu catalyst larger fibers (to 500nm in diameter) were obtained by propane decomposition on 63Ni–23Cu and 50Ni–40Cu catalysts at 500–700°C (Figs. 11 and 12). Along with the large fibers there are numerous thin fibers with diameters ranging from 10 to 50nm. It can be concluded that the large particles of Ni–Cu alloy are split to separate small particles which catalyze growth of thin fibers. Moreover, during the reaction the structure of the large metal particles is changed into blocky ones keeping their initial size. Defectiveness of the particles surface leads to delamination of fibers [35]. This promotes the formation of carbon fiber bundles growing from one particle (Figs. 11(a) and 12(a and b)). These fibers could self-organize into ropes with well-ordered structure. The reason for self-assembling fibers ropes formation can be explained in terms of Van der Waals interaction between separated fibers growing from the same catalyst particle [45]. The increase in temperature to 700°C results in formation of thick fibers by propane decomposition (Figs. 10(b) and 11(b)). We suppose that such thick fibers are formed by secondary deposition of pyrocarbon onto fibers grown by catalytic particles as it was reported in [46,47]. The formation of coiled carbon nanofibers as well as carbon nanofiber ropes was observed after propane decomposition over 50Ni–40Cu catalyst at 600°C (Fig. 12b). It should be noted that coiled nanofibers were not grown on other Ni–Cu catalysts with lower copper loading. The formation of coiled nanofibers could be explained due to the difference between carbon deposition rates on different edges of metal particle [48,49]. The investigations of NFC produced by catalytic decomposition of propane will be discussed in more detail in next paper."
11,Process of propane conversion into hydrogen for PEMFC and NFC,"3.6 Process of propane conversion into hydrogen for PEMFC and NFC As it is mentioned above the process of hydrogen and NFC production by catalytic propane decomposition is carried out more effectively using 50Ni–40Cu catalyst at 600°C. The main gaseous products of propane decomposition under these conditions are hydrogen (30–60vol.%), propane (35–60vol.%) and no more than 3vol.% of methane. This process can be used for developing the technology of CO x -free hydrogen production for PEMFC. The process of selective catalytic decomposition of propane can be realized in periodical reactor with vibro-fluidized catalyst bed with NFC producing in granulated form [50]. But it is necessary to separate hydrogen from hydrogen–propane mixture. Hydrogen may be effectively separated by pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) or by permeation through hydrogen-selective (propane-impervious) membrane. PSA systems comprise a number of adsorption columns, solenoid valves and controls. These systems tend to be bulky and add complexity (i.e. number of parts) to the processing plant. Membrane separation systems offer simplicity of operation and separation efficiency. Membranes made of palladium and palladium alloys have extremely high hydrogen selectivity because they operate by catalytic dissociation of hydrogen followed by recombination of dissociated hydrogen atoms into molecular hydrogen. Inorganic membranes for hydrogen separation are less expensive than metal or polymer membranes. Molecular diameter of propane is about 4.4A compared with 3.8A for methane and 2.8A for hydrogen [51]. Therefore, for hydrogen separation from hydrogen–propane mixtures the use of comparatively inexpensive inorganic membranes with pore diameters of 3–4A will suffice. Sklari and Zaspalis [52] used thin (1.2μm) membrane made from aluminophosphate grown on top of substrates prepared from the same material and experimentally investigated the ability of aluminophosphate membranes to separate hydrogen from hydrogen–propane mixtures. Separation experiments gave separation factor 15.5 at 50°C. Bischoff and Judkins [53] propose tubular membrane consisting of a very thin inorganic separative layer applied directly to material support. The separation factor achieves 33 at 200°C. Thus, the system for production of hydrogen and NFC by catalytic decomposition of propane should include the following main components: catalytic reactor and hydrogen separation unit. The schematic diagram of propane decomposition system for the production of highly concentrated hydrogen for PEMFC and NFC is shown in Fig. 13 . Propane is fed from propane tank into the unit containing two catalytic reactors (R1 and R2) operated in turn. The hydrogen–propane mixture with small methane admixture obtained in reactor unit is directed to the hydrogen separation unit. After hydrogen separation propane is returned to the reactor unit. Hydrogen-rich gas with more than 90vol.% of hydrogen is fed in PEMFC. The anode off-gas of PEMFC consisting of small amounts of methane and residual hydrogen is utilized in the gas burner. NFC obtained during reaction remains in the reactor. Each reactor is heated up to 600°C by the gas burner using the mixture of propane or/and off-gas of PEMFC and air. After propane decomposition in reactor R1 propane feed is switched to the reactor R2 with the fresh batch of catalyst and then reactor R2 is heated up to reaction temperature. The flow direction of initial propane is changed by using the two-way valves. While the reactor R2 operates the reactor R1 is cooled and NFC produced is extracted from it into a special container. Then the reactor R1 is loaded with the fresh batch of catalyst and heated up to 600°C. After that the propane feed is switched to the reactor R1 and the cycle repeats. Thus, the use of two reactors allows carrying out the process of hydrogen and NFC production continuously. For providing the high hydrogen concentration in the mixture feeding to PEMFC the reactors should be switched before catalyst deactivation. According to the data on transient kinetics described above (Fig. 6) this switching should be done when hydrogen concentration in reactor products decreases down to 30vol.% (after 22h of time on stream). The use of a fresh batch of catalyst is considered to be an acceptable practice for the hydrogen production by system described."
12,Conclusions,"The conclusions are as follows: 1. The highly concentrated CO x -free hydrogen during a long period of time was shown to be produced by catalytic propane decomposition on Ni–Cu catalysts. The studies demonstrated that the catalyst lifetime and product distribution of the catalytic propane decomposition strongly depend on the catalyst chemical composition and the reaction temperature. 2. The propane decomposition over Ni-based catalysts at temperatures 400–700°C is likely to occur on active centers of two types with the formation of chemisorbed S–CH x surface species. Depending on the strength of C–S (carbon–center) bonds in S–CH x species either the progressive loss of H atoms with the formation of carbon on the Ni particles surface (centers S1) or bonding of H atoms from the gaseous phase with the formation of methane (centers S2) could happen. The increase in selectivity of hydrogen is connected with deactivation of active centers S2. 3. The Ni (50wt.%)–Cu (40wt.%)/SiO2 was found to be the most appropriate for hydrogen production by propane decomposition at 600°C. Total hydrogen yield of 60.84mol H2/g cat (during 24h time on stream) and the total H2:CH4 ratio of 8.42 were shown to be attained with this catalyst. After removal of propane from reaction products the CO x -free mixture of hydrogen and methane containing more than 90vol.% of hydrogen can be obtained. This mixture is suitable for PEMFC as fuel. 4. Carbon nanofibers obtained by catalytic propane decomposition have stacked-cone structure as well as platelet structure with a wide distribution of carbon nanofiber diameters (10–500nm). The formation of branched and coiled nanofibers, carbon nanofibers ropes and nanofibers coated with pyrocarbon depending on the catalyst and the reaction temperature was observed. 5. The schematic diagram of propane decomposition system for the production of highly concentrated hydrogen for PEMFC and NFC as valuable by-product is proposed. The main advantage of the system is that hydrogen could be easily separated from propane."
