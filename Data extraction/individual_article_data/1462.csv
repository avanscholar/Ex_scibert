0,Introduction,"In this work, an integration approach (VFAs to PHAs conversion) was made effortful to review the probability for utilization of acid rich effluents of the acidogenic bio-H2 by an enhancement towards the efficiency for the treatment of those effluents. The existence of acetates is high among the VFAs in the effluents (Jayakrishnan et al., 2019). Such residual VFAs can act like a source of carbon for growth of microbes as well as precursors in favor of the production of various biodegradable biopolymers [polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)] (Ong et al., 2018). The entire process is economically viable, due to cost-effective production of both the bio-H2 and PHAs. These biocompatible PHAs are intracellular metabolic intermediates as well as carbon storage polymers and are promising alternative to synthetic non-biodegradable plastics like petrochemically-derived polymers (Ceyhan Guvensen and Ozdemir 2011). Furthermore, the PHAs are eco-friendly components due to their biodegradability by means of various microorganisms to convert potentially them into CO2 and water. These PHAs can be obtained from some soluble acid metabolic intermediates, called as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which are found in the dark fermentative effluents (DFE) from bio-H2 reactor. These are formed by acidogenic fermentation along with the production of bio-H2, at some stages (Mohan et al., 2007; Verlinden et al., 2007) and are additionally transformed into PHAs which is owing to the structure with low carbon atoms like 2C acetates, 3C propionates and 4C butyrates, on comparison with amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (Pagliano et al., 2017). These factors facilitate the ease of PHAs synthesis with necessity for neither glycolysis nor β-oxidation reaction path to carry out metabolic reactions in the presence of enzymes. Moreover, PHAs are able to fabricate some nutrients in a number of microorganisms viz Alcaligenes latus, Ralstonia eutropha, Azotobacter beijerinckii, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas oleovorans as well as in some fungi and archaea. In addition to these advantages utilization of VFAs as carbon source support the production of various copolymers of PHAs (Bhatia et al., 2018). Such copolymers can be produced, using VFAs as a carbon source without any addition of precursors during the fermentation process as acetate propionate and butyrate act as precursors for 3HB, 3HV and 3HHx monomer units, respectively. The production of PHAs mainly depends on the composition of VFAs and kind of the biocatalysts used in the form of various microbial populations (Brigham and Riedel, 2019). The significance of PHAs along with their co-polymers has been gained more and more importance, owing to not only for their structural diversity but also for their very near analogy to fossil-derived synthetic polymers. The rate of degradation, nature of the homopolymers (PHAs) as well as co- and heteropolymers mainly depend on their physical properties. Such properties can be synchronized to a greater extent via controlling the monomeric composition of PHAs by their structural alteration. Generally, the linear short-chain aliphatic mono-carboxylate VFAs can be produced via both synthetic petrochemical and biological fermentation processes. These are having carbon atoms of C1-C6 i.e., C1 formic, C2 acetic, C3 propionic, C4 butyric, C5 valeric and C6 caproic acids, which all play a crucial role, industrially. VFAs have been tremendously used for the chemical industries and precursors of not only for paraffins but also for carbonyl derivatives, alcohols, etc., (Dahiya et al., 2018) because of their carboxylate functional groups. Furthermore, these are potential substrates for the production of bioenergies in the form of methane and hydrogen apart from biopolymers viz polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) (Domingos et al., 2017). The valorization of VFAs provides efficiently the biorefineries with the presence of pure/mixed microbial cultures (MMCs) through a number of various metabolic paths (Garcia et al., 2018). It is mainly attributed to the lessening of the substrates dimensions, along with degrees of polymerization, which lead to a higher specific surface for the metabolic reaction paths for the enzymes of microbes. Generally, the glycerin, carbohydrates like molecular substrates from the waste streams are less suitable for valorization, although they make high COD levels into the substrates, they possess lower reaction kinetics for their biodegradation (Alibardi and Cossu, 2016). In contrast to VFAs, the glycerin, carbohydrates like molecular substrates are able to stick on the microbial cellular wall, which influences tremendously the transport of nutrients, consequentially there is an inhibition in the metabolic activities of the anaerobic microbes due to the absence of electron withdrawing oxygen atom of the carboxylate group (Alibardi and Cossu, 2016; Shen et al., 2017). Besides, the valorization of most of such substrates leads to production of some recalcitrant organic fractions. DF (dark fermentation) derived VFAs have also been utilized as a carbon source for some microalgae viz Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella protothecoides etc (Chalima et al., 2017). Alternatively, the techno-economic feasibility for the conversion pathways must be improved throughout the utilization of important by-products from dark fermentative effluents of hydrogen bioreactor, which majorly consists of VFAs (Strazzera et al., 2018). This article reviews the prospects of valorization the co-produced VFAs."
1,Microbial and biochemical dark fermentative bio-H2 production from organic biomass,"1.1 Microbial and biochemical dark fermentative bio-H2 production from organic biomass It is currently essential that the investigation and empowerment on the alternative ways for long term biorefineries production potential and certain platform chemicals from the conventional renewable clean carbon neutral sources. These can effectively reduce the green gas emissions along with other pollution problems, simultaneously that can be helpful in the reduced consumption of fossil fuels as well as economically convenient path ways on comparison to biological routes for energy production (HYVOLUTION, 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2018). Moreover, the carbon-free clean fuel bio-H2 via biochemical dark fermentation (DF) represents a promising alternative carrier of energy in the future. It leads to sustainable energy systems, owing to its social, economic as well as environmental recommendations especially in the aspect of its ultimate by-products of combustion is water molecules only (Kotay and Das, 2008; Kumar and Buitrón 2017). On the other hand, it is more costlier than the fossil-derived fuels. Bartels et al. (2010) and Crabtree et al. (2004) revealed the price of bio-H2 production from the coal and natural gas falls in the range between 0.36 and 1.83 and 2.48–3.17 $/kg, correspondingly. But, Das (2009) has reported a cost-effective and dark fermentative bio-H2 production from the sewage sludge ($1.3/Million British thermal unit, MBTU), on comparison with gasoline ($23.5/MBTU in 2008) and natural gas ($2–$7/MBTU, in 2007). At present, the most important barriers in the process of DF towards the production of bio-H2 are low yields and cost-intensivity. The yield mainly depends on the potent feedstock selection (Ren et al., 2011). The intrinsic confront of such DF processes is to capitalize on the conversion process efficiencies, utilization and valorization of the byproducts. It is used to curtail the ecological footprint on this valorization process by diminishing the requirement of water and energy input. In order to facilitate a scaled-up development and a competitive economic advantage on the DF process is to improve bio-H2 yield by utilization of the cost-effective feedstock materials as the waste biomasses from agriculture, municipalities and industries (Chong et al., 2009). Moreover, the by-products of DF process mainly include the VFAs, lactic acid, alcohols and the residues which are un-hydrolyzed. These all can effectively be consumed for valorization by other biological systems through the recovery of energy. They can also be used as feedstocks towards certain major economically important platform chemicals productivity (Ghimire et al., 2015a, b). At the time of bio-H2 production, the purple non sulfur bacteria (PNSB) can synthesize intracellular PHAs as well as PHBs (Hustede et al., 1993). A progress in such a recent DF technology involves that solid state dark fermentation (SSDF) process which leads to a development in biorefineries. It inturn leads to industrial development, due to its higher yields along with the necessity of low energy as well as water (Elsamadony and Tawfik, 2015; Motte et al., 2013). Apart from its potentiality, this technology further requires an immensive attention and improvement for the bio-H2 yield through optimization of the substrates consumption, enrichment of microbial community and regularizing the bioreactor equipped parameters viz temperature, pH and hydrogen partial pressure. DF process involves initially the conversion of glucose to pyruvate through glycolytic paths in the presence of H2 producing bacteria to produce ATP molecules (adenosine triphosphate) from both the ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and NADH moieties (Li and Fang, 2007; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). On further oxidation, the pyruvate forms acetyl-CoA (acetylcoenzyme A), CO2 (carbon dioxide) and bio-H2 in the presence of the enzymes namely hydrogenase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The pyruvate oxidizes into acetyl-CoA and formate which on further conversion, forms bio-H2 along with CO2 followed by the conversion of acetyl-CoA into acid derivatives like acetates, butyrates, and ethanol (Li and Fang, 2007). The formation of DF by-products predominantly depends on certain operational parameters, viz nature and loading rate of the substrates, pH, temperature and surrounding factors, as they also affect the structure of microbial communities of the bioreactors. Moreover, such pathways can be interceded with archea, Clostridia, methylotrophs, methanogenic bacteria, rumen bacteria, etc., Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and etc like some strict, facultative anaerobes. (Li and Fang, 2007). The most common products of DF are the VFAs which mainly include acetates and butyrates (Hawkes et al., 2007). When the metabolic path favors the C2 acetate stoichiometric production, 4 mol of bio-H2 to every mole of glucose, i.e., the yield at 25 °C is 544 in mL H2/g hexose while for a mole of glucose for bio-H2 is 2 mol i.e., 272 in mL H2/g hexose, if the end product is the butyrate (Li and Fang, 2007)."
2,Production of VFAs from various dark fermentative waste streams,"1.2 Production of VFAs from various dark fermentative waste streams VFAs are organo-carboxylate derivatives, having a range of applications. They are the sources of carbon nutrients to microbes that potentially fabricate valuable metabolites to exterminate the pollutants, existing in the waste streams. They can be used for the generation of bio-H2/electricity and they can supply the raw materials for long-chain fatty acids synthesis along with PHAs (Chen et al., 2017). All kinds viz, terrestrial, marine and aquatic biomasses can be utilized for the production of VFAs which inturn can be used for the biorefineries and the production of certain platform biochemicals to offer a solution for well-organized waste management. VFAs on valorization are efficiently transformed into a number of renewable carbon sources for many microbes (Sprague et al., 2016). It should be given a great attention for the enhancement in VFAs bio-based production, using various waste streams that to analyze the structure of microbial communities of the bioreactor and to assess their interactions with the productive metabolic paths. Furthermore, the utilization of fresh waste-streams as a substrate is definitely sustainable, economically feasible and an eco-friendly approach. Implementation of bio-augmentation strategy might enhance and ensures the VFAs production. The challenges in such an implementation need further research. 1.2.1 Dark fermentative production of VFAs Various biodegradable organic wastes that mainly comprise of carbohydrates, cellulose, fats, hemicelluloses and proteins like food wastes, fresh waste-streams and sludge yield the VFAs via DF process. It assists the growth of acidogenic bacteria which is more efficient and profitable than the common petrochemical processes that possess a unsafe environmental impact (Chalima et al., 2017). Dark fermentation is similar to the classical anaerobic digestion (AD) initially via hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis but finally the process at methanogenesis is inhibited by number of various methods (Arudchelvam et al., 2010). The initial rate determining hydrolytic step of AD process involves the enzymatic degradation of long polymeric structural units into simple organic monomeric moieties enzymatically namely carbohydrates, amino and fatty acids. These monomers can be fermented consequently through acidogenic populations in the process of acidogenesis, which leads to the yield of acetates along with a mixture of bio-H2and CO2. This rate-limiting nature that inhibits the degradation is owing to not only the total recalcitrance for the structure of biomass to make the substrate unavailable to hydrolysis, but also the existence of phenolic functionals, low C/N ratio and high levels of trace elements (Wikandari et al., 2013). So, to raise the VFAs production, the rate of hydrolysis should be enhanced via improving the biodegradation ability of the waste biomass materials with the employment of a suitable pretreatment, prior to any other biological treatment. It will convert potentially all the starting materials to susceptible for both enzymatic as well as microbial degradative reactions. Moreover, the rate of hydrolytic path has been improved by microwave/chemical/thermal/ultrasonic pretreatments. These all can be carried out in the presence of acid, alkali, surfactants, ozone and certain bioactive structures like enzymes of specific activities by targeting a particular waste component viz viscozyme on carbohydrates, flavourzyme on proteins and palatase on lipids (Zhou et al., 2014) to damage the cell walls. It leads to the release of intracellular components and to enhance the solubilization of extracellular constituents (Kim et al., 2005). Kim et al. (2006) utilized a mixture of viscozyme, flavourzyme and palatase enzymes in pretreatment of the raw food wastes increase the production of VFAs in DF process. Yang et al. (2010) explored that a sludge treatment, using amylases which is more proficient than one by means of proteases. In the acetogenesis stage, there occurs the breakdown of VFAs to additional bio-H2 and acetate formation (Singhania et al., 2013). The dark fermentation produces VFAs by the consumption of fatty acids in the presence of methanogens. Thereby, the last methanogenesic step for the waste stream is inhibited generally to prevent the growth of the specific bacteria by thermal pretreatment. Now, the methanogenic populations can be obliterated either by sustaining the pH of the mixture at >9.12 (Hu et al., 2013) or adding iodoform solution (Hu et al., 2013) or by adding iodoform solution (Fuet al., 2010). At this stage of inhibition by methanogenesis, the dark fermentation leads to accumulate bio-H2, VFAs, ethanol along with someother higher fatty acid derivatives like caproates and lactates (Ding et al., 2010). A well established technique which involves the production of VFAs via DF process is the MixAlco™ and is employed for the effective initial conversion of biomass into carboxylate derivatives by DF process with mixed-culture of microorganisms (Chalima et al., 2017). The process, in the second stage involves those acid derivatives which are converted to carbonyls and biorefineries. The attractive gain of this technique is based on the fact that the produced VFAs, themselves act as inhibitors thereby, they prevent further growth of the acidogens in the bioreactors, which results in slow production rates (Golub et al., 2011). 1.2.2 Various wastes for production of VFAs and their yield Waste organic streams with high organic load to populate the bacteria, formed by carbohydrates, cellulose, fats, hemicelluloses and proteins like organic components and are considered to be appropriate for the production of VFAs. The mostly available waste streams are different kinds of sludges and paper mill/agricultural industrial wastewaters as well as food wastes, for the DF process (Table 1 ). In many cases, the streams utilized are blend of different waste streams for the production of VFAs for example, agricultural wastes- animal manure (Fuet al., 2010) and WAS (waste activated sludge)-corn stover (Zhou et al., 2013). The destination behind the blending process on a range of wastes is to make the substrate of a carbohydrate:protein balanced ratio, that in sequence makes a C/N balanced ratio. From the various experiments (Chalima et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2009), it is concluded that an increase in C/N ratio (20/1–30/1) supports the growth of microorganisms which are accountable for the acidogenesis. In addition, the carbohydrate might have a synergistic effect by way of the WAS. The accumulation of carbohydrate rich waste stream to the original substrate favors an improvement in the VFAs productivity; which is due to the fact that the synergistic effect of the sugar moieties of the organic stream (Feng et al., 2009). Pessiot et al., (2012) have found the production of an appropriate amount of VFAs from protein-waste streams like slaughter house waste and the emissions of N2 gas along with the production N3– ions were also buffered simultaneously during the production of VFAs. Furthermore, there is no need to add a buffer feed to the nitrogen rich waste organic streams to maintain a high pH, during the period of DF. The liquid stream product of DF process consists of a dominant mixture of VFAs which mainly comprises of acetic and propionic followed by butyric acids. Amongst, the significance of acetic acid is higher as it is effort lessly utilized by a number of microorganisms than the other organic acids (Atasoy et al., 2018). On the other hand it is one of the hazardous pollutants, so it should be consumed profitably in favor of the fabrication of various high value-added products. The structural fractions of VFAs in the product stream majorly based on certain varying factors, such as category of the waste stream, pH, duration of the fermentation process, etc (Lee et al., 2014). The pH significantly interferes the different VFAs production, out of all the other factors. If the pH values fall in the range between 4.0 and 5.0, 6.0–7.0 and 8.0–9.0, the products will be propionic acid (fermentation of a synthetic gelatin wastewater) acetic and butyric acids (fermentation of activated sludge) respectively (Chen et al., 2017). It is also observed that the elevated C/N ratio always favors propionic acids production, at appropriate pH and this product can effectively be utilized to enhance the nutrients like phosphorus removal from the wastewater stream which contains VFAs as the carbon sources (Chalima et al., 2017). 1.2.3 VFAS for biorefineries and platform chemicals Fermentation techniques have been paid much more attention, owing to their economic and environmental compensation. Determination of the VFAs along with dark fermentative pathways for the productivity of high value-added products represents the sustainable value chains in favor of the consumption of biomass wastes. Parenthetically, the VFAs from dark fermentative effluent can offer an instant environmental relief by potentially providing a podium that enables the production of biorefineries and platform chemicals in a sustainable manner with lower CO2 emissions. Such a podium offers unique advantages, when compared to other biorefineries like thermochemical syngas, sugar and biogas (Chang et al., 2010). Furthermore, that facilitates the consumption of biomasses of all types and waste streams to yield VFAs in cost-effective manner, at the same time there is co-production of bio-H2. The literature found that, the European has funded a project on VOLATILE (Grant Agreement No. 720777) (Chalima et al., 2017) which offers a big opening to convert municipal solid and sludgy biowastes efficiently into VFAs. These VFAs inturn can be utilized as carbon sources for the production of high value-added fermentation yields to obtain the biopolymers in the form of PHAs along with their co-products (Chang et al., 2010)."
3,Valorization of dark fermentation effluents to biopolymers,"1.3 Valorization of dark fermentation effluents to biopolymers VFAs are the important intermediate products produced by DF process of the substrates involving waste streams primarily like, waste activated sludge and food wastes. The DF has a number of steps in which the organic matter has completely undergoes biodegradation via microbial consortium with the absence of oxygen and frequently it leads to the accumulation of bio-gaseous products along with VFAs intermediates (Liu et al., 2018; Sivagurunathan et al., 2018). In the DF process even for the lab scale studies, production of VFAs is encouraged by restricting the time duration of the reaction to inhibit the growth of methanogens in the methanogenesic stage via adjustment of the pH at >8.0 or < 6.0, consequently there is a raise in the VFAs formation (Zhou et al., 2018). So produced VFAs from the bio-H2 waste water treatment plants is not only utilized to produce the biopolymers but also as a carbon source in a denitrification method which is the process of removal of biological nitrogen from the wastewater streams that involves nitrification aerobically, followed by denitrification anoxically. Conservatively, the required carbon sources for the denitrification are methanol, glucose as well as VFAs, especially the acetate derivatives are consumed. Amongst, the VFAs from the waste waters ensure a cheap substitute for the carbon sources in favor of the denitrification technique (Atasoy et al., 2018)."
4,Production pathways of VFAs,"1.4 Production pathways of VFAs The basic steps in the generation of VFAs involves carbohydrates metabolism towards the formation of pyruvate. Here, 2 mol of hydrogen is generated theoretically along with consequent production of the NADH. In most of the bacteria, the metabolic pathways to form the pyruvate are frequently carried out by means of the EMP metabolic path (Ntaikou et al., 2010). Furthermore, the key factor for the production of bio-H2 from the organic material is acetyl-CoA, that is further formed by the pyruvate and that will in fact define the maximum theoretical yield of bio-H2. The enzymatic system that a microorganism provides is the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase to catalyze the generation of the acetyl-CoA and ferredoxinred (reduced ferredoxin) via oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction is catalyzed by ferredoxinox (oxidized ferredoxin) which is the coenzyme that acts as electron accepter (Uyeda and Rabinowitz, 1971). This enzyme can be found in several strictly anaerobic (Buchanan, 1972) and in facultative anaerobic bacteria (Ntaikou et al., 2010). The enzyme catalyzes the formation of acetoin (3-hydroxybutanone) with the presence of pyruvate and carbohydrate and hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate (Hydroxyethyl-TPP) is an intermediate of this reaction path. The mechanistic path involves the reduction of enzymatically bound chromophores that is comprised of a non-heme iron and sulfide by the addition of pyruvate, thereby reoxidation of CoA in the presence of ferredoxin (FAD), which is a primary electron acceptor. It results in bleaching of the ferredoxin chromophores to form stoichiometric quantity of acetyl-CoA. The final step of the reaction is the transfer of the electrons from the reduced enzyme chromophore to an externally added electron carrier, thereby; enzyme chromophore can be bleached by ferredoxinred. The acetyl-CoA can be metabolized either to acetate or to butyrate, and in both cases re-oxidation with the presence of hydrogenase enzyme as a catalyst for each mole of ferredoxin along with the generation of one mole of hydrogen occurs (Ntaikou et al., 2010). Moreover, accumulation of an extra mole of hydrogen also has obtained from each mole of NADH by reduction, which was produced at the time of glycolysis process, to NAD+, leads to hydrogen yield of about a total of 4 mol/mol of the used carbohydrate moieties, mostly as glucose, if acetates is the final product whereas in the case that butyrate. The NADH is used in fact for the oxidation of acetoacetyl-CoA to yield butyrate, and thereby the final total hydrogen yield is 2 mol/mol of the utilized glucose via glycolysis by NADH which can be generated during glycolysis. In another way, the acetyl-CoA forms a simultaneous production of formate (Neidhardt et al., 1987) which is catalyzed by pyruvate-formate lyase enzyme (Knappe et al., 1974), in the presence of certain microbes like Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli (Ntaikou et al., 2010) under anaerobic conditions (Gottschalk, 1986)."
5,Characteristics of various VFAs,"1.5 Characteristics of various VFAs VFAs can be produced synthetically as well as biologically from petro-chemical derivatives and - fermentation process respectively. The market demand in the case of VFAs depends on 90% of the petro-based production techniques. Various VFAs viz formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, caproic acids, etc., possess different characteristics, thereby they all have been their own attractive wide range of applications in the production of biorefineries, platform chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food industries on the market (Atasoy et al., 2018). Further, the acetic acid is a key component and is utilized in the manufacture of paint, paper coating, pesticides, plastics, platform chemicals, polymeric emulsions, rubber, synthetic fibres, textile finishes and it is one of the main ingredients in the manufacture of food and beverage industries as flavors, acidity regulators, preservatives which is due to its ability to produce some bacterial populations and are utilized as the raw materials for drinks, cellulose and certain foods (Bhatia and Yang, 2017). The acetic acid can be produced largely from fossil-based feedstocks via methanol carboxylation (Qian et al., 2016), even if there is a number of bio-based production techniques like oxidative and anaerobic fermentations. It is owing to the low productivity through the inhibition of bacterial population viz some microbes (Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, and Gluconobacter) and are the commonly used commercial ones (Atasoy et al., 2018) in low pH, for the production of acetic acid by means of fermentation process. So, these days the researchers have been paid attention to enhance the acetic acid productivity by budding the strains of bacteria with optimized operation conditions. The C3 propionic acid is a main constituent in the manufacture of vitamin E and can be used as artificial fruit flavours, in inorganic calcium and sodium salts, flavours, herbicides, green solvents, emulsions, coating formulations, customized synthetic cellulose fibres, preservatives, animal feeds, grains, etc., (Atasoy et al., 2018). The propionic acid production can be carried out from petroleum feedstocks via either by formylation/oxidation/carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of CO and H2O or from the hydrocarbons (HCs) via direct oxidation (Xu and Jiang, 2011). In addition, it is one of the by-products as small quantities during acetic acid production. Besides, fermentation is a remarkable alternative procedure to fabricate the propionic acid from the renewable sources. The bio-based butyric acid is not only a valuable biodiesel source but also a most proficient energy source in favor of poultry and swine. It can be used in the animal feed, because of it has anticancer activities as well as anti-pathogenic capability, as it stimulates cellular morphological and biochemical segregation (Xu and Jiang, 2011; Atasoy et al., 2018). Moreover, it has approved as a flavouring agent to add taste and aroma for food stuffs through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Hatti-Kaul et al., 2007). Generally, crude oil derived propylene by oxo synthesis yields butyraldehyde which on oxidation forms butyric acid, though it possesses lower production cost and the frequently available raw materials, this way of production is not all a natural one and so, it cannot be utilized in some industries like food/beverage. The additional technique is its removal from butter with 2–4% butyric acid, but it is both cost as well as energy intensive. Thereby, the dark fermentation via some micro-organisms (Hatti-Kaul et al., 2007) like Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Butyribacterium sp., Clostridium butyricum, C. acetobutylicum, C. barkeri, C. kluyveri, C. pasteurianum, Eubacteriumlimosum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Megasphaera sp., Peptococcus asacelarolyticus, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, and Sarcina sp., have been gathered more attention by reason of consumer desire on organic natural products."
6,Biopolymer accumulation,"The bacterial PHAs can be accumulated as non-sized aqueous insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions, existing in microbial cells as carbon/energy storage materials via the process of deposition of growth-limiting bio-polyesters along with some other nutrients and excess of carbon sources in Eubacteria and Archaea. The generation of PHAs, using mixed microbial cultures is more energy-efficient on comparison with the pure culture (Saraphirom et al., 2013). The cellular reactions of PHAs accumulation are based on the metabolic balance and here such PHAs can act as energy and reductant reservoir. The mechanistic pathways involve three steps. The first step involves two acetyl-CoA molecules that undergo catalytic condensation ‘to generate acetoacetyl-CoA, in the presence of β-ketothiolase (PhaA), it is followed by a simultaneous release of a co-enzyme namely HS-CoA (Sudesh et al., 2000). The second fatty acid de nova synthetic pathway involves the catalysis of acetoacetyl-CoA reduction to produce 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which depends on the NADPH with the presence of NADP-acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB). The final step is the polymerization of hydroxyacyl-CoA to produce PHAs and is catalyzed by the enzyme PHA synthase (PhaC), it is also followed by a simultaneous release of the co-enzyme HS-CoA similar to step I. This enzyme is very crucial for the synthesis of PHAs in all the microbial species, especially for the species like Rhizobia, Ralstonia eutropha, (Doi et al., 1989; Trainer and Charles, 2006) etc. Based on the various types of precursors, dissimilar PHAs can be synthesized via such a common mechanism that mostly comprise of only 3 to 5 carbon atoms (Sudesh et al., 2000). Moreover, here under the microbial production, structures, properties, applications and advances of various PHAs and their co-polymers have been reviewed."
7,Microbial production of PHAs and their co-polymers,"2.1 Microbial production of PHAs and their co-polymers Generally, dark fermentation (DF) of biological waste sources like apple pomace, banana (Reddy et al., 2003), broken food grains, mill effluents, municipal wastes, palm oil and pea shells, includes a multi–step path processes say hydrolysis, acidogenic and acetogenic paths to produce the lower VFAs. The formed VFAs with lower carbons are the main precursors for the production of PHAs. Similarly, some of the microbes viz Azotobacter beijerincki, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus megaterium, Nocardia, Pseudomonas oleovorans, and Rhizobium may be used in the production of lower VFAs and all inturn can act as main substrates for the production of PHAs (Reddy et al., 2003). In general, PHAs and its co-polymers are a kind of biological polyesters, composed of hydroxyalkanate monomers, made naturally by various microbes/microorganisms from different VFAs (Kourmentza and Kornaros, 2016). More than 150 different kinds of PHAs are generated by various genres of bacteria under different growth conditions. The polymeric precursors of short /medium chain length are produced through different biosynthetic pathways. In microbes 3HB production occurs with the presence of acetyl-CoA enzymes through PhaA(ß-ketothiolase) and PhaB (acetoacetyl Co-A reductase), at the same time there is 3HHx production by ß-oxidation for fatty acid synthesis, consequently the monomers of medium polymeric chain compounds are also produced which involves enoyl-CoA or 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP by PhaJ [(R)-specific enoyl coenzyme-A hydratase]/PhaG (3-hydroxyacyl-ACP: CoA transferase), respectively and are polymerized into PHA by means of PhaC (PHA synthase) (Jeon et al., 2014). Naturally microbes produce these precursors in low amount which results in copolymers with lower fraction of such kinds of specific monomers (3HV, 3HHx etc.). To increase the monomers units (3HV, 3HHx) fraction, the researchers have been used metabolic engineering approach and precursors feeding approaches. All these methods affect the PHAs production cost, while utilization of VFAs as a carbon source can help to overcome such limitations as various organic acids present in VFAs can act as precursors for monomeric units (acetate for hydroxybutyrate, propionate for hydroxyvalerate, butyrate for hydroxyhexanoate). Moreover, a variety of microbes or microorganisms are used or identified as PHAs and its copolymeric producers based on the carbon sources and they are represented in Table 2 . Moreover, the recombinant strains namely Ralstonia eutropha (A. eutrophus), Wautersia eutropha, Azotobacter sp. (García et al., 2014), Bacillus sp. (Kanjanachumpol et al., 2013), Pseudomonas sp. (Cai et al., 2009), Burkholderia sp. (Chee et al., 2010), Halomonas sp. (Kawata and Aiba, 2010), Haloferaxsp. (Huang et al., 2006), Ameromonassp. (Shen et al., 2009), Methylobacterium sp. (Nath et al., 2008), Thermus thermophiles (Pantazaki et al., 2009), Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava (Povolo and Casella 2003), Azohydromonas latus (A. lata) (Suwannasing et al., 2015), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Kars et al, 2008), Zobellela denitrificans (Ibrahim and Steinbuchel, 2010), Activated sludge (Rodgers and Wu, 2010), Cyanobacteria (Balaji et al., 2013), Chromobacterium sp. (Bhubalan et al., 2010) and the recombinant E. coli (Jian et al., 2010) can be used. Further, the recombinant E. coli strains are heltering the Alcaligenes eutrophus on PHA biosynthetic genes, thereby a stable high copied number of plasmids have been developed and used for high PHA production because the E. coli strains have been used in various sources of carbon like glucose, sucrose, lactose and xylose, however, using inexpensive C-sources like molasses, whey, starch, and hemicellulose hydrolysate, which all may reduce the cost of PHAs and its co-polymer productivity."
8,Structures and properties of various PHAs,"2.2 Structures and properties of various PHAs Generally, more than 150 genres of PHAs contain the monomeric units of hydroxycarboxylic acid group i.e., the PHAs consist of (R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids (as the main repeating or monomeric unit) with various side chains which have been identified (Zhang et al., 2009) but in some cases the hydroxy substitution could present at 4th or 5th position in PHAs. When the alkyl or pendant group (R) group varies from C1 to C13 carbon with saturated or unsaturated or nature of the substituent and also the rectus (R) configuration exist in most of the PHAs structure. Based on the length of alkyl side chain that includes aromatic, halogenated, epoxidized or other branched monomers present in the PHAs and their co–polymers are further classified as three different kinds (Liong, 2015) due to the substrate specificity of PHAs synthases. They are: (i) short chain (C3–C5) hydroxyalkanoic acids (PHASCL) which has an alkyl side chain can be produced by many bacteria like Ralstonia eutropha, (also known as Cupriavidus necator), Alcaligenes latus, etc., for example P3HB, P3HV, P4HB and co–polymer of P(3HB–co–3HV), (ii) medium chain (C6–C14) hydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAMCL) which has an alkyl side chain are produced by Pseudomonas oleovorans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas mendocina and Pseudomonas sensustricto, for example P3HHx, P3HO and co-polymer of P(3HHx–co–3HO) and (iii) long chain (>C14) hydroxyalkanoic acids (PHALCL) with an alkyl side chain can be produced by Shewanella oneidensis and Aureispira marina. In 1983, the PHAMCL were first isolated from P. oleovorans (Rai et al., 2011). The hybrid polymers comprise of short and medium carbon monomeric units namely poly(3-hydroxybutyrate–co–3-hydroxyhexanoate) (Castilho et al., 2009). Due to such diversities in the size as well as their chemical composition of the side chain substituents of the PHAs, these are responsible for chemical modification and such properties could lead to several applications of PHAs and their co–polymers in number of fields. The presence of monomeric units in PHAs could vary, owing to their chemical structure and their material characteristics. The structure of PHAs depends on the nature of carbon substrates to attain the desired monomer units, with homopolymeric or heteropolymeric contents (Rai et al., 2011). Moreover, the length of pendant groups (R) is short (PHASCL) and have been shown hard crystalline materials whereas in long PHALCL, shown elastomeric nature, due to their chemical structure and also the monomeric present fractions. Further, the PHAs and PHBs are more comparable to polypropylene and shows excellent resistance to moisture as well as UV radiation (Liong, 2015). The monomeric nature and their chemical composition of the PHAs and their co–polymeric structure are eco–friendlier as well as environmentally biodegradable (both in soil and air) and biocompatible nature and also they can act as significant piezoelectric materials."
9,PHAs and their applications,"2.3 PHAs and their applications Mostly, the PHAs obtained from a variety of renewable resources in the presence of microorganisms and are intracellular carbon as well as energy storage components. These are environmentally biodegradable thermo-, non-toxic and biocompatible polymers. Additionally, they are having high degree of polymerization, crystalline, optically dynamic, isotactic, piezoelectric nature and insoluble in aqueous (H2O) medium. Such salient novel characteristics of PHAs show a wide scope of usages in many areas and lead to make highly aggressive polypropylene (which is similar petro- derived plastic) products. At first, PHAs are widely utilized in hustling films bags, containers and paper coatings as well as similar application, analogous to conventional plastics wares which incorporate the dispensable or disposal items like razors, utensils, diapers, cosmetic containers, cleanser jugs or shampoo bottles and cups i.e., PHAs can act as a potent plastic material. In April 1990, A.G. Wella launched the first consumer items, made of PHAs as shampoo bottles. An US–based company produces elastomeric Metabolix PHA and it can be used for the production of food additives approved by FDA. PHAs have been employed in the manufacture of foils, films and diaphragms. The industrially P (3HB-3HHx) can be obtained by Aeromonas hydrophilais, widely utilized to make shock wave sensors, ultrasonic detectors, headphones, loudspeakers, sound pressure measuring instruments, etc (Anjum et al., 2016). PHAs and their derivatives laminated with paper/other polymeric (PVC) materials are widely utilized as raw materials for the production of ecofriendly as well as readily biodegradability bags and also, PHAs can be used as personal hygiene articles like diapers, napkins, sanitary towels, tampons etc (Volova, 2004). In addition, stereoregular PHAs are the valuable chiral precursors and utilized in the synthesis of optically active compounds that are utilized especially as economically viable products like biodegradable carriers for long term dosage of drugs, insecticides as well as herbicides. Due to their significant piezoelectric properties, PHAs may be utilized as ostosynthetic materials in the incitement of bone development devices including biodegradable screws, rivets, bone plating systems, bone plates for cartilage and bone fixation, surgical sutures, surgical meshes, bone dowels, blood vessel replacements, orthopedic pins, nerve guides, tendon repair devices, in human being (Bian et al., 2009). However, the limited utilization of PHAs in medical, clinical as well as pharmaceutical fields is attributed to their slow biodegradation as well as high hydraulic stability in sterile tissues (Wang et al., 2008). Further, the PHAs are considered as raw materials for the production of paints and may be utilized as green solvents for the replacement of existing solvents. The PHAs are in fact depolymerized to sound sources of optically active bifunctional hydroxy acids, for example PHAs on hydrolysis yield R-3-hydroxybutric acid and in tandem with R-1,3-butanediol (Brandl et al., 1988), which are widely utilized for the Merk’s anti–glaucoma drug in Truspot and β-lactams. Moreover, plant derived PHAs, under depolymerization followed by simple or direct esterification path can be used in the large scale production of chemicals (Bonartsev et al., 2006). Recently, the esterification products of both the mcl PHAs and PHBs could be used in biorefineries as fuels (Zhang et al., 2009). In addition, P(4HB) has been found to be a suitable scaffold for preparingautologous cardiovascular tissue (Chee et al., 2010)."
10,Advances in PHAs,"2.4 Advances in PHAs Recently, in the development of packing devices, agriculture, industrial and pharmacological as well as clinical fields, the utilization of bio-based as well as easily biodegradable PHAs and their co-polymeric materials depends on the nature of their monomeric units and the blends added. In addition, various blends of PHAs and their co-polymers have been synthesised to minimize the production cost, at the same time to improve the quality of PHAs. Compatibility of the blends of PHAs-rubber like PEGs [poly(ethylene glycols), PVAcs [poly(vinyl acetates], PVAs [poly(vinyl alcohols)], PEOs [poly(ethylene oxides)], PVFs [poly(vinyl fluorides)], PHEMs [poly(2-hydroxymetcrylates], PVPs [poly(vinyl phenols)], PCs [poly(caprolactones)], PPCs [poly(propylene carbonates)] and PBSs [poly(butylene succinates)] (Anjum et al., 2016) have been studied and already reported. Moreover, the natural biodegradable polysaccharides mostly include cellulose, starch and their derivatives and they have been blended with PHAs, which has also been reported. A potent hybrid fibrous membranes positively has grown via electrospinning with the blended solution of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate–co–hydroxybutyrate) or chitosan (Anjum et al., 2016). Potato peel waste derived green composites (PHBs) possess good thermo-physical and biodegradation nature which was studied by Liong (2015). The synthesis or fabrication of polymeric nanocomposites is further utilized in nanocomposite membrane, it was studied previously to pervaporate effectively a mixture of 1, 4–dioxane and water (Liong, 2015)."
11,Economy in the production of PHAs,"All the fermentation conditions should be standardized for the flourishing accomplishment of PHAs production systems, commercially as the cost of the products eventually depends on the price of the substrate, PHAs yield by the substrate, and efficient formulation of the products via the downstream processing (Lee, 1996) which entails high levels of PHAs, in terms of the percentage of cell dry weight and high yield in grams of the product/unit volume and time (de Koning et al., 1997). The price of PHAs by means of the natural producer A. eutrophus is about US$16/kg, ie., eighteen times costlier than the polymer polypropylene with the producer is recombinant E. coli, thereby the price of PHAs is reduced towards US$4/kg, and is just near to other recyclable polymers like aliphatic polyesters, poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) (P[3HB]), etc. Moreover, the commercially feasible value should come to US$3–5/kg (Lee, 1996). Due to the increase in oil prices, the development of PHBs was begun by ImperialChemical Industries (ICI) in 1975–76. From A. eutrophus(H16), ICI has started manufacturing of Biopolas early as in 1982 and the Cargill Dow polymers have been marketed its EcoPla polymeric resins in Japan. Novamont’s starch-based material namely Mater-Bi has also been marketed there by Nippon Gohsei, which has been used in transport packaging for electrical goods,agricultural mulch film and in composting trials. Mitsubishiand Nippon Shokubai with the trade names, LUNARE ZT and Lunare SEadvertise Enviro Plastic Bionolle which is thermoplastic aliphatic polyester and is produced via polycondensation of glycol with dicarboxylicacids by Showa Highpolymer and Denko of Japan (Reddy et al., 2003). Lacea is another kind of biopolymer, produced from the resources like corn, beet, cane, and tapioca and is comparable to both polystyrene/polythene due to its transparency, processability, good mould resistance, low heat of combustion, superior processing stability and biodegradability. The Daicel Chemical Industries of Japan has developed biodegradable blends of two different materials namely polycaprolactone and acetyl cellulose resin under the name of Celgreen (Reddy et al., 2003). Further, Shimadzu has developed a fermentation process for lactic acid and collaborated with Mitsubishi Plastics Industries for the development of poly-L-lactic acid and such resins are marketed under the brand name L acty. The starch and polysaccharides based biopolymers viz Eco-Ware, Eco-Foam and Cardoran & Pulluran have been manufactured by Japan based industries (Reddy et al., 2003)."
12,Technological challenges and strategies for efficient production of PHAs,"Even supposing, PHAs are the promising materials for the production of eco-friendly polymers, the fabrication price along with some technical challenges limit their industrial applications. The studies on efficient production of PHAs, over the period of 2014–2018 show an evolution on the research development towards their productivity for a flourishing full-scale accomplishment (Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2018). The huge increase in the production of PHAs is linked to the market requirement of biopolymers at competitive prices, when compared to the fossil-derived polymers. During the timeline between 2012 and 2014, the researchers were mostly focused their interest on improving the microbial strains as super productive by selection and DNA extraction (Wang et al., 2015). The studies in 2015, were mostly highlighted the cost-effective recycling process of the wastes, generated from PHAs production as well as high value added-products (Liu et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). Furthermore, the studies have tried to identify the technical challenges in the improvement for the implementation process of biopolymers production, based on industrial scale (Mohammadi et al., 2012). In the timeline of 2016, the authors (Tai et al., 2016) have paid their attention to the improvement of the production and dissimilar strategies and are employed to diminish the price by applying genetic engineering and operational dark fermentation key factors (Liu et al., 2015). In addition, the integration of the PHAs productivity for the industrial processes via the utilization of different cultures and wastes as carbon sources have given importance in this period of time (Anjum et al., 2016; Koller et al., 2017; Mohan et al., 2016; Valentino et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018). The literature found the optimization in the PHAs purification/extraction step (Liu et al., 2015), to acquire PHAs with high economical importance and potential applications (Anjum et al., 2016; Mohammadi et al., 2012) by execution of continuous processes (Anjum et al., 2016; Kaur and Roy, 2015; Valentino et al., 2017; Koller et al., 2017; Mohan et al., 2016) to study the dissimilar feed streams (Liu et al., 2015; Valentino et al., 2017; Koller et al., 2017; Mohan et al., 2016; Obruca et al., 2015) to recycle the bacterial residues, generated from PHAs production (Weiet al., 2015) to reduce the consumption of energy on the PHAs production process (Mohammadi et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015), assimilation via integration of bio-refinery systems (Jiang et al., 2016), and to increase the yield of PHAs production (Liu et al., 2015). The strategies to improve the accumulation of PHAs in terms of productivity as well as polymeric nature with a three-step process towards the productivity as of sugar molasses reveals that a substantial increase in the volumetric productivity, by the employment of a continuous feeding strategy rather than a pulse feeding one, not only facilitate the mitigation of the process constraints, but also allocate excess uptake of the substrate. Thereby, polymer storage to be preserved which is due to a constant residual active mass of the substrate. This can be an attractive alternative for the manipulation of the composition of polymers, which can be synthesized from bio-H2 fermented effluent. Moreover, the range of PHAs compositions obtained is subsequently resulted in different polymeric molecular weight which is slightly lower than those usually produced from fully aerobic mixed cultures and thermal properties, although still far above the ground for thermoplastic processing (Albuquerquea et al., 2011). Bacterial based PHAs have been received commercial attention from the 1960s with an American company, W.R. Grace, although it appears that was terminated by reason of some technological challenges (Pagliano et al., 2017). Due to an awareness of global environment, some technological challenges and strategies it was discontinued (Pagliano et al., 2017). Recently, aside from the researches on the production of PHAs with a single strain, more researches have been concentrated, using mixed microbial culture along with their utilization in bio-nutrient-removal (BNR) system (Zhu et al., 2018). In such a BNR system, the capability to generate and stock up the PHAs shows the way to change in the microbial populations and concludes the choice of main functional species. It seems to be crucial one that the synthesis and storage of PHAs as a function of microbial communities depends on the changes in the ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature and the types and the magnitude of carbon sources. Moreover, the PHA synthesis can be enhanced during horizontal gene transfer between dissimilar species (Ciesielski et al., 2006) via the genomic analysis of Pseudomonas extremaustralis which reveals the continuation of another gene cluster related to PHBs. The research results enlighten the upgrading in the capability of PHAs under the culture of mixed microbes for their effective BNR system from genomic level (Zhu et al., 2018). To make PHAs production more economic, the researchers are also working on coproduction of other valuable compounds like amino acids, biosurfactants, bioalcohols and organic acids along with PHAs (Li et al., 2017). In addition, a combined strategy for PHA production from crude glycerol by means of mixed culture was also studied (Burniol-figols et al., 2018). The biochemical large and industrial scale production of PHAs and their co-polymers can be carried out from various types of organic byproducts, particularly from the waste streams in the presence of a range of bacteria namely Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes latus, Azotobacter vinelandii, Azotobacter chroococcum, Azotobacter beijerincki, methylotrophs, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Rhizobium spp., Nocardia spp., and recombinant Escherichia coli. Subsequently, a development in the case of certain microbial strains of high-performance and the consumption of by-products along with the wastes as substrates should practically build the production price of recyclable polymers, and are analogous to those of the obligatory petro-derived polymers. The literature found the use of such substrates as both organic carbon and suitable substitutes for energy sources to fabricate biohydrogen during dark fermentation process under anaerobic circumstances. Thereby, concomitantly both bioenergy as well as biopolymers have been obtained at a reasonable cost. In this regard, here a view on the appropriate substrates and microbes utilized for both cost-effective PHAs and bio-H2 production has discussed along with the possibility of framing an integrated feasible system, using by-products and wastes as the sources. It signifies a novel approach for a simultaneous co-production of both the bioenergy as well as biopolymers for industrial applications, by means of the organic carbon sources viz by-products and wastes. The incorporated system is a flexible one, that target to generate volatile acids as of carbon rich solid organic waste streams in the presence of selected microbial strains/mixed cultures for elevated PHAs production with particular active feeding circumstances and thereby to generate the bioenergy and accumulation of PHAs, using the acidogenic effluents. The bio-based polymers will absolutely replace the conventional fossil-derived ones, if the production techniques are cost-effective. Additionally, the utilization of bacteria fed for high-performing organic wastes as well as by-products as carbon substrates are considerably contributed to achieve such a target."
13,Conclusions,"Biotechniques can be utilized for a novel and eco-sustainable processes in consistent with technical feasibility, simplicity and economic-viability for the conversion of the organic wastes to both bioenergy as well as chemicals, either individually or concurrently. This review highlighted the production of VFAs from dark fermentative H2 production fed with various waste streams, valorization of dark fermentation effluents to PHAs, structure and properties of the biopolymers and their applications. As the production techniques becomes cost-effective, and the utilization of bacteria fed are high-performing with organic wastes and by-products, the bio-based polymers would substitute conventional fossil-derived plastics in near future."
