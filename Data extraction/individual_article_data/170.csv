0,Introduction,"Acetone is a byproduct of the cumene process for phenol. The growing demand of phenol for phenolic resins and polycarbonates leads to the surplus production of byproduct acetone. The difference between global acetone production and demand is estimated as 1.7 million tons. Therefore, a significant upgradation of acetone to valuable products is required for better economy of the process. Catalytic hydrogenation of acetone in both vapor and liquid phases for synthesis of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) has been explored since several decades over various catalysts. Isopropyl alcohol is widely used as a solvent and chemical intermediate in various industries. As a solvent, it finds application in paint industry, inks industry, electronic industry, food and pharmaceutical industries. Chemical derivatives such as isopropyl ethers, isopropyl esters, isopropyl amines, etc. are manufactured using IPA. Moreover, IPA can be used to produce cumene by the alkylation of benzene. This will reduce the demand of propylene for phenol production, which in turn will reduce our dependence on petroleum for propylene. The commercial IPA manufacturing process comprises indirect and direct hydration of propylene. The indirect hydration process causes separation and corrosion problems as it uses sulphuric acid as the catalyst. The direct process is less corrosive but, it requires pure propylene unlike indirect process, which uses dilute propylene from refinery stream. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenation of acetone over solid catalysts serves as a better option for synthesis of IPA [1]. Hydrogenation of acetone to IPA is a reversible reaction. The forward reaction is exothermic and the backward dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic. So, the reaction can be used as a potential chemical heat pump system [2]. But, to achieve this, a high selectivity of IPA is required. The other reactions that occur along with direct hydrogenation cause the formation of diacetone alcohol (DAA), mesityl oxide (MO) and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The reactions are: Direct hydrogenation of acetone to IPA (1) C H 3 2 CO + H 2 → C H 3 2 CHOH ΔH = - 55 kJ/mol Condensation of acetone to diacetone alcohol (2) 2 ( C H 3 ) 2 CO → ( C H 3 ) C ( O ) C H 2 C ( O H ) ( C H 3 ) 2 ΔH = - 23 kJ/mol Dehydration of diacetone alcohol to mesityl oxide (3) C H 3 C ( O ) C H 2 C ( O H ) ( C H 3 ) 2 → ( C H 3 ) C ( O ) CH = C ( C H 3 ) 2 ΔH = 21 kJ/mol Hydrogenation of mesityl oxide to methyl isobutyl ketone (4) C H 3 C ( O ) CH = C ( C H 3 ) 2 + H 2 → ( C H 3 ) C ( O ) C H 2 CH ( C H 3 ) 2 ΔH = - 21 kJ/mol The catalysts which showed high IPA selectivity are Raney nickel [3–5], nickel-copper alloys [6], supported noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir) [7–12] and copper chromite [13]. There are certain demerits of the preferred catalysts such as pyrophoric nature of Raney nickel (causing handling problems), expensive noble metals and toxic nature of chromites (environmental hazard). A lot of research work has been carried out to explore promising hydrogenation catalysts that are less harmful. In recent years, researchers have identified many potential compounds showing hydrogenation activity. A lot of work has been done with silica, alumina and hydrotalcite supported metals [14–20]. Recently, Yan et al. [21] investigated hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid over copper based hydrotalcites. Zhou et al. [22] prepared a series of Cu-Mg-Al hydrotalcites and studied hydrogenation of furfural in aqueous phase. However, acetone hydrogenation to IPA over copper based mixed oxides derived from hydrotalcites is not reported so far. The hydrotalcite catalysts can be prepared from cheap precursors. They are having remarkable properties, which include appreciable surface area, tailorable acidic and basic properties, high metal dispersion, stability against sintering, etc. The present work was, therefore, undertaken to explore the efficacy of bimetallic Cu-Al mixed oxide in converting acetone to IPA by hydrogenation. A further objective of this work is to establish the optimum copper loading of such Cu-based hydrogenation catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO3)3.9H2O], Copper nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2.3H2O] and Sodium carbonate were supplied by Merck (India) Ltd., Mumbai, India. Sodium hydroxide was purchased from Qualigens Fine Chemicals Limited. Acetone was purchased from Merck Specialities Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. All the chemicals used in this study were of analytical reagent grade."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Co-precipitation method was used to prepare the catalysts. Initially a solution comprising copper nitrate and aluminum nitrate in 100 ml distilled water was prepared. The salt solution was added dropwise to aqueous solution of sodium carbonate at 65 °C. This was followed by dropwise addition of sodium hydroxide for maintaining pH of around 10. The final mixture was kept under stirring for 1 h at 65 °C. After stirring, the sample was aged at room temperature for 2 h. The ageing process was followed by filtration. The slurry obtained was washed with hot distilled water several times to remove sodium. The slurry was dried at 100 °C overnight. After drying, the solid mass was crushed and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. The samples of four different Cu:Al atomic ratios (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) were prepared and labeled as CuAl0.25, CuAl0.5, CuAl0.75 and CuAl1.0."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystalline phases present in the catalysts were identified by analyzing Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained with a diffractometer (Model: PW-3050/60 PAN Analytical). CuK α radiation was used at 30 mA and 40 kV with 100 to 800 scanning angle. The peaks obtained were compared with standard patterns presented in Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files-1996. The FESEM images were taken at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV by using JEOL instrument (Model: JSM-7610 F). The compositional analysis was done with EDS at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV by using Oxford instrument (Model: 51/XNX1146). All the samples were subjected to platinum coating in a vacuum sputter coater before scanning. Nitrogen physisorption technique was performed in a Quantachrome AUTOSORB 1 instrument to determine average pore diameter, pore volume and surface area. The specific surface area was calculated from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was applied to determine average pore diameter. The analysis was done at −196 °C on 200 mg of sample. Before analysis, the sample was degassed for 2 h under high vacuum at 200 °C. H2-TPR (Temperature programmed reduction) was conducted on a Quantachrome instrument (Model no. CHEMBET 3000) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Initially, 15 mg of sample was loaded in a quartz tube and degassed at 250 °C under nitrogen flow. In the next step, the temperature was increased at a rate of 10°/min from 30 °C to 1000 °C, in a flow of 5% H2/95%N2 (80 ml/min) and the TCD signal was recorded simultaneously. The FT-IR spectra of various samples were obtained with PerkinElmer (Model-Spectrum 100) instrument. For FTIR analysis, very thin disks comprising sample and KBr have been used in the medium IR region (4000–450 cm−1). Temperature programmed desorptions (TPD) of NH3 and CO2 were performed to determine the acidic and basic sites. The analysis was done with the same instrument (Quantachrome instrument, Model no. CHEMBET 3000) as used for H2-TPR analysis. In a quartz tube, the samples (8 mg) were loaded, degassed at 250 °C under He flow and cooled to room temperature. The ammonia (20% NH3 in He) and carbon dioxide was adsorbed at room temperature for 20 min. The NH3/CO2 desorption was observed by increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 900 °C, in a flow of He (80 ml/min) while the TCD signal was recorded."
5,Catalyst activity test,"2.4 Catalyst activity test Acetone hydrogenation in vapor phase was conducted in a packed bed reactor. Fig. 1 displays the schematic of the set-up for hydrogenation experiments. The set-up had been purchased from Texol Engg. Pvt. Ltd. (Pune, India). It consists of a pre-heater for vaporizing acetone and a reactor-furnace assembly in the upstream section and the downstream section comprises a condenser and a gas liquid separator. The reactor (10 mm ID) is heated electrically. Firstly, the reactor was loaded with the catalyst (1 g) at the center and inert packing materials at the top and bottom regions. After loading, the temperature was increased till 350 °C (reduction temperature) under nitrogen flow (40 ml/min). After reduction for 1 h in the presence of pure hydrogen (50 ml/min), reaction was started. The product stream after reaction was condensed and separated. The liquid product was obtained from the bottom and analyzed by SOLGEL wax capillary column in Gas Chromatograph equipped with FID. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The column temperature was programmed from 40 °C to 120 °C in the following way: 40 o C ( 0 .5 min ) ⟶ 10 o C/min ramp 80 o C ( 2 min ) ⟶ 40 o C/min ramp 120 o C ( 10 min ) The acetone conversion and IPA selectivity were calculated as follows: (5) C o n v e r s i o n o f a c e t o n e ( % ) = F C 3 H 6 O, in - F C 3 H 6 O, out F C 3 H 6 O, in × 100 , Where, F C 3 H 6 O,in = moles of acetone entering per min F C 3 H 6 O, out = moles of acetone leaving per min (6) IPA Selectivity ( % ) = IPA ( moles ) IPA ( moles ) + MIBK ( moles ) × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of calcined catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 a. The crystalline phases obtained are confirmed by standard JCPDS files. The phases detected in all the calcined samples are Cu (I) oxide (Cu2O) and Cu (II) oxide (CuO). The Cu (I) oxide phase belongs to the cubic crystal system and shows reflection at 29.58° (JCPDS 782076). The Cu (II) oxide phase belongs to the monoclinic crystal system and shows reflections at 35.46° (0 0 2) (JCPDS 89–2529), 38.66° (1 1 1) (JCPDS 89–2529), 48.70° (2 0 2) (JCPDS 89–2530), 58.33° (2 0 2) (JCPDS 89–5899), 61.40° (1 1 3) (JCPDS 89–2530), 66.07° (3 1 1) (JCPDS 89–2530) and 67.97° (1 1 3) (JCPDS 89–2530). As the calcination temperature is 400 °C, the formation of Al2O3 or well defined Cu-Al mixed metal oxide phases is of least possibility [23,24]. Due to low calcination temperature, the aluminium species and Cu-Al mixed oxide species are likely to be present in amorphous form. In Figure 2b, a comparison has been made for the phases present in CuAl0.5 at different conditions. Before calcination, the different phases present are copper hydroxide nitrate (29.45° (0 2 0), 44.60° (1 2 2), JCPDS 81–1697), copper aluminum carbonate hydroxide hydrate (35.67° (2 1 1), JCPDS 46-0099), aluminum hydroxide (Gibbsite) (38.40° (1 2 1), JCPDS 76–1782) and copper hydroxide carbonate (Malachite) (53.01° (2 5 1), JCPDS 75–1163 and 48.18° (3 4 1), JCPDS 76-0660). All the phases decomposed during calcination. After reaction, the spent catalyst consists of only reduced copper phase (43.31° (1 1 1), 50.44° (2 0 0), 74.12° (2 2 0), JCPDS 89–2838). The reduction temperature (350 °C) was high enough for complete reduction of CuO to Cu phase [25]. The FESEM images of calcined samples were obtained in order to determine surface morphologies. The images are shown in Fig. 3 (a, b, c & d). The images were taken at a magnification of 40,000 and a resolution of 100 nm. The sheet like morphology is clearly visible in the picture. The agglomeration increases as the copper content increases. The EDS result in Table 1 shows that the actual atomic ratio of copper and aluminum of different sample is close to the targeted ratio. The average pore diameter, pore volume and surface area of the calcined samples are given in Table 2 . It is found that when the copper loading increases the surface area decreases. The sample CuAl0.25 has the highest surface area. At higher copper loading, dispersion is less. Therefore, the surface area of the samples decreased. All the prepared samples have mesoporous texture having porosity in the range 6–9 nm. The porosity range for mesoporous materials is 2–50 nm, as per International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The presence of mesoporosity is also reported by Alejandre et al. [23]. They have studied the preparation of Cu-Al mixed oxides using co-precipitation method and obtained porosity values in the range 10–25 nm. The average pore diameter is sufficient for the reactants and products to pass through. H2-TPR analysis was carried out to determine the presence of reducible species. As can be observed in Table 3 , the hydrogen consumption increased with copper loading. Fig. 4 displays the TPR profiles. The reduction peak for all catalysts except the one having highest copper loading appeared in the temperature range of 550–600 °C. The catalyst having highest copper loading gave reduction peak at 500 °C. The peak shift happened due to decrease in aluminium content. There is strong interaction between copper and aluminium species. The strong interaction might be the cause for high reduction temperature when aluminium content is high. The peak at around 200 °C corresponds to the reduction of CuO species [26]. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectra of the calcined samples. A broad peak at 3500 cm−1 has appeared. It can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of absorbed water. The band at about 600 cm-1 corresponds to Cu-O stretching [27] whereas the bands at 800 cm−1 and 1300 cm−1 indicate the presence of residual carbonate anions [23,28]. The NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 6 . A single desorption peak has been obtained for all the samples. The quantity of ammonia desorbed is shown in Table 4 . There is a shift in the peak for high copper loadings. The incorporation of CuO phase enhances the Lewis acidity resulting into peak shift. Highest acidity was obtained for CuAl0.25. The acidity reduced when the Cu:Al atomic ratio increased to 0.5. The acidity dropped probably due to the reduction in aluminium content. There is an increase in acidity for further higher loading; 22.5 mmol NH3/g cat. for CuAl0.75. This might have happened due to increase in CuO phase. In order to evaluate the presence of basic sites, CO2-TPD was conducted. The CO2-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 7 . A quantitative estimation of carbon dioxide desorbed is presented in Table 5 . There is a broad desorption peak in the temperature region of 400–750 °C for all samples. The basicity of the catalyst increased a bit with copper content. The desorption peak shifted slightly as the copper content increased. The presence of acidic and basic properties in Cu/Al2O3 was also reported in the literature [29]."
8,Effect of catalyst composition,"3.2 Effect of catalyst composition The effects of Cu:Al atomic ratio on conversion of acetone and IPA selectivity were studied at 175 °C. The conversion of acetone was found to increase with increase in concentration of Cu in the catalyst (Fig. 8 ). A maximum conversion of 25% was achieved with sample having Cu/Al atomic ratio of unity. This is due to the fact that as the metal content increases, the hydrogenation activity also increases. In case of IPA selectivity (Fig. 9 ), the catalysts did not follow the same trend. CuAl0.5 showed highest selectivity (98%). The high metal loading and presence of acidic as well as basic sites favors the formation of MIBK through mesityl oxide. Also, the hydrogenation of CC double bond is thermodynamically favored over CO double bond. Therefore, at high metal content, the IPA selectivity decreases. As the highest selectivity for IPA was displayed by CuAl0.5 catalyst, it was chosen for further study."
9,Effect of temperature,"3.3 Effect of temperature The influence of temperature was investigated by conducting the experiments at 150, 175, 200 and 225 °C, respectively. The conversion of acetone increases with temperature as shown in Fig. 10 . The selectivity of IPA, however, increases first, attains a maximum at 175 °C and then decreases sharply with temperature (Fig. 10). The dehydration of acetone condensation product (diacetone alcohol) to mesityl oxide is an endothermic reaction. Therefore, a rise in temperature favors MIBK formation. Similar kind of behavior was observed in another work using Cu-on-MgO catalyst as reported by Chikan et al. [30]. They observed that formation of MIBK increases with temperature and at low temperature direct hydrogenation to IPA dominates. This causes the conversion to increase with temperature at the cost of IPA selectivity. At low temperature, the activity of the catalyst is low; so, conversion and selectivity are less. The IPA selectivity was found to increase with time (Fig. 11 ). The deactivation of acidic and basic sites of catalyst with time causing less MIBK production is responsible for this behavior. For more corroboration of this hypothesis, one experiment was conducted without catalyst at 175 °C. Though the conversion was very less (6%), IPA was obtained as the only product of the reaction. This proves that the presence of basic and acidic sites in the catalyst promotes the other reactions leading to MIBK. As highest selectivity for IPA was obtained at 175 °C, this was considered as the optimum temperature."
10,Effect of feed composition,"3.4 Effect of feed composition The effect of feed composition was studied by varying hydrogen to acetone molar ratio at 175 °C. The results are presented in Fig. 12 . The conversion of acetone increased with mole ratio. However, the selectivity of IPA was observed to decrease at hydrogen to acetone mole ratios >1. Due to the presence of multifunctional sites, there always exists a competition between direct hydrogenation and mesityl oxide formation (and hydrogenation). At higher H2/acetone mole ratios, the acetone partial pressure becomes low. At low acetone partial pressure, the metallic sites cannot counter the activity of basic and acidic sites which induce condensation and dehydration reactions leading to the formation of mesityl oxide. Again, as the reduction of CC double bond is easier than that of CO double bond, hydrogenation at higher hydrogen concentration produces more MIBK than IPA. A similar behavior has been reported by Rodrigues and Monteiro [31]. As highest IPA selectivity was obtained at the mole ratio of 1, this was considered as the optimum mole ratio for the present catalyst."
11,Effect of space-velocity,"3.5 Effect of space-velocity The effect of space-velocity was studied at 150 °C, 175 °C and 200 °C with hydrogen to acetone molar ratio of unity. The results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14 . The conversion decreases with space-velocity as expected. The selectivity of IPA increases with space-velocity. The trend is same for all temperatures. This indicates that the rate of direct hydrogenation of acetone to IPA is enhanced with space-velocity. This also corroborates the observation from the run without any catalyst in the reactor. At low space-velocity, other reactions are more likely to occur that lead to the formation of MIBK."
12,Kinetic modelling,"3.6 Kinetic modelling For development of suitable kinetic model, experiments were conducted under conditions free from any diffusional limitations, at three temperatures namely, 150, 175 and 200 °C, keeping hydrogen to acetone molar ratio constant at unity. The space-velocity was varied from 0.09 to 0.145 kmol acetone/ kg cat. h. The kinetic data obtained are presented in Tables 6–8 . The kinetic data were used in developing Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (L-H-H-W) type model. To estimate the unknown parameters, nonlinear regression based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used in the POLYMATH software. The objective function was minimized by using the following equation: (7) F = ∑ i = 1 N r ca l i - r ex p i 2 where, rcali = Calculated rate, rexpi = Experimental rate. For establishing L-H-H-W model, the following mechanism was proposed with dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and competitive adsorption of hydrogen and acetone [5,9]: 1 . H 2 + 2S ⇄ - k 1 k 1 2H .S 2 . A + S ⇄ - k 2 k 2 A .S ( A : A c e t o n e ) 3 . A .S + H .S ⇄ - k 3 k 3 AH .S + S 4 . AH .S + H .S ⟶ k 4 B .S + S ( Rate-determining step ) 5 . B .S + S ⇄ - k 5 k 5 B + 2S ( B : Isopropyl alcohol ) Initially, rate equations were derived considering each elementary step one by one as rate-determining step. As the conversion of acetone is low, the partial pressure of product has been neglected. The final forms of rate equations are presented below. Model 1: Dissociative adsorption of H2 is rate controlling (8) − r 1 = k P H 2 1 + K 2 P A 2 Model 2: Adsorption of acetone is rate controlling (9) − r 2 = k P A 1 + K 1 P H 2 Model 3: First surface reaction is rate controlling (10) − r 3 = ( k K 2 P A K 1 P H 2 ( 1 + K 2 P A + K 1 P H 2 ) 2 Model 4: Second surface reaction is rate controlling (11) − r 4 = k K 1 K 2 K 3 P A P H 2 ( 1 + K 2 P A + K 1 P H 2 + K 2 K 3 P A K 1 P H 2 ) 2 Model 5: Desorption of IPA is rate controlling (12) − r 5 = k K 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 P A P H 2 1 + K 2 P A + K 1 P H 2 + K 2 K 3 P A K 1 P H 2 + K 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 P A P H 2 The experimental kinetic data fit rate Eq. (11) satisfactorily. Therefore, second surface reaction was found to be the rate-determining step. The evaluated rate constant, k and equilibrium constants (K 1, K 2 and K 3) are presented in Table 9 . It can be observed that the rate constant increases with temperature and the equilibrium constants decrease with temperature as expected. From Arrhenius plot (Fig. 15 ), activation energy and frequency factor were calculated to be 44.3 kJ/mol and 40134.83 kmol/kg cat. h. Sen et al. [9] obtained around 60 kJ/mol of activation energy over platinum based catalysts at 30 °C and atmospheric pressure."
13,Conclusions,"The developed CuAl mixed oxide catalysts showed good activity for hydrogenation of acetone in vapor phase. The experimental runs were conducted by varying parameters such as temperature, H2/Acetone molar ratio and space-velocity. It was observed that the presence of metallic, basic and acidic sites on the catalyst play a significant role in determining the product selectivity. Due to the presence of basic and acidic sites, acetone condensation and dehydration also take place apart from direct hydrogenation catalyzed by metal sites. The condensation product is further dehydrated and hydrogenated to MIBK. As the dehydration reaction is endothermic, high temperature favored the selectivity of MIBK. The optimum temperature at which highest selectivity of IPA obtained was 175 °C. The catalyst showed maximum selectivity for IPA at H2/Acetone mole ratio of unity. Beyond this mole ratio the IPA selectivity declined. The study of variation in space-velocity suggested that a high space-velocity favors IPA selectivity. The best activity was obtained over CuAl0.5. The kinetic study was conducted with the best catalyst. The rate equations based on LHHW kinetic models were validated. The activation energy was estimated to be 44.3 kJ/mol."
