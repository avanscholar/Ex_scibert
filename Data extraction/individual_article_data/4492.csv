0,Introduction,"Several techniques have been developed to produce hydrogen (H2) from steam by water splitting, based on photochemical, electrochemical or thermochemical routes (Ding and Wang, 2011). In recent years, the focus has been on two-step thermochemical water splitting because of several advantages associated with the method, such as zero greenhouse gas emission and a relatively low operating temperature. The method also obviates the requirement of separating H2 from the gaseous mixture of H2 and O2 (Wegner et al., 2006). Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the two-step ZnO/Zn water splitting thermochemical cycle. The cycle comprises the endothermic solar thermal dissociation of the metal oxide to metal or a lower-valence metal oxide and the exothermic non-solar hydrolysis of the metal at moderate temperatures, leading to the formation of H2 along with the corresponding metal oxide. Although a number of transition metals, such as Mn, Fe, Ni, and Co, have been used to carry out the hydrolysis reaction, Zn is of special interest because of its potential to achieve a relatively higher conversion rate. The hydrolysis reaction step has been studied using various forms of Zn, such as liquid, vapor, nanoparticles, nanocrystals, and the solar form. Among the several salient studies performed on H2-production using the ZnO/Zn water splitting cycle, Berman and Epstein (2000) studied the kinetics of the oxidation reaction using liquid Zn at 450–500°C in a quartz reactor. The experimental data showed that the specific reaction rate increased with the increasing partial pressure of the water vapor. The order of the reaction with respect to the water vapor partial pressure ranged between 0 and 1. Abu Hamed et al. (2009) studied the kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction using Zn in vapor form in a tubular reactor equipped with a quench device. The performance of the quench device was assessed using computational fluid dynamics models. The experimental data showed that the H2 conversion was as high as 80% at temperatures above 650K. Using a similar reactor and Zn in the vapor form, Melchior et al. (2009) studied the effect of quenching rates on H2 production. A quenching rate of the order of 104 K/s yielded H2 conversion up to 95%, whereas at higher quenching rates the conversion decreased to 66%. Weiss et al. (2005) used a hot-wall tubular reactor featuring Zn evaporation, mixing, and reaction zones. The process included the formation of Zn nanoparticles (∼70nm) by steam quenching followed by in situ hydrolysis. The maximum H2 conversion was 37% and 72% at 923K and 1023K, respectively. Wegner et al. (2006) performed the reaction in a reactor with a similar configuration and achieved approximately the same level of conversion as that in the study of Weiss et al. (2005). However, Wegner et al. proposed two different hydrolysis reactions, one below and the other above the Zn-saturation temperature. Ernst et al. (2006) performed the synthesis of H2 in a hot-wall tubular quartz reactor operating at 1bar and 573–1273K. The process yielded up to 90% H2 conversion with 40nm average ZnO crystallite particles. The authors concluded that the constancy observed in the average crystallite size of the ZnO nanoparticles indicated that the nanoparticles were formed primarily by the surface hydrolysis reaction. In a similar study, Funke et al. (2008) reported an H2 conversion of 27% at temperatures between 653K and 813K, possibly because of the relatively large size (∼158nm) of Zn nanoparticles used in the hydrolysis reaction. Ma and Zachariah (2010) studied the substrate-free hydrolysis reaction using Zn nanocrystals of 70nm average size. A low-temperature reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the mass-change behavior of the Zn nanocrystal during hydrolysis at 100–250°C. The complete conversion of Zn nanocrystals was achieved at 175°C with a 19% water vapor mole fraction. The production of H2 from solar Zn in a steam atmosphere was studied by Vishnevetsky and Epstein (2007) and Melchior et al. (2009). The test results of the batch experiments conducted by Vishnevetsky and Epstein (2007) indicated the possibility of relatively faster and higher conversion of Zn powders to ZnO and H2 without intermediate melting or evaporation of Zn. H2 yield varied between 24 and 81% in the temperature range of 185–560°C. Similarly, Melchior et al. (2009) performed the reaction with Zn solar nanopowder (average crystal size of 26nm) in a fixed bed reactor. The maximum H2 yield was 55% in the temperature range of 748–800K. The present study focuses on the development of a unique Zn nanoparticle (∼25nm)-dispersed multi-scale web of carbon micro-nanofibers for the hydrogen production step of the ZnO/Zn water splitting thermochemical cycle. In this method of preparing the multi-scale structure, Zn has a dual role, as a catalyst for carbon nanofiber (CNF) growth on the carbon microfiber (ACF) substrate by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) and as a reactant in the hydrolysis reaction. The reactions are performed under different gas flow rates, steam flow rates, and reaction temperatures in a specially designed perforated tubular reactor wrapped with Zn-ACF/CNF. In our recent study (Bhaduri et al., 2012), a similar reactor assembly was used to perform Cu–Cl thermochemical reactions, without channeling and the misdistribution of the gas flow, which are generally prevalent in fixed and fluidized bed reactors of powdery materials."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The phenolic precursor-based ACF, the substrate material of this study, was procured from Nippon Kynol Inc., Japan. The LR grade zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] (purity >99%), and GR grade sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (purity >99%) were supplied by Merck, Germany. Hydrogen (purity >99.99%), nitrogen (purity >99.99%), and C2H2 (AAS grade) were procured from Sigma Gases, India."
3,Pretreatment of ACF,"2.2 Pretreatment of ACF The ACFs were pretreated with a 0.05M aqueous solution of HNO3 for 2h at 80°C to remove any volatile impurities and foreign particulate matter. After pretreating with the acid, the ACFs were washed several times with DI water. The washed ACFs were dried, first in still air for 2h and then in the oven at 120°C for 12h. Approximately 1g of the oven-dried sample was wrapped over the perforated portion of the quartz tubular reactor (ID=0.635cm, and L =8cm) and placed in the vacuum oven for 12h to remove any trapped gases in the ACFs. The samples were cooled to room temperature (∼30°C)."
4,Preparation of the Zn nanoparticle-dispersed ACF,"2.3 Preparation of the Zn nanoparticle-dispersed ACF A solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O crystals dispersed in DI water was used to produce the Zn nanoparticles in the ACFs. The pretreated ACFs were impregnated with the aqueous solution of the Zn salt by the wet incipience method. A 0.4M salt solution with 0.3% (w/w) SDS surfactant was stirred until a homogeneous mixture was produced. The solution was cycled for 6h through the ACF wrapped over the perforated tubular reactor, using a peristaltic pump at a rotor speed of 100rpm. To determine the optimum salt concentration (0.4M), various ACF samples impregnated with aqueous solutions of different concentrations (0.1–0.6M) were prepared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (discussed later in the manuscript) showed relatively uniform dispersion and a high metal loading in the ACFs that were prepared using the 0.4M salt solution. Concentrations higher than 0.4M resulted in a blockage of the pores in the ACFs, rendering the internal surface area inaccessible to the solutes in the bulk phase. The concentration of the SDS surfactant in the impregnating solution was optimized at 0.3% (w/w) for the maximum transfer of salts without agglomeration from the bulk aqueous phase to the ACF surfaces. After impregnation, the wet samples were dried for 6h in still air and for 12h in the vacuum oven at 120°C to remove the unbound moisture. Zn nanoparticles were produced in situ on the ACF by calcination of the impregnated samples for 4h at 500°C in an N2 atmosphere, followed by a reduction by H2 for 6h at 400°C in a programmable, electric horizontal stainless steel (SS) tubular reactor (ID=30mm, L =0.8m). The sample was placed on a SS mesh inside of the reactor. The flow rate of N2 during the calcination step and that of H2 during the reduction step were maintained constant at 100 standard cc per min (sccm) and 120sccm, respectively. The calcination and reduction temperatures were selected based on the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles (discussed later in the manuscript)."
5,The preparation of Zn-CNF,"2.4 The preparation of Zn-CNF The Zn nanoparticle-dispersed ACFs (Zn-ACFs) are the starting materials for the CNF growth. The CNFs were grown on Zn-ACF by CCVD using acetylene (C2H2) as the carbon source. CCVD was performed at 700°C for 60min in the same reactor assembly as that used for calcinations and reduction. The acetylene flow rate was set at 150sccm during CVD. Fig. 2 schematically describes the various steps of preparing Zn-CNFs and the reaction step involving steam to produce H2. As also described in the figure, growth of the CNFs occurs by the tip-growth mechanism. The SEM images (described later in the manuscript) corroborated the growth of nanofibers on Zn-ACFs, with shiny metal particles observed at the tip of the fiber. The CNF growth comprised three steps: (1) decomposition of C2H2 into C and H2 at active sites of the Zn-metal catalyst, (2) diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal catalyst, and (3) precipitation and crystallization of carbon to grow the CNFs."
6,Hydrogen production by hydrolysis,"2.5 Hydrogen production by hydrolysis Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the experimental arrangement used for the hydrolysis reaction in the production of H2 from steam. As described, the setup consists of a specially designed SS tubular reactor (L =140mm, I.D.=14mm) mounted inside the specially designed vertical furnace. The reactor consists of a perforated SS tube (L =50mm, ID=4mm), closed at the bottom. The Zn-CNF sample was wrapped over the perforated (perforation diameter=0.5mm) portion of the tube and the reactor was continuously purged with N2 gas to prevent the oxidation of the Zn-CNFs. The flow rates of N2 gas was set at 30sccm, using a mass flow controller (model PSFIC-1, Bronkhorst, Netherlands). The gas flowed down inside the perforated tubular reactor and radially outward through the test sample, before exiting into the SS shell. The temperature of the furnace was controlled using a PID controller (model PXZ-4, Fuji Electric Co., Japan). In a typical hydrolysis study, 1g of test sample was used. In the preheating step, the temperature of the reactor was increased linearly, at 5° per min, to 250°C. At this stage, Zn nanoparticles were in the molten state [Ding and Wang, 2011]. The reactor temperature was held at 250°C for 30min and then increased to different temperatures ranging between 400 and 600°C to perform the hydrolysis. During the activity (hydrolysis reaction) test, steam was fed continuously at 0.1mol/min into the reactor. The reaction proceeded for approximately 2h. The gaseous product containing N2, H2 and unconverted steam was sent to the water-chilled condenser for cooling. The condensate was returned to the SS container. H2 was detected by gas chromatography (Nucon, Delhi, Model no. 5700) operated in the thermal conductivity detection (TCD) mode. Some hydrolysis reactions for the production of H2 were also performed on the ACF substrate and the Zn-ACF (post-reduction step) for comparisons."
7,Surface characterization,"The prepared materials were characterized by several spectroscopic and analytical techniques, i.e., atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area and pore size distribution (PSD) measurement using the BET method, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The BET surface area, pore volume, PSD and adsorption and desorption isotherm of the materials were measured at 77.3K using the Autosorb-1C instrument (Model: AS1-C, Quantachrome, USA). Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed at 200°C for 8h in a vacuum. The total pore volume was estimated depending upon the amount of N2 adsorbed at a relative pressure near unity (0.9994). In a typical test run, 30–40mg of the sample were put in the BET cell during the analysis and 30% N2–He gas mixture was used as a physisorption probe. X-ray diffraction patterns of the powder samples were recorded in the range of 20–70° with a scanning range of 3° per min on a Seifert X-ray generator (ISO Debye flex 2002, Germany) using Cu Kα (K =1.54178Å) radiation. The average crystallite size was estimated using the X’Pert High Score Plus software available with the equipment. The TPR analysis of the prepared samples was performed to determine the reducibility of the material, using the Quantachrome instrument. TPR was performed in a U-shaped quartz tube using 5% (v/v) H2 in N2. Approximately 0.15g of the test sample was degassed at 120°C for 1h prior to the analysis, in a He flow to remove the surface moisture and volatile impurities. Then, 5% H2 in N2 was introduced at 10ml/min for 30min in the reactor at ∼40°C. The sample temperature was continuously raised from 40°C to 550°C at 10°C/min. The sample temperature was measured using a PID controller. During the analysis, the initial TCD current was set at 150mA, and the signal was set at 0mV. The amount of hydrogen consumption was recorded by the TCD controller. A Tensor 27 (Bruker, Germany) FT-IR was used to ascertain the surface functional groups present in the prepared materials and solid products of hydrolysis. The measurements were recorded within the wave number range of 600–3600cm−1 in the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode using a Zinc selenide detector. The spectra and automatic data acquisition were performed using the standard opus software. Before the sample analysis, the sample chamber was continuously purged with N2 to minimize the effect of atmospheric moisture and CO2. The resolution was set at 4cm−1, and a total of 20 scans were recorded for each sample. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was performed using a Varian AA240 (Varian, Germany) and an air acetylene flame. Field emission SEM (Supra 40 VP, Zeiss, Germany) was used to view the surface texture of the prepared material. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed on the prepared material using OXFORD INCAX-sight to determine the elemental composition."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Zn(II) loading on the Zn-ACF,"4.1 Zn(II) loading on the Zn-ACF Samples of impregnating solutions of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O salts and SDS were collected for the AAS analysis, before and after impregnation. The samples were tightly sealed in glass bottles to avoid contamination. Prior to the analysis, calibration was performed using the standards supplied by Varian. Table 1 shows the Zn loading on the impregnated ACF with and without surfactant. The results in the table show that the addition of SDS to the impregnating solution improved the metal loading by approximately two-fold. The amount of Zn(II) incorporated into the ACFs increased with increasing SDS concentration up to 0.3% (w/w). An increase in the SDS concentration above 0.3% resulted in a decrease in metal loading in the ACFs. Fig. 2 shows the role of the SDS in preparing the uniformly dispersed Zn nanoparticles on the ACFs. During a typical impregnation step, the negatively charged hydrophilic section of the SDS binds to the Zn(II) ions produced by the dissolution of Zn(NO3)2 in the impregnating solution. SDS prevents the agglomeration of Zn(II) ions, resulting in the monodispersion of Zn(NO3)2, and facilitates the transfer of a relatively large number of Zn(II) ions from the bulk solution to the ACFs. During the calcination step, the SDS decomposes, leaving behind the monodispersed ZnO nanoparticles in the ACF. The ZnO nanoparticles are reduced to the monodispersed Zn nanoparticles in a reduction step in the presence of H2. An excess concentration of the precursor salt or surfactant results in the blockage of the ACF pores from the agglomeration of the crystals and the subsequent formation of large particles."
10,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"4.2 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The TPR analysis was performed to determine the required calcinations and reduction temperatures of the test samples for converting Zn nitrates into ZnO and the produced ZnO to Zn, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of the Zn (NO3)2-dispersed ACF samples calcined for 4h at different temperatures. The results show the major reduction peaks at 410°C, and 310°C for the samples calcined at 200°C and 300°C, respectively. The peaks were also observed at around 380°C for the samples calcined at 400°C and 500°C. The shift in the reduction temperature for all the samples was within the experimental error. The results show that the sample calcined at 200°C did not exhibit any significant reduction peak, indicating thermal stability of the material under the experimental conditions. When the calcination temperature is increased, the intensity of the reduction peak also increases, suggesting the rapid dissociation of nitrate salts into the corresponding metal oxide and a relatively larger extent of reduction. The intensity of the reduction peak also reaches a maximum level at a calcination temperature of 500°C. Based on the TPR profiles, the optimum calcination and reduction temperatures for the Zn-nitrate-impregnated samples were selected as 500°C and 400°C, respectively. The TPR data for ZnO obtained in this study were in agreement with the literature data (Tseng et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2009)."
11,BET measurements,"4.3 BET measurements An N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm study was performed to determine the BET surface area and PSD of the materials at different stages of preparation. Fig. 5 shows the resulting isotherms. As the results in the figure show, the amount of adsorbed N2 for the Zn-ACF samples (a–c) increase rapidly as the normalized pressure (P/P o) increases until (P/P o)=∼0.1. Then, the amount of adsorbed N2 increases more gradually before leveling off to a nearly constant value, confirming that the samples were in equilibrium with N2. These isotherms are categorized as Type I. For Zn-CNF and the hydrolyzed reaction product sample, a sharp increase in the amount of adsorbed N2 is seen near the relative pressure close to unity, suggesting the formation of narrow pores or ultramicro porosity in the materials (Rodrıguez-Reinoso et al., 2000). Tests using the Zn-CNF and the solid hydrolysis product resulted in similar types of isotherms, confirming that no structural collapse of the material occurred during hydrolysis. The surface area of the material was calculated using the multipoint BET method in the normalized pressure range of 0.05–0.35. The total pore volume was calculated by considering the amount of N2 adsorbed at a normalized pressure close to unity (∼0.994). The meso-pore volume and the micro-pore volume were calculated using the Barrete–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and the density functional theory (DFT), respectively. Table 2 summarizes the BET surface area (S BET), total pore volume and PSD of the materials. It may be observed that the BET surface area and pore volume considerably decrease upon impregnation with metal salt. The surface area, however, increases during the calcination step, following the decomposition of Zn-nitrate into its oxide. The area further increases during the reduction of ZnO to the metallic state. However, the growth of CNF on the Zn-ACF resulted in a decrease in the BET surface area because of the formation of narrower pores. The calculated BET area (∼626m2/g) of the Zn-CNF may be underestimated by ∼40% because the relatively narrower pores may not have been accessible to the probe N2 molecules during the physisorption analysis (Lozano-Castello et al., 2004; Bikshapathi et al., 2012a). The results also show that during the hydrolysis of Zn at 600°C, the specific surface area decreases because the formation of ZnO nanocrystals fills the pores (Babu et al., 2012)."
12,XRD data,"4.4 XRD data The XRD analysis of the various materials, including the ACF substrate and solid reaction product of hydrolysis was performed to ascertain different phases and the average crystallite size of ZnO nanoparticles. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding XRD patterns of the ACFs, Zn-ACFs, Zn-CNFs, and ZnO produced after hydrolysis in ACFs/CNFs. For ZnO, the patterns are shown for the hydrolysis reaction temperatures of 400°C and 600°C. As the results in the figure show, a broad diffraction peak exists at an approximate 2θ angle of ∼22° in all of the samples, attributed to the d002 plane, which is the characteristic of the disordered amorphous interlayer of coke-like substances present in the ACFs. For the ACF sample, a less intense common diffraction peak was observed at an approximate 2θ angle of 43°, corresponding to the d101 plane of hexagonal graphite (Zhao et al., 2009). For the Zn-ACF and Zn-CNF samples, two different characteristic peaks were observed at the 2θ angles of ∼36 and 55°, corresponding to the crystallographic indices of (002) and (102) reflection lines of pure Zn phases. Nine different characteristic peaks were observed for the solid reaction products of hydrolysis at the 2θ angles of approximately 31, 34, 36, 47, 56, 62, 66, 67, and 69 degrees, which corresponded to the crystallographic indices of the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), and (201) reflection lines of the hexagonal zincite (ZnO) particles, respectively (Lee and Park, 2004; Achour et al., 2007). The observed sharpness of the diffraction peaks indicated high crystallinity of the ZnO phase. No other characteristic peaks were observed, indicating the presence of high quality ZnO phases without sample impurities. The average crystal size of the nanoparticles was estimated using the Scherrer formula (r = kλ/β cos θ), where k is the shape factor (0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.154nm), β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM) in radians, and θ is the Bragg angle. The average crystal size of the Zn nanoparticles dispersed in the ACF was estimated to be 24nm. The crystal size of the hydrolysis product ZnO, corresponding to a reaction temperature of 400°C, was 31nm. The crystal size was even larger, i.e., 42nm, when the reaction temperature was increased to 600°C, possibly because of agglomeration resulting from the higher temperature."
13,Surface morphology,"4.5 Surface morphology SEM and EDX analyses were performed to ascertain the surface morphology and the elemental compositions of the prepared materials and reaction products. Fig. 7 shows representative SEM images of the as-received ACFs, Zn nanoparticle-dispersed ACFs and Zn-grown CNFs. For each sample, the images were recorded at small (5KX) and large (100KX) magnifications. Prior to SEM imaging, the samples were gold-coated to improve the thermal conductivity and to obtain better images. Fig. 7(a–b) shows the representative SEM images of the as-received ACFs at low and high magnifications. At low magnification, the external surfaces of the ACFs appear smooth. At high magnification, pores are seen on the external surfaces. Fig. 7(c–d) shows the SEM images of Zn-ACFs prepared at the reduction temperature of 400°C. Zn nanoparticles are visible on the external surface and inside the pores of the ACFs. The nanoparticles appear to be dispersed on the ACFs uniformly and homogeneously. Reduction temperatures higher than 450°C resulted in the formation of large particles that caused blockage of the pores (data not shown in the manuscript for brevity). As mentioned earlier, in the section on the TPR analysis, the reduction temperature was set at 400°C for the preparation of the Zn-ACF samples. Fig. 7(e–f) shows the dense and uniform growth of the CNFs on the ACFs. From the SEM images, the tip-growth mechanism for the nanofibers is corroborated because the shiny Zn nanoparticles are located at the tips of the fibers. The average thickness of Zn-CNFs was approximately 50nm. The SEM images also confirmed that the impregnation of the ACFs using the SDS surfactant resulted in significantly improved dispersion of Zn nanoparticles on the ACFs and larger and denser growth of CNFs than without the SDS (images not included for brevity). The EDX spectrum shown in the inset of Fig. 7(f) confirms the presence of Zn nanometals in the ACF. Fig. 8 describes the representative SEM images of the solid products of the hydrolysis reactions performed at 600°C on the Zn-ACFs and the Zn-CNFs. The images are shown at low and high magnifications. As observed from Fig. 8(a–b), ZnO nanoparticles are distributed on the ACFs. A distinct change in the morphology of the products formed by the hydrolysis of the Zn-CNFs may be observed from Fig. 8 (c–d). At high magnification, an interconnected filamentary structure is evident. The filament diameter ranges from 50 to 70nm. The EDX spectrum shown in the inset of Fig. 8(d) confirms the presence of Zn and oxygen because of the ZnO particles present as the hydrolysis product. Fig. 9 shows the elemental mapping of the hydrolysis products corresponding to the reactions performed at 400°C and 600°C. The red, blue, and green dots represent C, Zn2+, and O2− particles, respectively. The higher concentration (Fig. 9(b)) of elemental oxygen on the nanocrystal of Zn confirms the higher extent of hydrolysis reaction at 600°C in comparison to the reaction performed at 450°C (Fig. 9(a))."
14,FT-IR analysis,"4.6 FT-IR analysis Fig. 10 shows the FTIR spectra of the ACF, Zn-ACF and Zn-CNF samples. The figure also includes the FTIR spectrum of the Zn-CNF sample after the hydrolysis reaction (∼600°C). The peaks observed at 1645cm−1, 1555cm−1, and 1020cm−1 in all of the samples that were assigned to the CO stretch (carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups), the NO stretch (nitro group), and the CN stretch (nitrile group) These functional groups are inherently present in ACF (Bikshapathi et al., 2011). The observed NO stretching was created by leaching the ACF with nitric acid. In the Zn-ACF and the Zn-CNF samples, the peaks observed at ∼3600cm−1 and 1555cm−1 correspond to the OH stretch (alcohols, phenols) and the NH stretch (reduction of nitro groups), respectively. The intensity of the functional groups present in the Zn-ACF and Zn-CNF samples was higher compared to the intensity measured for the ACF sample. The H2 reduction of the calcined samples resulted in the decomposition/disappearance of the weak acid groups. Furthermore, reduction at high temperature replaced the NO stretch by the NH stretch. The peak observed at ∼650cm−1 in the Zn-CNF samples after the hydrolysis reaction is attributed to the stretching vibration of the ZnO nanoparticles formed during the reaction (Ravichandrika et al., 2012; Viswanatha et al., 2012)."
15,Hydrogen production study,"4.7 Hydrogen production study Figs. 11–14 show the experimental results of the tests performed on Zn-CNF samples for the production of H2 from steam via hydrolysis. The yield of H2 with respect to Zn may be determined as follows: H2 yield (%)=moles of H2,GC/moles of H2,max, where H2,GC is the H2 produced during the reaction as measured by gas chromatography, and H2,max refers to the theoretical amount of H2 produced assuming complete hydrolysis of Zn dispersed in the CNF. The total amount of H2 produced was calculated from the area under the H2 evolution curve. From the calculated number of moles of hydrogen produced, the average H2 production rate was determined based on the reaction time and the amount of the material. Fig. 11 shows the unsteady state H2 concentrations measured during the hydrolysis reaction using different materials (ACF, Zn-ACF and Zn-CNF). The reactions were performed at 600°C. The steam flow rate was constant at 0.1mol/min. The inset in Fig. 11 shows the corresponding yield calculated from the H2 evolution curves. As the results show, the H2 concentration obtained on the Zn-CNF decreases from its initial level of ∼84,000 to ∼3900ppm in 2h. The yield was larger for the Zn-CNF (∼80%) than for the Zn-ACF (∼46%). ACF (without metals) did not yield any H2. Thus, The ACF acts as a support to the Zn nanoparticles during the hydrolysis reaction. The superior performance of the Zn-CNF compared with the Zn-ACF during the hydrolysis reaction is consistent with the XRD data discussed in Section 4.4. The higher intensity of ZnO phases obtained during the reaction was similar to the higher extent of reaction obtained for Zn-ACF. The superior performance of CNF than the ACF substrate is discussed in the literature (Bikshapathi et al., 2012b; Gupta et al., 2010; Chakraborty et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2004). Briefly, CNF characterized by graphite like structure provides exposed edges of hexagons containing heteroatoms such as N and O, responsible for enhanced adsorptive/catalytic activities. The hierarchical structure of ACF/CNF has also increased mesoporosity than that of ACF, which is shown to be useful for adsorption applications. In addition, increased mechanical strength of ACF/CNF makes the material suitable for packing in a tubular reactor to be used in an end-application (Rahmanian et al., 2013; Bitter, 2006). Fig. 12 shows the effect of reaction temperatures on the amount of H2 produced on Zn-CNF. All other operating conditions remain unchanged. The results show that the amount of H2 produced increases with increasing temperature between 400°C and 600°C. The inset in Fig. 12 describes H2 yield at different reaction temperatures, calculated from the corresponding H2 evolution curves. The H2 yield is ∼42% at 400°C. The yield increases significantly to ∼70%, as the reaction temperature is increased to 500°C. Thereafter, increase in the yield is small, e.g., ∼80% yield is obtained at 600°C. Table 3 provides the comparison of H2 yield obtained in our study with the data described in the literature. As observed, the H2 yield obtained in the study is larger than or in the similar range as those described in the literature. Fig. 13 shows the effect of reaction temperatures on H2 production rates. It was assumed that the reaction rate for Zn-CNF hydrolysis followed the Arrhenius law. The results showed that the apparent reaction rate increased with increasing reaction temperatures. At 400°C, the reaction rate was calculated to be 9.48×10−7 mol/gs, which increased to 1.66×10−6 mol/gs at 600°C. The inset in Fig. 13 shows the plot of lnk vs. 1/T. From the slope of the line, the activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction was calculated to be ∼40kJ/mol. The regression coefficient and the standard deviation were calculated to be 0.947 and 0.20, respectively. The activation energy calculated in this study is in the same range as those obtained by Berman and Epstein (2000), Ernst et al. (2009), Bazan et al. (1999), and Ma and Zachariah (2010). The hydrolysis reaction carried out by Funke et al. (2008) on sub-micron Zn yielded the activation energy of 132kJ/mol, which is relatively larger and is attributed to initial oxide content and morphology of the reacting particles (Chambon et al., 2009). The produced materials were also tested at different steam flow rates. Fig. 14 shows the effect of flow rates (0.05, 0.08, and 0.1mol/min) on the production of H2, keeping the other conditions unchanged. As observed, H2 yield expectedly increased with increasing steam flow rates because of increase in the partial pressure of steam, responsible for high reaction rates. The area under the H2 evolution curve was used to calculate the total amount of H2 produced, the reaction rate and yield of H2. From the data, the order of the reaction was calculated to be ∼1.2 with respect to the partial pressure of steam. The order of the reaction obtained in the present study is in good agreement with the data described in the literature. Berman and Epstein (2000) observed that the order of the reaction with respect to the water vapor partial pressure ranged from 0 to 1 for liquid Zn. Ma and Zachariah (2010) obtained the order of reaction with respect to water vapor mole fraction to be 0.9±0.1 on Zn nanocrystals. The interaction between metallic Zn and water vapor yielded the order of reaction of 0.8 (Bazan et al., 1999). Similarly, Funke et al. (2008) observed the order of the reaction to be 0.5. We previously mentioned in the text that Zn has been used in several forms, including nanoparticles, aerosols, molten state, and powder (∼submicron size) for the hydrolysis reaction. Table 3 presents a comparison between data of the average H2 production rate and the H2 yield using the Zn-CNF produced in this study and data found in the literature. The results in the table show that the H2 production rate and the H2 yield obtained in this study are higher than most of the data discussed in the literature and is comparable to a few. Although highly reactive, these micro-nanomaterials are inherently disadvantageous to use directly in a flow reactor because of the possible risk of entrainment in the flow of the reaction mixture. Furthermore, misdistribution and flow channeling are commonly prevalent in packed beds of micron or sub-micron particles. The method of in situ producing and dispersing Zn nanoparticles in the ACF/CNF support obviates these disadvantages and yields relatively larger H2 yield and production rate in the hydrolysis step of the ZnO/Zn water splitting thermochemical cycle."
16,Conclusions,"An in situ dispersion of Zn nanoparticles (∼25nm) was produced in ACF substrates to grow CNF by CCVD. The prepared Zn-CNF was used to perform the hydrolysis reaction as a part of the two-step ZnO/Zn water splitting thermochemical cycle for producing hydrogen. In this method, the Zn nanoparticles have a dual role, i.e., as a catalyst to grow the CNF and as a reactant in the hydrolysis reaction. The AAS data and the SEM images showed broad and uniform dispersion of Zn nanoparticles in the ACF and dense growth of the CNF. The prepared Zn-CNF fabrics wrapped over the perforated portion of the tubular reactor were efficiently used in the reaction without entrainment of the nanoparticles in the flow of the reaction mixture. The average production rate and yield of H2 at 600°C were 1.66×10−6 mol/gs and approximately 80%, respectively, which are larger than or comparable to the data reported in the literature. The multi-scale web of Zn-CNF prepared in this study is a potential reactant for the hydrolysis reaction step of the two-step water splitting cycle."
