0,Introduction,"The rapid consumption of limited fossil fuel and the increasingly severe environmental pollution are driving the research of renewable and alternative source of energy [1,2]. Biodiesel, a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), is regarded as a promising replacement to fossil fuel because it is biodegradable, eco-friendly and non-toxic. Biodiesel has less climate impact compared with fossil diesel and the combustion of which could lead to significant reduction in carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, smoke, sulfur and particulate matter emissions [3–5]. Moreover, biodiesel can be directly used in current diesel engine without the need of modifications due to their similar physicochemical characteristics with diesel [6]. Biodiesel can be easily produced from vegetable oils or animal fats via transesterification with homogeneous alkaline catalysts [7,8]. Recently, non-edible oils such as waste cooking oils (WCO) have been widely used as feedstock to curtail the cost of biodiesel production [9–14]. Moreover, the use of WCO also resolves the problems related to their large emissions and complex contamination to environment. Unfortunately, WCO normally contain large amounts of free fatty acids (FFA), which readily react with alkaline catalysts via saponification, thus lowering the biodiesel yield [15–17]. Usually, a pre-esterification step is carried out to firstly convert FFAs to FAME with a homogeneous acid catalyst, and then transesterification is performed with alkaline catalyst. Nevertheless, the usage of homogeneous acid catalyst has resulted in challenges such as difficulty in separation of the homogeneous catalysts, strong corrosion to the equipment and extraordinarily large cost on wastewater treatment [18,19]. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are promising alternatives to homogeneous catalysts because they are easily separable and recyclable [10]. A large number of heterogeneous acid catalysts such as cation ion-exchange resins [10,20,21], sulphated and tungstated zirconia [22,23] and carbon-based solid acid catalysts [14,24–27] have been investigated in recent years for laboratory scale biodiesel production. Conventional cation ion-exchange resins, composed of sulfonic acid groups as the active site, can offer better selectivity towards the desired product(s) and better reusability compared with homogeneous acid catalysts. Cation ion-exchange resins have been widely used for esterification and transesterification reactions because they are non-corrosive and easy to be separated from the reaction mixture. [20,21,28,29]. Özbay et al. [30] investigated various cation ion-exchange resins for the esterification of waste cooking oils with methanol and they found that the superiority of physical properties of Amberlyst-15 (A-15) endow it the highest esterification efficiency among all the resins studied. However, the solvation and the partitioning phenomenon arisen from the high swelling of A-15 would lead to its relative poor reusability [29]. According to Tesser et al. [28], each SO3 − and H3O + group bonded to the surface of the A-15 can form a primary solvation shell containing 4–6 molecules as shown in the simplified scheme in Fig. 1 . Therefore, the activity of A-15 was significantly inhibited because it selectively retains the produced water during the esterification, altering the reaction equilibrium. To overcome this technical barrier, researchers have designed various complicated and costly processes such as pervaporation, vaporization, adsorption and azeotropic water removal processes to continuously remove the water produced and thereby favor the esterification [31–34]. Recently, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been used as a catalyst support because it displays high thermal stability, good mechanical strength and good chemical, biological resistance [35–37]. However, no intention was made to remove the produced water by PVA to enhance the esterification efficiency. In this work, an A-15/PVA membrane was prepared by phase inversion and was employed as a membrane-based catalyst for the esterification of acidified oil with methanol for biodiesel production. The compositions and stabilities of A-15/PVA membranes obtained at different annealing temperatures were investigated by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), total acidity (TA), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and swelling degree (SD) test. The reaction parameters such as annealing temperatures of the membranes, methanol/acidified oil mass ratio, catalyst dosage and reaction temperature were systematically optimized. A pseudo-first-order kinetic model of esterification catalyzed by A-15/PVA was developed and the apparent activation energy was calculated. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties and stability of the produced biodiesel were also comprehensively characterized."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cation ion-exchange resins, A-15, was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc. and the technical details are given in Table 1 . The pre-treated acidified oil obtained from waste cooking oils was kindly supplied by Haolin Bioenergy Company (Hubei, China) and filtered to remove the impurities. The compositions of the acidified oil were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS: 6890N, GC/5973 MS, Agilent) and the results are illustrated in Table 2 . The raw acidified oil mainly contains dodecanoic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and octadecadienoic acid. PVA with a polymerization degree of 1750 ± 50 was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., China. The water contents in the acidified oil and the produced biodiesel were tested by a Karl-Fisher water tester with a sensitivity of 500 ppm (KF-1A, Jintan Instrument Co., Ltd., China). The sulfur contents in the acidified oil and the produced biodiesel were tested by a micro-coulometric analyzer (WK-2D, Jianfen Electro-analytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China). Acidified oil contains no water and 140 ppm of sulfur. The other chemicals purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China) were all Analytical Reagent (AR) grade and used without further purification."
3,Membrane preparation,"2.2 Membrane preparation A-15 was firstly grounded to fine particles under liquid nitrogen to obtain fragments (24.96 µm) and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight prior to catalyst preparation. PVA homogeneous solutions (8 wt%, 100 mL) were prepared at 90 °C under continuous agitation for 6 h. After that, 12 g of A-15 powders were added into the PVA solution and stirred at 50 °C for 12 h. The solution was cast onto a PTFE plate and a copper wire in the range of 0.2–0.4 mm was used to control the membrane thickness. Then the PTFE plate was immersed into ethanol coagulation bath for phase inversion. The wet membranes were peeled off from the plate and dried at 50 °C for 24 h to obtain dry A-15/PVA membranes. Then the membranes were further treated at 50, 100 and 150 °C for 1 h, respectively."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization The degradation process and the thermal stabilities of the membranes were investigated using a STA449 F3 thermo gravimetry (NETZSCH Co., Germany). TGA measurement was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 500 °C. The FTIR curves of A-15, PVA and all the membranes annealed at different temperatures were characterized by a TENSOR-37 (BRUKER Co., Germany) operated by Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) in the wave number range of 2000–600 cm−1. About 1 mg of solid acid catalyst was diluted with 100 mg of KBr, grounded to form homogeneous phase and then pressed into a thin wafer prior to the FTIR test. The total acidity indicates the number of milli-equivalents of ions (H+) in dry catalyst of unit quality [26]. Total acidities of the catalysts were obtained by a KOH titration method. Briefly, 0.1 g dry catalyst was soaked in 100 mL NaCl solution (0.1 mol L−1) to equilibrate for 24 h. Then the ion-exchanged solution was titrated with 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution using phenolphthalein as indicator. The total acidity (TA) was calculated using Eq. (1): (1) TA = C KOH × V KOH m where TA is the total acidity (mmol g−1), CKOH is the concentration of KOH (mol L−1), VKOH is the volume of KOH used (mL), m is the weight of the dry A-15/PVA (g). The reported values were the means of five measurements and the experimental error was less than ±5%. Swelling degree, revealing the swelling status of the materials in a certain system, is one of the most important physical phenomena related to the solvent adsorption. Swelling degrees of the dried A-15, PVA and A-15/PVA membranes in various solutions were measured according to Caetano’s method [38]. The swelling degree, Q was calculated by Eq. (2): (2) Q = m - m 0 m 0 where m is the mass of swollen sample and m0 is the mass of initial sample. The reported values were the means of five measurements and the experimental error was less than ±5%. The sulfur compositions in the catalysts were determined by using a PE 2400 Series II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, USA). These analyses were performed for three times to minimize the experimental error."
5,Esterification by the A-15/PVA catalytic membranes,"2.4 Esterification by the A-15/PVA catalytic membranes 2.4.1 Batch esterification reaction To avoid the deactivation of catalysts from the adsorbed water, all the catalysts were vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight prior to the esterification tests. Esterification reactions were performed in a three-necked batch reactor under continuous mechanical stirring and under atmospheric pressure. The primary reaction conditions were: acidified oil 20 g; stirring rate 360 rpm; methanol/acidified oil mass ratio 2.5:1 (equivalent to molar ratio 29:1); catalyst dosage 4 g; reaction temperature 65 °C except otherwise mentioned. The acidified oil conversions (AO conversion) were then quantified using a gas chromatography (GC: 7890B, Agilent Technologies, USA). The temperatures of the injector and flame ionization detector were both at 250 °C. The oven temperature was ramped from 50 to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and held at 240 °C for 10 min. All the esterification reactions were at least triplicated and the reported AO conversion was the mean with standard deviation. The compositions of the acidified oil and the produced biodiesel were studied by a GC–MS (6890N, GC/5973 MS, Agilent Technologies). In repeated experiments, the membrane was reused in the next run without any treatment. 2.4.2 Continuous esterification reaction The continuous esterification was conducted using a fixed bed reactor packed with the most active A-15/PVA membranes selected in the batch reaction. The schematic diagram of the continuous esterification system was shown in Fig. 2 . A water-jacketed stainless steel column with an inner diameter of 5 cm and length of 20 cm was vertically placed and packed with A-15/PVA. The desired amount of methanol and acidified oil were mixed and preheated in a feedstock tank prior to be fed into the column with a peristaltic pump at a constant flow rate. The reaction temperature of the reaction system was kept constant with a hot water circulator and the error was no more than ±0.5 °C. The basic reaction conditions were: acidified oil 100 g, methanol/acidified oil mass ratio 2.5: 1, A-15/PVA 25 g, reaction temperature 65 °C and flow rate 1.2 mL min−1. The samples were taken out from the reaction system every 5 h to determinate the AO Conversion. After the completion of the continuous esterification, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and settled to separate the liquid phase (biodiesel, methanol and unreacted acidified oil) and solid phase (A-15/PVA). The liquid phase was poured into a separating funnel over night to separate excess methanol and the biodiesel. Then the biodiesel was purified by decompression distillation with a rotational evaporator under vacuum (10 ± 1 mm Hg) at 50 °C to remove excess methanol and other impurities. The biodiesel was further purified by washing, drying and decompression distillation to remove excess methanol and other impurities to obtain the refined biodiesel for physicochemical properties and GC–MS test (Fig. 3 )."
6,Physicochemical properties of biodiesel,"2.5 Physicochemical properties of biodiesel The flash point, pour point, viscosity, acid value, cetane value, sulfur content, water content, ash content and lower heating value of the refined biodiesel were measured by methods specified in the handbook of analytical methods for biodiesel, which are given in Table 3 [39]."
7,Engine performance test,"2.6 Engine performance test The schematic diagram of engine experiments including performance test and emission analysis of mentioned biodiesel-diesel blends are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The engine used in this study is a Four-stroke single-cylinder S195 Direct Inject diesel engine and the detailed specifications are listed in Table 4 . Prior to the engine performance test and emission analysis, the refined biodiesel was blended with fossil diesel at 5 vol%, 10 vol%, and 20 vol%, using a mechanical stirrer at 3000 rpm for 30 min to obtain biodiesel-diesel blends. The engine was firstly run with fossil diesel for 20 min to obtain a steady operating condition. Then the fuel was switched to biodiesel-diesel blend and was kept running for another 10 min with the biodiesel-diesel blend before recording the experimental data. The measurement was taken under six loads (i.e. 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of rated engine load) at the rated engine speed of 2200 rpm. The engine load was measured by a DYNOmite-Pro toroidal water-brake dynamometer. A 10 mL burette with sensitivity of 0.1 mL and a timer with sensitivity of 0.01 s are used to measure the fuel consumption during the engine performance test. For each individual fuel, the measurements of engine loads and fuel consumptions were taken for 5 times and the reported value was the average values with standard deviation. The measured engine loads and fuel consumptions were used to calculate brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine with different test fuels (Eq.3 and 4). The test fuels includes fossil diesel, 5% biodiesel in diesel (B5), 10% biodiesel in diesel (B10), 20% biodiesel in diesel (B20) and the refined biodiesel. (3) BSFC = m fuel P × 10 3 (4) BTE = P × m fuel × Q LHV 3600 × 100 % where mfuel is the fuel consumption (g h−1), P is the engine power (kW), and QLHV is the lower heating value of the fuel (MJ kg−1)."
8,Emission analysis,"2.7 Emission analysis Smoke opacity, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and NOX emissions of the exhaust fuels were measured and the detailed specifications of the smoke meter and gas analyzer are shown in Table 5 . The emission values for each fuel were taken for five times to obtain the average value with ± standard error."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of the A-15/PVA,"3.1 Characterization of the A-15/PVA The thermal stabilities of A-15/PVA membranes annealed at different temperatures were examined by TGA and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . TGA curves of A-15/PVA involves four main degradation stages arising from desolvation, dehydroxylation, desulfonation and decomposition of the polymer main chains. The detailed weight losses of A-15/PVA annealed at different temperatures in each degradation stage are thoroughly calculated (see inset in Fig. 5). In the first weight loss up to 120 °C, the weight losses are 13, 8 and 4 wt% for the A-15/PVA annealed at 50, 100 and 150 °C, respectively, demonstrating that water in the membrane decreased with the increase of annealing temperatures. In the second weight loss region of 120–240 °C, the weight loss of the membrane also decreases from 35 to 12 wt% as the annealing temperature increased from 50 to 150 °C. This is might result from the dehydroxylation of OH groups with other groups at high annealling temperatures. However, the weight loss in the third degradation region (240–480 °C) increases from 9 to 13 wt% due to the loss of water and OH groups at higher annealing temperatures in unit quality of A-15/PVA. The polymer main chains are further degraded in the fourth weight loss region at temperature over 480 °C. The FTIR spectra of A-15/PVA membranes annealed at 50, 100 and 150 °C were illustrated in Fig. 6 . The FTIR curve of A-15/PVA exhibits three strong peaks at 1090, 1400 and 1040 cm−1, attributed to be C-OH stretching vibration, O–H deformation vibration and symmetric OSO stretching vibrations, respectively [40,41]. All the three peaks become weaker when the annealing temperature increased from 50 to 150 °C, indicating that the OH groups might react with SO3H groups in A-15 [35]. In addition, the peak at 770 cm−1 for the O2SOC bond of sulfonic acid ester turns noticeably stronger in the membrane annealed at 150 °C, demonstrating that the OH groups reacted with the SO3H to form O2SOC bond in A-15/PVA during annealing treatment especially at over 100 °C. Table 6 exhibited total acidities (TA) of A-15/PVA annealed at different temperatures. It is found that TA value increased when the annealing temperature increased from 50 to 100 °C due to the loss of water content after annealing at 100 °C. However, TA value decreased significantly when further increases the annealing temperature to 150 °C. This is mainly because SO3H groups in A-15 reacted with OH groups in PVA when annealed at higher temperatures (based on TGA and FTIR results), thus decreased the number of SO3H groups in the membrane and resulted in decreased TA value. Swelling degrees of the A-15, PVA, and A-15/PVA under different annealing temperatures in methanol, water, and acidified oil, respectively were measured and are also summarized in Table 6. Pure PVA adsorbs water readily with a SD of 2.06 while it barely adsorbs methanol (SD: 0.04) and acidified oil (SD: 0.02) due to its high selectivity of polar molecules (water) over non-polar molecules (methanol and acidified oil) [29]. However, A-15 adsorbs a large number of all the three solutions with a SD of 0.77, 0.67 and 0.61 in acidified oil, water and methanol, respectively, which is arisen from solvation and partitioning phenomenon [29]. It is noted that PVA has thrice higher SD in water than A-15, suggesting that the OH groups in PVA could selectively adsorb more water than that of the SO3H groups in A-15. For the A-15/PVA, the SD increased when the annealing temperature increased from 50 to 100 °C, indicating 50 °C is not high enough to remove solutions inside A-15/PVA. However, these SD values decreased when further increase the temperature to 150 °C due to the OH groups react with SO3H groups in A-15 at 150 °C (based on TGA, FTIR and TA results). Based on the above findings, we predict that the reactants (methanol and acidified oil) would be readily adsorbed into the A-15 regions while the produced water will be competitively adsorbed in PVA regions during the esterification. Furthermore, the A-15/PVA annealled at 100 °C with the highest TA and SD values will be used in the experiments thereafter."
11,Catalytic activity of the A-15/PVA membranes,"3.2 Catalytic activity of the A-15/PVA membranes 3.2.1 Effect of various reaction parameters on the batch esterification Esterification of methanol with acidified oil was performed at 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65 °C, respectively to optimize the reaction temperatures. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), AO conversion increases rapidly from 62% to 93% when the reaction temperature rises from 45 to 65 °C. As shown in Table S5, the viscosity value of the reaction liquid decreased significantly from 2.41 to 1.07 with the temperature increased from 25 to 65 °C. The decreased viscosity significantly promoted the molecule motion of reactants (methanol and acidified oil) and mass transfer rate in the reaction system, resulting in higher AO conversion. Apart from that, the color of the reaction mixture changed from inky to auburn when the temperature was increased from 25 to 65 °C (Fig. S1), which is in accordance with the viscosity measurement results. Thus, the optimal reaction temperature is 65 °C in this reaction system and will be used in the experiments thereafter. Acidified O i l + C H 3 O H ⟷ catalyst E s t e r s + H 2 O As shown in the above scheme, esterification of acidified oil with methanol is reversible and the methanol/acidified oil molar ratio is a vital reaction parameter. Stoichiometrically, one molar of methanol was required for one molar of acidified oil. But esterification was generally carried out with excessive methanol to drive the reaction towards right and to produce more biodiesel. Esterification was carried out with the methanol/acidified oil mass ratios between 1.0: 1 and 4.0: 1 and the results are shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be seen that esterification was significantly affected by methanol/acidified oil mass ratio. AO conversion increased from 69% to 94% when the methanol/acidified oil mass ratio increased from 1.0: 1 to 2.5: 1. However, further increment in methanol/acidified oil mass ratio did not promote the esterification reaction and led to reduced AO conversion. This is mainly because excess methanol can be adsorbed on the surface and deactivates the catalytic membrane. The optimized methanol/acidified oil mass ratio is 2.5:1 in the reaction system. The effect of catalyst dosage on the reaction was studied and the results are illustrated in Fig. 7(c). The esterification could not proceed efficiently with a small quantity of A-15/PVA as there are not sufficient active sites. AO conversion increases with the increment of the membrane dosage within 5 g and the conversion maintain stable when the membrane dosage exceeds 5 g. In consideration of the production cost of biodiesel, the optimal A-15/PVA dosage is 5 g. The effect of the water content on the esterification was studied by deliberately adding water into the reaction system before the reaction and the results are shown in Fig. 7(d). As predicted, AO conversion decreased with increasing water content for A-15/PVA. The AO conversion by A-15/PVA decreased only slightly from 97% to 83% by adding 1 g of water but decreased sharply after adding 3 g of water (<52%), suggesting that PVA can adsorb certain amount of water and therefore would weaken the side effect. However, AO conversion of esterification by A-15 decreased dramatically to 32% and 9% when adding 1 g and 3 g of water, respectively, due to the poisoning of catalytic activity sites by the produced water (Fig. S2). Distribution of the produced water after esterification catalyzed by individual catalyst was studied and and the results are exhibited in Table 7 . No water was detected in the solution after esterification by PVA because the produced water was completely adsorbed by PVA in the form of hydrogen bond. Only 20% of the produced water is observed in the reaction solution for esterification by A-15, suggesting 80% of the water produced is adsorbed in the SO3H groups of A-15, which deactivates the A-15. Similar phenomenon is observed for esterification by A-15/PVA, the measured water contents were much lower than the calculated value based on the AO conversion and only 20% of the produced water is observed in the reaction solution. As we have figured out in the Section 3.1, PVA has thrice higher SD in water than A-15, therefore 80% of the water produced is primarily adsorbed in the PVA region in the A-15/PVA, which liberates the SO3H groups. In this way, the esterification would be pushed forward and this could explain the higher AO conversion with A-15/PVA over A-15 and H2SO4 (Fig. 9 ). Based on all the findings mentioned above, we can get two roles of A-15/PVA played in esterification: providing catalytic active sites and adsorbing the water produced to drive esterification forward. Previously, it has been reported that stirring rate is an extraordinary important parameter related to the external diffusion in various reactions. To investigate the effect of external diffusion on the reaction, esterification was conducted with different mechanical stirring rates of 360, 480 and 600 revolutions per minute (rpm). As shown in Fig. 8 (a), stirring rate almost does not the AO conversion, suggesting that the external diffusion has minimum influence on esterification. Therefore, the stirring rate of 360 rpm will be used in the experiments thereafter. Apart from external diffusion, internal diffusion is also another key parameter controlling the mass transfer resistance. The internal diffusion was mainly influenced by the thickness and dimension for membrane-based catalysts. In order to understand the internal diffusion, additional experiments were performed to test the effect of membrane thickness and dimension on the esterification. It can be seen in Fig. 8(b and c) that there is no significant difference (<5%) in AO conversions between A-15/PVA with different thicknesses and membrane dimensions, suggesting that internal diffusion is not a rate-control factor. Both external diffusion and internal diffusion have negligible effect, suggesting that the esterification on A-15/PVA are not diffusively controlled but kinetically controlled. This can be further confirmed by the spongy and porous structure of A-15/PVA membrane in SEM image (Fig. S3). These fairly uniform pores in the polymer matrix are beneficial for the reactants (methanol and acidified oil) to flow smoothly onto the catalytic activity sites and promote the esterification. 3.2.2 The equilibrium conversion under the optimal reaction conditions The esterification catalyzed by different catalysts were carried out under the optimal reaction conditions and the results are shown in Fig. 9. AO conversion without catalyst is 4.2% because acidified oil could act as weak acid catalysts in esterification [42]. Despite the fact that not providing catalytic active sites, PVA promotes esterification and AO conversion reaches 12.4% due to the adsorption of the produced water, which drives the reaction right. The reaction by A-15 is relatively slow and the conversion is 67.6% after 8 h. On the contrary, the esterification catalyzed by sulfuric acid proceeds quickly in the initial 2 h due to its homogeneous nature and the AO conversion reaches 78.4% in 8 h. The AO conversion using A-15/PVA reaches 98% under the optimal reaction conditions, suggesting that A-15/PVA heterogeneous catalyst can take place of the conventional homogenous catalyst, sulfuric acid. 3.2.3 Reusability of the catalytic membranes Deactivation of heterogeneous acid catalyst was mainly caused by three reasons: the adsorption of products and by-products on the surface of the catalyst, the leaching of catalytic activate sites into solutions and the structural collision of catalyst [42,43]. The A-15 and A-15/PVA were directly employed in the next esterification without additional treatment for six runs and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . A-15 exhibits poor catalytic reusability and the catalytic activity decreases sharply in the following runs from 67.6% in the 1st run to 28.4% in the 6th run. However, A-15/PVA shows much better catalytic activity for esterification (98% of AO conversion) and the activity decreases only slightly even after six runs (87.2%). Based on TGA results (Fig. 5), the structure decomposition of A-15/PVA did not occur until over 240 °C, which is much higher than the esterification temperature (65 °C). Thus, the structural collision of catalyst could be negligible in this whole experiment. As illustrated in Table 8 , sulfur content kept stable in catalysts and the reaction solutions for the two catalysts, suggesting that there is almost no leaching of catalytic activate sites during esterification. These above finds clearly suggested that the adsorption of the produced water onto A-15 and A-15/PVA is the main reason accounting for the decrease of their catalytic activities. In this way, PVA could enhance the reusability of A-15/PVA in recycle runs by adsorbing the produced water and liberating the reactive SO3H sites. This endows the promising potential of A-15/PVA in the large scale and continuous production of biodiesel. 3.2.4 Reaction kinetics and esterification process catalyzed by A-15/PVA During this work, the methanol/acidified oil molar ratio was 29: 1 (mass ratio of 2.5: 1), which was high enough and the methanol concentration was stable at the initial reaction stage. Therefore, the effect of methanol concentration on reaction kinetics could be neglected in this work. In addition, esterification reactions on A-15/PVA are not diffusively controlled but kinetically controlled under these reaction conditions (Section 3.2.1). Therefore, the initial reaction kinetics should be able to be treated as a pseudo-first-order. As shown in Fig. S4(b), esterification reaction is fitted badly under reaction time of 8 h. However, the AO conversion in the first 4 h can be very well fitted with the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (Fig. S4(a)). Therefore, the AO conversion values in the first 4 h were used for further kinetic study. Indeed, the AO conversion in the first 4 h can be very well fitted with a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (R2 > 0.99) (Fig. 11 (a)). Then the reaction rate constant k at different reaction temperatures can be obtained and the apparent activated energy can be calculated with Arrhenius equation: (5) ln k = E a / R T + ln A where Ea is the apparent activation energy (kJ mol−1), k is the reaction rate constant (s−1), R is universal gas constant, T is the reaction temperature (K) and A is pre-exponential factor (s−1). As shown in Fig. 11(b), the plot of lnk versus 1/T can be represented by a straight line and the apparent activation energy of esterification catalyzed by A-15/PVA is determined to be 45.9 kJ mol−1. The apparent activation energy for A-15 (54 kJ mol−1) is higher than the value of A-15/PVA, suggesting the improvement of instinct catalytic activity of A-15 by the addition of PVA in the catalysis esterification. The high apparent activation energy value also further demonstrate that diffusion is not important during the esterification of acidified oil with methanol (Fig. 8) [44]. Based on all the discussions mentioned above, the esterification process of acidified oil with methanol catalyzed by A-15/PVA was predicted and illustrated in Fig. 12 , the esterification experienced three main steps: 1) diffusion of acidified oil and methanol into the A-15/PVA regions; 2) chemical adsorption and surface esterification reaction on the A-15/PVA; 3) diffusion of the produced biodiesel and water out of catalysts regions to the liquid phase and the adsorption of water by the hydroxyl groups of PVA through the formation of hydrogen bonds. 3.2.5 Continuous esterification reaction The optimal continuous esterification reaction conditions were determined to be: acidified oil 100 g, methanol/acidified oil mass ratio 2.5: 1, A-15/PVA 25 g, reaction temperature 65 °C and flow rate 1.2 mL min−1 (Tables S1–S4). As shown in Fig. 13 , the AO conversions kept over 98.0% during 120 h of continuous running under the optimal reaction conditions, indicating high yield of biodiesel and excellent operational stability. It is therefore believed that the A-15/PVA is suitable for application in large-scale industrial production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils."
12,Physicochemical properties and stability of the produced biodiesel,"3.3 Physicochemical properties and stability of the produced biodiesel 3.3.1 Physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel The physicochemical properties of biodiesel are the most important parameters, especially from the engine viewpoint. The properties of obtained biodiesel are mainly dependent on the FAME compositions. As shown in Table 9 , FAME compositions in the produced biodiesel mainly consisted of four constituents: dodecanoic acid methyl ester, myristic acid methyl ester, palmitic acid methyl ester, and 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid (Z, Z) methyl ester. This indicates that the compositions of the acidified oil (Table 2) have been successfully converted into their corresponding esters after esterification. The major fuel properties of refined biodiesel was systematically characterized by determining the density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cetane number, pour point, lower heating value, acid value, water and ash content. The results are illustrated in Table 10 and compared with the ASTM D6751, EN 14214 and GBT 20828 standards. Biodiesel density, which influences the efficiency of atomization, mainly depends on the feedstock used, the esters content and the remained methanol content [45]. Therefore, the values are set between 820 and 900 kg/m3 in many national standards. The density of the produced biodiesel at 15 °C is 887 kg/m3, satisfying the biodiesel standards in America, European Union and China. Kinematic viscosity reveals the extent of the transesterification reaction and the purity of FAME in the produced biodiesel [46]. In fact, the viscosity must be low because high value would lead to incomplete combustion and severe carbon deposition [45]. Kinematic viscosity of the biodiesel prepared in this study is 4.26 mm2/s at 40 °C, falling in the range specified in all the three standards. Flash point is related to the flammability and safety of biodiesel and high values of flash point could decrease the risk of fire in handling, transportation and storage [47]. The flash point of the produced biodiesel in this work is 196 °C, which is high enough to meet the values prescribed by the three standards. Besides, cetane number is an important indicator of the biodiesel quality, indicating the smoothness of combustion. The ignition quality, combustion properties, stability and hydrocarbon emission increase with the increase of the cetane number. The cetane number of the produced biodiesel is 52 mm2/s, which is high enough to represent excellent ignition quality. Pour point is the lowest temperature at which the fuel flows, reflecting the usability of biodiesel at low operating temperatures [45]. Normally, the values of pour point of biodiesel from waste cooking oils are high compared with mineral diesel due to the presence of unknown compounds formed during transesterification. Pour point of the biodiesel produced is 4 °C, conforming to all the three biodiesel standards. The acid value reveals the content of free fatty acids in the fuel sample, which affects the density and stability of biodiesel. Acid value of the biodiesel is 0.15 mg KOH/g, complying with the maximum values in all the standards. The existence of high level of water and ash in biodiesel would cause severe metal corrosion, poor combustion and decreased flash point and thus decrease biodiesel property. The biodiesel produced from acidified oil possesses trace water, and ash fully meeting the minimal values in all the three standards. Based on all the above findings, all the measured properties of the fresh produced biodiesel are in the range of the standards of America, European Union and China, suggesting that the biodiesel produced from acidified oil can be applied in diesel engines without the need of engines modification. 3.3.2 Stability of the produced biodiesel The stability of biodiesel is another major concern in terms of the biodiesel quality. Oxidation and polymerization readily occur during biodiesel storage, forming un-dissolvable gum and sediments and making biodiesel more “acidic” [46,48,49]. The oxidation and polymerization process of biodiesel are influenced by several factors such as light, temperature, surface area between biodiesel and air [46]. After stored in a sealed tank for 1 year, the biodiesel properties were measured and the results are also illustrated in Table 10. The density, kinematic viscosity, pour point, oxide content and acid value increased slightly due to that the unsaturated fatty acids were unstable and oxidized after stored for a long time [48]. The flash point and cetane number decreased while the water and ash content in biodiesel kept stable after 1 year. Nevertheless, all these properties are still in the ranges of the three national standards. Apart from that, biodiesel is commonly used after adding antioxidants as stabilizers prior to use in practice. Overall, the biodiesel produced from acidified oil has excellent quality and the biodiesel can be used as a substitution to diesel without engine modifications."
13,Engine test,"3.4 Engine test 3.4.1 BSFC BSFC is an important parameter and is widely used as a measurement of the performance of different fuels. BSFC for all the fuels at different engine loads were calculated and illustrated in Fig. 14 (a). The BSFC values for each fuel almost linearly decreased with an increase of load from 10 to 60% and increased slightly after 60%. Diesel possesses the lowest BAFC values at all loads and the value increased with the incensement of biodiesel volume percentage in the blends. Biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil possesses the highest BSFC value due to its lowest calorific value and highest density among all the test fuels (Table 10). Apart from these two factors, the highest BSFC of biodiesel could be attributed to the vaporization and atomization of the fuel were obstructed due to the high viscosity of biodiesel. 3.4.2 BTE Brake thermal efficiency is defined as the ratio of the engine power to the energy introduced, which is the product of the lower heating value with the fuel mass flow rate. The evolutions of BTE of all the test fuels with respect to engine loads are presented in Fig. 14 (b). BTE values decreased with the engine loads increased from 10% to 60% and then decreased slightly for all the test fuels. It is clearly noted that biodiesel and all the fuel blends showed lower BTE values compared to diesel, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of higher viscosity and lower heating value of biodiesel (Table 10)."
14,Engine emissions,"3.5 Engine emissions 3.5.1 Smoke opacity The evolution of smoke opacity for all the test fuels respected to load and speed respectively are illustrated in Fig. 15 . It is clearly noted that smoke opacity decreased significantly with the use of biodiesel compared to diesel, suggesting the merits of biodiesel in term of smoke opacity. This is mainly because of the smooth combustion of biodiesel arisen from its higher oxygen and lower sulfur content. The smoke opacity values decreased with the raise of engine load within 80%, but the value increased sharply due to the incomplete combustion. It is also found that the smoke opacity value decreased with the increase of engine speed. 3.5.2 CO emissions CO is always produced due to the incomplete combustion of the hydrocarbon fuels. Fig. 16 showed the CO emissions values of all the test fuels under different loads and engine speeds. Biodiesel demonstrated the lowest CO emission values due to the high oxygen content of biodiesel, which result in adequate combustion. Co emission value decreased up to 50% by burning biodiesel compared to the burning of diesel. Similar to smoke opacity, the CO emissions decreased slightly when the engine load increased from 10% to 60% because of the better combustion. Under low engine load like 10%, it is difficult for the CO to be further transferred into CO2 at low chamber temperatures. However, the CO emission values increased significantly due to the incomplete combustion arisen from low oxygen supply and shorter ignition time. It is also noted that CO emission values were not greatly affected by engine speed and the values kept stable for individual fuel at different speeds. 3.5.3 HC emissions HC emissions are mostly depends on the fuel quality and the extent of air mixture. It can be seen from Fig. 17 that biodiesel reduced the HC emissions by over 40% compared to diesel under the same load and speed. This is mainly attributed to the efficient combustion of biodiesel arisen from its high oxygen content. The HC emission was relative high because the chamber temperature is low under engine load of 10%. The HC decreased slightly when the load is increased due to the lean combustion. As clearly seen in the Fig. 17 (b), HC emissions were not significantly affected by the engine speed. 3.5.4 NOX emissions NOx emissions are formed with the reaction of oxygen and nitrogen during the combustion process. Basically, NOx emissions were greatly influenced by the oxygen content in the fuel, which could affect the combustion temperature, duration and cylinder pressure. Fig. 18 showed the NOx emissions of all the test fuels obtained under different engine loads and speeds. Biodiesel possessed the highest NOx emissions among all the test fuels, 30% higher than that of diesel. This is mainly because of the better ignition effect of biodiesel compared to diesel. NOx emissions increased almost linearly with the raise of engine load resulted from the higher chamber temperature. However, the NOx emissions were not significantly affected by the engine speed."
15,Conclusion,"In the present work, A-15/PVA membranes with both catalytic and water-adsorbing functions have been prepared and used in the esterification of acidified oil with methanol. The prepared A-15/PVA exhibited excellent catalytic performance and reusability in both batch and continuous esterification systems for the production of high-quality biodiesel. The produced biodiesel demonstrated not only excellent performance, which fulfills the specification of international fuel standards, but also pleasant emission characteristics. The A-15/PVA membrane showed promise as a highly active and stable solid acidic catalyst for the production of high-quality biodiesel, especially on the industrial large scale."
