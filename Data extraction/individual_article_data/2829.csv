0,Introduction,"Bio-conversion of a biomass to produce hydrogen has been demonstrated utilizing anaerobic fermentation of some well-defined compounds in water [1–4]. Only limited data on hydrogen yield from wastewater sludge have been reported [5,6]. Production of biohydrogen from waste materials is considered an attractive future energy source [7]. Cellulose is a predominant constituent of agricultural waste and waste generated by the pulp and paper industry. To generate hydrogen directly from cellulose materials using dark fermentation requires expensive pretreatment processes such as delignification and hydrolysis to dissolve organic matter from a lignocellulose complex [8–10]. Lay [11] investigated the potential of producing hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose using mesophilic digestion with heat-shocked sludge. With a 4-day lag, a maximum hydrogen yield of 4.36 mg g - 1 cellulose was produced from suspensions containing 12.5 g cellulose l - 1 . The metabolites were predominantly alcohols, followed by volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Liu et al. [12] determined that their mixed culture comprising microbes closely affiliated with the genus Thermoanaerobacterium produced hydrogen that peaked at 7.56 mg H 2 g - 1 cellulose and a maximum rate of 21.2 mg H 2 g - 1 VSS d - 1 from a 5 g cellulose l - 1 suspension maintained at pH 6.5 and 55 ∘ C . The metabolites observed were primarily acetate, butyrate, and ethanol. Isolating strains that can effectively utilize cellulose materials to produce hydrogen at room temperature is of great practical interest. This study isolated a strain, a member of clostridia genera (Clostridium acetobutylicum, ATCC 824), from a hydrogen-producing reactor, and determined hydrogen production potential of this strain from microcrystalline cellulose suspensions at 37 ∘ C . This work also tested whether this stain can work with another strain, Ethanoigenens harbinense B 49 , which can produce hydrogen efficiently from monosaccharides, for bioaugmented biohydrogen production from microcrystalline cellulose. The maximum hydrogen yield in the bioaugmented co-cultured system was 16.2 mg H 2 g - 1 cellulose, the highest amongst those reported in literature to produce biohydrogen from cellulose materials."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strain cultivation,"2.1 Strain cultivation Liquor samples were obtained from a pilot-scale hydrogen fermenter in Harbin, China, which is a continuous flow anaerobic fermentation reactor with working volume of 1.48 m 3 and fed with molasses as the substrate. The operation was performed under organic loading rates of 3.11 – 85.8 kg COD m - 3 d - 1 for over 200 days. The liquid samples were placed in aseptically mixed sterilized tubes containing 50ml medium. The chemical composition of the medium was ( g l - 1 ) : microcrystalline cellulose, 10g; peptone, 4.0g; beef extract, 2.0g; yeast extract, 1.0g; MgCl 2 , 0.15g; FeSO 4 , 0.15g; NaCl, 1.0g; K 2 HPO 4 , 1.5g; L-cysteine, 0.5g. An amount of 10 ml l - 1 medium of both vitamins (per liter: cyanocobalamin 0.01g, ascorbic acid 0.025g, riboflavin 0.025g, citric acid 0.02g, pyridoxine 0.05g, folic acid 0.01g, 4-aminobenzoic acid 0.01g, and creatine 0.025g) and micronutrients ( MnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 0.01g, ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 0.05g, H 3 BO 3 0.01g, N ( CH 2 COOH ) 3 4.5g, CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O 0.01g, Na 2 MoO 4 0.01g, CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 0.2g, AlK ( SO 4 ) 2 0.01g), and 1ml of resazurin (0.2%) were also added. The microcrystalline cellulose utilized has cellulose content at 97.2% (dry basis) and a water solubility < 0.1 % . The mixtures were incubated at 37 ∘ C for 18h. Suspension samples collected from the incubated tubes were plated on agar plates. Three isolates with maximum potential to produce hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose were chosen for further study."
3,DNA extraction and sequencing,"2.2 DNA extraction and sequencing The strain DNA was extracted by enzymatic lysis using extraction buffer (100mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0; 100mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 1.5M NaCl) containing proteinase K ( 10 mg ml - 1 ) . The samples were incubated at 37 ∘ C and shaken at 150rpm for 30min. The SDS was added (20%) to samples and incubated at 65 ∘ C for 90min. Samples were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing. Supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 6000g for 10min, and the aqueous phase was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v:v:v). The DNA was precipitated using isopropanol, pelleted by centrifugation (10000g) for 10min, and resuspended in water. The DNA amplification reaction was conducted with primers BSF8/20—5’-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3’ and PLA—5’-GGTACTTAGATGTTTCAGTTC-3’. The PTC-100 (MJ Research, San Francisco, CA, USA) was utilized for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplication. The reaction system for PCR multiplication was 10 μ l buffer ( 10 μ mol ) , 3 μ l primer BSF8/20 ( 0.6 μ mol ) , 3 μ l primer PLA ( 0.6 μ mol ) , 8 μ l dNTP ( 200 μ mol ) , 0.5 μ l Tag enzyme ( 5 U μ l - 1 ) , 1 μ l template ( 0.05 – 1.00 μ g μ l - 1 ) , and 74.5 μ l ddH 2 O . The DNA was amplified using eppendorf mastercycler (eppendorf AG, Germany) by denaturation at 94 ∘ C for 4min, annealing at 55 ∘ C for 1min, elongating at 72 ∘ C for 1.5min for 30 cycles, and elongating at 72 ∘ C for 10min. The PCR-amplified 16S rRNA was purified by low melting point agarose electrophoresis. The DNA was sequenced using the ABI Prism model 3730 (version 3.2) DNA sequencer."
4,Fermenting test,"2.3 Fermenting test Fermentation tests were performed using the same medium as that in cultivation tests (Section 2.1). Briefly, 50ml sterilized medium was mixed with 10ml inoculum (biomass of 0.375g dry cells) and was kept at 37 ∘ C for 18h. The isolated strain that had the highest hydrogen potential among those isolates from microcrystalline cellulose suspensions was tested further. Another strain isolated by [13], B 49 , AF481148 in NCBI, was utilized to co-work with the isolated strain X 9 in fermentation tests. In the co-culture tests, the two strains were mixed at the same volumes at a fixed total biomass quantity (0.375g dry cells)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods A wet gas meter was utilized to measure biogas production volume at room temperature. The VFA and alcohol contents in centrifugated (4000rpm) fermenting liquor were determined by a gas chromatography (GC112, Perkin Elmer, USA) with nitrogen as the carrier gas (flow rate of 60 ml min - 1 ). The hydrogen flame detector were employed with hydrogen and air flow rates of 50 and 490 ml min - 1 , respectively, and a stainless steel column (2m) packed with GDX-103 (60–80 meshes). The column and all cells were kept at 190 ∘ C . Hydrogen content in the gas phase was determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen as the carrier gas ( 70 ml min - 1 ) and a thermal conductivity detector. The column (2m) was packed with TDS-01 (60–80 meshes). The column and detector were kept at 150 ∘ C . Based on the measured hydrogen production quantity and cell amount, and maximum hydrogen production rate ( Q H 2 ) was calculated as Q H 2 = ( maximum hydrogen production rate ) × ( hydrogen content in gas ) / dry cell mass ( mmol g - 1 dry cells). The specific hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) was approximated as Y H 2 = ( accumulated biogas production quantity ) × (hydrogen content in gas)/(medium volume). The contents of reduced sugars were determined using the dinitrosalicylic (DNS) technique. The hydrolysis content in microcrystalline cellulose was estimated using the carbon balance calculation: Hydrolysis ratio ( % ) = ( C ( CO 2 ) + C ( EtOH ) + C ( Ac ) + C ( Bu ) + C ( reduced sugar ) ) / ( C ( cellulose ) ) An atomic force microscope and a scanning electron microscope (model S-4500, Hitachi Co., Japan) were utilized to assess the morphology of isolates and stain B 49 ."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Isolated strains and screening tests,"3.1 Isolated strains and screening tests The strains isolated from fermenting liquor were tested with their hydrogen production potentials from microcrystalline cellulose. Three isolated strains, X 9 , B 2 , and C 3 , had high hydrogen yields from microcrystalline cellulose (Table 1 ). That is, strains X 9 , B 2 , and C 3 generated hydrogen yields of 755, 68.8, and 267 ml l - 1 medium, respectively. Furthermore, as expected, strain B 49 did not produce hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose (Table 1). The associated metabolites for strain X 9 using microcrystalline cellulose were primarily acetate and butyrate, whereas those for B 2 and C 3 were ethanol and acetate. That is, strain X 9 had typical butyrate-type fermentation metabolism, whereas B 2 and C 3 underwent so-called ethanol-type fermentation metabolism [14]. To determine the maximum hydrogen yield the present isolates could derive from microcrystalline cellulose, strain X 9 is discussed further in subsequent sections."
8,Strain X 9 and hydrogen production,"3.2 Strain X 9 and hydrogen production The partial genome of 1496bp from strain X 9 was isolated and aligned using NCBI blast. This strain had 96% sequence similarity with C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The cells were regular rods ( 0.3 – 0.4 × 5 – 8 μ m ) without flagellum and occurred singly (Fig. 1 ). Physiological tests demonstrated that the optimal temperature and pH for strain X 9 to degrade microcrystalline cellulose were 40 ∘ C and 5.0, respectively (data not shown). Doubling time of X 9 was 1.6h. Fig. 2 presents the hydrogen yield and cellulose hydrolysis ratio for strain X 9 to degrade microcrystalline cellulose at 37 ∘ C and pH 5.0. Initially, approximately 10% of the cellulose was rapidly hydrolyzed. Further cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen production did not occur during a 5-h lag phase. The cellulose was then promptly hydrolyzed and hydrogen was produced primarily in the following 3–6h. The corresponding hydrogen yield, maximum hydrogen production rate, and cellulose hydrolysis ratio reached 755 ml l - 1 medium, 6.4 mmol H 2 h - 1 g - 1 dry cell, and 68.3%, respectively. Hence, strain X 9 has a good capability to hydrolyze microcrystalline cellulose and then convert it into hydrogen."
9,Co-culture of strains X 9 and B 49,"3.3 Co-culture of strains X 9 and B 49 Strain B 49 , identified as a novel Ethanoigenens strain, is gram-positive, no-spore-forming, no encapsulate, strict anaerobe [13]. The cells of B 49 were straight rods ( 0.3 – 0.4 × 1 – 5.5 μ m ) without flagella and occurred singly (Fig. 3 ). The optimal temperature and pH for B 49 to grow and produce hydrogen from glucose was 37 ∘ C and 4.8, respectively. Doubling time was 7.2h. Strain B 49 can utilize glucose, wheat, soybean, corn, potato starch, and molasses in wastewater, but cannot utilize microcrystalline cellulose. This strain produced hydrogen from glucose with maximum hydrogen production rate of 25 mmol H 2 h - 1 g - 1 dry cells and a hydrogen yield of 1810 ml l - 1 medium [13]. When the two strains were co-cultured in a medium, hydrogen production was initiated immediately following initiation of fermentation (Fig. 4 ). The entire fermentation process was completed in 6h, generating a high hydrogen yield, maximum hydrogen production rate, and a cellulose hydrolysis ratio of 1810 ml l - 1 medium, 55.4 mmol H 2 h - 1 g - 1 dry cell, and 77.6%, respectively. The hydrogen yield by strains X 9 + B 49 was roughly 2.4 times that for the monoculture test with only X 9 (Fig. 2), and was close to the yield from glucose with B 49 alone. Since strain B 49 alone could not utilize microcrystalline cellulose (Table 1); hence, simultaneous bioaugmentation with the two strains in the fermenting liquor significantly improved cellulose hydrolysis and subsequent hydrogen production rates as compared with that of monoculture bioaugmentation."
10,Metabolites,"3.4 Metabolites In a mono-cultured test with X 9 , the suspension pH dropped from 6.7 gradually during the initial 5h to approximately 4.2–4.5, as shown in Fig. 5 . This pH drop corresponded to the lag phase for hydrogen production noted in Fig. 2. The content of reduced sugar peaked at 0.10 – 0.13 g l - 1 (Fig. 6 ). Following this lag phase, cellulose was rapidly hydrolyzed and hydrogen began to be produced, whereas the corresponding suspension pH was retained near 4.2, and the content of reduced sugar rapidly dropped to very low value at 7h and after. In the co-culture test, cellulose hydrolysis and metabolite formation occurred right after fermentation started. The pH dropped to near 4.1 in 1h of fermentation (Fig. 5). The reduced sugar did not accumulate in the fermenting liquor to a detectable quantity. The end liquid products of mono-culture test were primarily acetate and butyrate (Table 1 and Fig. 7 ), whose molar ratio (acetate/butyrate) was near 1.3. When both X 9 and B 49 were co-cultured in the fermenting liquor, the end liquid products were acetate, ethanol, and butyrate (Fig. 8 ), with a molar ratio (acetate/ethanol/butyrate) of nearly 2.5:2.5:1.0. In other words, co-cultured strains underwent the ethanol-type fermentation discussed by Ren et al. [14]. This occurrence was attributable to the fact that strain B 49 degrades glucose via an ethanol-type fermentation pathway [13]. The 5-h phase lag for the mono-culture test with X 9 alone for cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen fermentation demonstrates that particular metabolites generated in the initial phase of fermentation inhibited X 9 activity. Strain X 9 needed 5h to adapt to the environment to begin hydrolyzing cellulose. Rapid removal of reduced sugar formed by strain B 49 may help remove the phase lag from possible inhibition effects on X 9 by hydrolyzed reduced sugars. Additionally, as X 9 hydrolyzed more cellulose in the presence of B 49 as compared with the mono-culture test, acetate and butyrate around 1800 – 2000 mg l - 1 may inhibit the growth of X 9 . The two strains work together to yield hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose."
11,Conclusions,"This study produced directly biohydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose using dark fermentation. Three strains isolated from a hydrogen-producing reactor were found to have high biohydrogen yield from microcrystalline cellulose. One strain that exhibited the highest hydrogen yield among the three tested isolates was identified as C. acetobutylicum X 9 . At 37 ∘ C and pH 5.0, the mono-culture tests with X 9 revealed that principal cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen production occurred with a 5-h time lag. The cellulose was then promptly hydrolyzed and hydrogen was produced primarily in the following 3–6 h. The corresponding hydrogen yield, maximum hydrogen production rate, and cellulose hydrolysis ratio reached 755 ml l - 1 medium, 6.4 mmol H 2 h - 1 g - 1 dry cell, and 68.3%, respectively. Equivalently, the hydrogen yield was 3.6 mmol H 2 g - 1 cellulose. The end liquid products were primarily acetate and butyrate. The co-culture of C. acetobutylicum X 9 with strain E. harbinense B 49 , which can produce hydrogen efficiently from monosaccharides but directly from microcrystalline cellulose, yielded hydrogen immediately following initiation of fermentation. The hydrogen yield, maximum hydrogen production rate, and cellulose hydrolysis ratio of 1810 ml l - 1 medium, 55.4 mmol H 2 h - 1 g - 1 dry cell, and 77.6%, respectively, were achieved. The corresponding end liquid products were acetate, ethanol, and butyrate. The equivalent hydrogen yield reached 8.1 mmol H 2 g - 1 cellulose. This yield is the highest amongst those reported in literature to produce hydrogen from cellulose materials. The strain B 49 rapidly removed reduced sugar produced by cellulose hydrolysis by X 9 , hence improved cellulose hydrolysis and subsequent hydrogen production rates."
