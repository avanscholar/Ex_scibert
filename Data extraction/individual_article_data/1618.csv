0,Introduction,"Nitropyrazole has drawn renewed attention by explosive chemists due to its positive heat of formation, good thermal stability, and higher density. 4-nitropyrazole (4-NP, C3H3O2N3, 113.07, Fig. 1 ), which is a pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate and an essential intermediate for the synthesis of nitropyrazole energetic compounds, is a white crystal with the crystal density of 1.52 g·cm−3, melting point of 163 ~ 165 ℃, corresponding detonation velocity of 6860 m·s−1, and explosion pressure of 18.81 GPa [1]. It is difficult to continue the C nitration of 4-NP. After N nitration, 1,4-dinitropyrazole can be synthesized, and 3,4-dinitropyrazole and 3,5-dinitropyrazole can be obtained by rearrangement. Further nitration of 4-NP can give 3,4,5-trinitropyrazole. 4-NP can obtain more nitropyrazole derivatives through other substitution reactions. Besides, 4-NP is also used as raw material to synthesize 4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazole, which is a very useful intermediate for the preparation of trinitropyrazole. To the best of our knowledge, many studies have focused on the synthesis of 4-NP while only a few have attempted to establish purification methods to obtain products with high purity. Crystallization is a very valuable procedure for purity, acidity, and particle size of 4-NP. The process of crystallization is complex and contains multiphase heat and mass transfer processes. Because temperature is a critical factor, the choice of temperature range is particularly important. Additionally, the solubility data of 4-NP is incomplete, making the subsequent crystallization has some limitations. Therefore, through a large number of experiments in the laboratory, a lot of mixed solvent data for the future of industrial production has laid a certain foundation. The determination of the solubility of 4-NP makes the crystallization becoming time-saving and convenient in the industry. To date, due to few data on the solubility of 4-NP, this work has become more significant. In the paper, since 4-NP can be dissolved in n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol, and is slightly soluble in water; water is selected as anti-solvent since it is inexpensive and can be dissolved in organic solvents in any proportion [2,3]. In the paper, a gravimetric method [4,5] was chosen to determine the solubility of 4-NP in water + n-butanol, water + n-pentanol, water + isobutanol, and water + isoamyl alcohol at T = (288.15, 293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15, 313.15, 318.15, 323.15, 328.15) K under atmospheric pressure of 0.1 MPa. To expand the applicability of the solubility, the data of 4-NP in four binary solvents were correlated by the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, CNIBS/R-K model, and Wilson model, leading to a satisfactory fitting result. The impacts of temperature and mass-fraction of water on the solubility were discussed. Hansen solubility parameters of 4-NP and mixed binary solvents were applied to investigate the dissolution behavior. Besides, the thermodynamic properties of the dissolution process were calculated and discussed from the measured solubility values by using the Wilson model to further understand the solubility. Furthermore, solid–liquid surface tension and surface entropy factor of 4-NP were presented. From the experimental data, it is extremely convenient to select the most suitable solvent for 4-NP in the crystallization process."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemical materials,"2.1 Chemical materials 4-NP is obtained by rearrangement of 1-nitropyrazole by our own laboratory [1], and the synthetic route is showed in Fig. 2 . It was purified by crystallization in diethyl ether/n-hexane. Its mass fraction purity, measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), was 0.990. All solvents used in this experiment such as n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol were analytic reagent grade without further purification. Distilled water (resistivity = 18.2 MΩ·cm), which was made in our laboratory by the NANOPURE system from BARNSTEAD (Thermo Scientific Co., China), was used throughout. More information on all the materials used in this experiment is presented in Table 1 ."
3,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.2 Differential scanning calorimetry The melting temperature T m and fusion enthalpy ΔfusH were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC, type SDT Q600, American TA Co.) under the protection of nitrogen. In this experiment, the heating rate is 5 K·min−1 under the protection of nitrogen, and the flow rate is 100 mL·min−1. The standard uncertainties of the measurement were a temperature of 0.5 K and a fusion enthalpy of 400 J·mol−1."
4,X-ray diffraction,"2.3 X-ray diffraction To investigate whether solvation or crystalline transformation occurred during the dissolution process in this experiment, XRD equipment Bruker D8 Advance (Bruker Corporation, Germany) was employed to determine the crystalline properties of raw and recovered equilibrated 4-NP. Samples were measured under conditions: 2θ range of 0–50°, scanning speed of 10°·min−1, electric current of 40 mA, and voltage of 45 kV."
5,Solubility measurements,"2.4 Solubility measurements The solubility data of 4-NP in four different binary solvents was measured by a gravimetric method. Experimental apparatus includes a water bath controlled by a thermostat (type 501, China) with an uncertainty of 0.05 K, a 100 mL jacketed glass vessel (customized through the glasswork), an analytical balance (type AB 204, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) with an accuracy of 0.0001 g, and a magnetic stirrer. First, the solvents about 70 mL which were prepared before the measured solubility and 4-NP were put into the glass bottle. In the mixing process, we can always see solid particles in the glass bottle. The 4-NP is determined to be excessive. Second, a continuous stirring rate of 80 rpm was taken at least for 8 h to reach the solid–liquid equilibrium. The stirring was stopped after 8 h. The solubility measurements were conducted at the temperatures of 288.15 K, 293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K, 313.15 K, 318.15 K, 323.15 K, and 328.15 K to obtain sufficient data used in the following model calculations. Third, the clear upper saturated solution was extracted with a pipette to the pan and weighed immediately. At last, the pan was placed into the vacuum drying oven at T = 313.15 K and p = 0.1 MPa until the weight was no longer change. The final experimental values should be the average of the three experiments. Solubility of 4-NP (x 1) in four binary solvents could be expressed as: (1) x 1 = m 1 / M 1 m 1 / M 1 + m 2 / M 2 + m 3 / M 3 (2) w 1 = m 2 m 2 + m 3 where x 1 denotes the solubility of 4-NP in the binary system; w 1 represents the mass fraction of water in binary solvent mixtures; m 1, m 2, m 3 are the mass of 4-NP, water, and organic solvents, respectively; M 1, M 2, M 3 are the molar mass of 4-NP, water, and organic solvents, respectively."
6,Hansen solubility parameter,"2.5 Hansen solubility parameter The concept of the Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) has been widely used to select suitable solvents for solute [6]. The basis of the HSP approach is to assume that the total cohesive energy (E t) of a pure compound consists of three parts (nonpolar (dispersion) interactions (E d), polar (dipole–dipole and dipole-induced dipole) interactions (E p), and hydrogen bonding), or other specific association interactions (Lewis acid-base interactions (E h)): (3) E t = E d + E p + E h Dividing each contribution by the molar volume: (4) E t V = E d V + E p V + E h V = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 Therefore, the total solubility parameter (δ t) can be expressed as: (5) δ t = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 where δ d, δ p and δ H represent the Hansen dispersion solubility parameter, polar solubility parameter and hydrogen bonding solubility parameter, respectively. The values of δd, δ p and δ H for selected solvents can be obtained from the literature [6]. The solubility parameter for binary solvents (δ mix) can be expressed as: [7] (6) δ mix = α δ 1 + ( 1 - α ) δ 2 where α stands for the volume fraction of solvent 1 (water); δ 1 and δ 2 indicate the Hansen solubility parameters of solvent 1 (water) and solvent 2 (n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol). The group contribution (Hoftyzer-Van Krevelen) method was used to calculate the values of δ d, δ p and δ h of 4-NP [8]. The molar volume of 4-NP, Vs = 61.5 cm3·mol−1, was taken from the SciFinder database [9]. The difference of total solubility parameter between solute and solvent (Δδ t) can be used to estimate the miscibility of two compounds: [10] (7) Δ δ t = δ t 2 - δ t 1 where δ t1 and δ t2 are total Hansen solubility parameters of solute and binary solvents, respectively."
7,Solubility models,"Since (solid + liquid) equilibrium is usually not available, correlation and prediction schemes are frequently utilized. The modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, CNIBS/R-K model and Wilson model are employed to correlate the experimental values. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of four binary solvents is used to evaluate the fitting results of the correlation models. The RMSD is defined as: (8) RMSD = ∑ i = 1 n x c - x e 2 N 1 / 2 where xe and xc denote experimental data and the calculated values, respectively, and N is the number of experimental data."
8,The modified Apelblat equation,"3.1 The modified Apelblat equation The temperature and solubility of 4-NP were correlated by the modified Apelblat equation [11–13]. It is simple and commonly to be written as follows: (9) ln x 1 = A + B T + C ln T where A, B, C are the empirical constants and T is the absolute temperature. The values of A and B reflect the variation of the activity coefficient, the value of C represents the temperature effect upon the fusion enthalpy, which is a deviation of heat capacity (ΔCp) [14,15]. The values of model parameters A, B, C and 104RMSD are presented in Table 3 ."
9,Jouyban-Acree model,"3.2 Jouyban-Acree model The Jouyban-Acree model [16,17] is a semi-empirical thermodynamic model widely used to correlate the relationship between both temperature and solvent composition with solubility. The equation can be expressed as: (10) ln x 1 = x 2 ln x 1 2 + x 3 ln x 1 3 + x 2 x 3 ∑ i = 0 2 J i x 2 - x 3 i T where J i denotes the model constant. To extend the application of the temperature ranges where non-linear solubility behavior is observed, Jouyban et al., proposed a combination of the Jouyban-Acree model and the modified Apelblat equation to correlate the solubility of a solute in binary solvent mixtures at different temperatures. According to the modified Apelblat equation, ln(x 1)2 and ln(x 1)3 can be expressed by Eqs. (11) and (12): (11) ln x 1 2 = A 2 + B 2 / T + C 2 ln T (12) ln x 1 3 = A 3 + B 3 / T + C 3 ln T Put x 3 = 1 - x 2 into Eq.(10), a new equation can be obtained: (13) ln x 1 = A 2 + B 2 / T + C 2 ln T + A 2 - A 3 x 2 + B 2 - B 3 + J 0 - J 1 + J 2 x 2 T + 3 J 1 - J 0 - 5 J 2 x 2 2 T + 8 J 2 - 2 J 1 x 2 3 T + - 4 J 2 x 2 4 T + C 2 - C 3 x 2 ln T When introducing constant term, Eq. (13) can be further simplified as Eq. (14): (14) ln x 1 = A 1 + A 2 / T + A 3 ln T + A 4 x 2 + A 5 x 2 / T + A 6 x 2 2 / T + A 7 x 2 3 / T + A 8 x 2 4 / T + A 9 x 2 ln T where A 1-A 9 are empirical model parameters; x 2 represents the mole fraction of water in mixed solvents. Table 4 contains the model parameters and 104RMSD."
10,CNIBS/R-K model,"3.3 CNIBS/R-K model The CNIBS/R-K equation, which was proposed by Acree [18], is suitable for binary mixed systems. It is mainly used to describe the relationship between the solubility and the composition of mixed solvents when the temperature is constant [19], which can be expressed as follows: (15) ln x 1 = x 2 ln x 1 2 + x 3 ln x 1 3 + x 2 x 3 ∑ i = 1 N S i x 2 - x 3 i where x 2 and x 3 represent the initial mole fraction composition of water + (n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol) in the mixed solvent mixtures, respectively; (x 1)2 and (x 1)3 indicate the mole fraction solubility of 4-NP in pure water and (n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol), respectively; S i denotes the model constant, and N is the number of solvents. For binary solvent mixtures, N = 2 and x 3 = 1- x 2, the formula can be simplified as: (16) ln x 1 = B 0 + B 1 x 2 + B 2 x 2 2 + B 3 x 2 3 + B 4 x 2 4 where B 0, B 1, B 2, B 3 and B 4 are the model parameters. The values of model parameters B 0, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4 and 104RMSD are presented in Table 5 ."
11,Wilson model,"3.4 Wilson model The Wilson model based on the Flory-Huggins non-thermal mixture expression has been widely used for correlating solubility data. The expression of the Wilson model for ternary mixtures could be expressed as: [20,21] (17) g E RT = - ∑ i = 1 3 x i ln ( ∑ j = 1 3 x j Λ ij ) where gE stands for the excess Gibbs energy; Λij and Λij are adjustable parameters of Wilson model and can be estimated by corresponding molar volumes of pure-component (νi and νj ) and characteristic energy differences (Δλij and Δλji ): (18) Λ ij = v j v i exp ( - λ ij - λ ii RT ) = v j v i exp ( - Δ λ ij RT ) (19) Λ ji = v i v j exp ( - λ ji - λ jj RT ) = v i v j exp ( - Δ λ ji RT ) Table 6 contains the model parameters and 104RMSD."
12,Results and discussion,
13,DSC analysis,"4.1 DSC analysis The DSC plot of 4-NP is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The result demonstrated that the melting point and the fusion enthalpy are 435.85 K and 15.18 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The melting temperature is closed to 436.15–438.15 K [1], indicating that the tested value is reliable."
14,XRD analysis,"4.2 XRD analysis The representative XRD patterns of 4-NP in binary solvents are exhibited graphically in Fig. 4 . As revealed from Fig. 4, no polymorph transformation of 4-NP in binary solvent mixtures we measured is identified."
15,Solubility results,"4.3 Solubility results Experimental and calculated mole fraction solubility of 4-NP in four binary solvents were presented in Table 2 and Figs. 5–8 . From Table 2 and Figs. 5–8, we can clearly observe that the calculated data are close to the experimental values, and the data are successfully correlated by four equations. In all graphs, the curves are through all experimental points. Moreover, the solubility of 4-NP is the function of temperature and increases with the increasing temperature at constant solvent composition in all binary solvent mixtures and decreases with the increasing mass-fraction of water at any given temperature, suggesting that cooling crystallization by using the above solvents is appropriate for crystallization of 4-NP. Generally, the dissolving capacity of 4-NP in the binary solvent mixtures at constant temperature ranked as (water + n-butanol) > (water + n-pentanol) > (water + isoamyl alcohol) > (water + isobutanol). The phenomenon could be explained by the ‘like dissolves like’ rule [22] that the solubility of materials is highly related to the similarities between the solute and the solvents. The polarity of the various solvents follows the order of n-butanol (60.2) > n-pentanol (56.8) > isoamyl alcohol (56.5) > isobutanol (55.2) [23], and 4-NP is a polar molecule. Thus, it can be easily dissolved in polar protic solvents, which is consistent which the solubility data. According to Mullin [24], in polar protic solvents, the solvent molecules interact by forming strong hydrogen bonds. To dissolve, the solute must break these bonds and replace them with bonds of similar strength. As displayed in Fig. 1, 4-NP is a five-membered ring structure. Since –NO2 is an electron-withdrawing group, the electron cloud density of the H atoms on N is reduced, and the 4-NP molecule exhibits the N-H hydrogen bonding donor group, demonstrating that a hydrogen bond can be formed between the 4-NP and solvent molecules. As a result, there are both van der Waals interactions (represented by polarity) and hydrogen bonds (represented by hydrogen bond donor and acceptor for propensity), inducing the solute–solvent interaction [25]. Therefore, the solubility increases with the increasing mole fraction of alcohols. With the increasing mass-fraction of water, the interaction of water and the organic solvent is weakened. Consequently, the solubility of 4-NP decreases with the increasing mass-fraction of water in the determined temperature. Generally, polarity mainly influences the strength of solute–solvent Van der Waals interactions while hydrogen-bonding may play an essential role in the solute–solvent interactions. For instance, a similar phenomenon has been revealed in other compounds, such as EA [26], CNP [27], and FM [28]. Apparently, dissolution is a complex process, and polarity is not the unique factor affecting it. Many factors (e.g., molecular geometry, molecule polarity, molecule size, solute–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions, dielectric constant, ionization constant [29], and surface tension of different solvents) might affect the solute solubility dissolved in a solvent. A similar phenomenon was identified by the solubility measurement of other compounds (e.g., sorbic acid [30] and sulbactam [31]). When the temperature is changed from 288.15 K to 328.15 K, the maximum increased solubility of 4-NP in each mixed solvents (water + n-butanol), (water + n-pentanol), (water + isoamyl alcohol) and (water + isobutanol) with different mass fraction of water are 378.02 % (w 1 = 0.9000), 428.752 % (w 1 = 0.9000), 504.36 % (w 1 = 0.9000) and 537.45 % (w 1 = 0.9000), respectively. The Hansen solubility parameters (δ d, δ p, δ h, δ t and Δδ t) of four binary systems and 4-NP are listed in Table SI.1. As indicated in Table SI.1, values of δ t for isobutanol and n-butanol are mainly contributed by δ h. However, values of δ t for n-pentanol and isoamyl alcohol are mainly contributed by δ d. It demonstrates that the major forces of isobutanol and n-butanol differ from theses of n-pentanol and isoamyl alcohol. Additionally, values of Δδ t between 4-NP and binary solvents (water + n-butanol, n-pentanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol) first decrease and then increase as the mass fraction of water increases. For four binary solvents, the difference in δ d between mixed solvent and 4-NP reduces as the mass fraction of water decreases. Hence, the solubility of 4-NP increases with the decrease in the mass fraction of water. Moreover, the values of the Hildebrand solubility parameter δ h increase and the solubility of 4-NP decreases with the increasing content of water."
16,Solubility data correlation,"4.4 Solubility data correlation Experimental 4-NP solubility in four binary solvents was correlated with four models (the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, CNIBS/R-K model, and Wilson model). To find a more appropriate equation to describe 4-NP dissolution behavior, RMSD was used to compare fitting accuracy. As observed from Tables 3–6, the average values of 104RMSD of selected four models: the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, CNIBS/R-K model, and Wilson model of 1.87, 31.83, 6.04, and 1.18, respectively. Besides, the average values R2 of 4-NP within the experimental temperature range of these equations are 0.9998 (the modified Apelblat equation), 0.9758 (Jouyban-Acree model), 0.9989 (CNIBS/R-K model), and 0.9999 (Wilson model). The values of R2 and 104RMSD indicated that all four equations can present a satisfactory fitting result in the mixed solvents and are well correlated with experimental data of 4-NP. By comparing the data of 104RMSD and R2, it can be concluded that the correlation between solubility and temperature goodness order is Wilson model > modified Apelblat equation > CNIBS/R-K model > Jouyban-Acree model, reflecting that the Wilson model correlated the relationship between equilibrium solubility and temperature is more suitable for equation research, solvent selection, and fitting the solubility values of 4-NP in the binary systems than other three models. The results mentioned above suggest that the fitted models and the values of solubility in this study lay a certain foundation for the crystallization process of 4-NP in the future."
17,Thermodynamic properties,
18,Thermodynamic function,"5.1 Thermodynamic function For a non-ideal solution, it is necessary to study the mixing thermodynamic properties of the solute in different binary solvent mixtures, such as the mixing enthalpy, the mixing Gibbs energy and the mixing entropy. The mixing properties can be calculated by the following equations [32]. (20) Δ mix G = G E + Δ mix G id (21) Δ mix H = H E + Δ mix H id (22) Δ mix S = S E + Δ mix S id where GE and Δ mixGid , SE and Δ mixSid , HE and Δ mixHid denote the excess properties and mixing properties of ideal systems. The mixing thermodynamic properties of the ideal solution can be calculated by the following equations [33]. (23) Δ mix G id = R T ∑ i n x i ln x i (24) Δ mix H id = 0 (25) Δ mix S id = - R ∑ i n x i ln x i where x i xi and γ i represent the mole fraction and activity coefficient of component i in real solution, respectively; i = 2 and i = 3 indicate a binary solution and a ternary solution, respectively. In addition, the activity coefficient can be calculated by the given Wilson model. The excess mixing properties can be calculated by the following equations. (26) G E = R T ∑ i n x i ln γ i (27) H E = - R T 2 ∑ i n x i ∂ ln γ i ∂ T P , x (28) S E = H E - G E T Eqs. (29) and (30) [34] can be applied to the comparison of the relative contribution to the mixing Gibbs energy by mixing enthalpy and mixing entropy in the solution process. (29) % ζ H = Δ mix H Δ mix H + T m Δ mix S × 100 (30) % ζ S = T Δ mix S Δ mix H + T Δ mix S × 100 The calculated mixing thermodynamic properties, %ζH and %ζS of the dissolution process in four binary mixtures within the experimental temperature range (288.15–328.15 K), are summarized in Table SI.2. According to the values of Table SI.2, the data of ΔmixH is negative in all binary solvents, suggesting that the dissolution of 4-NP is an exothermic process. Besides, the values of ΔmixS in all tested solvents are positive, demonstrating that the process is entropy-driven. Moreover, the data of ΔmixG are all negative, reflecting that the mixing process is favorable and spontaneous. Briefly, these results are helpful for the optimization and crystallization processes of 4-NP. Additionally, the values of %ζS are higher than %ζH in each component of different binary solvents at a given temperature, indicating that the contribution of dissolution mixing entropy to the mixing Gibbs energy is greater than dissolution mixing enthalpy."
19,The surface tension and surface entropy factor,"5.2 The surface tension and surface entropy factor Solid-liquid surface tension is the main physical quantity representing the physical properties of the crystal. The acquisition of surface tension not only makes it possible to predict the nucleation behavior but also promotes an in-depth understanding of the nucleation theory. Moreover, the solid–liquid surface tension largely determines the growth mechanism of the crystal. Therefore, it is necessary to study the surface tension of solid–liquid. The surface tension theory calculation model was a simple computational model derived from Mersmann [35]. It is expressed as (31) γ = 0.414 k T ρ c N A 2 3 ln ρ c C eq where γ represents the solid–liquid surface tension; N A and k denote the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol−1) and Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K), respectively; ρ c and C eq indicate the density of 4-NP and the solubility of 4-NP, respectively; T refers to the absolute temperature. The surface entropy factor is a parameter used to characterize the smoothness of the crystal surface at the atomic level. Barata et al. [36] used the solid surface tension, molecular volume and temperature of the crystal to approximate the surface entropy factor and the equation can be expressed as follows: (32) f = 4 V 2 3 γ kT where f is the surface entropy factor; V represents molecular volume and is can be defined as: (33) V = M ρ c N A × 10 - 6 where M denotes the molecular weight of 4-NP. The values of γ and f are displayed in Table SI.3. As observed from Table SI.3, the surface tension and surface entropy factor of 4-NP are consistent in the mixed system at constant solvent. The higher the water content in the binary mixed solvent, the larger the surface tension of the crystal, the higher the surface energy, and the slower the crystal growth. As the temperature increases, the surface tension decreases, indicating that the higher the temperature, the more intense the molecular motion, and the faster the growth. The same phenomenon is that the surface entropy factor decreases with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the surface entropy factor increases with the increasing mass-fraction of water content in the binary mixed solvent. The greater the surface entropy factor, the higher the growth energy barrier, and the slower the crystal growth."
20,Conclusions,"The solubility of 4-NP in four binary mixed solvents such as water + n-butanol, water + n-pentanol, water + isobutanol, and water + isoamyl alcohol was investigated by a gravimetric method in the temperature range from 288.15 K to 328.15 K under 0.1 MPa. Experimental solubility increases with the increasing temperature at given solvent composition and increases with the decreasing mass fraction of water at a constant temperature. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) were used to explain and predict the solubility behavior. Additionally, four correlation models (i.e., the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, CNIBS/R-K model, and Wilson model) selected in this study can all be used to fit the solubility values of 4-NP precisely. Moreover, all of the 324 experimental values are used to correlate the parameters of the Wilson model. The correlated results are superior to the other three models regarding the average 104RMSD and R2. The mixing properties of 4-NP in selected binary solvents, including mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, and mixing Gibbs energy, were studied based on solubility data and the Wilson model. The results demonstrate that the dissolution process of 4-NP in selected binary solvents is spontaneous and entropy-driven, and the mixing process in most solvents is exothermic. Solid-liquid surface tension γ and surface entropy factor f of 4-NP were obtained. The surface tension and the surface entropy factor increase with the increasing content of water in the mixed solvents. Furthermore, the solubility data and correlation results are of great significance for choosing a suitable solvent in the purification process of 4-NP on an industrial scale and for further theoretical studies."
