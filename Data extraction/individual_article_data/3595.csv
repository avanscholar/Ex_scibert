0,Introduction,"Conventional fast pyrolysis of biomass is a non-selective thermochemical conversion process that generates a complex liquid product known as bio-oil [1–3]. Crude bio-oil consists of water and hundreds of organic compounds, most of which are in very low concentrations, bringing great difficulties to the separation of specific compounds [4–6]. To improve the biomass pyrolysis selectivity, suitable biomass materials and proper catalysts can be used to selectively control the biomass pyrolysis process towards specific target products, known as selective pyrolysis of biomass [7–10]. As a result, specific bio-oils rich in different target compounds could be obtained, which will facilitate the application of bio-oil for isolation of valuable compounds. Biomass type has a fundamental influence on the pyrolytic product distribution [11]. Currently, various biomass materials have been employed for fast pyrolysis studies. Qu et al. [12] firstly reported selective preparation of 4-vinyl phenol (4-VP) from pyrolysis of certain herbaceous biomass (bagasse, bamboo and corn stalk) under low temperature (about 300 °C) conditions. Herbaceous biomass, especially sugarcane bagasse, contains a great amount of esterified p-coumaric acid, which can decompose to form 4-VP during low-temperature pyrolysis process. 4-VP is a valuable phenolic compound that can be used as food spice, pharmaceutical intermediate and so on. Based on this work, a novel catalytic pyrolysis technique was developed to selectively prepare 4-ethyl phenol (4-EP) via catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse with Pd/SBA-15 catalyst. 4-EP is a hydrogenated product of 4-VP and also a high value-added phenolic compound widely used in organic synthesis [13,14]. Due to the promising catalytic hydrogenation capability of the Pd/SBA-15 catalyst, the 4-EP yield was up to 2.0 wt% under the optimal catalytic pyrolysis condition [15]. However, given the high cost of noble-based catalyst, this technique is difficult to be widely used in commercial production. Our recent work confirmed that activated carbon (AC) could be an effective catalyst to replace Pd/SBA-15 for the selective preparation of 4-EP from catalytic pyrolysis of bagasse [16]. AC is a common, cheap, stable and environmental friendly catalyst [17,18]. It also exhibited good hydrogenation capability which could saturate the olefin bond in 4-VP or its precursors (mainly p-coumaric acid) to form 4-EP. The results showed that with bagasse as feedstock, the maximal yield of 4-EP could achieve 2.49 wt% from the AC catalyst, higher than that of 2.0 wt% from Pd/SAB-15 catalyst. However, the conversion of 4-EP precursors into 4-EP was still low. According to the 4-VP yield in the non-catalytic process and the 4-EP yield in the catalytic process, the conversion of 4-VP to 4-EP was lower than 50% (mol/mol), indicating that the 4-EP precursors could not be efficiently converted into 4-EP in the present catalytic pyrolysis process [16]. Therefore, how to increase the 4-EP yield and selectivity is an important issue for the industrial application of this technique. In this study, a new way was proposed to increase the 4-EP yield and selectivity from catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse by using a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalysts adopted for this technique were four AC catalysts prepared via different activation methods, and the commercial AC catalyst was employed for comparison. Hydrogen is widely used as a hydrogen donor in biomass and petrochemical industries for catalytic hydrogenation reactions [19–22]. The comparative experiments under a hydrogen atmosphere and an inert atmosphere indicated that the addition of hydrogen would enhance the hydrogenation reaction to facilitate the formation of 4-EP, and thus, significantly increasing 4-EP yield and selectivity. Moreover, the biomass pyrolytic gas which also contains H2 could be recycled as a hydrogen source. Lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments were performed to determine the effects of atmosphere, AC catalysts and pyrolysis conditions on the selective production of 4-EP."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sugarcane bagasse used in this study was collected from Guangxi Province of China. Prior to experiments, the bagasse was dried and ground. Particles with the size of 0.1-0.2 mm were selected for experiments. The elemental composition of the bagasse on the dry basis was analyzed by a vario MACRO cube elemental analyzer to be 48.6 wt% C, 6.0 wt% H, 0.3 wt% N, 0.2 wt% S and 41.7 wt% O. Composition analysis was conducted according to ASTM E1758-01, and determined as 44.0 wt% cellulose, 28.9 wt% hemicellulose, 19.9 wt% lignin, 4.0 wt% extractive and 3.2 wt% ash. Industrial analysis based on GB/T 28731-2012 was performed to determine the volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash on the dry basis as 80.4 wt%, 17.8 wt% and 1.8 wt%, respectively. The 4-EP (99%) was purchased from Aladdin. The 4-VP (10% in propylene glycol solution) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The commercial activated carbon (AC-C) was purchased from Sinopharm. In addition, four AC catalysts were prepared from rice husk in the laboratory via different activation methods."
3,Preparation of ACs via different activation methods,"2.2 Preparation of ACs via different activation methods Four ACs were prepared with rice husk as the carbon source via different activation methods, i.e., physical activation with H2O and CO2, as well as chemical activation with KOH and ZnCl2. The four ACs are referred to as AC-H2O, AC-CO2, AC-K and AC-Zn corresponding to the activation with H2O, CO2, KOH and ZnCl2, respectively. To prepare AC-H2O, 20 g of rice husk was first pyrolyzed at 500 °C for 1 h with heating from room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min under N2 flow (500 ml/min), and then cooled down to obtain rice husk char. Afterwards, steam activation was conducted with first heating of the rice husk char to 800 °C in N2 flow (500 ml/min), followed with activation by the addition of H2O (0.25 ml/min at liquid phase, contacting with AC along with the carrier gas after vaporization) for 2 h, to finally obtain AC-H2O after cooling down in N2 atmosphere. AC-CO2 was prepared in a similar way as AC-H2O. Rice husk char was first heated to 800 °C under N2 gas flow (100 ml/min), and then activated for 2 h in CO2 atmosphere (100 ml/min). AC-CO2 was finally obtained after cooling down in N2 atmosphere. To prepare AC-K, 20 g of rice husk was impregnated with a potassium hydroxide solution (20 wt% concentration) with stirring for 5 h. The mass ratio of rice husk and KOH solution was 1:5. The pretreated rice husk was dried, heated up to 400 °C with a heating rate of 8 °C/min and carbonized for 0.5 h in N2 flow (250 ml/min), and then heated up to 710 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and activated for 1 h in N2 flow (250 ml/min). Finally, the activated sample was cooled down to room temperature in the N2 flow, washed with deionized water to neutral, dried at 110 °C for 10 h to obtain AC-K. To prepare AC-Zn, 20 g of rice husk was first impregnated with a zinc chloride solution (9.1 wt% concentration) with stirring for 6 h. The mass ratio of rice husk and ZnCl2 solution was 1:33. The impregnated rice husk was dried, heated at a rate of 5 °C/min to 700 °C and activated at 700 °C for 1.5 h under N2 flow (100 ml/min). After cooling down to the room temperature in N2 flow, the activated sample was washed with 0.5 N HCl solution followed by hot deionized water until the pH of solution was 6, dried at 110 °C for 10 h to obtain AC-Zn."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized by textural property analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS analyses were performed using a 5700C model Physical Electronics apparatus, with Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). For the analysis of the XPS peaks, the C 1 s peak position was set at 284.5 eV and used as reference to position the other peaks. The fitting of the XPS peaks was achieved by least squares using Gaussian-Lorentzian peak shapes. The textural properties were analyzed by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K, measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. The surface areas were determined using the Barrett-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore volumes and pore size distribution were determined by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch of the isotherms. The pH values were determined using a pH meter (Mettler Toledo, EL20). 0.5 g AC was added into 20 mL deionized water, which was then slowly heated to boil for 3 min. The evaporated water was supplemented, and the mixture was filtered. The initial 5 mL filtrate was discarded. After the remained filtrate cooling down to room temperature, the pH values were determined and recorded."
5,Lab-scale fast pyrolysis experiments,"2.4 Lab-scale fast pyrolysis experiments The catalytic pyrolysis of bagasse was carried out on a lab-scale pyrolysis reactor, with the experimental setup shown in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S1). Three different carrier gases were used in the experiments, i.e., nitrogen, hydrogen (6.00% hydrogen, with 94% argon as the shielding gas), and mixed gas (4.00% H2, 17.01% CO, 14.95% CO2, 6.06% CH4, helium as the shielding gas), with a flow rate of 100 mL/min. The feeding time was 30 min and strictly controlled to ensure the temperature change within the reactor being less than 3 °C. The bagasse and AC were mixed and mechanically stirred for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous mixture, then stored in the container and fed into the pyrolysis reactor in the carrier gas. The quartz reactor was vertically placed in a tubular heating furnace that was capable of heating up to the reaction temperature. A certain amount of quartz wool was placed in the middle of the quartz reactor to support the feedstock and collect the char, preventing solid particles entering the condensing unit. The pyrolysis vapors entered the condensing device which was cooled with a mixture of ice and water to collect liquid products, and then the incondensable gases were collected by a gas bag. The bagasse quantity was strict to be 3.0 g in each experiment, and the AC quantity was varied (0 g, 0.3 g, 1.5 g, 3.0 g, 4.5 g, 6.0 g or 12.0 g) to ensure the AC-to-bagasse ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 4, respectively. During each test, the bagasse and AC were mechanically mixed and stored in the container. The gas flow rate was maintained at 100 mL/min. When the quartz reactor reached the desired temperature, the feedstock was injected slowly into the quartz reactor in a feeding rate of 0.1 g/min to ensure the temperature varying within ± 3 °C. After the feeding process, the reactor temperature was maintained for 5 min. The experiments were conducted in the temperature of 270–420 °C. After the experiment, the quartz reactor was removed from the heating furnace and cooled to room temperature with N2. Solid product was then collected and weighed. The char yield could be calculated by subtraction of the AC quantity from the total solid product. The liquid was collected by the condenser, and its yield was obtained based on the mass discrepancy of the condenser before and after the experiment. The gas yield was then calculated by the mass difference based on the yields of char and liquid products."
6,Recycling experiments,"2.5 Recycling experiments The AC catalysts prepared above were fine powders. To conduct the recycling experiments, the AC-H2O powder was further shaped to increase the particle size, named as AC-H2O-R. Since the AC-H2O powder could not be shaped through direct pressing, organic adhesive carboxymethyl cellulose was used for preparing AC-H2O-R. Powder AC-H2O and carboxymethyl cellulose (40/60, w/w) were mechanically mixed, and then added into deionized water and stirred for 30 min. After drying at 120 °C for 12 h, the solid was calcined for 2 h at 400 °C under N2 flow (100 mL/min). The obtained solid was then ground, and particles within 0.25-0.40 mm were selected for recycling experiments. Due to the size difference between AC-H2O-R and bagasse, the catalyst could be easily recovered through a sieve. After each pyrolytic experiments, the AC-H2O-R catalyst was collected and directly used for a next run. Three consecutive runs were performed, and the pyrolytic products in each run were collected and analyzed."
7,Analysis of the pyrolytic liquid products,"2.6 Analysis of the pyrolytic liquid products The pyrolytic liquid products from different reaction conditions were not always homogeneous. Hence, a certain amount of absolute ethyl alcohol was added to the condenser and mixed with the pyrolytic liquid to make a homogeneous liquid for further analysis [16]. The water content in the pretreated homogeneous liquid was measured by Karl-Fischer method [23] with a mixed solution of methanol and methylene chloride at a mass ratio of 3:1. The water content in the original pyrolytic liquid product could then be calculated. In addition, the chemical composition of the homogeneous liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Perkin Elmer, Clarus 560). The GC oven was kept at 40 °C for 2 min, then heated with a rate of 15 °C/min to 280 °C, and finally kept at 280 °C for another 2 min. The detected products were determined based on NIST, Wiley Library and previous studies [16,24,25]. Since 4-EP was the target product in this study, quantitative determination of its yield was performed using an external standard method. Different amounts of pure 4-EP were directly subjected to GC/MS to record its peak area values. Hence, a straight line was obtained in terms of the 4-EP quantity and its chromatographic peak area, as shown in the Supplementary material (Fig. S2). Based on this calibration line, actual 4-EP yield from different pyrolysis conditions could be calculated. In addition, quantitative analysis for 4-VP was conducted in the same way with corresponding calibration line shown in Fig. S2."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst properties,"3.1 Catalyst properties XPS characterization was conducted to analyze the chemical properties of the AC catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 , distinct peaks for C and O were detected for all the tested AC catalysts. The contents of C and O were also presented, based on which the C/O atomic ratios were calculated as 12.2 (AC-H2O), 11.1 (AC-C), 4.7 (AC-CO2), 5.4 (AC-KOH), and 5.9 (AC-Zn), respectively. This indicated that during the steam activation process, the oxygen content was greatly reduced to form AC-H2O catalyst with the highest C/O atomic ratio among the five AC catalysts. In addition, XPS C1 s and O1 s spectra of AC catalysts are shown in the Supplementary Material (Figs. S3, S4). According to Fig. S3, carbon existed in different forms, i.e., graphitic carbon (284.6 eV), sp3 carbon (284.9 eV), CO (carbon in alcohol and ether, 285.5 eV) and CO (carbon in carboxyl and ester groups, 289.3 eV) [26,27]. Based on Fig. S4, oxygen in AC catalysts was identified as O in carbonyl groups (531.7 eV), O in hydroxyl and ether groups (532.6 eV), and O in carboxyl and ester groups (533.7 eV) [26,27]. The relative contents of different types of C and O are listed in the Supplementary material (Table S1). In addition, metal elements were also detected in AC-KOH and AC-Zn, with the content of K or Zn being determined less than 2%. The textural properties of the AC catalysts are listed in Table S2. Compared with the commercial AC-C catalyst, other catalysts had lower BET surface areas and lower pore volumes. Among the four catalysts prepared in lab, AC-H2O from steam activation had the largest BET surface area (869 m2/g) and the biggest pore volume (0.32 cm3/g). The pH values of the AC catalysts were also determined as 8.71 (AC-H2O), 8.62 (AC-C), 8.94 (AC-CO2), 9.06 (AC-K), and 5.79 (AC-Zn), respectively. Except AC-Zn, all the ACs have alkaline surfaces, among which AC-C and AC-H2O are nearest to neutral."
10,Effects of atmosphere and AC catalysts on 4-EP production,"3.2 Effects of atmosphere and AC catalysts on 4-EP production 3.2.1 Effects of inert and hydrogen atmosphere Fast pyrolysis experiments of bagasse were firstly performed to compare the effects of nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere on 4-EP production at 330 °C in both non-catalytic and catalytic (AC-H2O-to-bagasse ratio of 1.5) processes. Typical ion chromatograms from GC/MS analysis of the pyrolytic liquid products obtained under different pyrolytic conditions are given in Fig. 2 . Quantitative results are shown in Table 1 . Detailed composition of the liquid products is listed in the Supplementary material (Table S3). During the non-catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse in inert atmosphere (N2), 4-VP was the major product in the pyrolytic liquid especially at low pyrolysis temperatures (Fig. 2). The yield and selectivity of 4-VP at 330 °C were as high as 5.11 wt% and 16.82%, respectively (Table 1). Whereas, no 4-EP was detected under this condition. According to previous studies, 4-VP, the special pyrolytic product of bagasse and certain other herbaceous biomass materials, was mainly derived from the decarboxylation of p-coumaric acids (the special chemical composition of certain herbaceous biomass) and decomposition of p-hydroxyphenol subunits of lignin [14–16]. When the hydrogen atmosphere was employed in the non-catalytic process, the pyrolytic product distribution altered slightly. 4-VP was still the major product while 4-EP was a minor product (0.11 wt%) in the pyrolytic liquid. Notably, at a pyrolysis temperature of 330 °C, the yield of 4-VP under a hydrogen atmosphere was a little higher than that under nitrogen atmosphere (5.37 wt% vs 5.11 wt%). This was because hydrogen could participate in the biomass pyrolysis process to stabilize the biomass-derived intermediates and radicals, and thus, inhibiting the polymerization and charring reactions to form char product [21]. As a result, char yield decreased in the hydrogen atmosphere, while liquid yield increased, including a slight increase of 4-VP yield. The above results also clearly indicated that the formation of 4-EP could not be realized through the addition of only hydrogen. When AC-H2O catalyst was introduced into the pyrolysis process, the distribution of pyrolytic products changed greatly. 4-VP was no longer detected in the pyrolytic liquid product, while 4-EP became the major product. Previous studies have confirmed that 4-VP and 4-EP shared the same precursors, and AC possessed promising catalytic hydrogenation activity to convert 4-VP and its precursors into 4-EP under an inert atmosphere [16]. However, the conversion of 4-VP to 4-EP was low. In this study, AC-H2O catalyst also exhibited good performance on the preparation of 4-EP with a yield of 2.61 wt% under inert atmosphere, but the conversion ratio of 4-VP to 4-EP was as low as 50% (mol/mol), agreed with previous results [16]. Such results indicated that 4-VP and its precursors could not be hydrogenated completely into 4-EP by the AC-H2O catalyst in the inert atmosphere. When a hydrogen atmosphere was employed in the catalytic process, the yield of 4-EP was promoted significantly from 2.61 wt% to 3.55 wt% (increased by 36%), and the conversion ratio of 4-VP to 4-EP was over 68% (mol/mol). This result indicated that 4-EP production could be significantly improved by AC-H2O catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere. 3.2.2 Effects of different AC catalysts Further experiments were conducted to compare the catalytic capabilities of the five different AC catalysts at AC-to-bagasse ratio of 1.5 in a hydrogen atmosphere under 330 °C. Major results are shown in Table 1. Typical ion chromatograms from GC/MS analysis of the pyrolytic liquid products obtained from different ACs are given in Fig. 3 . Based on Table 1 and Fig. 3, all AC catalysts exhibited catalytic effects on promoting the formation of 4-EP at the expense of 4-VP, but their capability differed greatly from each other. Among the five ACs, AC-H2O and AC-C that were prepared via steam activation showed much better catalytic effects on the selective production of 4-EP than the other three ACs. AC-Zn had relatively stronger acidity as compared with other ACs, and thus, it mainly promoted the formation of furfural (FF), which was confirmed in the previous studies [29,30]. Based on the above results, AC-H2O was the best catalyst for 4-EP promotion, and it was consequently used in the following catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments under different pyrolysis conditions."
11,Preparation of 4-EP from catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse in a hydrogen atmosphere,"3.3 Preparation of 4-EP from catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse in a hydrogen atmosphere 3.3.1 Effects of pyrolysis temperature Temperature also played an important role in the biomass pyrolysis process. Table 2 shows the catalytic pyrolysis results under different pyrolysis temperatures (270–420 °C) at AC-H2O-to-bagasse ratio of 1.5. As the temperature rising, char yield decreased observably while liquid and gas yields increased. It is seen that char yield decreased by 0.32 times (74.41 wt% vs 50.45 wt%) as the temperature rose from 270 to 330 °C, while liquid and gas yields increased by 1.94 times (19.22 wt% vs 37.25 wt%) and 1.93 times (6.37 wt% vs 12.30 wt%), respectively. At a pyrolysis temperature of 270 °C, the liquid yield was only 19.22 wt%, while the water content was as high as 75.21 wt%, suggesting that the dehydration reactions were predominant in the low temperature pyrolysis process. The increasing of pyrolysis temperature would promote the decomposition of biomass to produce various organic liquid compounds. As a result, the yield of liquid product increased monotonically along with the pyrolysis temperature, while the water content in the pyrolytic liquid decreased gradually. The detailed composition of the liquid products analyzed by GC/MS is shown in the Supplementary material (Table S4). Along with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, yield of 4-EP increased to a maximum of 3.55 wt% at 330 °C, with a selectivity of 17.42%. It is noteworthy that the selectivity of 4-EP was as high as 32.74% at 270 °C, corresponding to the 4-EP yield of only 1.56 wt%. Higher pyrolysis temperatures over 330 °C would significantly decrease the 4-EP yield and its selectivity. As indicated above, 4-EP was mainly from the decarboxylation hydrogenation of p-coumaric acid, which could be achieved at low pyrolysis temperatures whereas significant decomposition of other components in biomass would not occur. As a result, high selectivity toward 4-EP could be obtained. As the pyrolysis temperature increased further, the yield of 4-EP decreased gradually, which might be due to the occurrence of other competitive reactions of the 4-EP precursors. 3.3.2 Effects of AC-to-bagasse ratio AC-to-bagasse ratio was another important factor affecting the pyrolytic products distribution. Table 3 gives the catalytic pyrolysis results at different AC-to-bagasse ratios of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 4 at 330 °C. The yields of char, liquid and gas changed differently along with the increasing of AC-to-bagasse ratio. Compared with the non-catalytic process, the liquid yields decreased greatly in the catalytic processes, while the char and gas yields increased. Moreover, since the water content in the liquid product increased greatly with the rising of the AC-to-bagasse ratio, the organic liquid yields in the catalytic processes were much lower than that in the non-catalytic process. Such results clearly indicated that the presence of AC-H2O catalyst would significantly inhibit the pyrolytic decomposition of bagasse to form organic liquid products, and meanwhile enhance the dehydration, charring and cracking reactions to generate water, char and gas products. According to Table 3, a minor amount of AC-H2O catalyst (AC-to-bagasse ratio of 0.5) would facilitate the formation of gas product from cracking reactions [20]; whereas, excessive quantity of catalyst would significantly promote the charring and carbonization reactions to generate char product. Yield of 4-EP also altered considerably under different AC-to-bagasse ratios. It can be inferred from Table 3 that the rise of catalyst amount increased the number of active sites and the effective contact between bagasse and AC-H2O, thus promoted the conversion of 4-EP precursors. Along with the increase of AC-H2O-to-bagasse ratio from 0 to 1.5, yield of 4-EP increased continuously to 3.55 wt%, which indicated that enough catalyst quantity was required to provide sufficient active sties to promote the conversion of 4-EP precursors. With the continuous rising of AC-to-bagasse ratio, 4-EP yield decreased significantly, to only 1.55 wt% at AC-to-bagasse ratio of 4. This observation agreed with that excessive amount of catalyst accelerated the charring reactions to from chars instead of 4-EP [16]. As indicated in Table 1 and Fig. 2, during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process, 5.11 wt% of 4-VP was obtained in the inert atmosphere, while 5.37 wt% of 4-VP and 0.11 wt% of 4-EP were produced in the hydrogen atmosphere. In comparison, for the catalytic pyrolysis process under the same conditions, the 4-EP yield was only 2.61 wt% in the inert atmosphere and 3.55 wt% in the hydrogen atmosphere. This phenomenon indicated that during the catalytic process, the 4-EP precursors could not be totally catalytically hydrogenated into 4-EP, and part of the 4-EP precursors might also undergo charring reactions. Whereas, in the hydrogen atmosphere, the catalytic hydrogenation reactions would be promoted, increasing the formation of 4-EP. 3.3.3 Recycling experiments Recycling experiments were conducted with AC-H2O-R catalyst under optimal catalytic pyrolysis conditions. After each run, the AC-H2O-R catalyst was separated from the solid char residues, then collected for the next experiment without any regeneration treatment. Quantitative results of pyrolytic products from three consecutive runs over AC-H2O-R catalyst under 330 °C at the AC-to-bagasse ratio of 1.5 are shown in Table 4 . Typical ion chromatograms from GC/MS are presented in the Supplementary material (Fig. S5). According to Table 4, a slight decrease of 4-EP yield and selectivity was detected after each run. 4-EP yield and selectivity can be maintained at 3.20 wt% and 13.51% respectively after the third run, indicating that the AC-H2O-R catalyst has good reusability and stability for selective production of 4-EP. 3.3.4 Feasibility of using simulated biomass pyrolysis gas The above results confirmed that the hydrogen atmosphere was essential for 4-EP production under catalytic conditions. However, due to the high cost of hydrogen, it was uneconomical to adopt external hydrogen sources. The biomass pyrolysis gas contains H2, and therefore might be a suitable hydrogen source for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to produce 4-EP. Verification experiments were then conducted. It should be noted that due to the limitation of experimental conditions, the recycle of pyrolytic gas could not be achieved. Hence, based on the composition of biomass pyrolysis gas, a simulated gas including H2 (4.00%), CO (17.01%), CO2 (14.95%), CH4 (6.06%) and He was prepared and utilized. The catalytic pyrolysis of bagasse was conducted in the simulated gas with AC-H2O at 330 °C. As shown in Table 1, both yield and selectivity of 4-EP in the atmosphere of mixed gas were close to those results in the hydrogen atmosphere. Moreover, the chemical composition of the two pyrolytic liquids from mixed gas and hydrogen atmosphere were similar to each other (Table S3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the biomass pyrolysis gas was feasible to be recycled for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce 4-EP."
12,Possible mechanism of 4-EP formation during AC-catalyzed pyrolysis in a hydrogen atmosphere,"3.4 Possible mechanism of 4-EP formation during AC-catalyzed pyrolysis in a hydrogen atmosphere Based on the above results, it is possible to postulate the 4-EP formation mechanism in the catalytic pyrolysis process in the hydrogen atmosphere. The 4-EP formation mechanism in AC-catalyzed pyrolysis process in inert atmosphere have been reported [16,17,28]. Generally, 4-VP could be produced mainly from the decarboxylation of p-coumaric acids and partly from the decomposition of p-hydroxyphenol subunits of lignin. In the AC-catalyzed process, certain functional groups on AC would catalyze the hydrogenation of 4-EP precursors to obtain 4-EP. Hence, this study mainly focused on the role of hydrogen in the 4-EP formation process. As clearly indicated above, the formation of 4-EP was a hydrogenation process, which required a proper amount of hydrogen donors to achieve the catalytic hydrogenation reaction. In the inert pyrolysis condition, no extra hydrogen donors were available, and thus, only the pyrolytic products of biomass could serve as hydrogen donors for 4-EP generation, leading to a low conversion ratio of 4-VP to 4-EP. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4 , enough hydrogen donors supplied by the hydrogen atmosphere would promote the hydrogenation reactions to form 4-EP. According to previous studies, the esterified p-coumaric acid was mainly linked to the γ site of the side chain in p-hydroxyphenyl subunits of lignin [31]. In the catalytic pyrolysis process, the ester bond broke in the presence of hydrogen to form p-coumaric acid and p-hydroxyphenyl subunits of lignin. p-Coumaric acid easily underwent decarboxylation reaction to form 4-VP which would then be catalytically hydrogenated into 4-EP in the presence of abundant H2. p-Coumaric acid might also be catalytically hydrogenated into the phloretic acid, followed by the decarboxylation of phloretic acid to produce 4-EP. In addition, the p-hydroxyphenyl subunits of lignin might also contribute to the formation of 4-EP through the cleavage of the β-O-4 bond followed by the hydrogenation reaction. In summary, the AC catalyst promoted the hydrogenation reactions to facilitate the conversion of the precursors into a large amount of 4-EP within sufficient hydrogen supply. In order to verify the mechanism proposed above, fast pyrolysis experiments of p-coumaric acid were carried out at 330 °C in four conditions, with the results shown in the Supplementary material (Table S5). It can be seen that the non-catalytic pyrolysis of p-coumaric acid in the nitrogen atmosphere obtained 4-VP with a yield of 17.6 wt%. Such low 4-VP yield might be attributed to the fact that p-coumaric acid was a solid raw material, which could not be fully heat-volatilized to generate 4-VP but greatly coked during the pyrolysis process. During the non-catalytic pyrolysis in the hydrogen atmosphere, a slight increase of 4-VP yield (18.9 wt%) was detected accompanied with the emerging of a small amount of 4-EP (1.6 wt%), which showed that the existence of hydrogen indeed inhibited the formation of char, and had a certain hydrogenation capacity to promote the conversion of p-coumaric acid into 4-EP. With the addition of AC-H2O, pyrolytic product distribution of p-coumaric acid changed significantly. In the nitrogen atmosphere, 4-EP with a yield of 7.4 wt% was produced, while no 4-VP was detected in the pyrolytic products. Similar experimental result was obtained in the hydrogen atmosphere, and the higher yield of 4-EP (10.3 wt%) also verified the rationality of the proposed mechanism. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of bagasse with various catalysts has been reported in previous studies. Zeolites [32] and metal oxides [33] were widely used catalysts for adjusting biomass pyrolytic product distribution. However, these catalysts were only effective to obtain high grade bio-oil or phenolics from the catalytic processes, rather than selective producing 4-EP. This further verified that the AC catalyst possessed good hydrogenation capability on 4-EP formation."
13,Conclusion,"A novel method was developed for catalytic fast pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse to selectively prepare 4-EP in a hydrogen atmosphere using AC-H2O catalyst. The results indicated that the hydrogen atmosphere could supply hydrogen donors to significantly increase 4-EP production as compared with the inert atmosphere. AC-H2O exhibited much better catalytic capabilities on selective 4-EP production than the other ACs prepared from different activation methods. Low pyrolysis temperature favored 4-EP formation. The maximal 4-EP yield of 3.55 wt% could be obtained under AC-to-bagasse ratio of 1.5 at 330 °C in the hydrogen atmosphere, with the selectivity of 17.42%, compared with the 4-EP yield and selectivity of only 2.61 wt% and 12.54% in the inert atmosphere. In addition, avoiding extra hydrogen supply, the biomass pyrolytic gas which contained H2 was suitable for providing the hydrogen atmosphere during 4-EP production."
