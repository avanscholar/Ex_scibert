0,Introduction,"The development of modern chemical technologies depends more and more on the availability of novel materials with well-controlled structure and functionalities. Mesoporous thin films possess large surface areas and adjustable pore sizes, and their chemical composition can be varied in a wide range. These structured materials can be deposited onto the inner walls of microchannels in miniaturized reactors to prevent high pressure drop, to enhance catalyst accessibility, and to avoid internal diffusion limitations. Previous works have shown the controlled deposition of thin layers of mesoporous silica and titania films onto different substrates by evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) with a possibility to control porosity, thickness, and chemical composition of the resulting films [1–5]. EISA has proved to be readily suited for the preparation of novel mesoporous materials with a variety of pore systems and dimensions, and the technique is now commonly applied in the preparation of silica and metal oxide nanostructured porous catalytic layers on various substrates. In the presence of colloidal nanoparticles or during deposition on substrates with microstructured features, preparative conditions should be adjusted for silica and titania systems [6] following the original synthetic protocols documented by Grosso et al. [7,8]. Ordered mesoporous oxide films are considered to be potential host matrices to support metal or metal oxide nanoparticles for secondary growth of carbon nanowires [9], as well as for application in catalysis [10–13], bioelectrochemistry [14], electrochemistry [15], and sensors [16]. These highly ordered and precisely controlled structures are especially attractive for the development of new generations of structured catalysts [17] for various gas–liquid–solid reactions. Two synthetic approaches were applied in this study to incorporate nanoparticles into mesoporous silica and titania thin films. In the first approach, the mesoporous silica films were synthesized by sol–gel synthesis which was followed by adsorption of a PtRu5Sn cluster precursor [16,18] in the consecutive step. The second approach is based on a novel methodology [10,11] by which a uniform film, containing controlled amounts of polymetallic nanoparticles, can be obtained. This elegant strategy is based on the condensation of metal oxide species by self-assembly in the presence of polymer stabilized Pt50Sn50 and Pt90Sn10 nanoparticles. This approach, however, has been hitherto successfully applied to relatively large nanoparticles with an average size of above 2nm in order to prevent metal sedimentation inside the amorphous titania walls. As opposed to stirred tank reactors, capillary microreactors with thin catalytic films nearly always operate in the kinetic mode instead of in the mass transport limited mode. Therefore, the screening of sufficiently active, in-house synthesized, catalytic films becomes an important step in the development of microreactor technology. The activity and selectivity of supported Pt50Sn50, Pt90Sn10, and PtRu5Sn nanoparticles, were studied in the hydrogenation of citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) as a model reaction to demonstrate the feasibility of the applied approaches for the preparation of catalytic thin films. Citral is usually a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers and it can be hydrogenated towards the unsaturated aldehyde (CAL, citronellal) and unsaturated alcohols (UCOL, nerol and geraniol, cis- and trans-isomers, respectively). Subsequent hydrogenation of these products leads to citronellol (COL), and then to dimethyloctanol (DMOL), while isomerization of citronellal gives isopulegol (IP) (Scheme 1 ). The probability to hydrogenate either the CC or the CO bond of the unsaturated aldehydes, which governs the final selectivity towards the production of the unsaturated alcohols, depends critically on the adsorption mode of the reactant molecule [19]. Higher electron density on the surface metal atoms decreases the binding energy of the CC bond via an increase of the repulsive four-electron interaction and, on the other hand, favors the backbonding interaction with the πCO-orbital and the hydrogenation of the CO bond with respect to that of CC. Therefore, electron-donating metals in bimetallic [19,20] or trimetallic [21] catalysts usually improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols. In this paper, we address the influence of the capillary residence time, the reaction temperature, and the metal stoichiometry on the hydrogenation of citral and selectivity (including stereoselectivity) over a series of in-house made nanostructured catalytic films. The role of catalyst aging on the selectivity in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral will be presented."
1,Experimental,"Four types of nanoparticles (Pt, Pt50Sn50, Pt90Sn10, and PtRu5Sn), three types of thin films (mesoporous silica templated with non-ionic surfactant, polymer templated mesoporous silica, and mesoporous titania), and two deposition methods (spin-coating and dip-coating) have been studied. In the first approach, metal nanoparticles and thin films were prepared separately, which was followed by a cluster-derived nanoparticles deposition step (Sections 2.1–2.3). In the second approach, one-pot synthesis of thin mesoporous oxide films containing controlled amounts of bimetallic nanoparticles was utilized (Section 2.4)."
2,Nanoparticle synthesis,"2.1 Nanoparticle synthesis 2.1.1 Synthesis of PtRu5Sn clusters The mixed metal cluster nanoparticle precursor, [PtRu5C(CO)15(μ-Sn-Ph2)], was synthesized using previously reported methodology [22] from the reaction of [PtRu5(CO)16] with Ph3SnH. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Pt90Sn10 and Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles For solution 1, in a two-necked, round-bottom flask, 1.1g of poly-n-vinyl pyrrolidone (this amount corresponded to a metal-to-polymer ratio of 10:1) was added to 120ml of anhydrous ethylene glycol. Different amounts of tin(II) acetate (depending on the final nanoparticle composition) were added to the mixture, and the system was stirred for 3h at 353K. For solution 2, different amounts of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (depending on the final colloid composition) were dissolved in 50ml of methanol under vigorous stirring for 2h. The solution was dark orange in color. Solution 1 was cooled to 273K with an ice bath and solution 2 was poured into solution 1 under stirring to ensure homogenization. The pH of the resulting mixture was adjusted to approximately 9.5 by adding a 1M NaOH solution. The resulting bright yellow solution was capped and heated at 373K for 2h under vigorous stirring. Then, the resulting colloidal solution was cooled to room temperature. The stability of the prepared bimetallic colloids is acknowledged by the fact that the colloidal glycol dispersions remained stable for more than 8 months after preparation, with no noticeable amount of aggregated colloid."
3,Synthesis of mesoporous thin films,"2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous thin films To get a better adhesion, the surface roughness of the silicon substrates (1cm×1cm) was increased to 500nm by a micropowder jet treatment. A 50nm TiO2 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition as described elsewhere [23]. Prior to the mesoporous thin film synthesis, the titania layer was made super hydrophilic by an UV irradiation (contact angle below 3°, corresponding to a concentration of surface OH groups > 15 per nm2) [24]. The synthesis solution was prepared following an earlier reported approach [2,25]. Briefly, two synthesis solutions with a molar composition of 1.0 TEOS: 6.48 1-propanol: 2.64 2-butanol: 0.15 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB): 0.007 aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (ATSB): 9.84 H2O: 0.14 HCl (method A) and 1.0 TEOS: 0.007 Pluronic F127: 5.60 ethanol: 5.03 H2O (method B) were used for preparation of films with different pore diameters. After aging, a drop of the appropriate solution was deposited on the substrate. The substrate was spin-coated at 1500rpm for 30s at a relative humidity (RH) of 80%. The as-deposited films were dried and calcined at 573K and a residual pressure of 5mbar followed the approach developed by Glazneva et al. [24]."
4,Catalyst deposition,"2.3 Catalyst deposition 2.3.1 Pt deposition Fifty substrate plates coated on one side with the SiO2 films (14mg SiO2) were impregnated with an aqueous solution of a H2PtCl6 precursor (40mg H2PtCl6·6H2O/8ml water) for 24h to obtain 1wt.% metal loading. After impregnation, the substrates were left in a glove box at a RH of 80% for 4h and then were exposed to a UV light for 24h at a distance of 3cm below the UV source (UV lamp: Hanovia 679A-36; 450W; λ range, 220–1400nm). To prevent crack formation during thermal expansion and to obtain a uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles, a modified photocalcination procedure [25] was adopted for surfactant removal from the as-synthesized thin films containing Pt nanoparticles at ambient temperature [26–28]. 2.3.2 Ru5PtSn deposition A substrate plate coated from one side with the mesoporous silica film was immersed in an ether–dichloromethane solution (3ml) containing 5mg (2.8μmol) of the PtRu5C(CO)15(μ-SnPh2) molecular cluster at room temperature for 96h. Then, the substrates were washed with diethylether and dried in vacuum and heated up to 573K in vacuum to produce polymetallic nanoparticles."
5,Synthesis of thin films with embedded nanoparticles,"2.4 Synthesis of thin films with embedded nanoparticles Pluronic F127 (BASF) was dissolved in ethanol and a polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized ethanol suspension of colloidal Pt50Sn50 (or Pt90Sn10) nanoparticles was heated to 333K for 5min. The amount of Pt–Sn nanoparticles was chosen to obtain a 1wt.% total metal loading in mesoporous films. To this solution, water and HNO3 (65wt.%) were added and aged for 5min. Titanium tetrabutoxide was added dropwise in the solution and then the solution was aged for 2h. The final solution with a molar composition of 1 Ti(OBu)4:0.005 Pluronic F127:40 ethanol:0.13 HNO3:1.3 H2O was spin-coated in a similar way as described in Section 3.2 (method C1). In case of film deposition on the inner wall of fused silica capillaries (250μm i.d., 10 m length, Varian), dip-coating was applied instead of spin-coating (method C2). The deposition method is described elsewhere in detail [11]. Briefly, the titania sol was withdrawn from the capillary at a constant speed of 1cms−1. The capillaries were left in a glove box for 24h at a RH of 80% and then calcined at 573K under a residual pressure of 10mbar with a heating rate of 1°C/min to remove the surfactant."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The morphology of the catalysts was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai TF20 electron microscope operated at 200kV. The collected powders were ground and dispersed in ethanol. Then the suspensions were dropped gently to a holey amorphous carbon film on a Ni or Cu grid. The particle size distribution (PSD) was obtained by measuring 100 particles from the TEM micrographs. The mean particle diameter was calculated by the following formula: d m = ( 1 / 100 ) ∑ i = 1 100 n i d i , where n i is the number of particles with diameter d i . The dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, %D, was estimated from the mean particle diameter obtained from TEM by the formula: % D = C 1 / d ( nm ) , where C 1 is a constant, for supported platinum catalysts, C 1 is 108 [29]. XRD data were obtained by a Rigaku Geigerflex Max/B diffractometer (40kV, 40mA) with Cu Kα radiation (using continuous scanning at 0.02° 2θ and a counting time of 0.5s scan step). For the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) elemental analysis, the films were spin-coated on larger (2cm×2cm) Si substrates following the same method as described in Section 3.2. Then the films were scratched, the scales were treated with aqua regia and the resulting solution was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)."
7,Catalytic testing,"2.6 Catalytic testing 2.6.1 Batch mode The hydrogenation of citral was carried out in a 130ml autoclave reactor (Büchi) at 343K and 10bar H2 pressure with cyclohexane as solvent. Fifty substrate plates with mesoporous films were loaded in a rotating holder which was positioned as the stirrer in the reactor. The initial concentration of citral was varied depending on the Pt loading (see Table 1 ). Prior to the reaction, the films were reduced in a H2 flow at 773K for 10min. After transfer into the reactor, the substrates with the thin films were reduced inside the reactor at 513K. Liquid samples of 1μl were taken for analysis after desired time intervals using a Rapid On-Line Sample Injector system (ROLSI™) connected to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with WCOT (30m×0.25mm) and CP Sil 5CB DF columns and a FID detector. 2.6.2 Continuous mode In the catalytic activity tests, a mixture of citral in hexane was mixed in a T-mixer with a hydrogen flow. The internal diameters of the inlet and outlet tubes of the T-mixer were 250μm. The gas was fed at an angle of 90° with respect to the liquid flow. The liquid flow was varied between 5 and 10μl/min and the H2 flow was kept constant at 1.0mL/min (STP). The capillary and connecting tubes were placed in an oven maintained at the desired temperature. The product analysis was done off-line with the same Varian 3800 gas chromatograph. In the absence of external mass transfer limitations, the choice of the flow regime determines the liquid hold-up in the reactor and does not influence the reaction kinetics. The range of applied gas and liquid flow velocities corresponds to the annular flow regime [30]. In this regime, the liquid hold-up depends on the thickness of the liquid film. The thickness of the liquid film can be calculated from the Lockhart–Martinelli–Chisholm correlation [31]. The correlation between the liquid two-phase friction multiplier ϕ L 2 and the Martinelli parameter X 2, being the ratio of the single-phase liquid and gas pressure gradients, is given as ϕ L 2 = 1 + C / X + 1 / X 2 , where C is a parameter that depends on whether the liquid and gas flows are laminar or turbulent. For the laminar (liquid)–laminar (gas) case, considered in this study, C =5."

9,Mesoporous titania films with embedded Pt90Sn10 and Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles,"3.1 Mesoporous titania films with embedded Pt90Sn10 and Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles The synthesis protocol for the one-pot synthesis of mesoporous films by spin-coating on flat substrates or by dip-coating on the inner surface of fused silica capillaries involves four major steps [11] (Scheme 2 ): 1. synthesis of colloidal (metal or polymetallic) nanoparticles stabilized by a surfactant; 2. preparation of an inorganic metal precursor sol containing colloidal nanoparticles and a structure directing agent; 3. destabilization of the sol by solvent evaporation to yield a gel; and 4. surfactant removal and in situ reduction of metal nanoparticles. The individual steps of this method were presented and discussed in a series of publications [10,11] for the deposition of bimetallic nanoparticles into mesoporous silica and titania films. The properties of the resulting catalytic mesoporous films are summarized in Table 2 . In this section, we focus on the unique properties of the embedded nanoparticles in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral. We address the influence of the nanoparticle composition, the catalyst configuration, and the reaction conditions on the hydrogenation of citral. The hydrogenations of the CC and CO bonds in citral transformation (Scheme 1) occur simultaneously depending on the accessibility of the active sites, the size and the shape of the nanoparticles, and the citral to metal ratio. The latter was fixed during the experiments within a narrow range for proper activity comparison of the different catalytic systems. According to TEM data the mean particle size of nanoparticles was 2.4±0.6nm and 2.6±0.7nm for Pt90Sn10 and Pt50Sn50, respectively (Fig. 1 ). In the following discussion, we refer to the titania supported nanoparticles, however we omitted the support from the catalyst codes to avoid repetitions. On metal nanoparticles with a size less than 4nm, the presence of metal atoms with low coordination may allow unconstrained adsorption of both double bonds. In this case, the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favored [20]. The Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles are substantially more selective than the Pt90Sn10 nanoparticles towards the formation of the saturated aldehyde (CAL) at 343K in a capillary microreactor (Fig. 2 ). The selectivity towards CAL reaches 72% over the Pt50Sn50 catalyst as compared with 13% over the Pt90Sn10 one. As the temperature decreases from 343 to 323K, the amount of isopulegol (IP) formed increases from 8 to 38% over Pt50Sn50 and becomes equal to that of CAL while the sum of these two products remains rather constant (Fig. 3(a)). A similar trend was observed in a conventional batch reactor [32]. Such behavior can be explained if the production rates of CAL and UCOL in parallel reactions have similar activation energies while the activation energy of the subsequent isomerization of CAL to IP will be lower. The activation energies for the hydrogenation of citral of 75 and 53kJ/mol were calculated from the Arrhenius plot at low conversions for Pt50Sn50 and Pt90Sn10, respectively (Fig. 4 ). A different selectivity pattern was observed at 343K over the Pt90Sn10/TiO2 film. IP and citronellol (COL), with the latter being an intermediate in the subsequent hydrogenation of both CAL and UCOL, are the main reaction products with a selectivity of 28% at 343K (Fig. 3(b)). The yield of the fully saturated product (DMOL) is four times higher as compared with the Pt50Sn50 catalyst. As the temperature decreases to 323K, the selectivity to IP increases from 28 to 50% while the sum of the IP and COL selectivities remains constant and equals 52–53%. This allows to conclude that COL is formed over the Pt90Sn10 catalyst preferably via hydrogenation of CAL rather than UCOL. The temperature dependence of the selectivities towards the main reaction products resembles that observed over the Pt90Sn10 catalyst with the exception of a much higher amount of CAL becoming hydrogenated to COL and even further to DMOL as well as a larger amount of CAL being converted to IP. In other words, subsequent hydrogenation and isomerization of the partially hydrogenated intermediates is more pronounced over the catalyst with the higher Pt content. Over the Pt50Sn50 catalyst, the selectivity towards IP decreases from 37 to 17% while the selectivity to CAL increases from 37 to 55% with an increase of the liquid flow rate from 5 to 10μl/min, which corresponds to a decrease of the liquid residence time from 23 to 13.5min (Fig. 5(a)). The selectivities to other products remain relatively unchanged. From the discussion above it follows that the subsequent hydrogenation of CAL proceeds slowly, therefore this product dominates at the shortest liquid residence time of 13.5min. As the residence time increases to 23min (liquid flow rate of 5μl/min), substantial amounts of CAL are converted to IP. Constant selectivities towards UCOL and COL clearly point out that COL is mainly formed via the hydrogenation of UCOL over the Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles. The dependence of the selectivity to IP and CAL on the liquid flow rate has a similar trend over the Pt90Sn10 nanoparticles (Fig. 5(b)). The isomerization of CAL to IP proceeds to a larger extend at a liquid residence time of 23min, therefore the selectivity to CAL increases by 11.5%, while the selectivity to IP decreases by 13% as the liquid flow rate increases from 5 to 10μl/min. A difference of 1.5% in selectivity is due to the fact that a part of CAL is hydrogenated to COL and further to DMOL. However, the selectivity to UCOL increases by 11.7% while that to the fully hydrogenated product (DMOL) decreases by 9.6%. This observation allows to conclude that a part of COL, and also of DMOL, is produced via the hydrogenation of UCOL over the Pt90Sn10 catalyst. Apart from the ratio between two metals, it is well known that the distribution of the second metal in a bimetallic nanoparticle is also responsible for the selectivity pattern [33]. Vilella et al. [33] studied addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 by controlled surface reactions which allowed them to modify the selectivity to different hydrogenation products. For a low surface concentration of the second metal in a Pt–M bimetallic nanoparticle, the catalysts were selective for the hydrogenation of the –CC– bonds, but the higher Sn to Pt ratio catalysts were selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Vilella et al. [34] observed a similar trend in the selectivity pattern in citral hydrogenation over a series of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on an activated carbon felt (ACF). The Pt loading was fixed at 5wt.% while the Sn loading was varied corresponding to nominal compositions of Pt6Sn2, Pt6Sn3, and Pt6Sn6. The selectivity to UCOL at a citral conversion of 70% decreased from 46.3% over Pt6Sn2 to 42.5% over Pt6Sn3 and then increased, reaching values higher than 70% for the catalyst with a Sn/Pt ratio of 1. Besides, the formation of CAL was also affected by the tin addition. The selectivity towards CAL increased from 13.4% over Pt6Sn2 to 16.4% over Pt6Sn3 and then decreased to 6.7% over Pt6Sn6. The authors concluded that different degree of dilution of Pt atoms by Sn would either inhibit or promote the hydrogenation of the –CC– bonds and the adsorption of the unsaturated alcohols. They observed an enrichment of the surface of bimetallic particles in Sn at low tin content, however the degree of this enrichment was much lower than the one that was found on a PtSn/C catalyst with a Pt loading of 0.3wt.%. A conclusion has been made that the total metallic loading, the promoter tin loading and the nature of the support (carbon vs. ACF) can affect the structure of the metallic phase and the selectivity towards UCOL. It should be mentioned that several other authors have reported an important influence of the support on the structure of the metallic phase in the hydrogenation of α-β unsaturated aldehydes [35,36]. This difference in the selectivity pattern between Pt50Sn50 and Pt90Sn10 might be primarily attributed to the different fractions of exposed metal surfaces with varying metal stoichiometry, i.e. at Pt-rich colloids there exist a larger polycrystalline Pt domain while individual Pt atoms prevail in the Pt50Sn50 nanoparticles. The current results show that the reaction conditions can also alter the activity and the selectivity, but the intrinsic properties of the catalyst, viz. the nanoparticle composition, are still the dominating features, regardless of which reaction parameter is varied. The capillary microreactor with the Pt50Sn50/TiO2 catalyst deactivated faster than the Pt50Sn50/TiO2 one (Fig. 6 ). The activity of both catalysts in the hydrogenation of citral decreased significantly during the course of the reaction for all reaction conditions studied. The initial activity of the deactivated films could be completely restored by purging the capillary microreactor with an air/hexane flow at 353K. After regeneration with air, the selectivities towards the major products were not identical with the initial values, but close to those just before regeneration (Fig. 6). For both catalysts, it was found that the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols (UCOL) monotonously increased with time-on-stream for all reaction conditions and after some time reached a steady-state value. This suggests that higher selectivities may be obtained at a defined number of turnovers with both catalysts. However, increasing the selectivity by a longer exposure of the catalyst to the reaction mixture is limited to some extend as the Pt90Sn10 and Pt50Sn50/TiO2 films decrease their initial activity by 75% for the hydrogenation of all types of double bonds after 8 and 24h, respectively. As the catalysts regained their initial activities after regeneration, it appears that decarbonylation and the irreversible adsorption of CO on the metal surface is the main reason for the loss in activity. For gas phase reactions, the initial activity of the deactivated catalysts can be restored by removing CO by evacuation at 573K, while for the capillary microreactors this is not practical, but the activity of a deactivated catalyst could be fully restored by replacing the hydrogen flow with air. During that procedure, the adsorbed CO is oxidized to CO2 which has a significantly lower adsorption constant than CO on Pt [37]. It desorbs and the properties of the films are restored without influencing the metal dispersion. Our results suggest that CO blocks the active sites, leading to a decrease in the activity of the catalyst, but this is of minor importance for the selectivity. After the oxidation pretreatment, the initial selectivity over Pt90Sn10/TiO2 towards COL of 30% was not fully recovered (Fig. 6(b)). The selectivity was close (about 4% lower) to that obtained just before the oxidation treatment. It appears that the metal sites at the steps, corners and kinks do not regain their original properties [38] by the oxidative treatment under mild conditions."
10,Stereoselectivity in hydrogenation of citral over bimetallic supported catalysts,"3.2 Stereoselectivity in hydrogenation of citral over bimetallic supported catalysts Citral used in this study was a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers with a molar ratio of the cis (Z-) and trans (E-)isomers of 1.08. The difference in selectivity towards formation of the cis- and trans-isomers of UCOL was studied for both the Pt90Sn10/TiO2 and the Pt50Sn50/TiO2 catalysts and the ratio of geraniol to nerol (trans- to cis-isomer) is given in Figs. 3 and 5 as a function of the temperature and the liquid flow rate, respectively. This ratio is about 0.55 and 0.33 over the Pt50Sn50 and Pt90Sn10//TiO2 films, respectively, for all reaction conditions at 343K. This means that the yield of the trans-isomer (geraniol) was much lower on both supported catalysts. As both catalysts have similar particle sizes (as shown in Fig. 1) and were deposited on the same support, it is obvious that the difference in the selectivity is a consequence of the metal ratio (nanoparticle formulation) and the nanoconfinement of the nanoparticles within the mesoporous structure. An excess of the cis-isomer (nerol) in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral can be explained by a higher reactivity of cis-citral (neral) as compared to that of trans-citral (geranial). Such selectivity pattern is rather unusual in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. It is difficult to rationalize the higher reactivity of the cis-isomer compared to the trans-isomer over titania supported bimetallic nanoparticles. The trans-to-cis-isomerization is thermodynamically possible [39] and it has been reported in the literature [38–41]. It is well known that trans-to-cis-isomerization reactions are catalyzed by weak or medium acid sites and their rates are independent from the presence of metal particles [38]. However, this isomerization reaction can be excluded at 323K. Indeed the rates of disappearance of the trans- and cis-isomers of citral are equal to the respective rates of formation of the trans- and cis-isomers of UCOL (geraniol and nerol, respectively), thus indicating that trans-to-cis-isomerization of geraniol is not observed under reaction conditions. However, as the temperature increases (from 323 to 343K), larger amounts of the trans-isomer were produced on both catalysts. It appears that the hydrogenation of the trans-isomer increases faster at higher temperature as compared with that of the cis-isomer. It should be mentioned that decreasing the pore size from 3.0 to 2.2nm as well as the bimetallic Pt50Sn50 particle size from 2.4 to 1.8nm, considerably improved the selectivity to UCOL (Table 3 ). At the same time geraniol was formed in much higher amounts as compared with nerol. We assume that such dramatic change in selectivity pattern can be due to geometrical constrictions in the smaller mesopores. The difference between the pore diameter and the nanoparticle size of 0.4nm can substantially decrease the amount of active sizes available for citral adsorption via the CC double bond (Table 3). Bimetallic catalysts seem to have a promising prospect to change the selectivity (including stereo selectivity) in the hydrogenation of citral by varying the metal stoichiometry in the nanoparticles. In this way, trimetallic supported catalysts possess even larger possibilities for fine tuning of their electronic properties and changing the mode of adsorption of organic molecules. Below we focus on one example of application of trimetallic nanoparticles deposited onto a mesoporous silica support to improve the yield of unsaturated alcohols in citral hydrogenation."
11,Improvement selectivity to unsaturated alcohols on trimetallic supported catalysts,"3.3 Improvement selectivity to unsaturated alcohols on trimetallic supported catalysts Trimetallic PtRu5Sn cluster precursors were embedded into mesoporous silica films by impregnation. The resulting nanoparticles were attached to the support via two Ru–O–Si bonds [42]. The PtRu5Sn cluster was chosen as a model system following the previous results obtained in the hydrogenation of dimethylterephthalate (DMT) [18]. The conversion of DMT over silica supported PtRu5Sn was much higher as compared with that observed over silica supported Ru5Pt and Ru6Sn nanostructured catalysts. It should be pointed out that the size of the PtRu5Sn clusters was much smaller as compared to that of the channel wall. If the one-pot deposition method is applied, a substantial number of clusters would be located entirely inside the silica walls rather than exposed to the reactants in the mesopores. Therefore impregnation was used for the deposition of PtRu5Sn clusters. The silica film was chosen as a support for this study to exclude a possible strong metal support interaction effect observed in case of a titania support. However, the silica support is less stable as compared with the titania support in polar organic solvents [25], therefore the duration of these tests was limited to seven hours. The initial hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards the main reaction products are listed in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 7 in comparison with monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. It should be noted that the sum of the selectivities is less than 100% as several other by-products were formed in minor quantities. After a reaction time of 120min, the PtRu5Sn/SiO2 film showed the highest turnover frequency (TOF). The hydrogenation of the carbonyl group was dominant over this catalyst, producing UCOL with a selectivity of 56% at a 50% citral conversion. The high activity is related to the precise control of the nanoparticles size of 1.8nm anchored on the inner surface of the silica mesopores [18]. The long-order structure was still intact in the spent films as shown in Fig. 8 . The cis-isomer (nerol) was formed in slightly larger amounts as compared with geraniol, corresponding to the geraniol to nerol molar ratio in the range of 0.88–0.93 (Table 3) over PtRu5Sn/SiO2, which is in agreement with previously reported data [32]. The activity and selectivity of the bi- and trimetallic catalysts was compared with that of the Pt/SiO2 film obtained by photocalcination. The Pt nanoparticles have a narrow particle size distribution with an average size of 1.9 and 1.8nm before and after catalytic tests, respectively (Fig. 9 ), which justifies the application of photocalcination [43] as a promising method for fabrication of catalytic thin films containing embedded nanoparticles. However, monometallic Pt nanoparticles demonstrate a lower reaction rate after a reaction time of 120min as compared to bi- and tri-metallic ones. The selectivity to UCOL was increased from 13 to 17% in the course of the reaction and it was quite similar to that observed over the bimetallic nanoparticles embedded into mesoporous supports with a larger pore diameter. As discussed above, a similar increase in the selectivity towards UCOL over the bimetallic catalysts was related to the fact that the less selective sites deactivate faster."
12,Conclusions,"Two modes of functionalized nanoparticle delivery onto thin films for application in catalytic microstructured reactors were demonstrated: post-synthesis impregnation of the support and one-pot synthesis. An addition of the second and third element to the nanoparticles is responsible for dramatic changes in the activity and selectivity pattern of supported thin films in hydrogenation of citral. Reaction conditions can also alter the activity and the selectivity, but the intrinsic properties of the catalyst, viz. the nanoparticle composition, are still the dominating features, regardless of which reaction parameter was varied. The selectivity towards the target product can be changed in a wide range by varying the composition, the metal ratio, and/or the pore size of the support. The methods proposed in this study allow independent control of each of these parameters."
