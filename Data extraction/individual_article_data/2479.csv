0,Introduction,"Due to large energy consumption and its forecasted increase in the coming years (Agora Energiewende and Sandbag, 2019; IEA, 2017), together with the depletion of fossil fuel resources, new possibilities of obtaining energy are being sought. It is estimated that energy demand will increase by almost 27% on a global scale during the period 2017–2040 (IEA, 2017). Particular attention is drawn to the possibility of obtaining energy from clean, ecological sources, which include hydrogen. Hydrogen is characterized by a very high energy gain per valence electron, due to hydrogen having the most favourable ratio of electrons to nucleons amongst all elements. Moreover, it is estimated that the chemical energy obtained in terms of hydrogen mass, is at least three times higher than other popular chemical fuels, including liquid hydrocarbons (hydrogen – 142 MJ kg−1, HC – 47 MJ kg−1) (Schlapbach and Züttel, 2001). Among the significant challenges of using hydrogen widely as an energy source, the International Energy Agency highlights the cost of its production from low-carbon energy, which remains high (IEA, 2019). It is also important that hydrogen can be produced from both clean electricity and fossil fuels (Dovì et al., 2009). Currently, there is a tendency to increase the production of hydrogen from clean electricity, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by using high-temperature thermochemical water-splitting, biological, and photo-electrochemical methods (Hamilton, 2012; IEA, 2019). In addition, there is a lack of and a slowdown in the development of infrastructure closely related to the use of hydrogen, such as hydrogen refuelling stations. The barriers to the development of hydrogen energy are often imprecise legal regulations or the lack of limitations of the aforementioned. Hydrogen energy is associated with the problems of the economical and safe transport and storage of hydrogen, and thus the use of appropriate methods and materials (Folentarska et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2015; Niaz et al., 2015). The problem of hydrogen storage is the main factor limiting its use on a large scale in fuel cell systems (Nishihara and Kyotani, 2018). Hydrogen can be stored in several ways, both in a liquid state (cryogenic storage), as a gas (compressed hydrogen), chemically bound or using the phenomenon of sorption in sorbents (Acar and Dincer, 2019; Broom, 2011; Hamilton, 2012; Lai et al., 2015; Mohan et al., 2019; Niaz et al., 2015; Salehabadi et al., 2018; Wulf et al., 2018; Züttel, 2003). Both physical storage of compressed hydrogen gas in high-pressure tanks and physical storage of cryogenic hydrogen in insulated tanks are not practical and safe enough for hydrogen-powered vehicles (Arab et al., 2017). In the case of liquid hydrogen, it is necessary to constantly maintain the low temperature of the tank and its thermal insulation. The large energy contribution in the process of hydrogen condensation is associated with considerable energy costs, and concerning small mobile tanks, this solution remains uneconomical (Niaz et al., 2015). The use of compressed hydrogen requires special installation, constructed with very tight and durable materials, and energy input to achieve high pressures. Limitations in the chemical storage of hydrogen may be attributable to the extreme nature of a reaction, lack of its reversibility, susceptibility to contamination and slow kinetics. Problems related to hydrogen storage in sorbents are mainly related to weak interactions with hydrogen molecules and low temperature or high-pressure requirements for adsorption. Carbon materials are suited for hydrogen storage. They are characterized by their high porosity, large specific surface area and thermal and chemical stability, thus associated with significant hydrogen storage values (Musyoka et al., 2015b; Nishihara and Kyotani, 2018). Fly ash from coal is one of the raw materials used to obtain carbon sorbents. Fly ash belongs to the group of anthropogenic minerals (Rosiek, 2018). It is a fine-grained residue formed as a result of coal combustion, which is transported from the furnace to the boiler through exhaust gas and collected by electrostatic precipitators or collectors (baghouses). About 85% of the ash produced is fly ash (Heidrich et al., 2013). It is characterized by its grey colour of various shades, depending on the combustion technique, the content of remaining carbon and the admixtures in the chemical composition (FeO – brown shades, CaO – light colours) (ACAA, 2017; Jayaranjan et al., 2014). It consists mainly of small spherical particles that differ in shape and size due to the difference in the degree of carbon powder and the efficiency of the collection system. The grain sizes range from 0.001 to 0.075 mm (Kim and Prezzi, 2008). The fly ash density ranges from 1.12 to 1.28 g/cm3. The specific surface area is from 1 to 9.44 m2/g (Theis and Gardner, 1990). The principal components of coal fly ash are silica, alumina, iron oxide, and calcium, with varying amounts of carbon, as measured by the loss of ignition (LOI). In the case of lignite coal fly ash, the content of calcium and magnesium oxide is higher than in sub-bituminous coal fly ash (Ahmaruzzaman, 2010). The high content of silica and clay makes them great adsorbents (Asokbunyarat et al., 2015). Due to the chemical composition, fly ash can be divided into two types: C-type ash from brown coal combustion or sub-brown coal combustion and F-type ash from bituminous coal or anthracite combustion (ACAA, 2003; ASTM International, 2012). According to the American Society for Testing and Materials standard (ASTM International, 2012), Class F is characterized by the minimum sum of SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3 oxides equal to 70% and low calcium oxide content <8% (Manz, 1999), while in Class C, the sum of oxides is 50% and the content of CaO is higher, i.e., >8% (Manz, 1999). According to the standard, both ashes, Class C and F have the following composition: SO3 – max. 5%, moisture content – max. 3%, LOI – max. 6%, alkalis – max. 1.50%. One of the main factors hindering the use of fly ash is the lack of an economical system of collection, transhipment and transport of fly ash. Also, fly ash contains a variety of heavy metal admixtures (Ilyushechkin et al., 2012; Jayaranjan et al., 2014), and their elimination is important due to the possibility of contamination of the surrounding soil and water resources. In the case of volatile fly ash, the content of selected metals may reach (in mg kg−1 dry matter): 304 – arsenic, 312 – cadmium, 5800 – zinc, 254 - copper, 1192 – lead, 498 – chromium (Bridgen and Santillo, 2002; Choi et al., 2002; Ilyushechkin et al., 2012; Levandowski and Kalkreuth, 2009). Fly ash is used very effectively in various fields of the economy. Fly ash in Europe mainly serves as cement raw material, mixed cement, concrete additive, various types of fillings (Ilyushechkin et al., 2012; Shekhovtsova et al., 2018). Ash is a very good filler. It is used on a large scale in engineering applications – it can successfully replace much more expensive soil (Dewangan et al., 2010) or serve as an addition to soils to improve their durability parameters (Cadersa et al., 2014; Ferguson, 1993). Coal Combustion Products (CCPs) are also used to improve the quality of the soil – using fertilization with ash (soil amendments) (Pathan et al., 2003). Fly ash is used as an ingredient in the production of cement, including the well-known Portland cement, or small amounts may be added to concrete, increasing the strength and durability of materials (Berry and Malhotra, 1980; Jaturapitakkul and Cheerarot, 2003). Numerous works concern the replacement of traditional Portland cement with geopolymers, i.e., aluminosilicates with a specific structure, to which both fly and bottom ashes can be used (Chindaprasirt et al., 2009; Zhuang et al., 2016). As a result of the activation of silica and aluminium, which are part of the discussed CCPs, geopolymers are created using alkali (Zhuang et al., 2016). It is important that heavy metals contained in ash, generated during coal combustion, are trapped in the polymer structure (Li et al., 2013). Ashes are also used in environmental protection as sorbents in the purification of mine waters or industrial and domestic sewage (Koshy and Singh, 2016) as well as air (Ge et al., 2018), including carbon sequestration from exhaust gases (Arenillas et al., 2005; He et al., 2013). They are primarily used in the form of zeolites, because of the ease of their synthesis (Franus et al., 2014; Kunecki et al., 2017; Wdowin et al., 2015). Other areas of application of ashes are the production of refractory materials (Vilches et al., 2002), glass ceramics (Leroy et al., 2001), automotive brake linings (Hee and Filip, 2005), bricks and tiles (Alam et al., 2013). Despite the many possible functions of ashes, new applications are still being sought, due to the fact that they are easily available and generate a large number of ashes. A review of the presented literature shows that coal fly ash can be used in the hydrogen storage process. Thanks to the silicon and aluminium contained in it, it is possible to obtain porous materials such as Zeolite Type X, A, Y, ZSM-5 which enable hydrogen uptake of approx. 3 wt% (room temperature, 70 bar) (Du and Wu, 2006). Zeolites are also used as an inorganic hard template in the process of creating subsequent hydrogen sorbents. In addition to the synthesis, carbon precursor is also needed, e.g., methanol, and the hydrogen storage capacity of these materials is estimated at 7.3% (77 K, 20 bar) (Masika and Mokaya, 2013). Effective sorbents for hydrogen uptake are metal-organic frameworks, among others, due to high specific surface area and permanent porosity. In cryogenic conditions and high pressure Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can achieve 8.45 wt% hydrogen storage capacity (Purewal et al., 2019). Activated carbon is also one of the best adsorbents for gases and is widely used (Cheng et al., 2001). In the case of conventional activated carbon, the hydrogen uptake is proportional to its surface area and pore volume. But unfortunately, a high hydrogen adsorption capacity (4–6 wt%) is only possible at very low cryogenic temperatures or very high pressures. Therefore, the use of specific organic and non-organic compounds as raw impregnates enables the production of activated carbons with controlled porous structure and high yield (up to 50 wt %) (Vasiliev et al., 2007). The innovative nature of the presented paper consisted of the comprehensive approach to the utilization one of the energy sector waste – coal fly ash as a raw material for the synthesis of hydrogen sorbents. Currently, two trends in review publications in this topic are noticed. The first is the synthesis of sorbents from coal fly ash (Bukhari et al., 2015; Ge et al., 2018; Gollakota et al., 2019; Hosseini Asl et al., 2019; Kaithwas et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2017; Wang and Wu, 2006) and the other is hydrogen storage in solid sorbents (Callini et al., 2016; Dündar-Tekkaya and Yürüm, 2016; Hu et al., 2008; Sakintuna et al., 2007; Wang and Yang, 2008; Yu et al., 2017). The purpose was to combine these two fields of knowledge and indicate possible opportunities to use coal combustion product for clean electricity in accordance with Sustainable Development and Sustainability as well as Cleaner Production. Comparison of hydrogen uptake with different coal fly ash sorbents with each other is also rare, and can provide a lot of information, e.g. which materials have the potential for hydrogen storage and what research is needed to expand existing knowledge. The review is the response to the ever-increasing attention on minimization of waste in connection with the progress of on-board hydrogen storage system for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As the hydrogen storage using sorbents is still not used on an industrial scale, the review of the presented studies is a collection of possible modern directions and guidelines for further work on these materials. The thorough literature review enabled to compare four types of sorbents, not only because of the achieved parameters, but also the method of synthesis, allowing other researchers to discern the optimal carbon material production solution. The presented review paper on coal fly ash sorbents in hydrogen storage will allow the reader to notice research gap in this area and show the directions of subsequent studies."
1,Method,"Generally, a review of the literature is defined as a more or less systematic way of collecting and synthesizing previous research (Baumeister and Leary, 1997; Denney and Tewksbury, 2013; Randolph, 2009; Tranfield et al., 2003). A thorough literature review also helps discover areas where more comprehensive research is needed, which also contributes significantly to science. The review presented was based on the guidelines prepared by Cronin and co-workers (Cronin et al., 2008). This allowed dividing the presented paper into two parts with several steps (Fig. 1 )."
2,Designing the review – part A,"2.1 Designing the review – part A In this phase, the authors wrote research questions resulting from previous experience and research in the field of synthesis of porous materials from coal fly ash, as well as the storage of hydrogen in solid sorbents. Initially, a general literature review was carried out in this area and it was found that there was no review work on the synthesis of coal fly ash solid sorbents associated with their direct use in hydrogen storage. Attention was also paid to the possibility of using fly ash. The production of hydrogen storage materials from this substrate is economical (reducing the cost of sorbet production, avoiding waste disposal costs) and environmental (ash utilization method) significance. The principal tasks then are as follows: 1) What types of solid sorbents are the best in hydrogen storage? 2) Is it possible to obtain these structures from coal fly ash? 3) What are the optimal conditions for carrying out the sorption test so that the result can be used to store hydrogen on-board? On this basis, the main criteria were used to guide the selection of literature and research to create a review article. These include current research on the synthesis of zeolites, AC, MOF and ZTC from coal fly ash; use of these structures for hydrogen storage materials on-board vehicles; hydrogen storage properties of sorbents. Data and information contained in the publication came from research papers, books, book reviews, conference papers, editorials, commentaries, dissertations and review articles."
3,Conducting the review – part B,"2.2 Conducting the review – part B The Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases were used to select the articles, which has a wide range of scientific publications from interdisciplinary journals from various scientific disciplines (Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). The literature has been found based on the keywords: “hydrogen storage”, “adsorbents from coal fly ash”, “coal fly ash application”, “hydrogen vehicles”, “zeolite templated carbons”, “activated carbons”, “zeolites”, “metal-organic framework”, “hydrogen uptake”, “gravimetric hydrogen capacity”, “specific surface area of zeolites”, “specific surface area of AC”, “specific surface area of MOF”, “specific surface area of ZTC”, “hydrogen uptake in cryogenic conditions”. These terms were searched using “AND” command in various ways to obtain the most narrowly-defined and proper results (Table 1 ). The choices of relevant articles in addition to the substantive scope were also based on the selection of publications in journals with a significant Impact Factor index. Attention was also paid to the number of citations of given publications, as well as to the international recognition of researchers in a specific field. The decisions regarding the choice of the literature items to be used were based on reliability and validity of the data. The information contained in the cited articles is presented in a clear and organized manner and often cited in another research. The articles were analysed following the criteria set out in Part A. The analysis of abstracts of selected works were carried out, assessing the usefulness of the articles. In the following part, the content of the article was checked. The type and method of obtaining sorbents, their parameters relevant for hydrogen storage, hydrogen sorption measurements and experimental conditions were investigated. In the next step of the analysis, the Snowball method (snowballing technique) was used (citations and reference lists of the selected papers were reviewed to identify new papers). Selected references were searched again to identify the most important scientific papers. For the cited articles, analyses were repeated until a complete set of research data relevant for the review was created (Fig. 2 ). Also at this step of the analysis, articles from journals with high IF index and published by authors recognized on global scale were selected for further review. In the last stage, the collected articles were synthesized in the form of a review divided into selected groups of sorbents, obtainable from fly ash, and also used for hydrogen storage. A thorough review of the latest research on the use of fly ash and hydrogen storage technologies requires the use of additional sources of information. The authors of the publication used the reports of leading organizations dealing with: the use of ashes from coal combustion – American Coal Ash Association (ACAA), research for effective climate policy – Agora Energiewende and Sandbag, development of standards – ASTM International, energy policy – Global Energy Institute, development of automotive technology and related energy technologies – US DRIVE Partnership, multinational cooperation in the field of energy technologies – International Energy Agency (IEA)."
4,Sorbents for hydrogen storage,
5,Zeolites,"3.1 Zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with a three-dimensional structure containing TO4 tetrahedra cells primary building units (PBU) in which T is Si4+ or Al3+ cation. Zeolites have a porous structure with different types of skeletons (framework) depending on the tetrahedral building units (Poudyal et al., 2015). The combination of PBUs, i.e., SiO4 4− and AlO4 5− corners thorough oxygen atoms, resulting in the formation of various forms of structure and thus, determining the size of channels or cages (Alnaimi, 2012). One of the zeolites used for hydrogen storage is a zeolite with an X-type structure from the group of faujasite (FAU) with good ion-exchange properties. In this zeolite, the cages and prisms form large cavities (supercages) with a diameter of ∼12 Å and windows with 12-membered rings of width 7.4 Å (Fig. 3 ) (Li and Wu, 2012). The advantage of using zeolites as hydrogen sorbents is, among others, the relatively simple method of their production, using waste materials, such as ashes generated during coal combustion. In addition, their synthesis requires a small amount of energy, because the main stage of obtaining zeolites – the hydrothermal reaction – takes place at low temperatures (Table 2 ). However, the great advantage of zeolites in the context of safe use is non-flammability in the hydrogen atmosphere during their sorption. This chapter focuses on the description of Zeolite X because it is one of the most popular zeolites which is obtained from coal fly ash. 3.1.1 Zeolite synthesis methods One of the most common methods of obtaining zeolites from coal ashes is the hydrothermal method (Czarna et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018; Kurniawan et al., 2018). This is a multi-phase reaction-crystallization process comprising at least one liquid and an amorphous phase, as well as a crystalline solid phase (Abdullahi et al., 2017). The simplified synthesis process is shown in Fig. 4 . Initially, the raw coal fly ash which is the source of silicon and aluminium, is dispersed in a strongly alkaline solution (usually NaOH) to extract the main components. The next step involves a heat treatment with a temperature in the range of 100–200 °C for 6–24 h. At this point, reactants in the amorphous phase begin to form crystals, until the amorphous phase is completely replaced by the crystalline phase. The last stage includes simple mechanical processes such as filtration, rinsing with distilled water and drying the obtained material. Despite the relatively simple technology of obtaining zeolites from coal fly ashes, their production process has not yet been optimized, because the mechanism of synthesis of the zeolites is not fully known. The purity of zeolites depends on the alkali concentration, temperature, the solid/liquid ratio and the Si/Al ratio (Tauanov et al., 2018). Table 2 presents sample conditions for the synthesis of zeolites, using coal ashes classified as C and F class. Often before the synthesis process, the sample is properly prepared, e.g., by screening, drying and reducing the content of Fe and Ca, using ferrite magnet or hydrochloric acids. Sometimes, a fusion process is used, i.e., sintering of ashes with hydroxide in a suitable mass ratio at a high temperature of between 700 and 1000 °C and dissolution of the sinter, which may then be used for hydrothermal synthesis. Currently, many scientific publications on hydrogen adsorption on zeolites can be found and the most frequently tested materials are Na-A, Na-X, ZSM-5 zeolites or Na–Y zeolite (Dong et al., 2007; Kurniawan et al., 2018; Langmi et al., 2005, 2003; Li and Wu, 2012; Musyoka et al., 2015a; Widiastuti et al., 2014). Among the zeolites used for hydrogen storage, much focus is given to Zeolite X whose pore diameter of 3–8 Å is suitable for 2.890 Å hydrogen molecules (Kurniawan et al., 2018). 3.1.2 Hydrogen storage in zeolites Hydrogen storage at room temperature is the most desirable for application purposes. However, the key limitation in this regard is that physical sorption is only possible at low temperatures (Walker, 2008). The solution is to use high pressure, as proved in the work of Kayiran and Darkrim (2002). In the example of Na-A zeolite, whose hydrogen adsorption at 10 bar and room temperature was about 0.2 wt%, increasing the pressure to 60 bar, led to a quadruple increase (Kayiran and Darkrim, 2002). Encapsulation and adsorption are some of the methods of hydrogen storage. Encapsulation implies the penetration of hydrogen inside empty spaces by modifying temperature and/or pressure that would not be possible under normal conditions. After returning to normal conditions, diffusion constraints cause some particles to become trapped inside the sorbent and are only released during the discharge process, which takes place using the gas expansion force (Vitillo et al., 2005). Unfortunately, the efficiency of the encapsulation process is low, because the high temperature needed for activation is not conducive to filling pores, therefore hydrogen adsorption on zeolites is considered much more frequently. Vitillo et al. (2005) compared hydrogen storage in zeolites by encapsulation and adsorption, which shows that much higher efficiency was achieved during the sorption process. For example, for Na-X zeolite, H2 capacity (1.79%) was noted at 77 K, 15 bar, while for the same type of zeolite, this value was 0.023 wt% under 573 K, 100 bar and 165 min in the case of encapsulation (Vitillo et al., 2005). The list of different types of zeolites obtained from both coal fly ashes and synthesized from pure reagents or commercially available is summarized in Table 3 . The data in Table 3 show the amount of hydrogen storage in Zeolite Type X, A, Y and ZSM-5. The tests were carried out using a wide range of temperature (from 78 K to room temperature) and pressure ranging from (1 bar–100 bar), so it is difficult to compare the results. However, it can be observed that in the most common conditions for hydrogen storage (extremely low temperature and high pressure), the values obtained are about 2 wt%."
6,Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTC),"3.2 Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTC) Some of the carbon materials are synthetic materials with a unique structure called zeolite-templated carbons (ZTC). The first attempts to prepare such a carbonaceous material with large surfaces, without activation processes, were undertaken over 20 years ago (Kyotani et al., 1997). They are formed with the introduction of a carbon precursor, e.g., methanol (Lei et al., 2007), acetonitrile (Yang et al., 2016, 2006), acrylonitrile (Kyotani et al., 1997; Pacuła and Mokaya, 2008), furfuryl alcohol (Kyotani et al., 1997; Musyoka et al., 2015b, 2015a; Pacuła and Mokaya, 2008), vinyl cyanide (Yang et al., 2016) or ethylene (Musyoka et al., 2015b, 2015a; Yang et al., 2006, 2016) to the pores of the inorganic hard template, in this case zeolite (e.g., HY, Y, X, LTA, β). As a result of the carbonization process and removing the matrix, carbon materials are obtained with a three-dimensional structure of a particular aluminosilicate – a negative replica of the zeolite template is created (Fig. 5 ). These sorbents have a significant advantage over other materials, due to the possibility of choosing a zeolite matrix with the desired micropore parameters and structure for the final product (Braun et al., 2018). Due to different synthesis conditions, zeolite-templated carbons may show differences (even if the template is the same zeolite), which is the basis for dividing them into three types: Type I – an ordered skeleton of material, analogous to the matrix; Type II – a combination of Type I with additional carbon components deposited outside the template or structure disturbances caused by template errors; Type III – unordered material (rarely treated as ZTC) (Nishihara and Kyotani, 2018). 3.2.1 Zeolite templated carbons synthesis methods There are several ways to synthesize zeolite-templated carbons: polymer carbonization, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and combinations of these two methods (Nishihara and Kyotani, 2012). Polymer carbonization is associated with the introduction of organic monomer in zeolite channels, its polymerization, and carbonization. The CVD method allows the introduction of a large amount of carbon into the zeolite matrix using small organic molecules. The combination of the above two methods makes it possible to obtain sorbents with an ordered structure and very large surfaces over 4000 m2g-1 (Matsuoka et al., 2005). An economical alternative to the synthesis of zeolite matrix, and also zeolite-templated carbons, is the use of coal ash, from which materials with satisfactory properties, associated with hydrogen storage are obtained. The synthesis of zeolites from fly ash and the preparation of zeolite-templated carbons from the fly ash-derived zeolite matrix is described by Musyoka and co-workers (Musyoka et al., 2013, 2015b; 2015a). The polymer carbonization and chemical vapour deposition were used for this purpose. In order to synthesize ZTC, zeolites should be prepared in the first place by performing the ion-exchange procedure. For this purpose, the zeolite is mixed with 1 M ammonium nitrate for 12 h, filtered and rinsed with deionized water. This process is repeated three times as a result of which the transition metals are removed. Dried samples (at 90 °C for 12 h) are calcined at 500 °C for 4 h to remove residual NH4 + ions. The direct synthesis of the sorbent starts with drying the sample at 250 °C for 12 h (Fig. 6 ). The material is impregnated with furfuryl alcohol and washed with ethanol. In the next step, the material is placed in special boats within a tube furnace to carry out the polymerization. This stage takes place at 80 °C for 24 h, after which the temperature is increased to 150 °C for the next 8 h. The polymerization takes place under an argon flow of 100 ml/min. The next step is the carbonization of the polymerized furfuryl alcohol, due to the gradual increase of the temperature (5 °C/min) to 700 °C and held for 3 h in the flow of argon. For another 3 h at 700 °C, a gas mixture of ethylene and argon in a ratio of 1:9 was introduced. The final carbonization of chemical vapour resulting in a deposition of coal, occurred at 900 °C for a further 3 h. The material was treated with hydrofluoric acid for 3 h at room temperature and then refluxed with hydrochloric acid for 3 h at 60 °C to demineralize the zeolite matrix. Finally, the material was washed in deionized water and dried at 120 °C. As a result of the procedure, the material obtained had a three times larger surface area (404.1 m2/g – zeolite (FA-S ZeoX), 1112.2 m2/g – zeolite templated carbon (FA-S ZTC)) and increased microporosity (0.17 cm3/g – zeolite (FA-S ZeoX), 0.48 cm3/g – zeolite templated carbon (FA-S ZTC)) (Musyoka et al., 2015a). The result is an increase in the hydrogen storage value (from 0.7 wt% to 1.2 wt%) (Fig. 6). Comparing ZTC from the matrix of fly-ash derived zeolite (FA-S ZeoX) and commercial zeolite (Com ZeoX), it is clear that the hydrogen adsorption in the first example quoted, is significantly lower (Table 4 , Fig. 7 ). This is due to the fact that the size of the pores is different. The ratio of micropores to mesopores in ZTC with fly-ash derived zeolite, is lower compared to ZTC from the commercial zeolite matrix. It is probably due to the dependence of Si/Al ratio (Alam et al., 2013). The blocking of the penetration of coal precursors, may occur as a result of the acceleration of the carbonization process under the influence of higher aluminium content and the deposition of carbon on the surface of aluminosilicate. 3.2.2 Hydrogen storage in zeolite-templated carbons The accumulation of hydrogen in zeolite-templated carbons is mainly due to physical sorption (Nishihara and Kyotani, 2018). Adsorption is related to the influence of interactions of Van der Waals forces between the solid surface and the hydrogen molecule. Hydrogen is deposited in the pores of carbonaceous materials. The fact that intermolecular interactions are relatively weak, is both a limitation of sorbents and an advantage, due to the reversibility of reaction and fast sorption kinetics (Suh et al., 2012). Among the advantages of zeolite-templated carbons is the possibility of obtaining very large surfaces of carbonaceous material, which can reach up to 4100 m2/g (Matsuoka et al., 2005) and effective mass transfer due to well-developed porosity in the three-dimensional structure of ZTC (Itoi et al., 2011), therefore they can compete with other carbon compounds. Zeolite templated carbons are characterized not only by high surface area and porosity, but also by hydrophobicity, thermal conductivity, high thermal and chemical stability. The hydrogen adsorption capacity is determined by the structural properties of carbonaceous materials (Table 4). Hydrogen uptake by ZTC is correlated with the volume of micropores and pore size (Lei et al., 2007). As the carbonization temperature rises, hydrogen adsorption increases simultaneously with the microporosity of the material. The surface area of the sorbent, in particular, the surface area of the micropores (Pacuła and Mokaya, 2008) and the differences in Si/Al potential (Alam and Mokaya, 2011) are also important. Generally, hydrogen uptake capacity is proportional to the surface area, according to “Chahines’s rule” which states that in 77 K for every 500 m2/g of the surface area, is 1 wt% hydrogen adsorption in carbon-based material (Masika and Mokaya, 2013; Stadie et al., 2012). The problem is that hydrogen physisorption takes place at low temperatures (most of the experiments are carried out at 77 K), therefore the capacity of hydrogen accumulation in the ZTC, decreases at ambient temperature and pressure. For the practical purposes of hydrogen storage, various pressure conditions at room temperature are tested (Nishihara et al., 2009a). Promising results are hydrogen adsorption at 30 °C under high pressure (34 MPa), which is one of the highest values, i.e., 2.2 wt% at room temperature (Stadie et al., 2012). Experiments for ZTC were also conducted at room temperature, achieving the best result at 298 K and 30 MPa equal to 1.6 wt% H2 uptake. The highest values of hydrogen accumulation, both among ZTC and other described carbon materials (MOF, zeolites, activated carbon) were observed by (Masika and Mokaya, 2013) in ZTC in a matrix of 13X zeolite (Table 4). Hydrogen uptake was 7.3 wt% at 77 K and 20 bar. In addition, despite the small pore sizes, it is possible to introduce dispersed nanoparticles into the ZTC structures. By introducing a small number of metal nanoparticles, e.g., platinum to the ZTC, the hydrogen uptake capacity is increased through the use of chemisorption and the hydrogen spill over mechanism (Nishihara et al., 2009b), which is important for storing hydrogen at room temperature. First, chemisorption occurs due to the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen molecules on the surface of the metal, followed by the displacement of hydrogen radicals into the support materials, which is referred to as the spill over mechanism. The capacity of microporous materials, in particular, pseudocapacitance, is also increased by doping with heteroatoms, most commonly nitrogen (Itoi et al., 2011)."
7,Metal-organic frameworks,"3.3 Metal-organic frameworks The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines MOFs as “coordination networks with organic ligands containing potential voids” (Batten et al., 2013). Compared to other porous materials, MOFs have a high specific surface area (up to 1000 m2/g), permanent porosity and the ability to vary the size and nature of MOF structures (Furukawa et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2012). MOF building blocks are positively charged metal ions/clusters and anion/electron rich organic ligands. They are connected by strong coordination of covalent bonds to form well-defined frames (Bakuru et al., 2019) which depends on the metal and organic building blocks, it can also depend on the type of solvent, reaction temperature, and rate of crystal growth (Suh et al., 2012). 3.3.1 Metal-organic frameworks synthesis methods Methods of obtaining MOFs include the solvothermal method, hydrothermal synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, sonochemical synthesis and mechanochemical synthesis (Dey et al., 2014). The major part of MOFs is synthesized by the liquid phase reactions that involve heating a mixture of organic linkers (bridging ligands) such as carboxylates, phosphates, sulphonates or heterocyclic compounds with a metal salt in a solvent system, that contains an ionizing solvent functionality (Newton Augustus et al., 2017). In general, the high-temperature conditions of solvothermal syntheses eliminate the solubility restrictions for the reagents (Newton Augustus et al., 2017). Chatterjee and co-workers (Chatterjee et al., 2018) describe how to obtain stable MOF-based MIL-101 (Cr)-fly ash composite containing rich Bronsted acid sites, as well as high hydrothermal stability. The general method of obtaining material is illustrated in the diagram (Fig. 8 ). Fly-ash-MOF-composite was obtained by a multi-stage synthesis, which began with the activation of fly ash by acid treatment, using sulphuric acid followed by calcination of the resulting material. The next step was to treat the previously obtained activated fly ash with terephthalic acid, glacial acetic acid and Cr(NO3)2·9H2O (Chatterjee et al., 2018). Studies on obtaining MOF composite with fly ash have shown that this method not only reduces the problem of fly ash removal but also the cost of synthesis. In addition, the obtained MOF material, enriched with fly ash can boast of recyclability of a minimum of 10 cycles, without any loss of activity or leaching effect. Another important property is this stability under both hydrothermal and acidic conditions (Chatterjee et al., 2018). 3.3.2 Hydrogen storage in metal-organic frameworks MOFs belong to one of the more promising materials used for hydrogen storage because of their ultrahigh surface area/porosity and the possibility of physisorption of hydrogen (Rosi, 2003). Storage capacities, according to DOE guidelines, have been achieved but only at cryogenic temperature (77 K) owing to the fact that hydrogen – framework interactions are typically weak van der Waals forces (Bakuru et al., 2019). In order to improve H2 uptake, the aim is to increase the specific surface area, as well as create metal centres and use of interpenetrated frameworks by linker functionalization and incorporation of metal ions/nanoparticles (Bakuru et al., 2019). The interaction energy of hydrogen with adsorbent surfaces is low (Zhao, 2004), but it is well established that there is a correlation between hydrogen uptake and BET surface area, as well as Langmuir surface area (Langmi et al., 2014). At low pressure, H2 uptake is influenced by pore size but at high pressure, it is dependent on surface area and pore volume (Lin et al., 2006). The results of the hydrogen storage tests in MOF materials, depending on temperature, pressure and BET surface area, are illustrated in Table 5 ."
8,Activated carbons (AC),"3.4 Activated carbons (AC) Activated carbon (AC) constitutes a synthetic carbon modification that contains very small graphite crystallites, as well as amorphous carbon. The diameters of pores are often less than 1 nm with a specific surface of up to 3000 m2 g−1 (Ströbel et al., 2006). 3.4.1 Activated carbon synthesis In general, activated carbon can be obtained from many carbon-containing materials. However, considering the cost-effectiveness and properties of the target product, the most common raw materials are: coal including anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite (Alfadlil et al., 2019; Harjanto et al., 2015; Koehlert, 2017); olive stones (Yakout and Sharaf El-Deen, 2016); plum, apricot, and peach stones (Rajalakshmi and Ramesh, 2017); wood (Ahmed et al., 2019) and synthetic polymers. In fact, there are two basic methods for obtaining activated carbons, i.e., chemical and physical activations. Physical activation (temperature of ∼700–1000 °C) includes the carbonization of the starting material and the activation of the carbonizate, using thermal treatment by steam and carbon dioxide (dry distillation) form carbonized organic precursors. In the chemical activation method (temperature ∼500–800 °C), dehydrating substances such as phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and zinc chloride (ZnCl2) are used for the activation of lignocellulosic materials, which have not been carbonized previously; whereas metal compounds such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) are used for the activation of coal precursors or chars. Each dehydrating substance is leached out afterwards (Ströbel et al., 2006; Yakout and Sharaf El-Deen, 2016). Activated carbon (AC) finds application in the removal of dyes, odours, tastes, and contaminants, in water purification and other decontamination processes (Matos et al., 2010). On an industrial scale, AC is also widely used as an adsorbent mainly in the purification/separation of liquids and gases, and also as a catalyst and catalyst support (Olivares-Marín et al., 2006). Very popular applications are ever emerging, particularly those concerning environmental protection and technological development (Yakout and Sharaf El-Deen, 2016). Görgülü and co-workers used activated carbon for gas adsorption (Görgülü et al., 2019b, 2019a, 2018). One of the papers concerned butane adsorption on activated carbon obtained from coconut shell and described the impact of a relative humidity of the air, temperature and gas concentration. Research results showed that relative humidity considerably decreased the adsorption of the butane and increased the adsorption of moisture (Görgülü et al., 2019b). The coconut shell-based activated carbon was also used for toluene adsorption at various temperatures. The increase in temperature caused a higher adsorption efficiency because the pore diffusion coefficient increased as well as the pore diffusion rate (Görgülü et al., 2019a). NO2 adsorption tests have shown that gases like CO2 and SO2 have a greater impact on the degree of adsorption compared to relative air humidity. Moreover, the NO2 adsorption rate decreased at lower concentrations together with increased relative humidity (Görgülü et al., 2018). 3.4.2 Hydrogen storage in activated carbons Generally, carbon-based materials attract considerable interest in many energy-related applications due to their abundance, chemical and thermal stability, processability and the possibility of tuning their textural and structural characteristics to fulfil the requirements of specific applications (Sevilla and Mokaya, 2014). Due to the high surface area and porosity of AC, it is applicable for hydrogen storage in molecular form, by both physisorption and chemisorption methods. AC, due to its high surface area and microporosity is suitable for storage hydrogen at ambient conditions. It is very important to choose the correct precursor for the right application because the variation of precursor materials allows for controlling the carbon’s pore structure (Rajalakshmi and Ramesh, 2017). Therefore, depending on the condition for the activated carbon production, it is possible to obtain different results in hydrogen sorption. Research into the storage of hydrogen in AC has been ongoing for many years and is still very popular among scientists. The first study was as early as 1980 when Carpetis and Peschka achieved 5.2 wt% hydrogen uptake (65 K; 41.5 bar) (Carpetis and Peschka, 1980). Further tests carried out using AC (Table 6 ) have shown that adsorption in activated carbon can be more efficient than compressed gas, but only at cryogenic temperatures. The specific surface area of AC and the bulk density, have been shown to have a great impact on hydrogen uptake (Bénard and Chahine, 2001). In the case of hydrogen storage in AC at room temperature, very low sorption values (average 3 wt%) have been achieved due to the weak adsorbate-adsorbent reaction between molecular H2 and the adsorbent (carbon) (Sevilla and Mokaya, 2014). Generally, under cryogenic conditions, hydrogen sorption tests are carried out at atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and moderate pressure (10–100 bar). This is also shown in the results presented in Table 6, which confirm the relationship that at extremely low temperatures, hydrogen uptake increases with the increase of the sorbent specific surface. However, it cannot be said that solely specific surface area affects the level of sorption hydrogen onto AC. Chemical activation, e.g., using KOH is also important, because the porosity increases, due to the increase of micropores in the range of 1–2 nm. In addition, it is possible to adjust the pore structure by modifying the activation temperature or changing the KOH/carbonaceous precursor weight ratio. There is also the possibility of double activation combining the chemical and physical method using CO2. This technique creates more micropores and thus increases the specific AC surface (Sevilla and Mokaya, 2014)."
9,Discussion and conclusions,"This paper presents a review of the possibilities of obtaining solid sorbents from coal fly ash, which can be used as potential hydrogen storage materials. However, when considering their application, ability temperature and pressure conditions for safe and efficient storage must be recognized. As is well known, hydrogen can occur in three states depending on temperature and pressure conditions, which is shown in the phase diagram (Fig. 9 ). Under normal conditions, hydrogen is in gaseous form, becomes liquid below a boiling point of 20 K and solid below a melting point of 14.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. When considering the use of hydrogen as a fuel, the critical parameter is the boiling point, because this determines the temperature to which it should be cooled in order to store it in the form of a liquid. Liquid hydrogen storage is problematic due to the need to maintain cryogenic conditions, which is associated with increased energy costs. The main advantage of solid sorbents in hydrogen storage is their safety of use and the fact that the physisorption process is rapid and fully reversible, but it should be noted that this storage method has many disadvantages. Therefore, the choice of technology should be based on an in-depth analysis of the problem and on determining how the disadvantages impact on the application (Broom et al., 2019; Makridis, 2016). In general, the barriers to potential hydrogen storage systems (including solid sorbents) are clearly illustrated in Table 7 . The hydrogen storage in solid sorbents by physisorption takes place mainly on the inner part which is porous. The method of interaction of molecular hydrogen on a solid sorbent surface has the character of van der Waals (dispersion) interaction, although electrostatic and orbital interactions are also observed (Broom et al., 2019). However, because hydrogen has no charge and dipole moment and these interactions are weak, the quadrupole moment is low, as well as the polarizability, which is one of the problems of storing this gas in solid sorbents. One solution is to use a low temperature of 77 K, because as the temperature decreases, the amount of hydrogen adsorbed at a certain pressure, increases. In addition, a close relationship between adsorption and pore size is observed, because, in narrow pores, the enthalpy of adsorption is higher than in the case of wide pores, which directly affects the strength of gas-solid interactions. In the case of pores with a smaller diameter, the potentials of neighbouring atoms overlap, which increases the interaction between them (Broom et al., 2019). The data presented in the review concerns gravimetric capacity. The authors chose this way of comparing solid sorbents from coal ashes because it is one of the key parameters when considering the application of hydrogen, e.g., in vehicles. Since hydrogen has a low molar mass, this affects the weight of the storage tank, which may limit the range of the hydrogen-powered vehicle. It has been shown through experimental results that a linear relationship exists between the H2 storage capacities at 77 K and the specific surface areas (Fig. 10 ). The highest hydrogen capacity value was noticed in metal-organic frameworks (8.45 wt%), but these higher storage capacities are achieved at high pressure (35 bar) not 1 bar, as would be needed for practical application. A compilation of data collected at 1 bar/77 K demonstrates reduced H2 storage capacity for MOFs, AC, ZTC and zeolites of between 0.7 wt% for zeolite X to 2.4 wt% for ZTC. However, at room temperature, none of them can meet the DOE criteria (Table 8 ). Some of the storage parameters by DOE for on-board hydrogen storage for Light-Duty Fuel Cell Vehicles are in Table 8. So far, the hydrogen storage method using sorbents has not been commercially implemented, however, laboratory tests have been carried out and are also currently in progress. One of the tests using activated carbon from coconut shells was performed by Paggiaro et al. (2010). Powdered sorbent, with a total weight of 10 kg was placed in seven pipes made of austenitic steel type 1.4571 with a length of 1 m and diameter of 80 mm. Tubes were placed inside a liquid nitrogen (LN2) vessel to maintain cryogenic conditions. Besides, copper wool was used to ensure better thermal distribution along the pipes. An illustrative scheme is shown in Fig. 11 . The experiment was carried out at 30 bar and 77 K and the mass of H2 (kg) was 0.7 (Paggiaro et al., 2010). Another laboratory test of the practical use of sorbents for hydrogen storage was carried out in the USA by HSECoE on MOF-5, also under cryogenic conditions at a pressure of 100 bar on MATI system, whose name derives from the Modular Adsorption Tank Insert heat exchanger. It differs from standard systems in that the adsorbent is not in powder form, but “compacted” in the form of discs, which allows for obtaining higher bulk density. Another difference is conductive heat exchange with a flowing, but isolated working fluid (rather than convection). The results of the test at 100 bar and 77 K was about 0.05 H2 (kg) (Veenstra et al., 2015). Therefore, current knowledge regarding the use of solid sorbents for hydrogen storage is in a continuous development phase and much research is required prior to discussing the implementation of these technologies on a larger scale. According to the DOE Hydrogen Storage Program, currently one of the most important studies in the field of hydrogen storage, is the development of an on-board automotive hydrogen storage system, that will achieve a range of at least 300 miles (Hamilton, 2012). Storage of compressed gas at room temperature and high pressure is a promising development. The density of hydrogen gas at this temperature, at a pressure of 700 bar is about 40 g/dm3 (U.S. DRIVE Partnership, 2017). Unfortunately, sorbents currently under consideration are not able to achieve the appropriate volumetric target, therefore scientists mainly focus on improving the storage volume density of these materials and also increasing their operational temperature closer to ambient, which would have a positive effect on system performance (U.S. DRIVE Partnership, 2017). The use of coal fly ash to obtain sorbents for hydrogen storage is a relatively new issue. However, the literature review presented in the paper shows how broad the scope of research on hydrogen storage in waste materials from the energy sector is. The discoveries contained in the presented paper relate to many aspects such as estimated cost of producing sorbents, the methods of synthesis, waste management, hydrogen storage capacity. Musyoka et al. (2015a) produced the low cost zeolites from fly ash with satisfactory parameters compared to commercial zeolites. In addition, the formation of zeolite x-carbon composite allows to reduce the cost of ash utilization and limit their negative impact on the environment (Widiastuti et al., 2014). The high-purity ash-derived zeolites were obtained by Kurniawan et al. (2018) in the fusion and hydrothermal reaction. The hydrogen adsorption capacity for ash zeolites was 60% higher than zeolites from pure reagents. Chatterjee et al. (2018) received MOF with fly ash. The resulting composite was characterized by high stability in hydrothermal conditions (also in an acidic environment - pH = 2.6), as well as specific surfaces up to 1943 m2/g. MOF-based MIL-101 (Cr)-fly ash composite containing rich Bronsted acid sites was obtained by a multi-stage synthesis. Activated carbon was prepared by Fierro et al. (2010) from the chemical activation of anthracites with alkali (Na and K) hydroxides. Surface areas (SBET) as high as 3220 m2/g were prepared. In the paper, it has been experimentally determined that the upper limit of hydrogen storage for ACs is 6.4 wt% for SBET of 2630 m2/g and to this value, hydrogen storage is correlated with the sorbent surface. The increase of H2 uptake is also directly related to material porosity as far as the contribution of micropore broadening is lower than that of microporosity development. Harjanto et al. (2015) studied activated carbon made of low rank coal (precursor) with the use of KOH activator. The effect of additional material treatment, i.e. the mechanical process of milling and pelletization was tested in the research. As a result of the post-treatment process, the hydrogen adsorption capacity decreased as a result of the reduction of surface area, pore diameter and pore volume. Alfadlil et al. (2019) tested the ability to accumulate hydrogen using carbon monolith. The material has a relatively small specific surface, yet it has a higher hydrogen content compared to other sorbents with larger surfaces. This phenomenon is explained by the possible influence of the density of the tested carbon monolith (1.82 g/cm3), (Musyoka et al., 2015a)."
10,Future research possibilities,"4.1 Future research possibilities Despite the fact that scientific research on the application of solid sorbents such as MOFs, ZTCs, zeolites and ACs in hydrogen storage are developed and better results have been achieved, this is insufficient with DOE assumptions. Therefore more research in this field is needed. In the case of MOFs, their modification and functionalization can be one of the ways. Moreover, the MOFs composites or hybrids are promising. In the case of ZTCs, an important issue is the increasing the binding energies thorough dipole-induced dipole interactions which may affect the application in a wider temperature range. From the point of view of on-board hydrogen storage, this is a property worth focusing on in the future research. The literature review showed that zeolites have relatively low hydrogen storage properties compared to MOFs. However promising results of hydrogen storage at room temperature and low pressure have also been published by Widiastuti and co-workers (Widiastuti et al., 2014 ). It is also worth doing research on increasing the volume of micropores and diameter which should be suitable near to the kinetic diameter of a hydrogen molecule. For activated carbons, a better understanding of the interaction between hydrogen molecules and carbon-adsorbent surface is required. This includes research into the precise location of the active sites and the activation method that affects the increase of micropores in the structure of activated carbons. Moreover, it is important to increase the interaction energy between hydrogen molecules and the framework to improve hydrogen storage at ambient temperature. In general, research on each of the described adsorbents should strive to obtain adequate isosteric heat of hydrogen adsorption, large surface area and pore volume as well as appropriate pore size. Challenges for future research should also include the cost of sorbent production, thermal stability and safety issues in the practical use of on-board systems."
11,Summary,"In trying to summarize the reviewed information discussed above the following can be stated: 1. It is possible to obtain potential hydrogen sorbents such as zeolites, zeolite templated carbons, metal-organic frameworks and activated carbons from coal fly ash. Among them, the highest hydrogen capacity for MOFs and ACs was observed. 2. The undoubted advantage of zeolites is their relatively easy and cheap method of preparation in which the raw material such as coal fly ash is dispersed in a strongly alkaline solution to extract the main components and obtain the crystalline phase. In extremely low temperature and high pressure, the H2 uptake is about 2 wt%. 3. In the case of ZTCs hydrogen uptake values are higher than for zeolites and are even 7.3 wt%. This is due to their more developed internal structure and possibilities of modification by small number of metal particles, e.g. platinum which increases chemisorption and the hydrogen spillover mechanism. 4. MOFs belong to one of the more promising materials for hydrogen storage because of their ultrahigh surfaces area, porosity and the possibility of physisorption of hydrogen. The linker functionalization and incorporation of metal ions/nanoparticles improve the specific surface area and create new metal centres. It was reported that in cryogenic conditions and high pressure Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can achieve 8.45 wt% hydrogen storage capacity 5. Thanks to the activation, for example by using hydroxides, the carbon based materials are rich in micropores, which increases the hydrogen uptake. Hydrogen uptake values at ambient temperature and moderate pressure range between 1 wt% and 2 wt%. 6. Although the discussed materials have important hydrogen storage properties like high porosity, large specific surface area and thermal stability they still do not meet DOE requirements for on-board hydrogen storage. 7. Review of papers in the field of hydrogen storage in solid sorbents also using coal fly ash as a raw material for their synthesis showed that there is a need for further research. Relatively few hydrogen sorption tests under the conditions specified by the DOE have been carried out. This is important in the practical use of sorbents in on-board systems. More attention should also be paid to the use of waste materials such as coal fly ash for the synthesis of hydrogen sorbents, which promotes Sustainable Development as well as Cleaner Production. 8. Detailed SWOT and cost-benefit analysis are needed for the potential solution of hydrogen storage in fly ash solid sorbents."
