0,Introduction,"It is widely accepted that the solution of the global warming problem will be a combination of various contributions ranging from carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to improved carbon efficiency of fossil fuels, to large use of renewable energy sources (in the long term). Among the various strategies proposed, CCS seems to be a good candidate for CO2 emissions mitigation; however, CCS has to be regarded as a mid-term solution as long as the energy economy is based on fossil fuels: CCS will be used as long as other technologies such as large-scale exploitation of renewable sources and nuclear fusion are still under development. CCS consists of two challenging processes, viz. carbon dioxide capture and its sequestration (mineralization or storage). In this review only carbon capture is discussed, while sequestration (perhaps in off shore geological formations) is a process with its own technological and societal challenges. Three main technological paths have been proposed for CCS from fossil-fuel fired power stations, namely the post-combustion capture, the pre-combustion decarbonization and the oxyfuel combustion route (see Fig. 1). This review focuses on separation and production of hydrogen thus can be applied to the decarbonization route. Hydrogen from fossil fuels can also be used to increase the efficiency of the system. An example of increased efficiency is the conversion of raw material into hydrogen and its use in fuel cells. In fact, for example in automotive applications, electromotor combined with hydrogen powered fuel cells shows an overall efficiency (40–55%) significantly higher than internal combustion engines (13–30%). Pt based catalyst are commonly used in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the performance of the catalyst decrease dramatically if carbon monoxide (a main product of most of the conversion technologies) or hydrogen sulfide is present. For this reason, the interest in the production of ultra-pure hydrogen has strongly increased in the last years. It has been demonstrated that by using pure hydrogen produced by membrane reactors in co-generation units the total efficiency will be increased by roughly 10% (Roses et al., 2010, 2011). Traditionally, hydrogen is produced via steam reforming (SR) of hydrocarbons such as methane, naphtha oil or methanol/ethanol. But on industrial scale most of the hydrogen (more than 80%) is currently produced by SR of natural gas carried out in large multi-tubular fixed-bed reactors. In small-scale applications, two other main alternatives are generally considered along with SR: partial oxidation reactions, with a significantly lower efficiency than SR, and auto-thermal reforming, where the partial oxidation (exothermic reaction) and SR (endothermic reaction) are carried out in the same reactor. The main drawbacks of conventional SR, partial oxidation and auto-thermal conventional reactors are that all these reactions are equilibrium limited and (even in case of complete fuel conversion) produce a hydrogen rich gas mixture containing carbon oxides and other by-products. Consequently, in order to produce pure hydrogen, these chemical processes are carried out in a number of reaction units (typically high temperature reformer, high and low temperature shift reactors) followed by separation units (mostly pressure swing adsorption). The large number of different process steps decreases the system efficiency and makes scale-down uneconomical. A typical reaction process scheme is reported in Fig. 2. Using this process, high hydrogen yields are achieved, but costly high temperature heat exchangers and complex energy integration among different process units are required to obtain the hydrogen at the desired high purity. Among different technologies related to production, separation and purification of H2, membrane technologies seem to be the most promising and membrane separation is nowadays increasingly considered as a good candidate for substituting conventional systems. The specific thermodynamic constrains limiting traditional reactors can be circumvented by using innovative integrated systems, such as the so-called membrane reactors (MRs), engineering systems in which both reaction and separation are carried out in the same device (see Fig. 3). In comparison to a conventional configuration in which a reactor is combined with a downstream separation unit, the use of membrane reactors can bring various potential advantages such as reduced capital costs (due to the reduction in size of the process unit), improved yields and selectivities (due to the equilibrium shift effect) and reduced downstream separation costs (separation is integrated). The success of membrane reactors for hydrogen production depends crucially on: (i) the advances in the membrane production methods for the production of thin membranes with high hydrogen fluxes and high hydrogen perm-selectivities; (ii) the design of innovative reactor concepts which allow the integration of separation and energy exchange, the reduction of mass and heat transfer resistances and the simplification of the housing and sealing of the membranes. In this review we will first discuss recent advances in (high temperature) membranes to be applied in hydrogen production units, categorized into dense metal membranes, microporous membranes and proton conducting membranes. An overview of the most permeable and selective membranes is given together with a collection of commercial membranes for hydrogen production. Subsequently, recent developments in membrane reactors design will be highlighted and the application of membrane reactors for hydrogen production from different feedstock will be discussed."
1,Hydrogen separation membranes,"Membranes are basically barriers that allow the flow of some components of a feed gas mixture stream. The stream containing the components that permeate through the membrane is called permeate and the stream containing the retained components is called retentate, as shown in Fig. 3. Membranes for hydrogen separation should have the following characteristics: 1. High selectivity towards hydrogen. 2. High flux. 3. Low cost. 4. High mechanical and chemical stability. There have been many applications of catalytic inorganic membrane reactors for reactions involving hydrogen, such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (Dittmeyer et al., 2001; Gimeno et al., 2009), methane steam reforming (Matsumura and Tong, 2008), and water–gas shift (Bi et al., 2009)."
2,Membrane materials,"2.1 Membrane materials Regarding the type of materials, hydrogen separation membranes may be classified into the following categories: polymeric membranes, porous membranes, dense metal membranes and proton conducting membranes. Table 1 shows a comparison between the different membrane types for hydrogen separation. The most important parameters when comparing membranes are the perm-selectivity, the flux and the temperature range at which the membranes can be applied. In order to obtain high purity hydrogen-permeate streams, dense metal membranes (mainly palladium alloys) and dense ceramic membranes are currently the most suitable materials due to their high hydrogen selectivity. Pd–alloys (mainly Pd–Ag, Pd–Cu and Pd–X–Au) are used to decrease the embrittlement problem and to decrease the poisoning of the membrane when in contact with H2S and other pollutants (such as CO). Microporous ceramic membranes are promising materials for high purity hydrogen production and separation. However, these membranes separate hydrogen by size exclusion and thus selectivity is still limited compared to more expensive dense inorganic membranes. Nowadays, the selective layers are thin (for instance, Pd membranes are now produced with thicknesses in the order of 1μm) and therefore the cost of the selective layer is low or moderate compared to the entire cost of the membrane."
3,Membrane configurations,"2.2 Membrane configurations 2.2.1 Geometry Membrane geometries may be planar, tubular (that includes tubes, capillaries and hollow fibers), plate and frame and spiral wound. Currently the most commonly used geometries for gas separation are planar and tubular. The planar membranes are often used in earlier laboratory research and development studies, while for medium scale and industrial scale the tubular membranes are the most preferred option (due to their higher surface area-to-volume ratio in comparison to planar membranes). 2.2.2 Unsupported and supported membranes The membranes may be classified into unsupported and supported membranes. Unsupported membranes need to be thick self-standing films (>50μm thick) in order to have a minimum mechanical stability. The main drawback of these membranes is their low hydrogen permeance. Moreover, in the case of using an expensive membrane material the cost of the whole membrane will be sharply increased by increasing the membrane thickness. Thus there is a threshold between membrane mechanical stability and membrane thickness (and thus flux and costs). For this reason it is foreseen that the first industrially available membranes will be supported membranes. Supported membranes consist of a thin selective film deposited onto a support that provides mechanical stability. Thus, the hydrogen permeance of the membrane will be higher so that less membrane area is required and the whole membrane cost will be lower than that for unsupported membranes. However, in the total membrane cost, the cost of the support also becomes important. Especially when very thin film membranes are selected, the support pore size should be much lower and the surface much smoother, so that its cost will increase. There are mainly two types of porous support materials: metallic and ceramic. Ceramic supports typically have better surface quality providing membranes with thinner selective layers. However, they are more fragile. Currently, the ceramic supports that are commercially available are tubes and hollow fibers. As an example, Inopor produces and offers ceramic tubular supports of different ceramic materials and pore sizes (http://www.inopor.com/). In general, ceramic tubular supports consist of a porous ceramic substrate processed by extrusion and a porous low roughness ceramic layer deposited onto the support by, for example, sol–gel techniques. On the other hand, hollow fibers are usually prepared by spinning (Li, 2007b). Metallic supports are more robust than ceramic but the commercial ones, mainly tubular, have lower surface qualities. This is due to the fact that they are not used as membrane supports but rather as particle filters. GKN (http://www.gkn-filters.de/), Mott (http://www.mottcorp.com/), and Pall (http://www.pall.com) are known metallic support suppliers. Some research groups are developing hollow fiber supports (both ceramics and metallic) in order to increase the surface area to volume ratio and also improve the surface quality (Luiten-Olieman et al., 2012). In the case in which both the selective layer and the support are metallic and the entire membrane is used at temperatures above the Tamman temperature of one of the metallic parts, it is necessary to position an inter-metallic diffusion barrier layer between the metallic support and the metallic selective layer. This is a common situation in dense metal composite membranes used for high temperature reforming reactions. In this case the materials used as barrier layer are: ZrO2 (Tarditi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2008a), YSZ (Sanz et al., 2011, Li et al., 2007a), TiO2 (Li et al., 2008b), CeO2 (Qiao et al., 2010) and Al2O3 (Dardas et al., 2009). The typical deposition technologies used are: atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) (Sanz et al., 2011; Huang and Dittmeyer, 2007), wet powder spraying (WPS) (Zhao et al., 2004) and powder suspension suction (Chi et al., 2010)."
4,Dense metal membranes,
5,General comments,"3.1 General comments Dense metal membranes are commonly used for high purity hydrogen production. The mechanism of hydrogen permeation through dense metal membranes has been extensively studied. It is well known that it generally follows a solution–diffusion mechanism. The steps involved in hydrogen transport from a high to a low pressure gas region are the following (Lewis, 1967; Fig. 4): (a) diffusion of molecular hydrogen to the surface of the metal membrane, (b) reversible dissociative adsorption on the metal surface, (c) dissolution of atomic hydrogen into the bulk metal, (d) diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the bulk metal, (e) association of hydrogen atom on the metal surface, (f) desorption of molecular hydrogen from the surface, (g) diffusion of molecular hydrogen away from the surface. Common dense metal layer deposition technologies include physical vapor deposition (PVD, including magnetron sputtering, thermal evaporation or pulsed laser evaporation), chemical vapor deposition (CVD or MOCVD), electroless plating (ELP), electroplating and diffusion welding (Iniotakis et al., 1987). Each technology has its strengths and weaknesses; therefore, there is a trend of tailoring the deposition technology to the features of the support in order to obtain a suitable composite membrane. The most widely used preparation technology for dense metal layers is ELP due to its ability of covering supports with complex geometries, the simplicity of the required equipment and its low cost (absence of electrodes or electrical source) (Mallory and Hajdu, 1990). On the other hand, PVD magnetron sputtering is a very attractive deposition technology because it could provide thinner uniform layers (down to only few nanometers), much lower than the thickness achieved with the ELP technique, with a controlled microstructure and composition across of these coatings. Other important advantage of PVD versus ELP is its environmental friendly operation, without producing waste liquids from chemical baths (Klette, 2005). Among dense metal materials used for hydrogen purification, developments in Pd and Pd alloys have been carried out for a long time (Buxbaum, 1999; Grashoff et al., 1983; Holleck, 1970). The most important problem associated with the use of pure Pd membranes is the hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon. Operation with hydrogen at a temperature below 300°C and a pressure below 2MPa, leads to the nucleation of the β-hydride phase from the α-phase resulting in severe lattice strains. In this case a pure palladium membrane becomes brittle after a few α↔β cycles (Hsieh, 1989). Another important problem is the palladium surface poisoning, which can be more significant for thin metal membranes, by sulfur compounds (Edlund and Pledger, 1994), CO (Amandusson et al., 2000), H2O (Li et al., 2000), chlorine, carbon, unsaturated hydrocarbons, etc.. In order to avoid hydrogen embrittlement, poisoning and reduce membrane cost, palladium can be alloyed with other metallic elements such as Ag, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pt and Y (Bryden and Ying, 2002; Qiao et al., 2010; Uemiya et al., 2007) or the palladium grains can be used in nanometer sized (Pacheco Tanaka et al., 2006). On the other hand, there is a group of metals called refractory metals (e.g., vanadium, niobium, and tantalum) that have much higher permeability at these lower temperatures in comparison to palladium. These metals are much cheaper and have greater tolerances to high temperatures compared to palladium. Nevertheless, producing membranes with only these metals (as pure components) is hindered by the high embrittlement produced at room temperature in the presence of 6.9 barhydrogen. On the contrary, several alloys of these metals are also non-embrittling, making them good candidates for hydrogen purification membranes (Dolan, 2010; Dolan et al., 2011; Ishikawa et al., 2011; Paglieri et al., 2011; Wolden et al., 2013). These metals are not normally used alone for hydrogen permeation also because of poor surface properties (particularly formation of surface oxide layers) that reduce hydrogen transport. When palladium or palladium alloys are applied over the surface of refractory alloys (Makrides et al., 1967; Paglieri et al., 2009), forming metal–metal matrix membranes, the surface barriers are removed and hydrogen permeation follows the trend shown in Fig. 5. As the number of possible combinations of these metals is enormous, a modeling approach can help in identifying the most suitable combination of metals for producing hydrogen membranes. An interesting approach towards the definition of suitable modeling tools for this kind of study is given by the application of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the behavior of binary or ternary alloys with pure hydrogen or with gas mixtures. For example the group of Sholl published a series of papers showing the potentiality of DFT in predicting the solubility/diffusivity of hydrogen in different alloys, resulting in interesting guidelines for the future membrane production. In their works on PdCu based ternary alloys (Semidey-Flecha et al., 2010, Kamakoti and Sholl, 2003, 2006) the authors applied DFT to find an effective ternary additive to the PdCu alloy to retain the good poisoning resistance of the binary alloy while increasing the total permeability of the resulting membrane. It was found that among different additives (such as Ni, Au, Ag, Rh, Pt) an addition of Au or Ag can increase the permeability of the alloy of up to 5 times. They also found out that for this PdCuAg alloys, the increase of solubility due to the increase of Ag is more dominant on the increase of permeability compared to the effect of diffusivity. This means that for PdCu ternary alloys an additive that increases the solubility of hydrogen is to be preferred. Solubility of hydrogen is also important for binary alloys; Sonwane et al. (2006) have shown by using DFT calculations that the maximum solubility for PdAg is found at 30% Ag while for PdAu the maximum is found at 20% Au. For PdAg (30% Ag) the hydrogen solubility has been found to be 10 times higher than for pure Pd. Hao and Sholl (2011) also applied DFT to evaluate the permeability of amorphous metal membranes (such as ZrCu based membranes). The results in this case show that the permeability is not directly related to the solubility of hydrogen, giving guidelines also for the design of amorphous metal membranes. DFT calculations have also been applied to evaluate the effect of contaminants in the gas mixture on the hydrogen permeability (Ling and Sholl, 2009; Ozdogan and Wilcox, 2010; Gallucci et al., 2007a,b); it has been found that CO affects the permeation of hydrogen especially because there is a preferential adsorption of CO molecules on the same sites (hollow and bridge) used by H2; moreover CO can jump between the two sites and this is why a small amount of CO is enough to deteriorate the hydrogen permeability (Gallucci et al., 2007a,b). Ozdogan and Wilcox showed that the adsorption of H2S on the surface of the membrane depends on the metal used to alloy palladium. In particular they found a H2S binding tendency such as Cu<Pd<Nb. This is why PdCu have are more resistant to H2S poisoning. Ling and Sholl (2009) showed that any sulfide formation on the membrane will decrease enormously the permeability of the membrane especially due to the extremely slow diffusion of H through the sulfide layer. Regarding the experimental works on membranes, some of the most relevant current developments on dense metal membranes for hydrogen production are presented afterwards. Pd–Ag alloy membranes are usually prepared by electroless plating using a sequential deposition of the two metals. This procedure gives the deposition of bi-layered metal films and hence a high temperature and longer time is required for the complete inter-phase diffusion of two metals, in addition the precise control of Pd/Ag ratio in the membrane is difficult to obtain. At AIST-Japan, Pacheco Tanaka et al. (2005) developed a method for the simultaneous plating of Pd-Ag with the desired composition of metals. This was achieved by the uniform deposition of nano-particles of Pd nuclei on the surface of the substrate and the careful control of the composition of the plating solution. Alloying of Pd and Ag was possible under lower temperature and short heat treatment. The same group at AIST also prepared thin Pd–Au alloy membranes by electroless plating of Au on a Pd membrane; the amount of Au in the alloy was controlled by adjusting the concentration of gold in the plating solution (Okazaki et al., 2008a). Okazaki and Pacheco Tanaka also studied the effect of the substrate on the permeation of hydrogen at high temperature, they demonstrated that at temperatures higher than 650°C alumina reacts with hydrogen and the Pd–Al alloy formed decrease the permeation of hydrogen in that extent that at 850°C no permeation occurs. On the other hand, YSZ is more stable and can be used until 750°C. (Okazaki et al., 2008b, 2009). The same group in Japan, developed hydrogen permeable membrane of novel configuration (pore fill type membrane); in this configuration, palladium particles are filled in the nano-size pores of ceramic (γ-Al2O3) layer located under the top surface (Pacheco Tanaka et al., 2006). This “pore fill” configuration provides advantages of improved toughness on handling since palladium layer is not exposed on the surface. Moreover nano-size palladium grains confined in the nanopore substantially suppress the internal stress associated with α–β phase transition. This Pd membrane is tolerable below the critical temperature, where fatal damage occurs for usual. Almost constant hydrogen permeation and selectivity were maintained for more than 24h at 50°C and 100kPa pressure difference. At 300°C and 4bar of pressure difference, the hydrogen permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity of this membrane were 1.3×10−6 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and >1000, respectively. Due to the difference of expansion coefficient between Pd and alumina, nanoporous alumina filled with Pd has low stability at temperatures higher than 350–400°C. To overcome this problem, a membrane was prepared by filling palladium into the nano pores of YSZ–γ-Al2O3. The Pd–YSZ–Al2O3 composite membrane revealed excellent thermal stability allowing long-term operation at elevated temperature (500°C). This has been attributed to improved fracture toughness of YSZ–Al2O3 layer and matching of thermal expansion coefficient between palladium and YSZ (Pacheco Tanaka et al., 2008). At 425°C and 4bar of pressure difference, the hydrogen permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity of this membrane were 1.6×10−6 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and 300, respectively. Various Pd alloys have been developed and tested as membrane by the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). Supported membranes have been obtained with Pd–Au, Pd–Cu and Pd–Ru alloy supported on commercial alumina and zirconia-coated porous stainless steel tubular substrates using an ELP technique (Roa et al., 2009). The most promising result has been obtained by using an alumina supported Pd–Au membrane. A H2 flux of 482mlmin−1 cm−2 (STP) and a H2/N2 ideal selectivity of 1000 at a temperature of 400°C and a partial pressure difference of around 7bar. On the other hand, a 2.3μm thick Pd–Au membrane supported on zirconia-coated porous stainless steel achieved a H2 flux of 1.01molm−2 s−1 and a H2/N2 ideal selectivity of 82,000 at 1.38bar and 400°C (Hatlevik et al., 2010). At these experimental conditions no flux reduction was observed for this Pd–Au membrane for WGS mixture compared to a pure H2 feed gas. This means that no CO adsorption on the membrane surface occurs at these temperatures, which makes the membrane very attractive for WGS reactions or pre-combustion CO2 capture plants. A great research effort on novel membranes has been devoted in China where the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) is developing supported composite Pd–Au alloy membranes on alumina substrates using ELP technique (Goldbach and Xu, 2011). Very thin membranes with high fluxes have been produced by DICP. They reported a remarkable H2 permeability of 1.3×10−8 molmm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 400°C attained by a 5μm Pd–Au composite membrane. The H2/N2 ideal selectivity was around 1100 at 500°C. The H2 flux achieved with a 2–3μm thick Pd–Au composite membrane was 0.62molm−2 s−1 at 500°C. The H2/N2 ideal selectivity was around 1400. Moreover cycling in hydrogen between 250 and 450°C had no significant effect on hydrogen and nitrogen permeation rates showing that mechanical stress caused by the differing thermal expansion of the joined materials is within the tolerance of the metal/ceramic composite membrane up to those temperatures (Shi et al., 2010). SINTEF (Norway) has developed a two-step technique for manufacturing very thin defect free palladium-based hydrogen separation membranes. First, a defect-free Pd–alloy thin film is prepared by PVD magnetron sputtering onto a silicon wafer (surface with minimum roughness). In a second step, the film is removed from the wafer and used as membrane. These films may either be used as self-supported membrane or be integrated with various supports of different pore sizes and geometries. This allows the preparation of thin (∼1–2μm), high-flux membranes supported on macroporous substrates avoiding all the mass transfer resistances given by microporous supports or problems with interdiffusion layers. It must be highlighted that according to the DFT calculations of Ling and Sholl, for membranes of 1μm, the desorption resistance completely dominates the permeation at temperatures below 230°C and it has an important contribution at temperatures below 450°C. Thus, at these temperatures smaller thicknesses will not improve the permeation flux of the membrane while will surely deteriorate the stability of the membrane. In pure hydrogen, and at 400°C and a H2 pressure difference of 25bar, the H2 permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity were 1.46×10−2 molm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 and 2900. (Peters et al., 2011a). In WGS conditions (57.5% H2, 18.7% CO2, 3.8% CO, 1.2% CH4 and 18.7% steam) SINTEF membranes have shown a H2 permeance of 1.1×10−3 molm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 400°C and 26bar feed pressure. No membrane failure was detected operating the membrane for more than 1 year using WGS and H2–N2 feed mixtures (Iaquaniello et al., 2011). SINTEF is also working in the development of Pd-based binary and ternary alloy membranes for H2 separation (Peters et al., 2011b, 2012). Research on self-supported membrane foils has been carried out at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). The institute used a magnetron sputtering technique to develop Pd–Au and Pd–Au–Pt foils. SwRI tested Pd–Au–Pt (70–20–10%) foils at 400°C, 12.7bar with feed gas composition of 50% H2, 30% CO2, 19% H2O, and 1% CO (Coulter et al., 2012), and a H2 flux was approximately 0.212mol/m2/s. Currently, SwRI is developing amorphous Zr-based alloys, specially focusing on Zr–Cu based ternary alloys. The reason for the development of these alloys is that they showed good results (i.e., Zr30Cu60Ti10) in previous computational calculations predicting H2 flux through ternary alloys as functions of operating temperature, H2 feed pressure, membrane thickness, and trans-membrane pressure drop to advance testing (CO2 Handbook, 2011). Important advances on membrane preparation have been achieved at the center for inorganic membranes of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). The group directed by Prof. Ma is developing Pd-based membranes on tubular stainless steel or alloy supports (such as, SS 316L, Hastelloy and Inconel) by the ELP technique. WPI achieved a H2 flux of 0.098molm−2 s−1 and a H2/He selectivity of around 4500 at 450°C and 1.03barΔP with a 7μm thick Pd membrane with an Inconel support shown in Fig. 6 (http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress09/ii_d_1_ma.pdf). WPI is also developing supported molten metal membranes, consisting of low-melting non-precious metals and its alloys (e.g., Sn, In, Ga, Bi) as supported thin films (CO2 Handbook, 2011). Moreover, WPI has also built an engineering-scale prototype membrane with 8.8μm thickness, 2 in. outer diameter, and 6 in. length. WPI has demonstrated long-term membrane testing with total test duration of 63 days at 450°C, 1.03barΔP, 0.303molm−2 s−1H2 flux, 99.99% purity. This flux is equivalent to approximately 1.286molm−2 s−1 at 6.9barΔP (Hydrogen from Coal Program, 2010). Currently, WPI is performing long-term tests with Pd-based membranes under mixed gas streams (Guazzone et al., 2012; Augustine et al., 2012)."
6,Progresses in commercialization of dense metal membranes,"3.2 Progresses in commercialization of dense metal membranes There are different companies working on the commercialization of dense metal membranes for hydrogen separation/production. In the following, the main progresses achieved are presented. Some of these commercial membranes have been successfully used in fluidized membrane reactors for methane steam reforming and in membrane separators in a pilot plant for 20m3/h hydrogen production as described below. 3.2.1 CRI/Criterion CRI/Criterion (a company owned by Shell) is in the process of commercializing Pd and Pd–alloy membranes on sintered porous metal supports as published in a report (Shell Impact, 2010). CRI/Criterion has produced membranes of this type as large as 2 in. OD by 48 in. L, by welding two separate 24 in. L sections. The support is polished with a robotized machine before the Pd deposition. The H2 permeance of these membranes varies in a range of 40–70Nm3 m−2 h−1 bar−0.5. Both hydrogen flux and separation selectivity are stable at temperatures of 300–500°C and differential pressures of 26–42bar. H2 purity of >99% has been demonstrated for periods exceeding 4000h in high temperature gas separations. In Fig. 7 some manufactured membranes are shown. 3.2.2 ECN The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) produces and offers a line of hydrogen separation modules (Hysep) on a pre-commercial basis for evaluation purposes as described in its website (http://www.hysep.com/). There are three modules available: Hysep 108 (area of 0.04m2), Hysep 308 (0.1m2) and Hysep 1308 (0.5m2) ( Fig. 8). The Hysep modules use palladium composite membranes composed by a 3–9μm thick palladium layer deposited by ELP onto a porous ceramic alumina support. The nominal capacity of the largest membrane module (Fig. 5) equals 3.5–6Nm3 h−1, based on the obtained hydrogen flux applying reformate with 33% H2, an inlet pressure of 25bar and H2 outlet pressure of 4bar. Lifetimes of several thousands of hours have been shown under different conditions and purities that can reach the range from 99.5% to 99.995% depending on the initial composition. ECN is also developing novel Pd alloy composite membranes (e.g. Pd–Ag, Pd–Cu; Acha et al., 2011). 3.2.3 Eltron Research, Inc. Eltron Research, Inc. has developed alloy-based membranes and has developed a separator unit rated to produce 6.8kg/day of hydrogen (Hydrogen from Coal Program, 2010; CO2 Handbook, 2011). Eltron’s best alloy membrane has demonstrated a H2 flux rate of 809mLmin−1 cm−2 (STP) at 400°C and 6.9barΔP with H2 pure gas feeding. Eltron has tested the membranes under WGS feed stream conditions; tubular membranes were successfully tested for greater than 300h with a feed gas composition of 50% H2, 29% CO2, 19% H2O, 1% CO, and 1% He. 3.2.4 Green Hydrotec As shown on its website (www.grnhydrotec.com), Green Hydrotech has developed Pd and Pd–Cu membranes on porous stainless steel tubes ( Fig. 9) with an extremely high H2/N2 perm-selectivity (>100,000) and these membranes provide in situ purification of hydrogen in a steam reformer for high purity hydrogen (99.996+%). 3.2.5 Hy9 Hy9 is commercializing HPSTM hydrogen purifiers based on planar palladium alloy metal membranes ( Fig. 10), as described on its website (http://hy9.com/). Hy9’s membrane purifiers tolerate a wide variety of feed stocks and gas mixtures, having been successfully deployed with systems utilizing methanol, natural gas, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, ammonia borane, and a variety of hydrides. The optimal operating temperature conditions range from 300 to 350°C and at inlet pressures from 3.4 to 17.2barg depending on specific requirements. 3.2.6 M&P Media and Process Technology, Inc. (M&P) (Liu et al., 2010) has developed a Pd-based membrane module that is capable of producing a H2 flow of 0.575molm−2 s−1 and H2/N2 selectivity of over 1000. The Pd membrane composite membranes consist of a ∼2μm thick Pd layer deposited onto a porous ceramic support with a H2 flux of 0.575molm−2 s−1 at 1.38bar. Currently, tests involving a WGS membrane reactor with this module are being carried out. 3.2.7 MRT Membrane Reactor Technologies (MRT) is developing a range of hydrogen purifiers to provide high-purity hydrogen and to recover hydrogen from mixed gas streams, as described on its website (http://www.membranereactor.com/). MRT produces membranes either as rolled foils or as deposited thin films (8–15μm). While palladium-based foils of common compositions are available commercially, MRT has developed its own alloy compositions for added performance and robustness. In addition, a patent-pending bonding technique has been developed to permanently attach membranes to support modules with a perfect, hydrogen-tight seal. For membranes thinner than 15μm, MRT uses a proprietary coating technique (Iaquaniello et al., 2011). MRT achieved a H2 flux of 95Nm3 m−2 h−1 with a 5μm thick Pd membrane supported on alumina-coated porous stainless steel tubular substrate at 550°C and hydrogen pressure difference of 3.4bar (Li et al., 2007c). 3.2.8 Pall Corporation Pall Corporation produces and offers Pd–alloy composite tubular membranes on a pre-commercial basis ( Fig. 11), as published on its website (Pall.com). The support of this membrane is composed of YSZ inter-diffusion barrier layer deposited onto a porous stainless steel tube. Pall has a couple of techniques to deposit its 1–5μm Pd–Au layer. Pall’s current membrane flux performance and H2/Ar ideal selective are 295–354mLmin−1 cm−2 (STP) and 10,000–20,000 at a temperature of 400°C and feed pressure of 1.38barg (with permeate atmospheric) (CO2 Handbook, 2011, Pall.com, Damle, A. 2010). Development of a Pd-alloy composition tolerant up to 100ppm H2S is currently ongoing (Bredesen et al., 2011). 3.2.9 REB REB Research and Consulting produces and offers metal membranes made of 1.5–1.6μm thick Pd-coated refractory metal tubes (3/8 in. OD × 0.007 in. wall) or palladium–silver alloy tubes (1/8 in. OD × 0.003 in.), as described on its website (REBresearch.com). Palladium–silver alloy membranes are available plain, coated with palladium-grey, or coated with palladium–copper alloy. The average membrane permeabilities of V–Ti based membranes are 0.15molmm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 600°C and 0.015molmm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 300°C. For V–Nb membranes, the permeabilities are 0.2molmm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 429°C and 0.19molmm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 at 340°C (REBresearch.com, Buxbaum 2008). On the other hand, REB is developing metal–metal matrix membranes which consist of a high permeable H2 metal layer coated with Pd–alloys on each side, with the aim of reducing membrane cost and increasing durability. A H2 flux of 0.2molm−2 s−1 was achieved with a 0.5μm Pd–Cu coated on each side of a high permeable metal membrane (B2) at 400°C and 3.03bar ΔP with feed gas mixture containing H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and H2S. These membranes have resisted poisoning from 50h with 100ppm H2S. These novel membranes will be integrated in a disc membrane reactor to be tested with coal–gas (CO2 Handbook, 2011). REB membranes have also been successfully tested in fluidized bed membrane reactors for hydrogen production as discussed in the following sections. The double membrane layer was able to assure a high selectivity for long time under bubbling fluidization conditions (Roses et al.). It should also be highlighted that these membranes have been successfully tested at temperatures up to 650°C without deteriorating the perm-selectivity of the membranes which is probably the higher temperature used so fare for Pd-based membranes and it is also the temperature window that allow an effective integration of Pd membranes into methane reformers (Gallucci et al., 2008a,b; Roses et al.). 3.2.10 Tokyo Gas Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. has been developing membrane reformers (MRF) for hydrogen production with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. since 1992. Recently, Tokyo Gas developed a MRF test system with a hydrogen production of 40 Nm3/h, hydrogen purity of 99.99%, and hydrogen production efficiency of 70% (Shirasaki et al., 2009). The reformer has 112 reactor tubes, each of which has two planar-type membrane modules composed of stainless steel supports and Pd–Y(Gd)–Ag alloy films of less than 20μm thick (Sakamoto et al., 1992). The longest operation time for this membrane reformer was 3000 h. An interesting evolution of the membrane modules introduced by Tokio Gas company is what they called membrane-on-catalyst (MOC) module. This is a Pd-based membrane prepared on the porous surface of the tubular structured catalyst that has catalytic activity for steam reforming reaction. The important aspect to be taken into account when preparing MOCs is the thermal expansion of the catalyst that has to match with the membrane material, while also selecting a proper porosity, mechanical strength and thermal conductivity of the catalyst (Yasuda et al., 2006). This concept simplifies enormously the membrane module design while also reducing the mass transfer resistances otherwise affecting the packed bed membrane modules used in their hydrogen generator. 3.2.11 UTRC United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) is developing a palladium copper (Pd–Cu) trimetallic alloy hydrogen separator for central H2 production from coal gasification-derived syngas (CO2 Handbook, 2011). UTRC has tested five separators using PdCuTM alloy which showed increased surface stability in bench-scale tests (Hydrogen from Coal Program, 2010). UTRC’s current membrane flux performance is approximately 0.230molm−2 s−1 at a temperature of 400°C and feed pressure of 6.9bar). This membrane has also shown pressure capability up to 27.6bar, sulfur tolerance of 20ppmv, CO tolerance and the production of at least 99.5% pure H2. Three types of commercial membranes (MRT, ECN and one from a not specified Japanese company) are being tested it a 20m3/h hydrogen production plant at Chieti (Italy) by Technimont-KT (De Falco et al., 2011). Preliminary experimental tests have confirmed the potential of membrane technology with an overall conversion of approximately 57.3% was achieved at 600°C, 26% higher than what was achieved in a conventional reformer. This conversion is expected to be even increased up to 62.8% by doubling the membrane surface by a factor of two. Moreover, the effect of operating temperature and gas mixture space velocity have been evaluated over a period of 1000h without detrimental effects on the membranes performance."
7,Microporous membranes,"Microporous membranes are referred to as those with a pore diameter smaller than 2nm. Regarding the structure, the microporous membranes for H2 separation may be classified into crystalline (zeolites and MOF) and amorphous (such as silica, carbon, etc.)."
8,Zeolite membranes,"4.1 Zeolite membranes Zeolites are microporous crystalline aluminosilicates with uniform molecular sized pores. The unique properties of zeolite membranes are: size and shape selective separation behavior and thermal and chemical stabilities. Due to their crystallinity, zeolites have a well-defined pore size. The size of the channels is typically 3–10Å, in the range of molecular dimensions. Therefore, the hydrogen permeation through zeolite membranes relies on molecular sieve effect and/or competitive diffusion mechanisms (Dong et al., 2000). Regarding material and structure, the most extensively studied zeolite membranes for hydrogen separation are mainly MFI (ZSM (Hong et al., 2005), silicate-1 (McLeary et al., 2006), LTA (NaA (Xu et al., 2000), DDR (Lin and Kanezashi, 2007) and CHA (SAPO-34 (Hong et al., 2008). The most commonly used technologies for zeolite processing are in situ hydrothermal synthesis (Coronas and Santamaria, 2004), secondary (seeded) growth synthesis (Xomeritakis et al., 2000) and vapor phase transport synthesis (Chiang and Chao, 2001). Other various techniques have been applied, such as conventional heating, microwave heating (Li et al., 2006), synthesis under centrifugal field (Tiscareño-Lechuga et al., 2003), moved-synthesis (Richter et al., 2003). Often, pre-treatment of supports (Berg et al., 2003) and post-treatment of membranes (Yan et al., 1997) (e.g. for pore size reduction and defects removal) are carried out to improve the quality of the as-synthesized membranes. Some of the most relevant current developments on zeolite membranes for hydrogen separation are presented below. Lai et al. (Lai and Gavalas, 2000) developed ZSM-5 zeolite membranes by hydrothermal synthesis using a template free gel in order to avoid calcination step. The H2/N2 ideal selectivity and H2 permeance obtained were 109 and 1.2×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1, respectively. Welk et al. (2004) from Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) have studied the potential applications of zeolite membranes for hydrogen separation from reforming streams. ZSM-5 membranes were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and the testing results showed that the H2 purity was enriched from 76% to more than a 98% after a single pass through this membrane. Tsapatsis and co-workers from University of Minnesota have prepared 1 μm thick MCM-22/silica layer onto porous homemade alumina support discs. The H2/N2 ideal selectivity and H2 permeance were 50 and 7×10−8 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 at 200°C, respectively (Choi and Tsapatsis, 2010). Besides, the same group is developing membranes consisting of ex-foliated MCM-22 layers onto commercial stainless steel tubular support to their later integration in WGS reactors and integrated gasification combined cycle plants (CO2 Handbook, 2011). Recently, Zhang et al. (2012) from Nanjing University have developed a MFI zeolite membrane on porous α-alumina porous discs. The membrane was tested for the separation of H2/CO2 mixture containing 20cm3 (STP)/min H2, 20cm3 (STP)/min CO2 and 5cm3 (STP)/min He under atmospheric pressure. The permeate side was swept by He stream with the flow rate of 30cm3 (STP)/min. The H2/CO2 separation factor and the H2 permeance were 42.6 and 2.82×10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa at 500°C."
9,Metal–organic framework membranes,"4.2 Metal–organic framework membranes Metal–organic frameworks are microporous crystalline hybrid materials consisting of metal cations or cationic oxide clusters that are linked by organic molecules. Pore size tailorability combined with tunable sorption behavior provides promising possibilities for the applications of MOFs as membranes for gas separation applications. It is thought that MOF can solve problems that zeolites have for their industrial use, such as, long-term stability, T-cycling, regeneration and difficult housing (Gascon and Kapteijn, 2010). MOF are mechanically less stiff and brittle and have less energy intensive synthesis conditions compared to zeolites (Tan and Cheetham, 2011; Shah et al., 2012). The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) form a subfamily of MOFs that are promising candidates as gas separation membranes due to their thermal and chemical stability in combination with their small pores (generally less than 5Å) (Shah et al., 2012). Other MOF materials that have been used for gas separation are MOF-type (Yoo et al., 2009; Bux et al., 2009), HKUST-type (Guerrero et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2009) and SIM-type (Aguado et al., 2011a), among others. The most commonly used technologies for MOF preparation are in situ growth synthesis (Liu et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2009), secondary (seeded) growth synthesis (Liu et al., 2009; Ranjan and Tsapatsis, 2009; Yoo et al., 2009) and liquid phase epitaxy (Shekhah et al., 2011). Besides, postsynthetic modifications of MOF membranes have been reported, for instance, introducing side groups to give functionality to the membranes (Huang and Caro, 2011; Aguado et al., 2011b). Some of the most relevant current developments on MOF membranes for hydrogen separation are presented afterwards. Li and co-workers have prepared 2μm thick ZIF-7 membrane deposited on an asymmetric alumina disc by secondary (seeded) growth technique. The H2 permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity of the membrane at 220°C and at 1atm were 4.55×10−8 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and 20.7, respectively (Li et al., 2010). Recently, the same group in Hannover (Huang and Caro, 2011) has prepared a 20μm thick ZIF-90 membrane on α-Al2O3 porous discs by solvothermal reaction. After synthesis the membrane has been modified using ethanolamine and its H2 permeance has slightly decreased from 2.5 to 2.1×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and the H2/N2 ideal selectivity has considerably increased from around 7 to 17.5 at 200°C and 1atm. (McCarthy et al. (2010) from Texas A&M University have prepared a ZIF-8 membrane (20μm thick) by in situ solvothermal growth on α-Al2O3 support after its surface modification. The H2 permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity of the membrane at 25°C and at 1atm were 1.73×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and 11.6, respectively. The same group from Texas (Guerrero et al., 2010) has prepared a 25μm thick HKUST-1 membrane deposited on a porous alumina support disc via secondary (i.e., seeded) growth method, using thermal seeding in order to anchor HKUST-1 seed crystals on the support. The H2 permeance and H2/N2 ideal selectivity of the membrane at 190°C and at 1atm were 1.1×10−6 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and 7.3, respectively. Permeation data about other reported MOF membranes can be found in the review prepared by Shah et al. (2012)."
10,Silica membranes,"4.3 Silica membranes Silica membranes are the most important representatives of amorphous microporous membranes, because they can be more easily prepared as ultra- or super-microporous thin layers in comparison to other metal oxides (such as alumina, titania or zirconia) and these can be used for molecular sieving applications. The most widely used technologies for deposition of silica layers on porous substrates are sol–gel (Tsuru, 2008) and CVD (Nagano et al., 2008). Silica membranes with pore diameters less than 1 nm can be prepared by CVD which provides high hydrogen selectivity (molecular sieving) but, consequently, a lower permeability. Moreover, the CVD method requires substantial capital investment and well defined and controlled deposition conditions. On the contrary, sol–gel derived membranes generally achieve lower selectivities but higher permeabilities. These membranes are much easier to produce with the possibility of controlling the pore size of the silica membranes, but the prepared membranes still suffer of low reproducibility which makes their industrial exploitation less attractive. Akamatsu et al. (2008) prepared and tested silica membranes via CVD technique. The test results showed an excellent H2 permeance at 600°C of the order of 10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1, and a high H2/N2 selectivity of over 1000. Yoshino et al. (2005) reported silica membranes prepared by sol–gel technique with a permeance at 600°C of 7×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and H2/N2 selectivity around 100. This group (Yoshino et al., 2006) also fabricated a membrane module with a membrane area of 0.05m2. The main problem of microporous silica membranes, as in the case of titania and alumina, is that they are not stable at high temperatures, especially in the presence of steam, leading to loss of permeability. This is due to closure of pore channels by densification which is catalyzed by humidity, particularly at high temperatures (Lin, 2001). Furthermore, this phenomenon may cause silica film embrittlement with the subsequent loss in separation properties. In order to improve the stability of silica membranes, different approaches have been proposed in the literature. The first approach used is the doping of silica with inorganic oxides (e.g., titania, zirconia and alumina) (Kanezashi and Asaeda, 2006; Sekulic et al., 2002). Kanezashi and Asaeda(2006) prepared Ni-doped silica membranes with a permeance of 4.6×10−6 m3 (STP) m−2 s−1 kPa−1 for H2 with a H2/N2 selectivity of 400 even after being kept in steam (steam pressure: 90kPa) at 500°C for about 6 days. Tsuru et al. (2011) prepared Co-doped silica membranes (approx. 50nm thick layer) with a H2 permeance of approximately 1.8×10−7 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 and a H2/N2 selectivity of 730 even after 60h of exposure to steam (steam: 300kPa) at 500°C. Doping of metals into silica membranes has been investigated in order to increase the hydrothermal stability at high temperatures and for their possible application to membrane reactors, such as steam reforming of methane (Battersby et al., 2009). Another approach to obtain hydrothermal stable silica membranes is to incorporate methyl groups in the silica microstructure as proposed by Campaniello et al. (2004). Recently, hybrid (organic–inorganic) silica membranes are widely being studied because the presence of organic groups in silica networks could improve the hydrothermal stability of silica structures and help controlling the pore size of the membrane (Duke et al., 2004). Castricum et al. (2008) prepared hybrid silica membranes derived by co-polymerization of methyltriethoxysilane and bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane with high hydrothermal stability. Kanezashi et al. (2009) reported a hybrid silica membrane using BTESE as precursor with a high H2 permeance around 10−5 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1 but low H2/N2 selectivity of around 10 at 200°C."
11,Carbon membranes,"4.4 Carbon membranes Carbon membranes are promising candidates for hydrogen separation due to their high separation performance and excellent thermal and chemical resistance (Ismail and David, 2001; Koros and Mahajan, 2000). Based on the pore size, carbon membranes are generally divided in carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMS) and selective surface flow (SSF) membranes. CMS membranes could allow the transport of small molecules through the pores, avoiding the passage of larger molecules. Due to their small pores, CMS membranes possess a high selectivity for separation of gas mixtures containing small gas species. In this case, a precise control of pore sizes near to molecular sieving size is required. SSF membranes have pores larger than the dimensions of the molecules and thus the separation is based on the preferential adsorption of some components in gas mixture followed by surface diffusion in the carbon matrix (Seo et al., 2002). This section will be focused on CMS membranes due to their properties for high H2 separation in comparison to SSF membranes. CMS membranes are the result of the pyrolysis of polymeric precursors under an inert or vacuum atmosphere. The most important parameters that would influence the final properties of CSM membranes are: (i) type of polymeric precursors such as polyimides, polyfurfuryl alcohol, phenolic resins, polyvinylidene chloride, polyacronitrile, cellulose derivates, and polyetherimide (Saufi and Ismail, 2004); (ii) pyrolysis conditions (i.e., heating rate, atmosphere and final temperature) (Geiszler and Koros, 1996; Centeno et al., 2004); and (iii) modifications (i.e., pre- or post-treatment such as stabilization, activation or oxidation, and CVD) (Barsema et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008c; Wang et al., 2002). The most commonly used techniques for depositing CSM layers onto supports may be dip coating (Hayashi et al., 1997), ultrasonic deposition (Shiflett and Foley, 2000), vapor deposition (Wang et al., 2000), spin coating (Tseng et al., 2009), and spray coating (Acharya and Foley, 1999). Some of the most relevant current developments on carbon membranes for hydrogen separation are presented afterwards. Hosseini and Chung (2009) from National University of Singapore reported carbon membranes prepared from blends of PBI and polyimides with a high H2/N2 selectivity of 460–480 and H2 permeability of 60–180barrer (1barrer=1×10−10 cm3(STP) cmcm−2 s−1 cmHg−1). Campo et al. (2010) have developed CMS membranes from cellophane paper with very interesting hydrogen permeation properties: H2 permeability of 39.3barrer, H2/N2 and H2/CO2 selectivities of 1310 and 58.7, respectively (Celo600 Sample). Grainger and Hägg (2007) reported CMS from cellulose base based precursors with a H2/N2 selectivity of 740 and H2 permeability of 1110 barrer at 90°C and at a feed pressure of 6bar. Media and Process Technology, Inc. is commercializing CSM composite membranes prepared by the pyrolysis of a PEI precursor deposited onto a ceramic porous substrate (Abdollahi et al., 2010; Sedigh et al., 2000)."
12,Proton conducting membranes,"Proton conducting membranes can be classified into two groups: dense ceramic membranes and composite ceramic metal (cermet) membranes. Both have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of membrane flux, perm-selectivity and stability. In the following section both types of membranes are discussed."
13,Dense ceramic membranes,"5.1 Dense ceramic membranes Dense ceramic membranes can recover a very high purity H2 stream due to a proton transport mechanism, but they have to operate at temperatures as high as 900°C. The hydrogen flux through these membranes is proportional to the ambipolar protonic–electronic conductivity. It is necessary to have high values for protonic and electronic conductivities to obtain a high hydrogen flux. The dense ceramic membranes may be classified into two sub-categories: perovskite-type and non-perovskite-type membranes. 5.1.1 Perovskite-type membranes The protons are embedded in perovskites in the electron cloud of an oxygen ion, forming hydroxide defects. They migrate by hopping between oxide ions (Grotthuss mechanism). As for the oxygen conductors, sufficiently high temperatures are required for high proton conductivity. The general formula of perovskite-type oxides is AB1−x M x O3−δ, where the A element is taken from the group consisting of (Ca, Sr, B); the B element is taken from the group consisting of be Ce, Tb, Zr, Tl; M element is taken from the group consisting of Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Co, Al, Y, Ga; x is less than the upper limit of solid solution formation range (usually less than 0.2) and δ is the oxygen deficiency per unit cell. The most extensively studied high temperature perovskite-type oxides are SrCeO3 (Higuchi et al., 2004; Song et al., 2002), BaCeO3 (Guan et al., 1997; Ma et al., 1998) and BaZrO3 (Tetsuo et al., 2002). These perovskites have high protonic conductivity but their electronic conductivity is poor. In order to improve the latter conductivity it is common to dope these perovskites with cations, such as Y (Sammes et al. 2004), Eu (Song et al., 2003) and Gd (Shima and Haile, 1998). The common methods for perovskite power synthesis are sol–gel (Selvaraj et al., 1991), spray drying (Varma et al., 1994), hydrothermal synthesis (Zheng et al., 1997) and combustion of polymerized complexes (Liu et al., 2002). On the other hand, typical methods for perovskite film deposition onto ceramic or metal supports are CVD (Ngamou and Bahlawane, 2009), EVD (Pal and Singhal, 1990) and PVD (Ma et al., 2008). Some of the most relevant current developments on perovskite-type membranes for hydrogen separation are presented afterwards. Yuan et al. (2010) have prepared SrCe0.75Zr0.20Tm0.05O3−δ membranes with a H2 permeation flux up to 0.042mLmin−1 cm−2 at H2 partial pressure of 0.4atm and at a temperature of 900°C. The Zr doping can increase mechanical stability of the membrane and the resistance to reduction. Yazdi et al. (2009) have developed BaCe1−x Y x O3−δ films by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Ceramatec (Paglieri and Way, 2002, CO2 Handbook, 2011) is producing a prototype membrane for hydrogen separation from coal-derived syngas using perovskite-type membranes. The pevoskite used is a mixture of barium cerate (BaCeO3) and ceria, where the former is proton conductor and the latter is electron conductor. The preliminary tests showed a perfect H2 separation (100%) from H2/CO2 mixture. 5.1.2 Non-perovskite-type membranes The non-perovskite-type membranes used for hydrogen separation are mainly doped rare earth metal oxides and fluorite-structured metal oxides. There are lots of different doped rare earth metal oxides that may be interesting for hydrogen separation, such as, Tb2O3, Ln2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7. Haugsrud and Norby (2006) prepared a 10μm thick film of acceptor-doped LaNbO4 (i.e. La0.99Ca0.01NbO4) that has a H2 flux of 0.1mL(STP)cm−2 min−1 at a temperature of 1000°C and a difference in pressure of 10bar. This group also reported that Ln6WO12 membranes have sufficient mixed electron–proton conductivity at intermediate temperatures (Haugsrud, 2007). Escolástico et al. (2011) have developed Nd5LaWO12 membranes and the results showed that the addition of La to Nd6WO12 increases the hydrogen flux from 0.03 to 0.05mLmin−1 cm−2 at 1000°C and difference pressure of 0.5bar. Among fluorite-structured metal oxides CeO2, YSZ and Y2O3 are the most used. Nigara et al. (2003) have reported hydrogen permeation through doped CeO2 and YSZ (Nigara et al., 2004) membranes, but unfortunately H2 permeabilities of these membranes are very low. Serra et al. (2005) studied H2 permeation through commercial alumina tubes obtaining as a result a H2 flux of 4×10−8 mols−1 m−2 at 1400°C."
14,Cermet membranes,"5.2 Cermet membranes Cermet membranes consist of a combination of a ceramic phase and a metallic phase. The former is a pure proton conductor, while the latter is a highly electron conductor. Combining these two phases together may provide high H2 permeation because both proton and electron conductivities become high, resulting in high hydrogen permeation. Due to the hydrogen transport by both metals and oxides, mainly three different combinations with respect to functional properties of both phases can be realized: (1) a metal with low hydrogen conductivity in combination with a highly proton conductive oxide, (ii) a metal or an alloy with high hydrogen permeability (i.e., Pd, Pd/Ag, Pd/Cu, Nb, Ta, V) combined with a ceramic of low hydrogen permeability and (3) a combination where both the metallic and ceramic phases conduct hydrogen. Some of the most relevant current developments on cermet membranes for hydrogen separation are presented in the following. Balachandran et al. (2006) from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) developed Pd/YSZ composite membranes and the highest H2 flux was ∼20.0cm3 (STP)min−1 cm−2 for a ∼22μm thick membrane at 900°C using 100% H2 as feed gas. Recently, Zhu et al. (2011) have developed a 30μm thick Ni–BZCY (Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3−δ) cermet layer onto ceramic support that exhibited a maximum H2 flux of 2.4×10−7 molcm−2 s−1 at 900°C using 80% H2/N2 (with 3% of H2O) as feed gas and dry high purity argon as sweep gas. Park et al. (2011) have developed a 0.5mm thick Ta/YSZ membrane and the highest H2 flux obtained was 1.2mlmin−1 cm−2 at 300°C using 100% H2 as the feed gas and Ar as the sweep gas. Jeon et al. (2011a) have developed a 0.5mm cermet membrane composed of Pd embedded in proton conducting ceramic matrix (CaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ) and its H2 flux was around 2.3cm3 (STP)min−1 cm−2 at 900°C. This group also has developed Pd–GDC (Ce0.8Gd0.2O2−δ) cermet membranes for high sulfur resistance and no sharp drop in hydrogen permeation flux was observed using feed gases with 220ppm H2S (Jeon et al., 2011b). The best performances of membranes investigated in the various research organizations are summarized in Table 2. Besides, membranes on the way to commercialization commented before are shown in Table 3. It is shown that relatively high fluxes with good perm-selectivities can be now achieved with hydrogen membranes which make this technology closer to the real market."
15,Advances in membrane reactors for hydrogen production,"The application of membrane reactors for dehydrogenation reactions has been first proposed to the scientific community by Prof. Gryaznov in the late 60s (see for example Gryaznov et al., 1970). Removing hydrogen through a thick membrane resulted in a shift of the equilibrium reaction towards the product of interest. Membrane reactors in dehydrogenation reactions were a scientific curiosity until around 1996 with few papers published per year. With the increasing interest into hydrogen as a possible clean energy carrier, the scientific attention towards membrane reactors as high efficient hydrogen production systems sharply increased in the last years ( Fig. 12). Probably the echo produced by the two books “The Hydrogen Economy” (Rifkin, 2002; National Academy of Engineering, 2004) was also reflected in the great increase of number of papers in the last 5 years. However, our research will focus on the progresses on membrane reactors in the last 10 years. Accordingly with the increase of number of papers, the patents awarded on hydrogen production in membrane reactors also increased with time and in the last years this number is increasing rapidly. In fact, most of the patents have been awarded in the last 10 years (Gallucci et al., 2009). Different types of membrane reactors for hydrogen production have been proposed in the literature. Most of the previous work has been performed in packed bed membrane reactors (PBMR); however, there is an increasing interest in novel configurations such as fluidized bed membrane reactors (FBMR) and micro-membrane reactors (MMR) especially because better heat management and decreased mass transfer limitations can be obtained in these reactor configurations. In the following, these reactor configurations, along with membrane bio-reactors (MBR) and catalytic membrane reactors (CMR) for hydrogen production will be discussed in detail."
16,Packed bed membrane reactors,"6.1 Packed bed membrane reactors The packed bed membrane reactor configuration is the first and most studied configuration for hydrogen production in membrane reactors. This is because, the first studies on membrane reactors focussed on the effect of the hydrogen permeation through membranes on the reaction system. Thus it was straightforward to compare two packed bed reactors (avoiding the complication of complex fluid dynamics such as in fluidized bed) in one of which a membrane was used. In the following table the main investigators working with PBMR for hydrogen production are summarized (source Scopus): The different authors showed that the concept of Pd-based membrane reactor can be used to carry out and intensify different dehydrogenation reactions such as reforming of methane and different alcohols. In particular, packed bed membrane reactors have been used for producing hydrogen via reforming of methane (Gallucci et al., 2006; Matsumura and Tong, 2008), reforming of alcohols (Kikuchi et al., 2008; Tosti et al., 2009), autothermal reforming (Simakov and Sheintuch, 2009), partial oxidation of methane (Tan and Li, 2009), etc. The results of these studies are interesting to show that indeed the Pd membranes are not poisoned by the different alcohols and the products of the reactions such as CO2 or higher hydrocarbons. The only poisoning can be due to the presence of H2S as said above or CO (if low temperature <300°C is used). In a packed bed membrane reactor the catalyst is confined in fixed bed configuration and in contact with a perm-selective membrane. The most used packed bed configuration is the tubular one where the catalyst may be packed either in the membrane tube ( Fig. 13a) or in the shell side (Fig. 13b), while the permeation stream is collected in the other side of the membrane (in case of hydrogen selective membranes) or one reactant is feed on the other side of the membrane (in case of oxygen selective membrane Jin et al., 2000). For multi-tubular membrane reactor configurations the catalyst in tube configuration can be preferred especially for construction reasons and for the extent of bed-to-wall mass and heat transfer limitations which can be very detrimental when the catalyst is positioned in shell configuration. Often, a sweep gas can be used in the permeation side of the membrane in order to keep the permeation hydrogen partial pressure as low as possible for minimizing the membrane area required for the hydrogen separation. This practice is for example very useful if hydrogen for ammonia plant is being produced, in which case an amount of nitrogen can be used for sweeping the permeation side producing a synthesis stream (N2/H2 =1/3) ready for the final reaction step. If a sweep gas is used in the permeation side then a packed bed membrane reactor can be used in both co-current and counter current modes. Using a counter-current mode leads to completely different partial pressure profiles in reaction and permeation sides with respect to the co-current mode (independently on the reaction system considered) (Gallucci et al., 2008c). Although the tube in tube configuration is quite useful to work in lab scale and for proof of principle of membrane reactors, for industrial scale some other configurations need to be used in order to increase the membrane area per volume of vessel used. In fact, the amount of hydrogen produced is directly related to the amount of membrane area installed in the reactor. Starting for the tube in tube configuration, a straightforward way to increase the membrane area in packed bed is the tube in shell configuration (Buxbaum, 2002; Tosti et al., 2008). An example of multi-tube membrane housing has been patented by Buxbaum (2002) and reported in Fig. 14. In this case the catalyst is loaded in the shell side of the reactor while the membrane tubes are connected to a collector for the pure hydrogen. In particular, in the figure the possibility to use a catalyst in a separate chamber is shown. In case of reforming reactions, this chamber acts as a pre-reforming zone where the greatest temperature profiles are concentrated. In this way the membranes will work at an almost constant temperature. The second way to increase the membrane area per volume of reactor is adopting the hollow fiber configuration. For example, in case of perovskite membranes the membrane flux is generally quite low and the hollow fiber configuration is quite interesting. The main investigators of hollow fiber membrane reactors are summarized in Table 4. These studies confirmed that the membrane preparation procedure can be also intensified to produce hollow fiber membranes with similar selectivities of the planar or tubular membranes. Kleinert et al. (2006) studied for example POM in a hollow fiber membrane reactor. The perovskite membranes used by the authors were produced from Ba(Co,Fe,Zr)O3−d (BCFZ) powder via phase inversion spinning technique. A tube in tube configuration has been used while the catalyst was packed in the shell side of the reactor. In their paper the authors show that the membrane was able to give quite interesting results with a methane conversion of 82% and a CO selectivity of 83%. Moreover the membrane was quite stable under the reactive conditions investigated. Finally, the combination of steam reforming and POM was studied by feeding steam along with methane in order to suppress the carbon formation. Even in these conditions the membrane reactor showed good stability. The membrane area required for the separation can be reduced by increasing the membrane fluxes (by keeping the same high perm-selectivity). As already described above, membrane fluxes can be increased by decreasing the separation thickness (ultra thin membranes). For example, for Pd-based membranes, defect free separation layers as thin as 1–2μm are now commonly produced in laboratory (Mejdell et al., 2009a). The thinner is the separation layer, the highest is the hydrogen flux through the membrane, the lowest should be the membrane area required for a given hydrogen recovery. However, the production of thin membranes brought under the spotlight one of the disadvantages of fixed bed membrane reactors: the influence of bed-to-wall mass transfer limitations on the membrane area required. Briefly, as long as the hydrogen flux through the membrane is a limiting step, the effect of external mass transfer limitations such as the limitations to hydrogen transport between the bulk of the catalytic bed (where hydrogen is produced) and the membrane wall (where hydrogen is recovered) can be neglected. However, by increasing the membrane flux, the external mass transfer limitations became limiting and determine the extent of membrane area. An example of the increase of extent of mass transfer limitations in membrane reactors was given by Tiemersma et al. (2006) and reported in Fig. 15. In their paper the authors claimed that with the membrane available in 2006 the effect of mass transfer limitations was quite limited. However, by increasing their experimental membrane flux (increase foreseen in a couple of years of membrane developments) the external mass transfer limitation could become a limiting step (as indicated in the figure). The conclusions drawn by Tiemersma were really appropriated and were completely confirmed by the work carried out at SINTEF by Bredesen and co-workers (see for example Peters et al., 2008). As indicated in Fig. 16, it is evident that the extent of bed-to-wall mass transfer limitations (also known as concentration polarization) is the limiting factor for the permeation of hydrogen through the membrane and thus it determines the amount of membrane area required for a given hydrogen recovery. These results have been also confirmed for self-supported membranes via detailed modeling by Caravella et al. (2009). A second important limitation of packed bed (membrane reactors) is due to the pressure drop along the reactor, which dictates the dimension of catalyst particle diameter to be used in the reactor. To decrease the pressure drop large particles need to be used and this reflects in the extent of intra-particle mass transfer limitations. The increase of intra-particle mass transfer limitations lowers the local hydrogen partial pressure in the reaction side and, consequently, it lowers the driving force for hydrogen permeation through the membrane resulting in increased membrane area required for a given conversion/recovery. Finally, the reactions for hydrogen production are often quite endothermic (reforming reactions) or exothermic (CPO, etc.). The temperature control is thus quite important because a decrease of temperature on the membrane surface leads to a decrease of hydrogen flux through the membrane while an increase of temperature could result in crack on the membrane surface with consequent decrease of perm-selectivity (and thus deteriorating the membrane reactor performances). The heat management and temperature control in packed bed membrane reactors are quite difficult and temperature profiles along the membrane length are difficult to avoid in such a reactor. The combination of these drawbacks has driven the research towards new reactor concepts such as micro-membrane reactors or fluidized bed membrane reactors as it is discussed in the following sections."
17,Fluidized bed membrane reactors,"6.2 Fluidized bed membrane reactors A typical fluidized membrane reactor (or membrane assisted fluidized bed MAFBR) for hydrogen production consists of a bundle of hydrogen-selective membranes immersed in a catalytic bed operated in the bubbling or turbulent regime. The use of fluidized bed membrane reactors reduces the bed-to-wall mass transfer limitations, but also allows operating the reactor at a virtually isothermal condition (due to the movement of catalyst). This possibility can be used for operating the autothermal reforming of hydrocarbons inside the membrane reactor. In fact, as indicated by Tiemersma et al. (2006), the autothermal reforming of methane in a packed bed membrane reactor is quite difficult due to the hot-spot at the reactor inlet which can melt down the membrane. This problem is completely circumvented in fluidized bed membrane reactors. In this case both autothermal reforming and hydrogen recovery can be performed in a single reactor. According to Deshmukh et al. (2007) the main advantages of the MAFBR can be listed as: • Negligible pressure drop, which allows using small particle sizes resulting in no internal mass and heat transfer limitations. • (Virtual) isothermal operation. • Flexibility in membrane and heat transfer surface area and arrangement of the membrane bundles. • Improved fluidization behavior as a result of: Compartmentalization, i.e. reduced axial gas back-mixing. Reduced average bubble size due to enhanced bubble breakage, resulting in improved bubble to emulsion mass transfer. Different research groups applied membrane assisted fluidized bed for different reaction systems (mostly involving hydrogen) as indicated in Table 5. Even though Rahimpour et al. (2008, 2009, 2010) often used fluidized bed membrane reactor for distributive hydrogen feeding in methanol reactors, most of the literature has focused on pure hydrogen production through Pd-based membranes (see among other Adris et al., 1991; Prasad and Elnashaie, 2002; Chen et al., 2003a; Khademi et al., 2009) and on autothermal reforming reactions (see for example Grace et al., 2001; Prasad and Elnashaie, 2003; Patil et al., 2005; Gallucci, 2010a). It is important to stress here how the experimental works on membrane assisted fluidized beds have also demonstrated as the Pd-based membranes can maintain their perm-selectivity even when operated in fluidized beds, thus when in contact with moving catalyst particles. A typical Pd-based membrane assisted fluidized bed has been proposed by Adris and co-workers and is reported in Fig. 17. With this reactor the bed-to-wall mass transfer limitations can be circumvented, while the heat required for the reforming reactions (often endothermic equilibrium reaction) is supplied through heat exchange surfaces inserted in the reactor system. In fact, fluidized bed reactors present higher heat exchange coefficients compared to fixed bed reactors. However, beside the high heat exchange coefficients, fluidized beds are also suitable for isothermal operations even if a highly exothermic reaction is occurring. This has been demonstrated for example by Deshmukh et al. (2005a, b), who carried out oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol in lab scale membrane fluidized bed reactors. The authors found virtually isothermal conditions even for very high methanol feed concentrations. This important aspect of fluidized bed reactors make it possible to operate autothermal reforming of methane (and other hydrocarbons) by feeding oxygen directly in the membrane reactor preventing the formation of hotspots and subsequent damage of the membranes. Indeed, Roy et al. (1999) first demonstrated that autothermal operation could be achieved by directly adding oxygen to a fluidized bed reformer to provide all the required heat via partial oxidation reaction. The extension of this work to a membrane fluidized bed reactor has been performed by the same group few years later. In particular, the previous experiences with autothermal fluidized beds and membrane fluidized beds have been condensed in a modeling paper by Grace et al. (2001). The model chosen by Grace was an equilibrium model and this selection was made based on the previous experience on modeling and experiments on fluidized bed membrane reactors which suggested that the overall composition of each species at each position inside the bed was found to be mainly controlled by two factors: (i) the quantity of hydrogen which had permeated through the membranes (depending on the difference in hydrogen partial pressure and membrane characteristics); (ii) chemical equilibrium at the given temperature and overall pressure on the reactor side (depending on the very high catalytic activity for methane reforming). The model was applied in order to investigate the influence of various parameters on the performance of FBMR with oxygen addition. Although the results showed that autothermal operation can be achieved by using approximately 0.3 O2/CH4 feed ratio, the interaction between the different parameters is quite complex. For instance, in methane reformers an important parameter is the steam/carbon ratio. However, when feeding also oxygen, the steam becomes also a product of the oxidation reaction and this makes the prediction of the reactor behavior a bit more complicated. Furthermore, an important conclusion of the work is that oxygen addition reduces the coke formation and consequently the catalyst deactivation. Based on this paper and on various other papers dealing with both theoretical and experimental works, recently the same group presented the experimental findings of pre-commercial membrane reactor prototypes for both methane reforming and ATR (with air addition) (Chen et al., 2007; Mahecha-Botero et al., 2008). The authors used optimized plane membranes, where a single two-side planar membrane panel consists of two Pd–Ag foils mounted on a porous stainless steel base using proprietary MRT sealing and protection techniques. A scheme of the membrane reactor used is reported in Fig. 18 (Mahecha-Botero et al., 2008): Based on their experience in the fluidized bed, the authors suggest that the flux through membranes computed by Sieverts’ equation must be multiplied by an effectiveness factor for membranes immersed in fluidized-bed reactors. The authors suggested that this effectiveness factor could possibly be due fine dust generated in the bed or to other mass transfer resistances. They demonstrated that by using ATR catalyst the effectiveness factor could be higher than the case of reforming catalyst and could in principle be higher than 0.9 (as high as 0.98 according with Chen et al., 2007). The experiments show that the maximum temperature difference along the reactor where membranes are immersed is always lower that 20°C (Mahecha-Botero et al., 2008), which results in a higher membrane lifetime and avoids formation of pinholes. All these works confirm that the autothermal reforming of methane is possible in a fluidized bed membrane reactor with oxygen (or air) addition without hot spot formation. It has be pointed out that feeding air directly in the reactors brings two drawbacks: (i) the exhaust gas mainly consists of nitrogen and CO2, if CO2 capture is required the separation is difficult (and costly); (ii) in each case nitrogen dilutes the amount of hydrogen in the reactor, reducing the driving force for hydrogen permeation through the membranes and resulting in higher membrane area required in the reactor. For these reasons, feeding oxygen in the fluidized bed membrane reactor for achieving autothermal reforming is more appropriate. However, an air separation unit (a costly process) outside the reactor is required to produce the oxygen for the autothermal reforming. This problem can be circumvented by using novel reactor configurations proposed by Kuipers and co-workers (Patil et al., 2005, 2007; Gallucci et al., 2008a, b). In particular two configurations have been proposed to achieve the autothermal methane reforming: the two configurations are called methane combustion configuration and hydrogen combustion configuration. The methane combustion configuration is sketched in Fig. 19 and consists of two sections (Patil et al., 2005). Hydrogen perm-selective membranes are integrated in a fluidized reforming/shift top section where ultra-pure H2 is extracted and the energy required for the steam reforming is supplied via in situ methane oxidation in a separate fluidized bottom section, where oxygen is selectively fed to the methane/steam feed via oxygen perm-selective membranes. Two different sections are required because metallic Pd-based membranes for selective H2 extraction can only be operated below typically 700°C because of membrane stability, while acceptable O2 fluxes through available perovskite-type O2 perm-selective membranes can only be realized above 900–1000°C. In this case the air separation is achieved in situ resulting in lower costs and in intrinsic CO2 capture. In the oxidation section, CH4 is partially oxidized in order to achieve the high temperatures required for O2 permeation through the perovskite membranes and to simultaneously preheat part of the CH4/steam feed. The preheated feed is mixed with additional CH4 and steam and fed to the reforming/shift section, where CH4 is completely converted to CO, CO2 and H2 because of the selective H2 extraction through the Pd membranes which shifts the methane steam reforming. H2 extraction can be achieved by using dead-end Pd membranes and applying a vacuum on the permeate side. Alternatively, a sweep gas (such as H2O) could be used, but the decrease in membrane area due to the increased driving force should outweigh the additional costs for separating H2 from the sweep gas. Overall autothermal operation can be achieved by tuning the overall CH4, O2 and steam fed to the reactor. The distinct advantage of this reactor concept is that the temperatures in both sections can be controlled independently by selecting the proper ratio of CH4/H2O fed at the oxidation and reforming/shift sections, while maintaining overall autothermal operation with optimal energy efficiency. In Fig. 20, the hydrogen combustion configuration is shown, where the energy for steam reforming is delivered via burning part of the produced hydrogen (Gallucci et al., 2008a). This configuration consists of only one fluidized bed section, where two types of hydrogen perm-selective membranes are incorporated: dead-end Pd-based membranes to recover ultra-pure H2 by applying a vacuum on the permeate side (similar to the ones used in the methane combustion configuration) and U-shaped Pd-based membranes with oxidative sweeping, by feeding air to the permeate side to burn the permeated hydrogen. The hydrogen combustion configuration has the clear advantage that only one section is required, circumventing the need for a (costly) high temperature bottom section. On the other hand, in the methane combustion configuration steam is produced in situ, which enhances the CO conversion. Moreover, in the hydrogen combustion configuration, part of the expensive Pd-based membranes are used to burn part of the produced hydrogen, while for the methane combustion configuration further development of oxygen perm-selective membranes (esp. the mechanical and chemical stability) is essential. Patil et al. (2005) and Gallucci et al., 2008a,b demonstrated from both experimental and theoretical point of view that autothermal reforming can be achieved in both reactor configuration. Moreover, applying detailed models to both packed bed and fluidized bed membrane reactors Gallucci et al. (2010b) demonstrated that for methane reforming the fluidized bed membrane reactor requires half membrane area compared to the packed bed membrane reactors where external mass transfer limitations are prevailing. Detailed modeling of fluidized bed membrane reactors is hindered by the fact that the hydrodynamics correlations present in the literature are based on experiments carried out in fluidized bed without membranes. As it is well accepted that the presence of and permeation through membranes influence the hydrodynamics of the fluidized bed, no detailed correlation to describe this multiphase reactor system are yet been proposed. De Jong et al. (2011) presented for the first a detailed study on the influence of permeation through vertical membranes on the hydrodynamics of fluidized bed membrane reactors. Through a non-invasive experimental technique (particle image velocimetry coupled with digital image analysis PIV-DIA) the authors studied the hydrodynamics of a pseudo-2D fluidized bed. It has been demonstrated that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the extraction of gas through the membranes may result in an increase of the average bubble size, whereas the addition of gas via the porous walls may result in a decrease of the average bubble size. Detailed coupled PIV-DIA experiments have elucidated that these results can be explained by the occurrence of densified zones near the membranes and induced enhanced bubble coalescence in the centre in case of gas extraction, and gas by-passing along the walls in case of gas addition. It is clear that the detailed description of the effect of membrane on the characteristic of the fluidized bed is required to avoid under- or overestimation of mass transfer and thus performance of the reactor."
18,Membrane micro-reactors,"6.3 Membrane micro-reactors Micro-structured (membrane) reactors are quite interesting due to their: (i) improved mass and heat transfer owing to the reduction of the scale length in the micro-channels; (ii) removal of mass transfer limitations (concentration polarization); (iii) high degree of process intensification by integrating different process steps in a small scale devise. Although there is a great interest in micro-reactors, the application of membrane micro-reactors is still limited. An interesting work is being carried out by Bredesen and co-workers (Mejdell et al., 2009a,b,c) using thin, high selective and high permeable Pd-based membranes produced via magnetron spattering technique. In particular, by comparing the performance of the same membrane in different configurations, the authors showed that in tubular configuration the extent of concentration polarization is the limiting step for the hydrogen permeation (as also indicated above), while with the same membrane used in micro-channel configuration the concentration polarization effect can be completely neglected (Mejdell et al., 2009b). The micro-channel reactor configuration proposed by Bredesen and co-workers is depicted in Fig. 21 (Mejdell et al., 2009a). The reactor consists of s micro-channels 13mm long and a section 1 mm×1mm, while the membranes used are self-supported Pd-based membrane thinner than 3μm. It has been shown that in this configuration a 1.4μm thick membrane can withstand a differential pressure >470kPa. In another work (Mejdell et al., 2009c) the authors studied the influence of CO and CO2 (components always present in reforming reactions) on the permeation of hydrogen. Although concentration polarization is not a problem, at low temperatures CO preferentially absorbs on the Pd surface (as found for all kind of configurations) depleting the hydrogen permeation rate. Other studies on membrane micro-reactors were carried out for integrating different process steps in one micro-devise for portable hydrogen production for fuel cells applications (see for example Gervasio et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009; Kudo et al., 2009). In their work, Gervasio and co-workers designed and operated a membrane micro-reactor for generating pure hydrogen at ambient temperature. The system can generate hydrogen for a small fuel cell system. The interesting idea is based on the efficiency of the macro-reactor system (integrating feeding, reaction and hydrogen separation) coupled with an efficient hydrogen carrier. The carrier is a liquid aqueous alkaline borohydride solution which reacts (completely) at room temperature over a Ru-based catalyst packed in the micro-reactor. One wall of the reactor is made of a celgar membrane which is impermeable for the liquid solution but permeable for gaseous hydrogen. Another integration study has been carried out by Kim and co-workers who prepared integrated catalytic structured mini-channel networks covered by a Pd-based membrane for hydrogen recovery. This first step work leads to a hydrogen separator made of defect free Pd-layer. However, this is a step further towards the use of such a system as integrated micro-reformer and separator. A same approach has been used by Karnik and co-workers who successfully produced Pd-based membrane via micro-fabrication and used it for hydrogen separation. The authors were able to design and fabricate a micro-reactor that was used for hydrogen separation; however, the support (or a part of it) for the micro-membrane is made of copper which is also active catalyst for WGS reaction. The reactor can be thus used for on-board hydrogen production for micro-fuel cells application. A different approach is used by Kudo et al. (2009) where the micro-reactor applied consists of an array of up to 15 stages and the membrane is used as a catalytic membrane in order to achieve hydrogen production through methanol reforming reaction. The particular gas profiles in the micro-channels due to the laminar flow are responsible, according to the authors, to the higher methanol conversion and higher hydrogen yield compared to a traditional tubular reactor system. Finally, Alfadhel and Kothare (2005) modeled a membrane micro-reactor for WGS reaction with a simplified (1D, isothermal) model, suggesting the limitation of the simple model in simulating a membrane micro-reactor. As above mentioned, membrane micro-reactors are very interesting systems to be studied in case external mass transfer limitations could not be ignored (such as for high flux Pd-based membranes) and when different steps need to be coupled (coupling exothermic and endothermic reaction is an example). However, more research is required before being able to design an optimum membrane micro-reactor."
19,Membrane bio-reactors,"6.4 Membrane bio-reactors As already mentioned above, most of the hydrogen is nowadays produced via high temperature reforming of fossil fuels (especially natural gas). The rest of hydrogen is produced by water splitting. It is clear that both the processes (thermal or electrical) are energy intensive and sometimes (when using fossil fuels) not environment friendly. For this reason, a great attention is devoted to biological processes for hydrogen production, which are low temperature processes (often ambient condition) and environmental friendly. In addition, exploitation of such processes would lead to utilization of renewable resources. Das and Veziroglu (2001, 2008) reviewed the biological processes for hydrogen production which, according to the authors, can be summarized as: • Biophotolysis of water using algae and cyanobacteria. • Photodecomposition of organic compounds by photo-synthetic bacteria. • Fermentative hydrogen production from organic compounds • Hybrid systems using photosynthetic and fermentative bacteria. The advances in research related to these processes can be found in Das and Veziroglu (2008). Different biological hydrogen production processes can be effectively carried out in membrane bio-reactors. In most of the cases the membrane is not immersed in the reactor where hydrogen production takes place but rather used outside the reactor as a retention (of feedstock) media. The membrane should be able to separate the fluids (water and gases) from bacteria and unconverted feedstock. The membranes used are thus typical (polymeric) membranes already commercially applied for water treatments like hollow fibers for ultra filtration and so on. Examples of such a membrane bio-reactor for hydrogen bio-production are reported by few authors in the recent literature (see Jeong et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2004). Lee and co-workers used a membrane bio-reactor consisting of a hollow fiber MF commercial module connected downstream to a CSTR reactor. The CSTR is the typical reactor where the fermentative hydrogen production takes place; easy to design and operate, the only drawbacks of the CSTR for such a process is the low cell retention resulting in low hydrogen yield. Connecting the micro-filtration module (on the market for a wide range of water treatments) to the CSTR, the liquid effluent is filtered out in the hollow fiber module and the cells are recycled inside the reactor, circumventing the cell washout problem. The authors applied the membrane bio-reactor to hydrogen production from different substrates (fructose, sucrose and glucose) and in each case it has been demonstrated that the hydrogen yield in the membrane reactor is much higher than the corresponding hydrogen yield of a single CSTR. A similar approach to a glucose based hydrogen bio-production has been applied by Oh et al. (2004), where a cross-flow membrane module has been used to retain the hydrogen production bacteria to be re-circulated in the anaerobic reactor. Also the authors found out that the hydrogen production rate can be increased by 25% by using a membrane bio-reactor instead of a single anaerobic reactor. Finally Jeong et al. (2007) applied a commercial hollow fiber module connected to an acid fermentation reactor for hydrogen production from waste activated sludge. Also in this case the membrane separation busted the system to a higher hydrogen production compared to a system without membrane separation. From these examples it is clear as a membrane reactor can help the biological production of hydrogen from renewable sources. Of course the typical problems of such a membrane system (caking, aging) already well known in water treatment processes have to be taken into account when designing the membrane bio-reactor."
20,Feedstock for hydrogen production,"In the following section a brief review on the advances on hydrogen production in MRs from different feedstock is presented. Most of the hydrogen is produced by methane reforming, for this reason also a great part of the literature on MRs deals with hydrogen production via reforming of methane in membrane reactors. However, great attention is devoted to hydrogen production from other hydrocarbons, and even more on hydrogen production from renewable sources such as bio-ethanol and bio-methanol."
21,H2 production from methane in MR,"7.1 H2 production from methane in MR Methane steam reforming has been used for hydrogen production since long time, and it is the industrially most exploited reaction system for hydrogen production. Optimized catalysts for such a reaction commercially exist (mostly Ni based catalysts) and the catalytic activity is so high that the equilibrium conversion is easily achieved in these reactors. Since the methane steam reforming is an equilibrium system, the application of hydrogen selective membranes inside the reactor help to circumvent the equilibrium limitation while simultaneously produce a pure hydrogen stream. The membrane reactor system needs thus milder reaction conditions with respect to a conventional reactor and a downstream separation system is not required. There are different papers in the literature showing that the application of Pd-based membranes to the methane steam reforming leads to a methane conversion well above the equilibrium limitation (see for example Gallucci et al., 2004; Ferreira-Aparicio et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008). The extent of the increase of conversion and amount of hydrogen production is related to the surface of membrane installed per unit of volumetric feed flow rate (Gallucci et al., 2008b). The higher is the membrane area installed the higher is the conversion and the pure hydrogen production rate. The advances in hydrogen production by methane reforming in membrane reactors are basically related to: (i) the design of a suitable reactor to decrease the mass transfer limitations; (ii) heat supply to the reactor; (iii) combining the steam reforming with other reactions to optimize the system. Mass transfer limitations can be decreased by applying a reasonable design such as micro-reactors and fluidized bed as described above. The heat required by the reactor can be achieve by feeding air (or oxygen) directly in the reactor to obtain the autothermal reforming, but in this case a fluidized bed reactor is more suitable in order to avoid hot spots (Chen et al., 2007; Mahecha-Botero et al., 2008; Abashar et al., 2008). Also oxygen feeding through membranes has been proposed and discussed above (Patil et al., 2007; Gallucci et al., 2008a), or heat supply by burning part of the hydrogen recovered (Gallucci et al., 2008b) can be used. Since methane reforming in membrane reactors is carried out at lower temperatures (<600°C) with respect conventional systems (>900°C), the heat supply in MR is somehow simpler and other heat sources can be used. For instance, Giaconia et al. (2008) and De Falco et al. (2010) used a system in which the heat required by the methane reforming is supplied via molten salts produced via concentrated solar power. The molten salts have a temperature of 550°C and can be successfully used to supply the heat to the membrane reformer, in a tubes-in-shell configuration. Also thermally coupled reactors have been proposed for heat supply, where an exothermic reaction takes place in a chamber of the reactor while the membrane reformer is the other chamber of the reactor and the heat is supplied via the wall dividing the two chambers (Patel and Sunol, 2007; Simakov and Sheintuch, 2009). In this case along with the ratio between the methane reforming rate and permeation rate already discussed, another important parameter to be carefully controlled is the ratio between the oxidation reaction taking place in a chamber and the steam reforming reaction rate. This ratio, in a thermally coupled reactor, defines the temperature profiles inside the membrane reformer. Concerning the possibility to couple the steam reforming with other reactions the two most interesting applications are the so-called steam dry reforming, where steam reforming and dry reforming of methane are coupled in the reaction zone of the membrane reactor (see e.g. Abashar, 2004) and the steam reforming coupled with the methanation reaction, where the methanation takes place in the permeation side of the membrane reactor (see Mori et al., 2008). Dry reforming of methane is a significant process since reformates methane with a greenhouse gas (CO2) into syngas. For this reason it attracted much attention in the last years, and also in membrane reactors (Paturzo et al., 2003; Gallucci et al., 2008d). In his interesting theoretical work Abashar (2004) proposed to develop a dual functional fluidized bed membrane reactor to couple the steam reforming with the dry reforming of methane, where the high amount of carbon dioxide produced by the steam reforming is used to produce syngas via dry reforming. Also for this specific application, the membrane reactor shows a higher performance compared with traditional reactor. The membrane reactor configuration (in terms of flow configuration, mixed catalysts and so on) can be optimized with the model proposed by Abashar. The second interesting application is proposed by Mori et al. (2008), who suggest to use a methanator in the shell side of the membrane reactor to convert traces of CO (which are surely present in the permeation stream of the reactor when the membrane is not completely hydrogen perm-selective), to methane which is not armful for the fuel cell catalyst. The study of Mori, shows that even when the Pd-based membrane presents some defects (due to membrane aging or membrane production method), the system is able to produce pure hydrogen (>99.8%) while maintaining the CO concentration well below 10ppm, thus a hydrogen stream suitable for PEM fuel cell applications."
22,H2 production from other hydrocarbons in MR,"7.2 H2 production from other hydrocarbons in MR The recent literature presents also works related to the production of hydrogen for higher hydrocarbons in membrane reactors. The production of hydrogen from other hydrocarbons than methane is studied from two points of view: (i) the higher hydrocarbon is considered a feedstock for hydrogen production and (ii) hydrogen is a byproduct of a reaction involving a higher hydrocarbon. As far as the higher hydrocarbon is used as direct feedstock for hydrogen, the typical reaction system occurring is based on the following reactions (see for example Chen et al., 2003b, 2006; Damle, 2008, 2009): CnHm+nH2O→nCO+(n+m/2)H2 CO+3H2⇔CH4+H2O CO+H2O⇔CO2+H2 Basically, the higher hydrocarbon is easily converted to CO and hydrogen at moderate temperatures, through an irreversible reaction. Two successive equilibrium reactions (methanation and WGS) follow the reforming. Being the temperature of the reactor between 450 and 550°C, the methanation is more shifted towards the products, while the WGS is more shifted towards the reactants, corresponding to a lower hydrogen production. By using a membrane reactor, hydrogen is withdrawn during the reforming, which results in suppressing the methanation reaction and promoting the WGS. Thus, by using the membrane reactor with H2-selective membranes, higher hydrogen yield is obtained while pure hydrogen stream is also directly available for fuel cells applications. Of course, all the aspects already discussed for methane reforming in membrane reactors (heat supply, mass transfer limitations, and so on) also read for reforming of higher hydrocarbons, while the positive aspect to be taken into account is that higher hydrocarbons are generally liquid and easier to transport and with higher energy density compared to methane. On the other hand, often higher hydrocarbon are reformed not directly to syngas, but rather dehydrogenated to more valuable products. Few examples are: ethane to ethylene (Wang et al., 2003), cyclohexane to benzene, system which is seen as an interesting hydrogen carrier (Itoh et al., 2003), isobutane to isobutene (Liang and Hughes, 2005). In any of these processes, hydrogen is “simply” a by-product, while its withdrawn will increase the conversion towards the product of interest, while at the same time producing a pure stream of hydrogen available for PEM fuel cells and other applications."
23,H2 production from biological related feedstock in MR,"7.3 H2 production from biological related feedstock in MR A biological route for hydrogen production is highly desirable since from one side the fossil fuels (such as NG) are limited and not renewable, while from the other side the biological route often do not produce additional CO2 emission into atmosphere. In a previous section, the direct hydrogen production from biological feedstock has been introduced and the application of membrane reactors to enhance the hydrogen yield has been highlighted. Although the direct bio-hydrogen production is a promising route, a more realistic route for hydrogen production from bio-mass related feedstock is via reforming intermediate products (or bio-products) of bio-mass transformation. In this case, reforming of alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and acetic acid produced from biomass has been greatly investigated in literature. Methanol, ethanol and acetic acid can be converted (via steam reforming) to a mixture of hydrogen, carbon oxides and other products like methane, ethane, etc.). The reforming of the feedstock is generally an equilibrium system, involving also WGS reaction, although the overall system requires much lower temperatures compared with the reforming of natural gas (Kikuchi et al., 2008; Lin and Chang 2004). Methanol has been widely studied, also because methanol itself can be considered as an energy carrier much easier to handle than hydrogen (Gallucci et al., 2007a,b). The permeation through hydrogen selective membranes results in shifting the reaction equilibrium (as for the methane reforming) while producing CO-free hydrogen stream directly available for PEM fuel cells. Many authors (not reported in this review) reported the positive effect of membranes in enhancing the methanol conversion. An interesting application has been proposed by Fu and Wu (2007) who adopted a double jacketed membrane reactor to obtain the autothermal reforming of methanol. The methanol reforming takes place in the shell between the membrane tube and the second jacket, the hydrogen permeates through the membrane and is recovered as CO-free stream. The unconverted reactants and the unrecovered hydrogen are converted in the second jacket with air producing the heat which is supplied to the reforming system through the jacket wall. In this way, complete conversion of methanol and complete recovery of hydrogen are not required, and autothermal operation can be achieved. The reforming/oxidation ratio can be adjusted by tuning the air flow in the second jacket. Ethanol reforming in hydrogen selective membrane reactors has been studied by Lin et al. (2004, 2008), Tosti et al. (2009), Gallucci et al. (2010a), and others. The application of hydrogen selective membranes inside the reactor during ethanol reforming suppresses the formation of methane (helping its reforming to hydrogen) resulting in an increased conversion of ethanol and a pure hydrogen stream generation. The heat required by the reforming reaction can be supplied either feeding oxygen inside the reaction system (Lin, 2001) or by burning part of the hydrogen recovered (Gallucci et al. (2010a)). In the first case an air separation unit is required, while in the second case up to 15% of the hydrogen produced is lost to supply the heat through a Pd membrane. Another way to produce hydrogen in membrane reactor is by reforming of acetic acid as indicated by Basile et al. (2008). Since methane is a main product of the reforming reaction, by applying a mixture of catalysts (to be optimized) and a membrane reactor (recovering hydrogen) the methane formation can be decreased and the hydrogen yield can be enhanced. Finally, a big attention on the reforming of bio-oils to produce syngas or hydrogen has been paid in the recent literature; however, the application of membranes in such a system has not been yet exploited."
24,Conclusions,"In this review, an extensive overview of the most suitable membrane materials for hydrogen separation is presented. Depending on the operating conditions and feed gas composition, a wide variety of membrane materials can be selected for hydrogen separation. The most widely studied membranes for hydrogen separation are dense metal membranes and among these membranes the Pd-based membranes are the closest to the market. Extensive experimental study as well as DFT-based calculations have shown that the permeability of the Pd-based membranes can be enhanced by alloying the Pd in binary or ternary alloys. This can improve the permeability but also the stability of the membrane against poisoning of CO and or H2S. Some examples of the progress in commercialization of these membranes are shown. On the other hand, microporous and proton conducting are also promising ones for high purity hydrogen purification. Membranes can be integrated in membrane reactors with different embodiments. The easiest and most studied reactor type is the packed bed membrane reactor configuration. However, with the production of very thin and highly permeable membranes the extent of mass transfer limitations (concentration polarization) prevailing in packed bed membrane reactor make this configuration not suitable for hydrogen production. Industrial type of reactors for pure hydrogen production will most likely be based on fluidized bed configuration and/or micro-structured reactors. In both cases the mass transfer limitations within the catalysts bed are circumvented and the membrane area required is thus minimized. Membranes and membrane reactors discussed in this review can easily be applied to different fuels (from gas fossil fuels to bio-derived fuels). Experimental data especially on packed bed membrane reactors with different fuels also indicated that the membrane performances are not deteriorated by the presence of alcohols or bio-derived fuels. Based on the results and the state of the art on membrane reactors the first membrane reactors operated at larger scale will be probably based on natural gas reforming and on bio-ethanol reforming."
