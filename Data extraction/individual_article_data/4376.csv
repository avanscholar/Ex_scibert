0,Introduction,"The rising level of green house gases (GHGs) emissions has become a major concern in the present century [1]. The technological advancements have certainly lead to significant reduction in the emissions of flue gases. However, the amount of gaseous phase CO2 (g) in the emissions is far above the threshold values prescribed to keep the global temperature below 1.5-degree guardrail. In light of the increasing pollution, various strategies are involved to cut down the industrial emissions. Carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) is one such approach involving storage of CO2 into a secure media by directly removing it from the industrial emissions [2]. CCS methods include gaseous phase separation, adsorption onto a solid media, absorption into a liquid media, as well as hybrid processes (e.g., membrane system/adsorption) [3–6]. All these techniques are widely used in the industries, but these methods involve a huge amount of energy and subsequently requires a higher cost. Another emerging and innovative technique which is highlighted in the field of carbon capture sequestration is microbial electrosynthesis (MES). MES is a technology where multi organic compounds are generated from sequestration of CO2 by employing anaerobic electrotrophic microbes as biocatalysts [7]. The use of more energy indirectly lead to more pollution and thus making the objective of CO2 (g) fixation trivial. The other associated problems with the CCS approach are related to storage permanence and storage capacity [1,8,9]. In these lines of carbon capture, the global community is now shifting its focus towards the implementation of large-scale integrated biorefinery [10,11]. Biorefinery concept involves the combination of CO2 (g) fixation technique with an appropriate downstream processing strategy for the recovery of value-added chemicals [11–13] and the approach is known as carbon capture and utilization (CCU). The concept of CCU is towards the production of biofuels, which can be one of the potential ways to transform the damaging GHGs into a valuable and renewable energy source for the present and future [1,14,15]. However, commercial exploitation of microalgae requires dedicated research as there are several unresolved concerns [16–18]. Biological route involving bacteria to fix CO2 (g) has got extensive attention in the recent past due to its rapid growth rates, ability to withstand higher concentrations and other environmental benefits [19]. The approach towards bacterial CO2 (g) fixation can facilitate the production of biomass consisting of valuable biochemicals such as biosurfactants, glutamate, biohydrogen, biodiesel, hydrocarbons, isopropanol, biomethane etc. [20–24]. Compared to various conventional biological and chemical processes producing biofuels, biological route involving bacteria can likely circumvent the release of a large amount of CO2 (g) from industries. The issues such as a higher cost of biofuel production and unavailability of a large amount of fresh water prohibit the large-scale implementation of microbial-based biofuel production. This may be due to the fact that microbial cultivation mostly requires a huge amount of water and expensive inorganic nutrients [25,26]. One such study has reported the utilization of thiosulphate salt as an energy source for the biofixation of CO2 via bacterial specie [21]. The higher cost of thiosulphate salt directly affects the overall profitability of the process for the biofuel production. Microbes have higher nutrient eliminating ability due to which microbial treatment of wastewater over other conventional techniques is one of the most sustainable and eco-friendly options. These microbes utilize phosphorous, nitrogen and sulphate ions which are the main contributors to the eutrophication [27,28]. Nutrients present in the wastewater can be utilized as the growth media for the microbial fixation of CO2. This provides the simultaneous solution for CO2 fixation and wastewater treatment problems. The utilization of concomitant sulphate ions from wastewater as a nutrient source may lead to the significant cost reduction of microbial cultivation. Few recent studies have reported the use of wastewater as a nutrient source of cyanobacterial biofuel production [3,29–31]. Hence, the present study is focused on the development of the integrated system for the CO2 (g) fixation, wastewater remediation and downstream processing for biofuel generation from biomass. The comparative bio-mitigation studies of CO2 in domestic wastewater (DWW); deionized water (DI) and synthetic media utilizing bacterial strain H. stevensii isolated from the extreme environment of Soda Salt Lake were conducted. The present study also demonstrates the economic analysis justifying the overall applicability and potential benefits of introducing wastewater as the source of cultivation media for H. stevensii. This integration could not only reduce the expenditure of a huge amount of fresh water requirements but also facilitate the wastewater remediation and CO2 (g) fixation."
1,Material and methods,
2,"Bacterial stains, inoculum preparation and culture conditions","2.1 Bacterial stains, inoculum preparation and culture conditions The bacterial specie, Halomonas stevensii KP 163920 used in the present study was identified from the water and sludge sample from Sambhar Salt Lake present in Rajasthan, India [23]. The identification, CO2 fixing ability of the bacterium and its isolation is reported in one of the earlier literatures [23]. The nutrient broth containing peptone –5 g L−1, beef extract –3 g L−1, and NaCl –5 g L−1 dissolved in DI was utilized for the enrichment of bacterial culture."
3,Wastewater sampling and analysis,"2.2 Wastewater sampling and analysis DWW was collected from the discharge section of the secondary clarifier unit from sewage treatment plant located at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani (28°220000N, 75°360000E), Pilani campus, Rajasthan, India. The collected wastewater was immediately brought to the laboratory and stored at 4 °C to avoid degradation. The wastewater was first filtered using 0.22 µm pore size GF/C Whatman cellulose membrane filter for avoiding suspended solid impurities. Further, it was autoclaved at 121 °C for 45 min to sterilize. The pH after filtration and sterilization of wastewater was found to be 8.1 ± 0.1. The autoclaved wastewater was then analyzed by following standard protocols given in American public health association (APHA) handbook for NO3, NO2, NH4 +, PO4 and SO4 2 – [32]. The heavy metals present in wastewater were examined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA-7000, Shimadzu, Japan). The water quality parameters for domestic wastewater (DWW) were estimated in duplicates and are given in Table 1."
4,Culture conditions used in the present study,"2.3 Culture conditions used in the present study The minimal salt media (MSM) was prepared as the cultivation media of bacteria by dissolving following salts (g L−1): K2HPO4 – 1, KNO3 – 1, NH4Cl – 3, and NaCl – 35 in different aqueous media. Two different culture media were prepared by adjusting 100 mM Na2S2O3 in DWW water and milli-Q DI water. The third culture was prepared utilizing DWW water with no external addition of sulphate ions. The solubility of CO2 in water was found to increase with increase in pH of the solution. The pH of the media was initially altered to 10 using a stock solution of 1 M NaOH in order to dissolve more amount of CO2 in water. However, with increase in concentration of dissolved CO2 in media, pH of the media was found to decrease and was nearly equal to neutral value during microbial cultivation. Hence, the optimum pH for the growth of H. stevensii was obtained as approximately 7. The MSM prepared was then autoclaved and used in further studies. The adaptability of bacterial species in the wastewater environment and its comparative study in MSM prepared in DI water were investigated by performing three experimental runs in duplicates. The DWW used as media was filtered and autoclaved to maintain the purity of the microbes."
5,Experimental setup,"2.4 Experimental setup The glass lined bio-reactor with a total volume of 3 L and a working volume of 2 L was used in the process. The reactor set up was equipped with the automatic temperature control system. The other accessories in the reactor include antifoam probe, pH probe, air sparger and an impeller. Schematic representation of bio-reactor used in the present study is shown in Fig. 1. The pH meter was calibrated using the buffer solutions at pH 4, 7, 10 and 12. The experiments were performed in the semi-continuous mode. 100 mL of the preliminary enriched culture having optical density (OD) of 1.3 ± 0.3 was used as the bacterium inoculum. This corresponds to the initial biomass loading rate of 1.3 g L−1. A gas mixture comprising of 10% of (v/v) CO2 (g) and 90% of compressed moisture free air (g) was utilized as source of CO2 (g) in the bio-reactor. The gas mixture was supplied continuously with an aeration rate of 4 vvm (0.5 L min−1) through the gas inlet port of bio-reactor equipped with sparger. The hydraulic retention time was maintained as 4 min throughout the experiments. The 6 days studies were performed in the bio-reactor programmed at 120 rpm and at 37 °C. The other parameters such as carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, optical density, pH, gaseous phase CO2 (g) concentration, dissolved CO2 (g) concentration, and CFU were measured after every 24 h. The control run was performed without the addition of inoculum to ensure that bacterium H.stevensii was solely responsible for the decreased concentration of CO2 (g) at the outlet."
6,Biomass growth rate,"2.5 Biomass growth rate The biomass yield of H. stevensii was measured in terms of dry weight and optical density. The optical density on the per day basis was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm using the UV–vis spectrophotometer (Evolution 201, Thermo Scientific, USA). A sample of 50 mL was collected in every 24 h from bio-reactor, and 30 mL was used to estimate the dry weight of biomass. The dry weight (g L−1) was measured using the standard filtration method as reported in the literature [23,33]. The filtrate obtained was taken for further studies. The CFU measurement on the per day basis was carried out to confirm the absence of any form of contamination."
7,CO2 mitigation efficiency and biomass productivity,"2.6 CO2 mitigation efficiency and biomass productivity Gas phase analysis was performed to evaluate the CO2 mitigation efficiency of H. stevensii. The mitigation efficiency (%) was evaluated by analyzing the concentration of CO2 (g) at the bio-reactor inlet and outlet by using gas chromatograph (Model: GC-2014) [34]. The dimensions of Porapak-q column were of 1/8-inch internal diameter and 2 m of length. The column was designed to hold the maximum temperature of 250 °C. Helium (He) was used as the carrier gas at the flowrate of 12 mL min−1. The column and injection temperatures were 45 °C and 100 °C, respectively. The negative polarity was applied and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) temperature was 100 °C. The filtrate obtained from Section 2.5 was further analyzed for estimating dissolved CO2 concentration. The dissolved CO2 concentration was measured using the dissolved CO2 analyzer (Portable version, OxyGuard, USA). The biomass productivity (P Max, g L−1 d−1) and the specific growth rate (μ, d−1) were derived using Eqs. (1) and (2) [31,35]. (1) P max = ( X t − X o ) t 1 − t 0 where X t0 is the concentration of biomass (g L−1) at the beginning (t o) and X t1 is the concentration of biomass (g L−1) at the end of the cultivation period (t 1), respectively. (2) μ max = ln ( X t 1 ) − ln ( X t 0 ) t 1 − t 0"
8,Determination of carbon dioxide biofixation rate and utilization efficiency,"2.7 Determination of carbon dioxide biofixation rate and utilization efficiency The obtained biomass productivity ( P max ) was utilized further in calculating the rate of CO2 (g) fixation ( R CO 2 g L−1 d−1) using Eq.(3). (3) R CO 2 = C c P max M CO 2 M c where M CO 2 and M C are the molecular weight of CO2 and atomic weight of carbon, respectively. The carbon content (Cc) fixed in form of biomass was estimated by considering the 0.34 fraction of carbon in the biomass based on the typical molecular formula of microbial biomass obtained from the literature [36]. Actual CO2 utilization efficiency (RR CO2) for different culture conditions was derived using Eq. (4). (4) R ⋅ R CO 2 = Moles of CO 2 ( g ) fixed as C in biomass Moles of CO 2 ( g ) consumed × 100"
9,Analytical procedures and nutrient removal,"2.8 Analytical procedures and nutrient removal The concentration of nutrients were evaluated at the end of the incubation period of 6 days. The samples obtained from the post-incubation period were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was then filtered through 0.22 µm cellulose membrane filter (Whatman). The filtrate obtained was utilized to analyze COD, NO3 –, PO4 3 –, NO2 – and SO4 2 – ions using the standard protocols of the American Public Health Association (APHA) handbook. The percentage nutrient removal and the rate of utilization of nutrient were estimated as per the standard procedures given in the literature [31,37]."
10,FTIR analysis of biomass,"2.9 FTIR analysis of biomass The biomass obtained after centrifugation was freeze-dried. The primary identification and characterization of compounds produced from CO2 biofixation studies were investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Model – Frontier, Perkin Elmer, India). The equipment is equipped with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessory (GladiATR, PIKE Technologies, Inc.) with an internal reflection element as diamond plate and LiTaO3 as a detector. FTIR analysis was carried out for the cell lysate and supernatant produced from the CO2 biofixation studies. 10 mg of fine powdered freeze-dried biomass was placed onto the ATR crystals. FTIR was performed in the spectral range of 400–4000 cm−1 with the resolution of 4 cm −1 by following the procedure given in the previous study [21]. The spectra of all the samples were acquired in duplicates."
11,Biomass harvesting and recovery of fatty alcohols,"2.10 Biomass harvesting and recovery of fatty alcohols Cultures (~1.5 L) obtained after the incubation period of 6 days from the bio-reactor were utilized for biomass harvesting and product recovery. The methodology followed for biomass harvesting and product recovery is shown in Fig. 2. The cultures were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and at 4 °C for 20 min. The obtained supernatants were stored at 4 °C for further recovery of products. The biomass obtained after centrifugation was subjected to cell lysis. Fatty alcohols were extracted from the cell lysate by solvent extraction method. Laboratory grade chloroform and methanol with more than 99.6% purity was used in the ratio of 2:1 as the solvent for the extraction. Solvent was added to the biomass and placed in the orbital incubator shaker for phase separation at 120 rpm and 37 °C for a period of 2 h. The organic phase obtained after phase separation was concentrated on the rotary evaporator. The obtained sample was filtered and preserved at 4 °C for GC-MS analysis. The supernatant obtained in the centrifugation was subjected to solvent-solvent extraction by following the similar procedure as that of cell lysate."
12,GC-MS analysis,"2.11 GC-MS analysis The cell lysate and supernatant obtained were further concentrated using the rotary evaporator and then analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) (QP-2010 Plus, Shimadzu, Japan) system for value-added products by following the standard procedure given in the literature [21,23]. The column DB-5 MS (film thickness = 0.25 µm, i.d. = 0.25 mm, length = 30 m) was used. Concentrated sample of 1 μL volume of was injected. Helium (He) (head pressure = 86.5 kPa; flow rate = 1.21 mL min-1; split ratio = 10) was used as a carrier gas into the column. The initial column temperature maintained at 80 °C was increased at 10 °C/min to 250 °C and the temperature of the GC-MS interface was 280 °C. The ion source temperature was maintained at 110 °C. The obtained data were compared with the inbuilt standard mass spectra library system (NIST-05 and Wiley-8) of GC-MS."
13,Carbon balance,"2.12 Carbon balance The material balance in the existing system can be helpful in theoretically estimating the actual amount of CO2 assimilated as carbon into biomass. The actual CO2 utilization efficiency of microorganism can be further calculated using the given carbon balance. The carbon balance in a semi-continuous batch reactor system takes into account the unutilized CO2 which is present as gaseous CO2, dissolved CO2 and the CO2 exiting the reactor, continuously. It also takes into account the amount of CO2 utilized by microorganisms which are assimilated as biomass. Taking all these into account, the total elemental carbon balance is given by Eq. (5): (5) M C , in = M C , go + M C , bo + M C , CO 2 + M C , out where M C , in mass of carbon supplied as CO2, M C , go = carbon left in gaseous phase as CO2 at the end of batch study, M C , bo = carbon assimilated as biomass, M C , out = carbon exiting continuously at the outlet of reactor and M C , CO 2 (l) = dissolved CO2 in the aqueous phase."
14,Statistical analysis,"2.13 Statistical analysis All the experiments were performed in duplicates, and data of the present study are reported as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the two duplicates. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with OriginPro 8 was used to estimate the statistical variation between groups of discrete variables. A value of p < 0.1 was considered as statistical difference."
15,Results and discussion,"The semi-continuous studies, analyzing the growth performance of H. stevensii, for the duration of 6 days, in the presence of 10% (v/v) CO2 (g) concentration and at different culture media conditions (Section 2.3) were carried out in a laboratory scale bio-reactor (Fig. 1). The obtained results from these studies are analyzed and discussed in the subsequent sections."
16,Biomass growth and CO2 (g) biofixation rate in different culture conditions,"3.1 Biomass growth and CO2 (g) biofixation rate in different culture conditions The biomass was observed to grow continuously for the overall cultivation period. CO2 (g) was continuously measured at the gas outlet port of the reactor and CO2 mitigation efficiency on the per day basis was calculated and is represented in Fig. 3 for all culture media conditions. Significant increase in gaseous phase mitigation efficiency was observed on the first day of bio-reactor operation for all culture media conditions. This may be due to the fact that the solution pH was maintained at 10 at the start of biomitigation process and CO2 has shown higher solubility in water at higher solution pH. Hence, initially major amount of gaseous phase CO2 was utilized to maintain the equilibrium CO2 concentration in liquid phase. The gaseous phase CO2 (g) mitigation was observed as nearly constant after one day. The maximum and minimum gaseous phase mitigation efficiency came out to be 18.77% and 17.79% in case of domestic wastewater with 100 mM sulphate, 18.58% and 16.30% in case of DI water with 100 mM sulphate source and 17.48% and 13.8% with DWW water with no sulphate ions, respectively. The biomass growth of H. stevensii in terms of dry weight (g L−1) was measured for all culture media conditions and is shown in Fig. 4. The maximum biomass concentration was found to be 7.72 g L−1 in the case of domestic wastewater with 100 mM sulphate, 6.71 g L−1 in the case of DI water with 100 mM sulphate source and 5.31 g L−1 with DWW water with no sulphate ions. The cultivation media with no external addition of sulphate source has shown the lowest value of biomass produced and this may be due to the lesser availability of sulphate ions. The inherently present sulphate ions might have been consumed by the bacteria after the initial cultivation days and subsequently, lesser biomass was produced as compared to other two culture media. The availability of the energy substrate and the growth of microbes were observed to be directly related to the amount of CO2 (g) adopted by the cellular biomass concentration [21]. The existence of an adequate amount of energy and carbon substrate, have shown a continuous rise in the biomass concentration. CO2 utilization efficiency in the case of DWW water with 100 mM sulphate source and where no sulphate source was added was found to be 13.90% and 11.70%, respectively. This is comparable with the result of DWW water with 100 mM sulphate ions. The utilization efficiency in both cases of DI and DWW water with 100 mM sulphate ions was found to be equal and suggested that DI water could be replaced by DWW water. Hence it can be said that H. stevensii can be acclimatized in the DWW water without any considerable change in the efficiency of the process. Various bio-kinetic parameters such as maximum biomass concentration (g L−1), maximum specific growth rate (µmax), maximum biomass productivity (P max), maximum CO2 fixation rate and CO2 (g) utilization efficiency (RR CO2) are presented in Table 2. The culture supplemented with DI water (100 mM sulphate source) has shown the sustained growth for the overall period of cultivation. The total biomass concentration in the present case after six-day of the study was found to be maximum (7.72 g L−1) with the µmax value of 1.02 d−1, Pmax of 2.83 g L−1 d−1, R CO2 of 3.52 and η CO2 of 13.9%. The biomass productivity, specific growth rate and CO2 (g) fixation rate in the case of DI water with 100 mM sulphate source were maximum on the second day of run whereas, in the other two cases, these parameters were maximum on the first day of the run. In this case, the cultivation media is DI water with sulphate ions, hence, the rate of bacterial growth was found to be slower in comparison to the other two cases. After 24 h of study, the value of OD in case of DI water with sulphate ions was found to be 0.09 whereas, in both cases of DWW water, it was found to be 0.31. This may be due to the naturally available other nutrients and carbonate ions present in the DWW water. The presence of carbonates in the cultivation media might help to grow the bacteria as it is easier to utilize. Therefore, a very high value of µmax and P max were observed as 1.37 d−1 and 3.14 g L−1 d−1, respectively in the case of DWW water with sulphate ions. The study suggested the possible use of DWW water in place of DI water for the preparation of culture media and provide with the possible simultaneous solution of CO2 mitigation and wasterwater utilization. The change in the pH, bicarbonates and carbonates for all the three-culture media with time were plotted and is shown in Fig. 5 and 6. pH was found to decrease from 10 to 6.6, 7.0, and 7.1 for DI water with sulphate ions, DWW water with sulphate and DWW water without sulphate, respectively after one day when CO2 (g) got introduced in the system. At higher pH, OH– ions present in water reacts with aqueous CO2, to form bicarbonate ions. The lower utilization of bicarbonates by H. stevensii during first day and a higher rate of formation of carbonic acid may be the reason for the decrease in pH value of culture media [38]. Further, pH of the media was increased from 6.8 to 7.2, 7.4 to 7.6 and 7.1 to 7.2 for DI water with sulphate, DWW water with sulphate and DWW water without sulphate ions, respectively at the end of second day. This might be due to the increase in the utilization rate of HCO3 – with time by H. stevensii [23]. Later, no significant changes were observed in the pH value of all the three culture media. The variation in free CO2 (l) concentrations at various time intervals of cultivation for different culture media is shown in Fig. 7. An increasing trend of HCO3 – concentration in initial four days for DI water with 100 mM sulphate ions was observed and later, it was found to decrease. The concentration of HCO3 – was found to increase for the first two days for DWW water with no additional sulphate ions and then was found to decrease on the third day and remained stationary for the last three days and HCO3 – concentration by DWW water with 100 mM sulphate ions has shown more or less the similar trend as that of DI water with 100 mM sulphate ions. Initially, the concentration of CO3 2– was observed to get nearly constant and was found to increase slowly towards the end. This can be substantiated by the pH dependency of carbonate alkalinity formation. At pH value of approximately 8, it showed more bicarbonate alkalinity and less carbonate alkalinity. With a decrease in pH value, the bicarbonate alkalinity was found to increase, due to which there was less concentration of carbonates in comparison to bicarbonates in the present case. At very low pH value or at highly acidic conditions, there was more formation of CO2 alkalinity, which was found to decrease with an increase in pH."
17,Nutrient removal capacity under varying culture conditions,"3.2 Nutrient removal capacity under varying culture conditions The removal efficiency and removal rate of various nutrients such as NO3 –, Cl–, PO4 3–, COD, BOD and SO4 2– by H. stevensii under different culture conditions was determined after sixth day of the cultivation period ( Table 3). The elimination capacity of NO3 –, Cl–, PO4 3– was obtained in the range of 95–99.5% for all culture conditions. The sulphate elimination capacity of H. stevensii in the cases of both DWW and DI water with 100 mM sulphate concentration was found to be more than 99% and with DWW water with no additional sulphate ions was found to be 18.18%. Low sulphate removal in case of DWW water with no additional sulphate ions could be due to the lesser microbial activity and hence, lesser utilization of sulphate ions. The nitrate and the chloride ions consumption was found to be nearly equal in all cases (more than 95%). The concentration of nutrients present in effluent streams after treatment was found to be well below the discharge limit norms of the country. Hence, these results confirmed the survival of H Stevensii in domestic wastewater. The higher values of obtained BODs which are 66.5% and 55.5% as reported in the case of DWW in comparison to the DI water. This should be the obtained trend as DWW naturally has more amount of organic matter, unlike DI water. Hence, the oxygen required to degrade the organic matter should be more in case of wastewater, which is in agreement with the obtained results. The percentage removal of COD was found to be highest as 17.2% in the cases of DWW water with 100 mM sulphate ions. The results obtained for the significant removal of organic and inorganic substances confirmed that H. stevensii can be utilized for wastewater purification along with CO2 mitigation."
18,FT-IR analysis of samples obtained from CO2 bio-mitigation studies,"3.3 FT-IR analysis of samples obtained from CO2 bio-mitigation studies In order to recognize the valuable bio-molecules from CO2 bio-mitigation studies, preliminary FTIR analysis were performed. CO2 bio-mitigation samples were centrifuged, cell pellet was made and FT-IR analysis was performed on cell pellet. Further, the obtained supernatant was preserved and FTIR analysis was carried out. The biological samples are primarily complex and contain different proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. Hence, FT-IR spectrum is the result of their characteristic absorption bands and is explained in following subsections: 3.3.1 FT-IR spectra of cell pellet The FT-IR spectra of H. stevensii cell pellet obtained from CO2 bio-mitigation studies under three different culture conditions of DWW with 100 mM sulfate ions, DWW without additional sulfate ions and DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate ions are depicted in Fig. 8. Peak assignment to the FT-IR spectra is carried out as per the literature [39]. The prominent peaks (3433.88, 3446.87 and 3434.21 cm−1) in the region of 3700–3000 cm−1 indicate the presence of a significant quantity of hydroxyl groups (OH) in the structure (Fig. 8). These peaks correspond to the valence vibration of hydrogen bonded with OH group i.e., intra, inter or O‒H stretching. Further, the transmittance of these peaks are approximately equal to 90%. This confirms that the number of hydrogen bond present in all the cell pellets is of same nature as per Beer–Lambert’s law. Transmittance in the region of 3000–2800 cm−1 is primarily due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of C‒H stretches, CH2< and CH3‒ groups of lipids. The intensities of peak around 2960 cm−1 relates to CH2 symmetric stretching and CH2 asymmetric stretching. CH2 symmetric and asymmetric also have peak around 2800 cm−1 which was not recognized in Fig. 8. This may be due to the overlapping from strong OH band. Further, the region highlights the occurrence of fatty acids which is obvious from the cell wall. The weak peak obtained at 2560 cm−1 in the region of 2800–1400 cm−1 is attributed to thiol stretch. It may be due to the formation and reduction of disulfide bonds catalyzed by thiol-disulfide exchanging enzyme [40]. The transmittance in the range of 2000–1900 cm−1 is either related to conjugate double bonds or “pseudo” symmetric alkynes as shown in Fig. 8. Further, the peak obtained at ~1650 and ~1547 cm−1 indicate the presence of amide I and amide II bands, respectively. These vibrations have originated from the amide groups (COONH) of proteins, and is often an indicator of their secondary structure. Significant heterogeneity was observed between the spectra for DWW with 100 mM sulfate ions, DWW with additional sulfate ions and DI with thiosulfate ions in the spectral region of 1200–900 cm−1 and 1500–1300 cm−1 (Fig. 8(a)). Band changes in this region are associated with mainly macromolecules such as carbohydrates and polysaccharides represented by glucose, fructose, and glycogen. Peaks around 1200 and 1000 cm−1 are due to the antisymmetric and symmetric C‒O and P‒O areas as noticed in DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and phospholipids. Additionally, the peak 1450 and 834 cm−1 are related to the CO3 out-of-plane deformation mode of the CO3 2–. Further, as per IR peak assignment charts, C‒OH stretches appear in 1400–1300 cm−1 region of the IR spectrum. This is in line with the peak assignments given in the literature as around 1390 cm−1 for CO3 2− and around 1350 cm−1 for HCO3 − [41]. 3.3.2 FT-IR spectra of supernatant sample The cell free supernatant obtained from CO2 bio-mitigation studies was extracted and FT-IR spectroscopy was applied in order to preliminary identify molecules having economic benefits. The obtained spectra for culture conditions of DWW water with 100 mM sulfate ions, DWW water without additional sulfate ions and DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate ions as shown in Fig. 9 and illustrated in subsequent sections. Fig. 9 shows the FT-IR spectra of cell free supernatant having all four characteristic spectral regions. Region I (3700–3000 cm−1) indicates strong peaks at wavenumbers 3453.97, 3451.20, 3435.09 cm−1. It is attributed to the hydroxyl groups (OH) in the structure at appreciable amount (Fig. 9). The valence vibration of hydrogen bonded with OH group i.e., intra, inter or O‒H stretching is the reason for the obtained peaks [39]. Additionally, the transmittance of these peaks are greater than 90% for all the samples of supernatant. Thus, as per Beer-Lambert’s law, number of hydrogen bond present is of same nature [39]. In case of cell pellet, the region of 3000–2800 cm−1 is the region dominated by the fatty acids related to the bacterial cell membrane. Also, peaks around 2900 and 2800 cm−1 are assigned to the asymmetric or symmetric stretches of their methyl or methylene group, respectively. However, no such peaks are observed in the FT-IR spectra of the supernatant (Fig. 9). It may be due to the overlapping of strong ‒OH band with the weak signals of 2900 and 2800 cm−1. It also signifies the limited amount of fatty acids present in the supernatant. Region III (2800–1400 cm−1) reflects the proteinaceous type content in the supernatant due to the two intense peaks around 1600 cm−1 related to the vibrations of amide I and II bands, respectively [39]. Further, 1500–1200 cm−1 is considered as a mixed region, as it is informative for proteins, fatty acids, and other phosphate-carrying compounds (Fig. 9). In addition, peak at ~1230 cm−1 is due to the symmetric stretching of phosphodiester groups in nucleic acids or phospholipids. The peak at ~1383 cm−1 can be attributed to the symmetric bending of the methyl or methylene groups as well as the C‒O symmetric stretching of carbohydrates [39]. Region IV (1400–900 cm−1) is shown the dominance of compounds having ‒OH bending vibrations, ‒C‒O‒H in-plane bending vibrations, –CH3, out-of-plane bending vibrations, ‒CH2‒ wagging and twisting vibrations (Fig. 9). The C‒OH of ‒COOH is indicated by the presence of vibrational bands around 1230 cm−1. The spectral features of carboxylic acid in the energy range of 900–1200 cm−1 were caused by the vibrations of C‒OH (alcohol), C‒C, and C‒H groups. As a whole, the FTIR spectra predominantly indicated functional groups associated with each region of carboxylic acid and polyschharides [39]."
19,GC-MS analysis,"3.4 GC-MS analysis The cell lysate and supernatant obtained from CO2 fixation batch study are subjected to GC-MS for identifying and confirming different compounds present in the sample. Analyzing sample via GC-MS technique usually considered as specific test which gives insight about particular substance present in a given sample. Further, this helps in developing the value addition strategy of recovering valuable compounds. The obtained spectra of GC-MS are matched with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectra library and obtained results are illustrated in the subsequent subsections. 3.4.1 GC-MS analysis of cell lysate After the CO2 fixation batch studies, the cell lysate is obtained via methodology described in Section 2.3 and resulting samples are analyzed with GC-MS. GC-MS analysis of the cell lysate extract of DI and DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate ions show the presence of fatty alcohol and hydrocarbons in considerable amount with match quality ranging from 80% to 98% ( Tables 4–6). GC spectrum area of cell lysate from culture condition of DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate has shown approximately 8.33% which was comprised of fatty alcohols and has carbon chain length ranging from C8-C27. The major fatty alcohols present are the compounds such as 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (3.21%), 1-Dodecanol (0.84%), Hexadecanol (1.17%), n-Nonadecanol-1 (1.35%), Behenic alcohol (0.88%) and 1-Heptacosanol (0.88%) (Table 4). The fatty alcohols obtained from cell lysate extract of DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate comprised of 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (3.28%), 1-Dodecanol (0.83%), n-Tridecan-1-ol (1.20%), n-Pentadecanol (1.27%), Behenic alcohol (0.84%), 1-Heptacosanol (0.69%), and n-Tetracosanol-1 (0.41%). Hence, the total percentage areas of fatty alcohols obtained are 8.52% of the area of GC-MS spectrum (Table 5). The cell lysate extract obtained from DWW water without additional thiosulfate has shown the presence of 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (2.39%), 1-Dodecanol (0.62%), n-Tridecan-1-ol (0.87%), n-Pentadecanol (1.00%), and Behenic alcohol (0.67%) (Table 6). The obtained results indicates a minute increase in fatty alcohol content as the culture condition changes from DI water to DW water. It is due to the presence of such compounds, which are inherent to DWW and utilized by H. stevensii for synthesizing fatty alcohols. However, the presence of thiosulfate ions show negligible increment when DWW water is used for CO2 fixation studies. This indicates that it is not thiosulfate rather extreme culture conditions that drives H. stevensii to produce fatty alcohols [20]. Further, the percentage area of branched fatty alcohol (2-Ethyl-1-hexanol) is decreased from 3.28% to 2.39% when DWW water with thiosulfate was employed. This also suggest that the production of branched fatty alcohols is linked to the presence of energy source and requires further investigation which is beyond scope of the present work. The obtained results are in agreement with reported literature about bacterial production of fatty alcohols [42,43]. The obtained results are supported by the FT-IR analysis that highlighted the occurrence of compounds having long carbon chain length along with -OH group (Section 3.3.1). In addition, GC-MS analysis of cell lysate extract of DI and DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate cell lysate extract confirmed the presence of alkane, and alkene with match quality ranging from 80% to 98% (Tables 4–6). The percentage area of hydrocarbons is 5.65%, 8.73% and 8.73% of the total GC-MS spectra for cell lysate extract of DI and DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate respectively. The major compounds of hydrocarbons identified are Dodecane, Tetradecane and Nonadecane (Tables 4–6). It can be seen that the % area of total hydrocarbon found to increase with change in cultivation condition from DI water to DWW water. However, the presence of thiosulfate does not shown any considerable effect on the synthesis of hydrocarbons. It may be due to the occurrence of compounds other than essential compounds in the DWW water. The FT-IR spectrum of the cell lysate extract under all three culture conditions suggested the presence of hydrocarbons and also supported by the GC-MS analysis. 3.4.2 GC-MS analysis of supernatant The cell free supernatants are obtained via the methodology described in Section 2.3 and subjected to GC-MS analysis. The obtained result of the supernatant extract of DI and DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate revealed majorly the occurrence of fatty alcohol and branched hydrocarbons in considerable amount with match quality ranging from 79% to 94% ( Tables 7–9). The GC-MS analysis of supernatant obtained from the culture conditions of DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate has shown approximately 5.54% of fatty alcohols having carbon chain length ranges from C12-C14. The major fatty alcohols present are the compounds such as 1-Dodecanol (4.03%), and Tetradecanol (1.51%) (Table 7). The fatty alcohols obtained from supernatant extract of DWW water with 100 mM thiosulfate are mainly n-Nonadecanol-1(0.11%). (Table 8). The Cell lysate extract obtained from DWW water without additional thiosulfate has shown the presence of 1-Dodecanol (3.69%), n-Tridecan-1-ol (1.52%), n-Pentadecanol (0.88%), and n-Heptadecanol-1 (0.53%). Thus, revealed the presence of 6.62% area of the total area of the GC-MS spectrum (Table 9). The obtained results indicate increase in fatty alcohol content as the culture conditions changes from DI water to DWW water. It owe to the compounds, which are inherent to DWW water and utilized by H. stevensii for synthesizing fatty alcohols. However, the absence of thiosulfate found to affect the fatty alcohol synthesis and indicate considerable increment when DWW water is used for CO2 fixation studies. This indicates that thiosulfate absence result in the extracellular synthesis of H. stevensii. Further, the branched fatty alcohol (2-Ethyl-1-hexanol) is found to be absent in the GC-MS spectra of all three culture conditions. The obtained results are confirmed by the FT-IR analysis that highlighted the occurrence of compounds having long carbon chain length along with -OH group (Section 3.3.2). Additionally, GC-MS analysis of supernatant extract of DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate indicate the presence of branched alkane, and alkene with match quality ranging from 79% to 90% (Tables 7–9). The percentage area of branched hydrocarbons is obtained as 5.38%, and 5.22% of the total GC-MS spectra for supernatant extract of DI water with 100 mM thiosulfate and DWW water without thiosulfate, respectively. The major compounds of hydrocarbons identified are Undecane, 4,7-dimethyl-, Decane, 2,4-dimethyl-, Hexadecane and Heptadecane (Tables 7–9). It is observed from the Tables 7–9 that the % area of total hydrocarbon found to increase with change in cultivation condition from DI water to DW water. Further, the presence thiosulfate does not shown any considerable effect on the synthesis of hydrocarbons. However, the absence of thiosulfate result in the synthesis of un-branched long chain hydrocarbons (Tables 7–9). The obtained results are in line with the FT-IR spectrum of the supernatant extract under all three culture conditions. Hence, the isolate H. stevensii have shown its ability to capture CO2 while using DWW water as growth media, can also be utilized in tandem to extract valuable bio-molecule like fatty alcohol as suggested by FT-IR and GC-MS analysis and hence, solve the dual purpose."
20,Carbon balance,3.5 Carbon balance The total amount of carbon provided to the system was estimated based on the difference of inlet and outlet concentration of CO2 (g) using ideal gas law and was estimated as 203.8 g. The three culture conditions and the parameters were kept same for the total cultivation period. The concentration of CO2 (g) at the outlet of the bio-reactor was measured regularly after every 24 h. The time-weighted average of the outlet percentage CO2 (g) was then multiplied with the total CO2 (g) supplied as carbon into the system to calculate the total amount of carbon leaving the system as gaseous CO2 (g). The total amount of carbon present in the liquid phase is in the form of bicarbonates and carbonates along with total carbon consumed and is equal to the amount of carbon assimilated as biomass. The results are summarized and is shown in Table 10. The difference in LHS and RHS came out to be in the range of 12–16 g after substituting these values in Eq. (5). This may be due to the assimilation of some amount of carbon in the fatty acids and alcohols and their presence was confirmed by FTIR and GC-MS.
21,CO2 fixation mechanism,"3.6 CO2 fixation mechanism One of the approach of CO2 fixation mechanism by bacterial route is given in our earlier study [44]. However, primarily the mechanism is discussed with the autotrophic organisms impacting the carbon cycle globally. The plants are considered as primary producers for long time and hence, de novo, the reductive pentose phosphate cycle or rPP cycle is directly linked with the photosynthesis. The light is essential for CO2 fixation and it suggests that all photosynthetic microorganisms follow rPP pathway to fix CO2. However, Sergei Winogradsky (founders of modern microbiology) discovered that autotrophy via rPP cycle is also carried out by energy harnessed from inorganic molecules as electron donors, process which is an example of chemolithoautotrophy [45]. It has been understood that there are five CO2 fixation pathways other than rPP cycle, which are discovered for CO2 fixation by microorganisms in nature. These comprised of (1) the Wood–Ljungdahl Pathway (WLP, operated by acetogens to convert CO2:H2, CO or other C1 feedstock's into acetyl-CoA) (2) the reductive (or reverse) tricarboxylic acid pathway (3) the dicarboxylate 4-hydroxybutyrate pathway (4) 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate or HP/HB cycle and (5) the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle pathway [46–48]. Recently one of the bacteria was found to utilize arsenic as electron donor for fixing CO2 in the form of HCO3 – to the biomass [49]. The different studies have suggested the fixation of CO2 and its distribution in cytosolic pool by bacterium in the absence of light using electron donor as energy substrate [24,50,51]. Thus, CO2 fixation utilizing electron donor as energy substrate is possible. Hence in the present study, it can be understood that, CO2 is getting accumulated into the cytosolic pool of bacterial species H. stevensii by harnessing the energy of thiosulfate ion S2O3 2–. The GC-MS analysis suggested the significant presence of hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols in the all the samples."
22,Comparison with existing literature,"3.7 Comparison with existing literature The performance of H.stevensii for CO2 mitigation in the present work is compared with the performance of the reported studies. The values of maximum biomass produced (X max) (g L−1), maximum biomass productivity (P max) (g L−1 d−1) and maximum CO2 fixation rate ( R CO 2 ) (g L−1 d−1) at different concentrations of inlet gases reported in literature are summarized in Table 11. The obtained X max, P max and R CO 2 are obtained in the range of 7.7–1.3 g L−1, 3.92–1.55 g L−1 d−1 and 4.01–0.12 g L−1 d−1, respectively for different microalgae and cyanobacteria species. The values of X max, P max and R CO 2 for all the conditions used in the particular study are found to be more than the results obtained from the reported studies. The maximum CO2 fixation rate ( R CO 2 ) for the present study in all cases is found to be in the range of 3.75 ± 0.3 which is higher than the previous work for the H. stevensii and lower than the values estimated for Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus strains of algae. Most of the studies reported in the literature related to the bacterial mitigation of gaseous pollutants and producing biochemicals are based on engineered bacterial strain or via isolation of enzymes. However, in the present study, H. stevensii was isolated from the extreme saline environment and this can be one of the possible reasons for higher CO2 fixation rate. There are few studies which have reported the use of Halomonas species to produce C-11 to C-18 carbon compounds and have also reported their industrial applications [52,53]. The high air flowrate, higher CO2 tolerance, potential to grow in wastewater along with better CO2 (g) fixation ability of H. stevensii can make it a viable technique for the simultaneous mitigation of CO2, wastewater treatment and production of valuable chemicals which indicates the feasibility for the concept of biorefinery."
23,Techno-economic assessment,"The feasibility of the proposed process is evaluated by carrying out the techno-economic assessment for replacing DI water with DWW water as a cultivation media in the laboratory and pilot scale process and is discussed in the subsequent sections. The cost analysis was mainly based on the operating cost by considering the fact that cost associated with manpower, bio-reactor and maintenance can be the same for the process operation for all culture media. The cost of chemicals, different type of water and CO2 was taken from HiMedia and Merck catalogue (2018–2019) [58,59], respectively for laboratory scale process and are given in Table 12. The operating cost for a batch of 2 L working volume reactor was estimated for all the three culture media conditions. The maximum cost of DI water with 100 mM thiosulphate was found to be $0.8526 per batch and DWW water with no additional thiosulphate had a minimum of $0.4461 per batch operating cost. This higher cost in case of DI water is obtained due to the cost of thiosulphate ions. The operating cost of DWW water with 100 mM thiosulphate ions was less than the DI water with 100 mM thiosulphate which may be due to fact that additional thiosulphate was added in DWW water to maintain the 100 mM concentration. The operating cost was also estimated for the production of 1 kg of biomass in laboratory scale process and is represented in Table 12. The operating cost of DI water with 100 mM thiosulphate ($55.202) and DWW water with 100 mM thiosulphate ($ 57.624) was obtained nearly equal to produce one kg of biomass. However, the operating cost per kg of biomass was obtained significantly less ($42.56) as compared to other two culture conditions. The techno-economic analysis for laboratory scale process has indicated the feasibility for the replacement of DI water with DWW water. This fact was also established by carrying out the same analysis for 500 times scaled up process for all the three culture media. In scaled up process, the parameters such as initial pH, temperature, flow rate of gas, initial CO2 concentration, stirrer speed and cultivation period were kept same as laboratory scale process. The total volume and working volume of bio-reactor were considered as 1500 L and 1000 L, respectively. The commercial cost of chemicals was obtained from import export data of India obtained from Zauba link [60]. Different types of water and CO2 cost were considered same as laboratory scale process. However, the cost of power in terms of electricity was estimated by considering the power required for pumping, to run centrifuge and for agitator in the commercial scale process as it may be significant for large scale operations [61]. In the present work, the cost of one unit of electricity in kWh is assumed to be $0.081 [62]. The operating cost per batch of experiment and per kg of biomass was calculated for all the three culture media and are given in Table 12. Based on the cost estimation obtained for commercial scale process, the same conclusions can be drawn as laboratory scale process. These estimations ascertain the fact that DI water with 100 mM thiosulphate can be replaced with DWW water for industrial scale operations. The added advantage of using DWW water as cultivation media reduces the man power cost and the capital cost for reverse osmosis (RO) process which may be required for wastewater treatment. The present work clearly indicated that the replacement of pure water with domestic wastewater and utilizing the concomitant inorganic compounds of wastewater as a nutrient source for the growth of bacteria can be one of the viable options."
24,Conclusions,"Biofixation of CO2(g) by H. stevensii was successfully demonstrated in a laboratory scale semi-continuous bio-reactor at different culture media conditions. The higher values of µmax (1.37 d−1) and P max (3.14 g L−1 d−1) suggest the possible use of DWW water in place of DI water for the preparation of culture media. Significant removal of organic and inorganic pollutants which also act as nutrients (NO3 –, Cl–, PO4 3–, SO4 2 –, COD and BOD) established the fact that H. stevensii can be utilized for wastewater purification along with CO2 mitigation. FTIR and GC-MS analysis confirmed the biofixation of CO2(g) into various compounds including fatty acids, fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons. Biofixation of CO2(g) into biomass was also established by carbon balance. The possible pathway for the biofixation of CO2 utilizing H. stevensii is suggested to be rPP cycle. Preliminary techno-economic analysis clearly indicates the possibility of replacing pure water with domestic wastewater and utilizing the concomitant inorganic compounds of wastewater as a nutrient source for the growth of bacteria. CO2 (g) fixation ability of H. stevensii at higher flowrate, higher CO2 concentration and in the presence of DWW can understood to be one of the viable options for the simultaneous mitigation of CO2, possible wastewater treatment method and lead to production of valuable chemicals."
