0,Introduction,"The intense use of fossil resources for the design of hitherto unknown polymeric materials marked the first half of the 20th century, when the idea prevailed that these processes would not compromise the immense oil reserves available on the planet. Equally preliminary was the knowledge of the scientific community on the environmental impacts related to the emission of greenhouse gases, a fact that cannot be dissociated from processes based on the petrochemical industry. The confirmation of the long-term drastic consequences of the indiscriminate use of the fossil platform has motivated both academic and industrial sectors to turn their attention to the rational use of renewable resources, in order to meet, at least partially, an increasing demand for energy and materials [1]. This concern for sustainability has been steadily growing from the beginning of the third millennium. Lignocellulosic biomass, mainly composed of a close association of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, is a key raw material in this context, being widely explored for the preparation of chemicals, energy and materials. Hemicelluloses constitute about 20–30% of the total mass of annual and perennial plants and have a heterogeneous composition of various sugar units, depending on the type of plant and extraction process. In hardwoods, xylans (β-1,4-linked D-xylose units) may reach up to 90% of the total hemicellulose content, finding numerous industrial applications. Furfural and furfuryl alcohol are industrial commodities that can be readily and economically prepared from a vast array of agricultural and forestry wastes containing xylans [1]. Vegetable biomass has been successfully considered for the production of macromolecular materials for decades, as it corresponds, on the one hand, to an abundant and cost effective raw material widely distributed along the planet, and on the other hand, to the only natural resource capable of offering, simultaneously, sufficient amounts of renewable carbon and an impressive range of possibilities for the extraction of monomers, oligomers and polymers with the most diverse molecular structures [1]. Vegetable oils (VO) are among the main biomass derivatives from which are extracted a series of platform chemicals, such as fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters, diols, (di)amines, thiols, isocyanates, lactones, and others [2]. In the context of polymer science, VO have been placed in a prominent position due to their high natural availability and to the fact that their oligomeric aliphatic skeleton contributes as a major element in the building of original macromolecules. Different approaches are indeed possible, including the breakdown of unsaturated triglycerides by transesterification reactions followed by functionalization of the ensuing ester's double bonds by epoxidation, metathesis and click reactions, among many others [3]. The strategy per se allows to develop original polymeric materials, but the possibilities are even broader thanks to the polyfunctional character of the molecules, that allows to carry out a series of post-polymerization chemical modifications, and to the ensuing potential associations with other polymeric materials of different chemical natures to produce copolymers, blends and composites. This explains why VO have been on the spotlight for decades for the implementation of sustainable technologies in the context of polymers from renewable resources. In recent years, a number of monographs including books [3], book chapters [4] and review articles [5] have been devoted to the use of VO in the synthesis of new polymeric materials. In general, two classes of macromolecular structures are formed, including: (i) linear materials obtained from isolated (and often chemically modified) bifunctional fatty acids, and (ii) highly branched and crosslinked materials resulting from multifunctional triglyceride polymerization reactions [6]. Focusing on the second strategy and considering reactions involving chain-growth mechanisms (free radical and cationic polymerization), the copolymerization of biologically natural unsaturated oligomeric triglycerides with vinyl monomers such as styrene, divinylbenzene, α-methylstyrene or cyclopentadiene, is classically conducted to overcome important limitations, including, on the one hand, the relatively low reactivity of triglycerides and, on the other, their long aliphatic moieties, leading to materials that often do not exhibit the necessary stiffness for some structural applications [7–10]. The association of VO with other renewable aromatic structures, such as lignin derivatives, is an example of an intelligent and efficient strategy for tuning such properties [11]. The high reactivity of conjugated trienes in chain growth polymerization mechanisms [12] stimulated the application of tung oil (TO, approximately 85% of α-eleostearic acid) as natural oligomeric raw material for the development of original polymers [8–10,13–18]. TO is extracted from the seeds of a non-edible fruit produced by the Vernicia fordii tree, a medium-sized hardwood tree of the Euphorbiaceae family, native of southern China, Myanmar and northern Vietnam. Photocured coatings were prepared from combinations of TO, hazelnut oil and isosorbide, using triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate as cationic photoinitiator [14]. Crude TO was polymerized in the presence of different amounts of poly(ε-caprolactone) and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BFE), and the materials, classified as semi-interpenetrating networks, were characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical properties [15]. BFE was also employed to initiate the polymerization of TO, methyl α-eleostearate (ME), styrene and divinylbenzene in different molar ratios to produce polymer networks [16]. Auad et al. described the cationic copolymerization of TO with myrcene and limonene as comonomers, also using BFE as initiator [17]. As an alternative, the polymerization of TO and ME was recently thorough investigated using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as catalyst, a Brønsted acid of moderate strength [18]. TO was also associated with furans [19,20] for the preparation of linear and cross-linked structures based on the Diels-Alder click reaction. In fact, furan polymers constitute a large family of macromolecular materials that can be produced by different mechanisms, including step- and chain-growth polymerization reactions, leading to original structures of interesting properties, even when involving a very modest quantitative intervention or presence of furan rings [21]. The synthesis of a very promising furan-based building block was recently reported [22], bearing a diene directly linked to the furan C2, which can be submitted to a series of polymerization mechanisms, especially for the preparation of rubbery materials. A systematic study conducted by Choura, Belgacem and Gandini [23] on the acid-catalyzed polycondensation of xylan-based furfuryl alcohol (FA), one of the most common furan derivatives obtained from natural pentose polysaccharides, unraveled the various mechanisms accompanying this complex system, which yields in all cases black, highly crosslinked, rigid and fragile polymers. These characteristics constitute a limitation in the applications of the resins derived from FA, and hence the need to adjust the properties of these materials and expand their possible applications. Since the publication of this study in the second half of the 1990s, interesting initiatives were put forward aiming to complement the information on the molecular structure of intermediate oligomers and final polymers [24,25], as well as to establish conditions to minimize crosslinking by ring-opening the FA ring during the course of the polymerization [26]. An interesting contribution towards FA-based renewable materials of tunable mechanical properties is, in our mind, its association with unsaturated vegetable oils (such as TO), in order to combine the high intrinsic flexibility of the crosslinked polymer of the oil with the stiffness of the FA resin, leading to a fully bio-based crosslinked material with a lower glass transition temperature (Tg) with respect to the polymer formed solely of FA, but higher than that of the TO polymer. Possible applications include coatings with higher thermal, mechanical, and waterproof performances. In the present work, the xylan-based furfuryl alcohol was associated to TO for the preparation of networks using TFA as cationic catalyst. For this purpose, three approaches were essayed: (i) combining crude TO and FA, (ii) combining ME and FA, and (iii) using furfuryl α-eleostearate alone, which was inspired on a study published by Buchwalter [27], related to the polymerization of furfuryl acetate, in which he demonstrated that this strategy potentially eliminates competing reactions related to the presence of water formed in the FA condensation steps, replaced in this case by acetic acid. Here, the choice of a cationic mechanism promoted by an acid of moderate strength should prevent the rapid formation of the FA crosslinked homopolymer, leading to the desired association with the oil. It is important to mention that although the polymerization of FA catalyzed by TFA was already previously reported [28], this acid was never considered to initiate the polymerization of vegetable oil natural oligomers. Therefore, the present study was preceded by a thorough investigation of the cationic polymerization of TO and ME using TFA as initiator, in order to understand the mechanistic aspects related to both systems and access the properties of the respective final materials [18]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tung oil (TO) was purchased from General Iron Fittings Ltda. (São Paulo, Brazil). Furfuryl alcohol (FA, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), chloroform (Qhemis, 99%), dichloromethane (Qhemis, 99%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.9% Sigma-Aldrich), chloroform‑d 1 (CDCl3, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99,96%), triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and methanol (Qhemis, anhydrous) were used as received unless otherwise stated. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was used in solution with chloroform, in two different concentrations, i.e., 3 mol L−1 (TFA3M) and 5 mol L−1 (TFA5M)."
3,Instrumentation,"2.2 Instrumentation TO, ME, FE and the corresponding polymers were characterized by FTIR (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100, ATR mode) and 1H/13C NMR (Bruker, 9.4 Tesla/400 MHz), and their thermal properties were assessed by TGA with a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 equipment, working with a nitrogen flow of 20 mL min−1 and heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperature ranged from 25 to 700 °C."
4,"Synthesis of methyl α-eleostearate (ME, Scheme 1)","2.3 Synthesis of methyl α-eleostearate (ME, Scheme 1) ME was prepared from commercial TO by its transesterification with methanol, as described by Meiorin et al. [9]. Its NMR and FTIR spectra are discussed in the result section."
5,"Synthesis of furfuryl α-eleostearate (FE, Scheme 1)","2.4 Synthesis of furfuryl α-eleostearate (FE, Scheme 1) FE was prepared from commercial TO by its transesterification with an excess of FA (1:30 mol), catalyzed by 1 mol% of TBD (is respect to TO), under THF reflux for 4 h. Chloroform was added to the reaction mixture and successive washes with water were conducted to remove the catalyst and unreacted FA. The organic phase was then dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the excess of chloroform eliminated in a rotary evaporator. The product was characterized and its NMR and FTIR spectra are discussed in the result section."
6,Monitoring of polymerization reactions by 1H NMR spectroscopy,"2.5 Monitoring of polymerization reactions by 1H NMR spectroscopy In order to better understand the mechanism involved in the polymers chain growth under the different conditions tested, samples were prepared directly in NMR tubes according to the formulations presented in Table 1 (ME and FA polymerizations), and in Table 2 (FE polymerization). Samples were kept under a nitrogen atmosphere with final TFA concentrations of 0.6 mol L−1, 0.9 mol L−1 and 1.2 mol L−1 and were homogenized and kept at room temperature, and 1H NMR spectra were acquired before and shortly after the addition of TFA, and then after 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 8 h, 26 h, 34 h, 58 h and 105 h of reaction. In all cases, CDCl3 was used as solvent. FA was added 26 h after the beginning of polymerization of samples MEFA1, MEFA2 and MEFA3. This strategy was adopted to avoid the formation of homopolymers of FA, known to rapidly react in acid medium [22], by firstly forming active centers and growing polymer chains exclusively from ME."
7,Polymers synthesis,"2.6 Polymers synthesis (a) Copolymer of tung oil and furfuryl alcohol (P1) 2 g of TO (2.4 mmol), 0.56 g of FA (5.8 mmol), 1 mL of TFA5 M (5 mmol) and 2 mL of chloroform were mixed under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution quickly became black and its viscosity increased after approximately 1 h. Gelation was observed after 24 h of reaction, when the content was transferred to a beaker with an excess of chloroform, neutralized with drops of triethylamine and kept under stirring. The polymer (P1, insoluble fraction) was isolated by filtration, dried in a fume hood, extracted in a Soxhlet system with dichloromethane reflux (40 °C) and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C before further characterization. (b) Copolymers of methyl α-eleostearate and furfuryl alcohol (P2 and P3) Two reaction conditions were tested in this case. First, 2 g of ME (6.8 mmol), 2 mL of TFA3 M (6 mmol) and 2 mL of chloroform were kept under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. Then, 1.13 g of FA (11.5 mmol) were added and the solution was kept under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h, when gelation occurred. The second strategy involved the reaction of 2 g of ME (6.8 mmol), 2 mL of TFA5 M (10 mmol) and 2 mL of chloroform under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 days. Then, 1.13 g of FA (11.5 mmol) was added and the solution was kept under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h, when gelation took place. In both cases, the contents were transferred to a beaker with an excess of chloroform, neutralized with drops of triethylamine and kept under magnetic stirring. The polymers (P2 and P3, insoluble fractions) were isolated as described for P1. (c) Polymers of furfuryl α-eleostearate (P4–P8) 0.5 g of FE (1.4 mmol), 0.5 mL of TFA (concentrations varying from 0.3 to 5 M, Table 3 ) and 0.5 mL of chloroform were kept under magnetic stirring under nitrogen atmosphere. In all cases, at the end of the reaction the contents were transferred to a beaker with excess of chloroform, neutralized with drops of triethylamine and kept under magnetic stirring. For P4 and P5, no gelation was observed after 7 days of reaction. After neutralization with triethylamine, the solutions were washed with water to remove salts, the organic phase was dried by anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the excess of chloroform vacuum removed. In the case of P6, an increased viscosity was observed after 3 h of reaction, but no gelation occurred in the course of 5 days. After neutralization with triethylamine, the solution was precipitated in cold hexane, dried and extracted with dichloromethane in a Soxhlet system. P7 and P8 were neutralized and isolated by simple filtration. All polymers were dried under vacuum before characterization. Table 3 summarizes the experiment conditions, with corresponding sample codes."
8,Results and discussion,
9,"Characterization of TO, ME and FE","3.1 Characterization of TO, ME and FE Fig. 1 illustrates the FTIR spectra of FE, prepared by transesterification with FA, and Fig. 2 depicts its corresponding 1H NMR spectra. The full spectroscopic characterization of TO and methyl α-eleostearate is reported elsewhere [18]. FTIR spectra (Fig. 1a) showed peaks at 3013 and 1646 and 965 cm−1, that correspond, respectively, to sp2 CH stretch, CC stretch and =C-H out of plane bending of the three conjugated unsaturations of the fatty acid. Also, the appearance of the peak at 1438 cm−1 in the furfuryl α-eleostearate spectra, related to vibrations of the CH bonds of the methylene ester group (–COOCH2–), and peaks at 3151, 3122 and 995 cm−1, characteristic of the furan ring, confirmed the transesterification reaction. The 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 1b) showed resonances (ppm) at: (i) 0.90, assigned to the –CH3 group at the end of the chain, (ii) 1.18–1.44, for centered –CH2 sequences, (iii) 1.62, for –CH2 near the carbonyl group, (iv) multiple peaks between 1.95 and 2.34 referring to –CH2 groups near the unsaturations and to the –CH2 groups positioned immediately next to the carbonyl function, and (v) multiple peaks between 5.25 and 6.56 for the unsaturated =CH. Peaks positioned at (ppm) 5.10, 6.20, 6.30 and 7.35 belong to furan protons. The presence of a peak at 4.61 ppm in the FE 1H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of traces of unreacted FA from the transesterification reaction."
10,Monitoring of polymerization reactions by 1H NMR spectroscopy,"3.2 Monitoring of polymerization reactions by 1H NMR spectroscopy Polymerization reactions were conducted under different conditions and monitored by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). Based on studies described in literature [9,15a,22], some structures are expected considering, basically, the occurrence of homo- or copolymerization of the monomers tested. Meiorin et al. [9] prepared crosslinked polymers from mixtures of tung oil and methyl α-eleostearate via cationic mechanism and suggested the formation of a structure bearing residual double bonds even after gelation, while Madbouly et al. [15a] presented a possible structure for tung oil cationic polymer, indicating the total conversion of double bonds. Regarding the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol, Choura, Belgacem and Gandini [23] suggested that two main reactions are involved in the formation of poly(furfuryl alcohol), i.e., (i) the condensation of -OH group with the hydrogen atom of the C5 heterocycle leading to structure I (Scheme 2 ), and (ii) the less frequent OH-OH condensation, which forms occasional -CH2OCH2- bonds (structure II, Scheme 2). The loss of formaldehyde molecules from structure II also generates structure I [23]. However, as the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol evolves, an intense dark color is progressively observed and the final materials are not linear but insoluble resins, which can be explained by the formation of structures III and IV (Scheme 2) [23]. Figs. 2–8 correspond to a sequence of 1H NMR spectra, conducted according to Tables 1 and 2. It is important to mention that although 1H NMR is a very robust analytical tool, the complexity of the system limits to precisely propose details on the mechanisms involved in each case. However, it is possible to detect differences in the chain growth of FA in the presence of ME, when compared to the chain growth of FE, at different TFA concentrations. The cationic polymerization of ME with FA was performed under the conditions described in Table 1. The initial ME spectrum (Fig. 2) was acquired before the addition of TFA. Signal assignments are given elsewhere [18]. The evolution of the three polymerization reactions as a function of time is shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. In all cases, furfuryl alcohol was added after 26 h of reaction. Although additional spectra were acquired for other reaction times, they are omitted here because they did not show significant differences. In all cases, one can observe a gradual reduction of the unsaturation signals (5.0–6.5 ppm), which is a strong indication that the ME double bonds were consumed, and the molecules were incorporated into the polymer chain. However, even after longer periods, there is a persistent presence of a multiplet at about 5.25 ppm, in accordance with the structure proposed by Meiorin et al. [9] After 26 h of reaction, FA was added, with the appearance of signals at 4.44 ppm, from the -CH2 protons directly linked to the hydroxyl group, and 6.18, 6.26 and 7.30 ppm, corresponding to the furan H3, H4 and H5 protons, respectively. Despite the overlap of signals from FA protons and ME unsaturations, it is possible to observe that the integrations of the H5 furan ring proton signals were reduced as a function of time. This reduction was proportional to the concentration of the initiator, indicating that the higher concentration of TFA (1.2 M, Fig. 5) enabled a greater consumption of monomers in the same time interval. Scheme 3 shows a possible mechanism for the polymerization of ME followed by the addition of FA for the synthesis of copolymers. Considering that the copolymer is being formed, signals should be expected to appear in the 1H NMR spectrum relative to the incorporation of both monomers into the polymer chain. With respect to ME, the main difference that follows the growth of the polymeric chain in the 1H NMR spectra is relative to the consumption of protons linked to unsaturated carbons, which is observed as reaction evolves for the three TFA concentrations. In the case of FA, the hydroxyl proton unfortunately does not generate a clear peak in 1H NMR spectrum, which could be a useful indicator for monitoring the reaction progress. However, a reduction in the H5 hydrogen signal is observed for all acid concentrations, which indicates that furan rings are being incorporated into the macromolecular chain. The only spectral evidence for copolymer formation occurs for TFA concentrations of 0.9 M and 1.2 M due to the appearance and progressive increase of a singlet at 5.24 ppm. This signal may refer to the proton highlighted in Scheme 3, which is considerably less shielded than the protons of the -CH2 next to the hydroxyl groups of furfuryl alcohol. It is important to emphasize that this is a complex system, and that a single analytical technique is insufficient to elucidate all stages of the polymerization mechanism. But it is believed that the results are promising and help better understanding the system. Buchwalter [27] reported that when furfuryl acetate was subjected to cationic polymerization instead of furfuryl alcohol, side reactions such as etherification, formaldehyde elimination and ring opening reactions were not observed, which contributes significantly to the formation of the desired polymer. Thus, the cationic polymerization of FE was performed for comparison purposes under the conditions described in Table 2. The initial FE sample used was the same for the different TFA concentrations, and its 1H NMR spectrum was acquired prior to the addition of the initiator (Fig. 1). The evolution of the polymerization reactions with the three TFA concentrations as a function of time is given in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. Although additional spectra were acquired for other reaction lengths, they were omitted because they did not show significant differences. As already mentioned, a persistent peak of 4.61 ppm is present in the FE 1H NMR spectrum, from to the -CH2 protons directly linked to the hydroxyl group of residual FA from the transesterification reaction. At 0.6 M and 0.9 M TFA concentrations (Figs. 6 and 7, respectively), a progressive decrease in this signal intensity is observed as the reaction evolves, which is expected, considering the high reactivity of FA in an acidic medium. This result is in accordance with the spectral evolution of polymerization reactions conducted with mixtures of ME and FA (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). There are discrete spectral variations as a function of time for lower TFA concentrations. However, a close analysis of the signal integration values indicates a significant reduction in the number of protons linked to unsaturated carbons. For 0.6 M TFA (Fig. 6) the integration of the region between 5.2 and 6.5 ppm is 8.85 after 2 h of reaction, considering the value of 3.0 for the integration of the signal at 0.89 ppm (-CH3 at the end of the aliphatic methylene sequence of the fatty acid). This value is reduced, respectively, to 5.89 and 4.62 after 34 and 58 h of reaction, indicating that polymerization occurs at the potential active sites of the monomer. In the case of TFA concentration of 0.9 M (Fig. 7) the integration of the region between 5.2 and 6.5 ppm is 7.73 after 2 h of reaction, also considering the value of 3.0 for the integration of the signal at 0.89 ppm. This value is reduced, respectively, to 6.60 and 5.63 after 32 and 58 h of reaction. These results indicate that the increase in acid concentration, in this case, did not significantly favor the advance of the polymerization. For 1.2 M TFA, after 2 h of reaction, the integration of the signals between 5.2 and 6.5 ppm resulted in 5.42. After 36 and 58 h, the corresponding values were 3.16 and 5.63, respectively, and a broadening of the spectrum signals is observed, which is typical of macromolecular chains. In fact, this sample became a gel during the course of the experiments, decreasing the quality of the signals produced by 1H NMR. Scheme 4 shows a possible mechanism for the polymerization of FE. Under the conditions tested, it was not possible to detect the presence of specific peaks (1H NMR) indicating the preferential formation of the structures shown in Scheme 4. It is possible that at lower TFA concentrations (0.6 M and 0.9 M) the reaction may have progressed slowly, and only the progressive decrease of the proton signals of the unsaturations were detected. In contrast, the reaction conducted with 1.2 M TFA evolved abruptly, and the gelation of the material compromised the quality of the spectra. For the TO+FA copolymerization, 1H NMR studies were not possible because of the early gelation of the system, a well-known feature associated with the FO very high functionality [18]."
11,Polymer characterization,"3.3 Polymer characterization The characterization of polymers individually based on TO, ME and FA was conducted and the results (FTIR, TGA and DSC) are presented here for comparison purposes (Figs. 9, 10 and 11) [18]. Polymers P1–P8 were characterized by the same techniques. The results of polymers P1–P3 are discussed separately from those of P4–P8, as they were synthesized based on different strategies. However, it is very important to highlight the formation of gels in both cases, i.e., in polymerization reactions of ME with FA (P2 and P3) and of FE alone (P7 and P8), whose insoluble nature was maintained after Soxhlet extraction. This is a strong indication that the formation of crosslinked polymers was made through chemical linkages between the two types of polymerizing systems, otherwise the tung oil-based homopolymer would have been extracted, since it is soluble as previously demonstrated [18]. Both strategies are therefore based on a copolymerization, leading to TO+FA mixed networks. Comparing Figs. 12a and 9a (TO polymer) and c (FA polymer), one can identify the presence of peaks coming from TO and FA individual polymers, which is indicative of the association of both polymers in the final material. P2 spectrum (Fig. 12b) resembles that of the related polymer constituted only of FA monomer (Fig. 9c), which can be an indication of the preferential formation of the FA polymer in the specific conditions used. When methyl α-eleostearate was kept alone for a longer period (2 days instead for 2 h) to favor the formation of ME oligomers prior to the addition of FA, its incorporation in the polymer network was more relevant (Fig. 12c), but the presence of peaks from the homopolymer of FA are still more representative than those of the fatty acid methyl ester. The analysis of the DSC traces did not clearly indicate an intermediate behavior for the copolymers, as expected. The thermal transitions of FA-based resins are broad and highly depend on the conditions of analysis, such as heating and cooling rates. The precise determination of polymers Tg is in progress and corresponds to a very important feature of the materials considered in the present study (Fig. 13 ). The main characteristic in the TGA thermograms, first considering the polymers individually prepared from TO, ME and FA, is the amount of the graphitic residue at about 700 °C, that is approximately 0.5% for the TO polymer, 1.5% for the ME polymer, and higher than 40% in the case of the FA-based material (Fig. 11). Polymer P1 showed intermediate graphitic residues (near 20%), which indicates the formation of a polymeric network comprising both TO and FA monomers. On the other hand, polymers P2 and P3 exhibit graphitic residues near 40%, which is in accordance with the FTIR and DSC results (Fig. 14 ). Polymers P4–P8 were prepared from FE, with varying TFA concentrations (Table 3), and are characterized by their FTIR (Fig. 15 ), DSC (Fig. 16 ) and TGA (Fig. 17 ) features. The FTIR spectra of P4 and P5 are very similar to that obtained from FE (Fig. 1), which indicates that at lower TFA concentrations, the polymerization was too slow and significant changes in the spectra could not be observed. On the other hand, the absence of the band at 3011 cm−1 for the CCH stretch in the spectra of samples P6–P8 indicates the conversion of double bonds and incorporation of the fatty acid in the polymer chain. Also, the band at 1740 cm−1 (Fig. 16b) from the carbonyl ester of FE is progressively shifted to 1710 cm−1, indicating the formation of -COOH groups from transesterification reactions involving free TFA [18]. Exothermic events are present as broad peaks at DSC curves of P4 and P5, synthesized with lower TFA concentrations, and there is no clear glass transition in both cases. Considering the corresponding FTIR spectra and the presence of bands from CC vibration modes, it is possible that in these conditions the conversion of the reaction was low, with no detectable polymer formation, with oligomeric structures predominating. The samples prepared with higher TFA concentrations (P6-P8) exhibited glass transition temperatures around 0 °C, which is similar to those reported for polymers synthesized from TO and ME [18]. Polymers P4–P8 presented thermal behaviors directly related to the concentration of TFA used in these polymerizations. The thermal decomposition profile of P4 and P5 were very similar to that of FE, with graphitic residues below 10%. It is reasonable to infer from this result, together with the corresponding FTIR spectra (Fig. 15) and DSC thermograms (Fig. 16), that under these conditions the polymerization evolved very slowly, possibly leading to oligomeric structures. However, when higher catalyst concentrations were employed (P6, P7 and P8), the materials were more thermally resistant, with graphitic residues of 16.4%, 22.5% and 20.5%, respectively, which is a strong indication of the formation of a polymeric network comprising both fatty acid and furan monomers. These results are promising and correspond to an important advance in the field of polymers derived from renewable raw materials."
12,Conclusions,"In the present work, the association of tung oil and furfuryl alcohol was considered for the preparation of polymer networks using TFA as cationic catalyst. For this purpose, three approaches were essayed, i.e., combining crude tung oil and furfuryl alcohol, methyl α-eleostearate and furfuryl alcohol, or using furfuryl α-eleostearate alone. The polymers were prepared at inert conditions, i.e. without the intervention of atmospheric oxidation of residual unsaturations (siccative processes of the TO-type moieties), and the results indicated the formation of networks made up of both monomer macromolecular joint structures, when high TFA concentrations were used. This study opens the way to the preparation of novel tunable materials based on the use of two very different renewable sources."
