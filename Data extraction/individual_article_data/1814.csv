0,Introduction,"Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which convert the chemical energy stored in hydrogen fuel directly and efficiently to electrical energy with water as the only byproduct, have the potential to reduce our energy use, pollutant emissions, and dependence on fossil fuels [1]. Hydrogen production is essential for the application of PEM fuel cells. The decomposition of hydrocarbons is one of effective methods for hydrogen production [2]. The hydrocarbon formic acid (HCOOH) has been widely used as hydrogen sources under ambient conditions [3]. Hydrogen can be produced from formic acid decomposition via the catalysis of transitional metals. Among these metal catalysts, Pd has been reported to be the most active one for formic acid decomposition [4]. Nevertheless, the hydrogen production rate of formic acid decomposition via Pd catalysts is still low [5]. Pd catalysts alloying with a second metal element is an effective way to increase the activities of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Although gold is an inert metal, the Pd-Au alloy catalysts show superior performance in some catalytic reactions. For example, the synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 combination on Pd-Au catalysts has much higher conversion rate and selectivity than that on pure Pd ones [6,7]. The corresponding simulation results indicate that the existence of surface Au atoms block the O2 dissociation, which increase the reaction selectivity toward H2O2 production [8]. The theoretical study also proves that the less active Au atoms weaken the interaction of the metal surface with H2O2 and thus suppress the dissociation of this super-oxide as H2O and O [9]. In addition, supported Pd-Au catalysts can also be effective for the oxidation of methane to methanol using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant [10,11]. Besides the Pd-Au alloy catalysts, Pd single atom doping Au clusters show improved catalytic performance for aerobic alcohol oxidation [12]. Recently, pure Au and Pd, Pd-Au random mixing and Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters are synthesized for catalyzing formic acid decomposition [13]. The experimental results show that hydrogen can be produced via formic acid decomposition on pure Pd, Pd-Au random mixing and Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters. The volume of produced gas (H2 +CO2) is 100ml after 600minutes via Pd catalysts. On Pd-Au random mixing nanoclusters, the volume of produced gas reaches 230ml after 150minutes. Furthermore, 240ml gas can be released on Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters in only 50minutes. The hydrogen production rate of formic acid decomposition is significantly increased after Pd catalysts alloying with Au. This viewpoint is also proved by other catalytic experimental results concerning formic acid decomposition via Pd-Au alloy catalysts [14–20]. In bulk materials, the alloys of Pd with Au form a continuous series of fcc solid solution structures [21]. For Pd-Au random mixing nanoclusters, a uniform disordered fcc structure is also the most stable phase [22]. Since the surface energy value of Au is smaller than that of Pd [23], surfaces of Pd-Au random alloys are usually Au-enriched [24]. In addition, the atom structure of Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters is studied via in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy [25]. The experimental results show that after the Pd shell has epitaxially grown on the Au core, some Au atoms would diffuse to surfaces, which can reduce the lattice mismatch between Pd and Au. Surface Pd and Au atoms form L1 long range ordered phase, for which the Pd/Au atom ratio is 1/1. This ordered Pd-Au surface structure is stable bellow 800K. It has been proved that the reaction of HCOOH→2H+CO2 is carried out with moderate reaction barriers on Pd surfaces [26]. However, Pd surfaces can easily dissociate hydrogen molecules and intensively bind hydrogen atoms [27]. Due to the strong H adsorption, it may be difficult for two hydrogen atoms on Pd surfaces to combine and form a hydrogen molecule. On the other hand, the hydrogen atom adsorption on Au surfaces is very weak [28]. The H adsorption strength on Pd-Au alloy surfaces is between the corresponding values on pure Au and Pd ones [29]. In our opinions, the increasing hydrogen production rate of formic acid decomposition via Pd-Au alloy catalysts is due to the weakened adsorption of hydrogen atoms on their surfaces. In this contribution, hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition on Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters is simulated via the density functional theory (DFT) method. For comparison, the same reactions on pure Pd clusters are also studied. The scientific question we want to clarify is that whether formic acid decomposition and hydrogen production are both effectively carried out on Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters via the synergetic effect between Pd and Au."
1,Simulation details,"In first-principles DFT [30,31] simulations, the DMol3 module [32,33] was used for geometric optimization and reaction process imitation. We employed generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Wang functional (PW91) [34] to describe exchange and correlation effects. Fo obtaining more accurate adsorption energy values of the reactants, dispersion corrections would be added in the simulations. Via these DFT-D corrections, van der Waals interactions between reactants and metal surfaces are included. The Ortmann-Bechstedt-Schmidt (OBS) method [35] would be used for dispersion corrections. During the geometric optimization process, the energy convergence, maximum force and maximum distance were 1.0×10−5 Ha, 2.0×10−3 Ha Å−1 and 5.0×10−3 Å. In electronic settings, for reducing the computational cost, DFT Semi-core Pseudo-potentials (DSPP) method [36] was used to replace core electrons by a single effective potential and introduce some degree of relativistic correction into the core. The self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance value was 1.0×10−6 Ha and the double numerical plus d-functions (DND) were chosen as the basis set [32]. For transition states (TS) searching, the calculation firstly performed a linear synchronous transit (LST) [37] maximum, which was followed by an energy minimization in directions conjugating to the reaction pathway. TS approximation obtained via LST/optimization was then used to perform a quadratic synchronous transit (QST) maximization to find the most accurate transitional states. The convergence tolerance of root mean square (RMS) force was 2.0×10−3 Ha Å−1 and the maximum number for QST step was set as 10. Concerning with the properties of charge transfer (CT), atom charges would be calculated via the Mulliken population analysis [38]. For finding better adsorption sites of reactants, the first-principle molecular dynamic simulation would be performed. The NVT ensemble was chosen, in which dynamics would be at fixed volume with a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature. The constant temperature was 300K and the total simulation time was 1ps. The time for each dynamic step was 1fs and the numbers of dynamic steps were 1000. In the thermostat setting, massive Nosé-Hoover method [39] would be used to control the temperature of the NVT simulation. The Nose Q ratio, Nose chain length and Yoshida parameter were chosen as 2, 2 and 3, separately. In catalytic experiments for formic acid decomposition, the diameters of Pd, Pd-Au random mixing and Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters are in the range of 1.2–2.4nm [13]. At these dimensional sizes, metal nanoclusters keep quasicrystal icosahedral and decahedral structures [40]. For such small polyhedral structures, surface facets are limited and most surface atoms locate at vertex and edge sites. Considering the consumption time of calculation, a representative icosahedral structure including 55 atoms (the diameter about 1.4nm) is chosen as the catalyst for formic acid decomposition. In Fig. 1 a–c, Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 icosahedrons (the subscripts denote the number of atoms) respectively represent pure Pd, Au@Pd core-shell (with Pd-Au ordered alloy surfaces) and Pd-Au random mixing (with Au-enriched Pd-Au random alloy surfaces) nanoclusters. Since these icosahedral clusters are near spherical in shape, their surfaces are similar to curved (111) facets as shown in Fig. S1. Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters keep the similar atomic packing to that of bulk PdAu ordered and Pd-Au random alloy surfaces (Figs. S1(c–f)). In Fig. 1b, it is found that Pd2Au and PdAu2 are the two types of hollow sites on the Pd27Au28 cluster. While on the Pd22Au33 cluster, PdAu2 and Au3 are the two types of hollow sites (Fig. 1c). For such small clusters with 55 atoms, vertex and edge sites are the only two types of surface species. Since Pd atoms have higher surface energy value, it should not locate on the low-coordinated vertex sites of Pd-Au binary nanoclusters. Therefore, there are three types of surface sites (Pd, Au vertex and Au edge) on Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters as shown in Fig. 1b and c. The adsorption energy value of reactants (or products) E ad is calculated based on the following equation, (1) E ad = E cluster-re −(E cluster + E re) where E cluster and E re separately denote the total energy of the cluster and reactants (or products), E cluster-re denotes the total energy after reactants are adsorbed on the cluster. In the calculation of TS search, the reaction barrier value E rb is defined as, (2) E rb = E TS − E IS/MS where E TS denotes the total energy of reaction system at TS, E IS/MS denotes the total energy of reaction system at the initial state (IS) or meta-stable intermediate state (MS) (depending on the reaction step). For evaluating the reaction probability of each decomposition and combination process, the rate constant k is calculated based on the Arrhenius equation, (3) k = A exp ( − E rb R T ) where R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature (T =298K in the experiments of Ref. 13). A is the pre-exponential factor. The specific value of A is about 1.0×108 s−1 for formic acid decomposition on Pd-based catalysts [41]."
2,Results and Discussion,"Firstly, adsorption sites of reactants and products would be determined. All the possible adsorption sites of HCOOH, H and H2 on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are shown in Figs. 2 and 4 and the corresponding E ad values are given in Table 1 . Usually, a formic acid molecule is vertically adsorbed at metal surfaces via the oxygen (O of CO) on-top adsorption mode [26,42,43]. In Fig. 2a and b, it is found that HCOOH can be adsorbed on both the vertex and edge sites of Pd55, for which E ad values are separately −0.80 and −0.73eV. Surface hollow sites can be subdivided as fcc and hcp ones. For a hydrogen atom, the most stable adsorption site at Pd55 surfaces is the fcc hollow (Fig. 2c), on which E ad =−3.13eV is determined. On the hcp hollow site (Fig. 2d), E ad value of H adsorption also reaches −3.10eV. In addition, a hydrogen atom can be adsorbed on bridges connecting vertex-edge or edge-edge (Fig. 2e and f), for which E ad values are separately −3.01 and −3.00eV. A hydrogen molecule is adsorbed at metal surfaces via the on-top adsorption mode. In Fig. 2g and h, it is found that H2 can bind with the vertex and edge sites of Pd55 and the corresponding E ad values are −0.48 and −0.51eV. In Fig. 3 a, it is found that HCOOH can be moderately adsorbed on the Pd site of Pd27Au28 with E ad =−0.70eV. While on Au vertex and edge sites (Fig. 3b and c), adsorption for a formic acid molecule is weak since the corresponding E ad values are −0.50 and −0.28eV. For hydrogen atom adsorption, E ad values increase with more Pd atoms participation. In Fig. 3d and e, it is found that hydrogen atoms can be adsorbed on Pd2Au fcc and hcp hollow sites, for which E ad values reach −2.94 and −2.91eV. On PdAu2 hcp hollow and PdAu bridge sites (Fig. 3f and g), E ad values of H adsorption decrease to −2.63 and −2.74eV. A hydrogen atom can also be adsorbed on the AuAu bridge site (Fig. 3h) and the corresponding E ad value is only −2.50eV. In Fig. 3i, it is found that H2 moderately bind with the Pd site of Pd27Au28 with E ad =−0.50eV. H2 can only be physically adsorbed on the Au vertex site (Fig. 3j) since the corresponding E ad value is −0.14eV. At surfaces of the Pd22Au33 cluster, the most stable adsorption site for a formic acid molecule is the Pd top as shown in Fig. 4 a. The corresponding E ad value reaches −0.66eV. HCOOH can be also adsorbed on Au vertex and edge sites (Fig. 4b and c), for which E ad =−0.53 and −0.32eV are determined. Due to the lack of Pd3 and Pd2Au hollow sites, the hydrogen atom adsorption on Pd22Au33 is not intensive. In Fig. 4d and e, it is found that a hydrogen atom can be adsorbed on PdAu2 fcc and hcp hollow sites with E ad =−2.64 and −2.61eV. On PdAu bridge sites differentiating Au edge and vertex (Fig. 4f and g), E ad values of H adsorption are −2.62 and −2.65eV. Pure Au sites AuAu bridge (connecting vertex and edge) and Au3 fcc hollow (Fig. 4h and i) give weak adsorption for hydrogen atoms since the corresponding E ad values are −2.42 and −2.30eV. As for hydrogen molecule adsorption, H2 can bind with both Pd and Au vertex sites [Fig. 4j and k], for which E ad =−0.46 and −0.16eV are determined. The selection of HCOOH adsorption on the top of metal atoms refers to previous theoretical work [26,42,43]. We wonder whether there are other better adsorption sites and modes for a formic acid molecule. Based on this consideration, HCOOH is firstly placed on the bridge and hollow sites of pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy clusters (O of CO contacting with surfaces). It would move back to the adjacent top sites after geometric optimization. In addition, HCOOH is placed on pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy clusters via the H of C−H and O of O−H contacting with surfaces. By these adsorption modes, HCOOH is only physical adsorbed on the clusters and the corresponding E ad values are about −0.20eV. Nevertheless, whether our selected adsorption site and mode for a formic acid molecule is the optimal one is still uncertain. To completely solve this problem, the molecular dynamic simulation is performed for HCOOH adsorption on the Pd sites (O of CO contacting with surfaces) of Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters. After this simulation annealing (1000 dynamic steps and total simulation time 1ps), it is found that the formic acid molecule still vertically stands on the top of Pd atom with only a small amplitude molecule distortion. After a second time geometric optimization, this molecule distortion would disappear and the formic acid molecule is in the most stable adsorption state again. Therefore, the optimal HCOOH adsorption site and mode selected in our simulations is credible. In the following, the formic acid decomposition process on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters would be studied. On pure Pd bulk surfaces, possible reaction paths for HCOOH→2H+CO2 have been calculated via DFT simulations [26,42,44,45] and the corresponding path diagram is shown in Fig. S2. There are two possible reaction paths for the formic acid decomposition process. In the first reaction path, the hydrogen atom connecting with the oxygen one is firstly dissociated and the intermediate product is formate (HCOO). While in the second reaction path, the hydrogen atom connecting with the carbon one is firstly dissociated and the intermediate product is carboxyl (COOH). It has been proved that the first reaction path is rate limiting due to strong adsorption of HCOO on Pd surfaces [26,44,45]. Therefore, formic acid decomposition on Pd bulk surfaces is carried out along the second reaction path, for which COOH is the intermediate product. The formic acid decomposition process along the first reaction path (intermediate product HCOO) on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are separately shown in Figs. S3–S5. In Fig. S3, it is found that the reactions on the Pd55 cluster are blocked when formate changes its adsorption mode. After the first hydrogen atom has been dissociated, the intermediate product HCOO binds with the Pd55 cluster via O-Pd bonds, which can be described as HCO*O* (* denotes the adsorption atoms). For the second hydrogen atom dissociation, HCOO must be adsorbed on the Pd55 cluster via both H and O binding with Pd surface atoms, which is expressed as H*COO*. When HCO*O* transforms to H*COO* (Fig. S3d, f), k =4.1×10−10 s−1 is determined, which means that this molecule rotation process can not occur. The situation is similar for formic acid decomposition on the Pd27Au28 cluster as shown in Fig. S4. The k value is only 9.2×10−9 s−1 when HCO*O* transforms to H*COO* (Fig. S4c–e). For formic acid decomposition on the Pd22Au33 cluster, the reactions are blocked at the initial stage. In Fig. S5 a–c, it is found that k =7.7×10−15 s−1 for the first hydrogen atom dissociation. Based on the above consideration, it is concluded that formic acid decomposition can not be carried out along the first reaction path on both pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters. The reaction process of formic acid decomposition along the second reaction path (intermediate product COOH) on the Pd55 cluster is shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5b, it is found that the formic acid molecule should firstly turn upside-down for the convenience of hydrogen dissociation. In this type of physical adsorption, HCOOH binds with Pd surfaces via an H-Pd bond and the corresponding E ad value is only −0.22eV. The first hydrogen atom dissociation (Fig. 5c) is very easy since the corresponding k value is 1.8×102 s−1. The generated intermediate product would transform from COOHbe to COOHun (Fig. 5d and e), where the subscripts u and d denote that H locates beyond and underneath COO in the adsorbed carboxyl. After this transformation, H in carboxyl is close to Pd surfaces, which provides convenience for hydrogen dissociation. The second hydrogen atom dissociation (Fig. 5f) is not easy since the corresponding k value is 4.6×10−6 s−1. After hydrogen dissociation, the generated carbon dioxide molecule is physical adsorbed on Pd surfaces (Fig. 5g) and its following desorption is very easy. Formic acid decomposition along the second reaction path on Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are separately shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . The hydrogen dissociation procedures of HCOOH on these Pd-Au alloy clusters are as same as that on the Pd55 cluster. On the Pd27Au28 cluster, the formic acid molecule is firstly adsorbed on the top of Pd site (Fig. 6a). After HCOOH turns upside-down, the adsorbed hydrogen atom can be dissociated with moderate k value is 7.9×10−1 s−1 as shown in Fig. 6c. The dissociated hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the Pd2Au fcc hollow site. After the intermediate product carboxyl transforms from COOHbe to COOHun, the other hydrogen atom would be dissociated, for which k =1.5×10−4 s−1 is determined (Fig. 6f). The secondly dissociated hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the neighboring Pd2Au fcc hollow site and the two hydrogen atoms share a Pd surface atom for adsorption. On the Pd22Au33 cluster, formic acid decomposition is also carried out around a Pd surface atom. k values for the first and second hydrogen atom dissociation (Fig. 7c and f) are 7.5×10−3 and 2.1×10−6 s−1. The firstly dissociated hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the PdAu2 fcc hollow site and the secondly dissociated hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the neighboring PdAu bridge site. They also share a Pd surface atom for adsorption. Based on the above simulation results, it is conclude that formic acid decomposition can be carried out on Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters provided that there are Pd atoms on their surfaces. After formic acid decomposition, the combination of two dissociated hydrogen atoms would be considered. The reaction process of two hydrogen atoms combination for a hydrogen molecule production on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are shown in Fig. 8 and the corresponding potential energy change diagrams are given in Fig. 9 . IS of hydrogen atoms combination (Fig. 8a, f and k) derives from FS of formic acid decomposition (Figs. 5 h, 6 g and 7 g). The difference between them is that the CO2 molecule has moved away. On the Pd55 cluster, two hydrogen atoms firstly move close on the neighboring hollow sites for the convenience of combination, as shown in Fig. 8b. This atom movement only brings a little increasement in potential energy (−6.23eV→−6.19eV). k value for hydrogen atoms combination (Fig. 8c) is 3.0×10−7 s−1, which means that the reaction of H+H→H2 is hardly to carry out on this pure Pd cluster. On the Pd27Au28 cluster, one of the hydrogen atom on the Pd2Au fcc hollow firstly move to the neighboring PdAu bridge (Fig. 8g). After this movement, the two hydrogen atoms are on the nearest neighboring sites and the corresponding potential energy only have a little increasement (−5.82eV→−5.68eV). The following hydrogen atoms combination (Fig. 8h) is carried out with moderate k value 7.5×10−3 s−1. The hydrogen molecule production on the Pd27Au28 cluster is a reaction process with high probability. On the Pd22Au33 cluster, the two hydrogen atoms have been on the nearest neighboring sites after formic acid decomposition as shown in Fig. 8k. k value for hydrogen atoms combination (Fig. 8l) is 5.8×102 s−1. Therefore, the hydrogen molecule production on the Pd22Au33 cluster is an easy reaction process. The high hydrogen production rate on Pd-Au nanoclusters is due to the weakened hydrogen atom adsorption on their alloy surfaces. To explain the change in hydrogen atom adsorption after Au alloying with Pd nanoclusters, CT of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms and their conjoint surface Pd and Au atoms on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are shown in Fig. 10 . When adsorption bonds are generated between a hydrogen atom and the underlying metal surfaces, charges are transferred from the adsorbate to substrates and Coulomb forces between them would determine the bond strength [46]. Inter-atomic Coulomb forces are proportional to the absolute value of atom positive and negative charges product. After a hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the fcc hollow site of the Pd55 cluster (Fig. 10a), CT values of H and three Pd atoms are separately 0.24 and −0.11. On the Pd27Au28 cluster, CT value of the H atom still reaches 0.25 for a hydrogen atom adsorption on the Pd2Au fcc hollow site (Fig. 10b). However, CT value of the Au atom (−0.05) is higher than that of two Pd atoms (−0.10). Similarly, after a hydrogen atom is adsorbed on the PdAu2 fcc hollow site of the Pd22Au33 cluster (Fig. 10c), CT value of two Au atoms (−0.07) is higher than that of the Pd atom (−0.10). Considering the inter-atomic positive and negative charges product, Au-H bond is weaker than PdH bond. The weakness of Au-H bond should be attributed to the relativistic effects. As a consequence of relativistic effects, the s electrons of an atom become more bound to the nuclear than if these effects were absent. Gold exhibits a large relativistic effect, which accounts for its high resistance of CT with other elements [47,48]. This electron criterion can explain why hydrogen atom adsorption on Pd2Au and PdAu2 hollow sites are weaker than that on the Pd3 hollow site. As mentioned above, the diameters of Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters are about 1.4nm and there are only vertex and edge sites on their surfaces. For the nanoclusters with larger diameters, some surface atoms would locate at facet sites. On metal surfaces, small molecules usually tend to bind with vertex and edge sites rather than facet ones since the former has smaller coordinated numbers and high surface energy values [49]. Therefore, on pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy clusters with larger dimensional sizes, the formic acid decomposition and hydrogen production may be also carried out on low-coordinated vertex and edge sites. In the catalytic experiments, hydrogen molecules can be slowly produced via formic acid decomposition on pure Pd nanoclusters [13]. While our simulation results show that the hydrogen production are almost impossible on the Pd55 cluster. In our simulations, only one formic acid molecule is decomposed on the Pd55 cluster. The two generated hydrogen atoms are difficult to combine due to their strong on-surface adsorption. During the actual experimental process, a nanocluster can offer adsorption for several to several tens molecules. When more and more formic acid molecules are adsorbed and decomposed on a pure Pd cluster, the hydrogen atom coverage on its surfaces would gradually increase. It has been proved that the hydrogen atom adsorption on Pd surfaces becomes weaker with the increasing H coverage [50]. In our opinions, when the hydrogen atom coverage on pure Pd clusters is beyond a critical value, the hydrogen production becomes a possible process. Certainly, once some hydrogen molecules are generated and the hydrogen atom coverage is below the critical value, the hydrogen production would be difficult again. During the formic acid decomposition experiments, the hydrogen production rate on Au@Pd core-shell nanoclusters is higher than the corresponding value on Pd-Au random mixing clusters [13]. While our simulation results show that hydrogen atoms combination on the Pd22Au33 (representing Pd-Au random mixing) cluster is easier than that on the Pd27Au28 (representing Au@Pd core-shell) cluster. At the ordered PdAu alloy surface of Au@Pd core-shell clusters, Pd sites occupy half of the total surface atoms. While at the Au-rich surface of Pd-Au random mixing clusters, the occupation of Pd sites can not be larger than one fourth. On Pd-Au alloy clusters, formic acid molecules can be only adsorbed and decomposed on Pd sites. When Au@Pd core-shell and Pd-Au random mixing clusters have similar dimensional sizes, the former ones can offer more Pd sites for formic acid decomposition, which induces their relatively high hydrogen production rate. Based on the above simulation results and analysis, the reaction mechanism of formic acid decomposition on pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters could be clarified. On pure Pd clusters, formic acid can be adsorbed and decomposed on any surface sites. However, the further hydrogen production is almost impossible due to the strong adsorption of dissociated hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen molecules could only be generated when Pd surfaces are highly covered with hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the hydrogen production on pure Pd clusters would be a time-consuming process. On Pd-Au random mixing clusters, Pd surface atoms can ensure the formic acid decomposition and hydrogen production. Nevertheless, the mono-dispersed Pd active sites are relatively insufficient for the formic acid adsorption, which decelerates the hydrogen production rate more or less. On Au@Pd core-shell clusters, Pd and Au sites are neighbors to each others and both of them occupy half of the total surface atoms. At this ordered alloy surface, there are enough Pd active sites for the formic acid adsorption and the dissociated hydrogen atoms do not strongly bind with the clusters. Via the synergistic effect between Pd and Au surface sites, both the formic acid decomposition and hydrogen production become reaction processes with large probability and the corresponding hydrogen production rate would reach the optimal value."
3,Conclusions,"On Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters, HCOOH and H2 are adsorbed on their surface Pd sites. The hydrogen atom adsorption becomes weaker with more Au atoms on surfaces of Pd-Au alloy clusters. Formic acid molecules can not be decomposed via the generation of intermediate product formate on both pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy clusters. Accompanied by the generation of intermediate product carboxyl, two hydrogen atoms can be dissociated from the formic acid molecule on Pd55, Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters, for which k values are in the range of 2.1×10−6 ∼1.8×102 s−1. On the Pd55 cluster, the two dissociated hydrogen atoms intensively bind with Pd surfaces and the k value for their combination is 3.0×10−7 s−1. On the Pd27Au28 and Pd22Au33 clusters, k values for hydrogen production increase to 7.5×10−3 and 5.8×102 s−1 due to the weakened hydrogen atom adsorption. Considering the electronic bonding of hydrogen atom adsorption, Coulomb forces of Au-H bonds are smaller than those of Pd-H bonds, which induce relatively weak hydrogen atom adsorption on Pd2Au and PdAu2 hollow sites."
