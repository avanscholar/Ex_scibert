0,Introduction,"The global fuel and chemical production predominantly originate from petroleum crude oil. With the depleting reserves and rising prices of crude oil, producing fuels from renewable feedstock is imperative. Syngas, a variable composition mixture of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), has been cited as an essential precursor to a wide range of high value-added fuels and chemicals via well-established industrial processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) [1–3]. The conventional production of syngas is based on partial oxidation with steam and oxygen from non-renewable fossil fuels (e.g. coal, petroleum, and natural gas), which could increase the consumption of fossil fuels and aggravate the energy crisis [4–6]. Syngas production from renewable biomass is an alternative, sustainable and carbon–neutral approach to combat the energy crisis [7]. To date, syngas production based on the thermochemical conversion of biomass has become increasingly interesting [8,9]. Syngas with a tunable H2/CO ratio is critical as a feedstock for the synthesis of chemical products using different FTS operation modes. For example, a H2/CO ratio of 1 is desired for hydroformylation process [10,11], whereas a H2/CO ratio of 2 is optimal for the synthesis of methanol, paraffins, olefins and oxygenates via FTS process [12]. For the cobalt catalysts, the H2/CO usage ratio ranges between 2.06 and 2.16, while the iron-based catalysts would facilitate the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction and thereby reduce the H2/CO usage ratio ranging from 0.5 to 2 [13]. Syngas with tunable H2/CO ratio could readily fulfil the requirement of H2/CO usage ratio for the downstream synthesis process, avoiding extra steps to adjust the H2/CO ratio and thereby maximizing conversion efficiency of syngas into liquid fuels and value-added chemicals. Thus, it is critical to precisely control the H2/CO ratio in the syngas, making it a versatile and flexible platform feedstock for industrial applications [14]. It is still challenging for conventional thermochemical conversion of biomass to produce syngas with tunable H2/CO ratio. The conventional biomass-derived syngas always consists of a high purity of H2 production while a poor CO production. Different types of processes have been studied to pursue high yield and high purity of H2, such as steam gasification [15,16], hydrothermal gasification [17], sorption-enhanced steam gasification [18,19] and catalytic gasification [20,21]. A high H2 purity of 97 mol% was produced from the sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming of waste cooking oil in a packed-bed reactor reported by Pimenidou et al. [22]. The H2 purity could reach up to 70–80% from the sorption-enhanced steam gasification [19,23], hydrothermal gasification [24] and pyrolysis with on-line steam reforming [25] of biomass. However, high-purity H2 is often accompanied by a relatively low purity of CO from the thermochemical conversion of biomass. For example, a CO purity of 26% and 11.4% were obtained from the steam gasification of wood [18] and supercritical water gasification of sewage sludge [24], respectively. Hence, additional steps are usually needed to adjust the H2/CO ratio in the syngas to meet the requirements, which makes the overall process more complex and expensive [26]. We recently developed a novel two-stage sorption-enhanced pyrolysis (SEP) process [27], achieving an separate production of unprecedentedly high purity of H2 and CO at different stages from sewage sludge (SS), which is a promising approach for SS treatment. These findings showed that the two-stage SEP of SS could produce a CO-rich syngas mixture with a CO/H2 ratio of 2.3. Considering steam is the most efficient partial-oxidation atmosphere for H2 production [28], the present work investigates the incorporation of steam gasification into the first stage to further adjust the H2 and CO production through the two-stage sorption-enhanced steam gasification (SESG) process, and then to broaden the H2/CO ratio in the syngas produced from SS. This work presents a new process to control and tune the H2/CO ratio in the biomass-derived syngas, which is of significant interest to the downstream synthesis of chemicals and fuels from an industrial perspective. Besides, there is no report on the performance characterization of the novel two-stage sorption-enhanced thermochemical conversion (SETC, including SEP and SESG) process. A clear understanding of the underlying mechanism of the novel two-stage SETC process would be greatly beneficial to the subsequent optimization for further improving the yield and purity of H2 and CO production from biomass. Therefore, studies on the performance characterization in terms of specific product distributions, tar compositions, and elemental utilization in the two-stage SETC process are also conducted in this study."
1,Material and methods,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation The SS used in this study was obtained prior to anaerobic digestion from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Sydney, Australia. The ultimate and proximate analysis of the SS and the preparation method of SS and CaO (SS-CaO) pellets were reported in our previous paper [27]. The prepared SS-CaO pellets were notated as Ca/SS-1:9, Ca/SS-1:4, Ca/SS-3:7, Ca/SS-2:3, and Ca/SS-1:1, in which x:y indicates the mass ratio of CaO to SS (CaO/SS, dry basis)."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures The two-stage SESG of SS was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure, and the diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . The SS-CaO pellets were loaded on the quartz wool supported in a stainless-steel tube (length: 300 mm; inner diameter: 6 mm), and heated by an electric furnace. A nitrogen flow of 15 mL/min was used as the carrier gas during the experiment, and a constant flow pump and a preheater were employed to introduce steam into the reactor. The detailed procedures are as follows: 1) heating the loaded SS-CaO pellets from room temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min and keeping at 550 °C for 45 min, as the first-stage process; 2) subsequently, heating the remained sample from 550 °C to 750 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min and keeping at 750 °C for another 45 min, as the second-stage process. Steam was introduced into the reactor for the first 30 min at the first stage. The corresponding steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C) was 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2, respectively. No steam was introduced into the reactor for the two-stage SEP of Ca/SS-3:7. During the experiment, the condensable gas (tar and steam) and incondensable gas released from the fixed-bed reactor were collected in a condensation tube, which was put into a dewar flask containing a mixture of dry ice and ethylene glycol. The incondensable gas was monitored on-line using a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph (GC, 7890B, Agilent) equipped with two columns and two thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs). The H2, N2, CH4, CO, and CO2 were initially separated on the first-dimensional column (PoraPLOT Q), and the first column effluent of H2, N2, CH4, CO was then injected into the second-dimensional column (HP-Molesieve) for further separation. The data acquisition interval for GC was every 2 min."
4,Characterization of the fresh and residual SS-CaO samples,"2.3 Characterization of the fresh and residual SS-CaO samples The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the organic compounds in the condensable tar were conducted by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) (Agilent) with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm). Prior to the tar analysis, the steam condensed with the tar was dehydrated using anhydrous sodium sulfate. The electron ionization mode was used at an electron energy of 70 eV. The contents of carbon and hydrogen in the fresh Ca/SS-3:7 and its residual chars were determined using Vario MICRO cube elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensyteme GmbH, Germany). The quantity of CaCO3 in the residual char of Ca/SS-3:7 was determined based on the reference intensity ratio (RIR) method [29] using an X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert PRO, PANalytical) with the Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10–80°. A known weight fraction of corundum (Al2O3) as an internal standard was used. The content of CaCO3 in the residual char of Ca/SS-3:7 was calculated by Eq. S1 (Supporting Information)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Tunable H2/CO ratios in the syngas from the two-stage SESG of SS,"3.1 Tunable H2/CO ratios in the syngas from the two-stage SESG of SS The syngas production generated from the two-stage SESG of SS with various mass ratios of CaO to SS at S/C-1 is shown in Fig. 2 . At the first stage (550 °C), CO2 is the predominant component in the effluent gas stream obtained from the bare SS (Fig. S1a, Supporting Information). Upon the addition of CaO, an increase in H2 production is observed at the first stage (Fig. 2a), which is attributed to the catalytic effect of CaO on the tar-steam reforming and cracking for H2 production. Besides, the addition of CaO could in-situ capture CO2 to promote the steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction reaction (Eq. (1)) thus achieving a higher H2 production. However, the yield of H2 at the first stage does not keep increasing with the CaO/SS ratios when the CaO/SS ratio is over 3:7. It was reported that the excess of CaO and addition of steam would absorb large amounts of heat and hinder heat transfer to reduce the activity of steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction leading to the decrease of H2 production at the first stage [30]. The purity of H2 increases with the CaO/SS ratios and H2 becomes the predominant component of the effluent gas stream when the CaO/SS ratio is over 1:4. As shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information), the CO2 production decreases with the increasing CaO contents, and the flow rate of CO2 is almost negligible at the first stage when the CaO/SS ratio is over 3:7, leading to the highest H2 purity of 81.6 vol% from the Ca/SS-1:1 at the first stage (Fig. 2a). (1) CO(g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ⇋ C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) , Δ H 298 K = - 41.1 kJ / mol At the second stage, H2 dominates the effluent gas stream generated from the bare SS (Fig. S1a, Supporting Information). Upon the addition of CaO, the yield and purity of CO gradually increase with the CaO contents reaching maximum over the Ca/SS-3:7 (Fig. 2b). Since no steam was introduced at the second stage resulting in negligible steam gasification of char, the increasing CO is mainly due to the increased amount of CO2 captured with the CaO contents at the first stage and releasing at the second stage to gasify the char for CO production via the reverse Boudouard reaction (Eq. (2)). Similar to the H2 production, the yield and purity of CO decrease when the CaO/SS ratio is over 3:7, which might be caused by the negative effect of excess CaO on the heat transfer in the reactor, thereby reducing the activity of the reverse Boudouard reaction [30]. Besides, a high CO2 concentration is released at the second stage, resulting in a lower CO purity of 41.9 vol% from Ca/SS-1:1 at the second stage (Fig. 2b). (2) C + C O 2 ( g ) ⇋ 2 CO ( g ) , Δ H 298 K = + 172.4 kJ / mol In summary, the addition of CaO could increase the selectivity of H2 at the first stage and CO at the second stage. The syngas production peaks at 323.8 NmL/gdry sludge produced from the two-stage SESG of Ca/SS-3:7, with 72.2 vol% of H2 at the first stage and 60.5 vol% of CO at the second stage (Fig. 2), indicating that there is a threshold limit value for CaO contents. Compared to the H2 production from the two-stage SEP reported previously [27], the H2 production from the two-stage SESG in the present work is greatly enhanced (Fig. 2a). More specifically, the H2 yield of Ca/SS-3:7 reaches 125.7 NmL/gdry sludge at S/C-1, which is around 3 times higher than that of 42.5 NmL/gdry sludge from the two-stage SEP [27]. It is apparent that at the first stage the peak flow rate of H2 increases dramatically and remains for about 50 min at the first stage of the two-stage SESG (Fig. S1d, Supporting Information), while in the two-stage SEP the H2 flow rate peaks in 16 min, and then rapidly drops to a very low level (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). The enhancement in H2 purity from 49.2 to 72.2 vol% is also observed at the first stage with the addition of steam. The presence of steam could promote the steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction for enhanced H2 production. Hence, not only a higher yield of H2 but also a higher purity of H2 could be obtained upon the addition of steam at the first stage. For the CO production at the second stage, there is only a slight difference in the yield of CO from the two-stage SESG and SEP, while the addition of steam reduces the purity of CO due to a higher percentage of CO2 released at the second stage. It is also recommended that the optimal CaO/SS ratio is reduced from 1:1, reported for two-stage SEP [27], to 3:7 for the two-stage SESG presented in this work. In order to further study the influence of steam on the syngas production from the two-stage SESG of SS, the H2 and CO production from the two-stage SESG of Ca/SS-3:7 is plotted as a function of the S/C ratios, as shown in Fig. 3 . The increase of the S/C ratios leads to a higher H2 yield at the first stage due to the enhanced steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction for H2 production (Fig. 3a). However, there is also a threshold limit value for the S/C ratio of 1 beyond which the increase of S/C ratio would not further improve the H2 production at the first stage. This trend has also been reported in other papers [31,32]. It is well accepted that the excess of steam would have a detrimental effect on the temperature inside the reactor to reduce the activity of steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction. In addition, according to Table S1 (Supporting Information), the mass fraction of CaCO3 decreases in the solid residues obtained after the first stage when the S/C ratio is over 1, indicating that less CO2 is captured by the CaO, thereby weakening the beneficial effect of CaO on the steam-reforming reactions and WGS reaction for H2 production. At the second stage, a decreasing yield and purity of CO are obtained with the increased S/C ratios (Fig. 3b). The results of Table S1 indicate that less CO2 is captured at S/C-1.5 and S/C-1, thereby less CO2 is released at the second stage for CO production. The syngas production over Ca/SS-3:7 is further compared with that reported in other studies as summarized in Table 1 . Noteworthy, the H2 purity (72.2 vol%) obtained at the first stage is higher than or comparable with that reported in the literature. The CO purity of 60.5 vol% obtained at the second stage in this study is significantly higher than the range of 2–25 vol% reported by the other studies for SESG of biomass. Hence, the two-stage SESG process could achieve high purity H2 and CO as the dominant gas composition at the first stage and the second stage, respectively. The inherent separation of H2 and CO generation allows direct integration of the thermochemical conversion of biomass with the syngas applications where H2 and CO could be mixed in desirable ratios, ready for use in the downstream synthesis of chemicals or fuels with no need for additional process for refining the H2/CO ratio in the syngas. As shown in Fig. 2c, the H2/CO molar ratios could be systematically tuned from 1.1 to 4.7 by varying the CaO/SS ratios. An H2-rich syngas is obtained from the two-stage SESG of SS-CaO sample when the CaO/SS ratio is below 3:7, thereinto, the H2/CO ratio decreases with the CaO/SS ratios. When the CaO/SS ratios are above 3:7, the H2/CO ratios are stable at around 1, which is the desirable ratio for the FTS process using iron-based catalysts and the production of aldehydes via hydroformylation of alkenes [10,11]. In Fig. 3c, the H2/CO ratios of 0.9–1.2 are obtained by changing the S/C ratios. It is noted that a more pronounced effect of the addition of CaO on the tunable H2/CO ratios is observed, reflected in a wider range of H2/CO ratios, thereby H2/CO ratios are more sensitive to the CaO contents compared to the steam contents. Consequently, the H2/CO ratios could be effectively controlled in the range of 0.9–4.7 by varying either CaO content or steam content, which can fulfil the requirements for different downstream synthetic products and FTS optional modes."
7,Performance characterization of the two-stage SETC process,"3.2 Performance characterization of the two-stage SETC process 3.2.1 Product distributions To clearly understand the specific transformation of SS via the two-stage SETC process, the distributions of char, tar, and gas produced from Ca/SS-3:7 are shown in Fig. 4 . The distributions of char and tar are expressed in mass fractions of char and tar in the sum of SS and steam, respectively, while the percentage of gas was calculated by the difference between total and the fractions of char and tar. For each case, the mass of char and tar were gained as the weight differences of solid CaO-SS sample and condenser before and after the two-stage SETC of Ca/SS-3:7, respectively. Regarding the yield of char, the mass of CaO was excluded as CaO has no potential to be converted into tar or gas. Since the water could take part in the reactions for syngas production and it was condensed together with the liquid tar, the mass of water was included in the yield of tar. After the first stage, the percentages of tar and char generated from the sole pyrolysis of Ca/SS-3:7 are at a similar level of around 45%. From the steam gasification of Ca/SS-3:7, an enhancement in the proportion of tar from 46.1 to 76.3% is observed with the increased S/C ratios. Correspondingly, the proportion of gas reduces from 11.7 to 2.0% with the increased S/C ratios. However, as discussed in Fig. 3c, the yield of gas exhibits an opposite tendency to some extent. Moreover, the percentage of char declines from 42.2 to 21.3% with the increased S/C ratios, while no significant change in the mass of char is observed (Table S2, Supporting Information). Thereby, the reduction in the proportions of char and gas could be ascribed to the increased reactants consisting of Ca/SS-3:7 and steam with the increased S/C ratios as the denominator in the calculation of the percentage of char and gas. After the second stage, no significant variation in the tar percentage is observed compared to that after the first stage, revealing that no devolatilization of organic matters of SS for tar production and no tar reforming and cracking reactions occur, and only gas–solid reactions happen at the second stage. Taking the product distributions from Ca/SS-3:7 at S/C-1 as an example, compared to the first stage, the percentage of char diminishes by 17.3% while the percentage of gas enhances by 18.1% after the second stage. This might be attributed to the release of CO2 via the decomposition of the CaCO3 formed at the first stage and the char gasification by the release of CO2 for CO production (Eq. (2)) at the second stage. 3.2.2 Tar composition Considered as an undesirable by-product, tar is expected to further undergo cracking and reforming reactions for syngas production. Therefore, it is important to identify the composition of tar for the subsequent promotion of tar decomposition for syngas production. The tar composition obtained from the two-stage SETC of Ca/SS-3:7 is complex including a wide variety of organic compounds. In this study, each GC/MS measurement was carried out under identical conditions for comparison. The constituents identified in the tars can be divided into the following five groups: (I) aliphatic hydrocarbons with the number of carbon ranging from C6 to C35; (II) mono-aromatic compounds including toluene, styrene, phenol, benzene and their corresponding alkyl derivatives; (III) two-ring aromatics which include naphthalene, benzofuranone and their corresponding alkyl derivatives; (IV) oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols (ROH), ketones (ROR'), carboxylic acids (RCOOH), esters (RCOOR'), where R and R' represent long aliphatic chains and cyclanes with the number of carbon ranging between C5 and C39; (V) nitrogen-containing compounds, which include indol, pyridine, amide, and their alkyl derivative. Fig. 5 shows the variations of tar composition as a function of the S/C ratios, expressed as the peak area fractions of each group. It can be seen that the steam contents exert only a negligible influence on the tar composition. The tar composition is dominated by oxygen-containing hydrocarbons in the range of 43.4–47.9 %, aligning well with the previous studies [44,45]. Conventional petroleum fuels have lower oxygen contents and consequently higher energy values. Therefore, extensive researches in the upgrading of bio-oil by hydrodeoxygenation have been carried out to promote the wide application of bio-oil [46,47]. The percentages of aliphatic hydrocarbons and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons are at a similar level of 18.8–19.6% and 15.2–19.2%, respectively, followed by nitrogen-containing hydrocarbons and two-ring aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered as carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals, which is an important constituent of tar reported by other papers [48,49]. In this study, no PAHs is identified in the tars. It was reported that the PAHs could be formed when the temperature is above 700 ˚C [50], while the tar in this study is produced at 550 ˚C, leading to the negligible amounts of PAHs and avoid increasing the toxicity of tar. 3.2.3 Elemental utilization efficiency The CO and H2 in the syngas are mainly derived from the carbon and hydrogen containing compounds in the SS. To understand the transformation of elements during the two-stage SETC process, the elemental utilization efficiency was explored by comparing the carbon and hydrogen distributions in the char, tar and gas between the pyrolysis and steam gasification of Ca/SS-3:7 (Fig. 6 ). The carbon in the char (char-C) and gas (gas-C) are expressed as percentage of the fresh Ca/SS-3:7, while the hydrogen in the char (char-H) and gas (gas-H) are expressed as proportion in the total hydrogen fed into the system, including the hydrogen contents of fresh Ca/SS-3:7 and the introduced steam. The gas-C and gas-H were calculated by Eqs. S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), respectively. The carbon and hydrogen in the tar (tar-C and tar-H) were obtained by the difference of those in the char and gas. As for the carbon distribution from the pyrolysis of SS at the first stage, the carbon in the tar, char, and gas is around 61.4%, 36.6%, and 2.0%, respectively. When the temperature increases to 750 °C at the second stage, the increase of tar-C is negligible, as discussed above. However, 57.4% of char-C emitted from the first stage into the second stage is converted into gas-C, and 42.1% of char-C remains in the char. Compared to the carbon distribution from the pyrolysis of SS, a slight reduction of carbon distribution in the char is ascribed to the char-steam gasification reactions leading to a slight increase in the percentage of gas-C to 6.2% from the steam gasification of SS at S/C-1 at the first stage. At the second stage, the conversion efficiency of char-C emitted from the first stage into the second stage to the gas-C increases to 74.8%, and the residual char-C reduces to 22.0%. For the hydrogen distribution at the first stage, most of the hydrogen of up to 83.4% and 86.1% distributed in the tar was generated from the pyrolysis and steam gasification of SS, respectively. The percentage of char-H decreases from 10.6% obtained from the pyrolysis to 4.5% obtained from the steam gasification, while the proportion of gas-H increases from 6.0% obtained from the pyrolysis to 9.4% obtained from the steam gasification. Regarding the hydrogen distribution at the second stage, the fraction of gas-H to the char-H emitted from the first stage into the second stage increases from 30.2% generated from the pyrolysis to 60.0% generated from the steam gasification, and the fraction of the remaining char-H reduce from 64.2% generated from the pyrolysis to 28.9% generated from the steam gasification. In summary, the addition of steam has little influence on the distribution of carbon and hydrogen in the tar, while it could promote the conversion of carbon and hydrogen from solid-phase (char) to gas-phase, with 7.1% of char-C and 1.3% of char-H generated from the steam gasification. Considering the syngas is the target product of steam gasification, the promotional conversion efficiencies of carbon and hydrogen in the char to the gas could improve the utilization efficiency of carbon and hydrogen. The conversion efficiency of carbon and hydrogen in the tar to the gas can still be further improved, since up to 62.6% of carbon and 86.6% of hydrogen remain in the tar which would be discharged from the reactor at the first stage and not take part in the reactions at the second stage. This is mainly ascribed to the relatively low temperature (550 °C) at the first stage, which favors the devolatilization of SS for tar production [51]. The high levels of tar-C and tar-H from the mixture of SS and CaO at 600 °C were also observed by Liu et al. [52]. It is imperative to promote the transformation of tar to gas at the first stage in order to further increase the syngas production. Previous studies have examined several methods for the elimination of tar, among which, thermal and catalytic cracking and reforming of tar for syngas production are generally preferred [53]. For the two-stage SETC process, the development of cost-effective catalysts is of great importance to further eliminate tar production and promote syngas production. In addition, it is worth further employing the optimal temperature at the first stage which would achieve the best compromise between tar elimination and CaO carbonization."
8,Conclusions,"In order to achieve a tunable H2/CO ratio in the syngas produced from the two-stage SESG process of SS, steam was introduced into the first stage of the two-stage process, resulting in significantly enhanced H2 production at the first stage with 3 times as high as the H2 production from the steam gasification compared to that from the pyrolysis of Ca/SS-3:7. For the two-stage SESG of SS, the maximum syngas production is generated from Ca/SS-3:7 reaching 323.8 NmL/gdry sludge with 72.2 vol% of H2 at the first stage and 60.5 vol% of CO at the second stage. Moreover, a wide range of H2/CO ratio in the syngas from 0.9 to 4.7 is obtained from the two-stage SESG of SS. The H2-rich and CO-rich gas stream are produced at the first stage and the second stage, respectively, providing a new option for direct integration of the two-stage SESG of SS with the syngas applications where H2 and CO could be mixed in desirable ratios for the downstream synthesis of value-added chemicals and fuels. Based on a detailed analysis of product distributions from the two-stage SETC of SS, the tar is mainly produced at the first stage, while the second stage is dominated by the conversion of char into gas. The steam contents exert only a negligible influence on the tar composition. Considering a majority of carbon and hydrogen remain in the tar, there is plenty of room for further improvement of the conversion efficiency of the tar to the gas. Future work on promoting the decomposition of tar is in progress for optimizing the two-stage SETC process to achieve high-quality syngas production from SS."
