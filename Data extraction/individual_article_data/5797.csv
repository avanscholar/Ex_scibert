0,Introduction,"The problems of global energy crisis and climate change caused by greenhouse gases become more and more serious, the search for the environmentally friendly, renewable and affordable energy source is vital for national development nowadays [1–4,59]. Among the potential alternative energy resources, hydrogen energy with high mass energy density and zero emission of greenhouse gases is considered as an ideal clean energy source to replace the role of petroleum [5–7]. The production of molecular hydrogen by water-splitting reaction is an important method, but there is a lack of continuable catalysts composed of low-cost and abundant elements on earth that can efficiently catalyze in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [8]. The noble metal platinum (Pt) exhibits high activities and stabilities as HER catalysis and can observably enhance the reaction rate with the initial potential of almost close to zero for high efficiency energy conversion [9–11]. However, its high cost and scarcity have hindered the industrialization process of hydrogen production by water electrolysis technology [3,12–16]. Therefore, comparably efficient, noble-metal-free and durable HER electrocatalysts are being actively pursued [17,18,60]. All along, the preparation of catalysts for efficient HER has been a hot research topic. Over the past years, earth-abundant, low-cost transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been studied as HER catalysts, such as nickel oxides [19,20], iron oxides [21] and cobalt oxides [22,23]. Cobalt oxides have been proven to be a candidate for efficient hydrogen production, not only because of its relatively low price, but also its superior catalytic activities for electrocatalysis [24–26]. For example, Chen et al. demonstrated excellent activity Co/Co3O4 nanosheets for HER with the unique metal/oxide core/shell structure [27]. M. Tour et al. reported porous cobalt-based thin film for efficient hydrogen generation and oxygen generation [28]. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity and stability of these alternative catalysts are still not on par with conventional noble metal catalysts. The catalytic property of these catalysts is very limited due to low conductivity and small number of active sites [22]. Nowadays, three-dimensional (3D) self-supporting electrodes are becoming more and more popular in electrochemical research. Compared with conventional electrodes coated on two-dimensional (2D) substrate, the properties of 3D self-supporting electrodes are always better than the plane electrodes [29,30]. As we all know, NF has a 3D frame structure which ensures uniform growth of nanomaterials with large surface areas and greater surface roughness, while decreasing the contact resistance and increasing the electrical conductivity [31,32]. Indeed, the superiority of such technology is fully demonstrated by electrocatalyst, such as the MoO2/NF nanosheets [33] and WO3-x/NF nanosheets [34]. On the other hand, the composition of TMOs with other nanomaterials (e.g., metals, conductive materials), because of the synergistic effect of different components, could also provide more active sites and promote fast charge transfer between the external circuit and electrode to enhance the catalytic activity in electrocatalytic HER [35,36]. In addition, as a superior HER catalyst, it not only needs to demonstrate the excellent HER activity, but also long life-time is very important in the alkaline environments found in practical large-scale application [37]. Herein, we for the first time prepared octopus tentacles-like C and WO3 coated CoO by hydrothermal process and immersion method. It is based on the CoO nanowires (NWs) which were vertically grown on 3D NF substrate via a facile hydrothermal process. In order to improve the electrical conductivity of electrode, the conductive polymer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was integrated into the nanowire arrays, and PVA has viscosity that could fix the tungsten oxide onto the surface of the nanowires as a thin layer of nanometer size, while maintaining the ordered nanowire-structure unchanged [38]. The unique octopus tentacles-like structure and strong synergetic coupled effect of the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO NWs provide a large specific surface area, more hydrogen adsorption activity sites and fast electron transfer rate. As a result, Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO NWs are directly used as the electrode for HER in alkaline solution, which proves outstanding properties of onset potential of 40 mV, Tafel slope of 115 mV dec−1. And it only needs overpotential of about 55 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, it also shows a good stability."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of CoO nanowires on Ni foam,"2.1 Synthesis of CoO nanowires on Ni foam CoO nanowires were grown on Ni foam (NF) by a simple hydrothermal method that the previous literatures have been reported. In detail, Ni foam was cleaned with 3 M HCl for several times. 0.727 g cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 0.6 g urea were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water, and the obtained homogeneous solution was further transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the clean nickel foam was placed vertically in the autoclave. Then the autoclave was put into the oven and maintained at 95 °C for 8 h. After the reaction, the Ni foam with CoO NWs precursor was washed with deionized water for several times and dried in vacuum at 60 °C. Finally the Ni foam with CoO NWs precursor was annealed in Ar at 400 °C for 2 h."
3,Synthesis of WO3/C@CoO on Ni foam,"2.2 Synthesis of WO3/C@CoO on Ni foam 0.85 g Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) and 0.5 g Ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6H2W12O40∙XH2O) were dissolved in 10 g deionized water, and the mixture was heated in the oven at 60 °C and then stirred to obtain a homogeneous solution by a magnetic stirrer. Next the Ni foam with CoO NWs precursor was soaked in this homogeneous solution for 10 h. After soaking, the Ni foam with precursor was dried in vacuum at 60 °C. Finally the Ni foam with precursor was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in Ar or Ar/H2 to obtain WO3/C@CoO materials."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The characterizations of the samples were carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, 5 kV), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Surface Science Instruments S-probe spectrometer), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα irradiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) and Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP, Vista Axial)."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements All of the HER electrochemical measurements for all materials were carried out by using a typical three-electrode setup. For testing conditions in 1.0 M KOH, the samples were used as a working electrode. Ag/AgCl electrode and graphite rod electrode served as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. For comparison, the commercial Pt/C (10 wt %, loaded on the Ni foam at 8 mg/cm−2) catalyst was tested in the same system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement were measured in 1 M KOH solution at scan rates of 50 mV s−1 and 5 mV s−1, respectively. All the potentials, measured an Ag/AgCl electrode, were converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) on the basis of equation ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.059 pH. CV experiments were conducted at the potential range from 0 to −0.1 V vs. RHE at scan rate of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV s−1, respectively. The accelerated degradation measurements of the catalysts were evaluated by conducting CV sweeps between 0.1 and −0.2 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 for 2000 cycles followed by LSV measurement at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The long-term stability was tested at the current density of 10 mV cm−2. All HER property curves were tested without iR correction."
6,Results and discussion,"The preparation of C and WO3 coated CoO nanowires is illustrated in Fig. 1 . To be specific, CoO NWs precursor was first grown on the NF via a simple hydrothermal reaction. After being grown with CoO NWs precursor, the color of NF changed from gray to dark purple. And then the NF with CoO NWs precursor was soaked in a homogeneous solution of ammonium metatungstate and PVA for 10 h. Subsequent removing and placing it in a vacuum drying oven. Finally, the precursor was annealed in Ar or Ar/H2 atmosphere at 400 °C for 2 h, and it was converted into WO3/C@CoO. In consequence, the color of NF further turned to black (Fig. S1). In the process of synthesis, PVA not only acts as a viscous material to promote a better combination of CoO and WO3, but also leads to the generation of the carbon layer to cover in the surface of the CoO NWs. The morphology and structural evolution of the as-prepared samples are analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The image of the bare NF is shown in Fig. S2a presenting a three-dimensional frame structure with high surface area. After hydrothermal reaction, the surface of NF framework was grown a layer of nanowire arrays (Fig. S2b). The SEM image of Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF is shown in Fig. 2 a, covering a layer of smooth surface on the basis of the CoO NWs. Fig. 2b and c show the images of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF in different magnification multiples. After annealing in Ar/H2 atmosphere, the shape of the nanowires was well maintained, but the surface of WO3/C@CoO nanowire precipitates a lot of nanoparticles, which is different from the Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF. The morphology of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF looks like octopus tentacles. As shown in Fig. S2c, there is no nanoparticles at the bottom of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF nanowires. After treating with 3 M HCl, the particles on the surface of the nanowires disappear, indicating that these nanoparticles are CoO (Fig. 2d–e). Because CoO can dissolve in HCl solution, and WO3 is insoluble [39]. In combination with Fig. S2c, if the precipitated particles are WO3, the nanoparticles should be uniformly deposited on the carbon coating surface. We also prepared Ar/H2-treated C@CoO/NF without WO3 and found that only a few nanoparticles are precipitated, suggesting that the presence of WO3 promotes the precipitation of CoO nanoparticles on the nanowire surface (Fig. S2d). To investigate the formation mechanism of the CoO nanoparticles, different calcination temperatures were investigated. In comparison with the smooth surfaces of nanowires at 300 °C, the appearance of slight surface nanoparticles at 350 °C (Fig. S2e-f). With increased calcination temperatures, the nanoparticles on the surface are gradually increase. The morphology of SEM image was further confirmed by TEM image. The TEM image of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF NWs is shown in Fig. 2f, which also shows that the surface of nanowire is composed of many nanoparticles. Fig. 2g is the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization to get more information about the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF NWs. The inset of Fig. 2g shows lattice fringes, which the interplanar space of 0.213 nm correspond to (200) plane of CoO. And WO3 may be mixed with C so that there is no way to find the lattice spacing of WO3. The high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image further revealed that the surface of the nanowire is granular in Fig. 2h. As shown in Fig. 2i–l, elemental mapping of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF NWs clearly indicates that C, W and O elements are evenly distributed throughout the entire surface of nanowires. While the Co element has obvious distribution boundaries, and the distribution of cobalt elements can be seen clearly in the precipitated areas. It also can be demonstrated that the nanoparticles precipitated from the surface of nanowires are CoO materials. XRD was employed to analyze the phase composition and crystal structure of the sample. To avoid the strong influence of NF substrate, XRD analysis was carried out by powder samples. XRD spectra of Ar/H2-treated and Ar-treated samples at 400 °C are shown in Fig. S3a. The similar patterns suggest that Ar/H2 annealing and Ar annealing do not change the material composition. The diffraction peaks at 23.64°, 48.43° and 54.57° can be indexed to the (200), (400) and (420) crystal planes of WO3 (JCPDS No. 46-1096). Some weak peaks at 36.6°, 42.4°, 61.5° and 73.7° can be attributed to (111), (200), (220) and (311) of CoO (JCPDS card No. 43-1004) [24,40]. In the XRD curve of Ar/H2-treated sample, the extra small peak refers to the peak of C. Thus, the composites of Ar/H2-treated sample are composed of WO3, CoO and carbon. In order to further study the chemical composition of the sample, XPS was used to detect the samples. As shown in Fig. 3 a, XPS survey scan confirms the presence of Co, W, C, O and Ni elements in both Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF and Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, 3c and 3d, the location of each element signal peak in Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF sample is consistent with Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, and no other signal peaks appear. The high-resolution Co 2p signal can be deconvoluted into a typical component at 780.7 and 796.9 eV corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively [41,42]. These values are in accordance with the Co2+ state, suggesting the Co 2p is derived from CoO. In addition, there are two shake-up satellites in Fig. 3b, which are consist with previous publication about CoO [42,43]. The high-resolution W 4f spectra (Fig. 3c) has two distinct feature peaks located at 35.7 and 37.8 eV belong to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, which are consistent with W6+ state in the form of WO3 [44,45]. Compared with the XPS of the W 4f after the Ar/H2 treatment of Ammonium metatungstate, the feature peaks located at 35.88 and 38.03 eV, indicating that the W element is in the low-valence (W5+) (Fig. S3b) [46,47]. The above can be explained that WO3 did not react directly with H2 and separate out on the surface of nanowire [48]. Thus, it is further demonstrated that the precipitated particles are CoO. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) has a strong peak of CC species lay in 284.5 eV [49]. The above analyses confirm the successful preparation of the WO3/C@CoO/NF composite material. So we can also conclude that the compositions of the material with Ar/H2-treated or Ar-treated are not changed, but only the morphology of the material is changed. Quantitatively, XPS analysis confirmed that the contents of W, Co, C and O were 2.7 at%, 3.5 at%, 77.4 at% and 16.4 at%. And as shown in Table S1, the ICP results illustrate that the atomic ratio of Co:W is 1.84:1. The electrocatalytic HER activities of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO supported on highly conductive 3D NF substrate were assessed by using a three-electrode system with Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode and graphite rod as counter electrodes in 1 M KOH. For comparison, commercial 10% Pt/C, Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, CoO/NF and bare NF were also measured. All of the potentials were converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for comparison. LSV curve shows the relationship between overpotential and current density. The overpotential is defined as the difference between the equilibrium potential and the potential of the catalyst in a specific current. And the overpotential and the current density are usually related [50]. As shown in Fig. 4 a, commercial 10% Pt/C exhibited the highest HER activity with near zero overpotential and the low overpotential of 15 mV on a current density of 10 mA cm−2. And the HER onset overpotential of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF is about 40 mV, which is much lower than those of Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF (50 mV), CoO/NF (200 mV) and bare NF (225 mV) materials, implying that has outstanding HER activity. Bare NF shows poor activity, which has little HER catalytic activity within the range of measured potential window. Further compared with the CoO/NF NWs, C@CoO/NF and Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF in Fig. S4a, the HER performance of CoO is significantly improved by carbon coating, and Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF shows improved electrocatalytic HER activity with a low overpotential of 90 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2. These results suggest that the enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the superior electron transfer rate caused by the inherent electrical conductivity of C and the synergistic effects of the composition of WO3 with CoO. What is more, the HER catalytic activity of the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF is better than that of the Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF. To provide a HER current density of 10 mA cm−2, the catalyst Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF only required a small overpotential of 55 mV. Compared with Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF after 3 M HCl processing and Ar/H2-treated C@CoO/NF (Fig. S4b-c), the property of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF with nanoparticles is significantly superior, suggesting that the nanoparticles of the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF surface provide more catalytic activity sites and the synergistic effects of the composition of WO3 with CoO is very important to improve the HER catalytic activity of the catalyst. From what has been discussed above, the nanoparticles which precipitated by Ar/H2 treatment have a very important effect on improving HER catalytic activity. Fig. 4b is an overpotential summary for the four samples at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It is quite obvious that the overpotential of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF is significantly lower than Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, CoO NWs/NF and bare NF. As shown in Table 1 , the octopus tentacle-like WO3/C@CoO/NF shows the lowest overpotential at the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 among many Co-based HER catalysts. This result indicates that the octopus tentacle-like WO3/C@CoO/NF electrode has superior HER catalytic property. Tafel plots could evaluate the kinetics of materials. To obtain more informations about the HER kinetics of materials, the corresponding Tafel plots were analyzed (Fig. 4c). The Tafel curves were drew using the equation η = a + b log j, where a and b represent the intercept and Tafel slope, respectively. The Tafel slope of commercial 10% Pt/C is 69 mV dec−1. Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF exhibites a small Tafel slope of 115 mV dec−1, lower than Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF (122 mV dec−1), CoO NWs/NF (132 mV dec−1) and pure Ni foam (142 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope of 115 mV dec−1 in our study demonstrates that the HER processes follow the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism by using Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF electrode [57]. The electrochemically active surface area is an important parameter to describe the catalytic activity of catalysts. Typically, the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalysts is proportional to the electrochemical active surface area [58]. Using a simple cyclic voltammetry method can measure the capacitance of the double layer. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of all samples were measured between 0 and -0.1 V vs. RHE at different scan rates from 20 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S4d–f). The Cdl was calculated by using the equation Cdl = I × Δ t s × Δ V = j v = k, where j, v and k stand for charging current per unit area, scan rate and slope of curve [26]. It can be seen from Fig. 4d that the Cdl of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF can be calculated to be 75.9 mF cm−2, and it is higher than that of Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF (19.5 mF cm−2) and CoO/NF (4.8 mF cm−2). This result indicates that Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF has the largest active surface area in all materials. Considering the difference in morphology and similarity in compositions between Ar-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF and Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, the higher properties of later may be attributed to the CoO nanoparticles modification and the corresponding morphology change. To construct a stable nanostructured catalyst is very importance for optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of HER. The durability of the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF was measured by the accelerated degradation tests continuously for 2000 times. As shown in Fig. 5 a, it is obvious that the polarization curve of after 2000 cycles between 0.1 and −0.2 V vs. RHE is similar to the initial one with negligible loss, thus reflecting that the good stability of this material as a stable HER catalyst. The high stability of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF toward HER was also evaluated using chronopotentiometry response at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution at 20 °C. To show the high stability of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, we also did a stability test for CoO/NF at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The corresponding timedependent potential curve is shown in Fig. 5b. The potential of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF only shows slight degradation during a longtime period of 110 h. This reason of slight degradation may be ascribed to hydrogen bubbles adhere on the surface of materials in the process of HER, which hindered the HER reaction. Compared with Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, CoO/NF has a relatively large degradation only after a period of 40 h. Fig. 5c and d show the SEM images of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF at different magnifications after stability test. As seen in the SEM of Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF, although nanoparticles on the surface of nanowires have disappeared, they still maintain a good nanowire structure. However, the morphology of the CoO has collapsed and the nanowires are stacked together (Fig. S5a-b). The phenomenon implies that the carbon coating retains the integrity of the morphology and enhances the stability of the catalyst, which also confirms that Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF has a superior stability. Such excellent stability among the best of all the noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is not ever reported."
7,Conclusion,"The octopus tentacles-like tungsten oxide and carbon coated cobalt oxide (WO3/C@CoO) catalyst on NF was prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction and immersion method. The Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF shows outstanding electrocatalytic activity for HER with an overpotential of 55 mV (vs. RHE) to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 115 mV dec−1, as well as excellent electrocatalytic durability after a long period of stability test for 110 h. Such superior HER property deriving from carbon coating enhances the conductivity of the material and promotes electron transfer. In addition, the unique octopus tentacles-like structure and strong synergetic coupled effect of the Ar/H2-treated WO3/C@CoO NWs provide a large specific surface area and more hydrogen adsorption activity sites to improve electrocatalytic HER reactions. Therefore, this work provides a simple method to synthesize highly efficient HER electrocatalysts, which could be a promising catalyst for practical applications."
