0,Introduction,"The past decades have been marked by an enormous growth in global energy demand owing to depleted reserves of fossil fuels and dangerous climate problems because of greenhouse gases emission, which have stimulated humanity to switch to alternative environmentally friendly and sustainable energy sources. Thereafter, versatile low emitting highly efficient energy conversion systems such as fuel cells start to offer promising alternative energy conversion approaches for stationary and portable power application [1,2]. Fuel cells convert the energy of chemical reactions of fuels directly into electrical energy, surpassing the typical intermediate stages of heat generation and mechanical work in Carnot cycle, which is involved in traditional methods of electricity generation. Consequently, fuel cells, achieving the 83% theoretical efficiency, are more efficient than heat engines due to the absence of thermodynamic limitations [3]. Thanks to their high-energy density, high efficiency, simple operation, quick start-up and shut-down cycle under ambient conditions, low-temperature fuel cells such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered as one of the most efficient and environmentally sustainable energy sources [4]. However, the necessity to use expensive catalysts based on Pt and other noble metals for electrochemical reactions at both the cathode and the anode, often reaching one-third of the cost of a fuel cell stack, limits the effective commercialization of these classes of fuel cells [5]. Furthermore, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the PEMFC cathode requires significant enhancement for their large-scale usage. Therefore, it is indispensable to develop highly active electrocatalysts and a lower Pt or Pd content in order to promote the actual commercialization of fuel cells. Zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and high energy density foster hydrogen to be considered as the faultless energy carrier. Nevertheless, hydrogen should be also economized by developing effective hydrogen storage and production [6–8]. Among several methods of storage, hydrogen can also be stored in nanostructured materials [9]. Water and hydrocarbon substances are major sources to obtain hydrogen. At the present moment, there are three main methods of hydrogen production: steam methane (CH4) reforming and coal gasification, constituting the major part of produced hydrogen, whereas only the minor part is attributed to water electrolysis. Thus, the most of hydrogen production relates to the usage of fossil fuels, causing the environmental contamination by CO2 emissions [7,9]. These two methods produce the hydrogen gas together with the other byproduct gases (CO, CO2, hydrocarbons), which further need a complicated purification process. Therefore, steam methane reforming and coal gasification methods of hydrogen production are not environmentally friendly processes. The abundance of water as accessible hydrogen source enables the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water electrolyses to be the most “green” ways to produce hydrogen. Water splitting implies the accomplishment through the pathways the water molecules to dissociate into the constituent hydrogen and oxygen elements [6–8]. To be concise, since the hydrogen-driven vehicles can exhibit performance comparable to that of gasoline-powered vehicles but without CO2 and other pollutants emission, it is vital to substitute conventional fuels by hydrogen counterparts [7,9]. In this case, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also crucial to several energy conversion systems such as H2O electrolyzers as the producer of hydrogen fuel for PEMFCs. Various supported Pt and Pd based nanostructures play a key role for HER electrocatalysis. To obtain efficient electrocatalysts with the lowest possible price, it is essential to use catalytic supports that facilitate the dispersion of the nanoparticles properly. The materials employed as electrocatalytic supports should possess main characteristics such as resistance to corrosion, high electrical conductivity, good interaction with the nanocatalyst and low cost [10–13]. In other words, the chosen material must be stable under the working conditions in acidic or alkaline electrolytes, high potentials, and highly oxidizing environments. For the usage in electrochemical appliances, it is essential to be adequately conductive because insufficiently conductive materials increase the resistance of the system yielding a loss of electrical efficiency. The catalytic supports should have a high surface area to enable a good dispersion of the nanoparticles while anchoring them strongly to prevent their detachment during the electrochemical reaction. Inasmuch as the usage of noble metals already leads to high cost, the supporting materials have to be inexpensive. However, presently, there is no material that meets all these conditions [10,13]. Commonly, carbons with a high electrical conductivity and surface area are used as the support. Carbon black is one of the first carbonic supports utilized in fuel cells because of its high availability, good mesoporous distribution and low cost [14]. Thus, platinum and carbon black have been benchmark materials for fuel cell because of their high electrocatalytic activity during fuel cell reactions [15]. Nonetheless, before being used as a catalyst support carbon black should be activated either chemically or thermally aiming to good dispersion of metals as well as its catalytic activity [16]. Moreover, carbon black has such a disadvantage as insufficient electrochemical stability [17]. Due to this limitation, functionalization and modifications of carbon-based and alternative supports have been extensively investigated in this decade in order to obtain reliable supports for fuel cell and water splitting practice. Herein based on the structural characterization and performance of different supported electrocatalysts recently reported in literature we highlight the challenges and opportunities for their use in fuel cells and water splitting, focusing on their stability, activity, and selectivity for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions."
1,Carbonaceous supports,"In recent years, many sophisticated carbonaceous materials have been devised to increase their surface area, stability and electrical conductivity [13]. The hollow graphite spheres allow a confinement of active nanoparticles inside so that the stability of these catalysts increases significantly [18,19]. Carbon nanofibers also present a significant improvement in stability, while exerts a promoter effect in catalysis [20,21]. The promoted catalytic activity and good stability toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and HER was demonstrated using the alloyed PdNi nanoparticles supported on carbon nanofibers (PdNi/CNFs) [22]. Synergetic effect between the bimetallic alloy and its CNF substrate considerably promoted the catalytic performance of this material. Pt–Pd (~5:1) alloy NPs of ~3–4 nm in size supported on Nafion-type polymer membranes with multi-walled carbon nanotubes showed the enhanced catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and ORR (maximal specific power of 65 mW/cm2 and current density of 130 mA/cm2 for fuel cell prototypes) [23]. Furthermore, it has been observed that carbon nanotubes are considerably more stable than conventional carbon due to their graphitic nature, which makes them more resistant to corrosion [13]. In addition, they also have a high electrical conductivity and surface area, which make them suitable as catalytic supports [13,20]. Martins et al. dispersed Pd NPs on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and on reduced chemically converted graphene (CCG) to obtain far more electrochemically stable catalyst in alkaline media than Pd NPs dispersed on Vulcan carbon support [24]. Other examples of carbonaceous supports with improved properties include ordered and disordered mesoporous carbons [13,20,25–27]. Such a structure enables the reactants accessible to the catalytic sites and possesses large surface area. Brandiele et al. revealed that deposition of Pt NPs on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon was a promising approach to increase the ORR catalytic activity and stability. The favorable interaction between Pt and support boosted the activity, which was also justified by pyridinic component binding energy shift in the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) [28]. Carbonaceous hybrid substrate consisting of graphene nanoplatelets and carbon black with different ratio for uniform distribution of Pt NPs was also obtained and showed the synergistic effect between metal catalysts and support along with reduced aggregation [29]. By altering the carbon black ratios Pt catalysts with hybrid supports displayed the change in their electrocatalytic activities. 60% GNPs:40% CB catalyst showed the best resistant to corrosion exhibiting the lowest losses of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) relative to the rest hybrid catalysts. Among all of carbonic morphologies, graphene is the most promising one due to its unique properties. It has a very high surface area, as well as a very high electrical conductivity and improved stability. For example, Zhang et al. [30] attained low overpotential and Tafel slope, elevated activity and stability relative to benchmark Pt/C for both HER and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) owing to synergy between Pt NPs and graphene. For these reasons, in this decade the use of graphene has been put into practice as an electrocatalytic support, which leads to the catalyst improvements in stability, activity and the efficient use of metallic nanoparticles [5,20,31]. From Ozdemir's report [32], the presence of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) support lowers the activation energy of ORR catalysts reaching the value of 14 kJ mol−1, which facilitates the ORR on the active Pt sites. Usually, a few layers of graphene were prepared in assistance of conductive polyaniline (PANI) polymers. The Pt/rGO catalyst demonstrated the improved activity and stability, and ECSA was about 63.7 m2/gPt. Through the liquid self-assembly method, the Au48Pd52 and Fe48Pd52 NPs were obtained and then deposited on rGO for further electrocatalytic evaluations for HER in alkaline electrolyte [33]. FePd/rGO exhibited bad performance and AuPd performed much better in activity and stability, but still worse than commercial Pt/C. The rGO-supported Pt–Pd alloys have behaved as bifunctional catalysts and shown the superior electrocatalytic activity toward HER and ORR in acidic and alkaline electrolytes in comparison with commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts as well as sufficiently good durability [34,35]. The good properties are explained by several factors, among which there are strong alloy-support interaction and synergistic effect preventing aggregation and altering the Fermi energy level. Deng at al [36]. have synthesized the PtPd alloy NPs supported on carbon nanowires (PtPd/CNWs) and ternary PtPdAu catalysts by electrospinning method as depicted in Fig. 1 A. The catalysts considerably outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalysts in both activity (mass and specific activities are about 4 times greater relative to those of benchmark Pt/C) and stability (ECSAs nearly remain steady after 5000 cycles, whereas 20% Pt/C declines nearly 40%) for ORR in acidic medium (Fig. 1 B). Binary catalyst displayed higher ORR activity than ternary counterpart with the same support. The good stability was attributed to the arching PtPd NPs in carbonaceous support, hindering the nanoparticles to migrate and aggregate, and the enhanced activity is owing to the addition of Pd, leading to a more reduced state of Pt and with an alloy effect (Fig. 1 A) [36]. Berthon-Fabry [37] and Katsounaros [38] pointed out that carbon-to-CO2 corrosion might be thermodynamically practicable at potentials from 0.207 VRHE, yet kinetically limited to 1.2 VRHE. It diminishes the long-term efficiency of the carbon-supported catalysts in the devices since the degradation of the support originates from the agglomeration and detachment of the active nanoparticles [38,39]."
2,Alternative supports,"The chemical composition of alternative supports commonly comprises the compounds of transition metals with oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and boron as well as their hybrids."
3,Oxide-based supporting materials,"3.1 Oxide-based supporting materials Among the alternatives to carbon, some of the most prominent are the transition metal oxides [40]. These materials are characterized by being stable under electrochemical conditions [10,11,13]. Among all the oxides used in fuel cell and water splitting practice, titanium, tungsten, tin and iridium oxides have received the most attention. Tin oxide is a good candidate as a support for ORR catalysts since it can exert a marked promoter effect [41]. Recently, da Silva et al. [42] studied iridium dioxide support effect on Pt catalyst bifunctional ORR–OER performance. The tungsten oxides have been used especially as catalysts supports for oxygen reduction, presenting a remarkable promoter effect [43,44]. The metal oxides present electronic structures ranging from insulators to semiconductors, metals, and superconductors. In a typical semiconducting structure, the small bandgap is associated with high reactivity, the oxygen levels in the valence band are destabilized and the metal levels are stabilized. The most reactive systems such as tin and titanium dioxides are semiconductor oxides, with a bandgap of approximately 3 eV, which can gain or lose oxygen. Thus, they have a tunable oxygen scarcity due to vacancies [45,46]. The semiconductor group of oxide materials, however, presents a major problem of electrical conductivity. Some of the approaches used to increase the electrical conductivity of these materials are the doping with other chemical elements, the synthesis of oxygen-scarce oxides, such as WO3-x, TiO2-x, or the preparation of mixed oxides [10,47–49]. This approach also yields the improved stability. Doping with antimony, indium, and ruthenium significantly increases its electrical conductivity and stability [50–53]. Gao et al. obtained a hybrid Pd/CeO2/C catalyst, which showed enhanced catalytic activity and stability for HER in alkaline medium compared with the Pd/C, CeO2/C, and their physical mixture (Pd/C–CeO2/C). Here the XPS analysis also reveals the existence of strong metal-support interaction leading to the Pd existing in the more oxidized form [54]. It is worth noting that HER activity and stability of Pd catalysts in alkaline media can be enhanced via core/shell Pd/FeOx(OH)2−2x approach [55]. Titanium dioxide has been most extensively studied and used due to its abundance and properties, among which its high electrochemical stability stands out [56]. Du et al. employed a combination of electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods to synthesize the hybrid ORR electrocatalyst with Pt deposited onto Nb–TiO2 nanofibers. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the experimental approach that includes two steps: the preparation of electrospun nanofibers and ALD of Pt NPs [57]. The accelerated durability test (ADT) demonstrated very good stability after 30000 cycles in a strong acid. However, the pristine TiO2 seems to be insufficiently conductive, therefore other stable phases of titanium oxide such as Ti4O7 possessing a considerably higher conductivity could be more appropriate in future fuel cell research [58,59]. Interestingly, solvothermal technique was employed to synthesize the mesoporous Ti0.7W0.3O2 nanomaterials by doping W (VI) into anatase-TiO2 lattices yielding homogeneously spherical shape of 10 nm nanoparticles and pores of 2.02 nm diameter. The approach resulted in the high surface area over 200 m2/g and diminished agglomeration [60]. As depicted in Fig. 3 the electrical conductivity of iridium-doped Ti0.7Ir0.3O2 nanorods is markedly higher relative to that of other materials, enabling this material to be perspective catalyst substrate for PEMFCs [61]. It has also been observed that titanium oxide based supports interact with metallic nanoparticles stronger than carbon-based supports, inducing an important electronic effect. For example, in titanium oxide, the detection of the shift of Ti 2p and Pt 4f peaks in the XPS and Ti L2,3-edge in the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) indicates that the titanium oxide yields charges to the metal nanoparticles. This effect is known as the SMSI (Strong metal-support interaction) effect and has been related to the improvements in the catalytic activity of metals supported on TiO2 [62,63]. An example of metal-semiconductor heterojunction and electron transfer are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 . The work function of anatase TiO2 is 4.4 eV for {101} facet [64], the work function of Pd is 5.6 eV for {111} facet [65], respectively. Anatase TiO2 has bandgap of 3.2 eV, which corresponds to the energy difference between valence band (VB) at - 7.4 eV and conduction band (CB) at - 4.2 eV [66], denoted by solid black lines in Fig. 4. Fermi level of anatase semiconductor (dashed black lines) is higher than that of Pd metal (dashed red lines), so the electrons in semiconductor have higher energy than electrons in metal, leading to an electron flow from TiO2 to Pd to align the Fermi energy levels and accumulate near the surface of Pd NP [67]. Recently Zeng et al. [68] have demonstrated a straightforward cation exchange approach to synthesize Pd/TiO2 HER catalyst with high dispersion of Pd NPs on anatase titania mesoporous spheres of 100–200 nm size. In addition, the support displays plentiful oxygen vacancy. Fig. 5 A schematically shows the synthesis process consisting of cation exchange and calcination and Fig. 5 B illustrates the HER activity in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytes. The improved HER performance of the nanocomposites in neutral, acidic and alkaline environments is ascribed to the synergistic effect between Pd NPs and support comprising exuberant oxygen vacancy [68]."
4,Other non-carbon supporting materials,"3.2 Other non-carbon supporting materials Transition metals carbides, being chemically stable in acidic media, electrically conductive, resistant to poisoning and strongly interacting with noble metals, are among the promising candidates of support materials [69,70]. For instance, Pt NPs were supported on WC hollow spheres, which provide more active sites for HER and can tightly bond with more Pt NPs due to their hollow and cracked microstructure and high specific surface area. Pt/WChs outperformed commercial Pt/C in HER activity showing good improvements of kinetic parameters [71]. It should be noted that PtxNi ultrathin nanowires/Ti3C2 were efficient HER catalyst [72]. Specifically, Pt3.21Ni/Ti3C2 achieved ultrahigh performance in acidic media with very low overpotential and markedly small Tafel slope. One dimensional (1D) Pt–Ni ultrathin nanowires have been in-situ obtained on the surface of 2D support material (MXenes (Ti3C2) nanosheets). Such 2D material facilitates the kinetics of intermediate reactions by providing the active sites as well as charge transfer between noble metal nanocrystals and nanosheet-support. XPS studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the electron transfer distribution between the MXene nanosheets and nanowires optimized the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption to boost HER in both acidic and alkaline media. In alkaline media, the vacancies on the surface of the nanosheets promoted the water dissociation leading to improvement in HER activities [72]. In addition, Mo2TiC2T x MXene nanosheets with abundant Mo vacancies were produced through an electrochemical exfoliation process, which offers active sites to trap Pt single atoms (PtSA) and improve the catalytic performance of the MXene [73]. The PtSA anchored on Mo2TiC2T x nanosheets demonstrated remarkable catalytic kinetics towards HER in acidic and neutral solutions, and the catalytic activity is superior to commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, the Mo2TiC2T x –PtSA displays prominent HER stability, owing to the strong covalent bonding between Pt atoms and MXene support, which prevents surface diffusion and coarsening of the PtSA catalyst. In acidic solution, the Tafel slope achieved 30 mV dec−1 and the overpotential was – 30 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 [73]. Transition metal nitrides also have excellent electrical conductivity and might be an appropriate supporting material. Titanium nitride (TiN) is a well-known alternative support for PEMFCs [74]. Although, recent results reveal that in acidic medium TiN undergoes corrosion [75,76], the stability of TiN can be enhanced by nanofiber structuring [77]. The ordered Fe3Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous Ti0.5Cr0.5N outperformed Fe3Pt/C in ORR activity and stability in acidic electrolyte [78]. Nan et al. considerably boosted ORR activity and stability on Pt NPs relative to benchmark Pt/C using TiN supporting material doped by nickel [79]. The porous morphology of the Pd/graphitic carbon nitride (Pd/CNx) material, synergistic effect and strong chemical bonding between Pd and support enhanced charge transfer leading to the superior HOR/HER activity and outstanding stability [80]. Li at al. reported the amorphous nickel boride (Ni–B) membrane coated on the multimetallic PdCuCo electrocatalyst, which manifests a higher mass and specific activity towards ORR and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline solution [81]. The Ni–B coating membrane regulates the electronic structure of catalyst surface. Furthermore, the interactional effect of the composite catalyst can be associated with the synergy between the ternary catalyst and Ni–B. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , the MOR and ORR activity of PdCuCo/Ni–B increases first and then weakens with an increase of Ni–B amount. The computational simulations confirm the prevailing effect of electron-scarce membrane modulating the electron distribution in the hybrid material and electronic structure of catalyst surface [81]. Earlier, Pt/TiB2 electrocatalyst showed four times greater durability relative to commercial Pt/C and similar ORR activity [82]. Noticeably, Sheng et al. [83] synthesized Pd NPs supported on NiCo2S4 flower-like submicron hollow spheres with mesoporous nano-sized shells. The Pd/NiCo2S4 HER catalyst showed improved electrocatalytic activity and stability in both acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (1.0 M KOH) electrolytes. The HER activity was boosted owing to the unique architecture of these materials, which exposed more active sites and exhibited synergistic effect. It is mentioned that this architecture is advantageous to the ion transport during the HER and to promote the electron transfer for acceleration the reaction rate [83]."
5,Supports for selective ORR and HER Pt and Pd catalysts,"The mechanism of the ORR is complicated and related to the electrocatalytic material. In fuel cell processes, the direct 4-electron path reduction to water is highly preferred (equations (4)–(1)): (4–1) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O U 0 = +1.229 V vs. RHE The reduction through 2-electrons is used in the industry for the production of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 as an intermediate (equations (4-2) and (4-3)) as the following: (4–2) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 U 0 = +0.695 V vs. RHE (4–3) H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O U 0 = +1.78 V vs. RHE where U 0 is the standard equilibrium potential for the reactions relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) [84]. Many researches have been accomplished to study the mechanisms of ORR using different electrode materials. To control the oxygen reduction reaction activity and selectivity, one of the critical parameters is the adsorption energy of surface intermediate oxygen-containing compounds [85–87]. For instance, Marković et al. revealed that H2O is formed through breaking the O–O bond, whilst the reaction proceeds through H2O2 pathway without splitting of O–O bond [88,89]. Therefore, in this review we discuss the ORR selectivity property in terms of which pathway occurs on a given catalyst, nonetheless, as for the concept of a selective HER catalyst, we regard the yield of hydrogen production and insensitivity towards hydrogen oxidation, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions. Notably, the ORR activity and selectivity can be tuned by utilizing support-induced surface-lattice strain. The d-band center can be shifted by alloying, shape optimization with different facet exposed and surface-lattice strain enabling the catalysts self-optimization for enhancing O-species adsorption owing to alteration of their binding strengths [89–91]. For instance, Zhang et al. studied compressive and tensile strain effects on Pt for Pt monolayers [92]. In their report, the compressive strain induces a down-shift in the d-band center. By contrast, tensile strain induces an up-shift. Thus, compressive strain is preferable to boost the selectivity for H2O2 owing to hindering the O–O bond to split, whereas tensile strain promotes O–O bond splitting [89,91]. Recently Sahoo and co-workers [93] pioneered in experimental evaluation in acidic medium along with computational predictions, pinpointing Au for selective H2O2 production and Pt for HER as the best single atom (Pt, Pd, Au and Ag) catalysts supported on titanium carbide (TiC), where H2O2 selectivity significantly outperformed that of commercial Pt/C (Fig. 7 A). The 1000 CV cycles ORR stability test of single-atom catalysts showed <33% mass activity decay (Fig. 7 B). The reason of such acceptable stability is in the carbon vacancy in TiC support and strong interaction between single-atom catalyst and TiC, which allowed stabilizing the noble metal catalysts on the carbide substrate surface [93]. The tungsten carbide/XC-72R-supported bimetallic electrocatalyst (PdFe-WC/C) developed by Yin et al. [94] exhibited good activity comparable with that of Pt/C towards the ORR in acidic electrolyte. The superior ORR activity is believed to be caused by the synergetic effect between WC support and both Fe and Pd metals. The cathodic catalyst is selective and alcohol tolerant (inactive for alcohol oxidation), which makes it a budding electrocatalyst for direct ethanol fuel cells. Furthermore, it was established that titanium nitride (TiN) is chemically and electrochemically stable and electrically conductive, which enables the stabilization of Pt NPs [95–97]. Noticeably, Luo et al. [98] designed a novel catalyst possessing good selectivity towards hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and ORR, where Pt atoms were well dispersed on nitride nanoparticulate support. XPS studies of Pt peaks revealed a SMSI between Pt and TiN support, making the material to be promising anodic HOR catalyst with oxygen-tolerance for PEMFCs. According to Bothra et al. [99] the ORR activity of O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O direct pathway for Pt clusters anchored on metallic and semiconducting MoS2 monolayers was investigated using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), where Pt clusters, anchored on semiconducting-MoS2 are predicted to have higher ORR activity relative to metallic-MoS2 supported ones [99]. Interestingly, Fortunato et al. [100] tuned the selectivity towards H2O2 by synthesizing and testing Pd nanoparticles on graphene nanoribbons (GNR), where catalyst-support interaction was identified as key factor for superior selectivity and activity (Fig. 8 ). For instance, the variations in activity and selectivity between Vulkan carbon and nanoribbons are associated with the Pd NPs dispersion, the differences of layer thicknesses, mass transport within layers and porosity. The enhanced selectivity along with the XPS peak shift implies the beneficial electronic SMSI. The improvement of Pd dispersion on the support can be reached owing to the sufficient concentration of nitrogen and oxygenated groups on graphene nanoribbons [100]. The combined experiment-theory study [101] shows that replacing the TiO2 support for PtCo by ZrO2 or CeO2 enables the tuning of the selectivity of PtCo electrocatalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, but for the overall activity, much smaller effect is observed. PtCo catalysts supported on ZrO2 or CeO2 are highly selective to methane (CH4), while carbon monoxide (CO) is preferred by using the TiO2 support. The metal-oxide interface facilitates the heterogeneity of active sites and enables moving away from the linear scaling of adsorbate binding energies, thus the synergistic effect between noble metal and oxide support at the metal-oxide interface contributes critically in adjusting the selectivity of PtCo alloy electrocatalysts [101]. It is worth noting that the polyallylamine (PAH)-functionalization of PdPt@PtPd core-shell nanodendrites displayed an improved ORR activity and durability relative to commercial Pt black, and also showed remarkable selectivity [102]. Based on single metal atom decorated graphene sheets Gao et al. [103] discovered that the adsorption on the single metal atom is reduced due to the low coordination number, with enhanced HER and OER performance [103]. They further confirmed this assumption by testing a series of transition metals as illustrated in Fig. 9 . The mesoporous silica-alginate beads embodied with graphene oxide-based functionalized palladium nanocrystallites with exceptionally tunable properties exhibited nearly 100% hydrogen generation selectivity from hydrazine, which is essential for their utilization for hydrogen evolution from the decomposition of hydrazine [104]. Garcia-Esparza and colleagues concluded that a Pt electrode adequately modified with Mo(IV) polyanionic species can demonstrate the insensitivity towards HOR and ORR while preserving good HER performance [105]. The MoOx/Pt/SrTiO3 material inhibited the water-forming reactions and selectively generated H2 in the presence of O2. Mo coating likely acting as a membrane confines the availability of H2 and O2 near Pt, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst [105]. Besides, according to Tang et al. [106], in the in-situ electrochemically prepared Pt/WS2 hybrid the interaction between Pt atom and tungsten disulfide nanosheets with rich exposed edges is very strong [106]. Such nanosheets demonstrated high HER activity, stability, and high edge-selectivity in alkaline medium. It is worth noting that Lv et al. [107] reported that Pd/TiO2 hybrids obtained through the laser ablation in liquid (LAL) can realize promising selectivity in alkaline medium and maintain a balanced relationship between hydrogen evolution and nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). XPS O 1s peaks in Pd–TiO2 indicated the strong interaction between Pd and the TiO2 substrate. Pt/TiO2 exhibits high HER activity, whereas Pd/TiO2 is fit for improving the efficiency of N2 conversion to form NH3 in alkaline media and suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The electron transfer from TiO2 to Pd or PdO owing to the different work function of PdO (7.9 eV), Pd (5.12 eV) versus TiO2 (4.2 eV) was also reported. Thus, electron-donating support positively contributes to activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts [107]. In addition, Sun et al. [108] synthesized peroxide directly from H2 and O2 using Pd (111) and Pd (100) supported on faceted γ-alumina (Al2O3) such as nanosheet clusters with mainly (110) facets exposed and nanoplates with a mixture of (111) and (110) facets exposed. The catalytic performance measurements demonstrate substantial size and support effects during the reactions. Moreover, the size of faceted Pd NPs supported on each of faceted γ-alumina supports was also optimized to reach the highest H2O2 productivity [108]."
6,Conclusions and outlook,"Catalyst supports contribute critically to the catalytic performance, durability, and selectivity of catalysts. In this review, we briefly discussed the research advancement in the designs of carbonaceous and alternative supporting materials in fuel cell and water splitting applications, particularly for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction and how functionalization promotes their electrochemical properties. Selection of the appropriate supporting materials allows boosting the durability and reaching superior catalytic activity. Despite the fact that the carbon black can undergo corrosion in the process of fuel cell operation, which degrades the fuel cell electrocatalysts and deteriorates mass transfer, carbon black is still the most frequently employed catalyst support at present. Novel carbonic materials constituting carbon nanotubes, graphene, mesoporous carbon, and their composites are being actively studied for ORR and HER applications. Graphene is an outstanding 2D material that has distinctive graphitized basal plane, high surface area, and high conductivity, all of which positively assist in the enhancement of catalytic activity and durability. However, it can lump into multiple sheets that diminishes the surface area, resulting in weakening the electrocatalytic activity. The ordered mesoporous carbons, which have high surface area, large amount of mesopores, defects and functional groups on their surface can be a highly suitable support for fuel cells as well. A decent progress has been achieved on carbon-free durable supports such as metal oxides and carbon-metal oxide composites as well. Nonetheless, some challenges still exist between the characteristics of obtained materials and practice requirements. For example, the insufficient electrical conductivity of most metal oxides could be possibly enhanced by doping with other conductive compounds. The majority of activity and durability evaluations with newly elaborated nanocatalysts are conducted using rotating disk electrode technique (half-cell mode) with alkaline/acidic electrolytes, which are not true representation of their actual performance in fuel cell. Consequently, it is crucial to validate their practical applicability by testing their performance in membrane electrode assembly under complex operating conditions. Future research to design efficient supported electrocatalysts should also consider the potentially efficient synthetic procedures with optimal parameters such as temperature, precursors, and metal mass ratio as well. There should be more involvement of computational modeling, which can theoretically predict the catalyst-support interaction. In-situ techniques should be wider employed for exploring the degradation of interfaces and interactions with other components."
