0,Introduction,"The hydrogen gas is known to be one of the most clean energy resources on the earth. The photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of practical and low-cost technologies in the hydrogen-based energy system. Co-catalysts are essential for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Noble metals have been utilized as useful co-catalysts [1–4]. Especially, platinum shows outstanding performance for photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was also reported that powdered graphite silica (GS) enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production by simply mixing with TiO2 [5,6]. GS is one of natural minerals, whose main components are quartz, carbon and several kinds of clay such as sericite and kaolinite. The enhancement effect is attributed to both the enrichment of hydrogen ions by the clay components in GS and the aggregation of GS and TiO2 particles [5,6]. The addition of GS to bare TiO2 may be not useful because nobody will use TiO2 alone for the hydrogen production. In this letter, therefore, we have studied the addition effect of GS to platinized TiO2 (Pt/TiO2) and also to a mixture of TiO2 and Pt. The addition of GS to Pt/TiO2 resulted in the decrease of the amount of H2 gas. However, in the case of powdered mixtures of TiO2, Pt and GS, those particles were aggregated and the amount of H2 gas was increased by the addition of GS to the mixture of TiO2 and Pt."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials The powder of titanium dioxide (TiO2, Degussa, P 25) was used as a photocatalyst with a mainly anatase structure (ca. 80%) under the shape of non-porous polyhedral particles of ca. 20nm mean size with a surface area of 49.9m2 g−1. The GS powder was obtained from Nishi-Nihon Environmental Engineering Inc. The mean diameter of the particle is 3μm and the surface area is 11.1m2 g−1. The spherical platinum powder (Pt, 99.5%) with a mean diameter of 1μm was purchased from Nilaco. The 0.3-wt% platinized TiO2 particles (Pt/TiO2) were prepared by the photodeposition method [7]. Methanol (Wako) was of the highest grade available and used as received. Laboratory deionized water was distilled twice and used through the experiment."
3,Procedures,"2.2 Procedures 2.2.1 Hydrogen production The amount of hydrogen gas evolved photocatalytically was measured by the following manner. Fifteen milligram of TiO2 or Pt/TiO2 and 15mg of additives were placed in a cylindrical flask (154cm3). The powdered mixtures in 40vol% aqueous methanol (20cm3) were dispersed by sonication for 1min in the flask whose top was sealed with a silicone rubber septum. To remove dissolved oxygen gas in the suspension, the suspended solution was bubbled with Ar gas (about 1mlmin−1) for 1h before photoirradiation. Photoirradiation in the UV region (300–400nm) was provided by a super-high-pressure mercury lamp under an Ar atmosphere of about 1atm with stirring. The evolved gas was sampled through the silicone rubber septum by using a locking-type syringe at a constant time interval. The sample gas was quantitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph. 2.2.2 Size distribution of suspension of TiO2, Pt and GS in water To investigate the size of aggregates, the size distribution of TiO2, GS and Pt particles in water was measured using a laser-scattering particle size distribution analyzer (Horiba, LA-920) in which a flow cell method was employed. The size distribution was measured on a volume basis. Each sample was measured under ultrasonication to investigate the dispersed particle size. To compare aggregated particle sizes with disaggregated ones, the measurement was carried out with and without ultrasonication. 2.2.3 SEM images of TiO2, Pt and GS aggregates The images of the dried suspension were obtained with a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S-4100). The dried suspension was prepared by following procedures. A mixture of TiO2 (15mg), GS (5mg) and Pt (10mg) was added to 20cm3 of water. It was suspended by a magnetic stirrer for 20min. Next, an aliquot of the solution was added to 10cm3 of water. Two drops of the sample solution were then placed on the aluminum plate and dried."
4,Results,"Fig. 1 shows the time course of the amount of hydrogen gas evolved using various kinds of photocatalysts. The amount of hydrogen gas increased with time for all the systems. The evolution rate of hydrogen gas for the systems of TiO2 +GS and TiO2 +Pt were 11μmolh−1 and 107μmolh−1, respectively. By the addition of GS powder to the TiO2 +Pt system, the rate was increased to 144μmolh−1. This indicates that the synergy effect of TiO2 and Pt is further enhanced by the GS powder. In contrast, the evolution rate of hydrogen gas for Pt/TiO2 was decreased from 173μmolh−1 to 89μmolh−1 by the addition of the GS powder. This indicates that GS is not able to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the Pt/TiO2 system, but rather reduces it. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the amount of hydrogen gas ( M H 2 ) on the amount of GS added to the TiO2 +Pt system. The system of TiO2 +Pt+GS always contained 15mg of TiO2 and also 15mg of a mixture of Pt and GS. For comparison, Fig. 2 also shows the dependence of M H 2 on the amount of Pt or GS for the TiO2 +Pt or TiO2 +GS systems, respectively. The lower and upper abscissas show the amount of Pt or GS, respectively. The summation of both M H 2 for the TiO2 +Pt and TiO2 +GS systems is also shown by a broken line, which is a measure for the hydrogen production ability in the case that Pt and GS independently function as a co-catalyst for TiO2. The M H 2 values for the TiO2 +Pt and TiO2 +GS systems simply increase with the amount of Pt and GS, respectively. For the TiO2 +Pt+GS system, the maximum M H 2 value obtained was 144μmol for 10mg of Pt and 5mg of GS. The M H 2 values for this system were larger than those shown in the broken line. The results clearly indicate that the coexistence of Pt and GS powders enhances strikingly the hydrogen production of TiO2. Fig. 3 shows the particle size distribution of various suspensions. The size distribution of the TiO2 +Pt+GS mixture is shown in Fig. 3d. The solid line shows the size distribution for the mixture which was added to water and allowed to stand for one day. The broken line shows the size distribution for the disaggregated mixture under ultrasonication. The mixture of TiO2, Pt and GS is highly dispersed under ultrasonication because there is less contribution of the smaller-sized particles in a solid line in Fig. 3d. Fig. 3a–c shows the distribution for disaggregated particles of TiO2, Pt or GS, respectively. All the peaks found in Fig. 3a–c shifted to a 4.5-μm peak observed in a solid line of Fig. 3d after mixing TiO2, Pt and GS together. These results strongly suggest that TiO2, Pt and GS particles clump together by simply mixing in water. Although the weight ratio of the mixture is that at the highest hydrogen production, the dispersed size distribution (a broken line in Fig. 3d) is similar to that of TiO2 (Fig. 3a). This suggests that the contribution of TiO2 particles is relatively high. Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the TiO2 +Pt+GS mixture after drying suspension. Fig. 4b depicts a magnified SEM image of that shown in a rectangular area of Fig. 4a. We can see in Fig. 4 that TiO2 and Pt particles are placed on the GS surface. These results clearly indicate and support that TiO2, Pt and GS particles aggregate together."
5,Discussion,"In the previous paper [6], we proposed the mechanism of the synergy effect between GS and TiO2 as follows: (1) The clay components in GS particles have the ability to elute several kinds of metal ions and exchange for hydrogen ions in the suspension. The resultant GS surface becomes more hydrophilic and hydrogen-ion-rich. (2) The pH values of the suspension increase to ca. 8 by adding GS. At pH values higher than 6.6, the –TiO− groups dominate on the TiO2 surface [8]. The negatively charged TiO2 clamps together with GS. (3) The hydrogen production is therefore increased by the photocatalytic reduction of hydrogen ions held in the clay in GS. All the results infer that the enrichment of hydrogen ions by the clay components in GS, the frequency of collisions and the degree of aggregation among TiO2, Pt and GS are important factors for the enhancement of hydrogen production. Here, we propose a plausible scheme for the hydrogen production in the TiO2 +Pt+GS mixture, as shown in Fig. 5 . When GS is added to Pt/TiO2, excited electrons in TiO2 move to Pt and then to nearby hydrogen ions, leading to the evolution of hydrogen gas. However, since a small amount of Pt (0.3wt%) is deposited on TiO2, the collision or aggregation between Pt and GS is limited to make an electron transfer from Pt to GS hardly probable. Therefore, the addition of GS to Pt/TiO2 did not enhance the H2 production, but it was rather detrimental, probably due to the filtering against UV light through the GS powder. On the other hand, when TiO2 is mixed with only Pt or GS, there are usual electron-transfer routes from TiO2 to each co-catalyst [5,6], as shown in Fig. 5 with broken and dotted lines. However, when GS is added to a mixture of TiO2 and Pt, an additional new route (TiO2 →Pt→GS) is highly probable, as shown in Fig. 5 with a solid line. The electrons in TiO2 move to Pt and then to hydrogen ions [5,6] on the surface of GS. It is considered that this new route leads to further increase in the hydrogen production than that in the two-components mixture of TiO2 +Pt or TiO2 +GS. In this connection, we have also studied the GS addition effect to other photocatalysts. The GS addition to SrTiO3 (Fuji Titanium Industry Co., Ltd.), whose surface does not change its wettability under UV irradiation [9], did not enhance the hydrogen production at all. The addition of GS to CuO and CdS instead of TiO2 also did not enhance the hydrogen evolution. At the present stage, therefore, it seems that the co-catalytic effect of GS on the H2 production is characteristic of TiO2 whose surface has photoinduced superhydrophilicity [9–14]. The superhydrophilicity of TiO2 may contribute to the association among three components of TiO2, Pt and GS. Further studies, however, are needed to clarify all aspects of the mechanism for the synergy effect."
6,Conclusion,"GS was added to Pt/TiO2 and the two-components mixture of TiO2 and Pt in order to increase the amount of hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solution. It was found that the addition of GS to Pt/TiO2 decrease the amount of H2 gas. On the other hand, in the three-components mixture of TiO2, Pt and GS, the amount of H2 gas was strikingly increased. The results on the particle size distribution and SEM images indicate that the particles of TiO2, Pt and GS clump together by mixing in suspension. The increment of hydrogen gas was attributed to the additional electron-transfer route of TiO2 →Pt→GS."
