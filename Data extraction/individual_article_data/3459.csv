0,Introduction,"It is well known that hydrogen is a clean, efficient, renewable, and non-polluting energy resource. It has a high energy content per unit weight of 122 kJg - 1 , which is almost three times to that of hydrocarbon. Hydrogen is an excellent promising energy alternative to replace the hydrocarbon fuel [1–4]. Hydrogen can be readily produced in many ways. However, if hydrogen is to replace fossil fuels in the future, it has to be produced renewably and in large scale, through environmentally friendly processes. From the perspective of global environmental impacts (such as the greenhouse effect and resource recovery), microbial hydrogen production carried out under mild operating conditions from renewable biomass is potentially more attractive, which reduces dependence on fossil fuels, decreases carbon dioxide emission, and recovers bioenergy [5–7]. Microbial hydrogen production using fermentative bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, or algae is an environmentally benign and energy-saving process and it has recently attracted considerable attention as an effective way of converting organic wastes to hydrogen [8]. The feasibility of applying acidogenesis of organic wastes to produce hydrogen has been widely demonstrated [2–4,9,10]. During the acidogenesis of organic wastes, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and sometimes alcohols are simultaneously produced. The products are composed mainly of organic acids, which could be further exploited by photosynthetic bacteria. Photosynthetic bacteria can produce hydrogen from organic acids [11], as well as generate various kinds of valuable materials including high amounts of protein with balanced essential amino acids, carotenoids, ubiquinone, and vitamin B12 [12]. These hydrogen-producing bacteria can utilize many organic wastes and contribute to waste treatment processes as they produce clean fuel. All processes of biological hydrogen production are fundamentally dependent upon the presence of hydrogenases. It is hypothetically possible that the quantity or inherent activity of these enzymes could limit the overall process. However, even though the catalytic activity of the various enzymes is enormously different from each other, there is no evidence for the quantity of the hydrogen-producing enzyme being the limiting factor in any system currently under study [13]. Indeed, in many microbial systems, potential catalytic activity far surpasses the amount of hydrogen produced, suggesting that other metabolic factors are limiting. There have been some studies on how the external iron concentration affects fermentation by fermentative bacteria and it has been reported that the in vivo activity of the hydrogenase decreases with iron depletion [14,15]. However, these researches mainly focused on solvent production and little work had been performed on hydrogen production. In this study, we investigated the role of the environmental factors of iron concentration on clostridia-rich, natural anaerobic microorganisms for hydrogen production. For this purpose, the experiments were performed using sucrose and mixed cultures as model system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The mixed cultures used in this study were enriched from cracked cereals brought to a 2h bake and a 30min boil to inhibit the bioactivity of hydrogen consumers. The cereals were seeded into a 1l completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), grown on a sucrose mineral salts medium at 35°C, a 24h hydraulic retention time (HRT), and stirred by gas circulation. The organisms responsible for hydrogen production were dominated by Clostridium pasteurianum. The 500ml culture was used to inoculate 1l of growth medium and after 1 month's growth this could be used. One liter of the medium contained sucrose, 11100mg; NH4HCO3, 3770mg; K2HPO4, 125mg; Na2CO3, 2000mg; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 5mg; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100mg; MnSO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 15mg; FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 25mg; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.125mg."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures The experiments were conducted in 120-ml glass bottles with a working volume of 80ml. One liter of the medium contained sucrose, 44g; tryptone, 20g; K2HPO4, 0.5g; Na2CO3, 8g; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 20mg; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 400mg; MnSO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 60mg; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.5mg, 40ml of the bacteria, 20ml of the medium, and 20ml of the FeSO4 solution (ranging from 0 to 20g FeSO 4 l - 1 ) were added to the bottles. The initial pH of between 7.4 and 7.6 was uncontrolled throughout the experiment. Then each bottle was flushed with Argon for 5min to provide anaerobic condition, capped, and placed in a reciprocal shaker (Reciprocation: 5 cm × 120 strokes per min). The batch experiments were conducted in the dark at 35°C. The biogas production was measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes, arranging from 10 to 100ml [16]. Data shown are representative results of independent experiments that were triplicated."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis The proportion of hydrogen was determined with a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU 14B, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2-m stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min - 1 . The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 80, 50, and 100°C, respectively. Detection of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2–C4) was also analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU 14B, Japan) using a flame ionization detector (FID). A 2-m glass column was packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 200, 150, and 220°C, respectively. The carrier gas was also argon at a flow rate of 30 ml min - 1 . The concentrations of sucrose after the reaction were determined by the phenol–sulfuric acid method using sucrose as a standard [17]. The concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined according to the procedures described in the standard methods [18]. The pH was measured using a pH meter (PHS-3B Shanghai, China). All gas production data reported were standardized to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg)."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Effect of iron concentration on hydrogen fermentation,"3.1 Effect of iron concentration on hydrogen fermentation Individual batch experiments were observed until the hydrogen production from each bottle stopped. Product analysis shows that the anaerobic fermentation produced a biogas only containing hydrogen and carbon dioxide, without detectable methane and sulfurated hydrogen, suggesting that no methanogens or sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the cultures used in this study. The percentage of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the biogas produced was slightly affected by iron concentration. The percent of hydrogen ranged from 35% to 54% and that of carbon dioxide ranged from 46% to 65%. The hydrogen percent reached the maximum (54%) at the iron concentration of 400mg FeSO 4 l - 1 . Fig. 1 illustrates the influence of different concentrations of iron on hydrogen production. It showed that the used iron concentrations excluded the residual iron concentrations ( 12.5 mg l - 1 ) in the bacteria liquor. For the blank system, the hydrogen fermentation ceased at 96h, the total hydrogen yield was ca. 167.4ml (Fig. 1a). For the system with iron concentration of 10mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , the trend of hydrogen fermentation is almost the same as the blank system except that the hydrogen fermentation ceased at 120h and the total hydrogen yield was 172.3ml. For the systems with iron concentration of 25 and 100mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , however, the hydrogen fermentations ceased at 60h, which are much quicker than that of the blank system. The corresponding total hydrogen yields were almost same ca. 178ml. With the increase of the concentration of iron, the total hydrogen production yields were obviously increased for the system with middle concentrations of iron 400, 800, and 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 as shown in Fig. 1b. The maximum amount of hydrogen production (2.73mol/mol sucrose) was obtained at the iron concentration of 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 . The total hydrogen yield reached 236.5ml and the hydrogen fermentation ceased at ca. 48h. For the systems with high concentrations of iron 3000, 4000, and 5000mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , however, the corresponding total hydrogen yields were about 174.5, 185.6, and 206.4ml, respectively (Fig. 1c). The above results indicated that the bioactivity of hydrogen-producing microbe used is promoted by the addition of the iron and 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 is an optimal concentration for promoting the bioactivity of microbe used. Therefore, when the concentrations of iron are in 25–800mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , hydrogen productions lasted 72h, which are less than that of blank test 96h. The 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 test lasted only 48h, suggesting that the sucrose was used up in a shorter time. However, with the iron concentration increasing from 3000 to 5000mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , excess iron was harmful to the hydrogen-producing microbe and resulted in the lag phase of hydrogen production. In this case the corresponding hydrogen production lasted 48, 60, and 72h, respectively, meaning that the bioactivity of hydrogen-producing microbe used will be inhibited under excess of iron. For 10mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , however, hydrogen production lasted 120h, which is more than that of blank test 96h. This result is unexpected and the detail investigation about this issue is under way. For lower concentration of iron (Fig. 1a), at the first 12h, the slopes were much lower than those of the systems with middle concentration of iron (Fig. 1b). However, for the system with high concentration of iron (Fig. 1c), no hydrogen was detected at the first 12h. The occurrence of the lag phase, a phase without any gas production was observed. A long lag phase of ca. 12h was found at 4000mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , and a longer lag phase of ca. 24h was observed at 5000 mg FeSO 4 l - 1 ."
7,Effect of iron concentration on VFAs production,"3.2 Effect of iron concentration on VFAs production Aside from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the major metabolites produced by the anaerobic culture were acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid, and butyric acid (HBu). Table 1 shows that HAc was the major liquid product for the blank system. HAc production yield decreased with increasing iron concentration from 0 to 100mg FeSO 4 l - 1 and increased slightly subsequently. HBu production yield increased with increasing iron concentration when it was less than 800mg FeSO 4 l - 1 and again decreased with increasing iron concentration from 800 to 5000mg FeSO 4 l - 1 . The final pH values of the experimental mixtures were around 4.6. As shown in Table 1, the maximum production yield of HAc ( 181.2 mg g - 1 sucrose), propionic acid ( 33.1 mg g - 1 sucrose), and HBu ( 241.9 mg g - 1 sucrose) were obtained at the iron concentrations of 10, 800, and 800mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , respectively."
8,Effect of iron concentration on sucrose conversion into biomass,"3.3 Effect of iron concentration on sucrose conversion into biomass The sucrose levels after the whole period of hydrogen fermentation reported here were low and over 99% of the added sucrose were converted to fermentation end products. The biomass yield increased with increasing concentration of iron when it was below 800mg FeSO 4 l - 1 . The maximum dry biomass weight (DBW) was 0.2202g VSS g - 1 sucrose at the iron concentration of 800mg FeSO 4 l - 1 (Table 1). It is well-known that iron is an indispensable element for bacteria multiplication. There is an optimal concentration of 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 for the bacterial growth used in this study to produce hydrogen. Undoubtedly, an appropriate amount of iron is beneficial to increasing the activity of bacteria. However, excess of iron will be harmful to the bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1c, the occurrence of the lag phase might be explained by the fact that bacteria need time to grow under the new condition of high concentration of iron. From the distribution of the dry biomass weight, we could also conclude that the quantities of the bacteria followed the same trend with the hydrogen production yield. Namely, the concentration of iron affected both the cultivation and the hydrogen-producing activity of the bacteria."
9,A crucial signal: HBu/HAc ratio,"3.4 A crucial signal: HBu/HAc ratio HAc and HBu were the major aqueous products as shown in Table 1. The amount of these liquid products was varied with the change of the amount of iron. The distribution of metabolites formed during hydrogen fermentation is often a crucial signal in assessing the efficiency of hydrogen-producing cultures [19–21]. These results show that the acid-forming pathway dominated the metabolic flow and HBu was the major metabolite in the hydrogen-producing bacterial microorganisms. The available hydrogen from glucose degradation during hydrogen fermentation has been determined using the HBu/HAc ( B / A ) ratio [22,23] and has frequently been used as the indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of hydrogen production [24,25]. For lower concentration of iron ( < 100 mg FeSO 4 l - 1 ) , the ratios of B / A are 0.7–0.9, which are almost equal to that of the blank system. Here the main product of metabolites is HAc. For the 100–1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 of iron concentration, the values of B / A are in the range of 6.82–1.93 suggesting that the main product of metabolites is HBu. When the concentrations of iron are more than 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , the values of B / A are less than those for the middle concentrations of iron. The corresponding hydrogen production yields also increased or decreased in accordance with the variation of the HBu production yields as shown in Table 1. These results indicate that when the concentrations of iron are in 100–1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 , HBu pathway dominated the metabolic process for the bacteria used. It suggested that the formation of HBu in this study seems to favor H2 production. The optimal B / A ratio for hydrogen production varies with the differences in the anaerobic cultures and the substrate used. For instance, using sucrose as the carbon substrate, the optimal B / A ratio for the hydrogen-producing cultures of Chen et al. [20] was 5.1, while the value for the bacterial microorganisms used in this study was about 2–3. If glucose was used as the carbon substrate, the result differs from the above. That is, the optimal B / A ratios should only be applied to concrete experiment and should not be compared with each other. The maximum yield of hydrogen production was 2.73 mol mol - 1 sucrose in this study. It is higher than that of other experiments using sucrose as substrate by mixed culture as shown in Table 2 . Hydrogen conversion efficiencies for sucrose cultures were calculated based on the assumption of a maximum of 4mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose and 8mol of hydrogen per mole of sucrose. The conversion efficiency of this study was 34%, which is still lower than the maximum value observed in those experiments of glucose cultures by pure bacteria, but is higher than that of other mixed culture experiment using sucrose as substrate. Thus, the mixed culture used in this study is superior to other studies in a certain degree, especially in the hydrogen production yield."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, the experimental results showed that the effects of iron concentrations on the yield of hydrogen production, VFAs, the cultivation of bacteria, and so on. This study indicates that the existence of iron has an obvious effect on the metabolic approach of the bacteria used. The middle concentrations ranged from 400 to 1600mg FeSO 4 l - 1 promote the metabolism of butyric acid, restrain the metabolism of acetic acid in a certain degree, and advance the yield of hydrogen production. However, the effect of iron on the hydrogen-producing bacteria is under in-depth investigation because iron is an indispensable element in the metabolism of microorganisms and the appropriate concentration of iron will promote the hydrogen production."
