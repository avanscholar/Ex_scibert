0,Introduction,"With the gradual depletion of fossil fuels, the foreseeable scarcity of energy and chemicals has attracted worldwide attention. Furthermore, overexploitation and consumption of fossil feedstocks will also lead to the environment pollution, such as city smogs and global warming (Sirous-Rezaei et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018). Therefore, a series of novel, sustainable and environment-friendly resources, such as biomass, are gradually giving rise to the interest of people (Lancefield et al., 2015). Lignin as a major component of lignocellulose, is the most abundant natural polymer characterized by ether linkages, methoxy groups and hydroxyl groups, and has significant potential as a source for the sustainable production of bulk chemicals (Hdidou et al., 2018). Many strategies have been proposed for lignin transformation, such as pyrolysis, oxygenation, hydrocracking and hydrolysis (Hdidou et al., 2018). Therein, catalytic hydrotreatment is recognized as an efficient method to convert lignin into aromatic chemicals. Extensive research is available regarding the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin and its model compounds with the existence of high hydrogen pressure (Gómez-Monedero et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). (Hu et al., 2019). For instance, the deconstruction and subsequent HDO of organosolv lignin using zeolite supported Ni catalyst was reported, the results showed that the 39.0 wt% liquid products yield with 83.0% monocyclic alkanes was achieved at 593 K and 2 MPa H2 (Kasakov et al., 2015). Although monometallic Ni catalyst could promote lignin hydrogenolysis, they inevitably lead to the over-hydrogenation phenomenon of the aromatic ring. Moreover, the limitation of the poor recyclability and stability of these catalysts existed in lignin depolymerization (Kloekhorst and Heeres, 2016). Comparatively speaking, bimetallic Ni-based catalysts offered the possibility to enhance the cleavage of ether and product selectivity owning to the synergistic effect of catalysts (Barta et al., 2015; Kelun et al., 2011). Recently, Ni-Fe alloy catalyst was used for the direct HDO of birch wood sawdust, which achieved 39.5 wt% yields of phenolic monomers at 225 °C under 2 MPa H2 (Zhai et al., 2017). Aromatic monomers were predominantly mono- or dimethoxy, however, demethoxylation was a prerequisite to obtain aromatic alcohol et al. high value chemicals. It has been reported that Re could promote the high selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons in the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole over Re-MoOx/TiO2 (Ghampson et al., 2018). Pt-Re alloy catalyst exhibited much higher activity on disrupting C-O bonds in hydrogenolysis of lignin (Hu et al., 2019). Recently, Kumar et.al reported the use of bimetallic sulfided NiMo and CoMo catalysts on various supports (Al2O3, AC, MgO-La2O3) for kraft lignin hydrotreatment in the absence of an external solvent (350 °C, 100 bar H2, 4 h), whereas 87.0% lignin conversion and 26.4 wt% monomer yield obtained over NiMo/MgO-La2O3 catalyst. Besides, the aromatics only accounted for 5.9 wt% in the liquid products ((Kumar et al., 2015). The limited aromatic compounds production further indicated that the type of support significantly affected reaction pathway and product distribution. Thus, the major challenge was to design an optimal catalyst, which should be active to cleave the C-O bond of lignin into aromatic alcohols under mild reaction. Compared with other traditional oxide supports, the superior oxophilicity of Nb2O5 support could facilitate the directly selective cleavage of Caromatic-OH bonds in phenolic oligomers. Barrios et al. also investigated the performance of Pd supported on different metal oxide for the HDO of phenol. Cyclohexanone and benzene were the dominant products for Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Nb2O5, respectively. The latter superior benzene selectivity was likely due to the strong interaction between the oxophilic sites corresponding to Nb5+/Nb4+ cations and the oxygen from the phenol (Barrios et al., 2018). Thus, the preferred approach and product distribution depends on the catalyst performance and reaction condition. Inspired by their efforts, herein, we prepared a recyclable Ni-Re bimetallic catalyst supported on Nb2O5 for efficient and selective depolymerization of kraft lignin (KL) in ethanol solvent. The synergistic effect between Ni-Re and Nb2O5 species would improve the deoxygenation activity and inhibit the hydrogenation of aromatic ring. Solvent also plays an important role in lignin deconstruction reaction. Abundant research was available regarding the catalytic hydrotreatment of lignin in the presence of hydrogen donors (Matson et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2014). It was reported that efficient catalytic hydrogenolysis of kraft lignin was converted into aromatic monomer at 320 °C in supercritical methanol (Barta et al., 2015). Catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin to monomeric phenols was researched using isopropanol as in-situ hydrogen source (Hu et al., 2019). By comparison, ethanol exhibited superior activity in thermocatalytic conversion lignin over CuMgAlOx catalyst, which exhibited that ethanol as capping agent and formaldehyde scavenger resulted in much more monomer yields. Moreover, the occurrence of alkylation, esterification and guerbet reaction could prevent the repolymerization reaction during lignin depolymerization (Huang et al., 2015c). In this contribution, catalytic hydrogenolysis of kraft lignin was researched over different proportion Ni or Re catalysts. Besides, the role of 5Ni-5Re bimetals supported on different supports was also studied based on the optimization of the lignin conversion and aromatic alcohols monomer yields. In order to correlate the relationship between liquid product distribution and catalyst activity, abundant analysis and characterization referred to bio-oil and catalyst have been carried out. In addition, the effect of temperature, time and solvent were also discussed in detail."

The standard gases (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8) were purchased from Shanghai Pujiang gas Co., Ltd. All chemicals in this work were used without further purification."
3,Preparation and characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of catalyst The Nb2O5 support was prepared according to the following methods. Briefly, 2 g Niobium (V) chloride was dispersed into the 50 mL ethanol and stirred for 6 h until the mixed solution became transparent. Then the suspension was transferred into the oven and heated to 160 °C for 12 h. The support was washed using deionized water and separated via filtration, followed by drying at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the resulting solid was calcined at 500 °C for 1 h with a heating ramp of 2 °C/min. The bimetallic Ni-Re catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness co-impregnation of Nb2O5 using aqueous solutions of calculated amounts of NH4ReO4 and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O salts. Correspondingly, the amount of metal loading was 10.0 wt% relative to the support. The mixture was aged for 12 h and then dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight, followed by calcination at 400 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Finally, the solid was reduced by H2 (20 mL /min) at 450 °C for 1 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained on Bruker D8 Dscover with Cu Kα from 10° to 80° at a scan speed 10°/min. Inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were measured by the Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300 instrument. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was performed on a BELSORP-max apparatus, and pore size distribution was calculated using the desorption branch of the isotherm according to the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The morphology of as-synthesized catalysts was recorded on scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL 30) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F). Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (BEL JAPAN INC.). Samples were pre-treated in flowing Ar at 5 °C/min to 500 °C, and then held at this temperature for 2 h. The catalysts were cooled to 120 °C in flowing He and then saturated with flowing 10% NH3/He for 30 min. Finally, the desorbed NH3 was measured using a thermal conductivity. The interaction between the active phase and the support was determined by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a TP-5080 instrument. Prior to analysis, samples were flushed with high purity argon at 200 °C for 1 h followed by reduction with 10% H2/Ar from 25 °C to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min."
4,Thermocatalytic conversion of kraft lignin,"2.3 Thermocatalytic conversion of kraft lignin In a typical catalytic conversion experiment, KL (0.1 g), Ni-Re/Nb2O5 (0.04 g) were placed into a 25 mL stainless steel batch autoclave reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and 12 mL ethanol was added to the reactor. After purging the reactor for 5–6 times with N2 to remove air, the autoclave was heated up to a desired temperature of 543–623 K at a stirring speed of 600 rpm. The mixture was vigorously stirred for several hours and quickly cooled to room temperature rapidly in a water bath. The obtained products were separated by a method based on the previously reported work (Fig. 1 ). Firstly, the gas products were collected after the reaction and stored in a gas bag. Then the n-dodecane as internal standard was added into the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture was filtrated to remove the catalyst and char, and then the filtrate was obtained for analysis. Liquid products were identified by GC–MS, GPC and elemental analysis. After that, the filter cake was collected by washing with DCM and THF solvents several times. Finally, the filter cake was dried overnight and weighted. The conversion of lignin, the yields of bio-oil, residue and monomer were determined based on the initial lignin intake using the following Eqs. (1–4). (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = Initialligninwt . - R e s i d u e w t . Initialligninwt . × 100 (2) B i o - o i l y i e l d ( % ) = Bio - o i l w t .

5,Products analysis,"2.4 Products analysis The gaseous products were analyzed with an Agilent 7900 gas chromatograph system, equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The identification and quantification of gaseous products were calculated using peak normalization method. Among them, hydrogen and helium were selected as carrier gases to analyze the composition of carbon-containing gases and H2, respectively. The liquid-phase product analysis was performed on a GC-MS instrument (Agilent 5975C), whereas quantification was performed with GC-FID (Agilent 7890A) by using n-dodecane as internal standard. The molecular weight of bio-oil was measured by means of gel permeation chromatography (Shimadzu apparatus) equipped with two columns connected in series (Mixed-C and Mixed-D, polymer Laboratories) and a UV/vis detector at 254 nm. Analyses were obtained at 25 °C using THF as eluent with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. All the samples were filtered with 0.22 um filter membrane before the injection. The component of C, H, N in lignin and liquid products were conducted by an element analyzer. Oxygen content in the bio-oil was obtained by difference using 100% minus C%, H% and N%. The heating value of liquid products was calculated using the Dulong formula (Yang et al., 2016): H e a t i n g v a l u e M J / k g = 0.335 × C + 1.423 × H - O . 154 × O - 0.145 × [ N ] , where C, H, N, O was the content of each element."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic depolymerization of kraft lignin and analysis of the volatile products,"3.1 Catalytic depolymerization of kraft lignin and analysis of the volatile products The catalytic hydrotreatment of KL using Ni-Re as the catalyst was investigated at 330 °C for 3 h in ethanol solvent. A workup procedure was developed to distinguish the product component, including gaseous phases, volatile species, non-volatile substances and char. Among them, the volatile product was isolated and analyzed in detail by GC–MS. The results of the catalytic alcoholysis KL were summarized in Table 2. Firstly, blank experiments (without catalyst) were performed to investigate the hydrothermal liquefaction reaction of KL. Only 47.10 wt% oil yields with the conversion of 70.75% were obtained, and most of them were converted to bio-char (THF insoluble fraction) and phenolic oligomer, which declared that incomplete depolymerization of lignin was occurred in ethanol system. However, all the catalysts exhibited superior KL conversion, oil yields and monomer yields. Specifically, an increasing of lignin conversion was demonstrated with a reduction of solid residue, and the yield of the monomer was also increased to 19.73 wt% (Table 2, entry 2). These results illustrated that acidic Nb2O5 support could also promote the cleavage of ether bonds and facilitate the deconstruction of lignin. The better performance in both monomer yield enhancement and bio-char elimination was appeared when 10.0 wt% metallic Ni was introduced into the Nb2O5 support. For instance, the yield of monomer increased from 15.09 wt% to 26.14 wt%; meanwhile, the yield of bio-char decreased from 27.01 wt% to 7.90 wt% (Table 2, entry 3 vs. 1). The products were mainly composed of guaiacol, syringol, alkylphenol and their derivatives, together with minor alkane-substituted aromatic chemicals, such as 4-ethylphenylethanol, 1-m-tolyl-ethanone and so on. Wang et al. also described the Ni nanoparticles inlaid in lignin-derived carbon as catalyst for lignin depolymerization. The aromatic monomer product was also rich in oxygenated-phenols in the 4-dioxane solvent at 260 °C, 1 MPa H2. The existence of a large number of oxygenated phenols such as 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol further indicated that the Ni-based catalyst was not conducive to the removal of phenolic hydroxyl (Wang et al., 2019). In contrast, the lower activity for KL depolymerization was exhibited in the presence of Re/Nb2O5 catalyst, and the total yield of the monomer was only 20.69 wt% (Table 2, entry 7 vs. 3). Nevertheless, bimetallic catalyst exhibited the higher monomer yield and less solid yield compared to the monometallic catalyst. The results listed in Table 1 showed that the lignin depolymerization substantially depended on the Ni/Re ratio of catalyst. Specifically, when the Ni/Re ratio was 1.0, a significant increase of monomer yield was exhibited with least bio-char formation. It was attributed that the formation of optimum alloy structure in bimetallic 5Ni-5Re catalysts enhanced the ability of lignin depolymerization (Table 2, entry 5). Yang et al. also reported that Ni-Re neighboring site was the active for breaking the C-O bonds in the hydrodeoxygenation of m-cresol (Yang et al., 2017). The present results obtained for lignin conversion and monomer yield were significantly higher than those obtained using NiW and NiMo catalyst at 320 °C and 35 bar H2 (Barta et al., 2015). What’s more, the metal ratio of Ni and Re would also influence the composition of monomer products. The content of aromatic alcohols increased distinctly, accompanied by the decrease of phenolic compounds. Further quantitative analysis illustrated that aromatic alcohols and its derivatives occupied the dominant components, accounting for 27.46 wt% of the total volatile products. It was reported that addition of Re could improve direct deoxygenation to toluene in the HDO of m-cresol (Ghampson et al., 2016). Sirous-Rezaei et al. also found that the FeReOx/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited the enhanced performance for mild-condition (pressure: 1 atm and temperature < 350 °C) HDO of phenolics (Sirous-Rezaei et al., 2018). Immediately, the physically mixed 5Ni/Nb2O5 and 5Re/Nb2O5 catalysts were used in the deconstruction of lignin, resulting in the minor amounts of aromatic alcohols. The reduce of activity further explained that the separate Ni and Re catalysts were unfavourable to the acquisition of high-value chemicals. Therefore, the superior 5Ni-5Re alloy structure coupled with Nb2O5 oxophilic support boosted the cleavage of C-O bonds via direct demethoxylation or dehydroxylation and enhanced the selectivity of aromatic alcohols. Recently Wang and co-workers described the hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 lignin model compound over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst (Dong et al., 2018). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a synergistic effect between Ru and Nb2O5 oxophilic support was profitable to the selective production of arenes. In addition, a small amount of chain compounds were also detected in the liquid products, which was due to the dehydrogenated ethanol acted as a crucial active intermediate in the formation of alcohols and esters. Similarly, non-ignorable compounds such as chain ethers, alcohols and esters were also obtained in the depolymerization of lignosulfonate using isopropanol as in situ hydrogen source (Liu et al., 2018). In order to better research the promotional effect of bimetal catalyst, the 5Ni-5Re supported on other supports were also evaluated in the lignin alcoholysis reaction (Table 2, entry 11–14). The results showed that all samples demonstrated good catalytic activity in lignin hydrogenolysis. Especially, 93.35% of the lignin was converted over 5Ni-5Re/Al2O3 with 92.96 wt% oil yield and 28.80 wt% total monomer yield, respectively. While the solid residue yield notably increased to 5.89 wt% compared to 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst, clearly indicating that the surface area of catalyst played an important role in the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. A previous research also verified that the larger surface area of the support was not only conducive to the dispersion of the catalyst, but also beneficial to the conversion of lignin-derived oxygenates. Immediately, the product compositions obtained over the four other supports were also found different to those obtained with the 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst, mainly consisting of phenols, aromatic alcohols, cyclic alcohols/ketones, and cycloalkanes. The appearance of cyclic hydrogenation products further illustrated that the nature of catalyst could influence the catalytic reaction pathway. Resasco’s group explored the role of metal oxophilicity on the mechanism of anisole conversion over silica-supported Pt catalyst. They found that the hydrogenation of aromatic rings instead of the direct cleavage of Caromatic-O bonds was observed firstly over the least oxophilic catalyst (Pt/SiO2) (Tan et al., 2015). Likewise, the enhanced cycloalkane mixture yield (43.9 wt%) was obtained over Ni/ASA catalyst under 6.0 MPa H2. It was known that the phenolic compounds firstly undergone aromatic ring hydrogenation to form cyclic alcohols and or cyclic ketones, which was subsequently dehydrated to cycloalkanes. The present metal-catalyzed scheme was very discouraging in the HDO of phenolic compounds, which usually resulted in extensive hydrogenation of the aromatic rings. Thus, the oxyphilic property of catalyst support would significantly affect the catalytic reaction network and obtain the different product distribution. The optimal 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst was studied for five consecutive experiments, and the results were also summarized in Table 2 (entry 6–7). Although the similar lignin conversion and oil yield were given in the first cycle test, a small but significant decrease in oil yield was detected after the fifth test. In line with this observation, a lower content of the aromatic alcohols (20.03 wt%) accompanied by the 30.95 wt% monomer yield was also measured in the liquid products. The decrease of activity was likely due to the partial deactivation of catalyst. A slight increase of the metal particle size was observed from the TEM results, which implied that the sintering phenomenon occurred during the hydrotreatment reaction. Furthermore, the agglomeration of catalyst particles also led to the reduction of specific surface area. The lower catalytic activity further demonstrated that catalyst with smaller particle size and larger surface area were conducive to the efficient conversion of lignin (Kong et al., 2019). The significant activity loss was observed in the catalytic ethanolysis of kraft lignin over Mo2N/Al2O3 catalyst after three runs (Chen et al., 2017a). Additionally, the loss of metal and acidic contents would also lead to the decrease of oil yield and monomer yield. These observations were in agreement with coal liquefaction literature where the deactivation of catalyst was observed under liquefaction reaction. (Huang et al., 2015b)."
8,Analysis of the nonvolatile products,"3.2 Analysis of the nonvolatile products The molecular weight distributions of the nonvolatile product from lignin depolymerization were analyzed by GPC. A broad peak appeared in the low retention volume corresponding to high molecular weight region, which illustrated that the condensation reaction occurred in the absence of catalyst. Moreover, the distributions of molecular weight moved towards larger retention volume and the peak intensity became stronger after treatment with catalysts. Compared with single metal catalysts, 5Ni-5Re alloy catalysts presented the better activity in reducing molecular weight distribution, which further implied that the formation of alloy structure not only facilitated the breaking of ether bonds, but also promoted the conversion of phenolic oligomers to monomers. For instance, the largest retention volume along with the lowest molecular weight was presented over 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst. It was probably because the appropriate surface area and acidity could promote the conversion of lignin to small molecule compounds. Importantly, the average molecular weights of the obtained bio-oil was significantly lower than that reported in the literature (Kristianto et al., 2017). Moreover, the molecular weight distribution of bio-oil with 5Ni-5Re/CeO2 and 5Ni-5Re/Al2O3 was distinctly lower than that of 5Ni-5Re/ZrO2. This observation further illustrated that the relative larger pore size was positive on the suppression of char formation (Ma et al., 2019). Besides, the largest molecular weight distribution accompanied with the lower monomer yield was observed over 5Ni-5Re/SiO2, indicating the aggravation of repolymerization reaction because of the strong acidity. Chen and co-workers studied the kraft lignin depolymerization over Al-SBA-15 catalyst and found the repolymerization of the phenolic dimer and oligomer could be promoted significantly over strong acid catalyst (Chen et al., 2017b). In addition, the main elemental composition of the original KL and oligomers was determined and the results were presented in Table 3 . The KL material was consisted of 47.68 wt% carbon, 5.11 wt% hydrogen, 47.12 wt% oxygen, and 0.89 wt% nitrogen. In the presence of catalyst, the carbon and hydrogen contents of the oligomers were significantly higher and observed in the ranges of 71.83–75.57 wt% and 7.93–9.23 wt%, respectively. Notably, the slightly higher H/C and lower O/C molar ratios in the bio-oil were obtained with bimetallic 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst. The increase in the H/C molar ratio was due to the methylation reaction and the decrease in the O/C ratio was mainly due to the deoxygenation reaction. Moreover, the high heated value (HHV) of the product increased to 35.42 MJ/kg, presenting a great potential to produce the high value-added chemicals. Moreover, the hydrogen content of bio-oil obtained by other support increased significantly, confirming the occurrence of benzene ring hydrogenation reaction, which was also in good accordance with the GC-MS results. To achieve a deeper analysis of the oligomers structure, 1H–13C HSQC NMR measurement was performed. At the aliphatic area, the characteristic signals of ether bonds, such as α-O-4 and β-O-4, have disappeared, suggesting the effective breaking of these linkages. The observation of signals at 10–40 ppm (13C) and 0.5–3 ppm (1H) indicated the preservation of the aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols. Simultaneously, the higher chemical shift (δC 40–60 ppm, δH 3–5 ppm) was also observed, representing the signal of chain alcohol structure of aromatics (Huang et al., 2015a). In addition, signals in area (δC 120–130 pm,δH 6.5–8.0 ppm) of the aromatic region corresponded to aromatic protons of both aromatic alcohols, which was in accordance with the results of GC-MS. In addition, the chemical shift regions corresponding to the guaiacols was absent in the range ofδC 110–120 ppm,δH 6.5–7.0 ppm (Lahive et al., 2016). Therefore, it indicated that under catalytic hydrotreatment conditions, the interunit linkages of lignin have been cleaved to obtain high-value aromatic alcohols."
9,Effect of the catalyst on the gaseous product component,"3.3 Effect of the catalyst on the gaseous product component The gas yields of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 for these experiments were also presented (Fig. 5). Overall, the gas content of catalysts increased gradually with the addition of Ni and/or Re catalyst. The highest productivity of CO2 and CH4 was obtained in the presence of 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5, which suggested that the synergistic effect of Ni-Re alloy structure would boost the direct decarboxylation and demethanization reaction. Besides, the abundance of CO2 and CH4 was also accompanied by the increase of aromatic alcohols in the monomer product. Kumar et al. performed the catalytic hydropyrolysis of kraft lignin using supported NiMo and CoMo catalysts. Major amounts of carbon-containing gases were produced in the process of forming mono-oxygenated aromatics (Kumar et al., 2015). In addition, the higher content hydrogen was obtained over 5Ni-5Re supported on other supports, which proved that ethanol had the good transfer hydrogenation properties. Evidently, the maximum H2 yield (82.67 mmol) was observed over 5Ni-5Re/SiO2. Instead, higher hydrogen content also led to extreme hydrogenation of aromatic rings, which was not efficient to the acquisition of aromatic alcohols. The similar results was also confirmed by Luo during catalytic depolymerization of kraft lignin with in-situ H2 .They also found that the correspondence was established between H2 content and liquid product distribution (Luo et al., 2018)."
10,"Effect of reaction temperature, time and solvent on the monomer yield.","3.4 Effect of reaction temperature, time and solvent on the monomer yield. The effect of reaction temperature on the lignin liquefaction and product distribution was depicted in Fig. 2 . It could be seen that the bio-oil and monomer yields as a function of the temperature. The oil yields increased from 85.73 wt% to 98.72 wt% over 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 when the temperature increased from 270 °C to 350 °C. Wherein, the amount of overall monomer yield also sharply increased from 22.46 wt% to 36.82 wt%. The solid residue yield gradually declined when the temperature increased to 330 °C. The above phenomenon illustrated that the higher temperature was beneficial to the cleavage of the main ether bonds during the depolymerization process. However, the yield of char increased again with the continuous increase of reaction temperature. It indicated that higher temperature would accelerate the occurrence of repolymerization reaction. Barta et al. also clarified that the higher yield of char was gained along with the increase of reaction temperature (Barta et al., 2014). Moreover, it was found that the temperature also had an important effect on product distribution. Phenols were the main components of monomer products in the lower temperature, which indicated that the increased temperature accelerated the conversion of lignin oligomers to the oxygenated aromatics monomers (mainly guaiacols and alkylphenolics). Then, the maximum yield of aromatic alcohols was obtained at 330 °C, presumably indicating that the cleavage of methoxy and hydroxyl groups mostly occurred in the present condition. Particularly, 1.23 wt% cycloalkane yield appeared when temperature reached 350 °C, which may be a secondary product from the hydrodeoxygenation reaction of aromatics alcohols. The effect of different reaction time on liquid product yield was manipulated under the optimal reaction temperature. As shown in Fig. 3 , the conversion of lignin and monomer yield gradually increased with the extension of reaction time. Meanwhile, the solid residue yield decreased from 1 h to 3 h in turn. These results demonstrated that the reaction time was also a positive factor for the depolymerization of kraft lignin, especially for the production of aromatic monomer. However, the liquid yield tended to decrease slightly after 4 h, indicating that some liquefied lignin products were condensed to solid residues and some were converted into gaseous product. On the other hand, it was also founded that the yield of char increased slightly from 2.38 wt% to 7.23 wt% after 3 h, it could be attributed to the repolymerization reaction of the lignin under long reaction time. Besides, reaction time also influenced the distribution of various monomers. In particular, the yields of aromatics monomer became dominant with the reaction time prolonging, meaning that the phenolic monomers were gradually converted to aromatic alcohols. Fortunately, the important intermediates, such as cyclic alcohols, still were not detected after 5 h of reaction, which proved that 5Ni-5Re alloy catalyst had good performance in inhibiting benzene hydrogenation. However, the yields of chain compounds raised slightly, which could be attributed to the reaction between ethanol and active side-chains of lignin fragments (McVeigh et al., 2016). Except for the reaction temperature and time, solvent system also had a significant influence on product yield for hydrogenolysis process (Fig. 4 ). The monomer yield of 23.59 wt%, 28.18 wt% and 29.51 wt% was achieved in methanol, n-propanol and isopropanol solvents, respectively. The maximum monomer yield was obtained in ethanol with higher lignin conversion and less char. Similar results were also observed that ethanol exhibited the best performance in the deoxygenation of guaiacol, it was likely due to its superior hydrogen donor capacity and strong polarity (Ma et al., 2015). In addition, the composition of liquid products was also significantly different in various solvents. More concretely, methoxyl-substituted phenolic compounds were the main components of liquid product in methanol system, confirming that the reaction system lacked the adequate hydrogen transfer ability. Comparatively, most lignin was converted into aromatic alcohols instead of phenolic compounds in n-propanol solvent. It was revealed that the enhanced removal of methoxy/hydroxyl groups was existed in the lignin hydrogenolysis process. Unfortunately, the 10.09 wt% yield of chain compounds was appeared in the monomer product, meaning that n-propanol could react with intermediate to form higher alcohols and esters. Huang et al. also reported that the Guerbet-type reaction between aldehydes and alcohols was occurred over Cu-based catalysts (Huang et al., 2015c). Moreover, a small amount of cyclic alcohols/ketones and cycloalkanes appeared in isopropanol solvent. It was speculated that aromatic ring hydrogenation phenomenon was existed in the hydrogen-rich system. The maximum yield of aromatic alcohols was observed in ethanol solvent, which further affirmed that the appropriate ability of hydrogen production could facilitate the transformation of phenolic monomers to aromatic products Fig. 5 ."
11,Conclusions,"The efficient catalytic conversion of kraft lignin into aromatic monomers was achieved in ethanol solvent. The highest oil yields (96.70 wt%) and monomer yields (35.41 wt%) were obtained over 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst, which was mainly consisted of aromatic alcohols without aromatic ring hydrogenation. The results showed that the 5Ni-5Re/Nb2O5 catalyst with appropriate acid sites and oxophilicity facilitated the selective cleavage of the crucial C-O bonds in lignin-derived phenolic compounds. Besides, reaction conditions, such as temperature, time and solvent, also played an important role in lignin alcoholysis process. Ethanol was found to be more potential for the valorization of lignin into aromatic chemicals."
