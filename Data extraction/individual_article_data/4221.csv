0,Introduction,"Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis has been an effective technique to produce valuable products from syngas since its discovery in the 1920s. Although it is mostly used to produce hydrocarbon fuels, other products such as oxygenates can also be synthesised, which represents an attractive product class of the F-T synthesis. Methanol has been successfully produced through this route on a large scale [1]. However, there has been intensive research focused on shifting the synthesis away from methanol and toward higher alcohols over the past three decades [1–11]. Higher alcohols are used in a large array of applications, such as alternative fuels, fuel additives and raw materials in industry or intermediates for value added chemicals. Over the past few decades, much work has been done to develop the F-T process for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS), via catalysts development [2,3]. Different types of catalysts with a wide range of metal atoms have been studied, such as modified methanol synthesis catalysts (usually based on Cu, Zn, Cr and Al metals) [4,5], modified F-T synthesis catalysts (Co, Fe and Ni based catalysts) [6,7], molybdenum based catalysts [8,9] and rhodium based catalysts [10,11]. The reported research results in the literature show that some selected metals, such as Co, Cu, Ni, Rh and Mo, are active catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis. However, to date, the higher alcohol (C2+ alcohols) yields are still too low for commercial application. A highly selective catalyst towards C2+ alcohols is thus essential for the success of the HAS process. Cobalt is the most common active centre used for higher alcohol formation from syngas [1]. It has been reported that Co mono-metal catalysts have lower C2+ alcohol selectivity than Co-containing bimetal catalysts [12–14]. However, based on the existing literature, it is impossible to make a solid conclusion about the controlling factors for higher alcohol selectivity using Co-based catalysts. Recent research suggests that not only the type of metal atom but also the crystal structure of the catalyst precursor, the distribution of the active centres and the synergy between Co and other metal atoms are all playing a role in the product selectivity in HAS [15,16]. Recently, perovskite oxides with an ABO3 type structure (e.g. LaCoO3) have been studied for HAS, owing to their flexibility in catalyst design and preparation [17–19]. In the perovskite structure, A and B site ions can be partly substituted by other elements easily, resulting in numerous derived perovskite structures having physical and chemical properties that can be tailored for purpose. For perovskite structure catalysts, F-T metals such as Cu and Fe are often used as B site atoms in order to improve the C2+OH selectivity in F-T synthesis. Tien-Thao et al. reported that Co-Cu bimetal active centres from perovskite catalyst precursors have high catalytic activities for HAS as the perovskite structure leads to good dispersion of the active centres on the catalyst surface [15,20,21]. Liu and co-workers reported that LaFeO3 perovskite catalysts with Co-Cu alloy exhibited good catalyst activity and selectivity towards higher alcohols from syngas conversion [16,22]. The transition metal nickel is well known as an active catalyst for methane formation from syngas [9,23]. However, if Ni is used as a promoter, then the catalyst becomes more active and higher alcohol selectivity increases significantly. Li et al. found that Ni is an effective promoter for K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst and enhances higher alcohol production [24–26]. Recent research on Ni-containing catalysts such as Cu-Mn-Ni, K-Ni-MoS2 and Ni-Cu/CeO2 suggested that nickel had the potential to promote higher alcohol synthesis due to the strong ability for CO insertion and therefore promoting carbon chain growth [9,27,28]. In addition, Rytter et al. identified Ni as a suitable replacement for rhenium (Re) in their Co-based catalyst for the F-T synthesis process [29]. They reported that the presence of Ni had a positive impact on the catalytic activity and deactivation rate. Since then Co-Ni bimetallic catalysts have been investigated intensively for the F-T process [23,30,31]. It should be noted that the catalysts used in these studies were prepared by the impregnation method. However, the drawbacks of this method could not be ignored, that is, the difficulty in controlling the active components distribution [32]. Several authors, amongst them, Shimura and co-workers, have found that the impregnation sequence also plays a role in the catalytic activity [23]. To overcome the mentioned uncertainties of Co-Ni catalyst preparation, the nickel-substituted La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskite catalysts were used in this study as the perovskite structure has high metallic dispersion when they undergo reduction [15,33]. Furthermore, it is the consensus in publications that the close vicinity and electronic interaction between Co3+ and Ni3+ sites in the perovskite lattice make it possible to create active centres after reduction [34]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature for higher alcohol formation from syngas over Co-Ni bimetal catalyst. In a previous study, the authors found that low level substitution of strontium at the A site of the LaCoO3 perovskite increased the syngas conversion due to the improvement in reducibility and dispersion of the Co0 active centres on the catalyst surface, but no effect on higher alcohol selectivity was noticed [19]. The aim of the present work is to further study the effect of Ni substitution over La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts on their catalytic activity in higher alcohol formation from syngas."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1) perovskite-type oxides was prepared by the co-precipitation method, as detailed elsewhere [19]. La(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%), Sr(NO3)2 (99%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98%) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (98.5%), obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, were used as reagents and ammonia water (35% mass fraction, Aldrich) was used as a precipitation agent. The metal precursors were weighed in stoichiometric proportions and dissolved in distilled water. Ammonia water was added to the aqueous solution dropwise under vigorous stirring until a pH of 9 was reached. The precipitate was then dried at 120°C overnight. In order to obtain the perovskite structure, the dried material was then calcined in flowing air at 350°C for 3h and then heated to 800°C, and maintained at this temperature for 5h [19]."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation The catalysts used in this work were characterised using the same methods and instruments detailed in our previous paper [19]. In short, the methods used are summarised below. The specific surface area (SSA) of the catalysts was measured at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micro Tristar II apparatus using the BET method. The samples were degassed by evacuation at 250°C for 12h prior to N2 adsorption measurement. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Co Kα radiation (λ=1.78897nm). The spectra were obtained between the 2θ ranges of 10 to 90° at a scanning speed of 1°/min for as-prepared catalysts and 5°/min for catalysts after the reduction and reaction. All catalyst samples (before and after used) were not treated prior to the XRD analyses. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed using a ChemBET 3000 equipment. Prior to the TPR experiments, the adsorbed impurities on the samples (ca. 0.1g) were removed at 300°C for 1h under a flow of nitrogen. After being cooled down to room temperature, the sample was reduced with a 5% H2/N2 gas mixture at a total flow of 20ml/min. The temperature was increased at 5°C/min from room temperature to 800°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Zeiss NEON 40EsB focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope, with an acceleration voltage of 10kV."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The F-T catalytic reactions were performed in a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor (Spider 3F-T instrument, AMTech, Germany), as shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was made up of Inconel tube of 200mm length and 127mm external diameter. 0.5 gram of catalyst, diluted with 1.5 gram γ-alumina (pellet size: 53–105 um, pre-calcined at 500°C), were used in each test. The reaction pressure was controlled using a back pressure controller. Catalysts were reduced in situ under flowing 20 vol% of H2/N2 (100ml/min) before each reaction test. For the reduction, the temperature was increased at 1°C/min from room temperature to 450°C and maintained overnight. Then, the reactor was cooled down to the reaction temperature while pressure was increased to 3.0MPa by feeding nitrogen gas before switching to the reaction mixture. A mixture of syngas (H2/CO=2:1) with 50% nitrogen dilution was supplied via individual mass flow controllers at the required gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The products were analysed directly using an online GC/MS (Agilent 7890/5977) and the temperature of the transfer lines between the reactor and the valves was kept at 200°C in order to avoid any product condensation. The GC/MS was equipped with two columns and two detectors. Carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and methane were separated using a packed column (TDX-01 column) connected to the TCD detector. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of all organic products was carried out using an MS HP-5 column connected to the mass spectrometer. The experiments were carried out for 24h and the data obtained from each experiment were the average of measurements over the steady-state period (minimum 18h). A blank test using γ-alumina was carried out, and no reaction was detected at the conditions used in this work."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation 3.1.1 Specific surface area (BET) The specific surface area (S BET) of the prepared La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts are summarised in Table 1 . The surface areas of the La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts were between 4 and 7 m2/g, lower than that reported by Valderrama et al. for La-Sr-Co-Ni-O based perovskite catalysts (6–15 m2/g) which were calcined at 750°C [33]. The relatively low surface areas of the perovskite catalysts are related to the preparation method since the catalysts were calcined at a high temperature (800°C), which might induce the sintering of the solids. Because the surface area changed by very small increments with Ni substitution, it is expected that the catalytic activity was not affected by the S BET. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 2 presents the powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared perovskite catalysts (before reduction). These results show all La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts exhibited the perovskite structure for the different substitution levels of Ni (x), as shown by the presence of the typical perovskite diffraction peaks between 38° and 40° [35,36]. In addition, La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite diffraction peak at 38–39° in Fig.2B gradually shifted to lower 2θ with increasing nickel substitution since the ionic radius of Ni3+ (0.56 Å) is higher than Co3+ (0.52 Å), which indicates that nickel ions have entered into the perovskite structure. In Fig.2C, small fractions of Co3O4 (JCPDS-ICDD 80-1541) were found in the lower Ni-substituted catalysts (x=0 and x=0.1), while NiO (JCPDS-ICDD 47-1049) was present in the catalyst without Co (x=1). These secondary phases were also observed by other authors [36]. It is noteworthy that the Co-Ni oxide phase (JCPDS-ICDD 03-0995) was detected at 43.3° for the Ni-substituted perovskite catalyst with x=0.5. This peak was between the diffraction lines of Co3O4 and NiO, indicating that nickel oxide and cobalt oxide were also potentially present in this catalyst. Due to the close position of diffraction peaks and similarity in structure between Co3O4, NiO and Ni-Co oxide, distinguishing between these three phases is very difficult [30]. The secondary phases Ni-Co oxide and possibly NiO present in the catalyst with x=0.5 suggests that only a limited amount of Ni atoms could enter the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskite structure. To investigate the phase changes of the prepared perovskite catalysts after reduction, the samples were reduced at 450°C in 5% H2/N2 for 1h before XRD analysis. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3 . Upon reduction at 450°C, the perovskite structure of catalyst x=0 and x=1 was preserved, with the main diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈38–39° still present on the spectra, although broader, suggesting a partial collapse of the crystalline structure (see Fig.3B). However, the perovskite structure of Ni-substituted catalysts (x=0.1 and 0.5) collapsed after reduction (disappearance of the 2θ ≈38–39° peaks). In parallel, new phases such as La2SrOx (JCPDS-ICDD 42-0343) and La2O3 (JCPDS-ICDD 74-2430) were observed. After reduction at 450°C, the Co0 diffraction peak (2θ =51.83°) was barely visible for perovskite catalyst x=0 due to the high stability of La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 catalyst and the good dispersion of the Co0 species [19]. For catalysts with x=0.1 and 0.5, the small diffraction peak located between 51.38° and 52.16° showed that Co-Ni alloy was formed during the reduction. This is in agreement with the results of Gallego et al. who reported that the partial reduction of LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 perovskite catalyst produced a Co-Ni alloy [34]. The weak diffraction peak of the Co-Ni alloy for the catalyst with x=0.1 suggests the formation of a highly dispersed bimetallic alloy on the catalyst surface [37]. In particular, the diffraction peak of the Co-Ni alloy was nearing the peak of metallic Ni with the increase in Ni substitution as shown in Fig.3C, suggesting that certain amount of metallic Ni was also formed after reduction. Taking the presence of small amount of Ni-containing oxides (Fig.2C) into account, it is reasonable to assume that such phase was reduced to form Ni0 at lower temperatures, as suggested by Silva et al. [36] and Pereñíguez et al. [38]. Furthermore, the Ni0 diffraction peaks could be clearly observed in the catalyst with x=1, indicating that La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 perovskite has less thermal resistance under reducing atmosphere compared to La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 catalyst. The metallic cobalt and nickel species, as well as Co-Ni alloy formed during the reduction of the La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts would be considered as the active centres for CO hydrogenation in this study. The used catalysts after 24h reaction were also analysed by XRD and the results are given in Fig. 4 . The diffraction peaks of the perovskite structure have disappeared in all the used catalysts after the F-T reaction (Fig.4B). For the un-substituted catalyst (x=0), Co0 and LaCO3OH (JCPDS-ICDD 26-0815) were formed during the reaction, in accordance with our previous study [19]. As described in the catalyst characterisation part, the used catalyst samples were not treated prior to the XRD analyses. As a consequence, the effects of impurities (by-products) on the surface of the catalyst prevented the detection of the Co-Ni alloy phase at the expected 2θ value for Ni-substituted catalysts (x=0.1 and 0.5) in Fig.4C [39]. Slightly phase separation of the Co-Ni alloy to form Co0 and Ni0 atom may be an additional effect to the 2θ drifting. Compared to catalyst x=0.1, the peak intensity for catalyst x=0.5 increased significantly and the 2θ value of peak further shifted to 52.16°, which was closer to the metallic Ni diffraction line. This new peak was associated with the reduction of the extra-framework Ni-containing oxide shown in Fig. 2. In addition, La2SrOx is believed to transform into LaCO3OH and SrO during the reaction over the catalyst x=0.1 and 0.5. Although the SrO phase was not detected by XRD, possibly due to its low concentration and high dispersion, out of the detection limits of the XRD analysis, its formation cannot be discarded [33]. For catalyst with x=1, the Ni0 phase was clearly observed, together with the formation of La2O2CO3 (JCPDS-ICDD 22-0642). It has been reported by Maluf et al. that the combination of Sr and Ni in La1−ySryCo1−xNixO3 perovskite structure enhanced the water gas shift reaction (WGS) [40]. As a result, the produced water from CO hydrogenation with the La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 catalyst will react preferably with CO to form CO2 and then form La2O2CO3, rather than with La2SrOx to form LaCO3OH. 3.1.3 TPR The H2-TPR profiles of La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskites are displayed in Fig. 5 (left). All the TPR peaks can be ascribed to the reduction of Co3+ and Ni3+, since La3+ and Sr2+ are not reduced under such experimental conditions [33,35]. For La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskite, the reduction process took place in two steps: Co3+ was first reduced to Co2+ at temperatures between 300 and 500°C, while reduction peaks at higher temperatures (500–700°C) correspond to the formation of Co0. The first two peaks at lower temperatures (300–500°C) were caused by the reduction of different Co species, with some reduced to Co0 in one step [41]. La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 perovskite also presented the two-step reduction: the first one, at about 370°C, corresponding to the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+, and the second step at 520°C leading to Ni0 formation [35]. Compared to La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 perovskite, the higher temperature required for Co species in the reducing atmosphere is consistent with the higher stability of the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskite (see Fig.3B). For Ni-substituted perovskite catalysts (x=0.1 and 0.5), the first two reduction peaks overlapped at low temperatures (300–450°C), and were attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and Ni3+ to Ni2+. The peak at higher temperatures (450–550°C) was ascribed to the complete reduction of the B site elements (Co and Ni). With nickel substitution, all reduction peaks were shifted to lower temperatures. It is reasonable to deduce that the intimate metal-metal interaction between Co and Ni ions in the Co-Ni alloy was responsible for the improvement of the catalyst reducibility. This agrees with the XRD results shown in Fig.3B that the perovskite structure of the catalyst x=0.1 and 0.5 collapsed after partial reduction, but not for catalyst x=0 and 1. Furthermore, a new broad reduction peak at 200°C was also observed for the catalyst with x=0.5, which came from the reduction of the extra-framework Ni-containing oxide [42]. These observations are in agreement with the XRD analysis, suggesting that the substitution of Ni in the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskite structure improves the reduction of the catalysts and increasing nickel level above 0.5 will lead to a separation of extra-framework Ni-containing oxide [23,40,43]. In order to compare the reduction ability of the catalysts, the total H2-TPR peak areas were measured and are presented in Fig. 5 (right). It is well known that the more hydrogen is consumed, the more metal oxides are reduced and more active centres for F-T reaction are formed. The results in Fig. 5 (right) demonstrate that the nickel-substituted La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts consumed a similar amount of hydrogen compared to La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 while La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 catalyst consumed about a third less. This suggests that all nickel-substituted La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts have a similar number of reduced metal atoms, which are expected to be active for the conversion of CO in F-T synthesis [23]. The lower amount of hydrogen consumption for La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 perovskite may come from the sintering of metallic Ni, as shown in the XRD analysis (Figs. 3C and 4C). Nickel sintering in Co-based catalysts is known to take place, as reported by Frusteri et al., who showed that compared with Co/MgO catalyst, Ni-contained Co/MgO catalyst activity was affected by Ni metal sintering and exhibited significantly change of mean particle size during steam reforming of ethanol [44]. 3.1.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM micrographs of the fresh and used La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts with different Ni substitution levels are shown in Fig. 6 . Similar morphologies are observed for all fresh catalysts used in this work as shown in Fig. 6 (left). The dominant morphologies are polyhedral grains, with an inhomogeneous size distribution from 100 to 200nm. This indicates that cobalt substitution with nickel does not affect the perovskite morphology. Furthermore, the SEM analyses show no significant variations in the morphologies of La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts after reaction (Fig. 6, right). The particles of La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 were prone to aggregation, forming irregular lumps, and the main particle size slightly increased to 100–300nm, as a result of sintering."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Catalyst activity The Ni-substituted perovskites have been tested as catalysts for higher alcohol formation from syngas. The CO and H2 conversion rates at 275°C for the investigated catalysts are given in Fig. 7 . The results show that the catalyst activity changed significantly with the Ni substitution. Among the La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskites, the bimetallic Co-Ni catalysts with x=0.1 and 0.5 displayed a CO conversion about 5 to 7 times higher than the monometallic B site perovskites (x=0 and 1 respectively). Interestingly, the TPR results suggested that the bimetallic catalysts had a similar number of active centres as La0.9Sr0.1CoO3. Compared with the Ni-substituted catalysts, the lower CO conversion observed for the un-substituted La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 catalyst could in part be due to the absence of the active Co-Ni bimetal, as the XRD analysis results of the reduced catalyst showed (Fig. 3). These results confirm that Ni substitution improves the catalytic activity of La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 via the formation of bi-metallic Co-Ni active centres. The TPR results of the La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 catalyst showed a low H2 consumption level. This means that less active metallic Ni was formed than expected, as explained above. As a consequence, the catalyst displayed a low CO conversion. In order to explain the catalytic activity results, an estimation of the turnover frequency (TOF, defined as moles of CO converted per mole of active centre per second) was performed. Due to the difficulty of determining the number of active centres (Co0, Ni0 and Co-Ni alloy) of the catalysts during the reaction, two sets of assumptions were made for the TOF calculation. In the first set of assumptions, the “Co-Ni bi-metal” curve in Fig. 8 (black plot) was calculated based on the hypotheses that (1) all substituted Ni atoms form bimetallic Co-Ni centres and (2) the excess cobalt formed Co0 active centres and all metal sites are accessible to the regent gases. Based on this first set of assumptions, the results show that the TOF value increased with increasing Ni substitution until x=0.5, thus suggesting that the Co-Ni alloy centres have a much higher activity, as the higher the Ni substitution level, the lower the theoretical number of active centre. However, it is realistic to presume that in this set of simplified assumptions, a certain amount of metallic Co0 and Ni0 active centres do exist, thus affecting the real number of active centres. In order to overcome this uncertainty, the TOF was recalculated with a second set of assumptions, based on the postulations that all B metal sites in the perovskites form separate mono metal active centres (Co0 and Ni0) after reduction, thus the total number of active centres in each catalyst is very similar due to the close molecular weight of cobalt and nickel. The “separate mono-metal” TOF curve is plotted in Fig. 8 (red plot) and shows the same trend as the “Co-Ni bi-metal” curve. These selected calculations are based on two extreme and simplified assumptions, and the real TOF for Ni-substituted catalysts would be somewhat in between the two curves. However, the results confirm that Ni substitution improved the catalytic activity of La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts with the formation of Co-Ni bimetal active centres for CO conversion. The results in this work are supported by the reported finding in the literature showing the alloying of Co with Ni strengthened the activity of SiO2 supported Co-Ni bi-metal catalysts for hydrogen dissociative adsorption, resulting in a higher catalytic activity in CO hydrogenation [31]. 3.2.2 Alcohol selectivity and yield This work was focused on the total alcohol formation and higher alcohol distribution, the selectivity of other products was excluded from this study. Fig. 9 presents the selectivity and yield of alcohol products from syngas conversion against nickel content in the La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts. Within the experimental time frame of 24h, the change of alcohol selectivity cannot be detected. Fig.9A shows the significant effect of nickel substitution on shifting methanol production towards higher alcohols. At Ni substitution level of 0.1, the amount of methanol decreased significantly to 30.1%, half of the selectivity compared to the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 catalyst (60.5%), and the main alcohol product was ethanol. In Fig.9B, the space time yield (STY) of total alcohols were 27.5mggcat −1 h−1 and 15mggcat −1 h−1 for the catalyst with x=0.1 and x=0.5, respectively, compared to 4.9mggcat −1 h−1 for the catalyst without Ni. This suggests that the synergistic effect of the Co-Ni alloy plays a significant role in alcohol production and CO insertion to promote higher alcohol formation [26,45]. However, compared to x=0.1, the alcohol product distribution and higher alcohol yield decreased for catalyst with x=0.5, suggesting that the intra- and extra-perovskite lattice nickel atoms play different roles in higher alcohol synthesis. With a high level of Ni substitution (x=0.5), only part of the nickel atoms entered into the perovskite structure and the rest was in oxide form that reduced to Ni0 during the reduction process and was present outside the perovskite framework (see Fig. 3). As discussed thoroughly in the literature, Ni is a good catalyst for methanation because of its strong ability for hydrogenation [23]. When exposed to syngas, the CO methanation reaction rate over metallic Ni species is faster than that of the alcohols synthesis [46]. Thus, as expected, CH4 selectivity increased significantly with increasing Ni substitution level as showed in Fig.9C. Fig.9D provides evidence of the ability of Ni substitution in La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts for carbon chain propagation. For catalysts with x=0.1 and 0.5, the ratio of C2OH/C1OH, C3OH/C1OH and C4+OH/C1OH were much higher than that for the un-substituted catalysts (x=0 and 1). This observation is in accordance with the above discussion, indicating that the bi-metal Co-Ni catalyst favours higher alcohol formation. It should be noted that the maximum C2OH/C1OH ratio was achieved for the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 catalyst (ratio of 1.24). The Anderson-Schultz-Flory (ASF) distribution is commonly used to investigate the chain growth mechanism of products, including alcohols (C1OH-C5OH) in the F-T process [7,15,20,25,26,28]. Two different types of ASF plots for alcohol formation over nickel-substituted La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts were obtained (Fig. 10 ). The results in Fig. 10 show that the chain propagation of alcohol products over the B site mono-metal catalysts, La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 (x=0) and La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 (x=1), agrees with the traditional linear ASF distribution. This indicates that higher alcohol formation over these catalysts followed one mechanism. For Ni substituted La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 catalysts (x=0.1 and 0.5), a deviation was observed for methanol in the ASF plots, suggesting the higher alcohol formation route over these two catalysts followed different mechanism [28]. Except for methanol, the points for higher alcohols (C2OH-C5OH) still followed the ASF linear distribution. The chain growth probability (α) for catalyst with x=0.1 and 0.5 at 275°C were calculated using the slope of the straight line for the higher alcohols (methanol excluded), with values of 0.21 and 0.15 respectively. These are higher than that of the mono-B site catalysts (x=0 and 1) at 0.14 and 0.04, respectively. Therefore, confirming the previous selectivity results (see Fig.9D), it is reasonable to claim that Ni substitution, and the presence of a bimetal Co-Ni alloy in the catalyst exerted an effective impact on the chain propagation to produce higher alcohols, especially for the growth of C1 to C2. Similar results were observed by Li et al. when studying higher alcohol formation in F-T process over Ni modified K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst [25]. As mentioned before, cobalt favours the dissociation of CO, thereby promoting the chain growth of hydrocarbons [47], while Ni-based catalysts have a strong ability for CO insertion, favouring higher alcohol formation [48]. For low Ni substitution catalyst (x=0.1), the Co-Ni alloy exerted the bi-functionality, namely, the formation of the hyrdocarbon precursor by chain propagation and the succeeding CO insertion under hydrogenation conditions [26]. However, with the increase of Ni substitution, the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.5Ni0.5O3 catalyst had a lower α value compared to that of the catalyst with x=0.1. The presence of extra-lattice nickel species was favorable to the formation of methane, which exhibited a much faster formation rate than that of alcohols. Without the synergism of the Co-Ni alloy, the catalyst x=1 exhibited a much lower α value than other catalysts due to its high methanation ability [9]. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction temperature on higher alcohols formation To provide further insights into the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 catalyst, the effect of reaction temperature on the synthesis of higher alcohols was investigated. The reactions were carried out in the range of 275–340°C under 3.0MPa, GHSV=10995h−1 and H2/CO=2. The measured alcohol space time yields are given in Fig. 11 . With increasing reaction temperature, the STY of methanol tends to decrease after a maximum at 310°C, while the STY for C2OH, C3OH and C4+OH showed a maximum at 320°C, with a total C2+OH STY of 48.9mggcat −1 h−1. It is well known that the CO adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surface strongly depends on the reaction temperature [20], with CO adsorption inversely proportional to temperature. This reduces the alcohol yield at temperature above 320°C. Besides, the methanation and water gas shift reaction become fairly predominant at higher temperatures [21]. The WGS reaction would lead to change in the H2/CO ratio and contribute to the decrease in CO insertion and C–C chain growth [49]. The phase separation of the Co-Ni alloy may also be an additional cause for the decrease of alcohol STY in the high temperature range (see Fig. 4). The same process conditions for higher alcohol synthesis via the F-T process do not exist in the literature for direct comparison to this work. However, some catalytic performances of other reported catalysts including cobalt and nickel elements for HAS are summarised in Table 2 . As expected, different kinds of catalysts and reaction conditions led to different alcohol yields. Taking the catalyst activity and reaction conditions into consideration, the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 perovskite catalyst prepared in this study reached a high level of CO conversion and higher alcohol selectivity (weight fraction) compared to other catalysts."
8,Conclusions,"Ni-substituted La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts were successfully synthesised by the co-precipitation method. The partial substitution of Ni in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 perovskites promoted the reducibility and had a positive effect on higher alcohol product selectivity in the F-T process. The interactions between the nickel and cobalt in the perovskite structure generated Co-Ni alloy after reduction, and the synergistic effect between Co and Ni was responsible for the improvement in higher alcohol selectivity. With higher Ni substitution levels, metallic Ni also formed and existed outside of the perovskite framework. In particular, due to the highly dispersed bimetallic Co-Ni alloy and less extra-lattice Ni0 phase, the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 catalyst showed the highest selectivity to higher alcohols formation. The higher alcohol yield with the La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 catalyst increased with increasing reaction temperatures within the range of 275°C and 320°C, then decreased at higher temperature. The use of a catalyst support and/or promoters are promising methods to enhance the catalyst activity and reduce the amount of side products (including methane) and production cost. The effect of support on Co-Ni perovskite catalyst performance for HAS from syngas will be investigated in future work, as a way to enhance the catalysts’ surface area, and thus their activity."
