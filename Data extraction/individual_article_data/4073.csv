0,Introduction,"Incredible development on the rapid growth of chemical industries over the past few decades have though enhanced material living standards and life expectancy but contradictorily also have duly taken a huge toll on the environment. Especially, the burgeoning pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries all over the world have been witnessing the use of large quantities of organic solvents, homogeneous catalysts such as harsh acids and halogenating agents that generate significant quantities of toxic waste effluent streams (Shehada et al., 2016) as well as aid to the degrading air quality owing to high solvent losses (Clarke et al., 2018). Further, utilization of such non-renewable and hazardous reagents is not only unfavorable to the environment but also pose threat of perpetual damage to the reactors and plant accessories which grossly increase the maintenance costs exemplifying high order of process unsustainability. Nonetheless, solvents and catalysts are indispensable for most chemical processes to proceed forward as solvation improvises the chemical reactions through increased yields, selectivity, safety and ease of operations (Buncel et al., 2003) which calls for development of their environment benign alternatives. Esterification is one such ubiquitous equilibrium limited chemical reaction in pharmaceutical, polymer, perfumery, food and fine chemical industries that spectates extensive use of mineral acid catalysts and excessive solvents for product purifications (Yasmin et al., 2018) owing to the thermodynamic limitations. Specifically, organic esters with low molecular weights have distinct odors that find numerous applications in the food and perfumery industries as synthetic essences. These esters though occur naturally on earth but the extraction from its natural resources is hindered due to high process economics in commercial adaptation and are thus produced by Fischer esterification mechanism (Azudin et al., 2020). Isoamyl acetate (IAA) is an organic ester with a characteristic aroma of banana used abundantly as a flavoring agent in the production of fruit jellies, jams, punches and beverages (Zare et al., 2019). The conventional industrial production of IAA involves esterification of isoamyl alcohol with acetic acid using concentrated sulfuric acid as catalyst in stoichiometric quantities. Undoubtedly, this process poses several disadvantages such as high loading of toxic mineral acid, excess acidic spent liquor, corrosion of equipment, non-recyclability of catalyst and relatively poor yields (Li et al., 2012). Advances in catalytic system for intensified esterification reactions has been investigated over the past decade but most such reports defy industrial implementation or lack the complete sustainability assessments. In an attempt to mimic natural esters, the use of enzymes has been recently proposed by Zare et al., for the synthesis of IAA using the lipase, Novozyme 435 through microwave assisted esterification technique. Although the yields obtained were excellent, the scale up of microwave assisted operations is pretty naive and enzymatic catalysis exhibits several drawbacks like high sensitivity to thermal variations, higher end product price due to the use of costly enzymes and degradation under highly acidic conditions (Azudin et al., 2020; Siong et al., 2014). Further, the esterification of isoamyl alcohol has been explored using a macro porous ion exchange resin (TULSION T-63, MP) with only 89.6% conversion (Patil and Kulkarni, 2014). However, due to early catalyst deactivation the recycle studies could only be performed for two cycles with significant decrease in product yields making the overall process ineffective commercially. Also, transesterification-based IAA preparation was investigated using Microporous H-ZSM-5 zeolite (Corregidor et al., 2020) wherein a maximum of 58% selectivity could be obtained towards IAA but the presence of byproducts caused difficulty in product isolation. This seeks for neoteric catalysts that are not only high performing and cost efficient but also environmentally sustainable. Alternatively, diverging deeper into greener production routes, ionic liquids (ILs) has emerged as potential catalysts for several chemical reactions primarily owing to its unique and designable physico-chemical properties (Keogh et al., 2019; Li et al., 2007; Gupta et al., 2007). Moreover, an acidic IL namely 1-Octyl-3 methyl imidazolium hydrogen sulphate was adopted by Li et al., as a green catalyst for the esterification of isoamyl alcohol through reactive distillation strategy with 85% overall yield. Nevertheless, the commercial applicability of ILs is hindered due to its intricate production routes, excessive dosing requirement, increased viscosity and recovery complications (Kumar et al., 2016) together with corrosivity and extremely high cost (Zeng et al., 2017). Additionally, the biodegradability of ILs is still questionable with recent studies suggesting it to be posing significant hazard to humans as well as the environment (Flieger and Flieger, 2020). Notably, low transition temperature mixtures (LTTMs) have attracted the latest limelight as analogue to ILs with all the desirable properties of ILs such as wide liquid range, negligible vapor pressure and non-flammability but overcome the shortcomings of ILs with low viscosity, ease of synthesis and complete biodegradability (De et al., 2021; Soylak, and Uzcan, 2020). The LTTMs also known as deep eutectic solvents (DES) are composed of cheap and abundantly available hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) molecules occurring naturally (De et al., 2019b). These low cost and biodegradable eutectic mixtures have been witnessed as eco-friendly and economic replacement for various toxic reagents in electrochemical applications (Abbott et al., 2009), extractive distillation (De et al., 2019b), micro analyte extraction (Makoś et al., 2020), biomass valorization (De et al., 2021) and catalytic reactions such as esterification, acetylation, oxidation etc (Ni et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). Especially, for various esterification reactions the LTTMs have emerged as budding designer catalysts wherein it could significantly contribute towards the increase of catalytic efficiency, enhanced solvation, reduced effluents and high catalyst recyclability. Qin et al., recently reported the applicability of imidazole based eutectic solvents with bifunctional effect as solvent and catalyst for the synthesis of dioctyl phthalate, a widely used plasticizer. Also, a natural DES composed of caffeic acid and choline chloride have been used as a green reaction media in the production of lipophilic caffeoyl ester with satisfactory yields (Wang et al., 2020). Similarly, the formation of wax esters was investigated by Sunitha et al., 2007, using a Lewis acid LTTM in a biphasic solvent media which subsequently lowered the process economics. However, no such study yet has dedicatedly explored the applicability of LTTMs for the IAA production. Moreover, the adoption of such newer strategies to manufacture an industrially relevant chemical requires the process to be both economically promising as well as environmentally benign. Certainly, with the global demand for ecofriendly production routes and in order to make the ongoing research on DES based chemical reactions commercially accessible atleast by the next decade, the complete sustainability assessment of such processes is of utmost significance. Conventional parametric indicators for a chemical process such as yield, selectivity, process time and cost have witnessed a new paradigm of indicators accompanying them that are dictated by principles of process intensification in the viewpoint of green chemical engineering. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been established as a standardized strategy that satisfactorily quantifies the environmental impacts of a process in each and every stage of production, utilization and its disposal (Pini et al., 2015) through the total supply chain and product network (Smith et al., 2019). This enables the identification and comparison of potential effects on the environment for different chemical pathways in the production of a particular chemical. Further, researchers have proposed LCA as a potent method to predict the cumulative effect of a newly developed system as it holistically analyzes environmental impact, cost-effectiveness as well as energy utilization of a process which is beneficial for implementing environmental guidelines (Li et al., 2020). Further, the environmental profiling of chemicals conducted through the assessment of sustainability metrics such as environmental factor, atom economy and mass index assists the design of sustainable chemical processes (Wang et al., 2013). This research for the first time encapsulates a systematic sustainable process development protocol for industrially relevant chemicals through experimentation, optimization of process parameters, development of a suitable kinetic model for the reaction and establishing its efficiency with respect to the current industrial practices. Moreover, bibliographic retrieval indicates most of the relevant studies for development of a green process route either focus on the reaction optimization (Cao et al., 2016) or solely its sustainability assessment (Baaqel et al., 2020), which essentially does not dictate the correct choice of production route. In this purview, the present study explores the ecofriendly design and development of a synthetic banana flavoring, IAA production, using a neoteric class of catalysts known as LTTMs that portrays significant advancement from the conventional production route in terms of enhanced yields, environment compatibility, catalyst recyclability and reduced of toxic effluents. The intensified and sustainable preparation of IAA was performed using a Brønsted acid-based LTTM and compared with the traditional synthesis using toxic sulfuric acid as a catalyst. The dual role of the LTTM to efficiently catalyze the esterification reaction as well as assist the alteration in phase distribution of the reaction constituents for ease of product purification together with excellent recyclability of the reaction media was experimentally verified. Further, to aid in the realistic design, optimized process conditions were achieved by examining influence of the reaction parameters such as acid/alcohol molar ratio, LTTM dosage and time on the yield of IAA using response surface methodology accomplished via the Box-Behnken design. Subsequently, the reaction kinetics for the LTTM mediated isoamyl alcohol esterification was explored and a pseudo homogeneous model was developed to construe the viability of the developed process. Additionally, the LCA of the IAA production using the proposed environment friendly catalyst was executed and compared with the mineral acid based conventional scheme through a cradle to gate approach. The development of a greener production route was also verified by evaluation of established sustainability metrics for chemical production. Therefore, using a holistic approach a green design and environmental impact assessment of IAA production benchmarking the commercial process has been presented that would aid in the imminent scale-up and industrial exploitation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemical reagents,"2.1 Chemical reagents Isoamyl alcohol with a purity above 99% was procured from TCI Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., India while acetic acid, sulfuric acid, methanol, choline chloride, para-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, all of analytical grades were purchased from Avra Synthesis Pvt. Ltd., India. All the chemicals were used as such without any purification and stored in desiccators to prevent any moisture attack. Further, demineralized water used in the experimentation was prepared in the laboratory itself."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure 2.2.1 Preparation of LTTM The LTTM under present consideration is a eutectic solvent composed of a quaternary ammonium salt choline chloride (ChCl) and a Brønsted acid p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (pTSA) which are both abundantly available and derived from renewable resources. The LTTM preparation was conducted in accordance to our previous study (De et al., 2021) which involved the equimolar physical amalgamation of the selected HBD, pTSA and the HBA, ChCl which were measured accurately and stirred constantly in a reaction vessel at 80 °C until a homogeneous and clear liquid was obtained. The solution formed was brought to room temperature and stored in sealed glass vials for further use in the IAA production. The vials were stored in desiccator to prevent any moisture attack. 2.2.2 Esterification of isoamyl alcohol The isoamyl alcohol esterification was studied in a Radleys reactor-ready lab reactor which is an automated glass jacketed reactor operating in batch mode attached to a Huber Unistat Tango thermostat for an accurate temperature control of ±0.1 K as detected using the accompanying PT-100 temperature indicator probe inserted into the reactor. The four necked, 5L reactor vessel with a bottom drain valve was mounted with a Teflon make anchor type impeller for uniform homogenization of the reaction mixture equipped with a Heidolph digital overhead stirrer (Hei-TORQUE Precision 400) with a direct controller. Further, the reactor was furnished with a Dean-Stark apparatus attached to a coiled condenser which allowed constant collection of a reaction by product, through a continuous reactive distillation strategy. Likewise, a provision was made in the reactor for withdrawal of the liquid samples over the course of reaction at different time intervals to analyze the conversion of isoamyl alcohol as detected by gas chromatography (GC). A typical IAA production process included the precise measurement of the raw materials viz. isoamyl alcohol, acetic acid and catalyst in desired quantities and charged into the reactor. The reaction mixture was heated to 393 K under constant stirring at atmospheric pressure. As the reflux began and slowly the required temperature was attained, the time of reaction started. Interestingly, the reaction constituents have the ability to form a ternary heterogeneous azeotrope (Sánchez et al., 2020) between IAA, isoamyl alcohol and water that could be collected in the Dean-Stark funnel where the two phases separated. Gradually the bottom layer consisting primarily water was withdrawn and the top layer sent back to the reactor to proceed the reaction forward efficiently through continuous removal of the by-product, water from the system. After the designated reaction time was completed, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the product mixture was discharged. The present study exemplifies the use of a conventional mineral acid (H2SO4), a Brønsted acid (pTSA) and a LTTM (ChCl:pTSA) as catalysts for the production of IAA. Although the esterification reaction setup and procedure were same for all the three catalytic reactions, the downstream processing for isolation of IAA was slightly different depending on the catalyst used as portrayed in Fig. 1 . As evident, the LTTM mediated esterification displayed simpler isolation technique owing to phase splitting between the constituents that enabled recovery of the ester as a separate layer while the LTTM and unreacted acetic acid remained in the bottom layer that could be directly recycled for the subsequent cycles with necessary acetic acid make up. However, in case of the other two catalysts under consideration the product mixture was washed with water to separate the IAA as a distinct phase. The aqueous phase in case of sulfuric acid was highly corrosive and toxic that poses disposal hindrances whilst the aqueous pTSA layer was processed through concentration under vacuum followed by azeotropic distillation using cyclohexane as an entrainer to recover dried pTSA for the next reaction. The ester layer for all the experiments were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate till neutrality and brine solution followed by distillation under vacuum to obtain purified IAA as a synthetic banana flavoring. Each experiment were carried out in triplicate to ensure accuracy and precision of the obtained results. The final yield of IAA was evaluated on the basis of product obtained in hand using the following equation: (1) Y i e l d ( % ) = I A A T − I A A C I A A T × 100 wherein, I A A T is the theoretical weight of IAA to be obtained in accordance to the initial weight of isoamyl alcohol and I A A C is the final weight of IAA collected. All the esterification experiments have been replicated thrice for better reliability and a statistical analysis revealed the estimated standard deviation to be 0.22. The kinetic runs were performed at the optimized process conditions at different temperatures of 383 K, 388 K, 393 K and 398 K."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis The conversion of isoamyl alcohol was examined using Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 8890 GC systems) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID), and a ZB-5 capillary column (Agilent Technologies, USA) with 0.25 mm id, 30 m length and thickness 0.25 μm. The GC temperature program was initiated at 100 °C, ramped at 5 °C/min for 1 min followed by a ramp at 20 °C/min to 280 °C and held for 5 min. The injections were operated in split mode (10:1) with an injector temperature and detector temperature of 280 °C and 300 °C respectively. The flow rates of the carrier gases were 400 mL/min of air and hydrogen as well as nitrogen flow of 40 mL/min. The liquid samples from the reaction mixture at different time intervals were collected through a syringe and immediately quenched before analysis by diluting in methanol. Further, the final product moisture content was also determined using Karl-Fischer titrator (Metrohm 797) with a platinum electrode and ±0.05 ml accuracy."
5,Experimental design and modeling,
6,Response surface methodology,"3.1 Response surface methodology The esterification of isoamyl alcohol using a new class of catalysts, LTTM has been proposed for the first time in the present study and the optimization of the process conditions is crucial for a genuine design. Response surface methodology (RSM) is an effectual tool to perform systematic statistical experimental design that aids in the parametric optimization of a process (Gu et al., 2015). The mathematical optimization of the process parameters for IAA production using LTTM was designed through RSM in the DESIGN EXPERT software version 7.0 (Stat-Ease, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) using a three level and three factor Box-Behnken design. The key factors evaluated in the esterification experiments comprised of the acid/alcohol molar ratio (1–4), LTTM molar ratio (0.5–2) with respect to isoamyl alcohol and the reaction time (1–3 h) to study their effect on the isoamyl alcohol conversion. An appropriate numerical model was selected to fit the obtained experimental data and an extrapolative model was developed using multiple regression analysis (De et al., 2019a). The efficiency of the model fit was further validated statistically through the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the contribution of each factor for significantly effecting the response variable was investigated. Table S1 reports the design matrix and the responses for the 17 experimental runs including the 5 replicated center points."
7,Kinetic modelling,"3.2 Kinetic modelling The kinetics of an esterification reaction generally follows the second order reversible equilibrium regime and the Pseudo-homogeneous (PH) model is usually applied to decipher the kinetic performance of the reaction systems for strongly polar reaction media such as ILs or LTTMs (Tao et al., 2011) where the internal and external diffusion limitations are absent (Chin et al., 2015). The experimental kinetic data evaluated for the LTTM mediated IAA production was fitted to the PH kinetic model (Banchero and Gozzelino, 2018) as shown in equation (2): (2) − r A V = m L T T M ( k f C A C B − k b C C C D ) wherein, r A is the rate of the chosen reaction, V is the batch volume, m L T T M is the mass of the catalyst (LTTM), k f and k b are the forward and backward reaction rate constants and C A , C B , C C a n d C D are the concentrations of isoamyl alcohol, acetic acid, IAA and water respectively. Further, as determined from stoichiometry, the molar concentrations of the components can be correlated on the basis of initial isoamyl alcohol concentration ( C A O ) and conversion ( X A ) which results in C A = C A O ( 1 − X A ) , C B = C A O ( M − X A ) and C C = C D = C A O X A with M representing the acetic acid to isoamyl alcohol molar ratio that transforms equation (2) as follows: (3) d X A d t V = k f m L T T M C A O [ ( 1 − X A ) ( M − X A ) − 1 k e X A 2 ] Herein, the equilibrium rate constant, k e = k f k b which can be calculated assuming d X A d t = 0 in equation (3) and considering the equilibrium conversion from the plot of X A vs t . Consequently, the integrated solution of equation (3) is given by equation (4) that allows the determination of k f from the plot of f ( X A ) vs t that portrays a straight line passing through the origin, and the backward rate constant evaluated from k e : (4) f ( X A ) = [ [ l n [ ( 2 A 1 X A − 1 − M − A 2 2 A 1 X A − 1 − M + A 2 ) ( − 1 − M + A 2 − 1 − M − A 2 ) ] ] A 2 ] = A 3 k f t where, A 1 = ( 1 − 1 k e ) , A 2 = √ ( ( M + 1 ) 2 − 4 A 1 M ) and A 3 = C A O m L T T M V . Moreover, another version of the PH model was similarly regressed to the experimental kinetic data that considered the non-ideality of the reactive system by replacing the component concentrations with the component activities for each component as displayed in equation (5): (5) − r A V = m L T T M ( k f a A a B − k b a C a D ) where, a A , a B , a C a n d a D are the activities for isoamyl alcohol, acetic acid, IAA and water respectively. Also, the non-ideal equilibrium rate constant, k a was evaluated using the activities of each component at equilibrium as given by equation (6): (6) k a = a C a D a A a B = [ [ x C x D x A x B ] [ γ C γ D γ A γ B ] ] where, x A , x B , x C a n d x D are the equilibrium mole fractions and γ A , γ B , γ C a n d γ D are the activity coefficients of isoamyl alcohol, acetic acid, IAA and water respectively. Experimental concentration profile reveals the mole fractions of the components while the activity coefficients have been estimated using the UNIFAC group contribution method (Liu et al., 2019). The UNIFAC model calculates the activity coefficient based on the combined term ( γ i C ) and the residual term ( γ i R ) as portrayed in equation (7). (7) l n γ i = l n γ i C + l n γ i R The γ i C is derived using the characteristic volume (r) and area (q) parameters of the constituent functional groups while the γ i R is evaluated using the group interaction parameters ( a m n ) . The exact calculation procedure for the estimation of the activity coefficients has been detailed by Poling et al., 2001, and the requisite UNIFAC parameters used in this study has been enlisted in Table S2 and Table S3 for the r/q and a m n values respectively. Further, the kinetic models developed have been used to predict X A at different time intervals (n) for the four temperatures studied presently. In order to assess the accuracy of the two models, statistical investigation was carried out using root mean square deviation (RMSD) and average absolute deviation (AAD) as parameters as shown in the following equations (De et al., 2019b): (8) R M S D = [ ∑ i = 1 n ( X A p r e d − X A e x p ) 2 n ] (9) A A D = ∑ i = 1 n | X A e x p − X A p r e d X A e x p | n Additionally, the dependency of the forward and backward rate constants on temperature for both concentration and activity-based PH models can be expressed through the Arrhenius law: (10) k = k o exp ( − E A R T ) where, k o is the pre-exponential factor, E A is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant and T is the reaction temperature. equation (7) is revised as below to obtain the Arrhenius plot given by l n k vs 1 T . (11) l n k = l n k o − ( − E A R T ) Also, an understanding of the reaction thermodynamics has been explored presently to evaluate the enthalpy ( Δ r H O ), entropy ( Δ r S O ) and the Gibbs free energy ( Δ r G O ) for the IAA production using LTTM as a catalyst. On assumption that Δ r H O and Δ r S O are constants in the investigated temperature range, the Van't Hoff equation portrays the temperature dependence of the non-ideal equilibrium rate constant as shown in equation (12). (12) l n k a = − Δ r G O R T = − Δ r H O R T + Δ r S O R"
8,Life cycle assessment,"3.3 Life cycle assessment The framework for the LCA was guided by the standard ISO 14044 protocol that lays the prerequisites and guidelines for undertaking this study (Wang et al., 2018). The primary structure of a LCA exercise and the adopted methodology is discussed below. 3.3.1 Goal and scope definition LCA in the present research was executed to assess the environmental effects in the production of IAA through two different pathways which enabled the comparison of the catalytic esterification of isoamyl alcohol by conventional mineral acid (H2SO4) and the intensified catalyst, LTTM (ChCl:pTSA) proposed in this study. A suitable functional unit for both the cases was considered as preparation of 1 kg of IAA with a purity >99.5% as determined through analytical techniques detailed earlier which is a physical representation of the experiments conducted. As the present study emphases to evaluate the environmental impacts in the laboratory production of IAA, LCA has presently been conducted through a ‘cradle to gate’ approach which accounts for the raw material acquisition and the production stage. This LCA methodology is practically more relevant for products that have ensuing wide range of applications and this data can be necessarily used for several other ‘cradle to grave’ studies depending on the product end usage (Arvidsson et al., 2015). The scope of LCA is often limited for chemical reactions due to lack of sufficient data and thus the study relies on certain assumptions which are nonetheless same for both the investigated route of synthesis leading to a fair comparison of the impact assessments. The maintenance and cleaning of all equipments have been presently ignored and the transportation of chemicals has not been considered owing to the product manufacturing location still being the laboratory itself and the logical projected scenario would most probably be to set up an IAA production unit in proximity to the raw material producing industries. Further, the total emissions to air have been estimated to be 0.2% by weight of the chemicals used as specified in the Ecoinvent 3.6 database and the treatment of wastes have been presumed to be complete in an effluent treatment plant designated for spent solvent mixtures projected to be located within the premises of production unit. 3.3.2 Life cycle inventory The system boundaries for the two scenarios explored in the present study has been depicted in Fig. 2 wherein the inputs and outputs used at every step of the production process is exhibited. The green strategy proposed in this study involves a LTTM preparation stage wherein the neoteric reaction media that serves dual purpose of catalyst and solvent is produced before using it in the reaction followed by the esterification and purification stage. Indeed, this scheme led to the recycle of reagents for consecutive cycles that reduced significantly the cumulative raw material consumption as well as waste generation. The reference scenario for this strategy was the traditional approach of IAA production using H2SO4 as the catalyst that involved the esterification and the product purification stage as exhibited in Fig. 2. Further, the most crucial aspect in the LCA study involves collection of data like foreground or experimentally measured data which shows higher reliability and background data through bibliographic retrieval or from LCA databases to build the complete life cycle inventory (LCI) for the chosen scenarios. Certainly, the chemicals used in the preparation of catalyst, choline chloride and pTSA used for the experimentations were not present in the database used (Ecoinvent 3.6) under the intermediate exchanges, it required the use of proxies or relevant data from literatures. Accordingly, the synthesis of pTSA was modeled as detailed by Tingley et al., 2017, using equimolar ratio of toluene and sulfuric acid with an assumption of theoretical yield. However, due to inadequate data regarding mass balances in the synthesis of choline chloride, the data for the same has been extracted from the LCI of AGRIBALYSE database which assigns an equivalent module in the Ecoinvent database. The electricity consumption for each operation has been estimated in accordance to the utilized laboratory equipment that have characteristic technical energy requirements for the operated time duration and the measure has been assigned for low voltage electricity. All the data used for the process analysis from the Ecoinvent database were taken from the global market to ensure a more representative analysis in the wider context of the study. Further, as a measure of the data quality improves the interpretation of the environmental impacts, quality indicators have been assigned as reported by Weidema and Wesnaes for highest data reliability being designated as 1 and lowest by 5 (Weidema and Wesnaes, 1996) wherein all the weights of chemicals and effluents obtained experimentally is considered 1 and the emissions and electricity data as 3. Thereby, the source and quality of the data is reported in Table S4 and the inventory data for IAA production in both the chosen pathways is enlisted in Table S5. 3.3.3 Impact assessment The two chosen pathways for IAA preparation were modeled using SimaPro 9.1 PRé Consultants, software with the impacts being quantified through the ReCiPe 2016 (I/A) version 1.04 routine which evaluates the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) through several impact indicators to deliver globally recognized characterization factors. The midpoint indicators denote the effects of a particular impact while the endpoint indicators signify the effect of an impact category. The characterization factors for the midpoint indicators are positioned somewhere along the impact route, classically at the point after which the environmental mechanism is indistinguishable for each environmental flow assigned to that particular impact category. The characterized results are evaluated by multiplying the results of each life cycle inventory with the characteristic impact factors for the chosen methodology ReCiPe 2016 which are available readily in Simapro software. All the midpoint indicators in the chosen method cumulatively resulted in three endpoint or damage assessment indicators namely resources, human health and ecosystem to interpret the severity of categorical impacts. An individualist outlook was considered in the selected model to analyze the two scenarios within a time frame of 20 years as the other offered perspectives could be validated for a range of 100 and 500 years for the Hierarchic and Egalitarian modules respectively. The LCIA enabled to interpret impacts for the conventional and intensified process route wherein the crucial aspects could be detected and the importance of process improvement can be highlighted."
9,Sustainability metrics,"3.4 Sustainability metrics The environmental profiling of chemicals has been conducted using a few sustainability metrics that accounts for the primary principles of green chemistry. The presently considered metrics are the environmental factor (E-factor), percentage atom economy (% AE) and mass index (MI) which have been evaluated using the following equations (Marek et al., 2015): (13) E − f a c t o r = ∑ M w a s t e M p r o d u c t (14) % A E = m p r o d u c t ∑ m r e a c t a n t s × 100 % (15) M I = ∑ M r e a c t a n t + M c a t a l y s t + M a u x i l l a r i e s M p r o d u c t where, M w a s t e is the weight of waste generated, M p r o d u c t is the weight of our product, m p r o d u c t is molar mass of the product, m r e a c t a n t s is the molar mass of the reactants and M r e a c t a n t , M c a t a l y s t and M a u x i l l a r i e s are the total mass of reactants, catalyst and auxiliaries respectively."
10,Results and discussions,
11,Green esterification technique,"4.1 Green esterification technique The production of IAA has been investigated using different routes to explore the catalytic performance as well as ease of product purification through the following reaction scheme: Table 1 reports the yields of IAA obtained using different catalysts viz. H2SO4, pTSA and the LTTM ChCl:pTSA along with their capacity of phase splitting to enable reuse of the reaction mixture for further cycles. Interestingly, the yield of IAA was lowest for the H2SO4 based esterification while the yield using pTSA as catalyst was 4.8% lower than the LTTM ChCl:pTSA based reaction which resulted in 98.2% yield of IAA. Although after the downstream processing of the product, sulfuric acid degraded and could not be reused but the remaining catalysts were potentially recyclable though pTSA reusability posed several hindrances due to its deliquescent nature. Aqueous pTSA obtained after product isolation had to be completely dried prior to reuse which was accomplished through azeotropic distillation using cyclohexane as an entrainer. This increased yet another unit operation suggesting that despite pTSA exhibited satisfactory catalytic performance, the homogeneity after reaction was unfavorable for product purification and catalyst reutilization (Qin et al., 2020). However, the use of LTTM portrayed an added advantage of phase separation after the reaction that ensured the easy recovery of the product as well as direct recycle of the catalytic reaction media without any purification. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the repulsive interaction between the weakly polar IAA and highly polar LTTM composed of a strong hydrogen bond acceptor. The use of the highly acidic Brønsted acid catalyst, pTSA which is used presently in several organic transformations can thus be intensified by converting it to a LTTM which would enable milder reaction conditions, reduced corrosive damage and not only increase its activity but also stability and recyclability (Ünlü et al., 2019). Thereby, it could be interpreted that the use of LTTM in IAA production exhibited bi-functional properties of catalyst and solvent that altogether intensified the process by forwarding the chemical equilibrium and enriching the product phase. As the present study reports the use of LTTM for ecofriendly banana flavoring production for the first time, the effect of different process parameters influencing the reaction responses have been investigated and detailed in the next section to optimize the process for better scalability and commercial adaptability. 4.1.1 Data analysis and model validation The parametric optimization in the production of IAA using a neoteric green catalytic media has been conducted through the Box-Behnken design, wherein the critical process conditions such as the acid/alcohol molar ratio (A), LTTM molar ratio (B) and the reaction time (C) has been varied to interpret its role in the isoamyl alcohol conversion. The experimental design matrix along with the response value for each run is reported in Table S1 with the conversion ranging from 72.25% to 99.81% throughout the investigated range. A quadratic equation was found to best represent the experimental data with high statistical significance in predicting the percentage conversion of isoamyl alcohol ( I A c ) . Herein, to empirically correlate the results of IAA production at the three factorial variations (A, B and C) a second order polynomial in terms of coded factors was devised as shown in equation (16). (16) I A c = 99.16 + 5.67 A + 3.30 B + 5.22 C + 0.46 A B − 1.09 A C − 1.38 B C − 7.69 A 2 − 4.90 B 2 − 6.28 C 2 The data generated is subjected to regression analysis and the goodness of the model fit is portrayed in Fig. S1 which displays a linear correlation between the experimental and predicted values. The apparent straight-line fit indicates the adequacy of the selected model to predict the responses at different parametric variations. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also conducted to evaluate the statistical significance of the various factors on the response variable and the same is reported in Table S6. A high model F value and substantially low p-value suggested satisfactory significance of the employed regression model. Further, the statistical diagnosis revealed the coefficient of determination to be 0.9922 which that indicates the variation in the IAA production is primarily contributed by the independent factors considered and a minute 0.78% only cannot be explained by the model (Yuan et al., 2008). Moreover, the adjusted and predicted coefficient of determinations of 0.9822 and 0.8949 respectively were in close proximity and close to unity while the difference between them not exceeding 0.2 proposed no problem in the model or any block effect. The measure of the signal to noise variation given by the adequate precision of the model must be atleast 4 for a suitable model fit and the present data portrayed the same to be 29.82 reflecting sufficient signal to navigate the design space. Another measure that established the reliability and accuracy of the experimental design is the model variation coefficient which showed a minimal value of 1.26% which is as lower the better. Moreover, the percentage contribution of the different model parameters such as the linear, interaction and quadratic terms has been estimated using a methodology adopted from Sai et al. (2021). Certainly, the linear terms portrayed highest significance of 52% followed by the quadratic terms, while amongst the linear parameters, 46% contribution was observed from acid/alcohol molar ratio and 39% from reaction time while the least significant was the LTTM concentration. The presently explored statistical diagnostics are also well in agreement with other relevant studies (Abdullah et al., 2020); Varala et al., 2016). 4.1.2 Effect of process parameters The mutual effect of the different process parameters on the LTTM mediated esterification of isoamyl alcohol and the interaction between them has been represented through 3D response surface plots as exhibited in Fig. 3 . The graphs illustrate the change in the design response upon variation in the operating conditions for the 3-factor design of experiments presently explored as a function of two independent variables by keeping a factor at constant level. Fig. 3a portrays the effect of AB or acid/alcohol molar ratio and catalyst molar ratio on I A c at a particular reaction time wherein constructive significance of the factors towards the response is detected. It can be observed that at unity value for A and 0.5 for B the I A c was 78.25% while on increasing the acid/alcohol molar ratio to 4 at the same catalyst molar ratio the conversion was raised to 88.65%. This could be established by the fact that in a reversible esterification reaction as the excess reactant molar ratio increases, the equilibrium is shifted forward which increases the conversions. Meanwhile, at acid/alcohol molar ratio of 1 itself on increasing the catalyst molar ratio to 2, the response slightly increased to 83.56%. Certainly, with the rise of LTTM concentration the increase of isoamyl alcohol conversion is owed to the proliferation of active acidic sites availability which further increases the product yield because of the lower solubility of the ester product in the selected LTTM. However, the highest conversion of 99.8% was obtained at 2.5 acid/alcohol molar ratio with the catalyst molar ratio reduced to 1.25 suggesting a threshold limit of these parameters beyond which negative effect starts prevailing. This phenomenon could be attributed to the dilution of the catalyst (LTTM) in the excess reactant, acetic acid after the acid/alcohol molar ratio crossed a particular limit as also reported in other LTTM based reactions (Liu et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2019). Although at low acetic acid concentrations, the increase in catalyst concentration enhanced the reaction conversion but at higher acid/alcohol ratios increased catalytic loading had slight decrease or no remarkable effect in the alcohol conversion probably due to the increase in viscosity of the LTTM that exhibited mass transfer resistance (Gygli et al., 2020). Further, it can be inferred from Fig. 3b the combined effect of acid/alcohol molar ratio and reaction time at a constant catalytic dosage in the IAA synthesis. The conversion of isoamyl alcohol was 86.78% and 95.94% at an acid/alcohol ratio of 1 and 4 respectively for the highest reaction time of 3 h. Nevertheless, at unity acid/alcohol ratio on decreasing the reaction time to 1 h, the conversion grossly diminished to 72.25% indicating noteworthy impact of the interaction between reaction time and quantity of excess reactant. Fig. 3c establishes the mutual significance between catalyst molar ratio and time on the reaction conversion which discloses that at a low catalyst molar ratio of 0.5 the I A c was 78.85 which progressively increased to 90.15 as the duration of reaction varied from 1 to 3 h, whilst for 3 h reaction time with the highest catalytic dosage of the experimental design the change in the conversion was minimal indicating the advent of reversible nature of the reaction. Although, the individual parametric contributions of the terms are not alike, interestingly, as the interactive effect among the process parameters showed considerable significance, the RSM studies indeed was necessitated to derive the optimum process conditions for industrial implementation. 4.1.3 Numerical optimization and confirmatory runs The numerical optimization for the explored design matrix was conducted for the 3 operating parameters and a response variable to obtain the optimal combination of the same. Table 2 enlists the desired goals for each factor with their importance and the optimized conditions predicted through the model. The highest importance was allocated to the reaction conversion while the importance process parameters were set for 3. Amongst, the independent variables the acid/alcohol molar ratio which demanded high raw material usage was minimized while the other factors were set within the range of experimental design and the response been targeted for maximization to enable highest recovery of IAA. The investigation of the 17 experimental runs for mathematical optimization within the boundary limits of the initial Box-Behnken design the best outcomes were obtained for an acid/alcohol molar ratio of 2.31, catalytic molar ratio of 1.46 and a reaction time of 2.4 h yielding 99.81% conversion of isoamyl alcohol. Further, the optimized process parameters were utilized for confirmatory runs to ensure reliability of the regression model. Accordingly, experimental runs were carried out at an acetic acid molar ratio of 2.3, LTTM molar ratio of 1.5 for a time duration of 2.5 h to achieve a highest isoamyl alcohol conversion of 99.42% as reported in Table 2. The reported conversion is the arithmetic mean of three replicate runs conducted to attain higher accuracy and minimize experimental error. The confirmatory response and that predicted through RSM were in close proximity with their difference lying below 1% which is well within uncertainty limits of experimentation. This affirmed the successful optimization of IAA preparation using LTTM through RSM using the Box-Behnken design. Most importantly, IAA was the sole product obtained in the product stream suggesting the selected LTTM to be highly selective towards IAA. Moreover, the purification process was simplified due to phase splitting by the chosen LTTM that allowed the final yield of isolated IAA to be 97.12% obtained through the downstream processing method as detailed earlier. Consequently, the adoption of environmental benign LTTM, ChCl:pTSA as a dual catalyst and solvent for the clean synthesis of banana flavoring has been proved to be highly efficient and reliable alternative to the conventional route. 4.1.4 Catalytic reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism for the Brønsted acid based LTTM catalyzed isoamyl alcohol esterification is exactly unknown but the experimental results for the same have proven it to be an effective environmental benign catalyst. The LTTM under consideration is composed of a quaternary ammonium salt as hydrogen bond acceptor and a Brønsted acid as hydrogen bond donor. Supposedly, the pTSA component of the LTTM is deprotonated and a H+ ion is released and transferred to the carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid, acetic acid (Lee et al., 2016). Further, the general Fischer esterification scheme of acid catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution took place for the IAA synthesis. Accordingly, once the protonation of acetic acid occurs as suggested it undergoes nucleophilic attack by the OH group of isoamyl alcohol to establish a tetrahedral intermediate. This is subsequently followed by transfer of proton to the hydroxyl oxygen in the carboxyl group of the complex which enables dehydration to lose a water molecule and leads to the development of a protonated ester of isoamyl alcohol. Finally, a H+ ion is transferred to the chosen hydrogen bond acceptor, choline chloride that ensures the complete formation of stable IAA and simultaneous regeneration of the LTTM. Moreover, owing to the extremely low solubility of IAA in the selected LTTM, the ester continuously appears as a separate phase which allowed easier product recovery. Accordingly, the Brønsted acidity together with high polarity of the LTTM increased the reaction rate of isoamyl alcohol esterification and shifted the equilibrium favorably (Cao et al., 2016). A very low pH of −1.2 and a viscosity of 35 cP at the reaction temperature possessed by the LTTM ChCl:pTSA, similar to that reported elsewhere (Sert, 2020) guaranteed the constant availability active acidic sites throughout the reaction and effective interaction of the reactants in the homogeneous reaction mixture. The dual catalytic and solvent effect of the LTTMs may also be accredited to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the reactants and the LTTM that not only provide higher catalytic effect for proceeding the reaction with lower time durations but also immediate regeneration of catalyst, enabling recycle of the reaction media and thereby combating the growing environment pollution caused by conventional mineral acid catalysts."
12,Recovery and reuse of LTTM,"4.2 Recovery and reuse of LTTM The reuse of the LTTM is crucial both from the environment outlook as well as economic perspective to boost the plausibility of commercial exploration. The reaction media isolated after phase separation of the IAA layer is composed of the LTTM and unreacted acetic acid. The by-product water is not present as it is constantly withdrawn through a reactive distillation scheme during the reaction. Although the high catalytic activity of the LTTM might not have hindered the minimal presence of water in the system but for efficient recycle of the reaction media the constant water removal was a prerequisite. As the LTTM was completely assumed to be present in the lower phase, this layer was added with 1 equivalent of acetic acid and directly subjected to reuse in subsequent esterification reactions. This exhibited substantial reduction in raw material consumption in subsequent cycles which indeed plays a key role in making the proposed process economically viable. The LTTM phase was similarly utilized for five recycle runs and its catalytic performance is exhibited in Fig. 4 . Evidently, no significant change was observed in the conversion of isoamyl alcohol till five runs of experimentation suggesting that the catalytic activity of the LTTM was retained even after using it for multiple times. Moreover, this consistent behavior of the reused LTTM for recycle esterification reactions indicated the basic structure of the LTTM was still intact which was probably ascribed to the strong intermolecular interactions between the components of the LTTM. Most importantly, the LTTM phase of the reaction mixture could be easily separated and directly recycled without any treatments which further reduces unit operations and the overall process economics. Interestingly, present study witnessed higher number of recycle runs with negligible decrease in reaction performance for a LTTM based reaction compared to few other reactions catalyzed by the similar LTTMs wherein catalytic activity prevailed for only for 2–4 recycle runs (Hayyan et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2020). Further, in order to evaluate the recovery efficiency of the chosen LTTM, the five times recycled LTTM phase separated after reaction was concentrated at 343 K under vacuum to remove acetic acid and moisture which resulted in 94.5% recovery of the initially used LTTM. Therefore, the chosen LTTM ChCl:pTSA could be designated as a highly active as well as reusable catalyst in the ecofriendly production of IAA."
13,Kinetic modelling,"4.3 Kinetic modelling 4.3.1 Kinetic evaluation of IAA production The kinetic study for the esterification of isoamyl alcohol was conducted at four different temperatures as detailed earlier to gain a deeper insight on the catalytic performance of the chosen LTTM. The conversion profile of the IAA production at different time intervals is plotted in Fig. 5 for the various investigated temperatures at the optimum acid/alcohol molar ratio and LTTM dosage till the equilibrium conversions were achieved. As expected, the conversions varied negligibly with rise in temperature indicating no positive link in between the alcohol conversions and temperature which affirms the slight exothermic behavior of this esterification reaction. Exemplarily, a conversion of 97.44% could be attained at 383 K in 2.5 h while almost the same conversion was achieved within 1.5 h at 398 K. Accordingly, the increased reaction rate at higher temperatures reduced the time required for obtaining a desired conversion of isoamyl alcohol but the equilibrium conversions at all the temperatures were approximately same (98.5%). The concentration as well as activity-based PH models has been applied to develop the kinetic mechanism for the LTTM catalyzed IAA production. The kinetic parameters have been estimated from the plot of f ( X A ) vs t calculated using equation (4) and portrayed in Fig. 6 a and Fig. 6b for the concentration and activity-based PH models respectively. Table 3 reports the forward and backward reaction rate constants for the fitted models following a reversible second order regime with the forward rate constant highly dominating the backward rate constant indicating high catalytic activity of the chosen LTTM. However, with the increase of temperature from 383 K to 398 K the backward reaction rate steadily increased. Further, to assess the temperature dependence of the obtained rate constants; equation (11) was used that resulted in the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 6c and d for the concentration and activity-based PH models accordingly through which crucial kinetic parameters such as the pre-exponential factor and activation energy for the reaction were evaluated. The k o and E A of both the kinetic models for the forward and backward reactions have been enlisted in Table 3. Interestingly, through straight line fit of the Arrhenius plot with satisfactory linear coefficients above 0.99, the activation energies for the investigated isoamyl alcohol esterification were predicted to be 63.11 kJ/mol and 54.62 kJ/mol by the PH concentration and activity models respectively. As this is a pioneering study for the reaction kinetics of IAA production using LTTM, appropriate comparison of activation energy is not possible but comparing IAA reaction kinetics using expensive ion exchange resins, the presently obtained E A values for the forward and backward reactions are in the same range (Chen et al., 2020). Moreover, the low activation energy of the reaction system suggested effective intermolecular interactions with lower external forces and the high value of the pre-exponential factor likewise indicated more probability of collision between the reactants for efficient mass transfer. This could possibly owe to the high catalytic activity of the neoteric class of catalysts explored in the present study. The final forward reaction rate kinetic expression for the preparation of IAA over the ChCl:pTSA LTTM is given by equations (17) and (18) for the concentration and activity-based PH models respectively. (17) k f = 2.84 × 10 6 exp ( − 63.11 R T ) (18) k f = 1.84 × 10 5 exp ( − 54.62 R T ) 4.3.2 Model validation The goodness of fit of the developed kinetic models with the experimental data was verified by evaluation of the percentage conversions of isoamyl alcohol using the rate constants obtained. The comparison between the experimental conversions and that predicted by the kinetic models is presented in Fig. S2 which show minimal deviations at all the investigated temperatures. The statistical analysis for the same was also carried out with the RMSD and AAD as objective functions and reported in Table S7 to interpret the model accuracy. Remarkably, both the concentration as well as activity-based PH model exhibited significantly low errors portraying excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated IAA kinetic data. Further, it was noteworthy that the overall RMSD and AAD were though alike (∼1.5%) for both the models but the activity PH model showed lower deviations at lower temperatures while the concentration model better fitted at higher temperatures. The simulation of the intrinsically kinetic controlled esterification of isoamyl alcohol with acetic acid could thus be efficiently carried out using both the variations of the PH model. 4.3.3 Thermodynamic parameters The linear dependency of the natural logarithm of the non-ideal equilibrium constant and the inverse of temperature is evident from equation (12) and the graphical plot for the same is illustrated in Fig. S3. The slope and intercept of the straight line was used to estimate the thermodynamic functions of the reaction system. Accordingly, the Δ r H O , Δ r S O and Δ r G O for the LTTM catalyzed IAA production were calculated as −7.22 kJ/mol, 0.02 kJ/molK and −13.58 kJ/mol respectively at a reference temperature of 298 K. As observed from the conversion profile at different temperatures (Fig. 5) that there is no effective increase in conversion with increased heating load, the trivial exothermicity revealed by the value of enthalpy confirms the kinetic evaluation to be thermodynamically consistent."
14,Life cycle assessment,"4.4 Life cycle assessment A cradle to gate LCA has been executed using the comprehensive protocol described before for the production of IAA through conventional sulfuric acid and LTTM mediated processes using the experimentally derived inventory and certain theoretical assumptions. The LCIA of the two investigated processes for the production of synthetic banana flavoring was accomplished using the midpoint as well as endpoint assessment strategies. The characterized LCIA results of the green esterification approach for the 18 midpoint impact categories of the ReCiPe 2016 assessment method has been summarized in Table 4 . Further, as observed from Fig. 7 a, the esterification stage portrays a higher impact ranging from 52 to 81% for most of the midpoint categories in the conventional IAA production route. This can be undoubtedly accredited to the use of harsh sulfuric acid catalyst that pose potential environment hazards. However, a few impact categories namely stratospheric ozone depletion, ionizing radiation, freshwater ecotoxicity and water consumption witnessed a contribution of 68%, 84%, 53% and 74% respectively in the purification stage wherein the release of toxic acidic effluent, an excess use of process water of 3.5 kg/FU and high electricity consumption for distilling out pure IAA could have contributed to the higher impact. Moreover, the process contribution analysis for the LTTM facilitated esterification reaction is depicted in Fig. 7b for the three stages as reflected in Fig. 2. The LTTM preparation emerged as the stage that paid highest environmental impact for 12 of the 18 midpoint categories considered in this study. Exemplarily, the total measure of the terrestrial acidification for the green esterification process was estimated to be 8.55 × 10−3 kg SO2 equivalent with the contribution of the LTTM preparation step being 5.3 × 10−3 kg SO2 equivalent and that of the hydrogen bond donor of the LTTM itself being 4.78 × 10−3 kg SO2 equivalent, signifying the major role of reagents (56%) in the impact assessments). Likewise, a value of 1.24 kg 1,4-DCB for the human non-carcinogenic toxicity though was low enough but the LTTM preparation step had a major share of 64.5% in it owing to the minimal polluting HCl gas released from choline chloride. Accordingly, it is noteworthy that the use of suitable reagents plays a critical role in the overall environment impact assessment of a process as also highlighted in several other reports (Bories et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2013). However, the biodegradable nature of the chosen components of the LTTM resulted in low metrics for the stratospheric ozone depletion, ionizing radiation and human carcinogenic toxicity with less than 25% contribution in the LTTM synthesis step. Further, as the reuse of reaction media is proposed in the esterification stage, the impacts of acetic acid and the LTTM in the esterification stage is nullified to a great extent resulting in this step posing lowest environmental effect. The comparison of the LCA in all the midpoint categories for the two catalytic approaches has been illustrated in Fig. 7c for the functional unit of 1 kg production of IAA. The relative percentile of the overall impact in the two chosen pathways has been depicted through a stacked column chart wherein remarkably for all the categories, the green esterification approach indicated lower metrics. The measure of climate change through the GWP witnessed a 16% reduction in the LTTM based IAA preparation primarily owing to the renewable and ecofriendly raw materials that pose minor carbon footprints. Also, as the LTTM catalyst could yield similar results till five recycle runs without any alterations, the effective catalyst required for the chosen functional unit reduced significantly leading to 11% reduction in the mineral resource scarcity and a decline of 19% for the ionizing radiation. Meanwhile a moderate decrease in the electricity consumption resulted in only 5% lower fossil resource scarcity in the present approach. Most importantly, the benchmarking of the LTTM catalyzed isoamyl alcohol with the conventional route could be realized with the downstream processing of the product such that the impact of water consumption was decreased by 28%. The phase separation of product and LTTM after the reaction enabled the direct utilization of the excess acetic acid with sufficient make-up which indeed reduced the quantity of spent liquor to be treated or rather led to a negligible liquid discharge scenario. Consequently, the impacts of the effluent processing could be avoided and as 95% of the biodegradable LTTM could be recovered which could be easily disposed to the natural environment, the likely treatments required for catalyst disposal could also be disregarded. The final interpretation of the LCIA through the endpoint analysis involved the damage assessment in three categories referenced by the ReCiPe I/A methodology as reported in Table S8. The total impact of each damage category was substantially higher for the conventional route of production indicating the proposed LTTM as a benign catalyst alternative. Evidently, the highest variation between the two processes could be observed for the damage to ecosystem quality with a 51.2% higher impact for the sulfuric acid catalyzed process followed by the damage to human health wherein the LTTM catalysis portrayed a 39.2% reduction. This could be potentially attributed to the use of the harsh mineral acid, its subsequent acidic effluent discharge and high emission of particulate matter and carbon-dioxide into the atmosphere. Further, a 30% diminution in the resource availability in the greener approach is possibly due to the utilization of renewable resources as reagents which incur negligible fossil resource depletion apart from the processing. Similar results have also been recorded while comparing production routes with renewable components by Baaqel et al. (2020). The cumulative normalized impact assessment thus indicated that the LTTM mediated IAA production to be an ecofriendly process with insignificant damages in comparison to the conventional production scheme. Although the present work aimed to highlight the potential applicability of LTTMs as suitable catalysts and solvents for organic transformations and the preliminary results have been highly satisfactory, the restrictions on assumed system boundaries, limited inputs and their subsequent evaded outputs might have caused a slight deviation in the assessment. Nonetheless, with the lack of LCA in the area chemical productions and limited inventory data this study may throw some light to the advancements required in the future chemical and processing industries."
15,Sustainability metrics,"4.5 Sustainability metrics The standard established protocol for environment impact analysis of a process involves a complete and detailed LCA. However, the LCA of a process is often cumbersome, time consuming and requires extensive data for appropriate results. A rather simpler technique includes the environment profiling of a chemical based on sustainability or green metrics. These metrics neither account for the entire life cycle of the product nor include the contribution of energy consumption in the process but can be used as a quick tool to compare different preparation routes of a product. The sustainability metrics explored in this study have been evaluated using (13)–(15) and reported in Table 5 for the conventional and LTTM mediated production of IAA. It was observed that the green approach exhibited a lower E-factor due to extremely low quantity (10% of conventional route) of waste effluent generated in the process. The use of approximately 3.5 kg of water per kg of product in the mineral acid catalyzed route led to excessive toxic effluent discharge, thereby increasing the E-factor. Further, as the reaction under consideration is equilibrium limited it required the use of an excess reactant for obtaining higher yields. Acetic acid has been used in higher stoichiometric doses and the number of moles of the same reflected in the estimation of atom economy IAA. A percentage atom economy of 54.6% and 57.3% was obtained for the conventional and green route investigated respectively. Although, this metric enhancement in the LTTM catalyzed route appeared meagre, but in terms of the actual percentage atom utilization calculated by multiplying the % AE with the optimum conversions the improvement was 19.73%. Another green metrics examined is the mass index of the reaction wherein the evaluation has been conducted with and without considering the use of process water. As displayed in Table 5 the MI value for the conventional sulfuric acid approach reduced from 6.2 to 2.7 when the use of process water as an auxiliary material was ignored. However, comparing the two process routes for IAA preparation while considering all the materials involved the LTTM route showed a 62% higher efficacy. This is the result of direct recycling of the reaction media and the excellent catalytic efficiency of the chosen LTTM which required 12.2% lower isoamyl alcohol for 1 kg IAA production. Therefore, the rapid environmental assessment of processes through these sustainable metrics can enable the progress of environmentally favorable chemical production routes."
16,Conclusions,"The present study encapsulates a comprehensive protocol for the development of a sustainable production process of Isoamyl acetate (IAA) or synthetic banana flavoring. Acidic low transition temperature mixture (LTTM) composed of choline chloride and para toluene sulfonic acid was established as an efficient environmentally benign catalyst with 99.81% conversion of isoamyl alcohol portraying bifunctional properties of high catalytic activity and a suitable solvent media. The repulsive interaction between the LTTM and the ester allowed the product to appear as a distinct phase after the reaction easing product purification as well as direct recycle of the catalytic reaction media for five consecutive runs. The parametric optimization of the process conditions was executed through a three factor Box-Behnken design using response surface methodology to evaluate the effect of process parameters on the conversion of isoamyl alcohol. The optimum process conditions were an acid/alcohol molar ratio of 2.31, LTTM molar ratio of 1.46 and a reaction time of 2.4 h to yield the maximum conversion of 99.81%. Moreover, the kinetic model development for the LTTM catalyzed reaction was performed at 383 K–398 K using the pseudo-homogeneous (PH) model wherein the non-ideality of the system was also considered by incorporating the activity coefficient of each component estimated by the UNIFAC model. The evaluation of the kinetic parameters revealed the activation energy of the reaction was only 54.62 kJ/mol suggesting the chosen LTTM could satisfactorily promote the competent production of IAA. Besides, to effectually decipher the comparison of conventional mineral acid catalysis and LTTM catalyzed esterification, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the two selected pathways was conducted using the Simapro software and the impacts were realized for 18 midpoint categories which were grouped into 3 endpoint damage categories using the ReCiPe 2016 methodology. The LCA of the two production routes indicated the green approach using LTTM to exhibit significantly lower carbon footprints with 16% lower global warming potential, 39% reduction in impairment of human health and 49% lower damage to the ecosystem. Additionally, the environment profile of the product was evaluated through few sustainability metrics that which too indicated the LTTM mediated IAA production to be highly efficient and ecofriendly primarily owing to a mere E-factor of 0.46 and excellent catalyst reusability. Consequently, the proposed route of IAA preparation using LTTM poses meaningful potential to intensify the production of artificial flavorings and pave the path for development of cleaner chemicals."
