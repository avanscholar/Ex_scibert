0,Introduction,"The pressure waves of ultrasound in water induce acoustic cavitation bubbles, which upon implosion render pyrolytic fragmentation of water molecules to yield hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals [1,2]. At such, the dissolved solutes undergo thermal or oxidative fragmentation at the gas–liquid interface and/or hydroxyl radical mediated-oxidation in the bulk solution [3]. The local concentration of OH radicals is a maximum at the time of collapse and a large majority of them are recombined at the cooler gas–liquid interface before they are ejected out to the bulk solution [4]. Only a small fraction (depending on the frequency of irradiation and the power applied) may accomplish to escape the interfacial sheath and diffuse into the solution to initiate oxidation reactions. If the target of sonication is to destroy low volatility organic chemicals, it is of primary significance to intensify the efficiency of OH radical ejection into the aqueous phase by applying high frequency ultrasound and/or by inhibiting the rate of combination reactions at the interface [3]. The practice of chemical reagent addition to enhance the rate of sonochemical decomposition of non-volatile compounds and to increase the cost effectiveness of the process has focused on the use of various salts, bivalent/zero-valent iron, gaseous ozone and carbon tetrachloride [5–10]. The effect of CCl4 is due to its high volatility (vapor pressure=91mmHg at 20°C), which facilitates its diffusion into the gaseous bubble interior to undergo molecular fragmentation. The chemistry of CCl4 under ultrasonic irradiation is complex, but may be simplified as in the following reaction scheme [11,12]: (1) CCl 4 → ))) Cl + CCl 3 (2) CCl 4 → ))) Cl 2 + :CCl 2 (3) CCl 3 → ))) Cl + :CCl 2 (4) 2 CCl 3 → ))) CCl 4 + :CCl 2 (5) 2 CCl 3 → ))) C 2 Cl 6 (6) 2 CCl 2 → ))) C 2 Cl 4 (7) 2 Cl → ))) Cl 2 (8) Cl 2 + H 2 O → ))) HOCl + HCl Reactions (1)–(8) imply that the enhancement in sonochemical degradation of organic compounds by CCl4 addition is due to: (i) the production of HOCl, HCl and chlorine containing radicals, all of which are strong oxidizing agents [8], and (ii) the reaction of CCl4 with hydrogen atoms that reduce the probability of their recombination with OH radicals ( k CCl 4 - H = 3.8×107 M s−1, kH–OH = 4×1010 M s−1; [13]). The release of azo dyes into aquatic systems via wastewater discharge is a serious environmental threat due to their persistent color and potential to form carcinogenic amines upon hydrolysis. Research on the degradability of such dyes by ultrasound has shown that the process is strongly related to the ultrasonic power in solution, the applied frequency, pH, the dye structure and the relative position of the substituents [14–16]. However, even at optimal conditions at which complete decolorization is accomplished the degree of mineralization is low unless very long contact time is allowed [17,18] and/or the process is enhanced by the addition of chemical reagents, such as ferrous salts, ozone, H2O2 and/or by catalysis with solid particles [18,19]. The literature on sonochemical decomposition of azo dyes in presence of CCl4 is limited. The study of Wang et al. reports that the enhancement in the rate of methyl orange decomposition by 20kHz ultrasound is primarily due to the presence of chlorine species generated by CCl4 decomposition and less to that of excess OH radicals [8]. More recently, Okitsu et al. have investigated the role of ultrasonic intensity on the enhancement of methyl orange decomposition by CCl4, and reported that the enhancement was much larger at high intensity ultrasound and the contribution of chlorine species at both intensities dominated over that of OH radicals [20]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative impacts of sonochemically reactive substances- frequently found in surface, sub-surface and effluent waters- on the degradation of sulfonated azo dyes by 300kHz ultrasound to assess the role of OH radicals and to predict the potential reaction sites of such dyes in sonicated water. The reactive substances tested were CCl4 and t-butyl alcohol and the dye was C.I. Acid Orange 8 (AO8), which is a highly soluble aryl-azo-naphthol dye consumed widely in textile dyeing operations for its bright color and good fastness properties."
1,Materials and methods,"AO8 (MW=364.4g mol−1) was obtained from Aldrich in 65% purity and used without further purification. CCl4 and t-butyl alcohol were supplied from Merck and Acros Organics, respectively. The experimental set-up was made of a 150mL glass reactor consisting of a plate type transducer that emitted ultrasonic waves at 300kHz, and a generator operating at 25W. The cell was surrounded by a water cooling jacket to keep the test solutions at constant temperature (20±2°C). The active acoustical vibrational area of the transducer was 9.6cm2. Estimation of the power deposited in the reactor by calorimetry [21] showed that the system was operated at maximum calorimetric efficiency at 1.98Wcm−2 or 0.19WmL−1. Test solutions of 100mL were prepared by dilution of a 3mM stock (made by dissolving 1.68g AO8 in 1L boiling water during magnetic stirring) with Milli-Q water followed by 1h aeration prior to sonication. Air-saturated dye samples were sonicated successively in the presence of 0, 105, 310, 520, 730, 1040, 2070 and 5200μM CCl4 and the degree of dye removal in each set was monitored by the abatement in the visible and UV absorption of the solutions. The effect of t-butyl alcohol as a strong OH radical scavenger at the bubble-liquid interface was tested by running the reactions successively in the presence of 105, 210, 315, 525 and 1050μM of the additive. The dye concentration and the contact time in all experiments were 30μM and 30min, respectively unless otherwise indicated. Dye solutions were bubbled with argon gas throughout sonication to enhance cavity formation and to increase the collapse temperature [2]. The visible and UV absorbance of the dye samples before and during sonication were recorded by a Unicam Heλios Alpha/Beta double beam spectrophotometer with a 1cm pathlength. Hydrogen peroxide was analyzed colorimetrically by the potassium iodide method based on the reaction of H2O2 with I− to form I 3 - [22]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Decomposition of the dye in the bulk solution,"3.1 Decomposition of the dye in the bulk solution AO8 has three absorption maxima in its UV-visible spectrum: two in the UV-band and one in the visible. The peaks at 254 and 312nm reflect the absorption of aryl and naphthol groups, respectively while that at 490nm is due to the absorption of the chromophore containing the –NN– group attached to the aryl and naphthol carbons. It was found that ultrasound rendered more than 80% abatement in the visible absorption of the dye and about 20% and 40% abatement in the absorption of UV-254 and UV-312 bands, respectively. The chemical structure and UV-visible spectrum of the dye during 30min exposure to ultrasound are presented in Fig. 1 . Monitoring of the residual dye concentration in presence of increasing concentrations of CCl4 showed that within a range of 105–1040μM, CCl4 sharply accelerated the rate of dye degradation and almost complete (99%) decolorization was achieved in the presence of 2070μM CCl4. It was also found that the solution pH during the course of reaction dropped from an initial value of 6.34 to 3.73 and 6.05, respectively after 1min sonication with and without CCl4 (2070μM). The initial deviation from neutrality is due to air equilibration of the test samples, while further reduction after 1min sonication without CCl4 is a consequence of deprotonation of naphthol-OH. On the other hand, the sharp drop after 1min sonication with CCl4 is the consequence of reactions (1)–(8) that produce hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids. After 10min sonication pH was 4.37 in the absence of CCl4 indicating the formation of organic acids as products of dye sonolysis, and 2.92 in its presence. Enhanced rate of dye degradation at acidic pH is consistent with our earlier study, which reports that acidification of sulfonated dye solutions renders neutralization of the negatively charged SO3 group and enrichment of solution hydrophobicity [23]. The rate of decolorization of AO8 was pseudo-first order in the visible absorbance of the dye at all conditions so that the apparent rate constants were estimated by non-linear regression of absorbance-time data using the integrated expression of the first order rate law: (9) k ′ = 1 t ln A t A 0 where, A 0 and A t are the absorbance (490nm) of the dye solution at time 0 and t, respectively and k′ is the pseudo-first order absorbance decay constant. Variation of k′ with the initial concentration of CCl4 in the reactor is presented in Fig. 2 . The data show that there are three effective concentration regimes of CCl4: (i) 0–1040μM range, where the rate of color decay increases sharply; (ii) 1040–2500μM range, where it increases moderately; and (iii) 2500–6000μM range, where it increases only slightly with increasing concentrations of CCl4. The sharp increase in the rate of dye degradation at low concentrations of CCl4 is a consequence of the accumulation of chlorine species and OH radicals, while the relatively slower rates at higher concentrations is due to increasing degree of competition for OH radicals and other oxidative species via accumulation of oxidation/decomposition byproducts. Slower reaction rates at high concentrations of the additive is in agreement with the work of Chakinala et al., who have reported that the concentration of chloroalkanes in sono-reactors should be optimized such that the additives are completely consumed in the degradation process, leaving no residual in the effluent stream [10]. The impact of CCl4 on the rate of UV absorbance decay of AO8 is demonstrated by the bar chart in Fig. 3 . It was found that after 30min reaction time, the decay of UV-254 and UV-312 bands increased from 18% and 39% (US alone) to 36% and 68%, respectively by the addition of 2070μM CCl4. Note that under the same conditions, total color decay increased from 84% (US alone) to 99.5%, respectively. It is important to note that much larger fractions of decolorization (than aromatic and naphthol decay) with and without CCl4 signify the importance of OH radicals in the bleaching process of the dye and the priority of OH radical attack to the azo group [16]. Note also that the abatement in UV-254 band is smaller than that in UV-312 at all conditions due to the fact that the former reflects not only the absorption of aryl groups but also that of total organic carbon, mineralization of which is a very slow process. Assuming that the quantity of H2O2 in sonicated solutions is an indirect measure of the quantity of aqueous phase OH radicals, we monitored the concentration of H2O2 during sonication of: (i) milli-Q water (Control); (ii) milli-Q water + dye; (iii) milli-Q water + CCl4; and (iv) milli-Q water + dye + CCl4. The test concentration of CCl4 was 2070μM since the degree of decomposition in all three components of the dye was a maximum at this level. The data are presented in Fig. 4 . It was found that the formation of H2O2 (or I 3 - ) in control and control+dye sets increased linearly with time, and the slightly lower rate of formation in the presence of the dye signifies the consumption of some OH radicals by the dye. On the other hand, in the presence of CCl4 (set iii) the relation between H2O2 and sonication time followed two regimes: (1) initially it increased sharply to a maximum (reached at t =10min) and remained nearly constant there for 5min; (2) it declined steadily after 15min sonication. The observed relation is opposite to that reported by Wang et al. [8] for low frequency irradiation, at which the rate of H2O2 formation increased sharply throughout sonication. The disagreement must be due to different frequencies and different reactor parameters, which dictate bubble life time and collapse temperatures. At short frequency irradiation, the energy and collapse duration of a cavity bubble is considerably larger (than high frequency irradiation) [24,25] so that pyrolytic cleavage of CCl4 inside the bubble produces excess HOCl, which via reaction 13 yields I 3 - that may be interpreted as H2O2. In our case, the rapid increase in the rate of H2O2 formation during the first 10 of sonication is due to the combined effect of: (i) reactions of CCl4 and Cl 3 - with hydrogen atoms favoring the recombination of OH- OH over that of OH- H; and (ii) the reaction of I− with HClO producing excess I 3 - (or H2O2). In accordance, the reaction sequence is [8,12]: (10) CCl 4 + H → H + + Cl - + CCl 3 ( k = 3.8 × 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 ) (11) Cl - + Cl 2 → Cl 3 - (12) Cl 3 - + H → H + + Cl 2 - + Cl - ( k = 6 × 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 ) (13) 3 I - + HClO → Cl - + OH - + I 3 - It is not possible, however, to tell whether H scavenging (Eq. (10)) or I− reduction (Eq. (13)) is the more effective pathway, because the bimolecular rate constant of the latter is unknown. In any case, it is obvious that the observed increase in H2O2 (determined by KI method) in the presence of CCl4 may be misleading about the actual quantity of H2O2 (or OH radicals) in solution. However, the steadiness and the following decline after 10 and 15min sonication implies not only the depletion of CCl4, but also the accumulation of trichloromethyl radical, which is a source of OH radical sink at large concentrations ( CCl3 + OH → HOCCl3, k =106–107 M−1 s−1) [26]. In addition, it should be noted that H2O2 may also act as a OH scavenger when it exists above a critical concentration (H2O2 + OH → H2O + HO2, k =2.7×107 M−1 s−1) [27]. Finally in set iv (Control+CCl4 +dye), the profile of H2O2 formation was similar to that of Control+CCl4 with, however, a lower maximum and a slower rate of formation due to an additional OH radical sink- the dye, particularly its chromophoric component (Dye + OH → Dye-OH adduct k =1010–1011 M−1 s−1) [13,28]. It should be noted that sonochemical degradation of AO8 in the presence of CCl4 proceeds not only via oxidation by chlorine species but also by OH radicals in solution or in the interfacial area. Denial of the contribution of the latter (on the decay of methyl orange) by Okitsu et al. at high frequency reactors (200kHz) does not make our conclusion questionable, because the degree of bleaching in their study (C 0 =30 μM) without CCl4 was less than 10% in 60min [20], whereas we accomplished 85% bleaching of our dye (C 0 =30 μM) in 30min without CCl4."
4,Does C.I. AO8 undergo decomposition at the bubble-liquid interface?,"3.2 Does C.I. AO8 undergo decomposition at the bubble-liquid interface? Owing to the very high solubility of azo dyes, it is expected that the prime reaction site for their sonolytic decomposition is the bulk liquid. However, it is also reported that in concentrated solutions of highly soluble organic compounds, some of the solutes may migrate to the bubble-liquid interface, where they also undergo pyrolytic or oxidative decomposition [29]. When the solute is a sulfonated azo dye such as AO8, diffusion to the interfacial area is further facilitated in acidic solutions, which lead to hydrophobic enrichment of the solute [23]. To assess the degradability of AO8 at the interfacial area, we monitored the rate of decolorization during sonication in presence of t-butyl alcohol, which is a highly hydrophobic compound that readily migrates to the interface, where it reacts strongly with OH radicals [30]. Relative rates of color decay in the presence of varying concentrations of t-butyl alcohol are presented in Fig. 5 . The observed inhibition in dye bleaching with increasing concentrations of t-butyl alcohol is either due to the competition (between the dye and t-butyl alcohol) for free adsorption sites and OH radicals at the interfacial area, and/or to the lower rate of OH radical ejection to the bulk solution caused by excessive consumption in or at interface of the cavities. To assess the validity of the second hypothesis, we monitored the concentration of H2O2 during sonication of MQ-water spiked with the test concentrations of t-butyl alcohol, and found that the rate of H2O2 formation was not affected by t-butyl alcohol concentrations lower than 1050μM (data not shown), but was suppressed by about 35% at 1050μM (Fig. 6 ). Since decolorization of the dye was hindered both at low and high concentrations of t-butyl alcohol regardless of aqueous phase OH radical availability, we concluded that a significant fraction of the dye exists at the bubble-liquid layer (competition). Hence, a higher degree of rate inhibition at higher concentrations of t-butyl alcohol is not only due to a lower rate of OH radical ejection to the bulk solution (as verified by reduced H2O2 content), but also to enhanced degree of competition at the bubble-liquid film. It was found that the degradation of the dye was also slowed down by increased dye concentrations, at which the inhibitive effect of t-butyl alcohol was also magnified. Deceleration by increased dye concentrations is due to the presence of excess dye molecules at the interfacial area (competition) and the enhancement in the physical barriers to mass transfer at the bubble-liquid interface. Comparative estimates of the pseudo-first order decay rate constants of the three dye components at each test concentration are listed in Table 1 . Note that combined effect of excess dye and t-butyl alcohol addition was more drastic on decolorization of the dye than on the decay of UV absorption band. Finally, we monitored the rate of dye degradation during sonication in the concurrent presence of a rate enhancer-CCl4 and a rate inhibitor-t-butyl alcohol (at their effective concentrations), and found that the effect of the latter was dominant. The data are displayed in Table 2 in terms of relative bleaching rate constants at various experimental conditions. It was found that while decolorization of the dye was enhanced by 278% by CCl4 addition, it suffered 27% deceleration in the concurrent presence of both additives. The predominance of t-butyl alcohol effect over that of CCl4, which is largely more volatile (diffuses readily into the gas phase) can be explained by the extreme reactivity of t-butyl alcohol at the interface to generate excessive volatile oxidation byproducts, which by diffusion into the gaseous bubbles may reduce the bubble temperature and the collapse violence. At such, the decomposition of CCl4 during bubble collapse (to generate reactive chlorine species) is not as effective and the degradation of the dye is dependent to a larger extent on the quantity of OH radicals at the interface. Moreover, water pyrolysis is also slower at lower collapse temperatures so that less OH and H radicals are available to support the degradation of the dye."
5,Conclusion,"Sonochemical degradation of the textile dye C.I. Acid Orange 8 by 300kHz irradiation was remarkably enhanced by the addition of CCl4 via the formation of reactive chlorine species and the sink of OH radical combination reactions with atomic hydrogen. However, the addition of t-butyl alcohol (which reacts at the gas–liquid film) decelerated the rate of degradation, showing that the dye reacted not only in the bulk solution (as expected), but also at the interfacial area. The suppression was magnified in more concentrated dye solutions at which more of the dye molecules may reach the interfacial sheath, but less are able to undergo reaction. In the presence of both reagents at their most effective concentrations the rate of decolorization was 27% lower than that in ultrasound+CCl4, showing that t-butyl alcohol was more reactive in the bubble-liquid film than CCl4 was in the gas phase. The observation also signified the contribution of OH radicals in the overall degradation process. Finally, the enrichment and accumulation of volatile oxidation byproducts in the cavity bubbles (that reduce bubble temperatures) was also pointed out as a potential source of rate reduction via reduced rate of pyrolysis reactions."
