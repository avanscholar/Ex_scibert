0,Introduction,"Hydrogen fuel cells are promising candidates for the generation of electrical power for mobile applications. Conventional hydrogen production methods use gasoline or natural gas reforming. From the different feed stock fuels available, alcohols are very promising candidates because they are easily decomposed in the presence of water and generate a hydrogen-rich mixture at relatively low temperatures. An advantage of using methanol for H2 production is their high hydrogen/carbon ratio; this makes the steam reforming of methanol energetically favorable and has the advantage of reduction of soot formation due to the absence of carbon–carbon bonds, which may otherwise lead to catalyst deactivation [1,2]. Methanol is easy to store and transport as it is in a liquid form at room temperature. Instead of handling H2 under high-pressure or cryogenic conditions, steam reforming of methanol (SRM) can be used to produce hydrogen on board [3,4]. A large variety of catalytic materials for the reforming of methanol have been reported in the literature [5–15]. Among them, copper-containing catalysts such as Cu/ZnO and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, which are traditionally used for methanol synthesis and low-temperature water gas-shift reaction, have been the most frequently studied systems [11,16–18]. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts have been shown to deactivate considerably during extended times on stream and treatment at elevated temperatures, which may not be acceptable for the application in mobile fuel-cell applications [19]. Therefore, the development of new efficient catalyst systems that exhibit an improved long-term stability and selectivity toward hydrogen production are highly desired. Liu et al. [20] reported that CuO/CeO2 is very effective for steam reforming of methanol (SRM). It has been shown that the catalytic activity of CuO–CeO2 catalyst in SRM is considerably affected by the copper content. Oguchi et al. [21] found that the optimum amount of CuO in CuO/CeO2 was 80 wt.% having an accelerating effect in the SRM with the addition of ZrO2. Udani et al. [22] found that the 70 wt.% CuO–CeO2 catalyst had the highest activity in the temperature range of 160–300 °C for both SRM and OSRM. On Cu/CeO2 catalysts [7] was reported that samples with 2 and 6 wt.% of copper had the best catalytic activity on the OSRM than the catalyst with 10 wt.% of copper. Shimokawabe et al. [23] have reported that highly active Cu/ZrO2 catalysts for the steam reforming of methanol could be prepared by impregnation method. They found that the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited significantly higher activities than their silica-supported counterparts. Yao et al. [24] found that the catalyst with higher specific copper surface area and component dispersion shows higher activity for methanol conversion at lower temperature and low CO production. Breen and Ross [25] studied the steam reforming of methanol on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. They found that using zirconia as a support for Cu and ZnO produces a more active catalyst than Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 for the SRM reaction. Nickel-based catalysts; have been extensively studied in the reforming process for syn-gas production, this reaction allows the conversion of two undesirable greenhouse gases like CH4 and CO2 [26–30]. Almost all the studies related with Ni-catalysts in the steam reforming of liquid products mainly used ethanol (SRE) as an H2 source [31–37]. Biswas and Kunzru [32] studied the effect of Ni on CeO2–ZrO2 supports and found that the reforming capability of Ni/Ce0.16Zr0.84O2 and Ni/Ce0.41Zr0.59O2 catalyst was low, whereas the highest activity was obtained on 30% Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 sample at 600 °C. The high ethanol conversion observed on the 30% Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 sample for SR was attributed at the higher amount of reduced nickel available for reaction. However, all catalysts tested, produced significant amount of acetaldehyde at lower temperatures due to the dehydrogenation of ethanol. On Cu/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts during OSRM reaction was observed highest catalytic activity and less CO production on the Cu/CeO2-rich catalysts, while the lowest performance was obtained on the Cu supported on mixed ZrO2–CeO2 oxides with >50 wt.% of ZrO2 in the support [9]. In this work we studied the catalytic properties of nickel supported on CeO2–ZrO2 with different ZrO2/CeO2 ratios in the OSRM reaction for H2 production as a function of temperature. Catalytic materials were characterized by BET (N2 adsorption–desorption), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction) and TPR (temperature-programmed reduction)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Single ZrO2 oxide was prepared by the sol–gel method from Zirconium (IV) propoxide (Fluka) as a precursor in n-propanol (Aldrich) solution and basic catalyst (NH4OH) (Fluka) with constant stirring. Mixed oxides CeO2–ZrO2 (10, 50, 90 wt.% of ZrO2 in mixed oxides) were prepared as follow: cerium acetate (C6H9CeO6-Aldrich) at an appropriate composition was dissolved at room temperature in n-propanol then Zr-propoxide was added and finally the NH4OH. The solution was processed at reflux temperature (85 °C) and water was drop wise added to the solution. The reflux temperature was maintained for 1 h and the resultant mixture was cooled at room temperature ageing it for 24 h. The residual liquid was removed by decanting. The molar ratio used for the synthesis was: propoxide/alcohol/H2O/NH4OH = 1:4:4:0.33 [9,38–40]. The xerogel was obtained after heating the mixture in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h in static air using a temperature ramp of 5 °C/min. Under an air stream the xerogel was heated at 100 °C for 1 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. The CeO2 synthesis was done using the precipitation method of the C6H9CeO6 in NH4OH at 50 °C. The solid obtained was calcined at 600 °C for 5 h in air stream. The prepared supports were impregnated with a solution of NiCl2·6H2O at an appropriate concentration to yield 3 wt.% of Ni in all catalysts. The samples were dried at 100 °C for 1 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h in static air and then reduced with H2 stream (60 mL/min) at the same temperature for 2 h before characterization and activity test. The labeling of different catalysts will be referred as Ni/ZrO2, Ni/CeO2 and Ni/CZn, where C = CeO2, Z = ZrO2, n = 10, 50, 90 wt.% of ZrO2 in the samples respectively. The actual Ni content was determined by ICP and it was 2.82, 2.82, 2.85, 2.86 and 2.84 for Ni/ZrO2, Ni/CZ90, Ni/CZ50, Ni/CZ10 and Ni/CeO2 respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Single point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of catalysts was determined by the dynamic pulsing technique on a multitask RIG-100 instrument from ISRI equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) with output to a computer, employing nitrogen physiosorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to each measurement, the sample was degassed at 120 °C by passing 30% N2/He for 30 min. Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) experiments were performed on a multitask RIG-100. The oxidized catalyst (0.1 g) was placed in the reactor and purged with UHP Ar at room temperature and then the TPR measurement was achieved using 5% H2/Ar gas mixture (40 mL/min). The temperature was increased at a rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 600 °C. The effluent gas was passed through silica gel to remove water before measuring the amount of hydrogen consumed during the reduction of the catalysts in a TC detector. The signal was calibrated by 0.5 mL pulses of 5% H2/Ar at the end of the experiment. Also TPR analyses of the spent catalysts were performed. For this, the surface of the spend catalysts was cleaned by a He stream (40 mL/min) for 30 min at 375 °C and cooled at room temperature, then the sample was purged with UHP Ar flow and the TPR was done. X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns were recorded in a Siemens D-5000 diffratometer, using Cu Kα (α = 0.15406 nm). The morphology and chemical composition of the samples were determined in a Philips XL-30, with resolution of 3.5 nm, fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDAX) at an acceleration voltage of 25 kV, obtaining the images with the backscattering electron signal. Before the analysis, the samples were fixed on aluminium specimen holder with an aluminum tape."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The steady-state activity in the oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction was performed in a conventional fixed-bed flow reactor (8 mm i.d.) using a commercial flow system RIG-100–ISRI. The catalytic test was evaluated in a temperature range from 250 to 375 °C with less of 5% of the error in the curves, at atmospheric pressure with 0.1 g of the catalyst placed in the reactor with a thermocouple in contact with the catalytic bed to control the temperature inside the catalyst. The sample was first activated in a stream of H2 (60 mL/min) from room temperature to 500 °C with a heating rate of 7 °C/min and held at this temperature for 1 h. The catalyst was brought up to the reaction temperature in He and the reaction mixture was introduced. For the OSRM reaction, O2 (5%)/He mixture was used and the total flow rate was kept at 60 mL/min (GHSV = 30,000 h−1 based on the total flow). This gas was added by means of a mass flow controller (RIG-100) and bubbled through a tank containing mixture of water and methanol; the partial pressure of CH3OH, H2O and O2 was 73.59, 12.75 and 22.44 Torr respectively. The effluent gas of the reactor was analyzed by gas-chromatography (Gow-Mac 580 instrument) equipped with a two columns system (molecular sieve 5 Å and Porapack Q columns), double injector controlled by Clarity software V.2.6.04.402 and TCD. The first column was used to separate the gaseous products such as H2, O2, CH4 and CO. The second column was used to separate water, methanol, methyl formate (MF) and CO2. The Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts after catalytic reaction were tested again in a second cycle in the OSRM reaction. So at the end of the reaction (375 °C) the spend catalyst was cleaned with He for 30 min, then the sample was cooled at the reaction temperature and the catalytic activity was performed. All the reported data were collected during 4 h of run time. The following equations were used to determine the methanol conversion and selectivity: X ( % ) = C i n − C o u t C i n × 100 S H 2 ( % ) = n H 2 − out n H 2 − out + n CH 4 − out + n CO out + n CO 2 × 100 S CO ( % ) = n CO 2 − out n H 2 − out + n CO 2 − out + n CO out + CH 4 − out × 100 The subscripts in and out indicate the inlet and the outlet concentrations of the reactants or products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystalline phases (XRD),"3.1 Crystalline phases (XRD) XRD patterns of the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts are presented on Fig. 1 . It can be seen on the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of the zirconia. The addition of CeO2 to ZrO2 on mixed oxides causes a reduction in the intensity and a broadening of the diffraction peaks. This finding was associated with the reduction of crystallinity, as well as a reduction in the particle size of the support [9,39,41,42]. Adding 10 wt.% of the CeO2 to zirconia stabilized the tetragonal phase of the ZrO2 as was reported for other materials [9,39,42]. However, on the Ni/CZ50 sample, a mixture of solid solution was observed and it corresponding to the tetragonal Zr0.84Ce0.16O2 and cubic Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 phases [9]. Typical ceria cubic structure was present on the XRD patterns of the Ni/CeO2 and Ni/CZ10 catalysts. In addition, diffraction peak of the metallic Ni was observed in all samples; but the intensity of this peak was higher on the Ni/ZrO2-rich samples than on the Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts; suggesting that CeO2 support promote the dispersion of Ni and make its crystallite size smaller. The XRD patterns of the Ni/ZrO2 and the Ni/CZ50 samples post-reaction showed changes in the crystalline structure. The intensity of the tetragonal phases of the ZrO2 and the Zr0.84Ce0.16O2 diminished on the Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/ZC50 catalysts respectively, whereas the intensity of the monoclinic structure of zirconia and cubic Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 phase was increased on the same samples. This phenomenon was observed previously on Cu/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts during OSRM reaction [9]. So the tetragonal structure was transformed to a monoclinic phase in the case of the Ni/ZrO2 sample and a cubic structure in the case of the Ni/ZC50 catalyst, thus the increase of the monoclinic and cubic phases was at the expense of the tetragonal phase. On the other samples, those crystalline structures were almost unaffected by the reaction. Bi et al. [43] reported the same phenomena on Pt–Ru/ZrO2 catalysts after OSR of the ethanol reaction; they observed that the tetragonal phase diminished and the monoclinic structure of ZrO2 increased."
7,Textural properties,"3.2 Textural properties The surface area of the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts calculated by the BET method from N2 adsorption-desorption through the single point method are summarized in Table 1 . CeO2 support exhibited a high value of the specific surface area (ca. 53 m2/g) than ZrO2. On the other hand, the addition of the CeO2 to ZrO2 caused and increased in the specific surface on the mixed oxide. When the ceria content goes up to 90 and 50 wt.% on the mixed oxide the surface area values were higher than ZrO2-rich supports. These results are in agreement with those reported on [9,42], they reported that the surface area of CeO2–ZrO2 supports increased as the zirconium was added to CeO2. This finding could be improved the dispersion of the Ni on the support, which is beneficial for the performance of the catalyst. Ni impregnation on the supports causes a decrease in the surface area, this behavior could be attributed to the blockade of the pores in the support by the Ni, as well as to the thermal treatments, but the tendency in the surface area was maintained. Fig. 2 shows the SEM image of the Ni/ZC50 catalyst before catalytic reaction. It can be seen that the sample was constituted by large particles with semispherical tendency and flat particles like a rectangular rods. After catalytic reaction, these kinds of particles remain in all the catalysts as at the beginning of the reaction."
8,Temperature-programmed reduction,"3.3 Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the fresh Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 samples and catalysts after catalytic reaction were performed in order to compare the effect of support composition on the reducibility of the nickel oxide (Fig. 3 ). Reduction peaks observed on the catalysts at temperatures close to 350 °C were associated to the reduction of NiO particles strongly bonded with the support [8,32,44] and the peak above 500 °C was related to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ [7,9,42]. TPR profiles of the catalysts showed that with increasing CeO2 content to ZrO2, the reduction temperature of the Ni-base catalysts supported on the mixed CeO2–ZrO2 oxides shifted towards higher temperature until ZC-50 support as reported for other catalysts that used ZrO2–CeO2 oxides as catalytic supports [9,32,42]. In addition, it is clear that the TPR profile of the Ni/ZC-50 catalyst showed a combined broad reduction peak indicating heterogeneity in the kinds of NiO species present on the catalysts, this finding could be associated with the strong interaction of Ni with the mixture of solid solution identified on this catalyst than the Ni deposited on the others supports. TPR profiles of the samples after OSRM reaction showed a shift of the reduction peaks at lower temperatures than on the fresh catalysts. This effect was associated with the redispersion of the active phase supported on CeO2–ZrO2 oxides having highly dispersed species as was reported on literature [8,9]. However, as before the reaction, the CeO2-rich catalyst had high H2 consumption. This finding showed that all catalysts were oxidized during catalytic reaction, and that the reducible species present on the surface of the catalysts was present in both oxidized and reduced states, but the metallic state prevails as was confirmed by XRD results of the samples analyzed after catalytic reaction. Turco et al. [45] suggested that there was a zone of the catalytic bed in which the catalyst is oxidized, and another zone in which it was reduced. However, we suggest that some fraction of the metallic surface active phase is partially oxidized and the core of the particles remains in the reduced state. On Cu/CeO2 samples after OSRM reaction it was found by EPR technique, Cu2+ forming a nano-sized two-dimensional structure [7,46,47]. Oguchi et al. [21] observed a reduction peak on the CuO/ZrO2 sample post-reaction. They concluded that the Cu2O phase was stabilized during the SRM reaction and confirmed by XRD analysis. The principal peak positions and the percentage of the NiO reduced on each catalyst given by the Ni/H2 ratio were summarized in Table 1. The H2 uptake on the fresh Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts was higher than the Ni/ZrO2-rich catalysts, however on all samples the H2 consumption was lower than that required for a total reduction of NiO except on the Ni/CZ50 catalyst. The lower value of Ni/H2 ratio suggests that on ZrO2-rich catalysts the interaction of nickel with the support is high avoiding the Ni reduction. However, in the Ni/ZC50 sample the hydrogen uptake was higher than the expected for the total reduction of the NiO present on the sample. This finding could be associated to the fact that, in the TPR study, Ni particles probably cause spill over of hydrogen onto the support inducing a concurrent reduction of both nickel oxide and the surface of the CeO2 [7,9,42]. This shows that the mixed ZC50 oxide had a greater oxygen storage capacity and better oxygen transport capability, which contributes to the hydrogen consumption."
9,Oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction over Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts,"3.4 Oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction over Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts The effect of the reaction temperature between 250 and 375 °C on the catalytic performance of Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts during the OSRM reaction is illustrated in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the conversion of methanol was high at the maximum reaction temperature. In addition, it showed that depending of the composition of the support; the catalysts have a significant influence on the methanol conversion. Among them, the Ce-rich catalysts exhibit the highest methanol conversion, whereas nickel supported on Zr-rich supports gave the lowest conversion. On Ni-base catalyst supported on ZrO2-monoclinic with high surface area, was reported low catalytic activity at 300 °C as on this work [8]. However, after 350 °C the methanol conversion reached 100% of conversion on that catalyst [8], but the selectivity toward hydrogen was close as on this work. Biswas and Kunzru [32] reported that the best catalyst for the steam reforming of ethanol was the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst followed by the Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 and Ni/CeO2 samples respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the light-off temperature was 250 °C and 300 °C for Ce-rich samples and Zr-rich catalysts respectively. Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed the highest methanol conversion at temperature below 300 °C, raising the reaction temperature up to 375 °C, the catalytic activity approaches 100% on Ni/CeO2, Ni/CZ10 and Ni/CZ50 samples. While, on the Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/CZ90 catalysts, the methanol conversion at 300 °C were <10% whereas at 375 °C the catalytic activity was close to 70%. Note that the BET surface area of the Ni/Ce-rich catalysts were higher than Ni/Zr-rich samples, thus, the catalytic activity observed on the CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts can be correlated with the surface on these samples, as well as, to the Ni0 present on the catalysts. So, catalysts that showed high catalytic activity had higher surface area, while the catalysts that presented low surface area it had the lowest methanol conversion [8,9]. Taking in account these findings we analyzed the spent Ni/CeO2-rich samples in order to find if the samples had the same catalytic activity. The Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts exhibited stable performance during 2 cycles of reaction (Fig. 4) without apparent deactivation, evidenced by the consistent composition of the outlet stream (Table 2 ). The products observed on the oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction over nickel-base catalysts supported on CeO2–ZrO2 were H2, CO2, CO and H2O. However, a small quantity of methyl formate (MF) was observed at temperatures below 325 °C in all the samples. Above this temperature, the methyl formate was unstable on Ni/Ce-rich catalysts and was not detected. This behavior was previously observed on Cu/CeO2 catalysts [7,9,42]. Esposito et al. [48] reported the production of MF on copper-containing ZrO2 systems, they suggested that it was produced on the support. Fig. 5 a showed the hydrogen selectivity as a function of the reaction temperatures during the catalytic test of the Ni-base catalysts. It showed that the hydrogen production started at 275 °C, in addition, it is clear that the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst had higher selectivity toward H2 after 325 °C than the others samples; however it had low methanol conversion. At the maximum reaction temperature the H2 production, gave values near to 45% on Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts. At this temperature the methanol conversion was nearly 100%. Oguchi et al. [21] reported that the incorporation of zirconia in ceria significantly affects the properties of the ceria–zirconia support and the properties of the copper catalysts on the steam reforming of methanol. They observed that the Cu supported on CeO2–10% ZrO2 had high H2 production, this phenomena was also observed on the OSRM reaction [9]. However, Biswas and Kunzru [32] observed highest H2 production on Ni/ZrO2 sample than Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts during SRE reaction. The CO2 selectivity (Fig. 5b) was important at the beginning of the reaction and at the maximum reaction temperature was close to 50%. While, the CO selectivity reached a maximum at 300 °C over the Ni/Ce-rich catalysts, after this temperature it decrease (Fig. 5c), although the CH3OH conversion was close to 100%. It is clear that the CH4 formed during the reaction was at the expense of CO, because CO2 selectivity was practically constant. The following reaction could be occurring on these catalysts: CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O"
10,Conclusions,"Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts were used for the oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction for hydrogen production. Activity tests showed that the Ni-base catalysts were highly active and stable for OSRM. The Ni/Ceria-rich catalysts had the best catalytic performance for the OSRM. The Ni/CeO2-rich catalysts exhibited stable performance during 2 cycles of reaction without apparent deactivation, evidenced by the consistent composition of the outlet stream. High H2 selectivity was observed on Ni supported on ZrO2 but it did not reform all the methanol while, Ni/CeO2-rich samples (>50 wt.% of CeO2 on the mixed oxides) showed close selectivity near to 45%. The high selectivity of CO2 in the full range of temperatures, suggests that the reverse WGS reaction does not occur on these samples. It seems that the nickel is the phase mainly responsible of hydrogen production although the ZrO2 support reduces the CO formation."
