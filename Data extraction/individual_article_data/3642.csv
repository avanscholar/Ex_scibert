0,Introduction,"It is well-known that CS bonds can be activated by transition metals to form novel sulfur compounds or sulfide complexes [1–3] and this process is extensively studied for the last few decades due to its importance in industry [4–6]. Recently, transition-metal mediated CS bond activation and cleavage is applied in diverse bioorganic and synthetic chemistry [7,8]. Moreover, transition metals mediated CS bond activation along with the transformation processes are of stimulating interest from the perspective of synthetic, mechanistic as well as catalytic aspects [9–11]. Transition metal mediated cleavage of both C(aryl)-S and C(alkyl)-S bonds are extensively studied. Hanton et al. reported Cl- triggered facile C(alkyl)-S cleavage of thioether moiety in platinum(II) complex [12]. Goswami et al. reported the effect of reaction temperature and dπ(M) → π(NN) on C(alkyl)-S cleavage in platinum(II)-thioether complex [13]. Pramanik et al. explored the C(alkyl)-S cleavage in Rh(III) and Ir(III) complexes in presence of excess PPh3 [14,15]. In recent years, Biswas et al. reported the activation of both C(aryl)-S and C(alkyl)-S bonds to form cyclometalates and metal-thiolato complexes respectively of group 9 metals [16]. In our previous works, we have reported the synthesis of Pd(II), Ru(II) and Rh(III) complexes by metal induced C(alkyl)-S and C(aryl)-S bond scission of thioether containing ligand systems [17–20]. Herein, we have synthesized a new Rh(III)-triphenylphosphine complex supported by a tridentate pyridine-imine-thiolato ligand backbone via benzylic CS bond cleavage of the thioether ligand, L-CH2Ph (where, L-CH2Ph = 2-(benzylthio)-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)aniline). It’s worth to mention here that the benzylic group plays an important role to cleavage of the CS bond for the present case. In our previous work, no CS bond scission was observed and a S(Me)-Rh coordination mode was found under the similar reaction conditions [21]. On the other hand, transfer hydrogenation of ketone to the corresponding alcohol is one of the most important fundamental subjects in modern synthetic chemistry [22,23] and is a convenient method to reduce carbonyl compounds without the use of hazardous hydrogen gas or moisture-sensitive hydride reagents [24–27]. Moreover, the transfer hydrogenation of ketones is widely accepted in industry as a cost-effective way for the production of a number of hydroxylated organic products [28]. Over the last few decades, significant effort on hydrogenation is given on the use of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium catalysts [29–31]. In view of the significant contribution of rhodium complexes towards catalysis, herein we have also explored the catalytic efficiency of the synthesized Rh(III) complex, [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1) towards transfer hydrogenation of ketones in i PrOH."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 2-(Benzylthio)-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)aniline (L-CH2Ph) was synthesized following the published procedure [32]. Pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, 2-aminothiophenol and RhCl3·3H2O were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and used as received. All other chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and were used without further purification."
3,Physical measurements,"2.2 Physical measurements Microanalyses (C, H, N) were performed using a Perkin-Elmer CHN-2400 elemental analyzer. Electronic spectra were measured on Lambda 750 PerkinElmer spectrophotometer in dichloromethane solution. IR spectra were recorded on RX-1 Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer in the spectral range 4000–400 cm−1 with the samples in the form of KBr pellets. Luminescence property was measured using Shimadzu RF-6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature (298 K) in acetonitrile solution by 1 cm path length quartz cell. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a time-resolved spectrofluorometer from IBH, UK. The instrument uses a picoseconds diode laser (NanoLed-03, 370 nm) as the excitation source and works on the principle of time-correlated single photon counting [33]. The goodness of fit was evaluated by χ2 criterion and visual inspection of the residuals of the fitted function to the data. 1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on Bruker 300 MHz FT-NMR spectrometers in presence of TMS as internal standard. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using CHI Electrochemical workstation. A platinum wire working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used in a standard three-electrode configuration. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6) (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte and the scan rate used was 50 mV s−1 in CH2Cl2 under N2 atmosphere. ESI mass spectra were recorded on a micro mass Q-TOF mass spectrometer. The one electron oxidized species 1+ was generated by exhaustive electrolysis of 1 [34]. The luminescence quantum yield was determined using carbazole as reference with a known ϕR of 0.42 in MeCN. The complex and the reference dye were excited at the same wavelength, maintaining nearly equal absorbance (~0.1), and the emission spectra were recorded. The area of the emission spectrum was integrated using the software available in the instrument and the quantum yield is calculated according to the following equation: ϕS/ϕR = [AS / AR ] × [(Abs)R /(Abs)S ] × [ηS 2/ηR 2] Here, ϕS and ϕR are the luminescence quantum yield of the sample and reference, respectively. AS and AR are the area under the emission spectra of the sample and the reference respectively, (Abs)S and (Abs)R are the respective optical densities of the sample and the reference solution at the wavelength of excitation, and ηS and ηR are the values of refractive index for the respective solvent used for the sample and reference. The yields of catalytic conversion were determined by GC instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a HP–5 column of 30 m length, 0.53 mm diameter and 5.00 μm film thickness. The column, injector and detector temperatures were 200, 250 and 250 °C respectively. The carrier gas was N2 (UHP grade) at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The injection volume of sample was 2 μL. The oxidation products were identified by GC co-injection with authentic samples."
4,Preparation of [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1),"2.3 Preparation of [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1) The reaction mixture containing RhCl3·3H2O (0.10 g, 0.38 mmol), L-CH2Ph (0.101 g, 0.38 mmol) and PPh3 (0.262 g, 1 mmol) in 20 mL acetonitrile was refluxed for 8 h to yield a deep green solution. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure. The dried crude product was purified by using silica gel (mesh 60–120) column chromatography. The green band of the complex was eluted by 30% (v/v) ethyl acetate-petroleum ether mixture. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the solid pure green product was further dried under vacuum. Yield, 0.155 g (63%). Anal.

5,Procedure for catalytic transfer hydrogenation,"2.4 Procedure for catalytic transfer hydrogenation In a typical experiment the ketone (2 mmol), KOH (0.02 mmol), and complex 1 (0.005 mmol) were added to degassed i PrOH (5 mL), and the mixture was stirred at 80 °C in an inert atmosphere for 6 h. The reaction was then monitored at various time intervals by the use of GC. After the reaction was complete, i PrOH was removed on a rotary evaporator, and the resulting semisolid was extracted with diethyl ether (5 × 5 mL). The combined liquid phase was analyzed by GC using undecane as an internal standard."
6,Computational Details,"2.5 Computational Details Full geometry optimization of complex 1 was carried out by DFT/B3LYP method [35,36]. All elements except rhodium were assigned the 6-31G(d) basis set. For Rh, LanL2DZ basis set with effective core potential was employed [37–39]. The vibrational frequency calculation was performed to ensure that the optimized geometry represents the local minima and there are only positive eigenvalues. All calculations were performed with Gaussian09 program package [40] with the aid of the GaussView visualization program. Vertical electronic excitations based on B3LYP optimized geometry were computed using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) formalism [41–43] in CH2Cl2 using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) [44–46]. The fractional contributions of various groups to each molecular orbital was calculated using GaussSum program [47]."
7,Crystal structure determination and refinement,"2.6 Crystal structure determination and refinement Details of crystal analysis, data collection and structure refinement data for [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1) is given in Table 1 . Single crystal data collections were performed with an automated Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer using graphite monochromatized Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 °C. Reflection data were recorded using the ω scan technique. The data were integrated using the SAINT [48] program, and the absorption corrections were made with SADABS [48]. The structure was solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 using the SHELXL-2016/6 program [49]. All data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, and the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were included in the refinement process as per the riding model. The electron density map also showed the presence of some unassignable peaks, which were removed by SQUEEZE method [50]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and spectral characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and spectral characterization The Rh(III)-phosphine complex, [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1) was synthesized by the reaction of RhCl3, 2-(benzylthio)-N-(pyridine-2-ylmethylene)aniline (L-CH2Ph) and excess PPh3 in acetonitrile under refluxing condition (scheme 1 ). The colour of the reaction mixture was changed from red to green. In the course of the reaction benzylic CS bond of thioether containing L-CH2Ph ligand is cleaved and L binds to the rhodium(III) centre using pyridyl-N, imine-N and thiophenolato-S atoms. The complex was thoroughly characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. In IR spectra, the free ligand (L-CH2Ph) stretching at 1621 cm−1 and 776 cm−1 corresponding to imine υ(CN) and υ(CS) are shifted to 1584 cm−1 and 747 cm−1 in the complex supporting the coordination of the ligand to the metal. The 1H NMR peak at 4.16 ppm corresponding to benzylic protons (–CH2) is absent in metal complex indicating the CS bond cleavage (experimental section). The singlet peak corresponding to imine proton (HC = N) appears at 8.78 ppm. Aromatic protons appeared as multiplet due to the presence of PPh3 group. The overlapping of many proton resonances due to their similar chemical shifts has prevented identification of individual proton signals of the aromatic protons; though the spectra shows the calculated number of equivalent aromatic protons. The solution spectrum of the rhodium(III) complex, [Rh(PPh3)(L)Cl2] (1) in dichloromethane exhibits low energy peak at 650 nm (ε, 1230 M−1cm−1) along with two moderately intense bands at 333 (ε, 8751 M−1cm−1) and 267 nm (ε, 25328 M−1cm−1) (Fig. 1 ). In addition, a low energy band as shoulder is also appeared at 479 nm. Upon excitation at 333 nm, an emission band at 432 nm with emission quantum yield (ϕ) = 0.015 is observed in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 2 ). Lifetime data of the complex was taken at 298 K in CH2Cl2 solution when excited at 370 nm. The fluorescence decay curve was deconvoluted with respect to the lamp profile. The observed florescence decay fits with bi-exponential nature (Fig. 3 ). We have used mean fluorescence lifetime (τf = a1τ1 + a2τ2, where a1 and a2 are relative amplitude of decay process) to study the excited state stability of the complex. The fluorescence lifetime of the complex is found to be 1.57 ns."
10,Molecular structure,"3.2 Molecular structure Single crystals of 1 were grown by layering n-hexane and dichloromethane solution of the complex. Selected bond distances and bond angles of the complex are summarized in Table 2 . The molecular structure with atomic numbering is represented in Fig. 4 . After cleavage of benzyl fragment, the uninegative ligand binds in a tridentate fashion through pyridyl-N, imine-N and thiophenolato-S atoms to the rhodium(III) center. The geometry about rhodium(III) is significantly deviated from ideal octahedron. The deviation of coordination sphere from ideal octahedron is reflected from small bite angles of the five membered chelate rings, Rh1-N1-C5-C6-N2, 79.99(6)° and Rh1-N2-C7-C8-S1, 86.28(4)°. The Rh-N(pyridyl) bond, Rh1-N1, 2.1076(15) Å is much more elongated than the Rh-N(imine) bond distance, Rh1-N2, 2.0001(14) Å, while the reverse Re-N bond distances was reported previously [51]. The Rh1-S1 bond distance, 2.3054(5) Å is comparable to the reported Rh-S bond distances [52–54]. Rh1-Cl1 and Rh1-Cl2 bond lengths are found to be 2.3521(5) and 2.4353(5) Å respectively. A 2D supramolecular structure is formed by inter-molecular π…π interactions between phenyl ring (Cg(4): C7-C8-C9-C10-C11-C12) and pyridyl ring (Cg(3): N1-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5) of the adjacent molecule with Cg-Cg distance of 3.7462(14) Å. In addition, strong intra-molecular π…π interactions are found between phenyl ring of the ligand (Cg(4)) and one of the phenyl ring of PPh3 (Cg(5): C13-C14-C15-C16-C17-C18) with Cg-Cg distance of 3.7527(14) Å (Fig. 5 )."
11,DFT calculation and electronic structure,"3.3 DFT calculation and electronic structure The geometry of the 1 and the oxidized form, 1+ were optimized to interpret the electronic structures in native as well as in the oxidized sate by DFT/B3LYP method. The optimized bond distances and angles are well correlated with the X-ray crystal structure data in the native state. Upon oxidation, significant change in Rh1-S1 bond distance is observed (Table 2). The energy and compositions of selected molecular orbitals of 1 are summarized in Table 3 . Contour plots of selected molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 6 . The higher energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) has 90% contribution of L (S, 53%) along with reduced contribution (06%) of dπ(Rh). The HOMO-1 to HOMO-4 have major contribution of pπ(Cl) orbitals (61–89%) along with significant contribution of dπ(Rh) orbitals. The low lying virtual orbital, LUMO has 95% π*(L) character while LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 have significant contribution of dπ(Rh) orbitals. The HOMO to LUMO energy gap in the complex is found to be 2.23 eV. To understand the electronic structure in the oxidized state (1+ ), we have considered the effect in changes in the energies and compositions of molecular orbitals of the complex in the oxidized form. Energy and composition of selected molecular orbitals are summarized in Table S1 and Table S2 for α and β spin respectively. The contour plots of selected molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 for α and β spin respectively. The Spin density of the oxidized species is well distributed on the ligand with major contribution of S atom (63%) (Fig. 7 )."
12,TDDFT calculation and electronic spectra,"3.4 TDDFT calculation and electronic spectra The solution spectrum of 1 in dichloromethane exhibits peaks at 650 nm (ε, 1230 M−1cm−1) along with a sloulder at 479 nm. In addition, two moderately intense bands at 333 (ε, 8751 M−1cm−1) and 267 nm (ε, 25328 M−1cm−1) are observed (Fig. 1). To interpret the electronic transitions in the complex, TDDFT calculation was carried out by TDDFT/CPCM method in dichloromethane. The band at 650 nm corresponds to the HOMO → LUMO transition (λ = 666 nm; f = 0.034) having ILCT character (Table 4 ). The peak appeared as shoulder at 479 nm has mixed XLCT (halogen to ligand charge transfer transition) and MLCT (metal to ligand charge transfer transitions) character. The high energy band at 333 nm corresponds to the π(L) → π*(L) transition (ILCT) in the complex."
13,Electrochemistry,"3.5 Electrochemistry The electrochemical behavior of the complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solvent using tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6) (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The complex exhibits a reversible oxidation couple with E1/2, 0.68 V (ΔE = 88 mV) along with an irreversible reduction peak at −1.09 V in the potential range of −1.5 to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode (Fig. 8 ). The oxidation couple may be assigned to Rh(III)/Rh(IV) oxidation in the complex [55,56]. But the composition of HOMO of the complex has 90% ligand character with major contribution of pπ(S) orbitals (53%). So, we may consider the ligand centered oxidation on thiophenolato-S to form thiyl radical in the complex [14,15,17]. The irreversible cathodic peak at −1.09 V may corresponds to the reduction of coordinated ligand (L) as the composition of LUMO has 95% π*(L) character in the complex. Moreover, for better understand the oxidation process in the complex, we have calculated the Mulliken atomic charges by DFT/B3LYP method of 1 and 1+ (Table 5 ). Mulliken atomic charges of 1 and 1+ species clearly show that there is significant enhancement of positive charge on S atom compared to rhodium atom in 1+ . Again, the possibility of formation of thiyl radical is further supported by the 63% spin density on S atom in comparison to 3% on rhodium in 1+ (Fig. 7). So, the oxidation is assigned as thiophenolato to thiyl radical formation over the minor possibility of Rh(III)/Rh(IV) process in the complex. The electronically generated oxidized species by extensive bulk electrolysis at constant potential at 0.7 V exhibits sharp changes in the UV–VIS-NIR spectra. The low energy band at 655 nm in the native state is red shifted and observed at 766 nm. In addition, a new band at 564 nm is developed during oxidation (Fig. 1)."
14,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions,"3.6 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions Rhodium complex mediated transfer hydrogenation reactions are discovered to be very effective catalytic systems in which hydrogen is transferred from one organic molecule to another molecule. The present Rh(III) complex 1 was taken as catalyst and the catalytic activity in transfer hydrogenation of different aromatic and aliphatic ketones in presence of i PrOH and KOH as promoter was carried out. The transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was standardized with the variation of base, catalyst loading, reaction time, temperature and results are summarized in Table 6 . When the amount of catalyst increased from 0.10 to 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 mol%, the yields of 1-phenylethyl alcohol were increased from 72 to 85, 94 and 98% respectively. Further, the reaction was carried out in absence of catalyst 1 and with RhCl3. In both the cases no significant catalytic conversions were observed. With the increase of reaction time from 1 to 6 h, the yield was increased from 51 to 98%. Reaction time was also played a vital role, with the increase of temperature from 40 to 80 °C the yields of 1-phenylethyl alcohol increased from 25 to 98%. The bases play a significant role in transfer hydrogenation reaction and without any base the reaction was hardly proceeded. In the catalytic cycle, probably the Rh-Cl bond is cleaved and formation of new intermediate complex having Rh-H bond is taking place which is then effectively reduced the ketones to their corresponding alcohols [31]. In general, the catalytic conversion of transfer hydrogenation reactions is strongly dependent on the base strength – the stronger the bases higher the yields [57–59]. In present case, reaction was proceeded very well with strong base (KOH), while for weak bases like Na2CO3 and NaOAc, the yields were very poor. In recent years we have successfully synthesized several rhodium(III)-triphenylphospine complexes and explored their catalytic efficiency towards transfer hydrogenation of ketones, a moderate to high catalytic conversions (85–98%) were observed under optimum reaction conditions [19–21]. Kühn et al. observed 86–100% yields for heterocyclic carbine rhodium(I) complexes [60]. Karakaş and co-workers used ionic liquid based R(I) complexes as efficient catalysts and observed 90–99% yields [61]. The results of transfer hydrogenation by the present Rh(III) complex 1 under are summarized in Table 7 . For aliphatic ketones like 2-butanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone and cyclooctanone the converstions to their corresponding alcohols were achieved to 89–96%. While for aromatic ketones with electron donating or withdrawing groups excellent yields were observed (96–98%)."
15,Conclusion,"Herein, we have synthesized new rhodium(III) complex, [Rh(L)(PPh3)Cl2] (1) by CS bond cleavage of thioether containg ligand, L-CH2Ph. The complex is thoroughly characterized by several spectroscopic techniques and the distorted octahedral geometry is confirmed by single crystal X-ray study. The complex exhibits ligand based thiophenolato to thiyl radical oxidation over the alternate possibility of Rh(III)/Rh(IV) process. The complex effectively catalyzed the transfer hydrogenation reaction of ketones with moderate to high yields (89–98%) in i PrOH. Electronic structure, solution spectrum and redox properties are well interpreted by DFT and TDDFT calculations."
