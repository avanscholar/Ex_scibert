0,Introduction,"Enantiomerically pure compounds have become the focus of research today. They are important building blocks in the production of fine chemicals for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and food ingredients [1]. In recent years, chiral polymers and chiral electronics are a fast-growing market with a brand new range of attractive products and applications [2]. Chiral alcohols are especially widely used as intermediates for the introduction of chiral information into the product [3]. Chiral alcohols have been prepared by asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral ketones using ruthenium complexes [4] or boron compounds [5]. The asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to aldehydes in the presence of chiral ligands has also generated a large number of enantiopure alcohols [6]. But in the last decades, the interest for creating stereogenic centers by applying biocatalytic methods has risen [7]. The oxido-reductases can catalyze the stereoselective reduction of prochiral ketones for synthesis of enantiopure alcohols [3]. Lipase-catalyzed reactions have been applied to solve a number of various synthetic problems, one of which is the kinetic resolution of diastereomeric and enantiomeric mixtures of racemic alcohols [8]. Conversely to oxido-reductases, lipases are serine hydrolases that do not require cofactors nor catalyze side reactions [9]. Lipases are the most widely applied enzymes for the regioselective and enantioselective biotransformations, because they are inexpensive, stable, and easy to recycle [8]. They also possess wide substrate specificity and catalyze many reactions in aqueous and non-aqueous media [10]. Lipase catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols can be performed via acylation with different acyl donors such as carboxylic acids, esters and anhydrides. To date, a large variety of lipases have been reported for such purposes. In particular, lipase B from Candida antarctica is the most robust enzyme with high catalytic efficiency in the resolution. However, the high cost of this immobilized lipase severely limits its use for commercial purposes [11]. Serratia marcescens can secrete an extracellular lipase. This lipase is stable in some organic solvents and applicable to the asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds [12]. One well-known example is the production of (2R, 3S)-3-(4′-methoxyphenyl) glycidic acid methyl ester [(−)-MPGM], a key intermediate for the synthesis of diltiazem hydrochloride, from trans-3-(4′-methoxyphynyl) glycidic acid methyl ester [(±)-MPGM] [13–15]. The other example is its use for kinetic resolution of racemic flurbiprofen or ketoprofen, giving optically pure (S)-flurbiprofen or ketoprofen with very high enantioselectivtiy [16,17]. Jaeger et al. tried to use this lipase for the kinetic resolution of other racemic esters such as isopropylideneglycerol acetate in organic solvent but the reactions were failed [18]. However, there is no report about its application in kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols until today. The lipase genes from S. marcescens had been cloned and expressed in E. coli [17,19,20]. But most of S. marcescens lipase (SmL) genes were expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, which accounted for as much as 70% of the target protein [18,21]. Recently, we found the S. marcescens H30, a Gram-negative organism previously used for efficient production of 2, 3-butanediol in our lab [22], could produce lipase during the culture. In the present study, we cloned and functionally expressed the lipase from S. marcescens H30 in soluble form in E. coli. The kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols was carried out using the immobilized recombinant SmL for the first time to evaluate its potential for industrial application."

4,Cloning and functional expression of Serratia marcescens H30 lipase gene in E. coli,"2.3 Cloning and functional expression of Serratia marcescens H30 lipase gene in E. coli According to the reported S. marcescens lipase gene sequence [17,19,20], two specific primers, forward 5′-GGTTGAATTCGGCATCTTTAGCTATAAGGA-3′ (EcoRI) and reverse 5′-CCTTGCGGCCGCTAGGCCAACACCACCTGATC-3′ (NotI) were designed. PCR amplifications were performed at 94°C for 4min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 58°C for 1min, and 72°C for 1min, with a final extension step of 8min at 72°C. The PCR product was separated and cloned into pMD19-T and sent to sequence. The obtained SmL gene and pET32a with a Trx tag were digested with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes simultaneously, and ligated to construct the expression vector pET32a-SmL, then transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET32a-SmL was inoculated into 100mL of LB medium, and grown at 37°C, 200rpm until OD600 reached 0.6–0.8. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5mM for inducing the SmL expression, and cultivation continued for another 10h at 25°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000× g for 10min, resuspended and washed twice with 25mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The cells were disrupted by the ultrasonic cell disruptor (Ningbo Scientz, China) in an ice bath at the power controlled from 200 to 400W, and each circle worked 4s and intermitted 5s, continued 20min. The disrupted cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10min, and the supernatants were used for SmL activity and SDS-PAGE analysis."
5,Purification and immobilization of the recombinant SmL,"2.4 Purification and immobilization of the recombinant SmL The supernatant of the recombinant E. coli cell lysate was loaded onto Ni-NTA agarose affinity resin (Qiagen, USA) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (200mM NaCl; 25mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0; 10mM imidazole). Weakly bound protein was eluted from the column by washing twice with buffer B (200mM NaCl; 25mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0; 20mM imidazole). Pure protein was eluted with elution buffer C (200mM NaCl; 25mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0; 80mM imidazole). The pure protein fractions were combined and ultra-filtrated by Amicon Ultra-15 (10K) centrifugation devices for removing imidazole. All the carriers were treated as the suppliers’ instruction before immobilization. Generally, different carriers (5g) were added to 50mL purified lipase solution in 250mL screw capped glass vial, and the mixtures were stirred at 25°C and 200rpm in an orbital shaker. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined at intervals. The immobilized lipase particles were filtered and washed firstly with deionized water for three times, then thoroughly with 25mM pH 8.0 Tris–HCl buffer. The immobilized lipases were taken to assay their activities. The immobilization yield and activity recovery were calculated."
6,"Determination of protein content, SDS-PAGE and lipase activity analysis","2.5 Determination of protein content, SDS-PAGE and lipase activity analysis The protein content in the samples was determined by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [23]. The protein expression was analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli [24]. The lipase activity was determined by alkali titration method using olive oil as the substrate [25]."
7,General procedure for LH-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed resolution of racemic alcohols,"2.6 General procedure for LH-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed resolution of racemic alcohols A certain molar ratios of racemic alcohol and acyl donor such as vinyl butyrate in an organic solvent (5mL) was mixed with appropriate amount of immobilized lipase in a 25mL screw capped vial in a thermostatted shaker. The reaction was monitored and the ee assessed by HPLC analysis on the chiral columns as stated in the HPLC Analysis section. Aliquots (50μL) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at intervals, diluted with n-hexane/2-propanol (9:1, 450μL), centrifuged and the supernatant (10μL) was then injected onto the column."
8,HPLC analysis,"2.7 HPLC analysis Transesterification reactions were monitored at 210nm and 254nm by chiral HPLC on a Chiralcel OD column or OB-H column (4.6mm i.d.×250mm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) by using n-hexane/2-propanol as eluent. The liquid chromatograph employed was an Agilent 1100 instrument equipped with a DAD detector. The temperature of the column was maintained at 20°C. The enantiomers were separated well enough for the accurate determination of the ee values on either of the columns by choosing an appropriate proportion of n-hexane/2-propanol for each compound (mainly 90:10, 95:5 or 97:3, v/v). The enantiomeric ratio E was calculated using E =ln[(1− c) (1−eeS)]/ln[(1− c)(1+eeS)] where c and eeS represent the extent of conversion and the ee of the unreacted alcohol substrate, respectively."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Cloning and functional expression of the Serratia marcescens H30 lipase gene in E. coli,"3.1 Cloning and functional expression of the Serratia marcescens H30 lipase gene in E. coli A band of 1848bp length was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens H30 using the specific primers. The full-length lipase gene motif encodes a polypeptide of 615 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of near 65kDa. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of S. marcescens H30 lipase share 95–98% identities and 97–99% identities with lipases from S. marcescens Sr41, S. marcescens SM6, S. marcescens ES-2 and S. marcescens ECU1010, respectively [17,19,20,26]. S. marcescens lipase genes were often expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, which need be refolded to give functionally active lipase. In order to fulfill the soluble expression of S. marcescens H30 lipase in E. coli, the pET32a with a Trx tag was chosen to construct the recombinant plasmid pET32a-SmL. The recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET32a-SmL were cultivated in LB medium at 25°C for 10h after inducing by adding IPTG. The lipase expression result was shown in Fig. S1. It could be found that the lipase was mainly expressed in soluble form in the supernatant (Fig. S1, lane 4), which accounted for about more than 80% of the target protein. Fusion expression of S. marcescens H30 lipase gene with the Trx tag of pET32a obviously improved the solubility. The lipase activity in the supernatant was also determined to be about 5000U/L. The recombinant lipase expression was affected by some physical and chemical factors such as inducing temperature, inducing time, the concentration of IPTG and the concentration of Ca2+. These factors were further optimized to enhance the production of lipase. It was found that Ca2+ showed a profound effect, and 5mmoL/L of CaCl2 could increase the lipase activity for 1.6-fold (Fig. S2). After optimization, the lipase activity was enhanced to about 25,000U/L when induced by 0.8mmoL/L of IPTG at 25°C for 12h with addition of 5mmoL/L of CaCl2."
11,Purification and immobilization of the recombinant SmL,"3.2 Purification and immobilization of the recombinant SmL Based on the terminal 6×His affinity tag, the recombinant lipase was purified with different concentrations of imidazole (50mM, 80mM, 100mM, and 200mM). More than 80mM of imidazole could produce high purity recombinant lipase (data not shown). The main disadvantage of using free lipase in industrial applications is the cost of enzyme. Enzyme immobilization can overcome this problem by reutilizing the enzyme. Many supports have been used for immobilizing various lipases. Several methods for immobilizing the lipase from S. marcescens had already been investigated. However, low loading capacity and high cost of carrier associated with these methods imposed restrictions on the practical use in industry [27]. Five carriers, including D201, D301, D315, LH-HA, and LH-EP which are all homemade and cheap, were chosen to immobilize the purified recombinant SmL. As shown in Table 1 , LH-EP was the best carrier, which gave the highest activity recovery of 51% with the highest specific activity of 214U/g. The other four carriers (D201, D301, D315 and LH-HA) showed lower activity recovery and specific activity, although the immobilization yields of D301 and LH-HA were also more than 60%. LH-EP is an epoxy resin that is accessible and economically advantageous, which also makes it to be fit for immobilizing the SmL."
12,LH-EP immobilized SmL-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols,"3.3 LH-EP immobilized SmL-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols As it may be useful for kinetic resolution of other chiral compounds, we tried to use the LH-EP immobilized SmL for resolution of racemic alcohols. Initially, 4-phenyl-2-butanol (1) was chosen as a model alcohol, and the LH-EP immobilized SmL-catalyzed transesterification of 1 with the acyl donor vinyl butyrate was investigated as a model reaction (Scheme 1 ). The immobilized SmL could enantioselectively catalyze the transesterification of racemic 4-phenyl-2-butanol to the corresponding (R)-butyl ester, whereas no (S)-butyl ester was detected in the reaction media (Fig. S3). This R-enantioselectivity is the same as that in hydrolysis of trans-3-(4-methoxyphynyl) glycidic acid methyl ester [(±)-MPGM] (17, 27), and accords with that proposed by Kazlauskas rule [28]. This is the first attempt of using lipase from S. marcescens for resolution of racemic alcohols. The effects of prime reaction parameters on the model reaction were investigated to further characterize the LP-EP immobilized SmL. 3.3.1 Effect of temperature Enzymes being protein in nature are sensitive to temperature. Higher temperature would lead to lower enantioselectivity of lipase, and thus the effect of temperature was deliberated. The result was shown in Table 2 . A relatively high conversion yield occurred between 35 and 50°C. A high E value was also maintained at temperatures between 25 and 45°C, yet decreased significantly at higher temperature (50°C). The optimal temperature for the kinetic resolution of racemic 4-phenyl-2-butanol was 45°C, which gave a conversion yield of 47.9% and a higher ees of 95.7%. 3.3.2 Effect of reaction solvents In nonaqueous biocatalysis, the reaction medium shows significant influence on the lipase activity and enantioselectivity. Organic solvents are the most often used nonqueous reaction medium. Solvents with low log P values are more hydrophilic, and they tend to strip away the water molecules present on the surface of the lipase, which will reduce the catalytic activity of lipase. Solvents with high log P values can stabilize lipase to some degree. Considering these effects of solvents, eight organic solvents with different log P were assessed as the reaction medium for the LP-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed resolution of 4-phenyl-2-butanol. Both the reaction rate and enantioselectivity were affected largely by the solvents employed (Table 3 ). The reactions were retarded to a great extent in solvents with lower log P such as dioxane and chloroform. Hydrophobic solvents with log P more than 3 gave higher conversion and E value. The best result was achieved in n-hexane, and thus it was used for the rest of the study. 3.3.3 Effect of water activity Water has many effects on lipase catalyzed enantioselective reactions, as water could be simultaneously a competitive and an enantioselective inhibitor, a competitive substrate and a lubricant [29]. The dependence of water activity of the lipases is different. The LH-EP immobilized SmL, the substrates and the reaction medium were separately adjusted to the desired water activity (a w) in sealed containers for at least 2 days with the vapor phase of saturated salt solutions of known a w (0.97, 0.75, 0.53, 0.33, 0.23, 0.11). The LP-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed transesterification resolution of 4-phenyl-2-butanol was investigated at different initial a w. As shown in Table 4 , the reaction rate and enantioselectivity increased along with the decrease of a w from 0.97 to 0.33, and attained the maximum at a w of 0.33, then decreased with the further decrease of a w. Excessive water may stimulate the competing hydrolysis reaction. However, too little water may lead to the short of lipase flexibility. 3.3.4 Effect of acyl donors The effect of the acyl donors on the reaction rate and enantioselectivity of the acyl transfer was subsequently investigated. Enol esters are currently the most widely used acylating agents for resolving racemic alcohols due to their high reactivity, irreversibility and selectivity. For the acylation of racemic 4-phenyl-2-butanol catalyzed by LH-EP immobilized SmL in n-hexane, five acyl donors with different carbon chain length were investigated. The carbon chain length of acyl donor influenced the conversion rate and enantioselectivity of the kinetic resolution (Table 5 ). High conversion rate could be reached with the chain length of acyl donor more than C4 (Table 5). Vinyl butyrate and vinyl octanoate proved to be good acyl donors for providing good conversion rate and high E values (Table 5). 3.3.5 Effect of substrate molar ratio To ensure that the resolution reaction proceeds rapidly and completely, the lipase should not be inhibited by substrate concentration. Various substrate molar ratios (2:1–1:12) were performed to test their effects on the kinetic resolution. As shown in Table 6 , the conversion increased with the increasing of molar ratio from 1:2 to 4:1, then dropped a little when molar ratio increased to 12:1. The changing trend of ees was the same as that of conversion. The E value was always more than 200 at all of molar ratios. Comparatively speaking, molar ratio of 4:1 gave the best results in conversion, ees and E value. 3.3.6 Kinetic resolution of various racemic alcohols by LH-EP immobilized SmL In order to investigate the general applicability of the developed LH-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed resolution methodology, it was used to resolve other structure similar racemic alcohols. The 2-phenyl-1-butanol and 1-phenyl-2-propanol were likewise converted into the (R)-esters with high conversion rate and complete enantioselectivity. However, the α-phenethyl alcohol proved to be not a very appropriate substrate with a conversion rate and ees of only 32.7% and 48.6%, respectively (Table 7 ). These results showed that the position of chiral center affect the resolution process to some extent."
13,Conclusions,"The lipase gene from S. marcescens H30 was cloned and expressed in E. coli in soluble form successfully. After optimization, the lipase activity was enhanced to 25,000U/L from an initial level of 5000U/L. LH-EP carrier gave the best immobilization effect with an activity recovery of 51%. The LH-EP immobilized SmL was then used to catalyze resolution of racemic alcohols. The optimized resolution conditions were 45°C, n-hexane as reaction medium, initial a w of 0.33, and the molar ratio of vinyl butyrate to 4-phenyl-2-butanol of 4:1. Under these conditions, high E value of more than 200, eeS of more than 99% and a conversion of 49.9% were achieved. LH-EP immobilized SmL could also catalyze the kinetic resolution of other structure similar racemic alcohols. These results indicate that the SmL is a useful biocatalyst for production of chiral alcohols."
