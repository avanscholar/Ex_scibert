0,Introduction,"For many years, photocatalysis has been associated to environmental remediation processes, characterized by the action of highly unselective species capable of mineralizing organic contaminants in liquid or in gas phase. More recently, and mostly motivated by the ever-increasing demand for energetic and environmental sustainability in chemical processes, we assisted to a paradigm shift, with photocatalysis being considered as a potential technology to be used in highly selective processes, including organic synthesis [1] and fuels production [2]. The advantages of using photocatalysis in such processes are massive, namely the possibility of being carried out under mild operation conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), the use of water as solvent, and sunlight or low energy consumption radiation sources (as light emitting diodes, LEDs) for reaction activation [1,3]. Yet, in what concerns organic synthesis, the limited selectivity (especially when using water as solvent and oxygen as oxidant), the use of solutions at relatively low concentrations, and the need of using UV light to activate the majority of the photocatalysts are still considered drawbacks. One of the most challenging routes to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic syntheses, especially when considering solar-driven applications, is the design of photocatalysts with improved visible light absorption. Graphite-like carbon nitride (here denoted as GCN) is a metal-free semiconductor with a band gap of 2.7 eV, corresponding to an optical absorption wavelength of 460 nm [4,5]. In addition to its chemical and thermal stability, GCN also possesses suitable valence and conduction bands (VB and CB, respectively) for several redox reactions [5,6]. Pristine GCN presents a stacked 2D layered structure formed through sp2 hybridization of carbon and nitrogen atoms bounded by van der Waals forces [5]. This specific arrangement of carbon and nitrogen atoms promotes a π-conjugated structure, responsible for the photocatalytic activity of GCN [4]. GCN-based catalysts have been successfully applied in several photocatalytic processes, as the degradation of pollutants [7,8], water-splitting [9], bacteria disinfection [10] and synthesis of fine chemicals [11–13] and fuels [14,15]. Nevertheless, this material also suffers from high electron/hole recombination rate, low surface area and lack of activity above 460 nm [4,5]. It has been reported that the synthesis of GCN materials through copolymerization of conventional precursors (urea, melamine, cyanamide, dicyandiamide) with organic molecules, such as cyclodextrin [16], barbituric acid [17], 4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine [18], and porphyrins [19], promote an extended delocalization of π electrons resulting in material with improved photocatalytic properties [4]. Citric acid (CA) is a weak acid commonly used as precursor to synthesize carbon-containing materials [20–22]. The copolymerization of CA with GCN precursors, as melamine and urea, has been reported to originate materials with improved optical, structural and textural features, successfully applied as capacitors, sensors and photocatalysts [20,23]. p-Anisaldehyde (4-methoxybenzaldehyde) is an aromatic aldehyde, widely used in food, beverages, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [24,25]. The current industrial method used for the synthesis of p-anisaldehyde is based in the oxidation of p-cresol methyl ether, from the p-cresol methylation, in the presence of manganese dioxide or other oxidizing agents, such as potassium dichromate or permanganate, and sulfuric acid [25]. The photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes may occur both under oxygenated conditions, with oxygen acting as oxidant [11,26,27], and under deoxygenated conditions, by dehydrogenation of the starting molecule [13,28,29]. In the first case, the presence of reactive oxygen species in the reaction medium increases the rate of the alcohol conversion, yet compromising selectivity [11,26,27]. On the other hand, in the absence of oxygen, the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes using GCN-based catalysts has been reports to undergo via photogenerated holes, with hydrogen atoms being released to the aqueous phase [13,29,30]. Taking the advantage of this feature, in the present work, materials obtained through copolymerization of CA and dicyandiamide were used in the synthesis of p-anisaldehyde (AAD) from p-anisyl alcohol (AA) in water, with simultaneous evolution of hydrogen (H2) under visible-LED irradiation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dicyandiamide (DCN, 99 %), citric acid (CA, ≥ 99.5 %), p-anisaldehyde (AAD, 98 %), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, ≥ 98 %) and chloroplatinic acid hydrate (H2PtCl6.xH2O, 99.9 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formic acid (HCO2H, 98 %) was supplied from Fluka. p-Anisyl alcohol (AA, 98 %) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Methanol (CH3OH, 99.6 %) was purchased from VWR™. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) Aeroxide® P25 powder was supplied by Evonik and used as received. All the reagents were used without further purification. Ultra-pure water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system (≥ 18 MΩ cm−1)."
3,Synthesis of GCN and GCN-based catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of GCN and GCN-based catalyst Bulk GCN was synthetized through thermal decomposition of DCN, at 2 °C min−1 up to 550 °C, as described previously [31]. The obtained yellow solid was then washed with ultra-pure water and dried overnight at 100 °C. The citric acid-modified GCN materials were obtained through thermal co-polymerization of DCN with CA [32]. Briefly, 2 g of DCN was mixed with different amounts of CA (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg). The mixture was placed into a porcelain crucible and subjected to the same thermal treatment than bulk GCN. The obtained brownish solids were washed with ultra-pure water and dried overnight at 100 °C. The catalysts were labeled as GCN-zCA, where z corresponds to the amount of CA (mg) used in the synthesis of each material."
4,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.3 Photocatalyst characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed using a FEI Quanta 400 FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4M (15 keV) instrument. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET ) was determined through the N2 adsorption data at −196 °C in the relative pressure range 0.05–0.20, using a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e apparatus. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) was performed in a Kratos AXIS Ultra HAS equipment and Al monochromator operating at 15 kV (90 W) in hybrid mode. Binding energy values were referred to the C1s peak at 284.4 eV. The obtained spectra were analyzed and deconvoluted using CasaXPS software. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements (4000–600 cm−1) were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-6800 spectrometer (JASCO Analytical Instruments, USA) equipped with a MIRacleTM Single Reflection ATR (attenuated total reflectance ZnSe crystal plate) accessory (PIKE Technologies, USA). The analysis was performed using 256 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The diffuse-reflectance UV–vis (DR UV–vis) analyses were carried out in a JASCO V-560 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (JASCO ISV-469). The direct band gap energy of the photocatalysts was determined from the respective Tauc plot, using (KM.hυ)2 as a function of the energy (hυ, eV). Solid state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrofluorometer (JASCO, FP-8300) equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp, using both excitation and emission band widths fixed at 2.5 nm. The emission spectra were recorded upon excitation at 370 nm in the 390−700 nm range, while the excitation spectra were recorded at different emission wavelengths. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in a PANalytical X’Pert MPD instrument equipped with a X’Celerator detector and secondary monochromator (Cu Ka k =0.154 nm, 50 kV, 40 mA; data recorded at a 0.017° step size, 100 s/step). Photoelectrochemical characterization was performed using an electrochemical workstation ZENNIUM (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) controlled by Thales software package (Thales Z 2.0) in a conventional three electrode cell, using a 99.9 % pure platinum wire (Alfa Aesar, Germany) as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl electrode (Metrohm, Switzerland) as reference electrode. The cell was filled with 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution without additives in which the working electrode was immersed. The working electrode was prepared on F-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass). A mixture containing 5 mg of powder sample (bare GCN or GCN-zCA), 50 μL of Nafion solution 5 wt%, 250 μL isopropanol and 1 mL of deionized water was prepared and left under continuous stirring. The slurry was then spread onto FTO glass with a fixed area using Kapton tape. After air-drying, the electrode was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air to improve adhesion. The on/off photocurrent response plots were measured in ambient conditions and illuminated sunlight provided by a class B solar simulator equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp (Oriel, Newport, USA) and an AM 1.5 G filter (1 kW m−2, 25 °C; Newport, USA) calibrated with a c-Si photodiode (Newport, USA). The transient photocurrent measurements were carried at an applied potential of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl during 1000 s with pulses of 30 s light on followed by 30 s light off."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments All the photocatalytic reactions were performed under visible-LED irradiation (λmax = 420 nm, Fig. SD1) in a four visible-LED system placed at 4 cm of distance from the cylindrical glass reactor wall. The average nominal irradiance of each LED was 45.0 mW cm−2, determined by using a UV–vis spectroradiometer (OceanOptics USB2000 +) equipped with an optical fiber located at 4 cm of the irradiation source. Preliminary studies allowed to set the catalyst load at 0.75 g L-1. All the photocatalytic reactions were performed at room temperature (20 °C), with the continuous saturation with an argon flow. Before illumination, the suspensions were kept stirring for 30 min for establishing adsorption-desorption equilibrium. For the synthesis of AAD, 50.0 mL of an aqueous AA solution (0.50 mM) at natural pH (c.a. 5.4) were continuously irradiated for four hours. The AA and AAD concentrations were periodically monitored by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using a Shimadzu Corporation apparatus equipped with a Diode Array Detector (SPD M20A). A KinetexTM F5 1.7 μm 100 Å column (100 mm x 2.1 mm) was used with a solvent delivery pump (LC-30AD) at a flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1. The temperature of the column oven and autosampler were set at 35 °C and 4.0 °C, respectively. An equilibrated mixture of 0.1 % v/v of formic acid (A) and methanol (B) with volume ratio of 30:70 (A:B) was isocratically eluted for 15 min. The AA and AAD concentration were determined at 226 nm and 282 nm, respectively. The AA conversion (X), and the selectivity (S) and yield (Y) towards AAD production were determined as described elsewhere [52]. During the reutilization experiments, the catalyst was recovered after each reaction by filtration, washed with ultra-pure water and dried overnight at 60 °C. Regarding to the H2 evolution reactions, aqueous solutions of EDTA or AA (0.02 M; 100 mL) were used as sacrificial electron donors. In addition, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (3.0 wt%) synthetized according to the procedure described elsewhere [16] were added to the suspension as co-catalyst. Before irradiation, the reactor was saturated with nitrogen for 30 min to ensure the total removal of oxygen. The suspensions were irradiated for a three hours period and the evolved H2 was measured using an on-line gas chromatograph (Inficon Micro GC 3000, Agilent) equipped with a 5 Å molsieve column and a micro-TCD detector, using argon as carrier gas. The reutilization capacity of the best performing photocatalyst for H2 evolution was also conducted. Herein the system was evacuated before each new cycle of three hours and a certain amount of fresh sacrificial agent was added to the reactor. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the H2 evolution was determined using four low-power LEDs emitting at 420 (±15 nm) with the reactor positioned 4 cm away from the light source (total irradiance of 180 mW cm−2). Aqueous suspensions of GCN and GCN-20CA (75 mg) were irradiated during three hours. The AQY was calculated according to the following equation [33–35]: A Q Y = N e N p × 100 % = 2 × n u m b e r o f H 2 m o l e c u l e s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % where Ne represents the amount of reaction electrons and Np represents the incident photons."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of GCN and GCN-zCA (Fig. SD2), revealed negligible changes in the base structure of GCN, since all catalysts presented similar spectra, with the same characteristic bands: a band at 3000−3500 cm−1, related to the NH and NH2 stretching vibrations of uncondensed amines; two bands at 1500−1700 cm−1 and 1200−1400 cm−1, which are commonly ascribed to the characteristic CN and aromatic CN stretching modes, respectively; and a sharp peak around 800 cm−1, revealing the existence of tris-s-triazine units in the graphitic structure of GCN [31,32,36–38]. From scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1 ) it was observed that pristine GCN presents a highly stacked structure, with solid aggregates of graphite-like layers (Fig. 1a) [12,16,19,39]. SEM micrographs of CA-modified catalysts (Fig. 1b-f), reveal the presence of surface porosity (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 1), suggesting the occurrence of structural defects in the GCN polymeric network [16,37,38]. This holey texture may be attributed to the decomposition of citric acid during the thermal polymerization process, which occurs at temperature between 150 and 250 °C, causing the rupture of the GCN interlayer bonds [40,41]. Although the addition of citric acid resulted in a defective surface, no significant impact was noticed in the specific surface area ( SBET ) of the modified catalysts (< 10 m2 g−1) when compared to bulk GCN (7 m2 g−1). XRD analyses of CA-materials did not evidenced any alteration in their crystallinity comparing with bulk GCN (Fig. SD3, Table SD1). The DR UV–vis spectrum of bulk GCN shows an absorption maximum at 370 nm resulting from the characteristic π-π* transitions owing to the heterocyclic aromatic system, and a sharp edge peaking at c.a. 450 nm (Fig. 2 a) [16,31]. When citric acid was introduced in the synthesis of the GCN-based materials, a change in the color of the resulting catalysts was observed, from yellow (bulk GCN) to brown (GCN-zCA), which is in line with the extended absorption, mostly in the 450–700 nm range (Fig. 2a) [16,32]. The higher the amount of citric acid used in the synthesis, the darker the final material is, with a progressive increase in the absorption tail (Urbach tail, highlighted zone in Fig. 2a) in the visible spectral region [16,32,42,43]. The Urbach tail observed in the DR UV–vis spectra is commonly associated to mid-gap states located within the band gap [16,42,44–46], which are ascribed to n-π* electronic transitions involving the nitrogen lone pairs of electrons in heptazine and s-triazine rings. This may suggest a defective structure of GCN-zCA catalysts [46–48], which may favor the separation of photogenerated electrons (e− )/holes (h+ ), by increasing the lifetime of the charge carriers and prevent recombination [45,46,49]. In addition, the existence of the Urbach tail in the absorption spectra indicates that the materials may absorb photons with lower energy than the band gap energy (Eg ) [16,49,50]. The transition energy (ET ), that is associated to the presence of the Urbach tails (Fig. 2a), was determined through Tauc plot analysis (Fig. 2c). The values of ET decreased from 2.49 eV to 2.35 eV with an increase in the amount of CA (Table 1 ). The values of Eg were also determined through Tauc plot analysis (Fig. 2b). A slightly decrease was noticed from 2.86 eV (bulk GCN) to 2.80 eV (GCN-25CA) (Table 1). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to further evaluate the electronic modifications induced by including CA in the synthesis of GCN materials. PL emission spectra of all materials were obtained upon excitation at 370 nm at room temperature (Fig. 3 a and b), while excitation spectra were recorded with emission wavelength set at 463 and 528 nm (Fig. 3c and d, respectively). The PL emission spectrum of GCN reveals a strong emission peak at 463 nm (Fig. 3a) resulting from direct electron-hole recombination [16,51]. By adding citric acid, the fluorescence intensity is drastically quenched (Fig. 3a), indicating an inhibition in the recombination of electrons and holes. Therefore, the defect sites formed through the addition of citric acid may act as trapping centers, allowing the relocalization of the charge carriers into the carbon nitride skeleton, thus promoting their efficient separation, efficient surface transfer, and improving the photoefficiency of the materials [5]. Upon normalization of the PL emission spectra (Fig. 3b), the modified materials show an increase in the intensity of the emission band with a maximum centered at 528 nm (Fig. 3b, Z1). This more protruding band of the modified materials may be ascribed to the activation of n-π* transitions involving the nitrogen lone pair electrons in the carbon nitride structure, resultant from a distorted structure owing to the presence of defects, as reported in literature [16,51]. These results are consistent with the Urbach tails observed in the DR UV–vis spectra (Fig. 3c, Z2) and with the excitation spectra of GCN and GCN-modified catalysts at 463 and 528 nm (Fig. 3c and d). The excitation spectra of all materials recorded at 463 nm (Fig. 3c) reveal three maxima with wavelengths at 276, 371 and 425 nm. The first two are related with its maximum absorption, while the last is ascribed to the band edge (Fig. 2a). As for the excitation spectra recorded at 528 nm (Fig. 3d), the CA-modified materials present a new excitation band at 488 nm (Fig. 3d, Z3), in addition to the three bands observed in the excitation spectra recorded at 463 nm (Fig. 3c). The new band may be related with the presence of mid-gap states (Fig. 2a) due to the existence of stronger n-π* transitions in modified catalysts that are promoted by nitrogen vacancies and by the porosity induced at the materials surface. The PL results support the assumption of a new electron transfer pathway involving lower-energy photon excitation, in which the migration and separation of the charge carriers to the surface of the catalyst is enhanced. The surface chemistry of bulk GCN and CA-modified GCN catalysts was assessed by XPS analysis (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The XPS survey (data not shown) confirmed that the catalysts are mostly composed of nitrogen and carbon. A minor peak was identified at 530.9 eV, suggesting the presence of residual oxygen from adsorbed water [16,52]. The atomic analysis of the catalysts denoted a slight decrease in the nitrogen content on the surface of all modified catalysts (XPS results, Table 1). On the other hand, no significant variation of C and N atomic contents obtained through elemental analysis (Table SD2) was observed. This feature indicates that morphological and structural changes occurred mainly at the surface of the modified catalysts. Moreover, all GCN-zCA materials present a higher C/N atomic ratio than bulk GCN (Table 1). The increase in the C/N atomic ratio may be ascribed to the presence of nitrogen vacancies in GCN framework rather than C-doping, as determined by comparing the N1/N2 peak ratio in the XPS spectra of bulk and modified GCN materials [53,54]. The deconvolution of the C1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4a) shows four main peaks (C1, C2, C3 and C4) typical of GCN-based materials. The C1 peak, located at 284.4 eV, is commonly attributed to the impurity carbon, as in graphitic domains [7,55–57]. The C2 peak at 286.0 eV is ascribed to the presence of amino functional groups (CNH2) [31,58]. Moreover, the dominant C3 peak (288.0 eV) and the C4 peak (293.5 eV) are assigned to the presence of sp2 hybridized C atoms in N-containing aromatic rings (NCN) [31,37,58] and to the π electron delocalization in heptazine units [37,59,60], respectively. In addition, the N1s spectra (Fig. 4b) can be also deconvoluted in four main peaks (N1, N2, N3 and N4), in which N1 peak at 398.4 eV is generally ascribed to the sp2 -bonded nitrogen involved in heptazine rings (CNC) [37,61]. The N2 (399.2 eV) and N3 peaks (400.9 eV) are attributed to the presence of tertiary N in N(C)3 structures and to NH and NH2 groups, respectively [31,37,61]. The delocalization of positive charges in melon heterocycles is confirmed through the N4 peak at 404.5 eV [31,58]. On the other hand, the C1s and N1s spectra of GCN-zCA materials revealed a shift of C3, N1 and N3 peaks to lower binding energies when compared to bulk GCN, suggesting electrons redistribution on the graphitic ring [16,32,42,43]. The determination of the ratio between N1 and N2 areas can be used to evaluate the extension of structural defects in the CN plane, since in distorted structures, CNC turns into N(C)3 [16,18,49,62,63]. The N1/N2 peak ratio is of 1.74 (GCN), 1.74 (GCN-5CA), 1.61 (GCN-10CA), 1.44 (GCN-15CA), 1.26 (GCN-20CA) and 1.40 (GCN-25CA). The lower the N1/N2 ratio, the highest is the prevalence of nitrogen vacancies at sp2 -bonded nitrogen (N1) [18]. Moreover, it is also possible to verify that the modified catalysts present higher contribution of the N2 peak and lower contribution of the N1 peak than bulk GCN, being also GCN-20CA the catalyst with the highest and lowest value, respectively (Fig. 4b). These observations suggest that GCN-20CA present higher density of nitrogen-vacancy defects than the other modified catalysts [18,49,62,63]."
8,Photocatalytic synthesis of p-anisaldehyde and hydrogen evolution,"3.2 Photocatalytic synthesis of p-anisaldehyde and hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic efficiency of GCN-based materials was assessed through the photocatalytic oxidation of p-anisyl alcohol (AA) to p-anisaldehyde (AAD). Selected materials were also used as photocatalysts for hydrogen (H2) evolution from water splitting. The reactions were performed under deoxygenated conditions and using visible LED radiation (λmax = 420 nm). In the absence of catalyst, light, sacrificial agent or Pt, no production of AAD or hydrogen was verified (data not shown). The rate of AAD production over four hours of reaction using bulk GCN and GCN-zCA materials is depicted in Fig. 5 a. The reactions were also performed using the standard photocatalyst (TiO2) for comparison purposes. As expected, the rate of AAD production obtained with commercial TiO2 is very low compared with the CA-modified materials (Fig. 5a), due to its low absorption in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. On the other hand, the CA-modified GCN materials exhibited enhanced efficiency for AA conversion, keeping the selectivity (S) towards AAD production at >99 % for all catalysts (Fig. 5b). An AA conversion (X) of 22 % after four hours of reaction was obtained using bulk GCN, while this value was increased to 26, 43 and 63 % when CA amounts were incremented from 5 to 10 and 20 mg, respectively (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, a further increase in CA to 25 mg leads to a decrease in AA conversion to 41 %. Among the GCN-based materials, GCN-20CA showed the best efficiency, achieving an AAD yield of 64 % after four hours of irradiation. Reutilization tests revealed that this material is rather stable under the experimental conditions, maintaining the values of AAD conversion and selectivity above 63 % and 90 %, respectively (Fig. 5c). Due to the enhanced performance of GCN-20CA for AAD production, the material was also tested towards hydrogen evolution from water splitting using the same light source (visible-LED; λmax = 420 nm). Platinum nanoparticles were used as standard co-catalyst while EDTA (0.02 M) was initially chosen as sacrificial electron donor. The photocatalytic performance of GCN-20CA was then compared with bulk GCN (Fig. 6 a). As depicted in Fig. 6a, GCN-20CA presents higher rate of H2 production when compared to bulk GCN, duplicating the amount of gas evolved, confirming that the addition of CA improves the efficiency of the catalyst, both for the production of H2 from water splitting (Fig. 6) and for the synthesis of AAD (Fig. 5). Both curves present an initial induction period (∼ 20 min) most probably due to in situ reduction of partially oxidized Pt nanoparticles by photogenerated H2, followed by a linear increase in H2 production corresponding to a steady-state regime. In presence of EDTA and Pt, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of GCN-20CA at 420 nm was estimated to be 0.61 %. It has been reported that, in the absence of oxygen, the conversion of aromatic alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes results from the oxidative dehydrogenation of the alcohol driven by the photogenerated holes, whereas, the H+ is simultaneously converted into H2 by the electrons at the conduction band of the photocatalyst [13,29,30]. In this view, photocatalytic reactions using GCN-20CA as catalyst, Pt nanoparticles as co-catalyst and AA as sacrificial agent for H2 production were performed (Fig. 6b). Nevertheless, the results showed lower photocatalytic efficiency for H2 evolution from aqueous solutions of AA compared with the values obtained with EDTA (23 μmol and 75 μmol evolved after three hours, respectively), which can be ascribed to the high propensity of EDTA to be oxidized [64,65]. Since the reusability and stability of the materials are crucial for the application as photocatalysts, a study was performed using GCN-20CA in consecutive reactions using either EDTA or AA as sacrificial agents (Fig. 6b). For the experiments using EDTA, H2 production was maintained in values between 75 and 86 μmol after three hours of irradiation. For the reactions with AA, the H2 evolution decreased c.a. 40 % from the first to the second run and then maintained the photocatalytic activity with a production of 14 μmol of H2 after four consecutive runs. As the material is recovered, washed, and finally added to a fresh solution of AA, it is possible that some by-products accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, blocking the access to the active sites and thus decreasing its photocatalytic activity. In order to ascertain the photoactivity of the best performing catalyst (GCN-20CA), the transient photocurrent responses of this material and of bulk GCN applied over FTO coated glass substrates were determined at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl during 1000 s with on/off cycles (30 s each) of simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 7 , it is notorious that GCN-20CA produces a higher photocurrent density than the bulk GCN, given by the larger difference (higher gap) between the recorded current response under dark and in light conditions. In fact, when the light was turned on, an improvement on the photocurrent response of c.a. 42 % was registered for GCN-20CA compared to GCN. The latter observation suggested that less recombination and longer lifetimes of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs are achieved for the CA modified material. All the above results on the photocatalytic efficiency of GCN-zCA materials may be rationalized in terms of their intrinsic optical, electronic and structural properties. As previously discussed, the defective surface of GCN-zCA catalysts and their distorted structure lead to an enhancement in light absorption in the whole spectral range (Fig. 2a) [16,17,47,66]. Moreover, GCN-zCA present a slightly lower Eg than bulk GCN, indicating that modified materials may require less energy to undergo photoexcitation. In addition, these materials also presented a notorious decrease in the recombination of e− /h+ pairs, as inferred from the photoluminescence results (Fig. 3a), which can be attributed to their improved properties of charge trapping and transferring, allowing the improvement of their photocatalytic performance [4,5]. It was also observed that the addition of CA during the thermal condensation procedure promoted a reduction in the amount of heptazine units (XPS analysis, Fig.4 ), which are usually associated to the planar structure of GCN materials [67]. By reducing the presence of these units in the GCN matrix, defects are induced on the surface of the catalyst, which are expected to contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the CA-modified materials [32,45,68,69]. As previously discussed, GCN-20CA presents the lowest contribution of heptazine units (lowest N1 peak, Fig. 4), conferring it higher oxidative ability when compared with the other modified catalysts. Moreover, the occurrence of nitrogen vacancies in a higher extent in this particular catalyst (higher C/N atomic ratio and lower XPS N1/N2 peak ratio) may also rationalize its improved photocatalytic performance [53]. Analysis of the XPS valence band of bulk GCN and GCN-20CA (Fig. SD4) shows that the addition of CA induced an up-shift of a c.a. 0.11 eV in the valence band potential of GCN-20CA when compared with bulk GCN (1.82 eV). Taking into account the VB position and the Eg determined through Tauc plot analysis (Table 1), the conduction band (CB) of bulk GCN is situated at -1.04 eV, while that of GCN-20CA shifts to -1.11 eV. Moreover, the mid-gap states position can be estimated considering the transition energy of GCN-20CA (ET = 2.37 eV, Table 1), and the valence band potential obtained from XPS analysis. Due to the n-type semiconductor behavior of GCN-20CA, the mid-gap states are located below the edge of CB [16,46,64] with a position estimated at -0.66 eV (Fig. 8 ). In addition, both CB and mid-gap states of GCN-20CA are more negative than the water reduction potential (0.00 V vs NHE) [70], which indicates that electrons trapped both in CB and mid-gap states contribute for the H2 production. Overall, the high efficiency of GCN-20CA photocatalyst towards both AAD and H2 production may be ascribed to the combination of unique features, namely: i) the existence of structural defects induced by the inclusion of CA during the synthesis procedure; ii) increased light absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (450–700 nm), and iii) improved charge separation efficiency due to the presence of mid-gap states. These features open-up the possibility of using CA-modified GCN catalysts in solar-driven applications, making the production of high-added valued products sustainable from the point of view of process integration and energy conversion."
9,Conclusion,"Graphite-like carbon nitride (GCN)-based photocatalysts were synthetized through co-polymerization of citric acid with dicyandiamide, resulting in polymeric materials with holey texture and nitrogen vacancies. This defective structure enhanced the visible light absorption and photocurrent, and decreased the electron/hole recombination, leading to an enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of GCN-zCA materials when compared to bulk GCN for both p-anisaldehyde and hydrogen production. GCN-20CA was the best performing catalyst in the synthesis of p-anisaldehyde from p-anisyl alcohol, achieving a yield of 63 % at four hours of irradiation, triplicating the yield obtained with bulk GCN (22 %), keeping selectivity at >99 %. The same material revealed to be highly efficient as photocatalyst for hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting, using EDTA as sacrificial electron donor, with a 71 % increase in the total amount of gas generated at the end of three hours of irradiation compared to bulk GCN. The simultaneous production of AAD and H2 from the oxidative dehydrogenation of AA using GCN-20CA as photocatalyst and the stability of this material in consecutive reactions were also demonstrated, which account for the energetic sustainability of this photocatalytic system."
