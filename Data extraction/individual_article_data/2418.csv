0,Introduction,"Water pollution is one of the most critical global environmental problems and has attracted widespread attention. The typical pollutants include heavy metal (such as lead, copper, etc.) and organic pollutants (such as fuel, pheno, amine), mainly from metallurgy, electroplating, textile, pulp and paper, leather and fine chemicals (Wasi, Tabrez, & Ahmad, 2013). Wastewater treatment is a systematic project, which brings high cost to production and life (Nasrollahzadeh, Sajjadi, Iravani, & Varma, 2021). Therefore, the development of efficient and economic solutions for wastewater treatment has been widely concerned all over the world. The adsorption technique with inexpensive and efficient materials is considered as a simple and economical solution for the pollution removal from wastewater (Hu, Deng, & Chen, 2017; Qu et al., 2021). The adsorbent is the key of the adsorption technique, which should have excellent adsorption capacity, suitable for various pollutants, easy to recycle (Crini, 2005; Wu, Chen, Yuan, & Fu, 2020). Various adsorbents have been developed for wastewater purification, including activated carbon (Kharrazi, Mirghaffari, Dastgerdi, & Soleimani, 2020; Li et al., 2020), diatomaceous earth (Salih & Ghosh, 2018; Zhao et al., 2019), sponge (Chen et al., 2018), zeolite (Deravanesiyan, Beheshti, & Malekpour, 2015), graphene (Gu, Fan, Li, Caro, & Meng, 2019) and porous gel (Guo et al., 2019). In which, 3D porous gel materials have attracted extensive attention as adsorbent materials due to its wide source of raw materials and simple design based on different performance requirements (Mondal, 2016). The cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) is one dimensional nanomaterials generally with the diameter of 5–50 nm and the length of several micrometers, and easily be obtained from cellulose which is the most abundant renewable natural polymer material on the earth (Salas, Nypelo, Rodriguez-Abreu, Carrillo, & Rojas, 2014; Zhu, Chen, Wu, & Lin, 2019). Due to excellent inherent physical and chemical properties, including high tensile strength and elastic modulus, low density, and high specific surface area, its combination of biodegradable and reproducible active surfaces (Moon, Martini, Nairn, Simonsen, & Youngblood, 2011), CNFs have broad application prospects such as reinforcing fillers (Zheng et al., 2018), biomedical materials (Basu, Heitz, Stromme, Welch, & Ferraz, 2018), optical materials (Fang et al., 2014) and energy storage materials (Nystrom et al., 2015). CNFs tends to form 3D network structure at low concentrations (2 wt%) due to the hydrogen bonding between the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface (Kargarzadeh, Ioelovich, Ahmad, Thomas, & Dufresne, 2017). The properties of CNFs gels can be further improved by some strategies. For example, the spatial network framework can be significantly enhanced by freeze thawing or chemical crosslinking (Mi et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2016). Gel properties can be regulated by introduction of chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol or other polymers (Wu et al., 2019; Zhou, Fu, Zhang, Zhan, & Levit, 2014). The surface of CNFs can be modified by some chemical methods to make CNFs based gels have a variety of functions (Rol, Belgacem, Gandini, & Bras, 2019). In recent years, CNFs based gels have shown promising application prospects in wastewater treatment due to its non-toxicity, biodegradability, widely sources of raw materials, excellent adsorption capacity and no secondary pollution (Bisla, Rattan, Singhal, & Kaushik, 2020; De France, Hoare, & Cranston, 2017; Liu, Oksman, & Mathew, 2016; Tang et al., 2018; Zhang, Elsayed, Navarathna, Schueneman, & Hassan, 2019). CNFs/PVA composite gel is a classical gel material, and the gel properties can be regulated by various crosslinking conditions and additive agents (Luo, Ma, Zhou, & Xu, 2021; Zhou, Zhai, Chen, & Xu, 2019). In terms of adsorption, CNFs/PVA composite hydrogels showed good performance for the heavy metal ions (Zhou et al., 2014). The silylated CNFs/PVA composite aerogels showed hydrophobic properties and had excellent adsorption for the weakly polar organic liquid (Zheng, Cai, & Gong, 2014), which is promising application in oil/water separation (Zhai, Zheng, Cai, Xia, & Gong, 2016). However, most of the existing CNFs gels are the block porous materials with edges and corners, that would be inconvenient to use in practical application as that will seriously affect the rheological properties of wastewater. In addition, large block gels have small external contact area with pollutants, which is not conducive to the rapid adsorption of wastewater pollutants. Even if mechanical crushing method was used to achieve small particle size, however, it will seriously damage the mechanical properties and the pore structure of the gels. In contrast, spherical gels synthesized directly by chemical method can solve the above problems. On the premise of achieving high adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of CNFs based gels, it is very necessary for gel spheres to have large size, which is beneficial to be recycled. So the porous gel spheres with millimeter level size are suitable. The inverse suspension polymerization technique is a typical method to prepare polymeric beads with the size from 10 to 2000 μm. In this method, small molecule monomers dissolved in water are usually used as reaction raw materials (Mulani, Patil, Chavan, & Donde, 2019). However, it is a challenge for using polymers as raw materials to synthesize millimeter grade porous gel spheres due to the easy aggregation caused by strong interaction between polymers (Yuan, Kalfas, & Ray, 2011). Zheng prepared successfully the hydrophobic spherical CNFs/PVA composite aerogel by using inverse suspension method at low temperature to produce large frozen hydrogel spheres and then freeze-drying (Zheng et al., 2014). However, low temperature freezing is disadvantageous to industrialization. In this work, an inverse suspension pellet-forming technology based on the polymers as raw materials was developed for the preparation of large spherical CNFs/PVA composite gels. as shown in Fig. 1 . During the process, glutaraldehyde (GA) was used as crosslinker between CNFs and PVA under acidic conditions, just right mechanical stirring and appropriate amount of emulsifier were needed to make the composite hydrogel spheres (CV-HSs) in millimeter size. Moreover, the hydrogel spheres were freeze-dried and then silylated to obtain hydrophobic aerogel spheres (HCV-ASs). Based on these two kinds of gel materials, the adsorption for organic pollutants and heavy metal ions was investigated. The results showed that the two gel materials had good potential for application in wastewater treatment and oil-water separation."

Secondly, the CNFs suspension and PVA solution were mixed and stirred for 10 min with electromechanical agitator, ensuring that the solid content ratio of CNFs and PVA is 3:2. Then a certain quality of 10 wt% GA aqueous solution was added to the above mixture and stirred for another 5 min, the dosage of GA was changed from 1% to 5% based on the solid content of the mixed solution. Thirdly, liquid paraffin for 4 times the weight of aqueous phase and appropriate amount of Span 80 were mixed and stirred evenly as oil phase, the mass ratio of liquid paraffin and Span 80 is 100:2. Fourthly, the oil phase was added into the water phase and continuously stirred for 15 min with a rate of 250 rpm. Then different amounts of 0.5 mol/L hydrochloric acid was slowly added and the reaction was carried out in water bath at 68 °C for 2 h. Finally, the gel spheres were filtered out by a sieve and washed successively by ethanol, ethyl acetate and deionized water for several times."
4,Preparation of HCV-ASs,"2.3 Preparation of HCV-ASs Aerogel spheres were obtained by freeze-drying CV-HSs at −68 °C for 24 h. 200 mg aerogel spheres with crosslinking degree of 3% were contained in an open glass bottle and placed in vacuum dryer, and appropriate amount of MTMS and deionized water (V:V = 1:3) were measured separately in two other open glass vials and also placed in the same vacuum dryer. Then, the vacuum dryer was evacuated, and placed in drying oven at 50 °C for 12 h to obtain the hydrophobic aerogel spheres HCV-ASs."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 The moisture content of hydrogel CV-HSs The freeze-dried gel spheres were swelled in deionized water for 24 h, then taken out and weighed. The moisture content of hydrogel can be obtained by the following formula: (1) S = m t − m 0 m t × 100 % Where m 0 represents the initial weight of the dry gel, g; m t represents the weight of the gel after swelling for 24 h, g. All tests were performed three times in parallel and the average value was taken. 2.4.2 FT-IR analysis The freeze-dried samples were mixed with potassium bromide powder and pressed into tablets, and the FT-IR test was carried out with FTIR-650. The spectra was recorded from 500 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 with 16 scans. 2.4.3 SEM analysis Appropriate amount of freeze-dried gel spheres were taken and then sprayed with gold. The cross-section and structure of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-IT300LV, Japan) with working voltage of 15 kV. 2.4.4 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs were performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA SDT650) at temperature of 40 °C to 600 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. 2.4.5 BET analysis The Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument was used to analyze the specific surface areas of different CV-HSs aerogel spheres and HCV-ASs by low-temperature N2 adsorption method.

6,Adsorption study,"2.5 Adsorption study 2.5.1 Adsorption of Cu2+, phenol and aniline by CV-HSs 0.1 mol/L Cu2+, 2 g/L phenol and 1 g/L aniline solution were prepared and diluted step by step respectively. A certain mass of CV-HSs were placed in 20 mL Cu2+ solution. The adsorption process was oscillated in a thermostatic oscillator for 24 h (160 r/min, 25 °C). Using 0.5 mol/L HCl to adjust the pH of the solution and exploring the influence of different pH on the adsorption process. Atomic absorption analyzer (TAS-990) was used to measure the Cu2+ concentration before and after adsorption, and the adsorption amount of Cu2+ by CV-HSs was calculated based on the concentration difference before and after adsorption. The adsorption process of CV-HSs on phenol and aniline was as the same as Cu2+. The difference was that the concentration of phenol and aniline before and after adsorption was measured by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Japan). The adsorption capacity (Q e ) was calculated according to the following formula: (2) Q e = C 0 − C e V m ∙ w Where C 0 is the initial concentration of the adsorption solution, mmol/L; C e is the concentration of the solution when the adsorption reach equilibrium, mmol/L; m is the mass of CV-HSs used as adsorbent, g; w is the solid content of CV-HSs which is the ratio of over dry CV-HSs and CV-HSs swollen well by water, %; The multiplication of m and w is equivalent to the mass of aerogel spheres or solid part of hydrogel spheres CV-HSs; The unit of Q e is mmol/g for Cu2+; The unit of Q e for phenol and aniline was converted to mg/g according to their molecular weight. in this calculation, we use the solid part in the hydrogel spheres as the basis of adsorption. 2.5.2 Adsorption kinetics of Cu2+, phenol and aniline by CV-HSs Under the conditions of T = 25 °C and pH = 6, appropriate mass of CV-HSs gel spheres with 3% cross-linking degree were used to adsorb Cu2+ solution with an initial concentration of 30 mmol/L. The initial concentration of phenol solution and aniline solution were 2800 mg/L and 2000 mg/L respectively. In order to explore the adsorption rate and mechanism, the curve of equilibrium adsorption capacity with time has been measure. 2.5.3 Adsorption of organic solvents by HCV-ASs In order to evaluate the adsorption properties of HCV-ASs to different organic solvents, the maximum adsorption of HCV-ASs to several organic solvents (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and toluen) were investigated. Before that, organic solvents were dyed by using oil-soluble dyes. The maximum adsorption capacity can be calculated according to the following formula: (3) Q = W − W 0 W 0 × 100 % Where W 0 and W are the weight of HCV-ASs before and after absorption respectively. Each test is measured in parallel three times and averaged."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Preparation of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs,"3.1 Preparation of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs At the beginning, we expected to prepare spherical hydrogels with only CNFs as raw materials. The inverse suspension polymerization method was used for reference. In this process, the water phase containing CNFs, GA and catalytic amount of HCl is dispersed in the oil phase by adjusting the amount of surfactant and stirring speed to form water-in-oil emulsion. Dispersed CNFs with the abundant hydroxyl groups were chemically crosslinked by GA under acidic conditions to form porous hydrogel. However, no spherical hydrogel with good dispersion was generated although a large number of experiments were investigated, instead, the fragments or adhesive blocks were obtained. The reason may be that CNFs cannot curl as easily as single chain polymers due to the crystalline properties of cellulose, which makes it difficult to form dispersed spheres during emulsification and crosslinking. Therefore, the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which also contains abundant hydroxyl groups but has good crimping property, was selected to composite with CNFs. It was found that when the dry weight ratio of PVA to CNFs is 3:2 and the total solid content is 0.46%, the hydrogels with good sphericity can be obtained. In this reaction, the oil phase is liquid paraffin and the emulsifier is Span 80. On this basis, we explored the effect of the amount of crosslinker GA on the size and pore structure of the spherical hydrogel. The results showed that the diameter of the hydrogel sphere CV-HSs decreased from 3 mm to 1 mm when the amount of crosslinker increased from 1% to 5%, as shown in Fig. 2 . Moreover, the CV-HSs with 3% crosslinking degree was selected to be lyophilized and then hydrophobically modified to give the hydrophobic aerogel spheres HCV-ASs. In which, the hydrophobic modification was carried out by using MTMS as hydrophobic modifier via vapor deposition (Feng, Nguyen, Fan, & Duong, 2015)."
9,Characterization of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs,"3.2 Characterization of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs The moisture content analysis for CV-HSs was summarized in Fig. 3a, which showed that the moisture content of the CV-HSs decreased from 92.67% to 89.27% as the amount of crosslinker increased, indicating that the porosity of the CV-HSs decreased significantly, which is consistent with the variation of the size of the hydrogel spheres with the addition of GA in Fig. 2. The FT-IR results were shown in Fig. 3b. The peak at 1732 cm−1 can be seen in the infrared spectrum of CNFs, CV-HSs and HCV-ASs, which is the stretching vibration peak of CO bond in carboxyl group, indicating that carboxyl groups were introduced into the surface of CNFs under the TEMPO-oxidation pretreatment condition. It is conductive for the adsorption of pollution. The peak at 2850 cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs is a new absorption band which should attributed to stretching vibration of the CH bond in the crosslinked acetal, and the characteristic absorption peak of aldehyde group in glutaraldehyde disappears at 2720 cm−1, which means that it is successfully crosslinked through acetal structure. The characteristic peaks related to MTMS can be seen in the infrared spectrum of HCV-ASs. The peak near 1272 cm−1 is CH bending vibration in the silane group, and the peak around 780 cm−1 is SiC or SiO bond stretching vibration peak, indicating the successful silylation of aerogel. The contact angle of HCV-ASs with water is 141° as shown in Fig. S2, which proves HCV-ASs has good hydrophobicity. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs were shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d. The results showed that the decomposition of CV-HSs mainly consists of three stages, the first fast decomposition at 240 °C corresponds to the removal process of hydroxyl on the surface of composite materials, the subsequent rapid degradation for 310–400 °C and 400–500 °C correspond to the fracture and degradation of CV-HSs chain respectively. The HCV-ASs has better thermal stability than the CV-HSs, which indicates that the silane group has thermal protection ability for the aerogel spheres. The SEM of CV-HSs showed that there are plenty of pores in the gel spheres, which presented three-dimensional network structure. With the increase of crosslinking degree, the pore density increased, but the pore diameter decreased, moreover, the pore wall continued to thicken and tended to closed, as shown in Fig. 4 (a-e). Moreover, the SEM results shown in Fig. 4f can prove that the HCV-ASs still have porous structure although undergoing freeze-drying and silylation. The BET analysis results also showed that the specific surface area decreased significantly with the increase of crosslinking degree from 1% to 5% for CV-HSs as shown in Table S1, moreover, silylation operation made 38.5% of the specific surface area losed for HCV-ASs."
10,Adsorption performance of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs,"3.3 Adsorption performance of CV-HSs and HCV-ASs The adsorption performance for the water pollutants was further investigated. Cu2+ is a typical heavy metal pollutant to water and soil, mainly from metallurgical industry (Rengaraj, Kim, Joo, & Yi, 2004). Phenol and aniline are both the typical organic pollutants for water and air (Hussain, Zhang, & Huang, 2013; Sarkar, Acharya, & Bhattacharya, 2003), representing phenolic pollutants and amine pollutants respectively, are both highly toxic to human. So they are all selected as the model pollutants for the adsorption measure. As shown in Fig. 5a, adjust the pH of the Cu2+ solution to 6 at room temperature and determine the adsorption isotherms of Cu2+ by CV-HSs with different crosslinking degree. In order to explore its adsorption type, Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to fit (Fathy, Girgis, Khalil, & Farah, 2010; Freundlich, 1906; Langmuir, 1918; Matouq, Jildeh, Qtaishat, Hindiyeh, & Al Syouf, 2015). The maximum adsorption capacity, equilibrium constant and correlation coefficient were shown in Table S2. It can be seen that the adsorption behavior conforms to Langmuir model and thus belongs to monolayer adsorption. By analyzing the relationship between the maximum adsorption capacity and different cross-linking degree, it is found that with the increase of the amount of crosslinker, the maximum adsorption capacity increases firstly and then decreases. The CV-HSs with 3% crosslinking degree have the maximum adsorption capacity for Cu2+ (17.22 mmol/g). According to above results, we can analyze the reason as follows. The adsorption force is mainly due to the electrostatic interaction between the carboxylate provided by CNFs and Cu2+. It may also be accompanied by the complexation between Cu2+ and the oxygen atoms of the neighboring hydroxyl groups. If the crosslinker dosage is over low, the hydrogel structure will be loose, and its swelling degree will be larger in water, which will weaken the interaction between hydrogel and Cu2+. On the other hand, if the amount of crosslinker is too high, the pore wall will thicken and the pore size will become smaller (as shown in Fig. 4), which will lead to decrease of the specific surface area, therefore the adsorption capacity will also decrease. The adsorption isotherms of CV-HSs with different degrees of crosslinking to phenol and aniline were shown in Fig. 5b and c, that were tested at the condition of pH = 6 and T = 25 °C. It can be found that with the increase of crosslinking degree of CV-HSs, the maximum adsorption capacity will increase firstly and then decrease for both phenol and aniline. This is because the pore density was increased with the increase of crosslinking degree, which is conductive to enhance the adsorption force to the pollutants. However, with the increase of the crosslinking degree, the effective adsorption specific surface area is further reduced, which will reduce the adsorption capacity of CV-HSs. Compared with the adsorption of phenol, CV-HSs have stronger adsorption capacity for aniline, which may be related to the stronger electrostatic interaction between carboxyl group and aniline. Langmuir and Freundlich equation were used to fit the adsorption isotherms of phenol and aniline. The maximum adsorption capacity, equilibrium constant and correlation coefficient were shown in Table S3 and Table S4. It can be seen that CV-HSs have maximum absorption of 176.72 mg/g and 341.93 mg/g for phenol and aniline respectively. From the fitting correlation coefficient R 2 in the table, it can be seen that the adsorption behavior for phenol and aniline conforms to the Langmuir model. The effect of pH on the adsorption of Cu2+, phenol and aniline by CV-HSs with 3% crosslinking degree was also investigated. Fig. 5d showed the maximum adsorption of Cu2+ by the CV-HSs under different pH conditions. We can see that with the gradual increase of pH in the range of 2–6, the adsorption capacity of the CV-HSs to Cu2+ increased. At low pH value, there are more hydrogen ions in the solution, which increases the repulsion force to Cu2+ and thus inhibits the adsorption of Cu2+. Moreover, the carboxylate will combine with proton to form carboxyl group, which will weaken the adsorption capacity of CV-HSs to Cu2+. But when the pH value is higher than 6, Cu2+ will form hydroxide precipitation, which is also not conducive to adsorption. For the absorption of phenol, as shown in Fig. 5e, when pH value of the solution increased, the adsorption capacity of CV-HSs for phenol increases firstly then decreases, reaching the maximum of 161.40 mg/g at the pH of 7. This is because when the acidity is strong, water molecules and H+ are prone to produce H3O+, whose polarity is much stronger than that of phenol, and it is easier to be adsorbed by the hydrogel, causing the occupation of adsorption sites on the hydrogel, therefore making the adsorption capacity for phenol decreased. When the pH tends to be alkaline, the carboxyl and phenol will be deprotonated to form carboxylate and phenoxy anion, which are both negatively charged and mutually exclusive, so the adsorption capacity for phenol decreases. For the absorption of aniline, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the CV-HSs in the pH range of 4–9 was determined. As shown in Fig. 5f, the adsorption capacity of the CV-HSs to aniline decreases with the increase of pH value. It is because that aniline is protonated to form a positively charged C6H5NH3 + under acidic conditions, which is easy to take electrostatic adsorption with the negatively charged oxygen functional groups on the surface of the hydrogel sphere, thereby strengthening the adsorption effect. However, under alkaline conditions, the protonation reaction of aniline is reversed, forming a neutral molecular C6H5NH2, that will weaken electrostatic adsorption with negatively charged containing‑oxygen groups. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of the CV-HSs to aniline decreases with the increase of pH value. In order to investigate the adsorption rate and adsorption mechanism of CV-HSs for different adsorbates, the adsorption rate experiments were carried out, and the quasi-first-order kinetic model and quasi-second-order kinetic model were used to fit the adsorption kinetic data. The quasi-first-order kinetic model is based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is determined by the diffusion step and is proportional to the difference between the equilibrium adsorption capacity and the adsorption capacity at time t, while the quasi-second-order kinetic adsorption model is based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is controlled by chemical adsorption (Ho, Ng, & McKay, 2000). This chemical adsorption involves the sharing or transfer of electrons between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The correlation coefficient R 2 of the equation obtained after linearization of each model was used to evaluate the fitting result. Quasi-first order adsorption kinetic equation: (4) ln Q e − Q t = ln Q e − K 1 t Where Q e is the fitted value of equilibrium adsorption, mmol/g; Q t is the amount of adsorption at time t, mmol/g; K 1 is the quasi-first order adsorption rate constant. Quasi-second order adsorption kinetic equation: (5) t Q t = 1 K 2 Q e 2 + t Q e Where Q e is the fitted value of equilibrium adsorption, mmol/g; Q t is the amount of adsorption at time t, mmol/g; K 2 is the quasi-second order adsorption rate constant. The adsorption kinetic curves of CV-HSs with 3% crosslinking degree for Cu2+, phenol and aniline were measured respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 , the CV-HSs can quickly adsorb Cu2+, phenol and aniline in the initial stage. With the extension of time, the adsorption gradually reaches equilibrium. For Cu2+ and phenol, the adsorption equilibrium time is about 150 min, while for aniline, it is faster, about 120 min. All these adsorption kinetic curves were fitted with the quasi-first-order kinetic model and the quasi-second-order kinetic model respectively, and the fitting parameters were shown in Table S5-S7. It can be seen that the quasi-second-order correlation coefficients for Cu2+, phenol and aniline were all higher than that of the quasi-first-order, so the quasi-second-order model was more suitable for describing the adsorption kinetics of the system. The experiment results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 15.93 mmol/g for Cu2+ was very close to the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 15.99 mmol/g calculated by the quasi-second-order kinetic equation. So it can be concluded that the adsorption mechanism of CV-HSs for Cu2+, phenol and aniline was mainly chemical adsorption. The faster adsorption rate of aniline may be related to the stronger interaction between the carboxyl group of CV-HSs and aniline. In order to investigate the lipophilic property of the HCV-ASs, three organic solvents including petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and toluene were selected as adsorbed objects. It can be found that the HCV-ASs floated on the water surface and can absorb petroleum, ethyl acetate and toluene quickly, as shown in Fig. 7 . The maximum adsorption capacity for ethyl acetate, petroleum ether and toluene were 17, 15 and 12 times of the weight of HCV-ASs with 3% crosslinking degree respectively. In addition, the HCV-ASs can be regenerated by vacuum filtration or rotary evaporation. Thus, the hydrophobically modified aerogel spheres have potential application in organic solvent storage and oil-water separation."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, large size CNFs/PVA composite hydrogel spheres (CV-HSs) and hydrophobic aerogel spheres (HCV-ASs) were successfully prepared by the inverse suspension pellet-forming technology and silylation modification. As-prepared CV-HSs with plenty of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups have a 3D network structure, which was formed by chemical crosslinking with GA. The CV-HSs exhibit excellent adsorption performance for heavy metal ions, phenols and amines. The maximum absorption capacity of CV-HSs for Cu2+ is 17.22 mmol/g, for phenol and aniline are 176.72 mg/g and 341.93 mg/g respectively. The adsorption isotherms for Cu2+, phenol and aniline are all consistent with Langmuir model, indicating that they are all monolayer adsorption. The kinetic adsorption study shows that the adsorption mechanism for heavy metals, phenols and amines is mainly chemical adsorption. Silylation of lyophilized CV-HSs can produce hydrophobic and thermal stability enhanced aerogels HCV-ASs. The HCV-ASs have excellent adsorption property for weak polar organic solvents, and can be regenerated by vacuum filtration or rotary evaporation. Therefore, two kinds of green gel materials were developed and exhibited a promising application as adsorption materials for water purification."
