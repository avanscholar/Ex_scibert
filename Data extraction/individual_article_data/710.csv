0,Introduction,"Conversion of carbohydrates in biomass into platform chemicals such as levulinic acid (Wei & Wu, 2018; Wei et al., 2019), 3-hydroxypropionic acid (Lama et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020) has been hot issue for biomass utilization (Zhao et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020). Platform chemicals concept was put forward by United States Department of Energy for 14 kinds of chemicals which could be produced from biomass after the comprehensive consideration of material cost, producing methodology and commercial value. Levulinic acid (LA) is on the list of platform chemicals introduced by United States Department of Energy. Platform chemical levulinic acid could be employed for the production of fuels and commodity chemicals (Tiong et al., 2019). Therefore, LA has been considered as a hot target product in high-value conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (Tang et al., 2015, 2017). And researches have spared no efforts to reduce producing cost, simplify producing process and improve process efficiency to facilitate LA production. Production of LA from raw material such as untreated biomass (Jeong & Kim, 2021) and cellulose (Zunita et al., 2020) could be more economical than that from glucose (Kumar et al., 2020), fructose (Thapa et al., 2017) and furfuryl alcohol (An et al., 2018). Mineral acids (Jeong et al., 2017), solid acids (Han et al., 2019), acidic ionic liquids (Tiong et al., 2020) could function as the catalyst for LA production from biomass. Ionic liquids have been considered as green solvent and catalyst for LA production from biomass due to their eminent physicochemical peculiarities (Khan et al., 2018b), including recoverability, thermal stability, non-volatility and so on. In general, ionic liquids such as [C4(mim)2][(2HSO4)(H2SO4)4] based on 1,4-bis(3-methylimidazolium-1-yl) butane (55% yield of LA at 100 °C in 3 h for cellulose, 47.52% of LA yield at 100 °C in 60 min for bamboo biomass) (Khan et al., 2018a, 2018b), 1-(4-sulfonic acid) butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate [BSmim][HSO4] (39.4% yield of LA at 120 °C in 120 min for cellulose) (Shen et al., 2015), indium trichloride-1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate InCl3-[Hmim][HSO4] (17.7% and 18.4% yield of LA at 177 °C in 4.8 h for oil palm empty fruit bunch and mesocarp fiber) (Tiong et al., 2019) and 1-methyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl) imidazolium hydrogen sulfate [C3SO3Hmim][HSO4] (55.0% of LA yield at 160 °C in 30 min under microwave irradiation for cellulose) (Ren et al., 2013) have been proven efficient medium for LA production from biomass. However, lack of efficient and economical recovery and regeneration techniques restricts the further scale-up utilization of these ionic liquids for LA production. Khan checked up the recyclability of [C4(mim)2][(2HSO4)(H2SO4)4] and found that activity of ionic liquid was decreased about less than 5% after 4th cycle (Khan et al., 2018a). Mthembu reported in their study that decrease in LA yield from depithed sugarcane bagasse after the 5th run of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [Emim][HSO4] was ~15% (Mthembu et al., 2020). Apparently, complicated electrolyte form of these ionic liquids and existing of biomass degradation products in ionic liquid during recycling would affect the durative of these acidic ionic liquids in repeating dissolution of biomass and catalytic conversion of hexose (Badgujar et al., 2019). Thus it’s urgent to probe into the efficacious recovery mechanism of ionic liquids and develop stable, economical and speedy strategy for ionic liquids recycling during LA production. Membrane-based techniques possess characteristics of established technology, low operating cost and long lifetime, which could be preferential for industrial chemicals production process (Foureaux et al., 2020). Membrane-based ultrafiltration (UF) could be considerable for the removal of biomass degradation products with large molecular weight due to the interception of these macromolecules by ultrafiltration membrane (Kim et al., 2020). And bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) could be utilized for the generation of acid or base with regional recovery of different ions in aqueous solution due to the generation of H+ and OH– at the interfacial hydrophil layer of bipolar membrane with the selective transfer of ions through corresponding ion-exchange membrane in BMED module (Herrero-Gonzalez et al., 2020). BMED has been proven effective for the production of salt (Zhang et al., 2019), acid (Achoh et al., 2019) and base (Wei et al., 2012). And the synergetic of UF with BMED could be of significance for ionic liquid recovery and regeneration for sustainable LA production. However, very few studies have been focused on the mechanism and route of ionic liquid recovery in the production of LA and other platform chemicals with membrane-based UF and BMED. Therefore, this study was conducted to efficiently recovery and recycling of ionic liquid [Emim][HSO4] for recyclable LA production from pith-removed sugarcane bagasse. UF module with three-chambered BMED device with was employed for the recovery and regeneration of [Emim][HSO4] from the aqueous solution obtained after LA separation. Influence of major parameters of UF-BMED treatment on [Emim][HSO4] recovery was studied in detail. And reusability of regenerated [Emim][HSO4] samples in repeated LA production was confirmed. The economic analysis for [Emim][HSO4] recovery was also performed according to calculation results of different UF-BMED process with varied operating conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and levulinic acid (LA) production,"2.1 Materials and levulinic acid (LA) production Pith-removed sugarcane bagasse was obtained from a local farm. The pith-removed sugarcane bagasse was dried with vacuum drying oven (45 °C of drying temperature, 400 mbar of vacuum degree). After vacuum drying, sugarcane bagasse was smashed with pulverizer and treated with sifter combination of 40 mesh and 60 mesh. Oven-dried sugarcane bagasse of 40–60 mesh was screened out and then got dewaxed before following treatment. Ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [Emim][HSO4] was supplied by Lanzhou Yulu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd. Other chemicals involved in this research were reagent-grade and were purchased from J&K Chemicals. LA production from pith-removed sugarcane bagasse was performed according to literature (Mthembu et al., 2020). And detailed procedure for levulinic acid production is shown in Fig. 1 . 1.0 g of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse, 4.0 g of [Emim][HSO4] and 10.0 ml of water was mixed in a stainless reactor equipped with mechanical agitator. The mixture was reacted at 100 °C for 7 h. Resulting mixture was washed with distilled water after cooling down to room temperature. Buchner funnel was used to separate the reaction mixture after water addition. Resulting filtrate was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was rotary-evaporated to obtained LA. While the aqueous layer containing [Emim][HSO4] was collected and diluted with distilled water. The diluted aqueous layer was filtrated with Buchner funnel or ultrafiltration before [Emim][HSO4] recovery and regeneration using BMED. Composition measurement of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse and residue obtained by levulinic acid production was performed according to literature (Chen et al., 2014). Contents of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in pith-removed sugarcane bagasse were 43.2 ± 1.4 wt%, 22.8 ± 0.9 wt% and 24.1 ± 1.0 wt%, respectively. The contents of neutral sugars, uronic acids and lignin in different solutions were measured in triplicate as reported (Liang et al., 2019). SO4 2- in different solutions was measured using potentiometric titration. Emim+ was measured using UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 211 nm (Katoh & Takahashi, 2009). Besides, levulinic acid was measured using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with C18 column and RID detector at 35 °C (Wei et al., 2019)."
3,Recovery and regeneration of ionic liquid,"2.2 Recovery and regeneration of ionic liquid 2.2.1 UF treatment The diluted aqueous layer was used as the feed solution for ultrafiltration experiments using a Pall OAPMP-220 UF module. Experimental condition for UF experiments was set as follows: 400 kpa of transmembrane pressure, 2.4 ms−1 of cross-flow velocity, 25 ± 1 °C of operating temperature and 650 Da of molecular weight interception. UF filtrate was collected to determinate the contents of SO4 2-, Emim+, neutral sugars, uronic acids and lignin. Recovery performance for SO4 2- and Emim+ by UF treatment was evaluated using RUS (SO4 2-) and RUE (Emim+). They are calculated as follows: (1) R US = n U S 1 n U S 2 × 100 % (2) R UE = n U E 1 n U E 2 × 100 % where nUS1 and nUE1 were the amount of SO4 2- and Emim+ in diluted aqueous layer, nUS2 and nUE2 were the amount of SO4 2- and Emim+ in the filtrate obtained after UF treatment. 2.2.2 BMED treatment and [Emim][HSO4] regeneration The resulting UF filtrate was diluted with distilled water to prepare BMED feed solution. A three-compartment bipolar membrane electrodialysis module (IONLYZER BP-A-BP) was employed for [Emim][HSO4] recovery in this study. The membrane stack of BMED module contained one piece of anion-exchange membrane (Neosepta AMX, Tokuyama) and two pieces of bipolar membrane (Neosepta BP-1, Tokuyama). Effective size of each membrane is 30 cm × 20 cm. A direct current power unit was employed for current management of BMED module. Aqueous Na2SO4, BMED feed solution and aqueous H2SO4 (same concentration as BMED feed solution) were flowed in polar chamber, mixing chamber and aciding chamber for 30 min before voltage being applied between BMED membrane stack. Solution in each chamber was circulated at 20.0 L/h using independent vacuum pump. Solution in each chamber possessed the same volume of 1.0 L. Solution in mixing chamber was sampled every 2 min and concentration of SO4 2- in solution samples was measured immediately. BMED experiment would be terminated when no SO4 2- were detected in solution of mixing chamber. Scheme for [Emim][HSO4] recovery using bipolar membrane electrodialysis is illustrated in Fig. 2 . It can be seem that SO4 2- in mixing chamber would got transported from mixing chamber to aciding chamber as voltage being applied on BMED membrane stack. And H+ in in mixing chamber would be reacted with OH– produced by water dissociation at bipolar membrane. Thus depletion of SO4 2- with H+ and augment of OH– would successively occur in mixing chamber as the going on of BMED experiment. And aqueous [Emim][OH] would be obtained in mixing chamber after BMED experiment. Meanwhile, augment of SO4 2- and H+ would be resulted in aciding chamber as the production of H+ by water dissociation at bipolar membrane with SO4 2- immigration from mixing chamber. Hence concentration-increased aqueous H2SO4 would be resulted in aciding chamber at the end of BMED experiment. Resulting solutions in mixing chamber and aciding chamber were rotary-evaporated to get concentrated aqueous [Emim][OH] and H2SO4. Aqueous [Emim][HSO4] was obtained by the reaction of concentrated aqueous Emim[OH] and H2SO4. Regenerated [Emim][HSO4] was acquired by the removal of water in aqueous [Emim][HSO4]. Recovery performance of [Emim][HSO4] was evaluated using parameters including recovery ratio of SO4 2- (RS ) and Emim+ (RE ), energy consumption of specific [Emim][HSO4] recovery (SP ) and overall energy consumption for [Emim][HSO4] recovery (S) of UF-BMED process with transport rate of SO4 2- (TR ) and current efficiency (η) of BMED process. And they were calculated as follows: (3) R E = R UE × n E 1 i n E 1 f × 100 % (4) R S = R US × n S 2 f - n S 2 i n S 1 i × 100 % (5) S = P A × t A + 3 × P B × ( t B + 30 m i n ) + J × A × ∫ 0 t B U t d t (6) S p = S M × ( n S 2 f - n S 2 i ) (7) η = 2 × ( n S 2 f - n S 2 i ) × F J × A × t B × 100 % (8) T R = ( n S 2 f - n S 2 i ) A × t B nE1i and nE1f were the amount of Emim+ in the solution of mixing chamber before and after BMED experiment, nS1i was the amount of SO4 2- in the solution of mixing chamber before BMED experiment, nS2i and nS2f were the amount of SO4 2- in the solution of aciding chamber before and after BMED treatment. PA and PB were the power of ultrafiltration module and each vacuum pump used in BMED module. tA and tB were the corresponding duration of UF and BMED experiments. M was the mole mass of [Emim][HSO4] (208.05 g/mol). A was the area of each ion-exchange membrane (600 cm2). F was Faraday constant (96485C/mol)."
4,Recycling of [Emim][HSO4],2.3 Recycling of [Emim][HSO4] Regenerated [Emim][HSO4] was reused for LA production as described in 2.1. Recovery and regeneration of reused [Emim][HSO4] was performed as described in 2.2 after LA production. LA yield (Y) and biomass dissolution ratio (D) were used to assess the recycling performance of regenerated [Emim][HSO4]. And they were calculated as follows: Y = n LA n He × 100 % D = m R m 0 × 100 % nLA was the mole amount of LA in LA product obtained by levulinic acid production experiment. nHe was the mole amount of hexose in sugarcane bagasse sample used for LA production. m0 was the weight of sugarcane bagasse sample used for LA production. mR was the weight of oven-dried residue obtained after LA production.
5,Results and discussions,
6,Levulinic acid production and ultrafiltration,"3.1 Levulinic acid production and ultrafiltration The yield of LA in organic layer after ethyl acetate extraction from pith-removed sugarcane bagasse was 53.2 ± 0.3% using fresh ionic liquid [Emim][HSO4]. Besides, LA yield was about 0.3 ± 0.1% in the aqueous layer obtained after ethyl acetate extraction. And the dissolution ratio for pith-removed sugarcane bagasse was 72.4 ± 0.2% after the treatment of fresh [Emim][HSO4] in this study, which is close to the result reported by Mthembu (Mthembu et al., 2020). A yield of 54.6% was obtained by Mthembu using depithed sugarcane bagasse under same condition. While the efficient recovery and recycling of [Emim][HSO4] should also be considered for further scale production of LA from sugarcane bagasse with [Emim][HSO4].Thus ultrafiltration (UF) and bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) was employed for the recovery and recycling of [Emim][HSO4]. Ultrafiltration works based on the interception of macromolecule solute with molecular weight larger that its interception parameter (Kim et al., 2020). While Buchner funnel filtration works on the basis of dissolution condition of each constituents in feed solution. Neutral sugars and uronic acids would be dissolved in the aqueous layer obtained after LA production, and their molecular weight would be less than the interception parameter (650 Da) of ultrafiltration membrane used for this study. While molecular weight of most lignin in the aqueous layer obtained after LA production would be larger than the interception parameter (650 Da) of ultrafiltration membrane. Thus it can be seen in Fig. 3 that ultrafiltration with the molecular-weight interception of 650 Da could result in similar purification performance for the neutral sugars, uronic acids in the aqueous layer obtained after LA production when compared with that of Buchner funnel filtration. In detail, contents of neutral sugars and uronic acids in UF filtrate were 961 mg/L and 1209 mg/L when [Emim][HSO4] concentration of the filtrate was 0.50 mol/L. While the corresponding contents of neutral sugars and uronic acids were 978 mg/L and 1245 mg/L for Buchner funnel filtrate with the same concentration of [Emim][HSO4]. It should be noted that content of lignin in UF filtrate (29 mg/L) was 92.3% less than that of Buchner funnel filtrate (375 mg/L). Apparently, efficient removal of lignin the major pollutant for anion-exchange membrane during electrodialysis would be beneficial for [Emim][HSO4] recovery using BMED (Tanaka et al., 2012). Thus ultrafiltration filtrate was employed as the primary feed solution for BMED-based [Emim][HSO4] recovery and regeneration. Besides, average recovery ratios for Emim+ and SO4 2- by UF treatment were 97.5% and 98.7% according to repeated UF experiments."
7,Recovery and regeneration of [Emim][HSO4],"3.2 Recovery and regeneration of [Emim][HSO4] In this study, Emim+ would be retained in the mixing section of BMED module with OH– generated from water dissociation after each BMED experiment. Thus aqueous [Emim][OH] would be obtained in mixing section after each BMED treatment. While SO4 2- would be enriched in aciding section by import from mixing section and augment of sulfuric acid would be resulted with the generation of H+ by water dissociation in aciding section. Hence [Emim][HSO4] could be regenerated with the [Emim][OH] and sulfuric acid obtained by BMED experiment. Influence of key process parameters including feed concentration of BMED module and current density of BMED membrane stack on [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance was investigated in detail. Content of levulinic acid in BMED feed solution was 85 ± 4 mg/L when BMED feed concentration was 104 g/L (0.50 mol/L), which was less than 0.1% that of [Emim][HSO4] content. Thus influence of levulinic acid in BMED feed solution on [Emim][HSO4] recovery was not prominent for this study. Besides, side-products such as humins and formic acid would also get generated during LA production. Humins generated during LA production would get removed by Buchner funnel filtration and ultrafiltration before following BMED treatment due to the fact that humins were generally not dissolved in the aqueous layer and molecular weight of humins was reported about 3200 Da (Lee et al., 2002), which is significantly higher than the molecular weight interception parameter 650 Da of ultrafiltration used in this study. Meanwhile, the content of formic acid in BMED feed solution was 421 ± 15 mg/L when BMED feed concentration was 104 g/L (0.50 mol/L). However, formic acid was not detected in resulting concentrated mixing solution or aciding solution. And formic acid in BMED feed concentration was considered to be depleted due to the neutralization of H+ in mixing section and formic acid evaporation during rotary-evaporation for resulting aciding solution. Detailed results of influence of BMED feed concentration (CB ) on [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance were shown in Fig. 4 a, b and c. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that recovery ratio of Emim+ (RE ) and SO4 2- (RS ) of UF-BMED process rose from 80.1% to 95.4% and 82.6%-95.9% when CB got elevated from 0.02 mol/L to 0.50 mol/L. It’s no doubt that wastage of Emim+ and SO4 2- would occur during BMED process by attaching on the ion-exchange membrane or leaving in circulation loop of BMED module. Researchers have reported that not all targeted ions (such as Emim+ and SO4 2- for this study) in feed solution would be totally reserved in resulting solution after electrodialysis (Jones et al., 2021). Ion-exchange membranes in fact are not fully permselective and loss of Bmim+ and Cl- in the electrode rinse solution was reported to occur during electrodialysis recovery of ionic liquid [Bmim]Cl (Wang et al., 2012). Higher CB would lead to the reduction in the wastage ratio of Emim+ and SO4 2- during BMED process together with more sufficient anion (SO4 2-) to be transferred from mixing section to aciding section. Transport rate of SO4 2- (TR , 86.5 mmol/(m2∙min)-95.1 mmol/(m2∙min)) was observed to be raised in Fig. 4b with the increasing CB (0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L). The electrical resistance of BMED membrane stack would get lowered down as the increase of BMED feed concentration (Wei et al., 2019). Thus current efficiency of BMED module would get improved and electrical energy wasted by BMED module would get reduced for the same amount recovery of [Emim][HSO4] with the rise of CB . Current efficiency (η) of BMED process was found to be elevated from 86.5% to 95.1% in Fig. 4b as CB varied from 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. Electrical energy wasted by BMED module for same amount recovery of [Emim][HSO4] would get reduced from 2.5 kW ∙ h/kg-0.6 kW∙h/kg as CB increased in 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. And this phenomenon was in accord with literature (Wei et al., 2019). Besides, Energy consumption of specific [Emim][HSO4] recovery of UF-BMED process (SP , shown in Fig. 4c) appeared to be reduced from 21.4 kW ∙ h/kg-5.8 kW∙h/kg as the lifting of CB from 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. While duration of UF treatment and BMED treatment would get extended as the increase of [Emim][HSO4] amount in the feed solution of UF-BMED treatment. Hence the overall energy consumption for [Emim][HSO4] recovery of UF-BMED process (S, shown in Fig. 4c) became higher with the rising CB . And S was observed to be elevated from 0.078 kW ∙ h to 0.586 kW ∙ h as CB rose from 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. Generally, increased BMED feed concentration would lead to a more exhaustive (RE , RS ), more economical (SP ) and quicker (TR ) recovery performance for [Emim][HSO4]. However, concentration of biomass degradation products (neutral sugars, uronic acids and lignin) would also become higher with the increase of CB . Average contents of neutral sugars, uronic acids and lignin increased from 47 mg/L-961 mg/L, 52 mg/L-1209 mg/L and 4 mg/L-29 mg/L as CB varied from 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. Thus fouling of ion-exchange membranes of BMED module would get aggravated with the augment of degradation products in BMED feed solution, which would cut down the service life of BMED module (Berkessa et al., 2019; Haddad et al., 2017). Therefore, BMED feed concentration of 0.20 mol/L was appropriate for [Emim][HSO4] recovery task when recovery performance and service life was synergistically considered. Influence of the other major process parameter current density of BMED membrane stack (J) on [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance was present in Fig. 4d, e and f. Recovery ratio of Emim+ (RE , 89.0%–91.6%) and SO4 2- (RS , 90.5%–95.0%) of UF-BMED process both went up as the rise of J (5 mA/cm2–100 mA/cm2). It’s obvious that more significant augment in RS was observed than that of RE . Emim+ would remain in mixing section and loss of Emim+ was mainly resulted by attaching on ion-exchange membrane and diffusing through anion-exchange membrane during BMED process, while the loss of SO4 2- would be generated by attaching on ion-exchange membrane. The higher current density of BMED membrane stack would bring enhanced electric field intensity for ions transfer (Wu et al., 2020). Thus the amount of Emim+ and SO4 2- attached on ion-exchange membrane would be reduced, and loss of SO4 2- would be cut down in a more significant ratio than that of Emim+. Besides, the transport rate of SO4 2- (TR ) of BMED process displayed in Fig. 4e was also observed to be elevated from 15.1 mmol/(m2∙min)-260.9 mmol/(m2∙min) due to the enhanced electric field intensity in BMED membrane stack as J increased from 5 mA/cm2-100 mA/cm2. While the enhanced current density of BMED membrane stack would also lead to the wastage of current by an excessive dissociation of water at the interfacial hydrophilic layer of bipolar membrane (Fu et al., 2014), which would result in a reduced current efficiency of BMED process. Thus current efficiency (η) of BMED process shown in Fig. 4e was observed to be reduced (97.2%-83.9%) as the increase of J (5 mA/cm2-100 mA/cm2). It is interesting to note that overall energy consumption for [Emim][HSO4] recovery (S) and energy consumption of specific [Emim][HSO4] recovery (SP ) of UF-BMED process present in Fig. 4f were found to be reduced from 0.311 kW ∙ h to 0.263 kW ∙ h and from 8.2 kW ∙ h/kg-6.8 kW ∙ h/kg when J increased from 5 mA/cm2-10 mA/cm2. It’s clear that energy consumption by BMED membrane stack would get raised due to more energy would be wasted by the resistance of membrane stack itself when J got lifted. While the improved transport rate of SO4 2- resulted by the higher J would also reduce the running duration of BMED module, and thus energy consumption by the three pumps used for solution circulation would got reduced. And energy got saved due to reduce of running duration of pumps was more than that augment of energy consumed by BMED membrane stack when J increased from 5 mA/cm2-10 mA/cm2. Thus S and SP were found to be dramatically increased when J got shifted from 5 mA/cm2-10 mA/cm2. Nevertheless, the energy consumption of BMED membrane stack of BMED process would keep going up and augment of energy consumed by BMED membrane stack would become more than that of energy got saved due to reduced running duration of pumps as the further rise of J in the range of 10 mA/cm2-100 mA/cm2. Thus S (0.263 kW ∙ h −1.037 kW ∙ h) and SP (6.8 kW ∙ h/kg-25.9 kW ∙ h/kg) were found to be increased as J rose within 10 mA/cm2-100 mA/cm2. As exorbitant current density of BMED membrane stack would bring negative impact on [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance in current efficiency-η, energy consumption of specific [Emim][HSO4] recovery of UF-BMED process-SP with service life of ion-exchange membrane (Liu et al., 2015). And taken into account the enhanced [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance in TR with RE and RS resulted by elevated J, 25 mA/cm2 of J would generate a balanced [Emim][HSO4] recovery performance in sufficiency (RE , RS ), efficiency (η, TR ) and economy (SP ) of UF-BMED process with service life of BMED module."
8,Recycling performance of [Emim][HSO4],"3.3 Recycling performance of [Emim][HSO4] Recycling performance of regenerated [Emim][HSO4] samples in LA production is also necessary to assess the feasibility of synergetic UF-BMED recovery strategy. Recycling performance of [Emim][HSO4] was evaluated with LA yield and dissolution ratio of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse after the treatment of [Emim][HSO4]-water mixture. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that LA yield and dissolution ratio of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse were 53.2% and 72.4% using fresh [Emim][HSO4]-based solvent. LA yield and dissolution ratio of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse with regenerated [Emim][HSO4] during 5 batch recovery and regeneration processing were in the ranges of 51.6%–53.4% and 70.2%–72.3%. The compositional variation of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse used for repeating LA production would lead to the changed contents of biomass degradation products including neutral sugars, uronic acids and lignin in BMED feed solution, which would undoubtedly lead to the changed recovery performance for [Emim][HSO4] as these side-products would absorb on the surface or choke in ion-migration channels of ion-exchange membrane during BMED process (Talebi et al., 2019). And BMED feed solutions with varied content of biomass degradation products would undoubtedly lead to the changed recovery performance for [Emim][HSO4]. Thus recycling performance of regenerated [Emim][HSO4] for repeating LA production would get influenced due to the compositional variation of sugarcane bagasse in repeating LA production when compared with that of fresh [Emim][HSO4]. Hence recycling performance of regenerated [Emim][HSO4] in LA production was similar to that of fresh [Emim][HSO4] considering the compositional variation of pith-removed sugarcane bagasse used in LA production. 15% decrease in LA yield after 5th run of [Emim][HSO4] was reported by Mthembu (Mthembu et al., 2020) under the same condition as this study due to the direct recovery of [Emim][HSO4] from the aqueous layer obtained by LA production. Therefore, the synergetic UF-BMED recovery strategy could be efficient for at least 5 batch recycling of [Emim][HSO4] during repeated LA production and recovery process. Previous studies mainly probed into the efficient recovery of ionic liquid during biomass processing such as pretreatment (Liang & Liu, 2020) and hydrolysis (Trinh et al., 2013), while results of this study could be further referenced for ionic liquid recycling in practical scale-up production of platform chemical."
9,Economic analysis for [Emim][HSO4] recovery,"3.4 Economic analysis for [Emim][HSO4] recovery Economic analysis for [Emim][HSO4] recovery also matters for practical biomass utilization with [Emim][HSO4] as the major solvent and catalyst. Thus the overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] with different UF-BMED conditions was calculated using calculating model present by literature (Jiang et al., 2014). The overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] contained energy cost and investment cost for [Emim][HSO4] recovery. And lifetime of UF-BMED device was set as three years. It can be seen in Table 1 that overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] with different UF-BMED operation conditions investigated in this study were in the range of 1.47–8.37 $/Kg. And the recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] with UF-BMED process was similar to that of electrodialysis-based recovery and production studies, such as lithium hydroxide (2.56–4.03 $/kg, BMED process) (Jiang et al., 2014), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (1.11–2.70 $/Kg, UF-ED process, ED stands for electrodialysis) (Liang & Liu, 2020) and hypophosphorous acid (0.937 $/kg, BMED with ion-exchange absorption) (Qiu et al., 2019). In addition, purchasing price of [Emim][HSO4] from its supplier Yulu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd was 1000 $/Kg. [Emim][HSO4] recovery cost was about 0.147%-0.837% of its selling price. Besides, results listed in Table 1 also indicated that [Emim][HSO4] recovery cost would get cut down as the increase of BMED feed concentration CB from 0.02 mol/L-0.50 mol/L. The rising CB would result in a higher amount of [Emim][HSO4] being recovered per year and significantly reduce the fixed cost for unit Emim[HSO4] recovery. Thus overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] would get cut down as the rise of CB . While overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] would get reduced (4.66 $/Kg-2.10 $/Kg) as the increase of current density of BMED membrane stack J in the beginning (5 mA/cm2-25 mA/cm2), and get increased (2.10 $/Kg −3.38 $/Kg) as J further went up (25 mA/cm2-100 mA/cm2). Apparently, high overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] would be obtained by low current density (less than 25 mA/cm2) of BMED membrane stack due to the high fixed cost for unit [Emim][HSO4] recovery resulted by the low value of [Emim][HSO4] recovered per year. And high overall recovery cost for [Emim][HSO4] could also be generated by an over-high current density (more than 25 mA/cm2) of BMED membrane stack for the high total energy cost for [Emim][HSO4] recovery due to the increased energy wastage by BMED module. Thus 25 mA/cm2 of current density of BMED membrane stack would be more economical than other values of J for [Emim][HSO4] recovery task with the synergetic UF-BMED strategy employed in this study. Besides, recovery ratio for Emim+ and SO4 2- were in the ranges of 80.1%-95.4% and 82.6%-95.9%. Loss of Emim+ and SO4 2- were considered to have occurred in the filtration, transfer, and circulation process during UF-BMED treatment."
10,Conclusion,"Efficient recycling of [Emim][HSO4] for levulinic acid production from biomass was realized with membrane-based techniques of UF and BMED. UF was necessary for purifying BMED feed solution by removing lignin. BMED treatment laid foundation for [Emim][HSO4] regeneration by the separation of Emim+ and SO4 2- with partition recovery of aqueous [Emim][OH] and H2SO4. The regenerated [Emim][HSO4] could provide similar performance for levulinic acid production from biomass after 5 batch recycling. Previous research concentrated on catalysis and dissolution characteristics of [Emim][HSO4], while this research could be significant for scale-up conversion of biomass using [Emim][HSO4] or similar ionic liquids."
