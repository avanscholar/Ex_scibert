0,Introduction,"Along with dramatically increasing demand of efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources, liquid-phase chemical hydrogen storage materials are attracting extensively attentions owing to its high content of hydrogen, high purity of product, safe and efficient production process, etc [1–3]. Among the various types of liquid-phase chemical hydrogen storage materials [4–8], alkaline borohydride (e.g. NaBH4 and KBH4) has been widely used to generate hydrogen via hydrolysis in aqueous solution [8–12]. However, the self-hydrolysis process of alkaline borohydride in aqueous solution is very slow at room temperature [2,13]. Many studies found that hydrogen gas can be rapidly released from the hydrolysis of alkaline borohydride with the addition of noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Rh, Au and Ru) at room temperature [14–18]. Even though noble metal catalysts possess superior catalytic activity, their large-scale practical applications are still restricted owing to their limited reserves and high cost [19,20]. Hence, the development for highly active and low-cost non-noble metal catalysts to substitute noble metal catalysts is becoming imperative and necessary. Iron (Fe) as an economic and abundant non-noble metal presents an opportunity to be catalyst with comparable catalytic activity [19–23]. Generally, Fe catalysts were synthesized by the reduction of its corresponding ions [20,22,24]. Up to date, there are numerous reports about Fe-based catalysts for the hydrolysis of alkaline borohydride. For example, Fe nanoparticles [20], Fe-B nanoparticles [22], Ni-Fe-B nanochain [24], Cu-Fe-B nano powders [25]. However, most Fe-based catalysts were prepared prior to catalytic reaction via chemical reduction, and then mixed with alkaline borohydride solution. And previous literatures reported that the preparation of smaller size Fe nanoparticles is a big challenge [24]. Hence, there are few researches about in-situ formed smaller size Fe nanoparticles for the catalytic hydrolysis of alkaline borohydride. Many studies showed that the smallest particle of metal catalysts corresponded to the highest catalytic activity [26–28]. With the particle size of metal catalysts was reduced to single atom region, its catalytic performance can be significantly improved [29,30]. Thus, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received great attention in the past decade [29–32]. However, its intrinsic high activity would make the preparation of stably dispersed SACs a little bit difficult [32]. The SACs supported on the surface of two-dimensional materials [33–35] and metal oxides [36–38] have been intensively investigated in recent years and showed excellent catalytic performance. Even so, the large-scale production and the protection of SACs still remain significant challenges [39–41]. In recent years, our group have successfully prepared a series of colloidal alloy SACs (single metal atoms anchored on another metal/alloy nanoclusters), which presented superior catalytic activity for glucose oxidation [42–44]. More recently, we first observed the presence of Co SACs in an ISOBAM-104 ((C8H10O3)m(C8H16O3N2)I, a copolymer of isobutylene and maleicanhydride and a water-soluble amide-ammonium salt type of ISOBAM) stabilized Co colloidal catalysts. It exhibited an outstanding catalytic activity of 14300 mL-H2 min−1g-Co−1 for hydrogen generation from KBH4 hydrolysis, which was even higher than that of Rh, Pd and Pt counterparts [45]. In addition, the colloidal catalysts possessed several advantages as following: (1) colloidal alloy SACs or colloidal SACs with high stability can be easily obtained under the protection of an appropriate protective agent, (2) the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal colloidal SACs can be clearly investigated without the effect of alloy nanoclusters and other supports, and (3) metal single atoms, nanoclusters or nanoparticles with more uniform particle size distribution can be obtained in the colloidal system. Inspired by the above achievements, for the first time, we prepared ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts. The effects of Fe(NO3)3 concentration, ISOBAM-104 concentration and various protective agents on the catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts were studied. Fe single atoms and small size Fe nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained via the in-situ chemical reduction of Fe(NO3)3 by KBH4 under the protection of ISOBAM-104. The obtained Fe colloidal catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen generation toward KBH4 hydrolysis, which was superior to the Fe catalysts prepared by other agents, such as carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na), poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), polyethylene glycol (PEG), starch and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Besides, the apparent activation energy of this catalytic reaction was calculated by the Arrhenius formula and compared with other Fe-based catalysts. The binding energy of Fe atom/clusters with various protective agents and the activation energy of KBH4 hydrolysis were also calculated via a density functional theory (DFT)."
1,Experiment,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials Potassium borohydride (KBH4), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), PVA, PVP, PEG, CMC-Na, starch and CTAB were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. ISOBAM-104 was produced by KURARAY (a company of Japan). The chemical structure of ISOBAM-104 was showed in Fig. S1. All chemicals were directly used as received. Pure water was developed from a laboratory water purification system."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a recording spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) in the spectral range of 200−800 nm with the scan interval of 1 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were operated on JEM-2100 (JEOL, Japan). The specimens were prepared by putting 3∼4 drops of the as-synthesized colloidal aqueous solution onto a copper grid covered with organic film and dried naturally. The average particle sizes of the colloidal metal nanoparticles were evaluated by randomly measuring the diameter of nanoparticles no less 200 from different areas of the grid. The image of single atom was captured by a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) with a spherical aberration corrector (FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300, USA). Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected on a VG Multilab 2000 instrument (Thermo Electron Co., USA) equipped with a 300 W Al Kα excitation source."
4,Preparation of Fe colloidal catalysts and catalytic hydrolysis of KBH4,"2.3 Preparation of Fe colloidal catalysts and catalytic hydrolysis of KBH4 A facile and high-efficiency method was adopted to synthesize ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts by mixing ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe3+ ions with alkaline KBH4 solutions. The experimental procedure as well as hydrogen generation from KBH4 hydrolysis were carried out in a three-neck flask (250 mL) that equipped with a constant pressure dropping funnel and placed in a thermostatic bath, as shown in Fig. S2 [27,45]. Firstly, the certain concentration of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O solution and ISOBAM-104 were added into the round-bottom flask followed by adding deionized water to make the total volume of the mixture up to 50 mL. Then, stirring continuously for 24 h at a constant temperature. Finally, the certain amount of KBH4 (the molar ratio of KBH4 to Fe3+ ions was 25) and NaOH solution were injected into the mixed solution through the constant pressure dropping funnel. The color evolution of the solution and the volume of hydrogen generation from KBH4 were recorded during the hydrolysis reaction. The volume of hydrogen was examined by the displacement level of water via an electronic balance and automatically recorded at an interval of two seconds by a computer. The rate of hydrogen generation (k, mL-H2 min−1) could also obtained from the slope of H2 volume-time curve in the initial stage of reaction. In addition, the catalytic durability of the synthesized Fe colloidal catalysts was determined by adding the same amount of KBH4 into the ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe3+ solution after the completion of the previous cycle. All the hydrolysis reactions were repeated at least three times in the same conditions to obtain the mean value of hydrogen generation rate and catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts."
5,Calculation of catalytic activity and apparent activation energy,"2.4 Calculation of catalytic activity and apparent activation energy The catalytic activity (mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) can be calculated by the ratio of the hydrogen generation rate (k) to the mass of catalyst (m). Our previous work [46] have reported that ISOBAM-104 could act as a catalyst in the hydrolysis reaction of KBH4 to release hydrogen due to its NH4 + group. Therefore, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts was obtained by subtracting the catalytic activity value of ISOBAM-104 under identical conditions. The reaction temperature has a significant effect on the hydrogen generation rate of catalysts. Based on the catalytic activity at different temperature, the corresponding apparent activation energies (E a) of ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts for KBH4 hydrolysis were quantified by the following Arrhenius formula: (1) lnk = -E a/(RT)+A where k is the hydrogen generation rate (mL-H2 min−1), E a and T respectively represent the apparent activation energy (kJ mol−1) and reaction temperature (K), R equals 8.314 J mol−1 K−1, and A is a constant."
6,Theoretical calculation,"2.5 Theoretical calculation DFT calculations were implemented in the DMol3 package by using spin-polarization DFT/GGA with the PBE exchange-correlation functional. The valence electrons were described by a doubled numerical basis equipped with polarization functions. The investigated models were fully optimized without symmetry constraint by an all-electron relativistic core treatment. In these calculations, the spin restricted SCF calculations were conducted via a convergence criterion of 10−5 hartree. In addition, the geometry optimization employed a convergence criterion of 0.004 hartree/Å for the force parameters, 5 × 10−5 hartree for the total energy and 0.005 Å for the displacement parameter."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis of Fe colloidal catalysts and catalytic hydrolysis of KBH4,"3.1 Synthesis of Fe colloidal catalysts and catalytic hydrolysis of KBH4 The color of ISOBAM-104/Fe3+ solution immediately turned from pale yellow to black and accompanied with the generation of H2 bubbles after adding alkaline KBH4 solution (Fig. S3), suggesting the in-situ synthesis of Fe colloidal catalysts and KBH4 hydrolysis. Subsequently, the color of the solution gradually faded from black to initial pale yellow as the reaction proceeded and completed. In addition, the corresponding UV-vis spectra clearly showed that the absorption intensity of the ISOBAM/Fe3+ solution immediately increased to the highest level under the addition of alkaline KBH4 solution (Fig. S4), illustrating the formation of Fe NPs catalysts. Then, the absorption intensity gradually decreased as the reaction proceeded. Notably, in the case of 20 min reaction time, the absorption curve was almost coincided with that of the initial ISOBAM/Fe3+ solution, indicating that Fe NPs catalysts were oxidized into Fe3+ ions after the reaction. The UV-vis results can also explain the color evolution of ISOBAM/Fe3+ solution. TEM images (Fig. S5a) revealed that small size and well-dispersed Fe NPs (∼2.0 nm) were in-situ synthesized under the addition of KBH4 initially. However, with the reaction time extended to 20 min, the amount of Fe NPs decreased drastically (Fig. S5b). It is believed that such small size Fe NPs could be easily oxidized into Fe3+ ions and dissolved after the reaction, which agreed with the color evolution and the UV-vis results of the solution (Fig. S3 and S4)."
9,Optimal preparation parameters of Fe colloidal catalysts,"3.2 Optimal preparation parameters of Fe colloidal catalysts The optimal molar ratio of ISOBAM-104 to Fe3+ ions (R ISO) were investigated at various R ISO (R ISO = 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , TEM images and size distribution histograms showed that the average diameters were respectively about 3.2 nm (R ISO = 20), 1.9 nm (R ISO = 40), 3.4 nm (R ISO = 60), 4.0 nm (R ISO = 80) and 4.5 nm (R ISO = 100). In the meantime, the hydrogen generation volume and the corresponding catalytic activity of the Fe colloidal catalysts at different R ISO were showed in Fig. S6 and Fig. 2 . The catalytic activity of the Fe colloidal catalysts increased at first and then decreased with increasing R ISO value. When the R ISO was 40, the catalytic activity was up to 8100 mL-H2 min−1 g-Fe−1. These results clearly revealed that the particle size and catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts were directly influenced by the amount of ISOBAM-104. The small amount of ISOBAM-104 cannot play a better protective role to Fe colloidal catalysts. Whereas the excessive ISOBAM-104 would promote the agglomeration of Fe NPs and cover over the catalysts to decrease the catalytic activity. Hence, the Fe colloidal catalysts with the smallest size (1.9 nm) and highest catalytic activity (8100 mL-H2 min−1 g-Fe−1) can be prepared at the optimal condition of R ISO = 40. The optimal Fe3+ concentration (C Fe3+) were also investigated at the condition of various C Fe3+ (C Fe3+ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 mM). As illustrated in Fig. 3 , TEM micrographs and size distribution histograms showed that the average diameters were respectively about 4.4 nm (C Fe3+ = 0.3 mM), 3.8 nm (C Fe3+ = 0.4 mM), 3.3 nm (C Fe3+ = 0.5 mM), 1.9 nm (C Fe3+ = 0.6 mM) and 4.3 nm (C Fe3+ = 0.7 mM). The hydrogen generation volume and the corresponding catalytic activity of the Fe colloidal catalysts at different C Fe3+ were also collected and calculated (Fig. S7 and Fig. 4 ). Similarly, the catalytic activity of the Fe colloidal catalysts increased at first and then decreased with the increase of Fe3+ concentration. When C Fe3+ was 0.6 mM, the catalytic activity was up to 8100 mL-H2min−1 g-Fe−1. These results demonstrated that the concentration of Fe3+ have a significant effect on the particle size and catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts as well. The low concentration of Fe3+ (C Fe3+ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 mM) was below the threshold of “supersaturation”. Consequently, the process of nucleation couldn’t complete in a short time, thereby overlapped with growth, resulting in large particles. In addition, at a high concentration of Fe3+ (for 0.7 mM), the nucleation rate accelerated obviously due to the frequent collisions between atoms and nucleus, and eventually resulting in large particles. Hence, the Fe colloidal catalysts with the smallest size (1.9 nm) and highest catalytic activity (8100 mL-H2 min g-Fe−1) can be prepared at the optimal Fe3+ concentration of 0.6 mM. According to the above results, it was found that the as-prepared Fe colloidal catalysts exhibited a superior catalytic activity of 8100 mL-H2 min−1 g-Fe−1 at the optimal conditions of R ISO = 40 and C Fe3+ = 0.6 mM. This catalytic activity was higher than those previous reported Fe-based catalysts (Table S1), such as Ni-Fe-B hollow nanochain (4320 mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) [24], Co-Fe-B (4310 mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) [47], FeCo2O4 nanowire (2551 mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) [48], and Ni-Fe-B (2910 mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) [49]. Although the catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts was lower than that of our previously prepared colloidal Co SACs (14300 mL-H2 min−1 g-cat−1) for hydrogen generation from KBH4 hydrolysis [45], however, it should be mentioned that the cost of Co is at least five times higher than that of Fe. Subsequently, HRTEM was adopted to characterize the Fe colloidal catalysts prepared at the optimal conditions. The HRTEM images (Fig. 5 a) showed that the lattices of fringe spacing of several Fe NPs were about 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of Fe crystal. We speculated that the as-prepared Fe colloidal catalysts might contain Fe single atoms since it is so easy to be oxidized into Fe3+ ions (Fig. S4 and S5). The HAADF-STEM with a spherical aberration corrector was thus used to characterize the as-prepared catalysts and it indeed clearly observed that plentiful of Fe single atoms with a radial diameter about 0.23 nm uniformly dispersed in the Fe colloidal catalysts (Fig. 5b), directly proving the existence of Fe atoms in Fe colloidal catalysts. According to the previously reported literatures [50,51], we speculated that BH4 − ions were firstly absorbed on Fe atoms to form Fe−H and Fe−BH3 − intermediate species. Then, Fe−BH3 − reacted with OH− and H2O to form BH3(OH)− and Fe−H intermediate species via BH3 intermediates. Finally, BH3(OH)− converted to B(OH)4 − via the substitution of BH bonds with BOH− bonds. Simultaneously, Fe−H reacted with another Fe−H to generate hydrogen and regenerate metal active sites. Thus, it can be confirmed that the as-prepared Fe colloidal catalysts presented a superior catalytic activity due to the existence of Fe single atoms. To further investigate the valence state of Fe single atoms and small size Fe NPs, XPS measurement was carried out (Fig. S8). The high-resolution Fe 2p spectra were fitted into three peaks. The first peak (709.9 eV) corresponded to FeO [52], indicating the oxidization of metallic Fe. Meanwhile, the appearance of Fe 2p1/2 at 723.0 eV could be ascribed to the presence of Fe3+ species on the surface of catalysts [53]. The small peak at 706.8 eV corresponded to the Fe 2p3/2 of metallic Fe [52], which was lower than the peak of FeO and Fe3+ species, implying the lower content of residual Fe. The present results could be contributed to that the as-prepared Fe colloidal catalysts are easy to be oxidized into Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions owing to the high activity of small-sized Fe NPs and Fe single atoms although the XPS characterization was carried out under high vacuum conditions as much as possible. Meanwhile, these result also could provide an evidence to account for the color evolution of the colloidal solution. In a word, Fe3+ was firstly reduced by the KBH4 to form Fe single atoms instantly with the addition of alkaline KBH4 into ISOBAM-104/Fe3+ solution. Then some Fe single atoms clustered together to produce small-sized Fe NPs. Eventually, due to the high activity of the in-situ formed Fe atoms and NPs, they were facile to be oxidized into Fe3+ ions after the completion of KBH4 hydrolysis."
10,Effects of various protective agents on Fe colloidal catalysts,"3.3 Effects of various protective agents on Fe colloidal catalysts The hydrogen generation volume and the catalytic activity of Fe colloidal catalysts protected by conventional protective agents including ISOBAM-104, PVP, PVA, PEG, starch, CMC-Na and CTAB were compared in Fig. S9 and Fig. 6 . Notably, the hydrogen generation volume of Fe colloidal catalysts protected by ISOBAM-104 was considerably higher than those protected by other stabilized agents. Moreover, the corresponding catalytic activity of ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts was respectively 8.1, 6.8, 3.7, 2.9, 2.3 and 1.4 times higher than that of CMC-Na, PVP, CTAB, PEG, starch or PVA protected catalysts. These results implied that ISOBAM-104 was an high-efficiency stabilized agent to synthesize Fe colloidal catalysts with smaller size and higher catalytic activity. Additionally, the binding energies between Fe single atoms or Fe4 clusters and the various protective agents were measured by DFT calculations to further understand the better protective role of ISOBAM-104, as shown in Fig. S10 and Table 1 . The binding energies were negative when Fe single atoms and Fe4 clusters adsorbed COO−, CONH2 and OCOCOgroups of ISOBAM-104, COO− group of CMC-Na, (CH3)3N− group of CTAB, and O atoms of PVA, PEG, PVP as well as starch. It implied that all these protective agents could protect Fe NPs and prevent their overgrowth. Table 1 showed the highest binding energies between Fe single atoms or Fe4 clusters and ISOBAM-104, suggesting that ISOBAM-104 was the optimal protective agent to stabilize Fe single atoms and Fe NPs among all the protective agents mentioned above. Furthermore, ISOBAM-104 contain more COO−, CONH2 and OCOCOfunctional groups, guaranteeing the formation of Fe colloidal catalysts composed of small Fe NPs (1.9 nm) and Fe single atoms."
11,Apparent activation energy and durability of the as-synthesized Fe colloidal catalysts,"3.4 Apparent activation energy and durability of the as-synthesized Fe colloidal catalysts Fig. S11 showed the hydrogen generation volume from KBH4 hydrolysis which catalyzed by ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts from 298 to 318 K. Fig. 7 showed that the corresponding apparent activation energy (E a) was 49.85 kJ mol−1 which quantified by Arrhenius formula. In addition, the activation energy (E a) and reaction energy (E r) of KBH4 hydrolysis catalyzed by ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe4 catalysts were also calculated by DFT calculation, as shown in Fig. 8 . The calculated activation energy (E a) was 49.7 kJ mol−1, which was in coincidence with the value obtained by Arrhenius formula (Fig. 7). Moreover, Table S2 showed that the apparent activation energy of Fe colloidal catalysts in this work was lower than most other previous reported Fe-based catalysts, demonstrating that ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts with excellent performance were synthesized for hydrogen generation. The durability of the Fe colloidal catalysts for KBH4 hydrolysis to generate hydrogen was investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 9 , TEM images and size distribution histograms showed that the average diameters of Fe colloidal catalysts were increased after each cycle. These results may be attributed to that the byproducts (KBO2) produced by the hydrolysis of KBH4 in the previous cycle might have detrimental effects on the protective ability of ISOBAM-104, thereby resulting in larger Fe nanoparticles. Correspondingly, the hydrogen generation volume and catalytic activity of the Fe colloidal catalysts were decreased after each cycle (Fig. S12 and S13). The decrease of catalytic performance may be caused by the increase of Fe NPs size as well as the accumulation of byproducts (KBO2) on the active sites of the Fe NPs [54]. Moreover, the increasing concentration of KBO2 might increase the viscosity of the solution and prevent the mass transfer in the catalytic process. Thus, in order to retain the high catalytic activity and enhance the durability, the ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts may be more suitable for a reaction without byproduct’s residue."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, an effective method by simply controlling the mixing process of ISOBAM-104/Fe3+ colloidal solution and KBH4 solution was demonstrated for hydrogen generation. The ISOBAM-104 stabilized Fe colloidal catalysts exhibited a high catalytic activity of 8100 mL-H2 min−1 g-Fe−1 at the optimum condition of R ISO = 40, C Fe3+ = 0.6 mM, which was higher than that of the catalysts stabilized by other conventional protective agents. Such high catalytic activity was ascribed to the outstanding ability of ISOBAM-104 in protecting and promoting the in-situ synthesis of small size Fe NPs and Fe single atoms. Moreover, the low apparent activation energy of the as-synthesized Fe colloidal catalysts resulted in a lower energy barrier toward KBH4 hydrolysis. The findings in this work would provide a promising strategy to prepare high active and low-cost colloidal catalysts for the on-demand hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of alkaline borohydride."
