0,Introduction,"Jet fuel is the higher operating cost in air transport, that is why the aeronautical industry is mainly affected by variation in prices of fossil fuels. These variations depend on two factors: 1) the socio-political situation of main countries with oil reserve, 2) the world economy [1]. The gas turbine is the component responsible for providing aircraft power, it uses a great amount of liquid fuel, petroleum derivatives, such as gasoline, kerosene or jet fuel, owing to its high energy density, less space for storage of fuel and thermal stability [2]. The consumption of these fuels accounts for a market value of $207 billion in 2012 [3]. Airbus reported that there are approximately 15,750 aircraft in the world, and it is projected to reach 32,000 by 2028 [4]. According to Yilmaz and Atmanli [5], 3 L of aviation kerosene per 100 km travelled are consumed. On the other hand, the combustion of petroleum-based fuels is considered a serious environmental concern, since its use in commercial air transport not only contributes approximately up to 2.6% of annual carbon dioxide ( C O 2 ) emissions [6], but also approximately 3.5% of anthropogenic radiative forcing [7]. This scenario is expected to worsen as aeronautic activity increase [2]. The aeronautical industry aiming to reduce fossil fuel consumption using renewable fuels to decrease this impact [8], and consequently reduce both its operating costs and greenhouse emissions (GHG) thus mitigating global warming. Biomass is the main feedstock for the biofuels production used in the ground transport [9] due to their renewable condition [10]. Similarly, the fuels obtained from biomass are the major potential to be used in air transport, which became the most common transportation form. Any biomass of animal or vegetal origin with carbohydrates content is considered as an energy source. For that reason, the number of investigations about alternative jet fuel has been increasing in the last years, which is evidenced by the great number of publications associated with the keywords “biojet fuel” (or biofuels aviation) as shown in Fig. 1 . In the same way, it is observed that Brazil has increased the number of its publications in aviation biofuels in the last years. This demonstrates its compromise on greenhouse gases mitigation produced by the air sector. The great advantage to consider biofuel production is the reduction of emissions harmful to the environment [11], but in counterpart, its combustion characteristics are altered [2]. Several requirements are needed for the fuel to be classified as jet fuel, such as high energy density, aiming to maximize the range and reduce the carried fuel load, good atomization; rapid evaporation; an ability to be relit at altitude through the low risk of explosion; appropriate low viscosity; good physical and chemical stability and adequately freezing point [11], good burning characteristics, being free of contaminants, minimum carbon formation [5] and be widely available while being economically competitive with current Jet – A1 fuels [12]. Since 2008, numerous flights were made using biofuels and following the American ASTM standard. In 2011, the use of biofuels was included in air vehicles [13]. On the other hand, the internal combustion engine, as well as a gas turbine, can accept biofuels, as long as they have similar properties to fossil jet fuel. The compatibility of biofuel is a key factor in aircraft operation. Due to the strict characteristics presented by jet fuel, alternative fuels have found limited application in aviation [5,12], especially by the low content of aromatic compounds. Although, these help to formation of particulate matter, which is harmful to health, it is acceptable up to 25%vol. In jet fuel [14]. Biofuels of the second generations are also considered as an alternative to be used in the aeronautical sector with the participation of up to 6% approximately. International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts 30% additions of biofuel in Jet fuel by 2030 [15]. It would mean a great advance in technologies for biofuels production which would cause a positive impact on the economy and environment of developing countries [5]. Works such as Cheng et al. [16] and Yun et al. [17], Mendez et al. [18] and Mendez et al. [19], encourage the alternative liquid fuel blends with traditional fuels because the current combustion chambers can accept blends with biofuels keeping a high performance without any modification. In this way, ethanol and its blends have arisen as an attractive alternative especially due to its benefit to the environment [4]. Since it was introduced in the biofuels market, ethanol has been used in internal combustion engine [20]. Several types of renewable feedstock can be used for alcohols production such as grains, algae, woods and many crops. The fermentation of sugars and others carbohydrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, xylan and mannan can be used as well [21]. Silveira et al. [22], investigated ethanol production in the Brazilian context using the sugarcane crops as feedstock. Brazil and the United States produce about 80% of the world's ethanol. Being the United States the country that uses the greater amount of ethanol (up to 85%) for the run of their flexible vehicles [23]. Nevertheless, the low percentage of ethanol (10–15%) used in spark combustion engine makes it difficult to achieve further penetration in the biofuels market [24]. Atomization characteristics of ethanol blends were also studied in Song et al. [4], Park et al. [25] and Zhu et al. [26]. They had shown that the addition of ethanol can improve fuel spray and atomization characteristics, but at the same time, it leads to prolonged ignition delay due to its low cetane number. The correct ethanol concentration blended into kerosene results in a reduction of smoke emission and an increase in combustion efficiency, it is due to the joint effects of longer mixing time, faster mixing rate and higher fuel oxygen fraction. With the fast growth of the Brazilian aeronautical industry (see Fig. 2 ), it is necessary to find alternative fuels that reduce greenhouse emissions without affecting engine performance. Considering that, all biofuels have an energy density less than petroleum-based fuels, it is key to use efficient technologies for an adequate conversion. Thus, the objectives considered in this study are: 1) determine, from the deductive method, the lands availability for the culture of biomass that could be used in biojet fuel production as well as the development grade of its conversion technology which would make them potential candidates to be used in the Brazilian aviation, 2) show the potential of four types of biomass (jatropha, soybeans, sugarcane and forest residues), and their possible conversion route for the biojet fuel, considering the feedstock abundance, conversion technology, substitution target of up to 10%vol., and limits of mixture already approved by the ASTM International and Brazilian regulations for biojet fuel use, 3) evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using ethanol, butanol or biodiesel as partial or total substitutes of the conventional jet fuel, since they have a consolidate production in Brazilian market, 4) identify the feedstock of greatest benefit for the biojet fuel production, 5) evaluate the effects of the different types of biojet fuel on payload through Breguet range equation, 6) show a calculation methodology allowing to estimate the future participation of the biojet fuel in Brazilian market, and 7) identify the stages of greater contribution to the life cycle GHG emissions in production chain of the biojet fuel."
1,Bioethanol in Brazilian aviation,"Renewable sources in the Brazilian energy matrix corresponds to 42%, which is higher than 13% of the world average. However, the use of biofuels in the aviation sector is less competitive than fossil jet fuel [29]. The low competence of biofuel has been seen not only in the economic aspect but also from the social and environmental point of view [30,31]. The biojet fuels “Drop-in” must-have properties that including interchangeable or blended with commercial jet fuels, so that no adaptations of current aircraft engines are necessary [29] to keep the security in its operation [32]. However, the complexity of fossil jet fuel has been an obstacle for biojet fuels production. For example, ethanol and biodiesel commonly used for road transport cannot be considered in commercial aviation applications, although, currently, in Brazil, hydrated ethanol is used in 25% of the small agricultural airplanes built in the country [8], leading to a decrease in operating costs (up to 40%) and environmental improvement. These small airplanes represent 75% of sales in the sector [33]. The ethanol produced using a renewable feedstock is called Bioethanol [34]. Countries with great territorial expansion and biomass available have the feedstock for vegetable oil extraction, besides presenting higher diversity of inedible materials and bio alcohols [8]. Depending on biomass type, biofuels can be produced with different characteristics to be used in both ground and air transport [5]. In this way, ethanol has received attention, since it can also be blended with kerosene in different proportions [2]. Ethanol is considered a secondary fuel since it is used to improve the properties of primary fuel such as waste oil and animal fats [5,35]. Brazil has the potential to increase biomass production mainly due to lands availability and favourable climatic conditions [8]. Brazil as a producing country of biofuels strengthens its regional power together with political leadership in the administration and logistic of biofuels in Latin America. Sugarcane is a culture of great importance in Brazil, which is part of the Brazilian economy since midcentury XVI. Among the main extracted products obtained from bagasse biomass, we found ethanol, sugar, electric energy (bagasse) [36] and forest residues as straw [37]. Fig. 3 is shown a schematic of co-products obtained from sugarcane and its percentages in each processing phase. First, it is obtained 609 M t . y r − 1 of sugarcane from 8.6 M h a y r − 1 of cultivated lands. Second, two co-products are obtained from sugarcane: saccharose and bagasse which represent 8.87% and 91.13%, respectively, from overall sugarcane processed. The forest residues (straw) represent 50% of collected sugarcane of the field, that is, what's left on land. Third, two co-products are obtained from saccharose: ethanol and sugar which represent 47.22% and 52.78%, respectively, from overall saccharose processed. On the other hand, 70% of bagasse is used for the energy generation in the power plant and the other 30% in excess is stored in a container, however, in its transport 50% in straw is recovered. Finally, two type of alcohol are obtained: hydrated and anhydrous which represent 71.37% and 28.63%, respectively, from overall ethanol processed. Fig. 4 is shown that ethanol production has evolved significantly due to the expansion of sugarcane crops. In 2018, the Brazilian ethanol production was 32.3 million liters, divided as 23.1 million hydrated ethanol (an increase of 39%) and 9.2 million anhydrous ethanol (a decrease of 17%). Thus, the total volume of produced ethanol was 17% higher than in 2017, reaching a new historical record [38]. Currently, Brazil has 850 Mha of territorial expansion from which, 9% are occupied by all planted crops in the country, including the forest cultures. The remaining territory corresponds to 13.2% of planted pastures and 8% of natural pastures. The sum of all these areas is 30.2% of Brazilian territory (approx. 257 Mha). Brazil is the largest sugarcane world producer [36,39], with a cultivated total area, in 2017, approximately 8.84 Mha corresponding to 1.04% of Brazilian territory or 3.44% of planted areas [38]. It means that Brazil takes advantage of a little percentage of its lands. Besides, an increase in sugarcane culture of 11 Mha for the harvest period 2029/2030 is provided [40]. As is shows in Fig. 3, only half of the saccharose is employed to produce ethanol; the other half to sugar production [8]. Brazil counts with resources to support the expansion of biojet fuel production preserving the large areas with pasture and it has 593 Mha of agricultural lands (69.8% of the national territory). Only a small part is cultivated [41]. Investigations made by Cornelissen et al. [42]; Prieler et al. [43], Horta et al. [44], have concluded that it is possible to increase renewable energy production without affect food production at the same time. Supposing, the substitution of 50% of fossil jet fuel world consumed (∼253 M m 3 or 8.8 EJ year−1) a volume of approximately 207 M m 3 of ethanol would be necessary, which would correspond to using 30 Mha of land approximately [44], which can be provided by Brazil using part of its 64 Mha available for the growing of sugarcane mainly replacing pasture and without compromising environmentally sensitive areas [41], considering that ethanol yield: 86.7 L t − 1 sugarcane and average sugarcane yield: 80 t h a − 1 and 7000 L h a − 1 [45]. In this way, hydrated and anhydrous ethanol are two types of commercial biofuels produced. Hydrated ethanol represented by molecular formula ( 0.88 C 2 H 5 O H + 0.12 H 2 O ) and molecular weight 42.64 k g k m o l − 1 , it has 5% water and 95% alcohol in its mass composition, for this reason, it is highly volatile and flammable. This alcohol does not present miscibility with other petroleum-based fuels due to water content, so that its use depends on specific applications in industry as well as transport. For example, the IPANEMA agricultural airplane built by EMBRAER specifically to operating with hydrated ethanol [46]. Anhydrous ethanol, represented by molecular formula C 2 H 5 O H , has 99% alcohol in its composition, for this reason, it is a flammable liquid of category 2. Its most advantageous characteristic is miscibility with ethyl esters such as Jet-A1, synthetic kerosene, biodiesel among others. Its lower heating value is higher than hydrated ethanol. The higher the purity of the alcohol, the greater miscibility the ethanol will have to be blended with other fuel [46]. Therefore, in the current research, anhydrous ethanol is of greater interest and will be named with its simplified form as ethanol. However, the energy quantity contained in ethanol is the main disadvantage for it to be used for commercial aviation [33]. Thus, the rise in ethanol production offers a possibility for considering higher alcohols as alternative jet fuel [11]. The expansion of the use of ethanol for small size agricultural aircraft evidences the great availability of feedstock for biofuels productions [11]. On the other hand, n-butanol (higher alcohol) is also produced from the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass [11]. According to Giakoumis et al. [47], n-butanol has characteristics such as high energy density, high ketane number, high viscosity, low vapor pressure and high flash point which, place n-butanol as the better additive (compared to ethanol) to be mixed with long-chain fuels such as kerosene and diesel. It is reported in the literature that, ethanol and n-butanol are the biofuels commonly used for road transport. However, due to the low flash point, low energy density and low-temperature properties, they would cause problems during the flight operation [5]. The high volatility is another problem, that could cause evaporative losses or fuel–system vapor lock, which represent a serious risk for both crew and passenger [5]. In the case of n – butanol, its production (being from 10 to 30 times lower than ethanol) is the limiting factor to be considered as commercial aircraft biofuel [11]. However, this problem can be overcome by enhancing the fermentation technology of the n-butanol in the sugarcane biorefineries to become a product more attractive than conventional ethanol [48]. As shown in Table 1 , n-butanol has a light advantage in comparison with ethanol being blended with fossil jet fuel. Nevertheless, using either of these alcohols would result in reduced operational capabilities and a reduction in the energy efficiency of aircraft operation [49]. The Lower Heating Value (LHV) of ethanol and n-butanol are ∼40% and ∼23%, respectively, less than LHV of fossil jet fuel [49]. Supposing that is possible to use both ethanol and n-butanol without any operational limitation in the aircraft, the world fleet would be necessary 78% and 23% more fuel volume, respectively, than if it had used fossil jet fuel. [49], which would be a disadvantage in payload terms. In 1984, Brazil tested a new formulation of biofuel for aircraft called PROSENE and whose composition was 10% biodiesel and 90% commercial jet fuel. Since its heat of combustion and viscosity were affected by the biodiesel addition in the mixture, it was limited to 20% in ester volumes in an alternative to reduce atomization and gum formation problems in the combustion process [50]. As a result, CTA (Advanced Technology Center) observed a C O 2 reduction that could reach 7.8% per year (as an average) in comparison with an aircraft propelled only by jet fuel [51]. In 2010, UNICAMP, Boeing, Embraer and FAPESP [52] published: the “Flight Plan for aviation biofuels in Brazil: plan of action”. In this compendium, the fundamentals and implementation of new biofuels in the aeronautic area were included [11]. In airlines, the larger operative costs are represented by fuel price. Thus, according to ANAC [53], total operational costs of main Brazilian airlines are divided into fuel cost (27.5%), lubricant cost (3.9%), aircraft maintenance (18.2%), workers in general (17.1%), operating expenses (12.7%) and others (20.6%). Due to the growing interest in the use of biofuels in Brazilian aviation, some air enterprises (Embraer, AIAB, TAM, Gol, Azul and Trip) in cooperation with biofuel production enterprises (União da Industria de Cana – de – açúcar, Amyris Brasil, Algae Biotecnologia and ABPM) undertook tests in their commercial airplanes aiming to reduce the dependence on petroleum-based fuels [54]. Several kinds of research have shown that ethanol and fossil fuel blend is beneficial from the environment point of view. Thus, Asfar and Hamed [55], studied the emission characteristics of diesel/ethanol blends in a gas turbine. They [55] found that this blend decreases the soot in flame and pollutants such as C O , C O 2 , N O x and H C . However, increasing the amount of ethanol beyond 10% in the blend does not result in an additional reduction of soot and pollutants. Mendez et al. [18], investigated the emission characteristics of Jet A/ethanol blends in five different concentrations of ethanol, applied to a gas turbine. They [18] observed a lower operational thrust when ethanol was added but at the same time lower C O and N O x emissions were also found. In other investigation, they [19] also reported similar results in Jet A/butanol blends in five different proportions of butanol (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% vol.) in the same engine. Khalil and Gupta [56], evaluated the combustor performance and emission characteristics by using liquid and gaseous fuels, including jet fuel and ethanol. The study [56] found a decrease in C O and N O emissions with use of biofuels. Besides, they demonstrated the operation limits in the combustor due to fuel change without any modification to the injectors while its performance is kept. Patra et al. [2], studied the changes in flame characteristics and combustor performance in a cylindrical spray combustor when operated with pure kerosene and kerosene/ethanol blends in proportions of 5% and 10%vol. Of ethanol. They [2] found that, in ethanol/kerosene blends, C O and C O 2 concentrations present in exhaust gases was reduced, what represent less carbon released to the atmosphere. The C / H ratio of ethanol lower than kerosene, it is indicative for this result. In most cases, the ethanol addition to jet fuel or diesel contributes to reducing emissions that are harmful to the environment, however, engine performance is affected. It must be highlighted that not all alternative fuels offer this advantage."
2,Potential alternative fuels for the Brazilian aviation,"The aeronautical industry is fast-growing (see Fig. 2), consequently, the jet fuel demand is also increasing. This event increases the concern for the use of fossil fuels and their subsequent atmospheric emissions. For this reason, the use of biofuels obtained from feedstock such as jatropha, soybean and sugarcane can be considered as part of the solution. Bearing in mind, the potential for sustainable biojet development, Brazil is taken as a key player since its strategic advantage is unique worldwide [57]. Currently, ASTM and Brazil have approved five processes through which alternative jet fuel can be obtained [29]. A summary is shown in Table 2 ."
3,Alcohol to jet (ATJ) process,"3.1 Alcohol to jet (ATJ) process Although several plants species supply biomass for bioenergy generation, only those grown on a large scale would be able to support jet fuel production in short term. Sugarcane and soybean are grown on a large scale for ethanol and biodiesel production, respectively so that, they occupy approximately 30% of the Brazilian energy matrix [57]. Characteristics such as low heating value and high energy of ethanol vaporization become the major obstacles for it to be used as alternative jet fuel [8]. However, the molecular structure of alcohols can be changed through chemical processes to reach the range of jet fuel such as dehydration, oligomerization, distillation, dimerization and hydrogenation [58]. In this way, alcohol to jet fuel (ATJ) or alcohols oligomerization, is a biofuel obtained from alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol and long-chain fatty alcohols. Therefore, improving ethanol to be blended with jet fuel, presents a potential pathway for its development aiming a partial substitution in the aeronautical industry market, but it is still in the development stage. Conversion of alcohol to jet fuel has also been developed on a commercial scale and was flight–tested by U.S. Air Force in July 2012 [59]. Alcohol to Jet fuel production which is obtained from a variety of alcohols and intermediate oxygenates, is being developed by several companies such as BYOGY renewables, Cobalt technologies, Gevo, Swedish biofuels, Terraton, UOP, Lanza Tech, Zeachem and Vertimass [60]. Since then, it has been shown that they meet specifications ASTM D7566 to be used in aircraft turbine [60] so that, the jet fuel/ATJ blend already has been applied in commercial airlines as shown in Table 3 . The use of ATJ in other engines that are not gas turbine would depend on its performance limits since its chemical composition is significantly different to commercial jet fuel [61]. According to Guzman et al. [61], ATJ commercially available presents the following composition: • iso – dodecane ( i C 12 H 26 ) : 89.7%vol. • iso – tridecane ( i C 13 H 28 ) : 5.6%vol. • iso – nonano ( i C 9 H 20 ) : 2.6%vol. • iso – hexadecane ( i C 16 H 34 ) : 2.1%vol. Whichever the alcohol type used to obtain biojet fuel (SPK – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) it passes through two important processes: a) oligomerization and b) hydrotreating, necessary to increase its energy content. The overall process diagram is shown in Fig. 5 . Jet fuel consists of paraffin's in the C 10 − C 14 range [60]. In the oligomerization process, a monomer (or light olefin C 4 − C 8 ) is converted in ∝ -olefins, which have a greater number of carbon atoms ( C 9 − C 20 ), then, these products pass through hydrogenation (well-developed technologically in the petrochemical industry) process at 370 °C approximately, finally SPK and biodiesel, are obtained [59]. Dehydration of ethanol is a well-known practical process in the industry. This technology has been used in Brazil since 2010 to produce green polyethylene. However, the oligomerization of ethylene to obtain biodiesel and SPK continue to be a challenge, mainly by both the catalyst type used in the process and the low quantity of ethylene converted in SPK [60]. Brocks et al. [60] report five alternative pathways to better the process, it consists of obtaining olefin as product intermediate: (1) butene, (2) hexene, (3) propylene, (4) higher alcohols, and (5) carbonyl., which are more easily oligomerized than ethylene itself. Table 4 presents a comparison among these five technologies for the conversion of ethanol to biojet fuel. All process steps of the ATJ production have been demonstrated on a relatively large scale and the risk of its expansion is expected to be reduced [59]. Higher alcohols dehydrate at temperatures and pressure lower than ethanol and its derivatives producing heavy olefin after the oligomerization process favourable for higher biojet fuel production [60]. The overall process of obtaining biojet fuel from alcohol is more expensive for ethanol than higher alcohols. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of equipment costs used in each process for the conversion to ATJ from ethanol and isobutanol [62]. The biojet fuels cost is not competitive compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. The final biojet fuels cost will depend on biomass prices, refinery technology and logistic costs. However, biomass has the greater influence, representing 70% of final costs [8,44]. It is reported by Souza et al. [29] that the biojet fuel process is 2–2.5 times more expensive than fossil jet fuel. According to Klein et al. [63], it is possible the introduction of bio-refineries, which are completely self-sustained, i.e., that take different biomass type (sugarcane stalls, straw, forestall resources and vegetal oil) as main inputs and without depending on external electric energy or another energy source for the biojet fuel production and other biofuels. They [63] concluded that for any of three production routes (HEFA, F-T, ATJ: approved by ASTM international) the biofuel resulting would be competitive to jet fuel as long as the oil barrel price is above US$100, except for the ATJ process, that it uses ethanol of second-generation as feedstock, which is more expensive. In the same research, they [63] considered two feedstock for the ATJ route: ethanol (first and second generation) and butanol. Additionally, it was concluded that, for either ethanol of first or second generation, they have little probability to be used as feedstock in the ATJ process, despite Brazil being ethanol's largest producer, revenues are less than expend for this technology type. However, Butanol use is more attractive for the ATJ process, since, it needs 158,000 ha of sugarcane to produce 162 million L y r − 1 of ATJ, an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 5.7% and capital expenditures of 303 million dollars [63]. According to Refs. [48,64,65], anhydrous ethanol can be used as feedstock to produce n-butanol. EPE [38] data, suggests that there is a production capacity of 10.76 billion liters of anhydrous ethanol, of which, 9.2 billons were used in 2018, i.e., there is 1.56 billion (17%) available for the n-butanol production. Pereira et al. [64] reported that 28 L of n-butanol per ton of processed sugarcane can be produced, so that, using the data of Fig. 3, it is calculated the production of 313.28 million liters of n-butanol per 158,000 ha. The ASTM International Standard D7566 specifies that the limit of mixture for ATJ – SPK currently approved is 30% [66]. But in Brazil, the limit is still up to 10%, as has been established by the resolution ANP (Brazilian Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels) n0 63/2014 [67]."
4,Oil to jet – chemical process for lipids,"3.2 Oil to jet – chemical process for lipids HEFA (hydroprocessing esters and fatty acids) are paraffinic liquids produced by hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils, animal fats, waste fats, algae oil and bio-oil, whose products are water and propane, in its highest proportion. For example, Jatropha oil, Camelina oil, algal oil are some feedstocks with the most projection for the production of HEFA fuels [68]. The technical of hydroprocessing involve oxygen removal from fats and oil, extracted from feedstock, using hydrogen [69]. One of its higher advantages is the emission reduction of greenhouse gases such as carbon monoxide ( C O ), unburned hydrocarbon ( H C ), nitrogen oxides ( N O x ) and particulate material ( P M ) [70]. On June 22nd, 2011, KLM initiated the first series of intercontinental flights using a blend of 80% of Jet – A1 and 20% of HEFA fuel, this last obtained of used cooking oil [71]. The biofuels obtained by this process have properties that are advantageous for higher altitude flight where the temperature is low. Due to the absence of oxygen and sulfur HEFA fuels presents low lubricity. Additionally, its cetane number is lower than fossil jet fuel so that the ignition can be affected. However, those problems can be easily solved by blending HEFA fuels with petroleum-based jet fuel [72] or other additives used as metal-based catalysts in the conversion process such as platinum on carbon ( P t / C ) [73]. In September 2009, ASTM International Standard D7566 certified to the HEFA fuels to be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel [66,69,74]. Air enterprises such as Aeroméxico, Air China, Air France, Finnair, Iberia and Air France KLM and Lufthansa have already performed commercial flight using HEFA as fuels [70]. These biojet fuels present a higher potential for production on a large scale because they have less technological complexity than other routes, besides it being more consolidated worldwide [75]. The hydrotreating technologies use triglycerides obtained from plants and animal oils to be bombarded by hydrogen at high pressure over noble metals or metal sulfides supported catalysts [76]. The main contribution of triglycerides is their moderately long chains C16 – C18 together with a high H/C relation. This process can be split into four stages [76]: 1) Hydrogenation of the unsaturated olefinic bonds in triglycerides. 2) Formation of free fatty acid together with propane through breaking off C–O bonds in saturated triglycerides. 3) Formation of linear n – alkanes through hydrogenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation from free fatty acid. 4) Formation of iso - alkanes lighter through hydrogenation, cracking and isomerization. The hydrotreatment in the HEFA process is the best known and already consolidated in the Brazilian petroleum industry since it is alike the hydrotreatment of petroleum-based diesel practised at refineries in the country, which consists in the removal of nitrogen, aromatics and sulfur from diesel [29]. A possible disadvantage in this process is the high hydrogen cost which would increase the overall production cost of biojet fuel as a greater quantity of feedstock was used [73]. According to Yilmaz and Atmanli [5], jatropha presents several advantages to be considered as feedstock in biojet fuel production. It is non-edible (it is poisonous), pest resistant and grows quickly with a small amount of moisture for 40 years. Besides, it contains from 30 to 40% oil in each grain. Jatropha has been commercially produced in Brazil since 2004 and grown in states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Maranhão, Rio de Janeiro and Tocantins [77]. EMBRAPA, the company responsible for farming research in Brazil, made a study through Drumont et al. [78], who gave an elaborate description of Jatropha (pinhão manso) physical characteristics and production. These are shown in Table 5 . The production was increased in consecutive years. According to Bergmann et al. [77], Brazil produced 116.03 kt of Jatropha in 41,098.3 ha in 2011, so that, the plant gave an oil yield of 1200–1500 k g h a − 1 in one year. Brazil was the first country in Latin America to perform a test flight using a biojet fuel produced from jatropha [80]. The Brazilian airline TAM, in collaboration with the Brazilian Association of Producers of Jatropha, come into a project involving feedstock cultivated in Brazilian territory with the potential to be used in the production of biofuel. In addition, the project was aimed at bringing socio-economic benefits for Jatropha growers on family farms [71]. Santos et al. [81], evaluated three feedstock types (sugarcane, reusable cooking oil and Jatropha) as potential to be used in biojet fuel production. Using the MACBETH method (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique), they concluded that, Jatropha (pinhão manso) use as feedstock is the more viable option for biofuels production applied to Brazilian commercial aviation. Besides, from the environmental point of view, the three biomasses have an elevated sustainable potential, in case of their introduction in the Brazilian energetic matrix, they would have a significant contribution to the society regarding employment generation for land harvest and environmental passive reduction generated by commercial aviation. Wang [24] has done an elaborate analysis of biojet fuel production using Jatropha fruit as feedstock. The biorefinery considered in his study was divided into two stages: (1) from Jatropha fruit to Jatropha oil and (2) from Jatropha oil to biojet fuel. In the first stage 27.78 k g s − 1 of Jatropha fruit was consumed to produce 5.38 k g s − 1 k g s − 1 of Jatropha oil, i.e., the conversion efficiency was approximately 19.38%. In second stage 5.38 k g s − 1 of Jatropha oil was consumed to produce 3 k g s − 1 k g s − 1 of biojet fuel, i.e., the conversion efficiency was approximately 55.75%. The efficiency in the second stage of the process is high, in consequence, its operation cost is also high, approximately 134 M$ (million dollars) y r − 1 in comparison with the first stage that was 116 M $ y r − 1 . Thus, it also affects the minimum biojet fuel selling price, becoming 5.42 $ g a l − 1 and 5.74 $ g a l − 1 for the first and second stages, respectively. The author [24] concluded that the difference between minimum biojet fuel selling prices for fruit and oil scenarios are due to feedstock costs, refinery capital cost, co-products credits and energy cost."
5,Biodiesel – transesterification process,"3.3 Biodiesel – transesterification process Brazil is one of the world leaders in biodiesel production from soybean crops as well as other oilseeds [82]. In 2018 produced 3.7 billion liters of biodiesel from soybeans, whose participation represent 69.8% of total production followed by 13.4% obtained from beef tallow. Currently, 51 biodiesel plants built in Brazil offer a total production capacity of 8.5 billion liters which is higher than the 5.4 billion liters consumed in 2018 (see Fig. 7 ) [38]. It shows that there is potential for the production growth of this biofuel. In Table 6 , a comparison summary of the main characteristics of the soybeans production chain between 2017 and 2018 is shown. Biodiesel fuels have a great advantage because it presents technology defined for its large-scale production and available feedstock [83], especially in Brazil. They present good miscibility with petroleum-based fuel, free sulfur and aromatics content so that, they have low lubricity [70,82]. In industrial applications, biodiesel presents two problems: oxidative stability and cold flow. The first one limits its storage time due to the biodegradability causing microbial growth. The second one limits its operation at high altitude flight. However, this last problem can be overcome by optimizing the biodiesel through the decrease of palmitic acid concentration (∼3.8%vol) and esters adding such as decanoic acid, isopropyl and 2-butyl which do not compromise other important properties of fuel [84]. Biodiesel is a liquid fuel whose fluidity depends on both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid by which is compound. All fatty acid is fluid at temperatures in which the organisms (from bacterial to vertebrates) normally exist [85]. Therefore, the higher the environmental temperature is, the higher will be its freezing point and the lower the environmental temperature is, the lower will be its freezing point, which is an adaptability mechanism of organisms [85]. The presence of a more quantity of unsaturated fatty acid offers more adaptability of organisms at lower temperatures. These types of organisms are termed resistant species. On the other hand, a more quantity of saturated fatty acid limits the adaptability of organisms at lower temperatures. These types of organisms are termed sensitive species [85]. It is known that characteristics such as long-chain, double bond and position of double bonds all play an important role in the determination of the physical properties of the unsaturated fatty acid [86]. Thus, unsaturation grade from unsaturated fatty acid with two or more bonds, increases as the environment temperature decrease. In the case of unsaturated fatty acid with only one double bond in its molecular structure, its unsaturation grade decreases as the environment temperature decrease [85]. The parameter more important to measure the unsaturation grade of fatty acid is the double bond index defined as the sum (in weight percentage) of each fatty acid in the mixture multiplied by the full number of double bonds divided by 100 [86]. Lyons and Asmudson [86] shown that an increase in 5 mol % of unsaturated fatty acid into a mixture influences its freezing point. In other cases, the higher increase in the unsaturation of the fatty acid as the temperature decreases is not produced by the more unsaturated compounds, but by the more branched compounds with more than 15 carbons. However, the decrease in unsaturation grade happens with C18:0 (stearic acid) and C20:0 (arachidic acid). This demonstrates that microbial systems have other alternative mechanisms than unsaturation by which they can remain adequately fluidity (homeoviscous) [85]. In carbon chains greater than C20:1 there is not an appreciable decrease in the fuel freezing point no matter the number of double bonds present in the molecular structure [87]. The general response of all microorganism at low temperatures is to synthesize lipids with a lower melting point. This can be achieved through unsaturation, branching, cyclization and chain shortening [85]. For all above, fatty acids of short-chain and multiple double bonds number (unsaturated) would help to solve the problem of high freezing point, so that, they would be suitable to be blend to jet fuel [12]. Nevertheless, the presence of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in its composition, decrease its stability since the rate of oxidation is higher on the unsaturated side [88]. Therefore, an adequate equilibrium between the number quantity of fatty acids and the freezing point is necessary. Jet fuel is a paraffin's mixture with carbon atoms in the C10–C14 range [60]. It is of main interest that the molecular structure of biodiesel has 12 or more carbon atoms in the chain. It also presents an advantage because it doesn't need cracking phases which reduces investment cost [1]. Table 7 shows the fatty acids composition of some oilseeds cultivated in Brazil. In 2014, ASTM approved the limited use of biodiesel in jet fuel [5]. The main motives were poor flow cold at higher altitudes, biodegradability and an increase in N O x emissions. In Brazil, due to the high production and consolidated market of biodiesel, it is considered the most viable option as biojet fuel in short term [11]. On the other hand, Soybeans was considered as the only oilseed capable of supporting the production of HEFA biojet fuel in the short term due to its large abundance in Brazil. However, the employment of soybeans as feedstock for biojet fuel production would not be suitable since its use is addressed to biodiesel production for the automotive market. Besides, it is not recommendable that two biofuels be produced from the same feedstock because both markets will compete between them [89]. However, product diversity would increase process competitiveness. It has been reported in the literature that burning of diesel/biodiesel mixtures significantly reduce C O 2 and S O 2 emissions, but the addition of biodiesel in the mixture tend to increase N O x emissions in engines [90]. The level of N O x emissions internationally acceptable are those corresponding to mixtures of up to 30% and 50% of biodiesel [90]. Several additives are considered, to make the burning as uniformly as possible and avoid the fragmentation of intermediate hydrocarbon chain that would result in the partial combustion of fuel, particularly for molecules of C H and C H 2 reacting with nitrogen within the combustion chamber [91]. However, N O x emissions are not uniform, i.e., depend on biofuel type and other factors such as engine configuration, working cycle, injection method among others. Calemma et al. [92] made a comparison of N O x emissions from biodiesel obtained by Fischer - Tropsch and mineral diesel with low sulfur content. The results show that, N O x emissions of biodiesel were 0.464 g k m − 1 and in diesel case were 0.475 g k m − 1 for the particular engine used in the research. The emissions concentrations produced were lower for biodiesel than mineral diesel. The chemical species considered were: H C , C O , C O 2 , N O x and P M . Brazil has 150 Mha including new borders and range-lands which can be incorporated into agricultural production [82]. Thus, in 2012/13, 27.7 Mha of land was used to plant soybean, yielding 81.5 M t of seed [8]. However, biodiesel fuels cannot replace jet fuel, because their energy density is very low when compared to fossil jet fuel. Even though they are attractive options by their environmental benefit and large-scale production, they can only be blended ranging from 5 to 15% with fossil jet fuel [5]."
6,Farnesane – biochemical process,"3.4 Farnesane – biochemical process The paraffinic liquid 2,6,10-trimethyl dodecane, also known as farnesane ( C 15 H 32 ), was approved since 2014 [93] by ASTM test and specifications D7566 as a fuel drop-in which can be blended up to 10% with Jet-A1 [66]. This test shows the pathway for the strategies of characterization and new research focused on synthetics aircraft fuels. The Farnesane is a synthesized iso-paraffinic (SIP or C15 isoprenoid) fuel with high energetic content, produced from hydroprocessing fermented sugar [94]. In the fermentation process, a yeast engineered metabolically such as Saccharomyces Cerevisiae is used in the synthesis of farnesene from biomass with high glucose content (main carbon source) [95]. After finishing this stage, the extracellular medium which is an emulsion of oil on water is separate from biomass (substrate) through centrifugation. This emulsion is inverted using a surfactant (Triton 0.3%vol., for example) resulting in emulsion water on oil. These phases, watery and oily, are separated through centrifugation and finally, the phase rich in oil is quickly distilled to produce high purity farnesene [95]. The main difference between ethanol and farnesene fermentation is the environment in which the process takes place. The glucose fermentation to obtain ethanol is made in anaerobic environments (without oxygen) through one-step reaction (Eq. (1)) and farnesene fermentation is made through a biological reaction more complex in environment aerobic (with oxygen) involving other substances such as ammonia and salts (Eq. (2)). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 C 2 H 5 O H + 2 C O 2 (2) 100 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 0.5 N H 3 + 50 O 2 → 3 b i o m a s s + 80 C O 2 + 40.5 H 2 O + 27 f a r n e s e n e Stoichiometric coefficients are expressed in mass base. It means that 0.27 g of farnesene are produced by each gram of fermented glucose which, represents 90% of the theoretical maximum for the yeast engineered by the Amyris [95]. The subsequent conversion to farnesane has been measured with approximately 99.7% efficiency [93]. Farnesane has the power to be commercially viable in comparison with other biofuels. Amyris biotechnology is responsible for farnesane production. In 2008, Amyris built a pilot plant in U.S.A. (Emeryville, CA), with a capacity of 9 million liters/year. It also has a pilot plant in Brazil (Campinas, SP) [96], with a production capacity of 50 million l i t e r s y r − 1 [94]. The procedure for the farnesane production can be divided into six steps: (1) bagasse reception and pretreatment, (2) cellulose hydrolysis, (3) sugar fermentation (hexoses and pentoses) to farnesene, (4) product recovery, (5) farnesene upgrading to jet fuel (farnesane), and (6) combined heat and power (CHP) [97]. Commercially the farnesane can be considered as a renewable diesel from sugar. It has 15 carbons in its structure, for this reason, leads to complete compatibility with the diesel fossil besides providing a high cetane number and great stability [98]. According to Michailos [97], the biological process efficiency for the biojet fuel production from sugarcane as feedstock is 12.1%, i.e., 0.121 kg of biojet fuel (farnesane) is produced from 1 Kg of bagasse. From this way, the selling price of produced biojet fuel would be 2.78 $ L − 1 , capital expend would be 606 M$ (million dollars), C O 2 emissions generated in the process would be approximately 46.2 g C O 2 e q M J − 1 of biojet fuel produced, which, can be reduced up to 37 g as long as process and metabolic engineering achieve an increase in fermentation efficiency. Farnesane is a simple component with a molecular size higher than Jet - A1. Since it is a pure compound, then some of its properties are in the acceptable range for it to be used as jet fuel, for example, evaporation temperature and flash point [93]. Flights with passengers from Florida to São Paulo and from Germany have been operated using 10% of farnesane blended with Jet - A1 as well as a delivery flight of an Airbus A350 from Toulouse to Hong Kong [93]. In 2018, it was determined by ASTM International Standard D7566, that Farnesane can be blended in 30% with conventional jet fuel [29]. However, according to resolution ANP (Brazilian Agency for Natural gas, Petroleum and Biofuels) n0 63/2014, farnesane can be blended with Jet-A1 up to 10% as the maximum limit [67]."
7,N – hexanol – thermo-biochemical process,"3.5 N – hexanol – thermo-biochemical process Higher alcohols are considered suitable additives for biodiesel due to their outstanding characteristics such as high cetane number, low oxygen content and high flammability. It was settled out that higher alcohols addition to biodiesel results in the concentration reduction of emissions harmful to both health and environment such as unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM). At the same time, an increase in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and heat release rate (HRR) is observed [99]. Some properties of fossil fuel such as low heating value, corrosion ability, material compatibility, volatility and combustion efficiency can be affected when it is blended with alcohol, due to oxygen content in its structure. For this reason, the volume of alcohol to be blended cannot be considerable [100]. However, the presence of oxygen in the molecule is a characteristic desirable to reduce the particles emissions to reach environmental objectives. Methanol and ethanol have potential use in road transportation, but they are not suitable to be used as alternative biofuel in air transportation [70]. The carbohydrates obtained from biomass hydrolysis go through a thermal and chemical fermentation process to produce bio alcohols [101]. Biomass sources like corns and cellulose are first hydrolyzed to extract sugars and then fermented followed by distillation to get bioalcohol. However, direct sugar sources such as lignocellulosic biomass and oilseed material can be exposed to fermentation by microorganism catalysts to obtain alcohol. Some types of biomass feedstock such as agricultural waste (straw), wood and forest residues are used to produce bioalcohol [70]. Brazil is the largest sugarcane world producer [102] so that a great number of lignocellulosic residues (bagasse and straw) are generated during ethanol and sugar production. These residues can be used as substrates in a chemical reaction where enzymes or cell catalysis are included to synthesize different kinds of compounds such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, and amino acids [103]. Currently, 1-hexanol has application in fragrances and plasticizers industries, but its production on a large scale still is in the research stage in the country [103]. An adequate enzyme used in sugar fermentation can produce higher alcohols such as butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol which have better mixing capability due to their long alkyl carbon chain [104]. The large alcohols (C4 and C5) have a higher Lower heating value, are not hygroscopic and less volatile when compared to ethanol [105]. Microbial engineering is mainly used in 1-hexanol production. The interest regarding the synthesis of higher chain volatile alcohols from engineered micro-organism has been increasing due to energetic and sustainable concerns. The 1-butanol and 1-hexanol are the alcohols of most interest found in the literature, since it has been reported that they are obtained from ethanol and acetate fermentation, using native organisms such as Clostridium kluyveri. Dekyshima et al. [106], showed that it is possible to synthesize 1-hexanol from glucose, a carbon renewable source, using an Escherichia coli strain. This organism, considered host, has fast growth rates and is a facultative anaerobe, allowing a flexible and economic process on a large-scale production. It was reported by Marcheschi et al. [107] that through this method, it is possible to obtain hexanol concentrations from 302 m g L − 1 of glucose. Another method used to produce alcohols is the syngas fermentation which uses Clostridium carboxidivorans bacteria which is capable of growth from C O and H 2 (components of syngas), to produce ethanol, butanol, hexanol and other alcohols as coproducts by reduction of organic acids formed in the mechanism for energy conversion and synthesis of cell material [108]. It is reported by Phillips et al. [108] that through this method: butanol, hexanol and ethanol are obtained in concentrations from 1.0 g L − 1 , 1.0 g L − 1 g L − 1 and 3.0 g L − 1 g L − 1 of syngas, respectively. In the gasification lignocellulosic biomass such as bagasse or straw [108] can be used for the syngas production in approximately 2 N m 3 k g − 1 of biomass in fixed bed reactor [109]. The n – hexanol is considered a potential long-term alternative biofuel if new pathways of production would be developed. Kick et al. [104] studied five blends of biofuel types as a possible alternative for jet fuel, finding that, blending synthetic kerosene (obtained from Fischer - Tropsch process) with 20% of 1-hexanol meets the requirements as a possible aircraft fuel alternative. Chuck and Donnelly [12], studied the compatibility of nine biofuel types with Jet-A1, finding that, blending up to 10% of 1-hexanol with Jet-A1, viscosity and density are obtained which are suitable and compatible with Jet-A1. However, the mixture flash point decreases by less than 38 °C . It was concluded that 1-hexanol is not suitable as an aviation alternative fuel for concentration higher than 10%. Additionally, the same research found out that Limonene would be an excellent substitute for Jet-A1."
8,Fischer Tropsch – thermochemical process,"3.6 Fischer Tropsch – thermochemical process Another process to obtain alternative fuels is the Fischer – Tropsch (F – T) process. These fuels are an important alternative for internal combustion engines. Synthetic fuel can be obtained from coal, waste, gas and biomass gasification by the F – T process; being considered as the only alternative jet fuel. This biofuel type mixed with fossil jet fuel up to 50% [66], seems like the most promising alternative to be used in aircraft engine [104]. They are produced by catalytic conversion of syngas ( C O and H 2 ) . However, the conversion technology is expensive and its efficiency ranges between 25% and 50%. Biofuels produced using a F – T process have low lubricity due to the absence of sulfur, but this problem is overcome when they are blended with petroleum - based fuels [59]. In Brazil, though there aren't still facilities for large scale production through the thermochemical route (F – T), this technology is being tested to be used shortly by Petrobras in collaboration with the British Compact GTL [29]. This project considered more than 30 pilot units that reproduce on a short scale the operation made by Petrobras refineries. Among these, two pilot plants for biomass gasification, which use as feedstock Brazilian sugarcane, and one pilot plant for Fischer-Tropsch process with both technologies being used for high purity biofuels production such as jet fuel, diesel and renewable lubricants [110]. Additionally, synthetic paraffinic kerosene produced using the F – T process has low density (775 k g m − 3 ) and either high power and fuel economy due to high energy density (44.3 M J k g − 1 ) [111]. One alternative that is considered in Brazil is the use of Eucalyptus besides sugarcane and forest residues (straw) in the gasification process [57,63]. One point to favour, is the high availability of Eucalyptus wood in Brazilian lands, where there are more than 700 varieties, benefiting from their adaptability, big potential for growth both in area and productivity [112]. This happens because, besides representing a strong economic incentive to low-carbon, forests play a fundamental role in the generation of several products from cellulose to paper to wood itself to cleaner fuels, like cellulosic biomass and ethanol. In this context, private and state entities have been engaging to broaden their efforts to make Brazil a country highly competitive in this market [112]. Brazil is the country with the largest forest productivity and more sustainable products [112]. Besides the investment in forest management and genetic enhancement, according to the Brazilian tree industry (Ibá-Industria Brasileira de Árvores), two important announcements on cellulose factories expansion in 2015 contributed to keeping the Brazilian market as one of the largest producers of this input worldwide [112]. Eucalyptus is the species that is most cultivated by foresters and occupies 5.56 Mha in the entire national territory. It includes 15 states of which four are the largest producers: Minas Gerais (25.77%), São Paulo (17.97%), Mato Grosso do Sul (14.79%) and Bahía (11.61%). It is reported by Cantarella et al. [8] that, Eucalyptus fresh mass yield is 40 cubic meters per hectare per year, moreover the Eucalyptus trunk density is considered as 560 K g m − 3 [113]. In Brazil, there are 10 Mha of degradable land available for silviculture initiatives [112]."
9,Greenhouse emissions,"Based on the Kyoto protocol, carbon dioxide ( C O 2 ) is considered the compound of most influence in climate change and global warming [60]. C O 2 emissions are increasing every year, being commercial air transport one of the main contributor of the atmospheric pollution whose potential would reach 3% of total C O 2 emissions by 2050 [70]. The aeronautical industry is working to reduce the C O 2 emissions, for example, it has been reported that the aircraft Boeing's 787 got decrease its emissions per passenger in 20% [60]. Biojet fuels have a high freezing point, low thermal stability in engines and low stability for long storage time, meaning that biojet fuels must be adapted for regular use in aircraft [76]. All the conversion technologies considered in this study are used in biojet production whose composition is mainly alkanes. For this motive, biojet fuel never would completely replace petroleum-based jet fuel due to the absence of aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloparaffins in biomass-based oil [114]. To use a biojet fuel fully pure, it is necessary a suitable biological source both aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloparaffins. Chemically, the main compositions of the jet fuel both commercial and military applications can be classified such as paraffin, naphthalene and aromatics, i.e., n – paraffin (20%), iso – paraffin (40%), cycloalkanes (20%) and 20%vol. Aromatics hydrocarbons (i.e., naphthalene) ranging from C9 – C16 [115]. To avoid the negative effects on the atmosphere such as greenhouse gases ( C O 2 ) and acid gases emissions ( S O x and N O x ) there's a maximum limitation for aromatics (25%vol.), sulfur (3000 ppm) and olefins (5%vol.). Besides, these concentrations help the jet fuel controlling the freezing point, sulfur oxides emissions and gums and sediments formation during storage [114]. An excessive amount of sulfur degrades the thermal stability of jet fuel. A concentration up to 30%vol. Of aromatics lead to sediment formation during storage [116]. Concentrations ranging from 30 to 40% of aromatic hydrocarbons lead not only to sediment formation but also soluble resins through the dissolution of one part of sediments and formation of high aromatic products (mainly bicyclic and polycyclic) [116]. The aromatic compounds play an important role in the security and quality of jet fuel, especially elastomeric swelling, material compatibility and lubricity characteristics [114]. Chen and Xia [14] studied the impact of aromatic compounds on jet fuel. They concluded that the addition of aromatic compounds to the common jet fuel (25%vol. Of aromatics) led to a volume increase of the fuel tank due to seal swell. On the other hand, the addition of aromatic compounds to a jet fuel/biofuel blend led to a volume increase of the fuel tank greater than in pure jet fuel. Besides, it was concluded that possible leaks in the fuel tank are associated with the seal shrinkage due to the poor swelling characteristics of the transported fuel. Considering all of the above, the mixture of up to 50%vol biojet fuel into petroleum-based jet fuel is the maximum allowed. Additionally, it has been reported that 8%vol is the minimum concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons into fuel for aeronautical applications [14]. It has been found that by adding the aromatic compounds required to the biojet fuel, the production of fully synthetic jet fuel (FSJF) would be achieved [14]. In this pathway, lignin (the main compound of the lignocellulosic biomass) is the feedstock more promising for cyclic alkanes and aromatics production through several strategies such as hydrogenation, oxidation, fast pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis [114]. Bi et al. [76] have demonstrated that is possible to produce both aromatic hydrocarbons C8 – C15 through the lignin catalytic depolymerization in low carbon aromatic C6 – C8 together with aromatics alkylation (hydrogen removed at low temperatures) and cycloparaffins by the hydrogenation of aromatics C8 – C15. In this investigation, 0.173 ± 0.012 k g a r o m . k g l i g . − 1 (kilogram of aromatic compounds C8 – C15 by each kilogram of lignin processed) were also obtained. Besides, after the hydrogenation of aromatics 0.175 ± 0.015 k g c i c l . k g l i g . − 1 (kilogram of cycloalkanes C8 – C15 by each kilogram of lignin processed) were produced. It means that cycloalkanes and aromatics C8 – C15 are two lignin products that, blended with biojet fuel up to 25%vol., would meet the requirements of fully synthetic jet fuel [76]. In this pathway, Japan aiming to use alternative fuels in all flights for the Tokyo Olympics of 2021 [5]. Table 8 shows some countries, in collaboration with airline companies, that are performing flight trials using biofuels to implement the use of sustainable jet fuel. Considering the fuel consumed in the aviation sector, which is approximately 1.5–1.7 billion barrels of Jet-A1 per year, it is evident that even 1% usage of biofuels in the aeronautical industry would become positive from economic and environmental points of view [5]. Table 9 shows some flight tests with biojet fuels in both commercial airlines and U.S. military aircraft types. Tests to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuel, obtained by both Fischer Tropsch (F-T) and FAME process, have been performed aiming to reduce the particulate matter. Results show that particulate matter is reduced up to 50% with the use of biofuels (see Fig. 8 ). Life cycle analyzes of an alternative fuel include the greenhouse gas emissions relative to the entire production cycle. In the case of aeronautical biofuels, this analysis uses the functional unit of C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 and the analyzed system consists of 5 steps [117]: 1) Acquisition of raw material (biomass cultivation) 2) Transport of raw material 3) Jet biofuel production (feedstock extraction, recovery and transportation inside facility) 4) Transport and distribution of jet biofuel 5) Use in the airplane (combustion process) These stages can be divided into two groups: a) Harvest, production and distribution of jet biofuel, called Well To Tank (WTT) b) Fuel combustion, called Tank To Wake (TTW) A Life-Cycle assessment that considers emissions from feedstock harvest to the wake behind aircraft can provide the change in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions due to the use of biojet fuel [59]. According to Bauen et al. [118], this analysis is frequently termed as Well to Wake (WTW) analysis. In the case of petroleum-based jet fuel, the GHG emissions in the portions WTT and TTW were accounted to be 14.3 g C O 2 e q M J − 1 and 73.2 g C O 2 e q M J − 1 , respectively, totalizing 85.5 g C O 2 e q M J − 1 in the WTW analysis. When a biojet fuel is used in the aircraft gas turbine, GHG emissions could be reduced to 1.5 g C O 2 e q M J − 1 (biojet fuel from algal oil, for example), i.e., 98.2% reduction with respect to petroleum-based jet fuel [59]. Fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas result from geologically captured carbon sources, and the carbon is released in the form of C O 2 when the fuel is burned. Biomass absorbs C O 2 during its growth. The C O 2 emitted by the fuel burning is the same as that absorbed during biomass cultivation. Therefore, several biofuels have a “biomass credit” that compensates to the C O 2 emissions in life cycle analyses. This biomass credit is referred to the GHG emissions, and it is the main difference between biomass and fossil fuel. However, a biofuel does not necessarily have lower GHG emissions than those of fossil fuels. Generally, the production of jet biofuel results in the creation of co-products in addition to the primary fuel. Most of the co-products produced are biomass and liquid biofuels. They have an added value that can be quantified based on their energy content or the ability to replace some other product already on the market. In this form, four parameters can be considered: 1) Mass allocation (emission contribution of C O 2 based on replacing an existing product with a co-product in the production chain) 2) Energy allocation (emission contribution of C O 2 based on the energy content of each co-product obtained in the production chain) 3) Market value allocation (emission contribution of C O 2 based on market prices for the main product and co-products) 4) Displacement (system expansion) Different from the approaches of energy and mass allocation, the market value allocation can change with time. It is due to that approach of market value allocation that the emission contribution is related to the market prices of the co-products and main product. In this context, if co-products are generated in quantities that stand to flood existing markets, then it can lead the co-product prices to zero. Staples et al. [117] evaluated the GHG life cycle of three types of raw materials candidates for the production of biofuel. These were: sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass in both fermentation and advanced fermentation processes. They defined a reference point (baseline) considering seven stages, as shown in Table 10 . The study reveals that the cultivation of biomass and the production of jet biofuels are the stages of the greatest contribution to the life cycle of GHG emissions. This is caused by N 2 O emissions in the application of fertilizers, which contribute with approximately 1.3, 15.3, and 9.8 g C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 for sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass, respectively. On the other hand, in the production phase of jet biofuels, external energy may be necessary, thus increasing the contribution of GHG emissions to production. For example, in the processing of sugarcane, external energy is not necessary since the sugarcane bagasse provides sufficient fuel for the cogeneration of heat and energy [119]. It is also reported by Staples et al. [117] that 0.27 M J N G is needed to generate 0.020 k W h e l e c . , and 0.018 k W h e l e c . , for each MJ of biofuel jet produced from corn kernels and switchgrass, respectively. However, these figures do not include requirements for hydrotreating fatty acids. On the other hand, sugarcane provides additional energy of 0.029 k W h e l e c . , per M J j e t b i o f u e l , which can be exported to the external network. This generates a carbon credit that results in negative values in the GHG life cycle when the displacement method is applied instead of the approach of market value allocation. Biomass also has the potential to release or capture C O 2 as a consequence of LUC (land-use change). These events are caused by the exchange of biomass, soil and organic waste contained on and within the land. In some cases, these emissions may dominate the GHG life cycle of the biofuel route. The land-use changes can be divided into two categories [120]: 1) Direct land-use change (dLUC), referring to the change of land of natural vegetation (or tropical jungle) for the cultivation of the biomass of interest, causing a change in the capacity of the land to capture C O 2 . 2) Indirect land-use change (iLUC), referring to the change of land in any other region of the world produced by the cultivation of certain biomass, that is, outside the boundary of the system being assessed (“butterfly effect”). This usually occurs when dLUC replaces a raw material already on the market, so an attempt is made to make up for the deficit. The magnitude of the emissions generated by the LUC will depend on the type of land converted into a cultivation field and the type of seed to be cultivated. dLUC also involves the conversion of land for the construction of biorefineries for the production of biofuels [121]. According to Staples et al. [117], the dLUC-associated emissions for sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass are those shown in Table 11 . However, these values were calculated on the assumption that dLUC emissions are amortized over 30 years. These results indicate that the cultivation of biomass in lands that had not been previously cultivated (uncultivated land) could significantly increase its contribution to the GHG life cycle in jet biofuel production. Thus, comparing Tables 10 and 11, increases in the sugarcane baseline, corn grain and switchgrass are observed, from 12.7 to 48.1, 62.6 to 11.3, and 37.4 to 40,3 C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 , respectively. On the other hand, if the land was previously cultivated by other seeds, the environmental impact is not significant when it is replaced by another type of biomass. However, these emissions are highly dependent upon the specific scenery in which the biomass is cultivated. Staples et al. [117] concluded that, in the assumption of the baseline sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass, their contribution to the life cycle GHG emissions decreased by 86%, 30% and 58% compared to conventional jet fuel, respectively. Also, sugarcane shows less contribution to the GHG life cycle since the residual material (bagasse) excess can be used as an energy source for heat and power cogeneration. This benefit would be increased with the use of more efficient conversion technologies, such as gasification instead of incineration. Within the assessment of the environmental impacts caused by the production of biofuels, it is necessary to consider additional criteria such as thermal pollution of water in heat cogeneration, power and conversion of biofuels, in addition to the availability of water for the growth of biomass in the field of cultivation, either rain (green water) or irrigation (blue water) [122]. Currently, second and third-generation biofuels are also being used to reduce the emissions caused by petroleum-based fuels [5]. In this manner, depending on the feedstock available in each country some oil crops can be used as extraction source of biofuels either edible such as canola, soybean, cotton, palm and coconut oils [123], or non-edible such as camelina, jatropha, algae, halophytes, municipal and sewage waste, forest residues etc. [5]. On the other hand, sugarcane (the main feedstock to obtain ethanol) absorbs a great amount of C O 2 from the environment, so that, a larger amount of land is available for its growing. It will open a pathway to the increase of biofuel production and environmental purification [36,39,40,124]. Concerning the Jatropha, a detailed study was carried out by Bailis and Baka [125] in the Brazilian context. It was found that biojet fuel obtained from Jatropha oil emits 40 C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 reducing the C O 2 emissions in 55% compared to conventional jet fuel. The acquisition of biomass is the most polluting stage in the life cycle of biojet fuel, contributing approximately 43% of the total emissions in the baseline. The main factors that contribute to emissions at this stage are the production and transport of lime and fertilizer, in addition to the emissions of C O 2 and N 2 O which result when these compounds are applied to the land corresponding to 18% of the total. Lands in Brazil are highly acidic so that agricultural lime ( C a C O 3 ) or dolomite ( C a M g ) is often applied to reduce soil pH. It is reported by Bailis and Baka [125] that Jatropha growers in Brazil apply an average of 2 t o n h a − 1 . Of limestone. Additional emissions arise from irrigation (∼4%). Transportation of both seed and refined oil over long distances contributions 26% of the total emissions. Finally, contributions to the refinement of biojet fuel is 27% of the total, with most of these emissions arising from hydrogen production from methane vapor reform. On the other hand, the co-products generated in the production of biojet fuel from Jatropha are an excellent option to optimize the process and reduce C O 2 emissions. In this context, the co-products with great potential obtained in feedstock-biojet fuel facilities are seedcake, husk (from oil extraction) and liquid biofuels. Thus, three possible options are considered to reduce your contribution to the life cycle GHG: 1) Seedcake and husk are used as fertilizers instead of commercial fertilizers. 2) Seedcake and husk are compressed into solid briquettes and used as boiler fuel. These briquettes could replace any fossil fuel, providing heat in industrial applications. 3) Liquid biofuels could replace equivalent volumes of petroleum-based fuels. A summary of the benefits obtained from this procedure is shown in Table 12 . The choice of suitable land for the culture of biomass is another important factor in determining the environmental impact (positive or negative) of biojet fuel production. Thus, if the chosen land were characterized by the relatively low carbon stocks capacity such as: grassing cattle, cropland, pasture, or dry-zone grassland, then the culture of biomass would increase its carbon stocks capacity. However, if the chosen land was characterized by its high carbon stocks capacity such as natural moist-zone grassland or native vegetation (shrubland), then the culture of biomass would result in the possible net loss of carbon or “carbon debt”. It is reported by Bailis and Baka [125] that the conversion from moist - zone grassland to Jatropha results in ∼ 8 t C h a − 1 of carbon loss, producing 16 C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 . In the case of Shrublands, there is a loss of ∼ 50 t C h a − 1 resulting in the addition of 100 C O 2 − e q M J b i o j e t f u e l − 1 to net emissions in biojet fuel production, which is extremely negative from the environmental point of view. Another negative effect of cultivating Jatropha in the dry-zone and the moist-zone forest is the increase in emissions 3–4 times greater than the emissions generated by the production of conventional jet fuel. Interactions between biomass growth yield and dLUC are also critical. Thus, if the land used was characterized by the low capacity to carbon stocks, then a low growth yield would result in a greater amount of hectares for the cultivation of biomass (to satisfy production) and, therefore, greater capacity to capture carbon for each MJ of biojet fuel produced. The opposite is true for high growth yield. On the other hand, if the land were characterized by the high carbon stocks capacity, which could decrease with the culture of biomass, then a low growth yield would result in a greater number of hectares for growing biomass and, therefore, fewer carbon stocks capacity for each MJ of biojet fuel produced. Again, the opposite is true for high growth yield. Bailis and Baka [125] concluded that replacing conventional jet fuel with biojet fuel, obtained from Jatropha oil, leads to a net reduction in GHG emissions. However, more detailed studies are necessary, including emissions of determining factors such as frequency of fertilizer application, transport distance, use of irrigation and biomass growth yield. In addition, variations in GHG emissions could appear depending on the alternative use of Jatropha's co-products (seedcake and husk) and the different techniques used for their complete utilization. Currently, EMBRAPA [126] aiming to detoxify the seedcake and husk to be used in animal feed. In this way, an added value would be obtained in the Jatropha production chain resulting in a feedstock more attractive in the biofuels market. Finally, in Table 13 is shown a summary of GHG emissions for biojet fuels obtained by the different conversion routes. In Table 13, it is observed negative values for the GHG emissions in different routes. It means that, if the co-products are used efficiently, lower environmental impacts will be generated. In the case of the jatropha, its co-products (seedcake and husk) can be used as natural fertilizers and biofuels (briquets), for this motive its environmental benefit is significant. In all cases (except the jatropha) life cycle GHG emissions based on energy allocation are low because the feedstocks (considering for the biojet fuel production) are co-products of the sugar and soybean meal."
10,Techno-economic analysis,"As it has been reported in previous sections, Brazil has some biomass alternatives for biojet fuel production. Currently, its main energy renewable source is the sugarcane from which, ethanol can be obtained (anhydrous and hydrated), as well as sugar and electricity (see Fig. 3). However, the production plants can be configured to work in an integrated processes series [63] for the biofuels production which, are proper for the aeronautic sector. The main goal of this section is to make a techno-economic assessment of potential biofuels to be blended with jet fuel as suggested in precedent sections, to lower greenhouse gases emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Table 14 shows the chemical-physical properties of the biojet fuel candidates. This analysis spans from the amount of necessary feedstock and hectares of available land for its culture to minimum per liter selling prices of produced biojet fuel, depending on the technology used. Table 15 shows technical data on process type, main input, amount of input, biojet fuel produced, conversion efficiency and minimum per liter selling prices of biojet fuel. According to Bailis and Baka [125], the conversion efficiency from Jatropha oil to biojet fuel is 48.39%, i.e., for each kg of jatropha oil processed, it is obtained 0.48 kg of biojet fuel. Considering the current year, it could be concluded that the calculations carried out (with available data in the literature) adequately approximate the future biojet fuel production in the Brazilian context. In conversion technologies that use the same feedstock (sugarcane), as the biochemical process (farnesane), Fischer-Tropsch and Alcohol to Jet, the minimum selling prices are influenced by co-products obtained in the process. For example, green biodiesel can be used in distribution logistic as agricultural operations (sugarcane cultivation and harvesting) and transport of sugarcane stalks and forest residues (straw). This practice helps to reduce overall biomass production cost and lower environmental impacts. According to Klein et al. [63], when petroleum-based diesel is used, the production cost of sugarcane stalks and straw (dry basis) are 17.89 U $$ t o n − 1 and 20.33 U $$ t o n − 1 , respectively. The oil barrel price also varies depending on the final destination. Thus, Klein et al. [63] considered different prices sceneries: U $$ 40 , U $$ 70 , U $$ 100 oil barrels, to be transported from U.S. Gulf Coast to the Port of Santos (state of São Paulo, Brazil), so that, the jet fuel prices associated were of 0.33 U $$ L − 1 , 0.55 U $$ L − 1 , 0.76 U $$ L − 1 , respectively. The deductive method was used aiming to show the content from the premises. Thus, based on data collected from scientific literature and specified in precedent sections of this work an estimation was made of both produced biojet fuel and necessary hectares for the feedstock cultivated in Brazilian land. Besides, it was chosen as inlet data the largest jet fuel production, in Brazil, in the last ten years, accounting for 7.5 billion liters in 2014. Moreover, the mixture limits already approved internationally for biojet fuel were used. In this study, it was assumed a mixture of biojet fuels in the following proportions: • HEFA fuel: 35%vol. • Biodiesel: 5%vol. • Farnesane: 10%vol. • Hexanol: 10%vol. • FT – SPK: 25%vol. • ATJ – SPK: 15%vol. The substitution target in the country was considered up to 10%vol (750 million liters of biojet fuel). Fig. 9 shows the biojet fuel production and the necessary lands for the culture of feedstock with the substitution target of up to 10% vol. Considering that each region of the country produces a specific biojet fuel, depending of the natural resource's abundance would be more beneficial than the same biojet fuel produced throughout the country. This scenario is observed in biodiesel production with application to road transport, whose main feedstock are soybeans, animal tallow, and cottonseeds. In Fig. 9a it is observed that the largest amount of land necessary for the feedstock cultivate is represented by biodiesel which, it needs from 0.87 to 4.36 Mha for the biodiesel production than could be used in the substitution from 2 to 10% vol., respectively, in the aeronautic sector. This would be the maximum limit for mixture limit to avoid competition with the automotive industry. The Jatropha and sugarcane need almost the same quantity of lands in the range from 50.48 kha to 252.38 kha to reach the substitution target from 2 to 10%vol., respectively. However, using the sugarcane as feedstock three biojet fuel types can be extracted: hexanol, farnesane and FT – SPK. Besides, butanol is obtained as a co-product for biojet fuel production by ATJ – SPK. Therefore, in Fig. 9b the total hectares for the culture of sugarcane is the sum of necessary hectares to produce: farnesane, hexanol, FT – SPK and ATJ – SPK. Fig. 9c shows the necessary million liters per year of each biojet fuel considered in this work to reach the substitution target of up to 10% vol., in the Brazilian energy matrix. The evaluation presented in Fig. 9a was made considering that each biojet fuel was produced from harvested feedstock independently, i.e., that there are hectares available for the production of each one, no matter that some biojet fuel can be produced from the same feedstock and/or forest residues as would be in ATJ – SPK, farnesane, hexanol and FT – SPK cases. It is reported by Bailis and Baka [125] that for each 22.6 kg of biojet fuel by the SPK pathway, it can be obtained 18 kg of liquid biofuels as co-products, which represents an excellent alternative for the reduction of GHG emissions in the production chain. This participation would be prioritized in the more critical stages of life cycle GHG emissions in biojet fuel production, i.e., in the acquisition and transportation of raw material. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the co-products (Green diesel or Green Nafta) with the increase of biojet fuel production. For the calculation, it was assumed that the density of green diesel is the same that FAME biodiesel (see Table 14). On the other hand, biojet fuel produced from the same feedstock can be integrated both to decrease the operative expenses as to increase production performance. A more comprehensive treatment of this process was made by Kleen et al. [63]. Based on this idea, it is proposed, in the present work, an integrated process for the biojet fuel production using as feedstock the sugarcane and its forest residues (straw), as shown in Fig. 11 . The result of the evaluation of this process is shown in Fig. 12 . Two scenarios are presented. If the process is: 1) self-sustained or 2) it needs auxiliary energy. Fig. 12a shows the need to increase 7.79% of the quantity of cultivating lands to achieve a self-sustained process, i.e., without dependence on external energy. Therefore, a self-sustained process without sacrificing a considerable number of hectares is possible. Fig. 12b shows that the integrated process decreases the quantity of necessary feedstock for biojet fuel production up to 19.16% in the case of sugarcane and 56.12% in the case of forest residues. Besides, it is shown in Fig. 12c, an increase in co-products generation such as anhydrous ethanol and butanol which, would be used for the additional biojet fuel production through the ATJ process. Fig. 12c shows that the greater quantity of butanol is produced because in an integrated process there is an additional ethanol and butanol production. Moreover, for each liter of ethanol, 1.84 L of butanol are produced. This conversion pathway is shown in Fig. 11. In supplementary material can be found details of calculating the number of hectares necessary for biojet fuel production. Besides, it can be found the methodology used to obtain the different biojet fuels shown in Fig. 11."
11,Fuel effects on range versus payload,"The type of fuel used in an aircraft affects its range and maximum payload. Depending on the flight plan the heavy fuels are prioritized for range more than for load. On the other hand, light fuels are prioritized for load more than for range [111]. Breguet range equation (Eq. (3)) is used to evaluate the effects of change of fuel in an aircraft which, assumes that the aircraft is already in horizontal position and height cruising with the full fuel tanks. In real flights, the fuel tanks are partially filled so that, sometimes it is considered that, the amount of fuel to be 20% of the tank's total capacity [111]. (3) R = 1000 V ( L / D ) g . s f c . ln ( W 0 W 0 − x W f ) In which, R : range (km), V : flight speed ( m s − 1 ) , L / D : lift/drag ratio, g : gravitational constant ( 9.81 m s − 2 ) , s f c : specific fuel consumption ( m g N − 1 s − 1 ) , W 0 : aircraft weight at start (N) or maximum structural load of aircraft and W f : fuel weight (N), x : fraction of tank full of fuel. Despite that this equation does not consider other important constraints to use biofuels in an aircraft, it provides a first evaluation regarding the effects of changes in fuel properties over payload and range. The aircraft speed ( V ) will not be affected by the change in fuel characteristics, i.e., the released heating of the combustion chamber over the gas turbine and cruise thrust should be equal to offered by conventional jet fuel [111]. This formulation is shown in Eq. (4): (4) V a l t = V J e t f u e l Eq. (4) can also be written as Eq. (5): (5) s f c a l t = s f c J e t f u e l ( L H V J e t f u e l L H V a l t ) L H V is the Lower Heating Value ( M J k g − 1 ) . In this way, Eq. (3) turn out in Eq. (6): (6) R = 1000 L H V ( L / D ) g . ln ( W 0 W 0 − x W f ) To evaluate the effects of the fuel change on payload, it was used the operational characteristics of aircraft 737-300-CFM563B1 provided by Blakey et al. [111] and shown in Table 16 . Once those parameters are known the allowable capacity is reached, i.e., up to x = 0.2 (or 20%) in Eq. (6), the additional flight range is obtained by sacrificing the maximum payload and increasing the fuel mass by the same quantity, as shown in Eq. (7): (7) R = 1000 L H V ( L / D ) g . ln ( W 0 W 0 − y W p . m a x ) Where y is the fraction of sacrificed maximum payload ranging from 0 to 0.8 (or 80%), i.e., the free space initially. An example calculation is shown in Appendix A. Fig. 13 shows the range/payload relation for nine biofuel types (jet fuel was used to compare) applying the Breguet range equation (Eq. (6)). It is observed that five biojet fuels reached the high range: HEFA fuel, FT – SPK, Biojet fuel blends, ATJ – SPK and Farnesane. Biojet fuel blends are referred to a mix of biofuels proposed in the proportions considered in section 5. On the other hand, the lowest ranges are reached by ethanol and butanol. In Fig. 13 the horizontal straight line indicates the relation between range and maximum payload, and its length would depend on fuel volume in the aircraft tank. Even though commercial aircraft operate with an amount of necessary fuel to meet with their flight plan, Blakey et al. [111] use as reference an amount of fuel equivalent to 20% of the tank volume, based on actual flight plans. The incline straight line indicates the additional travelled range by aircraft when it is decreased the maximum payload and the fuel amount is increased in the same value. In this way, the maximum weight is not affected. Commercial aircraft tend to fly near their maximum payload; hence their main interest will be to use light fuels (low density) to reach the required range. On the other hand, in military applications the main interest is to reach flight range with full fuel tanks, therefore heavy fuels that occupy less space will be more suitable. It is important to highlight that, although some biofuels with low density seem to render less than conventional jet fuel, at the allowed range, they can offer one alternative for a flight of short time without sacrificing the payload. Fig. 14 shows the spatial volume increase of fuel in the aircraft tank as a range function. The spatial volume increase (%) is not the volume of fuel consumed to travel a given distance, but it is an increase in occupied space by the fuel into the fuel tank. It is observed that alcohols with less density (ethanol and butanol) occupy a greater spatial volume into the fuel tank than other biofuels to cover the same range. However, the increase in spatial volume does not depend on its density only, but also on its lower heating value. For example, for the same distance travelled, the change in the occupied volume ( Δ V ) by the ATJ – SPK is approximately equal to the biodiesel which, has more density than ATJ – SPK, therefore, its mass ( ρ Δ V = Δ m ) would increase. It is compatible with the fact that biodiesel having a low LHV will have to transport a greater quantity of fuel to achieve the same distance. Thus, it will be necessary a greater payload sacrifice, i.e., less weight in aircraft will be transported, as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, if the lower heating value is approximately equal (according to ASTM D7566) for all candidate biofuels that could be used in aviation then the fuel mass will be the same, consequently, two alternatives are presented: a) if the fuel density is low then the occupied volume in the tank will be higher; b) if the fuel density is high then the occupied volume in the tank will be lower. The fact that Δ V A T J − S P K is lightly greater than biodiesel is due to its less density, but it does not mean there is a greater mass of ATJ – SPK than biodiesel, according to m = ρ V . Since between both fuels, there is a little difference in ( Δ V A T J − Δ V b i o ) but a high difference in ( ρ b i o − ρ A T J ) . In Fig. 14, it is also observed that, for the same increase of occupied space or spatial volume (for example, 40%), greater distance will be travelled by the biodiesel, since it has a greater density (less molecular distance) allowing a greater amount of fuel mass entry to the tank to achieve the required volume, that is, more energy with payload bias."
12,Future perspectives,"From a socio-economic and environmental point of view four types of feedstocks considered in this study (see Fig. 9b) are strong candidates to be used in biojet fuel production. However, Brazil, being a country of great territorial extension, good weather conditions, investment in long term investigation and policies for the intervention of the sector private, offers other attractive feedstocks for biojet fuel production. EMBRAPA – Agroenergy [126] have identified approximately nine types of potential feedstocks to be used in biojet fuel production such as Camelina, Sunflower, Peanuts, Castor beans, Cassava, Palm (Dendê), Macauba, solid municipal waste and used cooking oil which, are addressed in seventeen projects with three main pillars: 1) Biomass (67%) 2) Biomass conversion (15%) 3) Products (18%) Biomass and biomass conversion represent 75% of the financial resources raised [126]. This evidence the interest to discover new potential energy sources for their future conversion into biofuels on a large and small scale. In Brazil can be found four groups of feedstocks: sugar, oil, lignocellulose and wastes. Vegetable oils such as Palm, Camelina, Jatropha and used cooking oil are feedstocks with relative ease to be turned in biojet fuel, so that, their conversion technology is less expensive [126]. However, they have a high acquisition cost, since, there are some involved factors for their large-scale cultivation such as labour, specific growing areas, qualification and training of workers [139]. On the other hand, solid municipal waste, pine tree and eucalyptus have a conversion technology more expensive but due to they are generated in abundance and without specific care (cultivation and harvest) their acquisition cost is low. Additionally, sugarcane, pine tree and eucalyptus can be produced with a significant reduction in C O 2 lifecycle [139]. The need for diversification of feedstock in Brazil not due to lack of biomass, but to the preoccupation of the Federal Government to promote the regional integration (mainly in the North and Northeast regions) and social integration of small or middle producer and family farming [126]. This integration would be possible in the medium term if it is considered the culture of feedstocks with great potential in these regions such as palm oil (dendê) and Marauba. This type of strategy is called “Diversification, but with focus” [126]. Palm oil presents greater production volume in the international market, consequently competitive prices. Besides, it would present an aggregate value if the residues obtained in its production chain are adequately used [139]. In this context, sugarcane results to be a feedstock highly competitive, since both sugarcane bagasse and straws are used for biojet fuel production in the different conversion routes (see Fig. 10), in addition to heat and power cogeneration. All potential feedstocks can be turned into biojet fuel through the HEFA process. Nevertheless, an adequate study must be realized for each specific feedstock, since a different quantity of hydrogen would be supplied, aim to meet with the requirements drop-in Ref. [139]. This would result in an acceptance or rejection of a given feedstock for this process. Solid municipal waste (SMW) and industrial waste can also be turned into biojet fuel, but through the F – T process. However, the economic aspects involved in this process have few been studied, mainly for the SMW such as separation cost and processing of different constituents [139]. In Brazil, there are initiatives to encourage industrial development and deepen knowledge of the community techno-scientific on biojet fuel (BioQAV) [140]. Thus, it is registered the law project n 0 9.321/2017 [141], which it has as goal the creation of the “National Program of the Biokerosene” (PNB) to encourage, in addition, the production from clean energy. Also, other initiatives are registered such as the Brazilian Network of Biokerosene and Renewable Hydrocarbons for the Aviation (RBQAV), Mining and Wood zone platforms of Biokerosene and Renewables, which they have as goal encourage the research on this biofuel [140]. The Energy Research Company (EPE) collaborated with the International Cooperation Agency of Germany (GIZ) in a project for the creation of a reference model in the use of sustainable synthetic fuels in Brazil [140]. The project indicated that aviation synthetic fuels would have economic competitiveness after 2030 in remote regions of the country. Besides, it is estimated that BioQAV would have entry to the Brazilian energy matrix in 2027, achieving participation in the market of 103,000 m 3 in 2029, corresponding to ∼1% of the total demand for plane fuel in the country [140]. It is worth noting that the total jet fuel consumed in 2014 (∼7.5 million liters) was used as a reference to estimate biojet fuel production. Nevertheless, the projection for fuel consumption is 10.3 million liters in 2029. Therefore, the calculation methodology, based on conversion factors, shown in this work approximate in a reasonable way the future participation of biojet fuel in the Brazilian market. In addition, it is revelated the number of lands necessary for the culture of biomass depending on the conversion route chosen. The logistic of conventional jet fuel is well organized in Brazil [139]. However, it is necessary to improve the transportation infrastructure since it is relatively poor and most of the biomass is bulky materials. Besides, the greater fuel consumption is focused in large international airports which are localized near refineries. A small fraction of fossil jet fuel is distributed to small airports in the region either airways or waterways [139]. Additionally, some regions of the country receive almost exclusively imported jet fuel. All of these important aspects should be considered in the implementation of a national policy encouraging biojet fuel production [139]. Currently, Brazil accounts for 13 large airports responsible by the 85%vol. Of jet fuel consumption, 10 of them (72%) receive direct fuel supply from refineries being near, 2 airports (7%) receive imported fossil jet fuel by waterways and Brasilia International Airport (6%) receive fuel from a refinery located 700 km [139]. Therefore, it is necessary to build mixture points near airports and suppliers for an adequate implementation of biojet fuel in the national market. In this way, it will be possible to have quality control and issue reliable certificates of each biojet fuel batch [139]."
13,Final considerations,"The evaluation of the potential feedstock for biojet fuel production focused in the Brazilian frame was presented. Based on this study it was concluded that Brazil has a great number of available lands for the feedstock culture from which biojet fuel can be produced as long as a suitable conversion technology is applied. In this sense, FT – SPK and ATJ – SPK are the more promising from an economic point of view despite being in a development phase in the country. On the other hand, HEFA is the process best known in the Brazilian petroleum industry, being similar to hydrotreatment of petroleum-based diesel practised in refineries over the country, however, the selling prices of HEFA fuels are still not competitive enough with the fossil jet fuel. Sugarcane was identified as the main feedstock to produce four biofuels suitable for aeronautical applications in a self-sustainable integrated process model. Additionally, the sugarcane culture has the advantage of purifying the environment by absorbing C O 2 . The feedstock diversification for the production of the biojet fuel makes it possible to reach greater substitution targets, as is confirmed by Klein et al. [63]. However, despite Brazil presenting an excellent path in the use of biofuels on an industrial scale and its availability of lands for the culture of Jatropha, soybean and sugarcane, the introduction of these in the air transport sector must be gradually wanting to attend the demand. Based on this investigation it was shown that biodiesel and n-hexanol can be blended with jet fuel (Jet-A or Jet-A1) up to 10% without modifications in the engine or damaging its power and with benefit to the environment. In Brazil, the Farnesane can be blended with Jet-A1 into a maximum limit of up to 10% according to resolution ANP n0 63/2014 [67]. The same resolution specifies that the biojet fuels obtained from the HEFA process (whose feedstock could be Jatropha) and FT process are allowed to blend with Jet-A1 up to 50% and ATJ up to 10% as maximum limits. These concentrations were already approved by ASTM International Standard D7566, however, in the ATJ case, 30% is the maximum limit approved. Ethanol (hydrated and anhydrous), biodiesel and butanol are the main liquid biofuels in the Brazilian energy matrix which are used successfully in road transport on a large and small scale, respectively. However, its application to air transport result is limited due to their chemical-physical properties especially volatility and lower heating value. The use of n - butanol as an additive for jet fuel has a slight advantage in comparison with ethanol. One of most important is that n - butanol has a greater LHV than ethanol (see Table 1) allowing a less transported quantity of fuel reducing the impacts on the payload in short-range flight, considering that, currently ∼3% of aircraft operating in the country are used in commercial flight as it was shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, since ethanol has a consolidated market in road transport, the use of n - butanol in air transport would avoid the competition between both markets by an only energy source. A possible disadvantage of n - butanol is that its production is from 10 to 30 times lower than ethanol. However, this problem can be overcome by improving the butanol fermentation technology in sugarcane biorefineries, turning it into a product more attractive than conventional ethanol. A more detailed study about this process can be found in Ref. [48]. Biodiesel (obtained by the FAME process) would not be an attractive alternative for air transport, since it has a limited application due to cold flow and biodegradability. Although, this problem can be overcome by optimizing the biodiesel through esters addition, however, its production cost would be affected. Besides, a greater number of hectares (see Fig. 9a) would be necessary to achieve a low blend percentage (5%vol) into jet fuel than the other feedstocks proposed in this study (see Fig. 9b). The biojet fuels obtained from different conversion routes: ATJ, HEFA and F-T do not prejudice the payload (see Fig. 13) or occupy a greater volume in the fuel tank (see Fig. 14) compared to fossil jet fuel. However, a possible biojet fuels blend, in proportions suggested in this study (see section 5) bring the same benefit, it makes the production chain more competitive and decreases the dependence on fossil jet fuel. From a techno-economic point of view would result beneficial to implement an integrated process, since a less quantity of lands would be sacrificed for the culture of biomass (less dLUC) and subsequent production of different types of biojet fuels and cogeneration. Nevertheless, from an environmental point of view, this practice could cause greater impact, since a less quantity of lands (therefore of biomass) would be used, which could result in a non-equilibrium between C O 2 absorbed (by the biomass) and C O 2 generated (in biorefineries), unless the conversion efficiencies of the different technological routes are maximized, and it increases the participation of biofuels generated as co-products (green diesel and green nafta) in the process. On the other hand, all conversion routes (except FAME) are still in development way internationally, so that is difficult to conclude the real benefit or prejudice of the different technologies for biojet fuel production. In any case, a comparison between C O 2 emissions generated by the multi-conversion in biojet fuel and the two initial stages of the life cycle GHG emissions (acquisition and transportation of biomass) in greater detail should be studied. The final use (in aircraft gas turbine) of any biofuel, lead to slightly less environmental impact compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its greater contribution to life cycle GHG emissions is found in the acquisition and transportation of biomass, whose effects could be higher than those produced by the acquisition and transportation of fossil jet fuel. Again, greater studies are necessary to quantify the contribution of the two initial stages of the life cycle GHG. Finally, it is a mistake to think that the environmental benefit of biofuel is due to the low C O 2 emissions generated in its combustion, since its molecular structure and lower heating value are similar to conventional jet fuel consequently the C O 2 formation is inevitable. Therefore, the environmental benefit of biofuel should be evaluated from net C O 2 emissions in its production chain."
