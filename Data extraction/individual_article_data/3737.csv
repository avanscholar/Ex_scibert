0,Introduction,"With the depletion of fossil fuels and the deterioration of the environment, increasing attention is being paid to the development of clean and renewable energy. Biomass-based hydrogen is an attractive energy source, widely used in fuel cells and internal combustion engines. There are two thermochemistry methods for the production of hydrogen from biomass. One is by biomass gasification, and the other is via catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis oil (also called bio-oil). The combination of the high yield of bio-oil and its easy transportability makes the process of hydrogen production by steam reforming of bio-oil more economical [1–4]. Therefore, considerable research effort has been devoted to the steam reforming of bio-oil to hydrogen since the 1990s. However, bio-oil is a mixture of hundreds of components, including low and high molecular weight oxygenated compounds, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and phenols [5,6]. Thus, model compounds are often used to establish catalyst structure–activity correlations. Carboxylic acids and phenols are two major chemical families in bio-oil, whose concentrations are in the range of 17–32% and 28–52%, respectively [7–11]. Acetic acid (HOAc) is the main carboxylic acid, while phenols contain phenol (PhOH) and its derivatives like guaiacol, 2,4-dimethyl-phenol and vanillin. Therefore, HOAc and PhOH were selected as the model compounds to represent carboxylic acids and phenols, respectively. Ni–Al2O3-based catalysts have been widely used in the reforming of bio-oil because of the high activity of Ni towards the C–C bond cleavage of oxygenated compounds and the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support [3,4,12–14]. Furthermore, adding alkali (K, Na) and alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca) can significantly promote the stability of the catalyst by increasing the water adsorption on the surface [15–17]. For example, a commercial catalyst (G1-50, BASF) for naphtha steam reforming consisted of 20% NiO, 32% Al2O3, 11% MgO, 16% CaO, 14% SiO2, and 7% K2O [18]. Iwasa et al. [19] studied the influence of the addition of various alkali metals on the Ni incorporated mesoporous smectite-like material on the performance for HOAc reforming. It was found that 1% K promoted the reduction of Ni species incorporated in the smectite, yielding more metallic Ni species and enhancing the conversion of HOAc dramatically. Solid waste coal ash, generated from coal-fired power stations, is a complex mixture consisting of many oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, K2O, and Na2O. Generally, SiO2 is the most abundant component in the ash, followed by Al2O3 and Fe2O3. After combustion at high temperature, up to 1500 °C, coal ash has highly stable physical and chemical properties. The traditional treatment of coal ash is to use it for construction materials or just for landfill. It is regrettable that the ash, with its metallic compounds and stable properties, is not used further. Fortunately, more and more studies have been carried out to explore its utilization as a catalyst or catalyst support for reactions such as methane reforming, waste gas cleaning and petroleum hydrocracking [20]. However, no work has been reported regarding its use for bio-oil catalytic steam reforming. It is of considerable interest to discover if a catalyst, made from coal ash as the support and with Ni as the active component, can provide high performance in the steam reforming reaction of bio-oil for hydrogen production. Furthermore, with the utilization of low cost coal ash, the economics of bio-oil catalytic reforming can be improved dramatically. In the present work, we choose HOAc and PhOH as typical bio-oil model compounds. Our objective is to combine the utilization of waste coal ash and the clean production of hydrogen by renewable bio-oil steam reforming."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Coal ash was produced from a representative Chinese brown coal (produced in Yunnan Province, China) according to the standard coal ash manufacturing process. Coal powder was calcined at 815 °C for 2 h in air at a heating rate of 15 °C/min and then cooled to room temperature. This coal ash was chosen as the catalyst support. The catalyst with 15 wt% Ni loading was prepared by wet impregnation. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (7.4 g) was added to 50 ml ethanol and stirred at ambient temperature until fully dissolved (0.5 mol/L). Then 10 g coal ash was added to the solution. The suspension was stirred for 2 h, followed by heating to 80 °C with stirring until the ethanol had completely evaporated. After evaporation, the sample was dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined for 3 h at 815 °C. The calcined sample was crushed and sieved to 40–60 mesh. The prepared coal ash, and the Ni loaded catalyst are denoted as Ash and Ni/Ash, respectively."
3,Catalytic activity test,"2.2 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activity test was carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. In each experiment, 1 g catalyst was sandwiched with quartz wool and packed in a quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. A thermocouple was placed at the center of the catalyst layer to monitor the reaction temperature. The liquid feedstock was fed into the reactor by using a syringe pump at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4 h−1. The steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C) was initially maintained at 9.2, and then declined to 7.5, 5, 2.5 and 1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced using hydrogen (50 ml/min) at 800 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The experimental data were obtained after 2 h on-stream. The overall reactions of HOAc and PhOH reforming are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) and the stoichiometric yield (% stoi.) of H2, and the conversion are defined by Eqs. (3) and (4): (1) CH3COOH + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 4H2 (2) C6H5OH + 11H2O → 6CO2 + 14H2 (3) H 2 yield ( stoi ) = moles of H 2 obtained moles of H 2 in stoichiometric potential × 100 % (4) Conversion = moles of carbon in the product gas moles of carbon in the feed × 100 %"
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (S BET) and other textural properties were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K using a Tristar 3000 apparatus. Before the measurement, the samples were degassed at 573 K for 3 h. The specific surface area was calculated based on the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-K α radiation source operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The crystallite size was calculated according to the Scherrer equation. The chemical composition of the ash was analyzed by an energy dispersive X-ray emission spectrometer (EDX, GENESIS-4000 X). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Philips Tecnai G2F30 instrument. The surface morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Model SIRION-100). H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was carried out on an AutoChem II 2920 instrument. The samples were purged by argon at 473 K for 1 h and then cooled to ambient temperature. Then, the reduction was carried out with a mixture of 10% H2/Ar at a heating rate of 10 K/min up to 1073 K. During the reduction, the consumed amount of H2 was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of Ash is shown in Table 1 .SiO2 is the most abundant component, followed by Al2O3. CaO and Fe2O3 are the next two major components. The CaO content was up to 18%, corresponding to ash classification class C (ASTM C618). The physical properties of Ash and Ni/Ash are summarized in Table 2 and the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 1 . The specific surface areas of the Ash and the Ni/Ash are as low as 15.4 m2/g and 9.0 m2/g, respectively. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Ash and Ni/Ash both elevated after p/p 0 = 0.8, which displays the textural properties of agglomerated particles. Combining with the low specific surface area, the N2 isotherms are considered as Type II. In addition, the N2 desorption volume was less than 80 cm3 g−1 and the dV/dD value in the pore distribution is less than 0.01 for both Ash and Ni/Ash, which also proves that only a few mesopores existed. The XRD patterns of the Ash, Ni/Ash, reduced Ni/Ash and Ni/Ash after reaction samples are shown in Fig. 2 . Well resolved mineral phases of quartz, anhydrite, gehlenite and hematite were apparent in the Ash and Ni/Ash samples, with typical quartz crystallite sizes of 58.1 and 53.6 nm (calculated at (011) plane), respectively. The NiO phase was also easily identified in the Ni/Ash sample. The calculated crystallite size for NiO at (200) plane was 25.1 nm. Three diffraction peaks at 2 theta values of 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° are observed and are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Ni in the reduced Ni/Ash sample. The crystallite size of metallic Ni at (111) plane was 15.3 nm. For Ni/Ash after reaction, the size of Ni crystallite was enlarged to 33.1 nm. In addition, it is interesting to discover that the diffraction peak of anhydrite at 25.4° disappeared, indicating that anhydrite was partially reduced to CaS in the H2 atmosphere (CaSO4 + 4H2 → CaS + 4H2O). The reduction of anhydrite was also reported by Talukdar et al. [21], who also found that CaS was stable in the reducing atmosphere. After reaction, Ni active site remains non-oxidized. Besides, some new silicate formed by reaction of CaS liberated and quartz as well as alumino-silicates during high-temperature oxidization [22]. The morphologies of the Ash and Ni/Ash samples by TEM and SEM measurement are shown in Fig. 3 . The SEM picture showed the structures of Ash and Ni/Ash were slice fragment stacking, and the effect of Ni loading and reaction on the morphology was not obvious. The TEM picture showed a few mesopores also existed in both Ash and Ni/Ash. The pore sizes ranged from about 2 nm to 7 nm for Ash, with an average size of ∼5 nm. The pore sizes for the Ni/Ash sample were larger than for Ash, in the range of 4–25 nm (average size ∼7 nm). TEM results for Ni/Ash after reaction showed that Ni crystal was enlarged compared with that in reduced Ni/Ash, in good agreement with the XRD result. Fig. 4 illustrates the H2-TPR profiles of Ash and Ni/Ash. Two reduction peaks at 650 °C and 460 °C were observed for the Ash, indicating that the Fe2O3 species undergoes a double reduction reaction: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → Fe [23,24]. The H2 consumption for the first peak at 460 °C was about 8.9 μmol, and that for the second peak at 650 °C was about 159.5 μmol, about 16 times the former. There is probably quite a lot of magnetite in the Ash, a common phase in coal ash [25], so the peak at 460 °C was weakened. For the TPR analysis of Ni/Ash, the peak at 650 °C and the shoulder step correspond to the Fe2O3 reduction. Besides, a slight peak at 520 °C was observed. This peak is also related to the reduction of Fe2O3 according to the research by Courson et al., who found that the presence of nickel, reducible at a low temperature, would induce a synergy phenomenon in the reduction of Fe2O3 [26]. The peak at 430 °C is assigned to the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni [27]."
7,Performance comparison of Ni/Ash with other catalysts,"3.2 Performance comparison of Ni/Ash with other catalysts A comparison of Ash and Ni/Ash performance in the reforming reaction, with other well-reported catalysts, is listed in Table 3 . It appears that the pure ash sample has some catalytic activity for HOAc conversion. The activity was close to the well-reported Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, indicating that the Fe and Al2O3 components in the Ash had been activated and catalyzed the HOAc reforming. The activity of Ash for PhOH reforming was lower than that for the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. All the activities of HOAc and PhOH reforming were significantly increased after the addition of Ni. The activities were close to the commercial Ni-based catalysts, indicating good performance for the Ni/Ash catalyst and providing good evidence in favor of using coal ash as the catalyst support for this reaction. The Al2O3 phase in Ash mixtures played an important role during the reforming reaction. It could act as a superior support to enhance the dispersion of active metal Ni compared with SiO2, which would increase the amount of active sites [32]. During the reforming of HOAc, Al2O3 was also found to promote the adsorption of HOAc at an initially low temperature [6]. In addition, due to the enhancement of acidity by the Al2O3 support, the decomposition of the reactants was favored [6]."
8,Influence of reaction temperature,"3.3 Influence of reaction temperature The influence of reaction temperature on HOAc and PhOH reforming over Ni/Ash catalyst is shown in Fig. 5 . In general, the reforming activity of HOAc was higher than that of PhOH, with higher conversion and H2 yield. This was due to their different chemical structures. PhOH has a more stable structure with an aromatic ring, which makes its steam reforming harder. In the reforming study of these two reactants, the active energy of HOAc steam reforming was calculated to be 25.4–37.6 kJ/mol [33], while that of PhOH was around 100 kJ/mol [34], quite larger than that of HOAc. In addition, according to a decomposition potential energy surface calculation, the decomposition reforming activity of HOAc was greater than that of PhOH [35]. The HOAc conversion and hydrogen yield increased as the temperature increased (Fig. 5A). The conversion was 92.8% at 500 °C and remained at this high level in all the entire test temperature range, showing the high activity of Ni/Ash for HOAc reforming. Fig. 5C shows the outlet gas composition of HOAc reforming. It reveals that the content of CO decreased as the temperature increased, while the proportion of H2 and CO2 increased. As previously reported, CO was the main product of HOAc thermal decomposition and its proportion increased with temperature when no water was added [30,36]. This decrease in CO can be ascribed to the enhancement of the water gas shift reaction (WGS, CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) [37], which takes place with the help of alkali and alkaline earth metals (K, Na, Mg and Ca). Additionally, the increased intensity of WGS reaction, which consumed CO, would further promote the decomposition of HOAc. The increase of CH4 can be ascribed to the methanation reaction (CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O and CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O), which takes place at a high temperature, and this reaction was favored also due to the increase of H2 production [38]. The conversion of PhOH was only 63.1% at 500 °C, but increased significantly to 92.8% at 800 °C (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the H2 yield also rose at higher temperature. At 700 °C, the PhOH conversion and hydrogen yield reached 83.5% and 79.1%, respectively. These results are better than those reported by Polychronopoulou et al. over their most active non-noble metal catalyst, 5 wt% Fe/Mg–CeO2, at 700 °C and S/C = 13.3, in which the conversion to phenol and hydrogen yield were 63.3% and 54.3%, respectively [39]. In addition, according to their studies, the phenol conversion increased significantly over the noble metal Rh-based catalyst using the same reaction conditions [39]. The conversion reached 87.4% over a 1.5 wt% Rh/Zr–SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C, which is close to our results over the Ni/Ash catalyst. The outlet gas composition of PhOH reforming is shown in Fig. 5D. Since there was no CH3 group in the PhOH, almost no CH4 formed in the reaction [31]. The CO may be produced from the direct decomposition of PhOH (which contains a C–O bond), or as a result of CH or C steam reforming with H2O (CH or C formed from the decomposition of the PhOH ring). With the increase of temperature, the proportion of CO decreased largely from 16.4% at 500 °C to 5.6% at 600 °C, and further increasing the temperature it almost maintained unchanged. This showed the WGS reaction was not favored under temperature higher than 600 °C during PhOH reforming, due to the complex intermediate CxHy which was difficult to be converted by WGS reaction."
9,Influence of steam to carbon ratio,"3.4 Influence of steam to carbon ratio The influence of steam to carbon ratio on the reforming of HOAc over Ni/Ash catalyst is shown in Fig. 6 . As the S/C gradually decreased from 9.2 to 2.5, the HOAc conversion declined from 98.4% to 69.9%, and the H2 yield from 83.5% to 55.2%. Then, with a further decrease of S/C to 1, namely that the stoichiometric amount of steam was supplied, the HOAc conversion went down largely to 55.3% and H2 yield to 44.2%. In addition, the concentration of CO in the outlet gas gradually rose from 4.7% to 14.3%. The decrease of steam addition would lower the intensity of WGS reaction and suppress the conversion of CO into H2. Furthermore, as the conversion of CO was inhibited, the decomposition of HOAc to produce CO was also inhibited, leading to the low conversion of HOAc. Therefore, it could be concluded that a relatively high S/C was necessary for efficient reactant conversion and H2 production, which was also confirmed by other researches [19]."
10,Stability of the catalyst,"3.5 Stability of the catalyst Stability test of the Ni/Ash catalyst was studied at 700 °C for 11 h in order to investigate its resistance to deactivation for HOAc and PhOH reforming. The variations of the composition of gas products, conversion and H2 yield with time on-stream are shown in Fig. 7 . During the runtime, the conversions of HOAc and PhOH remained at around 98% and 83.5%, respectively, and the corresponding H2 yields were kept at 86% and 79%, showing the good stability of the Ni/Ash catalyst. In addition, compared with our recent study of bio-oil fraction reforming, which achieved a carbon conversion of 95% and a stable time of more than 11 h, the results in this work over Ni/Ash catalyst was comparable [35]. In another research by Kan et al., the conversion and H2 yield from crude bio-oil reforming at 700 °C were 74.3% and 64.6%, respectively [40]. In a review of bio-oil reforming by Trane et al. [41], the H2 yield was 60–90%, mostly lower than the H2 yield of HOAc and PhOH in this work because the real bio-oil was much more complicated."
11,Conclusion,"Ni/Ash catalyst was prepared by a wet impregnation process, using coal ash as the support. Acetic acid and phenol were selected as bio-oil model compounds to test the Ni/Ash performance in catalytic reforming. The conversion of acetic acid and phenol reached high values of 98.4% and 83.5%, respectively, at 700 °C, S/C = 9.2 and the corresponding hydrogen yields were 85.6% and 79.1%. The stability time was longer than 10 h. The performance of waste coal ash supported Ni catalyst is comparable with commercial Ni-based steam reforming catalysts."
