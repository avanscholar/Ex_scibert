0,Introduction,"Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are essential to maintain the product quality in cold storage systems as well as thermal comfort in living spaces. The cooling capacity of the HVAC system would vary depending upon load, usage and application. The energy spent on a high capacity HVAC unit is quite high, especially in cold storage sectors [1]. A report by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MFPI) reveals that, in India, a total of 7645 cold storage units are in operation with installed capacity of 34.95 million metric tonnes for preserving foods and vegetables for increased shelf life [2]. The state-wise distribution of cold storage plants and their capacity details are reported in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the State of Uttar Pradesh has the highest installed cooling capacity. Plenty of chilled energy is wasted by way of dumping the condensate generated by the cold storage unit. As per thumb rule, the quantity of condensate generated varies between 0.37 to 1.13 liters per hours for a cooling capacity of 3.52 kW [3]. The energy available in the condensate from the cold storage is egressed to outdoors and is not recovered. Literature survey indicates that the AC condensate can be used for gardening, roof dust cleaning, pre-cooling the outdoor air, makeup water for cooling towers, condenser cooling and even for potable drinking purposes after necessary treatment [4]. Sisco et al. [5] conducted a study on the effective use of building air conditioning condensate for roof dust cleaning. Studies were conducted in 1.5 TR split air conditioning system, where the air is precooled from AC condensate and used for condenser heat rejection. The results showed that effective pre-cooling was achieved and thereby, the average reduction in compressor pressure was 6.1% and COP was enhanced by 21.4% [6]. Magrini et al. [7] experimentally studied water production through a centralized air conditioning unit. They integrated HVAC system with a separate pipeline for water production, which led to a reduction in the amount of water consumption in the hotels. Recent work reported that the recovery of condensate from six air handling unit could be used for pre-cooling the outdoor air as well as act as makeup water to the cooling tower. The results showed that a reduction of 10.9% in power consumption was achieved [8]. In view of acute water scarcity, in recent times, researchers have been investigating possible solutions for using air conditioning condensate water as potable drinking water [9]. The quality of condensate water is similar to distilled water along with the presence of metals and microorganisms [10]. Through chemical treatment heavy metals could be removed, however, due to energy and processing cost, it is not the most economical method for drinking applications. Moreover, it is noted that all existing research work carried out in the air conditioning condensate involves instantaneous energy transfer. The maximum amount of energy would be lost to the environment due to the higher ambient temperature gradient. Therefore, a suitable energy recovery system is required for the effective use of air conditioning condensate. Thermal energy storage systems are deployed as an effective way to recover energy and store in the form of sensible, latent and chemical reactions [11]. Among these three methods, latent heat storage using Phase Change Material (PCM) is found to be effective in terms of storage density and operability in narrow temperature ranges [12,13]. Zalba et al. [12] conducted a detailed review on the thermal energy storage system using different types of phase change materials and its heat transfer properties for energy storage applications. Cabeza et al. [13] reviewed the technical problems associated with PCM materials such as supercooling, phase segregation, the stability of PCM container, heat transfer enhancement and cost. PCMs are finding use in buildings in cooling and heating applications, for shifting the peak load and decoupling energy supply and demand [14]. Numerous researches have been done with PCMs for cooling and heating applications. However, the availability of PCM for low-temperature applications is limited in terms of cost as well as safety [15]. A few studies have investigated in detail the changes in thermophysical properties and thermal stability of PCMs over the number of working cycles [16,17]. The present work focusses on identification and study of properties of low cost, non-hazardous PCMs for cold storage applications. The available cold storage condensate temperature is approximately 8 °C to 15 °C. Suitable PCMs are identified such that energy can be recovered from condensate. Thus, the targeted PCMs are chosen within a phase transition temperature range of 18 °C to 25 °C. The list of available PCMs along with their melting point and latent heat storage capacity is given in Table 1 . Coconut Oil (CO) and Lauryl Alcohol (LA) were chosen from the available PCMs based on cost and safety considerations. These two PCMs are inexpensive and almost have identical phase transition temperatures ranging from 23 to 25 °C which is close to human comfort temperature [18,19]. Another reason for selecting these two PCMs is that LA is generally derived from CO through the hydrogenation process. Comparative study of thermophysical properties of LA and CO before and after subjecting to thermal cycles are not available in reported literature. Seunghwan Wi et al. [20] examined the properties of coconut oil and palm oil impregnating with exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnp) including TGA, DSC and thermal conductivity analysis of composite PCMs. Mettawee et al. [21] investigated the thermophysical properties of coconut oil and suggested that it is a potential PCM for peak load shifting in an air conditioning system. Diana Moigradean et al. [22] studied the thermal stability of coconut oil through thermochemical analysis in which the FTIR spectrum revealed that coconut oil has good oxidation stability for 12 months on storage in a dark bottle at 25 °C. Another recent study discussed the heat releasing and absorption behavior of coconut oil and reported that it acts as a temperature control agent for room air conditioning systems [23]. A few research work on the thermophysical properties of lauryl alcohol reported in the literature are discussed. In earlier work, Jianguo Zuo et al. [24] while studying the properties of a composite PCM (caprylic acid/ lauryl alcohol eutectic mixture) reported latent heat of fusion of 207.3 J/g and melting point of 25.22 °C for pure LA. Shazim Ali Memon et al. [25] developed lauryl alcohol / kaolin composite PCM by incorporation of lauryl alcohol into kaolin. The study concluded that thermal properties of composite PCM could help in significantly reducing the indoor air temperature in building. Recently, Veerakumar Chinnasamy and Sreekumar Appukuttan [19] investigated the thermal energy storage system integrated with air-conditioning, wherein lauryl alcohol was used as a PCM for maintaining thermal comfort with energy saving. The work also reported thermophysical properties such as melting point (onset and peak), latent heat of fusion, specific heat capacity, density and thermal conductivity of pure LA. Thus while properties such as melting point, latent heat of fusion, density, specific heat and thermal conductivity of the selected PCMs are reported in literature, variation in thermophysical properties of CO and LA when subjected to thermal cycles have not been reported so far. Also, effect of supercooling for CO and LA has not been reported. Studies reported so far on charging and discharging were carried out in air medium and not in water medium for shifting of peak load in a building. The gap is addressed in this study wherein, properties such as the effect of supercooling, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of CO and LA when subjected to thermal cycling are investigated. The charging and discharging cycle of these PCMs are studied with the objective of evaluating their applicability for development of suitable thermal energy storage system."
1,Materials and methods,"CO and LA of 99% purity are used as PCM in this study. CO comes from a fatty acid ester PCM group derived from coconut fats. LA is organic fatty alcohol obtained from coconut oil after pre-treatment and hydrogenation. This study is based on high capacity cold storage plants where the generation of condensate is significant. In order to assess the condensate quantity, the cold storage unit with a capacity of (17,580 kW) (Unit A and Unit B) was considered in the present study. Unit A is designed for preserving apple at 3 °C and 95% RH. Dates and Neem seeds are stored at 9 °C and 95% RH in Unit B. During the assessment, the quantity of condensate generated from both Unit A and Unit B was around 160 liters per day at a temperature range of 9 °C to 11 °C. Fig. 2 a shows the pictorial view of field measurements taken at the site. The amount of condensate collection in the month of June 2019 is presented in Fig. 2b. The average quantity of condensate generation from this plant was around 155 liters per day. Hence, there is scope for energy recovery with the help of a suitable thermal energy storage system and reuse of condensate for process improvement. Characterization studies of both PCMs were conducted to identify the thermo-physical properties such as density, thermal conductivity, specific heat, melting point and latent heat of fusion. In addition, the PCMs were subjected to thermal cycling tests (up to 250 cycles) to evaluate long term stability in the cold storage plant. Followed by this, the experiments were carried out to identify the phase transition phenomena by way of charging and discharging of PCMs. Further, the potential application of the PCMs is discussed as this would help in the design of a thermal energy storage unit through effective utilization AC condensate."
2,Characterization studies,"2.1 Characterization studies Phase transition temperature and the latent heat of LA and CO were investigated using DSC with heat flux measurement techniques (Perkin Elmer, DSC 6000). Thermogravimetric analysis (Perkin Elmer, TGA 4000) was used to find the thermal stability and decomposition rate. TGA of CO and LA was done for temperature range of 30 °C to 500 °C (10 °C/min) under nitrogen atmosphere (20 ml/min). The thermal conductivity of condensate water and the selected PCMs were measured using a KD2 Pro-thermal properties analyzer (Decagon Devices Inc). KS-1 sensor with a measurement range of 0.02 to 2.0 W/mK was used for measurement of thermal conductivity. Under the same experimental conditions, three test runs were performed to ensure the repeatability of the measurement."
3,Thermal cycle test analysis,"2.2 Thermal cycle test analysis PCMs need to be stable and possess reliable thermal properties over a working cycle (heating and cooling). However, in practice, their phase change properties may change due to a respective heating and cooling cycles. In order to evaluate the changes in physical and chemical properties, the PCMs were kept in a thermal cyclic chamber and subjected to 250 thermal cycles. One thermal cycle consists of one solidification and one melting. A thermal cyclic chamber along with PLC unit was used for carrying out the experiments. A temperature range of −5 °C to 33 °C was set with a holding time of 5 min for solidification and melting study. At the end of 250 cycles, the PCMs were taken for FTIR (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum 2) and DSC analysis and for studying the chemical and thermal properties."
4,Experimental setup,"The charging and discharging characteristics of the PCMs need to be experimentally investigated. However, doing the same in a live cold storage plant involves practical difficulties. Therefore, to simulate the real-time heat transfer studies of PCMs in a cold storage plant, PCMs were tested in a constant temperature water bath. A chiller with a capacity of 1.86 kW was used for the experimental purpose of simulating the conditions prevailing in the cold storage plant. The chilled water is maintained at a temperature of 11±1 °C and used as a heat transfer medium instead of condensate water. Fig. 3 shows the experimental setup, consisting of constant temperature water bath with data acquisition system. A PID controller was used to maintain the water temperature of 11 °C with the stability of ±1 °C. T type thermocouple was employed for temperature measurements. Thermocouples are connected with a data acquisition system for continuous recording of water, ambient and PCM temperature during the test run. The thermocouples were calibrated in NABL accredited laboratory and the expanded uncertainty was 0.3 °C. PCMs (1 kg) was filled in a copper cylinder with a 3 mm wall thickness with a holding capacity of 0.0015 m3. The experiments were carried out for both the PCMs (CO and LA) for investigating their phase change characteristics. PCMs charging study was conducted in a water medium and then discharged at an ambient temperature of 30±1 °C into the air medium."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermal analysis and cycling study of selected PCMs,"4.1 Thermal analysis and cycling study of selected PCMs PCM samples (LA and CO) of 5 mg (approx.) were heated from −10 °C to 50 °C at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Phase transition behavior of CO and LA was analyzed for both pure samples as well as for samples after 250 cycles which are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The latent heat of pure CO was found to be 81.41 J/g which is in close agreement with the earlier studies which had reported latent heat in the range of 82 to 105 J/g [44,45] The variation in latent heat is due to variation in ingredients of derived coconut fats depending on the source region. Similarly, the latent heat of pure LA was 220.75 J/g which is in close agreement with reported values of 214.02 J/g [19]. However, studies on thermal cycling of these two PCMs are not reported in literature so far. The melting point of pure PCMs (without thermal cycles) was observed to be 24.11 °C and 22.34 °C for CO and LA respectively. After the completion of 250 thermal cycles, the melting point of CO and LA shifted to 23.73 °C and 21.88 °C respectively. The latent heat of fusion of CO and LA was found to decrease by 10.55% and 52.9% respectively after 250 cycles. The onset and endpoint temperature shifts of CO and LA at the end of 250 cycles are given in Table 2 . Less than 10% variations were observed between pure and at the end of 250 cycles. TGA and DTA analyses of CO and LA illustrated in Fig. 6 confirm that the thermal degradation occurred in a single continuous step for both CO and LA. The weight loss was mainly due to the thermal degradation of the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids present in CO. The initial degradation of CO starts at 216.6 °C (onset) and completely degraded at around 430 °C. Seunghwan Wi et al. [20] reported a similar degradation trend for coconut oil where complete degradation occurred around 410 °C. Likewise, LA degradation starts at 120.07 °C and completely degraded at around 250 °C. This result matched closely with results reported by Shazim Ali Memon [25], wherein degradation started at 130 °C and ended at 270 °C. The derivative curve indicates the percentage of weight loss with respect to the time where the maximum weight reduction takes place at 420.92 °C (peak) for CO and 234.81 °C (peak) for LA. Less than 1% of mass reduction is observed for both CO (0.75%) and LA (0.64%) up to 100 °C. Application of the selected PCMs in cold storage plants where the operating temperature does not exceed 100 °C is indeed an apt choice and the results indicate that the selected PCMs could be used for cooling applications without undergoing degradation. Figs. 7 and 8 show the FT-IR absorption spectra of the CO and LA in pure form and after completion of 250 thermal cycles. The molecular formulae of CO and LA are C18H30O2C12H26O respectively, which means they contain - CH3-, - CH2-, CO, and CO bonding. The FT-IR absorption spectra of CO characterize that the first absorption peak was observed at 2922.28 cm−1. It is due to the presence of alkyl functional groups which include - CH3- Asymmetric stretch bonding. Followed by this, the second absorption peaks confirmed the - CH2- Asymmetric stretch bonding at 2853.32 cm−1. Subsequently, the two subsequent sharp absorption peaks formed due to the presence of fatty acid ethyl esters include CO and CO at the wavenumbers of 1743.06 cm−1 and 1154.69 cm−1 respectively. The small peak denotes the presence of alkane groups CC at 1464.94 cm−1. The obtained results have a close agreement with Seunghwan et al. [46]. Similarly, the FTIR spectrum of LA represents two sharp peaks at the wavenumbers of 2921.61 cm−1 and 2852.80 cm−1 which confirms alkyl groups (i.e.-CH3-, - CH2- bonding). A similar CH stretching peaks of LA were observed and reported by Shazim Ali Memon [25]. As mentioned earlier, both the PCMs were subjected to continuous cooling and heating process in order to assess the thermal cyclic stability. At the end of 250 cycles, the same alkyl and triglycerides absorption peaks were observed in the FTIR spectrum results and no chemical reaction was observed during the thermal cycling. It was found that both the PCMs were chemically stable even after 250 cycles."
7,Specific heat and thermal conductivity analysis,"4.2 Specific heat and thermal conductivity analysis The specific heat capacity of PCMs was measured by DSC (Netzsch, DSC 214 Polyma) for the working temperature range of 10 to 40 °C with a heating rate of 5 K/min. The temperature and heat flow profile of the sample was compared with standard Sapphire to estimate the specific heat. From DSC results, it can be observed that both CO and LA have almost similar phase transition characteristics - the solid and liquid separation takes place at around 25 °C as shown in Fig. 9 . The solid and liquid specific heat of ccoconut oil was reported in earlier studies [44,45]. However, the variation of specific heat at different working temperatures was not discussed. Specific heat of CO at solid phase (Cps) ranges from 1.33 to 3.33 J/g K with a corresponding temperature range of 10 to 22 °C. In the liquid phase (Cpl), the specific heat dropped sharply from 3.33 J/g K to 0.89 J/g K as the temperature was increased from 22 to 40 °C. In the region of the phase transition at around 24±1 °C, variation in the specific heat is very large and is in a state of continuous non- equilibrium. These data points in DSC analysis are often omitted since there is a large variation and distort the scale. Similar results of specific heat are observed by refined coconut oil reported by Samer Kahwaji and Mary Anne White [47]. After the completion of 250 cycles, the solid-state (Cps) specific heat capacity of CO was found to be 1.08 and 2.93 J/g K at 10 °C and 22 °C respectively. Similarly, in a liquid state the Cpl varies between 3.02 J/g K and 0.71 J/g K for the temperature range of 22 °C and 40 °C respectively. At the end of 250 cycles, the specific heat was decreased from 2.71 J/g K to 2.49 J/g K at 30 °C. The variations in the specific heat capacity after completion of 250 thermal cycles are given in Fig. 10 . The above results concluded that the specific heat decreased from 1.2% to 18.8% with a maximum drop of 18.8% at 10 °C. Similarly, the specific heat of LA was observed to be 2.59 J/g K at 10 °C in solid-state (Cps) and it continuously increased with an increase in temperature. The specific heat is approached infinity in the phase transition temperature of 23±2 °C. On further heating, the solid phase changed to liquid phase (Cpl) while the specific heat dropped sharply to 3.57 J/g K at 40 °C. After the completion of 250 cycles, Cps and Cpl were decreased from 2.59 J/g K to 2.32 and 3.57 J/g K to 3.38 J/g K. However, the less than 10% drop was observed at room temperature (i.e. 30 °C) before and after thermal cycles (at 250 cycles). Thermal conductivity of condensate water was found to be 0.615 W/mK which acts as heat transfer fluid for charging the PCMs. The thermal conductivity of PCMs was measured at 10 °C and 30 °C for pure samples and also for samples after the completion of 250 thermal cycles. The thermal conductivity of CO was found to be 0.174 W/mK at 10 °C (solid-state, ks) and 0.165 W/mK at 30 °C (liquid state, kl). Similarly, the observed thermal conductivity of LA was 0.181 W/mK (ks at 10 °C) and 0.172 W/mK (kl at 30 °C). It is observed that the thermal conductivity of LA (pure form) is higher than CO in both liquid and solid-state. The change in thermal conductivity for before and after thermal cycles were presented in Table 2. The minor reduction in thermal conductivity was observed after completion of the 250 thermal cycles, which is 3.3% for CO and 4.4% for LA. The thermophysical properties of CO and LA as reported in literature and as per the findings of the present work are compared and reported in Table 3 ."
8,Charging characteristics of PCMs,"4.3 Charging characteristics of PCMs 1 kg each of CO and LA were filled in the copper cylinder with a wall thickness of 3 mm for conducting the phase transition studies. Three thermocouples TB, TC and TT are positioned inside the PCM container at a distance of 0.02 m (bottom), 0.075 m (core) and 0.14 m (top) from the bottom of the container. Water temperature is preset to 11±1 °C which is very similar to condensate water temperature. Initially, the PCMs are filled at room temperature which is at 30 °C. The charging process of PCMs was carried out under natural convection cooling the PCMs from 30 °C to their solidification temperature. The freezing temperature and the charging time for complete solidification were studied for both PCMs. Phase transition behavior and charging characteristics of CO and LA are presented in Figs. 11 and 13. Sensible heat from cold condensate is transferred to the adjacent wall of the copper cylinder and in turn the PCM is cooled towards its phase transition temperature. The temperature at the bottom (TB) drops quickly to its solidification temperature and initiates nucleation. Crystal formation propagates at the adjacent molecules and the phase transition occurred in the order of TB, TT and TC. The rate of solidification was delayed at TC due to the solidified PCM tries to sink towards the bottom as its density increases. A similar trend was reported in the solidification study by Rajendran Prabakaran et al. [48]. Through the experiments, the solidification temperature of CO was found to be 22.3 °C and complete charging takes place in 840 min. Considering LA freezing study, the solidification starts at 23.1 °C which occurs after 40 min from the experimental run. The duration for complete solidification of LA was estimated at around 510 min when the water temperature was maintained at 11±1 °C and the water quantity was 10 L. Studies were conducted to find out the amount of energy recovered by the two PCMs (CO and LA) for a condensate generation of 155 LPD at 11±1 °C. The temperature is assumed to increase by 2 °C while it is stored in a well-insulated tank due to ambient temperature gradient. During the charging study, it was observed that 1 kg of CO and LA required a minimum of 10 liters of chilled water at 12 °C for complete charging. The condensate water temperature increased to around 17 °C after complete solidification of CO and LA. Upon extrapolation, the available condensate of 155 LPD at 12 °C would require 15.5 kg of CO, capable of storing 1262 kJ of energy considering a latent heat of 81.41 kJ/kg for CO. After 250 thermal cycles, CO could store 1129 kJ of energy considering the drop in latent heat of CO to 72.82 kJ/kg from 81.41 kJ/kg. Similarly, 15.5 kg of LA is capable of storing 3421.6 kJ and 1610.8 kJ for pure and after 250 cycles respectively, considering the drop in latent heat from 220.75 kJ/kg to 103.92 kJ/kg after 250 thermal cycles. 4.3.1 Degree of supercooling Supercooling is the driving force for the ice crystal formation and it is directly linked to nucleation phenomenon. The degree of supercooling varied based on the flow of heat flux (i.e. cooling rate), inherent properties of the material, stirring rate, etc. [49]. Supercooling properties of selected PCMs were studied and found that both the PCMs are prone to supercooling during the crystallization process. Through the experiments, it was found that CO was getting subcooled to 19.7 °C and again rises to its freezing temperature of 22.3 °C. This shows that CO has a supercooling temperature of 2.6 °C. Due to this supercooling effect, the actual freezing time is prolonged to a period of 25 min. A similar analysis was carried out for LA to identify the supercooling effect. During the charging, it was found that LA has very little supercooled properties (less than 0.5 °C) from its actual freezing temperature of 23.1 °C. However, this little supercooling does not delay actual freezing time and the freezing characteristics are also not affected. As discussed earlier, the degree of supercooling also depends on the heat transfer rate between the PCM and the charging medium. The above mentioned supercooling effect is subjected to the charging of PCMs in a water medium (10 L) at 11±1 °C. The results revealed that the impact of supercooling is less for LA than CO during the solidification. At the end of 250 cycles, the degree of supercooling was experimentally found to be 2.8 °C and 0.6 °C for CO and LA respectively. It shows that no predominate change in supercooling properties after 250 thermal cycles."
9,Discharging characteristics of PCMs,"4.4 Discharging characteristics of PCMs Discharging of PCMs was carried out in an ambient environment through natural convection. The stored latent heat could be transferred to ambient air which is at 30 °C. Melting characteristics include melting point, melt fraction and time taken for complete melting of CO and LA and are illustrated in Figs. 12 and 14 . Through the experimental study, the melting temperature of CO was observed at 23.2 °C with a complete melting duration of 784 min. The higher discharge rate was observed in CO which is due to its inherent properties as reported by Putri et al. [42]. Similarly, LA melting temperature was found to be 23.8 °C and the complete melting took place in around 840 min. The melting point obtained from the experiment is in good agreement with Veerakumar Chinnasamy [19]. Studies of charging and discharging have confirmed that CO and LA are appropriate PCMs for condensate energy recovery. The future works will concentrate on integrating these two PCMs for pre-cooling applications in an existing cold storage plant."
10,Thermal test cycle energy analysis of PCMs,"4.5 Thermal test cycle energy analysis of PCMs Thermal test cycle energy analysis and environmental impact of CO and LA were carried out by subjecting to thermal cycles and the results were compared with existing studies. The thermal working cycle energy analysis was calculated considering the cost of PCM and recovered energy over the period of working cycles. The latent heat of different PCMs (organic and fatty acid mixtures) reported in earlier studies were taken for the energy analysis. Comparison of cost / energy storage analysis and environmental impact of CO and LA with existing PCMs reported in literature are given in Table 4 . The analysis shows that CO could be a better option compared to LA. The thermal working cycle energy analysis of composite mixture of Capric acid (73.5 wt%) and Myristic acid (26.5 wt%) with Expanded perlite is similar to that of CO in terms of cost over working cycle energy. However, considering the environmental / health aspects and material compatibility, CO is better than the Capric acid and Myristic acid composite mixture. Characterization studies did not indicate any change in chemical structure at the end of 250 thermal cycles for both CO and LA. The latent heat of pure LA is higher than that of pure CO. However, the variation in latent heat when subjected to thermal cycles was larger in the case of LA. Thus, CO is better suited in terms of stability."
11,Potential applications of selected PCMs,"4.6 Potential applications of selected PCMs The energy recovered from the chilled condensate generated from HVAC units including high capacity air-conditioned buildings and cold storage units could be used for the following applications. (i) Condensate/PCM assisted pre-cooling unit for improved Indoor Air Quality (IAQ): Admitting fresh air is essential for improving IAQ in an air-conditioned building. Often the fresh air is insufficient resulting in the CO2 concentration exceeding the permissible limit of 1000 ppm. However, increasing the fresh air ventilation would cause a higher sensible load, leading to increase in energy consumption. In order to reduce energy consumption, the cold energy recovered from the cold condensate using PCM could be used for pre-cooling the fresh air. This system can be installed in the fresh air duct to pre-cool the admitted fresh air, resulting in improving the indoor air quality. The details of improving IAQ using condensate/PCM assisted pre-cooling unit is given in the flowchart (Fig. 15 ). ii) In addition to this, the effective utilization of cold condensate energy through PCMs would help in pre-cooling of food products. Pre-cooling of food products using PCM mounted storage box can help in reducing the energy consumption in an existing cold storage unit."
12,Conclusions,"Coconut Oil (CO) and Lauryl Alcohol (LA) are identified as low-cost and non-hazardous PCMs since their thermophysical properties are well suited for energy recovery from condensate in cold storage plant. Long term storage and real time applications, thermal and chemical stability were analyzed for different thermal cycles. Charging and discharging studies were carried out experimentally in order to identifying the time duration for complete solidification and melting. The following conclusions are drawn based on the experimental results. • Condensate generation in a live cold storage plant was measured as around 160 liters per day for 17,580 kW capacity at average temperatures of 10±1 °C. • Thermal degradation study revealed that the degradation starts at 216.6 °C and 120.07 °C for CO and LA respectively. Less than 1% of mass reduction is observed for both CO (0.75%) and LA (0.64%) up to 100 °C. In cold storage plants where the operating temperature does not exceed 100 °C, thereby the selected PCMs could be used for cooling applications without undergoing degradation. • Phase transition properties of CO and LA were observed through DSC before and after thermal cycles. The melting point of CO shifted from 24.11 °C to 23.73 °C and in turn the latent heat capacity dropped by 10.55% after the completion of 250 cycles. Similarly, for LA it was observed that the melting point shifted from 24.16 °C to 21.88 °C and the latent heat decreased by 52.9% at the end of 250 thermal cycles. Less than 10% variations were observed on temperature shifts (onset and end) for CO and LA at the end of 250 cycles. The shift in melting point and latent heat was due to changes in inherent properties of PCMs while being subjected to continuous heating and cooling cycle. DSC analysis confirmed that thermal properties of CO was found to be good at the end of 250 thermal cycles compared to LA. • FTIR analysis confirmed that the same alkyl and triglycerides absorption peaks were observed in both PCMs at the end of 250 cycles, indicating that there was no chemical reaction during the thermal cycling. It was concluded that the selected PCMs were chemically stable and after the completion of 250 cycles, no significant changes in chemical properties were observed. • Specific heat of CO at solid phase (Cps) was observed between 1.33 J/g K and 3.33 J/g K with a corresponding temperature range of 10 °C and 22 °C. In the liquid phase (Cpl), the specific heat dropped sharply and reaches 0.89 J/g K at 40 °C. After the completion of 250 thermal cycles, the specific heat decreased from 10.1% to 5.3% for the temperature of 10 °C and 40 °C respectively . • The solid and liquid specific heat of LA was found to be 2.59 J/g K (Cps at 10 °C) and 3.57 J/g K (Cpl at 40 °C). After completion of 250 thermal cycles, the specific heat decreased from 1.8% to 19.8%% for the temperature of 10 °C and 40 °C respectively . However, the less than 10% drop was observed for both CO and LA at room temperature (i.e. 30 °C) before and after thermal cycles (at 250 cycles). • Thermal conductivity of CO and LA was measured for pure samples and for samples after 250 thermal cycles. The thermal conductivity of CO in solid (at 10 °C) and liquid (at 30 °C) state was found to be 0.165 W/mK (kl) and 0.174 W/mK (ks) respectively. Similarly, the observed thermal conductivity of LA was 0.172 W/mK (kl) and 0.181 W/mK (ks). It was noted that the thermal conductivity of LA (pure form) is higher than CO in both liquid and solid-state. The minor reduction in thermal conductivity was observed after completion of the 250 thermal cycles, which is 3.3% for CO and 4.4% for LA. • Charging characteristics studied experimentally using controlled thermal environment where the water temperature was maintained at 11±1 °C, showed that the solidification starts at 22.3 °C and 23.1 °C for CO and LA respectively. The duration for complete solidification of CO and LA (1 kg each) was around 840 min and 510 min respectively. • Supercooling properties were observed in both the PCMs. During the charging studies, it was found that CO was subcooled by 2.6 °C from its actual freezing temperature resulting in the actual freezing time being prolonged by 25 min. LA has very little supercooled properties (less than 0.5 °C) from its actual freezing temperature of 23.1 °C. This little supercooling is not delaying actual freezing time. • Discharging of PCMs was carried out in an open ambient condition at 30±1 °C under natural convection. Through the experimental study, the melting temperatures of CO and LA were observed at 23.2 °C and 23.8 °C respectively. Also, a complete melting duration was observed at 784 min for CO and 840 min for LA. • With the available condensate of 155 LPD at 12 °C, CO and LA (pure) could store 1262 kJ and 3421.6 kJ respectively. After 250 thermal cycles, CO and LA could store 1129 kJ and 1610.8 kJ with marginal reduction in latent heat of 10.55% for CO and a large reduction of 52.9% for LA. • Cost of both CO and LA is affordable for application in thermal energy storage system for energy recovery from cold storage plant condensate. However, the thermal test cycle analysis confirmed that CO could be a better option compared to LA and other organic PCMs considering environmental / health aspects and material compatibility."
