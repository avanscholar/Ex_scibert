0,Introduction,"Optical fiber sensing is used for measuring many physical factors, such as temperature, strain, pH value, heavy metal ions, humidity, etc. due to its unique advantages [1–5]. Humidity is one of the most important physical factors. It can be applied to industrial production, gas detection, health monitoring and other fields [6,7]. In recent years, optical fiber sensing have made great progress in both structure and material. A number of fiber optic sensors based on various structures have been reported. For example, B.Y. Yang proposed a high sensitivity refractive index (RI) sensor based on balloon-like singlemode-tapered multimode singlemode (STMS) fiber structure. The maximum sensitivity of 6909 nm/RIU at RI = 1.42 is experimentally achieved [8]. Besides, many of structures are used for humidity sensing. For instance, Y. F. Qi et al. investigated a relative humidity (RH) sensor based on FBG-FP cavity, and the sensitivitiy of humidity was 0.0682 dB/%RH [9]. Moreover, J. Yang et al. proposed a in-fiber directional coupler-based RH sensor, achieving the average RH sensitivity of −7.005 nm/%RH [10]. Generally, functional materials are coated on the fiber so as to attain a higher sensitivity. So far, many fiber optic humidity sensors coated with functional layers have been reported. For instance, K. Ni et al. studied a sensor based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer with waist-enlarged fusion bitapers, and chitosan acts as functional material for humidity sensing, achieving the sensitivity of 119.6 pm/RH within the range from 10% to 90% [11]. In addition, Sarah Kadhim Al-Hayali et al.demonstrated firstly an RH sensor based on an etched NCF coated with G-PVA film, achieving the maximum sensitivity of 0.412 nm/RH% with good stability at the RH range of 40%–100% [12]. Furthermore, Methylcellulose ethylcellulose [13], metal oxides [14,15], polyacrylamide (PAH), polyacrylic acid (PAA) [16,17] and composite materials have been investigated for monitoring RH. In order to better compare the differences between different sensors, Table 1 summarizes the performance of some kinds of fiber-optic RH sensors. However, as far as we know, hyaluronic acid has not been investigated for humidity measurement. Hyaluronic acid is a linear polymer polysaccharide composed of disaccharide (N-acetyl d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid). It has been used in skin care products and various types of eye surgery, such as lens implantation corneal transplantation and anti-glaucoma surgery. In the paper, an optical fiber humidity sensor based on Michelson interferometer coated with HA/ PVA composite film is investigated. The sensors coated with different proportions of HA/PVA films are fabricated, and their responses to humidity variation are characterized. The cross sensitivity to temperature is measured. The results show that the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA film has better performance for humidity sensing."
1,Experiment,
2,Experimental materials,"2.1 Experimental materials PVA (99% powder) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore. HA (molecular weight 1.3–1.4million, white powder) was acquired from Bloomage Freda Biopharm Co.,Ltd. Deionized water was obtained from MilliQ system. APTES (97%) was obtained from Aladdin(Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd). SMF (core/cladding diameter, 8/125 μm) and TCF (core diameter, 4 μm) were purchased from YOFC. TCF used in the experiment is one of the high nonlinear fiber (HNLF). The fusion splicer (Fujikura 62S) can be used to fabricated interferometers by setting specific parameters. The fiber cleaver (Fujikura CT30) can cleave a fiber with a desired length. The HA/PVA is viscous and can be coated on an optical fiber by dip coating. The wavelength demodulator (Micron Optics, SM125) can be used to obtain the reflection spectrum. The hygro-thermometer (VICTOR 231) can be used to monitor humidity inside chamber."
3,Sensor preparation,"2.2 Sensor preparation The sensor was fabricated as follows: SMF and TCF were fused together by fusion splicer, and then the TCF was cleaved at about 691 μm away from the fusion junction. The other end of the TCF was melted into a circular shape at last (see Fig. 1 (a)). To make a circular tip, setting splicing parameter of the fusion splicer was as follows: discharge intensity was standard power and discharge duration was 1500 ms. Fig. 1(b) is the optical spectra of the bare sensor freshly fabricated and the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film and dried after drying in the air for 1 day. The reflection spectra of proposed sensor was measured under 27.6%RH and room temperature of 25 °C."
4,Composite film preparation,"2.3 Composite film preparation PVA solution (5%) was prepared by dissolving PVA particles (5 g) in deionized water (95 ml) at 95 °C. Hyaluronic acid solution (1%) was prepared by adding HA powder (1 g) to deionized water (99 ml) and stirring evenly and then waiting for 12 h. ATPES solution (97%) was diluted to 10% with deionized water. The fiber was washed by deionized water and alcohol firstly. Then the fiber was soaked in a 10% aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) solution for 40 min. And then using deionized water and alcohol washed the fiber again so as to remove non-covalently bonded silane compounds. The fiber was dipped into the HA/PVA blends for 15 min and then withdrawn slowly and softly. Afterwards, the fiber was left to dry for one day before testing (see Fig. 2 ). Refs. [18,19] shows that the thinner PVA film is, the faster response speed is."
5,Experimental setup,"2.4 Experimental setup The setup comprises a wavelength demodulator, a sensor probe and a computer (see Fig. 3 ). The reflected signal is then guided to the demodulator for measurement. A sensor probe and a hygro-thermometer were set in a sealed humid chamber for humidity testing. Two conical bottle is connected to the humid chamber and an air pump is used to blow air into the conical bottle. When the water is in the conical bottle, it will produce moist air to increase relative humidity in chamber. When the silica is in the conical bottle, it will produce dry air to decrease relative humidity in chamber. The humidity ascended from 30%RH to 80%RH and then descended from 80% RH to 30% RH. The rate of dry/moist air generation is controlled by adjusting the power of the air pump, thus the relative humidity in chamber can be adjusted. The data was recorded at intervals of 5% relative humidity. The demodulator was connected to the computer to measure the reflection spectra. The whole experiment was carried out at 25 °C. To prevent sudden changes in humidity, the rates of dry and humid airflow should be slow."
6,Sensor principle,"The interferometer was fabricated by fusing TCF to SMF together and melting the other end of TCF into a circular shape. The outer of the interferometer was coated with HA/PVA humidity composite film. When light is emitted into the structure through incident SMF, a part of the light propagates along a straight path and returns to the incident SMF. As the core size of TCF is smaller than that of SMF, the mode field mismatches. Therefore the other part of the light is coupled to the cladding of TCF and reflected back at the circular end face. And the circular end face of TCF reflects and excites the higher-order cladding pattern, which is incorporated back into the core of SMF. Their propagation constants and effective indices are different, due to the different transverse paths of core and cladding modes. Consequently, an interference spectrum generated by the interference between the core and cladding mode is acquired, which resembles the interference spectrum of Michelson interferometer. The following formula can be used to express the reflection of the interferometer [20]: (1) I = I 1 + I 2 + 2 I 1 I 2 cos ( φ 0 + φ ) where the intensity of interference signal, core and cladding mode is expressed by I, I1 and I2 , respectively; the initial phase is expressed by Φ0 . Two modes of phase is expressed by Φ and defined as: (2) φ = 2 π Δ n eff L λ where λ is the wavelength, neff = ncore − ncladding is the effective refractive index difference between the core and claddings modes, L is the interference length. ncore is a constant when the sensor is coated with HA/PVA. The reason is that the core mode is separated from the surroundings except at the moment of reflecting off the rounded tip. And ncladding would vary with the effective refractive index of HA/PVA due to its influence on the cladding [21]. When the HA/PVA is coated on the outer of the TCF, the item of Δneff would be changed. Afterwards, the peaks in reflection spectrum are shifted. Therefore, relative humidity sensing can be obtained by corresponding wavelength shift or intensity change."
7,Experimental results and discussion,
8,Performance results of the sensor coated with PVA film,"4.1 Performance results of the sensor coated with PVA film Fig. 4 shows the reflection spectra of the sensor coated with PVA under different relative humidity. The spectra shift to smaller wavelength with relative humidity increasing, which indicates the refractive index of PVA film decreases, accordingly. PVA [22], with an OH group bonded to every alternate carbon in the backbone chain, is a water-soluble polymer with a good swelling ratio. It has high surface-area-to-volume ratio and strong absorption property in a wide wavelength range [23–25].More importantly, there are rich oxygen-coating groups between layers for interacting with water molecules, such as hydrophilic hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxylic groups [26]. In addition, these groups provide a channel for superpermeability to water molecules, which could facilitate their fast interaction processes between water molecules and GO layers. Therefore, it can be thought that the PVA film absorbs more water molecules from the surroundings when relative humidity increases. Ref. [27] shows that the refractive index was 1.53 when the PVA film was dried. The increase of water molecules absorbed by PVA film causes the decrease of refractive index of PVA film, which in turn affects the effective refractive index of the TCF cladding modes, causing wavelength shift in the interference. The changes of wavelength and intensity of the sensor coated with PVA under different RH are as shown in Fig. 5 . Through wavelength and intensity demodulation, we can see that the low sensitivity of the sensor is −0.0030 nm/%RH and 0.006 dB/%RH, while the high sensitivity is −0.0967 nm/%RH and 0.179 dB/%RH, respectively."
9,Performance of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film,"4.2 Performance of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film From Fig. 6 , it can be observed that the spectra of the 1:2 HA/PVA coated sensor are significant in both wavelength shifts and intensity changes under different relative humidity. The reflection spectra of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film resemble that of the sensor coated PVA. Both of their spectra have a blue shift with the increasing relative humidity. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a straight chain polymer glycosaminoglycan composed of glucuronic acid and the disaccharide repeating unit of n-acetaminosamine. Due to the hydrogen bonding between linear shaft monosaccharide hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid molecules in space in helical cylindrical structure rigidity, the inside of the column due to the presence of large amounts of hydroxyl and produce strong hydrophilicity, and combines the hyaluronic acid molecules lock water molecules in the double helix columnar structure, make the moisture not easily loss. HA shows excellent film formation property. The 1:2 HA/PVA composite film causes the shifting of the light energy of the cladding modes toward the radial edge of the TCF cladding, thus increasing the interaction of the cladding modes with the surroundings. This leads to a phase shift in the interference. And this phase change would be obvious due to the excitation of higher order cladding modes by the surroundings, resulting in higher sensitivity. The changes of wavelength and intensity of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA versus different RH is as shown in Fig. 7 . Compared with PVA coated sensor, we can see that the sensitivity of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film is obviously higher. Furthermore, it can be seen that the intensity of the sensor first increases and then decreases, which is completely different from the intensity change of the sensor coated with PVA. In the range of 30%RH ~ 50%RH, the low sensitivity of the sensor is −0.0255 nm /%RH and −0.154 dB/%RH by wavelength and intensity demodulation, respectively. Meanwhile, In the range of 50%RH ~ 80%RH, the high sensitivity of the sensor is −0.1679 nm/%RH and −0.148 dB/%RH by wavelength and intensity demodulation, respectively. In the experiment, a demodulator was used to record the spectrum, and the response time of the sensor was estimated to be 8 s. The spectral resolution of the demodulator is 2 pm. Therefore, the resolution of the sensor is calculated as 0.0119%RH."
10,Cross sensitivity,"4.3 Cross sensitivity Temperature can affect humidity measurement, so it is necessary to test the cross-sensitivity to temperature. The sensor was set on a heating plate and temperature ascend from 25 °C to 70 °C. The data were recorded at intervals of 5 °C. The spectra of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film under increasing temperature are as shown in Fig. 8 (a). The temperature sensitivity of the sensor is −0.0122 nm/°C, which is cross-sensitivity of 0.0727%RH/°C (see Fig. 8(b)). The changes of wavelength are slight with the temperature increasing, which indicates that the sensor’s temperature crosstalk is low. And the low cross-sensitivity is very important for humidity measurement."
11,Conclusion,"In the paper, an optical fiber sensor based on Michelson interferometer coated with HA/PVA composite film for humidity measurement is proposed. And as far as we know, hyaluronic acid is used in humidity measurement for the first time. In the experiments, four identical MIs were coated with PVA, HA, 1:1 HA/PVA, 1:2 HA/PVA for humidity measurement, respectively. From the comparison, we know that the sensitivity of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film is higher than that of the sensor coated with pure PVA or pure HA. It can be thought that adding HA to the PVA can improve sensor’s sensitivity. Through wavelength and intensity demodulation, the maximum sensitivity of the sensor coated with 1:2 HA/PVA composite film is 0.1679 nm/%RH and 0.148 dB/%RH, respectively. Meanwhile, the cross-sensitivity of this sensor is 0.0727%RH/°C. Due to great potential of hyaluronic acid in humidity measurement, the proposed sensor can be used in more fields."
