0,Introduction,"Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) can catalyze esterification, transesterification and interesterification reactions in organic media and therefore find many applications of interest to industry. For example, they can be used in the production of biodiesel, modified lipids, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals [1]. The enantioselectivity of lipases is particularly important in the production of pharmaceuticals; however, lipases also need to have good activity and stability in non-aqueous media, which are often used in synthesis reactions for the manufacture of optically pure compounds. A few commercial lipases are available that have high enantioselectivity and which are stable in organic media. Among them, Novozym 435 (lipase B from Candida antarctica, CALB, immobilized on an acrylic resin) is widely used for the resolution of racemates in industrial processes. Two examples are, first, the resolution of a key intermediate in the synthesis of Odanacatib [2] and, second, the synthesis of the key intermediate for asymmetric lamivudine [3]. Other enantioselective commercial lipases include lipase-PS (Burkholderia cepacia lipase, Amano), which is used for kinetic resolution of the racemic alcohol 2-(p-{[(p-methoxy phenyl) methoxy] methyl}phenyl) propanol, an intermediate in loxoprofen synthesis [4] and lipase AK (Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase, Amano), which selectively acetylates the (S)-enantiomer in a racemate of methyl-3-hydroxy-4-phenyl butanoate [5]. Although optically pure enantiomers used as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry are generally high value compounds, which could partially compensate for the high cost of the enzymatic process, the use of lipases for resolution of racemates at large scale is still limited by cost considerations. As a classical example, Novozym 435 costs approximately 1000 USD per kg of immobilized biocatalyst [6]. Decreasing the costs of the lipase could reduce the costs of manufacturing pharmaceutical drugs based on optically pure enantiomers. A key strategy for reducing the costs of lipases is to immobilize them on solid supports, enabling them to be reused in various batches. Immobilization may have the added benefit of increasing activity and stability of the lipases. However, immobilization itself can be costly. An alternative is to produce a low-cost biocatalyst by cultivating the lipase-producing microorganism in solid-state fermentation (SSF) on agricultural residues and then simply dry the fermented solids, which can be added directly to the reaction medium [7]. This strategy avoids various steps that are involved in the immobilization of enzymes produced by submerged fermentation: not only the concentration and purification steps, but also the immobilization step itself. In addition, the use of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganisms, such as fungi of the genus Rhizopus, means that the dry fermented solids can be used in the production of foods [8]. Since 2007, our research group has used dry fermented solids that contain lipases of Burkholderia contaminans (previously characterized as B. cepacia and as B. lata) and Rhizopus microsporus in various applications, some at liter scale [9–16]. However, we have not yet investigated the potential of these fermented solids to catalyze the kinetic resolution of chiral molecules. Although lipases of Burkholderia have high enantioselectivity [4], strains of Burkholderia are often opportunistic pathogens, which would pose a risk to workers in the production of fermented solids at large scale [9]. Therefore, in processes involving the use of fermented solids to catalyze the kinetic resolution of racemates, it would be desirable to use a GRAS organism like Rhizopus microsporus. It should be noted that the lipases of R. microsporus have not yet been used in kinetic resolutions. In the present article, we characterize lipase-containing fermented solids produced by Rhizopus microsporus. We determine their activity and stability at different temperatures and in organic media and also study their application in the kinetic resolution of the secondary alcohols (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (1), (RS)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-ol (2) and (RS)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-ol (3) (Scheme 1 ) via transesterification with several acyl donors."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents and media,"2.1 Reagents and media The reagents used were ethanol (99.5 %), methanol (99.8 %), 1-propanol (99.5 %), 1-butanol (99.4 %), tert-butanol (98 %), n-heptane (99.5 %) and n-hexane (99.5 %) from Vetec (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and tricaprylin (99 %) and triolein (65 %) from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, EUA). The ground sugarcane bagasse used to prepare the SSF medium was kindly donated by Companhia Melhoramentos Norte do Paraná (Paraná, Brazil). It was washed three times with tap water, followed by drying at 80 °C for 24 h and sieving to obtain particles between 0.85 and 2.0 mm. “Lisa” brand soybean oil (Cargill, São Paulo, Brazil) was used to induce lipase production. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Brazilian suppliers."
3,Production of the fermented solids containing lipases (RMFS),"2.2 Production of the fermented solids containing lipases (RMFS) Rhizopus microsporus CPQBA 312−07 DRM was originally isolated in Guadalajara, Mexico [16]. It was cultivated on potato dextrose agar at 30 °C for 7 days and then the spores were suspended with a Tween 80 solution (0.01 % w/v). The spore concentration in the suspension was determined using a Neubauer chamber. SSF was done in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Each flask contained 4 g of sugarcane bagasse impregnated with an emulsion containing 0.8 g soybean oil and 20 mL of culture medium. The culture medium contained (per liter) 4 g urea, 5 g lactose, 5 g K2HPO4, 1 g MgSO4.7H2O and 4 mL oligoelement solution. This oligoelement solution contained, per liter, 10 g EDTA, 2.0 g MnCl2.4H2O, 2.8 g CoSO4.7H2O, 1.5 g CaCl2.2H2O, 0.2 g CuCl2.2H2O and 0.3 g ZnSO4.7H2O; its pH was adjusted to 4.0 [10,17]. The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7.0 with 10 % HCl (v/v). Erlenmeyer flasks containing the solid substrate were plugged with cotton wool and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. After cooling, spore suspension was added to give 3 × 107 spores g−1 of dry sugarcane bagasse. The initial moisture content, 75–80 % (w/w wet basis), was measured in an infrared moisture balance (Gehaka, model IV 2000, São Paulo, Brazil). Based on a preliminary study in which tricaprylin-hydrolyzing activities and esterification activities were followed during the fermentation (see Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), the flasks were incubated for 18 h at 40 °C. The Rhizopus microsporus fermented solids (RMFS) were then produced by lyophilizing the contents of the flasks for 24 h at -45 °C and 0.1 mbar in a Jouan LP3 Lyophilizer (Allerød, Frederiksborg, Denmark). For the reactions performed in this work, the lyophilized RMFS were not further processed and were maintained at -18 °C in sealed plastic bags. They had a moisture content of approximately 20 % (w/w wet basis), a triolein-hydrolyzing activity of 170 U g−1 at 50 °C and an esterification activity of 19 ± 0.1 U g−1 at 45 °C. These activities were stable for 12 months."
4,Determination of hydrolysis activity and esterification activity,"2.3 Determination of hydrolysis activity and esterification activity During the fermentation, the tricaprylin-hydrolyzing activity of the RMFS was monitored, using samples removed from the fermentation and lyophilized for 24 h at -45 °C and 0.1 mbar in the Jouan LP3 Lyophilizer. After the fermentation, the triolein-hydrolyzing activity of the lyophilized RMFS was determined. In both cases, the titrimetric method was used. An emulsion was prepared with 67 mmol L−1 triacylglycerol (tricaprylin or triolein), 3% w/v gum arabic, 2 mmol L−1 CaCl2, 2.5 mmol L−1 Tris−HCl and 150 mmol L−1 NaCl [18]. For each assay, 20 mL of this emulsion and 250 mg of the lyophilized RMFS were mechanically stirred for 5 min in a vessel thermostated at the desired temperature, with the free fatty acids released during the reaction being titrated with 0.05 mol L−1 NaOH in a pH-Stat (Metrohm, model 718 Stat Titrino, Herisau, Switzerland) set at pH 7.0. One unit of hydrolysis activity (U) was defined as the release of 1 μmol of fatty acid per minute under the reaction conditions. Esterification activities were determined in 50-mL screw-capped vials containing 500 mg of dry RMFS and 5 mL of n-heptane that contained 210 mmol L−1 ethanol and 70 mmol L−1 oleic acid. These vials were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and 40 °C. At fixed intervals, 100-μL samples of the mixture were removed and analyzed for residual free fatty acids by the Lowry-Tinsley method [19]. One unit (U) of esterification activity was defined as the consumption of 1 μmol of fatty acid per minute, under the assay conditions. In this paper, both hydrolytic and esterification activities are expressed as units per gram of dry fermented solids (U g−1)."
5,Stability of RMFS in organic solvents,"2.4 Stability of RMFS in organic solvents RMFS were incubated in methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol, n-heptane and n-hexane. Screw-capped bottles (50 mL) containing 500 mg of dry RMFS and 5 mL of solvent were incubated on a rotary shaker at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 24 h. After incubation, the RMFS were recovered by filtration using Whatman No 1 filter paper and dried in a vacuum desiccator at 25 °C to remove the solvent. The residual esterification activity of the RMFS was then measured (section 2.3) and expressed as a percentage of the esterification activity of the control (RMFS not treated with solvents)."
6,Thermal stability of the lipase activity of RMFS in n-heptane,"2.5 Thermal stability of the lipase activity of RMFS in n-heptane Screw-capped bottles (50 mL) containing 500 mg of fermented solids and 5 mL of n-heptane were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 24 h at temperatures ranging from 20 to 65 °C. After incubation, the RMFS were recovered by filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator at 25 °C to remove the solvent. Residual esterification activity of the RMFS was measured (section 2.3) and expressed as a percentage of the esterification activity of the control (RMFS without thermal treatment)."
7,Recycling of RMFS after successive esterification reactions,"2.6 Recycling of RMFS after successive esterification reactions Esterification reactions were carried out as described above (Section 2.3). These reactions were repeated for 27 cycles, each of 4 h. After each cycle, the RMFS were recovered by filtration and placed in a new reaction medium. Relative conversion for each cycle was expressed as a percentage of the absolute conversion obtained in the first cycle."
8,Enantioselective transesterification reactions catalyzed by RMFS,"2.7 Enantioselective transesterification reactions catalyzed by RMFS Secondary alcohols (Scheme 1), synthesized according to section 2.9, were resolved kinetically by transesterification. The reactions were carried out in 50-mL screw-capped bottles, containing 568 mg of RMFS (i.e. 150 U of triolein-hydrolyzing activity, corresponding to 18.75 U mL−1) and 8 mL of reaction medium containing (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (12.5 mmol L−1) and vinyl acetate (50 mmol L−1), dissolved in organic solvent. These bottles were incubated on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm and 35 °C. In specific experiments, the following factors were evaluated: (i) the organic solvent: tetrahydrofuran (log P 0.46), tert-butyl methyl ether (log P 1.43), tert-butanol (log P 1.45), n-hexane (log P 3.5) and n-heptane (log P 4.0); (ii) the acyl donor: ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate; (iii) the reaction temperature: 35, 40 and 45 °C; (iv) the amount of dry RMFS: 570, 710 and 1770 mg (these values correspond to triolein-hydrolyzing activities of 68.4, 85.2 and 212.4 U, respectively); (v) the concentration of isopropenyl acetate: 50 and 550 mmol L−1; (vi) the type of secondary alcohol: (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (1), (RS)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-ol (2), (RS)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-ol (3). Reactions were performed at 40 °C and 200 rpm unless otherwise specified. During the reactions, 80 μL samples of the reaction medium were taken and assayed by chiral gas chromatography (Section 2.10)."
9,Evaluation of the enantioselectivity of the lipases of RMFS,"2.8 Evaluation of the enantioselectivity of the lipases of RMFS The enantiomeric excesses of substrate (ees, %) and product (eep, %) were defined on the basis of the S-enantiomer relative to the R-enantiomer and were determined based on the peak areas in the chromatogram for each enantiomer: (1) e e % = ( S - R ) / ( S + R ) × 100 For the calculation of ees, R and S are the peak areas, respectively, for the (R)-enantiomer and the (S)-enantiomer of the substrate. For the calculation of eep, R and S are the peak areas, respectively, for the (R)-enantiomer and the (S)-enantiomer of the product. The percentage conversion (c) was calculated as [20]: (2) c % = e e S / ( e e S + e e p ) × 100 When only one time-point was analyzed, the enantiomeric ratio (S relative to R, denoted E SR) was calculated as [20]: (3) E S R = l n 1 - c 1 - e e s / l n 1 - c 1 + e e s When several time-points were available, E SR was calculated according to Mitchell et al. [21]. This method involves the fitting of a model to profiles of dimensionless concentrations of the two enantiomers of the chiral substrate, plotted against the degree of conversion. The model equations were deduced for a reversible Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism, in which the chiral substrate enters second and the chiral product leaves second (Supplementary Material, Section S1). The absolute configurations of the enantiomers of both the secondary alcohols used as substrates in the transesterifications and the esters produced were attributed indirectly by comparing the retention times of the enantiomers with those obtained in the same reactions catalyzed by lipase B of Candida antarctica (CALB). The R-enantiopreference of CALB for the alcohols used in this work is well known [22,23]."
10,"Synthesis of the racemates of (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (1), (RS)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-ol (2), (RS)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-ol (3) and respective acetates","2.9 Synthesis of the racemates of (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (1), (RS)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-ol (2), (RS)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-ol (3) and respective acetates The racemates of secondary alcohols 1–3 and their respective acetates 1a-3a (Scheme 1) were synthesized according to previously published protocols of reduction, acetylation, purification and spectrometric characterization [24]. All characterization data of compounds 1–3 and 1a-3a (Supplementary Material, Section S2) agreed with literature values."
11,Analytical methods,"2.10 Analytical methods 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX200 MHz spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on the same instrument at 50 MHz. The chemical shifts of 1H and 13C NMR are quoted relative to internal standards of tetramethylsilane (δ TMS = 0.00) or CDCl3 (δ C = 77.0). 1H NMR data are reported as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, sext = sextet, m = multiplet), coupling constant (Hz) and relative intensity (integral). 13C NMR data are reported as chemical shift in ppm (δ). GC–MS spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model QP-5050A chromatograph (MS), equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL min−1 constant flow). The injector temperature was set to 250 °C for all alcohols. For alcohols 1-3, the temperature program was 50 °C for 1 min, an increase of 7 °C min-1 up to 250 °C, with 250 °C being maintained for 10 min. Infrared spectra were recorded in a Bomem MB100 spectrometer using a sample/KBr mass ratio of 1:1000. The spectra were obtained in transmission mode between 400 and 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Peaks at which maximal absorption occurred (ν max) were reported in terms of wavenumber (cm−1). Chiral GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu model GC-17A chromatograph (FID) equipped with a CP Chirasil-DEX CB column (25 m length × 0.25 mm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness). The split ratio was 1:50 and N2 was used as the carrier gas. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 220 °C. Temperature programming for the chiral analyses of the alcohols and esters shown in Scheme 1 is reported below. Compounds 1 and 1a: 110 °C for 1 min, then 110–120 °C at 1 °C min−1; Retention times (min): (R)-1: 4.29; (S)-1: 4.57; (R)-1a: 3.81; (S)-1a: 3.57. Compounds 3 and 3a: 160–172 °C at 1 °C min−1; Retention times (min): (R)-3: 8.10; (S)-3: 8.57; (R)-3a: 5.61; (S)-3a: 5.43. Compounds 2 and 2a: 110–138 °C at 1 °C min−1; Retention times (min): (R)-2: 6.84; (S)-2: 7.11; (R)-2a: 25.13; (S)-2a: 24.74."
12,Results,
13,Stability of the esterification activity of Rhizopus microsporus fermented solids (RMFS) in organic solvents,"3.1 Stability of the esterification activity of Rhizopus microsporus fermented solids (RMFS) in organic solvents The stability of the esterification activity of RMFS in organic solvents was evaluated by incubating samples of RMFS in solvents with log P values ranging from -0.76 to 4.0, for 24 h at 30 °C. The residual esterification activity of the RMFS increased with log P, with 100 % residual activity being obtained after incubation in n-hexane (log P 3.5) and n-heptane (log P 4.0) (Fig. 1 ). On the other hand, there was no residual activity after incubation in methanol (log P -0.76). These results agree with most reports of the stability of lipases in organic solvents. The higher the hydrophilicity of a solvent (i.e. the lower its log P), the higher is its ability to remove the essential layer of water around the enzyme and, consequently, the higher is its ability to denature the enzyme [25]."
14,Effect of temperature on activity and stability of the lipases contained in the Rhizopus microsporus fermented solids (RMFS),3.2 Effect of temperature on activity and stability of the lipases contained in the Rhizopus microsporus fermented solids (RMFS) The triolein-hydrolyzing activity and the esterification activity of dry RMFS were determined at temperatures ranging from 20 to 65 °C (Fig. 2 ). The highest triolein-hydrolyzing activity was 170 U g−1 at 50 °C while the highest esterification activity was 19 U g−1 at 45 °C.
15,Recycling the fermented solids for catalyzing successive esterification reactions,"3.3 Recycling the fermented solids for catalyzing successive esterification reactions The same batch of RMFS was used in 27 successive esterification reactions using oleic acid (70 mmol L−1) and ethanol (210 mmol L−1) in n-heptane. Each cycle was done at 40 °C and 200 rpm for 4 h (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). The absolute conversion in the first cycle was 98 %. In subsequent cycles, the relative conversion remained between 95 and 100 % for the first 23 cycles, and between 85 and 90 % from cycle 24 to cycle 27. This result shows that RMFS are highly stable in n-heptane."
16,Transesterification of secondary alcohols,"3.4 Transesterification of secondary alcohols Initially, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate were evaluated as acyl donors in the transesterification of alcohol 1. With vinyl acetate the conversion was very low (3%), but E SR was high (> 200) while with isopropenyl acetate the conversion was higher (13 %), but E SR was significantly lower (Table 1 , Entries 1 and 2, respectively). There was no conversion with ethyl acetate (Table 1, Entry 3). Given the high E SR obtained with vinyl acetate, we attempted to improve the conversion by changing the solvent, however, it was unsuccessful. The conversion was lower with n-hexane and there was no conversion in the other solvents tested (Table 1, Entries 4–8). Therefore n-heptane was maintained as the solvent and isopropenyl acetate was used as the acyl donor. Reaction profiles were obtained at 35 °C and two higher temperatures, 40 and 45 °C. The best conversion, of about 20 % at 104 h, was obtained at 40 °C (Fig. 3 ). At this temperature, E SR was 15, while at 45 °C, E SR was 10 (Supplementary Material, Table S1), this lower value being consistent with previous reports of lower enantiomeric ratios being attained at higher temperatures [26,27]. The effect of using an excess of isopropenyl acetate was then tested at 40 °C: increasing the isopropenyl acetate concentration from 50 to 550 mmol L−1 (a 44-fold excess, as used previously by Moure et al. [28]) increased the conversion from 18 to 23 % (Table 1, Entries 9 and 10, respectively). The excess of acyl donor also increased the E SR value from 16 to 26 % (Table 1, Entries 9 and 10, respectively). This increase of E SR might be related to changes in the reaction medium caused by the excess of acyl donor. These changes might affect the microenvironment of the enzyme, changing its conformation. The optimal conditions for the transesterification of alcohol 1 were then used for the transesterification of alcohols 2 and 3 by RMFS. Alcohols 2 and 3 gave higher conversions (50 % and 32 %, respectively) than did alcohol 1 (23 %), but they also led to E SR values below 10 (Table 1, Entries 11 and 12, respectively), which are lower than those obtained with alcohol 1 (E SR ∼20). Kinetic profiles were obtained for the transesterification of alcohols 1 and 2 under the optimal conditions. For both 1 (Fig. 4 A) and 2 (Fig. 4C), the conversion reached its maximum at 72 h (23 % and 50 %, respectively). The values of E SR, obtained by fitting the model of Mitchell et al. [21] to the reaction profiles, were 26 for alcohol 1 and 8 for alcohol 2 (Fig. 4B and D), confirming the ESR value obtained by applying the Chen equation for results at a single reaction time."
17,Discussion,"We have shown that fermented solids that contain lipases produced by Rhizopus microsporus (RMFS) have enantiopreference for the S-isomers in the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. This result is particularly interesting because most of the enantioselective lipases described so far show R-enantiopreferences for these alcohols (i.e. they follow the Kazlauskas rule [29]); lipases with S-enantiopreference, commonly referred to as ""anti-Kazlauskas lipases"", are relatively rare. Below, we discuss the importance of the S-enantiopreference of RMFS, in the context of current knowledge regarding the stereoselectivity of lipases."
18,The molecular basis of stereoselectivity and the lipases of Rhizopus,"4.1 The molecular basis of stereoselectivity and the lipases of Rhizopus The enantiopreference of a lipase with a chiral substrate depends on how the properties of both the lipase and the substrate affect the interactions necessary for catalysis to occur. In the case of secondary alcohols, the size, shape and charge of the substituent on the carbon atom bearing the alcohol group are of key importance. With respect to the lipase, various factors determine which enantiomer is preferred and the strength of the preference [30]. The first is the steric exclusion effect, which arises from the chirality of the catalytic pocket of the lipase. This is the basis of the Kazlauskas rule: most lipases have a catalytic pocket in which the R-enantiomer of secondary alcohols with bulky substituents fits better. The second is the spatial positioning of key groups within the active site, including the catalytic histidine, the catalytic serine and two NH groups that form hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion intermediate [31]. The third is the structural flexibility of the lipase: Lipases with lower structural flexibility usually exhibit higher enantioselectivity, as they can better distinguish between the two enantiomers. Since lipases often have higher structural rigidity in organic solvents, enantioselectivity is improved in these solvents compared to aqueous systems [32]. The fourth is the surface charge of the enzyme. Charged groups on the substrate surface can affect enantioselectivity by affecting the rigidity of the enzyme [33] or by allowing preferential opening of the lipase lid in interactions with one of the enantiomers [34]. In the case of the lipases present in the RMFS, it is not possible to say how these factors give S-enantiopreference for aromatic secondary alcohols since 3D structures are scarce for lipases of Rhizopus microsporus: The only structure in the protein data bank (PDB) is that of the lipase of Rhizopus chinensis (Rhizopus microsporus var. chinensis) (see https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6A0W) [35]. Further, studies of docking and molecular dynamics with lipases of Rhizopus are rare and such studies have investigated the stereoselective hydrolysis of triacylglycerols [36–38], triradylglycerols [39] and p-nitrophenol caprylate [40] and not the kinetic resolution of racemates of aromatic secondary alcohols. In fact, the only study of docking with aromatic secondary alcohols was done for CALB, in which a range of derivatives of 1-phenylethanol were investigated. A crucial determinant for the R-stereoselectivity of CALB was stabilization of the phenyl ring of the substrate in the active site by π-π stacking [41]. Insights into the interaction of the lipases of Rhizopus microsporus with aromatic secondary alcohols are unlikely to be obtained from previous studies with the lipases of other species of Rhizopus. Although lipases of Rhizopus have been used in kinetic resolutions, most studies have used the lipases of Rhizopus oryzae or Rhizopus arrhizus [42]. In fact, the only use of a lipase of Rhizopus in the resolution of an aromatic secondary alcohol was the resolution of derivatives of 2-benzylglycerol by the lipase of Rhizopus sp. (Amano), but no structure-function studies, such as docking or molecular dynamics, were done [43]."
19,The potential to use lipases of Rhizopus microsporus in kinetic resolutions,"4.2 The potential to use lipases of Rhizopus microsporus in kinetic resolutions Rhizopus microsporus produces various lipases [44], meaning that RMFS might contain more than one lipase with S-enantiopreference and one or more lipases with R-enantiopreference. Conflicting enantiopreferences would lead to RMFS having a lower enantioselectivity than individual lipases purified from it. In other words, RMFS likely contains a lipase with a higher S-enantiopreference than is indicated by our best value for E SR for (R,S)-1-phenylethanol of 26. Lipases with high S-enantiopreference for aromatic secondary alcohols would find useful applications in chiral chemistry. For example, they can be used to produce pure (R)-secondary alcohols. One application would be in the production of pure (R)-1-phenylethanol, which would be the predominant alcohol substrate left over after a kinetic resolution of (RS)-1-phenylethanol using an anti-Kazlauskas lipase. (R)-1-phenylethanol is widely used in the cosmetic industry due to its mild floral odor [45], and also has applications as a solvatochromic dye, an ophthalmic preservative and an inhibitor of the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine [46]. Various derivatives of (R)-1-phenylethanol are also used as building blocks for the synthesis of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and analogues of natural products [22]. Pure enantiomers derived from the other compounds for which RMFS showed S-enantiopreference also have potential applications. For example, it may be possible to produce new pharmacologically active compounds from 2 through glycosylation, reduction and substitution reactions [47] and 3 is a key chiral building block for the synthesis of compounds used to treat allergies [48]. Applications of RMFS with other aromatic secondary alcohols should also be investigated. It is likely the RMFS will maintain their S-enantiopreference: (RS)-1-phenylethanol is widely used as a model compound to test the enantioselectivity of lipases against aromatic secondary alcohols and, in the case of lipases with R-enantiopreference, this enantiopreference is maintained for a wide range of substrates [49,50]."
20,Comparison with other studies of the resolution of racemates involving SSF,"4.3 Comparison with other studies of the resolution of racemates involving SSF Reports on kinetic resolution of racemates using dry fermented solids that contain lipases are scarce. In a pioneering study, Nagy et al. [51] studied the kinetic resolution of racemates of secondary alcohols (1-phenyl-1-ethanol, 1-cyclohexyl-1-ethanol and 1-naphtha-2-yl-ethanol) in acetylation reactions using dry fermented solids produced by 38 fungi on a mixture of wheat bran (9 g) and olive oil (1 g). With (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol, almost all dry fermented solids gave conversions around 50 % and enantioselectivity ratios (E) above 200, with enantiopreference for the (R)-enantiomer, following the Kazlauskas rule [29]. The exception was the dry fermented solid produced with Mucor hiemalis NRRL 13.009, which showed preference for the (S)-enantiomer. Our best results for the resolution of the same compound (23 % conversion and an E SR value of 26) are better than those reported by Nagy et al. [51] using the dry fermented solids of M. hiemalis (14 % conversion and an E SR value of 15). Szigeti et al. [52] performed kinetic resolutions of racemic (3E)-4-phenyl but-3-en-2-ol and (3E)-4-(furan-2-yl)but-3-en-2-ol, using seven fungal lipases, produced by solid-state fermentation and submerged fermentation, and also seven commercial lipases. Only two fermented solids (those produced using M. hiemalis ATCC 26,035 and Rhizomucor pusillus WFPL 267 A) showed preference for the (S)-enantiomer, but the conversions and the enantioselectivity values were low. With (3E)-4-phenyl but-3-en-2-ol, the fermented solids produced with M. hiemalis and R. pusillus gave conversions of 8% and 12 %, respectively. With (3E)-4-(furan-2-yl)but-3-en-2-ol, the fermented solids produced with M. hiemalis and R. pusillus gave conversions of 3% and 28 %, respectively. In all cases, E SR was 7 or lower. Boratyński et al. [53] used a different technique to perform kinetic resolutions using lipases produced by solid-state fermentation. The fermentations were done with 26 fungi using a substrate composed of rapeseed cake and linseed cake. A racemate of 1-phenyl ethyl acetate dissolved in acetone and water (1:1) was sprayed onto 3-day-old fermenting solids, with the progress of the reaction being monitored for 10 days. Most of the fungi transformed the (R)-isomer of (RS)-1-phenyl ethyl acetate into the corresponding (R)-alcohol with high enantiomeric excess. Using the same technique, Boratyński et al. [54] studied the resolution of a mixture of cis and trans whisky lactones (5-butyl-4-methyldihydro-2(3H)-furanone) by two strains of filamentous fungi (Fusarium oxysporum AM13 and Papularia rosea AM17). F. oxysporum produced the best results, with high enantiomeric excesses (above 98 % for each lactone) of trans-(+)-(4S,5R) and cis-(+)-(4R,5R) whisky lactones. Although we did not study the resolution of these aroma compounds, our method of adding dried fermented solids to the reaction medium has a key advantage over the method of Boratyński et al. [53]: it facilitates product recovery and purification, since the dry fermented solids can be easily removed from the reaction medium by centrifugation or filtration. This was not possible in the system of Boratyński et al. [53]. Another issue with the technique proposed by Boratyński et al. [53,54] is that the addition of the substrates to be resolved might affect the growth of the fungus and the production of the desired enzymes."
21,Conclusion,"We produced dry fermented solids of Rhizopus microsporus (RMFS) with lipolytic activity. RMFS are simple to produce and have high operational stability. As such, they have potential to be used in the preparation of enantiomerically pure secondary alcohols at industrial scale. In kinetic resolution of racemates, the lipases in RMFS showed selectivity toward the S-enantiomers of the secondary alcohols (RS)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol (1), (RS)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-ol (2) and (RS)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-ol (3). For 1, the best results were a conversion of 23 % and an enantiomeric ratio (E SR) of 26, using isopropenyl acetate as the acyl donor. Although the conversion and E SR values were relatively low, lipases that have anti-Kazlauskas enantiopreference are quite uncommon. Our work lays the basis for further studies aimed at increasing both the conversion and S-enantiopreference of RMFS in kinetic resolutions."
