0,Introduction,"Global energy demand is currently mostly dependent upon power production utilizing fossil fuels. Research has been carried out on cleaner energy production to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns. However, there is a big gap between global energy demands and energy production from fossil fuels via cleaner routes. Among different fossil fuels, natural gas is widely available with estimated reserves of 7019 trillion cubic feet and is majorly employed for power generation [1]. There is always a desire to utilise fossil fuels more cleanly and produce high energy density low emission fuels such as hydrogen and syngas [2,3]. For instance, natural gas is also employed in various reforming techniques to produce hydrogen and hydrogen-rich syngas [4,5]. Some methods of producing hydrogen-rich syngas include methane steam reforming [6], dry reforming [7–9], oil reforming [10], gasification of coal [11] and partial oxidation of methane [4,5,12]. Hydrogen-rich syngas is one of the most needed constituents in the chemical industry for the production of value-added chemicals via Fischer-Tropsch [13]. As reported, there is a high potential in syngas for the energy sector to decarbonize many industries, for the transport of energy and gas heating [14]. Hydrogen-rich syngas is used as a fuel in fuel cells because it yields high efficiency that is desired for automobile applications [15,16]. Therefore, it is important to study the different methods of hydrogen-rich syngas production in a cleaner way. It is a fact that all methods of syngas production have unique toxic and carbon footprints [17]. Efforts have been carried out by researchers to employ natural gas for syngas production as it is a better alternative to minimize greenhouse emissions [18]. The highly stable molecules of CH4 and O2 require high activation energy to overcome the energy barrier to produce syngas. The generation of hydrogen-rich syngas from methane is a challenging process owing to the possess complexity in controlling reaction stability from total combustion and syngas ratio [19]. Several studies proposed two different reaction mechanisms for methane; one is the direct conversion mechanism that uses CH4 and O2 over the catalyst to generate syngas [20,21]. The other is an indirect mechanism in which reactant gasses CH4 and O2 follow water gas shift (WGS) [22] and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) [23] to produce H2O and CO2 which is further converted into syngas with the help of excess methane [24]. Direct conversion, which is so-called partial oxidation of methane (POM) as presented in reaction (R1) [25], is a likely route to produce hydrogen-rich syngas theoretically produced H2/CO ratio 2.0 that is more favourable for down streaming to chemical synthesis, for example, methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) [26]. This process also yields some other valuable products such as formaldehyde [27], acetylene [28], and other hydrocarbons [29,30]. (R1) CH 4 + 1 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 + C O Δ H 25 ° C = − 36 k J / m o l POM is said to be advantageous over other reforming techniques since it is an exothermic process whereas other reforming techniques are mostly endothermic requiring a large amount of energy to complete the reaction pathways. So, POM required lower energy as compared to other reforming techniques [31]. Fast reaction kinetics and favourable thermodynamics of POM are great attentions for researchers to focus on this process. Production of hydrogen-rich syngas process has high methane conversion efficiency along with excellent hydrogen selectivity employing high space velocities [32]. POM produces products directly through parallel surface reactions and due to high surface temperature, the products are favoured under short contact time [19,33]. Moreover, the POM has advantages of flexible feedstock composition and control over production capacity [34]. Despite the advantages of POM, there are identified challenges in this process, such as (i) hot spots generated in catalyst bed due to excessive thermal gradients (ii) high cost of O2 separation which is to be reduced (iii) explication of reaction paths by improving catalyst design for better H2/CO ratio above 2.0 which is more desirable for its applications [35]. For instance, POM in presence of an active catalyst (Ni/YbO3) which resulted in producing CO and H2, gave rise to abrupt hot spots (i.e., temperature gradient) due to exothermic reaction. The temperature gradient between the hot spot point and temperature assessed by a thermocouple placed at a short distance from the catalyst bed was as high as 300 °C [36]. Synthesis of an efficient and low-cost catalyst to cater for the H2/CO ratio and eliminate the hotspot formation over the catalyst which gives rise to the local temperature is another challenge [37]. Catalysts for POM are classified into two types such as noble and transition metals. Noble metals in comparison to transition metals demonstrated high catalytic activity as well as inhibited coke formation. However, the high cost and rare availability make them less suitable for commercialization [38,39]. Among the transition metals, Ni and Co have proven the most practical giving higher turnover rates and also inexpensive [19,40]. The Ni-based catalysts with various supports such as Al2O3 [41], MgAl2O4 [42], SiO2 [43], MgO [44] and ZrO2 [45] has been studied for reforming techniques and have shown a prominent conversion. Despite the popularity of Ni, Co-based catalysts have also been investigated for POM and it reveals the stable steady-state performance even at elevated temperatures [46]. A previously conducted study has shown that catalysts based on Co and Ni-Co demonstrated high CH4 conversion and are more active for POM [47]. Further, Ni and Co have similar properties as Pt and highly active in completely reduced form in a hydrogen environment at high temperatures [48]. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that both Ni and Co-based catalysts have shown an activity influenced by the structure of support as well as the nature of active metals dispersed on support. So, support selection performs a crucial role in catalytic activity [31]. Transition metals have shown an enhanced catalytic activity owing to the effective metal-support interaction [49,50]. Furthermore, the morphology of the support has a significant impact on metal dispersion and metal-support interaction, which determines the catalytic activity of the POM [51]. So, it is requisite to investigate the synthesis of well-defined nanostructures such as ZnO nanoprisms (ZnO-NPr) surely assist metal-support interaction and aid dispersion for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide support such as ZnO can be easily synthesized having different morphology by employing different synthesis techniques to utilised as support material in catalytic applications. ZnO possesses three different crystal structures, hexagonal wurtzite, zinc blend and rock salt. Among these structures, the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure is the most stable and can be employed for POM [52]. Further defects in ZnO cause morphological changes which in result helps to enhance the metal-support interaction, consequently improving POM activity [53]. In this work, ZnO-NPr were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr by employing the wetness impregnation process and tested for POM in a fixed bed reactor. The catalysts were characterized by X-Ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Electron dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, Flourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) for structural, morphological and stability analysis. The catalytic performance Ni-Co/ZnO-NPr were tested for various temperature and flow rates. Furthermore, the stability of catalyst was tested longer times on stream (TOS) up to 56 h. Finally, the spent catalyst after 56 h TOS was characterized by XRD, SEM, Raman and TGA for structural, morphological and carbon deposition."
1,Experimental,
2,Material synthesis,"2.1 Material synthesis 2.1.1 Preparation of ZnO nanoprisms A schematic flow diagram of hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO-NPr is shown below in Fig. 1. A 1 molar solution of Zinc Acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2.2 H2O, ≥ 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich] was prepared in 100 mL deionized (DI) water and kept under stirring for 20 min 3–5 molar NaOH [NaOH, 100%, Sigma Aldrich] solution was prepared in 50 mL ethanol [CH3CH2OH, 99.8%, Sigma Aldrich]. Alkali solution was poured dropwise into Zinc Acetate solution and kept on stirring till the solution turns milky. The pH of the solution was kept in the range of 9–11. The prepared solution is then transferred into a Teflon autoclave (250 mL) hydrothermal reactor and kept at 100 °C for 24 h in a forced convection high-performance oven (SHEL LAB) made up of stainless steel with temperature ranging from 25 °C to 250 °C. After 24 h, the hydrothermal reactor was removed from the oven and allowed to cool down at room temperature. The sample is then centrifuged and washed with DI water several times. Precipitates were dried at 100 °C for 24 h in the oven and finally grinded to a fine powder for later use as previously reported [54]. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Ni-Co/ZnO-NPs Co and Ni loading was carried out by wet impregnation method over ZnO-NPr as depicted in Fig. 2. 100 mL solution of 1 g ZnO-NPr was prepared in DI water, a measured quantity of Cobalt Nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2.6 H2O, ≥ 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich] and Nickel Nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2.6 H2O, ≥ 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich] were added for 5% by weight metal loading over ZnO-NPr. The resulted solution was kept on stirring overnight at 50 °C. Finally, the solution was transferred into the oven for drying and kept at 110 °C for the next 24 h. The catalyst was collected and grinded before the calcination in a muffle furnace at 500 °C in the air for 3 h. After calcination, resulted products were allowed to cool down to room temperature. The final catalyst was grinded into a fine powder that is ready to use in POM reaction."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Catalysts are extensively studied and characterized through various characterisation techniques. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of synthesized catalysts was performed on XRD apparatus (Bruker, D8 advanced) employing a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) source and fitted with a 25-kV power. The data were collected in the range of 20–70° of 2θ with the step-scan of 0.02°. XRD is a non-destructive technique used to explore the structural characteristics of a material such as phase purity, dimensions of crystallites, atomic positions and symmetry, shape, size and atomic spacing of a unit cell of crystalline materials. The morphology of ZnO-NPr and bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN-VEGA-3). SEM images were examined with a field magnification of 5 µm-500 nm with an accelerating voltage of 15.0–10.0 kV. EDS analysis was performed on the same apparatus as for SEM (TESCAN-VEGA-3) by adjusting the voltage at 20 kV and width 15 mm. Synthesized catalysts were identified using a Raman spectrometer (BWTEK, BWS415–5325-I-Raman portable) for the wavelength range of 200–800 nm, to investigate the interaction between the chemical bonds specifically the interaction between metal and support material. FTIR spectra of prepared catalysts were obtained with the help of FTIR spectrum 100 PerkinElmer to study the functional groups' interaction with present species. Transmittance data of powdered catalysts were recorded in the range of 600–4000 cm⁻1 with a scan rate of 2 cm⁻1 for better analysis under standard conditions. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is the technique to check the thermal stability of prepared catalysts. TGA was performed with the help of a TGA 5500 analyser (TA Instruments, USA) and N2 gas was used for purging with the flow rate of 3.5 mL min−1 for half an hour. Catalysts were heated from ambient to 900 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1."
4,Partial oxidation of methane experimental setup,"2.3 Partial oxidation of methane experimental setup A schematic diagram for POM experimental setup is presented below Fig. 3. Both the feed gases CH4 (99.99% research grade 5) and O2 (99.99% research grade 5) were regulated with the help of mass flow controllers (MF4603-n1–1-bv-a, Servoflo Corporation, USA). The reactor is made of cylindrical stainless steel (SS-316) tube, 40 cm in length while having 12 and 14 mm inner and outer diameter respectively. In the middle of the tube, the catalyst was loaded for its extensive study in POM. Quartz wool was used to keep the tube in the centre and avoid temperature loss into the environment. PARR 4871 series control system integrated with two K-type thermocouples near the catalyst bed (limiting the error ± 1.1 °C or 0.4%) is used for Continuous monitoring and controlling the temperature throughout the reaction. More than one thermocouple is installed to avoid uncertainty in temperature readings and to detect the malfunctioning of any thermocouple. Feed and product gases after passing through the tube over catalyst passed by the condenser to remove the moisture and then introduced into Gas Chromatograph GC (GC-2010 Pro, SHIMADZU, Japan) equipped with TCD capillary column (RT-MS5A, 30 m x 0.32 mm ID, 30 µm) for detection of H2, CO2, CH4, and CO."
5,Catalytic activity calculations,2.4 Catalytic activity calculations The catalytic activity of the catalysts was calculated by using Eqs. (1–4). (1) CH 4 conversion ( X CH 4 ) % = [ ( n CH 4 ) converted ( n CH 4 ) feed × 100 ] (2) H 2 selectivity ( S H 2 ) % = [ ( nH 2 ) produced ( 2 × n CH 4 ) converted × 100 ] (3) CO Selectivity ( S C O ) % = [ ( nCO ) produced ( n CH 4 ) C o n v e r t e d × 100 ] (4) H 2 C O Ratio = [ S H 2 S CO ]
6,Results and discussion,
7,Material Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Material Physicochemical properties XRD pattern of synthesized catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 4. The pattern received demonstrated the hexagonal arrangement of zincite crystal atoms having a wurtzite structure with (P63mc (186)) space group for ZnO-NPr. The peaks were found in good agreement with the reported (PDF# 99–0111) data [55]. The hkl (101) is the dominant peak of the XRD pattern indicating the growth of ZnO-NPr along c-axis. No extra characteristic peak is observed except ZnO, which indicates that the synthesized material ZnO-NPr is free from impurities. In the cobalt loaded ZnO-NPr (Co/ZnO-NPr) catalyst a small shift is observed with the ZnO-NPr wurtzite peaks. The observed peak at 2θ equal to 47.56° with a shift from 47.23° showed the decrease in intensity that confirm the presence of cobalt. The peak is in good arrangement with the reported pattern data of (PDF#05–0727) for cobalt with the hexagonal arrangement (P63/mmc (194)). At this 2θ value shows the reflection from the plane (101). The pattern for nickel loaded ZnO-Npr (Ni/ZnO-NPr) also confirmed a small shift as observed for (Co/ZnO-NPr). The presence of nickel was confirmed from the pattern which shows the matching peaks of 2θ at 29.45°, 31.93°, 39.13° and 56.78° with the main peak at 31.93° showing reflection from the (002) plane. The hexagonal arrangement primitive arrangement and peaks were confirmed with the reported data (PDF#14–0481). The bimetal impregnation (Ni-Co/ZnO-NPr) was confirmed from the pattern where all the peaks were in arrangement with all the above discussed reported data for ZnO-NPr, cobalt and nickel loaded ZnO-NPr except the disappeared peak at 39.13° which confirmed that cobalt loading is prominent in bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr. Except for the peak at 2θ at 39.13° other peaks at 31.93° and 56.78° for nickel loading and 47.56° for cobalt loading is found in good agreement. ZnO belonging to space group P63mc is defined by each Zn+2 ion being surrounded by four O−2 ions and vice versa [56]. The defects on the Zn interstitial are tuned by transition metal deposition on the surface of ZnO-NPr; consequently increasing the catalytic activity [53]. The presence of transition metal atoms on the ZnO support surface could react with the oxygen present within the ZnO matrix, leaving behind defects [52]. Furthermore, Zincite possesses a high melting temperature of 1975 °C [57], which is assumed to be responsible for catalyst stability. Further, the morphology of ZnO-NPr and catalyst loaded ZnO-NPr was investigated using SEM and found all the ZnO-NPr of hexagonal shape with partially filled cores. All the ZnO structures are shown visibly in Fig. 5(a-d) and found of hexagonal nanoprism shape almost equal in size were preserved. ZnO-NPr is visualized in Fig. 5(a,b) with the size ranging from 220 to 480 nm with an average size of 386 nm. Hydrothermally synthesized ZnO-NPr have been obtained due to the formation of OH˗1 ions in the dual solvent-based solution which promoted the growth of hexagonal ZnO-NPr [55,58]. Partially filled cores of ZnO-NPr could be the result of an etching done by O−2 ions formed during the process [55]. Metal loaded ZnO-NPr are shown in Fig. 5(c,d) where catalyst impregnation is observed. It is assessed that ZnO-NPr is stacked on each other in an irregular orientation to form an agglomerated layered structure. The catalyst loading may be assessed as a tiny particulate connected onto the surface of hexagonal ZnO-NPr. Smaller particles possess a high surface area [59,60] which encourages metal to support interaction and dispersion of active phases within the catalyst [61]. While catalyst with larger particle size such as ZnO-NPr with an average particle size of 386 nm could have a low surface area which promotes the deposition of metal onto the surface as seen in Fig. 5(c,d), resulting in the active phase fully exposed to catalytic reaction for high methane conversion [59,61]. Further, the exposed outer surface of the catalyst participating in POM reaction taking place at a high temperature can also enhance the conversion efficiency [62]. EDS analysis was also performed to confirm the elements of synthesized nanostructures. Fig. 6(a) has confirmed the presence of zinc and oxygen in ZnO-NPr and the presence of nickel and cobalt is observed in Fig. 6(b). The synthesized materials contain only desired elements without any impurity. It can be seen from the data that Co loading is 3.58% by weight while Ni is only 0.63% by weight which reveals that in bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr, Co loading is more prominent in comparison to Ni as observed in the XRD pattern. Raman spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the phase purity as well as potential defects in the synthesised materials. Loaded metal may join lattice points or segregate out of crystals and remain as an amorphous phase within the materials. To assess the effects of loading in the ZnO-NPr, Raman spectroscopy was used. Raman spectra of ZnO-NPr, single and bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr is drawn in the range of 200–800 cm⁻1 and presented in Fig. 7. At 437 cm⁻1, both pristine and metal loaded ZnO-NPr have a dominant peak. While other peaks were observed at 510 cm⁻1 and 583 cm⁻1 [63]. Raman peaks for metal loaded ZnO were like those for pristine ZnO but the change in peak position and intensity was observed. When Ni was loaded on ZnO-NPr, the peak intensity at 437 cm⁻1 increases while the intensity of peaks at 510 cm⁻1 and 583 cm⁻1 was decreased, when Co was loaded onto ZnO-NPr, the peak intensity at 437 cm−1 decreased and increases at 510 cm⁻1 and 583 cm⁻1. A redshift was also observed in peak positions which confirm the presence of loaded metals [64,65]. In bimetal loaded ZnO, the intensity of the Raman peak at 437 cm−1 was decreased, but the intensity of the other peaks was increased in comparison to pristine and Ni loaded ZnO-NPr, which confirms the prominence of cobalt in bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr that is also observed in both XRD and EDS analysis. Functional groups investigation of pristine ZnO-NPr, Co loaded ZnO-NPr, Ni loaded ZnO-NPr, and Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr catalysts was carried out with the help of FTIR spectroscopy. Fig. 8 depicts the FTIR spectra of all catalysts in the range of 600–4000 cm⁻1. The absorption peak at 670 cm⁻1 relates to the metal-oxygen stretching vibration of ZnO [66]. While, relatively pronounced absorption peaks at 670 cm⁻1 and 830 cm⁻1 may be ascribed to Co and Ni incorporation into the ZnO Wurtzite lattice respectively [67,68]. Further, in Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr peaks appearing at 670 cm⁻1 have shown more intensity in comparison to the peak at 830 cm⁻1 likely due to Co loading being prominent in Ni-Co loaded catalyst. The additional peak observed at 1025 cm⁻1 for pristine ZnO-NPr represents the stretching vibration of C-N bond present in primary amine or the stretching vibration of C-O bond of primary alcohol owing to the presence of residual organics that are absent when Ni and Co are added. Besides the weak intensity of the peak alludes to those traces of organic remain in ZnO after calcination at 500 °C. Further, the band appeared at 1330 and 1390 cm⁻1 indicates O-C-O stretching vibration [69]. Absorption peak appearing near 1550 cm⁻1 in ZnO-NPr spectra is ascribed to the presence of water but surprisingly is not present in Ni, Co and Ni-Co metal loaded ZnO-NPr which is likely due to the reduced water affinity in metal loaded ZnO-NPr. The peak near 3400 cm⁻1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of OH⁻1 moieties, which directed the growth of hexagonal nanoprisms [55,58]. Furthermore, the thermal stability of prepared catalysts was tested using thermal gravimetric analysis and shown in Fig. 9. ZnO-NPr has shown a decreasing trend up to 400 °C and then is proven a stable catalyst with the increase in temperature. The formation of zincite crystal having a high melting temperature of 1975 °C [57], could be responsible for catalyst stability. While bimetal loading enhanced the stability of the catalyst, and no prominent weight loss is observed. A little weight loss is assumed due to the loss of oxygen at high temperatures giving rise to the defects in ZnO, that assist in enhancing the activity of catalyst [53]. In addition, Co loading limits the weight loss further, to avoid the decline as observed for ZnO-NPr."
8,Catalyst screening,"3.2 Catalyst screening The prepared catalysts were intensively studied for POM and. Fig. 10(a-d) illustrate the catalytic activity. All the catalysts were first allowed for activation for two hours before sampling and have shown a good conversion for POM. The average of three readings is taken to plot the results of catalytic activity. ZnO-NPr and nickel loaded ZnO-NPr first showed an increasing trend and later a gradual decrease in conversion was observed that is assumed due to the coking over catalyst. Comparatively, the decline in activity observed for ZnO-NPr and Ni loaded ZnO-NPr is likely due to the side reaction where methane may undergo a cracking process presented in Eq. 5 at high temperature [70]. That in turn may lead to the disposition of C on active sites and poisoning the catalyst that is no longer available for POM reaction to proceed. Another reason is during POM reaction while carbon is converting from one form to another form there is a possibility of elemental carbon deposition over the catalyst surface [19]. (5) C H 4 → 2 H 2 + C Δ H 298 K = 74.85 k J / m o l Co loaded ZnO-NPr, and Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr catalysts have shown a smooth and stable trend for CH4 conversion and H2/CO ratio. This increase in activity of Ni-Co/ZnO-NPr at high temperature in H2 and CO environment (products of POM) can be explained as both Co and Ni in such conditions remain in zero oxidation state (metallic form) [48]. Since metallic Ni sites facilitate the formation H2 while CO preferably interacts with Co thus leading to the simultaneous generation of POM products and activation of catalytic sites [71]. This synergistic relationship helps to deter the soot/coke formation and thus enhances the activity of Ni and Co co-deposited onto ZnO-NPr support as indicated in FTIR and Raman analysis [72]. In addition, the presence of oxidizing agents with varying oxidizing strengths, such as oxygen and CO2 in the environment, is also responsible for lower soot yield [73] resulting in an enhanced activity over a stable catalyst. In addition, the large size ZnO-NPr as observed in SEM analysis, promote metal support interaction onto the surface leaving the active phase fully exposed to catalytic reaction [61] that also activate the oxidation and prevent the catalyst from coking at high temperature [39,74]. Furthermore, at high-temperature reaction takes place on the metallic active sites for a short contact time [33,62] that improves CH4 conversion efficiency as well as stability of the catalyst at elevated temperature. All the trends for CH4 conversion (XCH4), selectivity of H2 (SH2), selectivity of CO (Sco) and H2/CO ratio under experimental conditions reaction temperature = 850 ℃ and flow rate CH4 = 20 mL min−1 O2 = 10 mL min−1 are shown in Fig. 10. Where 6 h average CH4 conversion (XCH4) for Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr is presented in Fig. 10 (a). was 98.23%. Fig. 10 (b), Fig. 10 (c) and Fig. 10 (d) illustrate the selectivity of H2, CO and H2/CO ratio. After activation of catalysts, all the catalysts have shown a stable trend and not much variation was noted. H2/CO ratio is also a crucial parameter in POM, H2/CO ratio of all the catalysts has shown a little higher value than the stoichiometric value, which is 2, an increasing trend for ZnO-NPr observed while a stable trend was followed by metal loaded ZnO-NPr. This infers that side reactions producing H2 Eq. 5. or conversion of CO to CO2 may also occur due to Boudouard reaction which can also cater carbon deposition [75,76]. The traces of CO2 (< 2%) is detected in the product stream as well. The average value of H2/CO for Ni-Co loaded catalyst is also slightly higher (2.11) than the theoretical value for POM. Furthermore, Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr was also investigated under different temperatures CH4 conversion ( Fig. 11(a)) tend to decrease proven in a previously conducted study [77]. Another reason of decreasing in the CH4 conversion, at low temperature is the existence of Ni and Co oxides, while above 750 °C it reduced to metallic form and consequently performed better against carbon deposition and activating CH4 at above 750 °C [48]. Similar behaviour was also observed for selectivity of H2 as shown in Fig. 11(b). and selectivity of CO shown in Fig. 11(c). A significant difference in activity above 750 °C noted can be explained as the oxides of dispersed metal Ni and Co are unstable at high temperature [75] particularly in H2 environment (H2 product of POM) that lead to the formation of their metallic forms [48]. Besides oxygen introduced in a controlled amount is used to produce CO further restricting the existence of Ni and Co as oxides form. H2/CO ratio is shown in Fig. 11(d) where a stable trend is noted for catalyst at 750 °C and 850 °C due to the absence of oxides resulting in defects within the catalyst [53,75]. While at 650 °C a continuously increasing trend is seen which is assumed due to the use of CO at this temperature [75] as observed in Fig. 11(c). Where selectivity of CO is showing a decreasing trend may explain the likely deposition of C on the active sites of the catalyst over the course of the reaction that deactivates the catalyst [19] and conversion of CO to CO2. Finally, the bimetal loaded catalyst was also studied for a 2-fold increase in flow rate and presented in Fig. 12(a-d). With the rise in flow rate, the conversion decreased to half of its conversion for 30 mL/min flow rate. Similarly, a decrease in the selectivity of H2 and CO was also observed. While H2/CO ratio remained around the theoretical value which is 2.0. It is ascribed to the lower retention time and interaction with active sites is not enough to complete the reaction. High flow rates inhibit the mass transfer limitations and assist the product targeted selectivity. However, the H2/CO ratio is not much influenced by higher flow rates as observed in Fig. 8(d). A slightly increasing trend for H2/CO ratio is noted in 6 h of TOS for 2-fold flow rate."
9,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability After investigation, the final catalyst was assessed for stability. The stability test was conducted under experimental conditions reaction temperature = 850 ℃ and flow rate CH4 = 20 mL min⁻1 O2 = 10 mL min⁻1 for more than 50 h. The stability results of catalysts are shown in Fig. 13 where the catalyst stayed stable during the TOS and no evidence of catalyst deactivation was observed. The average value of CH4 conversion (XCH4) remained as high as 98%, and H2/CO was 2.11 for this time of the stream. The improved stability of the most active catalyst is due to synergistic activation of catalytic sites in the environment of POM products where H2 produced keeps Ni and Co active sites in metallic forms onto the surface of support as indicated in SEM analysis [64] together with facilitation and effective usage of oxygen to form CO, thus leading to the high stability and inhibition of C deposition [78]. In addition, reducible oxides such as ZnO-NPr decorated with Ni-Co as indicated XRD and FTIR analysis, which can produce a better control of carbon deposition on metal support interface and continuous removal of deposited carbon consequently may enhance the conversion efficiency as well as stability [79]."
10,Characterization of spent catalyst,"3.4 Characterization of spent catalyst Regardless of the fact, no deviation was observed during stability testing a little coke formation was confirmed from the spent characterization. XRD pattern against the incident angle 2θ (10°-80°) for collected spent is illustrated in Fig. 14. The received pattern confirmed the presence of zincite crystal of ZnO along with the formation of coke. The high melting temperature of 1975 °C [57] for Zincite crystal is also responsible for catalyst stability. Along with the presence of diffraction peaks for zincite crystal with a small redshift, peaks at 2θ values 26.6° and 43.44° matches well with International Diffraction Data Card (PDF No. 26–1076; PDF No. 26–1083 respectively), confirmed the presence of the carbon. Peaks at 2θ values 26.6° and 43.44° indicate the reflection from the planes (006) and (103) respectively. In addition to the XRD pattern, spent was also characterized by SEM. SEM analysis of spent is shown in Fig. 15(a-b) and seen that rise in temperature broken down few of hexagonal ZnO-NPr. Most prisms are seen in their original shape but the increase of reaction time at a high temperature can change the shape of all the hexagonal ZnO-NPr. An EDS analysis was also carried out of a selected spectrum and presented in Fig. 15(c), coke formation onto the catalyst surface was observed in EDS analysis. The percentage of carbon by weight remained under 10% due to the prominent cobalt loading which limits the soot formation and resulted in improved stability of the catalyst [75]. Furthermore, spent confirmation is done by using Raman spectroscopy shown in Fig. 16(a) which demonstrates two main peaks at 1330 (cm−1) and 1580 (cm−1) confirming the occurrence of carbon. The peak at 1330 (cm−1) (D Band) confirmed the presence of disordered graphitic carbon [80,81] while the peak at 1580 (cm−1) (G Band) is an illustration linked to the ordered graphitic carbon. The thermal gravimetric analysis was also conducted for spent which is associated with the burnable carbon products and vapours formed during the catalytic activity shown in Fig. 16 (b). The mass loss for spent was observed 8% which can be due to the presence of vapours and burnable carbon products within the spent. After removal of burnable carbon and vapours that are mainly carried out till the temperature reaches 400 °C, a very small change in mass loss is observed with the further increase in temperature and the catalyst is assumed stable after once activated."
11,Conclusions,"The results revealed the successful hydrothermal growth of ZnO-NPr in a dual solvent. Single and bimetal loading by co-precipitation method was also confirmed by employing structural and morphological and elemental analysis techniques. The finding revealed the growth of zincite crystals in good agreement with the ZnO wurtzite phase. The growth of ZnO-NPr along the c-axis attributed to the presence of OH−1 ions, and partially filled cores due to the etching done by O⁻2 ions formed in a dual solvent. Hollow hexagonal ZnO-NPr possesses the large size confirmed in SEM analysis influenced the surface metal deposition resulting in the active phase fully exposed to catalytic reaction for high methane conversion. Further metal deposition on the surface of ZnO-NPr support give rise to defects on Zn interstitial can also enhance the catalytic activity. Among the single and bi-metal loaded ZnO-NPr, both Co and Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr were more active for POM in comparison to Ni loaded ZnO-NPr. Cobalt loading was prominent in bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr confirmed by XRD, EDS, Raman and FTIR analysis. Cobalt among the transition metals being more strong oxidizing agent than Ni, limits the soot formation and exposed active phases on the ZnO-NPr surface resulted in an enhanced conversion as well as a more stable catalyst for a longer run. Finally, among the tested catalyst, Ni-Co loaded ZnO-NPr showed the highest CH4 conversion (XCH4) of 98.11% and H2/CO ratio 2.11 followed by Co loaded ZnO-NPr and ZnO-NPr in comparison to Ni loaded ZnO-NPr which shown the low conversion efficiency and assumed to be more active for dry reforming of methane. Similar behaviour was also observed in a previously conducted study [38]. The proposed Co and bimetal loaded ZnO-NPr catalysts have the advantage of low cost and simple preparation method as well as high catalytic activity for syngas production. The results revealed that ZnO-NPr support and bimetal active sites prevent the soot formation resulting in an active and stable catalyst. These findings encourage further investigation of different morphologies of ZnO nanostructures for the facilitation of POM as well as other reforming techniques in a similar manner."
