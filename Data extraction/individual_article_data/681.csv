0,Introduction,"A sustainable development is calling for the advanced chemical processes with a low impact on the existing environmental issues. The catalytic conversion of renewable and abundant lignocellulosic sources to biofuels and fine chemicals has reached a worldwide consensus [1-3]. Recently, pentosane-derived furfural (FF) as a promising platform compound for lignocellulose has been intensively studied [4]. The diverse functional groups in FF can be selectively activated and thus the compound can be transformed to a series of downstream products with high values and wide applications in energy, flavor, pharmaceutical and polymer industries [5-8]. Notably, more than 65% of the global FF production is currently consumed to synthesize furfuryl alcohol (FA) that stands out as an important intermediate for manufacturing fibers, lubricants and resins [9,10]. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , hydrogenation of FF would undergo several reaction pathways and create a complicated network of products. Obviously, to obtain a high production of FA, the precise control of hydrogenation site and degree is believed to be the central science [11,12]. The over-hydrogenation and/or undesirable hydrogenolysis should be avoided. Thus selective reduction of the C = O bond in FF using atmospheric H2 as hydrogen donor with a rapid response is certainly an environment-friendly and cost-effective process [13-16], even though it remains greatly challenging. In industry an inexpensive Cu-Cr oxide catalyst is used to synthesize FA via hydrogenation of FF [17]. But very harsh reaction conditions (≥ 70 bar, ≥ 200 °C) are required and the emission of Cr-containing waste is toxic to water and soil. Cu is a cheap metal and abundant in the earth. Cu catalysts are well featured by the fair hydrogenation ability toward carbon-oxygen bonds [18-21]. In literature, only a few Cu-based catalysts enable to selectively hydrogenate FF to FA by using molecular H2 as the sole hydrogen donor [22,23]. Although a satisfying yield (≥ 90%) of FA can be obtained, the Cu-Fe and Cu-Co-Zn catalysts must work under pressurized H2 and high reaction temperature, i.e., 90 bar and 140 °C, 20 bar and 160 °C, respectively. It is clear that if the adsorption and dissociation of H2 were distinctly enhanced on Cu surface, it would be probably an effective way to compensate for the defects of Cu-Cr industrial catalyst. Moreover, the manufacture cost of a Cu catalyst can be lowered by eliminating extra metal components. However, monometallic Cu catalyst has been scarcely reported in literature to date. Previously, an attempt was carried out on a Cu/TiO2 catalyst which can offer 99% yield of FA at 125 °C but with assistance of pressurized H2 (10 bar) and microwave irradiation [24]. Apart from that, a Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was described to hydrogenate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran in the presence of 60 bar of H2 and alkaline additives [25]. In literature, experimental and computational investigations showed that the effect of Cu valence states was critical to control the activating kinetics of H2 on Cu surface [19,26]. Several studies concluded that Cu0 and Cu1+ species were essential and effective to adsorb and dissociate H2 molecule thus the hydrogenation reactions can be boosted [26-28]. These findings inspire us to try to create a vast amount of reactive Cu0 and Cu1+ sites in a Cu catalyst during the rational design and preparation. This is likely to break through the barricade for selective hydrogenation of FF to FA under ambient H2. It is well known that highly dispersed metallic active sites in heterogeneous catalyst can usually demonstrate superior catalytic performance [29-32]. The large surface area of a support material is believed to be able to promote the dispersion of active sites. Since Cu has a low thermal stability, it is generally dispersed on a porous support. Mesoporous silica is widely used as a carrier for preparing supported-metal catalyst, owing to the large surface area, unique spatial structure and high thermal stability. In fact, Co/SBA-15 [33], Co-Cu/SBA-15 [34] and Cu-Cs/MCM [35] were reported to catalyze hydrogenation of FF to FA. Notably, on the Cu-Cs/MCM catalyst FF was converted to FA at 170 °C via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) using formic acid as hydrogen donor [35]. Nonetheless, Co-Cu/SBA-15 catalyst need work at 150 °C and 20 bar H2 but with a complementary yield to FA from the CTH route [34]. Therefore, it is important for fundamental research and industrial application to explore a Cu catalyst that can activate and dissociate H2 at ambient pressure and low temperature for efficient hydrogenation of FF to FA. Herein, a Cu catalytic system that showed a major advance to the Cu-Cr industrial catalyst was reported in this work. MCM-41 immobilized Cu species allowed realizing the quantitative formation of FA via selective hydrogenation of FF at as low as 120 °C using 1 bar H2 as the sole hydrogen donor. The catalytic properties, particularly the role of different Cu species and the metal-support interaction were comprehensively analyzed by various advanced techniques. The structure-activity correlation was then elucidated, which allowed one to participate in the discussion on the active site modeling and the plausible reaction mechanism."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O (99%), MCM-41 (pure silicon), NaBH4 (98%), and PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, 98%, M.W. = 10,000) were used for catalyst preparation. FF (furfural, 99%), FA (furfuryl alcohol, 99%), i-PrOH (isopropanol, 99.9%) were used for catalytic reaction and quantitative analysis."
3,Preparation of Cu/MCM-41 catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of Cu/MCM-41 catalyst Cu/MCM-41 (Cu loading: 1−5 wt.%) catalysts were prepared by the PVP stabilized adsorption method. Typically a certain amount of PVP (W(PVP)/W(Cu) = 1.2) was dissolved by deionized water at room temperature. And then the Cu precursor was added and the solution was stirred (600 rpm) for 15 min. MCM-41 was subsequently introduced and stirred for another 15 min. After that a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (n(NaBH4)/n(Cu) = 5) was added drop by drop and stirred for 2 h. Afterwards the suspension was filtered and washed by an abundant deionized water (> 80 °C) to remove Na+, PVP and NO3 −. Finally the filter cake was dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The catalyst is named as xCu/MCM-41, where x presents the Cu loading."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA was carried out in a batch-type Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Typically 1 mmol of FF, 0.1 g of catalyst and 10 mL of i-PrOH were sealed in the reactor followed by removing the residual air by Ar flow and vacuum alternately for three times. Subsequently H2 was introduced till the pressure was stabilized at 1 bar. And then the reactor was placed in an oil bath pre-heated at 120 °C under magnetic agitation (900 rpm). And it can be confirmed that the external and internal diffusion limitations were excluded. After 4 h the reactor was immediately put into an ice bath to stop the reaction. The used catalyst was separated by centrifugation and completely washed by ethanol and water several times followed by drying at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h before the next use. The liquid reaction solution was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC: Thermo Scientific Trace 1310) equipped with TR-5 capillary column (length: 30 m, inner diameter: 0.32 mm, film: 0.25 µm) and FID detector. The external standard method was used to quantify conversion of FF and selectivity of products based on the following equations. Specifically FF and FA were calibrated based on the standard solutions at different concentrations. In addition, productivity and formation rate of FA during the initial reaction stage were also used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of an xCu/MCM-41 catalyst. CB (carbon balance) was also monitored for each reaction and the values were of 98−100% (the data were not reported), which indicated that the reported catalytic results can be reliable. Each reaction was repeated twice at least to guarantee a reproducible result, and the error of the data must be no more than 2%. (1) C o n v .

5,Characterization methods,"2.4 Characterization methods Cu loading was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on an Agilent 7500a apparatus. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Rigaku TTR III Diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a beam voltage of 40 kV. The patterns were recorded in a 2θ range of 1−10° (small angle) and 10−90° (wide angle) and with a screening speed of 0.02° s− 1. The textural property was investigated by N2 physisorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 Surface-Area and Porosimetry Analyzer and the data were analyzed using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Philips-FEI TECNAI F30 field emission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer. The profiles were recorded in a 5% H2/Ar (in volume, 30 mL min−1) mixed gas from 50−800 °C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1). Temperature programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer. Prior to desorption stage, the catalyst was treated at 300 °C with He flow (30 mL min−1) for 60 min and then cooled to 60 °C. Subsequently, a 5% H2/Ar (in volume, 30 mL min−1) mixed gas was introduced into the tube and maintained for 60 min. Then, He was switched in order to purge (60 min) the gas-phase H2 from the catalyst. Finally, the tube was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in He flow. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi apparatus equipped with Al Kα radiation under ultra-high vacuum. The binding energy shift caused by the surface charging was adjusted by a reference of C 1 s line at 284.6 eV. Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (DRIFT-IR) of CO adsorption was performed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet-iS50 FT-IR spectrometer with a MCT detector. The catalyst was first treated at 180 °C in a He flow (10 mL min−1) for 1 h and cooled down to 30 °C. Subsequently the background spectrum was recorded and then a pure CO (99.99%) flow (10 mL min−1) was introduced to the cell for 1 h. Afterwards a He flow was switched to purge the free CO molecules. (i) For the time-resolved DRIFT-IR spectra, the cell was continuously purged with He flow for 60 min; the spectrum was recorded at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively. (ii) The temperature-programed DRIFT-IR spectra were immediately recorded after experiment (i). The cell was heated to 180 °C with a gap of 30 °C and a stage for 3 min, and the spectrum was recorded at each temperature."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Composition, structure and morphology of the catalysts","3.1 Composition, structure and morphology of the catalysts ICP-MS shows the precise loading of Cu from the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts to be very close to the theoretical value (Table 1 ). This proves that Cu species up to 5 wt.% can be effectively immobilized by MCM-41 using the adsorption method. Fig. 1 displays the wide- and small-angle XRD patterns of xCu/MCM-41. All the catalysts show a broad peak centered at ca. 22° that can be assigned to the amorphous silica [36], being identical to that of the bare MCM-41 (Fig. 1A). Moreover, no Cu-related peaks can be observed for the 1−4Cu/MCM-41 catalysts. This can be probably attributed to the low loading and/or the high dispersion of Cu species on MCM-41. However, the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst begins to exhibit diffraction lines due to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Cu2O phase (JCPDS #34–1354) in a low intensity. In the range of small angle (Fig. 1B), the bare MCM-41 shows an intense diffraction peak at 2.2° and a weak one at 3.5−4.5°, which can be assigned to the characteristic Bragg reflections of the (100), (110) and (200) planes of mesoporous silica. These signals reflect the ordered hexagonal mesopores with long-range 2D hexagonal arrangement of uniform channels and p6mm space group symmetry for MCM-41 [37]. Notably, the (110) and (200) planes become hardly visualized while the (100) plane can be well remained on the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts but slightly shifts to a lower degree, after immobilizing Cu. This phenomenon may be related to the modification of MCM-41 structure by Cu species. To gain more information on that, the hexagonal unit cell parameters of the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts are calculated (Table 1), that is, the basal interplanar spacing value (d 100), lattice parameter (a 0) and pore wall thickness (δ). In comparison with MCM-41, the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts show a declining δ and a growing d 100 and a 0, with increasing the Cu loading. This implies that Cu species can be probably doped into silica, which results in altering the pristine porous structure of MCM-41. Following that, the textural property is investigated by N2 physisorption. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all the catalysts display a typical type-IV isotherm with an H1 hysteresis loop, being identical to that of MCM-41 [38]. This indicates an ordered mesoporous structure. Notably, a small number of micropores in MCM-41 become vanished after immobilization of Cu. The pore size distribution further confirms the presence of uniform mesopores in the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts (Fig. 2B). Compared to MCM-41 (818 m2 g− 1), the catalyst displays a gradually decreasing specific surface area (from 729 to 607 m2 g− 1, Table 1) with increasing the Cu loading. In addition, the pore volume is also found to decline whereas the pore diameter grows. These results clearly show that Cu species with an increasing loading can be highly dispersed on the surface of MCM-41, leading to an expansion of pore diameter and shrinkage of pore volume and surface area [38]. Hence these observations are consistent with XRD results. The morphology of the representative 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst is further inspected by TEM (Fig. 3 ). The ordered hexagonal arrays due to MCM-41 are well observed (Fig. 3a-b), which can be beneficial to the transportation of substrates during the catalytic reaction. Cu species are found to be highly dispersed on MCM-41 (Fig. 3b), and moreover, the lattice fringe (0.24 nm) measured by HR-TEM is the same as the data for Cu2O crystal (Fig. 3c) [28], in agreement with the XRD patterns. The mean particle size of Cu2O is estimated to be ca. 2.2 nm. It was previously reported that metallic Cu nanoparticles can be well dispersed on MCM-41 [39]. In this work, Cu2O nanoparticles smaller than the aperture of MCM-41 can be probably loaded on the external surface of and also dispersed on the internal surface of MCM-41 by penetrating the channels."
8,Analysis of Cu species and metal-support interaction,"3.2 Analysis of Cu species and metal-support interaction The interaction of Cu species with H2 is firstly analyzed by H2-TPR. An asymmetric reduction peak is recorded at 150−250 °C (Fig. 4 A), which can be resolved into peak-α (170−190 °C) and peak-β (190−220 °C). In literature, a Cu/SiO2 catalyst usually showed an intense reduction peak at ca. 200 °C followed by a small one at ca. 300 °C in H2-TPR profile, which was assigned to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide and bulk CuO on SiO2 [40], respectively. Thereby, the present reduction peaks can be attributed to the successive reduction of CuO → Cu2O → Cu [41]. Peak-β is observed to be the major reduction process. Notably, no peak above 250 °C is detected for the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts, which demonstrates that the reduction of copper oxide in this work is significantly promoted due to the superior dispersion of Cu species on MCM-41. Moreover, both reductions of Cu2+ and Cu1+ species shift gradually to a lower temperature with increasing the Cu loading. These results are indicative of a variable metal-support interaction in the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts. The quantitative analysis allows obtaining additional information on the distribution of different Cu species in the series catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4B, a linear relationship can be plotted between the total H2 consumption during TPR and the Cu loading, which implies that H2 is completely used to reduce the Cu species in the catalyst. Moreover, the H2 consumed by Cu1+ and Cu2+ species are also found linearly increasing versus the Cu loading, and the slope of Cu2O reduction is higher than that of CuO. This phenomenon indicates that a similar fraction of Cu1+ and Cu2+ species may be accumulated in the Cu catalysts by increasing the total metallic loading, and Cu2O is the major phase in the catalyst in consistence with XRD patterns. H2-TPD is then used to probe adsorption behavior of H2 on the Cu species. As reported in Fig. 5 , the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts show a desorption peak at low temperature range (ca. 80−200 °C). Notably, this peak cannot be detected on the bare MCM-41. Thereby, H2 desorption at ca. 110 °C can be originated from Cu species, which is usually ascribed to the chemisorbed hydrogen on Cu surface [42]. Meanwhile, several studies have attributed this low temperature peak to atomic hydrogen adsorbed on Cu surface [43]. Apparently, the desorbed H2 is proportional to the Cu loading. Moreover, desorption temperature gradually shifts to a lower value at a higher loading. These results disclose the adsorption and activation of H2 molecule on the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts at low temperature (i.e., in the range of reaction temperature), and H2 activation would be improved due to the metal-support interaction upon the Cu loading. The valence state of Cu is analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 6 A, on some typical xCu/MCM-41 catalysts the main peak of Cu 2p3/2 core level can be resolved into two peaks that can be attributed to the typical Cu0 and/or Cu1+ (B.E.: ca. 933.2 eV) and Cu2+ (B.E.: ca. 935.5 eV) species [44], respectively. Meanwhile, a satellite peak (B.E.: ca. 943.7 eV) due to the characteristic Cu2+ is observed and the intensity is in proportion to the main peak. It is well known that Cu0 and Cu1+ can be hardly distinguished by XPS technique. Thereby, the Cu LMM core level is further analyzed by AES spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 6B, three peaks can be well deconvoluted in the Auger spectrum, and the kinetic energies (K.E.) at ca. 913.0, 916.0 and 918.0 eV correspond to the characteristic Cu1+, Cu2+ and metallic Cu0 species [45], respectively. Therefore, the co-presence of different Cu species is confirmed on the catalyst surface. It is found by inspecting the B.E. and K.E. that the values slightly decrease by increasing the Cu loading (Table S1), which indicates the formation of electron-sufficient Cu species probably due to the strong metal-support interaction. Furthermore, the fraction of different Cu species can be calculated from TPR and XPS. In bulk of the series catalysts, the fraction of Cu0 (ca. 15%), Cu1+ (ca. 55%) and Cu2+ (ca. 30%) species can be approximately stabilized even though the Cu loading increases (Fig. S1a). This can be caused by the superior dispersion of Cu on MCM-41 due to the effective preparation method. However, on surface of the catalysts (Fig. S1b), Cu0 become the major species and its fraction gradually declines from 60% to 48%. In return, the fraction of Cu2+ species rises whereas that of Cu1+ is stabilized at 17%. Hence, a Cu0-rich surface can be created for the xCu/MCM-41 catalyst. Notably, Cu0 and Cu1+ species are always dominant. Si 2p core level shows a single peak at 103.7 eV identical to the typical Si−O−Si bond in MCM-41 (Fig. 6C) [46]. The O 1 s XPS spectra can be ascribed to two types of surface oxygen species, that is, O−Cu (BE: 931.0 eV) and O−Si (BE: ca. 532.4 eV) [46], respectively. To rationally disclose the role of different Cu species and MCM-41, the in situ DRIFT-IR of CO adsorption experiments are carried out. Fig. 7 A displays the dynamic adsorption spectra at 30 °C with the time of He purging for the series Cu catalysts. An intense band centered at ca. 3740 cm−1 is recorded on all the catalysts, which can be assigned to the isolated Si−OH group on MCM-41 [47]. After 1 min, two neighboring and intense CO adsorption bands are observed at 2050−2250 cm−1, which contains various forms of CO adsorption. The peak at ca. 2174 cm−1 can be attributed to the adsorption of dicarbonyl groups on Cu1+ sites, i.e., Cu+−(CO)2 [48]. While a shoulder peak at ca. 2157 cm−1 can be ascribed to the CO adsorption on Si−OH groups of silica [49]. The band centered at ca. 2123 cm−1 can be originated from the linearly adsorbed CO on Cu1+ sites, i.e., Cu+−CO [50]. Moreover, when Cu nanoparticles are highly dispersed on support, CO can be also adsorbed on Cu0 site at the same frequency to form a Cu0−CO group [48]. After 15 min, only the band at 2123 cm−1 is recorded and the intensity declines significantly. In literature, CO adsorption on Cu+ was found to be more stable than that on Cu0 [50], and thus CO can be easily purged from Cu0 sites in He flow. Notably, the peak intensity greatly reduces after 15 min. Therefore, a large number of Cu0 species is confirmed to disperse on the surface of catalyst, in agreement with XPS analysis. The peak at 2123 cm−1 can be entirely attributed to Cu+−CO group. After 30 min, this adsorption peak is well remained, which demonstrates a strong chemisorption of CO on Cu+ sites. Fig. 7B shows the in situ DRIFT-IR spectra of CO adsorption on the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst by subsequently increasing the cell temperature from 30 °C. A new and small shoulder peak (ca. 2145 cm−1) emerges at 60 °C, which can be assigned to the adsorbed CO on Si−OH groups [51]. In addition, the adsorption peak (2123 cm−1) due to Cu+−CO group is well recorded. In literature, CO adsorption on the electron-sufficient Cu+ sites can lead to a band at ca. 2110–2120 cm−1 [49], in consistence with our XPS results. In this work, both adsorption peaks can remain by rising the temperature to 180 °C. Notably, a red shift (3–10 cm−1) can be clearly observed for the main peaks of Cu0/Cu1+ with increasing Cu loading and adsorption temperature. This phenomenon may usually correspond to an enhanced activation of C = O bond on the metals and implies a strong metal-support interaction on the catalyst [52,53]. In short, the in situ DRIFT experiments disclose that Cu0 and Cu1+ sites are dominant on the outermost surface of the xCu/MCM-41 catalysts, and Cu1+ active sites are able to readily adsorb CO molecule that can be regarded as a model for the C = O bond in FF."
9,Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA,"3.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA Catalytic hydrogenation of FF is first investigated on some typical transition-metal catalysts (i.e., Fe, Co, Ni and Cu), and the metals with a loading of 2 wt.% are loaded on MCM-41. As reported in Fig. 8 a, the bare MCM-41 support cannot catalyze hydrogenation of FF. Fe and Ni catalysts are also found to be inactive, while Co/MCM-41 can only afford 11% conversion of FF. Obviously, Cu/MCM-41 shows a superior catalytic performance toward hydrogenation of FF, that is, 100% selectivity to FA is obtained at 90% conversion of FF. Thereafter, the effect of support on Cu catalyst is investigated by using different pure-silica supports as well as amorphous SiO2. Interestingly, only the MCM-41 supported Cu catalyst allows selectively converting FF to FA, but on other silica supports including SBA-15, Si-ZSM-5, MCM-48 and SiO2 FF can be only transformed to undesirable humus on Cu sites. Besides, the activity of Cu on those silica supports is restricted in a rather low range (≤ 28%). These results indicate that the spatial structures of different silica can be an important factor to adsorption and diffusion of reactants. Moreover, the valance state and distribution of Cu species are shown to significantly influence the hydrogenation catalysis. These features rely much on the catalyst support used and the metal-support interaction. Notably, FF is instable at high temperature and it is readily to dimerize to form oligomers even without a catalyst. Following that, the effect of Cu loading is analyzed and the time course experiments are carried out over the series xCu/MCM-41 catalysts (Fig. 9 a). Conversion of FF globally increases when the reaction proceeds. In the meantime, selectivity to FA is found to maintain 100% during the whole reaction. No other products can be detected on the basis of an excellent carbon balance (see experimental section). Therefore, Cu/MCM-41 is a highly selective catalyst for hydrogenation of FF to FA. With increasing the Cu loading, a catalyst can offer a higher conversion of FF at the same reaction time. For instance, the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst can reach a full conversion after only 3 h at 120 °C under 1 bar H2. Notably, a controlled experiment is conducted using the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst in inert gas (1 bar Ar) but not H2. In this circumstance, no activity is obtained. This result shows that molecular H2 is the sole hydrogen donor during hydrogenation of FF and Cu species are capable of effectively activating H2, as evident by H2-TPD. In order to compare the intrinsic activity of a series of Cu catalyst, the catalytic performance during the kinetic-controlled region, i.e., the linear dependence of conversion on time within 1 h, is further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 9b, the productivity of FA (in mole of FA produced per hour) can be linearly plotted against the Cu loading. The highest value is obtained when Cu loading is of 5. However, when the productivity is distributed by the content of Cu0 and Cu1+ species in the catalyst, the formation rate of FA (in mole of FA produced per mole of Cu0/1+ per hour) is found to be a constant value that does not vary when the Cu loading increases. By reporting the activity in this way, it is possible to extract the activity on a mole of Cu species, so that the activity of a Cu species in the different catalysts can be compared. The results demonstrate that one Cu species in the Cu/MCM-41 catalyst is able to convert the same amount of FF per hour whatever the Cu loading is, and moreover, the number of active sites can well respect to the Cu loading. Hence more active sites with the same activity can be generated in the catalyst with the growing of Cu loading. In fact, this is in very good agreement with the characterization results. In literature there are only a few reports on Cu-catalyzed hydrogenation of FF using H2 as hydrogen donor. Thus it is necessary to do a comparison study so that the catalytic activity and reaction conditions can be compared. As summarized in Table 2 , all the reported Cu-based catalysts can present a superior performance under their optimized conditions. A high conversion of FF (≥ 91%) and selectivity to FA (≥ 96%) can be obtained. However, on the Cu-Cr and Cu-Fe mixed oxide catalysts either selectivity to FA (96%) or conversion of FF (91%) is compromised, respectively. Furthermore, the formation rate of FA is calculated on the basis of active metals and reaction time, which can be used as a measure to deeply compare the catalytic activity. The present Cu/MCM-41 catalyst shows a high value of 6.5 gFA g− 1 Metal h− 1, and it is competitive among the best Cu-based catalysts reported in literature to date. Although the Cu-Co/Zn@NPC-600 and Cu/TiO2 catalysts may provide higher formation rates, very harsh reaction conditions are required. It can be clearly seen that the reaction temperature (max. 200 °C) and the H2 pressure (max. 90 bar) are much greater than the present catalytic system. Both parameters are well known to improve the catalytic activity for FF hydrogenation. In addition, the Cu/MCM-41 catalyst is also compared with mesoporous silica-supported transition-metal catalysts (Table S2). The Co/SBA-15, Co-Cu/SBA-15 and Cu-Cs/MCM catalysts can reach a high conversion of FF (≥ 91%) but selectivity to FA is unsatisfying, i.e., 80% over the Co-Cu/SBA-15 catalyst. Notably, these benchmark catalysts need follow the catalytic hydrogen transfer via solvents to complement the yield of FA, and the reaction conditions are still harsh. Obviously, the Cu/MCM-41 catalyst can work at very mild conditions and shows the best performance. It is the only one catalyst that can achieve 100% yield of FA using an atmospheric H2 at a lowest temperature. Moreover, no extra metal component except Cu is required by the catalyst. The stability and reusability of a heterogeneous catalyst is very important for its potential application and cost control. Thereby, the possible leaching of Cu component from the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst is verified using a hot-filtration process. As plotted in Fig. S2a, conversion of FF and selectivity of FA are found unchanged after the powdery catalyst is removed from the reactor at 1 h, and the liquid is continuously stirred at 120 °C in the presence of H2 for another 3 h. This result is indicative of no leaching of active Cu species from the catalyst into the reaction mixture. Afterwards, the post-reaction solution is directly analyzed by ICP-MS and the result confirms the stability of Cu species in MCM-41 supported catalyst. And then, the used 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst with an appropriate post-treatment (see experimental details) is evaluated in a consecutive recycling experiment and shows a considerable stability after five cycles under the regular reaction conditions (Fig. S2b). However, the catalytic activity may be already saturated when a full conversion of reactant is achieved. In this context, the stability is further verified within the kinetic-controlled region, because any deactivation of a catalyst can be easily observed during the initial reaction stage. As displayed in Fig. S2b, the 5Cu/MCM-41 catalyst also shows a considerable stability. Therefore, the present Cu/MCM-41 catalyst is found to be very stable and reusable."
10,Active site modeling and plausible reaction mechanism,"3.4 Active site modeling and plausible reaction mechanism Based on the characterizations and catalytic performances, the active site modeling and reaction mechanism can be discussed. As illustrated in Scheme 2 , Cu species as the active components are highly dispersed on MCM-41 that displays the ordered hexagonal mesopores with long-range 2D hexagonal arrangement of uniform channels and p6mm space group symmetry. Specifically, different Cu species including Cu0, Cu1+ and Cu2+ are confirmed to coexist on the external and internal surface of MCM-41. Notably, Cu0 and Cu1+ species are demonstrated as the catalytic active sites, which are dominant on the surface of the Cu/MCM-41 catalyst. The in situ DRIFT-IR characterizations reveal that the C = O bond in FF can well adsorb on Cu1+ species, as well as MCM-41. The controlled experiment confirms that molecular H2 is the only hydrogen donor for reduction of FF to FA. In addition, H2-TPD results suggest the adsorption and activation of H2 on the Cu surface. Recently, J. Lee et al. showed that Cu1+ sites can adsorb and dissociate molecular H2 and there was a low migration barrier for the dissociated H atom on Cu1+ sites, which resulted in a high activity for hydrogenation of FF [28]. In addition, Cu0 species are well accepted as the active site for H2 dissociation in hydrogenation reactions [26,27]. Moreover, B.M. Nagaraja et al. observed on a Cu-MgO catalyst that a higher proportion of Cu2+ species in catalyst would hinder the activity toward hydrogenation of FF in the presence of H2 [54]. In fact, the role of Cu0 and Cu1+ species on activating a C = O bond and H2 is still under debate. There are different opinions and the discussion is open. Two general mechanisms are accordingly proposed. In the first, the catalyst has only one active site, Cu0, on which H2 is activated, and the reactant is adsorbed through the C = O bond and cleaved. The second is a two site mechanism in which the Cu0 species activates H2 and the Cu1+ species adsorbs the C = O bond. In this work, the plausible reaction mechanism can be illustrated in Scheme 2. In the initial stage, FF can adsorb on the catalytic active sites of Cu1+ species. In the meantime, Cu0 and Cu1+ sites can also adsorb and activate H2 molecule. Notably, MCM-41 offers an abundant interface to the reaction, that is, reactants can freely contact the active sites on the external and internal surface. In fact, Y. Long et al. has simulated the size of FF molecule (6.6 Å × 4.9 Å × 1.6 Å) [55], which is smaller than the aperture of MCM-41. It is then followed by an actual surface reaction between the chemisorbed FF and dissociated H2, to produce FA that is still adsorbed on the active sites. The metal-support interaction between the sufficient and well-dispersed active Cu species and the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 can enhance the catalytic performance under mild conditions. In the final step, the produced FA is desorbed from the catalyst surface and the catalyst can be regenerated."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the quantitative formation of FA was achieved in atmospheric H2 at a low temperature of 120 °C from selective hydrogenation of FF using an inexpensive Cu catalyst. Copper species immobilized by MCM-41 allowed effectively activating FF and H2 molecules. The unique spatial structure and large surface area of MCM-41 were beneficial to diffusion and adsorption of FF. Moreover, the metal-support interaction can help stabilize a high proportion of Cu0 and Cu1+ active sites that were uniformly dispersed on the external and internal surface of the catalyst. Cu1+ species were shown to adsorb the C = O bond in FF, and moreover, Cu0 and Cu1+ active sites enabled to simultaneously adsorb and dissociate H2 molecule, thus greatly improving the hydrogenation performance. This finding may inspire the rational design of environmental-benign Cu catalytic system as cost-effective route to valorize furanic bio-platform compounds."
