0,Introduction,"Besides being a source of clean and environmentally friendly energy, hydrogen is also widely used for chemicals and electronic devices production, hydrogenated fats and oils in food industry, steel processing and desulfurization, and reformulation of gasoline in refineries. At present, over 95% of world's hydrogen demand is being derived from fossil fuels [1]. Fifty million tones of hydrogen are traded annually worldwide, and this is growing at a rate of 10% per year [2]. The problem is that the same amount of CO2 as is released as is formed in the combustion of fossil fuels. There are three ways to produce hydrogen biologically, with no external energy input required: biophotolysis, photo-fermentation, and dark-fermentation [3]. Among these, dark fermentation is considered the most promising. At 3–4 mol H2/mol glucose, the hydrogen yield is the highest of the three [4–6], and various types of organic wastes can be utilized [7,8]. However, few studies have been dedicated to describing the biological hydrogen production using cellulose. Because cellulose is particularly difficult to hydrolyze, its use is considered extremely limited [9]. In an anaerobic fermentation, the hydrogen production process is affected by such factors as pH, temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) [10]. While most of the studies on continuous dark hydrogen fermentation experiments have been conducted at 35–55 °C, there are no reports in the literature of such experiments carried out under hyper-thermophilic condition. However, hyper-thermophilic hydrogen fermentation has several advantages over mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation. These can be summarized as follows: 1) A high hydrogen production yield and rate is achieved. It has been reported that extreme-thermophilic anaerobic hydrogen fermentation can result in the production of more hydrogen production and higher hydrogen production rates than mesophilic hydrogen fermentation [11]. It also has been reported that at 70 °C, the hydrogen yield reaches the theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol glucose, where at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, the hydrogen yield is typically less than 2 mole hydrogen per mole glucose [12]. 2) Pathogens are reduced in the digested residues [13]. High temperature minimizes the contamination by hydrogen consumers such as methanogenic archaea; the hydrogen-producing reaction at high temperature is favorable, since the dark hydrogen fermentation become more energetic while the hydrogen utilization processes were negatively affected with temperature increase [14,15]. Studies on the microbial hydrogen production structure of mixed culture have been carried out in the mesophilic and thermophilic temperature ranges [16]. While a few studies have been focused on hyper-thermophilic ranges using pure culture [17,18], none have involved the use of mixed microflora. Therefore, the objective of this research was to improve hydrogen production from cellulose by hyper-thermophilic dark fermentation using mixed culture. Another aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term stability and the effect of temperature variation on the activity of cellulosic hydrogen producing bacteria."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental procedure,"2.1 Experimental procedure 2.1.1 Continuous experiment Continuous hydrogen production experiment was conducted in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The anaerobic mixed microflora was obtained from a sewage sludge digester at the Sendai municipal sewage treatment plant in Japan without pretreatment. The medium for dark H2 fermentation was constituted of the following (g/l): 10 Cellulose (Cellulose powder E, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd. Japan), 2 NH4HCO3, 3 NaHCO3, 0.1 K2HPO4, 0.1 KH2PO4, 0.01 NaCl, 0.015 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01 MgCl2·6H2O, 0.025 FeSO4·7H2O, 0.001 MnSO4·6H2O, 0.0005 CuSO4·5H2O, 0.002 CoCl2·5H2O, 0.0005 Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.001 ZnCl2 and 0.001 NiCl2·6H2O. The reactor was operated at 70 ± 1 °C by water circulating through water jacket and stirred at constant rates for over 8 months with an effective volume of 6 l and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 days (see Fig. 1 ). The pH in the reactor was adjusted in the begging at 5.5–6.0 by feeding NaOH (2 M) and HCl (2 M) solutions via glass syringe. The reactor pH was not controlled during fermentation process. 2.1.2 Activity test All batch-fermentation studies (Twenty six batch experiments) were performed in 120 ml serum bottles. Each bottle with a working volume of 80 ml was added 16 ml of inocula from running reactor to 64 ml of synthetic medium containing (amount are in gram per litter) 10 Cellulose (Cellulose powder E, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd. Japan), 2 NH4HCO3, 3 NaHCO3, 0.1 K2HPO4, 0.1 KH2PO4, 0.01 NaCl, 0.015 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01 MgCl2·6H2O, 0.025 FeSO4·7H2O, 0.001 MnSO4·6H2O, 0.0005 CuSO4·5H2O, 0.002 CoCl2·5H2O, 0.0005 Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.001 ZnCl2 and 0.001 NiCl2·6H2O. 1 mg resazurin; 40 ml reducing solution. The reducing solution contained 200 ml NaOH (0.2 M); 2.5 g Na2S·9H2O; 2.5 g cysteine HCl·H2O [19]. Resazurin was used as a redox indicator. The pH was adjusted in the begging at 5.5 by NaOH (2 M) and HCl (2 M) solutions. After inoculation, the bottles were flushed with pure nitrogen gas for a period of 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition. The serum bottles were placed in the water bath at 25–85 °C. The gas production was measured by glass syringe and composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. The metabolic by-products such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs), lactic acid and alcohols were also analyzed."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The percentage of H2 in the biogas was determined by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless steel column packed with a molecular sieve 5A (60/80 3 mmØ). The temperatures of the detector and the column were maintained at 100 °C and 60 °C, respectively. For the determination of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane content, the same model of gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 8A) was used, and it was equipped with a TCD and a stainless steel column packed with Porapak T was used. The temperatures of the detector and the column were maintained at 100 °C and 70 °C, respectively. The organic acids and ethanol were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-1700) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 30 m column (J&W DB-WAX). The volatile suspended solid (VSS), volatile solid (VS), protein and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured according to the procedures described in the Standard Methods [20]."
4,Microbial community structure analysis,"2.3 Microbial community structure analysis 2.3.1 Microorganism collection and DNA extraction Liquid samples were collected from the bioreactor under steady-state condition. The bacterial cells in 1 ml of sample were harvested in a tube by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 2 min). The cells were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer. DNA extraction was performed from samples using an Ultra Clean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.3.2 16S ribosomal RNA gene cloning analysis The microbial community was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing [21]. The amplification of 16S rDNA was performed with the primers EUB8F, 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ [22], and UNIV1500R, 5′-AGAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3′ [23]. Twenty five thermal cycles of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which consisted of 30 s of denaturing at 94 °C, 40 s of annealing at 50 °C and 1 min of extraction at 72 °C, were performed. The PCR products were purified by Micro Spin™ S-400 HR (Amersham Pharmacia GE, USA). The purified DNA was cloned with the TOPO TA Cloning® Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells. Cloned DNA fragments were obtained and spread on plates. After an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C, the white colonies were randomly picked out and transferred to LB medium with another 6 h of continuous incubation. The cell suspensions were used in a PCR reaction containing the M13F/M13R universal primers (M13F, 5′-CGCCAGG-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′; M13R, 5′-GAGCGGATAACA-ATTTCACACAGG-3′). Sequence reactions were carried out at TAKARA BIO dragon genomics center (Yokkaichi, Japan). Clone sequences were compared with the GenBank nucleotide database using BLAST microbial genomes searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [24] to determine their closest phylogenetic neighbors."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Continuous cellulosic-hydrogen fermentation,"3.1 Continuous cellulosic-hydrogen fermentation 3.1.1 Biogas and hydrogen production Over the 240 days of operation the daily variation in biogas production and hydrogen percentages were determined in the reactor, which was operated at 70 ± 1 °C (see Fig. 2 ). The anaerobic mixed culture was able to degrade the cellulose to hydrogen, acetate, butyrate and ethanol without hydrolysate pretreatment. After start up, both the hydrogen gas percentage and total biogas increased gradually. Since the original sludge was collected at thermophilic temperature 55 °C, the variation can be attributed to the adaptation of mixed microflora to the new temperature 70 °C. The average of biogas rate and hydrogen percentage during steady state condition was 0.47 l/l/day and 33.7% (v/v), respectively. The mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic mixed microflora (digested sludge) was able to generate hydrogen from cellulose without the need for pretreatment, as has been shown in earlier work [25–29]. Our results suggest that the anaerobic digested sludge is one of the important sources of cellulosic hydrogen bacteria, and that the operational condition were optimal. 3.1.2 Reactor performance and operational stability After three months of operation, the metabolic products were compatible under the steady-state conditions, and no accumulation of the end products in the system was observed [30]. Fig. 3 shows the variation in hydrogen yield, VFAs, VSS and pH at 8 months. The reactor performance was remarkably steady for 150 days with the hydrogen yield reaching 7.07 mmol H2/g cellulose (see Fig. 3(a)), higher than that reported for the mesophilic and thermophilic cellulose fermentation by mixed culture [25,28]. It was, however, lower than that reported for the mesophilic fermentation of Avicel hydrolysate [31] by Clostridium sp. suggesting that the hydrolysis pretreatment of cellulose is likely to result in a better economic performance. Our results suggested that the operation conditions, the temperature and pH and the microflora sources in particular, play an important role in enhancing the cellulose degradation to hydrogen. The pH in the reactor was maintained within an appropriate range of 5.3–5.7 throughout the experiment (see Fig. 3(d)) with sodium bicarbonate, which is considered a strong buffer when used with growth medium. Both the microbial community structure and the ability for substrate degradation can be expected to have been under the steady state condition. This conclusion can be drawn from the total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and volatile suspended solid (VSS) results, which were maintained at 1.95 and 4.11 g/l during steady state condition. 3.1.3 Soluble byproducts and cellulose degradation The VFAs and other soluble byproducts such as ethanol and lactic acid are useful for monitoring hydrogen production. The results of VFA composition indicated that acetate and butyrate are preferable in this process, with 0.97 and 0.83 g/l, respectively. Ethanol and propionate were detected in the liquid metabolites with 0.26 and 0.14 g/l, respectively (see Eq. (4)). The consumption of electrons in the production of ethanol, and the possible utilization of hydrogen in propionate formation makes both of these processes unfavorable to hydrogen production [32]. Hydrogen production is mainly produced with, acetate and butyrate production pathways, as indicated by Eqs. (1) and (2) [33,34], with a greater H2 yield when coupled with acetate rather than butyrate since the latter requires additional reducing equivalents. In case of H2 production associated with ethanol production, the mixed acetate–ethanol type fermentation can be described with Eq. (3). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 2 CO 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + C 4 H 8 O 2 + 2 CO 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + C 2 H 4 O 2 + C 2 H 5 OH + 2 CO 2 Therefore, the theoretical maximum H2 yield of 4 mol H2/mol hexose was achieved with the production of acetate, and reduced H2 yields were associated with butyrate and ethanol or shifts toward such production. The HBu/HAc (butyrate/acetate) ratio has frequently been used as the indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of hydrogen production [35,36]. (4) ( C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n → 1.2 ( H 2 ) n + 0.29 ( C 2 H 4 O ) n + 0.17 ( C 2 H 8 O 2 ) n + 0.1 ( C 2 H 6 O ) n + 0.03 ( C 3 H 6 O 2 ) n Our results show that the butyrate/acetate ratio was 0.57, indicating the main product of the metabolites was acetate and the corresponding hydrogen production yields increased. It has been proposed that acetate, butyrate and ethanol–acetate type fermentation occurs not only due to microbial structure, but to the operational conditions and organic nitrogen amendments as well [37,38]. The results showed that 64.9% of the influent cellulose was degraded into 1.2 mol H2/mole hexose (see Eq. (4)). Thus, the maximum H2 yield at pH 5.5 in this study was just 30% of the theoretical value. This level of efficiency was substantially higher than the 18% reported for the degradation of cellulose by mixed culture at 55 °C [29]. Our results suggest that hyper-thermophilic bacteria play an important role in increasing the effectiveness of cellulose degradation to hydrogen energy. 3.1.4 The structure of the microbial communities The microbial community structures during the steady state were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing in the CSTR. The cloning results show that a total of 6 OTUs were detected from a total 100 clones. Eighty five clones of cellulose-degrading mixed culture were composed of microbes closely affiliated to genus Clostridium. The dominant cellulolytic bacterium was Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum. This explains the ability of this microbial community to degrade cellulose effectively to hydrogen gas. These results supported the data in the literature: the T. thermosaccharolyticum generates hydrogen from cellulose effectively because it has β-glucosidase, which is an important enzyme in the cellulase enzyme system. It also plays an important role in hydrolyzing cellobiose to fermentable glucose. The purified β-glucosidase enzyme is reported to be stable over a pH range of 5.2–7.6, had a 1 h half life at 68 °C, and its optimal activity is at pH 6.4 and 70 °C [39]. This explains why the optimal temperatures range was 60–70 °C when using such mixed microflora. Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis was detected with a 10% abundance in the microbial community structure. This organism had a unique combination of hydrogenases, a ferredoxin-dependent [NiFe] hydrogenase and an NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase for H2 formation [40]. Additionally, T. tengcongensis growth occurred at temperatures between 50 and 80 °C, with an optimum around 75 °C; at pH values between 5.5 and 9.0 [18]. The ethanol produced during cellulose fermentation could be attributable to a group of anaerobic bacteria known as Acetobacterium and several Clostridia such as Moorella sp., which can grow autotrophically on H2 and CO2 with acetate production by the acetyl-CoA pathway. In fact, Moorella thermoacetica was detected in the microbial community with 99% similarity and 10% abundance. This behavior of Moorella sp. has been confirmed by different reports where, when, isolated from a mud sample, it produced acetate and ethanol from H2 and CO2 at a thermophilic temperature at pH 5 [41]. Our cloning results show also the genus Enterobacter could grow at these conditions and that hydrogen was generated from cellulose hydrolysate. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4 illustrates that five OTUs were affiliated with the family Thermoanaerobacteriaceae, which belongs to order Thermoanaerobacteriales of class Clostridia. The five OTUs form a cluster with 90% bootstrap value with the three known species of Thermoanaerobacterium and Moorella. The OTU-D_A11, OUT-C_G11 and OUT-C_E07 have 98% similarity with T. thermosaccharolyticum and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum. The optimum growth for all Thermoanaerobacterium species was reported at 55–70 °C and at pH values of 5.2–7.8 [38]. Several species of Thermoanaerobacterium, including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. saccharolyticum, Enterobacter sp., are known of their H2 producing capabilities (see Table 1 ) and ability to degrade cellulose."
7,Effect of temperature on the cellulosic-hydrogen bacteria,"3.2 Effect of temperature on the cellulosic-hydrogen bacteria 3.2.1 Activity of cellulosic-hydrogen bacteria Twenty six batch experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of temperature on the activity of hyper-thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria to utilize microcrystalline cellulose and glucose into hydrogen gas (see Fig. 5 ). The results show that the anaerobic mixed microflora was able to utilize the cellulose and glucose within a wide range of fermentation temperatures (45–80 °C). This may explain because the characteristics of the microbial community structure in this study. Ren et al. (2008) demonstrated that the T. thermosaccharolyticum is able to utilize cellulose and produce hydrogen over a wide range of temperature, from 30 to 70 °C and a pH ranged of 4–7.5 [17]. The ability of cellulosic bacteria to generate hydrogen at 75 and 80 °C may be due to T. tengcongensis. This bacterium grows within a temperature range of 50–80 °C and is able to generate hydrogen from the cellobiose which obtained by the partial hydrolysis of cellulose and other different carbohydrates [18,41]. When cellulose was used as the carbon source, activity was lower than when glucose was used at all tested temperatures. Because cellulose is particularly difficult to hydrolyze, its use is considered extremely limited [9]. Furthermore, a co-culture of T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. tengcongensis and Enterobacter in this system may have enhanced hydrogen production. This has already been shown in a mixed culture of Clostridium thermocellum JN4 and T. saccharolyticum GD17 [44] and C. thermocellum and Clostridium thermopalmarium [46]. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature on the hydrogen production The effect of temperature variation on the efficiency of the fermentative conversion of cellulose and glucose into H2 energy was examined using hyper-thermophilic anaerobic cellulosic bacteria (see Figs. 6 and 7 ). The best H2 production (obtained at 65 °C) was approximately 734.4 and 921.9 ml/l by using cellulose and glucose respectively. Nguyen et al., (2008) reported that the hydrogen production was 39.8 and 49.7 ml/l under hyper-thermophilic temperature when pure strains of Thermotoga maritima and Thermotoga neapolitana were employed, respectively [45]. On the other hand, Geng et al. (2010) reported that the hydrogen production increased greatly with the addition of non-cellulolytic, hydrogen-producing bacterium (C. thermopalmarium) to the monoculture of cellulolytic, hydrogen-producing bacterium (C. thermocellum) under thermophilic temperature [46]. Our microbial community analysis suggests that the T. tengcongensis and Enterobacter asburiae may be improved hydrogen generation by the co-culture effect. It follows then that as a low-cost performance system, our system is suitable to future large-scale applications. 3.2.3 Liquid byproduct During cellulose fermentation, acetate and butyrate were the main byproducts in the liquid phase at all fermentation temperatures (see Figs. 8 and 9 ). In this study, VFA was shown to be temperature-dependent. The maximum concentration of acetate and butyrate were increased by temperature in cellulose fermentation was 1.4 and 0.86 g/l, respectively at 65 °C. However, the concentrations of both decreased as the fermentation temperature increased. While the same trend was observed using glucose was used, the results help to clarify the effect of temperature on hyper-thermophilic bacteria. By using glucose as sole of carbon source, the butyrate/acetate ratio ranged between 0.55 and 0.60 when the fermentation temperature was in the rage of 55–75 °C; however, it increased in the other fermentation temperatures due to the microbial community characterization. In case of cellulose, the ratio was 0.64 and 0.65 at 65 and 55 °C, respectively. However, the butyric acid production was preferable in the other fermentation temperatures. These results indicate that in the 55–70 °C temperature range, more acetate is formed than at other fermentation temperatures, and the corresponding hydrogen production yields was higher. 3.2.4 Thermodynamic analysis The temperature is the most important key factor for bacterial growth. The reaction rate in chemical processes increases with temperature. This can be adapted to microbiological processes in limited temperature ranges. In most models, the effect of temperature on anaerobic digestion is measured by the Arrhenius equation [47,48]. Thermodynamic studies of hydrogen fermentation using mixed microflora are rarely in the literature [48]. The Arrhenius equation could effectively describe the relationships between temperature and H2 production. The hydrogen production rate (HPR) values obtained are utilized to estimate the thermodynamic parameters of hydrogen production from cellulose. According to the Arrhenius equation, the relationship between bio-reaction rate (r) and temperature is as follows: (5) r = A · Exp ( − E a / R · T ) where A is a constant, E a is activation energy (kJ/mol), R is ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K) and T is the absolute temperature (K). When r is substituting r with HPR into Eq. (1), the activation energy is estimated using regression (R 2, 0.93 and 0.94) to be 133.2 and 117.7 kJ/mol for cellulose and glucose, respectively. Since this activation energy is higher than the hydrogen production from glucose 107.66 kJ/mol [48], it can be concluded that more energy is consumed by hydrogen production from cellulose than from glucose."
8,Conclusion,"In this study, long term continuous hydrogen production from cellulose at the hyper-thermophilic temperature (70 °C) was successfully obtained using anaerobic mixed microflora (digested sludge). A hydrogen yield of 7.07 mmol H2/g cellulose was maintained for 150 days with acetate, butyrate, ethanol and propionate as main soluble byproducts. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences showed that the cellulosic hydrogen bacteria were close to Thermoanaerobacterium genus. The cellulose-degrading mixed culture was able to utilize the cellulose or glucose within a wide range of fermentation temperature (45–80 °C) to produce hydrogen along with temperature-dependent VFA. The activation energy estimated using regression (R 2, 0.93 and 0.94) was 133.2 and 117.7 kJ/mol for cellulose and glucose, respectively. Since cellulose degradation was improved and the pathogens in the fermented residues were reduced, this system is considered to have a good economic performance, and therefore has potential for future large-scale applications."
