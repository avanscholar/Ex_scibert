0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is a basic feedstock. Nowadays, the total H2 consumption in industries is about 60 million ton per year, in which 44% contributes to oil refining industry, 38% is used in ammonia production, and the remained is for other chemical processes. Hydrogen is also considered as a promising clean fuel in energy system with growing global demand [1]. However, H2 molecule does not exist in nature, and hydrogen element is always in the compound form attached with other elements [2]. Currently, natural gas is the most common source to produce commercial H2 through steam reforming process, occupying 48% of the global demand [3]. However, as a fossil fuel, the steam reforming of natural gas also generates a significant amount of carbon dioxide which has an adverse impact on environment. Therefore, there is growing interest in finding alternative renewable sources for H2 production [4]. Biomass is an attractive and promising renewable resource for H2 production. Two major ways, i.e., thermochemical and biological ways, can be applied to realize biomass to hydrogen. While, any biomass can be used for the H2 production by thermochemical way, only those biomass with high starch or sugar content are more suitable as the feedstock for the biological one [5]. Steam biomass gasification is considered as the most effective thermochemical process for the H2 production that can produce 53–55 vol% of H2 whereas air gasification can only produce 8–10 vol% of H2. However, the steam gasification is an endothermic process that requires energy, while the air gasification can generate heat since it is an exothermic reaction. Thus, the air and steam mixture as the gasifying agent for the gasification of biomass is mostly applied to achieve better thermodynamic efficiency even though it can only produce 25–30 vol% of H2 [6,7]. A large amount of bio-oil (also called as tar), which is a mixture of various condensable oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds derived from biomass decomposition together with biochar and other non-condensable gases, is generally generated during the gasification of biomass. It will cause clogging of the pipe line of gasification installation and increase the failure operation. One of the solutions to remove or decrease tar amount is to combine the gasification with steam reforming process, and simultaneously using water gas shift reaction to obtain more H2 [8]. Cogeneration, trigeneration, and polygeneration have been proposed to increase the efficiency of the whole biomass conversion system. Meanwhile, by using such integrating processes, several products can be coproduced [9]. In general, the hybrid process combining two or more processes could fully utilize the feedstock of the system to generate single or multiple products simultaneously with improved efficiency, which can also increase product yields while decrease wastes or by-products. A hybrid process composed of the pyrolysis combined with the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil and separate gasification of biochar was proposed as a potential and promising method for the small-scale power generation from biomass without facing tar problems in gasifier [10]. It is reported that nickel (Ni)-based catalysts can be used to obtain syngas with high H2/CO from bio-oil through the steam reforming reaction and combined with additional water–gas shift reaction, H2 production can be increased more [11,12], while biochar gasification produces cleaner syngas with higher efficiency. In addition to the conventional thermochemical process, another concept called chemical looping is also known as a promising way for H2 production from solid fuels such as coal, biomass, and biochar. This method can effectively use carbonaceous materials as the reducing agent with a redox loop of metal oxide as the oxygen carrier and steam as oxidizer and hydrogen source. Especially, it can produce pure H2 with other gases such as CO and CO2 separately obtained from biomass decomposition by coupling several reactors without using any additional gas treatment and separation processes [13,14]. Nevertheless, there are limitations in the exploration of chemical looping process using solid fuels as reducing agents. For example, they always have low reactivity with the oxygen carriers due to the low solid–solid contact efficiency in short residence time inside the reactor. Moreover, the selection of an oxygen carrier with suitable properties such as high catalytic and mechanical stability at high temperature and the resistance ability against carbon deposition at high pressure is the key issue in the chemical looping process [15]. The more common way for chemical looping application is production of the syngas from biomass/coal gasification or natural gas/methane [16–18]. Recently, the work of Li et al. [14] and Zeng et al. [19] showed the promising possibility of direct utilization of solid fuels as the reducing agent in chemical looping process. Thus, it should be more interesting by using solid carbon resources as the feedstock in a practical chemical looping process. In this study, a novel system combining the pyrolysis of biomass and catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil with a chemical looping process using the generated biochar from biomass pyrolysis as the reducing agent was proposed and simulated for the H2 production from biomass. The hybrid system was designed for the full utilization of products from biomass pyrolysis to produce single H2 product. Based on the evaluation of mass and energy balances in the overall system, the optimized self-supported energy circulation was achieved. The effects of operating parameters including the steam to carbon ratio for catalytic steam bio-oil reforming and temperatures in the reducing reactor and the steam reactor of the chemical looping unit on the performance of the overall system were investigated. It is expected to obtain a new way for the effective production of H2 from biomass."
1,Methodology,
2,Process description,"2.1 Process description Fig. 1 describes the schematic diagram of the proposed novel system for H2 production from biomass including the biomass pyrolysis, catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil, and chemical looping unit using biochar from the biomass pyrolysis as the reducing agent. Herein, woody biomass is chosen as the model biomass feedstock for the system since it is the most promising resource among various biomass. It is found that various woody biomass have almost the similar properties Therefore, apple tree branch is chosen as the model woody biomass with intrinsic characteristics as shown in Table 1 [20], where the high heating value (HHV) was calculated with the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) method [21]. In the system, the biomass is introduced into the biomass pyrolysis reactor at first. After the pyrolysis, the generated biochar and the gaseous products including bio-oil are separated. The bio-oil is catalytically reformed by steam to form syngas whereas the biochar is introduced into the reducing reactor (RR) of the chemical looping unit, which also includes other two coupling reactors, i.e., a steam reactor (SR), and an air reactor (AR), integrated with each other, for the H2 production. The syngas generated from the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil is used for heating biomass pyrolysis process before compressed and entering a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to obtain the purified H2 product. The tail gas from the PSA system is firstly dried and then burned in the furnace. The exhaust gas from combustion chamber is used to generate steam and provide heat for the steam reforming reaction. 2.1.1 Biomass pyrolysis Pyrolysis is one of the thermochemical processes to decompose biomass in the absence of oxygen at a temperature range from 350 to 700 °C, by which biochar, bio-oil (in gas state at the pyrolysis temperature), and non-condensable gases such as CO, CO2, CH4, and H2 are generated together from biomass. Biomass pyrolysis can be categorized into two different processes, i.e., slow and fast pyrolysis based on the heating rate. The slow pyrolysis always generates much more biochar from biomass whereas the fast pyrolysis will produce more bio-oil [22]. Various reactors have been developed for the fast pyrolysis of biomass, which include the fluidized bed reactor, recirculating bed reactor, ablative reactor, and cone reactor. Among them, the fluidized bed reactor is the most favorable and commercially available one for the bio-oil production, by which the tar yield can reach about 70–75%. On the other hand, the fixed bed reactor is the most widely used one for biochar production. In addition, the auger or screw type reactor is one pyrolysis reactor which can produce both biochar and bio-oil with the yields between those from the fluidized bed reactor and the fixed bed reactor. This type of reactor gains popularity recently because it has a simple design, is easy to operate, requires only a small amount of carrier gas, and consumes less energy. The result of pyrolysis process is mainly dependent on the amount of feedstock processed at the specific temperature within certain residence time of reaction. The main advantage of auger type reactor is that the residence time can be controlled by tuning the rotation speed of the screw inside the reactor [23]. In the present study, the auger type reactor is chosen for the biomass pyrolysis at 500 °C. Flow and temperature controllers are applied in the input and inside of pyrolyzer, respectively, to ensure the biomass pyrolysis process occurring at a stable condition during the simulation. 2.1.2 Catalytic steam bio-oil reforming, H2 separation, and heat circulation units Bio-oil is a condensable product of biomass pyrolysis, which contains various hydrocarbons such as alcohol, ketones, acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). It is difficult to use it as a fuel directly due to its low heat value, high viscosity, and corrosive. Steam reforming is considered as the most effective process to produce hydrogen. Methane or natural gas is the most common feedstock for hydrogen production through the steam reforming process [24]. Steam reforming of bio-oil is also considered as the most effective and promising route to convert it to H2 or syngas for clean applications [25]. It is found that CO produced during this process can further react with excess steam by water–gas shift reaction to produce more H2 as follows [11,26]: (1) C x H y O z + x - z H 2 O → x C O + [ y / 2 + x - z ] H 2 (2) C O + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 Theoretically, about 6 kg of H2 can be obtained from 100 kg of woody biomass via the biomass pyrolysis process combined with the steam reforming of bio-oil. It is reported that the commercial Ni-based catalysts has good activity for the steam reforming of bio-oil and the deactivated catalysts can be also easily regenerated for the reuse [27]. In this study, the simulation on the steam reforming of bio-oil was based on the operation temperature of 850 °C with a pressure of 1 bar and a steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 6 since the bio-oil conversion was as high as 95% over the Ni-based catalysts at this condition [28]. PSA is a common separation technology with low cost to obtain H2 with purity over than 99.99% from the syngas produced from the steam reforming process [29]. In the PSA separation process, the adsorption occurs at a high pressure whereas the desorption performs at atmospheric pressure. Adsorption pressure is usually in the range of 7–35 bar, depending on the pressure of the gas entering the PSA unit [30,31]. Separation process in PSA normally occurs at atmospheric temperature. PSA with elevated temperature of 200–450 °C can be applied for certain condition that allowing the feed gas entering PSA without pre-cooling and achieve higher H2 recovery [32]. However, in this study, the hot syngas is considered to be used to heat biomass pyrolysis process. Thus, the separation at a low temperature is selected. Moreover, as shown in Table 2 , PSA separation with a feed pressure of 7 bar can obtain high purity H2 with average recovery about 70.8% [30,31,33–35]. Consequently, the PSA separation operated at 7 bar and 35 °C to achieve H2 purity of 99.5% and recovery efficiency of 70.8% is then selected. Before entering the PSA separation unit, firstly the water in the syngas is partly separated in flash drum. Then, the syngas is pressurized to 7 bar, which will result in a temperature increase. Then, the compressed syngas is cooled down to the operating temperature of the PSA while pre-heat the water for steam generation. The tail gas from PSA separation still has heating value that can be utilized further. Herein, the tail gas is firstly dried and then burned out in the boiler adiabatically and used to generate steam and heat for the reforming reactor with thermal insulation and the cooled flue gas is then vented out. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the above-stated system with biomass pyrolysis, steam bio-oil reforming, and heat circulation units. Temperature control is also essential in heat circulation in order to make the syngas enter PSA process at a proper temperature while it provides the heat for biomass pyrolysis. The heat supply for the steam reforming also should be controlled by monitoring the combustion of the tail gas. 2.1.3 Chemical looping system for H2 production from biochar The chemical looping unit can use carbonaceous materials as the reducing agent in the redox cycle of a solid oxygen carrier for the H2 production. Herein, the solid oxygen carrier provides oxygen source to replace the “gasifying agent” normally supplied by air or cryogenic separation of air in a gasification system. Meanwhile, the oxygen carrier also works as heat carrier and/or catalyst in this unit. The main advantage of the chemical looping unit for H2 production (CLH) is that it can generate pure H2 with only a simple separation process. As shown in Fig. 3 , the CLH used in this study has three coupling reactors of RR, SR and AR. In the RR, the oxygen carrier is reduced by the biochar with the generation of CO2 and H2O at first. Then, the reduced oxygen carrier enters the SR and is partly oxidized by steam to produce H2. Thereafter, the partly oxidized oxygen carrier is moved into the AR and completely oxidized by air and finally the completely oxidized oxygen carrier is circulated back to the RR for the next reducing cycle. Since iron oxide is the most common compound applied in the CLH for the H2 production [15,36], it is also used as the oxygen carrier in this study. Herein, the main reactions occur in the RR are expressed as Eqs. (3) to (8), in the SR as Eqs. (9) and (10), and in the AR as Eq. (11), respectively [15,37,38]. (3) F e 2 O 3 + 1 / 2 C → 2 F e O + 1 / 2 C O 2 (4) F e 2 O 3 + C O → 2 F e O + C O 2 (5) F e 2 O 3 + 3 / 2 C → 2 F e + 3 / 2 C O 2 (6) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (7) F e 2 O 3 + H 2 → 2 F e O + H 2 O (8) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e O + 3 H 2 O (9) 3 F e + 4 H 2 O → F e 3 O 4 + 4 H 2 (10) 3 F e O + H 2 O → F e 3 O 4 + H 2 (11) 2 F e 3 O 4 + 1 / 2 O 2 → 2 F e 2 O 3 Moreover, during the simulation, the RR is assumed to be operated at 10 bar and 900 °C, where the iron ore Fe2O3 is reduced into a mixture of FeO and Fe. The SR operated at 10 bar and 700 °C is used to convert steam into H2, where the FeO and Fe are partially oxidized to Fe3O4. Then, Fe3O4 is flowed into the AR and completely oxidized with stoichiometric air back to Fe2O3 at 10 bar and 1200 °C. Each produced gas flow from each reactor is considered to be expanded from 10 to 1 bar for the power generation, which provides the power for the compressors, pumps, and others. The remaining heat contained in the gases is absorbed by water to generate steam, which is introduced into the SR. In addition, the water contained in the produced gas from the SR is separated from the H2 and reused as the steam in the SR. It is essential to control and monitor the temperature of the steam produced in heat recovery steam generation (HRSG) unit since it is the key to hold heat circulation within CLH process in order to achieve the auto-thermal state."
3,Process simulation,"2.2 Process simulation Aspen PlusTM software (9.0 version; Aspen Technology Inc.) is used to simulate the process at a steady state condition using IDEAL as the base method. The feeding rate of woody biomass (i.e., apple tree branch in this study) is assumed to be 100 kg/h. Iron species including Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, and Fe are considered to be existed in the chemical looping unit. All the reactors are assumed to be operated at an isobaric condition and all the processes have no pressure drops and no accumulation occurred. The biomass pyrolysis process is simulated by integrating RYield reactor for biomass decomposition and a series of separators to separate the volatiles and biochar parts. REquil and RGibbs are used to generate gases from a partial proportion of the volatiles. The volatiles and biochar parts are presented as the composition of C, H, N, S, O, and H2O, while the produced gases are assumed to be CO, CO2, CH4, and H2. The model for simulating pyrolysis process is modified from the model developed by Kabir et al. [39], which is shown in Fig. 4 . In our previous work [20], the results from the pyrolysis of woody biomass were successfully predicted by using the empiric equations developed by Neves et al. [40], which are also used as the basic reference in this simulation. The steam reforming of bio-oil is simulated using the single RGibbs reactor and assumed to reach the equilibrium. The PSA process is simulated by using the separator block to separate CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O from H2. The RR and SR in the chemical looping unit are assumed to be operated as the counter current moving bed reactor to achieve high conversions. As such, an interconnected series of multiple RGibbs reactors (5 stages) are used to simulate the moving reactor following the model developed by Li et al. [14] and Zeng et al. [19]. For the simulation of RR, the oxygen carrier particle is considered to be dropped from the top side (1st stage) and the biochar is introduced into the middle part of the reactor (4th stage). A small amount of steam is introduced from the bottom side (5th stage) as the promoter and carrier gas for the produced gas to move upward, which also helps to increase the pressure inside the reactor. The S/C ratio used is 8% of carbon content in biochar introduced to the reactor. The ash and reduced oxygen carrier are discharged from the reactor from the 5th stage whereas the produced gas is moved out from the 1st stage. The complete conversion of biochar is assumed to be achieved in the RR where only CO2 and H2O are produced. The SR is simulated using the similar method as that for the RR, in which the oxygen carrier is dropped from the 1st stage, the steam is introduced from the 5th stage, the partially oxidized oxygen carrier is discharged from the 5th stage and the produced gas is discharged from the 1st stage. The AR is modeled as the single RGibbs reactor for combustion, in which the air is compressed to 10 bar before introduced into it. In this study, the minimum amount of Fe2O3 required for the CLH unit is firstly simulated to achieve the lowest generation amounts of CO and H2 in the exhaust gas from the RR. Then, about 51% of excess Fe2O3 is added as the heat carrier to make the CLH unit is in auto-thermal state. All key assumptions used for the operating conditions and blocks used for each process in this simulation are summarized in Table 3 . The detailed information and assumptions for every blocks used in the simulation, including the detailed description for biomass pyrolysis shown in Fig. 4 are described in Table S-1."
4,Performance indicators for evaluation,"2.3 Performance indicators for evaluation The performance of this novel system is evaluated by the total H2 production, H2 production efficiency, and power generation as follows: (12) Total H 2 = H 2-STR + H 2-CLH (13) H 2 p r o d u c t i o n e f f i c i e n c y = T o t al H 2 ( k g / h ) M a s s o f f e e d ( k g / h ) × 100 % (14) net power = ∑ W exp - ∑ W cp - ∑ W pump where H2-STR and H2-CLH are H2 produced by the steam reforming of bio-oil and CLH units, respectively; Wexp, Wcp, and Wpump are the work generated by the expanders and the works required by the compressors/blower and pumps, respectively. The H2 production efficiency describes as the total amount of H2 produced from a certain amount of feedstock, which can indicate the effectiveness of the system. The effects of changing parameters such as S/C ratio in the bio-oil reforming of bio-oil process and temperatures at RR and SR on these indicators are also considered."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of S/C ratio,"3.1 Effect of S/C ratio The S/C ratio in the steam reforming reaction is one of the key parameters. The increase in S/C ratio will lower the CO/H2 ratio in the produced gas at certain temperatures. Moreover, the increase in S/C ratio will increase the conversion and reduce the carbon (coke) formation. For the bio-oil reforming, it is reported that the S/C ratio of around 4 on weight or 6–8 on moles corresponds to high conversion as well as high CO/H2 ratio in the produced gas [41]. Table 4 summarizes the experimental results regarding to the steam reforming of bio-oil with different temperatures, S/C ratios, and reactor types [28,42–46]. Herein, the S/C ratio in the range of 5.8–9 at 850 °C using a commercial Ni-based catalyst (C11-NK from Sud Chemie) was found to achieve about 95% conversion of bio-oil to syngas. Lower S/C also can achieve the similar reaction conversion, however, the catalysts used have not been proven commercially. Fig. 5 shows the effect of S/C ratio on the total H2 production and net power in the system. Hydrogen production increases with the increase in the S/C ratio. However, the total net power is decreased since the amount of steam consumption is increased, which affects the work of the Compressor-1 for the PSA unit. Meanwhile, the increase in the S/C ratio causes the energy demand increase for the endothermic reaction, which decreases the temperature of flue gas vented out from the thermal insulation of the reforming reactor. As a result, the S/C ratio of 6 is selected as the optimum condition for this process. Referring to Table 4, the minimum reliable S/C ratio to produce H2 at the highest conversion should be over than 5.8."
7,Effect of RR operation temperature,"3.2 Effect of RR operation temperature For the oxygen carrier of Fe2O3, the temperature in the range of 850–950 °C is normally used for the reducing of it to Fe/FeO in the RR when using coal or biomass as the reducing agents [14]. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the RR operating temperature from 800 to 950 °C on the H2 production and the energy circulation in the CLH system. High temperature is required to support the kinetics of reaction between biochar and iron ore because it is a solid–solid reaction in the moving bed reactor with a short residence time. Even though the kinetics of reactions are not considered in this simulation, the high temperature is still applied to ensure that the kinetics are enough for the complete conversion of biochar to CO2 and H2O. Shen et al. [47] and Gu et al. [48] found that the temperature range of 720–740 °C was enough for the complete conversion of original biomass with a low CO concentration in the flue gas. For the biochar with higher carbon content than biomass, higher temperatures than 740 °C are used in this study. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the total H2 production is low at a temperature lower than 900 °C even though the energy circulation within the system is high due to the heat transfer by the circulation of Fe2O3 originated from the AR with the temperature of 1200 °C. The CLH system is designed to be auto-thermal by utilizing the extra oxygen carrier as the heat carrier. The higher RR temperature is, the lower the energy circulation becomes, as such, at 950 °C, the energy circulation is not enough to support the system to be auto-thermal. Therefore, the operating temperature of the RR is determined as 900 °C rather than 950 °C to obtain higher H2 production with higher total energy circulation."
8,Effect of SR operating temperature,"3.3 Effect of SR operating temperature As stated above, in the SR, H2 is produced by converting steam through the oxidation of Fe/FeO from the RR to Fe3O4. The operation temperature range of 700–900 °C is usually used for this reaction [14]. Fig. 7 shows the effect of the SR operating temperature in the range of 650–800 °C on the H2 production and the energy circulation in the CLH system. Iron oxidation with steam is an exothermic reaction with the equilibrium achieved at a low temperature. By increasing the temperature from 100 to1000 oC, H2 concentration in the product decreases from 99.9 to 64.6 vol% according to the reaction as shown in Eq. (9). For the reaction of Eq. (10), the increase in temperature from 600 to1000 oC decreases H2 concentration from 62.0% to 11.4 vol% [49]. Since the reduced iron ore which originates from the RR is totally in the form of FeO (see Eq. (10)), the change in temperature of the SR significantly affects H2 production, and the lower the temperature is, the higher the H2 production becomes. However, at the temperature below 700 °C, the energy circulation is not enough to maintain the CLH system auto-thermally. At the temperature of 650 °C, the total CLH unit becomes an endothermic process that requires external heat or more Fe2O3 circulation in it as the heat carrier. With the same amount of Fe2O3 circulation, the temperature of 700 °C is determined as the SR operating condition to obtain the highest H2 production and enough energy circulation for the auto-thermal CLH system."
9,Overall performance,"3.4 Overall performance The overall system can generate a total of 6.9 kg/h of H2 per 100 kg/h of biomass feeding rate with a net power of 58.3 kW in the optimum operating condition in Table 3. The biomass pyrolysis process generates 20.9% of gas, 24.8% of biochar, 37.1% of tar, and 17.2% of water. Table 5 summarizes and compares the reported several results for the biomass pyrolysis in the auger-type reactor for similar woody biomass at the same temperature of 500 °C [50–53] which shows that the residence time of pyrolysis reaction can be assumed to be in the range of 180–300 s. The bio-oil with the generated gases and water is flowed into the steam bio-oil reforming reactor which produces 4.2 kg/h of H2 after purified by the PSA unit. Meanwhile, the biochar is streamed to the CLH unit, where 2.7 kg/h of H2 is produced. In the CLH unit, in order to convert the biochar completely, about 525.5 kg/h of Fe2O3 particles are circulated, which includes 51% excess as the heat carrier. The total amount of water required as the steam for the overall process is 355.6 kg/h, including 132.6 kg/h for the steam bio-oil reforming process, 2.2 kg/h as the promoter in the RR, and 220.8 kg/h introduced to the SR. After H2 is separated from the CLH unit, about 196.7 kg/h of water is also obtained, which is recycle-used as the steam for the SR. As such, only 26.3 kg/h of additional make-up water is required to be supplied into CLH unit from outside. Table 6 shows the detailed streams of the biomass pyrolysis, steam tar reforming, CLH process described in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, and Table 7 summarizes the net power for overall system. Table 8 compares the H2 production efficiency of this simulation with some typical H2 production processes with the CLH units using various fuels and methods [14,19,37,38,54,55]. The CLH process in this simulation can achieve H2 production efficiency of 10.95%, which is calculated from 2.71 kg/h of H2 produced from 24.75 kg/h of biochar. The biochar has the similar characteristics as the coal, which can achieve higher H2 production efficiency than the raw biomass. Coal as the feed for chemical looping process can reach H2 production efficiency up to 15% or even more compared to raw biomass that limited at around 5%. However, using biochar as reducing material for chemical looping increases H2 production efficiency from raw biomass even though it is not as good as coal. Moreover, even compared with other reported results for biomass to H2 through the CLH process, a total H2 production efficiency of 7.0% by this novel system is still better. Applications of both the steam reforming of bio-oil and CLH process can increase H2 production efficiency by around 53% compared to the biomass direct chemical looping (BDCL) process. Table 9 compares the H2 production efficiency of this novel system with those reported data using other methods for H2 production [2,43,56–59]. A previous theoretical analysis result indicated that the maximum H2 production efficiencies should be 12.6, 11.5%, and 17.1 wt% for the biomass pyrolysis with steam reforming of bio-oil, biomass gasification with water–gas shift reaction, and direct reaction between biomass and steam using externally supplied heat, respectively [43]. Moreover, as shown in Table 9 , for this novel system, all the processes can hardly reach the theoretical maximum H2 production. However, compared with other reported results for H2 production, this novel system still shows higher H2 production efficiency."
10,Conclusions,"The present study proposed a novel system for H2 production from biomass. We showed that the system can operate at auto-thermal conditions and achieve relatively higher H2 production efficiency than other proposed methods by rationally integrating pyrolysis, catalytic bio-oil reforming, chemical looping processes, and effectively circulating the energy (energy recovery). This system also generates positive net power from the pressure changing processes, which can provide power for the compressors, pumps, and others. Moreover, compared with the biomass direct chemical looping process for H2 production, separating the bio-oil and biochar after the pyrolysis process and combining the steam bio-oil reforming process with the chemical looping process using biochar for H2 production can increase H2 production efficiency from biomass by more than 50%. Thus, this proposed system has a promising potential for the effective H2 production from biomass. For the success of implementing this novel system, detailed design and economic analysis need to be further performed."
