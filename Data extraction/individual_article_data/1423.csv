0,Introduction,"Coal accounts for 88.2% of the world’s fossil fuel resources (mineable & unmineable) and, at current production levels these reserves (mineable) will outlast oil and gas combined [2]. Coal is also the most important energy source for generating electricity, supplying 40% of the world’s demand. In 2015 the total coal resources (including minable and unmineable) were reported to be 23,163 billion metric tons with only 1029 billion tons recoverable with current technology, representing only 4.4% of the total coal resources [11]. However, although the vast majority of coal is unrecoverable in its present form, some of the energy maybe exploited through the enhanced production of secondary biogenic coalbed natural gas, a cleaner burning and less polluting fossil fuel [14,22]. Coalbed natural gas (CBNG) or coalbed methane (CBM) can be formed from coal either thermogenically or biogenically [3,45,46,50]. Thermogenic methane was produced through the thermal cracking of organic compounds at early or late coalification stages. Primary biogenic methane was generated prior to coalification or early stage coalification and may lose during the subsequent compaction and coalification [50]. Secondary biogenic methane was the methane produced by microorganisms associated with meteoric recharge at low temperatures during post coalification stages [43,50]. Historically, coalbed natural gas was thought to consist of gases formed through the coalification process and stored within coal millions of years ago. However, later scientific discoveries suggest that much of the gas is actually secondary biogenic, generated by microorganisms indigenous to the coal seams after the coal was formed [13,22,43,52]. Secondary biogenic methane was found in both low and high rank coals [50], and preferably occurred in low rank coal [47,52,55], although other lab studies also showed higher rate of methane production in high rank coal [12]. Globally, more than 30 coal basins have been identified as containing some fraction of biogenic gas. Strąpoć et al. [52] estimated that about 40% of coalbed gas produced in the USA was biogenic in origin. What makes this form of biogas attractive is that unlike other fossil fuel resources its production can be enhanced using the indigenous microbes that inhabit in these coal seams. Natural gas is also a relatively clean burning fossil fuel and produces much less air pollution than coal. It emits roughly half the carbon dioxide on a per unit energy basis when compared to coal [21]. For this reason, it has been suggested as a “bridge fuel” to transition away from the use of coal [66]. Up until recently, a number of countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Sweden, Netherland, and United Kingdom had announced plans to phase out coal-fired power plants within a short time frame [9,34]. However, as Table 1 shows, many countries face a significant energy gap. To make the transition more manageable, Germany has decided to phase out coal-fired power plants in two stages, 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. They also plan to phase out nuclear power generation by 2022. It is unlikely that this gap can be filled by renewable energy alone and the German government has suggested that natural gas be used as a bridge fuel [32]. Other advantages of transforming coal to natural gas include: 1) Utilization of a previous unavailable energy source. Coal comprises over 90% of all unrecoverable fossil fuel resources which suggests that it could provide an almost unlimited amount of biogenic natural gas; 2) Coal is ubiquitous (can be found in nearly 100 countries [2]) and readily available; and, 3) Coal reservoirs have an enormous capacity to store methane, carbon dioxide and other gases [24]. In fact, storing natural gas below ground in coal reservoirs may be much more economical than storing the gas in above ground facilities in the form of compressed or liquefied natural gas [64]. Recent published data has shown promising results for the enhanced production of secondary coalbed natural gas [8,14,15,26,30,31,53]. However, coal as a carbonaceous rock, is heterogeneous and hydrophobic, characteristics that greatly limit its potential use as a microbial substrate. Not surprisingly, previous investigations suggest that the bioavailability of coal carbon may limit the rate and yield of biogenic gas production [26,53]. Consequently, much of the authors’ research has focused on increasing coal solubilization/depolymerization in order to enhance its bioavailability [23,26]. In this study, we have analyzed the rate and magnitude of biogas production and yield and assessed gas potential, carbon balance, stable carbon isotopes, microbial communities, and microbial pathways changes resulting from the pretreatment by hydrogen peroxide. The results show that a large fraction of coal can be depolymerized/solubilized into the aqueous phase. More importantly, a large fraction of the carbon contained within these coal-derived compounds has been shown to be easily metabolized by microorganisms indigenous to coal, resulting in the significant production of biogenic methane. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the chemical treatment of coal has great impacts on the microbiological structure which is an important finding in biogenic CBNG production and environmental microbiology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Coal samples,"2.1 Coal samples Formation water and coal samples were obtained from the Canyon Aquifer and Fort Union Formation at a site located approximately 31 miles (50 km) west of the Powder River on the Montana side of the Montana-Wyoming state line. The borehole (SL-5), which was located at coordinates 45.01189° North and 106.27149° West, was sampled from depths ranging between 408 feet (124 m) and 431 feet (131 m) below ground surface (bgs). For more geologic information and lithology record of the sampling site, please refer to Huang et al. [25]. Prior to use, the coal was dried at ambient temperature, ground using a mortar and pestle, and sieved. Only the fraction of the coal passing through a 60 mesh (0.25 mm) sieve was used in the study. The heating value of the coal was 11,057 Btu/lb. (25,719 kJ/kg) on a moisture-free basis and the elemental composition was 65.20% C, 3.65% H, 14.07% O, 1.24% N, and 3.57% S [25]. The ultimate analysis and heating value results indicate that the coal is subbituminous in rank."
3,Coal treatment by hydrogen peroxide,"2.2 Coal treatment by hydrogen peroxide The ground coal was treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Certified ACS) at a coal-to-liquid loading ratio of 1 g over 30 ml for a period of 30 days at ambient temperature without any mixing. Coal treated with DI water served as the control. After the treatment period, the liquid phase was separated from the coal solids by filtering through 0.45 µm cellulose filters (47 mm, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). Part of the samples were subjected to N2 gas sparging for 40 min to remove the volatile organic carbons (VOCs) before being designated as sparged samples. Others were designated as unsparged. The filtrate was adjusted to neutral pH with 1 M HCl before being prepared for microcosms. The residue of treated coal was collected and dried and analyzed for mass balance calculation."
4,Organic carbon analyses,"2.3 Organic carbon analyses Total organic carbon (TOC) and carbon content of the residual coal after treatment were analyzed with a Shimadzu TOC analyzer equipped with a solid sample module (TOC V CSN and SSM 5000a, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Total organic carbon and non-purgeable organic carbon were determined for each of the samples (before and after gas production). Purgeable organic carbon (POC) is defined as the difference between TOC and NPOC. For NPOC, the samples were acidified with 2 M HCl and purged with zero grade air gas for a period of 1.5 min before injection and measurement. For the purpose of this paper, “purge” (and its other forms) is used in reference to TOC analysis while “sparge” (and its other forms) refers to the process of sparging treatment with N2. The residual coal solid after treatment was analyzed by the SSM 5000a module for the remaining carbon. Upon finishing the headspace analysis after 208 days, the liquid in the microcosms were filtered through 0.45 µm filters to collect biomass. The biomass was also analyzed by the SSM 5000a for carbon values."
5,3-Dimensional excitation emission matrices fluorescence spectrophotometer (3D-EEM),"2.4 3-Dimensional excitation emission matrices fluorescence spectrophotometer (3D-EEM) The 3D-EEM was performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent, Walnut Creek, California, USA). The samples were scanned under emission 3D mode. The scanning emission (Em) spectra from 290 to 590 nm were obtained with 2 nm increments by varying the excitation (Ex) wavelengths from 225 to 450 nm at 2.5 increments. Slit bandwidths of 5 nm for both emission and excitation were adopted at all times. The scan rate was 1200 nm/min. The fluorescence intensities are expressed in arbitrary units presented as a function of the excitation wavelength (Y-axis) and the emission wavelength (X-axis) [26]. The 3D-EEM spectra were created using MatLab (Natick, Massachusetts, USA). Similar to the TOC analysis, two scans were performed for each sample (before and after gas production)."
6,Methane production,"2.5 Methane production The microcosms of methane production experiments used 160-ml serum bottles as batch reactors and contained sample volumes/weight equivalent to 1 g coal/bottle (i.e., 30 ml of liquid fraction). The control, sparged, and non-sparged microcosms were prepared in triplicate. The samples were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) and aseptic techniques were used during preparation (i.e. the bottles and other utensils were autoclaved for 20 min); however, the inner space of the anaerobic chamber was not sterilized using alcohols as to avoid the microcosms from receiving contamination by organics [26]. Mineral, trace metal, and vitamin solutions were prepared in 2× according to Huang et al. [25]. A volume of 30 ml medium solution was added to each bottle so that the final concentration of the medium is 1×. The final concentration of the mineral solution included: 0.8 g/L NaCl, 1 g/l NH4Cl, 0.1 g/l KH2PO4, 0.1 g/l KCl, 1.62 g/l MgCl2·6H2O, and 0.04 g/l CaCl2·2H2O. The final concentration for the trace metal solution included: 20 mg/l nitrilotriacetic acid, 10 mg/l MnSO4·H2O, 8 mg/l Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O, 2 mg/l CoCl2·6H2O, 2 mg/l ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.2 mg/l CuCl2·2H2O, 0.2 mg/l NiCl2·6H2O, 0.2 mg/l Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.2 mg/l Na2SeO4, and 0.2 mg/l NaWO4. The final concentrations of the vitamin solution included: 0.1 mg/l pyridoxine HCl, 0.05 mg/l thiamine HCl, 0.05 mg/l riboflavin, 0.05 mg/l calcium pantothenate, 0.05 mg/l thioctic acid, 0.05 mg/l p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.05 mg/l nicotinic acid, 0.05 mg/l vitamin B12, 0.05 mg/l MESA mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, 0.02 mg/l biotin, and 0.02 mg/l folic acid. 1 mg/l resazurin in the final solution was an indicator for changes in redox conditions, which is colorless below −110 mV and turns pink under conditions above −50 mV [22]. Microbial consortia of microorganisms (designated 21–32 c) derived from coal samples were used to inoculate the microcosms [26]. The culture was originally derived and enriched from coal provided by the Colorado School of Mines. Methanogenic organisms (e.g., Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosarcina) and bacteria (Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) were identified from the enriched inoculum used in this experiment [15]. A volume of 0.5 ml (less than 1% of the total culture volume) of inoculum was added to each of the bottles. An aliquot of sample was withdrawn with a syringe as soon as the bottle was capped. This sample was then subjected to TOC and 3D-EEM analyses, which were designated as a “before-inoculation” sample. The microcosm bioreactors were incubated at 30 °C. A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 8A, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen 1000 packed column (4.6 m × 1/8 in. × 2.1 mm) was used to measure the methane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the headspace of the bottles. Time zero headspace gas composition measurements were made immediately after the microcosm bioreactors were prepared. Another aliquot of sample was taken for TOC and 3D-EEM analyses and designated as an “after-incubation” sample after 208 days’ incubation. Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are the two major pathways for methane production. Microcosm setups were performed to investigate these pathways of methane production. Microcosms contained 10 mM carbon (acetate, 10 mM or HCO3 −, 10 mM plus H2 40 mM) and were inoculated with the same inoculum described above. They were also incubated at 30 °C. Microcosms with soluble coal samples were re-fed with CO2/H2 (0.6 mmol) and acetate (0.6 mmol) after 208 days’ incubation."
7,Gompertz model,2.6 Gompertz model Methane production was modeled by a modified Gompertz equation to evaluate the kinetics of the gas production (Eq. (1)) [22]. (1) y = A ∗ exp - exp μ m ∗ exp 1 A ∗ λ - t + 1 where y designates the cumulative methane production (μmol/g coal); A designates the cumulative methane production potential (μmol/g coal); µm designates the maximum specific methane production rate (μmol/g coal/day); λ designates lag-phase time (day) and t designates the incubation time (day).
8,Stable carbon isotopic analyses,"2.7 Stable carbon isotopic analyses Stable carbon isotopes of the solid and head space were analyzed in the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of Wyoming (UWSIF) and Institute of Urban Environment China, respectively. Solid includes original coal, coal after treatment by hydrogen peroxide, and dissolved organic carbons (dried, before and after incubation) while in headspace CH4 and CO2 were analyzed. The Finnigan DeltaPlus XP is run in continuous flow mode and connected to either a Carlo Erba 1110 or a Costech 4010 elemental analyzer via a Finnigan ConFlo III interface. A sample contained within a tin capsule is dropped into a combustion reactor held at 1020 °C. For carbon analysis, the combustion reactor contains chromium oxide for oxidation and silvered cobaltous/cobaltic oxide for the removal of sulfur. When the tin capsule is exposed to a gas flow temporarily enriched with ultra-high purity oxygen (25–30 ml min−1), flash combustion occurs, which raises the temperature of the sample to >1700 °C and generates CO2, and H2O. An adsorption trap containing magnesium perchlorate removes the H2O. The remaining CO2 gas travel through a Porapak Q chromatographic column (80–100 ml min−1 at 50 °C) as the carrier gas and then moves to the ConFlo III open-split interface. The gas then moves through the ConFlo III to the Finnigan DeltaPlus XP mass spectrometer. Reference gases are pulsed by the ConFlo III into the mass spectrometer for proper mass balance. Headspace carbon isotopes were analyzed with a Delta V Advantage stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a GC Isolink and a RT-Q-BOND column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA), Fused Silica PLOT, 100% divinylbenzene, 30 m in length, 0.32 mm I.D., and 10 µm film thickness. The column is capable of separating CH4 and CO2 in the headspace gas while the Isolink converts CH4 to CO2. Sample volume of 30 µl was injected with injection inlet temperature set at 120 °C and ran in split mode with split ratio of 60:1. Helium was used as the carrier gas and the column was set in the constant flow mode with a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The column was maintained at a constant temperature of 40 °C."
9,"DNA extraction, sequencing, and analyses","2.8 DNA extraction, sequencing, and analyses 2.8.1 Coal inoculum The method for DNA extraction, sequencing and analyses were described previously [22]. Coal sample was pulverized and washed using a 0.05 M sterile phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Tween 80 to elute the microorganisms attached to the surface of coal and eliminate interference of heavy metals which might reduce the efficient of DNA extraction. After washing, the solutions were filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane filter (Whatman, Japan). The filter was used for DNA extraction with a FastDNA SPIN kit for soil (Bio101 Systems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quality and concentration was determined using a NanodropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. The obtained DNA was stored at −20 °C for further processing. DNA sequencing was performed by the Institute for Environmental Genomics at the University of Oklahoma with an Illumina Miseq platform (San Diego, CA, USA). The protocol of PCR, sequencing and data analysis were performed as described elsewhere [10]. Briefly, the 16S rRNA variable region 4 (V4) were amplified using the universal primer sets 515F/806R (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA/GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) which have been used for Illumina-based surveys to amplified bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene [22]. The raw sequence reads were processed by an in-house sequence analysis pipeline (IEG sequence analysis pipeline, http://zhoulab5.rccc.ou.edu). Btrim was used to complete the quality trimming with minimum length of 150 bp, average quality score of 25, and removing sequencing adaptors66. Forward and reverse reads were combined using FLASH. Chimeric sequences were removed using UCHIME. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified using UCLUST67 at the 97% similarity level, and singletons were removed. The taxonomic assignment was conducted by RDP classifier with minimal 50% confidence estimates. The 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from Miseq pyrosequencing have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive with the accession number SUB3212103. 2.8.2 Microcosms Genomic DNA was extracted with a FastDNA SPIN Kit For Soil (Qbiogene-MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA), following protocols established in the lab. The primer pair 515F/907R was used to amplify the V4-V5 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes while the primer pair 958F/1048R was used for the V6 region of archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Each forward primer contained a unique 10 bp barcode which was used to distinguish samples. PCR reaction was performed with the same conditions as described by Hu et al. [19,20]. Each sample was amplified in triplicate, pooled, and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valenca, CA, USA). The purified amplicons was mixed in equal amounts and analyzed by Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China) using HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with paired-end strategy (2 × 91bp). The results were deposited into the NCBI short reads archive database with the accession numbers SRR6031188 and SRR6301935. The barcoded Illumina PE sequencing (BIPES) pipeline, Mothur v1.31, and QIIME v1.7.0 were used to process raw data by following the procedure described in the previous study [20]. Sequences were filtered as per the aforementioned study: only the length ranged from 50 to 90 bp, there was no ambiguous base (N) in the entire sequences and non-assigned barcodes or mismatches in the primer sequence. The chimeras and sequence errors were further removed or corrected with Mothur commands “chimera.uchime” and “pre.cluster”, respectively. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified and further analyzed using corresponding Python scripts in QIIME, with a cutoff of 98% identity. A representative sequence from each of OTUs was selected and assigned to taxonomic rank using RDP classifier with a confidence threshold of 50%."
10,Results,
11,TOC and other carbon analyses,"3.1 TOC and other carbon analyses The pretreatment of coal by hydrogen peroxide generated a fair amount of soluble carbon (as high as 3335.1 mg/l), as shown in Fig. 1 . Some of the filtered liquid sample was sparged with N2 gas for 40 min to remove volatile organic carbons (VOCs). As soon as the microcosms were set up and the gas production experiments were finished, samples were withdrawn for TOC analyses. Due to the nature of microcosm setup, the concentration of TOC was diluted to half of its original concentration by the medium solution. The values represented day 0 (Sparged and Unsparged Before) and day 208 (Sparged and Unsparged After), as indicated in Fig. 1. The TOCs of the before-incubation samples were 1665.9 and 1667.7 mg/l for the sparged and unsparged samples, respectively. The NPOCs values were 1659.6 and 1659.9 mg/l for their counterparts, respectively, suggesting only a small fraction of soluble carbon is purgeable organic carbon. After the incubation, the TOCs of sparged and unsparged microcosms were reduced to 1353.9 and 1345.5 mg/l, whereas NPOCs were 1348.2 and 1292.7 mg/l. The residue of coal after pretreatment was 704.0 mg for each gram coal and hence 29.6% of the original coal was solubilized, in which 422.3 mg of coal carbon remained undissolved. Therefore, 15.3% of the original coal carbon was depolymerized/solubilized into aqueous phase, from which 6.3% of this soluble carbon was bio-converted to methane (1.01% of total coal carbon, Table 3). Hydrogen peroxide has a redox potential of 1.78 V [44]. However, the intrinsic iron (21.9% of the ash as a form of iron oxide) contained within coal matrices can mediate the Fenton-like reaction and result in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH·). The hydroxyl radical has a much higher redox potential (2.73 V) than H2O2 itself, which can aid in unspecific attacks to chemical bonds [25]. In previous study, it was found that the addition of ferrous ion accelerated the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals within hours; hence, the quick attack on coal structures as compared to tens of days without the addition of an iron catalyst [25]. However, the slower reaction ensues the production of TOCs, which has an order of magnitude higher than the hydrogen peroxide with an added iron catalyst system, causing over-oxidation to occur. Organic matter tends to be mineralized to CO2 partially or completely with the presence of free iron [44,59,60]. As a result, hydrogen peroxide treatment without the addition of iron has an advantage of dissolution of more coal carbon and hence a higher gas yield. However, over-oxidation may occur in that parts of the organic carbon was mineralized, as suggested by the carbon balance calculation (Table 3)."
12,3d-EEM,"3.2 3d-EEM The spectra of the three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) of the before- and after- incubation samples for both the sparged and unsparged microcosms are shown in Fig. 2 . The technique can be used to distinguish humic-like, fulvic-like, and aromatics/PAHs peaks [26]. Humic-like compounds and aromatics/PAHs were detected in all samples, whereas fulvic-like peaks that were supposedly located underneath humic-like peaks were not detected. Each of the humic-like peaks occurred at Ex/Em (excitation/emission) wavelengths 410/502. The intensity remained unchanged at around 130 a.u. (a.u. = arbitrary unit; between 126.0 and 136.4). The oblique bar located on the upper left corner signified the aromatics/PAHs compounds, starting from simple structure compounds with fewer rings at the lower end on the left to more complex compounds with multiple rings at the higher end on the right [26]. The unsparged-before-incubation sample indicated the most prominent aromatics/PAHs compounds which had an intensity of 557.6 a.u., followed by the unsparged-after-incubation (55.7), the sparged-after-incubation (18.6), and the sparged-before-incubation (17.7). This implies that the organic compounds particularly for those with fewer rings, (and hence more volatile) were either removed by the sparging [26] or metabolized by the microorganisms. The other three spectra (unsparged-after-incubation, sparged-before-incubation and sparged-after-incubation) showed residual peaks in the aromatic/PAHs regions."
13,Methane production,"3.3 Methane production The methane production was monitored over a period of 208 days at an interval of 8 days. Fig. 3 is the cumulative methane production over time and has been normalized to per mass of coal. Both unsparged and sparged microcosms produced a significant amount of methane. The unsparged microcosms (filled circles) started to produce methane from the day 24 and rapidly accumulated by the day 96. The production rate slowed down and reached the highest yield of 552.6 μmol/g coal (437.1 Scf/ton coal) at the day 184. For the sparged microcosms (empty circles), the gas production rate was much lower with a prolonged production period. Between the day 56 and 192, the gas increased linearly and reached the highest yield of 548.5 μmol/g coal (433.9 Scf/ton coal) at the day 208. In order to investigate the pathways of methanogenesis, microcosms fed with acetate or CO2/H2 as substrates and inoculated with the original coal inoculum as well as re-feeding microcosms containing soluble coal samples with acetate and CO2/H2 were set up. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 (A), for the microcosms inoculated with the original coal inoculum, acetate was converted to methane starting at the day 18 and peaked at the day 64. However, microcosms with CO2/H2 as substrates had no methane detected even after a second inoculation (Day 49). This indicates that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway is inactive, suggesting methane production through acetate oxidation plus hydrogenotrophic pathway is unlikely to happen [38]. The methane produced in acetate-fed microcosms with original coal inoculum occurred through the acetoclastic pathway that directly cleaves methyl groups to produce methane. In the re-feed experiment, the microcosms were fed with CO2/H2 and acetate sequentially after 208 days’ incubation. After the re-feed of CO2/H2, methane was detected immediately and peaked at the day 17 for both sparged and unsparged microcosms, as shown in Fig. 4(B)."
14,Gompertz model,"3.4 Gompertz model The parameters for the Gompertz equation that were derived from the experiment data as well as the R-squared values of the fitting were shown in Table 2 . The model curves fit the experiment data very well for both sparged and unsparged microcosms (Fig. 5 ). The unsparged microcosms had a much higher maximum specific methane production rate and shorter lag-phase time than that of the sparged microcosms, despite the similarity in the final yields."
15,Carbon balance,"3.5 Carbon balance The carbon flow to different carbon-containing components was depicted in Table 3 . There are five major components that carbon was resided within: the remaining coal solids after treatment, soluble carbon, carbon integrated in cells (biomass), carbon as forms of methane and carbon dioxide in the headspace of microcosms. Coal residue accounted for approximately 65% of the carbon from the original coal, followed by 13% of solubilized carbon that was remained after incubation. The methane gas represented slightly over 1%, while CO2 and biomass accounted for another 1%. Approximate 20% carbon was excluded in these five major components. We speculated that the unaccounted carbon was the carbon lost during hydrogen peroxide treatment, i.e., over-oxidation [25]."
16,Stable carbon isotopic analyses,"3.6 Stable carbon isotopic analyses The stable carbon isotopes in the coal samples, treated liquid samples, and headspace of microcosms were analyzed. The δ13C of original coal is −24.32‰. All the coal samples, including solid and liquid, have 13C enriched (heavier), as shown in Table 4 . In the headspace of microcosms, methane gas has depleted 13C whereas carbon dioxide has enriched 13C. All the processes have shown isotopic fractionation (ε) to various extents."
17,Microbial community analysis,"3.7 Microbial community analysis In order to assess the microbial communities that were propagated in cultures, pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes were performed on unsparged and sparged samples as well as the inoculum. Both bacteria and archaea were detected (Fig. 6 ). After quality control, 20,804 bacterial sequence reads with 519 OTUs and 4556 archaeal sequence reads with 29 OTUs were obtained from the inoculum sample. A total of 82,152 and 75,674 sequence reads were obtained respectively for unsparged and sparged samples using the primer pair 515F/907R. Specifically, 60,746 bacterial sequence reads with 1498 OTUs and 21,406 archaeal sequence reads with 210 OTUs were found in unsparged samples, while 43,259 bacterial sequence reads with 1379 OTUs and 32,415 archaeal sequence reads with 294 OTUs were found in sparged samples. The archaea-specific primer sets 958F/1048R were used to obtain more details about archaeal communities, resulting in a total of 48,145 and 34,511 archaeal sequence reads with 367 and 211 OTUs, respectively, for unsparged and sparged samples. The taxa of bacterial communities in the inoculum was shown in Fig. 6(A). Expect of others and unclassified sequence reads, Proteobacteria was the most abundant Phylum, accounting for 18.77% of sequence reads. At Class level, Alphaproteobactiera, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria respectively contained 1.28%, 4.78%, 7.20%, and 5.13% of sequence reads. Chloroflexi was the second most abundant Phylum with 9.17% of sequence reads followed by Anaerolineae which made up 9.13% of sequence reads. Other dominant Phyla included Firmicutes (3.78%), Chlorobi (2.60%), Bacteroidetes (1.49%), Actinobacteria (0.97%), and Acidobacteria (0.12%). Specifically at Class level in each dominant Phylum, Clostridia accounted for 3.29% of sequence reads. 2.60% of sequence reads clustered into Ignavibacteria. 0.56% and 0.86% of sequence reads in Bacteroidetes respectively grouped into Sphingobacteria and Bacteroidia. Other phyla were all below 0.10% of sequence reads. The predominant genera detected in the inoculum were Belllilinea (6.18%) and Longilinea (1.31%) in Chloroflexi, Methylobacter (4.93%) and Desulfobacterium (2.19%), Syntrophobacter (0.77%), Sulfuricella (0.76%), and Geobacter (0.64%) in Proteobacteria, Ignavibacterium (2.60%) in Chlorobi, Petrimonas (0.63%) in Bacteroidetes, and Acetobacterium (0.57%) in Firmicutes. These bacteria are potential to degrade coal or facilitate the sulfur and nitrogen cycling. Bellilinea sp. and Longilinea sp. are strictly anaerobic, filamentous bacteria, and have been isolated from methanogenic propionate-degrading consortia [63]. Bellilinea also has been found in hydrocarbon-degrading enrichment cultures with potential to convert oil into methane [29]. Ignavibacterium is a strictly anaerobic and obligately heterotrophic bacteria [28]. Desulfobacterium is a sulfate-reducer which could also anaerobically degrade aromatic compounds, such as phenol and phenol derivatives [4], catechol [56]. Syntrophobacter is reported to be typical propionate-degrading bacterium in methanogenic ecosystems [6]. Sulfuricella can oxidize sulfur under anaerobic condition [33]. Geobacter has been found in some CBM fields [5]. It is a strictly anaerobic dissimilatory Fe (III)-reducer, and benzoate-degrading bacterium. Petrimonas, an anaerobic fermentative bacterium, has been isolated from producing wells in a biodegraded oil reservoir [17]. Acetobacterium is an anaerobic bacterium with ability to degrade various carbohydrates, such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and generate acetate [1]. Other biodegrading bacteria include Magnetospirillum, Desulfuromonas, Desulfobacterium, Acidovorax, Proteiniphilum. Using primer pair 515F/907R, both bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene were amplified. After sequencing, bacterial OTUs were selected to analyze the bacterial communities in unsparged and sparged samples. The phylogenic compositions of bacterial communities were shown at generic level in Fig. 6(B). The bacterial communities in both samples were very close to each other. Proteobacteria was the predominant Phylum. Proteobacteria accounted for 52.62% and 48.78% of bacterial sequence reads for unsparged and sparged samples, respectively. Specifically, Deltaproteobacteria were particularly abundant in both samples with 49.09% (unsparged) and 48.04% (sparged) of bacterial sequences. Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were also found in both samples that are below 2.00%. Other dominant Classes include Clostridia in Firmicutes and Anaerolineae in Chloroflexi. Clostridia accounted for 21.39% and 22.70% of bacterial sequence reads while Anaerolineae made up 13.55% and 13.55% for unsparged and sparged samples, respectively. In addition, Bacteroidia with 6.88% and 4.75%, Spirochaetes with 3.38% and 4.61%, Bacilli with 0.01% and 4.01%, and Synergistia with 0.68% and 0.63% were detected in unsparged and sparged samples, respectively. At a genetic level, the aforementioned Classes were dominated by sequences belonging to Anaerolinaceae_SHD-231 in Anaerolineae (12.92% and 12.86%), Proteiniclasticum in Clostridia (13.31% and 12.88%), Syntrophobacter in Deltaproteobacteria (6.70% and 4.07%), and Treponema in Spirochaetes (3.36% and 4.58%). The remaining sequences were distributed among Clostridium (2.52% and 3.67%), Rikenellaceae_Blvii28 (3.73% and 0.00%), Acidaminobacter (0.95% and 2.35%), Ralstonia (1.76% and 0.00%), and other low-abundance genera. At generic level, most of the dominant microbial communities after cultivations have also been detected in inoculum with relative lower proportion, such as Proteiniclasticum (0.08%), Paludibacter (0.01%), and Desulfomicrobium (0.21%). However, it is obvious that the composition of the bacteria was changed significantly. The sequence reads grouped into unclassified increased dramatically on family and genus leaves, as shown in Table 5 , suggesting large number of bacteria remained unknown in the coal samples. This has implications in that coal is a relative pristine environment that needs further studies. The taxa of archaeal communities in the inoculum was shown in Fig. 6(C). Methanosarcina and Candidatus Methanoregula were the predominant genera, which together accounted for 91.55% of sequence reads. Specifically, 66.62% of sequence reads were clustered into Methanosarcina which can utilize diverse substrates and produce methane via all three methanogenesis pathways (acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic). 24.93% of sequence reads were grouped into Candidatus Methanoregula which produce methane from H2/CO2. Meanwhile, Methanobacterium, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, with 6.48% of sequence reads was the third most dominant genus. The rest of other genera were all below 0.10%. The phylogenetic compositions of archaeal communities revealed by primer pair 958F/1048R in unsparged and sparged samples are shown in Fig. 6(D). Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina were the most dominant genera. Methanobacterium respectively accounts for 63.13% and 49.29% of the sequence reads for unsparged and sparged samples while Methanosarcina accounts for 36.41% and 50.50%, respectively. Methanobrevibacter, Candidatus Methanoregula, and Methanospirillum all consisted of <0.5% in both samples. The dominance of Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina were also found using primer pair 515F/907R (data not shown). The results showed that 87.35% and 93.26% of sequence reads respectively in unsparged and sparged samples were clustered into Methanobacterium, while 1.26% and 6.51% of sequence reads were grouped into Methanosarcina. However, Methanosarcina (66.62%) was the most dominated Archaea followed by Candidatus Methanoregula (24.93%) and Methanobacterium (6.48%) in the inoculum sample. In bacterial communities, a wide spectrum of anaerobically fermentative bacteria were found; these might be responsible for the degradation of larger molecules to smaller molecules. Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridia were often found in methanogenic consortia and methanogenic environment, such as oil and coal [18,39,52]. Some members of Anaerolineae are known as alkanes degrading bacteria, which are syntrophically associated with Methanosaeta to produce methane [35]. Specifically at genetic level, the most dominant genus, Anaerolinaceae SHD-231 has been found in ruminal microbiota [42]. Most of the described bacteria in this genus were potent enough to ferment the intermediates and produce methanogenic substrates that were syntrophically associated with methanogens. Proteiniclasticum is a strictly anaerobic gram-negative bacterium. The major fermentation products include acetate, propionate, and iso-butyrate [65]. Syntrophobacter is a gram-negative bacterium. Members of this genus can anaerobically degrade propionate and lactate to acetate in the presence of methanogens [6]. It is found in various methanogenic ecosystems [37]. Treponema was reported to be actively involved in benzene-degrading methanogenic consortia [36]. It can utilize glucose, cellulose, and many other sugars to produce formate, ethanol, succinate or H2 and CO2 as the end products [7]. Clostridium is known as anaerobically fermentative bacteria. Various strains have been found in methanogenic consortia as acetogenic bacteria [49] and hydrogen producing bacteria [41]. Ralstonia is identified as an important degrader of xenobiotic and recalcitrant compounds [67]. It is able to degrade a number of toxic substances such as aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated phenolic compounds. It can also survive in the environments with high concentrations of heavy metals. Syntrophomonas is an anaerobe that is able to oxidize fatty acids syntrophically with methanogens. In the presence of methanogens, acetate/propionate and methane accumulate, producing palmitate as the substrate [18]. Desulfomicrobium is a strictly anaerobic gram-negative, sulfate reducing bacterium. It can use hydrogen gas, lactate, or malate as electron donors to incompletely oxidize organic substrates to acetate. It is typically found in environments such as anoxic freshwater, marine sediments, and oil field water [48,57]. Acidaminobacter was reported to be predominant in enrichments with Indonesian coals [54]. It was also documented to ferment glutamate and other organic compounds [51]. All these bacteria maybe responsible for the upstream degradation of more complex organic compounds to simpler ones that are more readily available to methanogens."
18,Discussion,"Hydrogen peroxide has a redox potential of 1.78 V [44]. However, the intrinsic iron (21.9% of the ash as a form of iron oxide) contained within coal matrices can mediate the Fenton-like reaction and result in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH). The hydroxyl radical has a much higher redox potential (2.73 V) than H2O2 itself, which can aid in unspecific attacks to chemical bonds [25]. In previous study, it was found that the addition of ferrous ion accelerated the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals within hours; hence, the quick attack on coal structures as compared to tens of days without the addition of an iron catalyst [25]. The treatment did result in strong aromatics/PAHs signals identified by EEM. However, the slower reaction ensues the production of TOCs, which has an order of magnitude higher than the hydrogen peroxide with an added iron catalyst system, causing over-oxidation to occur. Organic matter tends to be mineralized to CO2 partially or completely with the presence of free iron [44,59,60]. As a result, hydrogen peroxide treatment without the addition of iron has an advantage of dissolution of more coal carbon and hence a higher gas yield. However, over-oxidation may occur in that parts of the organic carbon was mineralized to CO2 and not captured in this study, as suggested by the carbon balance calculation (Table 3). That is, simple organics including formic and acetic acids as potential methanogenic substrates may be further decompose to CO2. Whether CO2 is a desired product of the treatment depends on the methanogenic pathways in methane production. Statistically, there is no difference in term of yield between unsparged and sparged microcosms. The methane gas accounted for slightly over 1% of the original coal carbon while CO2 accounted for 0.31%. The data suggest that the removal of VOCs, although in a minuscular amount (in term of the difference of TOC values), is important in initiating the methane formation and impacting the rate and pattern of gas generation. However, these VOCs generally have no impact on the overall gas yield. The re-fed experiment suggests that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was “activated” after gas production, although the underpinning mechanism remains elusive. This was confirmed by the microbial studies. The obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens, methanobacterium was less dominant (6.48%) in the inoculum became the most dominant methanogens in the microcosms (Fig. 6). An immediate production of methane was also observed with a re-feed of acetate, as expected. The decrement of methane concentration after peaks for each re-feed is possibly attributed to the leaks of repetitive sampling. It is widely accepted that for values of methane carbon isotope composition, −50‰ is the value to differentiate the origin of methane between thermogenic and biogenic [16,46,58,61,62]. Practically, methane produced by the acetoclastic pathway typically has methane carbon isotopes that are less than -50‰ and less than −60‰ for hydrogenotrophic pathways. The methane produced in this study is much heavier (less negative, up to −40.51‰). The kinetic isotopic effect is not as prominent as expected (95 for hydrogenotrophic pathway and 40–60 for acetoclastic pathway [61]. These findings suggest that in the more controlled environment (lab scale experiments) the carbon isotopic composition can be changed artificially and contributed to the shift of carbon isotopic signature in the subsequent processes. These changes can be attributed to the microbial consortia and substrate depletion effects [16]. As such, the carbon isotopic is not particularly useful to interpret the methanogenic pathways. The microbial community analysis revealed that the differences for both the bacterial and archaeal communities between unsparged and sparged samples were subtle (Fig. 6). The removal of minuscular amount of VOCs did not have a significant influence on the microbial communities at the end of the incubation period. Although the proportions of each genus detected by primer sets 515F/907R and 958F/1048R were different, the structure of archaeal communities were similar in unsparged and sparged samples, as revealed by both primer sets with Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina dominating in archaeal communities in the two samples. Methanobacterium is well known for obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis while Methanosarcina can utilize all three methanogenesis pathways (acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic). The dominance of these two genera and coupled with the re-inoculation experiment data, suggested that both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis contributed to the gas production. The similar values of methane yield after adding additional substrates also support the similar archaeal communities in the two samples. However, when compared to the inoculum, Methanosarcina (66.62%) was the most dominant Archaea while bacterial communities were different on the family and genus level. This implies that the chemical treatment has great impact on the changes of microbial communities. It was proposed that the coal macromolecules were decomposed by hydrolysis enzymes to produce small molecules like long chain alkanes and single ring aromatics. These small molecules were further degraded to form simple molecules that served as substrates for methanogens to produce methane [52]. Microbial analysis shows that several genera of bacteria were identified to be capable of degrading intermediate organic compounds, such as long chain fatty acids and aromatic compounds. The EEM analysis clearly showed aromatic/PAHs-like peak (Fig. 2). Fatty acids were also detected in the samples treated by hydrogen peroxide [40]. Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic utilizing acetate and CO2 + H2, respectively, are the two major pathways for methane production. Original coal inoculum was found to be able to utilize acetate to produce methane, however, the microbial consortium cannot convert CO2 + H2 to methane (Fig. 4A). This implies that acetoclastic methanogenic pathway is the major pathway in the original coal inoculum. This is consistent with another study using acetate and CO2 + H2 as control microcosms while using a different PRB coal inoculum (original coal samples without any treatment or enrichment, but grinding in a anaerobic chamber) [22]. The control microcosms with acetate produced methane while the other had little to no methane detected. Nevertheless, the re-spike with CO2 + H2 or acetate after gas production (Fig. 4B) shows both pathways worked well. No other physico-chemical conditions were changed and methane can be produced quickly and effectively. The results unequivocally suggest that there is a pathway shift in that hydrogenotrophic pathway was activated. This also suggests that the methanogenic pathways can be shifted with the stress of environmental changes. Methanobacterium, who is an obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen along with Methanosarcina, are the dominant methanogens in the microcosms. In the original inoculum, Methanoregula is the second most abundant methanogens, next to Methanosarcina. However, unlike the inoculum, the sequence read of Candidatus Methanoregula was extremely low for the gas production microcosms. Candidatus Methanoregula maybe out-competed by Methanobacterium, but the mechanism remains unknown."
19,Conclusions,"Since the discovery of coalbed methane can be bio-transformed from coal, great efforts have been made to enhance the gas production both in labs and in fields. Recent interests was focused on developing technologies that will replenish the depleted wells with newly generated gas and extend the operational life of wells. Mainstream research adopted methods of using stimulants, including nutrients and amendments, to stimulate the gas production [22]. Current research takes another route of enhancing gas production by enhancing the bioavailability of coal carbon, since carbon bioavailability is one of the key limiting factors that restrain the rate and yield of gas production. Hydrogen peroxide is an effective oxidizing agent that is capable of solubilize/depolymerize fractions of coal into aqueous phase. These soluble coal carbons can be utilized by microorganisms indigenous to coal and biotransformed to methane. The stable carbon isotopic analysis showed that the biogenic methane was enriched with 13C (heavier than the empirical field data). Therefore, carbon isotopic data obtained in lab experiments should be used with caveats in interpreting the methanogenic pathways. Compared to lab data, the lab experiments tend to artificially enrich or deplete the 13C of the precursors and hence shift the carbon isotopic composition in the subsequence processes. Further analyses such as pH changes and metabolites are needed to find out such shifts. In addition, the chemical treatment of coal has impacts on the microbial structure during the subsequent methane production phase. The abundance of obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased significantly that contributed to the production of methane with the carbon reduction dioxide pathway."
