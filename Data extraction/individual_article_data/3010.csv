0,Introduction,"Fatty alcohols and their derivatives are widely used as surfactants, lubricants or additives in many industrial products [1]. Commercially useful fatty alcohol are divided into synthetic and natural alcohol. The latter are produced from natural fat and oil by the hydrogenation reaction. Compared with the synthetic fatty alcohol, the natural fatty alcohol is more competitive and easier to be accepted by people due to coming from the renewable resources. The most common process for the manufacturing natural fatty alcohol is the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) in the presence of the Ru-based catalysts [2,3], Cu-based catalysts [4,5], and Pd-based catalysts [6–8]. In recent studies, new types of better performance multimetal catalyst such as Ru-Sn-B [9] and Co-Sn has also been developed [10]. These catalysts have high catalytic activity and good selectivity, but they also have some drawbacks, such as much more requirements, higher reaction temperature and higher hydrogen pressure, especially, inactivation of catalyst. Therefore, The design and the synthesis of a catalytic system which is stable, easily separable and reusable has been pursued. Recently, the metal nanoparticles have attracted considerable interest as a class of new materials with applications in the catalytic field due to their extremely small size and high surface-to-volume ratio [11–13]. However, the metal nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable with respect to agglomeration to the bulk metal, which reduces the catalytic activity and selectivity [14]. Therefore, new efforts have been made to overcome such difficulty, and the possible solution for this problem is the use of the stabilizing agent which can prevent the metal nanoparticles sintering [15]. Compared with the traditional organic solvents and electrolytes, ionic liquids (ILs) have been labeled as “designer solvents” and “task-specific fluids”. ILs thus provide the scientific community a plethora of research opportunities for exploring their unique and interesting properties. Studies using ILs as the stabilizers for the metal nanoparticles have already been reported, and it has been proven that ILs are the suitable media for the synthesis and stabilization of the metal nanoparticles [16–18]. In addition, ILs can also act as additive to modified the physicochemical properties of the metal nanoparticles, including the size, shape and catalytic performance [19–22]. Recently, ILs containing polyether chain were synthesized and used to stabilize the metal nanometer catalysts. It is found that, due to the polyether chain, such ILs nanoparticle stabilizers weakly coordinate to the metal clusters through multiple sites in such a way that some portions of the cluster surfaces are exposed for catalysis, making it valuable for catalytic reactions such as hydrogenation and hydroaminomethylation [23–25]. Therefore, some novel ILs containing polyether chain were synthesized and used to stabilize the metal nanometer catalyst in this paper. The results showed that such ILs were exceptionally effective stabilizers for the metal nanoparticles and endowed the nanoparticle catalytic system with a thermoregulated property, namely, the monophasic reaction combined with a biphasic separation, which facilitated the fast reaction of the substrates in monophasic phase, the simple separation of the product from the catalytic phase and the recycling of the nanoparticles catalytic system."

3,Preparation of Pd nanoparticles thermoregulated catalytic system,"2.2 Preparation of Pd nanoparticles thermoregulated catalytic system In order to explore the effect of the polyether chain length on the stability, catalytic activity and thermoregulated properties of nanoparticles, Polyethylene glycol monomethyl ethers with different molecular weight (The average molecular weights are followed 400, 600, 750, and 1000) were used as the reagents to synthesize the thermoregulated ILs, and the obtained ILs successively named ILMPEG-400, ILMPEG-600, ILMPEG-750, and ILMPEG-1000. The ILMPEG-600 synthesis was used as the typical experiment to illustrate the process for the thermoregulated ILs synthesis. Firstly, 0.10 mol MPEG-600, 0.40 mol sulfoxide chloride and 280 mL toluene were reacted at room temperature for 1.0 h, and then reacted at 70 °C overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. After that, the reaction mixture was distilled under vacuum to remove the toluene, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride, obtained the MPEG-600 chlorinated product CH3(OCH2CH2)nCl with 98.6% yield. Next, 0.05 mol CH3(OCH2CH2)nCl, 0.06 mol N-methylimidazole and 200 mL tetrahydrofuran were reacted at 90 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then tetrahydrofuran was removed by distilling under vacuum, obtaining ILMPEG-600 with 96.7% yield. The reaction formula for the preparation of the ILMPEG-60 is showed in Scheme 1 . The obtained ILs (ILMPEG-400, ILMPEG-600, ILMPEG-750, ILMPEG-1000) were conducted by IR and 1H NMR tests (See Supplementary material, Fig. S1–S8). The mixture of ILMPEG-600 10.00 g and PdCl2 0.17 g (m(ILMPEG-600):m(Pd) = 100:1) was stirred until PdCl2 completely dissolved at room temperature in a steel autoclave (75 mL) lined with Teflon. Then the mixture was reacted under 4.0 MPa H2 for 6 h at 70 °C, obtaining the Pd nanoparticles catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 stabilized by ILMPEG-600. The other catalytic systems PdNPs/ILMPEG-400, PdNPs/ILMPEG-750, PdNPs/ILMPEG-1000, RuNPs/ILMPEG-600 and RhNPs/ILMPEG-600 were synthesized according to the same process. Some samples of the catalytic systems were characterized using TEM, XRD, XPS, ICP-AES and UV–vis."
4,Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester,"2.3 Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester The mixture of FAME 2.50 g, catalyst PdNPs/ILMPEG 1.00 g (Containing 0.01 g Pd), n-heptane1.20 g, and toluene 1.00 g was reacted at 210 °C for 4 h under 6.0 MPa H2 in a 100 mL high-pressure reactor. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The upper phase containing the hydrogenated products, n-heptane and toluene were separated from the catalytic system layer simply by decantation, as shown in Fig. 1 . The obtained catalytic system was reused without any transaction in the recycling experimental. The hydrogenated product fatty alcohol was obtained after removing n-heptane and toluene by reduced pressure distillation. In order to evaluate the catalytic performance of the catalyst, the hydroxyl value (V OH) and iodine value (V I) were used to characterize the fatty alcohol production and the residue of the unsaturated carbon carbon double bond, and V OH and V I of the obtained product were measured according to the literature[26]. the conversions of the carbonyl group and carbon-carbon double bond were defined as C CO = V OH/210 × 100% and C CC = V I/128 × 100% respectively, where 210 is the saponification value of FAME, and 128 is the iodine value of FAME. When other catalysts such as Pd/C, Cu-Cr, PdCl2, RuNPs/ILMPEG-600 and RhNPs/ILMPEG-600 were used as the catalysts in the hydrogenation, the operations were similar to the above process. All experimental were repeated for five times in order to determine the reproducibility of the results."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Test of the catalyst thermoregulated performance,"3.1 Test of the catalyst thermoregulated performance It has been shown that the solvent system consisting of ILMPEG, toluene and n-heptane had a feature that “split phase at low temperature, miscible at high temperature”. The amounts of toluene and n-heptane play an important role on the miscibility temperature of the catalytic system, and the length change of IL polyether chain is also a factor. The ratio of toluene to n-heptane will determine the polarity of the solution, which in turn will alter the miscibility of the ionic liquid in the solution [27]. An appropriate ratio of toluene to n-heptane will make miscibility temperature of the catalytic system more suitable for the reaction. So using ILMPEG-600 and PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 as the examples, the effects of amount of toluene and n-heptane on miscibility temperature system were investigated, and the results are showed in Table 1 . As can be seen from Table 1, when the amounts of ILMPEG-600 and n-heptane were kept constant, the miscible temperature of ILMPEG-600 in the system obviously decreased from 123 °C to 30 °C upon increasing the amount of toluene form 1.60 g to 3.20 g (Entries 1–9). Similarly, the miscible temperature of PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 also decreased with increasing of the amount of toluene. In contrast, their miscible temperatures increased upon increasing the amount of n-heptane (Entries 10–13), and the miscible temperature was positively correlated with the n-heptane content. The similar conclusions were obtained in the modes of ILMPEG-400 and PdNPs/ILMPEG-400, ILMPEG-750 and PdNPs/ILMPEG-750, ILMPEG-1000 and PdNPs/ILMPEG-1000 (See Supplementary material, Tables S1–S3). Otherwise, the length change of IL polyether chain had as obvious influence on the miscibility temperatures of ILMPEG-400 and PdNPs/ILMPEG. Upon inversing the length change of IL polyether chain, the miscibility temperatures of ILMPEG-400 and PdNPs/ILMPEG increased obviously. Based on the above research results, it is suggested that the synthesized ILMPEG and the catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG have excellent thermoregulated performances, and their miscible temperatures are adjustable. By using the different amount of n-heptane and toluene, it is expected to find a catalytic system which is suitable for a specific reaction temperature, and then realize the feature that “split phase at low temperature, miscible at high temperature”. So the catalytic reaction process can be expressed by Fig. 1. 3.1.1 XRD analysis The Pd nanoparticles were separated from the PdNPs/ILMPEG catalytic system through the centrifugal and conducted XRD tests, and the results are showed in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the XRD reflection peaks of the Pd nanoparticles at 40.20°, 46.73°, 68.21°, and 82.17°, respectively, corresponding to Pd (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes in the FCC structure (JCPDS No. 87-0639: 40.2°, 46.8°, 68.3°, and 82.3°), which indicated that the Pd nanoparticles obtained by four kinds of ILs were face-centered cubic structures and Pd0 [28]. By Scherrer formula calculation, the obtained Pd nanoparticle sizes were between 3.17 nm and 2.28 nm. Otherwise, the particle size of Pd nanoparticles became smaller upon increasing the length of the IL polyether chain. And the particle size of Pd nanoparticles using the synthesized ILs as the stabilizers was smaller than those already reported in classical ILs [29], which indicates that the thermoregulated ILs have the excellent stability for the nanoparticles. 3.1.2 XPS analysis To intuitively evaluate the reduction level and determine the composition of the as-prepared PdNPs/ILMPEG composite, the catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 was selected as a model to conduct the XPS test. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the XPS full-spectrum indicated Cl, Pd, O, N and C, which reflects the actual material contained in the system. In Fig. 3b, the XPS spectrum of the Pd showed the double peaks with binding energies at 335.7 eV and 340.5 eV, corresponding to Pd3d5/2 and Pd3d3/2, respectively, and both can be attributed to Pd0 state. Compared to the standard spectra of the metal Pd0, the binding energies of Pd increase slightly (from 335.1 eV to 335.7 eV and from 340.4 eV to 340.5 eV), indicating the change of the chemical environment of Pd. This may be due to that, the coordination of Pd with the carbonyl oxygen makes Pd loss some electron, and the decrease of the valence electron density reduces the shielding effect for the inner shell electrons, so the combination of the inner shell electrons increases [30]. 3.1.3 TEM analysis Four kinds of Pd nanoparticles catalytic system (m(IL):m(Pd) = 100:1) were characterized by TEM, and the results are showed in Fig. 4 . It is seen that numerous monodispersed Pd nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the ILs, and the size of the Pd nanoparticles was between 0.5–5.0 nm. Otherwise, the size of the Pd nanoparticles decreased upon increasing the length of the IL polyether chain. This may be because that, the functional quaternary ammonium salt cation and nonionic polyethylene glycol chain can serve as anchors to stabilize the Pd nanoparticles in the IL, which is facilitate the dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles by preventing them from aggregation in the process of reaction [31,32]."
7,Effects of reaction conditions on FAME hydrogenation,"3.2 Effects of reaction conditions on FAME hydrogenation As can be seen from Table 2 , when the catalysts Pd/C [33] and Cu-Cr [34] were used as the catalyst in the hydrogenation reaction with their best reaction conditions (Entries 1 and 2), C CO and C CC was also not satisfactory. This may be because that both catalysts were heterogeneous catalysts with large particle size, and the mass transfer and diffusion resistance decrease the probability of contact and reaction between the reactant with the active sites of catalyst. When PdCl2 was used, the hydrogenation of the carbon unsaturation was almost fully reacted, but the hydrogenation of carboxylic ester group not occurred (Entry 3), and the experimental phenomena was seen that, with no stabilizer, the Pd particles agglomerated to sedimentate at the bottom of the reactor during the reaction. Compared with the above three catalysts, the Pd nanoparticles catalytic systems using the thermoregulated ILs as stabilizers showed the better catalytic performance for the hydrogenation (Entries 4–6). Especially when the catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 was used in the hydrogenation, C CO and C CC of the reaction were 97.1% and 91.1%, respectively. The above results suggested that the Pd nanoparticles catalytic systems using the thermoregulated ILs as the stabilizer is an efficiency catalyst for the hydrogenation. This may be due to that under the reaction temperature, the tiny Pd nanoparticles can be dispersed into the reactants well and form a stable dispersion system because of the thermoregulated performance of the synthesized ILMPEG (Fig. 1). Among all the Pd nanoparticles catalytic systems studied, PdNPs/ILMPEG-400 was not an efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction giving the reaction with about 90% C CO and 83.8% C CC (Entry 4). This may be due to the size of the Pd nanoparticles. Compare with the other stabilizers, the size of the Pd nanoparticles using ILMPEG-400 as the stabilizer was larger (Fig. 4), which indicates the bad dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. As a result, PdNPs/ILMPEG-400 makes the catalytic active center Pd low dispersion and offered the reaction a small area reaction interface, which is unfavorable for the hydrogenation. The similar results were also obtained when PdNPs/ILMPEG-7500 and PdNPs/ILMPEG-1000 were used as catalysts (Entries 6 and 7). Compared the catalytic effects of RuNPs/ILMPEG-600 and RhNPs/ILMPEG-600 (Entries 8 and 9), the results showed that PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 had the best catalytic performance. This may be due to that Pd-base catalyst possesses the higher catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of the carboxylic ester groups than Ru-base and Rh-base catalysts. Therefore, the other factors on the synthesis of fatty alcohols would be investigated using PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 as catalyst in subsequent experiments. Table 3 shows the effects of the other reaction conditions on the results of the hydrogenation reaction. It was found that C CO of the reaction increased upon increasing the dosage of catalyst from 0.6 g to 1.0 g (Entries 1–3). When the catalyst dosage was 1.0 g, C CO of the reaction was about 97.1%. At the same time, C CC of the reaction was also satisfactory. After that, no further increase in C CO of the reaction upon increasing the catalyst dosage could be obtained. The reaction time had a significant effect on the hydrogenation (Entries 3 and 5–7). It was found that, the hydrogenation was completed when the reaction time was 4.0 h (Entry 3). When the reaction time reached 5 h, C CO and C CC of the reaction decreased to 89.6% and 80.2%, respectively (Entry 7). This was attributed to the dehydroxylation of product fatty alcohols occurring under longer reaction time, and the process tended to form olefin by-product. Therefore, the optimal reaction time was 4.0 h. The results of the effects of P(H2) on the hydrogenation are also showed in Table 3 (Entries 3 and 8–10). It was found that, upon increasing of P(H2), C CO and C CC of the reaction increased. When P(H2) reached 6 Mpa, both were satisfactory. After that, it was no means to increase C CO and C CC of the reaction by increasing P(H2). So the optimal P(H2) was 6 Mpa. The reaction temperature had a significant effect on the hydrogenation (Entries 2, 11–13). When the reaction temperature was 190 °C, the hydrogenation was not complete and C CO and C CC of the reaction were only 70.5% and 65.3%, respectively (Entry 11), which may be due to low reaction speed at low reaction temperature. Upon increasing the reaction temperature, both increased. However, when the reaction temperature reached 220 °C (Entry 13), C CO and C CC of the reaction decreased to 89.8% and 79.7%. This indicated that a high reaction temperature was unfavorable for the hydrogenation and accelerated the side reaction dehydroxylation, resulting in the production of olefin and the decrease of the reaction C CC. Therefore, the optimal reaction temperature was 210 °C. Based on the above results, the optimum reaction conditions were obtained as follows: FAME 2.5 g, catalyst PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 1.0 g, n-heptane 1.2 g, toluene 1.0 g, reaction temperature 210 °C, reaction time 4 h, P(H2) 6 MPa. Under these conditions, C CO and C CC of the reaction were 97.1% and 91.1%, respectively. The reusability of the catalyst PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 was investigated under the optimal experimental conditions, and the results are given in Table 4 . Seen from the table, C CO and C CC of the reaction were almost unchanged after PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 was repeatedly used seven times, which indicates the good reusability of the catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG-600. In order to further confirm its good stability, the repeatedly used PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 and the each product sample were characterized by the TEM (Fig. 5 ) and ICP-AES elemental analyses (Fig. 6 ), respectively. Fig. 5 revealed the particle size of the Pd nanoparticles increased, and aggregation occurred for PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 after seven cycles, while the Pd nanoparticles remained highly dispersed in ILMPEG-600 with an average size of 4.32 nm were observed after seven cycles. As a result, the catalyst of PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 still had larger surface area, which could offer more catalytic sites toward hydrogenation [35]. The good stability of ILMPEG-600 should be attributed to the synergistic effect of quaternary ammonium salt cation and nonionic polyethylene glycol chain in ILPEG-600. Otherwise, ICP-AES elemental analyses showed that 2.5 wt% Pd lost in the firstly use, then the Pd lost showed a descending tendency in the next six repetitions. When the catalytic system was reused seven times, only 0.3 wt% Pd lost, and the cumulative loss of Pd in the seven repetitions was about 5.8 wt%. It was indicated that, though the thermoregulated phase-separation property of the catalytic system can easily realize the separation of catalytic components and the products, the loss of Pd is inevitable in the process of phase separation."
8,Conclusions,"The hydrogenation of FAME was investigated in the presence of the noval metal nanoparticles thermoregulated catalytic system using the synthesized ILs as the stabilizers. The functional quaternary ammonium salt cation and nonionic polyethylene glycol chain of the synthesized IL served as anchors to stabilize the Pd nanoparticles, which gave the nanoparticles catalytic system the high dispersion and high stability. The catalytic system PdNPs/ILMPEG-600 exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for the FAME hydrogenation. C CO and C CC of the reaction were 97.1% and 91.1% respectively when the reaction was carried out at 210 °C for 4 h. The separated metal nanoparticles catalytic system could be reused seven times without obviously decrease in its catalytic performance though the nanoparticles aggregation and the loss of the metal happened."
