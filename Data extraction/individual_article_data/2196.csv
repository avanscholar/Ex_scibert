0,Introduction,"The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has played an important role in the development of fuel cells in recent years. PEMFC can be separated into two types of fuel cells: low temperature PEM fuel cells (operated at <100 °C), and high temperature PEM fuel cells (operated at >100 °C). High temperature fuel cells use polybenzimidazole (PBI) for the membrane. PBI is an amorphous basic polymer with high thermal stability and a reported glass transition temperature of 420 °C [1]. High temperature fuel cells with PBI have been shown to have high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures [2–4]. These fuel cells are also able to tolerate impurities in the feed gas, such as carbon monoxide (CO), which allows flexibility of fuel, e.g., onboard hydrogen generation by reforming hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas, gasoline or alcohols [5,6]. The safest method is for fuel cells to produce hydrogen fuel within the device. Normally, methanol fuel is used as the reforming fuel to generate hydrogen, due to its lower reforming temperature. Increased operation temperature significantly increases CO tolerance. As shown by Li et al. [7] and Holladay et al. [8]. Li et al. defined CO tolerance as a voltage loss of less than 10 mV for 3% CO in hydrogen at a maximum current density of 0.8 Acm−2 at 200 °C, and for 0.1% CO in hydrogen at 125 °C with a current density lower than 0.3 Acm−2. Holladay et al. reported an integrated fuel reformer and fuel system for microscale (10–500 mW) power generation which showed a high level of CO tolerance, up to 10%, without significant degradation in performance at a maximum temperature of 150 °C, and successful production of 23 mW of power. Thomas et al. [9] showed that at sufficiently high operating temperatures, CO tolerance up to 3% can be achieved. Korsgaard [10] successfully used synthesis gas to simulate reformate gas at the anode, with CO content varied from 0 to 5% and CO2 from 25 to 20% at temperatures ranging from 160 to 200 °C, and suggested that higher CO concentrations require an increased operating temperature. Avgouropoulos [11] has presented an internal reforming alcohol fuel cell. A methanol reforming catalyst was constructed within the anode. The cell was operated at 200 °C. The internal reforming alcohol fuel cell (IRAFC) (with foam of 10 mm thickness) operated efficiently for more than 72 h at 200 °C with a current density of 263 mA/cm2 at 500 mV, when 20% CH3OH/30% H2O/He (anode feed) and pure O2 (cathode feed) were supplied. Schwank [12] discussed several factors that may influence micro-reactor performance, with emphasis on the different contributions by the mechanisms of heat transfer between the active reaction zone and its surroundings, the materials of construction, and the reactor aspect ratio. Heat effects were found to be particularly important in determining the performance of steel micro-reactors. Catalyst deactivation was observed after operating continuously for 8 h, but the catalyst regained the original level of activity after the reformer was shut down for at least 2 h. Methanol fuel is an attractive fuel due to a lower reforming temperature, good stability in water, and a low content of sulfur compounds. The major limitation on the thermal efficiency of the reformer is heat loss and conduction. An endothermic methanol steam reformer achieves optimal performance at a temperature of about 240 °C. A PBI membrane fuel cell is operated exothermically at 160 °C–200 °C. To better couple the lower temperature fuel cell to the higher temperature steam reformer, a two-stage temperature steam reformer to integrate into the PBI membrane fuel cell system is proposed. The reformer optimizes thermal management and increases the system efficiency. Hydrogen produced in a methanol reformer may have temperatures of 200 °C–220 °C in the outlet channel. When integrated within a high temperature fuel cell, this heat can be fed into the reaction channel through a cold trap, decreasing the effect of CO concentration on the high temperature fuel cell operation. One-stage and two-stage methanol reformers combined with a PBI membrane fuel cell were examined in the present study."
1,Experimental,
2,One-stage reformer with PBI membrane fuel cell,"2.1 One-stage reformer with PBI membrane fuel cell A steam reformer and catalytic combustor was integrated with a high temperature PEMFC. The concept of the reformed methanol fuel cell (RMFC) is shown in Fig. 1 . The air and methanol is fed into the combustor, which is located next to the reformer. By using a different air/methanol flow rate, the combustor temperature can be controlled between 200 °C and 260 °C. An aluminum material plate was inserted between the combustor and the reformer. A methanol and water solution was fed into the reformer channel. The certain portion at the front of the reformer channel was used as a vaporization zone, which makes the methanol fuel vaporize before reforming. The size of combustor and reformer channel was 60 mm (L) × 5 mm (W) × 5 mm (H), and contained 7.43 g of reaction catalyst. The catalyst was platinum oxide (PBNS250), with 0.2 wt% Pt. The reformer side load of the steam reforming reaction catalyst JM51-8 was 3.0 g. The characteristics of the catalysts are shown in Table 1 ; the major material is Cu [13]. The one-stage reformer with high temperature fuel cell is illustrated in Fig. 2 (a). The reforming gas, hydrogen, and carbon oxidizer were cooled in a bottle for dehydration before use in the fuel cell. The reformer gas was analyzed by a Real Time Gas Analyzer (RTGA, Agilent Technologies 5975B inert XL MSD). The sensor in the instrument is a mass spectrometer, which analyzed by parameter the hydrogen and CO2 content in the product. For the fuel cell, a commercial PBI membrane assembly (BASF P-1000), area 24.01 cm2, was used, and cell performance was tested by CHINO (FC5100)."
3,Two-stage reformer with PBI membrane fuel cell,"2.2 Two-stage reformer with PBI membrane fuel cell In order to optimize the rate of hydrogen production from the reformer, another reformer was used before the one-stage reformer as a micro reformer combined with a catalytic combustor. The channel size of both reformers was 25 mm (L) × 5 mm (W) × 5 mm (H), with 3.2 g of reaction catalyst in the combustor and 4.2 g in the reformer. The catalyst in the micro reformer and combustor was the same as for the one-stage. The two-stage reformer combined with a high temperature fuel cell is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). The experimental equipment included a cold trap for the reformer outlet gas, a syringe pump for the methanol-water mixture to be fed into the reformer, and an air pump controlled by a DC current that introduced air into the combustor."
4,Measurement sequence,"2.3 Measurement sequence Before integration with the PBI membrane fuel cell, it was necessary to analyze the gas composition of the reformer gas. For a one-stage reformer, the operating temperature was set between 200 °C and 260 °C, and a methanol-water mixture with S/C ratio of 1.1 was used to find the best conditions for hydrogen production. In the two-stage reformer, the micro reformer operates at the optimum temperature for hydrogen production, while the one-stage reformer still operates at 200 °C by heating. Because the one-stage reformer was integrated into the PBI membrane fuel cell (see Fig. 2(a)), heat was directly transferred from the fuel cell. The PBI membrane cannot be operated over 200 °C. In order to compare the difference before and after integration with the reformer, pure hydrogen was used to examine the effects that varying temperature and current have on the electrical performance of the fuel cell. The following states examined are below: • Fuel cell operating temperatures 160 °C–200 °C in steps of 10 °C. • Fuel cell voltages 1.0 V–0.3 V in steps of 0.05 V."
5,Results and discussion,"Table 2 summarizes the experimental results of one-stage and two-stage reforming, including reaction temperature, methanol water mixture feed rate, and H2, CO2 and CO concentration. Table 2(a) shows that the optimum hydrogen production in a one-stage reformer was achieved at a methanol flow rate of 15 ml/h and 240 °C; (b) shows that optimum production in the two-stage reformer was achieved at 25 ml/h and 240 °C. In the one-stage reformer, the unit of reaction time is not sufficient to complete reforming with an increased methanol flow rate of 25 ml/h. Results show that the hydrogen concentration decreases with an increase in methanol water mixture feed rate. For the JM51-8 reforming catalyst, results show that 240 °C is more favorable than 260 °C and 200 °C in both the one-stage and two-stage systems. At reaction temperatures lower than 240 °C, whenever the Cu catalyst is oxidized to CuO, the back-reaction to pure Cu under hydrogen is difficult. Methanol fuel cannot be reformed into hydrogen gas by CuO. This condition becomes more serious when temperatures below 200 °C are used. CO is harmful to the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of the fuel cell. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the stability of the reformer outlet gas for the two types of reformer; result shows that the two-stage reformer gas was more stable than the one-stage, as the two-stage reformer has additional micro reformer capacity, and can more efficiently and with greater stability convert the methanol fuel into hydrogen. However, it is not available for optimum hydrogen generation for one stage reformer. The result also shows the fluctuations in flow rate of the two types of reformer. Methanol and water need to vaporize before being fed into the reformer, and the phase change from liquid to gas builds up the pressure in reformer. This causes the fluctuations in the flow rate. Results of the performance test using pure hydrogen at different operating temperatures are shown in Fig. 5 (a). The performance decreases at 200 °C. The main reason might be the raising of the operating temperature that reduces membrane conductivity due to leakage of the liquid phase phosphoric acid. Due to this, the best performance was achieved at 190 °C. The experimental parameters for the reaction in the one-stage reformer integrated within the high temperature PEM fuel cell were a temperature of 200 °C, fuel feeding rate of 15 ml/h, and a S/C ratio of 1.1. The product gas composition of the reaction was 63%–64% H2, 19%–20% CO2, and 1%–2% CO. Fuel cell performance testing results are shown in Fig. 5(b). The operating temperature of the fuel cell was almost the same as the reformer at 200 °C. Results indicated that the performance of the cell with reformer was less stable than with pure hydrogen because the outlet gas from the reformer was unstable. The performance was almost the same as for a hydrogen concentration of 60%. The two-stage reformer was designed to improve the stability and concentration of outlet reformer gas. The micro reformer was operated at the optimum temperature of 240 °C for the best production of hydrogen, and the second reformer was set to 200 °C to promote hydrogen production from the uncompleted reaction of methanol and water in the micro reformer. These two different operating temperatures could finish the uncompleted reaction of methanol and water in the micro reformer, achieving stable outlet gas (Fig. 4). The fuel cell temperature was set to a range from 190 °C to 200 °C for use with the two-stage reformer. Performance measurements showed that the two-stage reformer integrated with the fuel cell was more stable than the one-stage reformer (Fig. 5(c)). The maximum power density achieved was 0.344 W/cm2 with pure hydrogen. The one-stage reformer gas could provide a maximum power density of 0.20 W/cm2 under a methanol flow rate of 15 ml/h at 200 °C with the PBI membrane fuel cell. Increased methanol flow leads to decreased hydrogen concentrations and an unstable product flow rate, which negatively impacted performance (Fig. 5(b)). The maximum power density was 0.25 W/cm2 for the two-stage reformer under 25 ml/h at 240 °C, and an increased methanol flow did not affect the production flow rate due to re-reaction in the one-stage reformer. In Fig. 5(b) and (c), the fuel cell was operated at higher temperature. It lost water and PO4-, resulting in lower membrane conductivity and reduced catalyst reaction rate, and caused the polarization of pure H2 to occur at a lower voltage than that with the reformer at a low current density. In the reformate gas, a little water content might cause this difference from pure H2. There are two causes for the lower performance compared to pure hydrogen, one is that the concentration of hydrogen was 60%–70% in the mixture, and the other is a CO concentration of 1%–2%. The present study has investigated the reduction of CO concentration. Another flow condition in the micro reformer is the output pressure of the product gas. Due to the lower hydrogen pressure supplied by the micro reformer, the fuel cell power output may become unstable. This experiment indicates that a two-stage reformer can resolve this problem."
6,Conclusions,"A methanol fuel reformer was introduced upstream of a PBI membrane fuel cell. The size of the one-stage reformer was 60 mm (L) × 5 mm (W) × 5 mm (H), loaded with 3.0 g of steam-reforming reaction catalyst JM51-8. For a one-stage reforming catalyst, the optimized methanol flow rate was 15 ml/h at 200 °C. Next to the reformer, a catalytic combustor was added and loaded with 7.43 g of the reaction catalyst in the flow channel. The size of the micro reformer in the two-stage reformer was 25 mm (L) × 5 mm (W) × 5 mm (H), loaded with 4.2 g of catalyst, and an additional 3.2 g in the combustor. The reaction catalyst was made of platinum oxide catalyst PBNS250, with 0.2 wt% Pt. Results show that the optimum reaction temperature for the two-stage reforming process was 240 °C. Integration of the reformer and a PBI membrane fuel cell was undertaken. Results show that the fuel cell performance was lower when feeding with reforming gas rather than pure hydrogen. This was due to the percentage of hydrogen gas and CO concentration in the reforming gas. The fuel cell performance was 0.344 W/cm2 under pure hydrogen, while the performance using the two-stage temperature reformer was 0.25 W/cm2. The two-stage reformer makes the reforming process more efficient, and also improves the hydrogen production rate and concentration compared to the one-stage reformer."
