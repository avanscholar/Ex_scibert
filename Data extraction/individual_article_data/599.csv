0,Introduction,"Climatic changes, pollution and soaring fuel prices are the major societal threats [1] and these global energy shortcomings are provoked by the excess use of energy resources. Hence, the dire requirement for energy saving and environment friendly materials is being addressed at a large scale in the research community [1,2]. The depletion of fossil fuels at an alarming rate has led to the need for an alternative energy source. In comparison to other renewable energy sources, hydrogen is well thought-out as a clean and environmentally benign energy source. Hydrogen energy is recognized as a potential green foundation which can overcome the global energy dilemma and reduce environmental pollution caused by exorbitant use of fossil fuels [2]. In order to produce hydrogen various methods have been developed for hydrogen generation from different sources such as natural gas reforming [3], solar and wind electrolysis [4], coal and biomass gasification [5], nuclear energy [6]. Particularly, hydrolysis of chemical hydrides, such as NaH, LiH, KBH4, NaAlH4 and NaBH4 is a benign method for producing highly clean hydrogen. The hydrolysis of NaBH4 is a mild exothermic reaction which liberates four molecules of pure hydrogen and sodium meta-borate as by-product as shown in eq. 1. [2,7–9]. Fascinatingly, NaBH4 is a highly favorable material for hydrogen generation because of its versatile characteristics. It has a high hydrogen density of 10.8 wt%, highly stable in alkaline solution, is a clean hydrogen generator, less toxic and helps in easy recyclability of the by-products. Generation of hydrogen from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 also grasps attention because of its non-flammability, environment friendly reaction products, ease of control over the rate of H2 generation even at low temperatures [8]. Hydrolysis of NaBH4 has been carried out with the help of catalysts in order to elevate the rate of reaction. In an effort to find better traditions to apply NaBH4 for easier and more stable hydrogen production reactions, bulk metals and nano clusters are the most used heterogeneous catalysts for hydrolysis of NaBH4 [9–11]. Additionally, solid-state catalysts, such as precious metals (generally functionalized with support) or transition metals and their salts, are found to be very efficient in accelerating the hydrolysis reaction in a controllable manner [11–13]. Noble metal catalysts like Pt and Pd supported over carbon [12,13], Pt Ru supported on metal oxide [14], Ru(0) nanoclusters [11] have also been used for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Unfortunately, these catalysts are highly expensive, environment non-friendly and not abundant in nature. (1) NaBH 4 aq + 2 H 2 O l → Catalyst 4 H 2 g + NaBO 2 aq , ΔH = 300 kJ mol − 1 Keeping in account the prospective limitations of deep-rooted and costly applications of already reported catalysts for the hydrolysis of NaBH4, the construction of efficient, metal free heterogeneous catalysts stands as an indispensable alternative for convenient application with regard to hydrolysis of NaBH4. Recent advances in catalysis chemistry have led to expansion of polymeric composite materials which demonstrate very appealing properties for hydrogen generation reactions, as they show activities comparable to that of metal based catalysts and are porous in nature. Additionally, polymeric materials have easily tunable physical and chemical properties [10,15,16]. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a hydrophilic and cost-effective polymer with a large number of –OH groups. The additional functionalization of pristine PVA with sulfonic acid further increases its chemical stability and dispersion [17,18]. On the contrary, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a hydrophobic and stable polymeric material which is resistant to acids, bases, chemical solvents and heat. Its properties remain adaptable even in ultraviolet and nuclear environments. It has fine mechanical properties like high strength, rigidity and roughness [19]. The incorporation of different materials with the crystalline PVDF support to prepare polymeric composite materials like polymeric composite nanofibers [20,21], polymeric membranes [22] and microcapsules [7] have been reported. Their easily controllable size, structure, porosity, thermal stability and easy recovery are namely the diverse advantages that make PVDF an excellent polymeric material. Furthermore, in order to form composites of PVDF with other materials the process of microencapsulation is widely studied. The method of microencapsulation is the entrapping of materials in the polymer matrix to give microcapsules. Microcapsules with hollow morphology and pores can be synthesized by a number of interfacial methods like phase inversion [19,23], interfacial polymerization [24], etc. They find many applications in the field of fundamental aspects like drugs, dyes, pharmaceuticals, food preservatives and catalysis [25–28]. Thus, taking motivation from all the above mentioned factors, this work reflects on the development, characterization and utilization of SPVA/PVDF composite hollow microcapsules as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for hydrolysis of NaBH4. The as-synthesized materials were prepared by phase inversion method using five different solvent ratios of water: isopropanol. Different analytical and spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize and study the structural chemistry of the composite hollow microcapsules. Further, the catalytic efficiency of the five different SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules was measured in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 at room temperature. The reaction progress for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 was investigated using water displacement method with respect to different temperatures, different wt% of microcapsules, basicity and NaBH4 concentration. It was found that 570 mL of hydrogen could be generated at room temperature using 7.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules as catalyst with a TON of 67.73. The activation energy was calculated for hydrolysis reaction using hollow microcapsule as a catalyst and was found to be 10.91 kJ mol−1. The composite hollow microcapsules were also notably studied for their recyclability and proven to be efficient for 10 successive cycles in terms of reusability as well as morphology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For the synthesis of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), (average MW: 85,000-1,24,000 g mol−1, 99% hydrolyzed), 1,2-dichloroethane (MW: 98.96 g mol−1, 99.8% purity), chlorosulfonic acid (MW: 116.53 g mol−1, 99% purity), polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) (Average MW: 534000, 100% purity), dimethylformamide (DMF), (MW: 73.09 g mol−1, >99% purity), isopropanol (IPA) (MW: 60.10 g mol−1, 98% purity) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India. Methanol (MW: 32.04 g mol−1) was procured from local vendor and used as received. Also, deionized water was used throughout the experiment. For studying the reaction parameters, NaBH4 (MW: 37.83 g mol−1, 99% purity), NaOH pellets (MW: 40.00 g mol−1, > 98% purity) was supplied by Sigma Aldrich. All glassware was cleaned with distilled water and acetone, which was kept in the oven for drying prior to its use."
3,Synthesis of sulfonic acid functionalized PVA (SPVA),"2.2 Synthesis of sulfonic acid functionalized PVA (SPVA) Sulfonic acid functionalized PVA/PVDF composite microcapsules were obtained by a facile and effective two-step synthesis protocol. Initially, sulfonic acid functionalized polyvinyl alcohol (SPVA) was prepared using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 10 g) and 1,2-dichloro ethane (100 mL) in a two necked 500 mL round bottom flask attached with reflux condenser. The reaction mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature in an oil bath under N2 atmosphere for 2 h. After complete dissolution of PVA in 1,2-dichloro ethane, chlorosulfonic acid (45 mL) was added drop wise using syringe pump. The reaction was then allowed to take place at room temperature for 30 min, following which the temperature was increased to 90 °C for 1 h. After the stipulated time, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Thereupon, 100 mL methanol was added to this reaction mixture and maintained at 0 °C (ice bath) for 30 min. The obtained black solid was filtered out using Whatman filter paper and washed with 100 mL distilled water and 50 mL methanol for five times repeatedly. The obtained black solid crystals were collected and dried overnight at 110 °C in a hot air oven."
4,Preparation of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules,"2.3 Preparation of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules For better comprehension, the complete reaction set-up for the preparation of microcapsules is shown in Fig. 1 . The synthesis of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules was done using phase inversion method using syringe pump [19]. About 6 g of PVDF was dissolved in 60 mL of DMF followed by the addition of 3 g of SPVA and kept under stirring for 48 h in an oil bath at 80 °C. After completion of the reaction and formation of uniform reaction mixture, the polymer solution was filled in the syringe needle, adjusted in the syringe pump and then introduced drop wise into the coagulation bath containing known mixture of water and isopropanol in different ratios (90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50). The flow rate of the syringe pump was kept at 9 μL min−1 and the distance between the needle of the syringe and the beaker was 90 cm. After completion of precipitation process, the obtained microcapsules were filtered and washed with distilled water followed by three washes of methanol. The wet microcapsules were kept for drying in a vacuum oven at 90 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the as-synthesized microcapsules were characterized and tested for the hydrolysis of NaBH4."
5,Catalyst characterization methods,"2.4 Catalyst characterization methods FT-IR spectra of prepared microcapsules were recorded using a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrometer (Spectrum Two) by employing KBr disc method for the analysis of chemical modifications in the prepared materials. The specific surface area of the samples was measured by N2 adsorption-desorption using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. To determine surface area, the samples were outgassed under high vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. The instrument used for BET analysis was a BEL Japan (Belsorp Max) instrument. The morphology, surface structure, elemental analysis and uniform distribution of elements in the composite microcapsules was analyzed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with EDX (JEOLModel-JSM7). The stability of the microcapsules was confirmed using X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and the analyses were performed on a Rigaku Diffraction Ultima-IV (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) X-ray diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with a scan speed of 20 min−1 and a scan range of 5–80° at 30 kV and 15 mA."
6,Catalytic activity of prepared microcapsules in hydrogen generation reaction,"2.5 Catalytic activity of prepared microcapsules in hydrogen generation reaction The catalytic hydrolysis reaction was performed in a glass reactor coupled with thermostatic chamber and rate of hydrogen generation was measured by using water displacement method [7]. For a typical reaction procedure, 50 mL of distilled water was taken in a conical flask and 0.5 g of solid NaBH4 was then added to it. Afterwards, a known amount of prepared microcapsules was added as catalyst and the reaction vessel was sealed tightly and kept under constant stirring where the reaction temperature was kept steady. The tightly sealed reaction vessel containing NaBH4 solution and catalyst was connected with another completely sealed conical flask and filled with water to measure the volume of hydrogen gas developing from the reaction. The produced hydrogen from the reaction vessel was pushed in to the water chamber and equivalent amount of water was displaced in to the empty conical flask placed on the active balance connected with computer. The amount of hydrogen generated from the reaction with respect to time was measured with the help of Balance talk software. Additionally, to get the clear view of this whole reaction set-up, a schematic representation is shown in Fig. 2 ."
7,Result and discussions,"In the present study to develop the series of different composite hollow microcapsules phase inversion method was adopted where in water and isopropanol mixture in different ratios is used as the non-solvent coagulation bath. The phase inversion technique allowed the formation of polymeric drops of SPVA/PVDF in the syringe which falls on the coagulation bath consisting of different ratios of isopropanol and water, where coagulation takes place in no time and microcapsules were formed. In order to explain the effect of different ratios of water and isopropanol, we observed that the prepared catalysts showed different granular sizes which were further tested for their efficiency and catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Five different solutions with solvent ratios of water: isopropanol of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50 were prepared and used for this experiment in the coagulation bath to collect the microcapsules. The obtained microcapsules in these solutions were typically named as SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5, respectively. After the successful synthesis of these hollow microcapsules, they were characterized and applied as catalysts in the hydrolysis process."
8,FE-SEM analysis of prepared various SPVA/PVDF microcapsules,"3.1 FE-SEM analysis of prepared various SPVA/PVDF microcapsules An attempt to substantiate and verify the nature of obtained hollow SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules, the color change of as-synthesized catalysts in their wet and dry environments can be notably observed in Fig. 3 . We observed that, the wet samples exhibited black coloration while their dried counterparts displayed an off-white color. In order to gain a deeper insight about the morphology, prepared series of five different SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules were examined using FE-SEM and the obtained results are depicted in Fig. 4 . The interior hollow structure, porosity and surface morphology plays a significant role in optimizing the best catalyst out of all the microcapsules prepared. As evident from the SEM images, the surface morphologies changed significantly with apparent tuning in the concentration of isopropanol and water. SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1 containing 90:10 ratio of water and isopropanol showed wall thickness of 500 μm ( Fig. 4(a)). The low concentration of isopropanol generated microcapsules of high wall thickness with less sponginess and less hollowness. Consecutively, in the next experiment slight increase in the concentration of isopropanol (80:20) was done and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2 was obtained. The SEM results showed decrease in wall thickness (460 μm) and increase in the hollowness, which was much superior compared to SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1 ( Fig. 4(b)). Additionally, there was an observation of competent circular morphology along with elongated pores in the wall of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, which suggested that, due to the increasing concentration of isopropanol, porosity also enhanced. On further increasing the amount of isopropanol in the ratio of 70:30 (water:isopropanol), SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 were developed and analyzed. Results showed a wall thickness of 226 μm and more hollowness as compared to first two samples due to adequate concentration of isopropanol. Along with the hollowness, the pores were seen to be more elongated in the wall of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 and the level of sponginess decreased while there were prominent finger-like projections observed ( Fig. 4(c)). These results indicate that, the porosity in the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 structure improved, due to more amount of isopropanol present in the coagulation bath. Additionally, with further increase in the concentration of isopropanol in water (60:40) and (50:50), the wall thickness of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 was observed to be 324 μm and 255 μm respectively ( Fig. 4(d)-(e)). Notably, the wall thickness of both the composites microcapsules reduced tremendously; however, the circular morphology gets ruptured due to the high concentration of isopropanol. Further increase in the concentration of isopropanol did not show any variation in the wall thickness of the composite microcapsules. However, the outer structures demolished from circular morphology of microcapsules to distorted ruptured morphology. A general trend suggested that as the concentration of isopropanol increases in the coagulation bath, the pores get elongated and the wall thickness decreases. The structure of the SPVA/PVDF microcapsules was greatly influenced by the ratio of isopropanol and water. The demixing rate of the microcapsules is directly proportional to the solubility parameter (δ) of the solvent and non-solvent. The (δ) value of DMF-isopropanol system is 6.7 MPa1/2 and the (δ) value of DMF-water is 23.3 MPa1/2, which suggests that the demixing rate of DMF is higher in water compared to isopropanol. When we used lower concentrations of isopropanol in water (90:10) and (80:20), possibly due to the strong inter diffusion between DMF from the polymeric composite solution and water, the polymer phase solidified very rapidly to form microcapsules with more wall thickness and less porous structures. Additionally, the SPVA having hydrophilic nature interacted with isopropanol and interrupted the physiochemical property of microcapsules. Hence, in SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, the elevated wall thickness was due to the fast demixing as well as less interaction of SPVA and isopropanol. The results from SEM analysis indicated that as the isopropanol concentration in water increased to (70:30), there was thin wall formation in the microcapsules. This resulted in the low wall thickness of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. This can be attributed to the fact that SPVA gets interacted with appropriate amount of isopropanol and water which enhanced the liquid-liquid interaction and decreased the rate of demixing [7,22]. This in turn helped in increasing the porosity of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 and efficient wall thickness. On the other side, at higher concentrations of isopropanol in water (60:40) and (50:50), SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 resulted in a change of morphology. This phenomenon can be explained on the basis of presence of excess amount of isopropanol in water which indirectly lowered the demixing rate and solidification of polymer which resulted in distortion of the circular morphology of microcapsules. Due to the distortion of circular morphology, wall thickness and surface area also increased in microcapsules SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5. Hence, by analysis of the SEM results we were able to reason out that 70:30 solvent ratio of isopropanol in water was the best suited mixture for casting the microcapsules in this study. Aforementioned, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was chosen as the best composite hollow microcapsule due to the obtained morphology as well porosity and hence subjected to further comparison and characterization in this study."
9,Elemental analysis (EDX) and mapping of composite SPVA/PVDF microcapsules,"3.2 Elemental analysis (EDX) and mapping of composite SPVA/PVDF microcapsules Fig. 5 demonstrates the elemental analysis and mapping of elements present in pristine PVA, SPVA and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. Pristine PVA contains only adequate percentage of carbon and oxygen ( Fig. 5(a)). An additional percentage of sulfur in Fig. 5(b) establishes the successful functionalization of PVA surface with sulfonic acid along with the presence of parental carbon and oxygen. While in the case of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, it is evident from Fig. 5(c) that it consists of carbon, oxygen, sulfur along with fluorine in its elemental composition. The high percentage of fluorine can be attributed to the use of PVDF during the preparation of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. These results suggests that SPVA and PVDF merged together to form the composite hollow SPVA/PVDF microcapsules. Also, the corresponding mapping of pristine PVA, SPVA and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 confirms the homogenous distribution of their respective constituents as shown in Fig. 5(d-f)."
10,FT-IR analysis of composite SPVA/PVDF microcapsules,"3.3 FT-IR analysis of composite SPVA/PVDF microcapsules FT-IR analysis was used to corroborate the presence of various functional groups and its modification present in a pristine PVA, SPVA, pristine PVDF and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. Fig. 6 shows all collective results obtained from the FT-IR analysis of various materials prepared in this study. ( Fig. 6(a)) shows the FT-IR spectrum of pristine PVA wherein the OH stretching vibration is designated by a broad peak at 3325 cm−1 which is ascribed to the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups of PVA [29]. The CH asymmetric stretching and bending vibrations are verified by peaks located at 2925 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1 respectively. Also, the CO stretching peak at 1110 cm−1 corresponds to the acetyl group in the PVA backbone [30]. With the functionalization of sulfonic acid to pristine PVA, the intensity of the peaks becomes broader ( Fig. 6(b)). Further, the IR spectrum of SPVA indicated stretching vibration of hydroxyl group at 3288 cm−1, while CH asymmetric stretching peak in the SPVA matrix can be seen at 2900 cm1. The O=S=O asymmetric stretching vibration was seen at 1151 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1. The peak at 600 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of SO group [31,32]. The peaks belonging to O=S=O and SO proved that the additional sulfonic acid functionalization occurred on PVA polymeric chain. Pristine PVDF exhibits a strong peak which corresponds to CH bending vibration at 1400 cm−1 ( Fig. 6(c)). Additionally, IR spectrum of pristine PVDF showed CH bending vibration at 1400 cm−1, CF vibrational band at 890 cm−1, 1200 cm−1 and CC skeleton band at 1150 cm−1 [33]. Comparing SPVA and pristine PVDF, parental bands were preserved and seen in the spectrum of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 ( Fig. 6(d)). The particular bands of 3292 cm−1 and 2912 cm−1 correspond to OH stretching and CH stretching respectively, whereas peak at 1641 cm−1 corresponds to OS stretching vibration. The sharp peaks located at 1400 cm−1 and 1200 cm−1 correspond to CH bond and CF bond. This confirms that SPVA and PVDF are combined together and formed the composite hollow SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3."
11,XRD analysis of composite hollow SPVA/PVDF microcapsules,"3.4 XRD analysis of composite hollow SPVA/PVDF microcapsules Fig. 7 exhibits the XRD configurations of pristine PVA, SPVA, pristine PVDF and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. ( Fig. 7(a)) shows the characteristic peaks of pristine PVA which co-ordinates competently with standard PVA. Its crystallinity can be attributed to the stacking of polymeric molecular chain due to the strong interactions between the hydroxyl groups in its side-chain [34] and is confirmed by the 2θ diffraction peak values of 11.3, 19.4 and 42° [35]. As PVA is functionalized with sulfonic acid, there is remarkable difference in the diffraction peak of sulfonated PVA ( Fig. 7(b)) designated by a broad peak at the 2θ angle of 22.4°, which gives an idea that the attached sulfonic acid group destroys the crystalline nature and stacking of polymeric chains of pristine PVA. This destruction can be attributed to the reaction of hydroxyl groups with bulky sulfonic acid groups thereby restricting intermolecular bonding and making it amorphous in nature. Additionally, SPVA diffraction peak at 42° diminishes due to peak broadening as a result of acidification. Meanwhile, the crystalline PVDF ( Fig. 7(c)) exhibits sharp characteristic peaks at 2θ value 18.2°(100), 20°(020) and wide characteristic peaks at 2θ angle of 26.6° (110) and 38.2° (021) [36]. SPVA and PVDF combine together to form composite hollow SPVA/PVDF microcapsules, where PVDF acts as the controlling agent together with SPVA and formed the unique microstructures. The parental peaks of SPVA and PVDF collectively come together to form the microcapsule. As represented in the XRD pattern of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, the parental crystallinity is preserved as designated by the sharp peak at 19.4°. Also, the small peaks at 26.6°, 38.2° and 42.3° seen in SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 is retained from respective diffraction peaks of pristine PVDF and SPVA ( Fig. 7(d))."
12,Nitrogen adsorption and desorption and surface area analysis,"3.5 Nitrogen adsorption and desorption and surface area analysis Nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves of various SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules are shown in Fig. 8(i). The figure shows the presence of Type- IV N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, which suggests that there is less distribution of pores in the microcapsules due to polymeric composite materials used for their building blocks. The specific surface area calculated by using a BET equation is described in Table 1 . From the obtained results it can be seen that, the surface area is very less for the entire series of SPVA/PVDF hollow composite microcapsules, which can be due to the large micrometer size of composite polymeric microcapsules having very less pores developed in the synthesis process. However, in the obtained surface area, it can be seen that the surface area increases with the increase in the concentration of isopropanol in the catalyst system. This can be due to the enhancement in the number of pores with the variation in the concentration of isopropanol. The pore diameters of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules are displayed in Table 1 and the pore size distribution images corresponding to prepared SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules are shown in Fig. 8 (ii). Pore sizes can be classified accordingly based on the variation of pore size in the material. Materials having a pore size that is <2 nm are classified as microporous, whereas pores exhibiting a pore size in the range of 2 nm- 50 nm are labeled as mesoporous and pores with size >50 nm are categorized to be macro porous in nature. In the present catalytic system, pore diameters of SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules were observed to be 6.7555 nm, 3.92 nm, 3.47 nm, 14.27 nm and 14.27 nm for SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5, respectively. From the obtained results, it can be distinctively observed that all the hollow SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules exhibit mesoporosity. This can be validated as the pore diameter of the microcapsules varied from 2 nm to 50 nm."
13,Catalytic activity studies,
14,Catalytic activity of various SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules,"4.1 Catalytic activity of various SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules The catalytic activity of various prepared microcapsules was studied to generate hydrogen by hydrolysis of NaBH4 under ambient reaction conditions. An illustrative representation of results obtained for hydrogen generation by using the as-synthesized catalysts SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 is represented in Fig. 9(a). In a representative reaction, 0.5 g NaBH4 and 7.5 wt% of catalyst was taken in 50 mL of deionized water and the hydrolysis of NaBH4 was conducted at room temperature. Initially, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1 was tested for this reaction which produced 477 mL of hydrogen at room temperature in 180 min reaction time and attained saturation thereafter. This result could possibly be due to large wall thickness, less hollowness and low porosity in SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-1 prepared using low isopropanol concentration during the preparation process. In continuation, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2 prepared with 80:20 ratio of water:isopropanol was used as catalyst under similar reaction conditions. The catalyst SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2 produced 525 mL of hydrogen in 192 min of reaction time. Throughout the reaction with SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2, the rate of hydrogen was constant up to 192 min, after which reaction got saturated without further evolution of hydrogen. Also, the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2 showed slight enhancement in the hydrogen production yield, which could be attributed to the reduced wall thickness and increased hollowness developed in the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-2 due to the slightly higher concentration of isopropanol. Furthermore, it was seen that on increasing the isopropanol concentration to 70:30, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 generated 570 mL of hydrogen after a reaction time of 180 min. Compared to other two catalysts, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 generated maximum amount of hydrogen due to the competent ability of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. As discussed in the SEM section, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 had sufficient concentration of isopropanol, which resulted in increased hollowness and elongated pores proving to be positively beneficial for hydrolysis of NaBH4. In persistence to the positive results obtained, we tested the catalytic activity for the catalysts with higher concentration of isopropanol (60:40) and (50:50) viz. SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5, respectively. But to our surprise, generation in the amount of hydrogen deteriorated. SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 produced 389.5 mL after 72 min whereas SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 produced an exceedingly less amount of only 190 mL of hydrogen after 130 min. We believe that in order to corroborate catalytic activity not only surface area and porosity, but also wall thickness plays a significant role in hydrolysis reaction. The introduction of SPVA in the PVDF polymer matrix in the coagulation bath enhanced pore formation, which increased the surface area and porosity as mentioned in Table 1. The porous nature of the microcapsules could possibly provide more number of active sites for the hydrolysis of NaBH4, which is favorable for the reaction to proceed in the forward direction. The maximum yield of hydrogen obtained using SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was because of the efficient wall thickness and porosity generated during the microcapsule formation. Additionally, the obtained morphological characteristics SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules provide optimum level of mass transfer during the catalytic activity between SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules and NaBH4. Hence, the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules proved to be the most efficient catalyst in this study inspite of having less surface area than SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5. The obtained less activity with SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 can be described as the fact that the circular morphology gets destroyed due to the presence of high concentration of isopropanol in the solution and SEM analysis gives the evidence for this results. Due to the structural deformation in SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5, the potential catalytic active sites may get covered with the PVDF polymer. Not only the covered active sites but slightly enhanced wall thickness of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-4 and SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-5 is also responsible for the poor activity compared to SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules. Of course these catalysts are able to produce equivalent amount of hydrogen but they required more reaction time due to the high wall thickness. Literature review suggests that PVDF-NiB capsules used as catalyst for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 generated 140 mL of hydrogen and displayed constant values after 200 min [37]. This shows that, our microcapsules exhibited better activity and generated higher amount of hydrogen in lesser reaction time as compared to PVDF-NiB capsules. On scrutinizing and studying the amount of hydrogen generated by all the catalysts, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was optimized for further reactions. Furthermore, the amount of hydrogen generated and TON depend on the acidic sites present in the catalyst. The number of acidic sites was calculated using acid-base titration with phenolphthalein as indicator and followed as per the procedure described in the literature [18]. TON was calculated as the mmol of H2 formed/mmol of acidic sites per gram of catalyst taken. Therefore, 7.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 which was operated at room temperature produced 570 mL of hydrogen volume and showed a TON of 67.73."
15,Effect of catalyst loading (SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3),"4.2 Effect of catalyst loading (SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3) The effect of catalyst loading in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 was investigated by employing 0 wt%, 2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 7.5 wt% and 10 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, keeping all other reaction parameters constant at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 9(b), initially to determine the catalyst role in the present reaction, neat reaction or reaction without catalyst (0 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3) was performed. The neat reaction generated 42.5 mL hydrogen in 35 min reaction duration and later on reaction became saturated and no hydrogen production was seen thereafter. The poor yield of hydrogen generation can be justified as the absence of catalyst retarded the hydrolysis reaction and we observed very poor activity. In next step, under the same reaction conditions, 2.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was used for the hydrolysis reaction. As soon as the catalyst came in contact with NaBH4 solution, hydrogen generation rate became faster. Upon the increase in the amount of catalyst from 0 wt% to 2.5 wt%, the amount of hydrogen produced increased to 571.5 mL in 230 min of reaction time. On further increment of the catalyst amount to 5 wt%, 660 mL of hydrogen was generated in 270 min after which the reaction achieved saturation. However, the reaction showed similar kinetics when compared with 2.5 wt% catalyzed reaction. The drawback of this reaction was that the reaction proceeded at a slow rate and took longer reaction time for saturation. Furthermore, when we increased the catalyst amount to 7.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3, 570 mL of hydrogen was generated in just 180 min of reaction time. When we compared the results of all catalyst loadings, 7.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 showed fast kinetics in this study. Further increment of catalyst amount from 7.5 wt% to 10 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 showed 663 mL of hydrogen generation in 230 min. Although, 10 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 showed good results but it consumed a large amount catalyst as well as reaction time to get saturated. From overall catalyst loading study, it can be seen that, increasing the amount of catalyst loading from 0 to 10 wt%, the hydrogen generation yield successively increased. These results also suggested that hydrogen generation rate as well as reaction time can be tuned by controlling the catalyst amount used in the hydrolysis reaction. However, the obtained reaction kinetics for 7.5 wt% is faster compared to other catalyst loading reaction. Therefore, 7.5 wt% is considered as best amount of catalyst loading under selected reaction conditions and well thought-out to be optimum in this study."
16,Effect of different reaction temperature on hydrogen generation rate,"4.3 Effect of different reaction temperature on hydrogen generation rate Temperature studies are of foremost importance to analyze the promoting effect of the hydrogen evolution in the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Fig. 9(c) illustrates the effect of temperature for SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyzed hydrolysis of NaBH4 carried out in the temperature range from 25 to 90 °C using 0.5 g NaBH4 and 7.5 wt% of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. Initially, at room temperature, the production of hydrogen gas was 570 mL at 180 min and thereafter remained constant. At 50 °C, the production of hydrogen gas was 1105.5 mL at 123 min. The increase in temperature increased the reaction kinetics in the reaction vessel, thereby accelerating the reaction between H2O and NaBH4. When hydrolysis reaction was subjected to a higher temperature of 60 °C, the plot of amount of hydrogen versus time proceeded linearly and 1279 mL of hydrogen was generated in 140 min. Subsequently, at 70 °C and 80 °C, the rate of reaction increased giving 1207 mL and 1165 mL of hydrogen in 120 min and 80 min respectively. The production of hydrogen gas at 80 °C gave higher amount of hydrogen as compared to other temperatures because of the fast reaction kinetics. As expected, for the next higher temperature as 90 °C, the volume of hydrogen generated increased to 1456 mL in 75 min. This shows that the rate of hydrolysis catalyzed by SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 increased with gradual increase in temperature from 60 to 90 °C, resulting in significant increase in hydrogen generation. Additionally, for each temperature, the volume of hydrogen generated was linearly dependent on the reaction time. Successively, due to high energy consumption at higher temperatures, room temperature was chosen as optimum for further studies in this report. Also, at room temperature, the obtained amount of hydrogen is comparably higher and efficient with our catalyst as compared to reported literature values [38,39]."
17,Effect of basicity on hydrogen generation rate,"4.4 Effect of basicity on hydrogen generation rate As base (NaOH) acts as an inhibitor in the hydrolysis process of NaBH4, the appliance of NaOH is a vital study in all reactions of hydrogen evolution. The effect of basicity on the hydrolysis of NaBH4 was analyzed by varying NaOH concentration. Fig. 9(d) elucidates the amount of hydrogen generated with four different NaOH concentrations in the range of 0 wt%, 1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% under optimized reaction conditions: 7.5 wt% SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyst, 0.5 g NaBH4 in 50 mL of deionized water at room temperature. From the obtained results it shows that the maximum yield of 570 mL was obtained with 0 wt% of NaOH within less reaction time of 196 min after which the reaction got saturated. For 1 wt% of NaOH, the hydrolysis reaction was initiated after 4 min which produced 536.5 mL of hydrogen until 235 min and thereafter remained constant. On increasing the concentration of NaOH from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, the hydrolysis reaction started after 10 min and produced 263.5 mL of hydrogen after 240 min of reaction. With further rise in concentration of NaOH to 10 wt%, the hydrolysis started after 12 min and the hydrogen generation volume greatly decreased to only 76 mL of hydrogen gas after 180 min. The trends suggested that with increase in NaOH concentration, the volume of hydrogen generated decreased. NaOH overloading potentially decreased the solubility of sodium metaborate by-product which resultantly caused blockage of active sites on catalyst surface [39]. Amusingly, we observed all reactions did not start immediately after coming in contact with NaBH4. This initial delay was observed in all NaOH concentrations possibly due to pore diffusion resistance."
18,Effect of reducing agent (NaBH4) concentration,"4.5 Effect of reducing agent (NaBH4) concentration The effect of NaBH4 concentration using SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyst was also examined for hydrogen generation by hydrolysis of NaBH4. A set of experiments were conducted for hydrolysis reaction by varying initial substrate concentration of NaBH4 with 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 g at room temperature. In all the experiments, catalyst concentration was kept constant at 7.5 wt%. The results obtained are summarized in Fig. 10(a). The graph illustrates the plot for the amount of hydrogen generated with respect to time, wherein the amount of hydrogen production increases, with gradual increase in the concentration of NaBH4. Initially, 0.4 g of NaBH4 gave 550 mL of hydrogen whereas 0.5 g of NaBH4 gave 570 mL of hydrogen. On further promoting the NaBH4 concentration to 0.6 g and 0.7 g, 700 mL and 950 mL of hydrogen was produced, respectively. Thus, the obtained results suggest that increase in the concentration of NaBH4, increased the production of hydrogen, because higher concentration of NaBH4 molecules leads to the release of more hydrogen molecules. Similar observations were reported by Xu et al. [40]. By considering atom economy as one of the aspect, 0.5 g of NaBH4 was considered for all set of experiments which gave total volume 570 mL. From the obtained results it shows that the reaction can be controlled by NaBH4 concentration."
19,Determination of activation energy and reaction rate,"4.6 Determination of activation energy and reaction rate To further support kinetic studies, the activation energy for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 catalyzed by SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was studied by using Arrhenius equation: K = A . e − Ea / RT where K is hydrogen generation rate (L min−1 g−1), A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy (kJ mol−1), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1) and T is the solution temperature (K). By the effect of different temperatures data, Fig. 10(b) shows the temperature dependent Arrhenius plot of ln(K) versus 1/T. From the slope of the line, the activation energy of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyzed NaBH4 hydrolysis was calculated to be 10.908 kJ mol−1. This indicates that lower the activation energy faster will be the rate of reaction. According to the literature survey, the prepared SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyst showed much lower Ea than previously reported catalytic systems [40,41]. Additionally, the negative slope in the plot indicates a first order reaction. With the progress of the reaction, the rate changes with change in NaBH4 concentration in the reaction mixture. In continuation, as the rate depends only on one component (NaBH4), it can be confirmed that the reaction belongs to first order kinetics [42]. Hence, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsule is an immensely competent catalyst for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of NaBH4."
20,Comparison of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 results with other reported catalysts,"4.7 Comparison of SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 results with other reported catalysts The catalytic activity of the sulfonic acid functionalized PVA/PVDF composite hollow microcapsules catalyzed hydrolysis reaction was also compared with the reported heterogeneous and polymeric materials catalyzed hydrolysis reaction at room temperature by using water displacement method. Their corresponding activation energies were also compared with the present catalytic system as shown in Table 2 . Obtained results for SPVA/PVDF composite hollow microcapsules showed notably higher activity and low activation energy than that of other solid catalysts reported in literature. Hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution using the polymer stabilized Co (0) nano clusters produced 350 mL of hydrogen with a calculated Ea of 63 ± 2 kJ mol−1 (Table 2, Entry 1) [15]. The carbon supported cobalt catalyst (250 mg) and Co-Ni-P-B (15 mg) catalyst in the hydrogen gas production by NaBH4 generated 225 mL and 100 mL, respectively. Their Ea's were seen to be 44.1 kJ mol−1 and 29 ± 1 kJ mol−1 as shown in (Table 2, Entries 2–3) [40,43]. On considering another set of metal based and polymer based catalyst for the production of hydrogen gas, Co-B-TiO2 (100 mg) and PVDF/PEG/EDGMA/IL (35 mg) produced almost equal amount of 370 mL and 380 mL hydrogen, with calculated Ea's as 30.93 kJ mol−1 and 37.86 kJ mol−1, respectively (Table 2, Entries 4–5) [16,41]. There was ambiguity seen in the case of metal-based CoP catalyst and Co-Mo-Pd-B amorphous catalyst (10 mg), where both catalysts were involved in the production of hydrogen gas by NaBH4 at room temperature and produced 50 mL and 480 mL of hydrogen volume, respectively. However, they showed comparable Ea 's of 27.9 kJ mol−1 and 36.36 kJ mol−1 (Table 2, Entries 6–7) [38,39]. We also took into account metal supported catalysts for comparison of hydrogen generation by the hydrolysis of NaBH4. The CoB/SiO2 (200 mg) and Co/γ-Al2O3 (50 mg) catalysts participated in the production of hydrogen gas by using alkaline NaBH4 solution at room temperature and produced 325 mL and 245 mL of hydrogen volume. Chen et al. did not report Ea for the CoB/SiO2 catalyst system. Using Co/γ-Al2O3 as catalyst, Ea of 32.63 kJ mol−1 was reported (Table 2, Entries 8–9) [44,45]. In the hydrolysis of NaBH4, the polymeric catalysts like PEG stabilized iron (0) nano clusters (25 mM Fe) produced 140 mL of hydrogen volume at room temperature and showed Ea of 37 ± 0.2 kJ mol−1 (Table 2, Entry 10) [10]. Literature survey shows the hydrogen gas production by using NaBH4 solution with the catalyst as Ru/IR-120 as catalyst at room temperature gave 100 mL of hydrogen volume and Ea of 49.72 kJ mol−1 (Table 2, Entry 11) [46]. In the present work, we prepared five different sulfonic acid functionalized PVA/PVDF composite microcapsules. These microcapsules were involved in the production of hydrogen gas by using NaBH4 and produced 477, 525, 570, 389.5 and 190 mL of hydrogen volume at room temperature, respectively (Table 2, Entries 12–16). In these microcapsules, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 gave comparatively better results and low activation energy of 10.91 kJ mol−1 compared to other reported heterogeneous catalysts, because of more hollowness and high porosity."
21,Reusability test,"4.8 Reusability test The reusability of heterogeneous catalysts play a vital role in determining the versatility of the catalysts used for catalytic reactions [47–51]. A recyclability reaction using SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyst was performed for 10 cycles and the obtained results are represented in Fig. 11 . To perform the recyclability experiments, the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 composite microcapsules were removed from the reaction mixture after the first cycle of hydrolysis of NaBH4. The heterogeneous SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules used as catalyst for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 could be quickly separated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration and subsequently washed with equal amount of distilled water followed by methanol. The washed microcapsules were dried for 12 h at 90 °C in the hot air oven. After that, the recovered SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 was used for another cycle of fresh hydrolysis of NaBH4 under the optimized reaction conditions and the same procedure was repeated for 9 consecutive cycles. Fig. 11(a) shows the results of ten successive reaction results with catalyst SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 under optimized reaction condition. The result reveals that, there is no significant loss in catalytic activity observed before and after 10th reaction cycle. Later on, to determine the morphological and chemical changes in recycled catalyst after 10th reaction cycle, catalyst was characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR analysis ( Fig. 11 (b-e)). Based on the analysis results, it was revealed that there are no noticeable changes in the morphological as well as chemical behaviour of the SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 catalyst. Additionally, XRD, FT-IR and SEM results showed that all characteristics peaks belong to the pristine SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. Hence, we believed that, the prepared SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 microcapsules showed high catalytic activity and maintained its initial activity for up to 10 successive cycles without loss in physiochemical property as well catalytic activity."
22,Conclusions,"SPVA/PVDF composite microcapsules were successfully synthesized and characterized in the present work, in which five different types of hollow microcapsules were prepared by using different ratios of isopropanol and water solvent system. The prepared microcapsules were applied as catalyst successfully for the hydrogen generation through the hydrolysis process. Due to high porosity, hollow structure and less wall thickness, SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3 showed best results for hydrogen production and 570 mL of hydrogen generation was obtained at room temperature in 180 min. Consequently, various reaction parameters such as effect of different catalyst and its loading, effect of different temperatures, NaBH4 concentration and effect of basicity was carried out using SPVA/PVDF-Mcs-3. Results showed that 7.5 wt% of catalyst loading, 0.5 g of NaBH4 in 50 mL of deionized water at room temperature delivered the highest 570 mL of hydrogen with a TON of 67.73. Hence, these were considered to be the optimized reaction conditions. Meanwhile, from the Arrhenius graph, activation energy was calculated and found be 10.91 kJ mol−1. These prepared microcapsules have an imperative advantage that these can easily be recovered and reused for up to 10 cycles without any considerable loss in the catalytic activity and morphology. We believe that, the high yield hydrogen production, lower activation energy and recyclability character of these prepared catalysts surely attract the scientific attention not only for the hydrogen generation process but also for other catalytic applications."
