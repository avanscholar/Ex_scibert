0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is considered as a promising fuel for the future. 1D TiO2 nanomaterials have shown significant potential in producing H2 because of their high electron mobility, large SSA and high mechanical strength [1–5]. Producing 1D TiO2 using the alkaline hydrothermal method is a relatively facile process with advantages of large-scale production and varied crystal phase [1,2,4–11]. In studies employing the hydrothermal method, 1D TiO2 nanomaterials containing anatase [1,12] or TiO2-B [10,11] were produced under selected synthesis conditions. These materials have been utilized to produce H2 from the photocatalytic splitting of water or from other substrates such as ethanol [10,13]. In comparison to TiO2 nanoparticles, studies have reported improved H2 production from ethanol under UV light conditions when employing 1D TiO2 [10,13]. Hydrothermal synthesis factors such as reaction temperature and the TiO2-to-NaOH molar ratio can significantly affect the 1D TiO2 phase structure, crystal size, specific surface area (SSA) [2,3,6,14] and, subsequently, the H2 production rate. However, the impact of hydrothermal synthesis factors on the 1D TiO2 photocatalytic H2 production rate and optimization of the hydrothermal conditions have not been addressed in previous studies. Photocatalytic production of H2 and other fuels is affected by phase structure, crystal size, SSA, bandgap [15–17], band edge positions [17,18], charge transfer [19], material stability [20,21], cocatalyst [22–25], availability [26], complementary metal oxide semiconductor [27,28] and toxicity [26]. Substrates such as water [19,29] and ethanol [24] have been used to produce H2 using photocatalysts. Other electron donors (EDs) employed to produce H2 utilizing TiO2 under UV light conditions include methanol, 1,2,3 propanetriol and glucose [30]. After absorbing photons, photocatalysts generates and separates electrons (e−) and holes (h+). Next, the photogenerated electrons reduce H+ to generate H2. The water splitting reaction is described in the following half-cell reactions (Eqs. (1) and (2)) [26]: (1) 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 p h o t o c a t h o d e (2) H 2 O + 2 h + → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + p h o t o a n o d e In the presence of a sacrificial ED [30,31] such as ethanol, the photogenerated holes react with the ED and subsequently, the recombination of electrons and holes in photocatalyst are suppressed [30,31]. This suppression process significantly increases the H2 production rate as well as photocatalytic stability [30,31]. The photoanode water splitting half reaction is as follows (Eq. (3)) [24,32]: (3) C H 3 C H 2 O H + 2 h + → 2 H + + C H 3 C H O p h o t o a n o d e Ethanol, a renewable fuel produced mainly from corn, with a specific heating value of approximately 29.7 MJ kg−1 is less when compared to H2 with a specific heating value of approximately 141.8 MJ kg-1 [33]. In addition, the decomposition of ethanol a high H2 production rate and quantum efficiency has been reported by Zhang et al. [34]. Hence, H2 with a larger energy content is preferred when compared to ethanol as a fuel source. The first objective of this study was to employ an alkaline hydrothermal method to synthesize 1D TiO2 photocatalysts under variable reaction conditions. The second objective was to employ a three-factor and three-level Box Behnken design (BBD) to evaluate the effects of selected hydrothermal process conditions (reaction temperature, the NaOH concentration and the TiO2 precursor concentration) on the photocatalytic 1D TiO2 H2 production rate. The third objective was to optimize the hydrothermal conditions and synthesize 1D TiO2 with a maximum H2 production rate using the BBD model. The final objective was to decorate the optimized BBD TiO2 catalyst with Pt and Au noble metals and investigate the photocatalytic H2 production using ethanol, methanol, formic acid and 1,2,3 propanetriol."
1,Experimental,"Commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) were purchased from Degussa (Evonik Industries, Germany). NaOH (97% purity), ethanol (95% purity), HAuCl4 (99.9% purity), (99.5% purity), methanol (99.8% purity), formic acid (95% purity), 1,2,3 propanetriol (99.5% purity), F-doped SnO2-coated (FTO) glass, and HCl (37 wt%) were purchased from Fischer Scientific (Ontario, Canada). Polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 20,000), an Alfa-Aesar product, was purchased from Fischer Scientific (Ontario, Canada)."
2,Preparation of the 1D nanometric TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.1 Preparation of the 1D nanometric TiO2 photocatalyst 1D TiO2 samples were prepared using the alkaline hydrothermal route [10,12]. Briefly, TiO2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide TiO2 P25, Evonik Corporation, Parsippany, New Jersey) were added into 70 mL of a NaOH solution. The TiO2 concentration and the NaOH concentration used in the study are shown in Table 1 . The mixture (total volume 70 mL) was poured into a 100-mL Teflon® capped container. The Teflon® container was placed into a stainless-steel bomb, capped then heated at desired temperature for 48 h and subsequently, cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was centrifuged and washed with 0.1 M HCl solution. The white paste was repeatedly washed with deionized water until pH = 7 and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h to produce 1D TiO2 nanomaterials. The hydrothermal conditions for temperature, NaOH concentration and TiO2 concentration (Table 1) were based on previous research [14]."
3,Characterization studies,"2.2 Characterization studies The 1D TiO2 photocatalyst morphology was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL, Japan) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (300 kV, JEOL 3010, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, MI) equipped with Cu K∂ radiation source. An Alpha300 RA argon laser Raman spectrometer (WITec, Germany) with an excitation wavelength set at 532 nm was used to conduct the Raman studies. UV–vis spectra analysis was recorded on a Cary 300 UV–vis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument, Norcross, GA) was used to obtain nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. The BET SSA for each sample is provided in Table 2 ."
4,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Photocatalytic experiments were conducted using quartz tubes (25 mm ID × 250 mm length) (Technical Glass Products Inc., Painesville, OH) sealed with aluminum crimp caps and Teflon® lined rubber septa. All reaction conditions were examined in triplicate conditions. The sealed photocatalytic reaction tubes were irradiated with a 300-nm UV light source (LZC-UVB-016 lamp, Luzchem, ON, Canada) as described in a previous study by Ray et al. [35]. The average intensity of UV irradiance was 9 mW·cm−2. The reaction mixture was stirred to maintain the photocatalyst in suspension, minimize particle agglomeration and mass transfer limitation. The reactor temperature was maintained at 37 ± 2 °C. The 50-mL reaction mixture contains 0.2 g L−1 of the photocatalyst and 20% (v/v) ethanol as the ED. The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen (N2) gas to remove oxygen. Next, the reaction mixture was ultrasonicated and magnetically stirred under dark condition for 1 h before initiation with UV light. Next, the reaction mixture was exposed to UV light and maintained at 37 ± 2 °C. At specific time intervals, headspace samples were collected and the H2 concentration was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC) (Varian CP-3800). The GC was configured with a 2 m long x 2 mm I.D. Carbon Shin Column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at 200 °C. The oven and injector temperatures were set at 200 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas at a flowrate of 15 mL·min−1. The GC detection limit was approximately 310 umol·L−1 for H2. The photocatalyst reaction mixture was irradiated for 5 h using a 300-nm monochromatic UV light source. The irradiation area for reaction mixture in each tube was 58 cm2. The H2 production rate (μmol·h−1) for each sample is shown in Table 2. The quantum efficiency ( ε ) was calculated using Eqs. (4) and (5) [36]. (4) N = E λ h c = 9 × 10 - 3 × 58 × 3600 × 300 × 10 - 9 6.626 × 10 - 34 × 3 × 10 8 = 2.83 × 10 21 (5) ε = 2 × t h e n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d h y d r o g e n m o l e c u l e s t h e n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % = 2 × 6.02 × 10 23 × H 2 p r o d u c t i o n r a t e × 1 h 2.83 × 10 21 × 100 % Where N is the photon number in 1 h; E is the energy rate of incident photons; λ is the wavelength in nm; h is Planck’s constant; and c is the photon velocity. Additional photocatalytic H2 production experiments were conducted using solar irradiation (310–800 nm) (LZC-VIS-016, Luzchem, ON, Canada) with average intensity of 2 mW·cm−2. Other EDs examined in the study included 20% (v/v) methanol, 20% (v/v) formic acid and 20% (v/v) 1,2,3 propanetriol."
5,Optimization study,"2.4 Optimization study The experimental design was based on a 3-factor and 3-level Box-Behnken design (BBD) [37]. The experimental design was used to optimize key process factors (Table 1) to improve the H2 production rate with using ethanol as the ED. A total of 15 experimental points (#1 to #15) were conducted with each condition under triplicate (Table 2). Experiments, designated as #13, #14 and #15, were conducted as central points to evaluate the magnitude of the error in the study. The experimental factors and H2 production rate (Y) (response variable) were modeled using Minitab 15 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) to fit a full quadratic equation (Eq. (6)): (6) Y = а 0 + ∑ i = 1 3 а i X i + ∑ i = 1 3 а i i X i 2 + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ i < j = 2 3 а i j X i X j where Xi’s are input variables which influence the response variable Y, аo is an offset term, аi is the ith linear coefficient, аii is the quadratic coefficient, and аij is the ijth interaction coefficient. The X1, X2 and X3 represent the synthesis temperature, NaOH concentration and TiO2 concentration, respectively (Table 2). The quadratic model was employed to predict reaction conditions which produced 1D TiO2 with a maximum H2 production rate. A D-optimality analysis [38] was performed to find optimal conditions for the three factors under consideration (maximize the H2 production rate). The coefficient values for fitting the full quadratic model were determined using the H2 production rate and a multiple regression analysis. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using the observed responses for samples #1 to #15) (Table 2). Only significant terms with p values < 0.05 were included into the model. A normal distribution plot together with the Anderson-Darling (AD) [35] test was used to determine the adequacy of the model."
6,TiO2 photocatalyst decorated with Au and Pt nanoparticles,"2.5 TiO2 photocatalyst decorated with Au and Pt nanoparticles The TiO2 photocatalyst sample was decorated with Au nanoparticles based on work by Pu et al. [39]. 1D TiO2 (500 mg of optimized 1D TiO2 synthesized at 126 °C, 15 M NaOH and 49 g L−1 TiO2) was first dispersed in the reaction mixture consisting of 500 mL deionized water and 250 mL ethanol followed by the addition of 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution. The mixture was heated to 50 °C, followed by addition of 6 mL of a 5 mM HAuCl4 solution. Ethanol was used as a reducing agent to facilitate Au growth. The mixed solution was maintained at 50 °C for 3 h with vigorous stirring. The product (Au-decorated 1D TiO2 with the Au content of 2 wt%) was filtered, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C in air for 12 h. For the Pt-decorated 1D TiO2 with a Pt content of 2 wt%, a similar procedure was employed with using H2PtCl6 as Pt source and UV light was used to assist in the reduction of H2PtCl6 to Pt."
7,Results and discussion,
8,1D TiO2 morphology,"3.1 1D TiO2 morphology Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images for selected 1D TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 1 . 1D structures (nanorods and nanowires) with large differences in the diameter and length were characteristic of TiO2 synthesized under different reaction conditions. Nanorods morphology with lengths ranging from 20 nm to 100 nm and a diameter of approximately 10 nm were observed in sample #1 (Fig. 1a) synthesized at 120 °C and with 5 M NaOH plus 43 g L−1 TiO2 (Fig. 1e). Lattice fringes observed with 0.35 nm spacing (Fig. 1e) indicate the presence of anatase in the 1D TiO2 structure (sample #1) [40]. Increasing reaction temperatures and NaOH concentrations caused increasing length, increasing diameter and phase structure changes. Nanowire morphology with lengths reaching 3 μm and diameter ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm was observed for sample #4 (synthesized at 190 °C, 15 M and 43 g L−1) (Fig. 1b). The FESEM image for sample #8 (190 °C, 10 M and 100 g L−1) (Fig. 1c) indicated nanowires with lengths in the micrometer range. The wide distribution of diameter for sample #8 was variable from 10 nm to hundreds of nanometers. The lattice fringes of with 0.62 nm spacing (Fig. 1f) indicate the TiO2 nanowire (sample #8) consisted of the TiO2-B phase [41]. The FESEM image for sample #9 (150 °C, 5 M and 14 g L−1) (Fig. 1d) indicated nanowires with lengths in the hundreds of nanometers range. Lowering the temperature as well as lower NaOH concentration levels were linked to smaller diameter and decreasing crystal size (sample #1). In comparison, higher temperatures and NaOH concentrations were associated with larger diameter (Sample # 6 and 8), increasing length (sample #9) and increasing crystal size. The FESEM images provided evidence showing the hydrothermal synthesis factors significantly impacted the 1D TiO2 diameter and crystal size. The formation of 1D TiO2 nanostructures was controlled by shearing, exfoliation, delamination of lamellar nanosheets and scrolling lamellar nanosheets into 1D structure [42,43]."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Significant differences in H2 production were observed for 1D TiO2 samples prepared using different reaction conditions. Hydrogen production versus time profiles are shown in Fig. 2 a for BBD sample #3 plus the P25 control. Control experiments were conducted employing with and without P25 nanoparticles. The mean H2 production rate (Y value) was 0 μmol h−1 without a photocatalyst; however, with the addition of P25 nanoparticles, the mean production rate increased to 235 ± 8 μmol·h−1. In comparison, the production rate of 463 ± 14 μmol·h−1 ( ε = 19.3 ± 0.6 % ) for sample #3 (synthesized at 120 °C, 15 M NaOH and 43 g L−1 TiO2) was approximately 2-fold larger than P25 ( ε = 10.0 ± 0.4 % ) using ethanol as the ED. Notice sample #3 was characteristic with nanorods structure of approximately 10 nm diameter (Fig. 2b). The ε value for the Pt-TiO2 catalyst was 5-fold greater than the ε value for TiO2 when employing pure water as a substrate under UV light conditions. The photocatalytic H2 production rate showed an approximate 110-fold increase using 20 v/v% ethanol as the ED when compared to using water (Fig. S1). The H2 production rates are listed in Table 2. The effect of ethanol concentration on H2 production rate was evaluated (Fig. S1). For various ethanol concentrations tested, the highest H2 production rate was observed for a 20 v/v% aqueous ethanol solution."
10,Modeling and effects of factors on the H2 production rate (response variable) for ethanol,"3.3 Modeling and effects of factors on the H2 production rate (response variable) for ethanol For the response surface optimization study, three sets (replicates) of 15 experiments were conducted to compute the H2 production rate under 15 conditions (Table 2). A multiple regression analysis was used to develop a full quadratic Eq. (7) which describes the H2 production rate, Y, as a function of the hydrothermal process conditions. (7) Y = - 2964 + 34.28 X 1 + 124.34 X 2 + 8.55 X 3 - 0.7 X 1 X 2 + 0.006 X 1 X 3 - 0.239 X 2 X 3 - 0.096 X 1 2 - 0.269 X 2 2 - 0.058 X 3 2 where Y is the H2 production rate (μmol·h−1), X1, X2 and X3 represent the reaction temperature (oC), NaOH concentration (M) and TiO2 concentration (g·L−1), respectively. The relationship between the synthesis factors, phase structure and the H2 production rate is shown in the 3D surface plots and the corresponding contour plots (Fig. 3 ). Interaction between the temperature and the NaOH concentration (Fig. 3a and b) suggests that both parameters significantly affected the 1D TiO2 phase structure and the H2 production rate (Fig. S2). A relatively low temperature at 120 °C and a high NaOH concentration at 15 M were closely associated with producing a pure anatase catalyst with a high H2 production rate. Increasing temperatures or decreasing NaOH concentrations were correlated with decreasing H2 production rates. The biphasic anatase-rutile structure, synthesized at 120 °C and 5 M NaOH, was linked to a lower H2 production rate. In addition, a significant decrease in the H2 production rate was observed for the biphasic anatase-TiO2-B structure which was synthesized at 190 °C and with ≥10 M NaOH. These observations indicate the rutile and TiO2-B phases are closely correlated with decreasing photocatalytic H2 production. Interaction between temperature and TiO2 concentration (Fig. 3c and d) and interaction between NaOH concentration and TiO2 concentration (Fig. 3e and f) confirmed decreasing the synthesis temperature and increasing the NaOH concentration were closely associated with increasing the H2 production rate. In addition, the surface and contour plots indicate the optimum H2 production rate was obtained with a TiO2 concentration of approximately 50 g L−1. The D-optimality index was used to locate the maximum response (Y) region within the factor space under consideration (Fig. S3). A maximum response of 470 μmol h−1 was predicted for 1D TiO2 synthesized at 126 °C, 15 M NaOH and 49 g L−1 TiO2. Additional experiments were conducted to verify the maximum response when using the 1D TiO2 photocatalyst under the predicted conditions. The predicted value was slightly underestimated when compared to the observed response of 475 ± 12 μmol·h-1 (ε = 20.2 ± 0.5%). Recall, pure anatase with a mean crystal size of 20.1 ± 0.2 nm and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) SSA of 140 ± 3 m2 g−1 was observed for 1D TiO2 synthesized under optimum conditions. The opitimum H2 production rate value was approximately 2-fold larger when compared to commercial P25 when employing a 20 v/v% ethanol feed. This H2 production rate was significantly improved when compared to reported production rates of 348 μmol h−1 for biphasic anatase-TiO2-B [10]. The optimum H2 production rate of 470 μmol h−1 for the optimized 1D TiO2 was normalized to a mass basis. The specific H2 production rate (per g of photocatalyst) attained was 23,500 μmol h−1 g−1. The maxmum specific H2 production rate was significantly enhanced when compared to data reported for pure anatase, pure rutile, flame spray pyrolysis-synthesised TiO2 and Au/TiO2 [44]."
11,Response surface model development,"3.4 Response surface model development An analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table S1) of the model full quadratic Eq. (7) was employed to determine the significance and adequacy of the model. The quadratic model with an overall p-value ≤ 0.05 [37,38,45,46] and a F-value ≤ to the critical value (2.01 at 5% level of significance) [37,38,45,46] indicate the model was statistically significant. However, two variables ( X 2 2 and X 1 X 3 ) with p-value ≥ 0.05 were statistically insignificant with no individual effect on the full quadratic model. These terms were deleted from model using a backward elimination method [38]. The revised response surface model is designated as Eq. (8): (8) Y = - 2974 + 34.43 X 1 + 118.96 X 2 + 9.40 X 3 - 0.7 X 1 X 2 - 0.239 X 2 X 3 - 0.095 X 1 2 - 0.058 X 3 2 where Y is the H2 production rate (μmol·h−1), X 1 , X 2 and X 3 represent temperature (oC), NaOH concentration (M) and TiO2 concentration (g·L−1), respectively."
12,Response surface model verification,"3.5 Response surface model verification A scatter plot comparing the experimental and the model predicted values (Fig. 4 a) indicate a reasonable correlation at each level. The Anderson-Darling (AD) statistic (Fig. 4b) was employed to assess the adequacy of fitting the model to the experimental data by determining the normal distribution of the residuals (difference between the predicted and experimental values) [47]. An AD value of 0.379 (≤ the critical value of 0.735 for 45 samples and at a 5% level of significance) [47] and a p-value of 0.391 (≥ 0.05) suggest the model’s predicted valued correlated with the experimental values. Validation of the model accuracy was examined by varying a single factor in three additional experiments (Fig. 5 ). The model predicted trend was comparable to the experimental trend for varying each factor. For a temperature range from 120 to 190 °C (Fig. 5a), the model predicted values were close to the experimental values with a slight overestimate at each temperature level. For the NaOH concentration (Fig. 5b), the predicted values were in agreement with the experimental data with a slight overestimate at 5 M NaOH. For the TiO2 concentration, the model predicted values which were reasonably close to the observed values for each level of TiO2 concentration with a slight underestimate at 100 g L−1 TiO2 and a slight overestimate at 14 and 43 g L−1 (Fig. 5c). Additional experiments (Table S2) were conducted to compare the model predicted value and experimental value. The results indicate the model’s predicted values correlated with the experimental values."
13,"Phase structure, crystal size and bandgap energies","3.6 Phase structure, crystal size and bandgap energies XRD analysis and diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy were used to evaluate the phase structure, crystal size and bandgap energy for the BBD samples. The XRD patterns for selected BBD samples #1, #3 and #8 are shown in Fig. 6 a and the phase structure is summarized in Table 3 for all the samples. The three phase structures observed in this study included pure anatase [48], biphasic anatase-rutile [49–51] and the biphasic anatase-TiO2-B [10] structures (Fig. 6a). The biphasic anatase-rutile structure, similar to that in P25, was only detected in sample #1 [49–51] (Fig. S4), while pure anatase phase and the biphasic anatase-TiO2-B structures were observed in a majority of the samples. The mean crystal sizes (L, nm) for sample #1-15 (Table 2) were calculated using the Scherrer equation (Eq. 9) and XRD data [52]. (9) L = Kλ/β.cosθ where K, λ and β represent the shape factor (0.89), the wavelength of XRD radiation (0.154 nm) and the half maximum of a full peak, respectively. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopic profiles for selected BBD samples are shown in Fig. S5. All the BBD samples with an optical absorption below 400 nm was likely caused by their band-band electron transition [49,53]. The diffuse reflectance spectra was transformed into corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 6b) using Kubelka-Munk function [54]. The bandgap energy is closely correlated with the phase structure and chemical composition (Table 3). The pure anatase (e.g. sample #3) phase was observed with a large bandgap energy ranging from 3.258 ± 0.003 to 3.298 ± 0.005 eV [55,56], while the biphasic structure anatase-rutile (sample #1) and anatase-TiO2-B (samples #4, #6 and #8) showed decreasing bandgap energies of 3.067 ± 0.006 and values ranging from 3.210 ± 0.007 to 3.229 ± 0.009 eV, respectively. In the Ti2p XPS spectra for sample #1 and the optimized 1D TiO2 (Fig. S6) sample, the two main peaks at 458.9 eV (Ti2p3/2) and 464.5 eV (Ti2p1/2) indicate the presence of Ti4+. In comparison, the deconvoluted peaks located at 457.4 eV (Ti2p3/2) and 463.0 eV (Ti2p1/2) were due to the presence of Ti3+. The low peak intensity attributed to Ti3+ indicate sample #1 and the optimized 1D TiO2 contained a small amount of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy."
14,Effect on phase structure and crystal size,"3.7 Effect on phase structure and crystal size The H2 production rates, crystal size and BET SSA are summarized in Table 3 for the BBD 1D TiO2 samples synthesized under different reaction conditions. Depending on the hydrothermal synthesis conditions, the H2 production rates were variable from 72 ± 4 to 475 ± 12 μmol·h−1. The 1D TiO2 phase structures marked in the 3D response surface plot (Fig. 3a) shows the effect of reaction temperature and NaOH concentration on the phase structure and H2 production rate. The low NaOH concentration (5 M) and reaction temperature (120 °C) were correlated with the biphasic anatase-rutile structure. Increasing NaOH concentration and reaction temperature were related to converting rutile into anatase. In addition, higher NaOH concentrations greater than 10 M coupled with a temperature at 190 °C were associated with the conversion of anatase to TiO2-B. Variation of the phase structures had a main effect on the H2 production rate. The pure anatase (sample #2, #3, #5, #7, #9, #11-15 and the optimized sample synthesized at 126 °C, 15 M NaOH and 49 g L−1 TiO2) were closely linked with increasing the H2 production rate, while the biphasic anatase-rutile (sample #1) and anatase-TiO2-B structures (sample #4, #6 and #8) were associated with decreasing the H2 production rate. The pure anatase samples were correlated with high bandgaps ranging from 3.258 ± 0.003 to 3.298 ± 0.005 eV. However, the biphasic anatase-rutile sample #1 showed the lowest bandgap of 3.067 ± 0.006 eV. The lowest H2 production rate was detected for the biphasic anatase-TiO2-B structure (sample #4, 6 and 8). The biphasic anatase-TiO2-B samples showed decreasing bandgaps ranging from 3.210 ± 0.007 to 3.229 ± 0.009 eV when compared to the pure anatase samples. The I-t curves for sample #1 (biphasic anatase-rutile), #8 (biphasic anatase-TiO2-B), optimized 1D TiO2 (anatase) and P25 with an on-off UV-light irradiation (300 nm) source are shown in Fig. S7. The greatest photocurrent density was observed for the optimized 1D TiO2 containing anatase. This observation suggests the optimized 1D TiO2 is characterized by an enhanced charge carrier transportation and separation. The photocurrent densities for sample #1 and P25 were comparable to each other. The lowest photocurrent density caused by the fast recombination of electrons and holes was detected for sample #8 containing the TiO2-B phase. The H2 production rate − for the pure anatase phase samples (Fig. 7 ) suggests the greatest rate of 475 ± 12 μmol·h-1 was observed when the mean crystal size was 20.1 ± 0.2 nm with BET SSA of 140 ± 3 m2 g−1. Smaller crystal size was closely linked to a larger BET SSA for 1D TiO2 containing anatase. The BET SSA (m2 g−1) as a function of the mean crystal size is shown as Eq. (10). (10) S = 1518 × L - 0.7931 ( 16 ≤ L ≤ 56 a n d R 2 = 95.6 % ) Where S (m2 g−1) and L (nm) represent the BET SSA and the mean crystal size, respectively. Increasing the H2 production rate was closely correlated with decreasing the anatase mean crystal size from 58.3 ± 0.3 to 20.1 ± 0.2 nm. The increasing the H2 production rate was due to increasing the SSA [57] and faster rates of e- and h + surface reactions with the substrate. The optimum anatase mean crystal size of 20.1 ± 0.2 nm was correlated with a maximum H2 production rate. However, note the lower H2 production rate observed below the optimum anatase mean crystal size was caused by fast e−-h+ recombination [57]. A decreasing H2 production rate which was correlated with fast e−-h+ recombination at defective sites on the photocatalyst surface [57]. The significantly great number of defective sites was due to decreasing the crystal size below an optimum value."
15,Noble metal decorating and other alcohol sacrificial agents,"3.8 Noble metal decorating and other alcohol sacrificial agents A significant increase in the H2 production rate was observed when decorating the TiO2 photocatalyst with Au or Pt (Fig. 8 a and b). The catalytic activity of the optimized 1D TiO2 sample synthesized at 126 °C, 15 M NaOH and 49 g L−1 TiO2 was significantly enhanced by adding Au and Pt (Au/optimum or Pt/optimum) when compared to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with Au or Pt (Au/P25 or Pt/P25). The catalytic activity of the optimized 1D TiO2 samples decorated with 2 wt% Au (Au/optimum) and Pt (Pt/optimum) were 1146 ± 26 μmol·h−1 (ε = 48.7 ± 1.1%) and 1823 ± 35 μmol·h−1 (ε = 77.5 ± 1.5%), respectively. These rates were greater than those for other TiO2 substrates decorated with 2 wt% of each metal. The Pt/optimum 1D TiO2 activity was greater when compared to the activity for the Au/optimum 1D TiO2 photocatalyst. The H2 production rate for Pt/optimum was approximately 5-fold greater when compared to the H2 production rate (348 μmol h−1) for TiO2 nanotubes decorated with Pt nanoparticles [10]. Photocatalytic H2 production studies were performed using the Pt/optimized 1D TiO2 catalyst and different EDs (Fig. 8c). The H2 production rates were 1499 ± 34 μmol·h−1 (ε = 63.7 ± 1.4%), 1288 ± 37 μmol·h−1 (ε = 54.8 ± 1.5%) and 710 ± 15 μmol·h−1 (ε = 30.2 ± 0.6%) for methanol, formic acid and 1,2,3 propanetriol, respectively. In addition, under solar light conditions, the low H2 production rate for the Pt/optimum 1D TiO2 photocatalyst of 179 ± 3 μmol·h−1 (ε = 7.6 ± 0.1%) (Fig. 8d) was due to the low irradiation energy and the longer visible light wavelength when compared to only UV light."
16,Conclusion,"1D TiO2 ranging from nanorods to nanowires were produced using a hydrothermal method under variable reaction conditions. The reaction temperature and NaOH concentration significantly affected the 1D TiO2 phase structure, crystal size, SSA, bandgap energy and photocatalytic activity. A statistical model evaluated the effects of the hydrothermal synthesis factors on the photocatalytic activity of 1D TiO2 in terms of the H2 production rate. The AD and validation test indicated an adequate fit of the statistical model to the experimental data under the conditions examined. The model revealed that a relatively low temperature (126 °C) and high NaOH concentration (15 M) were closely linked to producing 1D TiO2 containing pure anatase. This 1D TiO2 sample with an optimum mean crystal size was able to maximize the H2 production rate. The 1D TiO2 with biphasic anatase-rutile and anatase-TiO2-B structures was observed with decreasing photocatalytic H2 production rate. A significant increase in the H2 production rate was observed for the optimized 1D TiO2 photocatalysts decorated with Pt or Au. This study demonstrated that 1D TiO2 containing a controllable phase structure, and crystal size was able to produce a photocatalyst with a H2 production rate greater than reported values."
