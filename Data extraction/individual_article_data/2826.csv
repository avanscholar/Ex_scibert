0,Introduction,"To meet the growing energy demand of humans while mitigating the cumulatively severe environmental contamination and greenhouse gas emissions, clean and renewable energy is urgently demanded [1,2]. Hydrogen is among the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels because it has high calorific value, does not pollute the atmosphere, and is sufficiently abundant [3]. And hydrogen production by the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a reliable technology to efficiently fabricate hydrogen energy [4–6]. Nevertheless, the widespread application of the HER by conventional Pt and Pt-based noble-metal catalysts is restricted by their scarcity and exorbitant cost [7]. Therefore, the exploration of cost-effective electrocatalysts is a prerequisite for the development of sustainable energy. MoS2 is expected to be an alternative to noble-metal catalysts due to its low price and optimal Gibbs adsorption energy [8]. However, the relatively poor conductivity and catalytic inertness of the basal plane for MoS2 severely impede its HER activity. Thus far, it has been shown that the HER catalytic activity of MoS2 can be improved by increasing the number and activity of catalytic sites or by enhancing the intrinsic conductivity of MoS2. There are three general approaches used to improve the catalytic performance of MoS2. Firstly, the catalytic activity of MoS2 is usually proportional to the density of active sites at the edges and defects, therefore the HER activity can be dramatically enhanced by adjusting the morphology and structure of MoS2 samples. Zhang et al. fabricated the dendritic monolayer of MoS2 with many exposed edges and defects, thus providing a large number of active sites [9]. Secondly, controlling phase transition presents significant efficiency in the regulation of the catalytic activity of MoS2 [10,11]. Yu et al. reported a large-scale and high-purity preparation of micro-sized metallic phase (1 T) MoS2 that not only stimulates the intrinsic conductivity of MoS2, but also improves the activity of catalytically inert atoms on the basal plane [12]. Thirdly, activity of the MoS2 catalytic sites can be regulated by modulating the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) of these sites. Deng et al. acquired few-layer Pt-doped MoS2 nanosheets with higher activity than pure MoS2 by tuning the ΔGH of S sites neighboring the doped Pt atoms on the basal plane [13]. Although these technical approaches improve the catalytic capacity of MoS2 to some extent, there are still some unresolved problems at MoS2 catalyzed HER. For example, MoS2 nanostructures are prone to agglomeration resulting in partial coverage of active sites; incomplete conversion from 2H to 1 T leading to insufficient conductivity; and still high production costs when combined with noble metals to form loaded composites. In this work, MoS2 nanosheets were hydrothermally fabricated on the CoP substrate derived from ZIF-67 to overcome the agglomeration and poor conductivity of MoS2. A series of hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-frames was successfully synthesized, exhibiting excellent electrochemical catalytic activity in acidic solution. Among these composites, CoP@ MoS2-75 presented the lowest overpotential (119 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec−1. Meanwhile, both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that electrons are transferred between the two components, and that the strong interaction between CoP and MoS2 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of MoS2."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium molybdate dehydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Nafion (5 wt%) solution and Pt/C (40 wt%) catalyst were purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. 2-methylimidazole was purchased from Tianjin Kemious Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.. All purchased reagents were directly used without purification."
3,Synthesis of hollow CoP substrate,"2.2 Synthesis of hollow CoP substrate The CoP substrate derived from the ZIF-67 material was synthesized in three steps. (1) Preparation of ZIF-67: 5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 40 mmol 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in 100 mL methanol with even stirring. The resulting solutions were labeled A and B, respectively. Solution A was quickly poured into Solution B under agitation and reacted at room temperature (R.T.) for 24 h. The purple powders were obtained by centrifugal collection and drying. (2) Preparation of Co3O4: 200 mg of the ZIF-67 powders were oxidized in a muffle furnace at 300 °C, 350 °C, or 400 °C for 2 h, yielding three intermediates of Co3O4. (3) Preparation of CoP: 30 mg of the as-obtained Co3O4 and 600 mg of sodium hypophosphite were placed on the downstream and upstream of a tube furnace, respectively. After two hours of phosphating at 350 °C in an Ar atmosphere, the CoP powders were obtained. The Co3O4 intermediates and the CoP samples fabricated at 300 °C, 350 °C, or 400 °C were correspondingly labeled as Co3O4-1, Co3O4-2, Co3O4-3 and CoP-1, CoP-2, CoP-3. The most suitable substrate was identified by comparing the performances of the sample, which will be discussed in detail later."
4,Synthesis of hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframe,"2.3 Synthesis of hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframe A certain amount of the final CoP substrate (X mg) was placed in 25 mL deionized water and evenly dispersed by sonication for 20 min. Subsequently, 0.15 g sodium molybdate dihydrate and 0.31 g thiourea as the molybdenum and sulfur sources, respectively, were added to the homogeneous solution. This mixed product was poured into a reactor kettle and reacted for 24 h at 200 °C. After naturally cooling to R.T., the black precipitates were obtained by washing with ethanol and drying under vacuum conditions. The precipitates CoP@MoS2-X with X = 0, 50, 75, and 100 were labeled as MoS2, CoP@MoS2-50, CoP@MoS2-75, and CoP@MoS2-100, respectively."
5,Material characterizations,2.4 Material characterizations The morphologies and structures of the samples were surveyed using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB–SEM) (Zeiss/Auriga) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2100) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the crystallographic features were characterized by a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer. The phases and surface material information of the composites were analyzed by a Renishaw Raman Microscope with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The electronic structures of the elements were investigated by XPS with an AXIS Supra XPS spectrometer.
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical performance of the catalysts were evaluated on a standard three electrode workstation (CHI 660E, Chenhua Instruments). The working, counter, and reference electrodes were glassy carbon (diameter = 3 mm), graphite rod, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively. Following typical methods of catalyst ink preparation, the catalysts (4 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of the mixed solution (VDIW :VEthanol = 3:1) combined with 20 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%), and sonicated for at least one hour to form a homogeneous suspension. Next, 5 μL of the obtained solution containing the catalyst were dripped onto the clean glassy carbon core of the pretreated working electrode. To prevent removal of the catalyst during the evaluation, 4 μL of Nafion alcohol solution (0.5 wt%) was added dropwise to the catalyst surface after drying the catalyst at R.T.. Classically, the catalytic activity of a material is assessed from the polarization curve determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In the present LSV test, the scan range and rate were set to 0 to − 0.5 V (vs. SCE) and 5 mV s−1, respectively. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was implemented at the corresponding open circuit voltage within a 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz frequency window. The electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl ) of each electrocatalyst was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at scan speeds of 20–200 mV s−1. The long-term stabilities of the catalysts were determined in 3000 cycles of the CV test. All electrochemical performances were assessed in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.3), and all potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential as follows: E vs. RHE = E vs. SCE + 0.0592 × pH + 0.241. Moreover, under the EIS conditions, the LSV curves were revised by iR compensation to reduce the impact of the test system on the intrinsic catalytic property of the material."
7,DFT calculation method,"2.6 DFT calculation method The present first-principles DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [14]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was applied for the exchange–correlation functionals [15]. The wave functions were employed in a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. The convergence criterion for the self-consistency process was set to 10-5 eV between two ionic steps. During the structural relaxations, all atoms are fully relaxed until the residual forces on each direction are smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The zero damping DFT–D3 method of Grimme [16] was adopted in describing van der Waals interactions. VASPKIT [17] was used to analyze the calculated results of VASP. A periodic slab model of a monolayer 2H–MoS2 was simulated in a 4 × 4 supercell with a 3 × 3 × 1 k–point mesh, a Co16P16 cluster with the lowest optimized energy was built among its various allotropes to simulate the CoP and construct CoP@MoS2 structures. All the slab models were separated by a vacuum of 20 Å thickness to to ensure decoupling between neighboring slabs. The Gibbs free energy change for each elemental step of the HER was calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model [18] proposed by Nørskov et al., expressed as: Δ G = Δ E + Δ E ZPE - T Δ S Where ΔE, ΔEZPE, and ΔS are the energy obtained directly from DFT calculations, change in zero–point energy, and change in entropy terms, respectively, with temperature T = 298.15 K."
8,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 schematizes the synthetic steps of the hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes. In a typical synthesis, the CoP substrate was fabricated by successive oxidation and phosphorization of ZIF-67. The obtained samples CoP-1, 2, and 3 were fabricated at different oxidation temperatures (300 °C, 350 °C, or 400 °C, respectively). The most appropriate of these as-prepared CoP samples was selected as the MoS2 substrate. The selection criteria were (1) stability of geometric structure and (2) catalytic performance. To properly screen the geometric stability of the substrate, the morphologies of the CoP intermediates (Co3O4) formed at different oxidation temperatures were characterized by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2 (a) and S1(a–c)). Whereas the obtained ZIF-67 displayed a rhombic dodecahedron structure with smooth surfaces (Figure S1(d)), Co3O4 presented a cubic structure with rough and porous surfaces. Interestingly, increasing the oxidation temperature gradually increased the number of voids on the rough surface of Co3O4. The Co3O4 sample prepared at 400 °C retained only the skeleton structure. Unfortunately, this skeleton structure and its phosphatized counterpart (CoP-3) were ultrasonically fragile, structurally unstable, and unsuitable for use as the substrate. As the catalytic ability of the substrate affects the catalytic capacity of the sample, the HER catalytic performances of the CoP samples were also examined. As shown in Figure S2(a) and the corresponding Tafel slopes (Figure S2(b)), the overpotentials of CoP-2 and CoP-3 were much lower than that of CoP-1, which is desired for applications requiring high current density. CoP-2 with the lowest Tafel slope (62 mV dec−1) achieved the highest performance among the three substrates. Based on these considerations, the CoP-2 sample was selected as the CoP substrate (Fig. 2(b)). MoS2 was compounded onto the designated CoP substrate with different dosages, obtaining a series of hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes (CoP@MoS2-50, CoP@MoS2-75, and CoP@MoS2-100). The morphologies and structures of the as-produced samples were characterized using classical SEM and TEM techniques. In SEM analysis, the CoP substrate exhibited a similar morphological profile to Co3O4 (Fig. 2(a, b)), namely, a cubic morphology with a rough and porous surface. After deposition of the same amount of MoS2, the outer layer of the heterostructure changed from dense to sparse with increasing amount of the CoP framework (Fig. 2(d)–(f)). In addition, the outer layers of these heterostructures were less tightly arranged than those of pure MoS2 (Fig. 2(c)), demonstrating that adding the CoP substrate effectively inhibited the self-aggregation phenomenon of MoS2. To obtain more explicit information on the heterostructure, high-resolution (HR) TEM images of the hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframe (represented by CoP@MoS2-75) were acquired and are shown in Fig. 2(g)–(i). Undoubtedly, hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes were successfully synthesized. This subtle and unique externally layered and internally hollow hetero-nanoframe can effectively accelerate the mass and charge transfer in catalytic reactions [19]. As shown in Fig. 2(i), the interplanar distances of nanosheets on the CoP substrate surface is 0.62 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of MoS2 [20]. More significantly, the HRTEM image clarified that the lattice striations of surface MoS2 were discontinuous with deformations and dislocations. Such defects and disorders can be considered as prominent active sites that can greatly enhance the catalytic activity [21,22]. The structures and phase purities of the as-prepared products were investigated by XRD. As shown in Figures S3 and 3(a), the diffraction peaks well matched the simulated XRD pattern of ZIF-67 and standard PDF cards of Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 01–080-1532), CoP (JCPDS No. 29–0497) and MoS2 (JCPDS No. 37–1492) [23,24]. This result confirms the high quality of the synthesized Co3O4, CoP, and MoS2 and their suitability as the components of a heterostructure. In the XRD pattern of CoP@MoS2-75 (Fig. 3 a), five evident diffraction peaks around 31.6°, 36.3°, 46.2°, 48.1°, and 56.7° were assignable to the (011), (111), (112), (211), and (301) crystal facets of CoP, respectively. The characteristic peaks of MoS2 were absent, indicating that the MoS2 nanosheets coated on the CoP were too thin to present diffraction peaks [25]. The presence of MoS2 was checked by surface-sensitive Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra in Fig. 3(b) display prominent peaks at 375 and 401 cm−1, which characterize the E1 2 g and A1g modes of MoS2, respectively [26,27]. These modes represent the in-plane Mo–S bonds and the out-of-plane vibration mode of S atoms, respectively [28–30]. Besides pure MoS2, the Raman spectra confirm a poorly conducting semiconductor phase (2H) in CoP@MoS2-75, which challenges catalytic applications of this material [31]. The present study aimed to improve the catalytic ability of 2H-MoS2, as detailed below. The surface information of the above-mentioned samples was obtained by high-resolution XPS. Fig. 4 (a) displays the high-resolution spectra of C 1s for pure MoS2, CoP, and CoP@MoS2-75, mainly using element calibration at 284.7 eV. The Mo 3d and S 2p XPS results of pure MoS2 and CoP@MoS2-75 are shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (c) of Fig. 4, respectively. In the Mo 3d spectra of MoS2 and CoP@MoS2 (Fig. 4(b)), the two peaks corresponded to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 orbitals of Mo, respectively [32]. Similarly, the pair of main peaks in the S 2p spectra of MoS2 and CoP@MoS2 were classified as 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively [33]. Notably, the binding energies of both Mo 3d and S 2p in CoP@MoS2-75 were shifted from those of pure MoS2, and the Mo and S shifts were approximately consistent (∼1 eV) owing to the existence of Mo–S bonds, which is due to the strong interaction between MoS2 and CoP. Combining these results with the Co 2p and P 2p XPS results in Fig. 4(d), one observes that the binding energy of Co 2p in CoP@MoS2-75 was slightly increased from that of the CoP substrate. Both the binding energy shift and the additional fitting peaks of the Co–S bands in the Mo 3d and S 2p spectra (Fig. 4(b, c)) confirmed an effective bonding interaction between CoP and MoS2, which should greatly promote the HER activity of MoS2. This statement can also be confirmed in the DFT calculation later. It is worth mentioning that, as the detection depth of XPS is several nanometers [34]. and the XPS signatures of CoP were almost undetectable in CoP@MoS2-75 (Fig. 4(e)), it was inferred that MoS2 was uniformly dispersed on the CoP, and that CoP greatly improved the dispersibility of MoS2. The absence of the high-resolution spectra of P 2p for the CoP@MoS2-75 (Fig. 4(e)) indicates a sulfidation reaction on the CoP substrate surface [35–37]. Owing to the many unsaturated ligands at the CoP interface, the substrate surface was easily sulfided during the hydrothermal reaction [38]. These results confirm that CoP interacted with MoS2, influencing the binding energy between the adsorbates and hence affecting the catalytic performance of the composites [39,40]. To evaluate the catalytic property of the as-fabricated hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes, the HER activities were inspected at a loading density of 0.285 mg cm−2. The LSV method most intuitively reflects the hydrogen evolution of materials, and all initial LSV data were corrected with iR compensation to exclude the influence of ohmic resistance on the intrinsic catalysis of the materials [41]. LSV curves of the hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes prepared with different amounts of CoP were smooth and flat (Fig. 5 (a)), exhibiting decent HER performance. Among the series of composites, CoP@MoS2-75 possessed the best catalytic performance with the lowest overpotential (119 mV) and onset potential (69.6 mV) at 10 and 1 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding catalytic data of CoP@MoS2-50 and CoP@MoS2-100 are summarized in Table S(1). The electrocatalytic performances of CoP and MoS2 were evaluated for comparison. Both compounds exhibited poor electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 139 and 323 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(b)). It may be due to the fact that too little CoP is not enough to activate the surface inertness of MoS2, while too much CoP causes the external MoS2 layers to be too thin, weakening the advantage of the layered nanostructure in conducting charge and mass. This result implies that CoP and MoS2 at appropriate ratios promote each other to improve the catalytic activity of the composites. In general, a small Tafel slope denotes fast HER kinetics of the electrocatalytic material and a low overpotential at a given current [42]. Fig. 5 (c) and (d) show the Tafel slopes evolved from the LSV curves. Among the three catalyst, CoP@MoS2-75 exhibited the lowest Tafel slope (49 mV dec−1, Fig. 5(c)), close to that of commercial 40 wt% Pt/C (32 mV dec−1, Fig. 5(d)), and much lower than that of pure MoS2 (148 mV dec−1). This result indicates that the current density of CoP@MoS2-75 increased at a faster rate with increasing overpotential, which can be attributed to facilitation of charge transfer and transmission through the externally layered and internally hollow structure of the composite [43,44]. Moreover, the Tafel slope was directly related to the speed-limiting process of the HER. The Tafel slope of CoP@MoS2-75 approached the theoretical slope of the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction pathway, suggesting a fast pathway and reaction rate toward the HER [33]. Whereas MoS2 exists in the poorly conductive 2H phase, CoP@MoS2-75 exhibited promising catalytic performance, confirming that the CoP substrate can modulate the catalytic ability of MoS2. The interfacial reaction and electron-transfer kinetics were inferred from the EIS curves of the composites and pure CoP, where the series impedances (Rs ) for the iR compensation were supplied (Fig. 5(e)). The charge transfer impedances (Rct ) of all samples were very small (only 1.9 Ω of the CoP@MoS2-50 sample). This result indicates an excessively thick 2H-phase MoS2 with poor intrinsic conductivity on the surface of the CoP substrate, but also guarantees high-speed electron transmission through the CoP substrate and a favorable kinetic process at the catalytic interface in the acidic medium [45]. The long-term stability of CoP@MoS2-75 was inspected in CV cycle tests from − 0.5 to 0 V (vs. SCE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The overpotential increased only by 29 mV after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(f)), much lower than that of the CoP substrate (93 mV) under the same circumstances (Figure S(4)). Based on the above analysis and discussion, the excellent catalytic activity and catalytic stability achieved by CoP@MoS2-75 was attributable to the delicate externally layered and internally hollow nanostructure, and the appropriate amount of CoP greatly enhanced the catalytic ability of MoS2. Other factors affecting the HER performance of catalysts and the electrochemically active surface area of the catalysts were also determined from the CV curves (Fig. 6 (a) and S7). The Cdl value, which reflects the effective area of an electrocatalyst, is obtained by dividing half of the difference between the anodic and cathode current densities at 0.318 V (vs. RHE) by the scan rate [46]. The Cdl values of all composites were significantly improved from that of pure CoP (2.05 mF cm−2) (Fig. 6(b)). The CoP@MoS2-75 composite yielded an especially high Cdl (10.28 mF cm−2). It was concluded that the composites have larger effective catalytic area and more abundant catalytic active sites than the single component. DFT calculations were performed to explore the origin of the intrinsic HER activity of CoP@MoS2. The optimized structural representations for hydrogen adsorption at different materials and their corresponding hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) including zero-point energy at 298.15 K are shown in Fig. 7 , respectively. By calculation, the basal plane of MoS2 shows a very poor HER electrocatalytic activity with the very high ΔGH of 1.751 eV. Whereas the calculated ΔGH of CoP is –0.127 eV, indicating much better catalytic activity in HER than that of the basal MoS2. As expected, the HER catalytic activity of the CoP@MoS2 complex was further improved performance when MoS2 was complexed with CoP, as manifested by the calculated ΔGH = –0.032 eV, which is close to zero (Fig. 7(d)). All these calculations are in good agreement with the above experimental results. It is well recognized that the HER involves two processes, hydrogen adsorption and dehydrogenation, which nevertheless are actually competitive in determining the HER performance. Based on such a picture, on one hand, the adsorption of H on the basal plane of MoS2 would be very difficult due to the large energy cost, on the other hand, CoP has a relatively strong binding energy for H adsorption according to the negative ΔGH. Therefore, it is natural to expect that the CoP@MoS2 complex may perform superior HER activity. The interaction of the CoP and MoS2 can lead to modest adsorption and desorption energy of H, as manifested by the near-zero ΔGH (–0.032 eV). To support our statement, we also analyzed the charge transfer between CoP and MoS2 in CoP@MoS2 complex. As shown in Fig. 7(e), significant charge is observed to transfer from the Co atom to the S atom in the vicinity of the CoP–MoS2 interface, leading to relative strong Co–S covalent bonds varying from 2.112 to 2.195 Å. This result demonstrates again the strong interaction between CoP and MoS2, which is very consistent with the results of the previous XPS experiments. Based on the above results and summary of typical reported MoS2-based catalysts in Table S(2), the CoP@MoS2-75 sample possessed outstanding catalytic properties owing to the following attributes. First is the unique and subtle nanostructure of CoP@MoS2-75. Unlike the ordinary hollow nanoframe, this unique externally layered and internally hollowed nanostructure not only accelerates the mass and charge transfer, but also enlarges the catalytically active surface area through its external laminate structure. In addition, MoS2 coverage on the CoP substrate prevents accumulation and agglomeration between layers, maximizing the number of exposed active sites in the hollow CoP@MoS2-75 hetero-nanoframe. Second is the strong interaction between CoP and MoS2 conferred by the altered d-band electron structure, which enhances the electron transfer between CoP and MoS2 and appreciably stimulates the catalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution sites. Finally, the discontinuous lattice stripes on the CoP@MoS2-75 surface are packed with numerous distortions and dislocations that cooperate with the electronic structure to enhance the catalytic properties."
9,Conclusions,"Hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframes with different amounts of CoP were favorably synthesized by hydrothermally complexing MoS2 onto porous hollow CoP substrate derived from ZIF-67. The CoP@MoS2-75 electrocatalyst exhibited prominent HER capability with a low overpotential (119 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2), a small Tafel slope (49 mV dec−1), and a high density of the electric double-layer capacitance (10.28 mF cm−2), indicating rapid electron-transfer dynamics on the interface. In a comparative XPS analysis, it was found that electron transfer occurred from the CoP substrate to the MoS2 nanosheets. The excellent HER capability of CoP@MoS2-75 was thus attributed to the CoP substrate, which enhanced the conductivity and catalytic activity of MoS2, and to the enlarged catalytically active surface area and cycle stability provided by the MoS2 component. Also, the DFT results can adequately prove this argument. These results should inspire the further design and perfection of materials for highly efficient, nonprecious-metal electrocatalysis."
