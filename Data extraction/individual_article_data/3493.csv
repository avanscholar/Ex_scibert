0,Introduction,"Thick-walled plate-bending hydrogenation reactor serves as the key equipment in modern petroleum refinery and coal chemical industry [1,2], thereby attracting wide attention from researchers. In the past, 2.25Cr–1Mo was widely used to construct hydrogenation reactor shells [3]. However, with the development of industrial scale, service temperature and operating pressure of hydrogenation reactor increase rapidly. The structure made from 2.25Cr–1Mo steel is excessively thick, material consuming and uneconomical, resulting in an urgent need for new materials with better high-temperature strength. Thus, the vanadium modified Cr–Mo low-alloy heat-resistant steel (2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V) gradually replaces 2.25Cr–1Mo steel serving as the material of choice for hydrogenation reactor [4]. Nowadays, to further reduce equipment costs, lightweight design is getting more and more attention in engineering practice [5]. In addition to developing new materials, accurately predicting the actual material performance in service can promote the lightweight design of engineering component. As we all known, there is a great gap in material property between virgin material and final product. For hydrogenation reactor ring shell, there are two different fabrication methods: forging and plate bending. The forging is usually for ultra-thick-walled cylindrical shell (over 200 mm) [6], and has complicated production procedure that requires manufacturers to have high technical capabilities. In contrast, the plate-bending shell has less manufacturing difficulty and lower cost. For extensively used heavy wall vessels (below 200 mm), the plate-bending fabrication occupies a bigger advantage. Note that, the two manufacturing processes unavoidably change the performance of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel, and should be profoundly studied. In the past several years, Jiang and his co-workers [ [7–10]] have deeply investigated the evolutions of microstructure and mechanical properties of as-forged 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel during large-scale hydrogenation reactor vessel fabrication. The results revealed microstructure evolution mechanisms in forging (over 900 °C, austenitized) and subsequent heat treatment, involving carbide nucleation/segregation/growth/dissolution, dislocation propagation/accumulation, the behaviors of crystal boundary/sub-boundary, etc. Nevertheless, to date, the microstructure evolution mechanisms of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel during plate-bending (650 °C–675 °C, non-austenitized) have not been fully understood. Additionally, the mechanical property data of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel after plate-bending is still insufficient. Consequently, analytical and empirical/semi-empirical methods are impossible for application in material property prediction during plate-bending and subsequent tempering. As an alternative, artificial neural network (ANN), a data-driven method, can learn the underlying mechanisms from specific small datasets and model complicated correlations between various factors without considering their physical backgrounds [11]. Fig. 1 depicts the basic modeling ideas of above-mentioned three methods. As can be seen, they have the same ultimate goal, that is, to find a well-worked equation to describe material responses in certain situation, but their implementations are different. Analytical method derives a theoretical equation from predominant microstructure evolution mechanisms, and determines specific material parameters through experimental measurements. Empirical/semi-empirical method inductively identifies an equation from a large amount of relevant experimental data. When applying the obtained equation to a specific situation, a few additional experiments are needed to fit the material constants in equation. In fact, it is not easy for humans to derive a theoretical equation or induct an empirical/semi-empirical equation. Fortunately, for ANN method, there is no need to manually identify a well-worked equation. Machine can learn it from data by itself. The basic workflow is as follows: A series of neural networks are firstly constructed and randomly initialized, then trained on specific experimental data to optimize their parameters, and finally screened for the best. From the mathematical perspective, a neural network is an equation which can describe various quantitative relationships from simple linear to highly nonlinear. Different network architectures (e.g. layer number, neuron number, neuron connection, etc.) correspond to different mathematical equations. Hornik et al. [12] have demonstrated that the simplest network architecture (i.e. the single hidden layer neural network) can approximate any continuous function. The mathematical complexity and architecture designability of neural networks offer ANN method the possibility to find good equations for specific issues. The better performance of ANN than other two methods has been reported in many literatures [13–18]. Currently, ANN method has been widely applied in studying deformation behaviors, mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of various materials, such as high carbon low alloy steel (using 24 experimental samples) [16],welded X70 steel (using 387 experimental samples) [19], 12Cr3WV steel (using 20 experimental samples) [17], CuAlMn shape memory alloy (using 36 experimental samples) [20], AZ31 magnesium alloy (using 112 collected data) [21], nickel alloy steel (using 16 experimental samples) [22], Ni-based superalloy (using 35 experimental samples) [18] and Ti-based metallic glassy matrix composite (using 9 experimental samples) [23], etc. The results obtained from these studies demonstrate that ANN has high prediction precision and strong learning ability, which helps it overcome the challenges brought by the small-scale database. Fig. 2 illustrates the standard fabrication procedure of plate-bending hydrogenation reactor shell. Virgin plate is firstly heated to 650 °C, then bended into a ring shell in several minutes, and finally tempered at 705 °C for 8 h. A few investigations have been made on the separate effect of plastic forming/tempering. Liu and his co-workers [24] studied how plastic deformation affects the mechanical strength of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel at room temperature. The results showed, in comparison with virgin steel, plastic deformation increases yield strength (YS) in room temperature hydrogen environment, but has little effect on ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Elsewhere, the mechanical properties and microstructural changes of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel under different heat treatment processes were investigated by Li et al. [25]. They pointed out, with the increase of heat treatment time from 0 h to 32 h, the room-temperature strength decreases, and the plasticity remains nearly constant. Moreover, the longer heat treatment time leads more carbides to precipitate. Huang and Li [26–28] investigated the influence of warm bending on the high temperature strength of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel. The results indicated that bending forming causes material strength inhomogeneity in hydrogenation reactor shells. However, their proposed material strength predictor cannot considerate the tempering effect, thereby the synergistic impact of forming and tempering has not been clearly revealed yet. Furthermore, research results related to combined effect of warm bending and tempering on 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel could hardly be found in the literatures. From previous studies, it was known that warm bending causes a non-ignorable effect on material strength of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel, but the impact of subsequent tempering remains unclear. The purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of tempering on bending-induced material strength inhomogeneity in hydrogenation reactor shells. More specifically, we developed a database by experiment, and then constructed ANN on this database to predict the material strength of as-formed and as-tempered 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel. Combined with FE simulation, MSD in semi-finished and finished hydrogenation reactor shells was acquired and compared. Additionally, the carbide distribution in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel with different warm deformation extents was quantitively analyzed via image identification technology. Based on this analysis, a non-monotonic association was revealed between carbides and processing parameters."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Experimental 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel plate (152 mm thick) was isotropic and homogeneous, and provided by Lanzhou Lanshi Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd. Detail information is listed in Table 1 . Tensile specimens (see Fig. 3 ) were extracted from 1/4 thickness position (1/4t) of the experimental plate and divided into three groups for convenience, as shown in Fig. 4 . Group 1 and Group 2 specimens (total 31 pieces) were prepared for ANN database construction whereas Group 3 specimens (6 pieces) were for material microstructure observation."
3,Tensile test for ANN database construction,"2.2 Tensile test for ANN database construction To predict the manufacturing-induced material strength inhomogeneity in hydrogenation reactor shells, the ANN-training-used 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel strength database should simultaneously contain the residual effect of warm bending and tempering. Therefore, some pre-treatments were performed on Group 1 and Group 2 specimens. The entire tensile test was conducted by three steps, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . Notable, all 650 °C deformations and tensile tests of Group 1 and Group 2 specimens were performed on a SHENLI WDW-300kN electronic universal testing machine (Shanghai SHENLI Testing Machine Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The heat treatment of Group 1 specimens was carried out in the same batch in a box-type laboratory furnace under atmospheric conditions. Step 1 Group 1 and Group 2 specimens were heated to 650 °C and held for 20 min, then stretched at 2 mm/min for several minutes to produce warm plastic strain, followed by air cooling, and at last their residual plastic strains were measured under room temperature. In this work, warm tensile deformation was substituted for warm bending deformation, whose impact on 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel strength evolution was thought to be as same as that of warm bending [29]. The tensile conditions used (i.e. tensile temperature, tensile speed and tensile duration) were determined in accordance with the actual warm bending process of hydrogenation reactor ring shell (see Fig. 2). Step 2 Warm pre-strained Group 1 specimens were tempered at 705 °C for 8 h according to the standard post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) of hydrogenation reactor [30]. The specific tempering procedure is shown in Fig. 6 . Group 2 specimens were not tempered. Step 3 For these pre-treated Group 1 and Group 2 specimens, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 454 °C and 482 °C were measured in compliance with Section 10.4 of Chinese standard GB/T228.2–2015 [31]. The two tensile temperatures used are the standard design temperatures of hydrogenation reactors in petroleum refinery and coal chemical industry, respectively."
4,Metallographic observation,"2.3 Metallographic observation Group 3 specimens were pre-strained and tempered as described in Step 1 and Step 2 of Section 2.2, respectively. The test machines are the same as those used in Section 2.2. The detailed treatment procedure is exhibited in Table 2 , where ✓ means the corresponding treatment was performed. In the 650 °C pre-deformation, 0% pre-strained specimen 3–1 was also kept at 650 °C for 20 min to exclude thermal cycle influence on material microstructure (when compared with specimens 3–2 ∼ 3–6). To characterize the carbides in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel under different warm deformation levels, specimens 3–1 ∼ 3–6 were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Utral 55). The metallographic observation specimens were extracted from treated Group 3 specimens as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Thereafter, they were gradually ground with 60–2000 SiC papers, polished with 1 μm diamond paste, cleaned with acetone and etched with 4% nitric alcohol solution. Furthermore, the size and number of carbides in obtained SEM images were quantifiably analyzed through Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. At present, the image processing method is widely used for statistical analysis of the number and size of grains or carbides [27–29,32]."
5,Results,"2.4 Results 2.4.1 Material strength of pre-treated 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel (ANN database) Group 1 specimens represent the material state of the finished hydrogenation reactor ring shell whereas Group 2 specimens represent that of semi-finished one. In addition, the specimens with different 650 °C deformation extents correspond to material states at different locations of ring shell, respectively. For simplification, warm bending which was actually multi-pass in practice was assumed to be single-pass in this work. Therefore, the obtained high-temperature strength of tensile specimens (see Fig. 8 ) could stand for actual material strength in reactor shells of corresponding states, and were utilized to construct our ANN material strength predictor. The model-building process is explicated in Section 3.1. Literature [29] reported, at low temperatures, the stress strain curve of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel displays a strain strengthening stage at the onset of plastic deformation; at high temperatures, it exhibits only strain softening behavior during plastic deformation. (Strain strengthening denotes that an ever increasing stress is required for deformation to increase from the yield point onward, while strain softening is the opposite.) However, the specific transition temperature was not clearly pointed out. In this work, 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel after experimental pre-treatment displays an obvious strain strengthening stage at 454 °C and 482 °C, as shown in Fig. 9 (a) and (b). Additionally, 650 °C tensile test was carried out on a specimen cut from 1/4t of virgin experimental plate by the SHENLI WDW-300kN electronic universal testing machine, and the test conditions (except for tensile temperature) are the same as those in Step 3 of Section 2.2. The tensile curve is shown in Fig. 9 (c), and was further utilized in warm bending finite element (FE) simulation (detailed in Section 3.2). As can be seen, virgin 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel exhibits only strain softening response at 650 °C. Thus, without considering warm bending and tempering residual effects, the transition temperature of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel should be in range of 482 °C–650 °C. As is observed in Fig. 9 (a) and (b), the elastic modulus (E) of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel gradually increases with the increase of 650 °C plastic deformation. Comparing the contours plotted in Fig. 9 (a)/(b), materials undergoing larger high-temperature plastic strains (>7.5%) have much lower elongation whereas the elongation changes little in materials with small high-temperature plastic strains (<4%). This indicates that high-temperature plastic behavior, especially highly one, hardens the materials and leads to material plasticity loss. Notably, all Group 1 specimens were subjected to 705 °C × 8 h tempering treatment that restored material properties (including material plasticity). Their elongation discrepancies may primarily be ascribed to the limited capability of implemented tempering. For specimens having small warm plastic strain, the used heat treatment procedure can well recover deformation-induced material plasticity loss. Nevertheless, the highly thermoplastic behaviors are beyond the material performance improvement ability of current tempering. 2.4.2 Microstructure of pre-treated 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel Fig. 10 (up-side) shows the virgin SEM images of specimens 3–1 ∼ 3–6. The white pixels with irregular outlines were considered as carbides in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel. To further discriminate carbides from ferrite matrix, virgin SEM images were converted into high-contrast 8-bit grayscale images. Carbides have different shapes, such as rod, lump and sphere. For reasonably characterizing their dimension, the length (L) and minimum diameter (Dmin) were used. The SEM and TEM observations in the literatures [27–29] evidenced that the plastic deformation at around 650 °C increases the size of carbides in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25 V steel (see third paragraph for details). Moreover, carbides are commonly coarsened during tempering. Considering the above carbide behavior, propitiate values (see Table 3 ) were pre-set for L and Dmin to more accurately identify carbides in high-contrast SEM images. Takeda Hiroyuki [33] reported, after tempering at 700 °C for 10 h, the Dmin of carbides in 2.25Cr–1Mo steel is around 130 nm, and the length is about 260 nm. However, fine precipitates (MC) are also observed after prolong tempering (over 50 h). Thereby, the carbides here were pre-divided into two categories (i.e. medium size and large size), and different dimension value ranges were given for them. The identification results are shown in Fig. 10 (down-side). The yellow markers imply the medium-size precipitates whereas the red markers represent the large-size ones. It should be pointed out that Fig. 10 is a preliminary material characterization result and should be interpreted with caution. It is well accepted that carbide size plays a vital role in affecting material performance [34,35]. The following analysis focuses on the size distribution of carbides. Apparently, from Fig. 10 (a) to Fig. 10 (c), the number of large-scale precipitates increases, while from Fig. 10 (c) to Fig. 10 (f) it decreases. The same tendency is also exhibited in middle-scale precipitates. This indicates, 3.93% pre-strained specimen 3-3 has the most over 60 nm carbides after tempering, while they are least in 0% and 10.47% pre-strained specimens 3–1 and 3–6. A nonmonotonic relationship is suggested between the amount of coarsened carbides after tempering and 650 °C plastic deformation extent. More specifically, as the degree of warm deformation rises, more original fine carbides are coarsened during tempering. Beyond a certain strain (approximately 4%), however, the number of coarsened carbides declines with increasing deformation. Furthermore, the volume fraction of precipitates in specimens 3–1 ∼ 3–6 (see Fig. 11 ) also coincides with the above nonmonotonic relationship. The exact reason for our observed nonmonotonic relationship could not be elucidated yet since the microstructure evolution mechanisms of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel during warm bending have not been fully clarified (see Introduction). Nevertheless, some possible carbide behaviors were discussed below based on experimental observations in literatures and dislocation theory. Yafei Wang [29] investigated the microstructures of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel with and without 660 °C plastic deformation. The SEM and TEM images in his research [29] suggested that warm plastic deformation (WPD) increases the number and size of carbides (only carbides with an average diameter (Davg) exceeding 60 nm were considered in his research). Specifically, the Davg of carbides (Davg ≥ 60 nm) mainly ranges from 60 nm to 90 nm in virgin plate, while the Davg of carbides (Davg ≥ 60 nm) in 5% pre-strained specimen is concentrated in 60 nm–125 nm. The amount of carbides (Davg ≥ 60 nm) in 5% pre-strained specimen is about 150% higher than that in virgin plate, which is primarily attributed to a rise in the carbides with Davg of 60 nm–90 nm. Moreover, Song Huang [27] conducted a statistical analysis of carbides with Davg less than 60 nm in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel before and after 650 °C plate bending based on 40 SEM images. The results showed, the Davg of most carbides (Davg < 60 nm) varies from 20 nm to 40 nm, regardless of whether the material is warm-bended or not. After warm bending, an obvious rise in carbides (Davg < 60 nm) was observed, and the ones with Davg less than 20 nm increase mostly. Additionally, the dislocation density in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel was confirmed to increase with the increasing warm plastic strain by TEM images in literatures [27,29]. The strain-induced precipitation mechanism, which was evidenced in hot deformation behavior (over 900 °C) of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel [32], was widely employed to explain carbide behaviors (i.e. nucleation, growth and coarsening) during warm bending [27–29]. Based on above analysis, Fig. 12 (a) ∼ (c) schematically show carbides and dislocations in virgin plate, 0%–4% pre-strained specimen and 4%–10% pre-strained specimen, respectively. In Fig. 12, the red markers represent the large-size precipitates (130 nm ≤ Davg < 200 nm); the yellow markers imply the medium-size precipitates (60 nm ≤ Davg < 130 nm); the green markers denote the small-size precipitates (Davg < 60 nm). As can be seen, no large-size carbide occurs before tempering, which is consistent with the metallographic observations in previous studies [27–29]. According to the SEM observations in this work (see Fig. 10), large-size carbide occurs after warm bending and tempering. The reduction of dislocation density during tempering has been extensively reported for 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel [7,8]. And the carbide quantity decline was also widely observed in the tempering process of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel [9,36]. Thereby, compared with Fig. 12 (b)/Fig. 12 (c), the relative bigger and fewer carbides and lower dislocation density were given in Fig. 12 (d)/Fig. 12 (e). It is well accepted that dislocations have two important effects on carbide behaviors during tempering [37]: one is to provide precipitation sites for carbide nucleation; the other is to act as a fast diffusion channel to promote carbide growth and coarsening. The two are both complementary and competitive [38], indicating there is a suitable dislocation density. Thus, in this work, around 4% WPD is thought to generate a moderate dislocation density in 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel, which can benefit both precipitation and coarsening of carbides during subsequent tempering. On this basis, it is plausible to surmise that carbide coarsening is dominant in 0%–4% WPD specimens during 705 °C × 8 h tempering, whereas carbide precipitation is prevalent in 4%–10% WPD ones. Meanwhile, tempering promotes the overall growth of nucleated precipitates, thereby the Davg of small-size carbides in as-tempered material should be greater than that in as-received/as-formed material. Considering current tempering time (8 h) is not long enough to make all nucleated precipitates (see green markers in Fig. 12 (e)) to grow to medium size, we may explain why less medium-size and large-size precipitates were observed in 4%–10% WPD specimens. It should be clearly pointed out that the above arguments have not been evidenced in this work, and further exploration is needed. The good high-temperature strength of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel is mainly attributed to the stable dispersion of fine carbides (such as MC, M3C, M7C3 and M23C6, etc.) [39], and is also due to in matrix solid solution alloying elements (Cr, Mo, V, Ti and Ni, etc.) [40]. The coarsening and growth of precipitates reduce the effect of solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening [41], leading to a great loss of material strength. Based on the above analysis, one could speculate that the mechanical strength gradually decreases from specimens 3–1 to 3-3 while it progressively rises from specimens 3-3 to 3–6. Notably, the ANN prediction results in Fig. 24 coincide with this speculation, which demonstrates the coarsening behavior of carbides can explain the discrepancy in strength after tempering between 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steels with different warm deformation extents. Fig. 13 gives carbide size distribution of specimens 3–1, 3-3 and 3–6 in details. For medium-sized precipitates, their Dmin values mainly range from 60 nm to 100 nm, and L is concentrated in 80 nm–200 nm. The Dmin of large carbides is primarily in 130 nm–170 nm, while their L values vary from 170 nm to 330 nm. In these size ranges, the amount of larger precipitates increases from specimens 3–1 to 3-3 whereas decreases from specimens 3-3 to 3–6. This further coincides with the above conjecture that warm bending could affect the coarsening behavior of carbides during tempering. The shape of precipitates is characterized by L/Dmin ratio here. The carbides with L/Dmin < 2 are thought to be spherical or lump-shaped, while the ones with L/Dmin > 2 are rod-shaped. As presented in Table 4 , the L/Dmin ratios of both medium-sized and large-sized precipitates fluctuate roughly around 1.6, and their standard deviations are lower than about 0.6. This shows that most of the coarsened carbides are spherical or lump-shaped, and their quantity accounts for more than 70%. The carbides in specimens 3–1 to 3–6 are similar in shape, that is, the association between precipitate shape and warm forming is not observed here."
6,Material strength distribution (MSD) evolution prediction method,"MSD prediction procedure is illustrated in Fig. 14 . The employed prediction method was composed of two parts (see red box in Fig. 14): the material strength evolution predictor based on ANN and the warm bending FE simulator. The former was employed to quantify material strength response to complex manufacturing factors, and the latter was utilized to calculate the residual plastic strain distribution in warm formed ring shells. The residual plastic strain is one of the major manufacturing residual influence factors, and its impact on material strengths can be predicted by developed ANN model. Thus, the FE simulated warm bending plastic strain was input into the well-trained ANN model, and its outputs were material strengths of different locations in hydrogenation reactor ring shells. Coupling the ANN prediction results and FE simulated plastic strain distribution, MSD evolution (i.e. MSDs in semi-finished and finished ring shells) can be finally acquired."
7,Artificial neural network (ANN),"3.1 Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN is a data-driven model which needs to be developed in a series of driven data. In this work, tensile test results (see Fig. 8) were utilized as the ANN construction database. Specifically, 31 experimental samples were randomly divided into two parts: training set (25 data items) and test set (6 data items). The former was adopted to train virgin ANN model whereas the latter was not involved in the model training process but employed to evaluate the generalization performance of well-trained ANN model. Fig. 15 provides the framework of our used ANN. As can be seen, a single hidden layer neural network was selected here to model the material strength evolution in ring shell fabrication. Its four input variables are warm bending residual plastic strain, tempering temperature, tempering duration and ring shell service temperature. Apparently, there are many other factors that can affect material properties in hydrogenation reactors. The selected four are most representative and most critical features corresponding to warm bending, heat treatment and service condition, respectively. The outputs of ANN are mechanical strengths of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel in semi-manufactured and finished ring shells. Note that, to achieve the best prediction results, the network was trained for YS and UTS independently. As mentioned in Introduction, a neural network with a deterministic architecture corresponds to a certain mathematical function. The framework of our used ANN can refer to a set of network architectures with different hidden layer neuron numbers, that is, a set of functions, which are described as follows: (1) y k n p = max [ 0 , b k 2 nd + ∑ j w j k 2 nd max ( 0 , b j 1 st + ∑ i w i j 1 st x i n N ) ] where x i n N is the normalized value of n-th element of i-th input vector (i = 1, 2, 3, 4; n = 1, 2, …31), y k n p is the predicted value of n-th element of k-th output vector (k = 1, 2), and other notations are described in the caption of Fig. 15. To eliminate negative effects of the four inputs' magnitude difference, the following normalization was leveraged: (2) x i n N = x i n − x i ‾ ∑ n = 1 31 ( x i n − x i ‾ ) 31 where x i n is the n-th element of i-th input vector, and x i ‾ is the average value of x i 1 ∼ x i 31 . Fig. 16 explicates the construction procedure of ANN. Firstly, the optimum network hyperparameters were determined with application of grid search and 5-fold cross-validation. Then, the virgin network with best hyperparameters was trained on training set to maximize its prediction power. At last, the well-trained ANN were evaluated by learning curve and test set. In the hyperparameter optimization process, the learning rate and the number of hidden layer nodes were considered, and their 192 combinations were scored by 5-fold cross-validation, where R-Squared score (R2) was utilized. The 5-fold cross-validation result is shown in Fig. 17 , and the obtained best hyperparameter values are listed in Table 5 . In the network-training process, the backpropagation algorithm was deployed to enhance the model predictability via iteratively updating the weights and biases between adjacent layer neurons (i.e. w i j 1 st , w j k 2 nd , b j 1 st and b k 2 nd ). The specific iteration (commonly known as model training/learning) contains four steps as follows. Step 1: The input vectors of training set were input into untrained ANN where all weights and biases were randomly initialized, and the predicted output vectors were calculated and formed. Step 2: The predicted output vectors were compared with desired ones (i.e. YS/UTS in Fig. 8), and their accuracy (that is, current ANN prediction capacity) was evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE). Step 3: The descending gradient (i.e. − ∂ RMSE / ∂ w i j 1 st , − ∂ RMSE / ∂ w j k 2 nd , − ∂ RMSE / ∂ b j 1 st and − ∂ RMSE / ∂ b k 2 nd ) was calculated, multiplied by learning rate, and utilized as the updating direction of weights and biases. Step 4: The same input vectors as Step 1 were input into the updated ANN where the initial weights and biases (see Step 1) were replaced by the updated ones (see Step 3), and the better output vectors could be obtained. Repeat Step 2 ∼ Step 4 until the RMSE was small enough. When the RMSE was minimized, the predicted output vectors were closest to the desired ones. That is to say, the best weights and biases were found to maximize the network prediction capacity (denoted as well-trained ANN in this paper). In the model verification process, the learning curve was performed to visualize the learning process of the used network. Fig. 18 shows, as the amount of training data increases, the network's RMSE progressively rises on training set but drops on validation set. Roughly around 10 training data items (11 for YS and 9 for UTS), the model's errors on the training and verification set are close to each other, after which their difference declines slightly and ultimately reaches below 10 MPa (YS)/5 MPa (UTS). Notably, the final RMSE difference is below 4% of data values (i.e. material strength values), indicating that the experimental data are not overfitted or underfitted. Taken together, due to strong learning power of ANN, our proposed ANN model is sufficient to handle this issue although the experimental database used here is small. For evaluating model's generalization capacity in new data, the well-trained ANN was estimated by test set. The comparison between model errors on training set and test set is shown in Table 6 . In terms of RMSE indicator, the prediction errors on training set are very small for both YS and UTS, below 2% of the corresponding smallest desired values. Although the disagreement between predicted and desired values increases to around 20 MPa on test set, it is still less than 6% of true values. Notably, the difference in model precision between training and test sets is reasonable, suggesting the well-trained ANN has identified the underlying laws of training data. The same conclusions can also be drawn from R2 scores."
8,3D finite element (FE) simulation,"3.2 3D finite element (FE) simulation FE model was developed to simulate the warm bending process of thick 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel plates, and its aimed output was the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) distribution in formed ring shells. Note that, PEEQ focuses on the accumulated value of plastic strain regardless of its direction. To simplify the problem, the following three assumptions were made. (1) The thermal effect was neglected here because warm bending is very fast (within 1–2 min). Mean, the plate was isothermal throughout the simulation, and there was no heat exchange. (2) Instead of multi-pass forming, single-pass forming was considered here for computational cost saving. (3) The tensile strain and compressive strain were not distinguished here, and their variation across the thickness of ring shell was not considered as well. Notably, whether the tensile and compressive deformations at 650 °C have different effects on 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel were not investigated in this work, and further study is needed. Fig. 19 shows the developed 3D FE model and its detail dimensions. The four rollers are of different diameters but are all 2000 mm wide, and the plate is 1700 mm wide, 8000 mm long and 152 mm thick. The entire simulation was implemented through 3 steps according to actual warm bending procedure. Firstly, roller 1 went down 0.03 mm along y-axis to clamp the plate so that the plate would not slide during continuous feeding in the final step. Subsequently, roller 4 advanced a certain distance along the direction of 25° to y-axis (see black arrow for roller 4 in Fig. 19), which determined the formed shell's diameter. Finally, roller 1 rotated at 0.1 radians/s to drive the continuous feeding of plate. By means of roller 4, the plate was bent to a desired curvature in this step. In the FE model, the four rollers were set as discrete rigid bodies and meshed by 6000 R2D2 elements (i.e. circumferential: 400 and wide: 15). The plate was perceived as deformable body and discretized by 128,000 C3D8R elements (i.e. long: 800, wide: 20 and thick: 8). Four surface-to-surface contact pairs were defined between the rollers 1–4 and plate, respectively. In the four contact pairs, penalty contact method and 0.5 friction coefficient were employed. The simulation utilized 650 °C as the warm bending temperature, thus the tensile curve in Fig. 9 (c) was adopted to describe the plate's elastoplastic behavior. For solving this nonlinear problem, the dynamic explicit module of ABAQUS 6.13–4 was employed. Fig. 20 (a) gives the simulation result of the ring shell with 2400 mm diameter and 152 mm thickness. As can be observed, PEEQ distribution is relatively homogeneous in the circumferential direction of formed ring shells but non-uniform in the axial and radial directions. Along axial direction, the end and center regions of cylindrical shell have low residual plastic strain while the region between them displays high PEEQ values. This tendency is more obvious on outer surface than on inner surface, which might be owing to their different contact boundary conditions during rolling forming at roller 4. In this work, 88 ring shells with different sizes were simulated based on our proposed 3D FE model, and numbered from 0# to 87#. Their diameters varied from 2000 mm to 4000 mm at 200 mm intervals, and their thicknesses ranged from 100 mm to 180 mm at 10 mm intervals, while their widths were always 1700 mm. Note that, 150-mm-thick shells were replaced by 152-mm-thick shells for subsequent verification in Section 4.2. In some investigations [42,43], bending was considered as plane strain problem, and 2D FE simulation was employed, which leads to ignoring the axial non-uniform PEEQ distribution caused by bending. For taking observed axial inhomogeneity into consideration, we selected 9 track nodes in axial high PEEQ region of each shell to further research the PEEQ distribution along the thickness direction of ring shell. The red line in Fig. 20 (b) schematically represents the locations from which the track nodes were taken. For avoiding the inconsistency of track node selections, uniform criteria were conducted here. That is, the track nodes were located on the cut plane about 425 mm from the end surface of ring shell, which is always the axial high PEEQ region for 88 simulated shells. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 21 , and thought to be conservative for lightweight design of reactor shell. As can be found, the central area is the low warm plastic deformation zone (LWPDZ) whereas the surface and near-surface region are high warm plastic deformation zone (HWPDZ). Fig. 22 displays the variation of PEEQ in LWPDZ and HWPDZ with Di/t. The PEEQ values appear to be directly associated with the wall thickness and diameter of ring shell, and these correlations are inconsistent in low and high deformation zones. In details, there were significant inverse associations with Di/t in HWPDZ but weak associations with Di/t in LWPDZ."
9,Discussion,
10,Outcome analysis of ANN,"4.1 Outcome analysis of ANN Fig. 23 provides the comparison between experimental and ANN predicted values. For all data points, the absolute relative errors of ANN are below 5%. Specifically, the max absolute relative errors are 4.89% for YS and 4.97% for UTS. The average absolute relative errors of YS and UTS prediction are 1.64% and 1.50%, respectively. Taken together, the developed ANN shows good ability in material strength prediction, and its prediction accuracy is reasonable and acceptable. Fig. 24 illustrates the ANN predicted results at 454 °C and 482 °C. As the 650 °C plastic strain increases, the material strength goes down at first, and when the plastic strain reaches around 4%, the strength rises progressively. Compared with YS, UTS has a flatter changing trend, indicating the warm plastic forming process has a greater impact on YS than on UTS. In Fig. 24, the black solid and the red dashed curves represent the material states in semi-fabricated and finished ring shells, respectively. As can be seen, tempering leads to a decline in material strength. For further investigation, Table 7 gives the percentage of material strength reduction caused by tempering. With the variation of warm plastic strain, the decrease percentages of strengths change, and the change amplitudes are about ±3% around their average values. Compared with un-tempered material, the mechanical strength of tempered material drops by 10%–25%. The average decrease in YS is bigger than that in UTS, and the fluctuation in YS decline is almost two times larger than that in UTS decline. This evidences YS is more sensitive to tempering than UTS. Moreover, the higher service temperature leads to a greater material strength descent, especially for YS. As the service temperature increases from 454 °C to 482 °C, the average descent and maximum descent in YS rise by approximately 5% while those in UTS go up little. Besides, the declines in both YS and UTS fluctuate more under 482 °C than under 454 °C. In addition, the association between the degree of strength descent and 650 °C plastic strain will be discussed in Section 4.3. From above analysis, the tempering effect on material strengths is demonstrated to be non-ignorable, and the lowest mechanical strengths occur in 3%–6% warm strained materials. That is to say, for final hydrogenation reactor ring shells, the locations with 3%–6% residual warm bending strain has the minimal material strength, resulting in the decrease of safety margin, and is likely to cause a danger in the long-term service. The coarsening behaviors of carbides (observed in Section 2.4.2) can explain this phenomenon."
11,Predicted MSD in semi-finished and finished hydrogenation reactor shells,"4.2 Predicted MSD in semi-finished and finished hydrogenation reactor shells The FE simulation obtained PEEQ values (see Fig. 21) were input into the well-trained ANN model, and the outputs were the material strengths of corresponding locations in corresponding ring shells. Since the developed ANN model could predict 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel's strength in two material states, the MSDs in semi-fabricated and finished ring shells could be achieved simultaneously via our proposed prediction method. To validate this MSD prediction procedure, the predicted and experimental MSDs were compared, as illustrated in Table 8 . The experimental values were from Li's work [26] where he measured the MSD in actual hydrogenation reactor shell (finished state; wall thickness: 152 mm; inner diameter: 2400 mm; length: 1700 mm). As can be seen, the predicted MSDs are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The average absolute relative error of YS distribution forecast is 3.60%, slightly higher than the UTS prediction error 3.17%. Besides, the maximal bias is 7.89% for YS and 6.74% for UTS. To sum up, the proposed method is demonstrated to have acceptable accuracy and reliable performance. Fig. 25 compares the predicted MSDs in 10# and 77# ring shells between semi-finished and finished states. The 10# shell has a wall thickness of 110 mm and an inner diameter of 4000 mm whose Di/t 36.36 is maximal among 88 simulated ring shells. The 77# shell with a wall thickness of 180 mm and an inner diameter of 2000 mm has the minimal Di/t 11.11. Comparing (a) ∼ (d) with (e) ∼ (h) in Fig. 25 successively, the MSDs in 10# and 77# shells exhibit different characteristics. In the 10# shell, the material strength increases as the distance to neutral surface decreases, and its contour looks like an inverted U shape. Notably, the minimal values of both YS and UTS appear at inner and outer surfaces, while they are maximum at neutral surface. However, the MSD profiles of 77# shell are W-shaped rather than an inverted U shape. For 77# shell, the strengths around 1/4t and 3/4t locations are minimal, whereas the highest strengths appear at inner, neutral and outer surfaces. Especially for YS, the strength values at inner surfaces are higher than those at neutral surfaces, as shown in Fig. 25 (e) and (g). The disparity of MSD between the 10# and 77# ring shells is mainly related to the residual warm plastic strain in the area near inner and outer surfaces. From Fig. 21, the PEEQ values in surface regions are above 8% for 77# ring shell but slightly below 4% for 10#. In conjunction with the discussion in Section 4.1, the surface region of 10# shell is within 3%–6% deformation range which corresponds to the lowest material strength segment in Fig. 24. Nevertheless, the 77# shell's surface region corresponds to the material strength quick ascent segment in Fig. 24 whereas its near surface region (i.e. 1/4t and 3/4t locations) is within 3%–6% deformation range. In summary, there are two types of MSD, namely inverted U-shaped and positive W-shaped distributions. For hydrogenation reactor shells of different sizes, the MSD type depends on the amount of warm bending deformation in surface region. Specifically, when the residual warm plastic strain in surface region exceeds 6%, the MSD will be W-shaped, otherwise the MSD will be inverted U-shaped. Fig. 26 provides the MSD types of 88 simulated ring shells. As shown in Fig. 26 (a), the inverted U-shaped MSD usually appears in relative larger and thinner ring shells. For the ring shells with a wall thickness of more than 160 mm or a diameter of less than 3000 mm, the MSD is most likely to be W-shaped. In Fig. 26 (b), Di/t = 25 is suggested to be the judgment criterion for MSD types. The y-axis of Fig. 26 (b) (average PEEQ in surface region) denotes the mean PEEQ value of inner and outer surfaces."
12,Tempering-induced material strength descent in hydrogenation reactor shells,"4.3 Tempering-induced material strength descent in hydrogenation reactor shells The black curves in Fig. 25 denote the MSDs in un-tempered 10# and 77# ring shells whereas the red ones represent their post-tempering MSDs. It is evidenced from Fig. 25 that tempering leads to a great material strength descent in ring shells. To further investigate whether the strength reduction values are related to the material position in ring shell, Fig. 27 provides the variation of material strength reduction percentage along thickness direction in 88 simulated ring shells. The solid grey square implies the average strength decline at corresponding location of 88 predicted shell while the hollow red up-side and hollow green down-side triangle markers display the maximal and minimal percentage values, respectively. The average material strength loss (AMSL) progressively rises approximately 4% from surface region to central region, and is symmetric about the neutral surface. In details, YS is more sensitive to tempering than UTS, especially in the central region where warm plastic deformation is relatively small. Note that, 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel in different positions of ring shell undergoes different degrees of warm deformation, which contributes to their different responses to the same subsequent tempering treatment. As can be seen, tempering strongly reduces material strength in LWPDZ, whereas HWPDZ is less affected. Furthermore, the un-tempered material strength as well as AMSL in LWPDZ is higher when compared to HWPDZ, which implies the higher strength reduction values (i.e. un-tempered material strength × AMSL) in LWPDZ. As a result, the gap in material strength between LWPDZ and HWPDZ decreases, and a relatively homogeneous MSD can be acquired in hydrogenation reactor shells. Taken together, tempering leads to great material softening, but simultaneously weakens the warm-bending-induced material strength inhomogeneity. As shown in Fig. 27, due to the small deformation extent in central region for all simulated ring shells, the dispersion of material strength loss (MSL) is smaller in central region compared to surface region. This can be explained by the fact that the plastic deformation degree in LWPDZ shows a weak association with the ring shell size while that in HWPDZ carries a strong association. For further proof, Fig. 28 presents the variation of material strength decline values with Di/t. Since the MSL is symmetric about the neutral surface, the strength descent values used here are the average of symmetrical locations. The solid and hollow red up-side triangle markers denote the central region of ring shells where little plastic deformation occurs, whereas the solid and hollow green down-side triangle markers represent the surface region, that is, HWPDZ. The degree of plastic deformation in near-surface region (solid grey square) is somewhere in between. Clearly, different correlations between MSL and Di/t are observed in the above three zones. The material strength reduction values remain stable in central area, and are proved to be little relevant to Di/t. Nevertheless, there is a strong positive dependence of MSL on Di/t in near-surface zone. As for surface region, a complex non-monotonic relationship is shown. Moreover, YS and UTS in surface region display an inconsistent change trend while their trends in near-surface and central areas are identical. In addition to the location in thickness direction of ring shell, MSL is also demonstrated to be related to service temperature by Fig. 27. As can be seen, tempering causes 13%–19% material strength loss (MSL) at 454 °C. With the service temperature increasing to 482 °C, the MSL rises to 16%–24%. Under the hydrogen environment, the maximum allowable service temperature of 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel is 510 °C according to the Nelson curve. When the temperature is changed from 482 °C to 510 °C for future more advancing refining industry, a further 3%–5% MSL may occur. Moreover, a higher temperature induces a greater dispersion of MSL for ring shells of different sizes, especially in their surface and near-surface regions."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, the impact of tempering on warm-bending-induced material strength inhomogeneity in hydrogenation reactor shells was investigated. A MSD prediction model was established by applying ANN to quantity the tempering effect on 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel. The reliability of prediction results was validated experimentally. Using this model, the MSL along thickness direction of ring shell of different sizes was thoroughly studied. Moreover, SEM observation coupling with image identification technology was implemented to quantitatively analyze the size and number of carbides. The correlation between carbides and as-manufactured 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel strength was discussed in details. Notably, the microstructure characterization here is preliminary and needs further research. Following conclusions can be drawn. (1) In hydrogenation reactor shells, tempering causes 13%–24% MSL at 454 °C and 482 °C. For future higher design temperatures, tempering-induced material softening extent could be greater, which implies an increase in the material cost of hydrogenation reactor. This might lead the engineering community to look for alternative materials. (2) Tempering-induced MSL is higher in LWPDZ than in HWPDZ, thereby reducing the warm-bending-induced material strength inhomogeneity in ring shells. Owing to more easily coarsening of carbides during tempering in around 4% warm strained 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel, the mechanical strength after tempering is lowest in 3%–6% warm strained material. (3) ANN is evidenced to be powerful in predicting the tempering effect on 2.25Cr–1Mo-0.25V steel strength. The maximal absolute relative error of ANN prediction is below 5%. As a consequence, the MSD predictor based on ANN can reasonably predict MSD in finished ring shells, and its maximal absolute relative error is 7.89%."
