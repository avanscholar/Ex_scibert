0,Introduction,"With industrialization spreading all over the world, we are facing a dilemma: on one hand, world population is increasing exponentially, so does the consumption of electricity and transportation fuels; on the other hand the depleting of natural resources and generating environmental hazards caused by the industrialization is worsening at a greater rate. Currently, majority of energy is supplied by fossil fuels, i.e. petroleum, coal and natural gas. Traditionally, petroleum is the source of transportation fuels, while coal and natural gas are for heat and electricity generation. Direct burning of coal for heat and electricity generation is the major source of air pollution such as SO x , NO x , Hg and particulate matters, and releases triple tonnage of CO2. However, coal is the most abundant fossil fuel resources and readily available at low cost to the most parts of the world. Developing more efficient and environmental benign clean coal is of vital importance for the well-being of mankind and the future of the planet. Coal can be gasified into synthesis gas, a mixture of H2 and CO, with all the pollutants captured including CO2. Synthesis gas can then be converted into hydrocarbons and oxygenates for use as fuels and chemicals via various catalytic processes, i.e. coal-to-liquids (CTL) processes. Similarly, natural gas can be reformed into synthesis gas and then catalytically converted into liquid fuels and chemicals via gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes. Major catalytic synthesis processes are the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [1], synthesis of methanol, and synthesis of higher alcohols which is the combination of the above two reactions. Large scale CTL conversion is being employed in South Africa (Fischer–Tropsch) and in China (methanol and Fischer–Tropsch) via this indirect synthesis gas route [1–4]. In addition to coal, other solid waste materials such as agriculture wastes, forestry wastes, municipal solid wastes and alike can also be gasified into synthesis gas and then converted into fuels and chemicals. Since the seasonal and limited supply of such waste materials, the conversion plant from those alternate feedstock differ from the large coal- and gas-based plants. The flexibility of scaling up and down according to the availability of feed supply is necessary. In some cases, because of the limited and seasonal supply of the feedstock, such a plant would need to be movable. Similarly, for small gas fields in remote locations, stranded gas, flare gas, land-fill and digester gas-like applications with limited supply of methane, conversion to fuels and chemicals require modular, portable small scale plants."
1,Synthesis of mixed alcohol,"1.1 Synthesis of mixed alcohol While FT and methanol synthesis have been practiced at commercial scale, synthesis of higher alcohols is relatively new and undeveloped. Higher alcohols, and also referred to as mixed alcohols are C1–C6 alcohols which could be blended into gasoline as octane booster and oxygenate additives [5–7]. Mixed alcohols are more compatible with gasoline than ethanol which is currently blended at 10% in most US gasoline stations. Synthesis of mixed alcohols has not been commercialized, mainly due to lack of catalysts with desirable activity and selectivity [8]. Synthesis of mixed alcohols is a combination of alcohol formation and carbon–carbon chain growth. Catalyst design should consider both these functions [9,10]. Actually, the catalyst development of mixed alcohols was derived from the catalysts for synthesis of methanol, the modified methanol synthesis catalysts [11,12] or modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis catalysts [13]. MoS2 based catalyst developed by Dow [14–16] is one of the most promising catalysts since it is highly selective to alcohols with good yields. However, this catalyst contains sulfur and sulfur compounds are needed to maintain the catalyst activity and selectivity [17,18]. So the product of the MoS2 catalyzed reactions contains sulfur component which need to be removed for use as gasoline blend [18]. It has been reported that other molybdenum compounds such as molybdenum carbide, nitrite, boride, phosphide are active for mixed alcohols synthesis. Particularly, Mo2C based catalyst with promoters have high activity and selectivity to C2+ alcohols. Indeed, over the past ten years or so, Western Research Institute has developed a NiMo2C catalyst with high activity and selectivity for mixed alcohol synthesis [19]. One of the main advantage of mixed alcohol synthesis over FT synthesis is that final product does not require further upgrading and can be marketed as a fungible product as a blending stock for gasoline."
2,Development of synthesis gas conversion reactor technologies,"1.2 Development of synthesis gas conversion reactor technologies Synthesis gas conversion reactions are highly exothermic. Heat removal is an important factor to consider when designing a synthesis gas conversion reactor. The commercial reactors for large-scale plants are: multitubular boiling water reactors such as those used by Shell [20] in Bintulu and Pearl GTL, slurry bubble column reactors [21] as used by Sasol, SynFuel China in GTL and CTL plants, and fluidized bed reactors as used by Sasol for high temperature Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis. All these designs are not feasible for small and portable synthesis gas conversion plants."
3,Microchannel reactors,"1.3 Microchannel reactors Microchannel reactors provide significant benefits by enhancing heat and mass transfer. The integration of microreactor with heat exchangers could improve the yields and selectivity for highly exothermic/endothermic reactions, showing great process intensification properties. As stated by Tonkovich et al. [22], microchannel reactors has a parallel flow paths of 100–1000μm in width and aspect ratio between 1:1 and 100:1. The distance between heat source and heat sink is greatly reduced. Burns et al. [23] examined the fluid dynamics of narrow channel reactor, showing rapid mass transfer between phases can be achieved over a range of flow rates and viscosities. He also tested the nitration of benzene, in which rapid mass transfer is required to lower by-product formation. He indicated the channel size between 30 and 300μm could achieve good mixing in 1–10s. Losey et al. [24] examined the mass transfer property of the microchannel device by using the model reaction of cyclohexene hydrogenation and found the activity was nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional fixed bed reactor. Martin et al. [25] reported a micro-fabrication method by diffusion bonding patterned shims for natural gas reforming. The reactor channel dimension was 250μm×5000μm with an aspect ratio of 20. The heat for reforming was provided by methane combustion. The pattern of the shims can be made by photochemical, electrochemical, laser or stamping. It could apply to copper, aluminum, stainless steel and alloys. After diffusion bonding, the reactor becomes monolithic and it is vacuum-tight. The reactor they made could be used at temperatures up to 900°C. Many reactions have been tested in microchannel reactors such as water gas shift [22], steam reforming [25], partial oxidation [26–28], Fischer Tropsch synthesis [29,30], synthesis of methanol [31], methane oxidative coupling [32], photocatalysis [33], catalytic combustion [34] and as a bioreactor [35]. These are just a few examples and the applications are spreading quickly. The catalyst loading for the microchannel reactor is generally by applying a coating, similar to the washcoating of monolith catalysts in automobile exhaust gas treatment. This method of loading has very good heat transfer because the catalyst is closer to the walls. Although the microchannel reactors are excellent and have great advantages regarding heat and mass transfer, the catalyst loading is generally lower than a fixed bed reactor per volume. Another problem of this kind of loading is that the catalyst and the reactor is one unit. If for some reason the catalyst is deactivated, it could not be replaced easily. To overcome this problem, minichannel reactor has been developed."
4,Minichannel and micropacked reactor,"1.4 Minichannel and micropacked reactor Minichannel compact reactor is the larger version of the microchannel reactor. It has a similar structure as the microchannel reactor with larger channel sizes for catalyst packing. Since the enlarged channel sizes, the heat and mass transfer property is not as good as the microchannel reactor. However, it is much better than the commercial multitubular reactor in a number of aspects: small channel dimensions, small catalyst particle sizes. The heat transfer pass length is only a few millimeter, which is less than 1/10 of the multitubular reactor currently employed in the synthesis gas conversion (GTL and CTL) plants. The “pellet” size of catalyst for the minichannel reactor is similar to the slurry bubble column reactor; however, because the catalyst is present as a fixed-bed the minichannel reactor does not have the catalyst attrition and product–catalyst separation problems. Smaller catalyst pellet size greatly improves the mass transfer for synthesis gas conversion reactions."
5,Compact heat exchange reactor,"1.5 Compact heat exchange reactor Chart Energy and Chemicals developed a compact heat exchange reactor (CHER). There are two product lines (ShimTec® and FinTec®) of the minichannel reactor based on the heat exchanger technology. The ShimTec® line is based on the thin shims with patterns designed for process and heat transfer fluid. Stacks of such shims are diffusion bonded by heat and pressure. Complex channel system could be designed and manufactured with this method. ShimTec® is more suitable to niche processes such as fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. FinTec® line is produced by fin-plate structure. The channels are formed by corrugated metal sheets and then bonded by diffusion bonding which can withstand high temperature and pressure. The construction materials could be copper, aluminum, stainless steel, and nickel alloys. A prototype 66mL CHER based on Chart FinTec® was installed and operated by WRI. A 30-time scale-up to 2L catalyst loading was also completed at WRI. In this paper, we will report the development of mixed alcohol synthesis catalyst and the operation of prototype CHERs."
6,Experimental,
7,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Catalyst precursors used for preparation of the Ni/Mo2C catalysts are a variety of Ni and Mo sources including nickel oxide, nickel nitrate, nickel acetate, NiMoO4, MoO3, ammonium molybdate, all in powder state. We have experimented with physical mixing, precipitation, impregnation and alike to obtain the right formula of catalyst composition. Carburization of the mixtures was performed via Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) using gaseous mixtures such as H2/CH4, H2/C2H6 with 20% carbon atoms. Carburization process was carried out in quartz reactors, a tubular reactor and a rotating kiln each with increasing capacity. The quartz tube reactor could produce up to 20g of catalyst per run. The rotating tubular reactor (1L volume) had a production capacity of about 200g per run, and the large rotating quartz kiln (10 gallon volume) can produce up to 5kg catalyst in each run. The TPR carburization [36,37] was carried out at a ramp rate of 0.56°C/min from 343 to 700°C, when H2/CH4 was used as the reduction–carburization agent. When using H2/C2H6 the highest temperature used was 649°C. The offgas was monitored during the carburization with an online gas chromatograph (GC) to confirm the end point of the carburization process. After the carburization step was complete, the system was purged with high purity argon and cooled down to room temperature. Passivation by 1% O2 in N2 was carried out at room temperature before unloading the catalyst from the reactor or the kiln. Alkaline promoter is an essential ingredient of the Mo2C-based catalyst. In this catalyst preparation, potassium carbonate was added as the alkali promoter after carburization. The mixture was then calcined at 400°C for 1h under flowing Ar to finish the catalyst preparation."
8,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization As a part of the catalyst characterization, surface area, surface chemistry, bulk crystal structure and bulk elemental composition were determined. The BET technique was used with nitrogen sorption data to determine the surface area. Bulk crystal structure was determined using powder X-ray Diffraction. Morphology and surface chemistry of the catalyst was determined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and EDAX."
9,Construction of compact heat exchange reactor,2.3 Construction of compact heat exchange reactor FinTec® construction of the compact reactor was chosen for testing because of the lower cost and the fact that the design is easier and simpler to scale up. The construction material for the test reactor was 316 stainless steel to meet the high temperature and pressure requirements of some of the synthesis reactions. Fig. 1 shows the channel views of the prototype CHER. The three rows of process channel are interlaced with four layers of heat transfer media. Fig. 2 shows the overall view of the prototype CHER. The design specifications of the prototype CHER are as follows: • Maximum Temperature 400°C • Maximum Pressure 12.0MPa • Channel numbers: 3×10 • Length 254mm • Three thermocouples for temperature profile • Volume 66mL • Liquid injection port
10,Testing of catalyst performance,"2.4 Testing of catalyst performance 2.4.1 Fixed bed reactor Tubular fixed bed reactor with 5/8in. internal diameter was used for baseline catalyst evaluation. The reactor was furbished with a high pressure water/steam jacket similar to the boiling water reactor. The reaction temperature was controlled by steam pressure with an automatic steam pressure regulator. Heater was installed outside of the steam jacket to reach and maintain the reaction temperature. In a typical run, 10g of catalyst was mixed with 20g acid-washed quartz sand and loaded in the middle of the reactor with a bed length of about 5–6in. A seven point multiple-point thermocouple was inserted in the center of the reactor to monitor the temperature profile of the reactor. Liquid product was collected through a cold knockout pot and sampled periodically from 6 to 24h intervals. Offgas samples were analyzed by an online GC at 30min intervals. The liquid product then was analyzed by a GC equipped with a TCD detector and a GC–MS was used for detailed product analysis. 2.4.2 Bench scale compact heat exchange reactor For testing the catalyst in the compact heat exchange reactor, no inert dilution of the catalyst was performed. The catalyst was crushed and sieved to 60–80mesh. For the multichannel compact reactors, even and uniform catalyst loading is critical. If catalyst loading is not uniform among the channels, channeling through the low pressure-drop channel can occur thereby adversely impacting the observed catalyst performance. We have overcome this by developing an effective technique for catalyst loading by mimicking the procedures employed for GC/LC column packing. The compact heat exchange reactor has two fluid systems: the process fluid channel for the catalyst packing and reactants flow, and the heat transfer fluid system which are interlaced with the process channels. The heat management of the compact reactor is carried out by a hot oil circulation system. One gallon per minute of Therminol 72 was pumped through the prototype compact reactor to keep the hot oil temperature rise at less than 2.2°C while passing through the CHER at the high production mode. Four thermocouples were installed in the CHER to monitor the reaction temperature in various parts of the reactor. One thermocouple was located in one of the center channels and the other three were in the channels near the outer surface of the reactor. Liquid product was collected through a cold knockout pot and sampled periodically from 1 to 12h intervals. Offgas was analyzed by an online GC. Offgas flow rate was established by the use of an inert tracer, Ar, which is not consumed in the reaction."
11,Results and discussions,
12,Carburization process,"3.1 Carburization process Molybdenum carbide is usually made by heating molybdenum oxide and calcium carbide or by heating molybdenum powder and carbon black at 1500–1600°C in hydrogen or nitrogen. However, the surface area of the carbide produced is too low to be used as a catalyst. Lee et al. [36] reported that beta-Mo2C with high surface area could be made by TPR of MoO3 with a H2/CH4 (80/20) mixture. Beta-Mo2C produced has a hexagonal close packed phase and is the most widely used stable Mo2C. In our experiment, H2/C2H6 (90/10) was used in the TPR carburization reaction. Compared to H2/CH4 mixture, H2/C2H6 is a more effective carburization reagent. TPR carburization of MoO3, NiMoO4, and K doped NiMoO4 were conducted and the offgas compositions were monitored. Fig. 3(a) shows the changes of offgas compositions with temperature during carburization of MoO3. It can be seen that ethane concentration begins to decline at about 538°C and it is almost completely consumed by the time the temperature reaches about 593°C. CH4 concentration however begins to increase at about 538°C and reaches a plateau at about 593°C. Around 635 to 649°C, CH4 concentration decreased some with the peak of CO formation. Increase of methane formation indicates the increased degree of carburization because Mo2C is a good hydrogenolysis catalyst. The carburization was complete at holding 700°C for 3h. At this point, ethane and CO concentration were essentially zero with CH4 as the only product. Fig. 3(b) shows the offgas compositions versus temperature during carburization of NiMoO3 with H2/C2H6. Note that the onset temperature of CH4 formation has shifted to about 371°C, a 165°C decrease because of the Ni loading. Similarly, ethane was consumed completely at about 538°C while CH4 formation approaching maximum. The presence of Ni appears to enhance the reduction of molybdenum oxides, hence enhances the carburization of Mo species. In our subsequent analyses majority of Ni was found to be in metallic form. Nevertheless, we do not exclude the possibility that some nickel may be incorporated into Mo2C structure since it has been observed that the presence of Ni greatly changes the morphology of Mo2C [38]. As stated earlier, potassium is a commonly used promoter for interstitial molybdenum catalysts. Potassium promoter enhances CO adsorption and decomposition on MoS2 and Mo2C and shifts the products of CO hydrogenation from methane to alcohols and higher hydrocarbons. The offgas data from the TPR presented in Fig. 3(c) shows that potassium greatly affects the carburization of NiMoO4. Compared to Fig. 3(b), CH4 and ethane concentrations in the offgas show very similar trend. However, CH4 and ethane reached peak and valley positions at about 538°C. In Fig. 3(b) the maximum CH4 concentration is only 2/3 of the value in Fig. 3. Ethane concentration decreased to about 4% and then went up with increase in temperature. From Fig. 3(a)–(c) we could postulate that before 538°C, the major contribution of CH4 formation is nickel compounds since nickel metal is a good hydrogenolysis catalyst. Doping with K2CO3 suppressed this activity slightly. After 538°C, sintering of nickel metal became significant. The presence of the potassium inhibited the formation of Mo2C which resulted in the decreased activity of ethane hydrogenolysis, as shown in Fig. 3(c) as an increase in ethane concentration with temperature."
13,Crystal structure and morphology,"3.2 Crystal structure and morphology The X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts prepared from the TPR carburization of MoO3 and NiMoO4 are shown in Fig. 4 . The main phase in both cases is the hexagonal close-packed beta-Mo2C. As is evident in Fig. 4(b), Ni is present as Ni metal in NiMo2C. It could be noted that the diffraction lines for Mo2C in Fig. 4(a) are much broader than in the NiMo2C that is in Fig. 4(b), indicating a smaller particle size of Mo2C. This is consistent with the higher surface area observed in Mo2C. Fig. 4(b) clearly shows metallic nickel diffractions at 44.5° and 52.0° and hexagonal close-packed Mo2C diffractions at 34.5°, 38.0°, 39.5°, 52.2° and 61.5°. The representative diffraction peaks of Ni3C at 44.8°, 71.2° and 78.2° are not present in Fig. 4(b). The catalyst morphology was measured by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). An SEM micrograph is shown in Fig. 5(a). In the micrograph it is clear that a majority of the particles are oval or spherical with rounded edges, with some patches of agglomerates of smaller particles attached to the bigger particles. The micrograph also shows six locations where energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDAX) were performed to deduce the elemental composition. The EDAX spectra are displayed in Fig. 5(b). Clearly, most abundant element in the spectra is Mo, and Ni distribution varies significantly at different locations. It is interesting to note that higher Ni is coincided with higher oxygen content. It indicates that the Ni particle is more easily oxidized by O2 during passivation and is likely more sensitive to exposure to air during sample preparation than Mo2C is."
14,Synthesis of mixed alcohols,"3.3 Synthesis of mixed alcohols 3.3.1 Catalyst performance in fixed-bed reactor Synthesis of higher alcohols was carried out in the steam jacketed tubular fixed bed reactor as a function of reaction temperature, pressure and H2/CO ratio. Some of the results are shown in Figs. 6–8 . Fig. 6 shows the data as a function of temperature. We can see that the CO conversion and higher alcohol selectivity as represented by ethanol/methanol ratio increases with temperature. CO conversion almost doubled when temperature increased from 288 to 327°C and the ethanol/methanol ratio increased by 20% over the same temperature range. An observed increase in the ethanol/methanol ratio above 316°C could be due to thermodynamic limitation of methanol formation at high temperature and incorporation of methanol into higher alcohols at high CO conversions. Incorporation of methanol into higher alcohols has been confirmed by other researchers by cofeeding methanol with synthesis gas on MoS2 catalyst. Fig. 7 shows the effect of H2/CO ratio on CO conversion and ethanol/methanol ratio. With an increase of H2/CO ratio, CO conversion increases, however higher H2/CO decreases the ethanol/methanol ratio in the product. For simplicity, equation for ethanol synthesis could be used to represent mixed alcohol synthesis. The reaction equation for ethanol synthesis is shown as Eq. (1). The stoichiometric H2/CO ratio is 2. However, NiMo2C catalyst is an excellent catalyst [39–41] for water gas shift reaction shown as Eq. (2). In most cases, the water gas shift is approaching equilibrium under current operation conditions. The production of H2O is minimal. There for, CO2 is the major oxygen sink. The overall reaction is shown in Eq. (3). (1) 4H2 +2CO=C2H5OH+H2O (2) CO+H2O=H2 +CO2 The overall reaction is as Eq. (3). (3) 3H2 +3CO=C2H5OH+CO2 The optimum H2/CO ratio for synthesis of mixed alcohols is therefore 1:1 as in Eq. (3). We can see that although CO conversion increased with higher H2/CO ratio, yield of higher alcohols actually declined. The reason for this is that higher H2/CO ratio would increase hydrogen concentration on the surface and resulting further hydrogenation of oxygenated intermediates into hydrocarbons. High H2/CO ratio may also negatively affect the carbon-carbon chain growth, resulting in decreased C2+ alcohol yield. Effect of reaction pressure on CO conversion and higher alcohol selectivity were shown in Fig. 8. CO conversion increased with pressure, while alcohol distribution shifted to lower alcohols. Ethanol/methanol ratio decreased about 20% when reaction pressure doubled. This effect may be mainly caused by thermodynamic equilibrium of methanol formation which is more favorable at higher pressures. 3.3.2 Catalyst stability test 1000h long term test of the NiMo2C catalyst was carried out with the steam jacketed tubular fixed-bed reactor and results are shown in Figs. 9–11 . During the 1000h test, temperature, pressure, H2/CO ratio and space velocity were varied. However, through the majority of the test the conditions were: T =316°C, P =10.3MPa, SV =33,481/h, and H2/CO=1, the base condition. When a set of experiments with varying conditions were finished, the reaction condition was set back to the base condition. The catalyst was stable during the 1000h on stream time. The space time yield decreased slightly from 0.28g/h to about 0.25g/h during the 1000h test with an apparent deactivation rate of about 3.0×10−5 g/h (Fig. 9). CO conversion shows a similar trend, declining about 3% during the 1000h test, as shown in Fig. 10. The alcohol selectivity remained essentially the same, while hydrocarbon (CH x ) selectivity slightly decreased and wax selectivity slightly increased, as shown in Fig. 11. Product selectivity versus time on stream (TOS) is shown in Fig. 11. The major products are composed of three categories, i.e. alcohols, light hydrocarbons and waxes. Overall alcohol selectivity is around 60%, which was stable during the entire 1000h run. Light hydrocarbons (CH x ) are around 30%, and declined slightly with TOS. About 10% wax is produced which is composed of long chain alcohols and hydrocarbons with an average carbon number in the 22–24 range. The catalyst selectivity for waxes appears to increase slightly with TOS. 3.3.3 Catalyst performance in CHER Approximately 91g of 60–80mesh NiMo2C catalyst with additional promoters were loaded onto the prototype CHER. Test conditions used were similar to those used earlier for fixed-bed reactor testing. Some of the results are compiled in Table 1 . Key findings from the data are: • Space time yield of alcohols increases with temperature and space velocity. In the data compiled in Table 1, we have achieved a STY of about 0.75g/gcat/h (0.95g/ml/h) at 307°C and 17,0001/h. Such high STY have not been achieved in fixed bed and slurry reactors because of limitations on heat and mass transfer in those reactor designs. • Among the alcohol product produced, about 75% is C2+ alcohols. Ethanol/methanol ratio is close to two and higher alcohols/methanol ratio is about 3. A product of such a composition is an excellent gasoline blend. • Overall, CHER design offers a minimum of 3× process intensification over the tubular fixed-bed reactor."
15,Conclusions,"It can be concluded that NiMo2C is a promising catalyst for synthesis of mixed alcohols with high activity and C2+ alcohol yields. 1000h test showed that the catalyst is stable in synthesis gas conversion, alcohol productivity and selectivity. Alkali metals are crucial important promoter for the molybdenum carbide based catalyst for synthesis mixed alcohols. Without alkali promoters, the product would be primarily lower hydrocarbons. However, alkali metals should be added after the molybdenum carbide formed since alkali metals are inhibitive for the carbide formation. Addition of alkali metals prior to carburization would result in an inactive catalyst. Compact heat exchange reactor with stainless steel construction is capable of operating at high temperature and pressure. A 66mL prototype compact reactor with FinTec® was fabricated and installed, and tested with synthesis of mixed alcohols. It has been demonstrated that the compact reactor has excellent heat transfer properties, and remarkable process intensifications. Since the scale up would be mainly to add more channels and modules, the behavior of scale up is easy and predictable. Compact reactor is a prominent reactor for small, portable synthesis gas conversion reactor when feed source is remote and with limited supply."
