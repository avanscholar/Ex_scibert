0,Introduction,"Bio-hydrogen production from renewable sources, which is considered a “green technology,” has received attention in recent years as an approach to promote the sustainable development of global prosperity [1]. The development of bio-hydrogen production faces a contentious problem: To seek suitable biomass for bioenergy producing. Cassava powder, from the root of the cassava plant, is mainly composed of starch, with small amount of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Because of its high yield and ability to grow well in arid areas, cassava is regarded as an ideal energy crop [2,3]. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) evaluated that the annual worldwide production of cassava reached 200Mt in 2005, with an average yield of 25–30tha−1. Cassava was reported to be an optimal biomass for ethanol fermentation [2]. Cassava might also be suitable biomass for bio-hydrogen production. Because of a shortage of food in the world, to produce bioenergy by using waste biomass was getting more and more attention. Some organic substrates such as beer lees [4], cornstalk wastes [5], starch-manufacturing wastes [6], sweet sorghum [7] and wastewater [1] have been used to produce hydrogen. Food waste, consisting mainly of starch, protein, and fat, with a small amount of cellulose and semi-cellulose, also constitutes a possible source for bioenergy production. A large amount of food waste is produced each day in the world. For example, only in China, the daily production of food wastes reaches to approximately 20,000kt in 2006 [8]. There have been some studies of bio-hydrogen production from food wastes by anaerobic fermentation [9–11], approximately 0.9–2.2molH2 mol−1 hexose was produced. A variety of organic substrates including simple and complex carbohydrates can be fermented to fatty acids and hydrogen at a relatively high rate by facultative or anaerobic bacteria including mixed anaerobic consortia [4,7,12], which was usually designated as dark fermentation. Because dark fermentation usually produces different fatty acids, its maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is relatively low, ranging from 2 to 4molmol−1 hexose according to the composition of produced fatty acids [1]. Besides, the produced volatile fatty acids in the effluent of dark fermentation may carry a potential threat to the environment. To eliminate this potential pollution problem, many efforts have been made to decompose the fatty acids and to decrease chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the fermentation effluent. Converting the fatty acids to methane in a second reactor has been proposed [13], and hydrogen–methane mixtures were produced from glucose in a two sequential stages of hydrogen and methane fermentation [13]. A more efficient two sequential steps were tested by using purple non-sulfur (PNS) photosynthetic bacteria in the second reactor [6]. Photo-fermentation by PNS bacteria produces hydrogen from fatty acids at high efficiency, including the metabolites produced during hydrogen producing by dark fermentation, such as acetate and butyrate [14–16]. Several studies have reported the two-step hydrogen production process of sequential dark- and photo-fermentation achieved higher hydrogen yields from various substrates compared to hydrogen yields by dark fermentation or photo-fermentation alone [6,17]. In our previous study, the total hydrogen yield from sucrose increased from the maximum of 3.67molH2 mol−1 sucrose in dark fermentation to 6.63molH2 mol−1 sucrose by using the two-step process [17]. In this study, a two-step process of sequential dark- and photo-fermentation was established to produce hydrogen from cassava and food waste. And the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD during the two-step hydrogen producing process was also investigated in order to address how much waste could be removed through the hydrogen producing system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial inocula for dark fermentation and photo-fermentation,"2.1 Microbial inocula for dark fermentation and photo-fermentation Cattle dung compost was collected from the suburb of Xi'an City, China, mixed with water (1:10, w/v), boiled for 15min, and used as the dark-fermentation inoculum. Rhodobacter sphaeroides (R. sphaeroides) ZX-5, isolated from wastewater in our laboratory [18], was used as the inoculum for photo-fermentation. R. sphaeroides ZX-5 cells were pre-cultured aerobically in RCVB medium [17] in a shaker at 200rpm at 30±2°C for approximately 24h (OD660 =1.8–2.0). After centrifugation, the concentrated cells were suspended with the same volume RCVB medium without carbon and nitrogen source."
3,Hydrogen production in dark fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen production in dark fermentation Cassava powder was suspended in distilled water and boiled with stirring until clear. Food waste was collected from our institute's cafeteria. The refuse was crushed into homogenate before use. Dark fermentation was performed in 38-ml tubes in batch tests. Tubes were filled with 29ml of modified dark-fermentation medium and 1ml of pretreated cattle dung compost. 1l of fermentation medium contained 1.5g KH2PO4, 4.2g Na2HPO4·12H2O, 0.18g MgCl2·6H2O, 2g yeast extract, 0.1g FeSO4·7H2O and 1.5g glutamate as nitrogen source as well as 2ml trace element solution (per litter containing 28.6g H3BO3, 12g CoCl2·6H2O, 1.66g FeCl3·6H2O, 16g MnSO4·H2O). The concentrations of carbon source were 18, 20, and 18gl−1 cassava, food waste (dry weight), and sucrose, respectively. The initial pH value was adjusted to 6.8. To check whether the inocula solution or yeast extract would serve as carbon source for hydrogen production, two series of controls were carried out: Control A, without yeast extract and extra carbon source; and Control B, without extra carbon source, but containing the same amount of yeast extract used in the dark-fermentation medium. Test tubes sealed with rubber stoppers were kept at 37±1°C in a dark biochemical incubator and 60-ml syringes were used to collect and measure the biogas production. All batch tests were performed in triplication."
4,Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation,"2.3 Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation Dark-fermentation effluent from the batch test was centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10min, and then diluted to 50% (v/v) and adjusted as pH 7.0 for the optimal conditions for photo-fermentation [17]. Whereas, the photo-fermentation medium had the same composition as the modified RCVB medium, except for the carbon and nitrogen sources. Photo-fermentation with 32ml of medium and 2ml of pre-cultured ZX-5 cells suspension was performed in 38-ml anaerobic tubes at 30°C under 4000lux illumination. The tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers, and 60-ml syringes were used to collect and measure the gas produced."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The produced gas (mainly H2 and CO2) was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a GC7900 (Techcomp, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. A 5-m stainless transformer oil analysis column was packed with acidic ethyl acetate (AE), with nitrogen as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20mlmin−1. The temperature of the injector, column, and detector was kept at 80, 80, and 130°C, respectively. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were quantified by GC (Shimadzu 17A, Kyoto, Japan) using a flame ionization detector and a 30-m FFAP capillary column. The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 and 260°C, respectively. The column was held at 80°C for 2min, heated to 200°C at 5°Cmin−1, and then maintained at 200°C for 1min. The carrier gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of 70mlmin−1. The volume of hydrogen gas produced in all of the batch fermentations was converted to normal conditions. Hydrogen yield is measured as the ratio of the actual volume of hydrogen produced to the mass of the input carbon sources. The final photo-fermentation effluent samples were first centrifuged at 5000rpm for 10min and then measured for COD value according to standard methods [7] by water quality analyzer (ET99731, Lovibond, German). The light intensity was measured by digital illuminance meter (TES-1335, TES Electrical Electronic Corp., Taiwan). The pH of the medium was measured by a pH meter (Model 320, Mettler-Toledo Co.). The OD was measured using a Spectrophotometer (UV-2802S, Unico, China) at 660nm. All of the data, including hydrogen yield, concentration of fatty acids, and cumulative hydrogen production, are the mean values of triplicate experiments."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production in dark fermentation,"3.1 Hydrogen production in dark fermentation The cumulative hydrogen production and pH during the fermentation of cassava, food waste, and sucrose were measured during dark fermentation (Fig. 1 ). Hydrogen production from all three substrates was detected after a short lag phase of approximately 12h. The maximum hydrogen production rate during dark fermentation of cassava, food waste, and sucrose were 203, 165, and 184mll−1 h−1, respectively. The cumulative hydrogen production from food waste and cassava peaked at 84h, and that from sucrose around 96h. Many studies demonstrated that the pH affected the specific hydrogen production rate, hydrogen production yield, biogas content, and type of organic acids produced. Initial pH values of 4.5–8.0 for dark fermentation have been used in hydrogen production [11,19–22]. Lower initial pH results in a longer duration of hydrogen production or lower hydrogen production rate [23,24]. We used an initial pH of 6.8; the pH of the fermentation effluents decreased quickly within the first 12h, during which time no hydrogen production was detected (Fig. 1). The pH during the first 12h of sucrose fermentation decreased from 6.89 to 5.4, more dramatically than that of food waste and cassava, which are mainly composed of starch. This might be because sucrose is acidified more easily than starch. The dramatically decreased pH during sucrose fermentation might also be related to the longer time needed to achieve peak cumulative hydrogen production (Fig. 1). After 24h, the pH dropped slowly from 5.01 to 4.76, accompanied by a decrease in hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield, final pH, and concentration of volatile organic byproducts in the final fermentation effluents were summarized in Table 1 . The maximum hydrogen yield from cassava, food waste, and sucrose was 212, 226, and 223mlg−1 substrate, respectively. Theoretically, each gram of polysaccharides produces a maximum of 553ml (507ml, standard conditions) of hydrogen (be equal to 4mol H2 mol−1 hexose), assuming that acetate is the sole byproduct [24]. The hydrogen yield by dark fermentation of cassava, food waste, and sucrose represented 39.3, 43.4, and 42.2% of the stoichiometric yield (i.e. 4mol H2 mol−1 hexose), respectively. Butyrate and acetate were the main byproducts during hydrogen production from the three carbon sources (Table 1), and the butyrate/acetate ratios were all >1.0. High butyrate/acetate ratios may be one reason that hydrogen yields in dark fermentation were relatively low (Table 1) compared to the stoichiometric yield 4mol H2 mol−1 hexose on the assumption that acetate be the sole byproduct [24]. Moreover, butanol and propionate were detected at lower concentrations in the fermentation effluents, which also consumed some NADH, accounting for part of the decrease in hydrogen yield."
8,Hydrogen production from dark-fermentation effluents by photo-fermentation using R. sphaeroides ZX-5,"3.2 Hydrogen production from dark-fermentation effluents by photo-fermentation using R. sphaeroides ZX-5 R. sphaeroides ZX-5 isolated in our laboratory can use acetate, lactate, malate, succinate, and butyrate to produce hydrogen with high efficiency [18]. Fig. 2 showed that the volatile byproducts in the dark-fermentation effluents of food waste, cassava and sucrose could be consumed by R. sphaeroides ZX-5. We traced the variation in the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and butanol in the photo-fermentation. The concentrations of acetate in the three dark-fermentation effluents decreased quickly and were completely consumed by R. sphaeroides ZX-5 within 32h (Fig. 2). Although the initial concentration of butanol was lower than that of acetate, R. sphaeroides ZX-5 took longer to consume butanol. The concentration of butyrate also decreased more slowly than that of acetate, and the consumption of butyrate by R. sphaeroides ZX-5 took >192h. The above results are similar to those of Shi and Yu [25], suggesting that acetate usually be more favorable to PNS bacteria. Further studies will be necessary to optimize the appropriate conditions for lower butyrate and higher acetate production in dark fermentation in the future. During the photo-fermentation of the above effluents as carbon sources, hydrogen gas was first detected at 16h after R. sphaeroides ZX-5 was inoculated. Organic acids utilized by R. sphaeroides ZX-5 might be mainly used for cell growth in the initial 16h and for hydrogen production thereafter. Hydrogen production lasted for 268, 168, 320h from batch cassava, food waste and sucrose, respectively. The maximal hydrogen production rates from the dark-fermentation effluents of cassava, food waste, and sucrose were 70, 116 and 92mll−1 h−1, respectively. The presence of butyrate as the main carbon source in the effluents might partly explain the longer duration of hydrogen production and lower hydrogen production rate in photo-fermentation. We previously found the same phenomenon when butyrate was used as the individual carbon source for photo-fermentation [18]. The hydrogen yield from the above diluted dark-fermentation effluents of cassava, food waste, and sucrose by R. sphaeroides ZX-5 was 611±11, 451±20, and 565±13mlg−1 substrate, respectively. It seems to be unreasonable that less hydrogen was produced by photo-fermentation of the diluted dark-fermentation effluent from food waste than from cassava or sucrose, although the concentration of volatile byproducts (especially butyrate) was higher in the dark-fermentation effluent from food waste than from cassava or sucrose. However, the OD660 value, reflecting cell growth of R. sphaeroides ZX-5, increased to 3.99±0.24 at 36h in food waste group, which was much higher than other batches (i.e. 2.99±0.02 for cassava, 2.32±0.24 for sucrose). The result indicated that the dark-fermentation effluent of food waste slightly favored the growth of PNS bacteria compared to that of cassava and sucrose. And this result might also suggest that a higher butyrate level was favorable for cell growth but detrimental to H2 production [25]."
9,Total hydrogen yields and COD removal by the process of sequential dark fermentation and photo-fermentation,"3.3 Total hydrogen yields and COD removal by the process of sequential dark fermentation and photo-fermentation If the 18gl−1 cassava and 20gl−1 food waste used in our batch fermentations were supposed to be equivalent hexose, the total hydrogen yields from cassava and food waste were estimated as 6.51mol H2 mol−1 hexose and 5.4mol H2 mol−1 using sequential dark fermentation and photo-fermentation, which were equivalent to 54.3% and 45.0% of the theoretical substrate conversion efficiency (12mol H2 mol−1 hexose), respectively. The actual hydrogen yields in our systems must be higher than the above values, because other compounds not for hydrogen producing may also exist in cassava or food waste. Under the present conditions, the dark fermentation of cassava and food waste produced 1.60mol H2 and 1.77mol H2 mol−1 hexose, respectively (Table 2 ). However, the two-step hydrogen production process adopted in this study increased the hydrogen yield by more than twofold compared to that by dark fermentation only. Until now, the highest hydrogen yield from food waste was reported as 2.2mol H2 mol−1 hexose [26]. The total hydrogen yield in the present study was near 2.5 fold of the reported maximum hydrogen yield. An additional consideration is that the byproducts of fatty acids, which contribute to the high COD and low pH in the dark-fermentation effluent and give off an unpleasant odor, may be a potential threat to the environment. Methane fermentation was employed in a sequential stage to take usage of fatty acids and to remove COD from the hydrogen producing effluent [13]. However, such a two-step process produced a mixture of hydrogen and methane. Due to the popular interest in H2 fuels and fuel cells, hydrogen production from fatty acids in the sequential reactor attracted more attention [27,28]. Our investigates demonstrated that the fatty acids in the effluent from dark fermentation could be utilized well in photo-fermentation, and the COD in the final photo-fermentation effluent decreased greatly with a removal efficiency of 84.3% and 80.2% compared with the original COD value of dark-fermentation medium of cassava and food waste, respectively (Table 2). Therefore, the two-step process combining dark fermentation and photo-fermentation can be a promising alternative to solve the problems caused by fatty acids in anaerobic fermentation effluents."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, the process of sequential dark fermentation and photo-fermentation could produce hydrogen from cassava and food waste at relatively high conversion efficiencies and reach two-four fold hydrogen yields that dark fermentation did. It also demonstrated that cassava and food waste were both ideal biomass resources for bio-hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the hydrogen producing process also removed 84.3% COD from cassava and 80.2% COD from food waste in the fermentation batches, suggesting that it would also promise to be useful in waste treatment."
