0,Introduction,"The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the carbon source for producing value-added compounds holds great promise for mitigating this greenhouse gas and simultaneous generation of fuels and commodity chemicals. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction has been demonstrated to be a feasible approach to produce a variety of chemical products such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), alcohols, and hydrocarbons [1,2]. Nickel-based catalysts have received enormous attention for catalyzing the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, with the dominant products being CH4 over large Ni nanoparticles and CO over small Ni nanoclusters. The threshold for the product selectivity variation seems to vary with the support [3–6]. The underlying size-selectivity relationship of supported Ni catalysts has been extensively discussed in the literature, but mainly based on somewhat simplified models with a pristine catalyst surface such as idealistic Ni(111), Ni(100) single crystals [7–9]. Under reaction conditions, the catalyst surface usually contains different types of adsorbed species undergoing dynamic transformation. Meanwhile, many studies have indicated that the surface adsorbed species can affect reaction pathways. For instance, in CO2 hydrogenation, Yang et al. found the high-density hydroxyl species on RhFeLi/TiO2 catalyst stabilize formate species and protonate methanol, which results in high ethanol selectivity [10]. Pan et al. conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations for CO2 hydrogenation by a supported Ni4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and concluded that CO formation is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than the formation of surface formate on a hydroxylated surface [11]. Herein, we applied temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), in situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations to reveal the role of surface hydroxyls in determining the product selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation (to CO and CH4) over supported nickel catalysts."
1,Materials and methods,"The Ni2.7 and Ni11.5 were prepared with a deposition–precipitation method using SiO2 (Evonik, AEROSIL 380, 99.8%) as the catalyst support. First, SiO2 (2 g) was dispersed in deionized water (100 mL) under sonication to form a slurry. A solution of the desired amount of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate in 10 mL water was then added to the SiO2–water mixture under sonication. Afterwards, the mixture was stirred under vigorous mechanical stirring. 2.5 g of Na2CO3 was dissolved in 10 mL DI water and added to the solution mixture dropwise. The stirring was continued for 90 min before the solid product was collected by centrifugation (10000 rpm for 5 min). The product was then washed thoroughly with DI water 4 times to remove the Na impurities. The solid precursor was dried at 90 °C overnight and then calcined at 450 °C (2 °C/min) for 3 h to obtain Ni2.7 and Ni11.5 samples. The catalyst morphology and Ni particle size were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8-Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα ray source (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The steady-state CO2 methanation activities were evaluated in a fixed-bed plug flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Approximately 100 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-type quartz tube and held in place with quartz wool. Before the reaction test, the catalysts were activated in a reaction gas mixture (15% CO2/60% H2/25% N2, Air Liquid) at 400 °C for 1 h with a volumetric flow of 50 sccm. The reaction products were analyzed by an online gas chromatography (Ruimin GC 2060, Shanghai) equipped with a 5A Molecular sieve, Porapak T column, TCD, FID, and a methanizer. The CO and CO2 were transformed into CH4 through a methanizer and analyzed with the FID detector. To evaluate the catalytic performance at different temperatures, the reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium for 1 h before conversion and selectivity data were collected. Steady-state performance at various WHSV was evaluated by adjusting the catalyst loadings from 150 mg to 2.5 mg. The quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected with a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV, pass energy 20.0 eV). A pretreatment chamber was used for catalyst activation. Afterwards, the chamber was evacuated, and the sample was directly transferred into the analysis chamber in a vacuum to avoid exposure to air. The catalyst was first dehydrated in N2 at 400 °C and then exposed to the CO2 hydrogenation reaction for 1–30 min. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CO temperature-programmed reduction (CO-TPR) measurements were conducted with a Tianjin Xianquan TP-5080B chemisorption instrument. 100 mg of catalysts were loaded into the quartz reactor. The TPR spectra for the dehydrated catalyst were collected after the sample was dehydrated in N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The sample was then cooled in N2 to room temperature, and the baseline of H2 signal was collected. The H2-TPR and CO-TPR experiments were operated from 28 °C to 850 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C /min in 30 sccm of 10% H2/N2 (Air Liquid) and 1% CO/Ar, respectively. The pretreatment conditions for catalyst samples exposed to reaction conditions were: after dehydration at 400 °C, reactant gas (15% CO2/60% H2/25% N2) was flown at 30 sccm for different periods. Afterwards, the residual reactants and adsorbed reactive intermediates were removed by flushing N2 at 400 °C for 15 min. The sample was then cooled in N2 to room temperature, and the same H2-TPR procedure was performed as above. A TCD detected the consumption of H2, and product evolutions were monitored by a Mass Spectrometer. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) during CO2 hydrogenation and the subsequent room temperature adsorption of CO were measured on a Nicolet Model iS-50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector. Approximately 25 mg of catalyst powder was loaded in a typical experiment. In situ DRIFTS of low-temperature CO adsorption was conducted on a BRUKER TENSOR 27 spectrometer equipped with an in situ reaction cell, allowing CO adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature. All theoretical calculations presented in this work were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [12,13]. The periodic spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the projected augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials to describe the interactions between valence and core electrons [14]. The exchange–correlation energy of the electrons was treated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [15,16]. A plane-wave basis set for electronic wave function expansion with a cutoff energy of 400 eV was applied. The sampling of the Brillouin zone was used by the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [17,18]. A smearing width of 0.2 eV was employed via the Methfessel-Paxton technique. The criterion of force convergence on each atom was less than 0.05 eV/Å. Other experimental details can be found in supporting information."
2,Results and discussion,"Supported Ni/SiO2 catalysts, with nominal loadings of 10 and 40 wt% Ni were prepared via the deposition–precipitation method allowing precise control of particle size distribution. As indicated from the XRD patterns, the as-prepared catalysts contain highly dispersed ultra-small NiO particles reflected by the broad Ni diffraction peaks at 34.9, 41.2 and 60.8° (Fig. S1). The average particle sizes of the supported Ni catalysts after CO2 hydrogenation are determined to be 2.7 nm for 10% Ni/SiO2 and 11.5 nm for 40% Ni/SiO2 (Table S1, Fig. 1 a,b and Fig. S2). The two catalysts are denoted as Ni2.7 and Ni11.5, respectively, to highlight their size difference. Their performance for CO2 hydrogenation was evaluated (Fig. S3), with the results agreeing well with the literature that CH4 production is favored on large Ni particles. The increasing CO selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation with increasing weight hourly specific velocity (WHSV) suggesting gaseous CO is a key intermediate [7,8]. The nature of surface hydroxyl species on Ni2.7 and Ni11.5 catalysts was probed with H2-TPR. Fresh Ni11.5 shows both lower reduction onset (~400 vs. 550 °C) and peak temperature (~661 vs. 716 °C) compared to Ni2.7. Interestingly, the reduction profiles of the catalysts subjected to CO2 hydrogenation reveal a 71–89% increase in H2 consumption, implying that additional reducible species were generated during CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 1c, Table S2). As the online mass spectrometer only detects H2O formation during the reduction with H2 (Fig. S4), the increased H2 consumption must be attributed to the formation of surface hydroxyl (OH*) species accumulated on the catalyst during the reaction [19]. Furthermore, the CO-TPR spectra (Fig. 1d) for Ni2.7 and Ni11.5 after the CO2 hydrogenation reaction indicate production of H2 alongside CO2, providing additional evidence for the presence of surface OH*, which is known to react with CO (2CO + 2OH → 2CO2 + H2) [20]. The ratio of CO2 to H2 was measured to be 2.94 and 4.21 for Ni2.7 and Ni11.5, suggesting additional CO2 was formed from the reduction of NiO with CO, which will be illustrated by our XPS results shown below. The chemical state of the catalyst surface was analyzed by quasi in situ XPS. The spectra of the Ni 2p region for both fresh Ni2.7 and Ni11.5 reveal bands at 880.3, 874.1 and 856.8 eV that are characteristics of Ni2+ (Fig. 1e, f) [21,22]. Exposing the catalysts to a mixture of H2/CO2 at 400 °C results in the gradual formation of metallic Ni0 as indicated by the new peaks at ca. 870.0 and 852.7 eV (Fig. S5a) [23]. The corresponding XPS spectra of the O 1s region exhibit decreased signal intensity from the removal of oxygen atoms by the reductive reaction treatment (Fig. S5b, c). The Ni2+ species, however, do not completely reduce after a 30-min exposure to the reaction conditions. The Ni11.5 catalyst contains a higher fraction of metallic Ni (47%) than Ni2.7 (33%). The unreduced Ni2+ might be attributed to the strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 at the interior metal-support region [24,25]. The lower fraction of Ni0 for Ni2.7 is because of its much smaller particle size that results in the greater portion of Ni atoms at the interfacial region. Additionally, a shoulder in the XPS Ni 2p spectra at the binding energy of 858.0 eV emerges after the reaction corresponds to surface hydroxyl species on metallic Ni nanoparticles (Fig. S6) [26]. Comparing the catalysts after the reaction treatment and the initial dehydrated catalysts indicates a slight broadening of the O 1s peak, which is consistent with the formation of surface hydroxyl groups (Fig. S5b, c) [27]. The in situ FTIRspectra of CO adsorption on Ni/SiO2 after exposure to the CO2 hydrogenation reaction are presented in Fig. 2 . Adsorption of CO was implemented at room temperature to probe Ni0 sites with a diffuse reflectance mode and at ca. −150 °C to probe Niδ+/SiO2 surface sites in the transmission mode. After the reaction treatment and exposure to a CO environment, the catalysts exhibited IR bands for gaseous CO (2173 and 2115 cm−1) and adsorbed CO species (Fig. 2a, 2b). The Ni11.5 catalyst has surface bicarbonate species at 1641 cm−1 and adsorbed *CO species at 2058 cm−1 [28]. Surface bicarbonates are known to form by the interaction of *CO with surface oxygen and hydroxyl species. Ni2.7, in contrast, only exhibits surface bicarbonate species at 1681 cm−1 with negligible amounts of adsorbed *CO, which is direct proof of the weak CO adsorption ability of small Ni particles [29]. The observations provide direct proof to the recent literature that selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation depends on CO adsorption on different Ni particles. At ca. −150 °C, Ni11.5 exhibits two strong bands at 2170 and 2160 cm−1 that are characteristics of CO adsorption on dispersed Ni2+ and Ni0-OH sites, respectively (Fig. 2c, d). Two shoulder bands at 2154 and 2137 cm−1 are assigned to CO adsorption on the SiO2 support (Fig. S7). The IR spectrum for Ni2.7 shows a lower intensity of the 2161 cm−1 band, indicating fewer surface Ni0-OH hydroxyl sites. Combining the H2-TPR, quasi in situ XPS and in situ DRIFTS results, it is found that Ni11.5 generates more surface hydroxyl species than Ni2.7. These surface hydroxyls positively correlate with the content of Ni and, hence, are different from the Si-OH hydroxyls on the SiO2 support. In situ DRIFTS of CO2 hydrogenation focusing on the 3000–4000 cm−1 region (Fig. S8) identifies the Si-OH species at 3663 and 3734 cm−1 and Ni0-OH species at 3619 cm−1 [30]. Table S3 summarizes all peak assignments. It can then be concluded that the generated hydroxyl groups during CO2 hydrogenation locate on the surface of metallic Ni0 and interfacial region of Ni0-SiO2. The experimental observations motivated a series of DFT calculations to bring fundamental theoretical insights into the relationship between surface hydroxyls and CO adsorption strength [8,31,32]. The observations from both literature findings and the steady-state reactivity (after 30 min of reaction, Fig. S3) of CO2 hydrogenation indicate that the adsorption of COg is a key descriptor in determining product selectivity. Firstly, the model was calibrated by calculating the adsorption energy (Eads) of CO on different facets of fcc-Ni single crystals. The obtained values of ca. −1.92 eV agree well with the literature (Fig. S9) [33]. Then, we built Ni1/SiO2 and Ni10/SiO2 catalyst models to examine the effect of Ni particle size for supported nickel catalysts. Large binding energy values for the surface hydroxyls on the Ni-SiO2 interface (-3.81 eV and −3.10 eV) suggested that they are stable surface intermediates and, therefore, expected to be ubiquitous on the catalyst surface during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction (Figs. S10 and S11). The stabilities of the models were confirmed by vibrational analysis, and there is no imaginary frequency. Based on the vibrational frequencies (Tables S4 and S5), the ZPE (E0) of OH*-free Ni10/SiO2(110) and hydroxylated Ni10/SiO2(110) surfaces are 0.28 eV and 0.66 eV, respectively. Adsorption of CO on Ni/SiO2 with and without surface OH* was investigated with the results shown in Fig. 3 . The adsorption of CO was somewhat weakened relative to fcc-Ni single crystals yet remained strong for the hydroxyl-free surfaces. We obtained the Eads value of −1.71 eV on Ni1/SiO2 and −1.53 to −1.85 eV on Ni10/SiO2 (Fig. 3a-d). The DFT calculations reveal that the Ni-SiO2 interface binds CO less strongly than the metallic Ni0 sites. Introducing a hydroxyl group to the Ni-SiO2 interface results in decreasing the CO adsorption energies: Eads of CO reduces by 14% to −1.31 eV at the interfacial site of Ni10/SiO2 and by 5–6% to −1.63 to −1.73 eV at the Ni0 sites (Fig. 3e-h, S12, and S13). It is obvious that the CO adsorption on smaller Ni nanoparticles is more prone to inhibition by the surface hydroxyl groups. The hydroxylated Ni1/SiO2 exhibits the weakest adsorption towards CO, with Eads decreased by 29% to −1.22 eV. It is worthwhile to mention that the relatively high ability of large Ni particles to adsorb and stabilize surface CO species under reaction conditions is beneficial for the subsequent hydrogenation reaction to yield CH4, while too weak adsorption of CO on small Ni particles only leads to the formation of gaseous CO as the major reaction product. In conclusion, the combination of H2-TPR, CO-TPR, quasi in situ XPS and in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption offers a thorough illustration of surface hydroxyl formation on Ni/SiO2 catalysts during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. DFT calculation provides insights that under the influence of surface hydroxyls, small Ni0 particles cannot capture and adsorb COg while large Ni0 particles are capable of re-adsorbing COg as intermediate for further hydrogenation. This study provides new insight into the size-selectivity relationship of supported Ni nanoparticles for the CO2. hydrogenation reaction."
