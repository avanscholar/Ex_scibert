0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is considered as a promising sustainable resource under the increasingly tense situation of energy and environment [1]. However, there are some key problems restrict the further progress of hydrogen energy, especially the challenge of hydrogen storage [2,3]. In recent years, plenty of efforts have been devoted to the research of hydrogen storage materials with high stability and reserves. Carbon materials have become an attractive option for hydrogen storage due to the simple preparation process, low cost, high storage capacity and fast desorption speed [4–9]. Therefore, the exploration of carbon materials with excellent hydrogen storage performance is of great importance. Carbon materials with a certain pore structure, including activated carbon [10–12], carbon aerogels [13] and carbon nanotubes [14,15], have been broadly explored as hydrogen storage media. Biomass has been proved to be an important raw material for making functional materials, including carbon materials and applying in various applications [16–20]. Low-cost activated carbon, which can be expediently mass produced from renewable biomass, has attracted great attention. Rowlandson et al. found the active carbons from lignin exhibited a high surface area (>1000 m2/g) and hydrogen storage capacity of 1.8 wt% at 77 K under 1 bar [21]. Dogan et al. synthesized activated carbon samples by KOH activation of tangerine peel and the hydrogen storage capacity at low temperature of 77 K under the pressure of 30 bar was 1.11 wt% [22]. Anson et al. reported that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were 0.01 wt% and 1 wt% under atmospheric pressure at 298 K and 77 K respectively [23]. There are many factors influence the hydrogen storage performance of carbon materials, such as specific surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and temperature. Many experimental and theoretical studies have proved that the hydrogen adsorption of carbon materials only occurs at low temperature, which is extremely limited at ambient temperature [24–26]. In addition, the specific surface area and micropore volume of porous carbon materials are directly proportional to the hydrogen adsorption capacity to a certain extent [27–29]. The traditional activated carbons are mostly prepared from the residual carbon skeleton of biomass, which contain ash impurities and have imperfect pore structure due to the constraints of biomass structure. Li et al. prepared hierarchical porous carbon with high specific surface area (1167–1409 m2/g) from bio-oil using nano-MgO as template and applied as high-performance supercapacitors [30]. In our previous study, we used the heavy fraction of bio-oil as carbon source and calcium citrate as template to prepare porous carbon materials with high specific surface area (1688 m2/g) for hydrogen storage [31]. Therefore, it is promising to use the biomass pyrolysis products as the carbon-containing precursor to prepare high-quality carbon materials. The macromolecular components of biomass pyrolysis vapors are regarded as ideal carbon sources to prepare porous carbons for the abundant functional groups, high carbon content and the strong ability to condense and coke. The utilization of macromolecular components of biomass pyrolysis vapors before condensation can not only reduce the heating energy consumption of preparing carbon-containing precursors, but also co-produce the high-quality light bio-oil after the carbon-containing precursor preparation device. In this work, macromolecular components of biomass pyrolysis vapors were used as the carbon source through CaO-template method to prepare porous carbon materials. This work realized the utilization of macromolecular components of biomass pyrolysis vapors before condensation. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on the yield and properties of the three-phase products, as well as the structural characteristics of porous carbon materials were investigated. The hydrogen adsorption capacity of the obtained porous carbons was evaluated. In addition, the carbonization mechanism of the carbon-containing precursor was investigated and a five-stage reaction kinetic model was established to describe the weight loss process of the carbon-containing precursor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of the carbon-containing precursor,"2.1 Preparation of the carbon-containing precursor The carbon-containing precursor and porous carbon preparation system is shown in Fig. 1 . The most important feature of this experimental system is that the pyrolysis of biomass and the preparation of carbon-containing precursor can be carried out simultaneously, so as to realize the utilization of biomass pyrolysis vapors before condensation. Compared with using bio-oil (condensed pyrolysis vapors) as carbon source, this design has the advantages of reducing heating energy consumption during the carbon-containing precursor preparation process and co-producing high-quality light bio-oil at the back end. The system mainly consisted of six parts: gas supply and controlling device, pyrolysis reactor, temperature controlling unit, carbon-containing precursor preparation device, circulating water and condenser unit, and gas treatment and collecting device. The carbon-containing precursor preparation device consisted of a custom quartz reactor and a thermostatic magnetic stirrer. The temperature and speed of the device were controlled by the thermostatic magnetic stirrer. The custom quartz reactor was made up of two parts that could be joined together by a frosted section. There were two tubes on the quartz reactor. When it works, the vapors entered one of the tubes and reacted with the solution of calcium citrate. The rest of the vapors went out to a condenser. The biomass feedstock of the experiment was pinewood pellets (provided by a wood processing factory, Nanjing, Jiangsu). Calcium citrate tetrahydrate (Macklin, analytical reagent, 99%) was used as CaO-template in the experiment. Prior to the experiment, the pinewood was dried in an oven at 378 K for 48 h. Subsequently, 300 g dried pinewood was placed in the fixed-bed reactor. A certain heating rate was set and kept the reactor at the preset pyrolysis temperature for 1 h under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere with flow rate of 400 mL/min. The solution of calcium citrate and ethanol had been prepared in the quartz reactor. When the pyrolysis reaction started, the generated pyrolysis vapors entered the quartz reactor and the macromolecular components were trapped in the quartz reactor while the rest vapors entered the condenser and was collected as light bio-oil. The non-condensing gas was collected in the gas-collecting bag. When the pyrolysis went into the cooling stage, the magnetic stirrer was set to a certain preparation temperature and the stirring speed was set as 300 rpm. The mixture solution in the quartz was stirred and evaporated to obtain the dried homogenized carbon-containing precursor. The volatiles produced in this stage were also collected as light bio-oil or uncondensed gas. The whole preparation of the carbon-containing precursor lasted about 3 h."
3,Preparation of porous carbon materials,"2.2 Preparation of porous carbon materials Fig. 1 also illustrates the preparation of porous carbons. Firstly, the dried carbon-containing precursor was evenly spread in a quartz boat for carbonization in a tubular furnace. The furnace was heated at a rate of 10 K/min to 1073 K and kept for 2 h. The flow rate of nitrogen was maintained at 220 mL/min. After cooling to room temperature, the carbon/CaO composite powder was obtained. Subsequently, the powder was washed with 2 M HCl solution and then thoroughly washed with deionized water to neutral. Finally, the powder was dried in an oven at 378 K for 12 h to obtain the porous carbon materials. According to the different preparation conditions of carbon-containing precursors, the prepared porous carbon materials were named as BG-X, BG-Y or BG-Z, where X represents the pyrolysis temperature, Y represents the pyrolysis heating rate and Z represents the preparation temperature in the magnetic stirrer."
4,Material characterization,"2.3 Material characterization In the experiment, the pyrolysis products of pinewood were divided into four parts: pyrolytic carbon, carbon-containing precursor, light bio-oil and uncondensed gas. The yield of each part of products was calculated by the following equations. (2-1) Y S = m 1 m 0 × 100 % (2-2) Y G = m 2 m 0 × 100 % (2-3) Y L = m 3 - m 4 m 0 × 100 % (2-4) Y C = 1 - Y S - Y G - Y L where YS , YC , YL , YG indicate the yield of pyrolytic carbon, carbon-containing precursor, light bio-oil and uncondensed gas, respectively, m0 is the mass of pinewood for pyrolysis, m1 is the mass of pyrolytic carbon, m2 is the mass of uncondensed gas, m3 is the mass of collected condensed liquid, and m4 is the mass of ethanol in the quartz reactor at the start. The microscopic morphology and structure of the porous carbons prepared were analyzed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU8010 microscope from Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Jeol Jem 2100F). The nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted at 77 K using Vsorp 2800 Adsorption Instrument. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution of the carbon materials was determined by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) method. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the surface functional groups of porous carbons. The scanning was done in 3500–400 cm−1 wavenumber range with 64 scans. The compositions and content of light bio-oil were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent Technology-7890B-GC system & 5977B-MSD). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were carried out to study the carbonization mechanism of the carbon-containing precursor on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were performed on the carbon-containing precursor from 298 K to 1073 K under N2 atmosphere (Discovery TGA 0550)."
5,Hydrogen adsorption experiments,"2.4 Hydrogen adsorption experiments The hydrogen adsorption capacity of the porous carbon prepared under the optimal working conditions was investigated. Prior to the experiment, the sample was degassed at 473 K overnight (10 h). The multi-station gas adsorption instrument (Beishide Instrument, 3H-2000PS) was used to measure the H2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of the sample at 77 K over the pressure range of 0–0.1 MPa. The adsorption temperature was controlled by liquid nitrogen and liquid argon while the hydrogen pressure in system was commanded by the direct-acting plunger solenoid valves. The high-purity hydrogen (99.9%) used in the experiment was in-situ generated by a high-purity hydrogen generator (Parker Dominick Hunter)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of pyrolysis temperature on the experimental results,"3.1 Effects of pyrolysis temperature on the experimental results Pyrolysis temperature is an important parameter affecting the pyrolysis products and the future preparation of carbon materials [32]. The experimental results were obtained under different pyrolysis temperatures with the other experimental conditions unchanged (pyrolysis heating rate of 10 K/min and precursor preparation temperature of 473 K). 3.1.1 Effects of pyrolysis temperature on distribution of products To explore the effects of pyrolysis temperature on the distribution of each product, the yield analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 2 . The detailed data of mass distribution of each product at different pyrolysis temperatures are listed in Table 1 . With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the yield of pyrolytic carbon decreases from 43.45% to 26.31%, while the yield of uncondensed gas increases from 22.47% to 32.03%. At the same time, the yield of light bio-oil first increases and then decreases, reaching a maximum value of 29.87% at 823 K. The yield of carbon-containing precursor increases significantly at first and remains unchanged after 823 K. As an endothermic reaction, the temperature increase in the pyrolysis process intensifies the chemical bond breaking and rearrangement, accompanied by the production of various volatile substances, thus increasing the yields of carbon-containing precursor and light bio-oil. However, too high pyrolysis temperature may promote the secondary pyrolysis of the macromolecular pyrolysis vapors and smaller molecule gas will be generated, which leads to the gradual increase of the yield of uncondensed gas. The yield of pyrolytic carbon decreases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, which is mainly due to the decomposition of coke at high temperature. 3.1.2 Effects of pyrolysis temperature on properties of porous carbons The carbon-containing precursors obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures were carbonized, acid pickled and dried to prepare porous carbon materials, denoted as BG-X, where X represents the pyrolysis temperature. To explore the structural characteristics of the prepared carbon materials, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted and some important parameters are shown in Table 2 . It can be seen that the BG-823 possesses the highest specific surface area, micropore volume and microporosity. As indicated in Fig. 3 , with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the specific surface area and the micropore volume of porous carbon materials both increase rapidly, reaching the peak at 823 K and then show a slight fluctuation. The mass ratio of the template calcium citrate to the feedstock pinewood used in the experiment was fixed as 1:4. Under low pyrolysis temperature, less pyrolysis vapors is generated and the amount of calcium citrate is excessive, which leads to the non-uniform mixing and reaction of the calcium citrate / macromolecular pyrolysis vapors system in the preparation process of carbon-containing precursors. Therefore, the specific surface area of the porous carbon materials prepared is small. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the amount of pyrolysis vapors combined with the template calcium citrate increases gradually and the mixing of the calcium citrate / macromolecular pyrolysis vapors system becomes more uniform, resulting in the more abundant pore structure of the prepared porous carbons. It is worth mentioning that the chemical compositions of the pyrolysis vapors have difference under different pyrolysis temperatures. With the increase of the pyrolysis temperature, more substances that have more difficulty to volatilize will contact with the calcium citrate in the reactor, which may have effects on the prepared carbon materials. When the pyrolysis temperature is up to 823 K, the prepared BG-823 has the optimum pore structure with the largest specific surface area (1703 m2/g) and highest micropore volume (0.51 cm3/g) and microporosity (24.17%). 3.1.3 Effects of pyrolysis temperature on properties of light bio-oil When preparing the carbon-containing precursor, the macromolecular components with high boiling-point in the pyrolysis vapors reacted with the template, and the other pyrolysis vapors entered the condenser and turned into light bio-oil. The components of light bio-oil were divided into eight categories: acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, hydrocarbons (HCs), phenols and others [33]. As presented in Fig. 4 , with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the relative contents of acids, aldehydes and ketones appear a downward trend as a whole. On the one hand, the increase of pyrolysis temperature provides energy for the fracture of carbon oxygen bonds, which is conducive to the removal of carbonyl. On the other hand, carbonyl containing compounds are prone to polymerization, aromatization, dehydrogenation and deoxidation at high temperature to generate other substances [34]. It can be found that phenols are the most abundant components in the light bio-oil, mainly including phenol, methoxyphenol, alkylphenol and a small amount of heavy phenol. The relative content of phenols first increases and then decreases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, reaching a maximum of 43.58% at 823 K. The underlying reason is that the appropriate pyrolysis temperature promotes the decomposition of lignin oligomers while the excessive temperature makes part of the light phenol decompose into smaller molecular compounds."
8,Effects of pyrolysis heating rate on the experimental results,"3.2 Effects of pyrolysis heating rate on the experimental results Pyrolysis heating rate also affects the biomass pyrolysis products significantly [35]. The experimental results in this section were obtained under different pyrolysis heating rates when the other experimental conditions remained unchanged (pyrolysis temperature of 823 K and precursor preparation temperature of 473 K). 3.2.1 Effects of pyrolysis heating rate on distribution of products As indicated in Fig. 5 , the heating rate has a significant effect on the yield of each product. Table 3 shows detailed data of mass distribution of each product at different heating rates. It can be seen that with the acceleration of heating rate, the yield of pyrolytic carbon gradually decreases from 39.03% to 25.09% while the yields of carbon-containing precursor and light bio-oil gradually increase from 4.37% to 14.41% and from 24.46% to 32.56%, respectively. The yield of uncondensed gas slightly decreases. It can be explained that the faster the heating rate, the faster the pyrolysis reaction will occur. At fast heating rates, the residence time of the pyrolysis vapors in the reacting biomass particles is reduced hence there is less time for secondary charring reactions. Therefore, the formation of the secondary char is hindered, while there are more volatiles entering the quartz reactor, which is conducive to the production of the carbon-containing precursor and light bio-oil. As a result, with the increase of heating rate, the yields of pyrolytic carbon and uncondensed gas decrease while the yield of carbon-containing precursor and light bio-oil increase. 3.2.2 Effects of pyrolysis heating rate on properties of porous carbons The porous carbons prepared from the carbon-containing precursors obtained at different heating rates were named as BG-Y, where Y represents the heating rate of pyrolysis. The pore structure properties of the prepared carbon materials were listed in Table 4 . Fig. 6 displays the effects of the heating rate on the specific surface area and microporosity of the porous carbon materials prepared. With the acceleration of heating rate, the specific surface area and micropore volume of the porous carbons first increase and then decrease, reaching a peak at 10 K/min while the microporosity shows an increasing trend and remains basically unchanged after 10 K/min. It is well known that the pore structure in the carbon materials prepared by the CaO-template method is due to the removal of nano-CaO and the inner-activation of CO2 and H2O [36]. Under a slow heating rate such as 2 K/min, less pyrolysis vapors are produced and the amount of calcium citrate in the carbon-containing precursor is excessive. In the further carbonization process, the amount of nano-CaO produced by the decomposition of calcium citrate is excessive, accompanied by the excessive inner-activation of CO2 and H2O, resulting in the over-developed pore structure of BG-2 dominated by macropores and mesopores. Therefore, when the heating rate increases, the pyrolysis vapors and calcium citrate can be fully mixed, which isconduciveto the formation of pore structure dominated by mesopores and micropores in the subsequent carbonization process. However, when the heating rate is too fast, the produced vapors is excessive while the amount of calcium citrate is not enough, which leads to the deterioration of the pore structure quality. As can be seen, sample BG-10 has the largest specific surface area (1703 m2/g) and micropore volume (0.51 cm3/g). This can be attributed to the most suitable heating rate of 10 K/min for the preparation of the carbon-containing precursor. At the heating rate of 10 K/min, the mass ratio of calcium citrate to macromolecular pyrolysis vapors is moderate and the system is well mixed, which contribute to the formation of excellent pore structure. 3.2.3 Effects of pyrolysis heating rate on properties of light bio-oil Fig. 7 shows the composition distribution of the light bio-oil obtained at different heating rates. It can be found that with the acceleration of the heating rate, the content of esters increases while the contents of phenols and alcohols decrease from 48.94% to 34.79% and from 12.69% to 8.36%, respectively. The content of acids decreases with the acceleration of the heating rate, reaching the minimum value of 9.93% at 10 K/min and then increases. It can be explained that the accelerated heating rate promotes the pyrolysis of biomass and then the generated macromolecular pyrolysis vapors is easier to enter the carbon-containing precursor preparation device to react with the calcium citrate. Therefore, the relative content of small molecules in the light bio-oil increases and the content of phenols is reduced. It should also be noted that some phenols and alcohols react with acids to form esters."
9,Effects of carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on the experimental results,"3.3 Effects of carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on the experimental results With the other conditions unchanged (pyrolysis temperature of 823 K and pyrolysis heating rate of 10 K/min), the experimental results were obtained under different precursor preparation temperatures to explore the effects of the preparation temperature on the preparation of carbon-containing precursors and the subsequent preparation of porous carbon materials. 3.3.1 Effects of carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on distribution of products The mass distribution of the pyrolysis products at different carbon-containing precursor preparation temperatures is demonstrated in Fig. 8 and the detailed data are listed in Table 5 . It can be seen that the carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature has almost no effect on the yield of pyrolytic carbon, because the parameters affecting the yield of pyrolytic carbon are controlled unchangedin the experiment such as the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate. The yield of uncondensed gas increases slightly at high preparation temperature (523–623 K), which is attributed to the reaction of the macromolecular components of pyrolysis vapors with calcium citrate at high temperature to produce some small molecular gases such as CO2. The preparation temperature in the quartz reactor has a significant effect on the yield of the carbon-containing precursor and light bio-oil. With the increase of the preparation temperature, the yield of the carbon-containing precursor decreases from 29.79% to 9.32% while the yield of the light bio-oil increases from 10.17% to 31.07%. This can be attributed to the fact that the high preparation temperature makes some components with high boiling-point enter the condenser to form light bio-oil during the preparation of the carbon-containing precursor. Although the yield of carbon-containing precursor is higher at a lower preparation temperature, the amount of pyrolysis vapors in the carbon-containing precursor may be excessive relative to the template calcium citrate, which may affect the properties of the carbon materials prepared. 3.3.2 Effects of carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on properties of porous carbons The porous carbons prepared from the carbon-containing precursors obtained at different preparation temperatures were named as BG-Z, where Z represents the preparation temperature in the quartz reactor. The pore parameters of the porous carbon materials prepared are listed in Table 6 . The variation of the specific surface area and microporosity of porous carbons with the precursor preparation temperature is shown in Fig. 9 . It can be obviously found that in the low precursor preparation temperature region (323–423 K), the specific surface area, total pore volume, average pore size and microporosity of porous carbons have little change. It can be explained by the fact that at low precursor preparation temperature, the amount of biomass pyrolysis vapors is larger than the template calcium citrate, hence the pore structure produced by template is limited. When the precursor preparation temperature increases to 473 K, the specific surface area of the porous carbon shows a rapid increase. After 473 K, the microporosity of the porous carbon shows a rapid decrease. When the precursor preparation temperature is higher than 473 K, the yield of carbon-containing precursor decreases and the amount of calcium citrate becomes excessive, which leads to the increase of the average pore size. Moreover, the pore channels gradually develop to mesopores and macropores, resulting in the decrease of microporosity. In this experiment, the sample BG-473 has the largest specific surface area of 1703 m2/g and relatively high microporosity of 24.17%. 3.3.3 Effects of carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature on properties of light bio-oil The component distribution of the light bio-oil obtained at different carbon-containing precursor preparation temperatures are shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that with the increase of the carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature, the relative contents of acids and alcohols in the light bio-oil gradually decrease while the relative contents of ketones and phenols gradually increase. Under the precursor preparation temperature of 323 K, the content of acids in the obtained light bio-oil is the highest, which reaches 32.69%. The low carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature results in very little liquid products collected in the condenser, which are compounds with low boiling-point and small molecular weight, such as formic acid and acetic acid. As the carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature increases, some compounds in pyrolysis vapors with higher molecular weight enter the condenser and the yield of light bio-oil increases. When the carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature is 473 K, the content of phenols in the light bio-oil is relatively high and the content of ketones, acids and aldehydes which are not conducive to the quality of the liquid is relatively low. As a consequence, considering both the pore structure of the porous carbons and the quality of the light bio-oil, the carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature of 473 K appears to be the best choice."
10,Physical properties and H2 storage capacity of the prepared porous carbon,"3.4 Physical properties and H2 storage capacity of the prepared porous carbon Through the above experiments, the optimal conditions of pyrolysis temperature (823 K), heating rate (10 K/min) and carbon-containing precursor preparation temperature (473 K) were selected by integrating many factors. The porous carbon material prepared under the optimal conditions was denoted as BG-S, of which the physical properties and H2 storage capacity were characterized and measured. 3.4.1 Physical property analysis of sample BG-S The morphology and microstructure of sample BG-S were analyzed by SEM and TEM as depicted in Fig. 11 (a) and (b). As shown in the SEM image, sample BG-S has the thin nanoflake structure with mesopores and micropores formed by removing CaO with HCl solution and the inner-activation of CO2 and H2O. In addition, the porous carbon material BG-S has a dense structure with slit pores formed by sheet stacking. As illustrated in the TEM image, sample BG-S shows bubble-like micro-textures and the abundant worm-like micropores and mesopores on the surface are highlighted by circles. Therefore, it’s noteworthy that sample BG-S has rich and excellent pore structure. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the surface functional groups of sample BG-S and the result is exhibited in Fig. 12 . As can be seen, there are about three obvious absorption peaks in the spectrogram. The wavenumber of 1400–1610 cm−1 is the characteristic peak range of benzene ring or aromatics, which indicates that the porous carbon material BG-S contains benzene ring. The absorption peaks at 1825 cm−1 and 2745 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. According to the results, the porous carbon material BG-S may have various oxygen-containing functional groups such as alcohol, phenolic hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl. The presence of these oxygen-containing functional groups enhances the adsorption capacity of the carbon material [37]. 3.4.2 H2 adsorption and storage capacity of sample BG-S The hydrogen storage experiment was carried out on the porous carbon material BG-S and the hydrogen adsorption- desorption isotherm was measured at 77 K over the pressure range of 0–0.1 MPa. As can be seen in Fig. 13 , the hydrogen adsorption- desorption isotherm of BG-S conforms to Langmuir isotherm equation and the curve exhibits a completely reversible adsorption. The Langmuir isotherm equation indicates that the saturated adsorption of hydrogen on carbon materials belongs to mono-layer adsorption, that is, hydrogen is adsorbed by micropores on the surface of the carbon materials [38]. With the increase of the relative pressure, the quantity of hydrogen adsorption improves and the carbon material BG-S can storage 170.12 cm3/g (1.53 wt%) when the pressure is up to 0.1 MPa. It is the high surface area, micropore volume and microporosity of the sample BG-S that facilitate its outstanding hydrogen absorption capacity. Compared with other hydrogen adsorbents investigated by other studies as shown in Table 7 , the porous carbon material BG-S has relatively high hydrogen adsorption capacity under the same test conditions [39–44]."
11,Carbonization mechanism of the carbon-containing precursor,"3.5 Carbonization mechanism of the carbon-containing precursor In order to explore the carbonization mechanism of the carbon-containing precursor, the in situ DRIFTS experiment was carried out. As given in Fig. 14 , the normalized infrared spectra of the carbon-containing precursor at different temperatures represent the relative changes of surface functional groups during the carbonization process. Fig. 15 marks nine vibration peaks represented different functional groups and the variation of the vibration peaks with temperature indicates the evolution characteristics of these functional groups during carbonization. The common infrared absorption peaks and corresponding functional groups are listed in Table 8 [45]. It can be seen that the wide adsorption peak around 3600 cm−1 illustrates the OH stretching vibration in free or weak hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups and the negative peak means the content of OH decreases gradually during carbonization. The negative vibration peak at 2890 cm−1 belongs to CH symmetric stretching vibration and represents the CH bond breaking caused by dehydrogenation during carbonization. It can be found that a broad adsorption peak around 2310 cm−1 belongs to CC stretching vibration and CCC asymmetric stretching vibration when the temperature is above 723 K, which proves the formation of carbon materials. There is a negative vibration peak around 1730 cm−1 which indicates the reduction of CO during the temperature range of 473 K-723 K. The vibration peak at 1650 cm−1 presents a negative peak below 723 K and a positive peak above 723 K, which indicates the formation of H2O during carbonization and is also consistent with the reduction of free OH. The sharp adsorption peak at 1420 cm−1 appears after the temperature reaches 773 K, which represents CC stretching vibration of benzene rings and aromatic rings and indicates the polymerization and aromatization take place under high temperature. The small negative peak at 1305 cm−1 disappears after 723 K, which is related to the formation of H2O during carbonization. The negative vibration peak at 1201 cm−1 represents COH in-plane bending vibration at C6 and indicates the reduction of COH. The positive peak at 1060 cm−1 disappears after 723 K, which illustrates the reduction of CO at C3 at high temperature, causing by polymerization to form C6 and other macromolecular components. Therefore, during the carbonization process, the carbon-containing precursor undergoes deoxidation, dehydrogenation, polymerization, aromatization and other reactions, resulting in the generation of H2O and the reduction of some functional groups such as OH and CO. The biomass pyrolysis vapors react with calcium citrate to produce macromolecular carbon matrix and small molecular gas components. After carbonization, there are still some oxygen atoms attached to carbon matrix, forming oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of carbon materials."
12,Mathematical simulation of the weight loss process of carbonization,"3.6 Mathematical simulation of the weight loss process of carbonization In order to further study the carbonization weight loss process of the carbon-containing precursor, the TGA test was performed and the mathematic simulation of the DTG curve was carried out. As shown in Fig. 16 , the TG curve is relatively flat form 323 K to 423 K and the DTG curve has a first weight loss rate peak at about 423 K. The weight loss of the carbon-containing precursor reaches about 63% as the temperature reaches 1073 K. The maximum weight loss rate peak appears around 973 K. Five reaction peaks can be observed from the DTG curve and they overlap with each other. The peaks in the DTG curve can represent the decomposition of calcium citrate step by step. The peak that reflects the formation of carbon materials is coupled with the peaks of calcium citrate decomposition. For the pyrolysis of simple chemicals, each reaction peak of DTG curve corresponds to the pyrolysis of one substance. However, the carbon-containing precursor is a mixture with complex structure and its carbonization is a multi-step controlled process. When carbonization is a single step process, the reaction kinetics equation is as follows: (3-1) d α d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α ) n where α indicates conversion rate, β indicates reaction rate, A indicates pre-exponential factor, T indicates absolute temperature, E indicates activation energy, R indicates gas constant, n indicates order of reaction. The following equations can be obtained by differentiating and arranging Equation (3-1): (3-2) E = n R T m 2 H m / ( 1 - α m ) (3-3) H m = 2 A β exp - E R T b ( 1 - a m ) n (3-4) n = - 0.6931 / ( Δ T H m 1 - α m + ln 1 - α b 1 - α m ) (3-5) A = β H m exp E R T m 1 - α m - n where Tm indicates the peak temperature, Hm indicates the peak value at Tm, αm indicates the conversion rate at Tm, Tb indicates the temperature at the left half peak, αb indicates the conversion rate at Tb, ΔT is the temperature difference between Tm and Tb. According to the characteristics of DTG curve of the carbon-containing precursor, Gaussian peak separation method was used for peak decomposition. The Gaussian function used for fitting is shown as follows: (3-6) y = y 0 + M w π 2 e x p [ - 2 x - x c w 2 ] where y0 is the baseline, M is the peak area, w is the half-height width of the peak, xc is the position of the peak. Fig. 17 shows the Gaussian peak separation diagram of DTG curve of the carbon-containing precursor. The eigenvalues and fitting parameters of each peak are shown in Table 9 and Table 10 . The five-stage continuous virtual component reaction kinetic model of the sample at the heating rate of 10 K/min was established as follows: (3-7) d α 1 d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α 1 ) 0.813 (3-8) d α 2 d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α 2 ) 0.804 (3-9) d α 3 d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α 1 ) 0.837 (3-10) d α 4 d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α 1 ) 0.797 (3-11) d α 5 d β = A β e x p ( - E RT ) ( 1 - α 1 ) 0.752 As given in Table 10, the activation energy of reaction is different in different reaction stages, which indicates distinct reaction mechanisms. The activation energy of reaction is higher in the fourth and fifth stages, which indicates the strong and multi-step reactions with high conversion rate and complex reaction mechanism. The total conversion rate of the carbonization process was obtained by the weighted superposition of the conversion rate of each stage. As shown in Fig. 17, the area below each fitting peak curve corresponds to the weight loss rate of each stage. The ratio of each peak area to the total weight loss rate is the weight coefficient (S) of the contribution of each reaction stage to the total conversion rate. Therefore, the total conversion rate can be expressed as: (3-12) α = 0.364 α 1 + 0.085 α 2 + 0.036 α 3 + 0.163 α 4 + 0.352 α 5 The curve obtained by simulation basically coincides with the experimental DTG curve (fitting correlation coefficient R2 = 0.92282). Thus, the kinetic model above can well describe the carbonization process of the carbon-containing precursor."
13,Conclusions,"The main conclusions of this work are as follows: (1) This work provides a novel and energy-saving method to prepare porous carbon materials using macromolecular components of biomass pyrolysis vapors as carbon source and calcium citrate as CaO-template. This method realized the utilization of biomass pyrolysis vapors before condensation and the co-production of high-quality light bio-oil at the back end. (2) The mixture of macromolecular pyrolysis vapors and calcium citrate undergoes complex reactions during carbonization process, forming oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of prepared carbon materials. A five-stage reaction kinetic model established can well describe the weight loss process of the carbon-containing precursor during carbonization. (3) At the optimum working conditions, the carbon material prepared possesses the largest surface area of 1703 m2/g, the relatively high micropore volume of 0.51 cm3/g and microporosity of 24.17%. The hydrogen adsorption capacity can reach 170.12 cm3/g (1.53 wt%) at 77 K at atmospheric pressure, which is superior to many other absorbents."
