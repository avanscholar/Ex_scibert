0,Introduction,"Due to the environmental concerns, the global demand for hydrogen is expected to increase greatly in the future for the energy and environmental sustainability. Especially, hydrogen as a fuel is an attractive alternative to finite fuel sources, and can be produced from biomass-derived aqueous polyols such as ethanol, ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol [1–4]. Aqueous phase reforming (APR) is a promising technique for the conversion of such polyols into hydrogen and liquid fuels, as it provides a potential alternative to the utilization of fossil fuels in a sustainable and renewable manner [5–15]. Moreover it offers many advantages, from a technical and economical point of view, since it is possible to produce hydrogen in a single stage reactor with negligible amounts of CO, appropriate for fuel cell applications as well as it is not necessary to vaporize water and glycerol in reforming process [5]. In the APR process, the performance of the catalyst is governed by a number of factors, such as the nature of the active metal, the catalyst support, the feed solution, and the reaction conditions employed [6–8]. Among the various noble and base metals, Pt supported catalysts has been shown to be the most effective among monometallic catalysts for APR reforming of polyols in terms of activity, stability and selectivity toward desired products (either hydrogen or hydrocarbon mixture. A promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is the introduction of a second metal (or metal oxide) to yield bimetallic catalysts [8–15]. Of the available Pt bimetallic catalytic systems, it is widely accepted that the carbon-supported PtRe bimetallic catalyst demonstrates good catalytic performance for hydrogen production [8–10]. A PtRe/C catalyst prepared by sequential impregnation (first Pt, then Re) with a Re/Pt ratio of 2 showed the highest activity due to the promotion of the cleavage of CC bonds in the substrate and elevated rates of water gas shift reaction. However, a major issue with this approach is the high cost of both Re and Pt, although the Pt loading is reduced by the addition of Re. Considering the high cost and high Pt loading required, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts produced by the addition of a second metal have received considerable attention as promising catalysts for the APR process. These bimetallic systems are advantageous as they result in lower catalyst cost, in combination with enhanced APR activity [7–10]. G. W. Huber et al. [7] screened more than 130 alumina-supported Pt and Pd bimetallic catalysts for hydrogen production via the APR reaction of EG solutions using a high-throughput reactor. Several new PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe catalysts were identified as displaying greater activity than monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts for this transformation. From the results, Fe was found to be one of the most promising metals for the alumina supported Pt-based bimetallic catalyst system. The use of Fe in these processes is advantageous due to its low cost and high activity for CC bond cleavage, ascribed to the promoting ability of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. In addition to the effects of promoter in Pt, the support employed may also cause an effect on the outcome of selective APR reaction [16–19]. Despite carbon support such as activated carbon is applied in APR compared to other supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3, its activity was generally poor when compared to supports such as modified mesoporous structures prepared by more sophisticated approaches. We previously reported studies into the various types of ordered mesoporous carbon-supported platinum catalysts in the APR reaction [17]. We found that catalytic activity for APR largely depends on the pore structure and framework configuration of the support. A Pt catalyst system bearing a hollow 3-D ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-9) support, showed higher catalytic performance in the APR of EG because of the synergetic effects of a low amount of metal sintering during the reaction process, and more favorable transport of the reactants and products. In the present study, we selected Fe as the promoter for the CMK-9 supported Pt-based bimetallic catalyst for the APR reaction. The effects on the APR reaction of Fe addition to the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst, the type of support used (CMK-9, commercial activated carbon, or alumina), and the type of polyol used (EG, glycerol, or sorbitol) are investigated to gain a deeper understanding of the APR reaction, and thus improve hydrogen production in this process. Furthermore, we characterized the catalysts and supports using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 sorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and CO chemisorption techniques."
1,Experimental,
2,Support and catalysts for the APR process,"2.1 Support and catalysts for the APR process The supports used in this study include commercially available activated carbon (AC, Sigma Aldrich), and alumina (γ-Al2O3, Strem Chemicals Inc.), in addition to CMK-9 prepared in-house. The CMK-9 support was synthesized using KIT-6 as hard template, and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor, according to literature procedures [17–24]. The above supports were used in the preparation of the supported monometallic catalysts (Pt, Fe) and the PtFe bimetallic catalyst, via an incipient wetness impregnation method, using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Acros Organics, 99.9%), and Fe(NO3)2·H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) [17]. The CMK-9 supported bimetallic PtFe catalysts with Pt:Fe ratios ranging from 1:0.5 to 1:3, with a fixed Pt loading of 3 wt% were prepared by impregnating the support with an aqueous solution, using the previously described procedure. Following impregnation, the samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and reduced via heating under a flow of hydrogen at a rate of 50 cc/min. The reduction temperature was increased linearly from room temperature to 350 °C, and then maintained at this temperature for 12 h. The samples were subsequently cooled with a flow of N2 for 6 h. For comparison, AC and alumina supported PtFe (1:3, 3 wt% Pt) catalysts were also prepared using the incipient wetness method and are denoted as PtFe (1:3)/AC and PtFe (1:3)/alumina, respectively."
3,Characterization of support and catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of support and catalysts The prepared catalysts and supports were characterized via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and CO chemisorption techniques [17]. ICP-AES (Optima 4300 DV, Perkin Elmer) was used for quantitative determination of the elements present in the catalysts. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Multiplex instrument using Cu-Kα radiation (l = 0.15406 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (1.6 kW). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken from the thin edges of the particles supported on a porous carbon grid, using a Philips Tecnai G220 device operated at 200 kV. The TPR measurements were carried out using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C, with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (3 cc/min) and N2 (27 cc/min) was used for 0.1 g of catalyst sample. N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Before the adsorption measurements were carried out, all samples were outgassed at 300 °C in a degassing station. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the apparent surface area from the adsorption data obtained at P/P0 between 0.05 and 0.2. The total volume of micro- and mesopores was calculated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.95, assuming that adsorption on the external surface was negligible compared to adsorption in the pores. The pore size distributions (PSDs) were calculated by analyzing the adsorption branch of the N2 sorption isotherm using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were carried out using a Kratos AXIS OVA analyzer equipped with a Mg source (1253.6 eV). The binding energy of samples was calibrated using the binding energy of the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) as a reference. CO chemisorption was carried out using a BELCAT-B analyzer (BEL Japan Inc.). The Pt loadings of the catalysts were verified using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Spectro Ciros Vision). All mass balances were monitored independently by means of micro-GC and total organic carbon (TOC), and were found to be approximately 100% for all samples."
4,APR reaction procedure,"2.3 APR reaction procedure Aqueous phase reforming of 10 wt% of the chosen polyol was performed in a lab-made fixed bed reactor system [11,17]. The reactor was prepared with a 9.5 mm inner diameter, and a 35.6 cm long stainless steel tube (SUS 316, containing a maximum of 0.03% carbon, a minimum of 16% chromium, and sufficient nickel and/or manganese content) and equipped with an up-flow liquid feeding system. The reaction temperature was controlled using a type-K thermocouple (Omega) and PID controller. A liquid feed of 10 wt% polyol in deionized water was fed into the catalytic reactor at a rate of 0.1 mL/min using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump. The catalyst (0.3 g) was loaded into the middle of the stainless steel tube, and quartz wool was used to fill the length of the reactor. Before performing the aqueous phase reforming reaction, the catalyst was subjected to H2 reduction, with a flow of 50 mL/min flow at 260 °C (heating rate of 1.0 °C/min) for 2 h. After the reduction process had reached completion, the temperature of the reactor was cooled to room temperature for removal of the adsorbed H2 gas using N2 as a sweep gas. This typical reforming reaction was performed with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2.0 h−1 at 250 °C and 45 atm. The effluent gas products were measured using a gas chromatograph (6100 GC, Young Lin Instrument Co.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The contents of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 in the effluent gas were detected using TCD with a packed Carboxen® column (3.175 mm id × 4.57 m). Hydrocarbons were detected using the FID with a GS-GASPRO capillary column (3.175 mm id × 15 m). The liquid phase was analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Bio rad Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm) and GC-MS analyzer with DB-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). As reported previous literature [25], the detected major side products are ethanol and methanol in the liquid phase. In addition, some amounts of unknown products are also detected such as acetaldehyde, and acetic acid, but it is low possibility to produce these chemicals from APR reaction of EG such as silanes, amines, C4 alcohols, and cyclo-products. The acquired data were calculated according to following definitions as described previously in the literature [8,11]: H 2 yield ( % ) = H 2 produced experimentally H 2 calculates according to theoretical quantity × 100 H 2 selectivity ( % ) = H 2 produced experimentally C atoms produced in gas products × 2 5 × 100 2/5 is the reciprocal of the H2/CO2 reforming ratio in the case of EG. Alkane selectivity ( % ) = C atoms in alkane produced Total C atoms produced in gas products × 100 Carbon conversion ( % ) = C atoms in the gas − phase product Total C atoms in the feedstock × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Properties of CMK-9 support and CMK-9 supported PtFe catalysts,"3.1 Properties of CMK-9 support and CMK-9 supported PtFe catalysts The structures of the ordered mesoporous carbon material CMK-9 and the CMK-9 supported catalysts (namely Pt/CMK-9 and PtFe/CMK-9) were analyzed using a series of different characterization techniques, including ICP-MS, TEM, XRD, N2 physisorption analysis, and CO chemisorption. ICP-AES analysis revealed that Pt metal was introduced without a significant loss in the Pt loading, as shown in Table 1 . Fig. 1 gives the wide-angle XRD patterns of the CMK-9 support, and of both the mono and bimetallic catalysts, namely Fe/CMK-9, Pt/CMK-9, and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9. It was found that the CMK-9 support with 3 wt% Fe/CMK-9 catalyst retained a diffuse diffraction peak at approximately 2θ = 23°, indicating an amorphous carbon-like structure, due to the use of furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor to the CMK-9 support. In contrast, the Pt/CMK-9 and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalysts displayed little specific diffraction patterns, as all metals were well dispersed in the CMK-9 support. Fig. 2 shows the N2 sorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the CMK-9 support and of the Pt/CMK-9, Fe/CMK-9, and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalysts. As can be seen in this figure, the hollow CMK-9 support exhibited bimodal mesopores, composed of an inner pore carbon framework and an intrapore between the carbon frameworks [11]. It also exhibited the typical Type IV curve, with sharp capillary condensation steps and narrow pore size distributions, which indicate a well-defined porous structure. After the impregnation of Pt, Fe, and PtFe (1:3) into CMK-9, no changes or isotherms were observed, indicating that all metals were well-dispersed within the supports. These results are consistent with the XRD results discussed previously. The detailed structural properties of all catalysts are summarized in Table 1. TEM images of the above support and catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 . The CMK-9 support clearly displays a highly ordered mesoporous structure, with a mesostructure comprising a highly ordered 3-D mesoporous structure [26]. In the TEM images of the Pt/CMK-9 and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalysts, a highly ordered mesoporous structure was observed, containing a mesostructure of parallel porous channels and carbon rods. The average size of the PtFe nanoparticles remained at approximately 4–5 nm. As can be seen in the TEM images, the Pt nanoparticles were successfully loaded at a high dispersion onto the CMK-9 support. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of the CMK-9 support, and the Pt/CMK-9, Fe/CMK-9, and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalysts, which can be used to investigate the effect of the metal/support interaction. The TPR pattern of the CMK-9 support exhibited a single broad peak over the range of 500–700 °C, which was attributed to methane emission resulting from the hydrogenation of the surface functional groups on the carbon support [11]. However, the TPR profiles of the Pt or Fe catalysts supported by CMK-9 (Pt/CMK-9 and Fe/CMK-9) exhibited a distinct reduction peak of the metal itself, with a single broad peak being observed due to the CMK-9 support. With the addition of Fe to Pt on the CMK-9 support (PtFe/CMK-9 catalyst), the Pt peak for Pt/CMK-9 was observed at a shifted position (higher temperature) compared to that observed for the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst. The hydrogen consumption peaks for Pt/CMK-9 and Fe/CMK-9 are distinguished as a uniform reduction peak at 100 °C and broader peaks at 300–420 °C, respectively. With the addition of Fe on CMK-9 support, the reduction peak for Pt/CMK-9 at 100 °C was shifted to the reduction peak for Fe/CMK-9, and then it leads to increase of the hydrogen reduction peak for PtFe/CMK-9 at 200 °C. Thus, it could be seen that the reduction profiles of the bimetallic catalysts did not contain peaks in the same region as the CMK-9 supported monometallic catalysts, owing to complex effect of Pt reduction by the addition of Fe. In addition, the electronic states of Pt and Fe on the catalysts were examined using XPS measurements (Fig. 5 ). In case of the Pt, Pt/CMK-9 and PtFe/CMK-9 catalysts showed the pair binding energy peaks at 71.3 and 74.8 eV which are the characteristic binding energy peaks of Pto (4f 7/2 = 71.2 ± 0.2 eV, 4f 5/2 = 74.5 ± 0.2 eV) with 0.3 eV of Pt o binding energy shift whereas the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks could be detected in Fe/CMK-9 catalyst and PtFe/CMK-9 catalysts. These results indicate that the electrons do not seem to be donated from Pt to Fe or support itself for alloy formation [26,27]. Instead, the most Pt and Fe seem to remain with a little complex in CMK-9 surface due to some interaction between Pt and Fe observed in the shift of Pt peak and the increase of metal dispersion through TPR and CO chemisorption measurements. CO chemisorption analyses were conducted to determine the metal particle size and metal dispersion of the CMK-9 support and of the CMK-9 supported catalysts (Table 1). It was observed that the size of the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst determined by CO chemisorption analysis was not significantly different from that observed by TEM. The Pt particle size of the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst was found to be slightly smaller than that of both Fe/CMK-9 and PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9, with Pt particle size smaller than 2 nm. This is due to the higher metal dispersion and greater CO uptake observed for the PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalyst, which results from the synergetic effect of the 3-D pore structure, and the high surface area from the hollow framework, in addition to the effect of the PtFe bimetal formation."
7,Effect of the catalyst support and PtFe atomic ratio,"3.2 Effect of the catalyst support and PtFe atomic ratio The effects of both the support and of the addition of Fe to the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst were examined, and the results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . The reaction conditions were as follows: 10 wt% EG, 250 °C, 45 atm, WHSV of 2.0 h−1, and 90 h reaction time. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the support and time-on-stream on the rate of hydrogen production in the APR of EG using supported PtFe (1:3) catalysts. Three different types of supports were used in this study, namely CMK-9, activated carbon, and alumina. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that overall, the supported PtFe (1:3) catalysts showed a constant rate of hydrogen production with time-on-stream of 90 h, suggesting that all PtFe (1:3)/support catalysts are stable during the APR reaction. But the activity of supported PtFe catalysts decreased in the following order: CMK-9 > AC > alumina. Fig. 7 shows the effects of the support on the APR catalytic activity measured by monitoring of the conversion of carbon to gas, the yield and production rate of H2, and alkane selectivity, in addition to H2 turnover frequency (TOF). Here, the TOF value of the catalyst was calculated using the CO chemisorption and H2 production rates from an active Pt site (no. molecules reacted/no. active sites×unit time). The effect of the support on APR activity except alkane selectivity decreased in the following order: PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 > PtFe(1:3)/AC > PtFe(1:3)/alumina. From these results, it was clear that the CMK-9 supported catalyst exhibited better hydrogen production and yield in addition to H2 TOF than the commercial AC and alumina supported catalysts (PtFe/AC and PtFe/alumina). This shows a similar tendency to the CMK-9 supported Pt monometallic catalyst [11] using the same support, as increased catalytic activity was observed in the APR reaction over a Pt/CMK-3 catalyst with the addition of Fe. The superior APR activity of the PtFe/CMK-9 catalyst may be attributed to the ordered pores and opened mesopores interconnected within the CMK-9 support structure, as a large surface area results through carbon microporosity and additional mesopores, thus preventing the growth and aggregation of metal nanoparticles [17,24]. In contrast, the commercial AC and alumina supported catalysts display lower catalytic performances due to their irregular porous structures and predominant microporosity, which hampers the fast diffusion of reactants through the pores. From these observations, it was clear that the PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalyst is effective both in terms of good accessibility of the liquid-phase reactant to catalytic active sites, and in terms of an easy route of escape for the gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO, and alkanes) from the catalytic active site of the metal without diffusion resistance [7,8,11]. Table 2 shows the catalytic performance of CMK-9 supported Pt and Fe, and PtFe catalysts with varying Pt:Fe atomic ratio (1:1 to 1:5). The effect of the active component on the catalytic activity such as the conversion of carbon to gas, the yield and production rate of H2, when using a CMK-9 support increased as follows: Fe < Pt < PtFe, showing that CMK-9 supported PtFe catalysts showed improved catalytic activity over the monometallic catalysts due to the addition of a second metal. This indicates that the increase in reducibility by a shift in the reduction temperature, and by metal complex formation of Pt with Fe, is responsible for the enhancement of the catalytic performance as shown in the TPR results in Fig. 4. The catalytic activity of the PtFe/CMK-9 catalysts with varying Pt:Fe molar ratio (1:1 to 1:5) was measured in terms of the conversion of carbon to gas, the H2 production rate, and the yield of H2. It was found to increase with an increase in the Pt:Fe ratio from 1:1 to 1:3, and then decrease slowly towards Pt:Fe (1:5). In particular, it was observed that the alkane content in the gaseous products was decreased when compared with Pt or Fe based catalysts. Usually, the reaction mechanism of the APR reaction involves dehydrogenation on the metal surface to give adsorbed intermediates, followed by the cleavage of either CC or CO bonds. The use of platinum as the active metal resulted in the cleavage of CC bonds, thus leading to the formation of CO and H2, whereby the CO subsequently reacted with water to form CO2 and H2 by the water–gas shift reaction. Further reaction of CO and/or CO2 with H2 led to the formation of alkanes and water by methanation and Fischer–Tropsch reactions [4–8]. Taking these mechanisms into consideration, the enhancement in APR performance could result through the addition of Fe to Pt, thus preventing the methanation and Fisher-Tropsch reactions from taking place. This result indicates that unlike Pt, Fe itself does not participate in the reforming reactions (such as CC bond cleavage), but rather it acts as a promoter to improve the catalytic activity. Moreover, the PtFe/CMK-9 catalyst with a Fe ratio of 1:3 displayed significantly higher activity than the monometallic Pt/CMK-9 catalyst. From this result, it appears that a number of Pt active sites were indeed bimetallic due to the addition of excess Fe, resulting in an increase in catalytic activity. The results discussed above indicate that the addition of Fe was facilitated by its main role as a promoter in the reforming reaction, without the consumption of H2. From the above results, it could be proposed that the PtFe catalyst not only facilitated CC bond cleavage, but also inhibited CO bond cleavage and dehydration in the APR reaction."
8,"Effects of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), temperature, and polyol type on the APR activity","3.3 Effects of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), temperature, and polyol type on the APR activity Fig. 8 shows the effect of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and reaction temperature on the catalytic performance for the APR of EG over the PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalyst. For these studies, a WHSV of 1.0–6.0 h−1 and a reaction temperature of 230–260 °C were used, at a high enough pressure to maintain a liquid phase such as the system pressure to 5 atm higher than the bubble point pressure of steam. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the contact time of the reactants over the catalyst had a significant impact on the reforming process. In the given WHSV operating ranges, carbon to gas conversion and hydrogen yield showed a decrease with an increase in WHSV or, in other words, with a decrease of contact time, while the hydrogen production rate increased. Significantly higher activity was observed in the case of Pt/AC or Pt/CMKs at the same value of WHSV [17]. Thus, at 2 h−1 the hydrogen production rate was ca. 65% in case of 7 wt% Pt/CMK-9 whereas in the case of 3 wt% PtFe (1:3) catalyst, the almost similar hydrogen production rate was achieved at this WHSV. This demonstrates that a higher hydrogen production rate at a shorter residence time is mainly due to a higher rate of carbon dioxide formation. Fig. 8(b) shows the effect of temperature on the APR reaction including equilibrium yield and equilibrium hydrogen production over PtFe/CMK-9 catalyst. Pressure and temperature were strongly related in these measurements as variation in either affected the solubility of CO2 and H2. To minimize both water evaporation and changes in the solubility of CO2 and H2, the system pressure was controlled at approximately 3 atm higher than the bubble point pressure of steam [11]. For the purpose of these measurements, it was assumed that the system pressure consisted of the vapor pressure of water at the specified temperature, plus the partial pressures of the products (hydrogen and carbon dioxide). From the results obtained, it was clear that catalyst activity depended strongly upon the reaction temperature. An increase in temperature resulted in an increase in APR activity, measured by the conversion of carbon to gas, the yield of H2, and the H2 selectivity. In addition, an increase in temperature also resulted in a decrease in alkane selectivity, and so CC bond cleavage and the WGS reaction can be promoted by higher temperatures and pressures. For the thermodynamic calculation using HSC Chemistry 5.1 software, EG, H2O, H2, CO, and CO2 were involved in the main reforming reaction without methanation and solid carbon formation. Therefore, the possible reactions that are taking place in this case, are the APR reaction of EG and the water-gas shift. For the range of reaction temperature conditions the molar fraction of CO is practically zero, while the molar fractions of H2 and CO2 approached the stoichiometric maximum values as previous results [28,29]. As it can be seen in Fig. 8(b), it is noticed that the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate remain practically constant in equilibrium such as 93.1% and 72.2 ml/gcat.min without reaction temperature, respectively. The effect of the polyol structure on catalytic performance in the APR using the PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalyst was also investigated using a range of polyols, such as EG, glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol. The results from these studies are shown in Fig. 9 , where it can be seen that the effect of the polyol type on the catalytic activity decreased in the order of: EG > glycerol > xylitol > sorbitol. The APR using an EG feed resulted in higher hydrogen production, and a higher conversion of carbon to gas compared to other polyols, with lower alkane selectivity being demonstrated. In particular, the TOF using an EG feed was more than double that of xylitol and sorbitol, demonstrating that as the number of carbon atoms in the polyol increased, hydrogen selectivity generally decreased. This trend ascribes to the large number of complicated side reactions and the formation of various intermediates with polyols containing longer carbon chains. Control of the hydrogen production rate in the APR can therefore be a significant challenge, and thus more detailed fundamental kinetic studies are essential for the understanding of the APR of polyols."
9,Conclusions,"The effect of the support used (CMK-9, activated carbon, and alumina) and Fe addition to the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst system on the aqueous phase reforming (APR) reactions of aqueous polyols was studied. Using an EG feed, the addition of Fe to the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst gave good yields and production rates of hydrogen compared to monometallic catalysts. These results indicate that unlike Pt, Fe itself does not participate in CC bond cleavage in the reforming reaction, but rather it acts as a promoter to improve catalytic activity. It was also observed that the CMK-9 support resulted in the best PtFe activity compared to activated carbon and alumina. In addition, the 3 wt% PtFe/CMK-9 catalyst with a Fe ratio of 1:3 displayed a significantly higher activity than the monometallic 3 wt% Pt/CMK-9 catalyst. In relation to the effect of the polyol type on the catalytic activity of the PtFe (1:3)/CMK-9 catalyst, the APR reaction performance was found to decrease as follows in the order of EG > glycerol > xylitol > sorbitol. It can therefore be concluded that a cheaper and more efficient APR catalyst system (namely PtFe/CMK-9) was developed by variation of the catalyst support, the addition of Fe as a secondary metal, and the structural properties of the polyol substrate."
