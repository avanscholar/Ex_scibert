0,Introduction,"Formaldehyde (HCHO) is the main by-product of many chemical and bio gasification processes, and has become a typical environmental poison [1–6]. Therefore, it is urgent for environmental protection and human health to remove it effectively. Generally, the HCHO removal methods include physical adsorption [7–9], botanical filtration [10], microbe-based degradation [11,12], thermal catalytic oxidation [13–16] and photocatalytic oxidation [17–21]. Among the various technologies, photocatalytic technology stands out owing to its unprecedented advantages, such as mild operation conditions, easy separation of H2, etc [22–24]. In recent years, photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution from HCHO has been considered as an attractive research [22,23,25–29], which not only can achieve the removal of HCHO, but also realize the production of H2. Such strategy of killing two birds with one stone to realize environmental purification and energy output has attracted many researchers to explore. For example, Liu et al. [23] reported an alloy photocatalyst (with core–shell structure, in which Ag as a core and Ag-Pd alloy as a shell), which showed excellent performance for photocatalytic H2 production from HCHO under visible light irradiation, and they found that the adsorption energy, ligand effect and charge redistribution of HCHO and water molecules determine the H2 evolution activity of the alloy photocatalyst. Besides, Zhang et al. [25] firstly reported AuPd alloy nanoparticles for H2 evolution from HCHO aqueous solution under visible light illumination, and they attributed the high H2 evolution activity to the ultrafine AuPd alloy nanostructures and the efficient electron transfer from Au with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect to active Pd sites. In addition, Belhadj et al. [28] investigated the photocatalytic performance of Pt/TiO2 for simultaneous H2 production and HCHO oxidation, and deeply studied the photocatalytic mechanisms of this reaction. They found that one of the H atoms in H2 comes from water molecule and the other from HCHO molecule. Although the past few decades have witnessed a development of photocatalytic H2 evolution from HCHO. Single component photocatalysts often encounter serious recombination of photogenerated carriers, which leads to their low photocatalytic efficiency for H2 evolution and HCHO removal. In view of this, photocatalytic composite systems, which can promote the effective separation of photogenerated carriers, are emerging technique in recent years. In particular, the Z-scheme photocatalytic composite system has attracted much interests, owing to its unprecedented superiority: enhancing redox ability of photocatalytic system and promoting rapid separation of photogenerated carriers [30]. Besides, in the family of semiconductor photocatalysts, zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) has attracted extensive interdisciplinary attention, owing to its suitable band gap, high chemical stability, and excellent photocatalytic performance [31]. Considering the attractive advantages, ZnIn2S4-based Z-scheme photocatalytic system has been constructed by many researchers recently. For instance, in Zhu’s work [32], ZnIn2S4/RGO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalytic system was constructed for the H2 evolution from various of organic pollutants, including formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), formic acid (HCOOH), acetaldehyde (C2H4O), ethanol (CH3CH2O), acetic acid (CH3COOH), ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2), propionaldehyde (C3H6O), triethylamine (C6H15N) and butyraldehyde (C4H8O). It is found that the organic compound can effectively promote the H2 evolution, and follow the order of HCHO > CH3OH > HCOOH > C2H4O > CH3CH2O > CH3COOH > (CH2OH)2 > C3H6O > C6H15N > C4H8O. However, the pathway and mechanism of H2 production and simultaneous pollutant degradation have not been clarified. In this work, we constructed the Z scheme ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 photocatalytic system and simultaneously investigated its photocatalytic H2 production activity and HCHO degradation activity. The morphology and microstructure, crystal structure, element composition, valence distribution, optical properties, and band structure of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by various characterization techniques. Furthermore, the effects of O2 concentration, pH value and initial HCHO concentration on the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples were investigated. On this basis, the possible pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production and simultaneous HCHO degradation were proposed."

Secondly, cyclohexane, 1-hexanol (cosurfactant), and polyoxyethylene mono tert octylphenyl ether (surfactant) were mixed in the molar ratio of 3:2:1 to prepare oil phase solution. Thirdly, A and B was added into two oil phase solutions respectively, stirring 15 min to form homogeneous microemulsion, marked C and D, then adding C drops into D, stirring 30 min to form stable microemulsion.

Then took a proper amount of NiO/BiVO4 (32.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) and added it into the above solution, and conducted ultrasonic dispersion for 0.5 h. Then the mixture was loaded into an autoclave and heated for 2 h at 140 °C. Finally, the product was washed with water and anhydrous ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C to obtain ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 photocatalyst."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The structures and morphologies of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM Hitachi SU1080) and transmission electron microscope (TEM Tecnai G2 F30). The crystal structures of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD Rigaku D/max 2550 VB/PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). The element composition of the samples and the valence distribution were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 VersaProbe II, with an Al Kα radiation source operated at 250 W). Measurement of absorption properties of samples by Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV–Vis Shimadzu Ultraviolet-2450 spectrometer measured in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm). The ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) spectra were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Using the He I (21.22 eV) as radiation lines). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of photocatalysts were studied with a photoluminescence detector (SHIMADZU RF5301PC luminescence spectrometer). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of photocatalysts were recorded on a photoluminescence detector (SHIMADZU RF5301PC, using a 360 nm LED laser as the light source). Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the radicals captured by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were carried out on a Bruker A300 spectrometer (Germany). Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI852C electrochemical station with a Xenon lamp (Newport 69920, 300 W), the detailed describe of the photocurrent experiments were attached in Supporting Information."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test Photocatalytic tests were conducted in a 500 mL gastight stainless steel reactor. The light source was Xe lamp above mentioned and the UV light was filtrated by a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). In the tested experiments, prepared 200 mL HCHO solution with a certain concentration in the reactor, added 300 mg catalyst and 1 wt% H2PtCl6·6H2O. After ultrasonic treatment for 5 min, sealed the reactor in the gas (nitrogen) path, and opened the gas path switch to exhaust the reactor for 0.5 h. After the above steps were completed, turned on the blower, magnetic stirrer and 350 W xenon lamp to carry out photocatalytic reaction on the reaction system. 500 μL of gas was sampled in the reaction device with chromatographic sampling probe every 0.5 h, and the concentration of H2 was detected by GC-112A gas chromatograph. TCD was selected as the detector of chromatography. At the same time, 2 mL of water sample was taken with disposable syringe, and the catalyst was filtered out with needle filter to obtain HCHO solution. The concentration of HCHO solution was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, LC2000). The SunfireTM-C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm i. d., 5 μm) reversed phase column was used. The mixture of methanol and water (70:30, v/v) was the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min−1 and detection wavelength of 365 nm."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared samples were observed by FESEM (Fig. 1 A-D), TEM (Fig. 1 E), and HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1 F). As shown in Fig. 1 A and B, BiVO4 crystals show a spherical shape with an average diameter of 200 nm. The FESEM images of NiO/BiVO4 are shown in Fig. S1 , it can be clearly seen that there are many tiny NiO particles on the surface of BiVO4 crystals. As shown in Fig. S2, ZnIn2S4 exhibits a flower-like microsphere shape with an average diameter of 1.0 μm and the sphere is composed of a large number of nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 1 C and D, ZnIn2S4 nanosheets self-assembled on the surface of NiO/BiVO4 and covered it, forming ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 flower-like microspheres. TEM (Fig. 1 E), HAADF-STEM and the corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. 1 F) were also observed. As shown in the elemental mapping (Fig. 1 F), the distribution of Zn, In, S and Ni elements is relatively scattered compared with Bi and V, further confirming that ZnIn2S4 and NiO are distributed on the surface of BiVO4. The crystal structures of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were determined by XRD and shown in Fig. 2 . For the samples of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4, all of them show the characteristic diffraction peaks of monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 (JCPDS No. 14-0688) [34–45]. Both ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No. 65-2023) [46–53]. In addition, no characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO were observed in the XRD patterns of NiO/BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4, which may be due to its low loading content. The surface elemental composition and chemical state of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were identified by XPS and shown in Fig. 3 . The survey spectrum (Fig. 3 A) of the samples confirms the presence of Bi, V, O, Ni, Zn, In, and S elements in the prepared ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 heterojunction. Each of the XPS spectra of Bi element in BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 (Fig. 3 B) has two major peaks at binding energies of around 159.1 eV and 164.6 eV, which can be ascribed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, demonstrating that the valence state of Bi in these samples is +3 [36]. It is noteworthy that, compared with BiVO4, the peak shifts of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 in the XPS spectra of NiO/BiVO4, and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 appeared, indicating that the formation of new forces between NiO and BiVO4, as well as NiO/BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4. Moreover, in Fig. 3B, the characteristic peaks of S 2p in ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 sample also appeared, which located at the binding energy of 163.2 and 161.5 eV and corresponding belongs to S 2p1/2, and S 2p3/2, respectively. Besides, in Fig. 3 C, the binding peaks at 1022.2 and 1045.0 eV of ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 can be attributed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, illustrating that the valence state of Zn in these samples is +2 [54]. In addition, in Fig. 3 D, the two binding peaks at 452.4 and 444.7 eV of ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 can be attributed to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively, indicating the valence state of In in these samples is +3 [55]. The light absorption properties of BiVO4, NiO, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were analyzed by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) (Fig. 4 A). Note that, NiO displays a full-spectrum absorption, which is also reflected by its dark color. This result is well consistent with the literature report [56–58]. Therefore, after depositing NiO on the surface of BiVO4, the formed NiO/BiVO4 sample exhibits the enhanced light absorption than BiVO4. Excluding NiO, among the remaining samples, ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 shows the strongest visible light absorption intensity, along with a biggest red-shifted of the absorption edge, which indicate that the visible light response capability can be effectively improved after constructing the ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 heterojunction. Besides, the corresponding band gap energies of BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 were calculated to be 2.48 eV and 2.28 eV, respectively, according to the Tauc plots (ahν) 2 = A(hν − Eg) (Fig. 4 B). In addition, from the UPS spectra of BiVO4 (Fig. 4 C) and ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 4 D), it can be seen that the typical secondary-electron cut-off energy (Esc ) of BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 are 15.62 and 16.95 eV, respectively; the valence band maximum (VBM) with respect to the Fermi level (Evb − EF ) of BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 are 1.71 and 1.82 eV, respectively. Besides, the photon energy was 21.2 eV and the reference standard of −4.44 eV (vs. vacuum) is equal of 0 eV (vs. RHE). According to the equation of Evb (vs. vacuum) = 21.2 − [Esc − (Evb − EF )], Evb (RHE) = Evb (vs. vacuum) −4.44 eV, and Ecb = Eg − Evb , it can be calculated that for BiVO4: Evb and Ecb are 2.85 and 0.37 eV respectively; while, for ZnIn2S4: Evb and Ecb are 1.63 and −0.65 eV respectively. Steady‐state PL spectroscopy is often used to investigate the efficiency of photocarrier capture, migration and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts [59,60]. Additionally, time‐resolved transient PL decay spectroscopy is considered as an effective technology to explore the carrier dynamics, which could measure the lifetime of excitons [61]. Fig. 5 A and Fig. 5 B shows the steady‐state PL spectra and TRPL spectra of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4, respectively. In Fig. 5 A, the strong emission peaks of BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 sample are respectively located at around 565 nm (with the excitation wavelength of 420 nm) and 510 nm (with the excitation wavelength of 380 nm), demonstrating that the strong recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in pure BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 sample. Among all the samples, ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 displays significantly the lowest PL intensity, which means that the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers has been restrained after the formation of Z-scheme system. In addition, the decay kinetics of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 sample also shows a longest average lifetime (2.06 ns) than that of BiVO4 (1.71 ns) NiO/BiVO4 (1.88 ns), ZnIn2S4 (2.01 ns), demonstrating that the as-prepared ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 can effectively expedite the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pair and prolong the lifetime of excitons. The transient photocurrent-time curves (Fig. 5 C) and EIS measurements (Fig. 5 D) of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were performed to offer more evidence of the separation, migration, and transformation of photo-generated carriers. As expected, ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 sample exhibited the highest photocurrent density and smallest charge transfer resistance, further indicating its highest separation efficiency of charge carriers."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity 3.2.1 Photocatalytic activity of different catalysts The photocatalytic activities of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were evaluated in terms of the H2 evolution and HCHO degradation under visible light irradiation and shown in Fig. 6 . The reaction conditions were as follows: the catalyst dosage was 1.5 g·L−1, the reaction solution was 200 mL, the initial concentration of HCHO was 1.0 mol·L−1, the pH value of the reaction system was 13, and the reactor was aerated for 30 min before photoreaction using 50% O2. As shown in Fig. 6A, the H2 evolution activity of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 is significantly higher than that of ZnIn2S4, BiVO4 (no H2 generation) and NiO/BiVO4 (no H2 generation). This can be attributed to the formation of Z-scheme system, which further enhanced the light absorption performance and promoted the effective separation of electron hole pairs of the catalyst. In order to show the H2 production data of each catalyst more clearly, the data of less than 1000 µmol·g−1 in Fig. 6 A was enlarged and displayed in the inset figure. It can be seen from the inset figure of Fig. 6 A, in HCHO free solution, ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 also possess weak H2 production activity (almost 200 μmol·g−1, after 3 h reaction). As shown in Fig. 6 B, the HCHO degradation of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 is also significantly higher than that of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4, which can also be attributed to the formation of Z-scheme system between ZnIn2S4 and NiO/BiVO4. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction conditions on photocatalytic activity (1) Effects of O2 concentration Effects of O2 concentration on the photocatalytic H2 generation and HCHO degradation over ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst were studied and the results are shown in Fig. 7 A and B. The reaction conditions were as follows: the catalyst dosage was 1.5 g·L−1, the reaction solution was 200 mL, the initial concentration of HCHO was 1.0 mol/L, the pH value of the reaction system was 11, and the reactor was aerated for 30 min before photoreaction using argon (Ar), 10% O2, 20% O2, 50% O2, 65% O2, 80% O2 and pure oxygen (100% O2), respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 7 A that almost no H2 were produced in the Ar atmosphere, and H2 production reaction can be promoted obviously by introducing O2 into the reaction system. In addition, with the increase of O2 content, the H2 production activity of the catalyst first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum (almost 5100 μmol/g H2 was produced after 3 h reaction) at 80% O2 concentration. As for the HCHO degradation, its change trend (shown in Fig. 7 B) is consistent with that of H2 production, and reached the highest degradation ratio of 24.9% at 80% O2 concentration. These results indicate that HCHO can hardly be degraded and H2 can hardly be produced in the absence of O2 over ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. In addition, O2 can promote HCHO degradation and H2 production. In the experiment process of oxygen absence, the phenomenon that the catalyst cannot form suspension was observed. The reason for this phenomenon may be that, under the condition of no oxygen, HCHO is easy to polymerize to synthesize polyformaldehyde (POM) and wrap on the surface of the catalyst, which makes the catalyst agglomerate with each other and settle down from the reaction liquid, and finally makes the catalytic reaction impossible. While, in the presence of O2, O2 can boost the oxidation conversion of HCHO to formic acid (HCOOH) and restrain HCHO polymerization reaction [62], therefore accelerates the formation of H2 in the reaction system. In addition, we also carried out the contrast experiment (Ar and 80% O2) under the condition of no catalyst, only illumination and pH value of 13 (shown in Fig. 7 C). It can be found that without catalyst, HCHO can be oxidized to produce a certain amount of H2 in the presence of O2 under visible light irradiation, while in the absence of O2, there were no H2 been produced. This demonstrates that HCHO has the activity of self-degradation to H2, under the condition of oxygen, light and strong alkalinity. The pathway of H2 production from HCHO self-degradation was proposed as route ⑨ and ⑩ (shown in Section 3.4, Scheme 1 ). This further indicates that oxygen is the necessary condition for H2 production from HCHO. It should also be noted that, when the oxygen content is more than 80%, the activity of catalyst decreases (as shown in Fig. 7 A and B), which may be because that too much O2 occupy the active sites on the surface of the catalyst, resulting in the decrease of H2 production activity eventually. (2) Effects of pH Effects of pH on the photocatalytic H2 generation and HCHO degradation over ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst were investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 7 D and E. The reaction conditions were as follows: the catalyst dosage was 1.5 g·L−1, the reaction solution was 200 mL, the initial concentration of HCHO was 1.0 mol/L, the reactor was aerated for 30 min before photoreaction using 80% O2, the pH value was 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and14, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 D, almost no H2 were produced and no HCHO were degraded when the pH was 4. In addition, with the increase of pH value, the H2 production activity of the catalyst first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum (almost 24089 μmol·g−1 H2 was produced after 3 h reaction) at pH = 13. As for the HCHO degradation, its change trend (shown in Fig. 7 E) is consistent with that of H2 production, and reached the highest degradation ratio of 26.5% at pH = 13. These results indicate that HCHO can hardly be degraded and H2 can hardly be produced in acid or neutral solution over ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. However, too high pH (pH = 14) value will eventually lead to the decrease of photocatalytic activity. This phenomenon may be due to the presence of Cannizzaro reaction, which was the competing reaction with the H2 production reaction. It is well known that HCHO in alkaline aqueous solutions could be transformed to methanol and formic acid. Thereby, part HCHO has not be catalyzed promptly, that directly reacted with NaOH to take part in Cannizzaro reaction, so the yield of the H2 was falling down when the pH value was too high [62,63]. The H2 production and the HCHO degradation activity of the photocatalyst system changes with the change of pH value, which may be related to the surface electronegativity of catalyst and the reducibility of HCHO. With the increase of pH value from 4 to 13, the reducibility of HCHO and the electronegativity of catalyst increase, which makes the activity of catalyst system increase. To verify the above conjecture, the zeta potential of the catalyst under different pH value were tested and the results are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen from Table 1 that with the increase of pH value of reaction solution, the absolute value of zeta potential also increased. Generally speaking, the higher the absolute value of zeta potential in aqueous solution, the more stable the dispersion system is, and the boundary of dispersion stability is generally considered as 30 mV. When the absolute value of zeta potential is greater than 30 mV, the dispersion system is relatively stable. As shown in Table 1, under the alkaline condition, the absolute zeta potential of the reaction system is greater than 30 mV, and the catalyst dispersion system is stable, so that the H2 production efficiency of the reaction system is high. It is worth noting that when the pH value is increased from 11 to 13, although the absolute value of zeta potential is not increased much, the activity is increased obviously, which may be related to the enhancement of the reduction ability of HCHO in alkaline solution. In addition, the H2 production activity of the system without catalyst only light under different pH value were also measured. As shown in Fig. 7 F, when the pH value of HCHO solution is 11, the HCHO solution can not generate H2 without adding any catalyst, but under the condition of pH = 13, HCHO can be reduced to generate H2 without adding any catalyst. It is speculated that the reason may be that, under strong alkaline condition (pH = 13), HCHO has strong reducibility, and the reaction of H2 production from HCHO self-degradation (shown in Section 3.4, Scheme 1, route ⑨ and ⑩) can take place. (3) Effects of HCHO initial concentration Effects of HCHO initial concentration on the photocatalytic H2 generation and HCHO degradation over ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst were also studied and the results are shown in Fig. 7 G-I. The reaction conditions were as follows: the catalyst dosage was 1.5 g·L−1, the reaction solution was 200 mL, the pH value of the reaction system was 13, the reactor was aerated for 30 min before photoreaction using 80% O2, the initial concentration of HCHO was 0.25 mol·L−1, 0.5 mol·L−1, 1.0 mol·L−1, 1.5 mol·L−1 and 2.0 mol·L−1, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 7 G that with the increase of HCHO initial concentration, the H2 production activity of the catalyst first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum (almost 27248 μmol/g H2 was produced after 3 h reaction) at 1.5 mol·L−1 HCHO concentration. Similarly, over concentrated HCHO will also result in the side Cannizzaro reaction and low H2 evolution rate [23]. As shown in Fig. 7 H and I, with the increase of the initial HCHO concentration, HCHO degradation ratio decreased, while the trend of HCHO degradation amount is the same as the trend of H2 production. At the same time, it can be seen from Fig. 7 H that with the increase of the initial HCHO concentration, the changing trend of total organic carbon (TOC) degradation ratio was consistent with the changing trend of HCHO degradation ratio, which were 11.7%, 5.6%, 4.5%, 3.2% and 1.7% respectively. Obviously, HCHO was not fully mineralized in the reaction process. The reason why HCHO can't be mineralized completely may be that a certain step of HCHO oxidation process consumed a lot of energy, which hindered the oxidation process. Li et al. [64] studied the energy barrier required for various reactions in the photocatalytic oxidation of HCHO, and found that the intermediate product was generated through HCHO → HCOOH step, while HCOOH → CO2 step requires 2.22 eV energy barrier, so it hindered the complete mineralization of HCHO, and generated many intermediate products, which made the HCHO unable to be fully mineralized. 3.2.3 Comparison of photocatalytic activity Table 2 shows the comparison of H2 production by Z scheme system with ZnIn2S4 as PSII. It can be seen that the activity of H2 production in this work is about 4.4 times higher than that in our previous work [65]. This is because the size of BiVO4 (about 300 nm) synthesized in this work is much smaller than our previous work (about 2000 nm), which leads to the better size matching and better interface connection between BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4. Compared with the related Z scheme system with ZnIn2S4 as PSII (listed in Table 2), in addition to the NiS/ZnIn2S4-WO3 catalyst system (the dosage of it is very small), the H2 production activity in this work is also kept at a high level, which also benefits from the well size matching and the good interface connection between BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4. Table 3 shows the comparison of photocatalytic H2 production from HCHO over different kinds of catalysts. It can be seen that, except for noble metal alloy catalysts (the dosage of them is very small) [22,23,25], the activity of H2 production in this work shows a superior performance among many photocatalyst, which can be attributed to the high H2 production activity of ZnIn2S4."
9,Photocatalytic stability,"3.3 Photocatalytic stability As photostability is a very important characteristic for the practical application of the photocatalyst, cyclic photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were performed here to measure the photostability of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 Z scheme photocatalyst. The reaction conditions were as follows: the catalyst dosage was 1.5 g·L−1, the reaction solution was 200 mL, the pH value of the reaction system was 13, the reactor was aerated for 30 min before photoreaction using 80% O2, the initial concentration of formaldehyde was 1.5 mol·L−1. As shown in Fig. 8 A, after 5 cycles, the H2 production activity of the catalyst only slightly decreased, indicating that the ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 possesses good stability. The crystal structure of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 shows no distinct degradation (Fig. 8 B), which further confirm robust stability of the as-prepared ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 photocatalyst. In addition, the surface elemental composition and chemical state (Fig. 8 C), especially the S element (Fig. 8 D, E) of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 also display no distinct changes after used, further indicated that the structure and composition of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 were not changed."
10,Pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic reaction,"3.4 Pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic reaction It can be seen from Fig. 6 that, in terms of BiVO4 and NiO/BiVO4 catalysts, only HCHO degradation can be observed, H2 production cannot be observed; As for ZnIn2S4 catalyst, it is difficult to observe HCHO degradation, but H2 production can be observed. These results are mainly related to the energy band position of BiVO4, NiO/BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4. From Fig. 6, it can also be seen that the ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 catalyst both possesses enhanced H2 production activity and HCHO degradation activity. These results indicate that a good interface connection (p-n heterojunction or Z-scheme heterojunction) was formed between ZnIn2S4 and NiO/BiVO4. However, if p-n heterojunction was formed, the system cannot produce H2 effectively according to the band position. Therefore, the above analysis shows that Z-scheme heterojunction was formed between ZnIn2S4 and NiO/BiVO4. In order to clarify the pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production and simultaneous HCHO degradation of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 photocatalyst, the participation of reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (OH), superoxide radicals (O2 –) and holes (h+) in the photocatalytic reaction must be considered. To verify the main reactive species of HCHO degradation, a series of control experiments in the presence of different quenchers were carried out (shown in Fig. 9 A). Herein, EDTA-2Na, TBA and BQ were used to quench h+, OH and O2 –, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 9A that the HCHO degradation activity of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 decreases significantly in the presence of EDTA-2Na, TBA or BQ, illustrating that all the h+, OH and O2 – are the key reactive species responsible for the HCHO degradation. Besides, the presence of OH and O2 – on ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 catalyst were also directly confirmed by the ESR analysis (Fig. 9 B, C). As shown in Fig. 9 B and Fig. 9 C, BiVO4 and NiO/BiVO4 have no DMPO‐O2 – adduct signal, ZnIn2S4 has no DMPO‐OH adduct signal. As expected, both the DMPO‐O2 – and DMPO‐OH adduct signal appeared in the ESR spectra of ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 along with the enhancement of the signal, further indicating the construction of the proposed Z‐scheme system between NiO/BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4. Based on the above analyses and the analyses of Section 3.2.2, the possible pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production and simultaneous HCHO degradation were proposed (shown in Scheme 1). Both BiVO4 and ZnIn2S4 can be excited by the visible light to generate (e−) in conduction bands (CB) and h+ in valence bands (VB). The e− on the CB of BiVO4 are combined with the h+ on the VB of ZnIn2S4, so that a large number of h+ are accumulated on the VB of BiVO4 and enriched on the NiO surface, and a large number of e− are accumulated on the CB of ZnIn2S4 and enriched on the Pt surface. e− on the Pt surface participate in two reactions: 2H+ → H2 (route ①) and O2 → O2 – (route ②). h+ on the NiO surface participate in three reactions: H2O or HO–→·OH (route ③), HCHO → HCOOH + H+ (route ④) and HCOO– → CO2 + H+ (route ⑤). Among them, route ① is the H2 generation pathway, route ② and ③ are the active oxygen species speciation pathway, route ④ is the HCHO degradation pathway (the formation of HCOOH has been proven by GC–MS, shown in Fig. S6 ), route ⑤ is the HCHO mineralization pathway. In addition, the active species involved in HCHO degradation and mineralization also include O2 – and OH (route ⑥, ⑦, ⑧). According to the analyses of Section 3.2.2, under the condition of pH = 13 and 80% O2, HCHO can produce H2 without adding catalyst. This demonstrates that HCHO has the activity of self-degradation to H2, under the condition of O2, light and strong alkalinity. The pathway of H2 production from HCHO self-degradation was proposed as route ⑨ and ⑩."
11,Conclusions,"Z-scheme ZnIn2S4-NiO/BiVO4 photocatalytic system was constructed successfully. By exploring the effects of oxygen (O2) and pH on the photocatalytic activity of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system, it was found that O2 and alkalinity are necessary for photocatalytic HCHO degradation and H2 production in this Z-scheme photocatalytic system. O2 can boost the oxidation conversion of HCHO into formic acid (HCOOH) and restrain HCHO polymerization reaction, therefore accelerate the formation of H2 in the reaction system. With the increase of pH value from 4 to 13, the reducibility of formaldehyde and the electronegativity of catalyst increase, which makes the activity of catalyst system increase. Under the optimal conditions (80% of O2, 13 of pH and 1.5 mol·L−1 of HCHO initial concentration), the best H2 production activity and HCHO degradation activity are 2724.89 μmol·h−1 and 17.00 mmol·h−1, respectively. According to the radical trapping experiment, all the h+, OH and O2 – are the key reactive species responsible for the HCHO degradation. Based on the above analyses, the possible pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production and simultaneous HCHO degradation were proposed, which shed lights on elucidating the reaction path and the underlying mechanism for photocatalytic H2 production and pollutant degradation."
