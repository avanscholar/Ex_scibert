0,Introduction,"Electronic skin sensors are developed for the detection of a variety of physiological activities in the human body, including larger movements of the hands, arms and legs, as well as smaller movements like breathing, swallowing, muscle vibration during voice production, blood pressure and intraocular pressure [1]. Wearable electronic sensors can transform physiological activity signals into visual electrical signals, which have great potential applications in human clinical diagnosis, health assessment, health monitoring, flexible touch screens, electronic skin, and industrial robots [2,3]. Hydrogel, a three-dimensional crosslinked polymeric composite [4], is based on a variety of reversible molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding [5–7], dynamic covalent bonds [8–10], metal−ligand coordination [11,12], electronic interaction [13,14], host−guest interactions [15], and hydrophobic association [16]. Hydrogels that are self-healable, biocompatible, and possess conductive performance have high resemblance to human tissues by combining electronic properties with the soft nature of hydrogels [17–19]. Therefore, conductive hydrogels have been adapted to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as implantable or wearable biosensors, electronic skins, and tissue engineering for body motion monitoring [20–26]. To design composite hydrogels with electrical conductivity, conducting fillers such as metallic particles (Au, Ag, Ni) [27], nanotubes [28,29], and graphene oxide (GO) [30,31] are usually incorporated into polymeric networks. Conductive hydrogels with different GO contents were fabricated through mixing GO, dopamine and acrylamide with N,N-methylenebisacrylamide as the crosslinking agent [30]. However, the hydrogels showed poor mechanical adhesion strength and the color of the hydrogels turned black. Due to relatively bioinertness and lack of bioactivity, many commonly reported hydrogels, such as poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyglycolic acid, and polyacrylamide, are not able to maintain a relatively stable environment for cell activity [32]. To improve the bioactivity of hydrogels, bioactive molecules such as growth factors [33] and peptides [34] have been introduced into hydrogels. However, the biological activity of these bioactive molecules is not easy to preserve during hydrogel preparation [35]. which limits their practical applications. In this work, we explored a PVP/GA composite hydrogel with good biocompatibility, stretchability and wearable properties. When PVP and GA solutions are mixed, gelation is instantaneously induced through strong hydrogen bonding interactions between PVP and GA molecules. The self-healing, injectable, self-adhesive, conductive, stretchable and biocompatible properties of PVP/GA composite hydrogels were investigated. Due to its simplicity in processing, excellent self-healing ability without external stimulus, high stretchability with elongation, and good biocompatibility with living organisms, PVP/GA composite hydrogels can open up a new path for applications in wearable electronic sensors."
1,Experiments,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 1,300,000) and gallic acid (GA) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). The agents were of analytical grade and used as received. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm) was obtained from a water puriﬁer (Sichuan Water Puriﬁer Co. Ltd., China)."
3,Preparation of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"2.2 Preparation of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel Gallic acid solutions with concentration of 10 wt% were obtained by dissolving a certain weight of gallic acid (0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 g) in boiling deionized water. 1 g of PVP was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water at room temperature. The PVP solution was added into the GA solution under severe stirring. The mixture instantly gelated, forming a coacervate composite hydrogel. The composite hydrogel was soaked in a beaker of deionized water for 24 h to remove the dissolving substance."
4,Characterization of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"2.3 Characterization of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel The FTIR samples were prepared with KBr tablets. All spectra were recorded with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, PerkinElmer, SPECTRUM2000) spectrometer in the wavenumber ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1.13C NMR spectra were recorded with the operation frequency of 75.5 MHz using a Brooke AV400 NMR spectrometer. The sample was placed into a 4 mm ZrO2 rotary tube with a rotation speed of 5 kHz, compensation time of 20 ms, contact time of 1 ms, and delay between two pulses of 3 ms."
5,Mechanical properties,"2.4 Mechanical properties The tensile performance of PVP/GA composite hydrogels was tested using a tensile tester (INSTRON 3365, Norwood, MA, USA). The samples were molded into dumbbell shapes (2 mm in thickness, 2 mm in width, 12 mm in length), while the healed samples were prepared by re-contacting samples that were cut in half by a blade. All samples were tested at a rate of 25 mm/min at room temperature."
6,Rheological analysis,"2.5 Rheological analysis To measure the rheological behaviors of PVP/GA composite hydrogels, the samples were tested with a stress-controlled rheometer Rotational Rheometer MARS III Haake (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany). The diameter of parallel plate geometry is 35 mm. After strain scanning test, the sample deformed under different shear strains. The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were measured by frequency sweeps at a strain of 1% and 500% within a linear viscoelastic region over a range of frequencies (0.1 Hz–100 Hz). Meanwhile, the self-healing properties of hydrogels were tested by changing the oscillation force amplitude of 1 Hz. All tests were carried out at room temperature."
7,The conductivity of PVP/GA composite hydrogel-based skin-like electronics,"2.6 The conductivity of PVP/GA composite hydrogel-based skin-like electronics The conductivity of the composite hydrogels was tested using a four-point probe according to the previous literature [36]. The composite hydrogel was stretched by cyclic tension to explore the strain-dependent conductivity variation. The electrical resistance was recorded when the tensile strain of hydrogel reached 400%. The electrical self-healing property of the hydrogels was detected by both the light-emitting diode (LED) illumination during the cutting and healing process. To evaluate the sensing performances of the hydrogels for various human movements, the hydrogels were mounted onto the finger, wrist, throat, and radial artery of a volunteer. Then individual real-time I−t curves were recorded for finger bending, wrist bending, swallowing, speaking and pulse beating. The conductivity (б) and relative electrical resistance change (ΔR/R 0) are calculated using the following equation [17,30]: σ = 1 / ( R t ) Δ R / R 0 = ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 where R is the resistance of the sample, and t is the thickness of the sample. R 0 and R are the resistance at 0% strain and under stretching, respectively."
8,Adhesion strength,"2.7 Adhesion strength To measure the adhesion performance of PVP/GA composite hydrogels on porcine skin, the hydrogels were coated onto the porcine skins. The mechanical properties were measured by a lap shear test at 2 mm/min using a test rally machine (CMT-6104), and the ultimate shear loads were recorded. The adhesion strength is calculated using the following equation [37]: T = F max / S where τ is the bonding strength (Pa); F max is bonding tension at the break point (N); and S is the area of the overlapped adherend (m2)."
9,Swelling ratio,"2.8 Swelling ratio To evaluate the water uptake of the hydrogels, the swelling behaviors of different kinds of hydrogels were tested. Dried hydrogels (W 0) were initially weighed and immersed in deionized water at room temperature until reaching the equilibrium state for water-uptake measurements. The weight of swollen samples (W t) was measured after the surface moisture was wiped off with filter paper. The swelling ratio of hydrogels was calculated using the following formula [31]: Swelling ratio ( % ) = [ ( W t − W 0 ) / W 0 ] × 100 % where W t is the weight of the swelling hydrogels at different times, W 0 is the initial weight."
10,Biocompatibility evaluation,"2.9 Biocompatibility evaluation The biocompatibility of PVP/GA composite hydrogels was tested using live/dead staining and MTT assay. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM medium which contain 10% FBS and 10 units/mL penicillin−streptomycin. They were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a saturated humidity incubator. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates with a density of 3.0 × 103 cells per well. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay after culturing for one day and five days. 20 μL of MTT (5.0 mg/mL in PBS) was added into each well and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was aspirated and finally DMSO was added. OD (optical density) values were measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Infinite F50, TECAN). The appearance of the cells was observed using an Olympus LX70-140 inverted fluorescence microscope. The cells were stained with calcein AM and propidium iodide (PI) before imaging. The relative cell viability was calculated using the following equation [38,39]: Relative cell viability ( % ) = A h y d r o g e l / A c o n t r o l × 100 % where A hydrogel is the absorbance for cells cultured in the hydrogel piece and A control is the absorbance for cells cultured in cell culture medium. For each hydrogel formulation, three independent cultures were prepared, and the cytotoxicity test was repeated three times."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Structural characterization of hydrogel,"3.1 Structural characterization of hydrogel The PVP/GA composite hydrogels with various concentrations of GA were prepared using a simple physical mixing process. To determine whether hydrogels were formed through hydrogen bonding, the GA, PVP and PVP/GA composite hydrogels were analyzed by FTIR and 13C NMR. The FTIR spectra were presented in Fig. 1 a. The pure PVP showed the characteristic peaks of CO (1658 cm−1) and C–N (1227 cm−1). In the spectrum of PVP/GA composite hydrogels, the CO peak of PVP shifts from 1658 to 1633 cm−1, and C–N bond shifts from 1227 to 1178 cm−1, clearly revealing the formation of hydrogen bonding between PVP and GA [7]. The carbonyl group is sensitive to the chemical environment and has obvious changes of chemical displacement. The peak shape and chemical displacement in the 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 1b) between GA and PVP/GA composite hydrogels did not change, indicating GA kept the original structure. However, the carbonyl peak of 174.7 ppm in PVP shifted to 176.7 ppm in PVP/GA, indicating that strong hydrogen bonds formed between GA and PVP. The 13C NMR results are well in accordance with that of FTIR. The interaction between PVP and GA based on hydrogen bonds is shown in Fig. 1c. The hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups in GA are the hydrogen donors, and the tertiary amide groups and carbanyl groups in PVP are the hydrogen acceptors. The hydrogen bonds between PVP and GA are generated to form PVP/GA composite hydrogel upon mixing of PVP and GA. The hydrogel is stable and compact enough so that it cannot be re-dissolved in water."
13,Properties of PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"3.2 Properties of PVP/GA composite hydrogel To test the self-healing properties of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel, the PVP/GA composite hydrogel was cut into two parts with a knife and observed for self-healing ability. Intriguingly, the re-contacted specimens completely merged to a single hydrogel within only 30 s without any irritation or external force (Fig. 2 a, Movie S1), which is attributed to the reorganization of hydrogen bonds between PVP and GA across the re-contacted hydrogel surface. The self-healed hydrogel can be stretched to a certain length without being damaged. The self-healing property of the hydrogel was completed under room temperature, a condition desirable and suitable for practical applications in wearable electronic sensors. Fig. 2b shows the stretchable property of PVP/GA composite hydrogel with PVP: GA = 1.0:1.0. The hydrogel can be stretched at least 12 times its original length. Due to the different amount of GA added, hydrogels show different softness. The more GA added, the harder the hydrogels get. Furthermore, the PVP/GA composite hydrogel can be smoothly extruded through a syringe, displaying injecting capabilities. It can be injected to a desired shape like “FAFU”, as shown in Fig. 2c. The injectability of the hydrogel is related to the shear thinning property of the hydrogel [40]. Thus, the self-healable, stretchable and injectable PVP/GA composite hydrogels are expected to be applied in many areas such as soft robots and 3D printed wearable devices [41].

14,Rheological behaviors of PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"3.3 Rheological behaviors of PVP/GA composite hydrogel To investigate the rheological and mechanical properties of the PVP/GA composite hydrogels, the storage moduli (G') and loss moduli (G″) of hydrogels with PVP: GA weight ratios of 1.0:0.2, 1.0:1.0, and 1.0:2.0 were monitored. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the G' values are greater than the G″ values over the angular frequency range for all the different types of PVP/GA composite hydrogels, showing a gel-like state. Obviously, when the PVP: GA weight ratio is 1.0 : 1.0, the G' and G″ values were much larger than those of 1.0 : 0.2 and 1.0 : 2.0, indicating that the formation of highly densified hydrogen bonding [42] is achieved in the PVP/GA composite hydrogel of 1.0:1.0. The creep recovery property is shown by the stress-sweep measurement, exhibiting the self-healing behavior of the PVP/GA composite hydrogels in response to the rheological changes. As shown in Fig. 3b, when the initial oscillatory strain at 1% was switched to 500%, the G' of the hydrogel decreased immediately and was lower than the G"". The higher G″ indicated the hydrogel was in a quasi-liquid state. The high shear stress broke the gel structure, reflecting the breakage of interactions between GA and PVP. However, once the external strain returns to 1%, G′ and G″ of the hydrogel are immediately restored to the original gel-like state. This sol-gel transition demonstrated that PVP/GA composite hydrogels have excellent self-healing behavior."
15,Mechanical properties of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"3.4 Mechanical properties of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel In order to study the mechanical properties of the PVP/GA composite hydrogels, stress-strain mechanical tests of hydrogels with different PVP: GA ratios were carried out (Fig. 4 a). The hydrogel of PVP: GA = 1.0: 0.2 is too soft to measure its mechanical properties. As the amounts of GA increased, the stress of the hydrogels enhanced gradually, as shown in Fig. 4b. When the GA increased up to 1.0, elongation attained to 1306% of the original length and the stress was 0.25 MPa, showing the hydrogel of PVP: GA = 1.0: 1.0 has good mechanical properties. The increase in the stress of hydrogel can be ascribed to the dense network structure. The further increase in GA results in a decrease in the tensile stress. Therefore, the hydrogel with GA of 1.0 achieved maximum strain. To further investigate the mechanical properties of the healed hydrogel, the self-healed hydrogel of PVP: GA = 1.0: 1.0 was prepared by cutting the samples into halves with a blade and re-contacting without any external stimulus. Fig. 4c showed the typical strain-stress curves of the original and self-healed hydrogel. The self-healing strain and stress were 831% and 0.16 MPa. These results indicate that the healed hydrogels can restore their structure largely after damage and PVP/GA composite hydrogels have good self-healing properties."
16,Sensing performance of the conductive hydrogels,"3.5 Sensing performance of the conductive hydrogels The conductive ability was monitored by the luminance variation of a blue light-emitting diode (LED) bulb in the circuit during the cutting/contacting process (Fig. 5 a, Movie S2). The hydrogel made the LED bulb light up, showing the hydrogel is electrically conductive. The conductivity of the hydrogel is due to the presence of carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups in GA, which can be ionized to generate carboxylate anions, phenoxy anions, and hydrogen ions. Those electrically charged ions can conduct electricity, making hydrogel become conductive. When the hydrogel was cut open, the bulb went off. However, when the hydrogel re-contacted, the bulb lit up again, indicating the self-healing ability. Furthermore, the brightness of the bulb varies upon stretching and releasing of the hydrogel (Movie S3). After stretching, the brightness of the bulb reduced. The brightness recovered when the stress was released. This is due to the length of the stretched hydrogels, as the longer length results in the increase of resistance. The fast self-healing and sensitive conductive hydrogel achieved by simple physical blending exhibits potential to produce self-healing smart devices. The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Multimedia component 2 Multimedia component 2 Multimedia component 3 Multimedia component 3 The electrical performance of hydrogel was tested using a four-point probe. When PVP: GA is 1.0: 0.2, the conductivity is 1.7 × 10−4 S/cm (Fig. 5b). As the ratio of GA continues to increase, the conductivity gradually increases. When the proportion of PVP and GA is 1.0: 1.0, the conductivity achieved the largest value of 5.7 × 10−4 S/cm, which is ascribed to the increased carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl content. However, as the ratio of GA further increases, the conductivity became saturated. This is due to the optimal weight ratio for hydrogen bonding being 1.0: 1.0, and the excess GA is removed by immersion in ultrapure water. Furthermore, the properties of hydrogel under various pH values were studied. When the prepared hydrogel was immersed into the dilute hydrochloric acid solution with pH less than 4.6, the hydrogel became tougher. The conductivity of hydrogel under pH of 4.6 was measured to be 4.1 × 10−4 S/cm. However, when the hydrogel was placed in the sodium hydroxide solution with pH higher than 9.0, the hydrogel gradually disappeared. This indicates that the hydrogel was not stable and the hydrogen bonding between PVP and GA was prone to destruction under alkali solution. To explore the strain-dependent conductivity variation, the hydrogel was stretched by cyclic tension. Fig. 5c shows the relative electrical resistance changes of the hydrogel with PVP: GA ratio of 1.0: 1.0. The electrical resistance was recorded when 400% tensile strain was applied. The conductivity of the hydrogel was stable during cyclic deformation. When it was stretched up to 400%, the value of relative electrical resistance change was approximately 2.5. After the hydrogel was released to restore the original shape, the electrical resistance rapidly recovered to initial value, showing that the PVP/GA is sensitive to the deformation. Due to its flexibility and high sensitivity in response to deformation, the hydrogel was directly exploited as strain sensors. Since wearable electronic devices need contact with human skin, the adhesion strength of hydrogels should be evaluated. Due to the biological similarity to human skin, porcine skins were used for bio-adhesive measurements. The single lap joint shear test was carried out to access the adhesive performance of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel. The measured adhesion strength of hydrogel to porcine skin was 50 kPa, showing that the hydrogel has good adhesion on biological skin. To monitor diverse human activities in real time, the hydrogel was attached to human skin. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, when the finger was bent from the original straightened state to 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90°, the stretching of the hydrogel generated a corresponding increase in the relative resistance change to 0.10, 0.30, 0.50, and 0.85, respectively. Moreover, at each certain bending angle, the variation of resistance was found to be repeatable and reliable during the cyclic bending and straightening process, showing excellent repeatability along with fast response. Similarly, the hydrogel mounted on the wrist also distinguished the bending activity repeatedly with a stable resistance change (Fig. 6b). In addition to the successful detection of large-scale motions (mentioned above), the capability of the hydrogel to monitor subtle motions was further demonstrated. The hydrogel was placed over the radial artery to detect resistance change under relaxed conditions. When the hand was relaxed and clenched, the relative resistance changes are about 0.11 and 0.02, respectively (Fig. 6c). When the volunteer pronounced different phrases such as “how are you”, “thank you”, and “nice to meet you” in sequence, the diverse vibrations of the vocal cords could be recorded accordingly and these phrases were readily differentiated by the distinct patterns of the signals (Fig. 6d). As displayed in Fig. 6e, by attaching the hydrogel to the neck, movement of the throat caused by repetitive swallowing was clearly reflected by the change of resistance with two associated peaks. Various monitoring of physiological activities of the human body indicate that the PVP/GA composite hydrogels are suitable for wearable devices for the detection of human activities with high sensitivity and reliability."
17,Swelling ratio of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"3.6 Swelling ratio of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel Fig. 7 shows the swelling behaviors of the hydrogels after several hours of immersion in water. When the ratio of PVP and GA is 1.0: 0.2, the final swelling ratio reaches 230%. As the proportion of GA increases, its swelling ratio gradually decreases to about 105%. The most compact network structure was formed when the proportion of PVP and GA is less than 1.0: 1.0. This is because, as the amount of GA increases, more hydrogen bonds are formed between GA and PVP, leading to the increased crosslinking density of the hydrogel."
18,Biocompatibility of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel,"3.7 Biocompatibility of the PVP/GA composite hydrogel Biocompatibility is a vital requirement for the hydrogel used in direct contact with human skin. It is necessary to detect the biocompatibility for the biomedical applications. NIH 3T3 cells are mouse embryonic fibroblast that is characterized every 3 days and usually used for transfection and gene expression studies. Therefore, the relative viability of the cultured NIH 3T3 cells on the PVP/GA composite hydrogels was used to assess the biocompatibility using the time points of MTT assay at day 1 and day 5, as shown in Fig. 8 a. Blank group was used as a control for a comparison. To study the cell morphology, the cells were first double stained with calcein AM/PI. Using this strategy, the live cells were stained green and dead ones were stained red. The fluorescence diagram of the hydrogels is shown in Fig. 8b. The cells after 1 day of culture grown on hydrogels present a spread, irregular shape with protrusions. The percentage viability of the cells on the hydrogel is 95%. This result manifested that the cells attach on the hydrogel [43]. After 5 days of culture, the cell number increased drastically, indicating a flourishing living state on the hydrogels. Many cells are aggregated together because of the weak interaction between cells and the substance [31]. It is believed that the improved cell affinity on the hydrogels was mainly due to the presence of biocompatible pyrogallol groups. Pyrogallol groups are helpful for serum absorption on the hydrogel surface, which is favorable for cell attachment and proliferation. The percentage viability of the cells is 85%. It was reported relative cell viability less than 70% was considered cytotoxic [44]. Thus, NIH 3T3 cell measurement indicated that the hydrogels are biocompatible. It is understandable that both the biocompatible PVP [45] and GA [46] lead to the biocompatible hydrogels. These results testify that the PVP/GA composite hydrogel possessed good biocompatibility with living organisms and may be explored as electronic skin and wearable electronic sensors."
19,Conclusion,"In summary, we fabricated a multifunctional PVP/GA composite hydrogel. Strong hydrogen bonding between the tertiary amide groups in PVP and hydroxyl groups in GA leads to the formation of PVP/GA composite hydrogel. The PVP/GA composite hydrogel exhibits good self-healable, injectable, stretchable, self-adhesive, conductive, and biocompatible properties. PVP/GA composite hydrogels possess excellent self-healing ability without external stimulus, high stretchability with 1309% elongation, injectability, and good biocompatibility with living organisms. The hydrogels can adhere to human skin to detect physiological activity signals with high sensitivity and reliability according to resistance signals, which could be explored as electronic skin and wearable biosensors."
