0,Introduction,"Approximately 100 million tons of lignin are generated as solid waste from the paper pulp and cellulosic ethanol industries every year [1,2]. Because of its intricate structure this waste lignin is mainly used as a fuel [3]. However, lignin depolymerization methods produce small molecules that can be converted into high-value or high-demand chemicals. For example, fast pyrolysis and liquefaction of lignin have been reported to give guaiacol [4–8]. The catalytic hydrogenation of guaiacol in gas phase is typically run at ≥ 300 °C and produces aromatic compounds such as benzene, phenol, anisole, or catechol [9–13]. The liquid phase catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol produces hydrocarbons under high H2 pressures and temperatures (≥ 50 bar and ≥ 200 °C) [14–21]. While hydrogenation at elevated temperatures and pressures leads to hydrocarbons, milder conditions increase the selectivity to oxygenates such as the mixture of cyclohexanone (CHN) and cyclohexanol (CHL) known as KA oil [22,23], an industrial precursor of nylons [24,25]. The annual production of KA oil exceeds 1 million tons, with 69 % produced from the oxidation of cyclohexane/cyclohexene [26,27]. Thus, the catalytic hydrotreatment of guaiacol, involving hydrodemethoxylation via CO bond hydrogenolysis and CC bond hydrogenation, provides an alternative route to KA oil from biorenewable resources (Scheme 1 ). The conversion of guaiacol to KA oil has been extensively studied. For example, Xu and coworkers reported a 92 % CHL yield from guaiacol with Ru/ZrO2-La(OH)3 at 200 °C and 40 bar H2 [28], while Long et al. obtained 98 % CHL using Ni/MgO in decalin at 160 °C and 30 bar H2 [22]. Recently, Han et al. reported 100 % conversion and 84 % CHL yield with Ru-TiO2-SiO2 catalyst under 15 bar H2 at 160 °C. However, reactions performed at 5 bar H2 resulted in low guaiacol conversion (< 40 %) and phenol as the main product [29]. Although some impressive progress in the production of CHL from guaiacol has been achieved, state-of-the-art catalysis for reduction of lignin derivatives is typically performed at temperatures above 160 °C and employs considerable molar excess of H2 (pressures ≥10 bar) [17,19,20,22,23,29–34]. Importantly, the use of large H2 excess entails significant energy waste, infrastructure costs, and safety concerns. Advanced catalysts may allow for milder reaction conditions and improved efficiency. For instance, palladium supported on high surface area ceria (Pd/HS CeO2) shows promising conversion of guaiacol to KA oil at 100 °C and 10 bar H2 [35], albeit with poor selectivity. To advance this conversion, we sought to understand the experimental factors influencing the pathways for guaiacol conversion to CHL and CHN as well as the pathway to 2-methoxycyclohexanol by-product. In this study, we have discovered an inverse relationship between H2 pressure and KA oil selectivity in guaiacol conversions using Pd/HS CeO2 as the catalyst. The relationship is determined by differences between H2 consumption in competing hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation pathways, and by binding of guaiacol hydroxyl to the CeO2 support. The near quantitative consumption of H2 in these low-pressure conversions advances the principle of atom economy in efficient catalytic hydrodeoxygenations."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate, nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate, palladium(II) acetate, cerium(IV) oxide (Com CeO2), 10 wt% palladium on carbon (Pd/C), guaiacol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, cyclohexane, anisole, 3-methoxyphenol, 4-methoxyphenol, syringol, 3,5-dimethoxyphenol, 2,3-dimethoxyphenol, 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d 4 acid sodium salt, and deuterium oxide (99.9 %) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Pluronic P104 was provided by BASF. 2-methoxycyclohexanol was obtained from Alfa Aesar. 2-methoxycyclohexanone was purchased from TCI. Chloroform-d with 1% tetramethylsilane (TMS) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and isopropanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All commercial chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation High surface CeO2 was synthesized following our previously reported method [35,36]. Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O (8.8 g) and Pluronic P104 (10.1 g) were dissolved in ethanol (200 mL). The solution was stirred at 700 rpm for 3 h at room temperature and ambient pressure. Then, the solution was evaporated to dryness at 60 °C for 10 h, and the residue was further dried at 150 °C for an additional 10 h. Finally, the material was calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 4 h with the heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Pd/HS CeO2 was synthesized through an impregnation method. First, Pd(O2CCH3)2 (21 mg, 0.094 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (4 mL). HS CeO2 (1.0 g) was placed in a mortar, and the Pd(O2CCH3)2 solution was added in portions (0.2 mL per addition). Following each addition, the material was mixed by grinding with the pestle, and then dried in the oven for 10 min. After the impregnation, the material was calcined at 350 °C for 2 h. Finally, the material was reduced under flowing H2 at 350 °C for 2 h. Pd/Com CeO2 (1 wt% Pd) was prepared with the same method."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The surface area was measured by N2 sorption isotherms at −196 °C in a Micromeritics Tristar analyzer. Before the measurement, the catalyst was pretreated in N2 flow for 6 h at 100 °C. The surface area was obtained based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. To obtain the Pd loading, the catalyst (5.0 mg) was digested with 2 mL aqua regia for 1 h, and then diluted to 10 mL with DI water. After filtration, the Pd concentration in the solution was tested with a PerkinElmer Optima 2100 DV Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was performed in an FEI Teneo LoVac Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Images taken at high vacuum were acquired at 5 kV and 25 pA with a T1 Detector. Images taken at low vacuum were collected at 10 kV, 0.1 nA, and 0.22 Torr with a Low Vacuum Detector. The instrument is equipped with an Oxford energy dispersive and backscattered electron detectors for EDS analysis. For the High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM), the sample was dispersed in dilute ethanol and sonicated for 10 min. One drop of the suspension was added onto a lacey-carbon-coated copper grid. Images were acquired in an FEI Tecnai G2-F20 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope operating at 200 kV. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed in a Micromeritics AutoChem II instrument. The catalyst was oxidized at 350 °C for 1 h, and then reduced in H2/Ar (10/90) from ambient temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The hydrogen chemisorption was investigated with the same instrument. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h and swept with Ar for 1 h. The sample was then cooled in Ar to -35 °C for H2 pulse measurements. The XRD patterns of the catalysts were analyzed in a Bruker D8 Advance X-Ray Diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 44 mA) and a Ni filter. The crystallite size (τ) was determined by the Scherrer Equation [37]: (1) τ = K λ β c o s θ where K is the dimensionless shape factor (0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15406 nm), β is the full width at half-maximum (radians), and θ is the Bragg angle (radians). The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in a Kratos Amicus/ESCA 3400 instrument. The sample was irradiated with Mg Kα X-rays, and the photoelectrons emitted at 0° from the surface normal were energy analyzed using a DuPont type analyzer. C 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used for the calibration."
5,Catalytic hydrogenation of guaiacol,"2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of guaiacol The reactions were conducted in a Mettler Toledo EasyMax™ Pressure Reactor. The reactor volume was 120 mL. In each reaction, guaiacol (200 μmol) was added to 25 mL water with 53 mg 1 wt% Pd/HS CeO2. The Pd/guaiacol ratio was 2.5 mol%. The reactor was purged with H2 (5×) and then set at the desired pressure (note that pressure gauge readout is 0.0 for atmospheric pressure, i.e. ca. 1 bar). The contents were heated to 100 °C (note that pressure gauge readout increases with temperature due to gas expansion and to contribution of the vapor pressure of the solvent) and kept for 4 h under mechanical stirring (800 rpm). After the reaction, the reactor was cooled at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to r.t. For experiments with 0.5 bar H2 partial pressure, a tank was charged with 20 bar N2 and then with 20 bar H2 at r.t., the mixture was then delivered to the reactor to achieve a total pressure of 1 bar. The liquid (solution) and solid (catalyst) were separated by centrifugation. The solution (100 μL) was diluted with ethanol to 1.00 mL and analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector (GC/MS, 7890A, 5975C with HP-5MS column) using resorcinol as the internal standard. The oven temperature was ramped from 60 to 150 °C at 5 °C min−1, and then ramped to 280 °C at 20 °C min−1 holding for 1 min. Guaiacol conversion was calculated as: (2) c o n v e r s i o n = 1 - G t / G o × 100 % where Gt and Go are the moles of guaiacol at the time of sampling and at the start of the reaction (200 μmol) respectively. The selectivity to a certain product was calculated by the moles of this product divided by the total amount (moles) of all the products times 100 %. The total H2 utilization efficiency (u.e.) was calculated as: (3) t o t a l H 2 u t i l i z a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y = ( C H L × 4 + C H N × 3 + M C H × 3 h e a d s p a c e H 2 + d i s s o l v e d H 2 ) × 100 % where CHL, CHN, and MCH denote the moles of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and 2-methoxycyclohexanol, respectively. The moles of headspace H2 were calculated from the reactor headspace volume (0.095 L) applying the ideal gas law (3.9 mmol for 1.0 bar at 293 K), and the moles of dissolved H2 were calculated from the saturation concentration of the gas in water as a function of its pressure (Henry’s law, 0.81 mM for 1 bar at 298 K) times the volume of water (0.025 L). The H2 utilization efficiency for KA oil was calculated from Eq. (4): (4) H 2 u t i l i z a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y f o r K A o i l = C H L × 4 + C H N × 3 h e a d s p a c e H 2 + d i s s o l v e d H 2 For NMR analysis, a 3 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform-d (3 × 0.33 mL). GC/MS analysis (detection limit lower than 10 μM) showed no products in the original solution after the extraction, indicating sufficient extraction from the original solution (8 mM). The NMR results were obtained with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz Spectrometer. The 1% TMS in chloroform-d was used as the internal standard."
6,Hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions,"2.5 Hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions The H/D exchange reactions were conducted in an NMR tube with a J. Young valve. Before the reaction, the catalyst (10 mg), deuterated solvent (1 mL) and dimethyl sulfone (2.5 mg, 27 μmol) as internal standard were placed in the tube. A blank spectrum was collected to measure the initial amount of 1H in the solvent. The tube was then purged with H2 for 10 min to make sure air was completely removed. The NMR tube was then heated to 100 °C for 4 h. After that, the tube was allowed to cool down and the 1H content was measured by NMR. The increment of 1H was calculated from the difference of the 1H content before and after the reaction."
7,In-situ measurement of H/D exchange with diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS),"2.6 In-situ measurement of H/D exchange with diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) The H/D exchange on the catalyst (Pd/HS CeO2) was investigated in-situ with DRIFTS. The measurement was performed on a Bruker Vertex 80 FT-IR spectrophotometer equipped with a HeNe laser and photovoltaic MCT detector. For each spectrum, 128 scans were collected with the resolution of 4 cm−1. For the D2O-H2 experiment, the fresh catalyst was treated with dry N2 (50 mL min−1) at 150 °C for 1 h to remove the adsorbed moisture. After cooling down to room temperature, N2 was redirected through a saturator with D2O for 55 min and spectra were taken every 5 min. Another 25 min was allowed for N2 flow without D2O to get a stable signal. Pure H2 (50 mL min−1) was then flowed for 50 min and the spectra were taken every 2 min from 1 to 21 min and every 5 min from 25 to 60 min. Similar procedures were followed for the H2O-D2 experiment."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalytic conversion of guaiacol to KA oil,"3.1 Catalytic conversion of guaiacol to KA oil A comparison of Pd/HS CeO2 (surface area 126 m2 g−1) versus Pd/Com CeO2 (surface area 57 m2 g−1) and commercial palladium on carbon (Pd/C, surface area 637 m2 g−1) in catalytic guaiacol reduction highlights the considerable advantage of the former catalyst in terms of conversion and demethoxylation selectivity under mild reaction conditions (2.5 mol % Pd, 4 h, 100 °C, 11 bar H2, Table 1 entries 1–3; for catalysts characterization see Supplementary data section S1). Quantification of the observed CHN, CHL, and 2-methoxycyclohexanol (2-MCH) products and unreacted guaiacol provides good carbon balance of 90–105 %, and no other products were detected in the reaction mixtures. Control experiments lacking Pd, or substituting H2 with N2, as well as tests varying catalyst, temperature, and pressure indicate that 1 wt% Pd/HS CeO2 provides high performance under mild conditions (Tables S5 and S6). Dispersion of Pd on the supports (58 %, 28 % and 19 % for Pd/HS CeO2, Pd/C and Pd/Com CeO2, respectively, Table S1) correlates well with the order of guaiacol conversion, indicating differences in activity can be directly attributed to the amount of Pd surface in each catalyst. The highest Pd dispersion observed on HS CeO2 results from a combination of its high surface area and strong interactions with the metal. In contrast to the differences in conversion, the demethoxylation selectivity does not follow a simple trend: the KA oil selectivity is ca. 3.5 times higher using Pd/HS CeO2 than Pd/C and Pe/Com CeO2, suggesting that additional factors play a role in the reaction. Remarkably, selectivity for the desired KA oil increases with lower H2 pressure (1 bar) diminishing the formation of 2-MCH side product with consistently high guaiacol conversion (Fig. 1 ). A further decrease of H2 concentration by 50 % dilution in N2 (1 bar total pressure), gives an additional increase in selectivity to KA oil to around 60 %, while the 4 h conversion of guaiacol remains at 90 %. The use of dilute H2 creates a new standard for evaluating atom efficiency in hydrogenations. In this regard, the H2 utilization efficiency (u.e.) for the reaction using 0.5 bar H2 is 31.2 %, with 20.0 % consumed to produce KA oil (Table 2 ). For reference, the total amount of H2 introduced into the reactor at 20 °C under 1 or 11 bar are 3.9 and 44 mmol, respectively. The amount of guaiacol is 0.2 mmol (25 mL, 8 mM) under our standard reaction conditions, and its full conversion requires only 0.6-0.8 mmol H2 depending on product selectivity. H2 utilization efficiency improves to 86.3 % in experiments at higher guaiacol concentration (40 mM, 2.5 mol% Pd), with 51 % incorporated in the desired products (Table 2). In a typical experiment, the reactor was charged with 1 bar H2 at room temperature and the temperature was ramped to 100 °C. After 15 min, the pressure gauge read ca. 1.7 bar and then steadily decreased to ca. 1.05 bar after 6 h (Fig. 2 ). The residual pressure corresponded mainly to the solvent’s vapor pressure, confirming that very little H2 remained after the reaction. For comparison, H2 pressures of 11 bar (the lowest previous pressure for state-of-the-art catalysts) under these conditions would correspond to 1.4 % H2 utilization efficiency at ∼100 % guaiacol conversion (Table 2) [20,29,30]. This ca. 99 % H2 excess is either wasted, or requires additional gas-recycling infrastructure that complicates reactor design and limits applications in small-scale and distributed manufacturing. These results contrast a recently reported Ru-based catalyst, where quantitative guaiacol conversion and high KA oil selectivity (∼80 %) at 15 bar H2 and 160 °C in only 1.5 h drops to less than 40 % conversion and poor selectivity (< 10 %) at 5 bar H2 for the same temperature and time [29]. Likewise, the activity of Pd/C diminishes as pressure decreases, while its KA oil selectivity is consistently poor (Table 1). Thus Pd/HS CeO2 catalyst allows producing KA oil from guaiacol at low temperatures and H2 pressures. The easy preparation of Pd/HS CeO2 by impregnation is complemented by the highly recyclable nature of this catalyst. Activity remains constant (70 % conversion after 2 h, 1 bar H2, 100 °C) over five catalytic reactions, and the selectivity for KA oil is even slightly improved to 60 % [Fig. 3 (a)]. The concentration of Pd and Ce in the filtrate of the reaction mixture is below ICP-OES detection limits. The surface area of the catalyst after cycles was still 106 m2 g−1, indicating the high-surface-area structure persisted during the reaction. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern and the Ce 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were equivalent before the first reaction and after 5 cycles [Fig. 3(b) and (c)], suggesting that the support crystallinity was unchanged by the reaction conditions. Furthermore, the absence of Pd reflections in the spent catalyst suggests there is no significant Pd sintering after the reaction. The HR-TEM image of the spent catalyst also showed no apparent changes after 5 cycles [Fig. 3(d)]."
10,Reaction pathways,"3.2 Reaction pathways Additional experiments provide insight into the reaction pathways and illustrate the role that reactant functionality plays in determining selectivity. First, longer guaiacol hydrogenation times (e.g., 6 h) provide equivalent yields of 2-MCH (Fig. S7). Also, an authentic sample of the side product 2-MCH, subjected to catalytic conditions (Pd/HS CeO2, 11 bar H2, 100 °C, 4 h), is recovered quantitatively. Neither CHN nor CHL is detected in that reaction mixture. Thus, 2-MCH is a terminal side product and not a reaction intermediate. Possible intermediates on the pathway from guaiacol to 2-MCH, such as dihydro- or tetrahydro-guaiacol, are not detected in reaction mixtures. Instead, phenol is observed after 30 min in Pd/HS CeO2-catalyzed reactions of guaiacol under 1 bar H2 at 100 °C. A significant amount of CHN (19.5 %) is formed under those experimental conditions. Moreover, the reaction of phenol and H2, catalyzed by Pd/HS CeO2, provides CHL in quantitative yield (Table S7, entry 3), as previously reported [14,36]. CHN is observed in Pd/HS CeO2-catalyzed guaiacol conversions under H2-poor conditions (Table 2) but is not detected in reactions at H2 pressures 3 bar or higher. An authentic sample of CHN is quantitatively converted to cyclohexanol at 11 bar H2 (Table S7, entry 4). On the basis of these results, we propose that demethoxylation of guaiacol affords phenol that is quickly converted to CHN and CHL (Pathway I, Scheme 2 ). Hydrogenative dearomatization of guaiacol to 2-MCH is a competing route (Pathway II), and selectivity is determined by the divergence of the two pathways in the first step. A reasonable rationale for the increased demethoxylation selectivity at low H2 concentration involves delivery of less hydrogen to guaiacol. The first H addition to guaiacol could be followed either by a second H addition resulting in dearomatization (leading to 2-MCH) or by C–OMe bond cleavage by methoxy migration to Pd (i.e., β-methoxy elimination) to give phenol. The former step would require additional surface H, whereas the latter step would be hydrogen-free and would therefore be favored by low H2 concentration. Moreover, the stoichiometry of 2-MCH formation requires addition of 6 H to guaiacol, whereas phenol needs only 2 H. These explanations, however, only play a part in the H2-dependent selectivity because Pd/C does not show the same effect (Table 1). Because the aryl hydroxy group is retained in these reactions, the effects of its presence and location with respect to the methoxy group provide an additional basis for comparing the catalysts and rationalizing selectivity. Interestingly, Pd/HS CeO2 is not an effective catalyst for demethoxylation or hydrogenation of anisole under our reaction conditions (2.5 mol% Pd, 100 °C, 11 bar H2, 4 h): it gives less than 6% conversion in contrast to the quantitative conversion obtained for guaiacol. Remarkably, Pd/C as a catalyst gives 100 % and 60 % conversion of anisole and guaiacol at the same conditions, respectively (Table 3 entry 3 and Table 1 entry 3), with hydrogenation and demethylation/hydrogenation products formed. In this context, Pd/HS CeO2 is more chemoselective in conversions of arenes than Pd/C: while the former promotes only the reduction of phenolic arenes, the latter catalyzes the hydrogenation of both phenolic and hydroxyl-free arenes. These results suggest that activity and selectivity of Pd/CeO2 under the mild conditions used in this study must be associated to interactions between the reactants and the support. Specifically: the high activity of Pd/CeO2 for guaiacol hydrogenation should be due to interactions of the hydroxyl group with the surface of the support, very likely hydrogen-bonding interactions. The higher demethoxylation activity of 3- and 4-methoxyphenol compared to guaiacol indicates steric hindrance plays an important role in the reactions catalyzed both by Pd/HS CeO2 (Table 3 entries 6, 8, 9). This steric effect is more evident in reactions using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (syringol) (entry 10 compared to entry 5). In contrast, 2,3-dimethoxyphenol and 3,5-dimethoxyphenol reach full conversion in 4 h with Pd/HS CeO2, giving >53 % selectivity for at least one demethoxylation step (11 bar H2, 100 °C). Full demethoxylation selectivity is higher for the 3,5- (30 %) than the 2,3-isomer (21 %), further evidencing the role of sterics in the reaction (entries 11 and 12)."
11,Role of water solvent,"3.3 Role of water solvent Prior studies on phenol hydrogenation have shown that water, as the solvent, can also interact with the surface sites of Pd or CeO2 [36,38–40]. Replacing water with alcohols drastically decreases Pd/HS CeO2 activity for guaiacol reduction (Table 4 entries 4, 8, 9, and 10). No conversion is obtained in methanol, and a small amount of products are formed in ethanol, n-propanol, and isopropanol (7–14 % conversion, < 0–5 % selectivity for CHL, 4 h, 11 bar H2; Table 4). The fresh and methanol-treated catalysts provide equivalent XRD patterns and XPS data (Figs. S4 and S5), while the deactivated catalyst recovers some performance in subsequent guaiacol conversions in water (Table 4, entry 7). The activity of Pd/C for guaiacol hydrogenation is also lower in methanol than in water. Alternatively, hydroxyl-free solvent, cyclohexane, gives ∼50 % guaiacol conversion and poor KA oil selectivity with Pd/HS CeO2 at 11 bar H2 (entry 11). Thus, the solvent-effected relative activity of Pd/HS CeO2 for guaiacol conversion under our reaction conditions is: H2O >> cyclohexane >> propanol > ethanol > methanol. Facile H/D exchange reactions between H2 and D2O catalyzed by Pd/HS CeO2 show that H2O and H2 concurrently interact with the Pd catalyst (Table 5 ), likely through dissociative adsorption steps that allow hydrogen atoms to exchange. This exchange process is minimal with Pd-free HS CeO2, while Pd/C is also a reported catalyst for H2/D2O exchange [39,40]. Interestingly, the exchangeable deuterium in methanol-d4 does not undergo exchange with H2 in the presence of Pd/HS CeO2, and the 1H NMR signals for MeOH are consistently low in reaction mixtures containing MeOH-d4, H2, and Pd/HS CeO2. Guaiacol, however, does not inhibit H/D exchange, and instead, deuterium from D2O is incorporated into hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation products even in reactions performed under an initial H2 atmosphere. Up to 9 D atoms are found in both exchangeable and non-acidic sites in the CHL, CHN, and 2-MCH products, as determined by fragmentation products in MS [41] and quantitative NMR analysis (Figs S8-S12, Table S8). In experiments at partial conversion, the guaiacol starting material contains D only in the exchangeable OH moiety while only H are present in the aromatic and methoxy groups. As an aside, the catalytic conversion and selectivity for hydrodemethoxylation is the same in H2O and D2O. The H/D exchange between H2 and D2O catalyzed by Pd/HS CeO2 was also studied using in-situ DRIFTS (Fig. 4 and Fig. S13). Treatment of the catalyst with a stream of D2O in N2 led to a gradual increase of the CeO–D stretching band [2503 cm−1, Fig. 4(a)]. The signal intensity is not affected by a stream of dry N2, at least over 25 min. In contrast, a pure H2 stream (50 mL min−1) resulted in a rapid decrease in the intensity of the CeO–D band, becoming almost zero after 50 min [Fig. 4(c)]. The drop in CeO–D band intensity followed a first-order kinetics [Fig. 4(d)], and indicated the fast H/D exchange on the surface of the Pd/HS CeO2 catalyst. A number of comparisons in these systems suggest that the combination of catalytic metal sites, HS CeO2, water, and the hydroxyl group of the phenolic substrate are mutually beneficial for hydrodemethoxylation of arenes. First, water binds to and is dissociated by the catalysts, as evidenced by H/D exchange catalyzed by Pd/HS CeO2 and Pd/C. Water also positively influences the catalytic activity for guaiacol conversion and the selectivity for hydrodemethoxylation. However, the palladium hydride species from water adsorption are unlikely to deliver H to guaiacol because Pd/HS CeO2 does not catalyze demethoxylation in the absence of H2. Second, methanol is deactivating to both Pd/HS CeO2 and Pd/C for H2 addition to guaiacol and for H/D exchange. The similarities of Pd/HS CeO2 and Pd/C suggest that the low conversion in methanol may be due to partial Pd deactivation through alcohol coordination to catalytic Pd sites [42], as well as a shift in guaiacol hydrodemethoxylation equilibrium because methanol is also by-product in the hydrodemethoxylation route. It must be noted that similar to water, methanol may also compete with the phenolic hydroxyl of guaiacol for binding sites at the CeO2 surface, but not at the C support. Third, the hydroxyl group in methoxyphenols gives improved catalytic activity in Pd/HS CeO2 catalyzed reactions, while Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogen additions to guaiacol are slower than additions to hydroxy-free anisole. Thus, Pd/HS CeO2 requires a hydroxy-containing substrate whereas Pd/C does not. The order of reactivity of methoxyphenols, catalyzed by Pd/HS CeO2, at 100 °C and ⩽11 bar H2 follows: 3-methoxy ∼ 4-methoxy > 3,5-dimethoxy ∼ 2,3-dimethoxy ∼ 2-methoxy (guaiacol) >> 2,6-dimethoxy > anisole. The hydroxy group may be ortho-, meta-, or para, suggesting that its role is to bind to the catalytic material allowing H to be delivered ipso to the C–OMe. Because the ortho-OMe is the slowest of the three isomers, we propose that the site binding the hydroxy does not deliver the hydride. Instead, hydroxy could bind via hydrogen-bonding to CeO2 next to the Pd site (Fig. 5 ). In the latter case, lower H2 concentration could diminish the rate of sequential H addition resulting in higher demethoxylation selectivity. This type of binding at the Pd-support interface is possible with CeO2 but not with C, which explains the differences in H2 pressure-dependent selectivity observed between the two supports."
12,Conclusions,"In conclusion, guaiacol is converted into biorenewable-derived precursors of nylon at low temperature and even sub-ambient H2 pressure. The combination of Pd/HS CeO2, water, and low H2 pressure provides two kinds of selectivity: (a) preferential conversion of phenolic substrates versus simple arenes and (b) a pathway for hydrodemethoxylation over arene hydrogenation. These features, as well as the unusually high mass balance between input H2 and H incorporated into the desired product and the catalyst recyclability, may guide design processes for future catalytic systems that require economic and materials sustainability."
