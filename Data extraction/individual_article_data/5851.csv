0,Introduction,"The Baeyer–Villiger reaction has been used for more than 100 years 1 as an efficient procedure for the synthesis of lactones and ω-hydroxy acids from cyclic ketones. This reaction can be performed using numerous oxidants, such as H2SO5, H2S2O8, perbenzoic acid, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, performic acid, peracetic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid. 2 The asymmetric Baeyer–Villiger oxidation proceeds under catalytic conditions in the presence of transition metals 3 or monooxygenases. 4 The commonly accepted mechanism of acid- or base-catalyzed oxidation of ketones suggested by Criegee 5 (Scheme 1 ) involves the addition of peracids to carbonyl compounds and the rearrangement of the resulting adducts accompanied by the migration of the alkyl group. In almost all studies on the Baeyer–Villiger reaction, the latter was reported to produce hydroxy acids and lactones. The fact that treatment of cyclic ketones with peracetic acid affords dicarboxylic acids (containing the same number of carbon atoms) as by-products was documented in only one study. 6 The oxidation of cyclohexanone gave adipic acid in trace amounts (∼1%). The oxidation of cycloheptanone and cyclooctanone afforded pimelic and suberic acids in 33 and 59% yields, respectively. The problem of the development of efficient methods for the synthesis of dicarboxylic acids and their derivatives has attracted considerable attention for more than half a century, because these compounds are building blocks in the production of polyamide, polyurethane, and polyester polymers, plasticizing agents, lubricants, and anticorrosive systems. The oxidation reactions of cyclic ketones to dicarboxylic acids with nitric acid, 7 potassium permanganate, 8 and other oxidants in the presence of catalysts containing W, 9 Ce, 10 Re, 11 Mn, 12 Cu, 10a Co, 12d,e Pt, 13 V, 14 or Mo 9b,14 were studied in detail. However, simple methods of oxidation (without the use of additional reagents) of cyclic ketones to dicarboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide are lacking."
1,Results and discussion,"In the present study, we report the oxidative transformation of ketones 1a–g in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide in an alcoholic solution, which does not require the use of percarboxylic acids and metal-containing catalysts. This reaction affords dicarboxylic acids 3a–g as the major products, which are then transformed into the corresponding esters 4a–g (Scheme 2 ). The reaction gives also ω-hydroxycarboxylic acid esters as by-products generated by the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation of cycloalkanones. The design of the oxidative reaction differs from that of the Baeyer–Villiger reaction by the order of mixing of the reagents, the temperature conditions, and the concentration of the catalyst (strong acid). Earlier, we have developed a facile procedure for the synthesis of geminal bishydroperoxides from cyclic ketones and hydrogen peroxide in THF at 15–20°C. 15 Under more severe temperature conditions, these bishydroperoxides were demonstrated to be oxidized in alcohols (solvents) with hydrogen peroxide to form dicarboxylic acid esters. 16 These results led us to the idea to use a new procedure for the oxidation of cyclic ketones to dicarboxylic acids, that is, to perform these two reactions in one pot. The essence of this reaction is that the conditions favorable for the formation of geminal bishydroperoxides and for the oxidation of the latter to dicarboxylic acids are created in the first and second steps, respectively. For this purpose, the reaction was performed in two steps. Initially, ketone was added with stirring to a mixture of alcohol, excess hydrogen peroxide, and sulfuric acid at 20–25°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 5–10min and then heated at the boiling point for 20–120min. The oxidation products, dicarboxylic acids, were isolated from the reaction mixture as esters. To confirm the formation of geminal bishydroperoxides in the first step of the oxidative reaction, a series of reactions with hydrogen peroxide were carried out in ethanol and propanol using medium-size ring ketones, such as cyclopentanone 1a, cyclohexanone 1b, 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone 1d, and cycloheptanone 1e. At 20–25°C, the reactions of the above-mentioned ketones afforded geminal bishydroperoxides as the major products in 75–91% yields (Table 1 ). Under the same conditions, the reactions of hydrogen peroxide with cyclooctanone 1f and cyclododecanone 1g produced the corresponding geminal bishydroperoxides 2f,g in low yields (26 and 17%, respectively). It should be emphasized that geminal bishydroperoxides have attracted considerable attention of chemists and pharmacologists because of the high antimalarial activity discovered in these compounds and their derivatives. 17 The mechanism of the oxidation reaction is not quite clear. However, the following sequence of transformations of cyclic ketones into dicarboxylic acids can be suggested. The first step involves the peroxidation of ketones 1. At heating of the reaction mixture the acid-catalyzed transformations of bishydroperoxides 2 occur, which include oxidation using hydrogen peroxide. As a result dicarboxylic acids 3 are formed, which are then transformed into the corresponding esters 4. Attempts to isolate intermediates failed because of the very high rate of oxidation. The influence of the reaction temperature and the sulfuric acid concentration on the yield of dibutyl adipate 4b was exemplified by the oxidation of cyclohexanone bishydroperoxide 2b with the use of butanol as the co-solvent and an esterification reagent (Tables 2 and 3 ). At 50°C, a long period of time (48h) was required to achieve the complete conversion of peroxide 2b. At 98–100°C (boiling point of the reaction mixture), the reaction rate increases by more than two orders of magnitude, and the yield of dibutyl adipate 4b increases from 38 to 68%. These characteristics were achieved at an H2SO4 concentration of 0.5mol/L. An increase in the concentration to 1mol/L leads to an increase in the rate of conversion of peroxide 2b and a simultaneous decrease in the yield of 4b. A decrease in the concentration to 0.1–0.2mol/L results in a decrease in both the reaction rate and the yield of the ester. The choice of butanol was dictated by the necessity to maintain the temperature at ∼100°C; the use of ethanol or propanol instead of butanol leads to a decrease in the boiling point of the reaction mixture and, as a consequence, to a decrease in the yields of the target diethyl and dipropyl adipates. Therefore, the best results in the key step of oxidation of cyclohexanone 1b, which involves the transformation of geminal bishydroperoxide of cyclohexanone 2b into adipic acid 3b accompanied by its esterification to give dibutyl adipate 4b, were obtained at an H2SO4 concentration of 0.4–0.6mol/L and at ∼98°C. Under these conditions, the virtually complete conversion of 2b was achieved within 8–10min. The yield of 4b was 68%. To examine the possibility of the use of low-boiling alcohols for the oxidation of ketones, several reactions were carried out in ethanol and propanol. The influence of an excess of hydrogen peroxide on the yield of diethyl adipate and the diethyl adipate to ethyl 6-hydroxyhexanoate ratio was studied for the oxidation of cyclohexanone 1b in ethanol (the solvent, which has the lowest boiling point in the series of alcohols under study and is, consequently, least favorable for the formation of diesters). It was found that the reaction with the use of the 3-, 5-, or 10-fold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide at the boiling point of the reaction mixture (78–82°C) for 3h afforded diethyl adipate in 32, 51, and 47% yields, respectively; the ratio of the yields of diethyl adipate and ethyl 6-hydroxyhexanoate was 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6, respectively. Therefore, the oxidative reaction alternative to the Baeyer–Villiger reaction is the major process even in low-boiling ethanol. The oxidation of cyclic ketones can be performed in a virtually anhydrous medium. The reaction of cyclohexanone with hydrogen peroxide (the fivefold molar excess; a 6% ethereal solution) in ethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid afforded diethyl adipate in 54% yield; under analogous conditions in an aqueous alcoholic solution, the yield was 51%. The catalytic effect of HBF4 and BF3·Et2O in the oxidation of ketones was exemplified by the synthesis of dipropyl adipate; the yield of the diester was 57 and 65%, respectively. The reaction with BF3·Et2O was carried out with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, which allowed us to perform the oxidation of ketones under mild conditions. The oxidation of ketones with the ring size of C5–C8 and C12 was performed taking into account the results of oxidation of cyclohexanone 1b and its bishydroperoxide 2b (Table 4 )."
2,Conclusion,"It was found that the oxidation of C5–C8 and C12 cyclic ketones with hydrogen peroxide in alcohols in the presence of sulfuric acid can proceed not as the Baeyer–Villiger reaction but as the formation of geminal bishydroperoxides followed by their oxidation to dicarboxylic acids, which were isolated as the corresponding esters. The key conditions for this transformation are as follows: the temperature higher than 80°C, the H2SO4 concentration of 0.2–1mol/L, and the molar ketone to hydrogen peroxide ratio of 5–10. Under these conditions, the oxidation in butanol, which provides the maintenance of the reaction temperature within 98–106°C, affords the corresponding dibutyl esters in 53–70% yields."
