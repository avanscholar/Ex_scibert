0,Introduction,"Finding affordable and efficient hydrogen storage materials is one of the greatest technical challenges facing the upcoming hydrogen economy. In conventional liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), the hydrogen is stored in the unsaturated or aromatic molecules via a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The material can be transported to any location where hydrogen is needed. There the hydrogen is released via the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction and the LOHC is ready to be hydrogenated again. Due to their ease of integration into existing chemical transport infrastructures, LOHC are considered attractive hydrogen storage options compared e.g. to liquid or compressed hydrogen. The disadvantages associated with LOHC, however, include high reaction temperatures and pressures for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation steps and high LOHC costs [1]. In contrast, the LOHC systems have been reported in the literature, which are based on the amide bonds formation from amino alcohols [2,3]. One of the typical LOHC systems is shown in Fig. 1 . This readily reversible system is based on catalytic peptide formation and hydrogenation, using an inexpensive, safe and abundant amino-ethanol with high potential capacity to store and release hydrogen, applying the same catalyst for loading and unloading hydrogen under relatively mild conditions [3]. Taking advantage of the favourable thermodynamics of amide bond formation from cheap and readily available starting materials, such systems can be considered as very suitable for the further development of large-scale commercial processes. An additional motivation for the development of reversible LOHC systems based on amino-alcohols offers the possibility of sustainable access to renewable N-containing chemicals (through reductive amination of platform compounds from biomass [4,5]. For example, a two-step conversion approach for direct synthesis of 2-amino-ethanol from cellulose opens up a promising route towards sustainable production of amino-alcohols from biomass [6]. The complexation of amino-alcohols with various transition metals and metal complexes is another interesting practical and theoretical area. Amino-alcohols are the versatile {N,O}-donor ligands that readily form compounds with almost all metal ions and complexes [7]. For this reason, they are actively used to develop metal-containing precursors for chemical vapour deposition (CVD) -based processes [8] for the production of functional film materials. Complexes with amino alcohols as ligands usually have a number of properties (low melting point, high volatility, reactivity) which are of fundamental importance for precursors of atomic layer deposition [8,9]. The introduction of amino-alcohols as an auxiliary ligand offers new possibilities to tune the precursors to further improve their performance and expand the scope of the deposition reactions. For example, metal β-diketonates are known to have long been recognized as excellent precursors in CVD techniques. The modification of the metal beta-diketonates by the formation of amino alcohol adducts increases the covalence of the metal-β-diketone bond, and therefore a high-quality metal phase is released through the thermal decomposition reaction [10]. Since these complexes have found broad applications in CVD techniques, data on the physico-chemical and thermodynamic properties of amino alcohols as ligands are required for the optimization of the synthesis. Knowledge of reliable thermodynamic data is essential for the design and development of new technologies. Our first study of thermodynamics of amino-alcohols in 2005 revealed a significant lack of reliable data on vapour pressures, vaporization enthalpies, and enthalpies of formation of amino-alcohols [11]. In this paper we studied the series of amino-alcohols shown in Fig. 2 . The focus of this work was on combustion calorimetry. However, we collected and evaluated vapour pressures and standard molar vaporization enthalpies, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), of amino-alcohols available in the current literature. These evaluated results together with new data on standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K), were used to derive the experimental gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K). In order to establish the consistency of new results, the latter experimental values were compared with the theoretical results of the high-level quantum-chemical calculations. Moreover, in order to fulfil the expectation that amino-alcohols can be considered as seminal liquid organic hydrogen carriers, we used new data to calculate the energetics of reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol to produce piperazine-2,5-dione (see Fig. 1). The derived value was discussed in connection with the conventional aromatic LOHCs."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials All samples of amino-alcohols were of commercial origin (see Table S1) with purities of 0.98 to 0.99 mass fraction. Samples for combustion calorimetry were purified by repeated distillation at reduced pressures. Purities were determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column HP-5 and a flame ionization detector. No impurities (greater than the mass fraction 0.0009) were detected. A residual water amount in samples was determined using the Mettler Toledo DL38 Karl Fischer titrator.
3,Experimental and theoretical thermochemical methods,"2.2 Experimental and theoretical thermochemical methods Vapour pressures of 1-amino-2-propanol, 3-amino-1-propanol at different temperatures were measured by using the transpiration method [12,13]. The standard molar enthalpies of vaporization, Δ l g H m o , were derived from the temperature dependences of vapour pressures A self-made high-precision calorimeter equipped with a static bomb [14,15] was used to measure combustion energies of 2-amino-ethanol, 2-(methyl-amino)-ethanol, 2-(dimethyl-amino)-ethanol, 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, and 3-amino-1-propanol. The standard molar enthalpies of combustion, Δ c H m o (liq), and the standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq), of these amino-alcohols were derived according to the Hesśs Law. The quantum-chemical composite G3B3 [16] G3MP2 [17] and G4 [18] methods from Gaussian 09 software [19] were used for calculations of enthalpies H 298-values, which were finally converted to the Δ f H m o (g) and discussed. Short descriptions of computational and experimental techniques applied in this work are given in ESI (Electronic Supporting Information)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Absolute vapour pressures and thermodynamics of vaporization,"3.1 Absolute vapour pressures and thermodynamics of vaporization The experimental vapour pressures, pi , temperature dependences measured with help of the transpiration method for 1-amino-2-propanol and 3-amino-1-propanol were fitted with the following equation [12]: (1) R × ln ( p i / p ref ) = a + b T + Δ l g C p , m o × l n T T 0 where R = 8.31446 J.K−1.mol−1 is the molar gas constant, the reference pressure p ref = 1 Pa, a and b are adjustable parameters, the arbitrary temperature T 0 applied in Eq. (1) was chosen to be T 0 = 298.15 K and Δ l g C p , m o is the difference of the molar heat capacities of the gas and the liquid phases respectively. The Δ l g C p , m o –values are required for the fitting Eq. (1), and later also for the temperature adjustment of vaporization enthalpies according to Kirchhoff’s rule. There are at least four well-established methods that can be used for the assessment of Δ l g C p , m o -values, which are described in details in our recent studies [20,21]. The simplest and straightforward method was developed by Chickos and Acree [22]. They suggested an empirical way to assess Δ l g C p , m o –values by equation: (2) - Δ l g C p , m o 298.15 K = 0.26 × C p , m o l iq , 298.15 + 10.58 where C p , m o (liq, 298.15 K)-data are of the experimental origin or they can be also estimated according to the group-additivity (GA) procedure [23]. The coefficients of Eq. (2) were derived from experimental data available for different classes of organic compounds and the Δ l g C p , m o – estimates according to Eq. (2) are claimed to be accurate within ± 16 J.K−1.mol−1 [24]. The compilation of available experimental standard molar heat capacities, C p,m o , for amino-alcohols, as well as the Δ l g C p,m o -differences estimated by Eq. (2) are given in Table 1 . The amount of experimental data on the heat capacities of amino-alcohols is limited to the data collected in the Table 1. In our recently published work [25] we have already slightly modified Chickos’s GA method for calculating the C p,m o ( l i q ) –values for the nitrogen containing compounds. The following contributions were re-calculated with help of the updated data base on N-containing aliphatic amines: the group parameter for the primary sp 3 nitrogen (–NH2 = 55.6 J.K−1.mol−1) and the group parameter for the secondary sp 3 nitrogen (>NH = 39.5 J.K−1.mol−1). All other Chickos’s parameters were not change. From the C p,m o ( l i q ) –data collected in Table 1, it can be seen that the values predicted with the modified parameters agree sufficiently with the available data for amino-alcohols with the primary and secondary sp 3 nitrogen. It has turned out, that for the amino-alcohols with the tertiary sp 3 nitrogen (>N–), the deviations were greater than uncertainties ascribed for this GA method. Hence, we used the experimental C p,m o ( l i q ) –values for 2-(dimethyl-amino)-ethanol and 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol listed in Table 1 and re-calculated in this work the group parameter for tertiary sp 3 nitrogen (>N–) to be 21.1 J.K−1.mol−1. The Δ l g C p,m o -differences estimated by Eq. (2) from the experimental or estimated C p,m o ( l i q ) –values are given in Table 1, column 4. These Δ l g C p,m o -values were used in Eq. (1) to fit vapour pressure temperature dependence. The primary experimental results for 1-amino-2-propanol and 3-amino-1-propanol from the transpiration method are summarized in Table 2 . The temperature dependence of vapour pressures for the 1-amino-2-propanol is presented in Fig. 3 . We found only one data set for comparison. This data set was derived from the Antoine equation coefficients, which are listed in a comprehensive compilation by Stephenson and Malanowski [36]. The agreement between two available data sets for 1-amino-2-propanol is poor. It should be noted, however, that this compilation [36] contains only empirical coefficients for each compound and that essential data on purities and methods are missing. For this reason, consent or disagreement with data from this compilation is always questionable. The vapour pressures available for the 3-amino-1-propanol are shown in Fig. 4 . The inconsistency of the experimental vapor pressures for 3-amino-1-propanol at higher than the transpiration range is evident from Figure 4. The reason for this scatter in the data is not clear. In any case, a correct comparison of the vapor pressures measured in this work with those in [38,39] is not possible, since they are measured in completely different ranges. Very limited data on vapour pressures that are generally available for the amino-alcohols has prompted us to involve experimental boiling temperatures at different pressures compiled by SciFinder [37]. The compilation of these data is given in Table S2. The accuracy of this data is questionable as they come from the distillation of a compound after its synthesis and not from special physico-chemical studies. However, the numerous data on boiling temperatures at standard pressure, as well as at reduced pressures provide at least a reliable level of the experimental vapour pressures and a reliable trend of the dependence of the vapour pressure temperature. The boiling points at different pressures for 3-amino-1-propanol compiled by SciFinder [37] are given in Fig. 4. The scatter of the collected points is large, but at least the lowest available points show the trend comparable to our transpiration results. Experimental vapour pressures measured in this work, have been used to obtain the enthalpies of vaporization of amino-alcohols using the following equation: (3) Δ l g H m o T = - b + Δ l g C p , m o × T Experimental vapour pressures temperature dependences were also used to derive the vaporization entropies at temperatures T by using the following equation: (4) Δ l g S m o T = Δ l g H m o / T + R × l n p i / p o with p o = 0.1 MPa. Coefficients a and b of Eq. (1), Δ l g H m o (T) and Δ l g S m o (T) values are collected in Table 2. The combined uncertainties of the vaporization enthalpies include uncertainties from the experimental conditions of transpiration, uncertainties in vapour pressure and uncertainties due to the temperature adjustment to T = 298.15 K as described elsewhere [34,35]. Experimental vapour pressures for 2-amino-ethanol, 2-(methyl-amino)-ethanol, 2-(dimethyl-amino)-ethanol, 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol, have been compiled from the literature, have been collected from the literature and used to obtain the enthalpies of vaporization of amino-alcohols using Eq. (3). The combined uncertainties of the derived vaporization enthalpies were re-calculated in the same way as for our own experimental results. The compilation of the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization of amino-alcohols is given in Table 3 . Experimental vapour pressures for 2-amino-ethanol, 2-(methyl-amino)-ethanol, 2-(dimethyl-amino)-ethanol, and 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol were reported and discussed in our earlier paper [11]. In the intervenient time some new results on these compounds have been published in the literature. We have carefully collected new vapour pressures and treated them using Eq. (2). The newly derived enthalpies of vaporization were compiled in Table 3 with those previously collected [11]. It turned out, that for each compound of interest the new Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values agree very well with those already evaluated in our previous publication (see Table 3). In order to gain more confidence, the weighted average value (the uncertainty was used as the weighing factor) for each compound has been calculated and highlighted in bold. This mean values, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), are now recommended for thermochemical calculations."
6,Combustion calorimetry: Standard molar enthalpies of formation.,"3.2 Combustion calorimetry: Standard molar enthalpies of formation. The combustion energies of six amino-alcohols were measured using high precision self-made combustion calorimeter. Specific energies of combustion, Δc u°, were measured in a series of five to six experiments for each compound. The results for all combustion experiments are given in Tables S3 to S8 in the electronic supporting materials. The standard molar enthalpies of combustion Δ c H m o (liq) and the standard molar enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (liq) of amino-alcohols were derived (see Table 4 ) from the specific energies of combustion. The combustion results for Δ c u° and Δ c H m o refer to the general reactions: (5) C 2 H 7 N O liq + 3.25 × O 2 g = 2 × C O 2 g + 3.5 × H 2 O liq + 0.5 × N 2 g (6) C 3 H 9 N O liq + 4.75 × O 2 g = 3 × C O 2 g + 4.5 × H 2 O liq + 0.5 × N 2 g (7) C 4 H 11 N O liq + 6.25 × O 2 g = 4 × C O 2 g + 5.5 × H 2 O liq + 0.5 × N 2 g (8) C 6 H 15 N O liq + 9.25 × O 2 g = 6 × C O 2 g + 7.5 × H 2 O liq + 0.5 × N 2 g We have used the conventional method [60] to reduce the combustion energies to the standard state. Auxiliary data required for the reduction of the combustion results are presented in Table S9. Uncertainties related to combustion experiments were calculated according to the guidelines developed by Olofsson [61]. The Δ f H m o (liq)-values were derived (see Table 4) applying the Hesśs Law to Eqs. (5–7) with the help of standard molar enthalpies of formation of H2O(liq) and CO2(g) recommended by CODATA [62]. The available combustion result for 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol [63] was re-calculated with the modern recommendations by CODATA. Moreover, by the re-calculations, we used the relative atomic masses of the elements C and H, which were taken as the mean values recommended by the IUPAC commission in 2013 for each of these elements [64]. Uncertainties of the combustion result reported by Lebedeva and Gutner [63] have been recalculated in this work according to the guidelines developed by Olofsson [61] by including the uncertainties from calibration, from the combustion energies of the auxiliary materials and uncertainties of the reaction products H2O and CO2. Compilation of available thermochemical data for amino-alcohols is given in Table 4. Except for 2-amino-ethanol and 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol, the combustion results for amino-alcohols presented in Table 4 are reported for the first time. The value Δ f H m o (liq) = -507.5 kJ·mol−1 for 2-amino-ethanol, which does not agree at all with our result, was found in the NIST Webbook [65] with reference to the US Naval Ordnance Systems report [66]. The details for experiments for this compound are absent and the reason for the disagreement is not obvious. The experimental details for combustion experiments with 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol are also very limited [63]. However, according to our experience with Lebedeva's experimental results, these are always of very high quality in terms of sample purification and the accuracy of the combustion calorimeter. Our new combustion result agrees with those of Lebedeva and Gutner [66] within the experimental uncertainties (see Table 4). The weighted average value Δ f H m o (liq) = -310.8 ± 1.2 kJ·mol−1 for 2-(diethyl-amino)-ethanol was calculated and recommended for thermochemical calculations."
7,Gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation: Experiment and theory,"3.3 Gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation: Experiment and theory Combustion calorimetry results (see Table 4, column 3) together with experimental results on vaporization enthalpy (see Table 3, column 5) were used to derive the experimental gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (g)exp (see Table 4, column 5) according to the common thermochemical equation: (9) Δ f H m o g , 298.15 K e x p = Δ l g H m o 298.15 K exp + Δ f H m o ( l i q , 298.15 K ) e x p It is already well-established, that the quantum chemical composite methods are nowadays a valuable tool for obtaining the theoretical Δ f H m o (g, 298.15)-values with a “chemical accuracy”. The latter is conventionally defined at the level of 4–5 kJ·mol−1 [67,68]. Since the available thermochemical data for amino-alcohols are limited, it is reasonable to use the quantum-chemical calculations to establish the consistency and to support the reliability of the results derived in this work. In this work, we used G3B3, G3MP2 and G4 methods to get the theoretical Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values of amino-alcohols for validation of our new experimental results. A correspondence between the theoretical and experimental Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values provides a valuable evidence of the data mutual consistency. The amino-alcohols are flexible aliphatic molecules. The high conformational flexibility of molecules with internal rotational degrees of freedom leads to the existence of a large number of low-energy conformers that must be taken into account. In general, the calculation of the energetics of all possible conformers is important for the exact calculation of theoretical Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values. The preliminary conformational analysis was carried out using the MMFF94 force field method [69]. We found several deep-lying conformers in all molecules. For example, there were at least 13 possible stable arrangements in 2-amino-ethanol, 19 in 2-(methyl-amino)-ethanol, and 13 arrangements in 2-(dimethyl-amino)-ethanol. Each of stable conformers found were calculated using the G3B3 method. Energies E 0 and enthalpies H 298 of each of the stable conformers found were calculated using the G3B3 method. The thermal population P i of the conformers at T = 298 K is given by a Boltzmann distribution of conformers: (10) P i = e - Δ G i RT 1 + ∑ i = 1 n e - Δ G i RT ; Δ G i = G i - G st where free energies of conformers G i are related to the appropriate most stable conformer G st . Results on P i were used for calculation of the energies and enthalpies of the equilibrium mixture of conformers at T = 298.15 K and finally applied for calculation Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values of amino-alcohols: (11) Δ f H m o ( g , 298.15 K ) = ∑ i p i Δ f H m o ( g , 298.15 K ) The enthalpy of formation of the equilibrium mixture of conformers, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) eq , calculated for each compound according to Eq.(11) using the atomization method for a selected set of molecules, are given in Table 5 (column 6). For comparison, the enthalpies of formation of the most stable conformer of each compound, Δ f H m o (g)MSC, are also given in Table 5 (column 5). To our surprise, the two values Δ f H m o (g) eq , and Δ f H m o (g)MSC generally do not differ too much for all of the flexible molecules listed in this table. Indeed, e.g. for 2-amino-ethanol with 13 relatively stable conformations, the conformational enthalpy contributions of other conformers that coexist at 298.15 K are all together only 2.9 kJ·mol−1 (see Table 5). And even for glycerol, which is present in the gas phase as an equilibrium mixture at least of 126 conformers [71], the contribution of the conformational enthalpy of 4.1 kJ·mol−1 (see Table 5) is surprisingly small and fair comparable with the “chemical accuracy” which is ascribed to the high-level composite methods. In this context, do we need the dimensionless computational effort in order to take into account all possible stable conformers? Maybe it is enough to just locate a limited group of 3–4 relatively stable conformers and use them for the time-consuming high-level calculations? The results of testing this suggestion are given in Table S10 and Table S11. For example, out of 13 stable conformations of 2-aminoethanol, we have selected only three that come closest to the most stable and calculated all three using the G3MP2 method. The comparison of the two values Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) eq = -203.5 kJ·mol−1 and Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)MSC = -204.1 kJ·mol−1 (see Table S10) shows that neglecting 10 other relatively stable conformations hardly contributes to the overall conformational enthalpy contribution. The same trend is also observed for 3-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, 5-amino-1-pentanol, and 6-amino-1-hexanol (see Table S10). For the branched amino-alcohols 1-amino-2-propanol, 1-amino-2-methyl-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, and 2-amino-1-butanol, the variety of conformations is expected to be more diverse compared to the species considered in Table S10. However, also in this case the values Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) eq and Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)MSC (see Table S11) are also very close and the differences are only at the level of −1.0 kJ·mol−1. According to our general experience, however, very often only a few most stable conformers contribute significantly to the theoretical enthalpy of formation, provided that the differences in their energies do not exceed them 1–3 kJ·mol−1. Conformers with the energy difference ≥ 10 kJ·mol−1 are practically not populated in the gas phase. Such a simplification can be used for large molecules with abundant flexibility with sufficient accuracy. For example, a theoretical value Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)MSC = -582.9 kJ·mol−1 for glycerol was calculated for a single most stable conformer by using the G4 method and the atomisation procedure [71]. The latter value is already in very good agreement with the recommended experimental result Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)exp = -578.8 ± 0.6 kJ·mol−1 [71]. The agreement theory with experiment is fair, but it is expected that the extended conformational analysis with a reasonable amount of other possible conformers, will make the theoretical value 3–4 kJ·mol−1 less negative and approach the experimental value. Indeed, the value Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) eq = -578.8 kJ·mol−1 (see Table 5) estimated by Dorofeeva and Suchkova [70] fully meets this expectation. Therefore, limiting the conformational analysis to the set of 3–4 most stable conformers has significantly reduced the computational effort within this study. After the preliminary conformational analysis with the MMFF94, a few conformers with energy differences that do not exceed 3–4 kJ·mol−1 could be selected and energies E 0 and enthalpies H 298 calculated with any high-level quantum-chemical method (G3B3, G3MP2, and G4 in this work). For the sake of brevity, only the most stable conformers of amino-alcohols are shown in Tables S12-S13. Details on computational procedure were reported elsewhere [72]. We used the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approach embedded in the Gaussian 09. The H 298–values were converted to the theoretical gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation with help of the standard atomization (AT) reactions as well as using the bond separation (BS) reactions [73]. It is well-established that the enthalpies of formation derived from the atomization reaction sometimes systematically deviate from the experimental values [74]. However, simple linear correlations between the AT-calculated and the experimental enthalpies of formation help to “correct” the results and to obtain reliable theoretical values. It has turned out that the linear correlations are individual for each composite method (in kJ.mol−1): (12) Δ f H m o g t h e o r = 0.9895 × Δ f H m o g , A T - 2.0 w i t h R 2 = 0.9997 f o r G 3 B 3 (13) Δ f H m o g t h e o r = 0.9991 × Δ f H m o g , A T - 3.4 w i t h R 2 = 0.9998 f o r G 3 M P 2 (14) Δ f H m o g t h e o r = 1.0050 × Δ f H m o ( g , A T ) + 0.1 w i t h R 2 = 0.9998 f o r G 4 Experimental and quantum-chemical enthalpies of formation used to establish these correlations are given in Tables S14-S16. Using these correlations, the “corrected” enthalpies of formation of amino-alcohols have been calculated (see Tables S17-S19). The final results of quantum chemical calculations are summarized in Table 6 . To construct the “bond separation reactions” (see Table S20) we used auxiliary molecules with reliable experimental gas-phase enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) from Table S21. The overall results of the G3B3 calculations for a representative set of amino alcohols are given in Table S20 and summarized in Table 6. As can be seen from this table, the “corrected” atomization G3B3, G3MP2 and G4 gas-phase-enthalpies of formation of amino-alcohols are in very close agreement. Also the theoretical BS enthalpies of formation can be hardly distinguished from the AT-results. Therefore, we calculated the weighted average value for each compound in Table 6 and designated it as the theoretical values, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)theor, for comparison with the experimental values, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)exp, compiled in Table 4. Comparison of column 5 with column 6 in Table 4 shows good agreement between the theoretical and experimental Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values for each amino-alcohol. This good agreement can be considered as proof of the internal consistency of the thermochemical results evaluated in this work (see Table 4). These results can now be recommended as reliable benchmark properties for further thermochemical calculations of practically important hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions as shown in Section 3.4 below."
8,"Energetics of reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol to produce piperazine-2,5-dione","3.4 Energetics of reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol to produce piperazine-2,5-dione The promising sustainable reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol to produce piperazine-2,5-dione is given in Fig. 1. The LOHC system is based on the inexpensive, abundant 2-aminoethanol, which is catalytically converted to a cyclic dipeptide using a ruthenium pincer catalyst [3]. The reverse reaction of peptide hydrogenation on the same catalyst regenerates 2-aminoethanol. In this reversible reaction, one molecule of 2-amino-ethanol releases two molecules of hydrogen. The theoretical DFT calculations show that conversion of 2-amino-ethanol to piperazine-2,5-dione is thermodynamically favorable processes with the Gibbs free energy of reaction, Δ r G m o (g, 298.15 K) = -25.4 kJ·mol−1 [3]. Such a large negative Δ r G m o -value promises the high yield for the reaction indicated in Fig. 1. This theoretical finding agrees with the experiment. The conversion achieved up to 86% for the dehydrogenation step and the conversion achieved up to 97% for the hydrogenation step make the reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol very promising for further optimization and development. Since the amino-alcohols have been proven as potential LOHC, reliable data on hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions are essential for heat management and safety in practical applications. The enthalpy of the 2-amino-ethanol reversible dehydrogenation reactions was calculated according to the Hesśs Law with help of standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K), of 2-amino-ethanol (see Table 4) and the liquid-phase enthalpy of formation of piperazine-2,5-dione (see Table S22): (15) Δ r H m o = ( - 437.0 ± 4.9 ) - 2 × ( - 266.9 ± 1.3 ) = ( 96.8 ± 5.2 ) / 4 = 24.2 / k J · m o l - 1 / H 2 Admittedly, the lower reaction enthalpies are preferred for the release of hydrogen from LOHC. To our surprise, the value of the reaction enthalpy (per mole of hydrogen) derived in Eq. (15) is significantly lower compared to those known for the conventional LOHC. For example, the dehydrogenation enthalpy, Δ r H m o = 65.4 kJ·mol−1/H2, is known for biphenyl [1], or the following values were reported for benzyltoluenes (63.5 kJ·mol−1/H2) and for dibenzyltoluenes (65.4 kJ·mol−1/H2) [75]. Even the enthalpy of dehydrogenation of N-ethyl-carbazole (50.5 kJ·mol−1/H2) [76,77] is twice higher. The low enthalpy of the 2-amino-ethanol dehydrogenation reaction together with the large negative Δ r G m o -value can be viewed as a prerequisite for optimizing this LOHC system for industrial application on a large scale."
9,Conclusions,"The consistent sets of standard molar enthalpies of vaporization and standard molar enthalpies of formation for amino-alcohols were measured in this work. The sets of own and available in the literature thermodynamic properties were compared and evaluated. The theoretical enthalpies of formation of amino-alcohols in the gas phase were calculated by quantum chemical methods using the G3B3, G3MP2 and G4 methods. A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical enthalpies of formation has confirmed the mutual consistency of the results derived in this work. The reliable thermodynamic properties of amino-alcohols were recommended for the thermochemical calculations and used to calculate the reaction enthalpy of sustainable reversible dehydrogenation of 2-amino-ethanol. The surprisingly low enthalpy of this reaction makes this liquid organic hydrogen carrier system promising for further optimization and development."
