0,Introduction,"Anaerobic hydrogen production from organic wastes is reported to be an efficient process that has potential to be an economical and sustainable way for renewable hydrogen production [1–3]. It has been found that pretreatment of the inoculum is very important to inhibit methanogens and enrich hydrogen producers for higher hydrogen production, and most studies have evaluated inocula with different pretreatments on hydrogen production under batch mode [4]. However, our previous study found that inoculum with and without pretreatments did not show any differences in thermophilic continuous hydrogen production from cassava stillage [5]. Whether the above result is applicable to hydrogen production from cassava stillage at mesophilic temperature still needs further investigation. Contrary results on hydrogen production under different temperatures have been reported recently. Lee et al. [6] noticed that mesophilic condition (37 °C) was preferable for hydrogen production from cassava starch compared to thermophilic condition (55 °C) with hydrogen production potentials of 1447 ml and 241 ml, respectively, while other studies reported that thermophilic condition was more favorable [7,8]. The comparison of continuous hydrogen production under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions is important to clearly understand the different mechanisms involved. After hydrogen production, the effluent contains high content of organic acids. Anaerobic digestion for methane production is an ideal way to utilize metabolites (volatile fatty acids (VFA), and alcohols) from hydrogen production process for additional energy production. Currently, cogeneration of hydrogen and methane in two phase anaerobic process have been reported using food waste or pure substrate like glucose as substrate [2,9,10]. The two-phase process separates and enriches acidogens and methanogens in different reactors that may improve the process stability and efficiency compared to traditional one-phase methane production process. Although hydrogen and methane production from waste under lower OLR (between 2 and 5 gCOD/(L·d)) has been reported [2,11], performance of the two-phase process under higher OLR was seldom investigated. Moreover, there are few reports on the comparison of performances of two-phase (hydrogen and methane) and one-phase (methane) CSTR under higher OLR (>10 gVS/(L·d)). Investigation on the process performance of two-phase CSTR under higher OLR may accelerate its application. The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the impacts of pretreatment and temperature on continuous hydrogen production firstly. And then the performances of two-phase and one-phase CSTR under higher OLR (>10 gVS/(L·d)) were compared and discussed. Cassava stillage, a kind of high concentration organic wastewater from an ethanol plant, was used as the substrate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feed stock and inoculum,"2.1 Feed stock and inoculum Cassava stillage used in this study was collected from cassava ethanol plant,in Jiangsu province. Two batches of cassava stillage taken at different sampling time were used as feedstocks. The first batch (pH 4.1, TS 47.4 g/L, VS 40 g/L, TCOD 48 g/L, SCOD 22 g/L, soluble carbohydrate 7.5 g/L, total carbohydrate 26.9 g/L, acetate 200 mg/L) was used for the temperature and pretreatment experiments and the second batch (pH 4.0, TS 62.2 g/L, VS 53 g/L, TCOD 65 g/L, SCOD 25.6 g/L, soluble carbohydrate 8.3 g/L, total carbohydrate 29.5 g/L, acetate 169 mg/L) was used for the two-phase (hydrogen and methane) and one-phase (methane) fermentation. After sampled, the cassava stillage was stored at 4 °C before usage. The seed sludge for hydrogen reactor was anaerobic sludge (pH 7.5, TS 70 g/L, VS 42 g/L) from UASB reactor. To accelerate the start-up of methane reactors, thermophilic digested cassava stillage (pH 7.8, TS 25.3 g/L, VS 14.9 g/L) from CSTR in the same plant was used as seed sludge."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up Three 250 ml identical bottles (R1, R2, R3) were used for hydrogen production with working volume 200 ml. R1 and R2 were operated under mesophilic condition (37 °C) while R3 was operated under thermophilic condition (60 °C). Heat pretreatment is the most widely used method for hydrogen producing bacteria enrichment [4]. Therefore, R1 was seeded with raw sludge while the seed sludge for R2 was heat-pretreated at 90 °C for 1h. R3 was also seeded with raw sludge according to the results of previous study [12]. Before continuous experiment, a batch operation was carried out for each reactor. The seed sludge of 40 ml and raw cassava stillage 140 ml were added to each reactor. The working volume was adjusted to 200 ml using distilled water. The reactors were then put in water bath shakers (37 °C and 60 °C, respectively) and rotated at 150 rpm. After the hydrogen production ceased, the reactors were converted to semi-continuous mode and operated as continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with HRT 1 d. Half of the mixtures in the bottles were removed and fresh cassava stillage were added at every 12 h. Sodium bicarbonate (5 g/L) was added to raw cassava stillage to maintain the suitable pH for hydrogen production. According to the results obtained from the above experiments, the two-phase and one-phase CSTR were operated under thermophilic condition. R3 was still used for hydrogen production and the effluent was fed to the subsequent methane reactor (R4, total volume 1.5 L with working volume 800 ml, 55 °C, HRT 4 d). One-phase fermentation was carried out in reactor R5 with raw cassava stillage as substrate (total volume 1.5 L with working volume 1000 ml, 55 °C, HRT 5 d). Thus the two-phase and one-phase CSTR had the same HRT. The alkalinity of cassava stillage for R5 was also the same as that for two-phase process. Initially, the two methane reactors were filled up with inoculum. After two days’ acclimation, R4 and R5 were fed at every 12 h with corresponding substrates. In this experiment, the second batch cassava stillage was used and the OLR was about 10.6 gVS/(L·d). The biogas produced from all the reactors was collected by gas bags. The amount of biogas was determined by 100 ml glass syringe and the composition of the biogas was also measured. The effluent pH of each reactor was measured daily. The steady-state in this study was defined as a sustained biogas production within ±10% deviation, and in this period the average values of parameters (pH, VFA, hydrogen production, methane production et al.) for six consecutive days were reported. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 level was used to analyze the data."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The collected samples from each reactor were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, and filtrated through 0.45 μm filters to determine soluble components. Total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS), Total and soluble COD (TCOD and SCOD), were analyzed in duplicate in accordance with Standard APHA Methods [13]. Total and soluble carbohydrates were determined using phenol–sulfuric acid method [14]. The concentrations of ethanol and VFA (C2–C5), and biogas composition were determined by gas chromatograph and detailed information could be found in Ref. [15]. The measured biogas volume was adjusted to volume at STP (standard temperature 0 °C and pressure 1 atm). The acetate produced by homoacetogens was estimated based on the study of Arooj et al. [16]. The VFA and ethanol concentrations in the reactors reported here have subtracted the initial concentrations in raw cassava stillage."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of pretreatment and temperature on continuous hydrogen production,"3.1 Effects of pretreatment and temperature on continuous hydrogen production As presented in Table 1 , similar hydrogen yields were obtained in R1 and R2 under mesophilic condition (p > 0.05) and methane was not detected in both hydrogen reactors. Moreover, the distributions of VFA/ethanol in R1 and R2 were similar with butyrate, acetate and propionate as the dominant metabolic species, which was corresponded with the similar hydrogen yields. Previous study contributed the importance of heat-pretreatment of inoculum to the inhibition of homoacetogens under mesophilic condition [17]. However, in this study the calculated acetate produced from homoacetogens did not present any significant difference (p > 0.05) in R1 and R2 (as shown in Table 1), indicating that heat-pretreatment had no effect on the homoacetogens in the continuous experiments. Oh and his co-workers [18] also noticed that heat-pretreatment could not inhibit homoacetogens but was essential to eliminate methanogens to enhance the hydrogen production in batch study. The absence of methane in R1 inoculated with raw sludge might be due to the lower HRT (higher OLR) and lower pH, which were enough to inhibit the methanogens [2,19]. Thus, mesophilic hydrogen production from cassava stillage was not affected by heat-pretreatment of inoculum in continuous experiment. Fermentation temperature played an important role in hydrogen production process and hydrogen yield at mesophilic and thermophilic temperature was compared in this study. The hydrogen yield (69.6 ml H2/gVS) in R3 was significantly higher than that in R1 and R2 (p < 0.05). The total concentration of VFA/ethanol was about 6900 mg/L in R3, similar with the value of 7400 mg/L in both R1 and R2 (p > 0.05). However, the distribution of VFA was quite different. Butyrate was the main metabolite under thermophilic condition which was significantly higher than that under mesophilic condition (p < 0.05). The propionate concentration at mesophilic temperature was about 5 times higher than that at thermophilic temperature. Propionate is not suitable for hydrogen production because it could consume hydrogen (as presented in equation (3)). Moreover, the acetate concentration under mesophilic condition was also significantly higher (p < 0.05). Such higher acetate concentration might be generated by homoacetogens through hydrogen consumption [18]. As shown in Table 1, the acetate produced by homoacetogens under mesophilic condition was significantly higher than that under thermophilic condition (p < 0.05). The present study demonstrated that continuous hydrogen production from cassava stillage depended on the cultivation condition instead of inoculum pretreatment.

7,Hydrogen and methane production and comparison with one-phase fermentation system,"3.2 Hydrogen and methane production and comparison with one-phase fermentation system To further utilize the residual organic acids, the effluent of R3 was fed into R4 for continuous methane production. Fig. 1 describes profiles of methane production, pH and VFA/ethanol content with operation time. pH could be maintained above 7.0 in the methane reactor (R4). After one day acclimation, methane production increased and reached steady-state fast. The methane yield was 249 mlCH4/g VS with VS removal efficiency of 44%. Most organics was degraded and removed in the methane reactor compared to the VS removal efficiency of 17% in hydrogen reactor. The methane yield was comparable with the methane yield 192 mlCH4/gVS from potato waste [3], but lower than 500 mlCH4/gVS from household solid waste [2]. The VFA concentration also decreased from 6744 mg/L in hydrogen reactor to 2171 mg/L in the subsequent methane reactor. Obviously, VFA was not completely utilized and the residual dominant composition was propinate (about 2000 mg/L). After day 17, the two-phase CSTR was operated for another one month and similar performance was observed with hydrogen and methane yield of 56.6 mlH2/g VS and 249 mlCH4/g VS. However, the performance of one-phase CSTR (R5) was unstable. As shown in Fig. 2 , methane production fluctuated with operation time and the production rate was only about half of that in R4. Accompanied with the decrease of pH from 6.5 to 5.5, methane production continuously decreased and ceased on day 14. Hydrogen production was observed thereafter. The distribution of VFA in R5 was found to be different with that in R4. The total concentration of dominant species of acetate and propionate increased gradually to nearly 8000 mg/L on day 12. Accompanied with the decrease of pH to 5.5 and hydrogen production, butyrate became the main metabolite. The organics in hydrogen reactor could be effectively converted to methane in the subsequent methane reactor. Biogas production in the two-phase CSTR process was relatively more stable than that in the one-phase CSTR at the OLR of 10.6 gVS/(L·d) (or 13 gCOD/(L·d)). Moreover, TCOD and VS removal efficiency in the two-phase CSTR process could be 58% and 61%, respectively. The values were comparable with the study of Zhu et al. [3], who found that 64% of TCOD and 70% of VS removal from potato wastes was obtained in the two-phase process, while relatively low OLR (2.57 gVS/(L·d)) was applied in their study. The hydrogen yield in the two-phase process was 56.6 ml H2/gVS. It was higher than 43 ml H2/gVS from household solid waste in the study of Liu et al. [2], but lower than 80.9 ml H2/gVS from food wastes in the study of Kim et al. [1]. The different characteristics of the wastes might be one reason for the different hydrogen yields. It should be noticed that the addition of NaHCO3 to the influent is necessary which could maintain the suitable pH (around 5.5) in the hydrogen reactor. From economical view point, cheaper chemicals like CaCO3 should be used and also the effluent (with neutral pH) of methane reactor could be recycled to hydrogen reactor to reduce the addition of such chemicals. For two-phase process, the effluent contained high content of propionate while the other VFA were very low. The propionate concentration in this study was about 2000 mg/L and it did not affect the process performance as reflected by the higher methane yield and stable pH even after long term operation. The results were contrary to the study of Barredo and Evison [20], who predicted that the propionate concentration between 1500 and 2220 mg/L would result in the inhibition of methanogens and further lead to the failure of the reactor. Our results suggested that the failure of anaerobic process was not so dependent only on higher propionate concentration. In the study of Wiegant et al. [21], higher propionate concentration (2000–6000 mg/L) under thermophilic condition was also found, but the anaerobic process was still stable and the effluent quality did not deteriorate with increasing loading rates from 17 to 98 kgCOD/m3.d in UASB. Our further study noticed that propionate decreased to below 200 mg/L if the HRT of R5 increased from 4 d to 10 d (data not shown), indicating that propionate could be controlled if the OLR is lowered. In one-phase process, when acetate was also accumulated, the breakdown of system occurred. The higher concentration of acetate probably indicated the imbalance of methanogens and acidogens. The accumulation of both acetate and propionate might be an important parameter for indication of the process imbalance."
8,Conclusion,"Heat-pretreatment of inoculum was not necessary and could not improve the hydrogen production from cassava stillage under mesophilic condition in continuous experiment. Moreover, inhibition of homoacetogens by the heat-pretreatment of inoculum was not observed. Fermentation under thermophilic condition enhanced hydrogen yield from about 14 ml H2/gVS to 69.6 ml H2/gVS due to the lower propionate production and lower activity of homoacetogens. Under OLR > 10 gVS/(L·d), two-phase thermophilic CSTR for hydrogen and methane production was stable with hydrogen and methane yield of 56.6 mlH2/g VS and 249 mlCH4/g VS respectively. The one-phase thermophilic CSTR for methane production failed due to the accumulation of high concentration of acetate and propionate. The accumulation of both acetate and propionate instead of propionate alone was probably related to the breakdown of anaerobic methane process."
