0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an important biocompatible synthetic polymer that can be synthesized by hydrolyzing polyvinyl acetate, a polymer that does not require extraction from petroleum (Thomas et al., 2018). PVA exhibits high hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding characteristics due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in each repeating unit (Zhang et al., 2019). PVA is also a hydrophilic polymer that has the advantage of biodegradable, non-toxic, biocompatible and water soluble (Youssef et al., 2019). PVA not only exhibits outstanding mechanical properties such as strong adhesion and wear resistance, but also has good resistance to organic solvents and vapours. PVA has been widely used in the textile, food, agriculture, pharmaceutical, construction, papermaking and other industries. PVA applications include but are not limited to: adhesives (Kaboorani et al., 2012), textile coatings (Musetti et al., 2014), drug delivery systems (Kenawy et al., 2007), orthopedic medicine (Baker et al., 2012), interventional radiology embolization particles (Lehmann et al., 2015), contact lenses (Hyon et al., 1994), and fibrous meshes and membranes for wound dressings (Hong, 2007). China’s PVA production capacity ranks first in the world, exceeding 1.7 million tons per year. With the continuous expansion of PVA production capacity and application fields, the industrial requirements for PVA particle are also increasing (Reddy et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2019). The commercial value of PVA is related to its particle size, and the added value of small PVA particles is significantly higher than that of large particles. In the PVA production process, it is necessary to pulverize bulk PVA into PVA particles, but the pulverized particles are highly heterogeneous. Large PVA particles cannot be dissolved in cold water, and hot water is required to dissolve them, resulting in high energy consumption and complicated operation. Therefore, it is necessary to separate small PVA particles to satisfy product requirements, and the large PVA particles that do not satisfy the requirements are returned to the pulverizing system for re-pulverization. In the 160,000 tons per year PVA production unit at SINOPEC Chongqing Sichuan Vinylon Works (SVW) Chemical CO., LTD, pulverized PVA particles are sieved by rocking sieves to obtain qualified PVA products with a particle size of less than 120 μm. The problem in industrial operation is that rocking sieves have only 40%–50% classification efficiency, which means that only 40%–50% of PVA particles with a particle size of less than 120 μm are classified out as products. These qualified PVA products that have not been classified out are returned to the pulverizing system for re-pulverization, resulting in large energy consumption by the pulverizing system. Furthermore, because PVA particles easily block rocking sieves, the rocking sieves need frequent cleaning, which affects the long-term continuous operation and cleaner production of the device, and requires considerable human effort and material consumption. Moreover, the cleaning process requires hot water, and hot water is a natural enemy of PVA products, easily causing PVA products to fail or even dissolve into aggregates. Therefore, PVA classification has become one of the most important challenges in the entire industry. The particle classification methods mainly include wet methods and dry methods (Fu et al., 2016; Konrath et al., 2015). Since PVA dissolves when it is in contact with water, wet classification methods are not suitable. In addition to rocking sieves, the commonly used dry classification methods mainly include air classification (Cazacliu et al., 2014), electric classification (Lanzerstorfer, 2018), and magnetic classification (Habib, 2019). The energy consumption of electrical classification is very high and there is a high voltage safety risk (Shirasawa et al., 2017). Magnetic classification is based on differing metal depositions on the particles (Lim et al., 2014). However, PVA particles have neither electrical properties nor magnetic properties, so neither electrical classification nor magnetic classification can be used in PVA particle classification. Air classification has been used in many industrial fields due to its low cost, ease of operation, low energy consumption and environmental friendliness (Petit et al., 2018). But due to the presence of airflow turbulence, the efficiency of traditional air classification for low density difference or low size difference particles that with close settling velocity in air is not high. Gas flow acceleration classification, also named pulsing air classification, which is optimized on the basis of traditional air classifications (Fu et al., 2019). In contrast to traditional air classification, gas flow acceleration classification mainly utilizes the different accelerations of the particles in a pulsing gas flow field rather than the final settling velocity (Duan et al., 2009). The first report of gas flow acceleration classification has been around for more than 30 years (Jackson et al., 1988), but there are few reports in the literature. Duan et al. used pulsing air classification for separation of different density components in electronic scrap (Duan et al., 2005). Stessel et al. studied the separation of solid waste with pulsed airflow, three different types of classifier were compared (Stessel and Peirce, 1985). Zhang et al. using a pulsing air classifier is applied to decrease the ash content of lignite for improving its effective utilization (Zhang et al., 2018). Fu et al. studied the application of gas flow acceleration classification in the classification of catalyst activity (Fu et al., 2018). So far, the application fields of gas flow acceleration classification were limited to solid waste, vermiculite, fine coal, and electronic waste, especially lacking large-scale industrial applications. In this study, gas flow acceleration classification method was first used to classify PVA products to achieve energy saving and cleaner production in the PVA production process. We expect to obtain the movements of differently sized PVA particles in the gas flow acceleration classifier, the efficiencies of one-stage and two-stage gas flow acceleration classification, and the proportion of fibrous particles through this study. And replace rocking sieve by gas flow acceleration classifier to solve the problem of low efficiency, easy to be blocked, and need frequent water cleaning of the rocking sieve, thereby reducing the energy consumption of the system and achieving cleaner production."
1,Technical principle of PVA gas flow acceleration classification,"Fig. 1 shows the technical principle of PVA gas flow acceleration classification; the structure of the gas flow acceleration classifier is similar to that of a traditional air classifier. The key to this technology is that a sinusoidal pulsing gas flow is produced by a pulsing gas flow generator in a vertical classification column and PVA particles are periodically accelerated and decelerated. Due to the presence of sinusoidal pulsing gas flow, PVA particles are effected not only by the gravity force F g and drag force F d , but also by an acceleration force F a : (1) F g = 1 6 π d p 3 ρ p g (2) F d = C D ρ ( v p − v ) 2 2 × π d p 2 4 , C D = 24 R e + 6 1 + R e + 0.4 , R e = ρ ( v p − v ) d p μ (3) F a = − 1 2 m d f ( d v p d t − d v d t ) = − 1 12 π d p 3 ρ ( d v p d t − d v d t ) where d p refers to the PVA particle diameter, m; ρ p refers to the PVA particle density, kg/m3; g refers to the gravitational acceleration, m/s2; C D refers to the drag coefficient; ρ refers to the gas density respectively, kg/m3; v p refers to the PVA particle velocity, m/s; v refers to the gas velocity, m/s; m df refers to the gas mass displaced by the PVA particles, kg; and μ refers to the gas viscosity, pa·s. According to the main forces acting on the PVA particle, the equation for PVA particle movement in the gas flow acceleration classifier can be obtained: (4) d v P d t = 2 2 ρ P + ρ × { − ρ P g + 3 ρ ( v − v P ) 2 4 d p ⋅ [ 24 μ ρ d p ( v − v P ) + 6 1 + ρ d p ( v − v P ) μ + 0.4 ] + ρ 2 ⋅ ∂ v ∂ t } It can be seen from Eq. (4) that PVA with different diameter will exhibit different accelerations, velocities (v p ) and displacements (S). Through the particle dynamics equation, we can calculate the acceleration, velocity and displacement of PVA particles with different particle sizes, and the typical velocities and displacements of small PVA particles and large PVA particles are shown in the illustration in Fig. 1. The upward velocity of small PVA particles is always larger than that of large PVA particles. Both large and small PVA particles move up and down, but the displacement of small PVA particles moving upward is always larger than that moving downward, so the total displacement of small PVA particles is upward and move towards the top outlet; conversely, the total displacement of large PVA particles is downward and move towards the bottom outlet, thereby achieving efficient classification of different sized PVA particles."
2,Materials and methods,
3,Experimental setup and process,"3.1 Experimental setup and process A flow diagram, three-dimensional diagram and device photograph of the PVA classification system are shown in Fig. 2 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The gas used in this study was air, and the sinusoidal pulsing gas flow was produced by a pulsing gas flow generator; the pulsing frequency was set to 1.5 Hz. After pulverization, PVA particles were added into the gas flow accelerated classifier through a screw feeder and the sinusoidal pulsing gas flow. The large PVA particles were directly discharged from the bottom outlet; the small PVA particles moved towards to the top outlet with gas flow and separated by a cyclone. The cut size of small PVA particles and large PVA particles can be controlled by adjusting the sinusoidal pulsing gas velocity. The diameter and total height of the gas flow acceleration classifier were 100 mm and 1950 mm, respectively, and the cyclone body diameter was 150 mm. The gas flow acceleration classifier was made of organic glass to facilitate the measurement of particle movement."
4,Analytical and calculation methods,"3.2 Analytical and calculation methods The morphology of the PVA particles was measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEINOVA NanoSEM 450). Due to the influence of particle shape, there are result differences in the particle size distributions of PVA measured by different particle size test methods (Bartley et al., 2019; Yang and Fang, 2019). In this study, the PVA size distribution was measured by two methods: the laser scattering method and the standard sieving method. The laser scattering method was carried out by a Malvern (MS, 2000) laser size analyzer. The standard sieving method was carried out by a using standard sieves (DH-300T, Xinxiang City Dahan Vibration Machinery CO., LTD, China) with mesh sizes of 120 μm, 150 μm, 180 μm, 250 μm and 380 μm. Since the laser scattering method measures the equivalent particle size of particles, and the sieving method measures the particle size of the smallest part of the particles, consequently, the particle size measured by laser scattering is usually smaller than that measured by standard sieving (Gil et al., 2014)."
5,Experimental materials,"3.3 Experimental materials The pulverized PVA particles were from the 160,000 tons per year PVA production unit at SINOPEC Chongqing SVW Chemical CO., LTD. Only those PVA particles with a particle size of less than 120 μm can be defined as qualified PVA products. Therefore, the purpose of PVA classification is to select PVA particles with a particle size of less than 120 μm from the crushed particles. PVA particles are irregularly shaped white particles, and a photograph and SEM image of the PVA particles are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. The SEM image indicates that most of the PVA particles are granular, but there is also a small amount of fibrous PVA (indicated in red in Fig. 3(b)). This fibrous part of PVA is easily soluble in water due to its slender structure, so it is a qualified PVA product, but fibrous particles are difficult selecte by rocking sieve and can only be circulated in the pulverizing system. This is also one of the reasons why industrial rocking sieves are not efficient at PVA classification. The particle size distribution measured by the laser scattering method is shown in Fig. 3(c), and the mean diameter was 291 μm. We also measured the mass percentage of PVA particles with different diameter intervals by a standard sieve, as shown in Table 1 . The qualified PVA products with a particle size of less than 120 μm accounted for 30.9% of the total mass. Comparison of Table 1 and Fig. 3(c) shows that the particle size measured by the laser scattering method was smaller than that measured by the sieving method."
6,Results and discussion,
7,High-speed camera measurement of the movement of differently sized PVA particles,"4.1 High-speed camera measurement of the movement of differently sized PVA particles In our previous studies, we obtained the motion law of particles in a gas flow acceleration classifier through theoretical analysis and calculation (Fu et al., 2018, 2019). In this study, we further used a self-designed high-speed camera system to directly measure the movement of differently sized PVA particles in a gas flow acceleration classifier. The test system was shown in Fig. 4 (a). The maximum shooting speed of high-speed digital cameras (FASTCAM SA-X2, Photron, Japan) was 216000 frames per second (fps), and the maximum image pixel size was 1024 × 1024. In this study, since PVA particles are not easily captured by high speed camera systems, we used two kinds of tracer particles that are similar in physical properties to PVA particles to represent small PVA particles and large particles. Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d) show the movement of upward-moving particles, downward-moving particles, and particles that move upward and then downward, respectively. Fig. 4(e) and (f) show the velocity (v p ) and displacement (s p ) of small and large PVA particles measured by the high-speed camera system; as we analyzed in Section 2.1, the upward velocity of small PVA particles was always larger than that of large PVA particles, and the displacement of small PVA particles moving upward is always larger than that moving downward, so the total displacement of small PVA particles is upward; conversely, the total displacement of large PVA particles is downward. The displacement difference between large PVA particles and small PVA particles increases in each cycle, thereby achieving efficient classification of different sized PVA particles. The regular particle movement measured by the high-speed camera system was consistent with the theoretical analysis and calculations calculated through the particle dynamics equation (Eq. (4))."
8,One-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA,"4.2 One-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA First, we studied the classification efficiency of PVA particles by one-stage gas flow acceleration classification. The initial gas flow rate of pulsing gas flow (Q) was set to 20 m3/h, 30 m3/h and 40 m3/h to study the classification efficiency of PVA particles under different initial gas flow rates. Fig. 5 (a), (b) and (c) show low-magnification SEM images of the top outlet PVA particles, inlet PVA particles and bottom outlet PVA particles, respectively, at an initial gas flow rate of 30 m3/h. The top outlet PVA particles after classification were significantly smaller than the inlet PVA particles, and the bottom outlet PVA particles were significantly larger than the inlet PVA particles. The same conclusion can be obtained according to the high-magnification SEM images shown in Fig. 5(d), (e) and (f). Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the particle size probability distribution and cumulative distribution of PVA particles after classification, respectively, at an initial gas flow rate of 20 m3/h; the mean diameter of the inlet PVA particles, top outlet PVA particles and bottom outlet PVA particles was 291 μm, 157 μm, and 363 μm, respectively. It can be seen from the width of the probability distribution curve shown in Fig. 6(a) and the slope of the cumulative distribution curve shown in Fig. 6(b) that the particle size distributions of the top outlet and bottom outlet after classification were more concentrated than that of the inlet. These results indicate that the PVA particles after classification had better monodispersity. Fig. 6(c), (d), (e) and (f) show the particle size probability distribution and cumulative distribution of PVA particles after classification at an initial gas flow rate of 30 m3/h and 40 m3/h. When the initial gas flow rate was 30 m3/h, the mean diameter of the inlet PVA particles, top outlet PVA particles and bottom outlet PVA particles was 291 μm, 173 μm, and 434 μm, respectively. When the initial gas flow rate was 40 m3/h, the corresponding values were 291 μm, 237 μm, and 450 μm, respectively. Comparisons of the particle size distributions at the outlet at flow rates of 20, 30 and 40 m3/h show that the larger the gas flow rate was, the larger the particle size of the top outlet particles and the larger the particle size of the bottom outlet particles, as shown in Fig. A1. Furthermore, we analyzed the particle size distribution of the PVA particles at the gas flow acceleration classifier outlets by the standard sieve method. Fig. 7 (a), (b) and (c) show the particle mass distribution of differently sized PVA particles after classification (measured by the standard sieve) at an inlet flow rates of 20 m3/h, 30 m3/h and 40 m3/h, respectively. Small PVA particles accounted for most of the mass percentage of the top outlet particles, and large particles accounted for most of the mass percentage of the bottom outlet particles. The top outlet contained almost no PVA particles with a particle size of greater than 180 μm, and the bottom outlet contained almost no PVA particles with a particle size of less than 150 μm. The results directly indicate that the gas flow acceleration classification method had a good effect on PVA particles. Fig. A2 and Table A1 show comparisons of the mass distribution of differently sized PVA particles after classification under different inlet flow rates. It can be seen from Fig. 7 and Table A1 that the lower the inlet flow rate was, the higher the mass percentage of small PVA particles at the top outlet. Therefore, in industrial applications, a small inlet flow rate should be selected according to the particle size distribution of the PVA particles to achieve classification efficiency and ensure the purity of the PVA product after classification."
9,Two-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA,"4.3 Two-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA To further improve the classification efficiency of PVA, we studied the two-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA based on the one-stage approach. The first stage of classification was still the same; we carried out a second stage of classification on the top outlet PVA particles obtained from the first stage of classification. The initial gas flow rate in the first stage was 30 m3/h, and the initial gas flow rate in the second stage was 20 m3/h. Fig. 8 shows the particle size distributions of PVA particles after two-stage classification (measured by the laser scattering method). The mean diameter of the PVA particles at the inlet, top outlet of the first stage, bottom outlet of the first stage, top outlet of the second stage and bottom outlet of the second stage was 291 μm, 173 μm, 434 μm, 141 μm and 292 μm, respectively. The mean diameter of the PVA particles at the top outlet of the second stage was significantly smaller than that of the PVA particles at the top outlet of the first stage, which means that a second stage of classification can further reduce the size of the classified PVA particles. Although the mean diameter of PVA particles at the bottom outlet of the second stage was similar to that of the inlet PVA particles, the width of the probability distribution curve of the PVA particles at the bottom outlet was significantly narrower than that of the inlet PVA particles, and the slope of the cumulative distribution curve of the PVA particles at the bottom outlet was significantly larger than that of the inlet PVA particles. The results further indicate that the PVA particles after classification had a more concentrated size distribution and better monodispersity than the inlet PVA particles. Furthermore, we analyzed the particle size distribution of the PVA particles after two-stage gas flow acceleration classification by standard sieve. Fig. 9 and Table B1 show the particle mass distribution of differently sized PVA particles after classification. The top outlet of the first stage contained no PVA particles with a particle size greater than 250 μm, and the top outlet of the second stage contained no PVA particles with a particle size greater than 180 μm. PVA particles smaller than 120 μm accounted for 30.9% of the mass of all inlet particles, while at the top outlets of the first stage and second stage, this value increased to 49.0% and 78.9%, respectively. The results indicate that two-stage gas flow acceleration classification can further improve the efficiency of PVA classification and the purity of classified small particles. In industry, multiple stages of classification can be connected as needed to increase the efficiency of PVA classification."
10,Fibrous particles in pulverized PVA,"4.4 Fibrous particles in pulverized PVA As shown in Fig. 3(b), although most of the PVA particles were granular, there were also a small number of fibrous particles in pulverized PVA. This fibrous portion of PVA particles can be defined as a qualified product because it is easily soluble in water. However, due to their slender structure, fibrous PVA particles are difficult to select by rocking sieve and easily classified by gas flow acceleration classification. To quantitatively study the proportion of fibrous PVA particles, we conducted a 13-day continuous experimental analysis of the one-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA. We removed granular PVA particles by sieving the top outlet particles to obtain fibrous PVA particles. Fig. 10 (a) is a photograph of the obtained fibrous PVA particles, which were similar in morphology to cotton and can be intertwined with each other. Fig. 10(b) shows the mass percentages of top outlet, bottom outlet and fibrous PVA particles. Through the 13-day experimental of one-stage gas flow acceleration classification of PVA, the mass percentage of top outlet PVA particles was 35.5%, and that of bottom outlet PVA particles was 64.5%. The mass of fibrous PVA particles accounted for 27.1% of the total mass of the top outlet particles and 9.6% of the total mass of the inlet particles. The results mean that 9.6% of the PVA after pulverization was fibrous PVA particles; this fibrous portion of the PVA particles cannot be selected by a rocking sieve and can only be circulated and accumulated in the pulverizing system, resulting in large energy consumption in the pulverizing system. However, the gas flow acceleration classification can select fibrous PVA particles, thereby reducing the operational energy consumption of the system."
11,Industrial comparisons of gas flow acceleration classifier and rocking sieve,"4.5 Industrial comparisons of gas flow acceleration classifier and rocking sieve SINOPEC Chongqing Sichuan Vinylon Works (SVW) Chemical CO., LTD adopts natural gas acetylene method to produce PVA with a capacity of 160,000 tons per year. The rocking sieves adopted in the original PVA classification process have only 40%–50% efficiency, these qualified PVA products that have not been classified out are returned to the pulverizing system for re-pulverization, resulting in large energy consumption by the pulverizing system. Furthermore, the rocking sieves were easy to be blocked and need frequent cleaning, which affects the long-term continuous operation and cleaner production of the device, and requires considerable human effort and material consumption. To solve the engineering problem brought by the rocking sieve, we used gas flow acceleration classifier instead of rocking sieve. Fig. 11 shows the industrial comparisons of gas flow acceleration classifier and rocking sieve in a PVA production line of 1 t/h. Because the classification efficiency of rocking sieve was only 40%–50%, when the output of PVA products was 1 t/h, the PVA particles return to pulverizer for re-pulverization reached 3 t/h, which included 1 t/h qualified products that are not classified out, so that the load of the pulverizer reached 4 t/h and the energy consumption was up to 1000 kW. After replacing the rocking sieve with gas flow acceleration classifier, the classification efficiency for PVA with a particle size of less than 120 μm reached nearly 100%. Therefore, the PVA particles return to pulverizer for re-pulverization was only 1 t/h and the load of the pulverizer was only 2 t/h. Since the load of the pulverizer was reduced by half, the energy consumption of the pulverizing system was only 500 kW. In summary, gas flow acceleration classifier instead of rocking sieve can reduce energy consumption of pulverizing system by 50%, and can suitable for long-term continuous operation and no blockage, thereby promoting PVA cleaner production. With the increasing global energy shortage and the increasingly serious greenhouse effect (Maroušek et al., 2018, 2019), energy conservation and emission reduction has become the focus of attention around the world, and it is also the goal of every scientific and technological worker."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, gas flow acceleration classification was first developed to enhance PVA classification. The movements of differently sized PVA particles, the efficiencies of one-stage and two-stage classification were systematically analyzed. The main conclusions can be summarized with a few bullet points: ● The regular of particle movement measured by the high-speed camera system was consistent with our previous theoretical analysis and calculations. ● The mean diameter of the PVA particles at the inlet, top outlet of the first stage, bottom outlet of the first stage, top outlet of the second stage and bottom outlet of the second stage was 291 μm, 173 μm, 434 μm, 141 μm and 292 μm, respectively. ● The mass of fibrous PVA particles accounted for 27.1% of the total mass of top outlet particles and 9.6% of the total mass of inlet particles. ● Gas flow acceleration classifier instead of rocking sieve in industry can reduce energy consumption of pulverizing system by 50%. Through theoretical analysis, high-speed camera measurement and experimental verification, this study provides an effective PVA classification method and the results are reliable and instructive. This study is of great significance for energy saving and cleaner production in the PVA industry and can be used to guide particle classification in other fields. But in this study, the effects of gas flow humidity, particle surface humidity, and gas flow temperature on the classification effect have not been studied. Further research on the impact of these physical parameters on the classification effect is the future improvement direction."
