0,Introduction,"The increasing demand for H2 for heavy oil upgrading, desulfurization and upgrading of conventional petroleum, and for production of ammonium, in addition to the projected demand for H2 as a transportation fuel and for portable power, will require H2 production on a massive scale [31]. Increased production of H2 by current technologies will consume greater amounts of natural gas, which in turn will generate greater greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in spite of using non-renewable fossil fuel feedstock, the increase in GHG emissions can be reduced through CO2 sequestration at the production sites. Production of H2 from renewable sources derived from agricultural or other waste streams offers the possibility to contribute to the production capacity with lower or no net greenhouse gas emissions without carbon sequestration technologies, increasing the flexibility and improving the economics of distributed and semi-centralized reforming. Electrolysis and bio-production can be easily adapted to on-site decentralized production of hydrogen, circumventing the need to establish a large and costly distribution infrastructure. Recent increases in energy prices make the large-scale use of biomass a credible alternative to oil and gas. Futures contracts for natural gas range between $3.62 US and $4.74 US per million Btu ($3.43–$4.50 US per Gigajoule (GJ)) [20]. The cost of H2 production by steam methane reforming (SMR) from natural gas is approximately three times the cost of the feedstock, so at the current market price of $3.43–$4.50 US per GJ of natural gas, H2 production by SMR is approximately $10.30–$13.5 US per GJ. The US DOE estimates that H2 production from biomass is now competitive with H2 production by SMR from natural gas and will become less costly than SMR as natural gas prices rise above $10 US per GJ [29]. As the global economy recovers from the current recession, the price of H2 production by SMR will increase as the cost of natural gas increases. Thus, the emergence of a significant price differential between natural gas and biomass as feedstock for H2 production creates a huge potential for production of H2 as a high value-added product from low cost biomass."
1,Current status of the hydrogen production,"About 38Mt (5000 petajoules) of hydrogen is produced worldwide annually, a market valued at about $60 billion [1]. Most (80–92%) is used in processing oil in refineries and producing chemicals such as ammonia and methanol. The rest is used in industrial processes, chemical manufacturing, and food preparation. The demand for hydrogen is expected to grow exponentially in the near future because hydrogen will be required to meet the demand for refining increasingly heavier, higher sulphur crude oils and oil sands and to meet more stringent regulations on the levels of sulphur in gasoline and diesel fuel. Demand for hydrogen is also expected to increase as it starts penetrating the transportation sector as a fuel: about 40 million tonnes of hydrogen per year (yr) would be required to fuel about 100 million fuel-cell-powered cars after full market penetration. Canada is the largest per capita producer and user of hydrogen in the OECD: 3.4 million tonnes per yr of hydrogen produced and 2.97 million tonnes per yr consumed [1]. The estimated demand for hydrogen by 2020 in Canada will likely be 5.9–6.9Mt/yr. The current growth of the production rate is 7970 tonnes per yr [21]. About 59% of hydrogen production comes from SMR of natural gas, but hydrogen production by SMR is responsible for the emission of about 30 million tonnes of CO2 per yr [1,21]. Some CO2 can be recovered and used as an industrial gas or for oil and gas recovery but most is vented. The CO2 generated during hydrogen production from hydrocarbon sources is a good candidate for sequestration because the proximity of western hydrogen plants to favorable geological storage sites lowers transport costs, the incremental cost of CO2 capture with current available technologies is estimated to varies between $25 and $48 per metric tonne, depending on the recovery rate and the technology used [14]. The fastest growing demand for hydrogen comes from the oil and gas industry (for the upgrading of heavy oil from the oil sand developments in Alberta). The current surplus of hydrogen is either used to supplement furnace fuel requirements in the vicinity of production or is vented to the atmosphere. A 200,000-tonne surplus could power about 500,000–900,000 vehicles. Roughly one tone of H2 can fuel two to four fuel cell vehicles (which require pure H2 as fuel) for one yr, or one urban transit bus for about 45 days [21,26]."
2,Hydrogen production technologies,"Hydrogen may be produced by a number of processes, including electrolysis of water, thermocatalytic reformation of hydrogen-rich organic compounds, and biological processes. Currently, H2 is produced, almost exclusively, by steam reformation of methane or by water electrolysis. Biological production of H2 (biohydrogen), using microorganisms, is an area of technology development that offers the potential production of renewable H2 from biomass. Thermocatalytic processes for H2 production include steam reforming, “supercritical water” partial oxidation, and gasification."
3,Hydrogen production by electrolysis,"3.1 Hydrogen production by electrolysis Production of H2 by water electrolysis relies on passing an electric current through a conductive electrolyte in water (alkaline or polymeric), which results in splitting water molecules into H2 and oxygen (O2). Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water is of relatively high quality, as no carbon, sulphur, or nitrogenous compounds are generated in the process. Purification costs for fuel cell grade H2 are thus much less than for SMR. Electrolysis by itself is emission free, but lifecycle emissions are a direct function of the source of the electricity used in the process."
4,Hydrogen production by steam methane reforming (SMR),"3.2 Hydrogen production by steam methane reforming (SMR) Conventional SMR processes use steam at high temperatures (800°C) to react with the methane (CH4), which forms H2 and carbon monoxide (CO); see reaction (1), below. The CO further reacts with vaporized water to form carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, and additional H2 (reaction (2)). (1) CH4 +H2O→CO+3H2,H°298 =206kJ/mol (reforming reaction) (2) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2,H°298 =−41kJ/mol (Water–Gas Shift reaction)"
5,Hydrogen production by steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons,"3.3 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons Hydrogen may also be produced by steam or aqueous reforming of various oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, or glucose using a wide variety of temperatures and catalysts. The catalytic pathway for the production of H2 and CO2 by aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons involves cleavage of C–C bonds, as well as C–H and/or O–H bonds to form adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. Oxygenated hydrocarbons can be reformed in the aqueous phase in the presence of a platinum-based catalyst to produce H2 gas [3,4]. The conversion takes place at moderate temperatures, around 225–265°C, and at pressures of 27–54bar, conditions that prevent steam formation and ensure that the reaction sequence takes place in the aqueous phase. In steam reforming, a steam-carbon molar ratio of between 3 and 5 is normally used, so for aqueous-phase reforming, an energy-equivalent liquid-water carbon molar ratio of between 7.5 and 12.5 is needed, at an operating temperature of 260°C. Using 10% glycerol (100g glycerol per litre (L)=1.08 moles glycerol per L, with a ratio of H2O:Cl=15), at 29bar and 225°C, produced 64.8mol% H2. At 56bar and 265°C, 57mol% H2 were generated. This technology has been patented by Virent Energy Systems, in Madison Wisconsin [2]. The 43,860 tonnes of crude glycerol generated from 500 million litres of biodiesel produced in Canada could be used to produce approximatively 6700 tonnes of H2; enough to fuel 26,800 vehicles for one yr. Hydrogen can also be produced via steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the presence of ceria-supported Ir, Co and Ni catalysts [8,33]. Huber et al. [8] used aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons (ethanol, glycerol) over tin- or alumina supported Ni catalysts at temperatures around 500K (227°C). The performance was comparable with relatively costly platinum-based catalysts for production of H2 from ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol, and generated 50–80mol% H2, plus 20–30% light alkanes. Zhang et al. [33] used cerium oxide (CeO2, ceria)-supported Ir, Co, and Ni catalysts. Steam reforming reactions were conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz micro-reactor at 1bar with a range of temperatures between 250 and 600°C. With the Ir/CeO2 catalyst at 400°C, the mol% conversion of glycerol to H2 was 85.6% and at 550°C, the mol% conversion of glycerol to H2 was 94.1%. With the Co/CeO2 catalyst at 425°C, the mol% conversion of glycerol to H2 was 88.3%, and at 550°C, it was 93.4%. With the Ni/CeO2 catalyst at 450°C, the mol% conversion of glycerol to H2 was 74.9%, and at 550°C, it was 90.8%. The data demonstrate that the Ir/CeO2 catalyst has promising catalytic performance with H2 selectivity of more than 85%, and 100% glycerol conversion at 400°C. All three catalysts displayed H2 selectivity of 90% or greater at 550°C. Alkaline enhanced reforming (AER) can convert aqueous hydrogenated organic molecules to gaseous H2 at low temperatures (<220°C) and pressures using an alkaline pH, which result from the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the feedstock. The alkaline pH of the feedstock creates conditions that are thermodynamically more favorable than conventional steam reforming [25] (Table 1 ). As a result, the reforming occurs at significantly lower temperatures than the corresponding conventional steam reforming. Carbon generated by the reforming reaction precipitates as a solid salt (Na2CO3) byproduct rather than the CO and CO2 gases formed during conventional steam reforming, making the AER reactor simpler, and offering the potential to generate renewable H2 without the concomitant production of greenhouse gases."
6,Hydrogen production by biomass gasification,"3.4 Hydrogen production by biomass gasification Generally, traditional gasification reactors generate a complex mixture of gases, called syn-gas, including CO, CO2, CH4, and small amounts of longer chain hydrocarbons. A key problem with gasification is how to separate and purify the H2 from the other gases in the syn-gas. Ishida et al. [9] propose an innovative method for the synthesis of H2 without CO or CO2 for fuel cells through the reactions of biomasses, alkali metal hydroxides and water vapor at relatively low temperatures (473–623K) under atmospheric pressure. The main reaction for this new method can be expressed as: C 6 H 12 O 6 Cellulose + 12 NaOH Alkali + H 2 O Vapour → 6 Na 2 CO 3 Sodium carbonate + 12 H 2 The reactions of cellulose with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and water vapor were carried out with a conventional mass-controlled gas flow system under atmospheric pressure. The use of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), rodium (Rh), or ruthenium (Ru) catalysts supported on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) specifically enhanced the formation of H2. The total yields of H2 produced through the reactions over these catalysts at 373–773K were increased from 62% to almost 100%. Otsuka and Yamanaka [23] also studied thermal catalytic conversion for producing high purity hydrogen from biomass. As in the case of Ishida et al. [9], H2 was produced by adding NaOH and water vapor to the biomass. The yield of H2 from cellulose was approximately 100%, and thus 1 tonne of cellulose could produce about 150kgH2. By this method, high purity H2 without CO and CO2 contamination can be produced. In the case of cellulose, H2 was formed at relatively low temperatures (473–673K), and little CH4 was generated as a byproduct, but CO and CO2 were not formed at all. When a Ni catalyst was added to the reacting biomass, evolution of CH4 was not observed and the H2 yield was roughly 100%. Although thermal catalytic conversion seems to be an attractive process for producing relatively pure H2, more research is needed to improve catalyst utilization and reactor performance and to solve the main problem related to tar and char disposal."
7,Hydrogen production by supercritical water partial oxidation,"3.5 Hydrogen production by supercritical water partial oxidation Supercritical water partial oxidation is a process that occurs in water at temperatures and pressures above a mixture's critical point [7]. Under these conditions water becomes a fluid with unique properties that can be used to advantage in the destruction of hazardous wastes such as PCBs, or for the production of H2 [15], although little data for hydrogen via this process are available. The fluid has a density between that of water vapor and liquid at standard conditions, and exhibits high gas-like diffusion rates along with high liquid-like collision rates. Efficient oxidation reactions occur at low temperature (400–650°C) with reduced NO x production."
8,Biological hydrogen production by dark-fermentation,"3.6 Biological hydrogen production by dark-fermentation Biohydrogen technologies provide a wide range of approaches to generate hydrogen, including direct and indirect photolysis, photo-fermentation, and dark-fermentation [12]. Hydrogen production by direct photolysis occurs in photosynthesis microorganisms such as green algae, which convert sunlight into useful, stored chemical energy by the following general reaction: 2H2O→2H2 +O2. Indirect photolysis occurs in microorganisms such as Cyanobacteria which can synthesize and evolve H2 through photosynthesis via a two phase process: 12H2O+6CO2 →C6H12O6 +6O2 followed by C6H12O6 +12H2O→12H2 +6CO2. Hydrogen production by photo-fermentation occurs in purple non-sulphur bacteria, catalyzed by nitrogenase under nitrogen-decient conditions using light energy and reduced compounds (organic acids): C6H12O6 +12H2O→12H2 +6CO2. Hydrogen production by dark-fermentation is carried out by anaerobic bacteria, grown in the dark on carbohydrate-rich substrates. Fermentation reactions can be operated at mesophilic (25–40°C), thermophilic (40–65°C), extreme thermophilic (65–80°C), or hyperthermophilic (>80°C) temperatures. While direct and indirect photolysis systems produce pure H2, dark-fermentation processes produce a mixed biogas containing primarily H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2), but which may also contain lesser amounts of CH4, CO, and/or hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The gas composition presents technical challenges with respect to using the hydrogen in fuel cells [12]. Comparison of the rates of H2 production by various biohydrogen systems, however, suggests that dark-fermentation systems offer an excellent potential for practical application and integration with emerging hydrogen and fuel cell technologies [12]. Significant amounts of H2 may be produced using cellulosic feedstocks in conventional bioreactors with anaerobic bacteria that can utilize cellulose as a sole carbon source [10,11,13,16,24]. Although biohydrogen technologies are still in their infancy, developing technologies offer potential for practical application."
9,Barriers to renewable hydrogen,"Each of the renewable hydrogen technologies outlined above has advantages and disadvantages. Each hydrogen production technology has different reaction conditions with different substrates and conversion efficiencies (Table 2 ). Hydrogen production by SMR has traditionally used natural gas, but there is increasing interest in steam reforming of methane derived from land-fill [19]. Steam reforming of aqueous phase oxygenated hydrocarbons has excellent potential for renewable hydrogen production from organic molecules (glycerol, polyols, alcohols, sugars, organic acids) derived from agricultural and food-process industries [32]. The major challenge for hydrogen production by steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons is the development of inexpensive catalysts with high conversion efficiencies. This is also the case for alkaline enhanced reforming, with the added challenge that the carbon generated by the reforming processes is sequestered as a sodium carbonate precipitate, which creates problems with respect to catalyst fouling. Biomass gasification can utilize renewable feedstocks derived from agricultural and/or forestry residues [5], but these processes also generate a variety of gaseous, and in some cases also liquid phase, co-products [5,18]. Supercritical water partial oxidation generates clean hydrogen, but requires significant energy input to attain the temperatures and pressures above a mixture's thermodynamic critical point. Biological hydrogen production by fermentation has a great deal of promise, especially systems that utilize cellulosic feedstocks and/or sugar-rich food-processing waste streams. If biological hydrogen systems are to become commercially competitive, however, they must be able to synthesize H2 at rates that are sufficient for practical application. Research and development aimed at increasing rates of synthesis and yields of H2 include optimization of bioreactor designs for rapid removal of the H2 and CO2 to maintain low H2 partial pressures and genetic modification of H2 synthesizing microorganisms. All renewable hydrogen systems, however, whether thermocatalytic or biological, face a common challenge. Both thermocatalytic processes like aqueous reforming of organic molecules and biological fermentation systems generate gas mixtures of hydrogen and CO2. Fermentation of sugars, starch, or cellulose by anaerobic microorganisms, for example, generates equal molar amounts of H2 and CO2 at low pressure and density, and the gas stream contains significant amounts of water vapor. Thus, all renewable hydrogen production systems require the concomitant development and integration of hydrogen purification and storage systems."
10,The purification and storage issue,"4.1 The purification and storage issue The combustion of one kilogram of hydrogen can release up to 120MJ of energy, not-with-standing an amount of 20MJ/kg contained in the residual water vapor. The equivalent of energy released by combustion of oil and natural gas would require 2.5–2.75kg of fuel. Thus, hydrogen is one of the most efficient fuels on a gravimetric basis. Hydrogen, however, is also the lightest element. Methane gas is 8 times heavier than hydrogen gas, and gasoline is 10 times heavier than liquid hydrogen [22]. Thus, despite having the largest heat of combustion per unit of mass, hydrogen exhibits a very low volumetric energy density. Advances in gas separation technologies, such as improved separation membranes, resulting from the need to recover pure hydrogen from a mixed gas stream, have the potential to improve efficiency and recovery while decreasing the costs of hydrogen production. Palladium (Pd)-based membranes are viable candidates for membrane reactors because of their high hydrogen permeability and catalytic activity with respect to hydrogen dissociation. However, Pd membranes are very rapidly deactivated by trace concentration of sulphur (among other contaminants). Binary Pd–M (where M=Ag, Ni, or Cu) alloys have been proposed to improve the membrane resistance to deactivation. The choice of M will vary with the composition of the gas stream and we will concentrate of optimizing the nature of M to meet the particular requirement of the hydrogen source."
11,Performance expectations,"4.2 Performance expectations A set of gravimetric and volumetric storage density targets can be established to determine when hydrogen energy technologies will be marketable. These targets very much depend on the nature of the application and the criteria selected to define competitiveness, which may include externalities such as environmental, security of supply and health benefits. Performance targets have been proposed by the US Department of Energy [30] for transportation applications, based on achieving a driving range of 560km for a hydrogen powered vehicle using a storage unit comparable in volume, weight, fill rate and cost to those currently available for gasoline powered cars. The main targets of interest are the gravimetric and volumetric storage densities, which the DOE has established 4.5wt% and 0.9kWh/L respectively by 2010, and 5.5wt% and 1.3kWh/L by 2015. They include the total weight of the filled storage system. This means that the weight of the cryogenic or high-pressure containers, the weight of the storage media and of all auxiliary systems must be taken into account to determine the volumetric and gravimetric storage densities. Cost, kinetics and other issues must also be taken into account. System fill times for 5kg of hydrogen should be less than 5min by 2010 and 3.5min by 2015. The loss rate (for instance through boil-off) should be less than 1g of hydrogen per kg of hydrogen stored per hour (0.1% per hour or 2.4% per day), 0.1g/kgH2 stored by 2010 and 0.05g/kgH2 stored by 2015. For portable applications, targets can be established based on making micro fuel cell systems competitive with current batteries. Our network partners, for instance, expect for such systems a gravimetric storage density of 2%, a volumetric storage density of 0.12g/mL and a cost of the materials better than $30/kg in order for micro fuel cell systems to become competitive with lithium ion batteries. The technical goals on storage densities, in addition to the purity requirements for hydrogen use in fuel cells have an impact on the quality of the hydrogen produced and purified upstream. High pressure storage of hydrogen is not sensitive to the presence of impurities, the quality requirements of hydrogen being driven by the application side (fuel cell or internal combustion engines). High density storage of hydrogen as chemical hydrides, complex hydrides or classical metal hydrides will however be sensitive to the presence of impurities upstream. In the case of cryogenic storage of hydrogen as a liquid, purification can be integrated into the storage process and performed during the liquefaction cycle."
12,The hydrogen market,
13,Market issues,"5.1 Market issues The key market for fuel cells has always assumed to be the automotive industry. The great expectation that hydrogen fuel-cell powered vehicles will displace gasoline and diesel powered vehicles has not materialized for a variety of reasons, but primarily because fuel cell technology has not yet matured and the infrastructure required for hydrogen storage, transportation, and refueling has been slow to develop. Add to this the current economic contraction of the North American automotive industry. Thus, it is highly likely that the automotive industry will be the last to adopt hydrogen technologies. It is now more likely that hydrogen fuel cell development will come through niche applications, such as portable power, backup power for telecommunications, and fuel-cell powered fork-lifts, that will slowly build as hydrogen storage methods improve, and that many methods of hydrogen storage will be required to satisfy a broad range of fuel cells applications. This is analogous to battery technology that has advanced from simple alkaline batteries to a multitude of energy storage systems, each with its own applications, but none supplanting alkaline batteries completely."
14,Potential markets,"5.2 Potential markets The Sustainable Development Technology Canada, in their Business Case for hydrogen [26] divides the hydrogen market into four parts: i) the captive industrial hydrogen market; ii) the byproduct hydrogen market; iii) the merchant hydrogen market; and iv) the hydrogen energy (or non-conventional) market. Renewable hydrogen production systems will find their niches in one or more of these markets. The captive industrial hydrogen market accounts for 90% of H2 production, which includes heavy oil upgrading, oil refining, ammonia, and methanol production. It relies on large conventional H2 production systems tightly integrated with the industrial application. About 60% of the production is obtained through SMR. Alternative production pathways are being sought due to the rapid pace of increase of the price of natural gas (tripling from 2001 to 2006). As discussed above, the current economic recession has resulted in lower natural gas feedstock costs for hydrogen production by SMR, but as the global economy revives, natural gas prices will increase again, resulting in higher costs for both hydrogen and the products it is used to make such ammonia for fertilizers. The byproduct hydrogen market refers to hydrogen can be produced during chlor-alkali-chlorate processes, methanol and ethylene production. Hydrogen can also be recovered from tail gases emitted by hydrogen production systems using gas separators. The H2 obtained as a byproduct is sold to merchant hydrogen markets, refineries and as a chemical feedstock (for example for hydrogen peroxide production). The unsold surplus H2 is either vented in the atmosphere or used for heating. In 2004, 272,000 tonnes of surplus H2 were generated in Canada, enough to fuel 1.4 million light duty fuel cell vehicles. The cost effectiveness of the byproduct H2 market depends on the location of the production site, which impacts delivery costs, gas purity, and the pressurization costs. The nature of the impurities depend on the process through which H2 is produced: chlorine and hydrochloric acid can be present in concentrations of up to 1% for electrolysis chemical processes, and methane can be present in concentrations of 10–15% with trace emissions of CO and hydrocarbons for acetylene processes. Tail gas H2 purities typically lie in the range 15–50% H2. The merchant hydrogen market includes heat treatment of metals, glass making, microelectronics and portable power, power generator cooling, and hydrogenation of food oils. The grade of H2 required is application driven, which further segments this market: heat treatment of metals and power generator cooling require low grade H2, whereas semiconductor fabrication plants require ultra-high purity (99.999%). Purification systems will thus be required. The market relies on small local conventional H2 production systems located on-site or at a centralized facility; in this case H2 delivered by gas trailers or liquid H2 cryostats. Most of the merchant H2 is obtained from the byproduct hydrogen market. The hydrogen energy (or non-conventional) market is based on H2 energy applications such as internal combustion engines powered by H2 or Hythane (an 80:20 mixture of methane:H2), peak shaving and fuel cell systems for transportation, backup power or portable applications. Renewable hydrogen systems could play a significant role in this market, but their penetration into this market will be determined by their conversion efficiencies, the availability and costs of feedstocks, and their environmental impacts. In contrast to large-scale SMR hydrogen production facilities, which require a centralized H2 production infrastructure, renewable hydrogen production systems offer distributed production, which is best suited for H2 energy applications. Smaller scale, renewable hydrogen production systems would minimize distribution costs and enhance overall energy efficiency."
15,Renewable hydrogen strategies for the energy market,"5.3 Renewable hydrogen strategies for the energy market Consumer energy applications will require delivery systems that can supply hydrogen as readily as gasoline and natural gas are supplied today. Higher-pressure gaseous storage and non-conventional storage technologies will be used to meet the requirements of transportation applications (storage at 350–700bar compared to the 200bar storage pressure commonly used in normal merchant gas systems). Metal hydride storage is likely to be used by other hydrogen energy applications, such as micro fuel cell portable applications, requiring specific purity and hydrogen delivery requirements. Efficient purification and separation technologies are likely to be essential to the market penetration of such applications. Gas purity requirements are important for the hydrogen energy market. They very much depend on the energy conversion device used, as well as on the storage technology. Fuel cells are very sensitive to CO and sulphur poisoning. The Technical Specifications for PEMFC road vehicles developed by ISO/TC 197 WG 12 (ISO/TS 14687-2) specifies a hydrogen fuel quality with a hydrogen content of no less than 99.99% volume, and imposes specific limits on non-hydrogen constituents that are often found in hydrogen obtained from hydrocarbons (CO, CO2, S, hydrocarbons), as well as those occurring in hydrogen produced by water electrolysis (oxygen, ammonia, sodium, potassium). Combustion systems are much less sensitive to impurity levels. Humidity is a critical issue when compressing hydrogen, as significant levels of water vapor can lead to tank lining corrosion. Based on the SAE J1616 standard for compressed natural gas vehicles, hydrogen systems in Canadian climates should operate on hydrogen containing less than 5ppm water."
16,Conclusion,"There are a number of emerging technologies with excellent potential for renewable hydrogen production, such as by steam reforming of aqueous oxygenated hydrocarbons, gasification of biomass, and biological hydrogen production, and research to improve the efficiencies of conversion and reduce production costs is underway. Renewable hydrogen production offers the potential for a distributed hydrogen supply network model, which would be based on on-site hydrogen production. On-site production is considered to be the most likely pathway during the market development of energy systems. A distributed network of such sites could provide a cost-effective refueling infrastructure, as hydrogen must be used as close as possible to its production site to optimize the overall energy efficiency of a hydrogen-based energy system. All renewable hydrogen production technologies face the common challenge of integration with hydrogen purification and storage."
