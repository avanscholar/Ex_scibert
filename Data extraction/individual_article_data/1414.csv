0,Introduction,"Since carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones are precursors for many drugs, vitamins and fragrances, selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the most important transformations in industrial chemistry. In particular, the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes is a fundamentally important laboratory and commercial procedure [1–6]. Aromatic aldehydes are valuable as intermediates for both perfumes and medicines [5–7]. Although there are many methods for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, these methods are generally carried out at a high temperature and high pressure by employing stoichiometric oxygen donors (such as chromate and permanganate) [7–10]. Since large amounts of wastes containing heavy metal are formed along with the products, atom efficiency [11], which is defined as Eq. (1), of these methods is very low. (1) Atom efficiency ( % ) = molecular weight of the desired product sum total of molecular weights of all substances produced × 100 A catalytic process is favorable especially in an oxidation of alcohols to corresponding carbonyl groups using molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant instead of stoichiometric oxygen donors. Since only water (H2O) is formed as the by-product when O2 is used, atom efficiency is much higher than that of oxidations using stoichiometric oxygen donors. A catalytic process for selective oxidation of various alcohols to corresponding aldehydes under mild conditions, i.e., low temperature and nearly atmospheric pressure, has recently been reported [12]. Since a photocatalytic reaction proceeds at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure, application of photocatalytic reactions to organic synthesis has attracted attention in terms of green chemistry. Recently, photocatalytic partial oxidations of benzyl alcohol with O2 have been reported [13–17]. However, atom efficiency in these photocatalytic methods never reaches 100% because a stoichiometric amount of H2O is formed as a by-product. Formation of aldehydes by simple dehydrogenation of corresponding alcohols would be more attractive because this reaction also gives dihydrogen (H2), which is an alternative energy carrier [18]. Atom efficiency of simple dehydrogenation is higher than that of oxidative dehydrogenation. For example, atom efficiencies in formation of benzaldehyde (PhCHO) from benzyl alcohol (BnOH) (Eqs. (2) and (3)) are 85.5% and 98.1% for, respectively. (2) (3) If H2 is counted as a valuable product, the atom efficiency of Eq. (3) becomes 100%, i.e., zero emission, yielding no useless product, is achieved by oxidant-free dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. However, it is generally difficult to eliminate hydrogen of alcohols as H2 because Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is positive and is much larger than that of oxidative dehydrogenation, yielding liquid H2O. However, if oxidant-free dehydrogenation is carried out in liquid phase, one of the products, i.e., H2, is removed from the liquid phase due to the small solubility to alcohols and a thermodynamic equilibrium is never achieved. Therefore, continuous dehydrogenation just before consumption of alcohols is expected in a liquid-phase reaction. Since photocatalytic reaction of titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) satisfies almost all of the 12 proposed requirements for green chemistry [19], organic synthesis of various compounds using photocatalysis has recently been studied by many researchers [20–22]. When TiO2 is irradiated by UV light, charge separation occurs and thus-formed electrons in the conduction band and positive holes in the valence band cause reduction and oxidation, respectively. This redox reaction proceeds at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. Since light is indispensable for photocatalytic reaction, the reactions can be easily controlled by the intensity of light and finally can be stopped by turning the light source off. By simple filtration or centrifugation, a TiO2 photocatalyst is easily separated from reaction mixture after the reaction. In addition, TiO2 has been used for a long time as an indispensable inorganic material such as a pigment and UV absorber because it is inexpensive and not toxic for humans and the environment. Titanium is a common and inexpensive element because titanium has the tenth largest Clarke number [23]. Although various oxides of titanium exist, TiO2 in which the oxidation state of titanium is +4, is most stable under the atmosphere and is easily formed without extra attention. Since photocatalytic reaction of TiO2 is a green redox system, it is important to apply the photocatalytic reaction to organic synthesis. It has been reported that platinum-loaded TiO2 (Pt–TiO2) produced H2 from aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol to give corresponding aldehydes or ketones [24,25]. Dehydrogenation of these alcohols, especially methanol, has also been used to investigate whether newly developed photocatalysts have the potential to produce H2 or not. However, as far as we know, photocatalytic dehydrogenation of aromatic alcohols along with H2 formation only limited paper have been reported, although partial oxidation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding benzaldehydes in the presence of an oxidant has not been reported. In this study, we examined simultaneous formation of aromatic aldehydes and H2 by photocatalytic dehydrogenation of liquid alcohols under oxidant-free conditions at room temperature."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of metal-loaded TiO2 samples,"2.1 Preparation of metal-loaded TiO2 samples All reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. and used without further purification. Photodeposition was used to load metal (1wt%) (Pt, silver, copper and palladium) on TiO2 using hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (99.9%), silver nitrate (99.8%), copper chloride (97%) and palladium(II) chloride (99%) as starting sources. Bare TiO2 particles (200mg) were suspended in an aqueous solution (10cm3) containing a metal source and oxalic acid (100μmol) as a hole scavenger, and the solution was photoirradiated for 2h with a 400W high-pressure mercury arc (λ >300nm, Eiko-sha) with magnetic stirring under argon (Ar) at 298K. Analysis of the liquid phase after photoirradiation revealed that the metal was almost completely deposited on the TiO2 particles. After photoirradiation, the metal-loaded TiO2 particles were recovered, washed repeatedly with water, and dried at 293K in vacuo for 2h. Nickel-loaded TiO2 particles were prepared by the impregnation method (dried at room temperature and calcined at 473K for 1h) using nickel acetate (98%) and H2 reduction (at 523K for 2h) because potential of the conduction band of TiO2 was not sufficient to reduce Ni2+ (Ni2+/Ni=−0.257V)."
3,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.2 Photocatalytic reaction In acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing BnOH (50μmol) in a test tube, Pt–TiO2 powder (50mg) was suspended. The tube was sealed with a rubber septum and then photoirradiated by a UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED, PJ-1505-2CA, CCS Inc., Kyoto, maximum energy at λ =366nm) under Ar with magnetic stirring at room temperature. After the reaction, the gas phase was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A equipped with MS-5A columns). After the suspension had been filtered to remove the particles, the amounts of BnOH remaining and product(s) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, SPD-20A detector, LC-20AT pump, DGU-20A3 degasser, CTO-10ASvp oven, equipped with a Shim-pack FC-ODS column, eluent: ultra pure water/CH3CN=50/50, flow rate: 0.5cm3 min−1, oven: 313K, λ: 220nm). To obtain apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), a spectrum and light intensity of the UV–LED were determined using a spectroradiometer USR-45D (Ushio)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2,"3.1 Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2 Fig. 1 shows time courses of the amounts of BnOH remaining, PhCHO formed and H2 evolved in the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2. The amount of BnOH monotonously decreased along with photoirradiation time and was almost completely consumed after 1h, while PhCHO and H2 were obtained in high yields (99% and 95%, respectively), indicating that dehydrogenation of BnOH shown in Eq. (3) occurred completely free from thermodynamical restraint. Material balance (MB) and redox balance (RB) in Fig. 1 were calculated by using Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively, and are shown in Fig. 1. (4) MB ( % ) = n ( PhCHO ) + n ( BnOH ) n 0 ( BnOH ) × 100 (5) RB = n ( H 2 ) n ( PhCHO ) where n(PhCHO), n(BnOH) and n(H2) are the amounts of PhCHO, BnOH and H2 observed after photoirradiation, respectively, and n 0(BnOH) is the initial amount of BnOH. After 60-min photoirradiation, MB and RB were determined to be 99% and 0.93, respectively. The high yield of PhCHO and the value of MB close to unity indicate that only dehydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO shown in Eq. (3) occurred, i.e., neither a side-reaction nor a successive reaction consuming BnOH and PhCHO occurred. Re-reduction of PhCHO to BnOH was not observed under the present conditions, although Kohtani et al. reported that PhCHO was reduced to BnOH by photocatalysis of TiO2 in the presence of a hole scavenger such as an excess of ethanol [26]. These results indicate that photogenerated electrons were injected into the Pt co-catalyst loaded and selectively used for reduction of protons (H+) to form H2. The value of RB close to unity together with MB=ca. 100% indicates both that H2 was formed from BnOH and that H2 was quantitatively separated from the liquid phase. Self-separation of H2 from the reaction system is indispensable to achieve complete conversion of BnOH free from thermodynamic restraint and is also practically important because no energy and process are required to separate H2. From the ratio of the amount of PhCHO and the amount of photons irradiated (Eq (6)), AQE was calculated to be 38% at 30min irradiation in Fig. 1, indicating that dehydrogenation of BnOH occurred very effectively under the deaerated conditions. (6) AQE ( % ) = 2 × amount of PhCHO number of incident photons × 100 To investigate the high selectivity of PhCHO in the present reaction condition, reaction of PhCHO in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2 was carried out under the same irradiation condition. Benzaldehyde conversion and H2 yield were much smaller (7.6% and 2μmol, respectively, for 1h) than BnOH conversion and H2 yield (>99% and 48μmol, respectively, for 1h), indicating that the reactivity of PhCHO was much smaller than that of BnOH in this condition. The smaller reactivity was attributed to the high selectivity of PhCHO in the photocatalytic oxidation of BnOH in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2. Photocatalytic oxidation of aldehyde under a deaerated condition is generally described by Eq. (7). (7) R-CHO + H 2 O → R-COOH + H 2 Water is indispensable for oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid. However, the present photocatalytic reaction was performed in a water-free CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2. Since no water formed as shown in Eq. (3), the water-free condition was preserved during the whole reaction. Therefore, we can conclude that water-free and oxygen-free conditions strongly contributed to the high selectivity of PhCHO in the photocatalytic oxidation of BnOH."
6,Effect of reaction conditions,"3.2 Effect of reaction conditions Table 1 shows results of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO under various conditions. Dark reaction did not occur at room temperature even in the presence of Pt–TiO2 (entry 2), and irradiation of UV light to BnOH in the absence of Pt–TiO2 did not induce any reaction (entry 3), indicating that neither thermocatalytic nor photochemical reaction of BnOH occurred in CH3CN at room temperature. Photocatalytic reactions using bare TiO2 particles were also examined to clarify the effect of the Pt co-catalyst. Irradiation of UV light to BnOH in the presence of bare TiO2 resulted in low conversion of BnOH and low selectivity of PhCHO without H2 formation (entry 4). This means that trapping of electrons by H+ did not occur, resulting in formation of Ti3+ in TiO2. Therefore, the Pt co-catalyst is indispensable for continuous and stoichiometric conversion of BnOH to PhCHO and H2 as well as other conversions of simple aliphatic alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. Reaction using bare TiO2 under an aerated condition (entry 5) has always been used in oxidative dehydrogenation (Eq. (2)) and degradation of various substrates. The presence of O2 drastically increased the conversion of BnOH, and relatively high selectively of PhCHO was obtained. However, PhCHO yield and MB (53% and 93%, respectively) at 64% conversion were much smaller than those (>99% and 99%, respectively) obtained in the condition used in entry 1 (Pt–TiO2 and deaerated condition). The yield of PhCHO obtained in entry 5 is almost in agreement with those reported in oxidative dehydrogenation (TiO2 and aerated condition) [13–17]. Reaction of BnOH in suspensions of Pt–TiO2 under an aerated condition resulted in lesser selectivity of PhCHO and MB (entry 6), indicating that the Pt co-catalyst accelerated oxidation of PhCHO in the presence of O2. These results (entries 5 and 6) indicate that photogenerated electrons were not used in reduction of H+ under an aerated condition. In the presence of O2, electrons were trapped by O2 and thus-formed superoxide anion radicals (O2 −) caused degradation of BnOH and/or PhCHO into other molecules. These side-reactions are attributed to the low PhCHO selectivity and insufficient MB."
7,Effect of the various kinds of TiO2,"3.3 Effect of the various kinds of TiO2 Table 1 also shows the effects of various kinds of TiO2 on the amounts of PhCHO formed in CH3CN suspensions of Pt–TiO2 under deaerated conditions (entries 7–10). Since reaction time was shortened to 15min, photocatalytic activities of these Pt–TiO2 samples can be compared easily. Physical properties of TiO2 samples before Pt loading are shown in Table S1. Since both holes formed in anatase and rutile have sufficient oxidation potential to oxidize BnOH, a key factor determining whether dehydrogenation of BnOH occurs or not would be the position of the conduction band. The results (entries 7–10) indicate that the crystal phase of TiO2 is not a decisive factor controlling the activity of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH in CH3CN. In H2 evolution from an aqueous system, the rutile phase is often eliminated from candidates of TiO2 photocatalysts because of insufficient potential for H2/H+. It is interesting that H2 formation was observed in a Pt-loaded MT-150A (rutile-type TiO2) sample (entry 10) and that the yield was almost the same as those of Pt-loaded anatase TiO2 and anatase-rutile TiO2 samples (entries 7–9). The values of RB were close to unity in all cases, indicating that successive reaction(s) consuming PhCHO did not occur. Slightly smaller values of MB at around 90% except in the case of P 25 are probably due to adsorption of BnOH because notable by-products were not detected in any case. Among the TiO2 photocatalysts examined in this study, P 25 TiO2 exhibited the highest performance in stoichiometric dehydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO and H2 without side-reaction and consumption of PhCHO. Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2012.09.051."
8,Effect of water,"3.4 Effect of water Effects of the amount of water dissolved in CH3CN were also examined and the results are shown in Table 1. The reaction rate drastically decreased in the presence of only a small amount (1%) of water (entry 11) and no reaction occurred when 10% water was dissolved in CH3CN (entry 12). These results suggest that adsorption of BnOH on the TiO2 surface competed with that of water and that inhibition of the photocatalytic reaction was caused by strong adsorption of water. Since dehydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO under deaerated conditions (Eq. (3)) yields no water, this reaction is expected to continue without decrease in the reaction rate. On the other hand, water is formed as one of the products in photocatalytic reaction under aerated conditions (Eq. (2)) and water formation is one of the reasons for the smaller conversion of BnOH in the reaction under aerated conditions (entries 5 and 6)."
9,Effects of metal co-catalysts,"3.5 Effects of metal co-catalysts Table 1 also shows the effects of metal co-catalysts on photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH in CH3CN suspensions. When gold, copper or nickel was loaded as a co-catalyst, PhCHO and H2 were generated almost stoichiometrically and MB close to unity was obtained, although longer photoirradiation time than that in the case of Pt–TiO2 was required (entries 13, 15 and 16). Loading of silver and palladium resulted in low RB (H2/PhCHO) (entries 14 and 17), although we do not have an explanation at this point."
10,Durability and reactions at high concentrations,"3.6 Durability and reactions at high concentrations It is important for green chemistry to recover a photocatalyst and re-use it many times without special treatment such as calcination. To examine the durability of the Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst in this reaction system, the Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst was used repeatedly. After 60-min reaction in an CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2, Pt–TiO2 particles were recovered by simple filtration from the reaction mixture and were re-used. Fig. 2 shows that the Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst was reusable without notable loss of activity. For practical use, reactions of high concentrations of a substrate are important. Fig. 3 shows time courses of the amounts of BnOH remaining, PhCHO formed and H2 evolved under the condition of the initial amount of BnOH being 500μmol, which is 10-times larger than that shown in Fig. 1. Although longer photoirradiation was required for complete consumption of BnOH, 93% conversion and 99% selectivity were obtained after 8-h photoirradiation. It is notable that MB almost of 100% and RB close to unity were obtained after photoirradiation up to 8h, indicating that only dehydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO shown in Eq. (3) occurred even in the concentrated condition. Under the concentrated condition, AQE reached 70% after 1-h irradiation. High AQE (38%) was obtained even in the photocatalytic reaction of 50μmol BnOH, suggesting that BnOH acted as an efficient hole scavenger. Concentration of hole scavenger on the surface of photocatalyst particles is one of important factors controlling the reaction rate and AQE of photocatalytic reactions. Increase in the BnOH concentration increased the surface concentration of BnOH, resulting in the higher AQE (70%) in the concentrated condition (500μmol BnOH). Since reactions without the use of a solvent are more favorable from the point of view of green chemistry, photocatalytic solvent-free dehydrogenation of BnOH was also examined. The reaction was very simple, i.e., only Pt–TiO2 particles were suspended in 5cm3 of BnOH and the mixture was photoirradiated under Ar. Results are shown in Fig. 4 . The amount of PhCHO increased linearly along with photoirradiation and the PhCHO yield reached 1220μmol after 24-h photoirradiation. Under the solvent-free condition, AQE was calculated to be 31% after 4-h irradiation of Fig. 4. In the solvent-free system, the amount of H2 evolved was not determined because H2 was continuously purged from the reactor (test tube) to prevent a large increase in internal pressure. These results include two important points: the first point is that photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BnOH occurred without loss of activity in the BnOH solvent as well as the CH3CN solvent and the second point is that high efficiency (reaction rate and AQE) was obtained compared with condition of a low concentration of BnOH."
11,Applicability,"3.7 Applicability Applicability of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes was investigated using various aromatic alcohols having other functional groups (methyl, chloro, acetyl, nitro, amino), and Table 2 shows results of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation in CH3CN suspensions of Pt–TiO2 particles under deaerated conditions. Dehydrogenation reaction proceeded in all cases, and both high yield and RB close to unity were obtained when benzyl alcohols having methyl, chloro and methoxy groups were used. Reactions of some benzyl alcohols having functional groups such as amino and nitro groups resulted in lower conversion and selectivity than those and also resulted in the formation of a solid by-product. Dehydrogenation of diphenylmethanol to diphenylketone was investigated as model a reaction of a secondary alcohol to ketone, and a high yield (87%) and RB close to unity were observed. These results indicate wide applicability of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes and H2."
12,Conclusion,"Photocatalytic conversion of aromatic alcohols in acetonitrile (CH3CN) suspensions of metal-loaded titanium(IV) oxide under various conditions was examined. Benzaldehyde (PhCHO) and hydrogen (H2) were simultaneously produced with a molar ratio of 1:1 from benzyl alcohol (BnOH) in CH3CN suspensions of platinum-loaded titanium(IV) oxide (Pt–TiO2) under deaerated conditions and BnOH was converted quantitatively with high apparent quantum efficiency of 38% at 366nm. Loading of a Pt co-catalyst was indispensable for stoichiometric conversion of BnOH to PhCHO. The yield of PhCHO in simple dehydrogenation (>99%) using a Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst was much higher than those (53% and 44%) obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation of BnOH using bare TiO2 and Pt–TiO2, respectively, in the presence of oxygen accompanying the formation of water instead of H2. When a small amount of water (1% (v/v)) was intentionally added to the CH3CN suspension of Pt–TiO2, reaction rates of simple dehydrogenation drastically decreased. These control experiments under air and in the presence of water indicate that oxygen-free and water-free conditions were important for quantitative conversion of BnOH to PhCHO. Since no active oxygen species were formed under the conditions, undesired oxidation of BnOH and PhCHO did not occur, resulting in higher selectivity of PhCHO and high MB in the system. The large reaction rate was maintained because water, which drastically decreased the reaction rate, was not formed in the simple dehydrogenation. Photocatalytic hydrogenation of BnOH to PhCHO occurred even in a solvent-free condition in which only Pt–TiO2 particles were suspended in BnOH and PhCHO formed linearly for 24-h photoirradiation. Photocatalytic dehydrogenation was applied for various aromatic alcohols to obtain corresponding aldehydes."
