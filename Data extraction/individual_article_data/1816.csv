0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) gas as an alternative energy source has been considered as one of the best options for tackling the energy crisis and climate change effects [1]. It can be produced via photocatalysis of water splitting [2–5]. Among the wide number of semiconductor catalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most popular photocatalyst [1,6–8]. TiO2 exhibits high chemical and thermal stability. However, it has a low quantum yield due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes [2]. Thus, several methods have been reported to enhance the catalytic performance of TiO2, including 1) sensitization with a low bandgap material, 2) prolonged lifetime via facet heterojunction [9], 3) adding electron donors, 4) conjugation with a co-catalyst or narrow bandgap semiconductors. The heterojunctions of TiO2 with other semiconductors improve the catalytic performance of TiO2 via facilitating the spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Several semiconductors were conjugated with TiO2 to enhance their catalytic performance and extend the light absorption of TiO2 to the visible light region [10–12]. However, some of these combinations require expensive noble elements and undergo photo-corrosion [10]. Therefore, further efforts are highly demanded to accomplish high performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), including zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), are hybrid porous coordination polymers with fascinating properties [13–21]. They have been applied for energy-based applications, including the production of hydrogen via water-splitting under ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) [22–28], alcohol dehydrogenation [29], and hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) [30–38]. ZIF-67, cobalt-based ZIFs, derived Co@nitrogen doped carbon (Co@NC) composite was reported as a co-catalyst with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for water splitting via photocatalysis [39]. MOFs and ZIFs materials exhibited high photocatalytic performance for water splitting [23]. Herein, the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Co3O4@nitrogen doped carbon (Co3O4@C) via carbonization. The synthesized materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The incorporation of Co3O4@C with TiO2 as an active co-catalyst toward H2 generation was investigated using different loading of Co3O4@C. The mechanism of photocatalysis was discussed and supported using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear scan voltammetry, electrochemical independence spectroscopy (EIS) using Nyquist plots, and photoresponse current. Co3O4@C/TiO2 offered high photocatalytic performance compared to pure TiO2. In addition, the recyclability of the prepared composite to produce hydrogen for long time was tested."
1,Materials and methods,"Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, 2-methylimidazole (Hmim), rhodamine B (RhB), and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and ethanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (UK.). TiO2 P25 (Aeroxide) was purchased from Acros Organics."
2,Synthesis of ZIF-67 and Co3O4@C,"ZIF-67 was synthesized using the triethylamine-assisted one-pot method at room temperature [40]. Briefly, TEA (0.7 mmol) was added to a cobalt nitrate solution (0.67 mmol) followed by the successive addition of RhB (4 mL, 8 μmol) and Hmim solution (0.7 mmol). The material was washed several times (3 × 50 mL) with water to remove any impurities. The resultant material was then used as a precursor for the synthesis of Co3O4@C via carbonization at 800 °C under airflow. The temperature of carbonization was selected based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of ZIF-67. The carbonized material was washed several times with water (3 × 50 mL). The material was dried in an oven overnight."
3,Preparation of Co3O4@C/TiO2 nanocomposite,"Co3O4@C/TiO2 composites with different content of Co3O4@C were prepared via the incipient wet impregnation method. Typically, a certain amount of Co3O4@C (1–10%) was placed in a ceramic evaporation dish, to which NMP (0.5 mL) was added, followed by the addition of ethanol absolute (0.5 mL). The mixture was homogenized via an ultrasonic bath (150 W) for 5 min. Thereafter, the corresponding amount of TiO2 (Degussa P25) was added. The mixture was homogenized for 5 min using a glass rod in an ultrasonic bath. The solvent was slowly evaporated over a hot-water bath (80 °C). The obtained powder was denoted as xCo3O4@C/TiO2, where x (1–10%) represents the weight percent of Co3O4@C in the composite."
4,Characterization techniques,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using Philips PW1700 diffractometer (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with a monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) and operating voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The XRD pattern was compared with the corresponding simulated XRD pattern using a database such as the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). Imaging using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) was studied using JSM-2100 (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions using Thermo Scientific K-Alpha (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA USA) equipped with monochromated Al Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded using the TA 60 thermal analyzer apparatus (Shimadzu, Japan) with a heating rate and airflow rate of 10 °C min−1 and 30 mL min−1, respectively. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were conducted using Evolution 220 spectrophotometers coupled with ISA-220 integrating sphere (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). The cobalt concentration was determined using flame atomic absorbance spectroscopy (FAAS, Buck model 210 VGP, Buck Scientific Inc. East Norwalk, CT, USA)."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"Photocatalytic hydrogen generation via water-splitting was carried out using a Pyrex glass reactor connected to a flow system. 50 mg of the as-prepared composites was suspended in 200 mL of aqueous methanol solution (20 vol%) as sacrificial electron donors via ultrasonication. The suspension was thoroughly purged with Ar gas (99.99%, 100 mL min–1) for 40 min to remove dissolved air, then irradiated via ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) lamp (25 W, 365 nm, NICHIA, NVMUR020A) with continuous stirring using a magnetic stirrer. The cell temperature was maintained at 25 °C during photo-irradiation. The evolved gases were analyzed at 15 min stipulated time intervals using an online gas chromatography system (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector and 80/10 Shincarbon ST packed column (2 m), and Ar gas as a carrier."
6,Recyclability experiments,"50 mg of active composite (7Co3O4@C/TiO2) was tested through 4 cycles for 20 h, according to the experimental scheme described earlier. After each cycle, the suspended photocatalyst was separated via vacuum filtration over 0.45 µm sterilized cellulose nitrate filter (Sartorius Stedium Biotech GmbH, Germany), dried at 80 °C for 12 h, resuspended in a fresh aqueous methanol solution (20 vol%) as hole scavenger, and tested for photocatalytic hydrogen generation."
7,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement,"For electrochemical characterization under light illumination, the as-prepared nanocomposite and bare TiO2 were first loaded over FTO (fluorine tin oxide conductive glass, Sigma-Aldrich, ca. 8 Ω/sq) using a drop-casting method. A 20 mg of the sample was suspended in 0.5 mL of 2-propanol using ultrasonication for 10 min. After dispersion, 50 µL of the suspension was cast over the FTO electrode (1.5 × 2 cm2). The process was repeated 2 times. The electrodes were dried in air at room temperature. The electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode rectangular quartz cell that consists of the as-prepared FTO electrode as the working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and an aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M, without pH adjustment). The solution was purged before the measurements with pure Argon gas (99.999%, 100 mL min−1) for 20 min to remove dissolved air. The working electrode was irradiated with a UV-LED lamp (25 W, 365 nm, NICHIA, NVMUR020A). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was acquired in the range from 1 V to − 1 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a potentiostat (CS350, CorrTest® Electrochemical Workstation, Wuhan, China). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry were measured under chopped light irradiation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried applying 20 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz both under the UV light irradiation and dark. The electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots were recorded at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz without light irradiation using the following equation: 1 C 2 = ± 2 e ɛ ɛ 0 A 2 N d ( E − E FB − K b T e ) Where C is the capacitance, ɛ refers to the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ɛ0 is the permittivity of free space, e is the elementary charge, A is the area, Nd is the density of dopants, E is the applied potential, EFB is the flat band potential, Kb is Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Materials characterization,"9.1 Materials characterization ZIF-67 was synthesized using the TEA-assisted approach at room temperature ( Fig. 1) [40]. RhB molecules and TEA lead to the formation of hierarchical porous ZIF-67 [40]. The resultant material was characterized using XRD (Fig. S1). The XRD pattern confirms the construction of a pure phase of ZIF-67 (Fig. S1). The thermal stability of the material was assessed using a TGA curve (Fig. S2). The TGA curve indicates that ZIF-67 has thermal stability to 450 °C (Fig. S2). Above this temperature, the ZIF-67 crystal undergoes thermal decomposition to cobalt oxide into carbon skeleton (Fig. S2). Thus, the material was carbonized at 800 °C to ensure complete conversion to the pure phase of metal oxide. The carbonized material was characterized using XRD ( Fig. 2 a) and TEM image ( Fig. 3 a). The XRD pattern of carbonized materials and simulated pattern (PDF #34–1003) are matched, ensuring the synthesis of a pure phase of cobalt oxide (Co3O4, Fig. 2 a). XRD pattern shows sharp diffraction peaks indicating the high crystallinity of the formed metal oxide. The XRD pattern shows no diffraction related to residual carbon in the carbonized material. This observation could be due to the small amount of carbon in Co3O4@C or the low crystallinity of carbon. The concentration of cobalt is 620 ppm based on FAAS analysis. The TEM image of Co3O4@C shows dark objects with particles size of 100–200 nm (Fig. 3 a). The chemical composition and the electronic state of Co3O4@C were characterized using XPS ( Fig. 4). XPS survey spectrum confirms the presence of elements Co, O, N, and C (Fig. 4 a). Data analysis indicates that the percentage of Co, N, O, and C is 15%, 4%, 53%, and 27%, respectively (Fig. 4 b). XPS approves the presence of residual carbon in the final product indicating that the carbon is amorphous. Thus, it shows no diffraction peak in XRD (Fig. 2 a). The C 1s spectrum shows peaks at a binding energy of 284.4 eV, 286.0 eV, and 288.5 eV corresponding to C—C, C—O/C—N, and O—C˭O, respectively (Fig. 4 c). The N 1s spectrum shows mainly one peak at a binding energy of 398.6 eV, referring to C—N˭C (Fig. 4 d). The O 1s spectrum shows the fitted peaks centered at binding energies of 529.1 eV and 531.5 eV attributed to Co3O4, and C˭O, respectively (Fig. 4 e). XPS spectrum for Co 2p shows peaks at binding energies of 794.4 eV and 779.1 eV corresponding to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 4 f). The difference between the spin-orbit splitting of the two peaks is 15.3 eV matching the values reported in the literature for Co3O4 (15.1–15.6 eV) [41]. This observation indicates that Co3O4 is the mixed-valence of Co2+ and Co3+ . The Co 2p profile of Co3O4 is fitted into six peaks, including two pairs of spin-orbit doublets for the co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ (Fig. 4 f). Two peaks at binding energies of 788.5 eV and 803.7 eV are also observed, referring to satellites (denoted as ""sat"") at higher binding energies (Fig. 4 f). The XPS analysis reveals the successful synthesis of Co3O4 embedded into a nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton (Fig. 4). The X-ray pattern for Co3O4@C/TiO2 was reported (Fig. 2 b). XRD pattern confirms the presence of a mixture of Co3O4@C and TiO2 (Fig. 2 b). TEM image of Co3O4@C/TiO2 reveals the presence of dark particle and gray color particles corresponding to Co3O4@C and TiO2, respectively (Fig. 3 b). HR-TEM image shows a lattice fringe 0.48 nm (calculated lattice fringes is 0.485 nm) corresponding to plane with Miller index of (111) for Co3O4 (Fig. 3 c). Inverted fast Fourier transform shows lattice fringes of 0.49 nm corresponding to plane with Miller index of (111) (Fig. 3 d)."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation via water splitting,9.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation via water splitting The photocatalytic performance toward the water splitting of Co3O4@C was tested after combination with TiO2 semiconductor. A homemade system consisting of a Pyrex reactor and a light source in conjugation with a GC-TCD is used. The reactor is connected to the gas cylinder of argon. The gas produced from the reactor is transferred to the GC-TCD instrument for gas analysis. The photocatalytic water splitting efficiency and hydrogen-generation rate (HGR) using Co3O4@C/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5. The un-doped TiO2 shows a nominal hydrogen generation rate (Fig. 5). The low hydrogen generation rate of pure TiO2 is due to fast charge recombination. The low photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be enhanced after loading Co3O4@C. There is a significant increase in the HGR with the rise of Co3O4@C loading in the Co3O4@C/TiO2 (Fig. 5 a). The rate of H2 production is nearly linear within the reaction time of 1–5 h. The HGR reaches the maximum value at a loading weight percentage of 7 wt% (Fig. 5 a). There is no significant increase in the HGR value above 7 wt% (Fig. 5 a). The cumulative and initial HGR are plotted in Fig. 5 b. TiO2 with a loading weight of 7 wt% of Co3O4@C exhibits increasing 75-fold in the initial HGR and 110-fold in cumulative HGR of TiO2 (Fig. 5 b).
11,Photoelectrochemical and optical properties: mechanism of photocatalysis,"9.3 Photoelectrochemical and optical properties: mechanism of photocatalysis The electrochemical measurements, such as CV, LSV, EIS, can be used to evaluate electrical properties in photocatalytic hydrogen production using Co3O4@C/TiO2 as a catalyst. The electrochemical independence spectroscopy (EIS) using Nyquist plots were reported under the dark condition and UV light (λmax = 365 nm), the Mott- Schottky plots (Fig. S3), and bandgap (Fig. S4) were reported ( Fig. 6). The redox behavior of TiO2 and Co3O4@C/TiO2 is compared using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 6 a. CV curve of TiO2 shows prominent peaks at potentials − 0.996 V Vs. Ag/AgCl standard electrode (Fig. 6 a). It shows mainly anodic peak because TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor (Fig. 6 a). Therefore, the anodic potential of TiO2 in the negative direction is relatively large compared to the cathodic current in the reverse direction anodic currents. CV curve of Co3O4@C/TiO2 exhibits almost double the reduction current density than pure TiO2, that signify the higher catalytic activity of the prepared composite (Fig. 6 a). The difference can be observed in linear scan voltammetry (Fig. 6 b). These observations indicate that there is an electronic overlap between Co3O4@C and TiO2. EIS measurements using Nyquist plots of both photocatalysts Co3O4@C/TiO2 and TiO2 in the dark and under light (λmax of 365 nm) were reported to characterize the charge transfer properties of photocatalysts (Fig. 6 c-d). The arc size reflects the charge transfer resistance of the photogenerated charge carrier (e-/h+) hence the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This observation is because the electronic excitation/emission process of TiO2 under light irradiation facilitates electron transfer. Thus, it decreases the electronic resistance. Co3O4@C/TiO2 shows an arc with the smallest radius than pure TiO2, implying that Co3O4@C/TiO2 undergoes the fastest interfacial electron transfer compared to TiO2 alone. The electronic resistance of Co3O4@C/TiO2 is decreased than that of pure TiO2 (as indicated by the smaller impedance arc radius). There is a further decrease under light radiation (λmax, 365 nm) due to light excitation. The small radius of the semi-circle in the Nyquist plots confirms the reduced interfacial charge transfer resistance of TiO2 for the Co3O4@C/TiO2 heterojunction (Fig. 6 c-d). The decrease in the electronic resistance is due to the formation of an electronic junction between Co3O4@C and TiO2, enhancing the separation and migration of photoinduced carriers. Thus, Co3O4@C/TiO2 exhibits high photocatalytic activity compared to TiO2 (Fig. 5). Chronoamperometry (photocurrent response) of TiO2 and 7Co3O4@C/TiO2 in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under UV light (λmax = 365 nm) at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl was reported as shown in Fig. 7 a. Photocurrent response curves of TiO2 and Co3O4@C/TiO2 based electrodes with UV light (λmax = 365 nm) switching on/off are used to evaluate the electronic interaction among Co3O4@C and TiO2 (Fig. 7 a). Pure TiO2 shows a relatively slow photocurrent response due to the fast recombination of the hole-electron pair (Fig. 7 a). Co3O4@C prompts reversible photocurrent responses for each on-off cycle of TiO2. The ""vertical"" change between on and off for each cycle for Co3O4@C/TiO2 reveals that the separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is increased due to the heterostructure built between Co3O4@C and TiO2. It is worthy of note that the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) of Co3O4@C/TiO2 is higher than that of the TiO2 electrodes (Fig. 7 a). The photocurrent density of Co3O4@C/TiO2 is ~4-fold higher than that of the TiO2 (Fig. 7 a). The photocurrent of the Co3O4@C/TiO2 electrode maintains relative stability after five on-off light cycles (Fig. 7 a). The decrease in the photocurrent of Co3O4@C/TiO2 could be due to the presence of carbon in the Co3O4@C co-catalyst. DRS spectra of TiO2, Co3O4@C, Co3O4@C/TiO2 with weight percentages 7 wt% and 10 wt% were reported (Fig. 7 b). TiO2 is considered a UV-active photocatalyst that absorbs wavelength less than 320 nm. On another side, Co3O4@C shows a broad absorbance over a wide wavelength (200–800 nm). This observation is mainly due to the presence of nitrogen-doped carbon. The DRS spectrum of Co3O4 without carbon exhibits a broad absorbance with maximum absorption at 200 nm (Fig. 7 b). Co3O4@C/TiO2 with weight percentage loading 7 wt% of Co3O4@C exhibited higher absorbance than pure TiO2 with a slight redshift. In contrast, Co3O4@C/TiO2 with weight percentage loading 10 wt% of Co3O4@C showed a subtle blue shift relative to the 7 wt% sample and almost identical compared to pure TiO2. This observation is due to the shielding effect. The bandgap calculated from the KM function of TiO2, 7Co3O4@C/TiO2, and 10Co3O4@C/TiO2 was 3 eV, 2.89 eV, and 2.91 eV, respectively ( Figs. 8 a, S4). These results are aligned with HGR experiments where the hydrogen generation starts to decline with increasing the amount of Co3O4@C in the composite higher than 7 wt%. This could be attributed to a higher loading percentage over 7 wt% prevents light from interacting with TiO2. This effect leads to a decrease in the material's performance, as hinted in Fig. 5. The N element presence in ZIF-67 after carbonization would reduce the energy band gap of TiO2. All the previous observations can be used to draw a plausible mechanism using 7Co3O4@C/TiO2, as shown in Fig. 8. Water splitting reaction via photocatalysis using pure TiO2 consists mainly of three steps (Eqs. (1)–(4)): 1) the semiconductor TiO2 photocatalyst (bandgap (E g ) = 3 eV, Fig. S4) absorbs light to produce electron-hole pairs; subsequently, 2) the electron-hole pair is separated and migrated to the material surface, and finally 3) the photogenerated charge carriers participate in water splitting reduction-oxidation reactions into H2 and O2 (Fig. 8). Co3O4@C is considered as a p-type semiconductor with a narrow Eg of ~1.52 eV (Fig. S4) [42]. It acts as an effective electron acceptor (Fig. 8). The flat band potential and bandgap of TiO2 and Co3O4@C are summarized from electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots and DRS measurements, respectively (Figs. S3-S4). The positive slope can be assigned to n-type and the negative to the p-type semiconductors. The measured flat band potential of TiO2 and Co3O4@C were − 0.16 V and − 0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The VB and CB position versus vacuum of TiO2 were calculated to be − 7.75 and − 4.75, while for Co3O4@C was − 5.8 and − 4.28 V, respectively (Fig. 8 b) [43]. The heterojunction formed at the interface between TiO2 and Co3O4@C could be regarded as Type II semiconductor heterostructure. This type of heterojunction assures spontaneous electron transport in the prepared composite. Hence, the photogenerated electrons with higher energy in Co3O4@C would transfer through the interface to the surface of the TiO2 photocatalyst. Furthermore, this was confirmed by the charge transfer resistance measurements through the EIS technique, which approves the higher electrical conductivity of the prepared Co3O4@C/TiO2 composite (Fig. 6 c-d). Same observations were also reported for CdS/Pt-N-TiO2, in which the flow of electrons from Pt to the valence band of CdS was suggested [10]. We expected the same process could also be recommended here since the carbon skeleton contains N-sites. Based on XPS (Fig. 4 b), the atomic ratio of Co: N: C is 4:1:7 (Fig. 4 b). Nitrogen-doped carbon plays a role in the catalytic performance of Co3O4@C. A comparison between Co3O4 with and without C is shown in Fig. 9 a. The initial and cumulative HGRs using Co3O4/TiO2 are 56% and 60% lower than Co3O4@C/TiO2. These observations ensure the significant role of N-doped carbon in the catalytic performance of co-catalyst Co3O4@C. (1) Co3O4@C/TiO2 + hν→Co3O4@C/TiO2 (e- + h+) (2) Co3O4@C/TiO2 (e- + h+)→Co3O4@C/TiO2 (3) H2O + h+→1/2O2 + 2H+ (4) 2H+ + 2e-→H2"
12,Recyclability of Co3O4@C/TiO2,"Recyclability of Co3O4@C/TiO2 using 7 wt% of Co3O4@C was tested, as shown in Fig. 9 b. The catalyst can be used for more than 4 cycles without significant loss of the material's performance. This character ensures the high potential of the synthesised material to serve as a photocatalyst for large-scale industrial production of hydrogen via water splitting. A summary of some TiO2-based photocatalyst is tabulated in Table 1. Co3O4@C can act as a co-catalyst, promoting the charge separation of TiO2 and providing active centers for proton reduction. Brookite TiO2 nanoflutes decorated with Pt nanoparticles showed HGR of 9800 ± 0.6 μmol g−1 h−1, which was more than 12-fold compared toTiO2-based photocatalyst [44]. Another heterostructure of CuO/TiO2 exhibited an HGR of ~0.04 mmol h−1, which was 20 times higher than that of TiO2 nanosheets [11]. Co3O4@C/TiO2 with optimal loading weight of Co3O4@C (7 wt%) exhibits a 75-fold and 110-fold increase for the cumulative and initial rate, respectively, in the catalytic performance of TiO2 compared to pure TiO2. It also showed a high HGR compared to other systems, such as Co3O4 quantum dots (QDs)/TiO2 nanobelts [12], Co3O4-Pt/TiO2 [45], and CoO x -TiO2/CdS [46] (Table 1). Co3O4@C has been applied as a co-catalyst for enhancing the photocatalytic water splitting of TiO2 with the potential to further improvements. The synthesis procedure of Co3O4@C is also simple and requires no particular instrument or apparatus (Table 1). The synthesis requires only two simple steps, including stirring at room temperature and carbonization at 800 °C."
13,Conclusions,"By introducing a small amount of carbonized ZIF-67 (Co3O4@C) onto TiO2, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates can be significantly enhanced. Co3O4@C/TiO2 photocatalyst composite exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate when TiO2 coupled with 7 wt% Co3O4@C co-catalyst. The developed photocatalyst composite is considered noble metal-free. Co3O4@C/TiO2 (Co3O4@C, 7 wt%) offered 75-fold and 110-fold improvement for the cumulative and initial rate, respectively, compared to pure TiO2. The photocurrent density of Co3O4@C/TiO2 is ~4-fold higher than that of pure TiO2. This observation suggested that Co3O4@C can separate/collect the photogenerated electrons, consequently reducing the photogenerated electrons' recombination rate and holes. Co3O4@C plays a vital role in improving the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons/holes. Co3O4@C is a superior co-catalyst with low cost and high efficiency."
