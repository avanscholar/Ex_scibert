0,Introduction,"There is a need for clean, renewable energy, because of the increasing energy demand and global warming that is associated with the increasing use of fossil fuels. Renewable energy can be derived, for example, from biological production of hydrogen and methane gases. Hydrogen is considered a more valuable energy source since methane has only 42% of the energy content of hydrogen [1] and the only side-product in the combustion of hydrogen is water [2]. Dark fermentative hydrogen production is beneficial since it results in high hydrogen production rates and it can utilize cellulosic wastes [3,4]. Industry and agriculture generate huge amounts of cellulosic wastes and by-products that are potential energy resources [5,6] and amenable to hydrogen production [2,3,7]. Anaerobic digestion is widely used for biogas production, but the same process can also be used for hydrogen production if the methanogenesis is inhibited. This can be done with different pretreatments (for a review, see [8]), from which the most common and effective pretreatment has been heat-treating the cultures at 100 °C for 15 min [8]. Heat treatment kills or suppresses methanogens and selects for spore-forming, hydrogen-producing bacteria such as Clostridia [3]. The composition of microorganisms can also be controlled by pH [9] and/or by temperature [10]. Hydrogen production from carbohydrates is usually associated with acetate or butyrate formation. The theoretical production maximum is 4 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 with acetate as the sole by-product, while with butyrate formation only 2 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 is produced [11]. In practice, hydrogen production through dark fermentation can only convert 30% of the energy content of the substrate to hydrogen [7], whilst the rest is converted to volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols. Hydrogen production as well as cellulose degradation is affected by several factors, such as initial and final pH, temperature, feedback inhibition by end-products, and substrate type and concentration [12]. Decreases in pH can inhibit cellulose degradation through control of hydrogenase activity and the metabolic pathways [4]. Dark fermentation has been studied with mesophiles (30–40 °C) and thermophiles (40–65 °C). High temperatures have many advantages over lower ones: (i) gases have lower solubility at higher temperatures (Henry’s law), (ii) the hydrogen synthesis pathways are less affected by the partial pressure of hydrogen (pH2) [11]; (iii) the rates of chemical and enzymatic reactions are higher [13]; and (iv) high temperature wastewaters could be directly used without cooling. On the other hand, elevated temperatures require higher energy input, which is acceptable if process heat is available [12] or if high temperature process wastewaters, such as forest industry wastewaters (for a review, see [6]) or food processing wastewaters [14], are used for hydrogen production. High hydrogen yields have already been reported with thermophilic microorganisms obtained, for example, from hot spring [15], anaerobic digester sludge [16], wastewater treatment plant [17], and cow dung [18]. Cow rumen contains microorganisms that can degrade cellulose at high rate. The temperature and pH of cow rumen are 39 °C and near neutral, respectively, and the solid retention time is at the highest 72 h. Because of the low retention time methane fermentation from acetate does not occur, whilst some methane may be produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide [19]. Our researchers have previously studied hydrogen production with thermophilic microorganisms derived from hot springs [20,21] and from a geothermally active underground mine [22]. However, it would be more feasible to obtain hydrogen producers from local origins. The aim of this work was to enrich fermentative hydrogen producers from rumen fluid at elevated temperatures (52, 60 and 65 °C). Three sequential inoculations to new medium were done to study the progress of enrichment of hydrogen producing and cellulose degrading microorganisms. Cellulose was used as substrate and the effects of different heat treatments of rumen fluid cultures on hydrogen production potential and microbial communities were examined. In addition, the effects of pH and temperature on hydrogen production potential were studied with the most efficient H2 producing enrichment. To the authors knowledge the effect of heat pretreatment on H2 producing microbial communities has only been reported few times [23,24] and never for rumen fluid cultures."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed microorganisms,"2.1 Seed microorganisms Rumen fluid inoculum obtained from a fistulated cow (MTT Agrofood Research Institute, Jokioinen, Finland) was enriched for fermentative hydrogen production. In the first enrichment step, the ratio of inoculum (5.7% volatile solids (VS)) and substrate (w/w) was set to 1:2. Prior to addition to the medium, the liquid part of rumen fluid was diluted with 1×PBS-solution (10×PBS-solution has 10.9 g L−1 Na2HPO4, 3.2 g L−1 NaH2PO4 · H2O, and 90 g L−1 NaCl)."
3,Batch enrichment of thermophilic H2 -producing microorganisms,"2.2 Batch enrichment of thermophilic H2 -producing microorganisms The microbial enrichments were incubated at 52, 60 and 65 °C. The microbial cultures were manipulated in the following ways: (i) no pretreatment (NHT), (ii) heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min (HT1), and (iii) heat treatment at 100 °C for 10 min (HT2). Duplicate samples were pretreated and two control bottles without the addition of substrate were prepared for each temperature. The first enrichments were conducted in 25 mL anaerobic tubes with a working volume of 10 mL to achieve efficient heat treatment. The following two enrichment phases were done in 120 mL serum bottles with 50 mL working volume and with 2% (v/v) inoculum from the previous enrichment phase. The enrichments at 52 and 60 °C were incubated on a shaker (150 rpm), while the enrichments at 65 °C were done under static conditions because of practical reasons. The enrichment medium was DSMZ 144 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 2008) with the following modifications: 5 g L−1 cellulose (Sigmacell Cellulose, Type 20) was used instead of glucose, no tryptone was used and yeast extract concentration was decreased to 0.3 g L−1. Headspace in the serum bottles was made anaerobic with N2 and sterile cellulose, vitamin solution and Na2S·9H2O were aseptically added to the medium from stock solutions after sterilization of the medium. Gas production was monitored regularly and VFAs and alcohols were analyzed in the end of the enrichments."
4,Temperature-gradient experiment,"2.3 Temperature-gradient experiment The temperature dependency of H2 production by the enriched rumen fluid culture (NHT, 60 °C) was determined with a temperature-gradient incubator (Test Tube Oscillator, Terratec). The temperature gradient was set from 45 to 75 °C and duplicate samples were used. The culture was grown in 25 mL anaerobic tubes with 10 mL working volume and 10% (v/v) inoculum. The cellulose supplementation was 2.5 g L−1 and mixing was at 60 oscillations min−1. Gas production was measured daily and end-point VFAs and alcohols were analyzed."
5,Effect of pH on hydrogen production,"2.4 Effect of pH on hydrogen production The effect of pH on hydrogen production by the rumen fluid enrichment (NHT, 60 °C) was studied with initial pH from 5.2 to 7.3 The pH experiment was done in triplicate in 60 mL serum bottles with 25 mL working volume and 10% (v/v) inoculum. The pH of the medium was first adjusted with K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, and after purging the medium with nitrogen the pH was adjusted to the desired value with HCl or NaOH. The concentration of cellulose was kept low at 1.0 g L−1 to prevent high acid production and the bottles were mixed (150 rpm). Gas production was analyzed five times a week, pH three times a week from one of the triplicate bottles and VFA and alcohol concentrations were determined from the end-points."
6,Chemical analyses,"2.5 Chemical analyses The overpressure from the batch bottles was analyzed according to Owen et al. [25]. The gas composition (H2, CH4 and CO2) in the headspace was analyzed with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-2014 equipped with Porapak N column (80/100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperatures of oven, injector and detector were 80, 110 and 110 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The gas volumes were corrected to a standard pressure (760 mm Hg) and temperature (0 °C), and cumulative H2 production was calculated according to Logan et al. [1]. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids and alcohols were analyzed with Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column (Showa Denko K.K., Japan) and a refraction index detector (Shimadzu). Mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 and flow rate 0.7 mL min−1. Samples for HPLC were pretreated with a solid phase extraction (SPE) method modified from Horspool and McKellar [26]. The cartridge was preconditioned with 2 mL methanol and 2 mL 0.01 M HCl (pH 2), and the VFAs and alcohols were eluted from the sorbent with 1.75 mL 0.05 M PBS. Cellulose degradation was calculated based on formed COD in the end of each enrichment phase. COD was calculated as a sum of degradation products and produced hydrogen according to Eq. (1) [27]. (1) COD = 8 × ( 4 x + y − 2 z ) / ( 12 x + y + 16 z ) g COD / g C x H y O z"
7,Microbial community analyses,"2.6 Microbial community analyses Bacterial communities were determined using DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction – Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. Duplicate samples were taken at the end of each enrichment phase and stored at −20 °C. DNA was extracted with a VIOGENE Blood and Tissue Genomic DNA kit (Proteogenix SA, Fegersheim, France). Partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using a primer pair GC-BacV3f and 907r as previously described by Koskinen et al. [28], only exception being that PCR was done with T3000 Thermocycler (Biometra). DGGE was performed with INGENYphorU2 × 2 –system (Ingeny International BV, GP Goes, The Netherlands) as described by Koskinen et al. [28] with following exceptions: denaturing gradient from 30% to 70% was used, gels were run with 100 V for 22.5 h, and dominant bands were eluted in 20 μL of sterile H2O. The re-amplification of bands for sequencing was done as described by Koskinen et al. [28]. Sequence data were analyzed with Bioedit-software (version 7.0.5) and compared with sequences in GenBank (http://www.ncb.nlm.nih.gov/blast/)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Enrichment of rumen fluid culture,"3.1 Enrichment of rumen fluid culture Enrichment of hydrogen producers from rumen fluid culture was successful at 60 °C (Fig. 1 ). At 52 °C hydrogen was produced only in the first enrichment phases (Fig. 1), while no hydrogen was produced at 65 °C. The incubation under static conditions was not a likely reason for the absence of the hydrogen production. In control bottles (without substrate) hydrogen was produced only in the first enrichment phase, and these H2 yields were subtracted from the yields obtained with cellulose. No methane was produced in any of the enrichment phase even in the NHT cultivations, which was most likely due to the decrease in pH (below 6.5) during the enrichments. Most methanogens remain active at pH between 6.8 and 7.5 [2]. At 60 °C, the cumulative hydrogen production with HT2 decreased in the second and third enrichment phases. The highest hydrogen yields at 60 °C with NHT and HT1 enrichments were 71 and 53 mL-H2 g-cellulose−1 corresponding to 0.44 and 0.32 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 and 1.93 and 1.91 mol-H2 mol-hexose-degraded−1, respectively. The highest hydrogen yields were similar to the results reported for cow dung microflora from cellulose at 55 °C (0.45 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1) [29]. The results show that the rumen fluid culture without heat treatment resulted in higher hydrogen yields and hydrogen production rates than the heat-treated cultures. Lin and Hung [29] reported two times higher H2 production without HT than with HT, while in this study the hydrogen production was 1.3 times higher without HT. The VFA and alcohol concentrations at the end of the enrichment phases (at 52 and 60 °C) were as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. The VFA and alcohol concentrations in control bottles (1st enrichment phase) were subtracted from the results obtained with cellulose since the rumen fluid inoculum contained also soluble cellulose degradation products. The production of total VFAs was lower at 52 than at 60 °C. During sequential enrichments at 52 and 60 °C, the total VFAs decreased and increased, respectively. In rumen fluid cultures at 52 °C the soluble degradation products remained low after the 1st enrichment phase. In the 1st enrichment phase at 52 °C, the main degradation products were butyrate and lactate with NHT and HT1 cultures, and butyrate, acetate and lactate with HT2 cultivation. The low soluble metabolite concentrations and low H2 yields likely resulted from poor degradation of cellulose (Fig. 2 ). At 60 °C, the main soluble metabolites of the NHT and HT1 enrichments were acetate and ethanol, with smaller amounts lactate. However, lactate was the main metabolite in the HT2 enrichment (60 °C). Lactate production is associated with low H2 yields [11] and therefore it was a likely reason for the lower hydrogen yields obtained with the HT2 culture. High hydrogen yields are usually associated with a mixture of acetate and butyrate production [11]. However, negligible amounts of butyrate were present in the end of rumen fluid cultivations. In addition to acetate, ethanol was the main degradation product in NHT and HT1 enrichments (60 °C). Alcohol production is also associated with lower H2 yields since it consumes protons from hydrogen production [12]. However, ethanol is a high energy product that could be produced simultaneously with hydrogen [30,31]. Lin and Hung [29] also reported that high ethanol production with cow dung culture at 55 °C was associated with high acetate and butyrate production. Non-heat-treated culture was shown to produce more ethanol than culture with HT [29] which was in agreement with our results. Cellulose degradation (Fig. 2) in the end of enrichment phases was calculated by determining the initial and final COD concentrations based on the added cellulose and produced hydrogen and soluble degradation products. Cellulose degradation at 52 °C was highest in the 1st enrichment phase, after which it decreased considerably, whereas at 60 °C the cellulose degradation increased during sequential enrichment phases. The highest cellulose degradation (20.8%) was obtained at 60 °C with NHT enrichment. However, cellulose degradation remained low in all the enrichments leading to low H2 yields. During the enrichment cultivations the pH in the batch bottles was not adjusted and it dropped to below 6.5, which might have slowed down or inhibited cellulose degrading micoorganisms. Hu et al. [32] studied the effect of pH on cellulose degradation and reported that the highest cellulose degradation (75%) was obtained at pH values between 6.8 and 7.3, while at lower pHs the cellulose degradation decreased considerably. Furthermore, the solubilization of cellulose by rumen microorganisms has been shown to depend on the presence of sterilized, clarified rumen fluid [5,33,34] that provides nutrients. When sterilized rumen fluid (20% v/v) was added to the medium the cellulose solubilization was 97%, while it was 78% without the rumen fluid [34]. In addition, Caldwell and Bryant [33] tested a medium without added rumen fluid for isolation of rumen bacteria and reported that without trypticase, yeast extract and VFA mixture (that was used instead of the rumen fluid) the colony counts reduced considerably. Thus, the low hydrogen yields were likely due to the lack of some essential nutrients resulting in low solubilization of cellulose. However, it would not be feasible to add sterilized rumen fluid in large scale applications. If rumen fluid microorganisms were used for hydrogen production at 60 °C, it would be feasible to degrade cellulosic substrate before feeding it into the H2 reactor. This could be done, e.g., by using cellulolytic microorganisms in a separate reactor [35]."
10,Microbial communities,"3.2 Microbial communities The effect of different heat treatments on microbial communities grown at 52 and 60 °C were analyzed by PCR-DGGE followed by band sequencing (Fig. 3 , Table 3 ). The main bacteria were related to Clostridium sp., including Clostridium stercorarium subsp. leptospartum, C. stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum, and Clostridium caenicola. In addition, some uncultured Clostridium species, uncultured Symbiobacterium sp. and Symbiobacterium thermophilum were present both at 52 and 60 °C. Both C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum and C. stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum are thermophilic, cellulolytic microorganisms that produce acetate and ethanol as their main fermentation products. C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum grows optimally at 60 °C and at pH 7.5, while the optimal temperature and pH of C. stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum are 60–65 °C and 7.0, respectively [36]. Furthermore, C. stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum produces hydrogen from lactose [37]. C. caenicola is a thermophile that produces hydrogen, lactate, acetate and ethanol from cellobiose. The optimum growth conditions of C. caenicola are 60 °C and pH 6.5 [38]. Both 52 and 60 °C enrichments had some similar bacterial species. However, hydrogen production at 52 °C was negligible, while hydrogen was produced at 60 °C with every heat treatment and every enrichment. At both temperatures, strong bands (2, 3, 4 and 6) representing C. stercorarium were present. However, the main degradation products of C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum, acetate and ethanol, were only present at 60 °C suggesting reduced activity of C. stercorarium at 52 °C. Furthermore, Bacillus thermozeamaize (band 13) and C. caenicola (band 8) dominate at 60 and 52 °C, respectively. At 52 °C some cellulose was degraded, but H2 yields remained negligible. B. thermozeamaize that was present at 60 °C has been isolated from light corn steep liquor. It remains unclear whether B. thermozeamaize was associated with cellulose degradation and/or hydrogen production. The presence of thermophiles has been reported before in cow waste slurry [7] and undiluted cow dung [18]. Yokoyama et al. [7] reported that at 60 °C the two main hydrogen producers were C. stercorarium and Clostridium thermocellum. At 75 °C and 60 °C with undiluted cow dung hydrogen production was associated with Caldanaerobacter subterraneus and cellulolytic Clostridium cellulosi, respectively [18]. The 52 °C enrichments had considerably more bands than those of 60 °C. The heat treatments of 52 °C cultures decreased number of bands, while at 60 °C they were similar regardless of the applied heat treatment. At 60 °C, the number of bands decreased during the enrichments, which was less significant in the 52 °C enrichments. Yokoyama et al. [7] suggested that thermophiles in cow waste slurry cultivated at 60 and 75 °C survived in cow rumen at 39 °C by forming spores. Thus, our results suggest that microorganisms in 60 °C enrichments consisted mainly of spore formers. This would also explain the small differences in microbial communities between different heat treatments. However, the highest H2 yield was obtained at 60 °C without heat-treatment. This could be explained by metabolic differences as seen in the VFA profiles (Table 2). In NHT enrichments, acetate and butyrate were the main degradation products with small amounts of lactate. In HT1 enrichments the relative amount of lactate increased, while in the 2nd enrichment of HT2 culture lactate was the main fermentation product. Thus, the different VFA profiles suggest that although the same microorganisms were present, different species predominated after different heat treatments."
11,Effect of temperature on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of temperature on hydrogen production The effect of temperature on hydrogen production by the rumen fluid enrichment (NHT, 60 °C) was studied in the temperature range from 45 to 75 °C (Fig. 4 ). At temperatures under 50 °C and over 70 °C the rumen fluid enrichment did not produce hydrogen. The hydrogen production rate was highest at 62 °C (0.23 mL-H2 d−1), while the highest hydrogen yield was obtained at 60 °C (0.14 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1) with a longer lag time. At 66.4 °C, hydrogen production had a lag period of 5 days, while at other temperatures where hydrogen was produced the lag time was below two days. The optimum temperatures of diluted and undiluted cow dung for H2 production have been reported to be 60 and 75 °C [7] and 60 °C [18], respectively. Both studies concluded that hydrogen production significantly increased at temperatures over 50 °C as it did in our study, which was associated with methane production at temperatures under and at 50 °C. However, no methane was produced during our experiments. Bacterial community results indicate that C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum was the main cellulose degrader and H2 producer in the 60 °C cultivations. The optimum temperature of C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum is 60 °C, which is very close to the optimum temperature for H2 production reported here."
12,Effect of pH on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of pH on hydrogen production The effect of pH (initial pH from 5.2 to 7.3) on hydrogen production by the rumen fluid enrichment was analyzed with the 60 °C NHT rumen fluid culture as it had the highest H2 yields. H2 production was negligible at pH 6.0 and below (Table 4 ). At pH 6.4 and 6.9 the H2 production rates were low when compared to the highest H2 production rate of 9.5 mL-H2 d−1 at initial pH 7.3. In addition, the total amount of soluble degradation products was highest at the highest initial pH of 7.3 showing higher cellulose degradation. The amount of soluble degradation products increased with increasing pH and the VFA and alcohol profiles changed considerably with the pH. At pH 6.0 and below, ethanol production was predominant with some acetate and butyrate production. At initial pH of 6.9 and 7.3, acetate was the main degradation product with relatively high ethanol concentrations. The H2 production rate was considerably higher at the highest pH. During the enrichments, H2 yields could have been increased by adjusting the pH during the experiments since it dropped below 6.5 during the incubations. For example, Yokoyama et al. [7] reported neutral pH optimal for hydrogen production with cow waste slurry at 60 or 75 °C. In addition, Lin and Hung [29] studied cellulose utilization at pH 7.5 with a cow dung enrichment and reported a peak hydrogen production (0.50 mol-H2 mol-hexose−1). High H2 production in their experiment was accompanied with high ethanol production (1.0 mol-EtOH mol-hexose−1). This was in disagreement with this study, where the ethanol concentrations usually decreased with increasing H2 yields. However, during the enrichments hydrogen production was accompanied with high ethanol yields. Lin and Hung [29] also concluded that even a pH change of 0.5 units from the optimal pH decreased the hydrogen production with 20%. In our experiments a small pH change from 7.3 to 6.9 decreased the H2 yields by over 80%. We obtained considerably higher H2 yields in the pH experiments than during enrichments. This may be because the relative amount of inoculae (10%) was higher than during the enrichments (2%). In addition, cellulose concentration was low (1 g L−1) in pH experiments to decrease the pH changes caused by VFA production. During the enrichments the used cellulose concentration was considerably higher (5 g L−1). Levin et al. [39] reported before that with increasing cellulose concentrations the H2 yields decreased. Thus, low cellulose concentration seems to increase the H2 yields by the rumen fluid enrichment, which might be associated with lower decrease in pH."
13,Conclusions,"Thermophilic, cellulolytic, hydrogen producing microorganisms can be enriched from rumen fluid. Heat pretreatments of rumen fluid enrichments do not increase hydrogen production. The highest H2 yields are obtained at 60 °C without heat treatment of the enrichments, while at 52 °C hydrogen production is negligible. The optimum temperature and pH of the best rumen fluid enrichment are 62 °C and 7.3, respectively. Production of soluble metabolites is highly affected by pH. At pH 6.0 and below ethanol production dominates and no hydrogen is produced, while at higher pH of 7.3 hydrogen yields are the highest with simultaneous acetate and ethanol production. Hydrogen production is mainly associated with Clostridium species. At 52 °C, the bacterial diversity is considerably higher than at 60 °C and is decreased with heat treatments. At 60 °C, the bacterial diversity is not dependent on heat treatments, but it decreases during the enrichments. Bacteria closely related to C. stercorarium subsp. leptospartum are mainly associated with cellulose degradation and hydrogen production at 60 °C."
