0,Introduction,"The graphene revolution has induced a clear demand on alternative production routes to the mechanical exfoliation technique that popularized it in 2004 [1]. Although the ease of the exfoliation technique allowed its fast implementation in research laboratories worldwide, the low throughput represented a serious drawback in view of industrial applications. The epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC [2] and the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons on highly crystalline metal surfaces like Ru(0001) [3] and Ir(111) [4] have been explored to synthesize graphene films. Without doubt the most popular alternative production route saw the light in 2009 when the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of graphene was reported using polycrystalline nickel as a catalyst and methane as a carbon source [5,6]. Later that same year, Ruoff’s group published the synthesis using commercial copper foils [7] and elucidated the different mechanisms involved in the synthesis either with Ni or Cu using carbon isotope labeling and Raman spectroscopy [8]. The synthesis technique relies on the decomposition of methane at ∼1000°C and low pressure and its deposition on the metal catalysts. In the case of Ni, where C solubility is high, the mechanism of growth is through the segregation and precipitation of C once Ni is cooled down; in contrast, C solubility in Cu is low and the growth is mediated by surface adsorption [8]. Carbon in the three phases (gas, liquid and solid) has been used to produce graphene catalyzed by copper: as a gas in methane [5–7] and ethylene [4]; as a solid in polymers (poly methyl methacrylate, PMMA), sugar [9] and, basically, anything solid containing carbon [10]; and as a liquid in hexane, benzene and alcohols [11–13]. The above listed precursors are used in experiments at low pressure conditions (mTorr) and generally gases of 100% concentration of Ar, CH4 and H2 are involved in the synthesis, which require a sophisticated set-up with pumping system, the availability of 2–3 gas lines, several flow meters, and proper stainless steel piping for H2 and CH4 for safety reasons, since both gases are highly flammable. Recent communications have reported on the synthesis of graphene at atmospheric pressures [14,15]. Dong and coauthors [14] used ethanol and pentane as carbon sources and although no low pressure is involved, two gas lines: Ar and Ar–H2, are needed and the H2 concentration is rather high (20%). Vlassiouk and co-workers [15] use a very diluted mixture hydrogen during synthesis (2.5%), however, methane is still preferred as source of carbon which implies the need of two gas inlets. The CVD synthesis of large-area bi-layer graphene has been addressed by several groups in the literature: S. Lee et al. [16] were able to grow bi-layer graphene from CH4 at low pressures, K. Yan et al. [17] use a two-step process to produce Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene using low pressures and CH4 and H2, while J.K. Wassei et al. [18] explore the production of bilayer graphene with ethane (C2H6) and H2 at low pressures. Raman spectroscopy constitutes a powerful tool to characterize graphene since it allows the identification of single layer graphene thanks to its unique fingerprint, where the G′ band (∼2700cm−1) presents a very large intensity compared to that of the G band (∼1580cm−1) exhibiting line width values of around 30cm−1. In addition, this spectroscopy technique allows as well the quantification of the number of layers in Bernal-stacked few-layer graphene [19]. The present Letter presents a methodological advantage to the synthesis of graphene by atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) which is, by itself, a simplification of more common CVD setups. Current CVD methods reported in the literature [5–15] rely on the availability of vacuum systems, several gas input lines to deliver Ar, H2 and CH4 (or at least two of the above) to the CVD reactor. Besides, safety hazards should be considered along with the use of flammable gases like CH4 and H2 or even Ar–H2 mixtures with high H2 concentration. Our approach relies on a simple ambient pressure set-up equipped with a single gas inlet (a gas mixture of Ar–H2 with a very diluted concentration of H2 (5%)) and the use of alcohols as carbon precursors. The produced carbon-based materials have been characterized using a combination of tools including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis We use commercial Cu foils of 25μm in thickness purchased from Advent Research Materials Ltd with purity of 99.9%. The received foils of 0.025×100×100mm were cut into pieces of 1cm2 and then mildly cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The foils were fit to a combustion boat further placed inside an alumina tube in a tubular furnace. As a carbon source we used two alcohols: 2-phenylethanol and ethanol (Sigma–Aldrich). A diagram illustrating the set-up is depicted in Figure 1 . This configuration allows us to split one gas inlet in two paths by means of glass valves: one for heating, annealing and cooling down (P1); and a second one for the actual graphene growth (P2). The synthesis temperature is set to 980 or 990°C in the tubular furnace; during heating, the Ar–H2 (5% of H2) flow is tuned to 0.2l/min through P1. Once the furnace has reached the target temperature we perform an annealing of the Cu during 20–30min. Right after we tune the flow to the desired rate for growth, we allow the flow to pass through the alcohol container (P2) for the graphene growth, and the time is varied depending on the precursor. Through this growth time the container is placed on a water bath with boiling water. Maintaining the flow rate, we redirect the flux to P1 and we perform a 10min annealing of the sample. We have found that this annealing step increases the quality of the graphene film, proved by a decrease on the D band signal in the Raman spectra (results not shown here). After this time the flow is decreased to 0.2l/min and the furnace is turned off to cool down to room temperature. In our experiments the parameters to be varied are: synthesis temperature (980 or 990°C), time of growth, and flow rate; these two last parameters allow a control on the amount of carbon delivered to the system during the experiment."
3,Transfer,"2.2 Transfer After synthesis the copper foil is covered with graphene on both surfaces. To further characterize the material we transfer the graphene films to Si/SiO2 substrates. The material is transferred using the following method: (1) a film of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, 950K molecular weight, 2% in anisole) is drop-coated on one side of the film, (2) the uncoated side is exposed to O2 plasma to remove the protective graphene film, (3) the copper foil-graphene-PMMA is left overnight in a FeCl3 solution with the copper area in contact with the solution and, (4) the graphene/PMMA film is scooped out of the FeCl3 etchant solution, rinsed in deionized water three times and put in contact with the target Si/SiO2 substrate, (5) a second film of PMMA is drop coated and left to dry, (6) finally the substrate is immersed in warm acetone (40°C) to dissolve the PMMA and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol."
4,Raman spectroscopy,"2.3 Raman spectroscopy Micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements have been performed with laser excitation energies in the range 2.16–2.54eV at room temperature for 10s with laser powers of ∼2.3mW. The samples were analyzed in the backscattering configuration using a 100× objective lens. For convenience, measurements were made with five different laser energies: argon (2.54, 2.47, 2.41eV), YAG (2.33eV) and Rhodamine dye (2.16eV). Maps were recorded using a motorized stage with a step size of 0.3μm and E laser =2.33eV."
5,Electron microscopy,"2.4 Electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy has been carried out using a FEG Zeiss Ultra55 microscope operated at 5kV. TEM imaging has been carried out by transferring our materials to 200 mesh Au grids (Quantifoil), following the method reported in Reference [20]. For TEM imaging we used an image-side aberration corrected FEI TITAN 80–300 microscope operated at 80kV with a spherical aberration of 0.02mm at Scherzer defocus."
6,Results and discussion,"Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are first used to investigate the produced graphene samples. Figure 2 shows typical low magnification SEM images of samples synthesized using 2-phenylethanol at 980°C during 5min (Figure 2A) and using ethanol at 990°C during 10s (Figure 2B) with flow rates of 1l/min and 0.88l/min, respectively. The large copper grains and graphene areas partially covering these grains are visible. In these images the typical graphene wrinkles, due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between graphene and copper [21] (negative/positive thermal expansion coefficients, respectively), are evident. Raman spectroscopy spectra of both transferred samples are plotted in Figure 1C. Optical microscopy images of these transferred materials to Si/SiO2 recorded at 100× are also included (Figure 2C insets). Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the light-contrasted areas consist of mono-layer graphene with typical values for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the G′ band of 30–36cm−1 and I G′/I G ratios of ∼3. Although, monolayer graphene can be produced using both precursors, our results suggest that using 2-phenylethanol the average graphene-grain sizes are islands typically of 2×2μm, while for ethanol larger domains of single-layer were observed (10×10μm). In order to obtain larger coverage using alcohols, synthesis parameters were changed. Consequently, a clear improvement in the coverage area was thus observed, as well as an increase in the number of layers present in the samples. In general we obtain better results with ethanol (i.e., better coverage, layer continuity and faster synthesis) than with 2-phenylethanol. In figure 2C spectra of double and triple layer samples produced with ethanol are also plotted. The optimal conditions for large coverage of bi-layer graphene are: ethanol as precursor at 980°C for 10s with a flow rate of 1l/min. Longer growth times and higher flow rates result in more carbon deposition and hence more layers. Raman measurements using five different laser excitation wavelengths 574, 532, 514, 501 and 488nm (2.16, 2.33, 2.41, 2.47 and 2.54eV, respectively), were performed on a uniformly-covered graphene sample synthesized at 980°C using ethanol as precursor (Figure 2D). The corresponding spectra are presented in Figure 3 A. We can easily notice the large intensities of the G′ bands (∼2700cm−1), with average FWHM of 50cm−1 according to our Lorentzian fittings. The dispersive behavior of the D (∼1350cm−1) and G′ bands can be observed in Figure 3A, where insets to these bands are also illustrated. We found linear relations between the positions of the D and G′ bands (ω D and ω G′, respectively) and the laser excitation energy (E laser), this dispersive behavior is consistent with the double resonance (DR) theory [22]. In order to quantify these frequency dependences on laser energy, the plotted spectra were fitted with single Lorentzians and quantitative data related to the above mentioned energy dependences was further extracted. In Figure 3B, the frequency positions of the main carbon bands are plotted as a function of laser excitation energy. From these data, the frequency-dependent slopes on E laser were estimated for both the D and G′ bands: ∂ω D/∂E laser ≈39cm−1/eV and ∂ω G′/∂E laser ≈85cm−1/eV. The present value of ∂ω G′/∂E laser is very close to that of exfoliated monolayer graphene [23] (88cm−1/eV). In the same graph, the energy dependence of the intensity of the D band appears plotted as the I D/I G ratio (hexagons linked to the right hand Y-axis). This ratio decreases linearly with E laser, as expected from DR theory. In order to evaluate the sample homogeneity, Raman spectroscopy maps were performed on an area of 18×18μm2. The G′ band intensity map is plotted in Figure 3C; confirming the layer homogeneity of the sample within the measured area by observing the small variation of intensity. The average value of the I G′/I G ratio is 2 and the average FWHM of the G′ band is 55cm−1, as it can be appreciated in Figure 3D where two spectra extracted from the map are plotted, the inset shows the optical image of the area measured. According to previous reports on CVD-grown graphene, the stacking of bi-layers is not AB-type but rather a random stack with uncontrolled rotational angles [5,7]. Indeed, such a random stacking is reflected in the Raman spectra since CVD bi-layer graphene does not reproduce the four-component G′ feature of Bernal stacked graphene exfoliated from HOPG (which arises from the splitting of the electronic bands in bi-layer as compared to mono-layer graphene). Instead, the G′ band of CVD bi-layer graphene would present a lower intensity and a larger line width, relative to the same Raman features in monolayer graphene. The large width of the G′ bands, the depletion of their intensities with respect to the G band observed in our measurements, and the ∂ω G′/∂E laser value close to that of graphene suggest the presence of two largely decoupled layers of graphene (see Figure 3A and D). This conclusion was confirmed by HRTEM and electron diffraction studies of the samples produced with ethanol at 980°C (Figure 4 ). The electron diffraction spectrum of a random area of thismaterial reveals the main reflections of the honeycomb lattice of graphene (see Figure 4A). The dashed hexagon circumscribes the 2.13Å reflections and the dotted one the 1.23Å reflections. The inset is a line profile plot taken along the yellow line, confirming that the sample in this region is bilayer graphene [24]. Figures 4B and C illustrate TEM images of randomly selected areas where bi- and tri- layer graphene, respectively. Randomly stacked graphene layers are again evident from the Moiré patterns that appear in the high resolution images (Figure 4B). The reciprocal space correspondence (Fast-Fourier Transform, FFT) of this image allows us to verify the presence of two layers of graphene and to quantify the rotational angle between them, which is estimated to be around 4.4°. During these TEM observations, randomly stacked tri-layer graphene was also observed (Figure 4C)."
7,Conclusions,"In this report, mono-, bi- and tri- layer graphene samples are synthesized using alcohol precursors at atmospheric pressure and using a single gas inlet of an Ar–H2 mixture with a very low concentration of H2 (5%). Using various characterization techniques, the bi- and tri- layer graphene films are found to be not strongly coupled, displaying random rotational angles between the stacked layers (HRTEM Moiré patterns). Indeed, using five different laser excitation energies, Raman scattering measurements of bi-layer graphene, demonstrate that the dispersion of the G′ bands is similar to that of exfoliated monolayer graphene, confirming again a strong decoupling between the layers. The ease of implementation of this synthesis method could represent an easy and cheap procedure to scale up and tune graphene production."
