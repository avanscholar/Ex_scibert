0,Introduction,"In the past decades, our society has been primarily fueled by fossil resources, which are non-sustainable and polluting energy sources, releasing green-house gases and other toxic compounds upon combustion (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). The resulting aggravation of air pollution, global warming and extreme weather phenomena in recent years have indicated that a continuing excessive use of fossil fuels will have devastating results on the climate, sea levels and the quality of living for a large part of the population worldwide. To counteract this negative trend, an increasing amount of research is being dedicated to find and establish sustainable sources for clean energy. Hydrogen has been identified as a highly versatile energy carrier, providing high energy density, a good conversion efficiency, without creating further pollution upon combustion (Baykara, 2018). In this regard, biological processes have gained increased attention, representing a green and sustainable alternative to produce hydrogen. Among these, dark fermentation is considered the most promising (Arimi et al., 2015), resulting in a high productivity with a flexible and simple operation (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016), while allowing the use of waste streams as a substrate. Thermotoga neapolitana is a hyperthermophilic bacterium which has a high potential for dark fermentative hydrogen production (Chou et al., 2008; Pradhan et al., 2015). Hydrogen yields (HY) approaching the theoretical value of 4 mol H2/mol hexose, fast growth kinetics and a large range of potential substrates are its main advantages (Pradhan et al., 2015). Up to now, T. neapolitana has been exclusively studied in batch or semi batch operation with the aim of identifying the optimal range of operating parameters such as temperature, pH and mixing (Munro et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2008; Pradhan et al., 2015). However, in large scale applications, a continuous-flow process is generally preferred (Balachandar et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014). Besides the hydraulic retention time (HRT), one of the most important parameters in a continuous process is the organic loading rate (OLR), which is defined by the ratio between the influent substrate concentration and the HRT (Arimi et al., 2015; Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). The increase of the OLR within a certain range allows a more energy-efficient operation (Jung et al., 2011) and has shown to enhance H2 production in dark fermentation (Arimi et al., 2015; Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Hawkes et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2012; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). High feed substrate concentrations do not only lead to an increased hydrogen production, but also to higher concentrations of fermentation end products, e.g. volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols. When these products exceed a certain threshold level, which is specific to the microbial culture and the particular substrate used (Lin et al., 2012), inhibition of dark fermentation can occur (Lin et al., 2012; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016) resulting in changes of the H2 producing pathways as well as the microbial activity (Ciranna et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2011). Feedback inhibition, which acts on the HY as well as the hydrogen production rate (HPR) (Tang et al., 2012), is considered one of the main challenges in dark fermentation (Boodhun et al., 2017). Therefore, it is essential for a dark fermentative hydrogen production process to find the substrate concentrations that allow for the highest HPR and efficiency, while minimizing the effect of inhibitory compounds. In the present study, we established for the first time a continuous hydrogen production process using a pure culture of T. neapolitana. The main goal of this study was to initially determine the impact of different feed glucose concentrations on the process yields and rates. Secondly, the inhibition by acetic acid (AA), i.e. the main fermentation end product, on H2 production and biomass growth was investigated in both batch and continuous experiments."
1,Material and methods,
2,Bacterial culture and medium,"2.1 Bacterial culture and medium A pure culture of Thermotoga neapolitana purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) was cultivated and stored according to Dreschke et al. (2018) and subsequently used in all experiments. The medium was based on a modified ATCC 1977 medium (Dreschke et al., 2018), in which glucose and AA concentrations were varied as specified in Section 2.2. The medium was autoclaved at 110 °C for 5 min, pH-adjusted to 7 and sparged with N2 for 10 min to establish anaerobic conditions."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design The continuous and batch experiments were run using a working volume of 2 L, a constant temperature of 80 °C and a pH of 7, automatically adjusted by adding 5 M NaOH in a 3-L fully controlled, continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) (Applikon Biotechnology, the Netherlands). To avoid pressure build-up, the produced biogas was continuously released from the headspace of the reactor. 2.2.1 Continuous process After the inoculation with 6% (v/v) of storage culture, the reactor was run in batch mode for 16 h to allow the culture to grow and acclimatize. After this initial phase, the feeding was started in continuous mode at a flow rate of 83.3 mL/h to maintain an HRT of 24 h. The feed medium was stored at 4 °C after autoclaving and removing the oxygen by sparging the headspace of the container with N2 for 10 min. The working volume was controlled using a level probe. Twice a day, liquid samples were drawn for the determination of turbidity (OD540), glucose, AA and lactic acid (LA) concentrations. Furthermore, 200 mL of effluent was taken to determine the cell dry weight (CDW). The biogas production rate was measured by measuring the time to fill a 500 mL water displacement system. The effect of glucose and acetic acid concentration on dark fermentation by T. neapolitana was investigated by using a “one-factor-at-a-time” method. Initially, the reactor was operated to investigate the effect of the OLR on dark fermentation by varying only the glucose concentration in the feed as reported in Table 1 . The range of the feed glucose concentration was based on previous studies using T. neapolitana (Pradhan et al., 2015). From day 83 onwards, the feed glucose was maintained constant at 27.8 mM, while only the AA concentration was gradually increased from 30 to 240 mM (Table 1) to evaluate the effect of increasing AA concentrations on the process. The feed glucose and AA concentrations were changed when a steady state was reached, determined by a variation of the hydrogen production by less than 10%. 2.2.2 Batch bioassays Simultaneously to the continuous-flow operation, batch bioassays were run in order to assess the effect of the AA concentration (i.e. 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 mM) on dark fermentation by T. neapolitana. Prior to investigating each condition, the reactor was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of storage culture and stirred at 100 rpm for 15 h to allow the culture to grow and acclimatize. After 15 h, the agitation speed was increased to 500 rpm to accelerate the process. The produced biogas was captured in a 500 mL water displacement system and quantified every hour. Liquid samples of 2 mL were drawn every hour to measure turbidity as well as the glucose, AA and LA concentrations. The fermentation was terminated after 23 h or previously, when the reactor ceased to produce further biogas. Duplicates were used for each operating condition."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The biomass concentration of batch bioassays was quantified by measuring the optical density (OD540) at 540 nm (8453 UV–Visible Spectrophotometer, Agilent Technologies, USA), whereas in the continuous experiment 200 mL of effluent was dried at 105 °C until constant weight to determine the CDW. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 rpm at 5 min) and the supernatant was used to measure the concentrations of glucose, AA and LA applying the method described by Mancini et al. (Mancini et al., 2018) with an HPLC (Prominence LC-20A Series, Shimadzu, Japan), equipped with UV/Vis (SPD-20A, Shimadzu Japan) and refractive index (RID-20A, Shimadzu, Japan) detectors and 0.0065 M of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase. The hydrogen concentration of the biogas was measured with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Restek packed column using argon as the carrier gas. The hydrogen production was converted from volumetric to molar by using the ideal gas law (O-Thong et al., 2008)."
5,Kinetic study of biohydrogen production and biomass growth,"2.4 Kinetic study of biohydrogen production and biomass growth The rates of biomass growth and hydrogen production were determined by fitting the batch experimental data with the Gompertz model as described by Dreschke et al. (2018). Eqs. (1) and (2) were applied for biomass growth and hydrogen production, respectively: (1) B = B 0 + B m ∗ e x p - e x p R B ∗ e ∗ λ B - t / B m + 1 (2) H = H m ∗ e x p - e x p R H ∗ e ∗ λ H - t / H m + 1 where B [OD540] is the biomass concentration at fermentation time t [h]; B 0 [OD540] is the biomass concentration at time 0 h; Bm [OD540] is the gain of biomass concentration throughout the fermentation; RB is the volumetric biomass growth rate (BGR) [OD540/h]; and λB is the lag phase of biomass growth [h]; H [mL] is the cumulative hydrogen at time t [h]; Hm [mL] is the hydrogen produced throughout the fermentation; RH [mL/(L h)] is the volumetric hydrogen production rate; and λH is the lag phase of hydrogen production [h]; and e is the Euler's number, i.e. 2.7183."
6,Microbial community analysis,"2.5 Microbial community analysis On day 82 and 102 of the continuous operation, 3 mL of liquid sample were extracted for the determination of the microbial community. DNA was extracted, stored and sequenced as explained by Kostrytsia et al. (2018). Quality filtering, sequence clustering, chimera removal and taxonomy assignment using the Silva (v.128) database (Glöckner et al., 2017; Pruesse et al., 2007) was applied on the raw sequence data before generating an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table via the Quantitative Insight into Microbial Ecology (QIIME v1.9) pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010). A threshold of 0.1% was employed to distinguish rare from abundant taxa."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis An unpaired t-test using Microsoft Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, USA) was performed to compare the experimental data obtained under the varying operating conditions during the continuous-flow experimentation."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of glucose concentration in a continuous system,"3.1 Effect of glucose concentration in a continuous system 3.1.1 Limit of feed glucose concentration Fig. 1 shows the evolution of dark fermentation in continuous operation at different feed glucose concentrations. During phase G1, a feed glucose concentration of 27.8 mM led to a stable process. Within 1 day, a HPR of 55.2 (±4.7) mL/(L h) (Table 2 ), a HY of 2.1 (±0.2) mol H2/mol glucose and a biomass yield of 26.9 (±1.2) g CDW/mol glucose were reached (Fig. 1A) and the produced biogas contained 70 (±4) % of H2 (data not shown). The process remained stable for the subsequent 10 days of operation producing 30.9 (±0.7) mM of AA and 17.6 (±1.1) mM of LA (Fig. 1B), with an AA/LA ratio of 1.8 (±0.2) (Fig. 2 A) and a residual glucose concentration of 2.1 (±0.1) mM (Fig. 1B). Increasing the feed glucose concentration to 41.6 mM in phase G2 did not significantly improve the reactor performance exhibiting an HPR of 53.7 (±4.0) mL/(L h) (p-value: 0.35), similar to that observed in phase G1 (Table 2). The glucose concentration in the effluent increased to 4.2 (±0.6) mM, while the AA concentration remained unaffected at 28.2 (±1.1) mM and the LA concentration significantly increased to 43.2 (±2.3) mM (p-value: 1.7 * 10−13) (Fig. 1B), entailing an AA/LA ratio of 0.7 (±0.1) (Fig. 2A). In T. neapolitana, only 2 pathways are involved to a relevant extent in the dark fermentation of glucose, i.e. the AA pathway yielding 4 mol of hydrogen and 4 mol of ATP per mole of glucose and the energetically less challenging LA pathway producing no hydrogen but 2 mol of ATP (Balachandar et al., 2013; Pradhan et al., 2015). The AA/LA ratio is, thus, tightly linked to the HY as shown in Fig. 2A and represents another indicator for the conversion efficiency to hydrogen. Consequently, the decrease of the AA/LA ratio in phase G2 was accompanied by the reduction of the HY to 1.4 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose (Figs. 1A and 2A). The lower H2 production efficiency at 41.6 mM of feed glucose strongly suggests a substrate overload of T. neapolitana, which is commonly observed in dark fermentation (Akutsu et al., 2009; Hafez et al., 2010). For instance, Zhang et al. (2013) raised the feed glucose concentration from 5 to 15 g/L in a CSTR at an HRT of 6 h using Clostridium bifermentans 3AT-ma. Similar to our results, this induced a decrease of the HY and AA concentration from 1.1 to 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose and from 10.0 to 6.8 mM, respectively, with a sharp increase of the LA and butyric acid concentrations. Zhang et al. (2013) assumed the VFA accumulation responsible for the HY decrease. Due to the low residual glucose concentration, i.e. between 2.2 (±0.0) and 4.2 (±0.6) mM in the effluent (Fig. 1B), we assume a similar effect (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2013) prevented the further AA formation and subsequently limited the hydrogen production. 3.1.2 Effect of feed glucose concentration on the hydrogen and biomass yield To better study the effect of the glucose concentration on dark fermentation, lower feed glucose concentrations (i.e. 16.7, 11.1 and 22.2 mM) were used in phases G4, G5 and G6, respectively. The reduction of the feed concentration increased the HY to 3.3 (±0.2), 3.6 (±0.1) and 2.9 (±0.2) mol H2/mol glucose and biomass yield to 39.3 (±1.8), 47.2 (±2.3) and 31.6 (±1.4) g CDW/mol glucose, in phases G4, G5 and G6, respectively (Fig. 1A). Concomitantly, the AA/LA ratio increased to 4.6 (±1.1), 6.0 (±0.7) and 3.8 (±0.9) (Fig. 2A). This revealed an almost linear negative correlation between the HY and feed glucose concentration (Fig. 2A), with a maximum yield of 3.6 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose at the lowest feed (i.e. 11.1 mM) and the concomitant shift from AA to LA at increasing feed glucose concentrations (Fig. 1B). A similar correlation was observed for the biomass yield (Fig. 2A). The biomass concentration increased with the feed glucose concentration until reaching a plateau at 687 (±21) mg CDW/L above 22.2 mM of feed glucose (Table 2). It is unclear why the biomass concentration did not increase further at higher glucose concentrations. Up to now, the effect of substrate concentration on T. neapolitana activity has exclusively been studied in batch operation, most commonly in 120 mL closed serum bottles without pH control (Ngo et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2010, 2008). While reporting a notable increase of the HY with increasing glucose (Nguyen et al., 2010, 2008) or xylose (Ngo et al., 2012) concentrations up to a certain threshold level, the results obtained under these conditions are generally highly affected by the decrease of pH (Brynjarsdottir et al., 2013) and the build-up of the hydrogen partial pressure (Ngo et al., 2012). Mars et al. (2010) used T. neapolitana in a pH-controlled reactor using headspace sparging. When increasing the glucose concentration from 10 to 27 g/L, the HY and HPR remained similar at 2.9 and 3.0 mol H2/mol glucose as well as 12.3 and 12.4 mmol/(L h), respectively. However, the fermentation time increased from 20 to over 71 h. Similarly, the general HPR increased and HY decreased when increasing the substrate concentration of a continuous-flow reactor with mixed cultures, using glucose (van Ginkel and Logan, 2005b) or organic-containing wastewater (Lin et al., 2012) as substrates."
10,Impact of the initial AA concentration in batch bioassays,"3.2 Impact of the initial AA concentration in batch bioassays 3.2.1 Effect on hydrogen production and yield The batch fermentation of 27.8 mM of glucose by T. neapolitana without AA addition resulted in a HY of 2.8 (±0.0) mol H2/mol glucose and an AA/LA ratio of 2.3 (Table 3 ). Increasing the initial AA concentration from 0 to 240 mM gradually reduced the total hydrogen production by 45% from 1739 (±12) to 950 (±29) mL/L (Table 3). Up to 120 mM of AA, glucose was completely consumed within 23 h with a 30% decrease of the HY to 2.0 (±0.0) mol H2/mol glucose, accompanied by a decline of the AA/LA ratio (Table 3). The reduction of the HY at elevated concentrations of fermentation end products is commonly observed in dark fermentation (Jones et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2012; van Ginkel and Logan, 2005a; Wang et al., 2008). For example, Ciranna et al. (2014) reported the decrease of HY from 3.0 (±0.2) to 0.6 (±0.4) mol H2/mol glucose when increasing the AA concentration from 40 to 225 mM in a batch fermentation of 55 mM glucose using Caloramator celer in 120 mL closed serum bottles. In this study, a further increase of the feed AA to 180 and 240 mM led to an elevated residual glucose concentration, i.e. 7.8 (±1.2) and 11.0 (±1.6) mM, in the effluent after 23 h and a slight increase of the HY to 2.1 (±0.0) and 2.3 (±0.0) mol H2/mol glucose, respectively (Table 3). A more detailed analysis revealed that the AA/LA ratio was 161 (±84) % higher from 15 to 18 h than from 18 to 22 h in all batch bioassays. This indicates that the HY was higher in the early stages of the experiment. A possible cause for this effect is the higher initial glucose concentration. Nguyen et al. (2010) reported a considerable increase of the HY when increasing the initial glucose concentration from 1 to 4 g/L in batch fermentation by T. neapolitana. Therefore, we assume that the slightly higher HY at 180 and 240 mM AA was not linked to the AA concentration, but rather caused by the evolution of the process. 3.2.2 Dark fermentation kinetics In a continuous-flow operation, the process rate is strongly determined by the substrate feeding rate. Therefore, batch bioassays were performed to study the effect of AA on the biomass growth and hydrogen production kinetics of T. neapolitana. As indicated by the incomplete glucose consumption at 180 and 240 mM AA, an elevated initial AA concentration notably decreased the dark fermentation rate. To better compare the results obtained at different AA feed concentrations, a modified Gompertz model was used to fit the data of hydrogen production and biomass growth (Fig. 3 A and B). Under all operating conditions, the quality of the fit was confirmed by an R2 of 0.99 (±0.00) for hydrogen production and 0.98 (±0.01) for biomass growth. Without AA in the medium, the HPR and BGR reached 265 (±7) mL/(L h) and 0.27 (±0.03) OD540/h, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The low BGR obtained at 0 mM AA was presumably caused by the high biomass growth already achieved after 15 h (Fig. 3B), leading to a distorted value from the Gompertz model. In the range between 30 and 240 mM, the initial AA concentration was found to be negatively correlated to the BGR and the HPR, which decreased from 0.42 (±0.06) to 0.24 (±0.04) OD540/h and from 230 (±7) to 115 (±0) mL/(L h), respectively (Fig. 4A). This corresponds to a deceleration of hydrogen production and biomass growth by 50 and 43%, respectively. The slowdown of the fermentation was furthermore confirmed by an increase of the lag phase from 14.0 (±0.3) to 15.7 (±0.4) h for biomass growth and from 15.7 (±0.1) to 18.0 (±0.1) h for hydrogen production (Fig. 4B). Both lag phases were similarly affected by the AA concentration increase by approximately 2.5 h in the studied AA concentration range (i.e. 0–240 mM) (Fig. 4B). However, the hydrogen production initiated about 2.2 h after the biomass growth according to the Gompertz analysis. Mars et al. (2010) previously investigated the effect of increased AA concentrations on the performance of T. neapolitana using closed 120 mL serum bottles without pH control. They reported biomass growth at up to 300 mM AA with a decreasing amount of total VFAs produced with increasing initial AA concentration. However, they did not present detailed information on the production of AA and hydrogen or the evolution of the fermentation. The effect of AA on dark fermentation of pure cultures was studied in more detail by Van Niel et al. (2003) and Ciranna et al. (2014) in 120 mL closed serum bottles without pH control. Van Niel et al. (2003) added sodium acetate in the exponential growth phase of the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus obtaining concentrations from 0 to 300 mM AA, while Ciranna et al. (2014) investigated the effect of an initial AA concentration up to 350 mM on Caloramator celer. Both studies observed a drastic decrease of the process rate, revealed by a reduction of the HPR and the BGR. Concomitantly, they reported no further biomass growth above 200 mM AA for Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (van Niel et al., 2003) and approximately 150 mM AA for Caloramator celer (Ciranna et al., 2014). In both studies, increasing the undissociated AA fraction in the fermentation broth due to a pH decrease did not alter the inhibitory effect. Furthermore, Van Niel et al. (2003) found the inhibition of sodium chloride and sodium acetate to be identical. Therefore, both studies concluded that ionic strength was responsible for the inhibition of dark fermentation rather than the free AA."
11,Effect of acetic acid concentration in a continuous system,"3.3 Effect of acetic acid concentration in a continuous system In the second stage of the continuous process, the feed AA concentration was gradually increased from 0 to 240 mM. The elevated concentrations of AA had no negative impact on the HPR and the biomass concentration, which varied only slightly between 75.3 (±2.9) and 83.8 (±2.6) mL/(L h) and 621 (±19) and 710 (±26) mg CDW/L, respectively (Table 2). Similarly, the H2 percentage in the produced biogas remained unaffected by AA reaching a value of 69 (±1) % (data not shown). Glucose was completely consumed under all operating conditions (Fig. 5 B), entailing that also the hydrogen and biomass yields remained constant at 3.0 (±0.2) mol H2/mol glucose and 27.1 (±1.6) g CDW/mol glucose, respectively (Figs. 2B and 5A). Hence, contrary to the results obtained in the batch bioassays, the increase of the feed AA concentration had no effect on the continuous-flow dark fermentation. In particular, the HY of the continuous process increased by approximately 6% at 0 mM AA and 48% at 120 mM AA compared to the batch experiments. We assume that the prolonged cultivation at high AA concentrations allows T. neapolitana to adapt its metabolism and continue to ferment via the energetically more challenging AA pathway, which results in a higher yield of ATP (Pradhan et al., 2015). van Ginkel and Logan (2005a) studied the effect of undissociated VFAs on continuous dark fermentation of a mixed culture operated at 30 °C, an HRT of 10 h and a stable pH of 5.5 with glucose (10–50 g/L) as a substrate. A total AA concentration of approximately 10, 100 and 165 mM, resulting in an undissociated AA concentration of 2, 15 and 25 mM, induced HYs of about 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 mol H2/mol glucose and HPRs of 0.29, 0.30 and 0.20 L/h, indicating a little effect of non-dissociated AA on H2 yields. Jones et al. (2017) ran a continuous hydrogen production reactor with a mixed culture (35 °C; pH 5.5; HRT 48 h and 40 g sucrose/L as a substrate) applying electrodialysis to remove VFAs from the liquid phase. When the AA concentration was decreased from 3.08 to 1.77 g/L, the HY increased from 0.24 to 0.90 mol H2/mol hexose and the carbohydrate consumption from 12 to 25%, indicating a higher dark fermentation rate."
12,Improved culture performance due to acclimatization at prolonged cultivation,"3.4 Improved culture performance due to acclimatization at prolonged cultivation Within the course of the continuous-flow operation, an initial glucose concentration of 27.8 mM was repeatedly used in phases G1, G3 and G7 to confirm the reproducibility and investigate the acclimatization of the culture. After 26 days of cultivation, the reactor performance in phase G3 remained comparable to that previously observed in phase G1, as demonstrated by the similar values of hydrogen and biomass yield (Fig. 1A) as well as fermentation end products (Fig. 1B). However, when using 27.8 mM as feed glucose again in phase G7 after 65 days of operation, an HY of 2.7 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose (Fig. 1A) was obtained, which was significantly higher (i.e. by approximately 29%; p-value: 2.0 * 10−13) than that observed in phase G1. Concomitantly, the AA/LA ratio increased to 3.5 (±0.8) (Fig. 2A), while the biomass yield remained constant at 27.8 (±1.0) g CDW/mol glucose (Fig. 1A). The same trend continued when raising the feed AA concentration from 0 to 240 mM with the HY increasing by a further 12% from 2.8 (±0.2) to 3.1 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose (p-value: 9.5 * 10−7) (Figs. 2B and 5A) and a simultaneous reduction of the LA concentration from 11.1 (±2.0) to 3.4 (±0.2) mM (Fig. 5B). Hence, the HY increased by a total of 47% throughout the 110 days of continuous-flow operation (Figs. 1A and 5A). We presume that this substantial improvement of the process efficiency was directly correlated to an acclimatization of T. neapolitana. The importance of acclimatization has previously been demonstrated for mixed cultures (Haroun et al., 2016), where it is generally considered as a shift in the microbial community structure (Cisneros-Pérez et al., 2017; Dessì et al., 2017). However, this study demonstrates that acclimatization also occurs in pure cultures in terms of a metabolic shift and represents a large potential to enhance the process performance in continuous fermentation. Acclimatization in pure cultures is still poorly understood and can require long operation times, which complicate the assessment of the culture potential."
13,Mechanisms for end product inhibition,"3.5 Mechanisms for end product inhibition Several effects have been discussed in the literature to explain the inhibition of high end product concentrations on dark fermentation (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). The most common is the decrease of the extracellular pH until the normal functions of the cell cannot be kept active (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Srikanth and Venkata Mohan, 2014). This mechanism can be excluded in the present study, as the pH was continuously controlled at 7. At acidic pH, inhibition may also occur due to the presence of undissociated organic acids (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Srikanth and Venkata Mohan, 2014), which penetrate the cells and disrupt the cell functions by changing the intracellular pH and osmolarity (Akutsu et al., 2009). In this study, a concentration of 270 mM AA (240 mM fed + approximately 30 mM produced) was observed in the reactor at the highest AA feed. At pH 7, this results in an undissociated AA concentration below 2 mM, calculated via the equation presented by Akutsu et al. (2009), and its inhibitory effect on the process was therefore considered negligible. Ciranna et al. (2014) identified the increase of ionic strength to be responsible for the feedback inhibition. However, Pradhan et al. (2017) reported no effect of salinity on HY and biomass growth of T. neapolitana up to 855 mM of NaCl. Jones et al. (2017) ascribed dark fermentation inhibition by VFAs to be a thermodynamic limitation."
14,Microbiological considerations,"3.6 Microbiological considerations In the MiSeq, the bacterial community analysis after 102 days of continuous operation revealed 2 genera above 0.1% relative abundance, i.e. Thermotoga and Enterococcus with 98 and 2%, respectively. As Enterococci are mesophilic bacteria growing in the range from 10 to 45 °C (Sherman, 1937), their minor appearance in the community analysis was most likely caused by a contamination during sampling. Further evidence for an exclusive substrate degradation by T. neapolitana was provided by the composition of end products in the effluent. Throughout the 110 d of continuous operation the sum of AA and LA, constituted for 95 (±10) % of the glucose consumed. Nguyen et al. (2010) reported that batch bioassays using T. neapolitana remained free of contamination due to the extreme growth temperature of 80 °C. Our results suggest that this finding also applied to a prolonged cultivation of 102 days in non-sterile continuous operation."
15,Conclusions,"During dark fermentation by T. neapolitana, increasing feed glucose concentrations from 11.1 to 27.8 mM simultaneously led to higher HPR and lower HY. When further raised to 41.6 mM, the additional glucose was metabolized to LA without producing extra hydrogen, resulting in stable HPR and AA production. Increasing the feed AA concentration up to 240 mM induced no negative effect, suggesting that biohydrogen production was not hampered by end-product inhibition. Moreover, the HY improved by 47% throughout the 110 days of continuous cultivation, reaching a final value of 3.1 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose at 27.8 mM feed glucose."
