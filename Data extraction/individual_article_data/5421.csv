0,Introduction,"With the inevitable depletion of fossil fuels, technologies for hydrogen production from renewable sources continue to attract much attention. Biomass-derived compounds present a particularly attractive renewable and sustainable source for hydrogen generation. Traditional technologies for converting biomass-derived fuel into hydrogen, such as steam reforming [1], autothermal reforming [2], liquid reforming [3] and pyrolysis [4] suffer from hydrogen selectivity problems, the underlying requirement of a significant energy input and the need for pure oxygen sources. Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda [5], it has been recognized that hydrogen evolution could occur through the photo-splitting of water. Compared to what one might term traditional technologies [1–4], the photocatalysis of biomass compounds possesses the following advantages: first, photo-reaction utilizes solar light to provide energy, instead of external heat input that comes from combustion; and secondly the ultimate products of photocatalysis reaction are usually hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which indicate that hydrogen selectivity is very high. The addition of biomass-derived fuel not only serves as a hydrogen source but also as (chemical) electron donors, which can enhance the yield of hydrogen. Therefore, from a long term perspective, photo-induced generation of hydrogen from solutions containing oxygenated hydrocarbons derived from biomass will constitute a major new avenue for the sustainable production of hydrogen fuel. However, photocatalysis generally suffers from low intrinsic efficiency for hydrogen production due to two major problems: first, the low efficiency associated with utilizing solar light, since the majority of catalysts (e.g. TiO2) only respond to UV light, which accounts for just 5% of solar light, and second, the facile recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons effectively limits the efficiency of the hydrogen production process. Therefore, to increase the efficiency, a suitable modification of semiconductor catalysts is a high priority [6–9]. Ni et al. [10] reviewed the various approaches to improving the response of TiO2 (a cheap, robust and widely available semiconductor catalyst) to visible light for hydrogen production. We have recently discovered a route to prepare the doped analogue, TiO2−x N x , with a high surface area and adjustable electronic band gap [11], which shows a high activity response to visible light under relatively mild reaction conditions, such as ambient temperature and pressure. In this report, we have studied the effect of N and B doping of TiO2 for hydrogen production from oxygenated hydrocarbons solutions under irradiation from an Xe 300W light source. Although TiO2 modifications by doping non-metal [12–15] have been reported previously, there is little work at present [16,17] on the application of such doped TiO2 materials to hydrogen production, especially for binary elements codoped into TiO2. Here, glycerol and other oxygenated hydrocarbons have been selected for hydrogen production by photocatalysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization (B, N)-codoped TiO2 was prepared by means of hydrothermal synthesis: 3.4g Ti(OBu)4 and 0.72g Triton X-100 were added into 20mL ethanol under stirring. Then a solution of 3mL saturated urea solution containing 0.123g boric acid was added dropwisely. After stirring for half an hour, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and placed at 120°C for 14h. After cooling naturally, the solid product was washed with ethanol and distilled water alternatively for several times, followed by drying at 75°C for 1h and calcination at 450°C for 1h in muffle furnace. Thus, the (B, N)-TiO2 was obtained and the undoped and N or B each doped TiO2 were prepared by the same method with their precursors. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples were obtained with an X' Pert Pro Alpha 1 diffractometer using monochromic Cu Kα radiation. Laser Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRam 300 spectrometer. Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were recorded using KBr pellets with a Cary 5 spectrophotometer equipped with a DR accessory."
3,Hydrogen production measurement,"2.2 Hydrogen production measurement The prepared samples were platinized by photodecomposition of 0.25mL 2wt% K2 Pt(NO3)4 solution in 50mL ethanol containing doped or undoped TiO2 (0.50g) under Argon atmosphere for 2h with Xe lamp (300W) irradiation. Photo-induced hydrogen production from oxygenated hydrocarbons solution was conducted in a closed reactor (50mg catalyst was used in 50g solution) under irradiation of 300W Xe lamp. Before irradiation, nitrogen was introduced into reaction system and used as internal calibration. Gas products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with TCD and FID detectors."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1 ) reveal that all the samples are predominantly anatase phase and there is no discernable structural difference between undoped- and doped-TiO2. The particle sizes estimated by applying the Debye Scherer formula are 8.8nm, 19.3nm, 23.6nm and 30.3nm for B-, (B, N)-, N-doped and undoped TiO2, respectively. Chen et al. [18] reported that the addition of a boron dopant to TiO2 would suppress the growth of particle size, which is in accordance with our results. No B2O3 phase has been detected in the XRD patterns, possibly because the concentration of boron is not enough to form clearly crystalline boron oxide [19], which may imply boron is incorporated into TiO2 lattice. The precise nature, and extent of B doping into TiO2 is currently under further investigation. Raman spectra of undoped and doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2 . All the samples are mainly composed of anatase with the peak at about 143, 191, 393, 511 and 635cm−1. The inset in Fig. 2 shows that rutile phase appears in N-doped and (B, N)-codoped TiO2 sample, with three weak peaks at about 236, 317 and 360cm−1. Stathatos et al. [20] found that even a small amount of Triton X-100 would result in a mixture of anatase and rutile by annealing samples at 600–700°C. Here we find that N-doping produces a mixture of anatase and rutile phase, even at 450°C with Triton X-100 addition. The UV–Vis light reflectance spectra are presented in Fig. 3 . N-doped and (B, N)-codoped TiO2 sample show a shift to the lower-energy region in their spectra. The yellowish appearance of (B, N)- and N-doped samples are consistent with this shift. It appears that N-doping and (B, N)-codoping enhance the response to visible light through a reduction in the band gaps, which are roughly calculated to be 3.09ev, 3.05ev, 2.98ev and 2.95ev for undoped-, B-, (B, N)- and N-TiO2 respectively. In addition, although the band gap of N-TiO2 is reduced below that of (B, N)-TiO2, the latter codoped sample exhibited higher photo-catalytic activity toward hydrogen production. This phenomenon may be attributed to the synthetic effect of B and N (possibly due to the formation of defects) which will be explored in detail in the future."
6,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production The doped and undoped TiO2 after platinization were evaluated for producing hydrogen from a 5wt% glycerol solution via photocatalysis (shown in Fig. 4 ). Significantly, platinized (B, N)-codoped TiO2 displayed the highest hydrogen production rate followed by N-TiO2, B-TiO2 and undoped TiO2. It has been proposed that N-doping would facilitate boron doping into the oxygen vacancies in the form of B-TiO2 [21], in addition, boron could indeed suppress the recombination of photo-induced holes and electrons and the recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen into water [22], thereby improving hydrogen production. It was concluded [23] that boron incorporated into TiO2 lattice induced enhanced visible light activity. It is also believed that [24] the presence of B would lead to a reactivity improvement with respect to N where the reactive Ti(III) sites generated by B might induce the formation of reactive superoxide species. These may account for highest activity for (B, N)-codoped TiO2 among our samples. The gas product distribution presented in Table 1 shows that hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the primary products, as expected, as well as trace amount of carbon monoxide, methane, ethane and methanol. Acetone is the primary product detected in the liquid phase. However, the ratio of hydrogen content to carbon dioxide content produced in the gas products is higher than its theoretical value of 2.33, calculated according to the chemical reaction: C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → catalyst hv 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 We believe that this may be due to the solubilisation of CO2 in water (1.45g/L H2O), since the solution appeared weakly acid after reaction. In Fig. 5 , we present the results for hydrogen production as a function of irradiation time, with different glycerol concentration over platinized (B, N)-codoped TiO2. Pure water produces very low amount of hydrogen, while in those runs with glycerol addition, the amount of hydrogen evolution increases steadily with the irradiation time. Interestingly, the amount of produced hydrogen seems not to be influenced by system pressure increase resulting from gas product evolution in such a closed reactor. Here we believe glycerol behaves as both a hydrogen source and an electron donor which presumably serves to capture photo-induced holes and thus liberates strongly reducing photo-induced electrons to decompose water into hydrogen. Increasing the glycerol concentration from 0 to 5wt% results in an increase of hydrogen evolution up to 1.23mmol (3h irradiation time) from less than 100μmol, while a continuous increase of glycerol concentration to 10wt% does not increase hydrogen amount significantly. It appears that at 5wt% glycerol concentration, we achieve the maximum plateau of hydrogen amount produced under the present conditions. Strataki et al. [25] attributed this behavior to a saturated active site from a limited quality of catalyst, and Cui et al. [26] ascribed it to the mechanism of radical reaction for photocatalysis: in essence, more radicals excited by photons can be quenched with an increase of electron donor concentration whilst the radical recombination occurs at higher concentration of alcohols. We also compared hydrogen production from different oxygenated hydrocarbon solutions (5wt%) over platinized (B, N)-codoped TiO2. As seen in Fig. 6 , both glucose and sucrose solutions produce nearly the same amount of hydrogen, but lower than that from glycerol, as expected. This phenomenon may be attributed to different hydrogen contents in the same weight percentage in water (109mmol of H2 contained in 2.5g of glycerol and 83mmol and 80mmol in glucose and sucrose respectively) and the easier breakage of C-C bond for glycerol."
7,Conclusions,"The present work illustrates a new, sustainable and renewable process for hydrogen production from oxygenated hydrocarbon solutions under Xe light irradiation. The catalyst characterization results show that the doped TiO2 noticeably improves its light adsorption property compared to undoped TiO2, and exhibits a higher hydrogen production rate in the photo-catalytic reactions. The biomass-derived fuels serve as both hydrogen sources and electron donors and they are oxidized into CO2 as an ultimate product. Glycerol and the other biomass-derived compounds can be used to enhance hydrogen production by photocatalysis, which may pave a way for hydrogen production from renewable and sustainable biomass resources."
