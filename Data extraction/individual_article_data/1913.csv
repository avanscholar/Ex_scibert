0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is harmful to the environment and toxic to humans. The threshold for fresh- and saltwater fish is 0.5 ppm [1]. Sulfide S2– in wastewater is corrosive and has a very unpleasant odor [2]. As the most reduced form of sulfur, sulfide has a high oxygen demand of 2 mol O2/mol S2–, resulting in depletion of oxygen where sour wastewater is discharged [3]. H2S is abundant in natural gas and petroleum [4–6]. With the increasing consumption of crude oil, the amount of H2S released from petroleum refining has gradually increased. H2S is also contained in most natural gas wells. Up to 2002, the total quantity of sulfur contained in natural gas reached 68 million tons in China [5]. As a consequence, effluent limits have been set for sources of aqueous sulfide, such as petroleum refineries. Wastewater discharges from Canadian petroleum refineries must not exceed 0.3 kg S2–/1000 m3 of oil refined per day [7]. The municipal industrial strategy for abatement in Ontario set loading limits for surface water whereby oil refineries must have a monthly average concentration <0.2mg S2–/L and a daily concentration not >0.3mgS2–/L [8]. Industrially, H2S is oxidized to sulfur (S) and water by the Claus process, in which the hydrogen in H2S is oxidized to water. Therefore, there is a need to develop a clean and environmentally benign technology to produce hydrogen from H2S utilizing solar energy. According to Baeg et al., photocatalytic splitting of H2S is energetically more favorable than that of water [9]. Fig. 1 shows photocatalytic splitting of H2S and the Claus process by which elemental sulfur is recovered from sour water. The recovery of both hydrogen and sulfur from H2S is an interesting alternative to the manufacture of sulfur alone by the Claus process. For the past 30 years much research has explored efficient photocatalysts for H2 generation from various sources such as H2O and H2S. H2S is a group VI hydride like H2O and can be split to give H2. H2S is thus a potential source of H2 and is generated from industries such as petroleum refining, tanning, and effluent treatment. Thus, splitting of H2S to produce hydrogen from industrial waste is more economical than water splitting. Photocatalytic H2S decomposition also requires less energy (ΔG° = 33.44kJ/mol, where G° is the standard-state free energy of the reaction or Gibbs energy) than water splitting (ΔG° = 237.19kJ/mol). Taken together, these considerations suggest that H2S decomposition is an ideal strategy for H2 production. H2 is valuable as an energy resource and a raw material in the chemical industry. There are difficulties in obtaining H2 in a pure form at low cost. In this context, recovery of H2 and S from H2S has attracted more attention because of its economic and environmental advantages [10]. Splitting of H2S in preference to H2O to produce H2 is less costly and faster. An environmental advantage is the removal of H2S gas, which smells obnoxious and contributes to acid rain. On one hand, photocatalytic H2S decomposition with concomitant H2 generation offers sustainable energy production and environmental pollution abatement. On the other hand, conventional energy resources being used to meet global energy requirements have been depleted to a great extent. Therefore, coal as a non-renewable resource will be depleted in the near future and there will be no more H2S emissions for splitting. In such a situation, recovery of hydrogen from available water is an alternative. H2 can be directly obtained from water, which is abundant and renewable, using solar light in the process. If successfully developed as an economically viable approach, this could be the ultimate technology to solve both energy and environmental problems together in the future [11]. Therefore, water splitting seems to have much greater long-term potential than H2S splitting. Fujishima and Honda demonstrated solar-light-assisted splitting of water using TiO2, which represents a new chapter in solar energy conversion [12]. From 1972 to date, there has been much research on photocatalytic H2 generation from both H2O and H2S. Recent investigations by Cervera-March et al. suggested a photocatalytic method for industrial treatment of H2S in which outgoing SO2 and waste gases containing small amounts of H2S are mixed and adsorbed in an alkaline aqueous stream [13]. Solar irradiation of the resulting S2 – and S2O3 2– solutions in the presence of an appropriate photocatalyst yielded H2 and S2O3 2–. Thiosulfate is another important byproduct of this reaction. At present, thermal, thermochemical, electrochemical, plasmochemical, and photochemical methods have been used for H2S decomposition and H2 generation [14]. Among these, the photochemical process has potential because it is renewable and driven by solar energy. Furthermore, photocatalysis is a green chemistry pathway [15]. Nevertheless, visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2S decomposition is still in its infancy. However, there is now a surge of interest by different research groups in H2S decomposition and H2 generation under visible light [16–19]."
1,Fundamental mechanism of semiconductor photocatalysis,"1.1 Fundamental mechanism of semiconductor photocatalysis When sufficient light energy is absorbed by a semiconductor material, an electron is promoted from the highest level of the valence band (VB) to the lowest energy level in the conduction band (CB), as depicted in Fig. 2. This light must be at a wavelength less than or equal to the equivalent bandgap energy (E g), which is assumed to be constant in the bulk material. The photogenerated electron–hole pair has a number of competing possible pathways and these can be controlled through surface modifications and addition of electrolytes or reactive redox species [20–25]. These excitation pathways are bulk recombination via inter-bandgap states, light emission through direct exciton recombination, recombination via crystal surface states, electrons lost in the CB to an electrochemical process, and holes lost in the VB to an electrochemical process (Fig. 2). For ideal H2S and H2O splitting, the latter two processes should be dominant in redox reactions for O2, S and H2 formation. Anodic oxidation processes are critical in the dissolution of the surface of nanoparticles. For sulfides, dissolution yields sulfite and sulfate species and the associated metal counterion in solution [26]. When a particle moves from the 3D bulk structure to a dimensionless nanoparticle with a radius less than that of the Bohr radius, quantum confinement occurs [27]. This has a significant effect on the energetics and physics of semiconducting materials, as described through the Brus equation [28] .(1) E g = E g bulk + h 2 π 2 2 r 2 ( 1 m e ⁎ + 1 m h ⁎ ) − 1.8 e 2 4 π ε ε o r As the radius of a nanoparticle decreases below the Bohr radius, which is approximately 5nm for most semiconductors [29], the bandgap increases, decreasing the absorption and emission wavelengths of the semiconductor. This can be an issue in obtaining visible-light excitation [30]. The redox properties of a photoexcited semiconductor depend predominantly on the energetic positions of the highest energy state of the VB and the lowest energy state of the CB. It is evident from reactions (2) and (3) [31] that the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the CB must be >0eV to catalyze reduction of water to hydrogen, and similarly the quasi-Fermi level of holes in the VB must be <1.23eV to oxidize water in the relatively unfavorable four-hole process [32]: (2) 2H+ + 2e– → H2 (E°Red = 0eV) (3) 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+ (E°Ox = –1.23eV)"
2,Mechanism of H2S photolysis in the liquid phase,"1.2 Mechanism of H2S photolysis in the liquid phase As pointed out in Section 1, H2S is an ideal source for H2 production. H2S is a weak diprotic acid with pK a values of 7.0 and 11.96 [33]. In 0.5 M KOH solution at pH 13.5, the two acid dissociation reactions of H2S occur, yielding hydrosulfide HS– and sulfide S2– ions in equilibrium. On bandgap excitation, the photocatalyst generates CB electrons (eCB –) and VB holes (hVB +). The holes oxidize HS– and S2– ions to disulfide ion S2 2–, releasing a proton from HS–. eCB – reduces protons to molecular hydrogen that is then evolved. This is an established mechanism and has been confirmed by many studies of photolysis of H2S and sulfide ion [33]. As hVB + oxidation of HS–/S2– to S2 2– and proton reduction to H2 proceed, a continuous flow of H2S into the photoreactor helps to maintain dissolution equilibria (4) and (5), and sustain the H2 generation: (4) H2S + OH– ↔ HS– + H2O (5) H2S + OH– ↔ S2– + H2O (6) Photocatalyst ⟹ h ν e CB − + h VB + (7) 2S2– + 2h+ VB → S2 2– (8) 2HS– + 2h+ VB → S2 2– + 2H+ (9) 2H+ + 2e– CB → H2 (10) Net: H2S → H2 + polysulfide. This is an established mechanism and has been confirmed by many studies of photolysis of H2S and sulfide ion [33]. As hVB + oxidation of HS–/S2– to S2 2– and proton reduction to H2 proceed, a continuous inflow of H2S helps to maintain the equilibria and promotes H2 evolution."
3,Mechanism of H2S photolysis in the gas phase,1.3 Mechanism of H2S photolysis in the gas phase Very few studies of the gas-phase photocatalytic process have been reported. The mechanism for gas-phase photocatalysis is as follows: (11) Semiconductor → hVB + + eCB – (12) H2S + 2hVB + → S + 2H+ (13) 2H+ +2eCB – → H2.
4,Overview of nano- and micromaterials for photocatalytic H2 production,"1.4 Overview of nano- and micromaterials for photocatalytic H2 production To date, various types of metal oxide semiconductor, including TiO2, SrTiO3, Na2Ti6O13, BaTi4O9, Ta2O5, KTaO3, K4Nb6O17, and K2La2Ti3O10, have been identified as active photocatalysts for H2 production [34–36]. However, most of the catalysts developed so far can only respond to UV light because of their wide bandgaps, making photocatalytic H2 production under sunlight difficult [37]. Some metal sulfide semiconductors such as CdS [38], RuS2 [39], and Zn1–x Cu x S [40,41] can produce H2 under visible light irradiation, but do not work in the absence of a sacrificial agent (electron donor or hole scavenger) such as Na2S, Na2SO3, and NaH2PO2. H2S acts as a so-called hole scavenger. Besides preventing electron–hole-recombination, it also prevents photooxidation of the photocatalyst. Sacrificial agents react with photogenerated holes and thus prevent charge recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes and promote the reaction of photogenerated electrons with H2S to produce H2. Organic compounds such as methanol, ethanol, and formic and oxalic acids can also be used as sacrifice agents for CdS [38]. Kawai and Sakata investigated H2 production from biomass such as glucose, sugar, starch, and woods over a RuO2–Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst [42–44]. Their findings suggest the possible use of biomass as sacrificial agents, especially for metal sulfide photocatalysts. Several nanomaterials were used for photolytic H2 production. According to a literature review, nanomaterials give better H2 production [45–47] compared to micromaterials [48–53] ( Fig. 3). However, the H2 production varies according to the nanomaterial. Not all nanosized photocatalysts yield maximum production but still give a better yield than the corresponding micromaterial under the same experimental conditions. Deshpande and Gupta studied CdS crystallites of varying size (1–5.0nm) [54]. They found that 2.5-nm CdS particles gave a greater rate of H2 evolution compared to smaller and larger particles. Particles of <1.5nm in diameter showed poor crystallinity and had a significant Q-size effect on the absorption edge. They provided direct evidence of the structural sensitivity of photocatalytic H2O dissociation over supported semiconductor nanocrystallites, in which the particle size and interfacial microstructural defects play a vital role. The influence of semiconductor crystallite size on the photogeneration, transport and relaxation dynamics of charge carriers is well reported [55,56]. The critical role of crystallite size in photocatalytic splitting of water is related to the following factors: (i) particle diameter above the Q-size regime for efficient generation of charge carriers on bandgap excitation; (ii) a large surface/volume ratio to provide a large number of surface active sites for adsorption of water molecules and more efficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers; and (iii) adsorption of reactant molecules or entrapment of charge carriers at microstructural lattice defects associated with nanosized semiconductor materials [56]. The photocatalyst preparation technique is crucial for the yield. Several authors have studied the effect of the nature of the starting compounds on catalytic activity [57]. The preparation method affects the crystallinity and particle size of the catalyst [58]. Both factors seem to play an important role in catalytic activity. Some authors reported that catalytic activity increases with particle diameter in the range 10–100nm, and is constant for smaller particles [59]. However, other authors obtained the best yield for particles with the smallest diameter (in the colloidal range). Müller et al. studied the performance of nanosized and microsized ZnS particles and observed electron–hole pair generation rates of 18/s and 5.3×1010/s, respectively [60]. They determined different positions for CBs located energetically at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface for microsized ZnS and nanosized SnO2, which lead to different reaction mechanisms for light-induced oxidation of ethanol. The quantum yield was 19.6% and 0.034% for nano- and micro-sized ZnS, respectively [60]. Photocatalyst doping with foreign transition elements (cationic doping) is one approach for improving catalytic efficiency [61–63]. In particular, Ni- and Cu-doped ZnS photocatalysts show activity for H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation even without a Pt co-catalyst. Many researchers have reported doping methods for CdS, ZnS, VS, VS4, and WO3 [64–67]. Another approach for synthesizing photocatalysts that are active in the visible region is to dope N, C or S into the anionic network of a wide-bandgap metal oxide catalyst (anionic doping). Nitrides (Ta3N5 ), oxynitrides (TaON, LaTiO2N), and oxysulfides (Sm2Ti2S2O5 ) have been used as active photocatalysts [68–73]. Results show that the bandgap energy for the Ta–O–N system can be tuned by adjusting the amount of doped nitrogen, which leads to changes in the electrical properties of the material. Photocatalytic decomposition of (NH4)2WS4 in the pores of mesoporous TiO2 with subsequent photodeposition of platinum leads to the formation of a TiO2/WS2/Pt nanoheterostructure [74] with catalytic activity for H2 release from aqueous solutions of Na2S under the influence of visible light. Deposition of CdS nanoparticles on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 gives photocatalysts for H2 release from aqueous solutions of isopropyl alcohol or Na2S–Na2SO3 [75,76]. The activity increased with decreasing CdS nanoparticle size because of quantum-dimensional effects and in particular an increase in the energy of photogenerated electrons in the CB of CdS [77,78]."
5,Reactor design and nanomaterials required for photocatalytic H2 production,
6,Liquid-phase photocatalytic H2 production,"2.1 Liquid-phase photocatalytic H2 production 2.1.1 Liquid-phase photocatalytic reactor The typical liquid-phase photocatalytic reactor used in our laboratory for H2 production is shown in Fig. 4. This photocatalytic reactor of 500mL was irradiated with a pen-type visible lamp. The reactor has two tubes, one for purging with N2 gas and the other for collecting H2 gas by downward displacement of water. The light source is a 150-W tungsten halogen lamp. In a typical experiment, 400mL of 0.5M aqueous KOH was vigorously stirred and purged with N2 for 1h and then with bubbling H2S gas for 1h (sulfide concentration 16,000mg/L). Then 0.2g of the catalyst was added and H2S was input at a flow rate of 2.5mL/min, with excess gas trapped in NaOH solution. The aqueous slurry was irradiated with visible light. The H2 that was evolved was collected in a water displacement jar and was analyzed by GC (Shimadzu 14B instrument with an MS-5A column, thermal conductivity detection and N2 carrier gas). Typical results for photocatalytic H2 production are listed in Table 1 for several photocatalysts. 2.1.2 Spinel photocatalysts For spinel metal oxides active in the visible light range, studies on photodecomposition of H2S are rare. Lu and Li evaluated photocatalysis by ZnFe2O4 spinel over a wide pH range of 8–12 for H2 production from sulfide solution under visible light [79]. Two spinel oxides, CuMn2O4 and ZnMn2O4, with p-type conductivity and visible bandgaps were investigated for photoassisted H2 production from aqueous sulfide and sulfite solutions [80]. Saadi et al. measured photoassisted H2 evolution under visible light irradiation over CuM2O4 (M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co) [81]. Apart from these studies, virtually no attempt has been made to use spinel metal oxide photocatalysts for solar H2 production from aqueous sulfide solution. It has been reported that in water splitting for H2 production, d10 metal oxides exhibit better efficiency [82,83]. These results prompted a study in which CuGa2O4 spinel in pristine and Fe3+-doped states (CuGa2–x Fe x O4, x = 0.6) containing Ga, a d10 p-block element, without and with noble metal oxide loading (NiO or RuO2, 1.0wt.%) was prepared and characterized to identify stable and efficient photocatalysts for visible-light photoproduction of H2 from aqueous sulfide solution [84]. Fe2O3 and FeGa2O3 were also used as spinel photocatalysts with visible light activity for H2S decomposition and H2 generation [85]. 2.1.3 CdS and CdS-based nanomaterials There has been considerable work on photocatalytic H2 production from H2S dissolved in water or alkali solution [51,76,78,86]. The most favored photocatalyst is CdS alone or as a mixture with other semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnS, and SrTiO3. These semiconductor photocatalysts perform better when loaded with co-catalysts such as Pt and RuO2. Experimental data show that photoreactors with passive mixing provide a potentially viable and cost-effective design suitable for implementation on a large scale [47]. Composite photocatalysts comprising CdS nanowires of high crystallinity decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully fabricated via solvothermal and sol–gel methods and were highly active for H2 production from water containing sulfide and sulfite ions as hole scavengers under visible-light irradiation. A CdS/TiO2 ratio of 0.2 showed the highest activity for H2 evolution. This configuration resulted in efficient charge separation due to fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated from CdS towards TiO2. CdS-based photocatalysts in a system comprising H2S dissolved in NaOH solution showed comparable H2 production activity to a system of water containing Na2S/Na2SO3 [87]. CdS+TiO2/RuO2 combinations involving coupling of two semiconductor materials [88] revealed that the extent of electron–hole recombination (≤ 30 ps in CdS) [90] is reduced and the catalytic efficiency is higher for microheterogeneous dispersions. Charge separation can thus be achieved through selective transfer of CB electrons from CdS to TiO2 particles; transfer of holes between VBs is inhibited for energetic reasons. Apart from its importance in solar energy harvesting, H2S photocleavage should be useful in industrial processes in which H2S or sulfides occur as polluting and toxic waste products for which rapid removal and conversion into useful fuels (e.g., H2) is highly desirable. Several investigators reported that irradiation of aqueous suspensions of various semiconductors containing a variety of dissolved reagents can be used to produce H2, thereby converting solar energy into a nonpolluting fuel [88–96]. Among these semiconductors, TiO2 has been used the most, but noble metals must be deposited on its surface to obtain hydrogen. However, it can only absorb radiation with wavelengths <410nm, whereas solar radiation in the visible range is abundant [95–97]. CdS is a well-characterized semiconductor capable of absorbing visible light [91,98–102]. Unfortunately, it undergoes anodic photodecomposition in pure water. Hence, electron donors have to be added to the solution to circumvent decomposition via sacrificial consumption of the donors. EDTA, cysteine, glycine, formic acid, isopropanol, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, glucose, albumin, cellulose, sulfide, and sulfite have been used as sacrificial agents. In general, these compounds are expensive, which precludes commercial development of photocatalytic H2 production using this approach. By contrast, large quantities of sulfide are produced in refinery industries and these can be utilized as electron donors for large-scale H2 recovery. The reactions involve lead not only to H2 but also to thiosulfates, which can be used as a fertilizer. The influence of several experimental variables on the rate of H2 photoproduction from aqueous solutions of sulfides and sulfites has been reported by various investigators [100,102–104]. To enhance CdS activity, efforts have been made to combine it with other semiconductors with different band energies, including TiO2/CdS, ZnO/CdS, ZnS/CdS [105,106], K4Nb6O17/CdS [107], and K2Ti4O9/CdS composites [108,109]. An alternative approach to enhance CdS photoactivity is to couple CdS with mesoporous materials to form hybrid or composite photocatalysts. In these cases, electrons photogenerated in CdS can move freely into the framework of porous molecules of the attached semiconductor, while photogenerated holes are trapped in CdS. Therefore, high charge separation and photoutilization can be achieved. Efforts have also to be made to improve the stability of the metal sulfide. The surface of a CdS photocatalyst was modified with nanostep structures and this resulted in much higher H2 production rates compared to CdS prepared by common procedures [110]. Enrichment of Pt nanoparticles in the nanostep regions was considered indispensable for this enhanced H2 production. The activity of this photocatalyst was further improved by coupling it to a zirconium titanium phosphate mesoporous support [111]. It is expected that such a composite photocatalyst would require lower amounts of noble metal and would have better stability and efficiency. It is worth noting that this strategy has been successfully applied to other sulfides such as WS2 [112]. H2S, which is a by-product in the coal and petroleum industries, can be oxidized to S on CdS surfaces. A quantum yield of ~50% was obtained for the reaction between sulfide anions and photogenerated VB holes in CdS suspensions. Oxidation of S2– and HS– in colloidal In2S3 suspension was carried out by laser flash photolysis [113]. Loading of CdS particles with RuO2 enhanced the efficiency of H2S cleavage [52,114–117]. Addition of sulfite also facilitated H2S cleavage by removing S from the semiconductor surface to generate a desirable product, thiosulfate [114–117]. Further modifications of ZnS photocatalysts include the formation of a solid solution with other sulfides and doping with transition metals. ZnS as a photocatalyst is active only in the UV region because of its high bandgap of 3.2eV. However, after doping with Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+, ZnS can catalyze H2 production under visible-light irradiation [118–120]. Cu–ZnS displayed significantly enhanced activity for H2 production. XPS analysis showed that the copper species existed as Cu2+ [121]. Typical results for CdS-based photocatalysts for H2 production are listed in Table 2. 2.1.4 Perovskite nanoparticles Kanade et al. synthesized layered perovskites (Pb2Ga2Nb2O10 and RbPb2Nb2O7) for photocatalytic H2 production by photodecomposition of H2S [122]. Among the various types of photocatalysts, layered perovskites are particularly good [123], presumably because of intercalation of substrate into the interlayer space. Perovskite oxide materials based on Nb5+, Ta5+, and Ti4+ have been used as photocatalysts for decomposition of water under UV irradiation [124–126]. However, the high bandgap for these materials (3.8–4.0eV) prohibits their use in visible domain. In particular, Ruddlesden–Popper and Aurivillius-phase perovskites have high photocatalyst efficiency and good quantum yields [127–129]. The efficiency of a semiconductor photocatalyst is sensitive to the physical characteristics such as the crystal phase, size and morphology of the particles [128,129]. Nanosized Pb2Ga2Nb2O10 (20–40nm) and RbPb2Nb2O7 (70–90nm) showed good catalytic efficiency owing to their large surface/volume ratio and short charge-transport pathway [130–133]. Therefore, it is prudent to tune the particle size of the perovskite photocatalyst in the desired nano range to achieve high catalytic efficiency. Molten salt synthesis has been used to prepare nanosized semiconducting materials for different applications. Kanade et al. synthesized a niobium zirconium oxynitride visible-light photocatalyst via thermal ammonolysis of Nb2Zr6O17 at 1073K [134]. Doping caused splitting of bulk particles into well-aligned perovskite layers of particles with an average size of 80–90nm. The undoped oxynitride photocatalyst showed excellent activity (QY 13.5%) compared to Pt- and RuO2-doped catalysts for H2 generation from H2S under visible-light irradiation. 2.1.5 Nanostructured ZnO Nanostructured ZnO is especially important in hi-tech applications owing to its unique chemical and physical properties [135–137]. ZnO is a promising semiconductor material because of its environmental stability and low cost compared to other binary nanosized metal oxides. In some applications (e.g., catalysts) particle morphology plays a vital role in the reactivity of the ZnO surface [138–140]. Reviews of nanocrystalline photocatalysts such as ZnO, CuO, and SrCO3 revealed the significance of morphology for photocatalytic activity [141–144]. Most studies have focused on high-bandgap semiconductor oxides, such as ZnO, whose photoexcitation requires more energy and thus needs UV light to produce electron–hole pairs for H2 production. It should be noted that photocatalytic H2 production by sulfide photocatalysts requires less energy owing to their lower bandgap. Therefore, combinations of high-bandgap ZnO with low-bandgap sulfide semiconductors hold potential for efficient H2 production. Cu-doped ZnO is self-aligned with good crystallinity. It has been reported that photocatalytic activity depends on crystallinity rather than the surface area or particle size [145]. From UV-diffuse reflectance spectra of ZnO samples it is evident that copper doping narrows the bandgap, largely because of the Cu 3d levels [146]. 2.1.6 Colloidal noble-metal-decorated semiconductor nanocrystals Colloidal noble-metal-decorated semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted significant interest for photocatalytic H2 generation [147–151]. Advances in colloidal chemistry have facilitated unprecedented control of the size, shape, and composition of semiconductor nanocrystals [152]. Thus, the optical and electronic properties of the materials can be simultaneously controlled beyond their bulk properties. Consequently, a better understanding of these nanomaterials for H2 generation as a source of renewable energy is expected. The general strategy for photocatalytic H2 generation using colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals is to decorate them with small catalyst particles for water reduction. After light absorption, photoelectrons are transferred to the catalyst particles and reduce water to generate hydrogen. Most photocatalytic nanosystems reported so far use a hole scavenger, a sacrificial chemical that is oxidized in the photocatalytic process and removes holes from the nanostructure. This facilitates H2 generation by preventing electron–hole recombination and stabilizing nanocrystals against photooxidation. In general, the use of sacrificial hole scavengers is considered a disadvantage since fresh hole scavenger needs to be supplied to maintain photocatalytic activity. However, hole scavengers such as sulfides and sulfites are by-products of fossil energy sources and are produced in petrochemical industries [153]. Thus, their use in H2 generation may be economically and environmentally meaningful and may offset their perceived disadvantages. Therefore, the dependence of photocatalytic activity on the nature of the hole scavenger for a given photocatalytic nanosystem needs to be addressed systematically. Berr et al. synthesized CdS nanorods decorated with Pt clusters and compared the redox potential of SO2 3–, TEA, EDTA, and MeOH as hole scavengers [153]. SO2 3– had the highest oxidation potential (i.e., weakest bound electrons) with an electronic energy level 3.0eV. This suggests that H2 generation and nanorod stability are correlated with the oxidation potential of the hole scavenger: the higher the oxidation potential, the more efficient is H2 production and the more stable are the nanorods. Amirav and Alivisatos reported on photocatalytic H2 production with seeded CdSe/CdS nanorods tipped with 3-nm Pt nanoparticles [154]. In these multicomponent nanoheterostructures, holes are confined in the CdSe core, allowing improved separation of photogenerated excitons, while electrons can readily move through the CdSe–CdS interface to reach Pt particles, which catalyze reduction of H2O to H2 in the presence of methanol as a hole scavenger. The apparent quantum yield was 20% at 450nm. Using CdS nanorods decorated with subnanometer-sized Pt clusters, Berr et al. achieved photocatalytic H2 production with up to 3.9% efficiency under UV-visible illumination [155]. They also that highly selective decoration of CdS nanorods with relatively large (mean 4.8nm) uniform Pt nanoparticles, randomly distributed along the rod length and very seldom located at the tip, gave a remarkably high yield (90%) for samples decorated with exactly one Pt particle per rod. Nevertheless, these samples did not show a higher H2 evolution rate compared to small Pt clusters, which implies that efficient H2 production is possible using CdS nanostructures with lower amounts of Pt. This hybrid system thus demonstrates the advantages of Pt clusters in comparison to Pt nanoparticles in terms of photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it provides an excellent model for further studies of light-induced charge separation in semiconductor–metal nanoheterostructures."
7,Gas-phase photocatalytic H2 production,"2.2 Gas-phase photocatalytic H2 production 2.2.1 Gas-phase photocatalytic reactor design Gas–solid-phase photocatalytic splitting of H2S in an anaerobic environment can yield hydrogen energy by utilizing solar energy. A gas-phase five-channel photocatalytic reactor for H2 production is shown in Fig. 5 [121]. The reactor has a quartz shutter window and a 300-W Xe lamp for illumination. The volume of a single channel is 7cm×1cm×0.8cm. A particulate photocatalyst (0.40g) was homogeneously dispersed in the reactor channels. The reactor was swept with Ar gas for 20min to flush out all air prior to each irradiation. A gas mixture of 5% H2S/Ar was fed continuously through each of the reactor channels at a rate of 6±0.5mL/min. After reaction, H2S in the mixed gas was eliminated by purging in 2M NaOH and 0.5M CuSO4 solutions. The tail gas was gathered by draining the water. The amount of H2 produced was analyzed by gas chromatography [121]. 2.2.2 Photocatalysts for gas-phase H2 recovery For gas-phase photocatalytic H2 production from H2S, solar energy is utilized as a renewable resource. Instead of the sulfide waste stream in the liquid-phase process, H2S gas is fed into a closed reactor containing the catalyst for gas-phase H2 recovery. Nanoparticular TiO2, CdS, ZnS, ZnO, and ZnIn2S4–ZnS were used as photocatalysts for gas-phase H2 recovery from waste H2S gas [121]. Photocatalytic splitting of H2S to produce H2 is usually carried out in aqueous solution [156], with very few reports on gas–solid-phase production [157]. The maximum H2 yield achieved so far for gas-phase photocatalytic production is only 3.6μmol/h (0.08mL/h) [121] which is negligible compared to liquid-phase recovery (1.88L/h) [158]. Moreover, in the absence of oxygen, H2S can be selectively oxidized to elemental sulfur (S), which makes it possible to recycle S from H2S while producing H2. Thermal decomposition and photosplitting of H2S were carried out in a cylindrical photothermal furnace using vanadium sulfide on Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO and ZnS as catalyst. A 30-mL Pyrex reaction vessel was used with a light flux of 130 mW/cm in a static system. The conversion increased to more than 7.5% for V x S y /ZnS, while photoactivation of the catalyst increased the H2S conversion by up to 40%, depending on the temperature and V x S y support material. It has been proposed that photon absorption by these catalysts at high temperature leads to changes in the molecular excited states and photoproduction of electrons and holes at the surface. The mechanism for splitting of H2S to hydrogen involves reaction enhancement by the direct action of solar radiation [158]."
8,Solar photocatalytic H2 production,"Semiconducting oxides appear to be the most promising materials for photocatalytic H2 production. The bandgap width is one of the most critical properties of nano photocatalytic materials because it determines the amount of solar energy to be absorbed and available for conversion. For H2S photolysis, the lower theoretical limit is 0.17eV (energy required to split H2S). Semiconductors with wider bandgaps exhibit better stability than those with small and medium bandgaps, but show lower H2 production ability in solar light [159]. Therefore, coupling of semiconductors with different bandgaps is a good approach for preparing photocatalysts with high activity and good stability. Excited electrons can be transferred in coupled semiconductors from the high CB to the low CB, leading to efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Enhanced solar photocatalytic H2 production over coupled semiconductors, including CdS/TiO2 [159], ZnS/TiO2 [160], Cu2O/TiO2 [161], CuO/TiO2 [162,163], WO3/SiC–TiO2 [164], SrTiO3/TiO2 [165], SnO2/TiO2 [166], Ta2O3/TiO2 [167], and CuO/Al2O3/TiO2 [168], has been extensively investigated. Deposition of CuO and Al2O3 in TiO2 increased solar photocatalytic H2 by a factor of approximately 10 compared to pure TiO2. The effect of carbon on the bandgap of TiO2–x was investigated by Khan et al. [169]. Reduction of TiO2–x affected the formation of donor levels (oxygen vacancies) and decreased the bandgap from 3eV to 2eV. The decrease in TiO2–x bandgap resulted in an increase in solar energy absorption because the energy spectrum available for absorption increased from 7% to 40%."
9,Perspectives,"H2S splitting photocatalyzed by nanomaterials for H2 production has been extensively studied. There is growing awareness that hydrogen is the fuel of the future. Hydrogen production from water splitting is considerable, since water is a renewable resource. However, it is essential to recover H2 from industrial waste H2S. Since H2S occurs as a waste stream from petroleum refining, the photocatalytic process is a suitable approach for H2 production. H2 generation from H2S using solar energy is a leading candidate for renewable and environmentally safe energy production for the following reasons: • Solar photocatalytic H2 production is relatively simple and the cost of such fuel is expected to be substantially less than the present price of gasoline. • The only raw material required for solar production of hydrogen is H2S, which is emitted by refining industries in huge quantities (98% of the sulfide content). The development of solar photocatalytic processes requires novel nanosized semiconducting materials for efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical energy in the form of H2. Very low process efficiency is the main hurdle. This low efficiency is attributed to rapid recombination of photorelevant electron donors. Catalytic modification techniques, such as noble metal loading, ion doping and phosphor doping, are also being studied for maximum H2 production."
10,Conclusion,"The quantum efficiency for wide-bandgap oxide catalysts is worse in the UV range than in the visible range for catalysts with a low bandgap. Thus, it is necessary to narrow the bandgap of photocatalysts to harvest visible light of longer wavelengths and enhance photogenerated charge separation in photocatalysis. High-efficiency and cost-effective H2S splitting systems based on these photocatalysts should also be constructed. Photocatalysts free of noble metals are highly preferable considering that they can be readily used in a more economic way. It is anticipated that this demonstration of solar photocatalytic H2 production will attract attention for further studies in a promising direction. From the literature reviewed so far, it is evident that liquid-phase recovery yields greater H2 production than gas-phase recovery. The current lack of industrial applications of this technology can mainly be attributed to two reasons: the low photocatalytic efficiency due to large-size photocatalysts and the resulting lack of agreement on how to quantify this efficiency, in particular for nanosized photocatalysts and reactor configurations. Therefore, for nanosized catalysts, reactor design and cost reductions for large-scale applications have to be given special priority. The other challenge is successful scale-up of laboratory-scale photocatalysis to an industrially relevant scale. These two issues have been the object of our research and will also be the focus of our study in the future."
