0,Introduction,"The hydrogenation of CO2 is considered as a possible way to reuse captured CO2, thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and recycling carbon species [1–3]. Among the most interesting CO2 hydrogenation products, CO through reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS), methane through methanation, linear higher hydrocarbons through the CO2- Fischer-Tropsch process, methanol and higher alcohols are taken into consideration in the scientific community. Cobalt catalysts are active in hydrogenation reactions typically realized with CO: in particular, Co/Al2O3 is the basic formulation of industrial catalysts for the low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) process producing Diesel fuel and waxes from syngases [4–6], where methane is the main product on molar basis. However, also Co/SiO2 catalysts have been reported as good catalysts for LTFT [7,8]. Unsupported cobalt also shows LTFT activity, but well lower than that of Co/Al2O3 [9]. Unsupported and silica-supported cobalt alloyed with copper and/or manganese is reported as an interesting catalyst for production of oxygenates (such as higher alcohols) from CO hydrogenation [10–12] On the other hand, cobalt catalysts are also of interest for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis starting from CO2 [13,14] and are reported to have a remarkable activity for methanation of both CO and CO2 [15]. However, Kuznecova and Guska [16] ranked low cobalt catalyst for CO and CO2 methanation for low activity, selectivity and stability. In previous studies we found that Al2O3- supported Ni catalysts have interesting activity in CO2 methanation [17], that can be improved by modifying the support [18], while unsupported Ni particles have, depending on the preparation, weak activity in methanation, together with reverse water gas shift activity [19]. To look at improving CO2 hydrogenation catalysts based on transition metal catalysts, we take forward our previous study on unsupported CoNPs [20–23] and further investigate the behaviour of cobalt based catalysts. In this paper, we report on the activity of unsupported cobalt and of silica-supported cobalt catalysts, by choosing different precursor, i.e. cobalt nitrate or acetate, to evaluate the possible effect in the catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparations,"2.1 Catalysts preparations Unsupported Co nanoparticles (CoNPs) were prepared by Co2(CO)8 thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere by using anhydrous toluene as a solvent. The solution of the solvent and cobalt precursor with a nominal concentration of 1.5 * 10−2 molL−1 was kept under reflux for 2 h. As previously reported [21], CoNPs were separated from the reaction mixture by a filtering step and then washed and dried according to previous determined procedure [21]. In order to have catalysts with a limited metal support interaction, allowing a reliable comparison with CoNPs, commercial silica gel (Carlo Erba, SBET ̴ 350 m2/g), calcined at 823 K for 3 h has been chosen as suitable support. The synthesis of Cobalt based catalysts has been carried out by conventional wet impregnation starting from Co(NO3)2*6H2O and Co(CH3COO)2*4H2O aqueous solutions, respectively, keeping a total Co loading of 20 wt.%. The catalysts have been then dried at 373 K overnight and then calcined at 823 K for 3 h. The following sample notation will be adopted: CoSN and CoSA for nitrate and acetate precursors, respectively."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by using a vertical powder diffractometer X’Pert with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm), in the 20–100° 2θ range with a step of 0.02° and a counting time of 18 s for each step. Powder patterns were then interpreted on the basis of available data in the Pearson’s Crystal Data database [24]. FE-SEM measurements were carried out by means of a scanning electron microscope ZEISS SUPRA 40 VP, with a field emission gun. This instrument is equipped with both a high sensitivity “InLens” secondary electrons detector and an EDX microanalysis OXFORD “INCA Energie 450 × 3”. Sample preparation for both fresh and exhaust catalysts consists in the deposition of pure powders on a high purity conductive double sided adhesive carbon tabs. IR spectra of the exhaust catalysts were recorded with ThermoFisher Instrument using KBr pressed disks (1 wt. % sample in KBr, total weight 1.00 g). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis-NIR of both fresh and exhaust catalysts have been recorded by using a Jasco V-570 at room temperature in air. As a comparison Co3O4 produced by Carlo Erba was also characterized by means of UV–vis."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments A tubular silica glass flow reactor, containing a fixed bed with 88.2 mg of catalyst (CoSA or CoSN) or 17.6 mg of unsupported CoNPs mixed with 700 mg of silica glass particles 0.25–0.21 mm (corresponding to 60–70 mesh sieved) was used in steady-state catalytic experiments. CO2 hydrogenation experiments were conducted with the following feed gas: 6% CO2, 30% H2 and N2 balance, used as carrier gas. In order to follow any hysteresis, activation or deactivation effects, experiments were performed both in ascending and descending reaction temperature (523 K, 573 K, 623 K, 673 K, 723 K, 773 K and reverse), by keeping the set reaction temperature for 30 min. Online products analysis was performed using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR instrument. Frequencies, where CO2, CH4 and CO molecules absorb weakly, were used (2293 cm−1 for CO2, 2170 cm−1 for CO, 1333 cm−1 for CH4, after subtraction of baseline) with previous calibration, using gas mixtures with known concentrations, in order to have quantitative results. Produced water was condensed right before IR cell. From the inlet and outlet concentrations calculated from the absorbances of CO, CO2, CH4 and the measured inlet and outlet total flows (which allow to take into account the variation of the number of moles during the reaction), CO2 conversion (XCO2), selectivities and yields to products, Si and Yi, were calculated [25]. They are defined as: (1) X C O 2 = F C O 2 i n - F C O 2 o u t F C O 2 i n (2) S i = F i F C O 2 i n - F C O 2 o u t (3) Y i = F i F C O 2 i n where Fi is the molar flow rate of i (i.e. CO and CH4), while FCO2 is the molar flow rate of CO2 and they were all expressed in mol/min. No other products were detected in our analysis. To confirm data coming from IR analysis, occasionally, product analysis was also performed by gas-chromatography (Agilent 4890)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the fresh catalysts Sample notation, cobalt salt precursors and both theoretical and effective Co loading are reported in Table 1 . According to previous literature [20,21,23], and confirmed also in the present case, the freshly prepared unsupported CoNPs are amorphous. The IR spectrum of freshly prepared CoNPs does not show relevant feature except for a weak component at 510 cm−1 that arises from the presence of small quantity of CoO [26], not detectable through other techniques. After an annealing procedure in Argon at 773 K (maximum temperature reached in CO2 hydrogenation experiments), CoNPs result in a mixture of crystalline cubic and hexagonal cobalt (Fig. 1 ). Fresh Co/SiO2 samples show the expected XRD pattern of the Co3O4 spinel phase (Fig. 1) with weaker features for CoSA than CoSN in accordance with previous literature [27]. Moreover, incoherent scattering feature associated to amorphous silica (2θ = 20–35°) is present. The UV–vis-NIR spectra of the fresh silica-supported catalysts (CoSA and CoSN) have been compared with that of commercial Co3O4 (Fig. 2 ). All spectra show common features, with a typical broad doublet in the near IR region around 1320 nm and 1495 nm, another broad complex feature around 700 nm and a maximum around 400 nm, as reported in the literature for Co3O4 [28,29]. The spectrum of CoSN is closely similar to that of Co3O4, with a remarkable difference in the relative intensities of the two components, confirming that it contains essentially Co3O4. Instead, the spectrum of sample CoSA presents an additional strong triplet located at 527, 593 and 634 nm. Similar triplets are observed in the spectra of several cobalt- containing materials: crystalline cobalt silicates, such as Co2SiO4 and MgCoSiO4 (Olivine structure) [30], glasses containing cobalt [31], Co exchanged zeolites and Co supported on silica-alumina [32,33]. These absorptions arises from the three spin- allowed d-d transitions of Co2+ (t1 g(4F) → 4t2 g(4F), 4t1 g(4F) → 4a2 g(4F), and 4t1 g(4F) → 4t1 g(4P) [30]). Thus, from visible characterization it is possible to conclude that CoSA contains both Co3O4 particles and isolated Co2+ species in the silica matrix, that form a cobalt silicate phase, that can be attained as amorphous or in concentration below the detectability limit of the XRD instrument. The envisaged differences of CoSA and CoSN samples are attributed to the different precursor and in particular to the resulting different pH of the impregnating solutions. The use of cobalt acetate results in a slightly basic impregnating solution which would cause partial silica dissolution, whose reprecipitation would result in the entrance of Co in the outer layers of SiO2 support in the final catalyst. The FE-SEM micrographs of fresh amorphous cobalt nanoparticles (Fig. 3 a) show agglomerated globular particles with an average size of 70 nm. The morphology of the Co3O4 particles in the sample CoSA (Fig. 3b) is characterized by similar size particles, sometimes associated into large aggregates of variable size and shape. In the case of sample CoSN (Fig. 3c), the small elemental particles are less evident while the aggregates are more homogeneous achieving an average size of 100–200 nm."
7,Catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation The catalytic activity of the investigated samples in CO2 hydrogenation are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . Already at 523 K, CoNP catalyst is active in the production of both CO and CH4. The activity increases by increasing temperature in agreement with the kinetic control observed in these conditions. However, in the isothermal steps the yield to methane clearly decreases while the CO yield is nearly constant in each steps or even slightly increases. Overall, CO2 conversion points out a severe catalyst deactivation upon the isothermal steps. Looking at the complete experiment, it is clear that the methanation process is deactivated fast and almost completely, being methane almost not produced in the decreasing temperature part of the experiment. Instead, the yield to CO is quite constant or even increasing in the steps. However, by looking at constant temperature in both the increasing and decreasing experiment, it is possible to confirm that also CO yield is lower and this suggest that a slow deactivation phenomenon occurs for its production. The results are interpreted considering the occurrence of two reactions: (4) reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS): CO2 + H2 ⇄ CO + H2O (5) CO2 methanation (CO2M) CO2 + 4 H2 ⇄ CH4 + 2 H2O In this case, the reactions behave independently and differently, suggesting that they occur over two different sites. It can tentatively be supposed that rWGS occurs over oxidised particles, and deactivates slowly, while CO2M occurs on metallic particles with fast deactivation, in particular at T > 623 K. In the case of CoSA catalyst, a weak activity is found at 523 K with the main production of CO. In the step at 573 K, the activity grows with time on stream almost linearly for both CO and CH4, with a slightly higher yield to CO with respect to CH4. This is interpreted suggesting that in these conditions the catalyst is under transient conditions, i.e. producing the active phase, as a result of the reduction from Co3O4 to CoO first and to Co metal later, as widely reported in the literature. By increasing temperature, the yield to CO increases due to increased rWGS reaction rate. At constant temperature, i.e. considering each isothermal segment, the yield of CO is essentially stable but slightly decreases in the decreasing temperature steps when compared to the increasing temperature ones. Thus, also in this case, a slow deactivation of the rWGS reaction is observed. Methane formation is also observed in the increasing temperature steps of the experiment, but its yield is decreasing within the isothermal steps, showing fast deactivation of the reaction, which is almost complete in the decreasing temperatures steps of the experiment, when methane formation tends to vanish. The overall behavior observed for CoSA is similar to that observed for CoNPs. It seems interesting to remark that the yield to CO is, over these two catalysts, lower than the theoretical yield based on thermodynamics of the rWGS reaction only, but higher than the yield in CO expected if methanation would also be occurring. Again, rWGS and CO2M are independent each other, very likely occurring over two different sites, maybe unreduced cobalt and metallic cobalt, respectively. In both cases, in the decreasing temperature steps, when essentially only CO is formed, methanation is “forbidden”. The behavior of catalyst CoSN is markedly different. While at 523 K small amounts of both CO and CH4 are already observed, at 573 and 623 K the catalyst shows a pronounced activation behavior, with an increase of the production of methane, that results, at 623 K, in a slight decrease of the production of CO. In this case, the yield to CH4 is almost stable within each isothermal segment (i.e. step). The conversion of CO2 is lower than that allowed by thermodynamics of methanation at 723 K and 773 K, with a CO coproduction markedly superior to the one allowed by thermodynamics if also methane production is allowed. The conversion of CO2 is, in the temperature descending steps, slightly lower than in the temperature ascending steps, with again a more pronounced decrease of methane yield than CO one. Looking at the overall CO2 conversion and, in particular, at methanation activity, catalyst CoSN is more active than catalyst CoSA, and is also slightly more resistant to deactivation. Instead, catalyst CoSA is more active than catalyst CoSN in producing CO because of rWGS reaction. However, a weak deactivation is also found for the production of CO. By comparing the CO2 reaction rates with those reported in recent literature, we obtain CO2 reaction rate values of 2.4–2.9*10−5 molCO2 g−1 s−1 at the highest performance that well plays with the results reported in [34] where unsupported cobalt nanoparticles and nanorods have been tested in CO2 hydrogenation at high pressure (10 atm) achieving a CO2 reaction rate of 0.11–5.16*10−5 molCO2 g−1 s−1. However, in our case a less selective behavior is observed and this is mainly due to the copresence of CO as by- product for the chosen operating pressure. Moreover, the results are comparable with those reported for Co/SiO2 and Co/TiO2 catalysts that achieve a CO2 reaction rate of 0.85–5.09*10−5 molCO2 g−1 s−1 in-between 220–400 °C, where also CO is observed among product when operating at 5 atm and in substoichiometric CO2:H2 ratio [35]. Evidence of deactivation has been poorly considered in the literature and one of the available data is for a 20%Co/SiO2 catalysts tested in substoichiometric conditions where a CO2 conversion of 67.4% is achieved with a methane selectivity of 99.7% at 643.15 K [36]."
8,Evaluation of the catalysts deactivation rates,"3.3 Evaluation of the catalysts deactivation rates In Fig. 6 , measured methane concentrations in the outcoming gas for silica-supported CoSA catalysts and CoNPs are reported as a function of time on stream at 623 K, 673 K and 723 K. As previously discussed, a clear deactivation is observed on these two catalysts with regard to CH4 concentration mainly, while CO attains a constant concentration in the gas phase (considered as dry). Methane molar concentration has been fitted with an exponential decay function and giving rise to the following equation [37]: (6) CCH4 = CCH4,qss + A exp(R0*t) where CCH4 is methane concentration in mol/mL on dry basis at time t; CCH4,qss is methane concentration in mol/mL on dry basis at the final point; A is a preexponential factor and R0 is expressed in s−1. The obtained values on the different catalysts and for different temperatures are reported in Tables 2 and 3 for CoSA and CoNPs, respectively. The R0 values obtained for CoSA and CoNPs are similar, showing that deactivation rate is similar, and thus suggesting that a similar deactivation mechanism may occur. Only at 723 K, unsupported CoNPs deactivate quicker than supported particles and this might suggest that faster sintering additionally occurs at this T for unsupported nanoparticles. The absolute value of R0 represents the numerical value of the apparent deactivation kinetic constant. The characteristic deactivation time could be expressed as tdeact = 1/|R0|, that might represent a relevant parameter during catalysts operation. tdeact ranges in between 556 s and 488 s where the catalyst loses almost 30% of the catalytic activity with the exception of Co NPs at 723 K that loses 80% of the catalytic activity, thus becoming completely inactive towards methane production."
9,Characterization of spent catalysts after methanation experiments,"3.4 Characterization of spent catalysts after methanation experiments In Fig. 7 , the diffractograms of the catalysts after methanation experiments are reported. In the case of the CoNP catalyst, it is possible to distinguish two different crystalline phases, i.e. the two cobalt metal allotropes: cubic (cF4-Cu) and hexagonal (hP2-Mg) structures [38]. Also a weak and broad peak around 2θ = 26 appears and this is due to the presence of a carbon phase with a certain degree of graphitization. In the case of catalyst CoSN, the features of metallic cobalt in its cubic polymorph (i.e. the high temperature phase [38]) and of cobalt monoxide CoO are observed, with no detection of Co in its second allotropic phase. The detection of cubic cobalt instead of the hexagonal one, which is stable at room temperature is not unusual in CO hydrogenation catalysts [39]. Moreover, it has been reported that it can be stabilized by carbon coating [40]. On the other hand, for nanoparticles the formation of one of the two phases may depend on preparation details [41]. The presence of CoO indicates that the exhaust CoSN catalyst is only partly reduced. A similar result, even if the intensities are strongly reduced, is observed in the case of catalyst CoSA. In both cases, no evidences exist of the formation of partially ordered C phase. The IR spectra of spent Co/silica samples after methanation experiments (Fig. 8 , left), obtained after sieving to separate silica glass particles, show, together with the typical features of silica already observed for fresh silica support (1093, 797 and 465 cm−1), a new band at 668 cm−1 for both catalysts. This band, stronger in the case of sample CoSA, can be assigned to a Co-O-Co stretching mode of octahedral cobalt oxide clusters embedded in the silica matrix, as found e.g. in the IR spectrum and the structure of the cobalt phyllosilicate antigorite (Co3Si2O5(OH)4) [42] where a Co atom is in an octahedral site in an octahedra layer. The UV–vis features of the spent catalysts are reported in Fig. 8 right. The spectra of CoSN shows a continuous diffuse reflectance in all the range as expected taking into account that a large part of cobalt is in the metallic state. The spectrum of CoSA, instead, shows stronger transmittance and the triplet (discussed above for the fresh sample) due to isolated Co2+ dispersed in silica. The data suggest that the octahedral Co clusters and Co silicate species are still present after methanation reaction. In Fig. 9 , the FE-SEM micrographs of the samples after methanation experiments are shown by taking advantage of both secondary (SE) and back-scattered electrons (BSE). In the case of the CoNP sample (Fig. 9a, top and bottom), the comparison of the two pictures shows that two effects occur during methanation: a former one is the partial sintering of the nanoparticles mainly in “necklaces” form by a “fusion” of elemental particles; the latter one is the encapsulation in a carbon shell of the globular metallic particles, with a mean size of 80–150 nm diameter. This is interpreted as an evidence of the formation, during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, of a layer of “encapsulating carbon” that has been revealed also by XRD. A similar situation is observed for CoSA sample, where cobalt particles mostly have 80–150 nm size and the comparison of the particle shapes in the “secondary electrons” images and those obtained using backscattered electrons, indicate that cobalt-containing aggregates or polycrystalline particles are encapsulated in carbon residue covering layers. In the case of CoSN sample, together with cobalt particles mostly in the 80–150 nm size range clearly covered by encapsulating carbon, smaller particles appear to be present, with 20–50 nm size. This second type of particles do not appear to be covered by carbon."
10,Conclusions,"The main conclusion of this work are the following: 1. Unsupported CoNPs and Co/SiO2 catalysts have activity both for reverse Water Gas Shift reaction producing CO and for CO2 methanation. However, the active sites for the two reactions appear to be independent each other. 2. Unsupported metallic cobalt nanoparticles, retaining 80–100 nm size, have significant activity in CO2 methanation, but deactivate upon time on stream and completely at 773 K, due to the formation of encapsulating carbon. More stable activity in rWGS is tentatively attributed to CoO particles. 3. The Co/SiO2 catalysts, which are charged in the reactor in oxide form as Co3O4/SiO2, activate spontaneously by reduction in the CO2/H2 feed at 573 K and above. 4. CoSA catalysts, prepared from cobalt acetate, display an activity similar to that of unsupported particles. Also in this case, particles retain 80–100 nm size and cover by encapsulating carbon. Additionally, however, small amounts of cobalt (II) silicate species are observed both in the fresh and in the spent catalyst. These unreduced species are assumed to be associated to reverse Water Gas Shift reaction. 5. CoSN catalysts, prepared from cobalt nitrate, display a far higher and more stable activity in methanation, together with reverse Water Gas Shift activity. In this case, particles are more heterogeneous in size, within the 10–100 nm size. It is supposed that small cobalt particles are less active in production of carbon layers, thus being less prone to deactivation. Also in this case, unreduced cobalt species like CoO are assumed to be associated to reverse Water Gas Shift reaction. 6. The differences observed among catalysts produced from cobalt acetate and cobalt nitrate can be associated to the different pH of the impregnating solution. Thus, the silica surface is significantly modified. This would reduce the number of the “active surface sites” where small cobalt particles (not producing encapsulating carbon) may form. Thus, only large particles form whose deactivation is far faster."
