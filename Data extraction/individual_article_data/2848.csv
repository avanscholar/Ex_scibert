0,Introduction,"As technology improves, power requirements increase with a decreasing size envelope. Although batteries can provide power for small applications, such as personal electronics or small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they generally cannot provide it for an extended amount of time. To this end, much research has been invested into alternative sources of power with a longer endurance. One alternative is a fuel cell. Fuel cells employ the high gravimetric energy density of H2, but this fuel needs to be stored in a manner that does not dampen the effective specific energy of the power system. Storing enough gaseous hydrogen for long-duration operation requires a high-pressure, heavy storage tank, increasing system mass to unacceptable levels for small scale applications. Instead, liquid, energy-dense fuels can be reformed to produce H2, which can then be fed directly to the fuel cell. Therefore, an improvement in hydrogen production will lead to the advancement of smaller and smarter technology. Several fuels are being investigated for fuel processing applications, including alcohols like methanol and ethanol [1]. Cao and Hohn proposed that formate was one of the important intermediates in the methanol partial oxidation on Pt/Al2O3 [2]. Li and Lin investigated the effects of promoters on the catalytic partial oxidation of methanol over copper–zinc based catalysts [3]. They concluded that interaction between copper and promoter in particular ZrO2 is more critical than copper crystalline size in enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Hebben et al. found that gas-phase reactions play basically no role in fuel conversion by catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol on a Rh/Al2O3 catalyst at millisecond contact times [4]. Salge et al. investigated the catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol and ethanol–water mixtures; high hydrogen selectivities (above 80%) were achieved using a Rh–ceria catalyst at short contact times (∼10 ms) [5]. This catalyst has also been used to reform methanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol with similarly promising high H2 selectivities [6]. Several studies concluded that the reaction pathway of catalytic partial oxidation over Rh/CeO2 [7] or Ir/CeO2 [8] involves dehydration of ethanol to acetaldehyde, which is then decomposed to CH4 and CO or converted to acetone. It was generally believed that strong metal support interaction and high oxygen mobility in the ceria lattice alleviate the problems of carbon formation and sintering of metal particles [7,8]. Little work has been done in the catalytic reforming of heavier alcohols such as butanol. Butanol isomers are an attractive renewable fuel source; the alcohol can be synthesized using yeasts or bacteria, such as Escherichia coli [9–12]. Butanol has a higher energy density than both methanol and ethanol, and a lower hygroscopicity, easing issues of storage and transport associated with ethanol. Previous work by Behrens et al., however, reports that ethanol has a higher H2 selectivity than 1-butanol when using Rh/alumina as a catalyst [13]. 2-Butanol has been decomposed using a Pt/ZrO2 catalyst for hydrogen production [14]. It was found that at temperatures below 275 °C, dehydrogenation is the dominant decomposition pathway; but above this temperature, dehydration occurs to produce water instead of H2. This change was attributed to carbon build-up on the catalyst surface and the alkenes blocking interfacial sites. Isobutanol has been the preferred fuel to synthesize recently, due to its high yield production [9]. Branched-chain alcohols also are known to have higher octane numbers than the straight-chain isomers. Taylor et al. formed linear and branched butenes from isobutanol by dehydrating it over γ-alumina catalysts [16]. These butenes could be further used to create other fuels like gasoline and butyl rubber. Recently, there have been several thermodynamic analyses using Gibbs free energy minimization to optimize hydrogen production by reforming butanol [18,19]. Nahar and Madhani investigated the steam reforming of butanol and optimized the operating conditions to maximize the H2 selectivity and to minimize the CO selectivity for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [18]. In another study, high yield (93–96%) of H2 was achieved for solid oxide fuel cell applications through catalytic partial oxidation of butanol at reaction temperatures between 1115 and 1200 K [19]. The equivalence ratio (ϕ), which compares the actual fuel-to-air ratio of the reactor to the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio, is also an important parameter in fuel reforming. A ϕ value of 1.0 (C/O ratio equal to 1/3) signifies a stoichiometric feed of fuel and air, which for isobutanol is given as (1) i s o - C 4 H 9 OH + 6 O 2 → 4 CO 2 + 5 H 2 O Δ H = − 2670 kJ / mol The ϕ value can be controlled by adjusting the amount of fuel and/or oxygen fed to the reactor. A condition where the ϕ value is greater than unity is considered “fuel rich”, and incomplete combustion occurs because not enough O2 is present to combust the entire amount of fuel; the incomplete combustion process is also known as partial oxidation. Running slightly fuel rich (1 < ϕ < 3) is usually the optimum condition for H2 production. Low ϕ values (between zero and one) indicate a “fuel lean” environment that has more than enough O2 to oxidize all the fuel into its stoichiometric combustion products. In catalytic conversion, the time the reactant has to react with the surface has been shown to play a prominent role in product composition [5,6,17]. The contact time, when considering a monolithic foam, is determined by the volume of the foam, the volume flow rate of the reactants, and the operating temperature of the catalyst foam. With a large enough contact time, the chemistry within the reactor will reach its equilibrium condition. When operating at shorter times, however, intermediate molecules will still be present in the exhaust. The kinetic pathways at these contact times then play a greater role in what is produced. Fig. 1 shows the gas-phase equilibrium calculations of 1-butanol combustion using the backface temperatures and ϕ values from previous work [13]; the thermodynamic data set originates from Sarathy and coworkers [23]. These calculations illustrate formation of methane as a cracking product at equilibrium when ϕ is larger than 1. In contrast, C4 olefins were formed instead of methane when the contact time is in the millisecond regime [13]. This work investigates isobutanol reforming in an adiabatic, catalytic reactor to form H2 suitable for applications such as fuel cells. The effect of adding Rh to the γ-alumina monolith foam for improved performance is also a subject of interest. Using each catalyst, a wide range of equivalence ratios including both fuel lean and fuel rich regimes, at multiple contact times are investigated."
1,Experimental,"Fig. 2 is a schematic of the cylindrical quartz reactor. Premixed nitrogen and oxygen gases entered the reactor near the top; the flow rates of the gases were controlled using mass flow controllers. Liquid fuel entered the reactor via a stainless steel tube with outer and inner diameters of 1.70 mm and 1.20 mm, respectively. The fuel is electrically conductive enough that it can be injected using low power electrospray techniques [20]. Electrospray of the fuel in cone-jet mode was employed by applying a voltage difference between the fuel source and a neutral grounded tantalum mesh (∼3300 V). When operated in cone-jet mode, charged liquid particles are emitted with a narrow droplet size distribution, which allows for a steady state evaporation rate to be established. The grounded tantalum mesh was placed at a distance of 1 cm below the fuel inlet to prevent charge build-up. An inert foam mixer was placed directly under the grounded mesh to mix the fuel vapor with the incoming nitrogen and oxygen gases. This foam provided gas flow uniformity. The mixing foam was 1 cm in thickness. The inner diameter of the reactor was 2 cm. The catalyst was located 12.5 cm below the grounded mesh. Blank alumina foams (45 ppi) with a thickness of 1 cm were placed above and below the catalyst. The foams primarily acted as heat shields and reactant mixers for flow uniformity over the entire catalyst surface. Two types of catalysts were tested. Both were alumina monolith foams (Vesuvius, 80 ppi, 17 mm diameter, 1 cm thick) and coated with γ-alumina. This coating roughens the foam surface and increases the surface area. One of the foams was set aside at this point, and will be referred to as the alumina catalyst. An aqueous Rh(NO3)3 solution was added to the other foam which contained 0.07353 g of Rh. The calcination procedure for the coating and catalyst has been discussed in detail previously [21]. Heating tape supplied sufficient heat to the grounded mesh and mixing foam to a temperature generally a few degrees above the boiling point of the fuel. This ensured complete vaporization and catalytic ignition. Below the heating tape, insulation was wrapped around the reactor, including the catalyst portion to impose adiabatic conditions. Temperatures were observed at the nozzle, ground mesh, and catalyst and were used just as a reference. The effluent gas exits the reactor where it is sent through an Agilent four-channel micro gas chromatograph (GC). The GC columns were molecular sieve, Plot U, alumina and OV-1. These GC measurements are vital in determining how much hydrogen is being produced, and what other byproducts may also be present. The amounts of H2, O2, N2, carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, methane, ethylene, ethane, acetylene, propane, propylene, 2-butyne, butane, isobutane, 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, isobutylene, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, pentane, ethyl acetylene, 1-pentene, trans-2-pentene, cis-2-pentene, hexane, 1-hexene, trans-2-hexene, and cis-2-hexene were monitored using the four-channel micro-GC. Before each experiment, any lingering gases in the reactor were cleared out by passing N2 through the setup. This procedure also aided in leak testing the setup. Heating tape was activated to provide heat to the region between the fuel atomizer and the catalyst. Then the appropriate O2 and N2 flow rates were set to give the equivalence ratio and contact time desired. Once preheating of the reactor was complete and the temperatures showed little change, electrospray in cone-jet mode was activated, and fuel flow was initiated. Voltages were then adjusted to maintain cone stability as needed. The effluent gas composition was determined by the GC after steady temperatures were re-established. Equivalence ratio and contact time are the two operating parameters that were varied while investigating the alumina and Rh catalysts. The equivalence ratios tested ranged from very fuel lean (ϕ = 0.1757, C/O(air) = 0.0586) to fuel rich values up to ϕ = 6.338 (C/O(air) = 2.1126). The equivalence ratio set the total oxygen flow rate, using a set fuel flow rate, which was generally 1.012 mL h−1. At higher ϕ values, the oxygen flow rate would dip below 5 mL min−1, which was too low for the flow controllers; at these ratios, the fuel would be increased instead to keep the oxygen flow rate at acceptable levels for the flow controllers. The nitrogen flow rate was adjusted for each oxygen flow rate to ensure that the total volumetric flow rate of gas remained the same. This was done to keep the contact time inside the reactor the same, within 5 ms, while the equivalence ratio was varied. The catalyst backface temperature was used in calculating the contact times. Fuel conversion was observed using syringe samples of the effluent gas in a separate GC with an Innowax column and a flame ionization detector (FID) (Agilent 6890). The column was set to detect acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, 2-butanone, 1- or 2-butanol, and isobutanol. Water was not detected using GC, but calculated using an oxygen (O) species balance of the compounds detected that contain O: (2) O water = O in − O microGC − O FIDGC Conversion was defined as the amount of isobutanol in the effluent gas compared to the initial amount entering the reactor. Thus, if no peak appeared at the retention time of isobutanol for a GC sample that was taken, the conversion was considered 100%. Species selectivity can be used as a metric of how complete the combustion process is, meaning how much CO2 and H2O are formed compared to the stoichiometric amounts. Carbon selectivity was defined as the number of carbon atoms in a particular carbon-containing species, divided by the total number of carbon atoms in the product gas as shown: (3) C atom selectivity = # C in species X ∑ C in product Thus, if the carbon selectivity of CO2 is 100%, complete combustion has occurred. Similarly, hydrogen selectivity was defined as (4) H atom selectivity = # H in species X ∑ H in product Additional experiments on catalytic partial oxidation of isobutene on Rh/Al2O3 with 25, 56 and 128 ms contact time were performed in the same reactor setup to investigate the role of isobutene in the reaction pathway of catalytic partial oxidation of isobutanol. The conversion was defined by the change in isobutene entering and exiting the reactor. Since isobutene is the reactant in these experiments, it is not counted in product selectivity analysis."
2,Results,"Catalytic partial oxidation of isobutanol was studied using the catalyst that did not contain Rh. The reactor was operated at three contact times—25, 56, and 128 ms—at ignition backface temperatures of 475, 400, and 300 °C, respectively. The results using the alumina catalyst are shown in Fig. 3 . For all three contact times, the vast majority of products were olefins and water. Hydrogen is formed, but at small amounts. The largest selectivity value using the alumina catalyst was at a contact time of 128 ms and a ϕ = 6.338, with a value of 1.59%. The H selectivity using the Rh catalyst at each contact time is given in Fig. 4 , with similar ignition backface temperatures as above. For all contact times, fuel lean conditions exhibit complete combustion when using a Rh catalyst. Fuel rich conditions cause syngas (H2 and CO) and residual hydrocarbons to appear in the exhaust gas. H2 selectivity has a maximum point in each contact time, whereas olefin production increases with increasing equivalence ratio. The major product within the olefin category was isobutene. Trace amounts of paraffins are found in all cases, usually in the form of methane and propane. For the 25 ms contact time, the maximum selectivity to H2 was at ϕ = 3.501 (C/O(air) = 1.166) with a value of 52.15%. At the other two times, 56 and 128 ms, the maximums were observed at ϕ = 1.425 (C/O(air) = 0.4749), with values of 62.92% and 24.65%, respectively. The production of hydrogen at all contact times and equivalence ratios tested using the Rh catalyst is provided in Fig. 5 . The maximum hydrogen flow rate was 16.79 sccm with isobutanol input of 1.012 mL h−1 at ϕ = 1.425 and 56 ms contact time. Fig. 6 displays the distribution of olefins for the alumina and Rh/alumina. As shown in Fig. 6a, nearly all of the products formed with the alumina catalyst at all three contact times studied were 1-butene, 2-butene, or isobutene. In contrast, at fuel lean conditions the Rh/alumina catalyst did not produce any olefins (Fig. 6b and c). But under fuel rich conditions the olefin production increases with equivalence ratio. At contact times of 25 and 56 ms, the products formed are primarily C4 olefins in similar quantities. However, Fig. 6b and c also illustrates that the 128 ms contact time produced far more propylene than the shorter contact times. Fig. 6d also shows that the longest contact time preferred to form nearly 7× more isobutene than linear butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butene), while 25 and 56 ms contact times only produced about 3× more isobutene than linear butenes. The temperature of the catalyst, more specifically, its backface in the flow field, was recorded for each test. Fig. 7 presents the final catalyst backface temperatures as a function of the equivalence ratio for the contact time of 25 ms. The alumina catalyst fluctuates little in temperature, whereas the Rh catalyst operates at higher temperatures in fuel lean conditions. The fuel rich temperatures for both catalysts generally do not show an increase from the baseline temperature, which is the temperature before the fuel is initiated (475 °C). The other two contact times show a similar trend (Fig. 8 ). The conversion of isobutanol is also shown in Fig. 7. With a Rh catalyst, no remaining isobutanol was detected at lower equivalence ratios. Increasing amounts of isobutanol were observed at higher ϕ values. The alumina catalyst does not show a particular trend; however, isobutanol was detected at all equivalence ratios tested. With both catalysts, the conversion of isobutanol appears to be high (above 99%). The conversion and the product selectivity of catalytic partial oxidation of isobutene using Rh/alumina catalysts at contact times of 25, 56, and 125 ms are shown in Figs. 9–11 . As shown in Fig. 9, the conversion of isobutene by catalytic combustion decreased with increasing ϕ at all three contact times. When ϕ ≥ 1, the oxygen availability was limited and the oxygen conversions were 100%. As a result, the isobutene was in excess and its conversion was as low as 9.8% at ϕ = 6.338 and 128 ms contact time. In the presence of excess oxygen (ϕ < 1), the isobutene conversion was between 95 and 100%. The products mainly contain CO2 and H2O. No H2 or CO was detected. The significant drop in conversion while using the Rh/alumina catalyst only begins once ϕ increased above 1.015. And ϕ above 1.425 resulted in a steady decrease in conversion which was at a minimum when ϕ = 6.338. At this ϕ isobutene conversion was 13.44, 12.55, and 9.77% for 25, 56, and 128 ms contact time, respectively. Conversely, the oxygen conversion increased with growing ϕ to 100% at ϕ = 1.015 for each contact time. Also shown in Fig. 9 is that the final catalyst backface temperature decreased with increasing ϕ for each contact time. Fig. 10 shows the carbon selectivity for the Rh/alumina catalyst at all three contact times. Each contact time shows similar trends that include 100% CO2 selectivity for ϕ < 1, as well as peak CO production at ϕ = 1.425. This is followed by a decreasing trend in CO selectivity and increasing CO2 selectivity. These data also show in Fig. 10 for 56 and 125 ms contact times that small amounts of paraffins are also formed at ϕ = 1.425 which always appeared as methane. The corresponding methane selectivity was 1.7% and 3.2%. Fig. 11 illustrates the hydrogen selectivity at all three contact times. The data indicate that H2O and H2 production follow the same trends as CO2 and CO production in Fig. 10. Also in Fig. 11 it was observed that the maximum H2 selectivity was 9.49, 17.64, and 15.25% for 25, 56 and 125 ms contact times."
3,Discussion,
4,Formation of olefins,"4.1 Formation of olefins Figs. 3–6 offer excellent insight into the reaction pathway taken in isobutanol catalytic combustion. Although other pathways may be present, the following proposed pathway is consistent with the experimental results. The first step is known as dehydration of the isobutanol, forming olefins and water: (5) i s o - C 4 H 9 OH → C 4 H 8 + H 2 O It was determined that the majority of olefinic products were C4 olefins with the alumina catalyst at all ϕ (Fig. 6a). This confirmed that dehydration (Eq. (5)) occurred, which is consistent with the study of 2-butanol decomposition [14] because the operating temperatures above 250 °C would favor formation of butenes through dehydration pathway. According to Macho et al., dehydration of C4 alcohol would produce a corresponding carbocation intermediate, followed by isomerization of this carbocation producing olefins [15]. Fig. 6b–d illustrated that the vast major of olefins were butene isomers for shorter contact times (25 ms and 56 ms). The amount of isobutene is about 3 times more than that of linear butenes combined (1-butene, 2-cis-butene and 2-trans-butene) at 25 and 56 ms contact times. At 128 ms, 60% olefins were C4 olefins while the remaining 40% olefins were propylene (Fig. 6d). No ethylene was detected by the micro-GC. This increased amount in propylene suggested that the characteristic time for the cracking reaction was longer than that of the dehydration reaction. At the same time, the C1 cracking fragment was further oxidized to form CO2 as indicated by the increase in CO2 selectivity. Because 1 mol of water is produced in the dehydration reaction (Eq. (5)), the theoretical maximum for H2 selectivity is 80%. Although it is possible to consider that the water liberated from the initial dehydration in Eq. (5) could yield additional hydrogen with the steam reforming and water–gas shift activity of Rh, the steam reforming and water–gas shift reaction on Rh usually require excess water for complete conversion. For example, Wheeler et al. studied the water–gas shift reaction with Rh/alumina foam and other catalysts at short contact times between 8 ms and 50 ms with CO/H2/H2O ratio of 1/2/4 [22]. (6) CO + H 2 O ⇄ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = − 41.2 kJ / mol Since the water–gas shift reaction is mildly exothermic and reversible, it requires low temperatures for high conversions and excess water to drive the chemical equilibrium to the products. Since Wheeler et al. used the same catalysts and experimental setup as this paper, Wheeler’s results would provide relevant insight into the significance of water–gas shift in the partial oxidation of butanol. Wheeler et al. reported that the CO conversion with Rh/alumina foam at 600 °C in excess water was about 34%. However, the water availability in the current study is too small to drive the water–gas shift and the steam reforming activities of Rh to completion. Therefore, there could be some extra but not significant amount of hydrogen from these Rh activities under our experimental conditions."
5,Oxidation of olefins,"4.2 Oxidation of olefins 4.2.1 Isobutene experiments with Rh/alumina catalyst Catalytic partial oxidation of isobutene using Rh/alumina catalyst was a necessary experiment in confirming whether olefins truly are formed as an intermediate in the conversion of isobutanol. From the isobutanol experiments with Rh/alumina, isobutene was detected only at high ϕ. In order for isobutene to be an intermediate, we need to first demonstrate that isobutene is reactive enough at low ϕ to be fully oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Second, isobutene partially oxidizes to CO and H2 at intermediate ϕ. Third, isobutene is stable enough at high ϕ to remain intact without bond breakage or isomerization. From this study, isobutene was found to be completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O at high O2 concentration (ϕ < 1) as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. As the O2 concentration decreases (ϕ = 1.425), CO and H2 were found. These observations are consistent with Eqs. (7)–(9). Partial oxidation of olefins: (7) C 4 H 8 + 2 O 2 → 4 CO + 4 H 2 Oxidation of H2: (8) H 2 + 0.5 O 2 → H 2 O Oxidation of CO: (9) CO + 0.5 O 2 → CO 2 As low O2 concentration decreases further (ϕ > 1.425), the H2O selectivity goes back up to 98% at ϕ = 6.338 and 25 ms. This suggests that CO oxidation to CO2 occurs more readily than partial oxidation of isobutene to CO, probably due to difference in activation energy. But it should be noted that the isobutene conversion continues to go down as ϕ increases. For instance the isobutene conversion was 13.4% with ϕ = 6.338 and contact time of 25 ms. As a result, the corresponding H2O yield (conversion multiplied by selectivity) was about 13.1% in spite of 98% H2O selectivity. The product selectivity also indicated that there were no C1–C3 hydrocarbon cracking products and no isomerization of isobutene to other linear butenes. Therefore, we can conclude that most isobutene molecules were stable enough to remain unreacted at high ϕ even in the presence of Rh. 4.2.2 Isobutanol experiments with alumina catalyst Consider the selectivities of catalytic partial oxidation of isobutanol using the alumina catalyst (Fig. 3) in the fuel lean region (ϕ < 1). The selectivity of water is higher than olefins, implying that much of the fuel is completing the path to complete combustion (Eqs. (7)–(9)). Some olefins remain, however, meaning that not all the olefins are partially oxidized in the absence of Rh. As the equivalence ratio increases to the mid range region (ϕ = 1.425), the longer contact time is required to achieve complete combustion. The shorter two contact times (25 ms, 56 ms) limit the reactions in Eqs. (7)–(9). In the higher ϕ range, even the longest contact time (128 ms) is not long enough for complete oxidation of H2, such that only half the H atoms are converted to water, while the other half are in the form of olefins from the dehydration of isobutanol (Eq. (5)). The trend of decreasing water selectivity with equivalence ratio is in part due to the decrease in oxygen availability relative to the fuel, making the oxidation reactions harder to achieve; oxygen was found, however, in the product gas in all cases using the alumina catalyst. H2 and CO were found in trace amounts (<1%) at all operating conditions. This strengthens the argument that catalytic combustion of isobutanol on the γ-alumina surface proceeds through the proposed pathway. Another pathway could be dehydrogenation of isobutanol: (10) i s o - C 4 H 9 OH → C 4 H 8 O + H 2 However, because little if any hydrogen was observed using the alumina catalyst, dehydrogenation does not appear to take place. The alumina results also indicate that the reactions of Eqs. (5), (8), and (9) occur quickly relative to the reaction in Eq. (7); when olefins are partially oxidized, the syngas is quickly converted to water and CO2. 4.2.3 Isobutanol experiments with Rh/alumina catalyst From Fig. 4, fuel lean conditions show only water and CO2 as products when Rh is added to the catalyst foam. At lean conditions, decomposition of isobutanol and oxidation of the intermediate species (Eqs. (5), (7–9)) occur on both the alumina and Rh surfaces, converting the fuel into its complete combustion products. It can be assumed that isobutanol dehydration also occurs on the Rh surface. Fig. 7 shows that Rh gives a slightly higher conversion of isobutanol (meaning more is dehydrated in addition to the amount converted by alumina). Another experiment was performed to determine the contribution of homogeneous reaction of isobutanol under similar conditions. It was found that the gas-phase contribution was small with a conversion of only 10%. Since the difference in conversion values between the catalysts with and without Rh is very small, most of the dehydration of isobutanol can be attributed to the alumina. This coincides with the recent literature study on 2-butanol decomposition [14], in which the authors concluded that the active sites were on the zirconia support of the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst for dehydration. When we compare the effect of Rh on the isobutanol reaction, the presence of Rh expedites the oxidation process so that complete combustion does occur for fuel lean conditions at all three contact times. Moving to a higher equivalence ratio of ϕ = 1.425, H2 is produced in the presence of Rh for all contact times. The decrease in oxygen when increasing the ratio means that the syngas oxidation reactions (Eqs. (8) and (9)) have less oxygen to use and cannot fully convert the CO and H2 into CO2 and water, respectively. These syngas oxidation reactions suffer because partial oxidation of the olefins on both Rh and alumina surfaces consumes most if not all the oxygen. The differences in magnitude of the H2 selectivities in the presence of Rh for the three contact times explain the distribution of oxygen as well. Once isobutene is produced by dehydration of isobutanol (Eq. (5)), oxygen is consumed either for partial oxidation of isobutene (Eq. (7)) or for oxidation of syngas (Eqs. (8) and (9)). First it should be noted that unlike the alumina catalyst, no oxygen was observed in the effluent gas for fuel rich conditions. From the alumina catalyst, it is found that complete combustion oxidation on the alumina surface is more favorable with a longer contact time (e.g. 128 ms). As shown in Fig. 8 the catalyst backface temperatures for each ϕ decreased with increasing contact time. Since one would expect that the rate of oxidation decreased with temperature, it was not likely that the increase in oxidation at longer contact time was due to temperature effect. From the results with alumina catalyst, it was also found that oxidation of H2 (or CO) will happen if the olefins are partially oxidized, regardless of the equivalence ratio, leaving only a small amount of H2. Since the H2 value in Fig. 4b is higher than that of Fig. 4a, it is reasonable to assume that partial oxidation of olefins on the Rh surface also occurs more frequently with longer contact times. Because more oxygen is being used in the partial oxidation of olefins, less oxygen is available for the oxidation of syngas on the Rh surface. Thus, at a contact time of 56 ms, less of the H2 produced from partial oxidation on the Rh surface is further converted than with the shorter contact time. This would also be the case with the longer time (128 ms), except that now the alumina surface in the Rh/alumina catalyst became more active in converting the olefins to water and CO2. Fig. 4a shows a different trend in H2 selectivity than Fig. 4b and c. With 25 ms contact time, the maximum is attained at an equivalence ratio of 3.501. With the decrease in oxygen to the new ratio, partial oxidation of the olefins on the Rh surface is still occurring, perhaps at the same rate, while reactions on the alumina surface and syngas oxidation on the Rh surface are less frequent. At the other contact times (56 and 128 ms), the H2 selectivity has decreased, meaning that the Rh surface reaction of Eq. (7) has been reduced with the others. This scenario implies that the Rh at smaller contact times is more effective than alumina at activating O2 for surface reactions with olefins, but also that this characteristic diminishes with increasing contact time. The rest of the data past this equivalence ratio provides the following insight. As the equivalence ratio increases, less oxygen is available, lowering the rates of oxidation on both alumina and Rh surfaces. This means only dehydration will occur at even larger ϕ values. Only alumina surface reactions increase in occurrence at high ϕ values when the contact time is increased."
6,Hydrogen production,"4.3 Hydrogen production From Fig. 4, it is clear that for maximum yield a contact time of 56 ms with an equivalence ratio around 1.42 is desirable. At the fuel flow rate used for experimentation, 1.012 mL h−1 (about 8.11 W thermal), the reactor provided the equivalent of 3.61 W thermal of H2. This translates to a reformer efficiency of approximately 44.5%. Since 2 mol of electrons are generated from each mole of H2, a current of 14.36 A can be produced with 100 sccm of hydrogen gas. The power output will depend on the fuel cell voltage. Normally, the fuel cell runs at 0.7 V, and in that case, the fuel cell power will be 14.3 × 0.7 = 10.05 W. The maximum hydrogen flow rate was 16.79 sccm, which corresponds to 1.687 W electrical. Therefore, overall fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 20.8% (=1.687/8.11) could be achieved by combining an isobutanol reformer with a fuel cell. This study implies that there is an optimal contact time for hydrogen production with this catalyst, not just an optimal equivalence ratio. This paper investigated the effects of the contact time and equivalence ratio associated with hydrogen production. Further improvement on hydrogen selectivity focusing on olefin production step will be the topic of future research."
7,Temperature profile,"4.4 Temperature profile The temperature profiles portrayed in Fig. 8 concur with the reaction products of the reactor. Adiabatic temperatures and the percentage heat loss in the complete combustion regime (ϕ = 0.1757, 0.3501, 0.7187) were estimated. Energy balance was performed using conversion, product gas composition as well as the measured initial and final backface temperatures. Since complete combustion releases more heat than incomplete combustion, energy analysis with complete combustion would provide the upper bound of energy loss. In contrast, the exhaust gas composition in the incomplete combustion regime was very complex and specific heat capacity of each compound was not easily available. It was found that the measured backface temperature was 50 °C below the adiabatic temperature. The energy balance also showed that the heat loss was estimated to be about 6.4%; therefore, an adiabatic condition is assumed. Because the reactor is adiabatic, all energy entering the system with the reactants also leaves the system with the products. In this scenario, the enthalpy released when combusting the fuel is distributed through the products, which is observed in the form of a temperature increase. A combustion process that sees more than the complete products, CO2 and H2O, is using energy to form and sustain those byproducts. Thus, less of a temperature increase will be observed. This is the case with the alumina catalyst at all equivalence ratios tested, and the Rh catalyst at fuel rich conditions. Similar temperature profiles at other contact times (25, 56 and 128 ms) are shown in Fig. 8."
8,Conclusions,"The energy-dense, renewable alcohol isobutanol can be reformed using catalytic combustion to produce hydrogen for use in small power applications such as PEM fuel cells. Hydrogen production requires Rh when using a monolith foam coated with γ-alumina. This is because the Rh accelerates the process that decomposes olefins into H2 and CO. The highest H2 selectivity observed was 62.92% (with an 80% theoretical maximum) at an equivalence ratio of 1.425 and a contact time of 56 ms. This operating condition provided 3.61 W thermal of H2, achieving an approximate reformer efficiency of 44.5% and fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 20.8%."
