0,Introduction,"In the present occurrence, controlling of emissions produced from the petroleum-based engines is a challenging work for automotive industries. The major pollutants produced from internal combustion engines are carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, hydrocarbon and smoke emission. In order to control these pollutants from the engine, various researchers adopted several methodologies in past decades. Several researchers utilized various alternative fuels for internal combustion engines to reduce such harmful pollutants. Investigates are being attempted using several alternative fuels such as alcohols [[1]], vegetable oils [2] biodiesel [3], hydrogen [4], LPG [5] and CNG [6] in an engine. Also, bio fuels derived from biomasses and litters such as plastic, civic solid waste, waste gases, used cooking oils, etc., are turning out to be effectively utilized in a way to protect the national energy security in a eco-friendly manner by appending conventional sources of energy towards reducing dependency on imported-depleting fossil fuels to encounter energy needs of the country’s urban and vast rural population [7]. Among all the stated alternative fuels, researchers found vegetable oil and hydrogen seems as an ambitious resolution to the fast depletion of conventional petroleum fuels, which turns as a sustainable energy source with non-biodegradable property [8]. The WCO obtained from the utilized palm oil or sunflower oil can be additionally utilized as an elective fuel for a diesel engine, which reduces fossil fuel consumption, cost and energy demand around the world [9]. The direct usage of pure waste vegetable oil in an internal combustion engine without any modification leads to inferior performance because of its very high viscosity when compared to petroleum fuels. Hence, transesterification process was carried out to diminish high viscosity of the vegetable oil and utilized in the engine as biodiesel. However, the utilization of biodiesel only reduces CO and HC emission, but there will be a huge increment of smoke intensity [10]. To reduce this very high smoke intensity, hydrogen fuel is recommended to be used directly in the engine by inducting it into the intake manifold. Since hydrogen has superior combustive properties which helps in the combustion process and emits very fewer pollutants from the exhaust emissions. Hydrogen is a renewable, non-toxic and biodegradable alternative fuel, which on combustion in the engine will result in only water as a product. It has a very high calorific value, which resulted in more energy release during combustion that might improve the performance of the engine [11]. Several research works were conducted by various researchers using WCOB and hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the engine and reported their observations from the obtained results. Yaliwal et al. [12] investigated utilization of WCOB in a compression ignition engine on its performance and emission characteristics. It was found that BTE of an engine reduced for WCOB compared to conventional diesel fuel. They also perceived a drastic decrease in HC and CO emission with WCOB. NOx emission was found to be increased for WCOB at all the load conditions. Rekhate Chhaya and Abhinesh Kumar Prajapati [13] carried out an experimental work in a mono-cylinder compression ignition engine by means of different WCOB blended fuels. They observed about 4% reduction in BTE for WCOB blends when contrasted to mineral diesel oil. However, the tail pipe emissions of HC, CO and (greenhouse gas) CO2 was found reduced for biodiesel blends. Kumar D et al. [14] have conducted experiments on a 35.8 kW power output tractor engine using five different WCOB blends. Among the blends, their results indicated B10 and B20 as the best blend based on the lowest emission result. Qasim Muhammad et al. [15] experimented with waste tyre oil and waste soybean oil as an unconventional fuel in a single cylinder, compression ignition engine. They prepared test fuels by blending tyre oil and waste soybean oil at various proportions. They found that such type of blends could be used in the engine without affecting the performance of the engine. From their experimental study, they noted that HC, CO and smoke emission were decreased with the blends. They also observed a noticeable reduction in BTE of the engine using waste oil blends compared to diesel fuel. Karthic S. V et al. [16] carried out an experiment on diesel engine under dual fuel mode using diesel and hydrogen as a primary fuel at different hydrogen energy shares. They noted significant improvement in BTE for increasing hydrogen energy share. The investigation showed a substantial reduction in harmful emissions such as CO, HC and smoke at full load condition. Gonca Guven et al. [17] analyzed the influences of different gaseous fuels such as methane, hydrogen and propane in a spark ignition engine theoretically. The theoretical model was developed and compared with the results of the experimental work carried out. From the analysis results, it indicates that obtained theoretical modeling results are close to the experimental work in terms of engine performance factors such as power output, indicated mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency. Sidhu and Manpreet Singh experimentally investigated hydrogen-enriched waste oil biodiesel-diesel blends performance in a diesel engine and perceived that hydrogen addition to biodiesel blends has shown a substantial effect on emission and performance characteristics of the engine. They also noted hydrogen addition into the combustion process improved the BSFC and BTE of the engine at all the power outputs [18]. Hydrogen addition under dual fuel mode in a diesel engine reveals a substantial effect on its performance behavior. Hydrogen enriched air at the intake was tested in the diesel engine operated with biodiesel as fuel. Hydrogen addition reveals significant improvement in performance and a drastic reduction in CO emission [19]. Direct induction of hydrogen into the intake manifolds results in improved performance characteristics in terms of BTE, BSFC and IMEP etc. Use of hydrogen under dual fuel mode shows a drastic effect on smoke and NOx emission. Alcohol substitution with hydrogen shows similar results that were obtained by other authors. Hydrogen induction with alcohol injection in the intake manifold improves the performance of the engine and reduces NOx emission, additionally a substantial decrease in CO and HC emissions are noticeable [20,21]. Increasing hydrogen concentration in the intake air increases NOx emission and decreases the smoke density in the diesel engine. In addition, there was a significant reduction in CO and HC with hydrogen dual-fuel operating engine [22,[23]]. Increasing hydrogen energy share in the diesel engine increases BTE under all the load conditions, however significant reduction in BTE was perceived with excessive rise in hydrogen energy share in dual fuel mode [12]. From the outcomes of literatures, we came to know that, very limited research has been conceded on using hydrogen as a secondary fuel in a compression ignition engine - dual fuel mode; setting up an aim of reducing exhaust emissions. Hence, the present study intends to decrease the exhaust emissions from the diesel engine operated with WCOB and hydrogen in a dual fuel mode."
1,Material and methods,
2,Production of WCOB,"2.1 Production of WCOB 2.1.1 STEP 1. Collection/initial filtration of the WCO • Five liters of waste cooking oil (sunflower oil) was collected from hostel mess at Madras Institute Technology campus, Anna University, Chennai. The collected oil was initially filtered and pre-treated for removal of suspended as well as unwanted/foreign particles. 2.1.2 STEP 2. Preparation of the WCO for biodiesel production • Among many biodiesel production techniques, transesterification process looks modest and finest method. Therefore in this research transesterification was chosen as the biodiesel production technique. This process involves chemical reaction between tri-glyceride in WCO and alcohol, the reaction is as follows; WCO + Alcohol = WCOB + Glycerin • Ethanol and methanol are the popular short-chain alcohols, in which methanol was chosen for the transesterification reaction, since it is less miscible in oil, cheaper, as well as it facilitates the separation of acquired biodiesel. In addition to this, methanol produces less viscid biodiesel than the one produced by higher-chain alcohols. • The most commonly used catalyst potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used in this work due to its availability and low cost. In addition, it tends the reaction to be as simple as possible and facilitates glycerol separation. • About 2% potassium hydroxide (KOH) was dissolved with methyl alcohol (CH3OH) to form potassium methoxide solution. Then the pre-treated WCO was taken in a beaker (500 ml) and blended with prepared methoxide. Then using magnetic stirrer the solution was stirred at 500 rpm up to 60 min by retaining 60°Celsius. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled naturally and was taken to separation funnel and reserved in it for whole night to settle down by gravity method. 2.1.3 STEP 3. Removal of the water and glycerol from the WCO • For extraction of WCO biodiesel, the mixture was placed in the separation funnel to eliminate water from the WCO biodiesel. • After 24 h of retaining the mixture in the funnel, two layers were formed of which the top layer comprises methyl ester of WCO and waste glycerol at the bottom. 2.1.4 STEP 4. Post-treatment/acquiring the biodiesel • The product obtained was then transferred to separate the glycerol and methyl ester from the separation funnel. The process is rapid since glycerol has low solubility in esters; with the complete separation being habitually accomplished in 30 min. Then, the WCO methyl ester was sprayed with water for purification. The purified methyl ester was then heated at 80°Celsius for eliminating humid contents. • After the removal of humid contents, the methyl ester (biodiesel) is obtained. Finally, the prepared WCO methyl ester was blended with ND fuel over volume fraction of 50%. The selective properties of prepared blend were estimated using appropriate measuring instruments using ASTM standards. Table 1 shows the properties of the neat diesel fuel, WCOB50 fuel and hydrogen gas (see Fig. 1)."
3,Experimental work and techniques,
4,Test engine setup and instrumentation,"3.1 Test engine setup and instrumentation The complete experimental setup employed for testing hydrogen fuel and WCOB under dual fuel mode is shown in Fig. 2 . This setup mainly comprises of four-stroke single cylinder, direct injection, constant speed, water-cooled diesel engine with eddy current dynamometer (Benz System, Dynalec model) for measurement of brake power at various loading conditions. The technical specification of the test engine used for conducting the experiment is shown in Table 2 . From the fuel tank, fuel was delivered to the engine and the fuel consumption rate was observed in the burette by observing the time taken for 10 cc volume of fuel consumed at every load conditions. U-Tube manometer and orifice flow meter were utilized for assessing the mass flow rate of air. A k-type thermocouple mounted on the exhaust manifold was used for measuring exhaust gas temperature. The exhaust emission parameters such as NOx, HC and CO were measured using AVL 444 Di-gas analyzer. The smoke intensity from the exhaust was measured in opacity using AVL 437C smoke meter. Table 3 shows the technical specifications of exhaust gas analyzer and smoke meter."
5,Hydrogen fuel supply system,3.2 Hydrogen fuel supply system A separate hydrogen cylinder having pure hydrogen gas (99.9%) stored at 160 bar pressure was designated for hydrogen enrichment. A gas regulator was connected in the cylinder for reducing pressure to 1 bar for operating range. The engine intake manifold was modified by incorporating induction nozzle in the manifold for inducting hydrogen gas. The flow rate of hydrogen gas from the cylinder to engine intake is measured and controlled by a digital hydrogen flow meter (Bronkhorst make) with a control valve. The maximum flow rate of the flow meter is 14 lpm. A flame arrestor is connected in between the hydrogen cylinder and engine intake in the flow line for avoiding backfire.
6,Test procedure,"Initially, the engine was started with ND fuel and operated for 30 min to attain steady state condition. Then by varying the load condition experiments were conducted with ND fuel and the readings were noted. Subsequently, the experiment was carried out by replacing ND fuel with WCOB at various load conditions. Finally, hydrogen gas was introduced into the intake manifold along with intake air when the engine was operated with WCOB (WCOB50). The hydrogen flow rate into the intake manifold was varied as 2 lpm, 4 lpm and 6 lpm using pressure regulator and control valve at all load conditions. For all the load conditions, experiments were conducted and readings were noted down to explore the performance and emission parameters."
7,Uncertainty analysis,"4.1 Uncertainty analysis The uncertainty and errors in the experimentation might arise from observation, calibration, environment conditions and instrument selection. The accuracy of the experimental values can be justified and proved by this uncertainty analysis. The uncertainties of the calculated and measured parameters in the experiments were estimated by using the Holman method. The percentage uncertainties of various parameters such as brake power, brake thermal efficiency, fuel consumption, speed, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, oxides nitrogen, smoke opacity and exhaust gas temperatures were estimated and shown in Table 4 . Total percentage uncertainty of this experiment is calculated as seen below, ( B P ) 2 + ( N ) 2 + ( T F C ) 2 + ( B T E ) 2 + ( C O ) 2 + ( H C ) 2 + ( N O x ) 2 + ( S m o k e ) 2 + ( E G T ) 2 = ( 1 ) 2 + ( 1.5 ) 2 + ( 1.5 ) 2 + ( 0.8 ) 2 + ( 0.7 ) 2 + ( 0.8 ) 2 + ( 1.2 ) 2 + ( 1.5 ) 2 + ( 1.5 ) 2 = ± 3.6 %"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Performance parameters,"5.1 Performance parameters 5.1.1 Brake thermal efficiency The variations of BTE with the BP for ND, WCOB50 blend and different ratios of hydrogen addition at all load conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . BTE increased with respect to engine brake power for all test conditions. It is noticed that the BTE of ND at maximum brake power is 31.3%, whereas for WCOB50 blend it is 26.7%. Reduction of BTE is due to poor volatility and inferior combustion characteristics of WCOB50 fuel [12]. With hydrogen enrichment, BTE increases at each and every load conditions. BTE was noted as 27.9%, 28.9% and 30.2% for WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H at peak power output. The addition of hydrogen into the intake air and high flame velocity of hydrogen enhances the combustion rate during combustion of WCOB fuel which results from improvement in BTE [24]. 5.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption The variations of BSFC with the BP for ND, WCOB50 blend and different shares of hydrogen addition at all the load conditions are displayed in Fig. 4 . BSFC of diesel, WCOB50 and hydrogen enrichment were gradually reduced by increasing engine load. It was identified that BSFC of ND is lower compared to all other test fuel conditions at peak power output. BSFC of ND and WCOB50 is 0.31 kg/kW.hr and 0.39 kg/kW.hr at maximum BP. The increase in BSFC for WCOB50 compared to ND can be explained by the lower calorific value of WCOB50 fuel which resulted in consumption of more amount of fuel to produce same power output as produced by diesel fuel [25]. However, with hydrogen enrichment, the BSFC is decreased and it was found to be 0.36 kg/kW.hr, 0.34 kg/kW.hr and 0.32 kg/kW.hr for WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H at peak load conditions. Hydrogen addition decreases BSFC of the engine due to the superior combustion of air-fuel mixture along with the hydrogen. The high flame speed of hydrogen improves the combustion rate and reduces BSFC at all load conditions [16,23]. 5.1.3 Exhaust gas temperature Fig. 5 indicates the dissimilarity of EGT with respect to BP for ND, WCOB blend and various proportions of hydrogen addition at all the load conditions. EGT rises with aggregate engine BP for all test fuels. Compared to ND fuel EGT was increased for WCOB fuel at all loads. With hydrogen enrichment along with WCOB fuel, EGT shows further increment at all load conditions. EGT was found to be 330 °C, 346 °C, 360 °C, 381 °C and 415 °C for ND, WCOB50, WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H at maximum brake power. The rise in EGT for WCOB fuel is due to high viscosity of WCOB fuel which declines the combustion process that which increases the quantity of fuel burnt during controlled combustion as well as after burning phase [15]. The further increase in EGT with hydrogen enrichment can be endorsed to rapid combustion that takes place in the combustion chamber owing to the combustion of hydrogen fuel which may increase the heat release rate [8]."
10,Emission parameters,"5.2 Emission parameters 5.2.1 Smoke opacity Variation of smoke opacity with BP for ND, WCOB blend and various proportions of hydrogen addition at all the load conditions are illustrated in Fig. 6 . Smoke opacity of the WCOB fuel was found to be slightly decreased compared to ND fuel and hydrogen enrichment further reduces the smoke opacity level at all loads. Smoke opacity value for ND, WCOB50, WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H is observed to be 42%, 36%, 34.5%, 29.4% and 24.5% at maximum load condition. The injected WCOB fuel has high oxygen content that enhances the combustion rate and oxidizes the air-fuel mixture which reduces the formation of smoke [26]. Hydrogen addition along with intake air significantly reduces the smoke opacity level, this can be explicated as the addition of hydrogen enhances the combustion by secondary oxidation and burns the unburned soot particles presents inside the cylinder [12,20]. 5.2.2 Oxides of nitrogen emission The variation of NOx emission with engine brake power for ND, WCOB blend and various proportions of hydrogen enrichment at all load conditions are illustrated in Fig. 7 . It was observed that NOx emission surges with increasing BP. The NOx emission from WB50 fuel and hydrogen enrichment is found to be higher than ND fuel at all loads. The average NOx values for ND, WCOB50, WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H were 584 ppm, 678 ppm, 761 ppm, 820 ppm and 939 ppm at maximum brake power. The availability of more oxygen molecules in WCOB fuel resulted in complete combustion and increases the in-cylinder temperature which is the foremost reason for increase in NOx emission [12]. The further increase in NOx emission with hydrogen enrichment in the intake air can be ascribed to high calorific value of hydrogen fuel which releases more heat energy during combustion that which also increases the peak cycle temperature [12,22]. 5.2.3 Carbon monoxide emission Fig. 8 exhibits the variation of CO emission with engine BP for ND, WCOB blend and various proportions of hydrogen enrichment at all load conditions. CO emissions gradually decreases by increasing BP, meanwhile the increase of CO is evident at maximum BP for all operating conditions. It is noticed that CO emission was slightly reduced for WCOB fuel compared to ND at maximum BP. The main reason for reduction in CO emission is due to superior combustion of WCOB fuel which has more oxygen content and lower carbon molecules compared to ND fuel [26]. Then the introduction of hydrogen in the intake further reduces CO emission at all the BP. The CO emission for ND fuel, WCOB50, WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H were 0.215%, 0.171%, 0.141%, 0.124% and 0.101% at maximum BP. The excess hydrogen molecules in the intake air reacted to the oxygen content in the air-fuel mixture to form OH molecules; this reaction leads to improvement in combustion and reduces the formation of CO emission in the exhaust [24]. 5.2.4 Hydrocarbon emission The variation of HC emissions with BP for ND fuel, WCOB blend and different proportions of hydrogen addition in intake is shown in Fig. 9 . Compared to ND fuel, WCOB fuel conveyed lower HC emissions since there was more oxygen content available; similarly higher cetane number of WCOB tends to decreases ignition delay period that which enhanced the combustion rate. The average HC emissions were noted as 55 ppm, 45 ppm, 38 ppm, 30.3 ppm and 25.4 ppm for ND fuel, WCOB50, WCOB50+2H, WCOB50+4H and WCOB50+6H at maximum BP. A substantial reduction in HC emissions were found with hydrogen enrichment at all the BP. The rapid burning rate of hydrogen fuel aided complete combustion of the injected WCOB fuel and decreased HC emissions [21,22]."
11,Decision,"In this work, the effect of WCOB and pure hydrogen on exhaust emissions and performance parameters were evaluated experimentally. In view of the test outcomes, below are the subsequent conclusions drawn. 1. Dual fuel mode of operation indicates substantial enhancement in performance and emission characteristics of the test engine. 2. WCOB50 fuel demonstrated a decrease in BTE contrasted with diesel fuel at all the load conditions. 3. Hydrogen enrichment improved the BTE of the engine operated with WCOB50 fuel; however ND fuel shows maximum BTE at peak power output. 4. Exhaust emissions such as smoke opacity, HC and CO were marginally decreased with WCOB50 fuel, while NOx emission increased at all the load conditions. 5. Substantial decrease in HC, CO and smoke opacity were observed with hydrogen addition. There is a drastic increment in NOx emission with the increasing hydrogen fuel along with intake air."
