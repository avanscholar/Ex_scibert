0,Introduction,"Biomass energy is a promising option of renewable energy but the feedstock used for producing biomass energy should come from non-food biomass or agricultural waste to avoid the competition with food source and arable land (Hui et al., 2010). Hence, lignocellulosic materials are utilized as feedstock for the production of liquid (i.e., ethanol, butanol) or gaseous (i.e., hydrogen or methane) fuels (Yu and Zhang, 2003; Lo et al., 2008a,b). Agricultural wastes such as wheat straw, bagasse, rice straw and Napiergrass were successfully converted to ethanol and hydrogen after hydrolysis (Lever et al., 2010; Lo et al., 2008b, 2009). The rate limiting step of cellulosic bioenergy production processes is hydrolysis and saccharification of cellulosic materials. Most biofuels producing microorganisms (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae) could only utilize simple cellulosic sugars (e.g., glucoses or cellubiose) for growth and biofuel production, whereas the rigid structure of cellulose fibers make them very difficult to be degraded or saccharified by the attack of cellulolytic enzymes (Chandra et al., 2007). Therefore, to accelerate enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis, pretreatment of cellulosic materials is usually employed by combined procedures of physical (e.g., milling, steam explosion) and chemical (alkali or acidic treatment) methods (Saha and Cotta, 2006; Zhang et al., 2007). For example, after pretreatment with alkaline peroxide and dilute sulfuric acid, the enzymatic saccharification efficiency of wheat straw and hardwood xylan was substantially enhanced to reach a 97% or 80–90% of theoretical value, respectively (Torget and Hsu, 1994; Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008). Cellulase is one kind of biocatalysts composed of endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase and β-1,4-d-glucosidase, which were used to convert cellulose fibers to soluble sugar for follow-up biofuels production by bacteria or yeast (Shanmughapriya et al., 2010). The endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase reacted on the amorphous part of cellulose, causing fragmentation of cellulosic materials. The exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose into simple sugars such as cellobiose and cellodextrin. Finally the cello-oligosaccharides were degraded to glucose by β-glucosidase (Li et al., 2009; Soni et al., 2010). Cellulases are often produced from fungal species, such as Trichoderma sp. and Aspergillus sp. Some bacteria are also effective in producing cellulolytic enzymes, such as Cellulomonas sp., Bacillus sp., and Clostridium thermocellum (Suto and Tomita, 2001). However, cellulolytic enzymes production by Pseudomonas sp. is still rarely documented in the literature (Subramaniyan and Prema, 2000; Xu et al., 2005; Her et al., 1999). In this work, we isolated a cellulolytic Pseudomonas sp. strain able to produce novel and effective cellulase and xylanase enzymes, which were used to hydrolyze agricultural waste to prepare carbon source for biohydrogen production. Hydrogen is a clean, sustainable, and efficient energy carrier, which is expected to play a crucial role in the development of future energy sources. Producing hydrogen from cellulosic materials via dark fermentation is an economic, environmental-friendly and sustainable way of producing hydrogen. Cellulosic bioH2 production has caught much attention recently, as more and more research work has been devoted to this field (Lo et al., 2008b, 2009). In this study, sugarcane bagasse was pretreated by NaOH and hydrolyzed by novel cellulases/xylanase produced form an indigenous isolate Pseudomonas sp. CL3. The bagasse hydrolysate was then fermented by Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 to produce biohydrogen using a separate hydrolysis and fermentation process."
1,Methods,
2,Strain isolation,"2.1 Strain isolation Pseudomonas sp. CL3 was isolated from forest soil in southern Taiwan. The soil sample was diluted in sterile dilution solution, and then spread on BHM agar plate incubated for 2days at 37°C. The BHM agar was used as selection medium consisting of (g/L): carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), 10.0; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; K2HPO4, 1.0; KH2PO4, 1.0; NH4NO3, 1.0; FeCl3·6H2O, 0.05; CaCl2, 0.02; agar, 15.0. The Congo red staining method was utilized to screen the cellulase-producing strain, selecting the plate with a clear hydrolysis zone after washing off Congo red dye by 8M NaCl (Wang et al., 2009a; Sakamoto and Toyohara, 2009). The selected colonies were incubated in liquid BHM medium (without agar) at 37°C and 200rpm for 2days, and then samples were taken from the culture to evaluate the cellulase/xylanase activities by the amount of reducing sugars produced. Finally, the most effective strain was chosen as the target strain to be used in the present work for cellulase production."
3,Identification of isolates,"2.2 Identification of isolates The isolated target strain was inoculated into LB medium and was cultivated at 37°C and 200rpm for 24h. An appropriate amount of cells were taken from the culture and the genomic DNA of the cells was extracted by DNA Purification Kit (Viogene, Taiwan) for the sequence analysis. Amplification of the 16S rDNA gene was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using F8 and R1510 primer (Wang et al., 2009b). The PCR products were sequenced (Mission Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) and the obtained sequence was compared with the database available in NCBI GenBank to determine the identity of the isolated strain. The phylogenetic tree was also constructed using the MegAlign software (Wang et al., 2009a; Liang et al., 2009)."
4,Enzyme activities assay,"2.3 Enzyme activities assay The activity of endoglucanase was analyzed according to the method reported by Nitisinprasert and Temmes (1991). The enzyme reaction solution contained 0.5ml sample solution and 0.5ml reactive reagent composed of 10g/L CMC in 100mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 40°C for 30min. The amount of reducing sugar was measured by using DNS method (Miller, 1959) using glucose (Sigma) as the standard for the quantification of reducing sugar. The unit of endoglucanase activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1μg of reducing sugar equivalent per min. The activity of exoglucanase was assayed according to the method described by Nitisinprasert and Temmes (1991). The enzyme reaction solution contained 0.5ml sample solution and 0.5ml reactive reagent composed of 10g/L Avicel in 100mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 50°C for 2h. The amount of reducing sugar was measured by DNS method at OD540 using glucose as standard. The unit of exoglucanase activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1μg of reducing sugar equivalent per min. The assay of β-glucosidase activity followed that reported by Nitisinprasert and Temmes (1991). The enzyme reaction solution contained 0.5ml sample solution and 0.5ml reactive reagent composed of 10g/L cellobiose in 100mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 40°C for 30min. Quantitative analysis of glucose was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a RI detector. The column used was ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 (Transgenomic, USA). The mobile phase used was 0.008N H2SO4 with a controlled flow rate of 0.4ml/min. The unit of β-glucosidase activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1μg of glucose equivalent released per min. The assay of xylanase activity was conducted according to the method reported by Nitisinprasert and Temmes (1991). The enzyme reaction contained 0.5ml sample solution and 0.5ml reactive reagent composed of 10g/L xylan in 100mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 50°C for 10min. The amount of reducing sugar was measured by DNS method at OD540 using xylose as the standard for quantitative analysis of reducing sugar. The unit of xylanase activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1μg of reducing sugar equivalent per min."
5,SDS–PAGE and zymography analysis,"2.4 SDS–PAGE and zymography analysis Pseudomonas sp. CL3 was grown on BHM medium at 37°C and 200rpm for 4days. An appropriate amount of the culture broth was taken and centrifuged (4°C, 9000g) for 20min. The supernatant (containing extracellular cellulolytic enzymes) was subjected to precipitation by salting out method with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. The precipitate containing crude enzymes was collected after centrifugation (4°C, 9000g) for 20min and was re-dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 7, 100mM). The crude enzyme solution was used for sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and zymography analysis. The SDS–PAGE analysis was conducted using a 12% polyacrylamide gel to determine the molecular weight of the existing enzymes. The zymography analysis for β-glucosidase (Joo et al., 2009) was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels amended with 0.001% 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-gluco-pyranoside (MUG) as substrate but in the absence of SDS. After reaction for 30min at 37°C, MUG was hydrolyzed to fluorescent methyl lumbelliferone, which was visualized under ultraviolet light. For the zymography of exoglucanase, the procedures were similar to those used for β-glucosidase zymography, except that MUC (4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-cellobioside) was used as substrate, which have the same reactive mechanism as MUG (Walter and Schrempf, 1996). For the zymography of endoglucanase, 0.5% CMC was used as substrate and the reaction was performed at 37°C for 30min and the clear zones were visualized by 0.1% Congo red solution (Sakamoto and Toyohara, 2009). The procedures for xylanase zymography analysis were similar to those used for endoglucanase zymography except that 0.5% xylan (instead of CMC) was used as the reaction substrate."
6,Pretreatment of cellulosic feedstock,"2.5 Pretreatment of cellulosic feedstock In this study, acid and alkaline pretreatments of bagasse were conducted to breakdown the rigid structure of cellulose for easier enzymatic attack. For alkaline pretreatment, 1g of bagasse was treated with 20ml of alkaline solution (containing 15g/L NaOH and 2g/L H2O2) at 120°C for 20min (Orts et al., 2008). For acidic pretreatment, 1g of bagasse was treated with 10ml of acid solution (containing 83–85.9% phosphoric acid) at 50°C for 30–60min (Zhang et al., 2007). The pretreated bagasse was rinsed with water three times and dried in a 50°C oven overnight before being used as feedstock for biohydrogen production."
7,Procedures for separate hydrolysis and fermentation for bioH2 production,"2.6 Procedures for separate hydrolysis and fermentation for bioH2 production In order to develop an alternative energy, the separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process was used to convert the agriculture waste (bagasse) into bioH2 with C. pasteurianum CH4 (Lo et al., 2008a,b). In the SHF process, 20g/L of alkaline-pretreated bagasse was hydrolyzed in 80ml solution containing 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and a mixture of cellulolytic enzymes (endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, 45U/ml; exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, 7U/ml; β-1,4-d-glucosidase, 100U/ml; xylanase, 35U/ml) at 45°C for 162h. After hydrolysis, the C. pasteurianum CH4 cells (3% inoculum) were inoculated into 100ml solution containing the bagasse hydrolysate and concentrated Endo-medium (5× Endo-medium) (Lo et al., 2008b). The dark H2 fermentation was conducted at 37°C."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Isolation and identification of the isolated strain,"3.1 Isolation and identification of the isolated strain Forest soil samples were obtained in southern Taiwan for the isolation of bacterial strains exhibiting high cellulolytic activities using CMC-amended BHM agar plates. Nearly 30 pure strains were isolated from the soil samples. Among them, the strain with the highest CMC hydrolysis activity (based on clear zone observation after Congo red staining) was chosen as the target strain (named strain CL3) for further evaluation of its potential in mass production of cellulases. The result of the 16S rDNA gene phylogenic tree indicates that strain CL3 was belonged to the genus Pseudomonas and highly similar to Pseudomonas mosselii (99.9% sequence similarity) (Fig. 1 ). Thus, the strain was identified as Pseudomonas sp. CL3, whose 16S rDNA sequence was registered at NCBI GenBank with an accession number of HQ875131. It is very interesting to discover that the Pseudomonas sp. CL3 strain produces effective cellulolytic enzymes. In fact, literature survey shows that so far very few reports mentioned the presence of cellulolytic activities from Pseudomonas species. Therefore, this isolate is very unique from this aspect. As will be pointed out below, the follow-up enzyme characterization also shows the uniqueness of the cellulase produced from this CL3 strain."
10,Characterization of cellulolytic enzymes originating from Pseudomonas sp. CL3,"3.2 Characterization of cellulolytic enzymes originating from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 Since the cellulolytic activity of Pseudomonas sp. CL3 was mainly in the extracellular compartment (data not shown), the extracellular enzymes harvested from the supernatant of culture broth were concentrated and analyzed with SDS–PAGE and zymography. As shown in zymography results (Fig. 2 ), there were two bands associated with endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase corresponding to a molecular weight (MW) of 80 and 100kDa, respectively. The zymogram shows only one band for each of exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, β-1,4-d-glucosidase and xylanase with a MW of 55, 65 and 20kDa, respectively. It is worth noting that one of the endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase has a MW of nearly 100kDa, which is higher than most of the reported MW for endoglucanase (ranging from 50 to 90kDa) (Demain et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009b). This indicated that this endoglucanase enzyme could be a novel enzyme and deserve further study to identify its protein structure to understand why it has a larger molecular weight."
11,Effect of pH and temperature on the activity of cellulolytic enzymes produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3,"3.3 Effect of pH and temperature on the activity of cellulolytic enzymes produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 Fig. 3 shows that the optimal temperature for the enzyme activity of endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, β-1,4-d-glucosidase and xylanase was 50, 45, 45 and 55°C, respectively. The enzymatic activity declined rapidly as the temperature was higher than the optimal temperature. At 60°C, the activity of endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase and xylanase maintained 50–80% of the optimal activity, whereas the β-1,4-d-glucosidase activity decreased to lower than 20% of its maximum value (Fig. 3), suggesting that the β-1,4-d-glucosidase enzyme was more sensitive to high temperature when compared to the other three cellulolytic enzymes. These results show that the cellulases/xylanase originating form Pseudomonas sp. CL3 work well under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, thereby being suitable and useful to be used for producing bioethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The effect of pH value on the activity of the cellulolytic enzymes produced from the CL3 strain is shown in Fig. 4 . The results indicate that all the four enzymes exhibited their optimal activity at pH 6.0. The enzymatic activity of endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase and xylanase decreased rapidly above pH 8.0 and below pH 5.0. The β-1,4-d-glucosidase maintained over 80% of its optimal activity over the pH range of 5.0–9.0. Among the four cellulolytic enzymes examined, the exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase had the best tolerance to pH, as its activity was similar over a broadest pH range of 4.0–9.0. Hence, the exoglucanase and β-1,4-d-glucosidase produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 had much better pH tolerance than endoglucanase and xylanase."
12,Hydrolysis of cellulosic feedstock-bagasse,"3.4 Hydrolysis of cellulosic feedstock-bagasse Recent studies showed that a variety of alkaline pretreatments using NaOH, Ca(OH)2 or ammonia could not only remove lignin and some hemicellulose effectively but also enhanced the accessibility of cellulolytic enzymes to the cellulose resulting in higher hydrolysis efficiency (Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008). Acidic pretreatments (using sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid) were also found to be effective in assisting enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose (Zhang et al., 2007; Saha et al., 2005). In this study, the saccharification performance of bagasse by cellulases from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 was examined at 45°C and pH 6 using non-pretreated, acid pretreated and alkaline pretreated bagasse as substrate. The sugar conversion of bagasse with acidic pretreatment, alkaline pretreatment, and no pretreatment was around 60%, 95% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 5 a), indicating that pretreatments are indeed required to ensure a high enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and the alkaline pretreatment seems to be the most effective method able to achieve the highest monosaccharide yield from bagasse through enzymatic saccharification. Fig. 5b shows the performance of saccharification of pretreated and non-pretreated bagasse by the novel cellulolytic enzymes produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3. The enzymatic hydrolysis of bagasse mainly produced the monosaccharide (such as glucose and xylose) without the accumulation of cellobiose. The time-course saccharification results show that after hydrolysis of alkaline-pretreated bagasse, the highest glucose and xylose concentration reached 7.09 and 2.33g/L, respectively and the monosaccharide production rate was nearly 0.25 and 0.10g/L/h, for glucose and xylose, respectively. However, hydrolysis of the non-pretreated bagasse exhibited much lower reaction rate (0.02 and 0.01g/L/h for glucose and xylose, respectively) and a lower monosaccharide yield of 1.5 and 0.69g/L for glucose and xylose, respectively (Fig. 5b). For hydrolysis of acid-pretreated bagasse produced mainly glucose at a rate and yield of 0.22g/L/h and 4.7g/L, respectively (Fig. 5b). Production of xylose was negligible since most of hemicellulose was removed after acidic pretreatment (data not shown). Therefore, the alkaline pretreatment seems to be a better approach for improving the ability of cellulose hydrolysis by the cellulolytic enzymes produced by Pseudomonas sp. CL3."
13,Hydrogen production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation strategy (SHF),"3.5 Hydrogen production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation strategy (SHF) To evaluate whether the hydrolytic products from enzymatic hydrolysis of the alkaline pretreated bagasse could be converted to biohydrogen, the cellulosic hydrolysate was used as substrate for C. pasteurianum CH4 to produce hydrogen by separate hydrolysis and fermentation process. In the enzymatic hydrolysis stage, 20g/L of alkaline pretreated bagasse was hydrolyzed by cellulosic enzymes produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3. The enzyme dosage was endo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, 45U/ml; exo-β-1,4-d-glucanase, 7U/ml; β-1,4-d-glucosidase, 100U/ml; xylanase, 35U/ml. The enzymatic hydrolysis was performed for 162h, achieving a maximum glucose concentration of 13.2g/L (90% sugar conversion) and 3.8g/L of xylose under pH 6.0 and 45°C. At the end of hydrolysis stage, C. pasteurianum CH4 cells at 3% (v/v) inoculum size were inoculated into the solution containing the bagasse hydrolysate and Endo-medium (Lo et al., 2008b), which were incubated at 37°C for batch dark fermentation to produce biohydrogen. Fig. 6 a shows that after inoculation of C. pasteurianum CH4, the H2 gas quickly evolved along with rapid glucose consumption, reaching the highest cumulative H2 production of 1420ml/L within 96h of cultivation time. The H2 content in the biogas was around 31%. Xylose utilization was poor (Fig. 6a) since C. pasteurianum CH4 cannot assimilate pentose efficiently, whereas it is an excellent bioH2 producing when utilizing hexose (such as glucose) (Lo et al., 2008a). The maximum H2 production rate was 35ml/L/h and the H2 yield was 0.96molH2/molglucose. The major soluble metabolites produced at the end of fermentation were acetate (HAc), butyrate (HBu), butanol (BuOH) and lactate, while a relatively smaller amount of ethanol (EtOH), 2,3-butanediol (23-BDO), and formate was produced (Fig. 6b and c). It also shows that HAc and HBu were the predominant metabolites, as the combined amount of HAc and HBu accounted for 61.7% of total soluble microbial products (SMP). In contrast, formation of alcohols (EtOH, BuOH, and 2,3-BDO) and lactate, known to exhibit negative effect on hydrogen production due to the competition for free electrons against H2 formation (Chong et al., 2009), was much less when compared with formation of HAc and HBu. Therefore, analysis of soluble metabolites composition suggests that the metabolic flux seemed to favor pathway for bioH2 production (Chen et al., 2005). The results indicate that production of cellulosic biohydrogen from bagasse feedstock was successful when using C. pasteurianum CH4 as the bioH2 producer and using novel cellulolytic enzymes produced from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 for saccharification of the lignocellulosic feedstock. Production of cellulosic biohydrogen has been a hot research topic recently. Lo et al. (2008b) utilized carboxymethyl-cellulose (10g/L) as the substrate to produce biohydrogen by Clostridium species, attaining a H2 production amount and yield of approximately 23.8ml/L and 0.097mmolH2/g cellulose, respectively. Ren et al. (2010) used cellulose (Avicel type PH105; 10g/L) as substrate to produce hydrogen at a cumulative amount of 1525ml/L and a production rate of 33ml/L/h by cow dung compost enriched cultures. Cui et al. (2010) used mixed enzymes (containing arabinase, cellulase, beta-glucanase, hemicellulase and xylanase) to hydrolyze poplar leaves for subsequent bioH2 production. The maximum cumulative hydrogen yield was 44.92ml/g-dry poplar leaves. Fan et al. (2006) used a hydrogen-producing microflora (cow dung compost) to convert wheat straw to H2, attaining a hydrogen content of 52% and a maximum bioH2 production rate and yield of 10.14mlH2/gTVS/h and 68.1mlH2/gTVS, respectively. Levin et al. (2009) also reported that the current yields of cellulosic H2 ranged from 1 to 2molH2/molhexose. Comparison with the results mentioned above shows that the performance of cellulosic H2 production of this work is comparable or better than most of the reported results reported in the relevant studies."
14,Conclusions,"An indigenous Pseudomonas sp. CL3 strain produces novel cellulolytic enzymes consisting of endoglucanase, exoglucanase, β-glucosidase and xylanase. These cellulolytic enzymes could effectively hydrolyze alkaline-pretreated bagasse, achieving over 95% monosaccharide yield. Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process was applied to produce cellulosic hydrogen using enzymes produced from strain LC3 and an effective H2-producing isolate (C. pasteurianum CH4). C. pasteurianum CH4 could utilize the bagasse hydrolysate (90% sugar yield) to produce bioH2 at a maximum rate of 35ml/L/h and a yie1d of 0.96mol/mol glucose, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of converting bagasse to bioH2 via the proposed SHF process."
