0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as the most promising energy carrier for providing a clean, reliable and sustainable energy system. It could offer an answer to the threat of global climate change and avoid undesirable issues associated with the use of fossil fuels. It can be produced from a diverse array of potential feed stocks including water, fossil fuels and organic matter. Although hydrogen is currently more expensive than fossil fuels, hydrogen produced from water and renewable resources is virtually inexhaustible, environmentally benign energy resource that could meet most of our future energy needs [1]. Various methods are available for hydrogen production [2,3] and each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. Currently, steam reforming of natural gas is considered as the most cost-effective route for large scale hydrogen production [4]. Due to various issues related to the storage and transport of hydrogen [5], there is an immediate requirement of small scale methods for onsite hydrogen production, for applications such as for fuel cells [6]. Though compact steam reformers using natural gas and methanol are under development [7,8], there are many issues associated with them, such as carbon monoxide removal, long start-up time, poor transient response etc. Electrolysis is the best option for producing hydrogen very quickly and conveniently. Electrolysis of water can generate very high pure hydrogen and is considered as the most promising technology for small scale production of hydrogen [9]. The disadvantage of this process is that the energy requirement is very high. Theoretically the energy consumption is 39.4kWh/kg or 3.54kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen, while for a commercial water electrolyser it is about 50–55kWh/kg or 4.5–5kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen [10]. Though various methods have been reported for reducing energy consumption of water electrolysis [11,12], theoretical requirement itself is very high. This method will become more attractive if low cost electricity or electricity from renewable sources is available. Electrolysis of aqueous methanol is another promising method for onsite hydrogen production, and it has been reported that hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of methanol–water mixture, at a very low operating voltage, compared to water electrolysis [13]. Though carbon dioxide, a green house gas, is produced during this process, the net carbon dioxide emission will be negligible, since methanol can be produced from biomass [14], a renewable source. When aqueous methanol is electrolyzed, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced, at ambient temperature and pressure. Further, production can be started and stopped easily. Another advantage is that, if the electrolysis of aqueous methanol is carried out in a proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) based electrolyser, hydrogen and carbon dioxide gets automatically separated and hydrogen free from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide etc. can be produced. These features make this process more attractive than catalytic steam reforming of methanol, for distributed production of hydrogen. For the production of hydrogen by aqueous methanol electrolysis, methanol–water solution is supplied to the anode compartment of a PEM based electrolytic cell (Fig. 1 ) and DC power is applied. At the anode, methanol reacts with water to produce carbon dioxide, protons and electrons. The carbon dioxide produced at the anode reaction is exhausted outside. The protons produced at the anode move to the cathode through the proton conducting membrane electrolyte. The electrons produced at the anode move to the cathode through the external circuit and combines with proton to produce hydrogen at cathode. The reaction at the anode, cathode and overall reaction is represented as follows: (1.1) Anode: CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +6H+ +6e− (1.2) Cathode: 6H+ +6e− →3H2 (1.3) Overall reaction: CH3OH+H2O→3H2 +CO2 The theoretical voltage required for the above methanol–water solution electrolysis is 0.02V only, which is very much lower compared to 1.23V required for water electrolysis. Hence the corresponding theoretical energy consumption for aqueous methanol electrolysis is very low. In spite of the above advantages of this process, only few groups are active in this area and limited work has been reported [15–20]. We have carried out systematic investigation of aqueous methanol electrolysis to understand the effects of various parameters on hydrogen production and the details are presented in this paper."
1,Experimental,
2,Membrane pretreatment,"2.1 Membrane pretreatment Nafion membrane from DuPont, USA was used as the proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. Prior to use, it was boiled in 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove any organic impurities, washed with water, and then boiled in 1M sulfuric acid to remove any metallic impurities as well as to convert the membrane fully to the H+ form [21]. Finally, it was boiled in distilled water."
3,Fabrication of membrane electrode assembly (MEA),"2.2 Fabrication of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) The most important component in the electrolyser is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). It is an assembly of anode, proton conducting membrane and cathode. Pt catalyst supported on carbon (20% Pt/C, from E-Tek USA) and Pt–Ru alloy supported on carbon (40% Pt–Ru/C from E-Tek, USA) were used as a cathode catalyst and anode catalyst, respectively. The choice of Pt–Ru/C was based on the fact that it is the most widely used anode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells. Membrane electrode assembly was prepared by decal method [22]. The catalyst inks for anode and cathode were prepared by mixing the catalyst powders, Nafion solution, and isopropyl alcohol. Then the catalyst inks were applied on a polyimide film such that the platinum loading is 0.5mg/cm2 for cathode and 3.0mg/cm2 for anode, and the inks were dried. The catalyst coated polyimide film was placed on both sides of the pretreated Nafion-117 membrane and was hot pressed at 130°C, at 20kg/cm2 for 300s. The polyimide film was peeled off, leaving a uniform layer of the catalyst on both sides of the membrane. The MEA thus obtained was used for fabricating PEM electrolyser. The active area of the electrode was 25cm2."
4,Assembly of aqueous methanol electrolyser cell,"2.3 Assembly of aqueous methanol electrolyser cell The PEM methanol electrolyser was fabricated as described below. The MEA was placed between two Teflon coated fiber reinforced gaskets of thickness 0.22mm and inserted between two platinized titanium plates with straight parallel grooves (area 25cm2) at the centre. Platinized titanium mesh of thickness 0.2mm, was placed on both sides of the catalyst coated MEA for effective current collection and for uniform gas distribution. The above items were clamped together using nuts and bolts, by applying uniform torque, to develop the electrolyser cell. The cell had provision for heating, temperature control and had suitable ports for feeding reactants and removal of products."
5,Evaluation of methanol–water electrolyser cell,"2.4 Evaluation of methanol–water electrolyser cell The methanol–water solutions of different concentrations were prepared by diluting AR methanol with de-ionized water and the solution was circulated into the anode compartment of electrolyser by the use of peristaltic pump. The electrolysis was conducted to generate hydrogen at the cathode, by applying current across the two terminals of the electrolyser using a programmable DC power supply unit having constant current and constant voltage mode provisions. Hydrogen production rate was calculated from the cell current and was cross-examined by gas volume measurement. Purity of hydrogen gas was checked by hydrogen purity analyzer (Model No. 335WP Nova Analytical Systems, USA) which was calibrated with high pure hydrogen gas and by gas chromatography."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of methanol concentration,"3.1 Effect of methanol concentration Electrolysis of aqueous methanol solution was carried out, at a cell voltage of 1V, in a PEM electrolyser cell of active area 25cm2, using Nafion-117 membrane, at 30°C. Hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide gas were generated at cathode and anode, respectively. The concentration of methanol was varied from 1M to 10M to study the effect of methanol concentration on current density, which is directly related to rate of hydrogen production. The observed current density and corresponding rate of hydrogen production for various concentrations of methanol are shown in Fig. 2 . A sharp increase in current density and hydrogen production was observed upto about 4M methanol concentrations and from 4M to 6M, the increase was only marginal. Highest current density (about 680mA/cm2 at 1V) was obtained using 6M methanol. At higher concentration of methanol, say beyond 6M concentration, the current density and hydrogen production rate were found to decrease. The decrease in current density beyond 6M methanol concentration may be attributed to dissolution of Nafion ionomer present in the catalyst layer, at higher concentration of methanol [23]. Take et al. [20] has reported a similar trend in behavior, but they observed a maximum performance at about 12M methanol concentration. Since we observed only a marginal increase in performance beyond 4M methanol, this concentration was chosen for further studies. Reasons for decrease in current density beyond 6M methanol concentration is being studied in detail. One of the reasons for the variation of current density with methanol concentration may be correlated to change of membrane conductivity with methanol concentration. Nafion membrane is described as a series of clusters interconnected by narrow pores. In each cluster, the fixed membrane charges extend inward the center of each sphere. Due to the lower polarity of methanol compared to water, as the aqueous methanol concentration is increased, the cluster size is increased and hence the ionic conductivity of the membrane decreases with increase in methanol concentration, resulting in lower current density at high methanol concentrations [24]."
8,Effect of operating voltage,"3.2 Effect of operating voltage It is well known that power required for electrolysis is directly related to the applied cell voltage. Hence the effect of operating voltage on cell current and hydrogen production was studied. Electrolysis of 4M aqueous methanol solution was carried out in an electrolyser cell using Nafion-117 membrane with an active electrode area of 25cm2, at 30°C and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 3 . Hydrogen production was found to begin even below 0.4V, and as expected, current density and hydrogen gas production were found to increase with increase in applied voltage. A high cell performance of 0.5A/cm2 at 0.9V and 1A/cm2 at 1.2V was obtained at 30°C. This corresponds to an energy consumption of about 2.15kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen (at 0.5A/cm2) and 2.87kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen (at 1A/cm2), at 30°C. This is very much below the energy consumption of commercial water electrolysers."
9,Effect of operating temperature,"3.3 Effect of operating temperature The dependence of temperature on electrolyser performance was investigated by carrying out electrolysis of 4M aqueous methanol solution at various temperatures, in an electrolyser cell using Nafion-117 membrane with an active electrode area of 25cm2. Current density and the corresponding hydrogen production rate at various cell voltages, at various temperatures are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. The current density and hydrogen gas production rate were found to increase with increase in temperature. The observed improvement in cell performance with temperature may be attributed to enhanced catalytic activity and decrease in ohmic resistance. At 80°C, it was possible to operate the methanol electrolyser at very high current densities (at high hydrogen production rates), at very low cell voltages. The cell voltages of methanol electrolyser operated at 0.5A/cm2, 1A/cm2 and 2A/cm2 were 0.62V, 0.85V and 1.2V, respectively, at 80°C. The energy consumption corresponding to hydrogen production rates of 0.5A/cm2, 1A/cm2 and 2A/cm2 were 1.48kWh/Nm3, 2.03kWh/Nm3 and 2.87kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen, respectively."
10,Effect of membrane electrolyte thickness,"3.4 Effect of membrane electrolyte thickness The dependence of membrane electrolyte thickness on methanol electrolyser performance was studied by fabricating MEAs using Nafion membranes of three different thickness viz., Nafion-117 (thickness 7mils), Nafion-115 (thickness 5mils) and Nafion-112 (thickness 2mils), and carrying out electrolysis using 4M methanol at 30°C. The observed electrolyser performance is given in Fig. 6 . The cell performance was found to follow the order: Nafion-112>Nafion-115>Nafion-117. This trend in performance may be attributed to the variation of thickness and hence electrical resistance of the membranes. Best cell performance was obtained with Nafion-112 and it was possible to operate the electrolyser at 1.67A/cm2 at 1.2V, even at 30°C, using this membrane. Though performance was higher, as expected, the methanol permeation to the cathode compartment was higher with thinner membranes [25]. Due to the lower methanol crossover and better mechanical stability, Nafion-117 is thus preferred for hydrogen production by aqueous methanol electrolysis."
11,Purity of hydrogen,"3.5 Purity of hydrogen Crossover of methanol across the membrane takes place in an aqueous methanol electrolyser, as in the case of direct methanol fuel cell. Hence the hydrogen produced may contain methanol vapor. The crossover rate and hence the concentration of methanol in the evolved hydrogen depend on various factors such as: methanol concentration, current density, membrane thickness, membrane characteristics etc. and methods for inhibition of methanol crossover are discussed by Dillon et al. [26]. In the present work, the hydrogen gas generated from the electrolyser was bubbled through water to remove methanol vapor and was dried by passing through silica gel column. Purity of the gas was then checked using Nova hydrogen analyzer (Nova Analytical Systems, USA), which indicated 99.8% hydrogen purity. The gas chromatography analysis indicated the presence of 0.21% carbon dioxide. Other researchers have also reported the presence of small quantity of carbon dioxide in hydrogen [20]. It can be explained due to its permeation from anode to cathode compartment, through the electrolyte membrane [27]. Carbon monoxide was found to be absent and hence the hydrogen gas produced from aqueous methanol electrolyser can be used for PEM fuel cell applications."
12,Conclusion,"The present investigation indicated that hydrogen, free from carbon monoxide, with only traces of carbon dioxide can be produced very conveniently by the electrolysis of aqueous methanol in a PEM electrolyser, using Pt–Ru/C anode and Pt/C cathode. This method is thus an attractive alternative to catalytic reforming of methanol for distributed hydrogen production. This study also indicated that aqueous methanol electrolyser can be operated at a very high current density, at a much lower operating voltage compared to water electrolyser. The cell voltages of methanol electrolyser at 0.5A/cm2, 1A/cm2 and 2A/cm2 hydrogen production rates were 0.62V, 0.85V and 1.2V, respectively, using Nafion-117 membrane, at 80°C, which corresponds to an energy consumption of 1.48kWh/Nm3, 2.03kWh/Nm3 and 2.87kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen. The performance of cells using thinner membranes such as Nafion-115 and Nafion-112 was found to be still higher. Since the theoretical voltage for aqueous methanol electrolysis is very low, there is scope for further reduction in energy consumption for hydrogen production by this method."
