0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main greenhouse gases. The massive emission of CO2 causes intractable and negative effects on global environment issues [1,2]. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that the atmospheric CO2 concentration may reach 570 ppm by 2100 [3]. However, CO2 can be regarded as an economical, nontoxic and renewable C1 resource for synthesis of various high value-added chemicals, which not only alleviates CO2 emissions but produces valuable chemicals simultaneously [4]. Therefore, the transformation and utilization of CO2 has become a highly promising topic in sustainable chemistry. Among many valuable chemicals, methanol (MeOH) can serve as an efficient energy storage chemical and an alternative transportable fuel in the future on the basis of the “Methanol Economy” concept [5]. The conversion of CO2 to MeOH can be realized either by direct or indirect hydrogenation. Regarding the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to MeOH, it has been studied extensively and usually carried out with 5–10 MPa of hydrogen pressure at 250–300 °C due to high activation energy for the cleavage of the CO bonds in CO2 [6–9]. Alternatively, indirect conversion of CO2 to MeOH can be realized via the hydrogenation of CO2-derived ethylene carbonate (EC) with the accompanying production of ethylene glycol (EG) under mild conditions (140–180 °C, 3–5 MPa of H2), which is also regarded as a promising route (Scheme 1 ). In particular, EC is commercially available from the well-established “Omega process”, in which the cycloaddition of CO2 with ethylene oxide is involved [10,11]. This indirect conversion process can be considered as an example of a green carbon cycle that generates no carbon waste. Therefore, current researches have been focused on the development of effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of EC to promote the efficient utilization of CO2. Recently, Ding et al. [11] and Rueping et al. [12] separately reported the hydrogenation of EC to MeOH and EG over homogeneous PNP/Ru and Mn-PNN complexes, achieving 99% and 92% MeOH yield, respectively. Despite high yields, difficult separation and recovery of the homogeneous catalysts hinders their large-scale industrial applications. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysts attract much attention owing to their advantages in convenient recovery and separation. Amongst the heterogeneous catalysts, Cu-based catalysts are very appealing due to their excellent performance in CO/CO bond cleavage [13–16]. Several research groups have investigated the hydrogenation of EC with Cu-based (such as Cu/SiO2) catalysts prepared by various methods [17–23]. The Cu particle size, stable Cu+ species and surface Cu+/(Cu++ Cu0) ratio were generally believed to be critical for MeOH selectivity and catalyst stability. However, the Cu-based catalysts usually gave low MeOH selectivity (ca. 56–82%) and suffered deactivation during the reaction. To further increase MeOH selectivity and improve the catalyst stability of the Cu-based catalysts, modification of Cu-based catalysts with different additives such as transition metal oxides or organic compounds has been attempted. For instance, Li et al. demonstrated that β-cyclodextrin modified Cu/SiO2 catalysts possessed higher dispersion of Cu particles and excellent catalyst stability [21]. In our previous work, MeOH selectivity and catalyst stability for the hydrogenation of EC were greatly improved on a MgO-ZrO2 modified Cu/SiO2 catalyst due to smaller Cu particle size and modulation of surface acidity [22]. In another case, we modified the Cu/SiO2 catalyst with glucose and found that the glucose modification facilitated the dispersion of Cu particles, improved hydrogen adsorption ability and strengthened the interaction between Cu particles and SiO2 and thus restrained the aggregation of Cu particles and mitigated deactivation during the long-term EC hydrogenation [24]. Nevertheless, only at a rather high H2/EC molar ratio (100–300) and low weight liquid hourly space velocity (WLHSV) of EC (0.1–0.3 g·gcat. −1·h−1), did most Cu-based catalysts exhibit favorable EC conversions and good stability [17,22,24,25], which meant that the reaction needed to be conducted in huge hydrogen flow with inevitable waste of hydrogen resources which is adverse to the potential industrial application. Additionally, although the hydrogenation of EC could be carried out at a H2/EC ratio of 60 in a few cases, the space velocities of EC were still relatively low [19]. Besides, most studies were mainly focused on the preparation or modification with organic compounds for Cu/SiO2 catalysts, while Cu-additive periphery after modification with metal promoters has been rarely studied. As is well known, the metal-additive interface exerts crucial influences on the adsorption and activation of CO/CO bonds and consequent catalytic behaviors [26–28]. Therefore, development of a novel Cu-based catalyst to further improve the catalytic performance and catalyst stability still remains challenging. With regard to the EC hydrogenation to MeOH and EG, the adsorption and activation of the CO/CO bond is the most important step among all the elementary steps. Recently, Li et al. reported that a Rh-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst furnished higher selectivity in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid due to MoOx addition promoting the adsorption and hydrogenation of the carboxyl group [29]. In another case, Kaneda et al. found that a Pt-Mo/HAP catalyst significantly improved the selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid to1,4-pentanediol due to partly reduced Mo species possessing oxygen vacancies which act as Lewis acidic sites to activate the carbonyl group [30]. Very recently, Xu et al. realized that MoOx species doped Ir/TUD-1 catalyst greatly enhanced the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol and they discovered that MoOx decoration resulted in the generation of Ir-MoOx interfacial sites, which promoted the adsorption and activation of CO group [31]. Besides the additives, the precursors of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst will also affect the distribution of different Cu species on the catalyst surface, and stable Cu+ species are vital for high stability in the hydrogenation reactions. Yue et al. and Gong et al. revealed that copper phyllosilicates [Cu2Si2O5(OH)2] with lamellar structure could produce stable Cu+ species on the catalyst surface [32–34]. In our preliminary studies, we also found that copper phyllosilicate-derived Cu/SiO2 catalyst, which was prepared via a modified hydrothermal (MHT) method, showed excellent catalytic performance in EC hydrogenation to MeOH, providing 89% MeOH selectivity with good reusability in a batch reactor [23]. Inspired by recent reports and our previous studies, copper phyllosilicate-derived Cu catalysts with highly stable Cu+ species as well as MoOx-assisted adsorption and activation of carbonyl groups might be promising for EC hydrogenation to MeOH and EG. Herein, the Cu-MoOx/SiO2 catalysts derived from copper phyllosilicates precursors containing different Mo contents were fabricated via a one-pot MHT method, and then applied to the hydrogenation of EC to MeOH and EG at a low H2/EC molar ratio with a high WLHSVEC. To our delight, significant improvement in MeOH selectivity and stability was achieved by MoOx modification."

2,Catalyst preparation and catalyst characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and catalyst characterization The Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method (where m represents the Mo loading). For the details for catalyst preparation procedures and catalyst characterization, please see Supporting Information."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test The heterogeneous hydrogenation of EC was performed in a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor (with 550 mm length and 12 mm inner diameter). Briefly, 1.0 g of catalyst precursor (20–40 mesh) was loaded in the middle position of the reactor with a thermocouple to monitor the actual reaction temperature. The catalyst precursor was firstly activated in hydrogen flow (2 MPa, 60 mL·min−1) at 350 °C for 4 h, and then cooled to 180 °C for EC hydrogenation. EC in 1,4-dioxane solution (containing 10 wt% EC) was pumped to the catalyst bed with WLHSVEC in the range of 0.64–1.41 h−1. The hydrogen pressure was set at 4.0 MPa and 60 mL·min−1 of H2 flow was adopted. The products were collected every 2 h and analyzed by a TECHCOMP GC-7900 Plus GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DM-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 1 μm). Experimental tests for the calculations of initial activity (in terms of turnover frequency, TOF) and activation energy (Ea ) were carried out at EC conversion below 15% by controlling the WLHSVEC. Furthermore, prior to the experiments for Ea and TOF calculations, limitations on catalytic performance due to internal and external diffusion and heat transfer were ruled out by the Weisz-Preter criterion and Mears’ criterion, respectively (see Supporting Information for the details) [35]. TOF was calculated as follows: TOF h - 1 = EC conversion rate ( m o l · g c a t . - 1 · h - 1 ) Number of Cu sites ( m o l · g c a t . - 1 ) = EC conv . % × WLHSV ÷ Molecular weight of EC m o l · g c a t . - 1 · h - 1 Number of Cu sites ( m o l · g c a t . - 1 ) EC conversion and product selectivity were defined as follows: Conversion % = mole of reactant charged - mole of reactant left mole of reactant charged × 100 % Selectivity % = mole of product generated mole of reactant charged - mole of reactant left × 100 %"

5,Physicochemical properties of catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-calcined and reduced Cu-mMoOx/SiO2. For as-calcined Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 1(a)), all the catalysts exhibited diffraction patterns at 2θ = 30.8°, 35.0°, 57.5°, 62.3° and 71.2°, assignable to copper phyllosilicates (JPCDS No. 027-0188#) [34]. Additional diffractions attributed to MoO3 at 2θ = 23.4°, 25.7°, 27.2° and 29.6° were detected only when the Mo content reached 3.75 wt%, indicating that MoOx species were highly dispersed at lower Mo loadings [36]. Moreover, no distinct CuO diffraction patterns were observed for the as-calcined catalysts, suggesting that CuO was highly dispersed. After reduction in hydrogen flow at 350 °C (Fig. 1(b)), the reduced catalysts exhibited four patterns at 2θ = 36.5°, 42.1°, 61.5° and 73.6°, corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311) of Cu2O (JCPDS No. 05-0667#), respectively, possibly derived from the reduction of Cu-O-Si units or copper phyllosilicates [20]. In addition, three diffraction patterns at 2θ = 43.4°, 50.1° and 74° belonging to the typical metallic Cu phase (JCPDS 04-0836) were also detected in Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts with higher Mo loadings. No crystalline phase ascribed to CuMoO4 was detected, which might be derived from a reaction between copper and Mo species. Meanwhile, with increasing Mo content, the intensity of Cu2O diffraction patterns obviously decreased while that of the Cu diffraction patterns increased, especially for Cu-0.11MoOx/SiO2 and Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. This indicates that introduction of MoOx resulted in different distribution and morphology of Cu species, which might lead to different catalytic behaviors towards the hydrogenation of EC. FT-IR characterization was also adopted as a useful technique to discriminate copper phyllosilicate phase and to evaluate the relative amount of copper phyllosilicates in the as-calcined catalyst. The FT-IR spectra displayed in Fig. 2 (a) confirmed the formation of copper phyllosilicates in Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 as evidenced by the appearance of a δOH band at 670 cm−1 and a νSiO shoulder peak at 1040 cm−1. Accordingly, the relative amount of copper phyllosilicates in the as-calcined Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 was also determined using the peak area ratio of I670/I800 at 670 cm−1 and 800 cm−1 (the νSiO band of SiO2) [37,38]. As a result, the ratio of I670/I800 for as-calcined Cu/SiO2 is 1.09. With increasing Mo loading, the relative amount of copper phyllosilicates gradually decreased by the order of Cu/SiO2 (1.09) > Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 (0.78) > Cu-0.05MoOx/SiO2 (0.70) > Cu-0.11MoOx/SiO2 (0.64) > Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 (0.36). Nevertheless, a new band appeared at approximately 970 cm−1, suggesting the formation of Cu-O-Si species [39,40]. After reduction, the δOH vibration of copper phyllosilicates at 670 cm−1 almost disappeared (Fig. 2(b)), indicating that copper phyllosilicates were entirely reduced to copper species with lower valences. Furthermore, all the reduced samples showed a shoulder peak at 968 cm−1, suggesting the presence of Cu+-O-Si units in the reduced catalyst (Fig. 2(b)) [39,40]. Figure S1 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions of the as-calcined Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. They exhibited type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops at high pressures, characteristics of the mesoporous structures (Figure S1(a)). The pore size distribution curves (Figure S1(b)) displayed a peak centered at 3.4 nm, which was a hint of copper phyllosilicates formation and was in good agreement with the XRD and FT-IR results [23]. For clarity, Table 1 summarizes the physicochemical properties of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. Clearly, the catalysts had similar Cu loading and specific surface areas (393–413 m2·g−1) when Mo content was low. However, as Mo content increased, the Cu loading and specific surface areas of Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 (m = 0.11 and 3.75) decreased gradually. Additionally, the pore volumes of Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 also exhibited a similar tendency. The different contents of copper phyllosilicates in Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 precursors may be responsible for the above changes (Fig. 2(a)). The above phenomena suggested the addition of MoOx to Cu/SiO2 could modify the textural properties. To deeply understand the dispersion and morphology, the reduced Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts were characterized by TEM (Figure S2). All the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts had similar morphologies. According to the statistical results (analyses of more than 150 Cu particles for each catalyst), the Cu grain sizes for the MoOx-modified Cu/SiO2 catalysts (2.7–3.4 nm) are slightly smaller than those in Cu/SiO2 (3.7 nm). The dispersion (DCu), particle size (dCu) and surface area (Scu 0) of metallic copper species in reduced Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 was also determined by dissociative N2O chemisorption and also listed in Table 1, which were in good agreement with those obtained from TEM characterization. DCu increased obviously from 26.5% for Cu/SiO2 to 30.8% for Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2, and to 48.9% for Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. It suggests that MoOx modification is beneficial for the dispersion of Cu particles. Moreover, a similar trend was found in the corresponding Scu 0, which gradually increased from 56.2 m2·g−1 for Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 to 68.8 m2·g−1 for Cu-0.11MoOx/SiO2 and then decreased to 63.8 m2·g−1 for Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. Nevertheless, it was obvious that both DCu and Scu 0 for the MoOx promoted Cu/SiO2 catalysts were evidently higher than those for Cu/SiO2. As is well known, relatively higher DCu and larger Scu 0 are usually believed to be key factors for achieving excellent catalytic performance in the hydrogenation reactions with Cu-based catalysts. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM-EDX element-mapping was also applied to determine the surface distributions of Cu and Mo elements on the reduced Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. As displayed in Fig. 3 , uniform distribution of Cu, Mo and O is clearly observed, which confirms the formation of Cu-Mo interface derived from their close contact and strong interaction."
6,Evaluation of catalytic performance and stability,"3.2 Evaluation of catalytic performance and stability First, the blank experiment was performed to investigate whether 1,4-dioxane was stable enough under the tested conditions. As a result, 1,4-dioxane proved to be a stable solvent and no related product was detected in the blank experiment of 1,4-dioxane hydrogenation (for details, please refer to Supporting Information). The catalytic performance of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts for the hydrogenation of EC was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor and the results are summarized in Table 2 . For the Cu/SiO2 catalyst, 99.5% EC conversion and 78.5% MeOH selectivity were obtained accompanied by 99% EG selectivity. After doping with MoOx, the MoOx-promoted Cu/SiO2 catalysts furnished EC conversion of over 99% when the MoOx doping amount was below 0.05 wt%. EC conversion slightly decreased with MoOx doping down to 95.5% for Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. Moreover, about 99% selectivity to EG was obtained over the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. Interestingly, the MoOx doped Cu/SiO2 catalysts markedly enhanced the MeOH selectivity under the same conditions, following a sequence of Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 (89.5%) > Cu-0.05MoOx/SiO2 (87.1%) > Cu-0.11MoOx/SiO2 (83.3%) > Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 (80.2%) > Cu/SiO2 (78.5%). In addition, with the introduction of MoOx, the space time yield of MeOH (STYMeOH) over the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts showed a significant increase compared with that on Cu/SiO2, and the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst possessed the maximum STYMeOH of 0.207 g·gcat −1·h−1 (Table 2). As for that the selectivity to MeOH was a little lower than that to EG, it is mainly due to that EC can decompose to CO and CO2 via decarbonylation or decarboxylation under the hydrogenation conditions [17,43]. For clarity, Table S3 lists the quantitative concentrations of main by-products, CO and CO2, which were detected and calculated at MeOH balance of around 99%. One thing possibly concerned is the CO2 generated in the reaction may go on to form water by reverse water gas shift (RWGS), which will then hydrolyze EC and reform CO2 - potentially in a repeating cycle under reaction conditions. However, after we carefully surveyed the literature, we noticed that the RWGS occurred only at above 200 °C. [41,42] When we recalled the hydrogenation of EC in this case, it was conducted at 180 °C, much lower than the temperature for RWGS reaction. Therefore, RWGS reaction can be excluded under the tested conditions for EC hydrogenation with Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. Among the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts discussed above, the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst afforded 99.2% EC conversion with the highest MeOH selectivity of 89.5%, which might be the best candidate for the EC hydrogenation at this stage. Therefore, we adopted the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst as a representative to further investigate the effect of WLHSVEC on the catalytic performance. Fig. 4 (a) shows the effect of WLHSVEC on EC conversion and product selectivity over the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst with the WLHSVEC varying from 0.64 to 1.41 h−1 while the H2 flow remained constant. Increasing the WLHSVEC from 0.64 to 1.41 h−1 resulted in an obvious decrease in EC conversion and MeOH selectivity. This implies that insufficient hydrogen cannot meet the requirement for the hydrogenation of EC or that the active sites on the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst surface were not enough to activate hydrogen and to adsorb/activate EC simultaneously at a very high WLHSVEC [20,25]. Even though, an EC conversion of 82% and MeOH selectivity of 81.5% can be achieved at a WLHSVEC of 1.41 h−1. Thus, the lower WLHSVEC (0.64) is more suitable to achieve higher EC conversion and MeOH selectivity. In order to obtain the intrinsic catalytic activity, the hydrogenation of EC with the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalyst was further investigated in kinetic regime (<15% EC conversion), and TOF values of the catalysts were calculated based on surface Cu atoms. Notably, the TOF values obtained with the MoOx doped Cu/SiO2 catalysts were significantly enhanced compared with that for Cu/SiO2 (Table 2). As a result, the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with the TOF reaching 17.5 h−1, much higher than that on Cu/SiO2 (9.2 h−1). The result suggests that the reaction rate is much faster on the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst. Indeed, according to the Arrhenius plots displayed in Fig. 4(b), Ea with the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst (72.9 kJ· mol−1) is much lower than that with the Cu/SiO2 catalyst (109.0 kJ· mol−1), indicating that the modification of MoOx for the Cu/SiO2 catalyst might result in new hydrogenation active sites and thus enhance the catalytic efficiency. In addition, the long-term stability of the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst was also an important concern from the viewpoint of potential industrial application. As displayed in Fig. 4(c), the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibited excellent stability even at the H2/EC molar ratio of 20, accompanied by 90% MeOH selectivity and 99% EG selectivity during 150 h time on stream. In contrast, the Cu/SiO2 catalyst without MoOx doping gradually deactivated after 80 h time on stream. As a result, EC conversion declined from 99% to 80% and the MeOH selectivity distinctly decreased from 79% to 68% after 150 h time on stream, much lower than that obtained with the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst under the same conditions. In order to make clear the reason for the declined catalyst activity, the used catalysts were characterized using TEM (Figure S3). As a result, severe Cu particle agglomeration was observed on the used Cu/SiO2 catalyst (from 3.7 to 9.2 nm) after 150 h time on stream while the average Cu grain size only increased from 3.4 to 4.5 nm for the used Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst. This demonstrates that the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst had much better stability than the unmodified Cu/SiO2 catalyst in the long-term hydrogenation of CO2-derived EC to MeOH and EG. In order to deeply understand the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalyst, we compared the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst with other heterogeneous Cu-based catalysts applied to the hydrogenation of EC in a fixed-bed reactor in the literature. Accordingly, the STY of MeOH was calculated according to the original data in the literature as well, which are summarized in Table 3 for convenience. Under the similar reaction conditions, most of the Cu-based catalysts in the literature exhibited an STYMeOH ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 g·gcat −1·h−1. For instance, the Cu catalysts supported on SiO2-based materials, such as the Cu/HMS catalyst and S-1@Cu catalyst, gave an STYMeOH of 0.027 and 0.044 g·gcat −1·h−1, respectively [17,25]. The Cu/MCM-41 catalyst, the 3.0-CuSi-NAM catalyst and the Cu/SiO2-F-3.75 catalyst exhibited a higher STYMeOH of 0.08–0.19 g·gcat −1·h−1 [19,20,43]. When introducing additives (such as MgO-ZrO2, Al and glucose) to modify the Cu-based catalysts, an STYMeOH ranging from 0.03 to 0.05 g·gcat −1·h−1 was obtained at relatively lower WLHSVEC, but the selectivity to MeOH was significantly improved except CuAl/SiO2 [22,24,44]. Very recently, when we were preparing this manuscript, we noticed that a Mo doped Cu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited an STYMeOH of 0.294 g·gcat −1·h−1 at a H2/EC ratio of 180, which was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method using Cu/SiO2 powder as support while the Cu/SiO2 powder was prepared by the typical ammonia evaporation method [45]. In this work, the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst, which was prepared by a one-pot MHT method, afforded an STYMeOH of 0.402 g·gcat −1·h−1 at a H2/EC ratio of 20, which is higher than those obtained with other Cu-based catalysts. The Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the one-pot MHT method in this case possessed smaller Cu particle size, higher Cu particle dispersion, higher SCu 0, higher Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) ratio and thus lower apparent activation energy. The significant difference in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalyst will be further distinguished in combination with other characterization results in the following parts."
7,Investigation of Cu species,"3.3 Investigation of Cu species To deeply understand the potential structure-activity relationship in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, a series of characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, in situ XPS, and in situ FT-IR were applied. Firstly, the as-calcined Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts were characterized using H2-TPR to determine the reducibility and to investigate the interaction of metal-support/dopant (Fig. 5 ). For as-calcined Cu/SiO2, a reduction peak at 227 °C (α) is assigned to the reduction of highly dispersed CuO to Cu0 and copper phyllosilicates to Cu+ [23,46]. In addition, a small peak centered at around 290 °C (β) for the as-calcined Cu/SiO2 catalyst was also detected and could be attributed to the reduction of the well-dispersed CuO species bearing stronger interaction with SiO2 [23,47]. After modification with MoOx, the profiles of the as-calcined Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 displayed some differences. The α reduction peak gradually shifted to lower temperatures (from 227 to 208 °C) with increasing MoOx content. This observation implies that Cu-MoOx interaction becomes stronger in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts with higher MoOx content, resulting in easier reduction of Cu oxides. Meanwhile, the H2 consumption of α peak and total consumption decreased from 2.84 and 3.02 mmol·g−1 for as-calcined Cu/SiO2 to 1.22 and 2.29 mmol·g−1 for as-calcined Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2, respectively, suggesting that introduction of MoOx species is beneficial to the reduction of Cu species to Cu+ or Cu0 (Fig. 5). In addition, all the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 samples displayed a smaller total H2 consumption than their stoichiometric CuO species (Table S1), suggesting that Cu oxide species are not completely reduced to Cu0, part of them being reduced to Cu+ species. Nevertheless, the total hydrogen consumption is almost exactly the same fraction of the calculated stoichiometric amount required for compete reduction to metal (59 ± 1%, derived from Table S1), except for as-calcined Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. This indicates that Mo reduces the temperature of Cu reduction, but does not make it more extensive. Moreover, another reduction peak centered at around 310–350 °C (γ) was also detected for as-calcined MoOx modified Cu/SiO2 catalysts, which could be ascribed to the combined reduction of Cu oxide bearing interaction with MoO3 and the reduction of part of MoO3 owing to the typical spillover effect. Obviously, H2-TPR results proved that there was strong interaction between CuOx and MoOx species due to intimate contact. Additionally, the acidity of catalysts also played an important role in ester hydrogenation reaction, because the Lewis acid sites (LAS) can polarize the OCO group of esters [48]. Therefore, the strength and types of acid sites on the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts were characterized using NH3-TPD and in situ FTIR spectroscopy using pyridine as probes. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), all the catalysts showed a main NH3-desorption peak in the range of 100–400 °C, suggesting the existence of weak and medium acidity [35]. Deconvolution of the peak resulted in two peaks including the one centered at <200 °C (weak acidity) and the other one in the range of 200–400 °C (medium acidity), respectively. The medium acidity peak gradually shifted to lower temperatures while the acid site amount in this region increased with the increase of MoOx content. Besides, a weak NH3-desorption peak in the strong acidity region (around 500 °C) was also detected for the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. However, the strong acid site gradually disappeared with increasing the MoOx content. Especially for the Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 catalyst with the lowest Cu content but the highest MoOx content, it had the highest weak and medium acidity but the lowest strong acidity, probably owing to that too much MoOx species, which possess weak and medium Lewis acidity, cover the surface CuOx species, consistent with the HAADF-STEM analyses (Fig. 3(b)). The above results indicate that the MoOx loading had obvious effect on the strength and quantity of the surface acid sites. Furthermore, to determine the acidity types in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, the pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectra were measured (Fig. 6(b)). All the catalysts displayed the IR bands at 1450, 1490 and 1607 cm−1, assignable to pyridine adsorbed on the LAS [23]. Because no typical IR band at 1540 cm−1 attributed to pyridine-adsorbed Brønsted acid sites was detected, we can conclude that only LAS existed on the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalyst surface. Based on the above discussions, the XRD, H2-TPR, and HAADF-STEM-EDX elemental-mapping characterization results suggest that a strong interaction exists between Cu and MoOx in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, which plays a crucial role in achieving high catalytic performance and stability. In order to further explore the nature of the interaction, the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts were further investigated using in situ XPS and in situ CO adsorbed FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the Cu 2p XPS spectra of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts showed two distinct peaks at around 932 and 952 eV, assigning to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 of Cu0/Cu+ species, respectively. It seemed that Cu2+ species were completely reduced to Cu+/Cu0 species because of absence of Cu2+ satellite peak. More importantly, the peak of Cu 2p slightly shifted to higher values by 0.1–0.6 eV in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts with increase of the MoOx content, suggesting the strong interactions between the Cu and MoOx due to electron transfer from Cu to MoOx. Furthermore, to distinguish Cu0/Cu+ species, Cu LMM spectra were also recorded. Two symmetrical overlapping peaks at approximately 918.6 and 916.5 eV were assigned to Cu0 and Cu+ species, respectively (Fig. 7(b)), which were commonly adopted to calculate the Cu+/(Cu++ Cu0) ratios [18,23]. As a result, the Cu+/(Cu++ Cu0) ratio increased with the increase of MoOx content (from 47.2% in Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 to 74.9% in Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2), confirming the existence of a strong interaction between Cu and MoOx species, which might be derived from the formation of a unique chemical bond (Cu-O-Mo) located at the Cu-MoOx interfaces. The strong interaction between Cu and MoOx species not only increases the number of Cu+ species but also benefits the catalyst stability. For the Mo 3d XPS spectra of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 7(c)), there were Mo5+ and Mo6+ species on the surface of Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts with higher MoOx amount [49]. The Mo5+ species probably originated from the part reduction or electron transfer from Cu species to Mo species. No obvious Mo 3d XPS peak was detected for the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts with lower Mo contents (m = 0.02, 0.05), possibly due to relatively low content of MoOx. Subsequently, in situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts was also applied to further reveal the nature of surface electronic properties of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), only one asymmetric and intense CO vibration band centered at 2100–2160 cm−1 was detected for all the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. Obviously, the CO band can be deconvoluted to two peaks at around 2136 and 2124 cm−1. Considering that CO adsorption on the Cu2+ or Cu0 sites is weak and no Cu2+ species existed after reduction, the bands at 2136 and 2124 cm−1 should be ascribed to the Cu+–CO species [26,50]. In combination with FT-IR results (Fig. 2(b)), the Cu+-O-Si units and copper phyllosilicate-derived Cu+ species were present in the reduced Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. Therefore, we speculate that the CO bands at 2124 cm−1 and 2136 cm−1 may be attributed to CO adsorbed on copper phyllosilicate-derived Cu+ and Cu+-O-Si units, respectively. Notably, when the Mo content in Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 reached 0.11 wt%, these two bands obviously red-shifted. Such a red shift in CO band may originate from the electronic donor–acceptor interaction between neighboring MoOx and Cu, which increased the electronic density of the surface Cu species. This is inconsistent with the observation from XPS results (Fig. 7). Similar contradictory XPS and IR results were also encountered in the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate with the Zn-Cu/SiO2 catalyst and the B-Cu-SiO2 catalyst, respectively, however, the authors did not give any explanation [27,50]. This contradictory phenomenon that the IR results are inconsistent with the XPS results might be interpreted in terms of the change in the Cu particle size. According to the N2O titration and TEM results, the Cu particle sizes for the MoOx-promoted catalysts are slightly smaller than that for Cu/SiO2, especially for Cu-0.11MoOx/SiO2 and Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2, resulting in higher surface electron density on the smaller Cu particles and consequently lower wavenumber of the CO vibration band. Therefore, it seems that the observed red-shift of the IR bands in the high-MoOx-loading catalyst is due to two opposite trends. Electron transfer from Cu to Mo would result in the decrease of electron density while the decrease of Cu particle sizes would lead to the increase of electron density. Nevertheless, the change in the Cu particle is probably more pronounced. Similar explanation is also reported in the case of the MoOx-promoted Ir/TUD-1 catalyst and the NbOx-promoted Ir/SiO2 catalysts, respectively [31,51]. In addition, the CO absorbance gradually declined with the increase of MoOx amount, especially for the Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that the exposed Cu surface atoms decrease obviously due to the coverage of Cu species by MoOx species, which is in good agreement with the HAADF-STEM analyses results (Fig. 3(b)). Hence, the in situ XPS and in situ CO-FTIR spectroscopic results further confirmed the Cu-MoOx interaction and the modification of Cu by MoOx, which becomes more significant with increasing MoOx content in the catalyst."
8,FT-IR investigation of EC adsorption and in situ EC hydrogenation,"3.4 FT-IR investigation of EC adsorption and in situ EC hydrogenation In order to explore the adsorption strength of EC on the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, the FT-IR spectroscopic studies on EC desorption were conducted in flowing N2. The intensities of two IR bands at 1805 and 1775 cm−1, which were assigned to CO stretching vibration of EC molecules, gradually decreased simultaneously with rising desorption temperature from 180 to 440 °C (Fig. 8(b)), implying that EC desorbed from the catalyst surface by heating without decomposition. Nonetheless, the CO vibration bands on Cu/SiO2 decreased faster in comparison to those on Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 and Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2, indicating that the adsorption strength of EC on Cu/SiO2 is weaker than that on the other two catalysts. Clearly, the adsorption strength increased by the order of Cu/SiO2 < Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 < Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2. Interestingly, the MeOH yield increased with a sequence of Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 (77%) ≈ Cu/SiO2 (78%) < Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 (89%), when recalling the catalytic performance of EC hydrogenation on these catalysts. This implies that there should be connection between EC adsorption and catalyst performance. Introduction of optimal amount of MoOx is beneficial to strengthen the EC adsorption on the surface of Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 and to further enhance the MeOH yield. However, too much MoOx resulted in too strong EC adsorption so that desorption of EC from the catalyst surface was too difficult. Moreover, the mechanism of EC hydrogenation to MeOH and EG is still not clear with the Cu-based catalysts up to now. Therefore, in situ FTIR spectroscopy of EC hydrogenation on Cu/SiO2 and Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 was performed (Fig. 9 ). For both catalysts, two main bands were detected at 1805 cm−1 and 1775 cm−1 and seven peaks in the region of 1260–1700 cm−1 and 2750–3000 cm−1 were observed as well. As discussed above, the bands at 1805 cm−1 and 1775 cm−1 are attributed to the CO stretching vibration of EC molecules, whereas those at 1390 and 1480 cm−1 are assigned to δCH2 and δCH2(sc) [23,25]. When recalling the IR spectra of EC adsorbed on Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 in flowing N2 at 180 °C (Figure S4), the CO vibration band intensity almost remained unchanged with time in flowing N2. In contrast, the intensities of CO, δCH2 and δCH2(sc) of EC adsorbed on Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 gradually declined when H2 flow was introduced and these bands completely disappeared after a proper period. This indicates that the gradual weakening of the CO bond was caused by consumption of EC with hydrogen, rather than gradual desorption of EC. Meanwhile, some new broad bands appeared, which are highly consistent with the vibration bands of EG and MeOH (at 1416, 1451, 2885 and 2939 cm−1), proving that the hydrogenation of EC to MeOH and EG indeed occurs on the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalyst surface. Nevertheless, the CO band totally disappeared on the Cu/SiO2 catalyst after 100 min, while it disappeared on the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst after 60 min (Fig. 9(b)) and on the Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 catalyst after 70 min (Figure S5), respectively. This indicates that on the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst, the hydrogenation of CO bond was the fastest, in good agreement with the observed overall catalytic behaviors (Table 2). According to the characterization results discussed above, the strong interaction at the interface of Cu and MoOx species altered the adsorption and activation of EC, thus significantly improving catalytic performance. Besides, the CO bond in the EC molecules may be polarized and activated by the MoOx species and thus higher catalytic performance could be furnished with MoOx doped Cu/SiO2 catalysts. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the case of the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol with the Mo-Ir/TUD-1 catalyst, where MoOx activated the CO bond and Ir-Mo interfacial sites accelerated the reaction rate [31]."
9,Discussion of the structure-activity relationship,"3.5 Discussion of the structure-activity relationship Based on the results obtained above, introduction of MoOx enhanced the dispersion of Cu and increased Scu 0. According to the detailed characterization results discussed above, MoOx modification not only influenced the physicochemical properties of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, but also altered the electronic properties of Cu and Mo species owing to their strong interaction. When recalling the catalytic performance, the catalytic behaviors (such as intrinsic catalytic activities and MeOH selectivity) of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts are sensitively dependent on the MoOx content. Obviously, the appropriate Mo/Cu molar ratio of 0.0005 for the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst is required for the highest MeOH selectivity and the highest initial reaction rate (Table S2). In order to gain more insights into the structure-activity relationship, we normalized the TOF values as a function of metallic copper surface area (SCu 0) (Fig. 10 (a)). However, there is no simple correlation between the TOF values and SCu 0, because the TOF value increased clearly from 9.2 h−1 to the maximum 17.5 h−1 with the increase of SCu 0 from 54.7 to 56.2 m2·g−1 and then decreased to 8.9 h−1 by further increasing the SCu 0 to 63.8 m2·g−1. When SCu 0 further increased to 68.8 m2·g−1, the TOF slightly increased to 9.7 h−1. This finding indicates that the hydrogenation of EC to MeOH and EG is not merely related to SCu 0. However, as shown in Fig. 10(b), both the TOF values and the MeOH selectivity displayed similar volcano-like curves with the Cu+/(Cu++Cu0) ratios. The TOF value enhanced obviously from 9.2 h−1 (43.2%) to the maximum of 17.5 h−1 (47.2%) and then declined steadily to 8.9 h−1 (74.9%) with further increasing Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) ratio in the catalyst to 74.9%. Similarly, the selectivity of MeOH increased initially and then decreased with increasing the Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) ratio. The highest TOF and the highest MeOH selectivity were furnished with the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst. As is well known, the two-site mechanism usually proposes that the Cu0 species activate H2, while the Cu+ species adsorb and activate the carbonyl group. Therefore, the relationship described in Fig. 10(b) demonstrates the Cu-based catalyst with appropriate surface Cu+/(Cu++Cu0) ratio is beneficial to enhance the MeOH selectivity on the MoOx modified Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Considering the high selectivity of MeOH, the relatively high ratio of Cu+ sites and Cu-MoOx interface were favorable to adsorb and activate the OCO group of EC, thus accelerating the reaction as confirmed by the markedly reduced Ea value. Moreover, the chemical environment of Cu+ species in the MoOx-promoted Cu/SiO2 catalysts has been altered according to the in situ CO-FTIR results, which may be more beneficial for the adsorption and activation of EC so that higher performance was obtained with the MoOx-promoted Cu/SiO2 catalysts. More importantly, when recalling the catalyst stability, the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst showed better stability during 150 h time on stream. According to the characterization results, a large amount of copper phyllosilicates would result in higher dispersion of Cu particles. Additionally, the greatly improved catalytic stability may be also attributed to the stabilizing effect of the copper nanoparticles at the Cu-MoOx interfacial sites. In addition, such an ascending MeOH selectivity trend is also consistent with the increasing acid strength of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. The Cu+ species act as strong Lewis acid sites to polarize the CO/CO groups and thus facilitate EC activation. This implies that a relatively stronger Lewis acid strength in the weak and medium acidity region is favorable for MeOH formation. Similar phenomena were also reported on the Cu/SiO2 catalyst [23]. On the basis of the above detailed analysis and discussion, the superior catalytic performance of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts in the low H2/EC ratio vapor-phase hydrogenation of EC to MeOH and EG are not only attributed to the increased Cu dispersion, SCu 0 and enhanced EC activation ability, but also closely related to the appropriate surface Cu+/(Cu++Cu0) distribution and interface effects of Cu and MoOx species. According to the findings at hand, the possible structure models of the Cu/SiO2, Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 and Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 catalysts and the corresponding EC adsorption and hydrogenation mechanisms are illustrated in Scheme 2 . The surface Cu0 species dissociatively adsorb H2 and Lewis acidic Cu+ sites adsorb and polarize the O atoms in the carbonyl groups. On the Cu/SiO2 catalyst modified with optimal MoOx amount, the Cu-MoOx interfacial sites are beneficial to strengthen the EC adsorption and to reduce the activation energy, and thus accelerate the reaction. For the Cu-3.75MoOx/SiO2 catalyst, it had too strong adsorption of EC, and excessively high MoOx loading inevitably covering the copper species so that some Cu sites cannot be accessible, resulting in low activity."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we prepared MoOx-promoted Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts via a one-pot modified hydrothermal method and then applied to the vapor-phase hydrogenation of EC to yield MeOH and EG. The Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts had stable Cu+ species originating from copper phyllosilicate precursors. The EC conversion and MeOH selectivity depended sensitively on the Mo/Cu molar ratios in the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts. As a result, the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic performance, displaying 89% MeOH yield and 99% EG yield within 150 h time-on-stream test at a H2/EC ratio of 20 and at a WLHSVEC of 0.64. The kinetic studies indicated that the Cu-0.02MoOx/SiO2 catalyst had lower activation energy (72.9 kJ· mol−1) than Cu/SiO2 (109.0 kJ· mol−1). According to the characterization results, the modification of Cu by MoOx not only influenced the physicochemical properties of the Cu-mMoOx/SiO2 catalysts, but also altered the electronic properties of both Cu and Mo species. Such modification created the interfacial sites with possible Cu-O-Mo bond via the strong interaction between Cu and MoOx species, which correspondingly changed the adsorption and activation of EC with remarkably enhanced MeOH selectivity. In particular, strong interaction between Cu particles and MoOx at Cu-MoOx interfaces can stabilize the copper nanoparticles and resist sintering, resulting in better catalyst stability during long-term investigations. In addition, MoOx introduction had obvious effect on the strength and quantity of the surface acid sites. Stronger medium Lewis acid sites of the Mo-promoted catalyst were also helpful for MeOH formation."
