0,Introduction,"Morocco possesses 75% of the world’s phosphate reserves. It is the world’s first exporter (28% of the global market) and third producer (20% of global production). Although phosphates are mainly used in the industry of fertilizers, they have been successfully utilized as catalysts (either alone or conveniently modified) in a wide range of organic reactions [1]. Some examples include Michael-addition [2], Knoevenagel [3] and Claysen–Schmidt [4,5] condensations, Diels–Alder reaction [6], Beckmann rearrangement [7,8] or transesterifications [9]. More recently, we described the use of natural phosphates as a support for a photocatalytic active phase [10]. However, there is an interesting research field for which natural phosphates are rather unexplored: catalytic hydrogenations. In this sense, one of the most important processes to be considered is selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds. Chemoselective reduction of the CO group in the presence of the CC bond is a challenge, since it is thermodynamically unfavoured [11]. Moreover, it leads to unsaturated alcohols, widely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and fragrances. This makes the selected reaction interesting for both Industry and Academia. There are two main approaches to the reaction using heterogeneous catalysis: (i) reduction of the CO bond through hydrogen transfer from an alcohol (the so-called Meeewein–Ponndorf–Verley process) [12] or (ii) reduction by hydrogen gas on supported metal systems [13]. This work focuses on the latter case. There are several examples in the literature on the use of monometallic catalysts (Pd, Ni, Pt, Rh, Au) [14–17] to carry out this reaction, platinum being the most widely used system [13,18]. In addition to the active metal, activity and selectivity to the process are influenced by some other features such as the metal precursor [19,20], solvent [21–24] or the metal particle size [21,25]. The catalytic activity and selectivity can also be affected by introducing modifiers onto the catalyst or into the reaction mixture. In the former case, modifiers are adsorbed, whereas in the latter one they can be dissolved in the liquid phase. The adsorbed modifiers can be solid acids, sulphur compounds or alkali metal and transition metal oxides. The dissolved promoters are typically inorganic bases and salts. Therefore, for instance, Yu et al. [26] used metal salts as promoters in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over polymer-stabilized platinum colloid. In the absence of metal salt, this catalyst gave 12% selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol at 37.5% conversion in ethanol at 40bar of hydrogen and 60°C. When Zn2+ cations were added into the reaction mixture with the same catalyst and reaction conditions, the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol was 99.8%. The final conversion was, however, only 13% indicating that Zn2+ acts as a catalyst poison. Replacement of Zn2+ by Fe3+ resulted in higher conversions of cinnamaldehyde (83%) and selectivities to cinnamyl alcohol (98.5%). The present piece of research is aimed at exploring the possibility of widening the scope of applications of natural phosphate through the incorporation platinum. Resulting systems were tested for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol (or 2-butenol). Finally, the effect of the addition of several metal chlorides to the reaction media on catalytic performance is discussed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of platinum systems,"2.1 Synthesis of platinum systems Two different methods were used to incorporate platinum onto natural phosphate (NP): deposition–precipitation method and impregnation. 2.1.1 Deposition–precipitation method The synthetic procedure was as follows: an appropriate volume of hexachloroplatinic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich Ref. 262587) was diluted to 200mL with Milli-Q water and adjusted to pH 7 by adding 0.1M NaOH (FLUKA Ref. 43617). Then, an amount of 4.75g of support was added and the mixture readjusted to pH 7 with HCl. The solution containing the support was refluxed at 80°C under vigorous stirring for 2h. Then, a volume of 10mL of isopropanol was added, the temperature raised to 110°C and refluxing continued for 30min, after which the mixture was vacuum filtered and the filtrate washed with three portions of 25mL of water each. The resulting solid was dried in a muffle furnace at 110°C for 12h, ground and calcined at 400°C for 4h. After calcination, the solid was ground again, sieved through a mesh of 0.149mm pore size and stored in a topaz flask. This method was used to obtain two catalysts with a nominal content of 3% and 5% by weight, respectively. 2.1.2 Impregnation method In this case, the appropriate amount of platinum (II) acetylacetonate (Aldrich Ref. 282782) was dissolved in 50mL acetone and added to the support. The solvent was then rotaevaporated. The resulting solid was dried in a muffle furnace at 110°C for 12h, ground and calcined at 400°C for 4h. After calcination, the solid was ground again, sieved through a mesh of 0.149mm pore size and stored in a topaz flask. In a similar way as for deposition–precipitation method, two different catalysts with a nominal content of 3% and 5% by weight, respectively, were obtained. The catalyst nomenclature includes a subscript referring to the synthetic method (‘i’ or ‘d’ for impregnation or deposition–precipitation, respectively), a number indicating the platinum nominal content (3 or 5%) and when applicable a suffix referring to the activation temperature. Therefore, for instance, Pti3/NP-400 is the catalyst obtained by the impregnation method with a 3% platinum nominal content and activated at 400°C. Hereinafter, we will refer to ‘i’ or ‘d’ series to indicate the solids obtained through impregnation or deposition–precipitation methods, respectively."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Determination of platinum content in the samples was performed by the staff at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS). Measurements were taken on a Perkin–Elmer ELAN DRC-e instrument following dissolution of the sample in a 1:1:1 H2SO4/HF/H2O mixture. Calibration was done by using PE Pure Plus atomic spectroscopy standards, also from Perkin–Elmer. EDX measurements were taken with a JEOL JSM-6300 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on 4mm×4mm pellets 0.5mm thick that were obtained by gently pressing the powdered materials following outgassing to a pressure below about 2×10−8 Torr at 150°C in the instrument pre-chamber to remove chemisorbed volatile species. The main chamber of the Leibold–Heraeus LHS10 spectrometer used, capable of operating down to less than 2×10−9 Torr, was equipped with an EA-200MCD hemispherical electron analyser with a dual X-ray source using AlKα (hv=1486.6eV) at 120W, at 30mA, with C(1s) as energy reference (284.6eV). This equipment was available at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained at the SCAI of the University of Córdoba by using a Philips CM-10 microscope. All samples were mounted on 3mm holey carbon copper grids. X-ray patterns for the samples were obtained with a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer equipped with a DACO-MP automatic control and data acquisition system. The instrument was used with Co Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator. The metal properties of the catalysts, viz mean metal particle size (d MET), metal surface area (S MET) and metal dispersion (D), were determined by hydrogen chemisorption at 20°C on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 analyser, using the pulse method, with a H2/Ar (10/90 v/v) flow of 40mL/min and a catalyst loading of 200mg."
4,Liquid-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"2.3 Liquid-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde The liquid-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde with molecular hydrogen was conducted on a Parr Instruments 3911 low-pressure reactor, using a constant rate of 300 shakes min−1. The reaction vessel (500mL in volume) was wrapped in a metal jacket through which thermostated water was circulated. The apparatus was equipped with a gauge that recorded the pressure inside the reaction vessel throughout the experiment. All reactions were performed with an overall liquid volume of 20mL containing 0.5M crotonaldehyde in a 1,4-dioxane/water (1:1 v/v) mixture, using an initial pressure of 0.414MPa and a temperature of 30°C. Prior to each run, an amount of 100mg of calcined Pt catalyst was reduced in a hydrogen stream flowing at 30mL/min at the selected temperature for 2h and then cooled in the same stream. Finally, a N2 flow was passed through the sample for 1h. For experiments performed on as-synthesized solids, catalysts were just pretreated at 120°C in a N2 flow for 1h. The standard operational procedure used in each experiment was as follows: the reaction vessel was loaded with 20mL of 0.5M crotonaldehyde, sonicated for 15min and 100mg of pretreated catalyst were added. The reaction vessel was then attached to the reactor, and once the temperature levelled off at 30°C – which took about 10min – the vessel was evacuated and filled with hydrogen to a pressure of 0.414MPa twice. After 15min, the pressure was readjusted, the shaking device started and the reaction timed. Blank tests intended to ascertain that no reaction would take place thermally in the absence of catalyst were conducted with a reaction mixture consisting solely of substrate and solvent. No signs of reaction were detected after 8h under these conditions. Reaction products were analysed on a Agilent Instrument 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Supelcowax-10 column (30m long×0.25mm ID, 0.25μm film thickness). A calibration plot for each product was constructed from commercially available standards. The products of the reduction of crotonaldehyde (designated ‘unsaturated aldehyde’, UAL) were crotyl alcohol (‘unsaturated alcohol’, UOL), 1-butanol (‘saturated alcohol’, SOL) and butanol (‘saturated aldehyde’, SAL). Crotonaldehyde conversion (XUAL) was calculated as ( C UAL 0 - C UAL ) / C UAL 0 , where C UAL 0 is the initial concentration of crotonaldehyde and C UAL that at reaction time t. The selectivity of each reaction product was calculated as% Seli = C i/ΣC i ×100. Crotonaldehyde and crotyl alcohol were quantified as the sum of both isomers (Z + E). In all the cases, the E isomer was the major one."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Support composition,"3.1 Support composition Natural phosphate (NP) came from an extracted ore in the region of Khouribga (Morocco). The fraction of 100–400μm grain size was washed with water, calcined at 900°C for 2h, washed again, calcined at 900°C for 0.5h and ground (63–125μm). Table 1 shows the results of SEM–EDX analyses of three samples termed as NP1, NP2 and NP3 corresponding to three different years. All of them had a BET surface area of ca. 3m2/g. As can be seen, chemical analyses are quite similar thus evidencing that natural phosphates are quite reliable as supports in terms of reproducibility of its chemical composition. Therefore, the catalysts synthesized in the present work used NP2 as the support (just termed as NP). The structure of NP is similar to that of carbonate hydroxyfluorapatite as shown by X-ray diffraction pattern and chemical analysis."
7,Analyses of platinum content in the samples,"3.2 Analyses of platinum content in the samples Results obtained for bulk (ICP–MS) and surface (XPS and SEM–EDX) platinum content of the catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . As can be seen, ICP–MS results evidence that impregnation method led to a better incorporation of platinum as compared to deposition–precipitation method. Moreover, platinum is mainly present in the catalyst surface of impregnated solids (XPS values are higher than those determined by ICP–MS), whereas the opposite holds true for the systems obtained by deposition–precipitation."
8,Preliminary screening of catalyst for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol,"3.3 Preliminary screening of catalyst for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol Once synthesized, the solids were tested for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonadehyde to crotyl alcohol. In principle, all the solids were used both as synthesized and after pre-reduction at 400°C, typical activation temperature for platinum-containing systems. Results are summarized in Fig. 1 . Interestingly, the pre-activation of the solids in hydrogen flow led to lower conversions than the use of the system as synthesized. Moreover, results achieved with impregnation series are much better than those obtained with deposition–precipitation one. Therefore, selectivity to crotyl alcohol is very low in deposition–precipitation solids used as synthesized and close to null for those activated at 400°C. If all d-series solids are considered, the best results correspond to Ptd5/NP with 18% conversion and 7% selectivity to crotyl alcohol after 8h. In contrast, results for i-series solids are much better both in terms of conversion and selectivity. Conversion is higher for non-reduced solids, whereas better selectivities to crotyl alcohol are achieved through pre-reduction of the systems at 400°C under hydrogen flow. This is especially remarkable for Pti3 systems. Therefore, selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases from 28% up to 39% when Pti3/NP is pre-reduced at 400°C, though that increase in selectivity is produced at the expense of conversion, which drops from 80% for Pti3/NP (the highest among all tested solids) to 39% for Pti3/NP-400. All in all, this screening of conditions allowed us to select Pti3 systems for further studies since they looked the most promising solids. In this sense, one of the first questions to answer is the reason for the so-different catalytic performance of impregnated systems as compared to deposition–precipitation ones. To cast further light on that, we performed XRD, TEM, H2 chemisorption and XPS analyses. X-ray diffractograms of the solids obtained by deposition–precipitation and impregnation methods are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. In all cases, for the sake of comparison, the diffractogram of natural phosphate is included together with that of the solids as synthesized and pre-reduced at 400°C. The main peaks of natural phosphate appear at 37.4° and 38.8° corresponding to (211) and (300) reflections, respectively [27]. Moreover, despite the fact that the peak corresponding to Pt0 at ca. 2θ =46.8° (see vertical line) overlaps with two other peaks at 46.2° and 47.0° for (211) and (310) reflections, three main conclusions can be drawn from Figs. 2 and 3. First, in all cases, activation of the solids at 400°C resulted in a narrowing of platinum peaks and increase in its intensity, which is consistent with the expected increase in platinum particle size with temperature. Second, assuming similar dispersions for the same platinum nominal content, the greater peaks for Pti3 as compared to Ptd3 systems seem to suggest a better incorporation of the metal by impregnation. This is consistent with ICP–MS data (see Table 2, Pt% being 1.9 and 1.2% for Pti3/NP and Ptd3/NP, respectively). On the other hand, the intensity of XRD peaks for Pti5 and Ptd5 systems with very close platinum contents (4.2% and 4.0%, respectively, see Table 2) is more similar. Third, it is interesting to note that Pt0 is already present in all as-synthesized systems but Ptd3 (especially evident for impregnated solids in Fig. 3). This constitutes a difference for both synthetic methods and could be related to the different catalytic behaviour shown in Fig. 1. In order to cast further light on the dispersion of platinum in the systems, TEM and H2 chemisorption techniques were used. Regarding TEM, unfortunately, natural phosphates are not a good support for this technique. Therefore, the black regions in the images in Fig. 4 cannot be directly ascribed to platinum since the pictures of the support alone are very similar. As for H2 chemisorption, results for impregnated solids are given in Table 3 . As can be seen reduction of Pti3/NP system at 400°C led to a sintering of metal particles thus reducing the dispersion. However, for Pti5/NP solid, the same treatment seems to have led to the disgregation of the particles resulting in an increase in the metal dispersion. This is very surprising and is not consistent with XRD results, which evidenced that, as expected, the reduction of the systems at 400°C resulted in a decrease in dispersion. This anomalous chemisorption result for Pti5/NP could be attributed to the fact that dispersion is so low that the assumed H/Pt 1:1 stoichiometry is no longer valid for this system with such a high platinum nominal content (5% by weight) and very low surface area of the support (ca. 3m2/g). Therefore, neither TEM nor H2 chemisorption allowed us to determine the metal particle size of the systems. In order to look for a correlation between the structure of solids and its catalytic performance, a surface technique was used: XPS."
9,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Results obtained for XPS analyses of the solids are summarized in Table 4 and shown in Figs. S1–S11 (see Supplementary information). Selected signals were Ca2p, P2p, O1s, F1s, C1s and Pt4f. Natural phosphate (Figs. S1 or S6) exhibits a typical P2p3/2 peak at 133.4eV, which is ascribed to phosphate group in apatites [10,27–30], whereas O1s (Table 4, 4th row) has two components at 530.9 and 531.8eV attributed to PO 4 3 - +OH− and O2−, respectively [30]. The binding energy of Ca2p3/2 (ca. 347.3eV, Figs. S2 or S7 and 5th row in Table 4) is also consistent with that reported in the literature for apatites [27,30–31]. Interestingly, surface Ca/P ratio in NP is 2.3, which confirms the existence of carbonate species in the apatite structure since, otherwise, a fluor(hydroxy)apatite, with a formula Ca10(PO4)6F2− x (OH) x should have a Ca/P ratio close to 1.7. The presence of carbonate is confirmed by the C1s peak at ca. 289eV [32] (Figs. S5 or S10 and Table 4). The determination of the nature and oxidation state of Pt species (Pt0, Pt2+ and Pt4+) is normally accomplished using XPS technique and in particular by means of the Pt(4f) peak study. It is known that metallic Pt0 has binding energies of 70.7–70.9 and 74.0–74.1eV for 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 electrons, respectively [33,34]. In oxidized states, Pt2+ and Pt4+ exhibit much higher binding energies: 72.8–73.1eV (4f7/2) and 76.3–76.4eV (4f5/2) for Pt2+ and 74.6–74.9eV (4f7/2) and 78.1–78.2eV (4f5/2) for Pt4+ [34–37]. The incorporation of platinum on natural phosphate has a different effect on the surface properties of the solids depending on the synthesis method. Therefore, beginning with XPS spectra of d-series solids, whose interpretation is easier, there is no change in P, Ca, F, O and C peaks on the addition of platinum (Table 4 and Figs. S1–S5). Moreover, Ptd3/NP solid exhibits Pt2+ and Pt4+ species, whereas reduction in the solid at 400°C results in the appearance of Pt0 (consistent with XRD results) and Pt2+. In the case of Ptd5/NP system, with a higher platinum content, Pt0 is already present in as-synthesized solid (together with Pt2+ and Pt4+) and all three oxidation states remain after reduction at 400°C, though as expected, Pt0 relative percentage increases on the reductive treatment from 58% up to 74% (see Table 4). Finally, for both Ptd3 and Ptd5 systems, surface Pt content does not change with the reduction treatment. Interpretation of XPS results for platinum-impregnated systems is much more complicated. Therefore, the incorporation of platinum led to the appearance of new peaks of P, O, Ca, F and C at lower binding energies (Table 4 and Figs. S6–S10). Moreover, the relative intensity of those peaks decreased on the reduction of the systems at 400°C though such a thermal treatment resulted in a shift of the signals to lower binding energies. More surprisingly, a platinum species with a Pt4f value of ca. 67eV appeared in these solids. Such a low binding energy value is not described in the literature and would represent a quite negatively charged platinum species. We also thought of the possibility of a shift in the signals but a correction of platinum binding values to have the lowest values close to 70eV (typical values for Pt0) would result in very high binding energies for other elements (P2p, F1s…) neither described in the literature. The possibility of the low binding energies platinum signals corresponding to Pt5p was also ruled out since the relative intensities of the peaks do not match (Fig. S11). In any case, the appearance of new surface interactions in the impregnated solids is evident, which must be somehow related to the synthetic method. It is possible that the carbon coming from the platinum precursor (acetylacetonate) led on calcination at 400°C to any kind of graphite species whose interaction with platinum and natural phosphate is to account for the different behaviour of impregnated solids. It is important to point out that platinum precursor in deposition–precipitation solids was chloroplatinic acid, thus not resulting in the presence of carbon from the precursor in the solids. In fact, having a look at Table 4, the greater carbon content in i-series solids as compared to d-series ones is evident which together with the appearance of carbon peaks at C1s ca. 281eV would be consistent with our hypothesis. As for the reason for the slightly better catalytic performance of Pti3/NP solid as compared to Pti5/NP system, it is probably a consequence of the different platinum dispersions. Unfortunately, the two methods we had to determine platinum particle size (TEM and H2 chemisorption) were not very conclusive. All in all, the above-mentioned results have evidenced that unlike Ptdx systems, Ptix solids exhibit some new surface interactions, which somehow are beneficial to catalytic performance of the solids. Furthermore, Pti3/NP solid is the one exhibiting higher crotyl alcohol yields among the tested systems."
10,Effect of the addition of several metal chlorides on catalytic performance of Pti3/NP,"3.5 Effect of the addition of several metal chlorides on catalytic performance of Pti3/NP Finally, several reactions were carried out in the presence of different metal chlorides in a Pt/Metal atomic ratio of 1:1. Selected chlorides were FeCl2, FeCl3, CoCl2, ZnCl2 and NiCl2. Results are depicted in Fig. 5 . Interestingly, addition of NiCl2 resulted in the higher conversion values (68% for t =8h) though the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (2-butenol) was very low (2%). If both conversion and selectivities are considered, FeCl2 was the system exhibiting the better results, with a 19.3% yield. Therefore, this chloride was selected for further studies on the effect of the Pt/metal ratio on catalytic results. As can be seen in Fig. 6 , there is an optimum for selectivity to 2-butenol for a Fe/Pt ratio of 0.5 resulting in a 70% selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol. All in all, the addition of ferrous chloride to the reaction medium has resulted in a slight increase in the 2-butenol yield (from 22.4% to 23.7%). More interestingly, selectivity has increased from 30% up to 70%."
11,Conclusions,"Selective reduction of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol was conducted on platinum systems supported on natural phosphate. Two different methods were used for the incorporation of platinum: impregnation (i-series) and deposition–precipitation (d-series). The systems belonging to i-series were intrinsically more active and selective than those of d-series. XPS technique showed the existence of new surface interactions in the former case as evidenced by the appearance of new peaks of P, O, Ca, F and C at lower binding energies. This could account for the different catalytic performance of the systems. The most active system (Pti3/NP) was selected for further studies on the effect of the addition of metal chlorides to the reaction medium. Therefore, the addition of ferrous chloride in a Pt/Fe atomic radio of 0.5 resulted in a slight increase in 2-butenol yield (from 22.4% to 23.7%) accompanied by a significant increase in selectivity (from 30% up to 70%). All in all, the present study has evidenced that natural phosphates can be used as supports for metals in order to be applied in hydrogenation reactions, thus widening the scope of this important natural resource to Moroccan economy."
