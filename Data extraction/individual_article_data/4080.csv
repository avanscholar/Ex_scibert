0,Introduction,"Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) via syngas derived from natural gas, coal or biomass has attracted much attention due to higher alcohols' potential as fuels, fuel additives and intermediates for value-added chemicals [1–3]. Alkali-promoted methanol catalysts, Cu-modified Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts, Rh-based catalysts, and Mo-based catalysts [1,4–8] have all been reported for HAS. Among them, Cu-modified F–T catalysts are considered to be the most promising systems [3]. However, the existing technology of HAS is still on a small scale due to the relatively low selectivity to C2+ alcohols. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new HAS catalyst with high activity and selectivity based on deep understanding of the nature of HAS process. Many reactions are involved in parallel or sequence in HAS. A great deal of effort has been made to reveal the mechanism [1,4,9–12], however, many factors still remain unclear. It is generally accepted that HAS requires both dissociative and non-dissociative activation of CO by different active sites. In recent years, Cu–Co [13–16] and Cu–Fe [17–20] based catalysts have been extensively studied, however, these supported catalysts make it difficult to elucidate the intrinsic function of active metals due to ubiquitous support effects [21]. Obviously, structurally “simple” catalysts would be more amenable for further mechanistic investigations. Recently, Spivey's group synthesized two sets of Co–Cu nanoparticles by wet chemical methods with novel structures for HAS [22]. An appropriate balance between CO dissociation and CO insertion was suggested to be necessary for the synthesis of higher alcohols. In the present work, unsupported CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared and tested as model catalysts for HAS, and their performances were also compared with that of monometallic Fe nanoparticles and physical mixture (PM) of Fe and Cu nanoparticles. The selectivity to total alcohols especially to high molecular alcohols (C6+OH) was studied. The high selectivity to C6+OH was discussed according to the existing form of the Cu and Fe components and the active site for alcohol formation."
1,Experimental,"The CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared by simultaneous reduction of cupric and ferric nitrates with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in ethylene glycol (EG) under Ar atmosphere. Four types of CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles with theoretical Cu/Fe molar ratios of 10.00, 3.00, 0.33 and 0.10 were prepared. The bulk compositions by ICP (9.57, 3.43, 0.34 and 0.11 respectively) were in good agreement with the theoretical ones. Thus in this paper, each CuFe bimetallic sample was denoted as xCuyFe, where x/y was the theoretical molar ratio. CO hydrogenation tests were performed in a stainless steel continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 6MPa with GHSV of 6000mL/(gcat.·h). Prior to each reaction, the catalyst was pre-activated by syngas at atmospheric pressure with GHSV of 3600mL/(gcat.·h). More details are given in Supporting information."

3,Structural properties of CuFe nanoparticles,"3.1 Structural properties of CuFe nanoparticles The TEM/HRTEM, XRD, TPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy (MES) were conducted to elucidate the structural properties of the obtained nanoparticles (see Supporting information for experimental details). TEM images of CuFe, Cu and Fe nanoparticles were shown in Fig. 1 . CuFe and Cu nanoparticles were spherical with diameters ranging from 15 to 20nm, while Fe nanoparticles formed large agglomerates. All CuFe nanoparticles aggregated severely due to no capping agent used during preparation. Both Cu and Fe elements were detected for all CuFe nanoparticles by EDS (inset in each TEM image) within 25nm diameter area. The result indicates that the Cu and Fe components co-exist in sole nanoparticle, indicating that bimetallic CuFe nanoparticles, rather than physical mixtures of monometallic Cu and Fe nanoparticles, were successfully synthesized by the co-reduction method. HRTEM results of 1Cu3Fe further confirmed the bimetallic nature of the obtained CuFe nanoparticles. Due to rapid reduction of precursors, the nanoparticles were not well crystallized, however, the lattice spaces of 0.21nm and 0.25nm were found by HRTEM as shown in Fig. 2 . According to XRD results (Fig. S1 in Supporting information), the lattice space of 0.21nm corresponds to Cu(111) or FeCu4(111) and the lattice space of 0.25nm corresponds to CuFe2O4(311), indicating that Cu and Fe components co-exist in sole particle. Two typical types of nanoparticles were found in 1Cu3Fe, one shows only 0.21nm lattice space (Fig. 2a) and the other shows both 0.21nm and 0.25nm lattice spaces (Fig. 2b). This result indicates that in fresh 1Cu3Fe sample, Cu and Fe components contact with each other in three possible forms, Cu–Fe alloy, CuFe2O4 spinel, and Cu(Fe)–CuFe2O4 metal-oxide interface. After pre-activation by syngas, only Cu and Fe3O4 phases existed in bulk for 1Cu3Fe as shown by the XRD patterns (Fig. S2), suggesting that CuFe2O4 was converted to Cu/Fe3O4 composite [23] in accord with TPR result (Fig. S3). During pre-activation process, carburization of Fe and Fe3O4 to iron carbides (FeC x ) by CO and oxidation of Fe and FeC x to Fe3O4 by water vapor could occur. As a result, Cu–Fe alloy would decompose to Cu/Fe3O4 or Cu/FeC x composites. Since FeC x was not detected by XRD, MES was conducted to confirm the formation of FeC x . As shown in Fig. S4 and Table 1 , about 23.3% of χ-Fe5C2 was detected by MES in the activated 1Cu3Fe. According to the results by Iglesia and co-workers, the carbide was likely on the surface of Fe3O4 particles [24]. The results indicate that after activation, Cu and Fe components contact each other in two possible forms, Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/χ-Fe5C2 composites, which differed from fresh samples."
4,Catalytic performance in HAS,"3.2 Catalytic performance in HAS The catalytic results of CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles are listed in Table 2 . All CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles showed above 20% CO conversion and a total alcohol selectivity of 18.5–26.2 C%. The C2+ alcohols (C2+OH) in alcohol distribution was very high (95.7wt.% for 1Cu3Fe). Many CuFe-based HAS catalysts were reported in open literatures, however, such a high C2+OH selectivity seems rare. It should be noted that high molecular alcohols (C6+OH) in alcohol distribution were also very high, all above 50wt.% except 1Cu10Fe. Such high C6+OH selectivity is completely different from the previously reported CuFe-based HAS catalysts [17,25] which produced few C6+OH. The underlying reason is being investigated in our group. Direct synthesis of C6+OH from syngas was seldom reported. Only recently Ding and co-workers reported the direct synthesis of C1–C18 linear primary alcohols from syngas on active carbon supported cobalt based catalysts [26]. As C6+OH are intermediates for many value-added fine chemicals, direct production of C6+OH from syngas seems attractive. Our results suggest that the unsupported CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles are promising HAS catalyst candidates for C6+OH production. Compared with Fe nanoparticles and PM (Cu/Fe=1/3 atomic), CuFe samples showed comparable CO conversions and similar product distributions, but higher selectivity to total alcohols. In addition, all catalysts showed low methane and high C5+ in hydrocarbon distribution (Table 2)."
5,Discussion,"Fe-based FT catalysts could produce a fraction of alcohols in products, but the selectivity is not high. On addition of Cu, the alcohol selectivity increased, indicating that Cu plays an important role in alcohol production. However, PM showed similar performance as Fe (Table 2), suggesting that blending of Cu nanoparticles physically to Fe nanoparticles had little influence. Since Cu and Fe components co-exist in sole nanoparticle in CuFe, but no such co-existence presented in PM, the result indicates that intimate contact of Cu and Fe favors alcohol formation. Generally, on Cu-modified F–T catalysts, the Cu–M (M=F–T element) center is thought to be the active site (dual site) for alcohol synthesis [1,3,27], on which Cu functioning as CO molecular activation and insertion site while M functioning as CO dissociative activation and chain propagation site, the synergistic effect between Cu and M is key to alcohol formation. On Fe-based F–T catalysts, FeC x was found to the active site for CO dissociation and carbon chain propagation [28,29]. Thus, Cu–FeC x center, which was generated on CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles as mentioned in Section 3.1, could function as the dual site for alcohol formation. On Cu–FeC x center, CO dissociatively adsorbs on FeC x site, which is hydrogenated to form surface CH z monomer and initiates carbon chain propagation to form surface alkyl species, while CO associatively adsorbs on Cu site [30]. The surface alkyl species on FeC x migrate to adjacent Cu site, and the CO molecularly adsorbing on Cu site inserts into metal–alkyl bond to form surface acyl species. Further hydrogenation of acyl species produces alcohols. The alcohols formed on Cu–FeC x center might account for the higher total alcohol selectivity on CuFe than on Fe and PM. Co-existence in sole nanoparticle of Cu and Fe species seems a prerequisite for Cu–FeC x center formation. According to this mechanism, alcohols and hydrocarbons derived from the same surface alkyl intermediates, so higher C2+OH and C6+OH would coincide with higher C5+ selectivity. This was found to be the case as shown in Fig. 3 . Since carbon chain propagates on FeC x site, the long-chain product selectivity depends on the nature of FeC x site. It has been found that both the size [31–34] and the morphology [35] of FeC x crystallite affect the CO hydrogenation properties, and chain growth ability increases with the crystallite size within 11nm [32,33]. To obtain high chain growth ability with high activity, a crystallite size of FeC x at around 6nm seems appropriate [33]. In our study, the observed high C2+OH and C6+OH selectivity might result from the good chain propagation ability of FeC x site which was also confirmed by the high C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity. Though the C2+OH and C6+OH selectivity was more affected by the nature of FeC x site, the total alcohol selectivity was affected by Cu–FeC x interaction since CO insertion occurs on Cu site which needs the synergism between Cu and FeC x . Thus, in order to increase the total alcohol selectivity, it is needed to increase the surface concentration of Cu–FeC x center. However, in order to increase the C2+OH and C6+OH selectivity, it is necessary to tune the nature of FeC x site such as the size of crystallite."
6,Conclusion,"In conclusion, CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles showed good alcohol selectivity and very high C6+OH in alcohol distribution, suggesting that CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles are promising catalyst candidates for direct C6+OH synthesis from syngas. Cu and Fe species contact with each other in forms of Cu–Fe alloy, CuFe2O4 and Cu(Fe)–CuFe2O4 interface in fresh CuFe, while in the forms of Cu–Fe3O4 and Cu–FeC x in activated samples. As Cu–FeC x center benefits alcohol formation, CuFe showed higher total alcohol selectivity than Fe and PM. In addition, total alcohol selectivity is more affected by Cu–FeC x synergism, while C2+OH and C6+OH selectivity was more affected by the nature of FeC x site."
