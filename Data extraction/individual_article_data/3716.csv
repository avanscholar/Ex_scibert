0,Introduction,"Aqueous foam is a gas-liquid dispersion system in which gas is separated by liquid film to form many small bubbles. It is broadly used in many engineering applications, such as oil recovery, mineral flotation, and fire fighting [1–4]. In coal mines, aqueous foam also plays an important role in fire control and dust suppression [5,6]. Mine fires caused by the spontaneous combustion of coal have destroyed a large quantity of coal resources and have led to accidents. Many fire-fighting materials have been invented, such as melamine-phenol-formaldehyde resin microcapsules [7], chemical inhibitor [8], hydrogels [9,10], paste foam [11], and inorganic solid foam [12,13]. These materials can suppress the spontaneous coal combustion and aid the control of fires in underground coal mines. For large-scale coal fires in open-pit mines, aqueous foam has been proven to be a very effective material for extinguishing fires with large area in field applications [14]. During the coal mining process, large amounts of dust are generated during the cutting of rock and coal, which can cause dust explosion and pneumoconiosis [15,16]. Respirable dust with a diameter less than 5 μm is known to cause the greatest harm to miners’ health, because it can be suspended in the air for a long time and is easily inhaled into the respiratory system. In China, 6000 cases die of pneumoconiosis every year [17]. Compared with the most commonly used water spray technology, aqueous foam has a much higher dust-removing efficiency for respirable dust and thus can create a safe working environment for coal miners [18,19]. The properties of aqueous foam greatly affect the fire-fighting performance and dust suppression efficiency. The expansion ratio is an important parameter for fire-fighting foam, and it is related to the foamability of extinguishing agents. Foam with low expansion ratio has good wetting properties and can be directly sprayed onto fire. High-expansion foam, on the other hand, can adhere to vertical surfaces and fill a large fire space in a short time [20]. In dust control technology using foam, high foamability of foaming agents is expected. Such agents can generate more foam at a lower foaming agent concentration and reduce the economic cost of this technology. Foam with high liquid content can improve its spray distance and cover range of dust source, which are helpful for suppressing dust [21]. Bubbles with small size are not easy to rupture during the flow and spray process of foam. A study has shown that a bubble size in the range of 100–200 μm is optimal [22]. Therefore, studying the foam properties of the foaming agent solution is of great significance, as it can provide guidance for fire fighting and dust control technologies using aqueous foam. The foam properties are closely related to the adding concentration and the composition of the foaming agent. In field applications, the concentration of foaming agents used in fire fighting and dust control technologies is relatively high, resulting in high economic cost. For example, the extinguishing agent is used at the concentration of 3% [3,4], and the concentration of foaming agent for dust control is 2–3% [23]. At present, surfactant/water-soluble-polymer systems are widely studied, and the polymers have been found to significantly change the solution and foam properties [24]. Deng et al. [25] investigated the foam properties of a solution of an anionic surfactant, sodium alcohol ether sulfate (AES), and the polymer exopolysaccharide (EPS). Their results show that both the foamability and foam stability of the solution were improved greatly by the formation of hydrogen bonds between AES and EPS at the interfaces. Zhang et al. [26] studied the effect of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the foam and interfacial properties of Tween 20 solution. They found that BSA lowered the foam drainage rate and enhanced the foam stability. Xu et al. [27] reported that the water-soluble polymer welan gum increased the surface tension of AES solution because of the competitive adsorption at the air-water surface and the diffusion resistance caused by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force. The foaming ability and foam stability were higher than those of the single system, and a synergistic effect was present. These findings motivated us to study the effects of water-soluble polymers on solution and foam properties of surfactant solutions, in order to improve the foam properties and lower the adding concentration of foaming agents that could be used for fire fighting and dust control technologies in coal mines. In this work, the surfactant AES was chosen due to its good foaming performance. HPAM was also selected because it is a cheap and easily available polymer that is widely used in petroleum industry to improve the stability of foam [28,29]. In our experiments, the water-soluble polymer HPAM was added to the AES solution to form surfactant-polymer systems at different concentrations. The surface tension and bulk viscosity of the AES/HPAM solution were measured, and the foam properties foamability, liquid-carrying capacity of foam, drainage rate, and bubble size were tested. The relationship between solution properties and foam properties were analyzed in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials AES (70 wt% solution, purity ≥99%) with a formula of CH3-(CH2) m -(OCH2CH2) n -SO4Na (m = 11–13, n = 2 or 3) was purchased from Qingdao Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd.. HPAM (purity ≥99%) with a molecular weight of 400 × 104 g mol−1, was provided by Xinbang Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd.. The water used in all experiments was distilled twice. The solution containing HPAM polymer was stirred for 24 h with a magnetic stirrer so that the polymer was fully dissolved. All measurements were performed at 25 °C."
3,Surface tension measurement,"2.2 Surface tension measurement The surface tension of the surfactant-polymer solution was measured on a JYW-200B surface tension meter through the platinum ring method. The average value of the surface tension was obtained from three measurements for each solution. Before every measurement, the platinum ring was cleaned with distilled water and then dried over an alcohol lamp."
4,Viscosity measurement,"2.3 Viscosity measurement The viscosity of various solutions was measured with an NDJ-5S digital viscometer. In all measurements, a #0 cylinder rotor was used and the rotation speed was set at 60 rpm. Every solution was measured three times to obtain an average value. Before proceeding to the next measurement, the rotor was cleaned with distilled water, and then the water on the rotor was wiped with filter paper."
5,Measurement of foam properties,"2.4 Measurement of foam properties Foam properties were measured by using a Foamscan analyzer (Teclis Scientific, France). The schematic for this instrument is described in our previous publication [30]. At the bottom of the transparent vertical glass tube is a sample cell. Before each experiment, a certain volume of surfactant solution is injected into the sample cell. Subsequently, gas is dispersed into the solution through a porous glass plate to generate foam. The foam volume in the glass tube is monitored through an optical camera. Five electrodes are positioned at different heights in the glass tube, and the liquid volume of the foam is measured by the conductivity method. Images of the bubbles are recorded with a CCD camera, and the bubble size can be analyzed with cell size analysis (CSA) software. In all experiments, 40 mL of the test solution was injected into the sample cell, and the gas flow of dry air was set at 50 mL min−1. A # P3 porous glass plate with an average pore diameter of 16–40 μm was used. The blowing of dry air was terminated immediately when a foam volume of 200 mL was reached. From the beginning of foam generation, the Foamscan analyzer was used to automatically record the foam volume, liquid volume in the foam, and bubble images at an interval of 5 s. Foamability was assumed to be the time required to obtain 200 mL of foam. The shorter the time it takes, the better is the foamability. The liquid-carrying capacity and drainage properties were analyzed from the change in liquid volume of the foam. Bubble size was characterized by the mean bubble radius by using CSA software."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Surface tension,"3.1 Surface tension Surface tension is one of the most important properties of surfactant solutions. It is related to the adsorption state of surfactant molecules at the air-water surface, and it greatly affects the foam performance. The process of foam generation is accompanied by an increase in surface area, which is concurrent with an increase in system energy. From a thermodynamic point of view, a surfactant solution with a high surface tension increases the difficulty of foam generation because of high surface free energy, while a low surface tension reduces the energy for generating foam [31]. Thus, we obtained the surface tension of the AES solutions with and without HPAM polymer at different concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1 . With the increase in AES concentration, the surface tension dropped sharply and then reached a plateau. This is related to the adsorption density of the surfactant at the air-water surface. That is, the surface adsorption density first increased and then became saturated with increasing AES concentration. Therefore, the surface tension of the AES solution did not change at high AES concentrations. We then investigated the effect of HPAM concentration on the surface tension of the AES solutions. From Fig. 1, we can see that when the AES concentration was 0.01 wt%, the increase in HPAM concentration could significantly increase the surface tension of the AES solution. However, when the AES concentration exceeded 0.05 wt%, HPAM only slightly increased the surface tension. This trend is explained as follows. Hydrogen-bonding interaction exists between the polyoxyethylene group of AES molecules and the amide group of HPAM molecules. The hydrogen bonding could lead to the adsorption of HPAM chains to the surfactant monolayer at the air-water surface. It also caused some surfactant molecules to adsorb onto the polymer chains in bulk solution, which decreased the surface adsorption density of the surfactant. As a result, the surface tension increased significantly. When the AES concentration was high, some surfactant molecules adsorbed onto the HPAM chains, but there were still enough surfactant molecules that could adsorb onto the air-water surface to make it saturated. In addition, part of the HPAM chains could still insert into the surfactant monolayer at the air-water surface and occupy a certain area. Consequently, the surfactant adsorption density at the air-water surface of the AES/HPAM solutions became slightly lower than that of pure AES solutions, thereby increasing the surface tension slightly. The air-water surface adsorption state of the AES/HPAM solutions at low and high AES concentrations is shown in Fig. 2 ."
8,Bulk viscosity,"3.2 Bulk viscosity Bulk viscosity is also an important parameter that affects the liquid-carrying and drainage process of the foam, as well as the bubble size [27,32]. Therefore, the bulk viscosity of the AES/HPAM solutions was measured (Fig. 3 ). At the same HPAM concentration, the increase in AES concentration resulted in different adsorption states between AES and HPAM (Fig. 2). While the bulk viscosity of AES/HPAM solutions only fluctuated at a certain value with the change of AES concentration (Fig. 3). This indicates that the different adsorption states did not affect the bulk viscosity. At different HPAM concentrations, the bulk viscosity increased with the increase in HPAM concentration. Thus, the HPAM polymer content determined the viscosity of the AES/HPAM systems rather than the AES concentration."
9,Foam properties,"3.3 Foam properties 3.3.1 Foamability The foam generation time of AES/HPAM solutions is shown in Fig. 4 . We can see that for all the solutions, the foam generation time first decreased sharply and then gradually reached a plateau with increasing AES concentration. The inflection was at about 0.1 wt% AES concentration, which is greatly larger than the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 189 mg L−1 [33]. This indicates that the optimal concentration for generating foam is 0.1 wt% rather than the CMC, which may be explained by the change in surface tension and adsorption density of the surfactant at the air-water surface. When the AES concentration was less than the CMC, the increase in AES concentration could decrease the surface tension, which in turn enhanced the foamability and shortened the foam generation time. According to the general relationship between the CMC and foamability, the foamability becomes almost constant at concentrations above CMC because the surface tension does not change. However, the foam generation time still decreased with the increase in AES concentration in the range of the CMC to 0.1 wt%, indicating that the foamability still increased above the CMC. The reason for this trend is that the air-water surface area expanded rapidly during foam generation, resulting in the depletion of surfactant molecules in bulk solution and the adsorption of surfactants to the newly generated air-water surface. At the CMC, the air-water surface adsorption density had just reached saturation. The solution could not provide enough surfactant molecules that adsorbed to the newly generated huge air-water surface, thus leading to a sharp decrease in surface adsorption density and a great increase in surface tension. This could markedly lower the foamability of the surfactant solution. Therefore, the foamability above the CMC could still be improved by increasing the surfactant concentration. When the AES concentration was larger than 0.1 wt%, the foam generation time became almost constant, indicating that there were enough surfactant molecules that could adsorb to the newly generated air-water surface and thus maintained the saturated adsorption state. Consequently, the foamability reached the maximum and did not change at higher surfactant concentrations. The effect of HPAM polymer concentration on foamability varied with the surfactant concentration. At AES concentrations of 0.01 wt% and 0.05 wt%, the increase in HPAM concentration resulted in gradual reduction of the foam generation time, as shown in Fig. 5 . Foam is an unstable thermodynamic system, and surfactant is a stabilizer of bubble films. In the process of foam generation, bubble formation and breakdown occur simultaneously [34]. When the bubble formation rate is much greater than the bubble breakdown rate, foam volume increases gradually. This, however, does not mean that there is no bubble rupture. A high bubble breakdown rate will lead to a long generation time and low foamability. At low AES concentrations (0.01 wt% and 0.05 wt%), the solution could not maintain the surfactant adsorption density saturated at the newly generated air-water surface during foam production. This resulted in the instability of the bubble film and an increase in bubble breakdown rate, causing a long foam-generation time. After the addition of HPAM, hydrogen bonds could form between surfactant and polymer molecules, and the bulk viscosity and liquid volume in the foam increased, as discussed in Section 3.3.2. As a result, it could improve the stability of the bubble film and reduce the breakdown rate of bubbles. That is why the foam generation time shortened with increasing HPAM concentration, indicating that it was possible to improve the foamability of AES solutions by adding HPAM polymer at low AES concentrations. We can see in Fig. 4 that the foam generation time of the AES/HPAM systems was almost the same as that of pure AES solutions when the AES concentration was larger than 0.1 wt%. It is because the surface adsorption density of the surfactant reached saturation and could maintain the stability of the bubble film. The addition of HPAM did not affect the bubble breakdown rate significantly, and so the foam generation time remained constant. This indicates that HPAM did not affect the foamability at high AES concentrations. 3.3.2 Liquid volume of the foam A schematic of the change in liquid volume of the foam from the start of foam formation to complete rupture during foam production through gas sparging method is shown in Fig. 6 . The foam generation stage was from t = 0 to t = t1, in which gas was sparged into the surfactant solution at a constant flow rate. At the same time, the liquid volume of the foam increased linearly. At t = t1, when the gas flow was stopped, the foam volume no longer increased. The liquid volume in the foam reached the maximum value, which could be defined as the initial liquid volume of the foam. The foam then went into decay stage, in which liquid drained from the foam under gravity and capillary force. Then bubble coalescence and collapse occurred as well. When the foam finally disappeared completely, the liquid volume of the foam became zero. The initial liquid volumes of the foam of the AES/HPAM systems are shown in Fig. 7 . We can see that the initial liquid volume of the foam first increased rapidly and then reached a plateau as the AES concentration increased. When the AES concentration was less than 0.1 wt%, the initial liquid volume in foam increased sharply. This is because with the increase in AES concentration, the quantity of adsorbed surfactant molecules at the air-water surface increased gradually, enhancing the hydration interaction with water molecules. Consequently, the liquid-carrying capacity improved. In addition, the liquid-carrying and drainage processes occurred simultaneously during foam formation. The foam had sufficient time to drain when the generation time was long, thereby reducing the initial liquid volume of the foam. We can see in Fig. 4 that the foam generation time decreased sharply when the AES concentration was less than 0.1 wt%. Therefore, the volume of liquid that had drained decreased during foam formation with increasing AES concentration. Based on these two phenomena, the initial liquid volume of the foam increased at low AES concentrations. When the AES concentration was higher than 0.1 wt%, the adsorption density of the surfactant at the air-water surface reached saturation, and the foam generation time was not substantially different (Fig. 4). Thus, the initial liquid volume of the foam reached a plateau with the increase in AES concentration. At the same AES concentration, the increase in HPAM content could improve the initial liquid volume of the foam, which was caused by the increased bulk viscosity of the AES/HPAM solutions. Therefore, the initial liquid volume of the foam depended on the concentrations of AES and HPAM. In order to improve the liquid-carrying capacity without increasing surfactant concentration, it is a good choice to add HPAM polymer to foaming agents. Two groups of samples were used to study the drainage process for the AES/HPAM systems in the foam decay stage: pure AES solutions without polymer and AES solutions (0.1 wt%) with different HPAM concentrations (Figs. 8 and 9 ). Because the foam generation time differed at different concentrations, we assumed the time for the foam volume to reach 200 mL as the initial time, which we used to plot the drainage data for all samples. An exponential formula was used to fit the drainage curve [35]: (1) y = y 0 + a e - t / b where y 0 refers to the liquid volume of the foam when the foam is completely drained, a represents the initial liquid volume of the foam, and b means the drainage rate of the foam. The larger is the a value, the larger is the liquid-carrying capacity. The smaller is the b value, the faster the foam drains. In our measurements, the foam became very stable when the liquid volume of the foam was less than 1 mL. The liquid volume fluctuated below 1 mL for a very long time, indicating that the liquid in the foam had been fully drained. Therefore, we fitted the data for liquid volumes larger than 1 mL to study the fast-drainage stage of the foam. The fitting parameters of the two groups of samples are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . Theoretically, the liquid in the foam is drained completely when the time is long enough. Thus, the y 0 value should be positive and almost equal to zero. However, some y 0 values are negative in Tables 1 and 2. This is because we only selected the data for the fast-drainage stage when the liquid volume was larger than 1 mL, which led to the downward trend of the fitting curves and the negative y 0 values. Therefore, we only analyzed the changes in a and b values. Table 1 shows that the a value first increases sharply and then becomes large slowly with the increase in AES concentration, and that the inflection occurs at an AES concentration of 0.1 wt%, which is consistent with the trend of the initial liquid volume of the foam in Fig. 7. The b value also becomes large gradually with increasing AES concentration, indicating that the increase in AES concentration can lower the foam drainage rate. As seen in Table 2, a and b values increase with the increase in of HPAM concentration, indicating that the increase in HPAM concentration can raise the initial liquid volume of the foam and decrease the foam drainage rate caused by an increase in bulk viscosity. Moreover, all correlation coefficients of the fitting curves exceed 0.99, implying that the fitting formula can accurately describe the fast-drainage process of the foam. The decreased drainage rate by the addition of HPAM polymer could reduce the amount of liquid drained from foam during the delivery and increase the liquid content in foam at the outlet of the foam generator, which was helpful for the improvement of foam spray distance and fire extinguishing performance. 3.3.3 Bubble size When the gas flow was stopped, the bubble images were captured and analyzed by CSA software to obtain the mean radius of bubbles, as shown in Fig. 10 . When the AES concentration was less than 0.1 wt%, the mean radius of the bubbles decreased rapidly with the increase in AES concentration. This is because the adsorption density of the surfactant at the newly generated surface was not saturated. More surfactant molecules diffused and adsorbed onto the air-water surface, quickly stabilizing bubbles, and resulting in small bubbles. When the AES concentration was higher than 0.1 wt%, the surface adsorption density was saturated. The increase in AES concentration did not change the amount of adsorbed surfactant and the adsorption rate at the air-water surface, and so the bubble size did not decrease. The other reason for this is related to the foam generation time. At low AES concentrations, a short foam generation time helped prevent bubble coalescence and thus favored formation of small bubbles with increasing surfactant concentration. But at AES concentrations higher than 0.1 wt%, the generation time was almost constant, and so the change in surfactant concentration had no effect on bubble size. The effect of HPAM concentration on bubble size differed at low and high AES concentrations. The mean radius of bubbles plotted as a function HPAM concentration at AES concentrations of 0.01 wt% and 0.05 wt% is shown in Fig. 11 (a) and (b). The bubble images at AES concentrations of 0.01 wt% and 0.05 wt% with different HPAM concentrations are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 . We can see that the bubble size first increased and then decreased with the increase in HPAM concentration. The reason for this is explained as follows. At low AES concentrations, the bubble film was not stable because of the unsaturated surfactant adsorption monolayer. The addition of HPAM could greatly improve the stability of the bubble film because of the hydrogen bonds between surfactant molecules and polymer chains, which reduced the breakdown ratio of large bubbles and enlarged the mean radius. When the HPAM concentration was higher than 0.01 wt%, the bulk viscosity began to influence the bubble size. The increase in bulk viscosity led to more resistance during generation of bubbles, thus gradually decreasing the bubble size. At high AES concentration, however, the bubble size did not substantially vary with the AES solutions and at different HPAM concentrations. Nevertheless, all of the AES/HPAM systems had mean radii of bubbles larger than that of the pure AES solution. This is because the hydrogen bonds between the surfactant and polymer slightly improved the stability of the large bubbles even though the surfactant adsorption monolayer reached saturation. Thus, the bubble size of the surfactant-polymer systems was slightly larger than that of the pure surfactant solution."
10,Conclusions,"In the present work, the surface tension, bulk viscosity and foam properties of AES/HPAM solutions at different concentrations were investigated. The addition of HPAM could increase the surface tension of AES solutions caused by the decrease of surfactant adsorption density at the air-water surface. The viscosity of the AES/HPAM systems was determined by the HPAM concentration. The higher was the HPAM concentration, the higher the bulk viscosity became. Foam properties were analyzed from foam generation time, liquid volume of foam and bubble size. The foam generation time first decreased and then reached a plateau with increasing AES concentration. The inflection for foamability occurred at a surfactant concentration of 0.1 wt%, which is larger than the CMC. The addition of HPAM could improve the foamability at low AES concentrations because the hydrogen bonds between surfactant and polymer molecules, as well as the increased bulk viscosity, stabilized the bubble film and reduced the bubble breakdown rate. The increase in AES and HPAM concentrations could improve the liquid-carrying capacity and reduce the drainage rate of the foam. The liquid drainage curves were fitted with an exponential formula, which showed a good correlation with the experimental data. The bubble size first decreased rapidly and then diminished slowly, reaching a plateau with the increase in AES concentration. The addition of HPAM polymer could enlarge the bubble size obviously at low AES concentrations. The addition of HPAM at low AES concentrations could improve the foamability and the liquid-carrying capacity, decrease the drainage rate and enlarge the bubble size, which made it possible to use low concentrations of foaming agents and improve foam properties by adding water-soluble polymer in fire fighting and dust control technologies."
