0,Introduction,"Multiple catalytic transformations performed in one reaction system, called domino [1], cascade [2] tandem [3] direct synthesis [4] or one-pot synthesis [5] are currently attracting much attention for achieving an ideal synthesis in terms of atom- and step-efficiency. Among the large scope of multi-step reactions, the hydrogen-borrowing approach, also called hydrogen auto-transfer [6] is one powerful approach for the one-pot synthesis of CC [7] or CN [8] bond formation without the need for the pre-functionalization of substrates [9]. This strategy relies on three main steps: (i) dehydrogenation, (ii) coupling condensation, and (iii) re-hydrogenation (Scheme 1 ) [10]. Direct N-alkylation of the amine with alcohol is an attractive transformation since it can replace the conventionally non-green methodologies for N-alkylation synthesis, such as hydroamination [11] or N-alkylation with alkyl halide [12]. Such kinds of synthesis are frequently applied as scaffolds for pharmaceutical [13] and agrochemical sectors [14]. Recent research on the N-alkylation was generally focused on the development of homogeneous catalysis using Ru [15], Ir [16], Rh [17], Au [18], Ag [19], Os [20] or non-noble Ni [21], Co [22], Fe [23] and Mn [24] complex catalysts. Due to the difficult recovery, the heterogeneous catalysts based on Ru [25], Ag [26], Pd [27], Au [28] Ir [29] and the inexpensive catalysts based on Fe [30], Ni [31], Mn [32], and Cu [33], have been investigated. Likhar et al. [34] and Suib et al. [35] developed Cu/Al-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) catalysts for the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols for a very large scope of alcohol substrates. However, the catalysts mainly suffer from base additives, high reaction temperatures, and O2 exposure, and the secondary amine was hardly observed. Such LDH materials, expressed by the formula [M2+ 1−xM3+ x(OH)2]−(An−)x/n·mH2O, where M2+ and M3+ cations are distributed in brucite-like layers, have recently attracted considerable interest due to their attractive features of topotactic transformation and tunable acid-base structure properties by varying the composition and pretreatment temperature [36]. In heterogeneous catalysis, the LDHs have been widely used for various reactions both as catalyst supports and catalysts precursors [37–39]. Based on the reported structural merits of LDH materials, we prepared inexpensive Cu-Fe catalysts from LDH precursors for the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol for an intensive study of the alcohol amination. Previously, we reported that the Cu-Fe(3) treated with H2 at 300 ºC (denoted as Cu-Fe(3)HT-300) acted as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of various alcohols [40]. To improve the understanding of the dehydrogenation-based reaction, we investigated the catalytic activity of this magnetically responsive Cu-Fe HT-300 catalyst for alcohol amination using benzyl alcohol and aniline as substrates. Herein, we screened the catalyst based on Cu-M HT prepared from LDH feature to investigate the effects of the solvent, H2 treatment temperature, and additive base compound. In addition, the influence of the amine/alcohol substrate ratios, catalyst recyclability, reaction mechanisms with time profiles, kinetic studies, and experiments of partial step reactions was included in this report."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O; WAKO), iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; WAKO), sodium hydroxides (NaOH; WAKO), p-xylene (WAKO), copper powder (Cu, WAKO), iron (II,III) oxide (Fe3O4; Sigma-Aldrich) and trans-decahydronaphthalene (WAKO) were purchased from Japan and used as received."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Cu-M catalysts with M = Fe, In, Zr, La, Mn, Ce, and Y were prepared from each LDH precursor. Synthesis of Cu-M precursor. The Cu-M(x) LDH precursors were typically prepared by the following procedure. At room temperature, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and M(NO3)3·yH2O (with x = Cu/M mole ratio) were dissolved in 85 mL deionized water. The mixture solution was stirred with the addition of 15 mL of 2.0 M NaOH at room temperature. The solution was conducted at 333 K for 24 h under an air atmosphere. The fluffy solid was filtered and dried under vacuum overnight to obtain the LDH precursor. Synthesis of Cu-M catalyst. The Cu-M catalyst was produced by a reduction process of LDH precursor. The Cu-M LDH precursor was reduced with H2 gas at 300 ºC for 1 h to obtain the Cu-M catalyst (denoted as Cu-M(x)HT-300). For the Cu-Fe catalyst, the reduction temperature was varied in the range of 300–500 °C."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization XRD measurements were recorded on a D8 ADVANCE, Bruker using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418 nm). The XRD was operated at 40 kV and 15 mA with divergence and scattering slit 1°, a step width of 0.02° and scan speed of 5° min−1. TEM images were captured with a Hitachi High-tech H-7650 microscopy apparatus with a field emission gun operated at 100 kV. The catalysts were dispersed in water and dropped by pipette on a Cu grid coated with carbon film and subsequently dried by evaporation prior to the analysis. SEM images were obtained using an SEM-JEOL-JSM-6330 F instrument at 20 kV with a field emissive gun under vacuum and ambient conditions. Product yields were determined by a GC (Shimadzu GC-14B) equipped with a flame ionization detector and Rtx-BAC PLUS 1. The GC was operated under the conditions as follow: injection temperature (220 °C), detection temperature (250 °C), initial temperature (130 °C), initial time (2 min) progress rate (3 °C/min), final temperature (250 °C), and final time (5 min). The sample was introduced into the column via split mode (1/50), and the system used N2 carrier gas at 50 kPa and 100 kPa for carriers P1 and P2, respectively."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test A typical reaction procedure for direct N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol over Cu-Fe catalysts is described as the follows. Catalyst (0.1 g), benzyl alcohol (1.0 mmol), aniline (varied 1∼3 equivalent), trans-decahydronaphthalene (0.08 g), and solvent (p-xylene, 3 mL) were placed into a Schlenk tube, followed by filling with the N2 atmosphere. The mixture was subsequently stirred under reflux condition, and a series of heating temperature was set in the range of 130–180 °C with real reaction temperatures for 140 °C, 150 °C, 160 °C, 170 °C, and 180 °C settings of 138 °C, 144 °C, 148 °C, 154 °C, and 163 °C, respectively. Conversion and yields for the product distribution were monitored by a Shimadzu GC-14B equipped with a flame ionization detector using trans-decahydronaphthalene as the internal standard. The other products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. The catalytic activity represented by TOF, calculated as follows: TOF (h−1) = (product mole (below 50 % conversion))/(mole of Cu on surface × reaction time). The number of moles of Cu on the surface was determined by the H2 uptake measurement."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD spectra of Cu-M LDHs, displayed in Fig. 1 (a), showed the series of (00l) peaks at regular intervals due to the stacking periodicity of the hydroxide-based layers [41]. The typical (003), (006), and (009) reflections of Cu-Fe LDH showed at 13°, 26°, and 34°, respectively, corresponding to a rhombohedral structure having a cactus-like feature (Figure S2) [42,43]. The diffractograms of Cu-In, Cu-Zr, Cu-La, Cu-Mn, Cu-Ce and Cu-Y showed a similar pattern to the peaks of Cu-Fe, indicating the same crystallinity. With H2 treatment at 300 °C, the typical peaks attributed to LDH phases vanished with concomitant formation of metal oxide and Cu metal, shown in Fig. 1(b). The indicative Cu metal formation was observed in peaks at 2θ = 43° (111), 51° (200), and 74° (220) according to JCPDS 04–0836, with face-centered cubic (fcc) structures and space groups of Fd-3 m. On the other hand, the second metal was converted to the metal oxide species, i.e. In2O3, ZrO2, MnO, CeO2, Y2O3 and Fe3O4, except for La(OH)3. The crystallite size of the Cu metal was determined at (111) peak reflection using Scherrer’s equation. The transformation is simply illustrated in Fig. 1(c) based on the XRD results. It was indicated that increasing the temperature of H2 treatment gradually enhanced the crystallite size of Cu species (Fig. 1(d)). The FeO species was observed in the Cu-Fe treated at 500 °C. Notably, the minimum temperature to obtain Cu metal was 250 °C, and the Cu species was not reducible for H2 treatment at 200 °C. Cu2O species was also resulted in the reduction at 250 °C. The FT-IR measurements suggested that the as-synthesized Cu-M LDHs contained CO3 2− (for peak at 1421, 1047 cm-1), and NO3- (for peak at 1384, 1342 cm-1) as the counter anion in the interlayer, as shown in Fig. 1(e). The complete assignment of each observed IR peaks for the Cu-M catalysts are indicated in Figure S3."
8,Catalytic result,"3.2 Catalytic result In the initial studies, the catalyst screening was performed using benzyl alcohol (1, 1.1 mmol) and aniline (2, 1.1 mmol) in p-xylene at 154 °C for 24 h under N2. In Table 1 , the catalytic results are listed. The main products were N-benzylideneaniline (3) and N-benzylaniline (4) using Cu-M catalysts. Among the screened catalysts, the Cu-Fe catalyst showed the highest amine yield of 73 % for 4 and 27 % for 3 (entry 7). Although Cu-Ce catalyst (entry 5) also showed an identical result, the carbon balance was low (68 %) due to the self-coupling reaction (detected by GC–MS analysis). Next, the catalytic test using Cu-Fe based catalyst was investigated (entries 7–13). It was found that the yield of 4 decreased when the catalyst reacted under air and O2 atmospheres to 52 % and 27 %, respectively (entries 8 and 9). This finding indicated that the reaction smoothly proceeded under a N2 atmosphere. The conventionally supported Cu/Fe3O4 catalysts [44] prepared by impregnation (Cu/Fe3O4 imp), co-precipitation (Cu/Fe3O4 co−p) and physically mixing (Cu/Fe3O4 pm) methods did not increase the yield of 4 (entries 11–13). The result revealed that the Cu-Fe(3)HT prepared from the LDH structure showed superior activity compared to these aforementioned catalysts, indicating that the LDH feature was crucial for improving the catalytic activity. However, the desired product was not satisfactorily obtained using the Cu–Fe(3)LDH (entry 10), suggesting that H2 treatment was necessary for increasing the yield of the target product. In addition, reactions with monometallic Cu LCH (layered copper hydroxides)-HT, Cu powder, Fe3O4 and no catalyst were inactive (entries 14–17), indicating the imperative role of Cu and Fe species on Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalysts for the catalytic cycle of the N-alkylation reaction. The Cu-Fe(3)HT catalyst was subsequently adopted for reaction optimization. For reaction optimization, the effect of the reaction temperature was examined at a range of 130−163 °C. From Fig. 2 (a), sole product 3 was yielded at 130 and 138 °C, with 58%–70% yields, respectively, and no formation of 4 was indicated. The product of 3 decreased sharply with the concomitant increase of 4 at reaction temperature > 138 °C. The optimum condition to achieve 4 was at 163 °C, with 88 % yield of 4 [45]. At 148 °C, the effect of the 1:2 substrate ratio for the product distribution was studied. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the formation of 3 proportionally increased with the 1:2 substrate ratio. It was found that the production of 3 achieved a 75 % yield at a ratio of 3. The solvent screening demonstrated that p-xylene was the most effective solvent for this reaction system (Table S1). The addition of a base notably decreased the catalytic selectivity for 3 and 4 (Table S2). Next, the reduction temperature effect on the Cu-Fe catalyst for the direct N-alkylation was studied (Fig. 2(c)) at 154 °C. For the Cu-Fe(3)HT-250 catalyst, the imine 3 (75 %) was higher than amine 4 (25 %) due to the presence of the Cu2O species (detected by XRD in Fig. 1(d)), which is inactive for this reaction. In contrast, a large portion of 4 (73 %) was detected using the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300, indicating that the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst was more effective for this reaction. Further temperature investigations suggested that 4 gradually decreased with the increasing portion of 3. These results revealed that increasing particle size due to increase in reduction temperature decreased the catalytic activity producing 4. Finally, the catalytic recyclability of the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst was investigated at an optimum condition using recovered catalyst (Fig. 2(d)). Notably, the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst was easily separated from the reaction mixture using an external magnet and used for the consecutive run without activation. The recovered catalyst was recyclable up to 5 times with no loss of activity. The product distribution of 3 and 4 exhibited a similar ratio (∼ 2). The XRD profile of the used catalyst showed a similar pattern (Figure S4), suggesting that the crystal phase was unchanged even after the 5 consecutive runs."
9,Mechanistic study,"3.3 Mechanistic study 3.3.1 Study of reaction pathway Compared to previous catalytic systems [40], the presence of a transition metal catalyst for N-alkylation of the amine with alcohol may proceed through a sequential reaction pathway, including alcohol dehydrogenation, condensation, and hydrogenation of the imine. The reaction pathway was studied by monitoring the reaction progress on the time-profile experiment at 148 °C, shown in Fig. 3 . The reaction profile of Cu-Fe(3)HT catalyzing the N-alkylation showed that the benzaldehyde was the first intermediate product, indicating the initial dehydrogenation step of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde was subsequently decreased with time, accompanied by the increase in 3. This result suggested the condensation between aniline and benzaldehyde as the next reaction step. The maximum yield of 3 was observed at 24 h before observing a decrease in yield with the reaction time. In contrast, 4 was monotonically improved after 3 decreased, indicating the hydrogenation of 3 as the final reaction step. This reaction pathway is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 3 using the time-profile study. 3.3.2 Dehydrogenation Previously, we confirmed that this reaction proceeded via the hydrogen-borrowing process. Hereafter, the mechanistic studies were observed starting from the dehydrogenation step, which is generally promoted by acid-base property of catalyst [46–48]. The dehydrogenation was initially studied by monitoring the adsorption of 2-propanol on various catalysts using in situ FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the bands of adsorbed species on Cu-Fe(3)HT, Cu-layered copper hydroxides (LCH) HT, and Fe3O4 catalysts were mainly detected at 1159 and 1126 cm−1 assigned as ν(CO) and ν(CC) vibrations, respectively. The occurrence of two bands due to ν(CO)/ν(CC) vibration was assignable to the formation of mono- and bidentate metal-2-propoxide species, as reported by Pasupulety et al. [49]. On the other hand, the bands corresponding to the 2-propoxide species was not observed in the Cu powder sample, indicating that the 2-propanol was not adsorbed to the Cu metal. Because the kinetic results (Figure S5) revealed that the modification of the Fe species to active Cu metal enhanced the adsorption of alcohol, it was strongly indicated that the 2-propanol might be attracted to the Fe species. Additionally, the modification of the Fe species also decreased the activation energy (Ea), and thereby the Cu-Fe catalysts could promote the catalytic N-alkylation. However, the Fe species did not proceed with the dehydrogenation since the Fe3O4 was inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction. The dehydrogenation smoothly proceeded with the Cu-Fe catalyst. Thus, the α-C―H scission should proceed in the Cu(0) species, adjoining with the substrate adsorbed on Fe species, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). 3.3.3 Condensation Next, the characteristic condensation between benzaldehyde and aniline was studied, as shown in Fig. 5 . In the absence of the catalyst, the reaction of benzaldehyde with aniline yielded a quantifiable amount of imine product at 154 °C for 30-minute reaction. Previous reports also mentioned that this reaction spontaneously proceeds at ambient conditions [8,27], suggesting this reaction runs very fast. 3.3.4 Hydrogenation The catalytic hydrogenation of 3 to 4 was examined under atmospheric H2 (Fig. 6 ). This result showed that 3 was not entirely hydrogenated at 154 °C using the standard Cu-Fe catalyst. This phenomenon prompted us to investigate the probable hydrogenation proceeding via a transfer hydrogenation process. The transfer hydrogenation of 3 was conducted using benzyl alcohol (as the primary alcohol) and 1-phenylethanol (as the secondary alcohol) as the H2 sources. During transfer hydrogenation, 3 was exclusively hydrogenated to 4, resulting in 100 % yield of 4 using benzyl alcohol and 86 % yield of 4 using 1-phenylethanol as the H2 source, for a 1 -h reaction promoted by the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst. However, monometallic Cu (Cu powder) and Fe (Fe3O4) catalysts showed a low catalytic activity for the transfer hydrogenation (10 % and 16 % yield of 4, respectively). These results indicated the hydrogenation step proceeded by the transfer hydrogenation pathway [26,31] along the Cu and Fe species on the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalysts, where the hydride species from alcohol simultaneously transferred to intermediate 3 through the Cu species on the catalysts and adsorbed proton species through FeO moiety. The entirety of the catalytic process of N-alkylation of aniline using a Cu-Fe catalyst prepared from the Cu-Fe LDH precursor is illustrated in Fig. 7 . 3.3.5 Plausible mechanism It was shown previously that the Cu-Fe(3)LDH precursor was topotactically transformed to the Cu metal and Fe3O4 species resulting from the reduction process with H2 at 300 °C. The Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst was reportedly found to have an ability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols [40]. In the present system, the reaction was started from the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol by synergistic catalysis of Cu°Feδ+ Oδ− site to obtain benzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde was then reacted with aniline to simultaneously yield an imine 3 product. The reaction was terminated by the transfer hydrogenation step of imine 3 from CuH and FeOδ-H species resulting in an N-alkylated amine 4, as demonstrated in Fig. 7. Compared with the recently developed Cu catalysts, shown in Table S3, this Cu-Fe catalyst can efficiently process the direct N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol in the absence of basic additives and oxidants (O2 or air)."
10,Conclusion,"It was shown that the Cu-Fe catalysts prepared from the Cu-Fe LDH feature showed a prominent result for the direct N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol. The Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalysts provided the highest activity among the examined Cu-Fe based catalysts. A series of reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, 1:2 substrate ratio, and reduction temperature of the Cu-Fe catalyst, considerably affected the product distribution of the 4:3 product ratio. It was found that the highest 4 product yield (88 %) was generated by the Cu-Fe(3)HT-300 catalyst at 163 °C in a 24 h reaction with a 1:2 substrate ratio of ∼ 1 in the absence of additive basic compounds and oxidants. The Cu-Fe(3)HT catalyst was noticeably reusable for the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohols for at least five reactions with no significant loss of catalytic activity and no transformation of the species on the catalyst. According to mechanistic studies, the catalytic cycle followed the hydrogen-borrowing mechanism through (i) alcohol dehydrogenation, (ii) fast condensation, and (iii) transfer hydrogenation of imine. The cooperative catalysis between the Cu and Fe species in the Cu-Fe catalysts was imperative for the catalytic cycle of the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol."
