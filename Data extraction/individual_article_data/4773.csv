0,Introduction,"The concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) has increased the average global surface temperature by ~1.0 °C relative to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900), which has already led to major impacts on the key factors of the global ecosystem, including health, livelihoods, food security, and water supply [1]. In the U.S., the aviation industry was responsible for ~2.3% of annual energy use and GHG emissions in 2017, and this is projected to increase to 5% by 2050 [2]. One of the targets that has been put forward in the revised renewable fuel standard (RFS2) mandates is to reduce the GHG emissions of the aviation industry by 50% by 2050, compared to the baseline in 2005 [3]. Use of renewable jet fuel blendstocks has the highest potential to minimize GHG emissions of aviation industry, while ensuring national energy security [4]. In addition, there are current developments towards use of 100% drop-in fuels, as well as propulsion technologies that take non-drop-in fuels [5]. Despite all the traction towards commercialization of renewable jet fuel, the production cost and sustainability of feedstock supply remain as the main challenges towards sustainable development of aviation biofuels. Potential feedstocks for renewable jet fuel production include lignocellulosic biomass such as corn stover, starch-based feedstocks such as corn grain, and oil-based feedstocks such as canola, soybean, and camelina oilseeds [6]. Renewable jet fuel production technologies vary based on the type of feedstock and include alcohol-to-jet, syngas-to-jet, and oil-to-jet, as described in the literature [7]. Hydroprocessing, an oil-to-jet technology, is the most common pathway to convert vegetable oils, fats, or bio-oil into hydrocarbons, at the temperature in the range of 300-350˚C and pressure in the range of 3–4 MPa [8], in the presence of catalyst and the use of hydrogen [9]. Hydroprocessing is performed through three main steps of hydrogenation, hydrocracking and separation into different products, including light gases, naphtha, hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ), and green diesel [10]. This technology has been approved by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) international [11], and has been used by several aviation fleets to produce HRJ from different oil-based feedstocks, such as camelina and carinata, for the demonstration purpose [12]. The baseline life cycle GHG footprint of petroleum-based jet fuel has been estimated to be 89 gCO2eq/MJ [13]. To be a viable alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel, renewable jet fuel should be environmentally-friendly, energy-efficient, economically viable, and consistently producible at the commercial scale without reducing food supplies [14]. In this context, challenges associated with sustainable feedstock supply, high production cost, environmental impacts, and energy use hinder adoption of renewable jet fuel at the commercial scale [9]. Evaluating the energy use and environmental impacts of renewable jet fuel production is necessary for determining the energy or environmental benefits of alternative jet fuel over petroleum-based jet fuel. These require a thorough assessment of inputs and outputs for the entire life cycle to quantify the direct and indirect energy use and environmental impacts [14]. Type of feedstock is one of the factors significantly affecting the overall environmental impacts and energy use efficiency of renewable jet fuel, mainly due to the use of inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and resources such as fossil fuels, land, and water, to produce feedstock [15]. Thus, there is a growing interest towards identifying promising jet fuel feedstocks with lower inputs and resource requirements. Pennycress is an oilseed crop which has the potential to fit as a winter annual crop in corn-soybean rotation in the Midwestern U.S. [16], to reduce soil erosion and runoff, and minimize nutrients load to the water bodies through the use of excess nutrients available in the soil during the winter months [17]. Pennycress yield ranges from 1500 to 2500 kg/ha, and the grain contains 25–36% oil [18–22]. Considering the yield and oil content of pennycress grain, its oil yield (400–800 L/ha) [17] is comparable to that of similar oilseeds, such as soybean (420–640 L/ha), camelina (~450 L/ha), and canola (700–1100 L/ha) [23]. In addition, fatty acid composition of pennycress oil makes it suitable for conversion to renewable jet fuel [22]. Several studies have focused on evaluating the energy use and environmental impacts of jet fuel production from different biobased feedstocks, including camelina [24], canola [25], jatropha [26], algae [25], salicornia [25], soybean [26], palm [26], switchgrass [25], corn stover [4], and short-rotation woody crops [4]. Less GHG emissions of renewable jet fuel from biobased feedstocks, such as camelina [24] and canola [27], compared to those of petroleum-based counterparts, have been reported in several previous studies. In addition, the overall energy use and GHG emissions of jet fuel production from some of the lignocellulosic sources, such as corn stover, have been reported to be less than those of oil-based feedstocks, such as camelina and algae [4]. This is mainly due to considering environmental credit associated with removing lignocellulosic biomass (corn stover) from the field. Beal et al. [28] evaluated the environmental impacts of renewable jet fuel production form different feedstocks, including terrestrial crops (soy, corn, wood, and grass), marine microalgae, and by-products (forestry residue, municipal solid waste, and waste oil). They reported that forestry residue and waste oil yielded lower emissions. Renewable jet fuel production from oilseeds has been reported as a more viable option in terms of economic performance [4]. However, commercial supply of some oilseeds, such as camelina, is limited mainly because of competition with main crops or suitability of land for growing them at the large scale [4]. In a recent study [29], supply of canola-based HRJ by integration of canola into grain crops in the north central and western U.S. was evaluated and a significant reduction in global warming potential of HRJ compared to fossil jet fuel was reported. Pennycress has some distinctive advantages compared to similar HRJ feedstocks. For example, it has a relatively earlier harvest date, compared to similar oilseeds, which makes it suitable for incorporation into corn-soybean rotation in most of the upper Midwestern U.S. [30]. Thus, there is a huge potential of pennycress grain supply, without additional land requirement, competition with food resources, or any land use change impact [31]. Several of the studies have identified the feedstock production to be the main contributor to the overall energy requirement and GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of renewable jet fuel. For example, use of fertilizers for the production of oil-containing feedstocks, e.g., camelina [4,24], as well as land use change impact in soybean [32] and canola [33] have been reported to be the major contributors to the overall energy requirement and GHG emissions. Oilseeds production requires high levels of inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, as well as farm operations [4]. Direct emissions associated with the use of synthetic fertilizers in the field, as well as high levels of energy during the fertilizer production processes significantly affect the overall energy and environmental impacts of oilseed-based jet fuel [34]. High contribution of fertilization to the overall GHG emissions of HRJ production from canola (~44%), camelina (36–70%), and soybean (14%) has also been reported in previous studies [4,26]. In a recent study [35], the technical feasibility of establishing pennycress supply chain was evaluated and the cost of pennycress supply as HRJ feedstock was assessed. It was concluded that pennycress has a great potential as a HRJ feedstock, since it has lower production cost and less dependency on chemical fertilizers. Despite the specific characteristics of pennycress oil which make it a suitable jet fuel feedstock, and several of the other advantages of pennycress compared to similar oilseeds, literature lacks the knowledge of potential environmental impacts and energy use for pennycress-based HRJ production. In an earlier study, Fan et al. [15] estimated the GHG emissions of HRJ production from pennycress, through hydroprocessing technology, to be 32.7 gCO2eq/MJ, which were dominated by feedstock production and oil to HRJ conversion processes. The study, however, didn’t assess energy use efficiency and the other critical environmental impacts, such as acidification, eutrophication, and ecotoxicity potentials of pennycress-based HRJ production. In addition, the study was based on the assumption of using the pennycress meal as a protein source, while, recent literature [36] has pointed out the technical barriers towards its use as a protein source for animal feed, mainly due to its high levels of glycosinolates and erucic acid. Regarding several advantages of pennycress as HRJ feedstock, an especial attention is recently given to establishment of this crop in the U.S. [37] and the rest of the world [38]. In addition, comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy analysis are required to evaluate the sustainability of establishment of pennycress-based HRJ production system. Despite the efforts on energy and environmental LCA of jet fuel production from different biobased feedstocks [7,39], and advantages of pennycress as a potential jet fuel feedstock, none of the previous studies have addressed the comprehensive energy and environmental LCA of pennycress-based HRJ production. So, the objective of this study was to address the aforementioned research gap by evaluating the life cycle energy and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale. In addition to the mentioned research gap, majority of the available studies on energy and environmental impact assessments have focused on single-point evaluations using a deterministic approach, in which the inherent variability of the parameters is not reflected in the results [40]. Since, there is no commercial production of pennycress-based HRJ, the energy and environmental assessments of pennycress-based HRJ will have to be performed by considering several assumptions for the production, logistics and conversion processes of similar feedstocks, such as canola and camelina [41]. This causes uncertainty associated with variability of the data from different sources. In this aspect, the novelty of this study is that it applies the stochastic method of Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the uncertainties due to variability in the input data from different sources [42]. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effect of variations in input parameters on the life cycle energy and environmental impacts of the pennycress-based HRJ production. The outcomes of this research can help identify the performance targets towards improving energy use efficiency and environmental performance of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale, which can be useful for the farmers, researchers, aviation industry, and policy makers."
1,Methodology,"Life cycle energy and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production were analyzed following the ISO 14040 [43] and ISO 14044 [44] standards, comprising of goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and results interpretation."
2,Goal and scope definition,"2.1 Goal and scope definition 2.1.1 Goal and functional unit The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the energy use and environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of pennycress-based HRJ production. The well-to-biorefinery gate system boundary of pennycress-based HRJ included pennycress production, logistics operations, oil extraction and conversion processes, wastewater treatment, and on-site energy generation from burning pennycress meal (Fig. 1 ). The main product was HRJ, while liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), naphtha, green diesel and electricity were considered as the byproducts of this pathway. The functional unit was considered to be 1 GJ of HRJ, at the biorefinery gate. Using the energy allocation approach, the life cycle energy and environmental impacts of the defined system were distributed among the main product and byproducts based on their energy contents. This allocation approach has been previously used by several of the studies to assess the energy use and environmental impacts during the life cycle of biofuels, e.g., aviation biofuel [2,26], biodiesel and bioethanol [14]. Since the focus of this study was to evaluate the energy and environmental impacts of pennycress-based jet fuel production, the system boundary covered up to the biorefinery gate, which means fuel transportation and distribution were not considered for this analysis. Almost half of the total operational biodiesel biorefineries in the U.S. are of the capacities ranging in size from 0.1 to 57 million liters per year (MLPY) (0.03 to 15 million gallons per year (MGPY)), and averaging to 18.9 MLPY (i.e., ~5 MGPY). Since the initial HRJ biorefineries are expected to be of smaller sizes, the biorefinery size for this analysis was considered to be 18.9 MLPY (i.e., 5 MGPY). Ohio was selected as the case study region as there is an estimated ~0.6 million ha land under corn-soybean rotation in Ohio which can annually be used to produce ~1.1 million t/yr pennycress grain [45]. This could be used to produce ~210 MLPY of HRJ [45]. In addition to supplying a significant amount of feedstock for HRJ, establishing pennycress in these lands would provide economic benefits for the farmers and environmental benefits, e.g., reduction of soil erosion and run-off, for the ecosystem. To quantify the inventory of pennycress production and logistics operations, a techno-economic model of feedstock production, and harvest and post-harvest logistics to supply feedstock for the selected biorefinery capacity was developed in Microsoft Excel, for which the main parameters are presented in Table S1. In addition, a techno-economic model comprising of the oil extraction, oil conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment, and energy (electricity and steam) generation was developed in SuperPro Designer software v10 [46], and the mass rates of inputs, outputs and emissions for the selected biorefinery capacity were estimated. OpenLCA software [47] was used as an auxiliary tool for estimating the life cycle environmental impacts associated with the use of inputs, and emissions through the defined system boundary, using the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI) [48] method. The inventories of background processes for the inputs and outputs throughout the defined system were taken from Ecoinvent v3.2 [49], USCLI [50], and USDA crop databases [51]. Finally, the LCA model was developed integrating the inventories obtained from these different models to quantify the life cycle energy and environmental impacts of the pennycress-based HRJ. Uncertainty was analyzed using the Monte-Carlo simulations approach. 2.1.2 System overview The product system for pennycress-based HRJ includes pennycress production, logistics operations, oil extraction and conversion through the hydroprocessing pathway, wastewater treatment, and energy generation (Fig. 1). 2.1.2.1 Pennycress production and logistics operations This study considered the incorporation of pennycress, as a winter annual crop, between corn and soybean, which requires aerial seeding of pennycress seeds in September before harvest of corn [35]. Available land under corn-soybean rotation was considered to be used for pennycress production, without any need for additional land. Other inputs for pennycress production and logistics operation were considered to be used specifically for pennycress production. Field operations were considered to be fertilizer and herbicide applications, and grain harvest using traditional small grain combine harvesters in June before planting soybean [52]. Transportation of pennycress grain to the elevator and biorefinery locations were considered to be through the road using trucks. Pennycress grain drying and storage were considered at the elevator. Recommended moisture content for harvest of small grains is 12%, and that for storage to prevent grain spoilage is ~8% [35], which were considered for this analysis. This study considered pennycress grain to be harvested at 11–13% moisture content, and to be stored at 8% moisture content, after drying process (Table S1). More details of establishing pennycress production and logistics system are presented in the literature [35]. 2.1.2.2 Pennycress oil extraction and conversion to HRJ Currently, there is no commercial facility for pennycress oil extraction; so, this study made some assumptions by considering similar oilseeds, such as canola. Pennycress grain handling and conditioning are usually needed before oil extraction at the biorefinery, as suggested in the literature [53]. Grain conditioning includes cleaning, drying, flaking, and preheating. Considering the relatively high oil content of pennycress grain, mechanical oil extraction through the screw press is needed before solvent extraction, as suggested in the literature [53]. This process can extract ~60% of oil [53], and make the solvent extraction more efficient and economical. n-hexane solvent was considered for oil extraction from pennycress grain presscake, as suggested in the literature [53]. Pennycress oil contains C14 to C24 fatty acids [52], which can be processed into small chains for hydrocarbon fuels. Hydroprocessing technology for conversion of pennycress oil to HRJ includes hydrogenation, hydrocracking and separation processes. During the hydrogenation, which is conducted at the operating temperature of 300˚C, and pressure of 3 MPa, and at the presence of a catalyst, e.g., Platinum on Aluminum (Pt/ɣ-Al2O3) [8], a large amount of hydrogen is used to remove available oxygen in fatty acids of pennycress oil. Three reactions are conducted during the hydrogenations, including hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation, as explained in the literature [54]. The process flow, which contains hydrocarbons mainly in the range of C15 to C22, is then treated with hydrocracking reaction, in which the long hydrocarbons are broken down to smaller ones in the range of HRJ, so that the main product after this step meets the requirements of the HRJ cloud point [55]. During the separation processes, the main product, i.e., HRJ, and different byproducts, i.e., LPG, naphtha, and green diesel, are separated through the distillation mechanism [56]. 2.1.2.3 On-site energy generation and wastewater treatment Currently, there is no commercial use of pennycress meal as the byproduct; so, this study considered pennycress meal to be used as the boiler fuel to generate steam and electricity using turbine-generator. However, identifying new application of pennycress meal in the future may affect the results of this analysis. Use of meal derived after oil extraction of sunflower and rapeseed [57,58], soybean [58], and palm [59] as the boiler fuel has been previously suggested in the literature. This study also considered the wastewater generated throughout the oil extraction and conversion processes to be treated using anaerobic digestion to generate biogas as fuel for the boiler for steam and electricity generations. Part of energy from burning pennycress meal and biogas was considered to be used to generate high-pressure steam to meet the steam requirement for the oil extraction and biorefinery processes. The remaining steam was considered to be used to generate electricity through turbine-generator, part of which was used to meet electricity required for the processes. The excess electricity was considered to be supplied to the grid."
3,Inventory analysis,"2.2 Inventory analysis Inventory analysis included quantifying the inputs, direct emissions, and main product and byproducts for the defined system at the selected biorefinery capacity. 2.2.1 Pennycress production and logistics operations Inputs for pennycress production (planting, fertilization and spraying), and harvest included pennycress seeds, synthetic fertilizers (N, P2O5, S, K2O), pesticides (herbicide), and farm operational requirements. Fertilizer requirement for pennycress production was estimated based on nutrient removal from the field through harvest of pennycress grain, and it is presented in Table S1. The details on fertilizer application regime for pennycress production are available in the literature [35], and were considered for this analysis. The depreciated weight of machinery (aerial seeders, farm machinery and equipment, combine harvester and grain cart); use of jet fuel for aerial seeders, and diesel and lubricant for farm machinery and harvesters; and labor (operator) needed for different farm operations were quantified using the methodology presented in the literature [60]. Transportation of grain from the pennycress field to the elevator was estimated as a function of pennycress harvest and transportation distance, as discussed in the literature [35]. Depreciation of different equipment used for pennycress drying and storage at the elevator, as well as electricity needed for the facilities, natural gas needed for drying, and labor requirement were estimated, as discussed in the previous study [35]. Direct emissions for the defined system boundary included emissions associated with the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the field, combustion of diesel fuel during farm operations, and combustion of natural gas for grain drying. Use of synthetic fertilizers in the field results in different types of direct emissions, mainly to air, water, and soil, causing different environmental impacts [61]. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to air associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer in the field were quantified, following the method suggested by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [61]: (1) N 2 O N,inputs - N = F SN + F CR × 0.01 where N2ON , inputs-N (in kgN2O-N) represents the annual direct N2O-N (N2O as N) emissions associated with soil management; FSN (in kg N) represents the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied to soil; and FCR (in kg N) is the amount of nitrogen available in crop residue which is returned to the soil after harvest; the coefficient of 0.01 is the estimated N2O emissions ratio of N from different sources, in kg N2O-N/kg, as suggested in the literature [61]. Nitrate (NO3 −), as a consequence of nitrogen fertilizers application, is emitted to the soil and water bodies mainly due to nutrient leaching [61]. It is estimated that ~30% of N applied in the form of synthetic fertilizers leaches to the soil [61], and was, thus, considered in this study. Application of N sources in the field, in addition to ammonium (NH4 +) transformation in the agricultural soil, leads to nitrate emissions to the water bodies, and consequently the eutrophication impacts [61]. CO2 sequestered during the production process of urea is the main source of emissions from application of this fertilizer in the field. The CO2-C (CO2 as C) emissions from urea are estimated to be 20% of total urea applied in the field [61], which was considered in this study. In addition, fertilizer application in the field indirectly causes N2O emissions due to atmospheric deposition of synthetic fertilizers, which depends on the fraction of applied N that volatizes in the forms of NH3 and NOx, and the amount of volatized N which is transformed to N2O [61]. During denitrification processes in the soil, there are NOx emissions, which were measured following the method suggested by IPCC [61]: (2) N O x = 0.21 × N 2 O Phosphorous (P2O5) associated with phosphorous fertilizer application in the field is partially emitted to water resources, causing freshwater eutrophication [60]. Leaching, run-off and soil erosion are the main reasons for phosphorus emissions. The phosphorus environmental emissions to water were estimated by assuming that 5% of phosphorus fertilizer applied to the soil is emitted, as suggested in the literature [61]. 2.2.2 Oil extraction and conversion, wastewater treatment and energy generation Inputs for the biorefinery phase (pennycress oil extraction, conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment and energy generation) included equipment, materials (hydrogen, pennycress grain, and catalyst), labor, and utilities (electricity, steam, and natural gas). Choice of catalyst is important as it can affect the yield [34]. This study considered use of Platinum on Aluminum (Pt/ɣ-Al2O3) catalyst, as suggested in the literature [8]. In addition, hydrogen and catalyst were considered to be partially recycled from the process and their additional requirements to be supplied from external sources, as suggested in the literature [8]. Process model for the selected pennycress-based HRJ biorefinery was developed using SuperPro Designer software. Material flow, energy generation and utilities requirement rates for pennycress oil extraction and conversion to HRJ at the selected biorefinery capacity were estimated and summarized in Table 1 [45]. The yield levels were comparable to those reported in the literature [34]. This research considered storage of pennycress grain to ensure continuous supply of pennycress grain for operation of crushing and conversion facilities throughout the year. Thus, the annual operating time of the process model for the selected HRJ biorefinery capacity was assumed to be 7920 h, considering 330 operational days per year [45]. Direct emissions during the oil extraction and conversion processes included emissions associated with fuel combustion, as well as generated waste and CO2 emissions during the chemical processes, which were estimated through process modeling. The main processes contributing to the CO2 emissions were hydrogenation and hydrocracking due to generation of CO2 in chemical reactions and release of emissions in the separation processes. In addition, wastewater treatment through anaerobic digestion contributed to CO2 emissions. Methane leakage during the anaerobic digestion was not considered for this analysis. Direct energy associated with the use of liquid fuels, electricity and natural gas, and embodied (indirect) energy associated with the use of materials (pennycress grain, solvent, hydrogen, catalyst, and citric acid), and depreciated weight of machinery, equipment, and infrastructure were also estimated to build the inventory of life cycle energy use for pennycress-based HRJ production."
4,Life cycle energy and environmental impacts assessment,"2.3 Life cycle energy and environmental impacts assessment Environmental impacts were assessed by following the TRACI (v2.1) [48] method, which considers 10 different environmental impact categories, including acidification, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, global warming, human health-carcinogenics and non-carcinogenics, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation, resource depletion in the form of fossil fuels, and respiratory effects. Energy equivalents of inputs and outputs (Table 2 ) were used for quantifying the input and output energies during the life cycle of pennycress-based HRJ production. Energy inputs were estimated through quantifying the direct and indirect energies of consumables, machinery, and equipment for the defined system boundary. Total energy input was estimated based on the summation of direct and indirect energies used during the life cycle of the product, i.e., pennycress-based HRJ. Energy output at the biorefinery gate was quantified through estimating the calorific values of HRJ as the main product, and naphtha, LPG, green diesel, and electricity as the byproducts. Energy indicators were estimated using the following equations [62]: (3) Energy u s e e f f i c i e n c y = Energy o f p r o d u c t ( M J / u n i t o f p r o d u c t ) Total e n e r g y u s e d f o r p r o d u c t i o n ( M J / u n i t o f p r o d u c t ) (4) Specific e n e r g y i n p u t = Total e n e r g y i n p u t ( M J ) HRJ p r o d u c e d ( L ) (5) Net e n e r g y g a i n = E n e r g y o u t p u t MJ GJ of HRJ - E n e r g y i n p u t MJ GJ of HRJ Energy use efficiency of a product (pennycress grain or HRJ) is an estimate of the ratio between the calorific value of the product and total energy used for its production. It is an important indicator for identifying the suitability of crops as biofuels feedstocks, from the energy perspective. Specific energy input of a product measures the energy intensity during the production processes, and it is estimated based on the ratio between the total energy used during the production process and the quantity of the product. Net energy gain is the difference between the total calorific values of the products and the total energy used for producing them. Positive value of net energy gain shows that energy is gained during the product life cycle, while negative value of net energy gain indicates that energy is lost during the product life cycle."
5,Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses,"2.4 Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses Monte-Carlo simulations approach [77], based on 20,000 randomized trials, was used to evaluate the uncertainties caused by the variability of the input parameters presented in Table S1. Different parameters used for uncertainty analysis were the same as those used for evaluation of the technical feasibility and costs of pennycress production and logistics operations, as presented in the literature [35]. Triangular distribution was defined for parameters for which no other distribution could be justified based on the available data. The key parameters used for uncertainty analysis, their range of variation, and their distribution functions came from previous work [35], and are summarized in Table S1. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify the parameters that mainly affect the life cycle energy and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ, as presented in Table S1. These parameters could be considered for improving the energy and environmental performances of the pennycress-based HRJ production, and for developing strategies to establish a sustainable pennycress-based HRJ production system in the region."
6,Results and discussion,"Unless otherwise stated, all the results presented in this section are 90% central range (CR), or confidence range, representing the range of 5th and 95th percentiles of the probability distributions of different parameters. Based on the energy contents of the main product and different byproducts, the estimated shares of LPG, naphtha, HRJ, green diesel and electricity from total energy output were ~1%, ~2%, ~36%, ~21% and ~40%, respectively. Thus, as this study considers use of the energy allocation approach, ~36% of the total energy and environmental impacts were allocated to the life cycle of pennycress-based HRJ."
7,Life cycle energy analysis of pennycress-based HRJ production,"3.1 Life cycle energy analysis of pennycress-based HRJ production Considering the energy allocation approach, total energy input of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 180–260 MJ/GJ of HRJ (Fig. 2 ). Pennycress production contributed to 35–50% of the total energy input, out of which 70–84% was contributed by the pennycress fertilization (Fig. 2). Energy use from nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, potassium, and fertilizer application operations were estimated to be 48.6–69.2, 0.7–1.0, 7.2–10.3, 3.5–4.9, and 2.7–3.8 MJ/GJ of HRJ, respectively. These results are consistent with those of previous studies, in which nitrogen fertilizer was identified as the main energy-consuming input for the production of similar oilseeds, such as canola [65] and camelina [78]. In contrast, some studies have recommended no nitrogen application for planting winter (cover) crops in corn-soybean rotation [79]. However, nitrogen plays a vital role in pennycress growth and grain formation [78]; and intensive pennycress production at the large-scale would require nitrogen, and other nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur and potassium, to compensate for the nutrients removed by the grain harvest [80]. In this context, soil nutrient management in corn-pennycress-soybean production system can potentially reduce fertilizer need for pennycress, through making the use of nutrients available in the soil after corn harvest [80]. Oil extraction and conversion was estimated to be the second main energy-consuming process of HRJ production, contributing to 30–40% of the total input energy (Fig. 2). This was mainly due to the use of hydrogen (55.5–77.4 MJ/GJ of HRJ) for hydrogenation and hydrocracking processes, as well as solvent for oil extraction (6.3–8.7 MJ/GJ of HRJ). Even though the study considered hydrogen recovery for the process, use of make-up hydrogen, to meet the hydrogen need for the conversion processes, significantly affected the total energy use, mainly due to high energy use in hydrogen production processes [70]. Currently, ~95% of hydrogen production in the U.S. is coming from steam methane reforming of natural gas [81], which is also dominant technology in the U.S. Midwest and Ohio [82]. Other main energy-consuming processes were identified to be grain harvest, storage and drying. Energy use in harvest operation was mainly due to the use of diesel fuel by combine harvesters in the field. Electricity was the main source of energy for grain handling and conveying at the elevator, and air conditioning during the storage. Use of grain dryers, fueled by natural gas, was considered for grain drying to reduce the moisture content before storage. Since pennycress production was the main contributor to the overall input energy, energy use efficiency and specific energy input of pennycress grain production (energy use per metric ton of grain) were compared with those of similar oilseeds, such as camelina [24], canola [65,83–85], soybean [86,87], sunflower [88–91], and carinata [92] (Fig. 3 ). Estimated specific energy input for pennycress grain production (2.6–3.5 MJ/kg) was comparable to that of camelina (3.6 ± 0.4 MJ/kg) and carinata (4.3 ± 1.7 MJ/kg), but, on an average, it was one-third of that of soybean (9.4 ± 3.2 MJ/kg) and sunflower (8.5 ± 2.6 MJ/kg), and half of that of canola (5.6 ± 1.1 MJ/kg). These results indicate that lower energy is used for the production of pennycress grain compared to that of canola, soybean and sunflower oilseeds, which was mainly due to lower fertilizer and pesticide required for pennycress production. In addition, incorporating pennycress as a winter annual crop between corn and soybean would require minimal farm operations during the winter months, and thus, would minimize energy use for farm operations. Despite low inputs requirements, the oil yield of pennycress is comparable to that of similar oilseeds. In addition, estimated energy use efficiency of pennycress grain production was 6.4–8.5. Average energy use efficiency of pennycress grain production was 2-fold that of canola and sunflower, and 3-fold that of soybean, while it was comparable to that of camelina (Fig. 3). These results reflect the suitability of pennycress as a biofuel feedstock because of higher energy gain compared to energy use during its production processes. Energy use efficiency of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 3.9–5.5 (Table 3 ), which indicates that energy output of HRJ was on average 3.6 times higher than total energy input for HRJ and byproducts production; thus, there is a net energy gain of 740–820 MJ/GJ in pennycress-based HRJ production (Table 3). In addition, estimated specific energy input of pennycress-based HRJ production was found to be 6–9 MJ/L of HRJ (Table 3), which was only ~20% of the calorific value of HRJ, i.e., 34.4 MJ/L [69]. Lower specific energy input than calorific value exhibits its potential as a sustainable aviation biofuel from the energy perspective. Estimated energy use efficiency of HRJ production from pennycress was ~2 times of that from camelina in western Washington, USA, i.e., 1.8 [24], and it was ~5 times of overall energy output to input ratio of jet fuel production from conventional crude oil (0.83–0.94) [93]."
8,Environmental impacts of HRJ production from pennycress,"3.2 Environmental impacts of HRJ production from pennycress Environmental impacts allocated to pennycress-based HRJ production and the contribution of different sources are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. In addition, the values of environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production are listed in Table S2. Considering the main contribution of pennycress fertilization to most of the impact categories, the share of different sources to the environmental impacts of pennycress fertilization is presented in Fig. 6 ; and the contribution of different sources to the environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production, excluding fertilization, is presented in Fig. 7 . In addition, the share of different sources to the environmental impacts associated with oil extraction and conversion processes is presented in Fig. 8 . 3.2.1 Acidification potential Terrestrial acidification of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 0.45–0.65 kg SO2eq/GJ (Fig. 4), which was comparable with the acidification potential of Jet-A, i.e., 0.34–0.42 kg SO2eq/GJ [94,95] (Table S2). Terrestrial acidification is mainly caused by different acidifying substances, such as NH3, NOx, and SOx emissions, to the soil, groundwater, surface water, and air [96]. ~93% of the acidification potential related to pennycress-based HRJ was associated with the pennycress production (planting, fertilization and spraying) (Fig. 5), and was primarily caused by the direct in-field emissions due to nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfate fertilizers application in the field (Fig. 6). Fuel combustion for machine and equipment operations was also the second major cause of acidification, mainly due to SOx emissions (Fig. 7). Lower acidification of pennycress-based HRJ compared to that of renewable jet fuel from lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., 0.47–0.88 kg SO2eq/GJ [95]) was mostly related to less nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfate fertilizer requirement, and also less field operations for pennycress production. 3.2.2 Ecotoxicity potential Aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 62.4–86.9 CTUe/GJ (Fig. 4), which was almost one-third of that of Jet-A, i.e., 234 CTUe/GJ [95] (Table S2). This impact category measures the consequences of emissions on the water and land-based ecosystems. Synthetic chemicals, such as herbicide, synthetic fertilizers, as well as metal-based materials, such as catalyst, are the main contributors to the ecotoxicity potential of pennycress-based HRJ production [97]. More than 60% of ecotoxicity potential of pennycress-based HRJ was due to fertilization (Fig. 5), mainly caused by emissions during the fertilizer production processes (Fig. 6). Other than fertilization, ecotoxicity potential was mainly caused by emissions during the oil extraction and conversion (Fig. 7), which was mainly due to use of chemicals, especially catalyst and hydrogen during the conversion processes as well as manufacture of biorefinery facilities (Fig. 8). 3.2.3 Eutrophication potential Eutrophication potential of HRJ production was estimated to be 0.7–1.0 kg Neq/GJ (Fig. 4), which was higher than that of Jet-A, i.e., 0.22 kg Neq/GJ [95] (Table S2), but ~70% less than that of canola-based HRJ production [10]. This was mainly due to less fertilizer use for pennycress production, compared to canola. Eutrophication is mainly related to leaching of nitrogen and phosphorous-related micronutrients, such as N, NOx, NH4 +, and PO4 3−, from the agricultural land, which typically load on the water bodies [98]. Overall eutrophication potential of pennycress-based HRJ was dominated by fertilization (0.67–0.80 kg Neq/GJ) (Fig. 5). Contributions of direct and indirect emissions of fertilization, to the total eutrophication potential of pennycress-based HRJ were estimated to be ~96% and ~4%, respectively (Fig. 6). This signifies the huge contribution of in-field emissions due to fertilizers application to the overall eutrophication potential of pennycress-based HRJ. Regional concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in Lake Erie in Ohio has already caused major issues; and most of the nutrients entering this water body comes from non-point sources, such as agricultural land [99]. Adjusting fertilizer application based on nutrient removal rates due to grain harvest would minimize fertilizer use and nutrient loads to this water body [100]. 3.2.4 Global warming potential Global warming potential through the life cycle of HRJ was estimated to be 35–49 kg CO2eq/GJ (Fig. 4). It is mainly caused by GHG emissions to air [96]. Global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was considerably lower than the life cycle GHG emissions of petroleum-derived jet fuel, i.e., 89 kg CO2eq per GJ of Jet-A [13] (Table S2). Previous studies have also estimated the life cycle GHG emissions of HRJ production from similar oilseeds, including soybean, palm, rapeseed, jatropha [26] and camelina [24], to be 41–63% less than those of petroleum-based jet fuel. In addition, global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was ~60% less than that of canola-based HRJ production [10], comparable to that of sunflower (~42 kg CO2eq/GJ) [2], and towards the lower side of the range of GHG emissions of renewable jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass (poplar) (32–73 kg CO2eq/GJ) [101]. More than 50% of global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was contributed to fertilization (Fig. 5), out of which the estimated contributions of fertilizers in-field emissions, fertilizers production, and fertilizer application were 65%, 34% and 1%, respectively (Fig. 6). CO2, N2O and NOx emissions to air were the main contributors to the global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ production. Lower global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ compared to that of canola-based HRJ [10] was mainly due to lower fertilizer and farm operations needed for pennycress production, compared to canola. Planting pennycress as a winter crop in corn-soybean cropping system is advantageous, as the crop has access to the excess nutrients from previous crop (i.e., corn); and thus, the fertilizer requirement is low [102]. Since this study considered the nutrient removal methodology to estimate the nutrient requirements for pennycress production, incorporation of crop residues, after harvest, into soil would reduce the nutrient removal from the field, and thus it will reduce the fertilizer requirement. The other main sources of global warming potential were pennycress oil extraction and conversion, followed by grain harvest, and drying (Fig. 7). Global warming potential effect of oil extraction and conversion processes was dominated by direct CO2 emissions during the oil extraction, hydrogenation and hydrocracking processes, followed by emissions associated with production of hydrogen (Fig. 8). Use of green hydrogen from renewable resources can be considered as a potential option to reduce the environmental impacts. While, relative contribution of catalyst used for the hydrogenation of pennycress oil to the global warming potential was not significant (Fig. 8). These results are consistent with those of a previous study [103] in which less than 1% of the overall biorefinery GHG emissions were caused by the catalyst. In another study, Snowden-Swan et al. [104] reported the contribution of catalyst to the total GHG emissions of oil-to-aviation biofuel conversion to be 0.5–5%, depending on the byproduct treatment and use. This study considered use of Pt/ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst for hydrogenation of pennycress oil. The platinum group metal content of this catalyst ranges within 0.1–5.0% [105]. 3.2.5 Human health impacts Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic potential impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production were estimated to be 7.2–9.8 × 10−7 and 2.8–3.8 × 10−6 CTUh/GJ, respectively (Fig. 4), which were lower than those of Jet-A, i.e., 12.2 × 10−7 and 11.9 × 10−6 CTUh/GJ, respectively [95] (Table S2). These impact categories are related to the use of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic substances in the life cycle of pennycress-based HRJ, and they account for the life cycle chemical fate, effect, and damage of toxic chemicals, which affect the human health [106]. Pennycress fertilization was the main contributor to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic-related human health impacts by 41% and 68%, respectively. Emissions during fertilizer production were the primary sources of both the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic potential impacts (Fig. 6). These results are in-line with those of a previous study [107] in which feedstock cultivation, especially fertilization, and conversion to biofuel were identified as the major contributors to the potential human health impacts through the life cycle of aviation biofuels production. The second main contributor to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic potential impacts was oil extraction and conversion, contributing to 33% and 11% of the respective environmental impacts (Fig. 5); and they were mainly caused by use of hydrogen and catalyst, as well as manufacture of biorefinery facilities (Fig. 8). 3.2.6 Ozone depletion potential Estimated ozone depletion potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was in the range of 1.7–2.3 × 10−6 kg CFC−11eq/GJ (Fig. 4). Ozone depletion is mainly caused by ultraviolet-B radiation to the surface of the Earth [96]. Use of ozone depleting substances in the manufacture of chemical fertilizers, i.e., urea, ammonium sulfate and phosphate, was the main contributor to the ozone depletion potential of pennycress-based HRJ (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the results reported in the literature [108]. The second contributor was manufacture of chemicals used for oil extraction and conversion processes at the biorefinery, such as hydrogen and solvent (Fig. 8). 3.2.7 Photochemical ozone formation potential Photochemical ozone formation potential of HRJ production was estimated to be 1.5–2.2 kgO3eq/GJ (Fig. 4), which was considerable lower than those of Jet-A, i.e., 10.0 kgO3eq/GJ [95], and renewable jet fuel from lignocellulosic biomass, i.e., 9.6–11.0 kgO3eq/GJ [95] (Table S2). This impact category measures the consequences of reagents, mainly ozone, whose existence impacts the human health and ecosystem [96]. Photochemical ozone formation mainly occurs when ozone precursors, e.g., NOx, CO and SOx, are chemically react at the presence of the ultra-violate spectrum of sunlight [109]. The main sources of ozone precursors is operation of machines and industrial facilities, such as power plants for electricity generation [110]. Fertilization, harvest and oil extraction and conversion were identified as the major contributors to the photochemical ozone formation potential of HRJ (Fig. 7). More specifically, major sources of ozone precursors include NOx emissions from fertilizer application in the field, CO and SOx emissions from diesel combustion by agricultural machinery and harvesters as well as natural gas burning by dryers, and emissions during the manufacture of chemical fertilizers, including urea, ammonium sulfate, phosphate and potassium. Direct CO emissions during the hydrogenation and propane clave were also the major cause of photochemical ozone formation potential (Fig. 8). 3.2.8 Resources depletion potential Estimated resources depletion potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was 2.1–3.0 MJ surplus/GJ (Fig. 4), which was mainly caused by production of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizer (Fig. 6), use of diesel fuel by combine harvesters (Fig. 5), and production of hydrogen used for conversion processes (Fig. 8). Resources depletion refers to the extraction of fossil sources, e.g., minerals and fuels, as well as the use of land and water throughout the life cycle of pennycress-based HRJ production. It is an important metric for evaluating the sustainability of a product system. Surplus energy is a measure for taking into account the quality degradation of the part of resources still available when it is extracted over time [111]. This study did not consider land use change due to pennycress establishment as it was assumed that the crop would be incorporated into the corn-soybean rotation, which is the most potential case [17]. So, resources depletion in pennycress-based HRJ production is mainly related to the use of fossil resources, and it was considerably lower than fossil fuel through the life cycle of the conventional jet fuel (~1200 MJ/GJ) [101]. It was also considerably less than fossil fuel use through the life cycle of renewable jet fuel produced from lignocellulosic biomass, i.e., 700–850 MJ/GJ [101]. The large difference is interpreted by higher use of chemicals, mainly enzymes, for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and conversion to renewable jet fuel [101]. Manufacture of enzymes requires a considerable amount of heat and steam during their production process, which consequently requires natural gas, and thus causes fossil fuel depletion due to its acquisition and production [101]. In addition, this study considered the steam and electricity requirements for oil extraction and conversion processes to be supplied through on-site energy generation system fueled by renewable resources, i.e., pennycress meal and biogas, and thus reduces the resources depletion potential of pennycress-based HRJ production. 3.2.9 Respiratory effects Respiratory effect potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 1.7–2.5 × 10−2 kg PM2.5eq/GJ (Fig. 4), which was considerably lower than that of Jet-A, i.e., 12 × 10−2 kg PM2.5eq/GJ [94] (Table S2). In addition, it was dominated by fertilization of pennycress (Fig. 5), and production of hydrogen used during the conversion process (Fig. 8). Respiratory effects are related to several of the environmental pollutants that are detrimental to human respiratory health. Respiratory effect potential of pennycress-based HRJ production was also lower than that of HRJ production from soy oil, i.e., 13 × 10−2 kg PM2.5eq/GJ [94]. Lower respiratory effects of pennycress-based HRJ exhibits that replacing fossil jet fuel with pennycress-based HRJ reduces the abundance of these emissions in the environment. Similar results were reported in a previous study on life cycle environmental impacts of renewable jet fuel production from residual lignocellulosic biomass [95]."
9,Sensitivity analysis,"3.3 Sensitivity analysis Pennycress yield was one of the key parameters affecting the energy and environmental impact indicators of pennycress-based HRJ production (Fig. 9 ). Increasing pennycress yield would increase the overall output energy, and consequently energy use efficiency, by reducing the energy use per unit of product, provided that the energy use for pennycress production remains constant. This would also increase the net energy gain allocated to pennycress-based HRJ production. In addition, pennycress yield showed high influences on most of the environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ. Increasing the yield would reduce the environmental impacts allocated to HRJ production, mainly due to less inputs and resources used during the pennycress production. This is consistent with the results of previous study [112] in which feedstock production was identified as the main contributor to the total GHG emissions of HRJ production from camelina oil in Canadian prairies. The same result was reported in analyzing the environmental impacts of biodiesel production from oilseeds [113]. Nitrogen fertilizer use for pennycress production also showed high sensitivity to the energy and environmental impacts indicators of pennycress-based HRJ production (Fig. 9). This was mainly due to high energy use during the production processes of nitrogen fertilizers. Less nitrogen fertilizer use for pennycress production would significantly improve the energy use efficiency due to reducing total energy input. In addition, application of nitrogen fertilizers in the field causes direct emissions in the forms of CO2, N2O, and NOx, and consequently global warming potential impact. Nitrogen losses from the field also create nutrient load on the water bodies, and consequently eutrophication. Use of manure fertilizers would reduce synthetic fertilizer requirement for pennycress production. In addition, nutrient management in corn-soybean rotation would reduce fertilizer requirement for pennycress production. Use of best management practices for crop fertilization, especially during the winter months, is needed to reduce nutrient losses and associated environmental impacts. Phosphorus fertilizer, even though is not considered as energy-intensive input, has a high impact on several of the environmental impact categories of pennycress-based HRJ production (Fig. 9). These results are in-line with those reported in the literature [113,114], in which fertilization was the main operation affecting the overall environmental impacts of biofuels production. For instance, Carvalho et al. [113] assessed the environmental footprints of biodiesel production from solaris seed tobacco, and reported that GHG emissions were mainly contributed by feedstock production, especially due to the emissions associated with the use of fertilizers. Zaher [114] evaluated the environmental impacts of feedstock production for aviation biofuels, and reported that reducing chemical fertilizer use had a significant impact on minimizing their life cycle environmental impacts. Moisture content at harvest was also among the main factors inversely affecting energy use efficiency and net energy gain, and directly influencing the environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ (Fig. 9). The high impact of grain moisture content can be justified by higher natural gas requirement for drying pennycress grain to store them safely. Harvest date is an important factor affecting moisture content of grain, and consequently the need for grain drying before storage. Harvesting pennycress grain at the moisture content less than the recommended level (~12%) would decrease the need for drying and thus minimize the energy use. An optimum harvest date is required to prevent high energy use for drying as well as grain losses during the harvest. In addition, design and development of combine headers featured for pennycress would improve the field capacity and reduce grain quality losses during the harvest [115]. The other important factors affecting energy and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ were fuel use for harvest and depreciated weight of combine harvester (Fig. 9), mainly due to high fuel use during the harvest. Harvesting grain at higher moisture content, in addition to increasing the drying energy requirement, reduces the performance of combine harvester, due to lower feeding rate, and consequently increases the fuel use for harvest [116]. Overall, evaluation of energy use and environmental impacts of HRJ production from pennycress implies that pennycress could potentially serve as a promising feedstock for HRJ production in the region, while it can also fit as a winter crop in corn-soybean cropping system to provide energy, economic and environmental benefits. In addition, pennycress yield was identified as the main parameter affecting energy use and environmental footprints of HRJ production, which was in-line with the results previously reported on potential environmental impacts of camelina-based HRJ production [112]. Since pennycress is a new HRJ feedstock, and there are research studies going on toward improving the yield and the quality of grain and oil [23,117], such improvements are expected for the future. In addition, it is assumed that the improvements would be through genetic modification of crop, instead of increasing fertilizer and pesticide applications. These modifications would improve the sustainability of pennycress supply as HRJ feedstock. Since this study assumed incorporation of pennycress as a winter crop in existing corn-soybean cropping system, no direct and indirect environmental impacts due to land-use change were considered, in that, it was assumed that planting pennycress will not impact the production of other agricultural crops. Similar assumption has been made in a previous analysis [15]. This study evaluated the LCA of pennycress-based HRJ production considering establishment of this crop in the Midwestern U.S. However, the analyses are applicable to a global scope, considering the recent interest in pennycress production in a wide range of geographic region, other than the U.S., including parts of Germany [118], Italy and Greece [38], Canada, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America [119]."
10,Conclusions,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the life cycle environmental impacts of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The system boundary included pennycress production, harvest and post-harvest logistics, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment, and electricity and steam generation. Using the life cycle assessment approach, environmental impacts associated with 1 GJ of HRJ were estimated. It is concluded that pennycress production requires less nitrogen, pesticides, and farm operations compared to similar HRJ feedstocks, e.g., canola, soybean and lignocellulosic biomass, which leads to a reduction of overall environmental impacts and energy use for pennycress-based HRJ production compared to those of renewable jet fuel from similar feedstocks. Further reductions in overall energy use and environmental impacts would also be possible by improving the key parameters, including fertilization, pennycress yield, and farm practices. Fertilization was the main contributor (40–97%) to most of the environmental impact categories of pennycress-based HRJ production, mainly due to the direct and indirect emissions from nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Management of fertilizer application for pennycress could reduce environmental impacts. Hydrogen was also one of the main contributors to energy use and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production. Use of green hydrogen from renewable resources can be considered as a potential option to reduce the energy use and associated environmental impacts. In addition, genetic modifications of pennycress seeds towards increasing yield and oil content could help reduce the energy requirement and environmental footprint of HRJ production. Use of crop-specific combine harvesters for pennycress harvest would increase the performance and reduce fuel use. In addition, improvements in oil extraction and conversion processes to increase efficiency of processes and reduce direct emissions would reduce the overall environmental impacts. The outcomes of this work would help establish the performance targets towards minimizing the energy use and environmental impacts of pennycress-based HRJ production. Future work needs to focus on evaluating the compatibility of alternative feedstocks for HRJ production, improving pennycress yield and oil content, and evaluating the impact of alternative uses of pennycress meal on sustainability of pennycress-based HRJ production from energy and environmental perspectives."
