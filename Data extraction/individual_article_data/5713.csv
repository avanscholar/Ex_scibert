0,Introduction,"The utilization of fossil fuels raises queries among nations pertaining to the sustainability of energy resources and adverse environmental impacts. Alternative sources are constantly augmented by scientists as fuels and value-added products (Rittmann, 2008). Renewable sources of energy have been seen to be the answer for the issues faced in the Modern world in terms of energy and fuel substitutes. These green substitutes can accomplish the world's energy mandate (Saravanakumar et al., 2016). Apart from solar, tidal, geothermal, wind, and hydrothermal sources, a surplus amount of renewable biomass also promises to be a potential energy substitute. One of the most popular forms of renewable biomass would be lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). They constitute the decomposed or treated mass of wood. As the name suggests, lignin and cellulose are the main ingredients in LCB. The conversion of LCB to valuable products reduces pollution and conserves the deteriorating environment. In general, the LCB conversion requires a series of procedures in combination with various technologies to downstream quality products (Chen and Nielsen, 2016). The first step would be to disrupt the LCB to its native components by pretreatment. Pretreatment can be done in many ways like physical, chemical, biological approaches, etc. (Singh et al., 2019). This has been discussed in detail in the forthcoming sections of this review. Secondly, LCB components are hydrolyzed to release sugars with the help of enzymes or microorganisms. Finally, sugars are made into value-added products by microorganisms based on their cellular specifications (Li, 2014). Production of energy from food crops would cause a negative impact on global food availability and fertility of the land (Clark and Pazdernik, 2016). Hence non–food based biomass is used as the second-generation biofuels and precursors of several valuable chemicals. Inedible feedstocks, organic residues, inorganic and agricultural wastes, etc., are few examples of LCB (Li et al, 2016; Dutta and Saha, 2019). LCB mostly means unused in large quantities (around 1 × 1010 metric tons), which is big enough to cater to the energy and product demands of the world. Hence, the need for LCB is growing with every passing day. LCB is a network of hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose (Li, 2014). Cellulose is a glucose-containing biopolymer joined by β–glycosidic linkages. When bundled, they form microfibrils. Lignin surrounds this structure with hemicellulose in the intermediate sections. Hemicellulose consists of xylose arabinose, mannose, and galactose joined together to form branched heteropolymer–like structures (Singhvi and Gokhale, 2019). The sugar moiety found in excess in these heteropolymer does the nomenclature for hemicellulose, namely xylose containing as xylans, mannose containing as mannans, galactose containing as galactans, and arabinose containing as xyloglucans. In hardwood materials, Dylan is predominant, and in softwood glucomannan. Lignin is second in line based on availability after cellulose which provides protection and defensive shield-like coatings to plants from physical and biological attacks (Rubin, 2008). This heteropolymer is made up of hydroxyphenyl moieties. These are types of phenylpropanoid units like syringyl and guaiacyl (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013). On the economic front, processing lignin is a hurdle that industrialists and scientists are trying to overcome. The phenolic groups present in lignin monomers deactivated the enzymes, and microorganisms inoculated for pretreatment and hydrolysis (Beckham et al., 2016). Apart from hindering self–degradation, their presence restricts the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose also. Thus, requesting the need to remove lignin before pretreatment of LCB. Most commonly used LCB sources are corn cobs, stickers, sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, etc. Using conventional methods such as direct pretreatment and hydrolysis produce toxic byproducts with larger operational charges (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Hence, the newer and as well as better alternative processes and strategies are opted to have sustainable and economical ways of treating LCB. In recent years, nanobiotechnology has been the ultimate key to most of the complications emerging in LCB conversion. This technology provides value-added products not only from cellulose and hemicellulose but also from untreatable lignin. They consist of nanoparticles (NPs) (100–500 nm in dimension) that enhance enzymatic pretreatment, break additional bonds of the substrate, provide stability to enzymes to work at elevated experimental conditions, penetrate cellular membrane of LCB, aid in releasing sugars, etc. (Rai et al., 2017). They improvise physical, molecular, recovery, purification, and reusability properties of LCB and viable components associated with the process (Periyasamy et al., 2017). Despite all the promises, minimal evidence has been reported pertaining to the application of nanotechnology for LCB refineries (Verma, 2017). Their large surface area, high aspect ratios, and availability in various forms like nanocomposites, nanosheets, nanofibers, dots, etc., provide numerous advantages over commercial chemicals (Hokkanen et al., 2016). Final products obtained from nanotechnologically maneuvered processes have reported better absorption capacity and enhanced catalytic efficiency (Hokkanen et al., 2016). Minimal articles are published on nanomaterial-related LCB conversion for sugars, ethanol, and hydrogen production (Padil et al., 2018). This review focuses on the biopotential value-added products that could be attained by incorporating nanotechnology and NPs for the conversion of LCB. Each and every product has been addressed extensively with the processes and parameters associated with it. The ultimate aim is to provide insights for future researchers with cost–effective and environmentally friendly techniques available that could be opted for LCB conversion."
1,Relation between Lignocellulosic biomass and nanotechnology,"At the most atomic level, LCB is nanometer in size. It's constituent building blocks attain their remarkable properties due to the nano range size of the biomaterials. Even natural nanocomposites like abalone shells, bone, teeth, etc. owe their unique properties to the nanometer dimensioned building blocks. Products like paperboard, strand board, paper, and glulam beams are a result of nano range of wood. For instance, the paper that is used every day is an outcome of refined liberated fibrils or nanofibrils of cellulose. Although the mass is small, the surface area is enhanced dramatically in the nano range. As the number of these nano units rises in the parent material, the consequences are very significant. Nanoscience can be used to unlock the unrecognized potential of wood as ‘factories’ of rich photochemical sources deriving energy from water and sunlight. The merger between LCB and nanotechnology is causing the rise of sustainable growth in the fields of shelter, food, commerce, and clothing. It does not only meet the comfort needs but also environmental needs (Wegner and Philip Jones, 2009). It is critically essential to involve the various renewable sources of materials to be exploited in nanotechnology in conjunction with LCB to attain greater functionality as well as reduce environmental footprint. To define the relation between LCB and nanotechnology is sustainable development. To be precise, future generations should be able to enjoy the forest and its products in the same way as we do today. It has been noted that as the demand for goods increases, the economy shifts from an agricultural to a service-based industrial economy (Leong et al., 2021). Systemic economic progress is the ultimate outcome of utilizing nanotechnology for manufacturing goods. This has led to change in raw materials and their combinations used in the process. The most sought-after renewable raw material used in tons is LCB based materials (approximately 20%). Most of the natural commercial products like nacre, wool, silk, wood, clay, spider silk, etc., are made of constituents that range from 1 to 10 nm (Roco 2003). More than 700 components are available in the market that is made up of building blocks in nano range. They vary from clothes, cosmetics, devices, coatings, etc. The overall market value of products enabled by nanotechnology reached more than 9.4 billion dollars in the past few decades (Hullmann 2006). Nanocomposites currently occupy more than 80 % of the products available in the market. Nanotechnology can enhance the utilization and manufacturing of products efficiently in conserving energy resources, healthcare, agriculture, and information (Theodore et al., 2009). Nanoscience can extend the exploitation of LCB beyond fiber manufacturing and introduce novel approaches, products, and processes that can address issues faced by many nations. These issues could be anything ranging from climate change, energy security, and air–water quality. Nanotechnology with LCB can enable functionalities that would have opportunities in the pharmaceutical and electronic fields in thrm of self–sterilizing surfaces and sensors for pathogens. Nano techniques improve the drying and rewetting of wood-based products while conserving energy. The customizing of the products becomes even more feasible. The liquid biofuels have been successfully produced from LCB by nano approaches. The nanoscale structures of the trees can be easily disassembled for fermentation and catalytic conversion (Singh and Dwevedi, 2019). Nano catalysts also can be used to accelerate the sugar conversion to ethanol in recalcitrant cellulose. Systems of catalysts or enzymes (free or immobilized) can also be of great help to generate biofuels. These include expansions, lignin, glycol, hydrolases, etc. Natural nanoribbon (cellulose) has been tailored as specialized waveguides for visible light with antimony oxide (Ye et al., 2006). They are also used as electroactive paper for their unique piezoelectric nature, wound healing applications, and carbon nanotubes (Kim and Yun 2006). These nano dimensions unique structures self–assemble themselves into individual liquid crystals with performance higher than the best fiber that can be produced through technology (around 250 GP) ( Vincent 2002). Today, nanotechnology has many advanced and special tools to evaluate and discover commercial nanoscale architectures in the form of nanofibrils, nanocrystalline cellulose and cell wall architectures, etc. (Aizenberg et al. 2005). Hence the relation between nanoscience and LCB is intensely exploited in this review."
2,Role of nano catalyst in LCB,"Nanotechnology has prospective applications in various fields such as biosensors (ex. nano sensors to detect pathogens in food), biomedicine (ex. nanomaterials are used to attack cancer cells selectively), and biomedical fields (ex. diagnosis, bioimaging) (Mudhoo et al., 2019, Padil et al., 2018). Nanomaterials such as NPs, nanofibers, nanocomposites (NCs), and nanosheets have a very large surface area, quantum size, high catalytic efficiency, and greater adsorption capacity (Sharma et al., 2019, Hokkanen et al., 2016). NPs are employed in the treatment and breakdown of LCB due to their small size and easy penetration through microbial membranes. High surface area of NPs also gives them potential affinity towards microbes and their enzymes (Rai et al., 2016). Furthermore, magnetic NPs (MNP) are easily reusable and recyclable under strong magnetic fields (Periyasamy et al., 2018). For hydrolysis of LCB, enzymes such as cellulases, cellobiose, and hemicellulases are immobilized using nanomaterials (Zhang et al., 2015). Immobilization of enzymes using NPs, makes the whole LCB treatment viable and economical (Zhao et al., 2008)."
3,Role of nano catalysts for fuel generation,"3.1 Role of nano catalysts for fuel generation Metal-based nano catalysts in combinations with biomass have been reported to yield better quality biodiesel than conventionally produced methods. Cobalt or nickel NPs in conjugation with weeds like Carthamous oxyacantha can produce up to 65.4% esters containing fuels of enhanced quality at lower temperatures (400 °C). Among the mixed esters produced, 34% was found to be methanol, thus suggesting better energy efficiency of the fuel (Ali, 2020). Magnetic NPs have desired properties of high pore volume (0.1 cm3/g), acid density, and surface area (466 m2/g) that produce sugars in their reduced states by 97% under different experimental conditions. Their nano-size makes them stable even in acidic conditions (Rekha and Saravanathamizhan, 2021). Functionalized magnetic nano catalysts would generate a higher concentration of sugars (500 mg) and produce lesser toxic byproducts. Recovery of catalyst and processing of complex LCB like hemicellulose becomes much easier under the influence of these functionalized NPs. When used in combination with pretreatment, the yield of fuels becomes much higher when compared to other alternative strategies (Ingle, 2021; Ingle et al., 2017). A 5% presence of nano catalysts in the pretreated LCB can enhance lignin reduction by up to 47.4%. This can further aid in the production of sugars for fuel generation (Srivastava et al., 2021). Biomass pretreated with nanomaterials and nano techniques shows orderly arranged fibrils, vascular bundle exposure, abnormalities on the surface near pores, changes in functional groups between hemicellulose and lignin. Methane produced by pretreated biomass is 21% higher when compared to untreated counterparts (Mahajan et al., 2020)."
4,Enzyme immobilization on nanoparticles for Lignocellulosic biomass conversion,"Enzymes play a pivotal role in LCB processing (Patel et al., 2019). Their reaction with the substrate leads to the formation of products under a given set of conditions (Ahmad and Sardar, 2015). However, the utilization of enzymes incurs very high costs in the overall LCB conversion to biofuel (Singhania et al., 2021; Vaishnav et al., 2018). Hence, to make this method economically feasible, enzymes can be immobilized on NPs. Enzyme immobilization is defined as the confinement of an enzyme onto a matrix, thereby maintaining its activity and also reusing the enzyme repeatedly without losing its activity (Puri et al., 2013). Nanomaterials such as magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), iron NPs and nickel NPs are used widely as carriers for immobilizing enzymes. However, the NPs used for immobilization and catalytic application of LCB processing tend to penetrate the biomass's cell wall with great ease and efficiency. Thus, becoming more susceptible to the enzymatic attack for converting the carbohydrate (cellulose and hemicellulose) into simple sugars. Nanomaterials can drastically enhance the efficiency of immobilized enzymes as they provide a large surface area for enzyme attachment. This results in higher enzyme loading per unit mass of the particles (Grewal et al., 2017). Manos are being considered as potential candidates for enzyme immobilization. They impart benefits like enhanced stability, biocompatibility, mass transfer, etc. (Sánchez-Ramírez et al., 2017, Datta et al., 2013). Higher pH and temperature stability are reported in most of the studies pertaining to enzyme reactions associated with MNP. The binding efficacy increases by 90 %and reusability by 15 folds. Even 50 % of the activity still gets retained post-recovery (Kim et al., 2018). Generally, immobilization is performed using physical retention and chemical bonding methods. In physical retention, the enzymes are attached through membranes, whereas chemical bonding includes cross-linking and binding enzymes onto the support materials. The binding of enzymes on NPs can be achieved by three methods, namely, ionic binding, covalent binding, and adsorption entrapment. Enzyme immobilization by covalent bonding is the majorly used method in the industries because the interaction is attributed to the support material's function groups (Ahmad and Sardar, 2015). Both inorganic and organic support materials with different sizes, shapes, and porosity are used to immobilize enzymes. Inorganic support materials, for example, silica, zeolite, clays, and pumice, and manufactured materials such as alumina, glass, silica gel, ceramics, and magnetic materials are commonly used for enzyme immobilization. The organic support materials are composed of natural polymers such as starch, dextran, alginate, agar, and, chitosan) for enzyme immobilization (Puri et al., 2013). Enzyme immobilization cross–linking methods employ dialdehydes, carbodiimide–activated diamines, salts, etc., forming bonds with the support material and the catalyst (Pundir, 2015)."
5,Impact of nanomaterial on the enzyme properties,"4.1 Impact of nanomaterial on the enzyme properties Enhancing the stability of enzymes facilitates the biocatalysts to function under adverse conditions, including higher temperature and pH, thereby increasing the overall production of the desired product. It was reported that enzymes such as cellulose and hemicellulose immobilized onto nanomaterials have better stability than the free enzymes (Han et al., 2011, Taherdanak et al., 2016, Gadhe et al., 2015). Also, immobilized cellulases and hemicellulases can be reused for several cycles resulting in LCB conversion economically feasible. Enzyme immobilization improves the pH and temperature stability during enzymatic saccharification and microbial fermentation of LCB conversion (Ismail et al., 2011; Contreras et al., 2020). In addition, immobilization enhances the affinity of enzymes towards LB substrates, resulting in better hydrolysis of the biomass (Xu et al., 2011). The interaction of NPs with enzymes alters the latter's stability in terms of surface modifications. Concentration as well as the type of NPs opted for immobilization, influence the intermediate complex formation and immobilization (Jariyaboon et al., 2015, Kirli and Kapdan, 2016). It was demonstrated that immobilization of cellulases onto glutaraldehyde–based iron oxide (Fe3O4) NPs has better stability and can function under extreme pH and temperature than the free enzymes (Xu et al., 2011, Srivastava et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2014). In conclusion, the immobilization of enzymes onto NPs can increase the overall catalytic efficiency of LCB hydrolysis to produce simple sugars."
6,Role of immobilization for fuel generation,"4.2 Role of immobilization for fuel generation Immobilization of LCB degrading enzymes like cellulase and laccase with nanosheets and NPs enhanced the performance of enzymes by 14 IU/gds for extended durations and elevated temperatures (Shanmugam et al., 2020). To reduce the enzyme rejuvenation and implementation costs, immobilization is the most sought-after strategy. This also results in easy recovery, enhanced stability and reusability of enzymes. Immobilization influences the key attribute for LCB conversion to fuels, which is enzyme’s overall activity and stability. Enzymes can be exploited well to reap valuable benefits when immobilized. Thus, boosting the interest in biorefineries and energy products from LCB (Zanuso et al., 2021). Clostridium acetobutylicum immobilized on polyvinyl alcohol forms nanonetworks that have been used to produce alcohol additives like biobutanol for fuels from LCB. Immobilization using nanonetworks or nanomaterials increases the loading efficiency as well as protects the microbial and enzymatic cells from the toxicity of alcohols and fuels produced in the fermenter. Thus, reporting around 0.4 mol per mole of glucose production for fuel generation (Tsung-Yu et al., 2020)."
7,Importance of nanotechnology for the pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass,"Pretreatment is a very crucial step in biofuel production wherein LCB is converted to fermentable sugars. It is generally made up of 50% cellulose, 25% lignin and 30% hemicellulose (Madadi et al., 2017). Three major steps followed by LCB to generate valuable products are pretreatment, hydrolysis by enzymes and fermentation. The first step determines the overall cost of the refining process involving LCB (Sindhu et al., 2016). Several physical, chemical, and biological pretreatment methods have been used routinely for processing LCB. Still, there are certain limitations to the use of all of these methods on a large scale, which mainly include high processing costs, the generation of toxic inhibitors, and the detoxification of the inhibitors generated (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). To overcome the limitations of existing traditional methods, a novel, catalytically efficient, cost-effective, and eco–friendly strategy for the pretreatment of LCB has to be developed through nanotechnology. As an excellent alternative for conventional methods, pretreatment of LCB based on nanotechnology is studied extensively. Due to the smaller size of nanomaterials, they efficiently penetrate the LCB cell walls of LB. Therefore, nanomaterials can readily interact with the LCB components at low severity to release carbohydrates for biofuel production (Rai et al., 2016; Mosier et al., 2005). The effect of NPs on enzymes and their sugar yields are summarized in Table 1 ."
8,Pretreatment methods,
9,Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass by physical method,"6.1 Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass by physical method Physical methods of LCB pretreatment include (i) Milling and grinding; (ii) Steam explosion; (iii) AFEX (iv) Pyrolysis; (v) Pulsed electric field and; (vi) Ultrasound. Mechanical grinding through chipping, milling, and grinding reduces the cellulose crystallinity in biomass. Chipping breaks the biomass into 10–30 mm pieces, while milling and grinding reduce the size of biomass to 0.2 mm (Zakaria et al., 2014). The overall process leads to decrease in dimension and increase in aspect ratio of the particle. But still demands high power and energy for the pretreatment. Steam explosion and ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) employ very high temperature and pressure to digest the constituents of LCB to valuable sugars (Brodeur et al., 2011, Banoth et al., 2017). The major disadvantage of steam explosion is it partially degrades hemicellulose and produces toxic compounds. The AFEX process is more effective on the biomass with less lignin content which is the main drawback of this technique (Sun and Cheng, 2005). In a pulsed electric field, biomass is treated with a sudden burst of high voltage (5.0–20.0 kV cm−1) for short durations. Ultrasound degrades the biomass by the application of ultrasonic waves. Small cavitation bubbles are formed upon sonication, rupturing the cellulose and hemicellulose. Ultrasound frequencies of 10–100 kHz have been used by various researchers to treat lignocellulosic biomass (Suhara et al., 2012). It was reported that very high-power sonication at high power detrimentally affects the LCB pretreatment."
10,Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass by chemical method,"6.2 Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass by chemical method The use of alkali, acids, and other solvents to treat LCB and make them vulnerable to breakage is the principle of chemical pretreatment (Agbor et al., 2011). Some of the chemical methods of LCB pretreatment include (i) Concentrated acid; (ii) Alkali; (iii) Ozonolysis; and (iv) Organosolv. The most commonly used solvents are acids and bases in their diluted forms (Zhao et al., 2008, 2013; Digman et al., 2010). The acid treatment removes the surrounding hemicellulose and provides access to cellulose moieties for digestion. Alkali solvents can aid in the degradation of side chains leading to modifications in glycosides and esters of LCB constituents (Ibrahim et al., 2011, Sills and Gossett, 2011). The major disadvantage of this method is the recovery and high cost of acid. Equipment used in the process should be resistant to acid attacks. Ozone can also be used to pretreat LCB with any toxic byproduct’s generation. But, owing to the high cost of large amounts of ozone, this method cannot be used routinely."
11,Biological pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass,"6.3 Biological pretreatment of Lignocellulosic biomass Since chemicals are not used in this process, it generates a negligible number of toxic inhibitors during pretreatment. Involvement of living microbes like bacteria, enzymes, metabolites from enzymes, fungi, etc. play a crucial role in hydrolyzing LCB components (Maurya et al., 2015). Some combinatorial techniques such as physical and chemical pretreatments with living cells are commonly used for the process. However, biological methods have a prolonged process rate with significantly less treatment rate and are not adequate for commercial application."
12,Nanotechnology-based pretreatment,"6.4 Nanotechnology-based pretreatment Nanotechnology–based LCB pre-treatment is an excellent methodology as they can be recycled and reused, thereby reducing the process cost. Acid–functionalized MNPs are commonly used in the LCB pre-treatment process. Application of MNPs for immobilizing enzymes, functionalizing microbes and chemicals would be a great alternative to traditional techniques used for LCB treatment. Reusability of the NPs and enzymes associated with it makes the process cost-effective and environment-friendly (Xu et al., 2009). They improve the interaction between the biomass and the enzymes at the molecular level. It was reported that the nanosized metal particles penetrate the cell wall of LCB, where they interact with lignocellulosic components to release carbohydrates generating significantly less cell–wall–derived inhibitors (Razack et al., 2016, Amin et al., 2017)."
13,Acid–functionalized magnetic nanoparticles,"6.5 Acid–functionalized magnetic nanoparticles Acid–functionalized NPs seem to have a higher affinity to hydrolyzed LCB. They are also called solid acid nano catalysts. Their efficiency appears to be at par with mineral acids used in chemical techniques hence has an added benefit of reusability in strong magnetic nature (Pena et al., 2014a, Pena et al., 2014b). In 2011 a set of scientists sulfonated MNP to hydrolyzed LCB (Lai et al., 2011). Likewise, it was demonstrated that these functionalized MNP had significantly better stability and enhanced catalytic activity for biofuel generation (Wang et al., 2015)."
14,Nano–scale shear hybrid alkaline (NSHA) pretreatment,"6.6 Nano–scale shear hybrid alkaline (NSHA) pretreatment NSHA involves high–speed shear, chemical reagent synergy, and a mild thermal application. These reactions occur in a specific reactor for nano mixing, wherein high shearing of LCB is performed to eliminate the lignin. This process exposes cellulose biomass and lignin for degradation. Saccharification and refinery was better in NSHA technique (Wang et al., 2015). Additives like PDAC Poly (diallyl dimethylammonium chloride) are used in combination with NSHA to degrade LCB constituents. These charged polyelectrolytes alter the cellulose surface and stabilize the lignin. It was demonstrated that PDAC polyelectrolyte forms globular complexes with lignin, and it also alters the cell wall morphology of the biomass. Also, the PDAC polyelectrolyte decreases the use of chemicals required for the LCB pretreatment. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the various approaches available for LCB pretreatment."
15,Role of nano materials based pretreatment for fuel generation,"6.7 Role of nano materials based pretreatment for fuel generation Pretreatment of LCB by nanomaterials enables easier penetration into the biomass to yield sugars for fuel generation. When compared to conventional processes, the use of nano filters and membranes helps in keeping the sugars native conformation intact with good recovery. Magnetic NPs like iron-based particles have made downstream processing of fuels and its byproducts much easier under magnetic fields. Depolymerization of corn cobs by pretreatment of biomass using cerium magnetic NPs makes degradation of lignin much more efficient and yields products like alcohols and esters (Rajak et al., 2021). Pretreatment of LCB using NPs is an eco-friendly and convenient strategy for generating fuels from complex substrates effectively. The cost of the treatment process is also very less when compared to acid hydrolysis. Immobilized silica NPs were able to retain 90 % of their reducing activity against LCB and yielded 35% more sugars when compared to free native enzymes (Ariaeenejad et al., 2020)."
16,Manufacturing Lignocellulosic Biomass-based products for energy using nanomaterials,"Nano approaches play a crucial role in the synthesis of liquid fuels from LCB. As the cellular membrane is in a manometric scale, it can be easily disassembled into its constituents by fermentation, catalysis, or gasification processes. At times nano catalysts can be tailored to avoid sugar formation and generate other valuable products like polyols (Wegner and Jones 2009). With the help of nanotechnology, the process becomes even more proficient and easy. The detailed mechanism of production is still underway. Very few attempts have been made for the conversion of LCB to valuable products like sugar (Padil et al., 2018). The following section throws light on the various products that are feasible with the employment of nanomaterials (Haq et al., 2021)."
17,Bioethanol,"7.1 Bioethanol Production of bioethanol requires numerous stages of pre–treatment, hydrolysis catalyzed by immobilized enzymes (lignin degrading enzymes, glycol hydrolases, etc.), fermentation and strain modifications (Bhatia et al., 2017). NPs have been directly immobilized onto substrates of cellobiose, glucosidase or cellulase to initiate the fermentation reactions yielding LCB hydrolysis. Nanomaterials can range from metals to polymers to magnetic oxides, etc. (Yallappa et al., 2013). Immobilized nanosized enzymes improve saccharification of complex sugars present in LCB, and thermostability is also seen to be far better when compared to free counterpart. An ideal example would be Trichoderma reesei cellulases crosslinked by glutaraldehyde for hemp hurd hydrolysis by MNPs (Abraham et al., 2014). Glucosidase has been used in many combinations of MNPs to produce bioethanol (Honda et al., 2015). Cellulase immobilized with NPs manifests enhanced stability in variable pH and temperatures (Cherian et al., 2015). Table 2 summarizes the most recent advances in bioethanol production using NPs in combinations with LCB derivatives. Generally, this is performed by manipulating the tree biology and altering plants to stock and create catalytic systems until harvest inside the host tree. Later, these systems are activated by engineering techniques to degrade LCB to produce biofuels (Wegner and Jones, 2009)."
18,Biohydrogen,"7.2 Biohydrogen Production of biohydrogen by nanomaterials and LCB is also drawing attention in the fuel industry due to its faster and proficient product recovery (Puri et al., 2013). But the impact of dark fermentation on nanomaterial and LCB is still unknown (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). The major drawback of this valuable fuel is the slow rate of production and yield. Only 35 % of the substrate can be at most converted to hydrogen, and the residual components yield other byproducts (Logan, 2004; Beig et al., 2020). Hence, there is always a need to enhance and upgrade the mass-scale production of hydrogen fuel from LCB. These can be done by strain improvement or the introduction of nanomaterials. Enzymes used in the reaction can be activated and accelerated efficiently by nanomaterials like nickel or iron. They will act like cofactors at the active site of enzymes (hydrogenase), subsequently reducing proton exchange (Lin et al., 2016). Second-generation ethanol can be produced as a by-product of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) (Oksman et al. 2011). The hardest part of cellulose, NCC, can be generated as a part of ethanol production during hydrolysis. The exploitation of feedstock sources like cotton, beet, wood, tunicates, ramie, saccharide, wheat, etc. can achieve bioethanol and NCC simultaneously in a pilot plant (Oksman et al. 2011). Bioethanol-produced NCC is known for its simple and economical features. Residues of ethanol synthesis is a great precursor of nanocellulose production (Pirani and Hashaikeh 2013). NCC is a composite material with great mechanical properties and is regarded as a highly valued product yielding biofuels (Pirani and Hashaikeh 2013). Cellulose-based biofuels can create employment opportunities in biorefineries and increase venture capital (Duran et al. 2012; de Oliveira et al 2017). Fig. 2 illustrates the various ways nanotechnology can be applied to LCB to yield potential precursors to produce value-added products of commercial importance."
19,Summary of key findings,"When it comes to the production yield of sugars for fuels, silica NPs have yielded the maximum glucose percentage of 96% (Pena et al., 2014a, Pena et al., 2014b). It is also observed from Table 1 that wheat straw, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, atrovirens leaves, etc., are sustainable substrates for enhanced sugar generation using NPs (Abraham et al., 2014; Sánchez-Ramírez et al., 2017; Dutta and Saha, 2019). Magnetic NPs for fuel generation is the most trending research area among nanotechnologists today as this combination not only gives a satisfactory sugar yield but is also reports to have excellent retention of enzymatic properties and recovery post-synthesis in superior operating conditions (temperature and pH) (Carlier and Hermans, 2020). Recent objectives of researchers are to experiment with NPs to generate fuels from approaches that are cost–effective and environmentally friendly. Cellulase is the most experimented with an enzyme with NPs and LCB as it specifically reduces cellulose and hemicellulose as well as exhibits better surface modifications, robust performance, and enhanced stability at economical costs ( Anju et al., 2020) Recently bioethanol produced from thermostable glucosidase immobilized on NPs has exhibited the highest fuel efficiency of 93% and satisfactory enzymatic activity retention of 50% (Alnadari et al., 2020). The concentration of metal NPs seems to influence the normal functioning of the microbial strains associated with hydrogen production. Nano approach elevates the metabolic performance of the microbiota that improves electron transfer rate. Thus, it corresponds to upgrades in enzymatic efficiencies. Furthermore, NPs tend to improve hydrogen production in acidic pH. It has also been demonstrated previously that substrate concentration has an inverse effect on biohydrogen production (Malik et al., 2014). Metal oxide NPs increase hydrogen production 4.5 times when compared with normal synthesis protocols (Gadhe et al., 2015). Similarly, a 33% increase in production was seen when iron NPs (0.2 g/L) were used in sucrose medium (Han et al., 2011). Up to 260% more sugar conversion is also reported previously for a similar combination of LCB with titanium NPs (Jafari and Zilouei, 2016). Most of the outcomes summarized in Table 3 regarding the hydrogen production by various LCB materials and NPs depend on the type of interaction existing between the catalyst and nanomaterial. An increase in electron transfer rate will ultimately improve the hydrogen yield and commercial production. In addition, the high surface area and increased aspect ratio of NPs make them suitable candidates to accelerate reaction kinetics. Thus, leading to the removal of unwanted oxygen from the reaction mixture (Chen, et al., 2017). Iron-based NPs are found to be the primary cofactor utilized for biohydrogen production as they form the main component for hydrogenase (Mohanraj et al., 2014). In the presence of iron NPs, the production has been reported to increase to a maximum of 73% as it is associated with ferredoxin and hydrogenase of the electron transport chain (Yang and Wang, 2018). Apart from iron, NPs of nickel, silver, gold, copper, palladium, etc. have been used to enhance hydrogen production under dark fermentation techniques (Beckers et al., 2013; Abraham and Puri, 2020)."
20,Future perspective and challenges,"Biomass in contact with NP seems more amenable to breakdown to produce sugars and lignin, which can later yield fuels and bioproducts through microorganisms or their enzymes. Use of MNPs makes a recovery and reusability of enzymes easier and efficient under applied magnetic fields. Though many positive results have been reported previously, the actual and detailed mode of action opted by NPs is yet to be explored in the future. The exclusive use of nanomaterials to yield sugars and to generate fuel is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, NP are essential moieties for viable fuel generation. Apart from revolutionizing pretreatment and hydrolysis protocols in LCB conversion, yielding nanocellulose and lignin can further increase economic viability of the overall LCB bioconversion process into fuels and commodities. To date, silica NPs-based LCB treatment has produced the highest conversion of 96% of glucose, while iron NPs lead to hydrogen and ethanol production by 80%. Nano range would favor better binding and enzyme functionality of substrate to enzymes (Singh et al., 2019). The aspects that need to be focused in the future should deal with the toxicity parameters of the particle, its effect on enzymes, microbial functionality and the change in efficacy based on the NPs. Implementation should be done on a commercial scale to apply green energy-based manufacturing of fuels for the growing population. The application of xylan NPs and nano lignin towards energy production also needs to be exploited in-depth in the upcoming years. Nanotechnology based LCB reduction leads to production of green energy that can sustain environmental wellbeing and replace carbon derived petroleum products. Utilization of waste to generate energy holds potential perspectives for bioeconomy (Leong et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021). The cost of recycling is considered to be a major hindrance in biorefinery industries (Leong et al., 2021). Future agenda for potential research ideas would be to focus on the utilization of nanotechnological approaches to improve the commercial importance of LCB derivatives especially for fuel generation. But over-exploitation of NPs in the valorization process would lead to xenobiotic accumulation in the biosphere. Production of tailored NPs for specialized application on LCB is also a major challenge for industrial-level treatment of biomass. Careful examination of fabricated NPs and precursors used for reduction is necessary. However, most of the research on nanoparticle-based fuel generation from LCB is in the preliminary stage. Details on the effect of NPs on cost of production, enzyme and its associated toxicity is still lacking. Integration of treatment processes with NPs can aid in reducing consumption of energy while enhancing productivity (Haq et al., 2021). Nanotechnology-based fuel generation from LCB should be optimized using tools to meet the current and future demands. Novel technologies would help to bridge the gap between laboratory-based fuel generation to commercialized large-scale production."
21,Conclusion,"The current review discussed the application of nanotechnology and its products on LCB conversion to yield value-added energy-yielding products. Strategies of utilizing nano-based materials as catalysts easily penetrated the LCB cells to produce sugars and derivative products. Microbial-based NPs could protect fermenting strains, hence increasing the output of biofuels. Thus, it is concluded that nanomaterial is an integral part of sustainable energy production from LCB. Breaking down LCB components to nanoscale too produces products useful to man. Therefore, it won't be surprising in the upcoming years if nanomaterials replace the current conventional chemical treatments completely for the LCB refinery."
