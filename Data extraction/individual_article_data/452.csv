0,Introduction,"Gas hydrate formation is one of the most tricky flow assurance issues in the oil and gas industry [1,2]. Clathrate hydrates are generally formed when light hydrocarbons and water molecules combine under low temperatures and high pressures in production and transportation facilities [3,4]. Their accumulation may cause hydrate plugging in pipelines and other important facilities, which adversely affects operation efficiency and safety, and even leads to enormous economic losses [4,5]. Accurately predicting hydrate formation conditions is crucial to the design and operation of the production process, and to avoid hydrate blockages. As more challenging oil and gas resources are continuously developed, it is common to encounter harsh conditions including ultra-high pressure, low ambient temperature, highly acidic gas, and high-salinity water [6–9]. For instance, the wellhead pressure of ultrahigh pressure gas reservoirs in the Sichuan Basin exceeds 100 MPa, the H2S content of some gas fields discovered here is as high as 30 mol% [6,7]. Therefore, complex systems of alkanes, acid gases, water, various electrolytes, and alcohols are more common in the oil and gas production chain [7,10,11]. Within complex systems containing acid gas/water/alcohol/electrolyte, there are complex molecular and ionic interactions, including hydrogen bond associations between water and alcohol molecules, solvation between H2S, CO2, water and alcohol molecules, electrostatic interactions and ionic solvation [12–14]. These interactions affect the fugacity, activity, and other thermophysical properties of the components, leading to dislocation of the gas hydrate formation conditions. Many thermodynamic models have been proposed to compute gas hydrate formation conditions, such as the classic van der Waals-Platteeuw (vdW-P) model [15] and its enhanced models, such as the Parrish-Prusnitz model [16], Ballard-Sloan model [17], and the Chen-Guo model [18]. The reliability of these traditional models largely depends on the performance of the adopted equations of states (EoSs) for all fluid phases, or EoSs for vapor phase, and activity models for liquid phase [1,19]. The widely used cubic EoSs, such as Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) and Peng–Robinson (PR) EoSs [20,21], perform poorly due to the inability to characterize strong association interactions among associating fluid molecules [10]. In contrast, the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) EoS that combines the SRK EoS and Wertheim's first-order perturbation theory has attracted much attention because it takes the association interactions into account [14]. To date, it has been proven to be effective for modeling complex multiphase equilibrium and thermophysical parameters of mixtures containing water, methanol (MeOH), monoethylene glycol (MEG), and acid gases [13,22,23]. But its reliability is limited to the chosen association schemes and the binary interaction parameters. For alcohol-containing systems, many activity models can alsodescribe the component activity in the solution, including local composition models such as Nonrandom Two-Liquid Theory (NRTL), Universal Quasi-chemical Theory (UNIQUAC) equations, and group contribution models such as UNIFAC [24,25]. It should be noted that these models usually ignore pressure dependence, leading to limitations in high-pressure applications. For salt-containing systems, the Debye-Hückel and Piter equations, and their modified versions are usually employed to model the influence of electrolytes on water activity [12,26]. The latest models of gas hydrate thermodynamics have attempted to combine hydrate phase thermodynamic models, EoSs, and activity models to address the aforementioned challenging systems. ZareNezhad and Ziaee's research [10,27] considered the hydrogen bonding association (by CPA EoS) and the electrostatic effects of hydrolytic dissociation of acid gases, and proposed the CPA/electrolyte/Chen–Guo model to predict the formation of gas hydrates containing acid gas and methanol. Although the accuracy was acceptable, some scholars claimed that it decreased in the presence of H2S and/or CO2 [28]. Seif et al. [29] investigated the CO2 and CH4 hydrate dissociation conditions in the presence of 1-propanol and 2-propanol aqueous solutions by combining the Parrish-Prausnitz model, PR EoS, NRTL, and Wilson activity models. Delavar and Haghtalab [30] reported the thermodynamic modeling of gas hydrates in the presence of acidic gases, alcohols, and salts by combining the Chen-Guo model, SRK-HV EoS, and UNIQUAC equation. Although possible interactions between the components in the liquid phase are incorporated in the UNIQUAC equation, it is still difficult to accurately predict the acid gas hydrate formation conditions due to the high solubility of H2S and CO2 in the presence of inhibitors. Sharif et al. [31] predicted the hydrate formation temperature on the systems containing acid gases, methanol, ethylene glycol and salts by combining the vdW-P model, the extending UNIQUAC equation, and PR EoS. Their predictions cover a wide range of inhibitor systems in production but ignore the interactions between the dissolved acidic gas and other components in the solution. In summary, the above explorations exhibited good accuracy under limited composition, temperature, and pressure conditions. From the perspective of this work, the following insights could be obtained: (i) many frameworks rely on EoSs and activity models to describe the liquid and gas phases, making the modeling process complicated and inconvenient for application; (ii) these insufficient combinations have difficulties with simultaneously and accurately describing various interactions among molecules or ions and their effects on gas hydrates formation; and (iii) the activity models neglecting the pressure dependence could not characterize the effect of high pressure on the liquid phase; this inability to characterize these effects limited the expansion of the coupled models under high pressure. Therefore, these models are difficult to employe directly in these situations. As an extension of the CPA EoS, the Electrolyte Cubic-Plus-Association (e-CPA) EoS developed by Maribo-Mogensen et al. [32] seems to provide a new solution: (i) the original association term can be employed to describe hydrogen bond association and solvation; (ii) the Debye-Hückel and Born terms are introduced to illustrate the electrostatic interaction and Gibbs free energy of hydration; (iii) the simplicity and high-pressure applicability of the cubic EoS are combined with the local composition model. Binary systems involving ions usually use the Huron-Vidal/NRTL (HV-NRTL) mixing rule to improve the model's performance [33]. Hence, both liquid and gas phases can be well described only by the e-CPA EoS. If the e-CPA EoS is coupled with the hydrate phase model, it is expected to predict the gas hydrate formation conditions of complex high-pressure systems containing acidic gas-water-alcohol-electrolyte by a unified thermodynamic framework. Several previous studies have primarily demonstrated this potential. Maribo-Mogensen et al. [32] combined the e-CPA EoS with the vdW-P model to successfully predict the gas hydrate formation pressure in mixtures with NaCl, methanol, and ethylene glycol. Sun et al. [34] recently reported a thermodynamic modeling approach for gas solubility in multi-salt solutions with e-CPA EoS, which provides a good reference for modeling the water-rich phase. The goal of this work is to propose a unified thermodynamic framework based on the Parrish-Prausnitz model, CPA EoS, and e-CPA EoS for computing the gas hydrate formation conditions of high-pressure complex systems containing hydrocarbon/acidic gas/water/alcohol/electrolyte. As far as we know, there is no mature thermodynamic framework that can solve this problem well. This work mainly considers the following three factors to ensure the reliability and usability of the model: 1) The association between acidic gas molecules and other polar components, such as water and common inhibitors (methanol, and monoethylene glycol). 2) The nonideality of water in the mixture caused by common electrolytes, including ion electrostatic effects and ionic solvation. 3) The applicability of the thermodynamic model in wide ranges of compositions, pressures, and temperatures. This work is organized as follows: In section 2, a new unified-thermodynamic framework and its modeling approach for gas hydrate systems containing hydrocarbons, acidic gases, water, alcohol, and electrolytes are introduced. In section 3, the gas hydrate formation conditions of five typical systems are predicted, and numerous high-pressure literature experimental data and predictions from different models are used to evaluate the accuracy and advantages of this work. Then, the influences of the interaction between the molecules or ions on the hydrate formation conditions are analyzed. As another application, the performance of two thermodynamic inhibitors is quantitatively described. Finally, the overall applicability, accuracy, and limitations of the model are given."
1,Thermodynamic model,"This thermodynamic framework of gas hydrate is developed from the phase equilibrium criterion, which can be expressed by Eq. (1). (1) Δ μ W H = μ W β − μ W H = μ W β − μ W α = Δ μ W α where μ W H , μ W α , and μ W β are the chemical potential of water in the hydrate phase (H), the water-rich phase or the ice phase (α phase), and the metastable empty hydrate lattice (β phase) respectively. To calculate the chemical potential of water, different thermodynamic models are used to model the hydrate phase and the water-rich phase or ice phase."
2,Parrish-Prausnitz hydrate model,"2.1 Parrish-Prausnitz hydrate model The Parrish-Prausnitz model is derived from the vdW-P model. van der Waals and Platteeuw assumed that the hydrate phase is an ideal solid solution, and that the hydrate is formed under constant volume conditions [15]. The difference between the water chemical potential of empty (β) and filled (H) hydrate lattices is modeled by the Langmuir gas adsorption model and expressed as Eq. (2): (2) Δ μ W H = μ W β − μ W H = − R T ∑ m = 1 2 [ ν m ln ( 1 − ∑ j Y j m ) ] where ν m is the number of type m cavities per water molecule in the lattice. For structure I: ν 1 is 1/23 and ν 2 is 3/23, and for structure II: ν 1 is 2/17, ν 2 is 1/17, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, and Y j m is the probability of a cage of type m occupied by guest molecule j. The Y j , m in Eq. (2) is expressed by Eq. (3): (3) Y j , m = C j , m f j , m 1 + ∑ k C k , m f k , m where f j,m is the fugacity of component j in a cage of type m calculated from the EoS, and C jm is the Langmuir constant of component j in a cage of type m. The vdW-P model used a spherical model to calculate the Langmuir constant C jm , which led to cumbersome model solving. Parrish and Prausnitz [16] provided a two-parameter formula obtained by fitting experimental data to calculate the Langmuir constant, which made the vdW-P model easier to extend to multicomponent systems. The C jm can be expressed by Eq. (4): (4) C j m = A j m T exp ( B j m T ) where A j m and B j m are fitted parameters from the experimental data. Most of the fitting parameters of hydrates in structures I and II in this work come from the research of Munck et al. [35] and Rasmussen and Pedersen [36], and those of hydrates in structure H can be found in the research of Madsen et al. [37]. According to Eq. (1), the modeling of hydrate phase equilibrium should also incorporate the chemical potential of water in the water-rich phase or ice phase. The chemical potential difference of water between the empty hydrate lattice (β) and the water phase (α) can be calculated by Eq. (5): (5) Δ μ W α R T = Δ μ W 0 R T 0 − ∫ T 0 T Δ h W R T 2 d T + ∫ P 0 P Δ V W R T d P − ln a W where Δ μ w 0 is the chemical potential in the reference state (T 0, P 0), the subscript 0 represents the reference state (T 0 = 273.15K, P = 1atm), Δ h W and Δ V W are the molar enthalpy difference and volume difference between the β-phase and the water phase (liquid or ice), respectively, and a W represents the water activity. The water activity in the pure water or ice phase is considered to be 1, but when it is not in the presence of thermodynamic inhibitors. It can also be defined as the ratio of the fugacity of water in the solution (f w) to pure water (f 0), which can be calculated from the EoS. The last term of Eq. (5) characterizes the nonideality of the water phase caused by acid gases, inhibitors. The thermophysical parameters of the structure I and structure II hydrates in Eq. (5) refer to previous studies [16,38–40]."
3,CPA EoS,"2.2 CPA EoS The CPA EoS combines a cubic EoS, initially the SRK EoS for the physical part, with an association term derived from Wertheim's theory [14]. In terms of pressure P, the CPA EoS can be expressed as follows: (6) P = R T v − b − a v ( v + b ) − 1 2 R T v ( 1 − v ∂ ln g ∂ v ) ∑ i x i ∑ A i ( 1 − X A i ) where a and b are the energy and co-volume parameters of the SRK EoS, v is the molar volume, g is the radial distribution function (RDF), x i is the mole fraction of molecule i, A i represents the active association site A on molecule i, X A i is the fraction of sites A on component i that are not bonded with other active sites; ∑ i refers to the summation of all components, and ∑ A i refers to the summation of all sites (A i , B i , C i ) on component i. The three terms on the right side of Eq. (6) respectively represent the repulsion term, gravitational term, and association term of CPA EoS, and the last one is used to characterize molecular association. The energy parameter a in Eq. (6) is given by: (7) a = a 0 [ 1 + c 1 ( 1 − T r ) ] 2 where T r is T/T c, T c represents the critical temperature, and a 0 and c 1 are pure component parameters. X A i is the heart parameter in the association term, which is given by Eq. (8). (8) X A i = 1 1 + ρ ∑ j x j ∑ B j X B j Δ A i B j i , j = 1,2 , ⋯ , N C A where N C A is the number of polar components, ρ is the molar density, and Δ A i B j is the association strength between site A on molecule i and site B on molecule j, given by: (9) Δ A i B j = g [ exp ( ε A i B j R T ) − 1 ] b i j β A i B j where ε A i B j and β A i B j are the association energy and association volume, respectively, for the association between A i and B j. The characterization performance of the association term depends on the adopted association scheme (i.e., the number and type of association sites for the associating compound) and the association parameters ( ε A B and β A B ). According to the nomenclature of Huang and Rados [41], the two-site (2B) association scheme is used to characterize MeOH (with one electron donor site and one electron acceptor site), and the four-site (4C) association scheme is used for highly hydrogen-bonded molecules (with two proton donors and two proton acceptors), such as water and MEG. For the pure associating component, five parameters (a 0, b, c 1, ε A B β A B ) in the CPA EoS shown in Table 1 should be determined to characterize its thermophysical properties. For the inert (non-associating) components, the association term is equal to zero and the CPA EoS reduces to the SRK EoS. In this case, only three parameters a 0, b, and c 1 are required, these are usually calculated from the critical pressure (P c), critical temperature (T c), and acentric factor (ω). When the CPA EoS is used for mixtures, the van der Waals mixing rule is employed for a and b in the physical part [14]. For mixtures containing acidic gases and other polar components, the mCR-1 combining rule proposed by Foals et al. [42] or available spectroscopic experimental data are applied to obtain the cross-association parameters in the association part. The solvation of H2S and CO2 is adopted in this work [13,22], and are treated as being capable of cross-associating with water, alcohols, and glycols. Specifically, H2S is modeled assuming that has only two proton donor sites and CO2 is modeled assuming only one electron acceptor site. The cross-associated parameters in this work are shown in Table 2 . More details about the CPA EoS and determining model parameters can be found elsewhere [13,22,23,43]. The method for solving the CPA EoS can be found in the research of Jia and Okuno [45], and several derivative properties of pure components, including the specific heat capacity, enthalpy, and fugacity are also given elsewhere [46]. The fugacity coefficient equation is derived as follows [45]: (10) ln φ i = − ln ( Z − B ) + b i b ( B Z − B − A Z ( B + Z ) Z ) − A B ( 2 ∑ j x j a i j a − b i b ) ln ( Z + B Z ) + ∑ A i ln X A i − 1 2 ∑ i x i ∑ A i ( 1 − X A i ) ∂ ln g ∂ x i where φ i is the fugacity of the ith component, Z is the compressibility factor, A = aP/R 2 T 2, B = bP/RT. (11) ∂ ln g ∂ x i = 0.475 B Z ( Z Z − 0.475 B ) b i b"
4,e-CPA EoS,"2.3 e-CPA EoS The e-CPA EoS is extended by introducing the DH term and the Born term into the CPA EoS to model mixtures containing electrolytes [32]. According to the contribution of the interaction between molecules or ions, the residual Helmholtz energy based on e-CPA EoS is as shown in Eq. (12): (12) A r = A SRK + A assoc + A DH + A Born where A SRK and A assoc are the contributions from the CPA EoS; A DH and A Born are the contributions from the Debye–Hückel theory (the long-range interaction of the ions) [12] and Born equation (ion-solvation) [32], respectively. The residual Helmholtz energy based on SRK EoS is as follows: (13) A SRK n R T = − ln ( 1 − b v ) − a ( T ) b R T ln ( 1 + b v ) where n is the total number of moles; α ( T ) is a temperature-dependent energy parameter for the mixture, determined by the Huron–Vidal infinite pressure mixing rule as shown in Eq. (14). The remaining parameters in Eq. (14) are the same as those of in Eq. (6). (14) a b = ∑ i x i a i b i − g E , ∞ ln 2 where x i is the mole fractions of the component (solvent, ion), g E , ∞ is the excess Gibbs energy at infinite pressure calculated by the modified Huron-Vidal/NRTL equation as shown in Eq. (15) and Eq. (16): (15) g E , ∞ R T = ∑ i x i ∑ j x j b j exp ( − α j i Δ U j i R T ) Δ U j i R T ∑ j x j b j exp ( − α j i Δ U j i R T ) (16) Δ U j i = U j i − U i i where α j i is the NRTL nonrandomness parameter. U ji and U ii represent the interaction energy between components j and i and component i and i, respectively. The Δ U j i is the change in interaction energy between like and unlike interactions ( Δ U j i = U j i − U i i ). Note that the modified Huron-Vidal/NRTL equation applies to systems containing polar components, and can also be reduced to van der Waals mixing rules for the special case where α i j = α j i = 0 , Δ U i j ln 2 = ( 2 a i b i − a j i b j ) and a i j = a i a j ( 1 − k i j ) . To apply the model over a wide temperature range, a quadratic temperature dependence for the interaction parameter is given in Eq. (17) [34]. (17) Δ U i j R = Δ U i j r e f R + ω Δ U i j [ ( 1 − T T Δ U i j ) 2 − ( 1 − T r e f T Δ U i j ) 2 ] where Δ U i j r e f is the binary interaction parameter at reference temperature T ref = 298.15 K, and Δ U i j r e f , ω Δ U i j and T Δ U i j are adjustable parameters between an ion, i, and a solvent, j. The residual Helmholtz energy from the contribution of the association is determined by the solution to the constrained optimization problem [47] given by Eq. (18). (18) A assoc R T = ∑ i n i ∑ A ∈ i ( ln X A i − 1 2 X A i + 1 2 ) where the parameters are the same as those in Eq. (6). The residual Helmholtz energy contributed by the ion-ion interaction is calculated from the Debye-Hückel theory, as shown in Eq. (19): (19) A DH = k B T V 4 π N A ∑ i n i z i 2 ∑ i n i z i 2 χ i where k B is the Boltzmann constant, V is the total volume, N A is the Avogadro constant, zi is the charge of ion i, and the function χi is given by Eq. (20): (20) χ i = 1 d i 3 [ ln ( 1 + κ d i ) − κ d i + 1 2 ( κ d i ) 2 ] where d i is the hard-sphere diameter of the ion, and κ is the inverse of the Debye screening length. Maribo-Mogensen [48] assumed that the same value is used in both the physical term and the Debye–Hückel term of the EoS. According to the Born model, the residual Helmholtz energy from the contribution to ion-solvation is obtained from Eq. (21). (21) A B o r n = N A e 2 8 π ε 0 ∑ i n i z i 2 R B o r n , i 1 ε r − 1 where e is the elementary charge, R B o r n , i is the radius of the Born cavity caused by the transfer from the vacuum to the fluid phase, and ε r and ε 0 represent the static permittivity and vacuum dielectric constant, respectively. For more details on determining R B o r n , i and ε r , please refer to the study by Maribo-Mogensen et al. [32]. The e-CPA EoS is specific to ions, and the estimation of solvent and ion parameters is the key to its modeling. For polar solvents, the parameters used in this work (also used in CPA EoS) are listed in Table 2. For ions, the pure component parameters for e-CPA EoS include a 0, b, c 1, ε A i B j , β A i B j , d, and R B o r n , and the binary interaction parameters for ions and other species are α i j , Δ U i j r e f , ω Δ U i j and T Δ U i j . It is necessary to reduce model parameters under certain assumptions to promote the application of the e-CPA EoS. For this purpose, the following assumptions have been made [32,48]: a 0 and c 1 of the ion in Eq. (13) are all set to zero; the ions are assumed to be non-associative, so ε A i B j and β A i B j are also equal to zero; the NRTL nonrandomness parameter α j i and ion-ion interaction parameters are set to zero. Furthermore, the ion co-volume parameter b i is determined by the hard-sphere diameter obtained by Marcus [49]. In this work, the interaction parameters of the ion-solvent and ion-gas are salt-specific, which means that the interaction parameters for the cation-solvent and anion-solvent are equal. Notably, studies have shown that when the cation or the anion is same, the binary interaction parameters for the single H2O-salt and salt-gas can be applied to a multi-salt solution without new adjustable parameters [32,34]. Several ion-specific size parameters used in this work are listed in Table 3 and the ion-gas interaction parameters for H2O−salt−gas ternary systems are listed in Table 4 . The binary interaction parameters of several of the salts and inhibitors mentioned above are listed in Table 5 . To our knowledge, no interaction parameters of CaCl2 with MeOH and MEG have been published. Therefore, the interaction between them is not considered in the third part of this work. To compute the fugacity of the nonelectrolyte compounds in the electrolyte-containing solution, the influence of the electrolyte can be explained by combining the CPA contribution given above with the electrolyte contribution term, as shown in Eq. (22). (22) ln φ i = ln φ i CPA + ln φ i EL Where φ i CPA is the fugacity coefficient of component i, which is given by Eq. (10), φ i EL is the fugacity coefficient of component i, which combines contributions from electrostatic interactions (DH term) and ionic solvation (Born term) in the electrolyte solution."
5,Results and discussion,"Using the thermodynamic framework proposed in the previous section one can predict the hydrate formation conditions of natural gas mixtures containing acidic gas, water, alcohol, and electrolyte. Fig. 1 provides the calculation process of the proposed framework, and the specific solution steps are as follows: Step 1: Input the feed composition, the given natural gas pressure, and the initial temperature. Step 2: Assume the hydrate structure type (structure I or II), and set K = 1. Step 3: Calculate the Langmuir constant C jm by Eq. (4). Step 4: Solve the Rachford-Rice (RR) equation to update the phase component mole fraction y i . More details about the multiphase flash algorithm for hydrates used in this work can be found elsewhere [50,51]. Then calculate the component fugacity f i by the CPA EoS, and select the e-CPA EoS for calculation when the aqueous phase contains electrolytes. Step 5: Calculate the probability ( Y j m ) of a cage of type m occupied by guest molecule j by Eq. (3). Calculate the chemical potential ( Δ μ W H ) of water in the hydrate phase by Eq. (2). Step 6: Calculate the chemical potential of water in the rich water phase by Eq. (5). Step 7: Calculate the absolute deviation between Δ μ W H and Δ μ W α . If the accuracy is not satisfied, continue to adjust the temperature iteration value T by the secant method, then return to Step 2. Otherwise, the present temperature is regarded as the hydrate formation temperature of the set structure. Output it and mark it as either T I or T II depending on its structure. Step 8: According to the above steps, calculate the formation temperature of structure I and structure II hydrates, and regard the larger value of the two as the natural gas hydrate formation temperature. The predicted results of the proposed model are discussed and analyzed in this section to evaluate and clarify its applicability, accuracy, and advancement. The Parrish-Prausnitz model and CPA EoS are used to predict the gas hydrate formation conditions for the systems of CH4, H2S, CO2, and their mixtures with MeOH as an inhibitor. To evaluate the advantages of this model, the traditional PR EoS, SRK EoS [20,21], and the Parrish-Prausnitz model are combined to compare the performance of the proposed model. For the polar system, to provide more convincing comparison results, the Huron-Vidal (HV) mixing rule is introduced in PR and SRK EoSs to replace the van der Waals mixing rule. In addition, the Parrish-Prausnitz model and the e-CPA EoS are used to predict the gas hydrate formation conditions of the coexisting systems containing acidic gases, and inorganic and/or organic inhibitors. Table 6 lists the compositions of representative inhibitors in this work. To quantitatively describe the accuracy of the model, the average absolute deviation (AAD) and average relative deviation (ARD) are defined as Eqs. (23) and (24), respectively: (23) A A D ( X ) = ∑ i N | X cal, i − X exp, i | / N ⅆ (24) A R D ( X ) = 1 N d ∑ i N d | X cal, i − X exp, i | / X exp, i × 100 % where: X is the hydrate formation temperature T or pressure P; the subscript cal is the calculated value of the model; exp is the measured value; and N d is the number of experimental data."
6,Predictions and analyses based on the P–P/CPA EoS model,"3.1 Predictions and analyses based on the P–P/CPA EoS model 3.1.1 Single gas (CH4, H2S, CO2) hydrates In this section, CH4 is treated as a nonpolar gas, and pure H2S and CO2 are modeled as solvating components due to the presence of water. Fig. 2 shows the experimental and calculated hydrate formation temperatures of pure CH4, H2S, and CO2 by the P–P/CPA, P–P/PR, and P–P/SRK models. During a wide pressure range (up to 186.2 MPa), Fig. 2 presents an excellent match between the predictions and experimental data in this work compared with the P–P/PR and P–P/SRK models. The deviation analyses from different models are summarized in Table 7 . The ARDTs of the proposed model are only 0.05%, 0.01%, and 0.12%. For the CH4 + H2O system (Fig. 2a), there is a hydrogen bond association but no molecular solvation in the liquid phase. Both of these interactions present in the liquid phase for H2S/CO2 + H2O systems (Fig. 2b and c). The P–P/PR and P–P/SRK models adhere to classic mixing rules and are therefore unable to model hydrogen bond association and solvation, resulting in their reduced accuracy, as shown in Table 7 and Fig. 2. These deviations gradually increase with increasing pressure. This indicates that considering the hydrogen bond association and solvation is indispensable for accurately predicting the hydrate formation conditions for high-pressure CH4, H2S, and CO2 systems. Fig. 2b also shows the results of PR and SRK EoS combined with HV mixing rules which considers the polarity of H2S. It is found that the introduction of HV mixing rules improves the predictions of the PR and SRK EoSs for H2S hydrate, especially the accuracy of the latter, which is comparable to the CPA EoS. 3.1.2 Acidic mixed natural gas hydrates For a multicomponent acidic system, the predictions of the three models are compared with the experimental data from Sun et al. [58]. The results are shown in Fig. 3 a. It can be observed that the prediction of the P–P/CPA model is in the highest agreement with the experimental value within a wide range of pressures and H2S contents. This is due to the association term of the CPA EoS effectively describing the influence of the hydrogen bond association and the solvation effect of water, H2S, and CO2 on the hydrate phase equilibrium. The results of the P–P/SRK model and the P–P/PR model showed significant deviations due to missing association terms and failure to model these polar effects of the components. Furthermore, Fig. 3b shows the relationship between the ARD of the hydrate formation temperature predicted by the three models and the total molar content of H2S and CO2. With the increase in the latter (also the decrease in the CH4 mole fraction), the ARD of the three models generally shows an increasing trend, while the P–P/CPA model always gives the most accurate prediction. This proves again that considering solvation is indispensable for improving the applicability of the P–P model to systems containing acid gases and water. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), at a given concentration, the proposed model goes from underestimation to overestimation of the hydrate formation condition as the temperature and pressure increase, and the trend becomes more obvious as the mole fraction of H2S and CO2 increases. These trends may be caused by a lack of consideration of the dissolution of acidic gases in water due to different degrees of hydrolytic reactions [10,13]. When the temperature and pressure increase, the enhancement of the chemical equilibrium between H2S, CO2, and water gradually promotes the inhibition of water activity. In this case, the proposed model provides a local overestimation. Additionally, the hydrate formation temperature is relatively high when the proportion of acidic gas in the mixture increases. At this time, the increasing trend of this overestimation could also be attributed to the strengthening of the hydrolytic reactions. Despite this fact, this omission is still acceptable when considering the overall prediction accuracy with an ARDT of 0.29% and avoiding sacrificing the simplicity of the proposed model due to considering more nonideal factors. 3.1.3 Acidic gas hydrates with methanol as an inhibitor To extend the proposed model to systems containing alcohol inhibitors and acid gases, MeOH (one of the most commonly used inhibitors) is selected to analyze the association effects of methanol and acidic gas molecules. The hydrate formation conditions of the H2S + MeOH + H2O system and CH4+H2S + CO2+MeOH + H2O system are predicted as shown in Fig. 4 . The relative deviation between most of the predicted hydrate formation temperatures of the P–P/CPA model and the measured data are within ±0.3%, while that of hydrate formation pressures is within ±10%. Compared with the P–P/RR and P–P/SRK models, the ARDs of the proposed model are the smallest, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 7. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the ARDs of the H2S hydrate formation temperature from the three models in MeOH solutions with mass concentrations of 10%, 35%, and 50%. Among them, the maximum ARD of the P–P/PR model is 0.13%, that of the P–P/SRK model is 0.34%, and that of the P–P/CPA is only 0.07%. Even if the concentration of methanol is as high as 50 mass%, the proposed model is still the most consistent. From the perspective of molecular interactions, there are strong hydrogen bonds between the methanol and water molecules, and the cross-association (solvation effect) of H2S, and CO2 molecules with methanol and water in the predicted systems reduces water activity, minimizes their availability and competes directly with hydrate formation. Therefore, these good consistencies from the proposed model should be attributed to the successful description of the interaction between acidic gases, water, and MeOH molecules, which improves the model's prediction performance especially at high concentrations. Notably, the increased deviation of the P–P/SRK and P–P/PR models is mainly caused by the lack of modeling of these interactions."
7,Predictions and analyses based on the P–P/e-CPA EoS model,"3.2 Predictions and analyses based on the P–P/e-CPA EoS model 3.2.1 Single and mixed gas hydrates with salt inhibitor In the oil and gas field, the electrolytes in the produced water such as NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 are natural inhibitors of hydrates. The inhibition mechanism of the salt is not the same as that of the alcohol. The salt ionizes in the solution and interacts with the water dipole to form coulombic bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces. Strong electrostatic interactions and ionic solvation reduce the water activity and ultimately change the formation conditions of hydrates. In this work, the proposed model (P–P/e-CPA) is extended to systems containing electrolytes, and the hydrate formation conditions of 14 electrolyte-gas-water systems (S26–S39) are predicted. As far as we know, these experimental data from Hu et al. [8] and Ng and Robinson et al. [61] are among the few available data characterized by high pressures and high salinities. The predicted hydrate formation temperature under specified pressure conditions is shown in Fig. 6 . The deviations between them and the experimental values are shown in Table 8 . These results show that, in the given temperature and pressure ranges of 1.306–179.6 MPa and 252.2–305.55 K, the AADs between the predicted hydrate formation temperature and the experimental value are within 0.11–0.95 K, and those of the pressure are within 0.04–5.19 MPa. In particular, the predictions for CO2 hydrate are quite consistent with the experimental value (Fig. 6b). The proposed model describes the multiple effects of ion electrostatics and solvation, hydrogen bonds between water molecules, and cross-association effects between CO2 and water molecules, that is, these factors together inhibit the formation of CO2 hydrate. As shown in Fig. 6c and Table 8, the model can accurately describe the effect of CaCl2 concentration up to 31 mass %, but there are significant ARDs of temperature and pressure up to 0.37% and 33% when the CaCl2 concentration increases to 33 mass %. There are stronger electrolyte interactions and weaker hydrogen bonds between water molecules due to a higher charge density in systems with a high concentration of CaCl2. Thus, the deviation may be caused by the proposed model's insufficient description of the gas-water-ion interaction, and the strong description of the hydrogen bond in a high-concentration CaCl2 solution. In this case, further research on improving the interaction parameters of ions, and water in high-concentration systems is worth conducting to improve this model. In addition, this deviation may also be caused by the inaccuracy of the experiment at extremely low temperatures (252.6–256.4 K). However, in general, this extreme situation is rare in engineering and experimental reports, and the deviations are always less than 1.5 K. For higher concentrations, the model should be evaluated or improved before application. 3.2.2 Gas hydrates containing mixed alcohol and salt inhibitors Predicting the hydrate formation conditions when methanol or ethanol coexists with electrolyte inhibitors is critical and challenging. In this section, 18 different gas hydrate systems containing mixed alcohol and salt inhibitors are predicted by the P–P/e-CPA model. These results for gas hydrate formation temperature are presented in Fig. 7 , and the deviation analyses are also provided in Table 8. Most of the predictions are close to the experimental data, verifying the effective modeling of the association effect and ionic interaction in the coexistence system of organic and inorganic inhibitors. For methane hydrate in the presence of MEG and NaCl/KCl/CaCl2 (Fig. 7a and Table 8), the model can accurately describe the effect of hydrogen bond association and ion interactions at pressures up to 46.7 MPa (or MEG mass concentrations as high as 35%). The calculated AADs of the hydrate formation temperature are 0.28–1.07 K. For acidic gases, the H2S hydrate formation curves (Fig. 7b) are accurately described under low pressure and low salt concentration conditions in the presence of MeOH, MEG, NaCl. For CO2 (Fig. 7c and Table 8), as in a previous study [62], the model slightly overestimates the hydrate formation temperature as the concentration of MeOH or MEG increases at a fixed KCl concentration. The same phenomenon seems to occur in multicomponent systems containing MeOH (15 mass% and 30 mass%) and NaCl (3.5 mass%) as shown in Fig. 7d. The cause may not be unique. On the one hand, as analyzed by Palma et al. [62], it could be attributed to significant differences between the experimental sets. On the other hand, it may be because the model applies a fixed cross-association scheme and combing rules for mixtures of water, methanol, and monoethylene glycol, and the actual cross-association between molecules may change with their concentrations. A notable study [63] has pointed out that a transition in the association scheme between alcohol and water molecules occurs at higher water concentrations. In any case, to avoid this inconsistency, other experimental methods are needed to further improve the model. However, it is still acceptable that these slight deviations are within a small range of temperatures and the maximum deviation is only 0.7 K."
8,Performance comparison of two types of inhibitors: NaCl and MEG,"3.3 Performance comparison of two types of inhibitors: NaCl and MEG An important economic management measure in the prevention and control of hydrate formation is to reasonably control the proportion and dose of organic inhibitors. The effects of two types of thermodynamic inhibitors on CO2 hydrate formation are described by the P–P/CPA model. Fig. 8 presents the comparison of the inhibiting effects of single and mixed inhibitors of NaCl and/or MEG on CO2 hydrate. The results (Fig. 8a) show that, for a given pressure, the hydrate formation temperature decreases with increasing inhibitor concentration. NaCl is superior to MEG in inhibiting effects under the same mass fraction and high-pressure conditions. This result is consistent with a previously reported experimental phenomenon [73]. In solution, sodium chloride ionizes have a strong electrostatic interaction with water molecules, so that the solvated water molecules are unable to form hydrates. Specifically, this is mainly due to coulomb interactions that are stronger than the hydrogen bond association between MEG and water molecules, and the solvation effect of CO2 with MEG and water. As the salt concentration increases, the solubility of CO2 in the inhibited water phase decreases. Therefore, a lower temperature is required for the water molecules to form hydrates with the CO2 molecules. The phenomenon illustrated in Fig. 8b can be explained by the fact that increasing the concentration of NaCl can result in a stronger inhibiting effect than increasing the concentration of MEG in the fixed mass concentration of mixed inhibitors. These results also illustrate that the association, DH, and Born terms (as shown in Eq. (12)) in the model successfully characterize the effects of these different intensities of interactions to CO2 hydrate. More results shown in Fig. 8b demonstrate the significant synergistic effect that is present in systems simultaneously containing NaCl and MEG compared to systems containing only one type of inhibitor. For instance, the hydrate suppression temperature of mixed inhibitors of 5 mass% NaCl and 5 mass% is 4.2 K at 40 MPa, while those of systems containing single inhibitors of 5 mass% NaCl or 5 mass% MEG are 1.8 K and 1.3 K, respectively. A similar effect was observed in previous reports [9,73]. These analyses show that when injecting thermodynamic inhibitors into common salt-containing systems such as wellbores, deep-sea oil and gas pipelines, the concentration characteristics of salt and alcohol and their interaction should be fully evaluated to optimize the inhibitor proportions and reduce the costs associated with the hydrate prevention."
9,"Applicability, accuracy, and limitations of the model","3.4 Applicability, accuracy, and limitations of the model According to preceding predictions (Figs. 2–7), the model has been applied to single and mixed gas hydrates of CH4, CO2, and H2S, as well as in the presence of five single and mixed inhibitors (MeOH, MEG, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2). Furthermore, Fig. 9 exhibits the overall prediction deviation from the 281 groups of hydrate phase equilibrium points. Within a broad range of temperatures (252.6–311.64 K) and pressures (0.068–186.2 MPa), the total ARDT and ARDP between the experimental and calculated data in this work are 0.13% and 6.52%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, the relative deviations of 80% predicted temperatures and pressures are within ±0.21% and ±10%, respectively. In particular, for nonelectrolyte systems (as seen in Table 7), the total ARDT is 0.19%, which is reduced by 0.24% and 0.34% compared to traditional Soave–Redlich–Kwong and Peng–Robinson EoSs. For gas hydrates containing inorganic inhibitors and organic inhibitors, as shown in Table 8, the total ARDs of the predicted hydrate temperatures, and pressures are 0.12% and 6.30%. The acceptable predictions with absolute deviations below 2.2 K are achieved in a harsh system at ultrahigh pressure (186.2 MPa) (Fig. 2c), a sour gas content of 24.52 mol% (Fig. 3a), a MeOH concentration of 50 mass% (Fig. 4), and a salinity of 31 mass% (Fig. 6c). In summary, in most cases, the model accurately and flexibly describes the single or combined effects of the hydrogen bonds, solvation, ion electrostatic interactions, and ionic solvation on the hydrate formation conditions. Finally, to ensure that the model is used appropriately, it is necessary to discuss its limitations. In terms of compositions, for the mixtures containing H2S and CO2, as shown in Fig. 3, the ARDT in the presence of 24.52 mol% acidic gases is only 0.31% (0.90 K), but when its concentration is increased to 33.62 mol%, the ARDT rises to 0.45% (1.29 K). Hence, for higher acid gas concentrations, it should be employed with caution. However, as analyzed in section 3.1.2, considering the hydrolysis reaction of acid gases may help improve the accuracy. For mixtures containing CaCl2, the results show higher deviations for CaCl2 concentrations above 31 mass %. In this case, as described in section 3.2.1, the uncertainty of the experiment under harsh temperature conditions (below 256.4 K) should be eliminated or improving the model's description of electrolyte interactions at high concentrations. Regarding the applicable temperature and pressure ranges, this work showed a satisfactory match with the actual values within 256.4–311.64 K and 0.068–186.2 MPa. However, due to limited experimental data, it is difficult to exhaust different systems to evaluate accuracy. There, when it is not in these ranges, more experimental evaluation is needed before applying the model."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, a unified thermodynamic framework is proposed to compute the hydrate formation conditions of high-pressure systems containing acidic gases/water/alcohol/electrolytes. The CPA EoS with different association schemes and the advanced e-CPA EoS with the HV-NRTL mixing rule are coupled with the Parrish-Prausnitz model to describe gas, liquid, and hydrate phases. The model is applied to the single and mixed gas hydrates of CH4, CO2, and H2S, as well as in the presence of five single and mixed inhibitors (MeOH, MEG, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2). The inhibition of mixed inhibitors on CO2 hydrate is evaluated, and the conclusions are as follows: • This new model considers the influence of hydrogen bond association, solvation, ion electrostatic interaction, and ionic solvation on the fugacity of liquid and hydrate phases, and successfully describes their contribution to the hydrate formation conditions. These interactions are not negligible for the accurate modeling of mixtures containing acidic gas/water/alcohol/electrolyte. • The model can accurately and flexibly compute the gas hydrate formation conditions in the presence and absence of organic and inorganic inhibitors within a wide range of compositions, temperatures, and pressures (0.068–186.2 MPa). Validated by 281 groups of experimental data from the literature, the average relative deviations of predicted temperatures and pressures are 0.13% and 6.52%, respectively. When compared to the traditional P–P/SRK and P–P/PR models, the proposed approach can better match the experimental hydrate formation conditions for the nonelectrolyte systems. • A case study proves that for carbon dioxide hydrate, NaCl is superior to MEG in inhibition at the same mass concentration. A significant synergistic effect that occurs in systems containing both NaCl and MEG compared to systems containing only one type of inhibitor. • The acceptable predictions with absolute deviations below 2.2 K are achieved under ultrahigh pressure (186.2 MPa), a sour gas content of 24.52 mol%, a MeOH concentration of 50 mass%, and a salinity of 31 mass%. However, it is recommended to employ this model with caution when the temperature is below 256.4 K and the CaCl2 concentration is above 31 mass %. Further studies on considering the hydrolysis reaction of acidic gas and improving the interaction parameters of ions, water, MeOH, and MEG in high-concentration systems are worth conducting to improve this thermodynamic framework."
