0,Introduction,"In recent years, hydrogen energy has attracted a promising sustainable, secure, and clean alternative fuel in the field of renewable energies [1–3]. Mostly, hydrogens are produced from natural gases, oil, and coke but they emit dangerous gases such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the environment. Among them, water electrolysis is quite simple, cost-effective, the eco-friendly pathway for hydrogen production and considered to be the best alternatives of hydrocarbon fuels which could meet the global energy demands [4, 5]. However, precious metal electrocatalysts such as platinum and platinum-based nanomaterials are important for water electrolysis (water splitting), which suffer from shortage and are unaffordable for large-scale hydrogen production [6, 7]. Hence, exploring to find a highly efficient, low-cost and environmental-friendly electrocatalyst for water-splitting systems has attracted challenges in pursuit of researchers. In recent times, the transition metal-based (Fe, Co, Ni and etc.) composites have been widely used as an alternative material instead of platinum and platinum-based nanomaterials due to their abundance, low-cost and high catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [8, 9]. The HER (2H+ + 2e− = H2) at the cathode is one of the two half-reactions occur during the water splitting process. The electrode materials with lower overpotential (lower Tafel slope) must be an important factor for enhancing the HER activity. Basic electrocatalytic activity and the active surface area should be significantly high to reach the lower overpotential. In general, Fe, Co, and Ni-based carbon possess good electrocatalytic properties for HER [10]. Among them, Fe-based carbon has been credited numerous attentions due to their unique properties such as good electrical conductivity and etc. Also, it has low-cost and earth abundance [11]. In this work, we report the preparation of IONP@C-HIOP composite using Iron (III) acetylacetonate and benzyl alcohol at 185 °C by a simple hydrothermal method. The synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite was characterized by various analytical techniques and utilized as a catalyst for HER. IONP@C-HIOP showed enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity, which exemplify the synergic effect between IONP and carbon. This is a simple and economical synthesis of IONP@C-HIOP composite, might be a perfect choice and perspective for many potential energy applications including HER. Also, the supernatant solution, the byproduct was collected by centrifugation of IONP@C-HIOP composite which exhibits blue fluorescence under UV-light irradiation due to the presence of carbon dots (C-dots) in the solution. The obtained C-dots allow potential applications in the biomedical field, especially, live cell imaging with good biocompatibility."
1,Materials and methods,"Iron (III) acetylacetonate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), benzyl alcohol, acetonitrile, ethanol, toluene, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and dichloromethane (DCM) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Carbon cloth (CC) electrode was purchased from FuelCellStore, College Station, Texas, USA. The yeast strains C. albicans was obtained from the Korean Cell Type Culture Collection (KCTC), Seoul, Republic of Korea, maintained in 10% v/v glycerol stocks, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Overnight cultures in malt extract (ME) broth were used for the bioimaging experiments. All obtained chemicals were used as received and deionized (DI) water was used throughout this work. The monodisperse IONP@carbon composites were synthesized by using the procedure described in the earlier reports without any major modifications [12]. 2.0 g of iron (III) acetylacetonate was added to 40 mL of benzyl alcohol inside a glovebox. The reaction mixture was taken into a 100 mL inner volume of Teflon lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed carefully and then heated to 170–200 °C for 48 h in a hot air oven. After hydrothermal treatment, the final reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The final mixture was centrifuged and washed with ethanol and DCM. The resulting solid was dried at 70 °C for 5 h in a hot air oven, and stored under argon until further use. The byproduct will be mention as a supernatant solution throughout this manuscript from this point. The obtained solution was freeze-dried and stored for further use as it contains C-dots. The synthesized C-dots materials were thoroughly characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the detailed instrumentation techniques, and electrochemical measurement procedure are described in the ESI."
2,Results and discussion,"The monodisperse IONP@carbon composite and C-dots were synthesized simultaneously by a simple hydrothermal method. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of novel structured IONP@C-HIOP composite and C-dots, also their suitable biology and environmental-friendly energy applications. The composites were synthesized by varying the reaction temperature from 170 to 200 °C. The composites prepared temperatures from 170 to 180 °C resulted in a spherical shape as shown in Figs. S1 and S2. In addition, size of composites increases with increase in temperature. Whereas irregular plate-like shape composites were obtained for the reaction temperature between 190 and 200 °C. The plate size increases with increase in temperature from 190 to 200 °C. Thus composites synthesized between 170 and 180 °C and 190 to 200 °C will be denoted as IONP@C throughout the manuscript. For a detailed explanation, please refer to supporting information. Particularly at reaction temperature 185 °C composites shape change from spherical shape to the nearly regular plate-like structure as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , these composites denoted as IONP@C-HIOP throughout the manuscript. Thus only IONP@C-HIOP composites prepared at 185 °C were discussed in detail in the main manuscript. Morphology of synthesized composites was revealed by FESEM and HRTEM analyses. The carbon encapsulated spherical IONPs (IONP-C) are distributed on the homogeneous fairly hexagonal plate-like shape iron oxide particle (HIOP-C) at 185 °C as displayed in Figs. 1 and 2 compared to 190 and 200 °C (refer to Figs. S1 and S2). The IONP@C-HIOP composite synthesized at 185 °C was further thoroughly characterized and selected as an ideal catalyst for HER. Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images with EDX spectrum of IONP@C-HIOP composite synthesized at 185 °C and FESEM images (Fig. 1(a–f)) displayed nearly spherical smaller particles apparently distributed on the surface of the fairly hexagonal plate-like shape. EDX spectrum (Fig. 1(g)) confirms the elemental composition of carbon (C), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O) with an atomic percentage of 17.74, 16.85 and 65.41, respectively presented in IONP@C-HIOP composite. Further, the morphology and composition of IONP@C-HIOP composite were confirmed by HRTEM analysis. Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM images with different magnifications and EDX with elemental mapping of IONP@C-HIOP composite. Carbon encapsulated IONPs with the averaged diameter of 15 ± 5 nm densely deposit on the bigger carbon trapped hexagonal shaped plate-like IONP are clear from the TEM images (Fig. 2(a–g)). No apparent aggregation is observed in the images. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2h) clearly show the lattice fringes and the calculated lattice distance of the IONPs was ~0.25 nm which is close to the (311) diffraction facet of cubic IONPs [13, 14]. These results revealed that the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite are crystalline in nature. The elemental composition C, O, and Fe in IONP@C-HIOP composite was confirmed by elemental mapping analysis. Further, the composition of IONP@C-HIOP composite was characterized using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2(m), the EDX analysis of the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite reveals the presence of C, O and Fe elements with the compositions of 16.95, 64.43 and 18.62% respectively, indicating that this IONP@C-HIOP composite is consisting of a trace amount of carbon trapped IONPs. The phase structure and degree of crystallinity of the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite were characterized by XRD analysis. The wide-angle XRD pattern of the IONP@C-HIOP composite shown in Fig. S3(a) corresponds to the face-centered-cubic magnetite IONPs (JCPDS card No. 88-0315) [15, 16]. The pattern clearly showed an intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 35.41° corresponding to (311) plane of IONPs. The d-spacing value (interlayer distance) was calculated using the Bragg equation (Eq. (1)) based on the position of the (311) reflection peak is ~0.253 nm which matched well with the result obtained from HR-TEM. (1) nλ = 2 dsin θ where, ‘n’ is a positive integer (0.94), ‘λ’ is the wavelength of incident X-ray (λ = 1.54 Å) and ‘θ’ is the angle between the incident rays and the surface of the materials. Raman spectroscopy was used to verify the carbon trapped IONPs and degree of graphitization of carbon. Fig. S3(b) shows the Raman spectrum of synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite. It can be seen that major sharp peaks appeared below 800 cm−1, an intense peak has been noticed at ~665 cm−1 attributed to the A1g mode of a symmetric stretch of oxygen atoms along with Fe (FeO bonds). The other three weak peaks at about 200, 310 and 520 cm−1 are assigned to the T2g vibration modes of IONPs [17]. The Raman spectrum also shows the additional broad peak around 1200–1600 cm−1 due to the carbon phase, where D-band and G-band can be found at 1370 and 1598 cm−1, respectively. The high intensity of the D-band is associated with the defects in the sp2 carbon lattice [18]. Hence, it may be confirmed that the low degree of graphitization of carbon present on IONPs in the IONP@C-HIOP composite. XPS is one of the significant methods to characterize the elemental composition of the IONP@C-HIOP composite and their XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3 . High-resolution XPS spectrum of C1s (Fig. 3b), three component peaks were observed to be centered at 284.78, 286.18, and 288.68 eV, which originated from CC/CC, COH, and CO groups, respectively [19, 20]. For O1s (Fig. 3c), the binding energies about 529.98, 530.58 and 531.58 eV represented OFe groups, COH/FeOH groups and CO groups, respectively [21]. The Fe2p (Fig. 3d) exhibits two major binding energy levels including Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 that are centered at 710.78 and 724.28 eV, respectively [22]. Deconvolution of each binding energy levels (Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2) exhibits two peaks might be due to the presence of two different oxidation states. Hence, IONPs in the IONP@C-HIOP composite contains a mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. A shake-up satellite peaks at 718.28 eV caused by the configuration interaction due to relaxation of the valence electrons [23]. The FT-IR spectrum of synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite is shown in Fig. S4. The FT-IR spectrum shows absorption band at 1730 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of CO groups due to the embedded carbon on the IONPs was oxidized during the hydrothermal reaction. The absorption bands around 1370 and 1220 cm−1 corresponds to stretching vibrations of COH and COC groups present in the IONP@C-HIOP composite. The strong absorption bands around 864 and 543 cm−1 are assigned to the Fe–O–Fe/Fe–O stretching vibrations of IONPs Lattice [24]. On the basis of the aforementioned data, we can conclude that the IONP@C-HIOP composite is successfully synthesized without major contamination. The successfully synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite was further examined for their catalytic activity towards HER. HER is one of the most important reactions in energy converting systems. The electrocatalytic activity of IONP@C-HIOP composite and bare platinum (Pt) plate was tested for HER by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements (Fig. 4a). The obtained results were presented with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The IONP@C-HIOP composite has delivered the lowest onset-potential (−25 mVRHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 suggesting that IONP@C-HIOP composite has the excellent electrocatalytic and kinetic activity for HER. The onset-potential of IONP@C-HIOP composite is little lower than that of bare Pt plate (−35 mVRHE). In general, HER activity depends on onset-potential but also Tafel slope, the lowest onset-potential and Tafel slope enhancing the HER activity due to the faster kinetics. Tafel slope of IONP@C-HIOP composite is 45 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4b) which is closer to the bare Pt plate (32 mV dec−1). The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the IONP@C-HIOP composite was accredited to the carbon supported on IONPs in the matrix which may be responsible for the electron transport from IONPs to electrodes [25]. The supported carbon and IONPs provides a synergistic effect on the electrocatalytic activity with the lowest overpotential in the IONP@C-HIOP composite and exhibit good stability for HER. The extraordinary catalytic activity and excellent stability of IONP@C-HIOP composite in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte suggest that the IONP@C-HIOP is an ideal material for high-performance HER and these results were compared to recently reported in the literature [26–34], as listed in Table 1 . Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plot of the IONP@C-HIOP composite was carried out at different overpotential (−3, −103, −203 and −303 mVRHE) with a potential turbulence from 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz (Fig. 4c). The diameter of semicircle decreases (charge-transfer resistance, Rct) with increasing the overpotential from −3 to −303 mVRHE which strongly suggests that the HER activity depends on the applied overpotential [35]. The remarkable reduction of Rct for IONP@C-HIOP composite suggested a faster electron transfer process at the higher overpotential. IONP@C-HIOP composite exhibited a much lower Rct suggesting IONP@C-HIOP composite has smaller Rct of H+ reduction at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The suitable electrical equivalent circuit model for the EIS of IONP@C-HIOP composite was proposed which is shown in Fig. 4d, whereas Q2 is a capacitance with a surface factor, R1 and R2 are solution resistance and Rct, respectively. Stability of materials is one of the desirable significant factors for HER activity. Hence, the stability of IONP@C-HIOP composite is analyzed for 5 h at a current density of −10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4e). The stability curve of IONP@C-HIOP composite remains constant (0.187 VRHE) upto 5 h, proving that the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite exhibited an excellent stability and strong durability in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte towards HER. Further, to confirm the stability of synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite, LSV was carried out initially and after 5 h of stability measurement as shown in Fig. 4f. Both LSV curves are almost similar which strongly suggests that the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite are highly stable and more suitable for HER. The freeze-dried C-Dots is not completely dried (powder sample) due to the functional groups (liquid nature) on the surface. The structural and optical properties of the obtained C-dots were revealed by various physicochemical analysis such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, HRTEM, UV–vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the XRD pattern of the obtained C-dots exhibit a broad diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 22°, which is attributed to the turbostratic carbon phase. The lattice distance of C-dots is around 0.39 nm based on the (002) diffraction plane (2θ = 22°) [36, 37]. Additionally, the Raman spectrum of the obtained C-dots (Fig. 5(b)) shows nearly overlapped two significant peaks for carbon around 1370 (D-Band) and 1570 cm−1 (G-Band) which is attributed to the disordered structure in the plane graphite sp3 and crystalline of the sp2 cluster, respectively [38, 39]. These study suggested that the C-dots existence of poor crystallinity/low degree of graphitization. The TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 5(c) and (d)) performed for the C-dots to observe the morphology of the particle. In Fig. 5(c), the C-dots are monodispersed with an average size of about 5 nm. The HRTEM image indicated that the C-dots have crystalline/graphitic and amorphous nature in an inner and outer part of the C-dots, respectively and the lattice distance was about 0.22 nm, which is in accordance with graphite (100) plane [40–42]. Amorphous nature in the outer part of C-dots is due to the disordered surface and or functional groups on the surface. Hence, the obtained C-dots have acceptable graphitization which is matches well with XRD and Raman analysis. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy technique was used to find the organic functional groups on the surface of the C-dots. As shown in Fig. S5, the small absorption band around 3400 cm−1 is attributed to the OH stretching vibration which might be due to the hydroxyl functional groups and or physically adsorbed water molecules on the surface of the C-dots. The absorptions at about 2927 and 2864 cm−1 are ascribed to CH asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, respectively [43]. The obvious absorption bands at 1714, 1606, 1452, 1360, 1209, 1024 and 700 cm−1 represent the stretching vibration of CO (carbonyl/carboxyl), alkyl stretching vibration of CC, aromatic stretching/alkyl bending vibration of CC (sp2-hybridised graphitic carbon structure), stretching vibration of COH, stretching vibration of COC, bending vibration of COC (epoxy), and the bending vibration of CH groups, respectively [44–46]. Hence, the results reveal the presence of organic functional groups on C-dot surface. Optical properties of the obtained C-dots were examined by UV–vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The freeze-dried C-dots (byproducts) was first dissolved in small amount of DMSO and then dispersed in DI water due to the incomplete solubility of obtained C-dots in DI water. Then, the aqueous C-dots suspension was used for the optical and bioimaging studies. The UV–Vis absorbance spectrum of the obtained C-dots in Fig. 6(a), shows a non-obvious broad absorption curve around 275–315 nm (middle wave UV region) corresponding to the typical π–π⁎ and n–π⁎ transition of the CC and CO bond on the surface of C-dots [47, 48]. The broad absorption curve can be credited to the complicated band structure and random energy levels of the C-dots [49, 50]. Fig. 6(b) shows the fluorescence excitation spectrum of the obtained C-dots and the maximum excitation peak centered around 340 nm. The aqueous C-dots suspension displays the pale yellow colour under daylight which exhibits bright blue fluorescence under UV-light at an excitation of 365 nm (inset Fig. 6(b)). Furthermore, the fluorescence emissions are shifted from 375 to 535 nm for the different excitation wavelength ranging from 300 to 460 nm (Fig. 6(c)) which is suggesting that the obtained C-dots has tuneable emission property [51]. In addition, the corresponding normalized fluorescence emissions spectra (Fig. 6(d)) clearly displays an emission wavelength towards redshift with the increments of the excitation wavelength. Therefore, the obtained C-dots exhibit an excitation-dependent emission behaviour, which is an essential property of the carbon particles [52]. The excitation-dependent emission wavelength shifts and little variation in the shape of the emission spectra at different excitation wavelengths. This is because of the different size of nanoparticles in the sample and different emissive traps on the surface of C-dots [53–56]. The obtained C-dots shows the maximum emission peak (strongest fluorescence) centered at 395 nm when the excitation wavelength is 340 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 75 nm. The fluorescence emissions of the obtained C-dots were mainly blue, the green and or red emissions were very weak (Fig. 6(c)). In general, the practical bioimaging, fluorescence emission with a longer wavelength is preferred because the cell nuclei usually emit blue light. Hence, the obtained C-dots is more suitable for cell imaging. Besides, the fluorescence emission of the obtained C-dots was examined in different organic solvents such as acetonitrile, ethanol, DMSO, and toluene at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and the spectra are shown in Fig. S6. The spectra showed the fluorescence emission intensity varied by the varying solvents. Among them, the C-dots in toluene displays a maximum fluorescence emission intensity at the same excitation wavelength. The C-dots in toluene displays the pale yellow colour under daylight which exhibits bright blue fluorescence with the naked eye under UV-light at an excitation of 365 nm (inset Fig. S6). Due to the restriction of biocompatibility for cell imaging, C-dots in DMSO diluted with DI water was used instead of C-dots in toluene for bioimaging application. Optical properties in different solvents, cell culture and straining procedures in detail are described in the ESI. The thoroughly characterized C-dots were used as a fluorescent probe for live cell imaging towards C. albicans yeast cells. Prior to considering the utility of the C-dots as fluorescent probes for cell imaging, the growth inhibition and toxicity experiment of C-dots was conducted on C. albicans cells. The C. albicans yeast grown (absence of growth inhibition) up to 24 h incubation in the presence of different concentrations (3.12, 6.25, 12.50, 25, 50 and 100 μg mL−1) of C-dots was observed in the growth inhibition assay. The growth activity of the C. albicans yeast strain in the presence of C-dots was similar to the growth of control sample (yeast strain in the absence of C-dots), as shown in Fig. 7(a). However, the C-dots at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1 slightly diminished the stationary phase of growth culture. Nearly absence of cell growth observed after 8 h incubation time for all the samples. Hence, the time of incubation around 8 h is sufficient to grow the C. albicans cells. This study suggested that the growth of C. albicans yeast did not inhibit in the presence of C-dots. Besides, only 10 μg mL−1 of the C-dots was used for bioimaging experiments, suggesting that small amount of C-dots can be utilized as effective in vitro fluorescent probe for detection of fungal infections in biological samples. Further, the cytotoxicity of the C-dots was tested against C. albicans cells by a respiratory activity. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the respiratory activity of C. albicans in the presence of C-dots with different concentrations shows similar result as compared to the control samples. In addition, the respiratory activity of cell increased with increasing the incubation time from 0 to 8 h, which confirm the C-dots did not induce the cell death. The sodium azide as a positive control (PC) in the cell cytotoxicity was studied using C-dots was to quantitatively relate the percentage inhibition in the cell viability caused by C-dots and to compare it with a known standard cytotoxic agent (sodium azide). Generally, sodium azide inhibits the respiratory activity of mammalian cells by irreversibly binding to the terminal oxidases of electron transport chain and thereby reduce the metabolic activity in cell lines. The PC at 50 μM significantly inhibited redox activity after 6 h of incubation. The C-dots did not show any cytotoxicity towards the cells and were tolerable even at high concentrations which evidence that the C-dots are cytocompatible and do not induce the cell death (cell viability greater than 92% even incubated with C-dots at high concentration of 100 μg mL−1 for 8 h). Moreover, these results suggest that the obtained C-dots can be used as a fluorescent probe for bioimaging purposes due to their low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. Based on the bright blue fluorescence with the good biocompatibility of the obtained C-dots, the fluorescence microscopy analysis was carried out on C. albicans alone (control) and in the presence of C-dots. The C. albicans cells incubated with 10 μg mL−1 of C-dots for 2 h, exhibited intense blue fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 286 nm (DUV), 408 nm (UV) and this fluorescence remained stable over a period of 6 h (Fig. 8 ). This result suggested that obtained C-dots exhibits a bright and stable fluorescence for a long time [57]. In the case of controlled sample strain, they did not show any fluorescence under DUV and UV excitation."
3,Conclusions,"Herein, we have described a simple and economical route for the synthesis of novel IONP@C-HIOP composite and C-dots by the direct one-step hydrothermal method. IONPs are evenly distributed on a hexagonal plate in the IONP@C-HIOP composite with a lattice distance of ~0.25 nm. From the analytical results, we conclude that the IONP@C-HIOP composite with highly crystalline was successfully synthesized without major contamination. The synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite was performed as an excellent electrocatalyst for HER with the lowest onset-potential of −25 mV, and a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1 with good stability and strong durability in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Hence, the synthesized IONP@C-HIOP composite was used as a potential electrocatalyst for HER. Moreover, these results suggest that the IONP@C-HIOP composite could have the potential in manufacturing low-cost water electrolyzer for the large-scale hydrogen production. On the other hand, supernatant solution (byproduct) of IONP@C-HIOP composite showed a durable fluorescence activity and was utilized as a label-free fluorescent probe for live cell imaging. Thus, IONP@C-HIOP composite might be promising electrocatalyst for HER and even the byproduct (C-dots) for can be used bioimaging."
