0,Introduction,"There is currently a growing interest in the use of hydrogen as a clean energy vector, especially for power generation in fuel cells. In that respect, hydrogen production from renewable biomass is particularly adapted to sustainable development concerns. Hydrogen can be produced by direct gasification of biomass into syngas [1,2]. However, this use raw of biomass (as chips or extrudates) is not convenient with respect to its energetic density, transportation and storage properties. An alternative approach is its primary conversion into a bio-liquid (or “bio-oil”, in contrast with “fossil oil”), by fast pyrolysis. This technology, already mature [3], is predicted to be the most economic way to produce hydrogen from biomass on an industrial scale [4]. The process leads to the thermal decomposition of biomass main constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) into a complex mixture of oxygenated molecules with varying composition depending on the feedstock used [5–8]. A typical composition of wood oil is water (20–30%), lignin fragments (15–30%), aldehydes (10–20%), carboxylic acids, carbohydrates (5–10%), phenols (2–5%) [9]. It is considered as a microemulsion between water soluble and insoluble compounds, stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Studies on steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds [10–14] or its water-soluble fraction (which contains the carbohydrates-derived compounds, but not the hydrophobic, lignin-derived oligomers) [15–17] showed promising results. The aqueous fraction of a poplar-derived bio-oil was steam reformed in a fixed-bed reactor [16,18]. Although the reaction was run at high steam/carbon ratio, rapid carbon deposition took place on the catalyst, which limited the reforming time to 3–4h, after which catalyst regeneration was required. The authors concluded that the process would benefit from a fluidised bed configuration, in terms of catalytic activity, carbon deposition and catalyst regeneration. Indeed, the steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction was performed in a fluidised bed reactor for up to 90h with only moderate catalyst deactivation and hydrogen yields around 80% [19]. The aqueous fraction of bio-oil, however, is not representative of the very complex composition of a crude bio-oil, in which up to 300 different compounds have been identified. It contains the carbohydrates-derived oxygenated compounds of low molecular weight (acids, aldehydes, alcohols), but not the oligomeric compounds derived from lignin (representing 25–30% of the whole bio-oil). On the other hand, the specific physico-chemical properties of bio-oils, and particularly their high thermal instability, make difficult their direct utilisation as feedstock. Although stable at room temperature [20], bio-oils polymerize upon heating even at moderate temperature (around 80°C), and decompose at higher temperature. As a consequence, studies performed with crude bio-oils are still very scarce: Panigrahi et al. [21,22] achieved the thermal pyrolysis of a bio-oil, in the absence of catalyst. A mixture of gases, liquids and chars was obtained. Recently, Rioche et al. [23] reported for the first time the catalytic steam reforming of a crude bio-oil over noble metals catalysts supported on ceria–zirconia. The conversion of bio-oil into an H2-rich gas mixture remained stable for over 9h, although a gradual decrease in the hydrogen yield was observed and attributed to catalyst ageing, whereas extensive carbon deposition took place on the reactor walls. From these studies, it appears that carbon deposition is a key issue in bio-oils steam reforming. Therefore, an alternative strategy could be to control the carbon deposition during a step of cracking/reforming without water addition (taking advantage of the water naturally present in the crude bio-oil) and to regenerate frequently the catalyst. This two-step process follows the example of the catalytic cracking of methane, used to produce clean hydrogen in order to feed directly a fuel cell [24–29]. The same concept has been demonstrated with natural gas [30]: (1) Cracking C H 4 ⟶ catalyst C + 2 H 2 (2) RegenerationC+O2 →CO2 During the cracking step (Eq. (1)), the hydrocarbon is decomposed into hydrogen and solid carbon, which accumulates on the catalyst as coke. During the regeneration step (Eq. (2)) the coke is gasified or burnt to restore the catalyst activity. To ensure a continuous hydrogen production, the two reactions are carried out in two (or more) parallel reactors operated with cyclic switching of the two feeds. Other examples of cyclic catalytic processes are the Catofine process for butane dehydrogenation, operating as a “swing bed” system (with a fixed-bed catalyst), and circulating fluidized bed reactors used in FCC [31,32]. In the present study we investigated a two-step process to produce hydrogen from crude bio-oils. As a matter of fact, the “cracking” step has to be considered here as a combination of cracking and steam reforming due to the large amounts of water contained in bio-oils. The crude bio-oil was admitted directly into a single reactor, specially designed to prevent its polymerisation prior to contacting the catalysts. Two Ni-based catalysts have been selected as the active phase. The influence of the cracking/reforming and regeneration operating parameters on carbon deposits (nature, content, toxicity) and their removal was investigated in connection with the changes in catalyst structure related to the cycling process."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The 10wt.% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnation. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in deionised water. γ-Al2O3 extrudates (Rhodia) were crushed and mixed to the dissolved salt. The water was evaporated under vacuum at 40°C. The resulting solid was dried at 110°C for 12h, and calcined (5h, 800°C under static air) yielding the catalyst with a light blue colour. The powder was then pressed, crushed and sieved to a particle size range of 200–300μm. The 4wt.% Ni–2wt.% K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst was provided by Johnson Matthey as a powder with particle size in the 50–100μm diameter range."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface areas were calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms at −196°C using a multipoint method, and considering a nitrogen cross section of 0.164nm2. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh, coked and regenerated catalysts were obtained on a Brucker D5005 by using the Cu Kα radiation. The patterns were recorded in the 2θ angle range from 3° to 80°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were done on a JEOL 2010 microscope with a resolution of 0.19nm, and on a Hitachi S800 microscope, respectively. The carbon deposited on a catalyst after a cracking sequence was studied by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis. A 100mg sample of coked catalyst was placed in a quartz reactor with a thermocouple inside the catalyst bed. The sample was first heated to 100°C under argon to outgas water and weakly adsorbed molecules. Then a temperature ramp (15°C/min, from 100 to 820°C) was applied under a 25% O2/Ar (40mL/min) flow. The CO2 signal was recorded on an Inficon mass spectrometer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to quantify the coke deposits on a Rupprecht and Patashnick oscillating microbalance (TEOM), under the same gas conditions as those used during the TPO experiments, with a temperature ramp of 15°C/min from 50 to 700°C. A blank run was made under the same conditions and subtracted to the observed mass variation. The HSC-Chemistry Version 4.0 Software (OUTOKUMPU, Finland) was used for thermodynamic composition calculations."
4,Bio-oil characteristics,"2.3 Bio-oil characteristics The bio-oil used in this study was made from fast pyrolysis of beech wood residues. It appeared as a fluid, dark brown liquid with a strong smoky odour. It was supplied previously filtered in order to remove char particles that could plug the injection capillary, and used as such in the catalytic tests. Table 1 lists some physical and chemical properties of the bio-oil used. The elemental analysis corresponds to the average composition CH2.3O1.04N0.01, including water. The bio-oil also contains impurities like chlorine, sulphur and traces of metals like K, Mg and Ca (not analysed)."
5,Catalyst testing,"2.4 Catalyst testing A double envelope stainless steel reactor equipped with water-cooling was designed to inject cooled bio-oil through a capillary on top of the hot catalyst. The bio-oil could be kept below 50°C in the capillary. The bio-oil was sent with a syringe pump, at flow rates in the 1–15mL/h range, diluted in argon (100mL/min). During the sequential experiments, an automated two positions switching valve sent the bio-oil either into the reactor or into a collector tank. The whole bench was completely automated (switching between reactants and purge lines, temperature program and data collection). In order to restrict the heated zone to the catalyst bed, the oven consisted in a high-temperature heating tape winded tightly around the reactor. Water and other condensable products were trapped in an ice-cooled condenser at the reactor outlet. A thermocouple, placed inside the catalyst bed, and a pressure sensor connected at the reactor inlet were used to monitor the catalyst temperature and the pressure drop. The catalysts were reduced under hydrogen at 650°C prior to catalytic activity measurements. For blank experiments, the empty reactor was tested containing only a stainless steel porous disk, used to support the powder catalysts, in order to ensure a pressure drop similar to the one observed with a catalyst bed. The gaseous products were analyzed with two HP6890 gas chromatographs in series, equipped with flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. Three capillary columns (Innowax, Poraplot Q, 5Å Molesieve) allowed the quantitative analysis of oxygenated compounds (alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, compounds up to C20), CO2 and C1–C5 hydrocarbons, and permanent gases (H2, O2, N2, CO, CH4), respectively. Since the complete analysis took 25min, analyses were repeatedly programmed every 30min at the end of each cracking step, just before the inert purge. Continuous analysis of the gaseous products stream was also ensured by a mass spectrometer (VG-Prolab) equipped with a closed ion source, applying a conventional fragmentation analysis to quantify the concentration of outlet gases. The variation of the Ar signal during cracking, regeneration and purge steps was considered as inversely proportional to the thermal expansion of the reaction gas products. The H2 productivity (Eq. (3)) was calculated as the moles of hydrogen produced during the cracking steps, per mass unit of bio-oil introduced (g). The H2 productivity values were measured on stabilised catalysts (after four to five cracking and regeneration cycles), and averaged over seven to eight sequences. The hydrogen yield (Eq. (4)) was calculated as the ratio of hydrogen produced during a cracking sequence to the theoretical amount of hydrogen present in the bio-oil feed (including water), i.e. 1.15 H2 mole per bio-oil molar unit CH2.3O1.04N0.01: (3) H 2 produced = moles of H 2 produced g of bio-oil (4) H 2 yield ( % ) = moles H 2 obtained moles H 2 in bio-oil feed × 100 The carbon balance was calculated as the ratio between the total amount of carbon in the products stream (gaseous products formed during cracking, regeneration, and traces of organics dissolved in the water trap at the reactor outlet, analysed by total organic carbon measurements) to the amount of carbon introduced as bio-oil during the cracking sequences, i.e. 1C mole per bio-oil molar unit CH2.3O1.04N0.01. The amount of unreacted water collected after a series of stabilized sequences was also quantified and used to calculate the theoretical WGS equilibrium composition at the reactor outlet."

7,Sequential bio-oil cracking and catalyst regeneration over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Sequential bio-oil cracking and catalyst regeneration over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts The Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts were tested during 12–30 cracking/regeneration sequences. Fig. 1 shows the gaseous products stream obtained for a single sequence, over the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst. A purge is inserted between the cracking and the regeneration, in order to clearly visualize the two transient steps. The conversion of bio-oil is total during the cracking step, gaseous product stream consisting mainly of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. As soon as bio-oil is admitted onto the catalyst, a spike of CO2 is observed whereas CO and CH4 appear later in the products stream. H2 formation starts after a delay of about 50s, increasing rapidly then more slowly, until the bio-oil admission is replaced by the inert purge. It should be mentioned, however, that the CO2 spike is absent during the first cracking sequence performed on a freshly reduced catalyst, then increases regularly till the fifth sequence, from which all sequences become reproducible. The sequence shown in Fig. 1 corresponds to a stabilised catalyst. When oxygen is sent for carbon burn-off, an immediate and strong formation of CO2 takes place, with minor CO formation (Fig. 1). Oxygen is at first completely consumed, and appears in the outlet flow only when carbon oxides formation decreases strongly. CO formation probably results from incomplete carbon combustion due oxygen sub-stoichiometry at the beginning of the regeneration process. It can be stressed that, although the regeneration step shown in Fig. 1 was longer than the cracking step, the time required for coke removal is comparable to the cracking step duration. In the perspective of an effective two-steps process with two reactors working alternately, the two steps could therefore be adjusted to identical durations. Noteworthy is also the oxygen trace returning rapidly to zero when the inert purge starts after regeneration, whereas a tailing is observed for H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 profiles during the purge at the end of the cracking step. This probably reflects some products accumulation in the reactor during the cracking step, the reaction continuing during the purge. Fig. 2 compares the gaseous products distribution, analysed at the end of each cracking step, starting from freshly reduced Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. Each cracking step is followed by regeneration under oxygen, not shown on the figure. The selectivity towards hydrogen is very high for the first sequence, then decreases and stabilises after three to five sequences. After stabilisation, the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst produces a reformate which is more concentrated in H2 and CO, and slightly less in CO2 and CH4 than Ni/Al2O3 (Table 2 ). Except for methane, the outlet gas composition is very close to that calculated at the thermodynamic equilibrium (Table 2). The carbon mass balance obtained in the presence of catalyst was found close to 100%, the ≈5% deficit being due mainly to some carbon deposition observed along the reactor walls and thermocouple. Traces of oxygenated compounds were also observed on some chromatographs, among which acetone was identified, but not quantified. 3.1.1 Temperature and pressure gradients Fig. 3 discloses the changes in catalyst bed temperature and pressure at the reactor inlet, monitored during cracking/regeneration sequences over Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3. The endothermic cracking step is accompanied by a decrease in the catalyst bed temperature (20–25°C), whereas during the exothermic regeneration step a ≈60°C temperature increase is measured. These changes in the catalyst temperature profile may be underestimated because the thermocouple, although placed in the middle of the bed, does not perform an accurate measurement of the effective catalyst particles temperature. In addition, the stainless steel reactor cannot be considered as purely adiabatic, which might also slightly affect the recorded temperature profiles. Therefore, heat balance calculations were not attempted on the basis of the observed temperature variations. However, although the real composition of bio-oils is very complex, we tried to estimate the heat balance from reaction enthalpy calculations, using a simplified composition based on 18 of the main bio-oil components, including water (Table 3 ). The ratio between these components was adjusted to match the average bio-oil composition, CH2.3O1.04. For one sequence in which 0.4g bio-oil is reacted, the reaction enthalpy for cracking/reforming was found to be +1.22kJ. During the regeneration, the reaction enthalpy for the combustion of the deposited carbon (≈40mg, referenced as “solid” carbon in the HSC software) was found to be −1.32kJ. Therefore, the heat generated by coke combustion can compensate the endothermicity of the cracking/reforming reaction, which might lead to an autothermal process, provided this heat is efficiently managed. Fig. 3 also reveals a slight increase of the upstream pressure during the cracking steps (+0.1 to 0.12bar), whereas the pressure immediately steps down to its initial value during the inert purge and the regeneration. This pressure drop cannot be assigned to carbon build-up during the cracking step, since it would remain unchanged when argon is admitted in the reactor. It is only due to gas stream expansion (+30%) related to the conversion of liquid bio-oil into gases (H2, CO2, CO and CH4). This effect is negligible during the regeneration step because the amount of gas produced (CO2 and CO) is much smaller. No pressure increase was observed during long-term runs, which might have resulted from slow carbon built-up in the reactor."
8,Comparison with thermal cracking in the absence of catalyst,"3.2 Comparison with thermal cracking in the absence of catalyst Blank experiments were carried out in the absence of catalyst, in order to evaluate the part of thermal reactions in the cracking process. Fig. 4 compares the gaseous products streams obtained during a cracking/regeneration sequence without catalyst, and over the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst. In the absence of catalyst, the bio-oil is completely decomposed during the cracking sequence, into H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as the main gaseous products. C2H4 is also present in low amount (1.2vol.%). Traces of acetone and aromatic compounds are also detected but not quantified. Contrary to the presence of catalyst, the carbon mass balance showed a clear deficit (Table 2), which corresponds to important soot deposits on the reactor walls and down stream the hot zone. During the regeneration step in the absence of catalyst, CO2 is formed as soon as oxygen is admitted onto the system, but without CO formation, contrary to what is observed in the presence of catalyst. Oxygen is totally consumed during a first period and appears progressively at the reactor outlet while CO2 is still produced. At the end of this step, the CO2 concentration has not completely returned to zero, indicating that the combustion of carbon is not fully completed, in agreement with the carbonaceous deposits observed in the reactor. Although a catalytic effect of the reactor walls, tubing and porous disk, all made of stainless steel, cannot be excluded, the “blank” experiments confirm that the thermal cracking of the bio-oil feed proceeds easily under the prevailing conditions. Comparing the compositions and yields in gaseous products (Fig. 4 and Table 2) obtained with a catalyst (Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3) and in the absence of catalyst, the following features can be outlined: (i) The overall bio-oil gasification is markedly improved in the presence of the catalyst, with a significantly higher production of H2, CO2 and CO. Only the methane yield is found lower (6% versus 8%) than in the absence of catalyst. (ii) The combustion of coke during the regeneration is more efficient in the presence of catalyst. The dynamics of the sequential experiments depicted in Fig. 4 also provide useful information on the specific role of the catalyst. At the beginning of the cracking step, the initial CO2 spike, observed in the presence of the catalyst before H2 production starts, is no more observed in the absence of catalyst, all products being produced simultaneously. This strongly suggests that the thermal decomposition proceeds in a single step, while in the presence of catalyst it combines with catalytic reactions of cracking/reforming, as will be discussed later."
9,Carbon deposition on Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 and catalysts regeneration,"3.3 Carbon deposition on Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 and catalysts regeneration 3.3.1 TPO and TGA analyses The TPO profiles obtained from the coked catalysts (after a cracking sequence and before regeneration) are shown in Fig. 5 . On the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, most of the carbon is oxidized at relatively low temperature (maximum at 391°C), and only a small amount at higher temperature (shoulder at 490°C). On the contrary, most of the carbon deposited on Ni/Al2O3 is oxidised at 487°C, whereas only a small part is oxidized at low temperature (shoulder at 370°C). According to studies on carbon removal from nickel catalysts by TPO [33–35], the low temperature CO2 peak would correspond to the oxidation of bi-dimensional carbon covering the catalyst surface, whereas the higher temperature peak could be attributed to more stable, graphitized carbon whiskers. These assignments will be confirmed by TEM analysis. The TPO profile of coked Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 (Fig. 5, curve (a)) is complex, including a broad CO2 peak between 250 and 430°C and a sharp spike at ≈390°C. Goula et al. observed a similar spike [36] during TPO of Ni/CaO–Al2O3 catalysts coked under methane dry reforming conditions. They also pointed out that no important temperature rise in the catalyst bed was associated to this CO2 spike, and concluded that it is probably related to the complex kinetics of the carbon combustion process. In line with this interpretation, the CO2 spike observed in the TPO profile of the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst might result from a sudden activation of the combustion process when the carbon covering the Ni particles is removed, leading to fast combustion of the carbon in close vicinity to the metal particles. The weight loss corresponding to the removal of carbon was quantified by TGA (Fig. 6 ). The mass variation is the same for both catalysts ( 42 mg g cat − 1 ) , but with a similar shift in temperature as reported for the main peaks in TPO curves. Therefore, although the type of carbon (whiskers or bi-dimensional carbon) depends on the catalyst nature, the total amount of deposited carbon only depends on the bio-oil flow rate. 3.3.2 TEM analysis TEM was used to characterise the Ni catalysts in the “fresh” state (calcined in air at 800°C, then reduced at 650°C), and after 12 sequences of cracking/regeneration at 700°C. The “coked” catalyst was collected after the 12th cracking step, whereas the “regenerated” catalyst was collected after the 12th regeneration under O2. 3.3.2.1 Ni/Al2O3 TEM images of the fresh catalyst show essentially the layered structure of γ-alumina. Despite the hydrogen treatment at 650°C, no Ni particles are observed, although a few darker zones suggest higher Ni concentrations in certain areas (Fig. 7A). EDS analysis reveals that the nickel is highly dispersed and present in every alumina particles analysed, suggesting that Ni is probably incorporated in a non-stoichiometric spinel Ni x Al2O3+x . As a matter of fact, nickel deposited on γ-alumina forms easily a non-stoichiometric surface nickel aluminate phase, even at temperatures as low as 450°C [37]. Electron diffraction performed on several support particles did not allow to discriminate between the patterns of γ-Al2O3 and of the Ni-Al2O3 spinel, since their structural parameters are very close. On the coked catalyst (Fig. 7B), Ni particles are now clearly evidenced, with heterogeneous sizes in the 10–30nm range. This shows that Ni has been extracted from the spinel structure and reduced into metal particles after several cracking steps. Carbon whiskers are also observed, many of them bearing a Ni particle at the tip. After regeneration under oxygen (Fig. 7C), no more carbon whiskers are observed (only scarce units where detected on some micrographs), whereas EDS analysis reveals that the nickel particles are oxidized. The aspect of the alumina support is not modified. 3.3.2.2 Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 The general aspect is that of alumina platelets, whereas EDS analyses reveal that Ni, La and K are present in all analysed particles (Fig. 8A). The nickel is highly dispersed over the support, probably incorporated in a spinel phase, since Ni particles were hardly found on the fresh catalyst. It should be mentioned that both NiAl2O4 and NiLa2O4 spinel structures could be formed. A few large particles containing only La or K were also detected. As anticipated from TPO profiles, the coke deposits (Fig. 8B) are very different from those formed on Ni/Al2O3: the carbon is present essentially as an amorphous layer covering the particles, whereas only very few carbon whiskers are visible. After regeneration (Fig. 8C), this carbon layer is completely removed, except for traces of remaining carbon, in loose contact with the catalyst particles, eventually observed on some micrographs. The aspect of the catalyst is essentially the same as that of the fresh one. 3.3.3 X-ray diffraction analysis Only the patterns of Ni/Al2O3 are presented on Fig. 9 , since the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst is very poorly crystallized. The diffraction pattern of Ni/Al2O3 shows broad lines corresponding to γ-alumina. A sub-stoichiometric Ni2Al18O29 spinel phase (ICDD-JCPDS file no. 00-022-0451) also matches very well the observed pattern. Despite calcination at 800°C followed by reduction of Ni at 650°C, the powder is poorly crystallized. No lines matching pure Ni phases can be identified, in good agreement with the TEM and EDS analyses. The pattern of coked Ni/Al2O3 is nearly the same as for the fresh catalyst, but the two main lines corresponding to metallic Ni are now visible, although weak. After regeneration by combustion of coke, the lines of Ni0 disappear, and two weak lines corresponding to the most intense reflections of NiO can be observed. 3.3.4 Specific surface area and chemical analysis After 12 coking/regeneration sequences, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows a ca. 10% decrease of its specific surface area (Table 4 ). This area remains the same after regeneration. The surface area of the coked Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst is also decreased by 10% compared to the fresh state, but it is fully restored after regeneration: this suggests that the coke deposits may block the support porosity, but the whole surface area is recovered after coke combustion. The Ni content, measured by chemical analysis, remains unchanged in Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 in the fresh and regenerated states (Table 4). Conversely, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows a significant Ni loss (≈9%) after 12 sequences. This is probably related to the formation of carbon whiskers during the cracking steps, bearing Ni particles at the tip: the Ni particles could be carried away during combustion of these filaments."
10,Discussion,
11,Bio-oil reaction network during the cracking/reforming step,"4.1 Bio-oil reaction network during the cracking/reforming step Two important features of the cracking mechanism have been revealed in Section 3: (i) Both thermal (gas phase) and catalytic processes are coexisting. However, the catalyst has a marked impact on product distribution. (ii) The state of the catalytic system (after initial reduction or after several cracking/regeneration cycles) determines the dynamics of the outlet responses to the sequential feeding. 4.1.1 Thermal versus catalytic effects As pointed out by Wang et al. [11,18], oxygenated compounds are thermally unstable at the high temperatures reached in a reformer. There is always a significant competition between thermal decomposition and catalytic reforming reactions. The thermal decomposition of a crude bio-oil in the empty reactor leads to the formation of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as main gaseous products, and to significant amounts of soot-like deposits along the reactor walls and downstream the reacting zone. These results are consistent with high thermal instability of bio-oils. It should be noted, however, that Panigrahi et al. [21] have found a much more complex gas composition when performing the thermal decomposition of bio-oil over quartz chips: at 700°C, up to 50mol.% small hydrocarbons in the C2–C4 range were obtained, and consequently the hydrogen productivity was only 2.9 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 versus 10 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 in our “blank” conditions. This suggests the reactor and the porous disk used to support the catalyst, both made of stainless steel, might catalyse the reforming of the small hydrocarbons produced in gas phase, into H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. As shown in Table 2 and in Fig. 4, a first effect of the catalyst is to reduce the CH4 formation at the benefit of H2, CO and CO2. Since water is the main component of bio-oil (about 30wt.%), the Ni-based catalysts are expected to catalyse the steam reforming of methane issued from the thermal decomposition: (5) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO In the same way, CO is also expected to react with steam according to the WGS reaction, as confirmed in Table 2 by the similarity between the experimental composition and the calculated WGS equilibrium composition:(6)CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 Note that methane dry reforming (with CO2 instead of H2O) might also play some role in this process. However, it should be minor since the amount of CO2 formed by thermal decomposition of bio-oil is much lower than the H2O fraction in the bio feed (16% versus 30%, respectively). Another major effect of the catalyst is to increase significantly the proportion of bio-oil gasification versus coke/soot deposition. Considering the soot as simply consisting in carbon, though it probably also contains adsorbed O and H compounds, it can also be steam reformed according to Eq. (8): (7) C+H2O→H2 +CO An additional feature of the catalyst effect is reflected by the transient CO2 profiles, with the strong spike observed at the beginning of each cracking sequence on the equilibrated catalytic system (Fig. 4). EDS analyses and magnetic measurements (not reported here) have proved that after each regeneration step under oxygen, the nickel phase is completely re-oxidized into NiO (actually, only 2.7% residual ferromagnetic Ni0 was found after regeneration). Therefore, this CO2 spike corresponds to fast reactions between the NiO phase and bio-oil components (or thermal decomposition products), leading to the reduction of nickel. After this reduction, the metallic nickel starts to act as a conventional steam reforming and WGS catalyst. A second argument in favour of an initial NiO reduction is provided by the response of the system over a pre-reduced catalyst during the first cracking step and in the absence of catalyst: in both cases there is no initial CO2 spike. According to this scope, the stabilization effect observed after three to five 5 cycles for the two catalysts (Fig. 2) corresponds to a deep change in the nickel state, from a fully reduced and active state after initial pre-reduction (able to crack thermal methane into carbon and hydrogen and to be immediately active for methane steam reforming and WGS) to an equilibrated oxidized/reduced state, less active than the pre-reduced state. 4.1.2 By-products formation Methane originates essentially from the primary decomposition of bio-oil components. Secondary catalytic reactions producing methane like carbon or CO hydrogenation are not thermodynamically favoured under the prevailing process conditions: the free reaction enthalpies for CO and CO2 methanation become positive at temperatures higher than 600–650°C. However, a secondary catalytic reaction leading to methane cannot be completely excluded, since a significant catalyst temperature decrease is observed during the endothermic cracking step (Fig. 3); furthermore, during the regeneration steps, some of the Ni particles may be evolved from the support during whiskers combustion, and possibly deposited downstream in a cooler zone. However, it should be considered more as an experimental “arte fact” rather than a true mechanistic pathway. Another detrimental by-product like acetone has been detected under certain conditions (long cracking sequence, absence of catalyst). Acetone originates from acetic acid decomposition, one of the major components of bio-oils. This reaction is catalyzed by many oxides, including alumina [38]: (8) 2CH3COOH→CH3COCH3 +CO2 +H2O The formation of acetone appears therefore related to the poisoning of nickel, and optimising the duration of the cracking step should prevent the formation of such detrimental by-product. 4.1.3 Overall pathways scheme The above discussed respective roles of thermal decomposition and catalytic processes are summarized in Fig. 10 . The mixture of organic compounds constituting bio-oils decomposes upon heating into “thermal” gases CO, H2, CO2, CH4, light hydrocarbons and into a large fraction of soot-type carbon (about 20% of the carbon contained in the bio-oil). The catalyst promotes the gasification of “thermal” carbon deposits via steam (and possibly dry) reforming, using the water (carbon dioxide) contained in the feed stream. In addition part of the “thermal” gases like methane and light hydrocarbons are steam-reformed by the catalyst to produce additional syn-gas, equilibrated with CO2 and H2O via the WGS reaction. All these catalytic steps contribute to increase the hydrogen yield in the presence of catalysts (from ca. 30 to 40%, Table 2). However, as a main drawback, the catalyst also promotes the formation of “catalytic” carbon deposits, as side reactions of the steam and dry reforming processes, as will be discussed in Section 4.3."
12,Effect of catalyst composition and structure,"4.2 Effect of catalyst composition and structure The two Ni-based catalysts are efficient catalysts for the cracking of bio-oil. However, their stable activity deserves some comments. The cycling between reducing and oxidising conditions at high temperature, and particularly the combustion of coke under 20% oxygen represent very severe reaction conditions. For this reason, the removal of coke from Ni-based steam reforming catalysts is generally performed with steam or hydrogen [39,40]. In our experiments, after an initial deactivation during a few sequences, the catalytic activity stabilises along the next sequences. However, a Ni loss has been evidenced for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, probably associated to the combustion of the carbon whiskers bearing Ni particles. Therefore, some irreversible deactivation might be expected in the case of Ni/Al2O3 after long-term experiments. In contrast, the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst appears structurally very stable. This cannot simply be related to the formation of surface spinels (NiAl2O4 and/or NiLa2O4), since the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst also forms initially a spinel structure. Therefore, two specific features of the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst have to be taken into account to explain its stability: • the presence of K and La additives, which both prevent Ni sintering [35,41]; • the low Ni loading, which implies that the spinel reduction will lead to highly dispersed Ni. If no large Ni0 particles are formed, the nickel can reoxidize into the spinel structure and not as NiO. Such reversible changes between surface spinel and Ni0 have been evidenced under various methane partial oxidation conditions, by XPS and X-ray diffraction [42]."
13,Coke deposition and catalyst regeneration,"4.3 Coke deposition and catalyst regeneration Two distinct types of coke deposits were evidenced on Ni-based catalysts after a cracking step, although the amount of deposited carbon was the same: on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, where rather large Ni particles are present after several cracking/regeneration sequences, carbon whiskers form during the cracking of bio-oil. In contrast, on the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, the Ni is mostly incorporated into a spinel structure, leading to the formation of an amorphous carbon layer. The formation of whiskers is due to a complex mechanism involving the carburization of Ni, the migration of carbon in (or around) the Ni particle and its nucleation into graphene layers at the metal–support interface. Defect sites (steps) of the Ni surface have been identified as the sites responsible for the nucleation of graphite, leading to the growth of filaments during methane steam reforming [43]. The growth of graphite on these step sites has also been evidenced by high resolution TEM [44]. The quasi-absence of carbon whiskers in the case of Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 can be related to the presence of additives: potassium has been proposed to bind preferentially to step defect sites of the Ni particles. A study of carbon deposition over undoped and K-doped Ni/MgO catalysts by TEM [45] also confirmed the inhibiting effect of potassium on the growth of carbon filaments, as well as on the sintering of Ni. Lanthanum can also be involved in the carbon cycle: lanthanum oxycarbonate layers have been found to decorate Ni particles under CH4/CO2 reforming conditions [46], participating as such in a bi-functional reaction mechanism with Ni and hindering the formation of coke. However, another determinant factor for the formation of whiskers is the Ni particle size: the critical nucleus of graphene is large and nucleation into whiskers cannot proceed if the facets or step edges of the Ni particles are too small [43]. A critical size for whiskers formation has been diversely reported to be >5nm [33] or >10nm [47]. Our TEM observations confirm that no whiskers are formed when the Ni is highly dispersed, as in the case of Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3. The rate of coke formation on Ni also strongly depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon, among which olefins and aromatics lead to rapid coke deposition [39,40]. The very short induction period for whiskers formation over Ni/Al2O3 observed in our experiments is in agreement with the fact that bio-oil is first decomposed into soot, containing many unsaturated compounds, which then reacts with the Ni phase, depending on its structure. On Ni/Al2O3, the soot can be catalytically transformed into whiskers, whereas in the case of Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 the soot is only transformed into bi-dimensional carbon. Whatever the catalyst, the total amount of coke deposits depends only on the primary decomposition of bio-oils into soot, as proposed in Fig. 10."
14,Interest of the sequential process,"4.4 Interest of the sequential process Our results demonstrate that the catalytic cracking of a crude bio-oil (which actually combines reforming and WGS reactions) can produce an H2-rich gas suitable for feeding a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), which can utilise directly H2 and CO as a fuel. In order to compare the hydrogen productivity obtained by continuous steam reforming with that obtained by catalytic cracking/reforming of bio-oils, additional experiments were performed under steam reforming conditions (not reported here, since carried out on different catalysts from those used in the present study). As expected, the continuous steam reforming reaction was found to lead to higher hydrogen productivities than the cracking/reforming: at 700°C, the maximum hydrogen productivity was 18 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 by sequential cracking, versus 20 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 and 37 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 by steam reforming at H2O/C ratios of 2.5 and 10, respectively. Rioche et al. [23] reported a hydrogen productivity of 32 mmol H 2 g bio-oil − 1 by steam reforming of bio-oil with a Pt/ceria–zirconia catalyst under similar conditions (740°C, H2O/C=10.8). The hydrogen yield of 40% obtained in the present study is fairly average, but could be improved by increasing the reaction temperature, which was limited here to 700°C by technical problems related to bio-oil handling. As a matter of fact, the hydrogen yields obtained by Rioche et al. by steam reforming of bio-oil [23] were also low (30–40%) at 740°C, but increased up to 60–72% at 860°C. However, the main interest of the cracking/reforming process comes from a much lower energy input. As discussed in Section 3.1, the heat generated by coke combustion was found to largely compensate the endothermicity of the cracking/reforming reaction, which might lead to an autothermal process, provided this heat is efficiently recovered."
15,Conclusion,"This study has shown that a crude bio-oil can be transformed into a hydrogen-rich gas by a sequential catalytic process. Although the hydrogen productivity is necessarily lower than that obtained by continuous steam reforming, the sequential cracking process seems well adapted to handle the large carbon deposits due to bio-oil decomposition, and their easy removal for frequent catalyst regeneration. The respective roles of the primary thermal (gas phase) decomposition of bio-oils organic molecules and the subsequent catalytic steps (steam/dry reforming and WGS) have been well identified during the cracking/reforming step. Despite severe conditions, the Ni-based catalysts rapidly reach a stabilized state ensuring stable hydrogen productivity. The two tested catalytic systems, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3, were found to lead to distinct forms of carbon deposits according to their structure. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with large nickel particles tends to form carbon filaments as side reaction of methane and thermal carbon steam reforming. The Ni particles attached to these whiskers can be lost during regeneration by carbon combustion. On the other hand, the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst keeps highly dispersed Ni particles under stabilised conditions, inhibiting whiskers formation. In this case, an amorphous carbon layer is formed during bio-oil cracking/reforming, probably arising from the trapping and agglomeration of the soot formed in the gas phase. This type of carbon is more reactive than the whiskers and is removed by combustion at lower temperatures."
