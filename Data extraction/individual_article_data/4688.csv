0,Introduction,"Green energy sources are facing an increasing demand as an alternative energy in the present fossil dependent energy economy [1]. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the prime green energy sources with versatile usage in various applications and is considered as a substitute to various liquid and fossil fuel [2]. Various research groups are now focused mainly on the production of hydrogen for fuel cell applications. Hydrogen can be produced from various sources by different facile techniques. Most of the synthetic hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels-based methods (95%), water electrolysis (4%) and the rest are produced from biomass [2]. Most commercial way of hydrogen production involves fossil fuels, where H2 is produced by thermo-catalytic processes of natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The process involves passing hot steam over a fossil fuel source in a catalytic converter, where H2 is stripped away leaving CO2 and other carbon and hydrocarbon by-products [2]. The industrial production of H2 involves the thermo-catalytic process of methanol or methane, which also leaves CO2 as a by-product [3]. The main aim of utilizing H2 as green fuel is to avoid harmful by-products emitted from conventional fuel. It is understood that the catalytic production of H2 from water holds such a potential. Both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis of water results on generation of H2 with high purity and almost no by-products [4,5]. Photocatalysis involves utilization more chemical agents to achieve a satisfactory result with an overall better energy conversion efficiency [5]. While, electrocatalysis simply involve the versatile usability of electrodes in a suitable electrolyte to produce H2 [6]. The cathodic reaction of water electrolysis produces the desired H2 gas. There are several parameters to be noted while pursuing electrochemical pathway, such as input potential, material stability, robustness of the catalyst, reaction environment and medium, conversion efficiency, reaction kinetics, long term H2 production stability, etc. [7]. Most of the precious metals such as platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, etc. based catalyst shows extraordinary catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) production [8–15]. But the cost of such precious elements, poisoning effects on their performance and their scarcity constraints its usage in a larger manner [13,16–18]. To reduce the usage of precious metals, they are substituted with transition metals, metal oxides, metal composites and metal alloys with trace or negligible amounts of noble metal elements or with non-metal supports were tested for the H2 production [9,12,19–23]. Many approaches were developed to further reduce the usage of metal and non-metals, where carbon based materials such as CNT, graphene, activated carbon, and impurity doped carbon structures were analysed for HER activity [5,9,24–40]. Out of these carbon-based materials, activated carbon holds great promises due to its producibility from various source material, high surface area, highly porous structures, comparable performance and stability vis-à-vis noble metals and very inexpensive nature [26,27,29,38,41–46]. Despite these breakthroughs and findings, such inexpensive and high efficient HER catalysts were also needed to be easily prepared in a large scale. In addition, a detailed understanding of the fundamental mechanism for doping in carbon materials has remained mystery. Activated carbon is usually derived from charcoal, biomass wastes, etc. [46]. The agricultural and food industries create various waste matters that need to be utilized and convert into the value added products [47]. Some biomass such as herbage plants of the genera clover (Trifolium) and alfalfa (Medicago); as well as the food crops soybeans (Glycine max), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), peas (Pisum), beans (Phaseolus), and various others undergoes through an interesting process called Biological nitrogen fixation [48]. It is an important process carried out by prokaryotes, leads to the reduction of molecular nitrogen from atmosphere to ammonia, subsequently assimilated in amino acids that serve as nutrients for plants [48]. Nitrogen fixated biomass previously shown a growing potential in the regions of batteries, supercapacitors and electrocatalyst. Liu et al. have developed S- and N-co doped activated carbon from N-fixated biomass for high performance electrocatalytic H2 production [35]. Zhan et al. prepared nitrogen pre-fixated carbon for electrochemical supercapacitors [49]. Apart from supercapacitors, peanut shell based nitrogen pre-fixated activated carbon electrodes exhibited as a high performance anode material for rechargeable Li- and Na-ion batteries [43]. The activated carbon is a well-known porous material, with large specific surface area, which is useful in various application, including electrocatalysis, sensors, energy conversion systems, energy storage devices, etc. [47]. There are namely two methods exists for the facile preparation of activated carbon, one is physical activation and another one is chemical activation. Among these methods, it was reported that chemical activation has given very effective activated carbon with high specific surface area [50]. The preparation of activated carbon by chemical activation is a process in which carbonization and activation is carried out under inert or desired atmosphere. Initially the precursor is mixed with activating agent. Both carbonization and activation temperature ranges between 300 °C to 800 °C. The most commonly used chemical activating agents are KOH, H2SO4, ZnCl2, Na2CO3, K2CO3, NaOH, H3PO4, etc. [50]. In our present study, a facile approach was followed by taking advantage of the rich nitrogen contents in peanut shell, where nitrogen self-doped porous carbon nanosheets were produced by controlled pyrolysis at higher temperatures. The prepared activated carbon nanosheets was then characterized by various physicochemical techniques to analyse its structural and morphological features. To best of our knowledge, for the first time the electrocatalytic activity of the activated carbon nanosheets obtained from peanut shell for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction is performed under in acidic media."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Carbon black (Super P® Conductive, 99.9%), Platinum on carbon (20 wt% Hi-Spec), Ruthenium oxide (RuO2, 99.9%), and Nafion® 117 solution in low aliphatic alcohols (5%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich India Pvt. Ltd., India. Potassium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (AR grade) and sulfuric acid (AR grade), were purchased from Alfa Aesar India Pvt. Ltd., India. Peanut shell wastes were collected from a local market place and used as a source material after pre-treatment. Millipore® water was used for all of the experimental work carried out in the present study."
3,Synthesis of activated carbon nanosheets from peanut shell waste,"2.2 Synthesis of activated carbon nanosheets from peanut shell waste In typical, the activated carbon nanosheets were prepared by a facile thermal pyrolysis process aided by chemical activation technique in a controlled N2 atmosphere as shown in Scheme 1a. The collected precursor material was initially rinsed in conventional water until the cloudy residue in washing disappears. The precursor was then washed with Millipore water and the washing is again repeated with ethanol for further use. The washed precursor was then oven dried at 100 °C for 14 h. The dried sample was then collected and grounded into fine powder. The grounded powder was taken in a crucible boat and placed in a tubular furnace. The initial carbonization temperature for the precursor was fixed around 400 °C for about 4 h under N2 atmosphere. After carbonization, the residual carbon (hereafter mentioned as PSC, which means Peanut shell carbon) was recovered for the addition of activating agent. The activating agent used in this work was potassium hydroxide (KOH). The KOH was properly weighed and mixed with carbonized sample at 3:1 weight ratio; and activated by annealed at ~700 °C under N2 atmosphere for 2.0 h [46,51–54]. A suggestion of such model representing chemical activation of carbon by KOH is shown in Scheme 1b [51]. After the activation of carbon materials, the products were recovered and washed with 0.5 M HCl and Millipore water to remove potassium salts and other residues formed during activation [55]. The washed sample was dried overnight at 100 °C and stored in a sterilised bottle. The sample will be hereby called as Peanut Shell Activated Carbon (denoted as PSAC in further discussions)."
4,Physicochemical characterization,"2.3 Physicochemical characterization X-ray diffraction (D8 Advanced Twin, BRUKER) was employed to investigate the crystal structure of the activated carbon materials. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C were recorded using a volumetric adsorption apparatus (Autosorb IQ series, Quantachrome Instruments) to analyse the textural properties of the samples. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (TENSOR 27, BRUKER OPTIK) were measured using a KBr pellet with a measurement range of 400–4000 cm−1 to observe changes in the specific functional group of the carbon materials. The transition between sp 2 and sp 3 hybridization and defect formation in the carbon samples were studied by Raman spectroscopy (LABRAM HR evolution, HORIBA) using a laser with a wavelength of 632 nm and power of 50%. To observe the morphology of the material and compositions, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images and energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were recorded on a FEI Quanta HR-SEM (FEG 200) microscopy system. The nanostructures of as-prepared samples were detected by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on JEOL (JEM-2100 Plus) system under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The elemental analysis of the synthesized material was studied using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) with a Thermo Fisher (MultiLab 2000) spectrometer, fitted with a twin anode X-ray source using Al-Kα radiation (1486.7 eV) and the elemental composition was quantified by Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). The obtained XPS spectrum was fitted using XPSPEAK 41 software and the error was minimized to χ2 < 3."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements were performed using a Biologic electrochemical workstation (VSP-300) in a standard three-electrode system, consisting of a modified glassy carbon working electrode (GCE, diameter: 3.0 mm; geometrical surface area: 0.07 cm2), platinum (Pt) as the counter electrode, and a mercury/mercurous sulphate with 0.5 M H2SO4 (MMS) as the reference electrode. For all the measurements, the potentials reported based on reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) by converting the measured potentials (vs MMS) based on the following equation: (1) E RHE = E MMS + E o MMS × 0.059 pH The current density (i) presented in every data was normalized to compensate the geometric surface area of the electrode. The catalyst ink (~13.3 mg mL−1) was prepared by the dispersion of 2.0 mg of the prepared activated carbon powders in 150 μL of 6:1 (v:v) water/Nafion (5%) mixed solvents solution where amount of Nafion was employed to be ~0.83%. This mixture was sonicated for 10 min. Then, 5.0 μL of the above solution was drop cast onto the surface of a mirror polished glassy carbon electrode. The as-prepared catalyst film was dried at room temperature and further used to study the electrocatalytic activity of the material. The polarization curves are automatically iR-corrected by the instrumentation software to avoid the interference of the ohmic resistive response on the testing material."
6,Results and discussion,"Structures of the as-synthesized PSC and PSAC were initially examined using X-ray diffraction measurements and are shown in Fig. 1a. The red curve of Fig. 1a shows the XRD of PSC, revealed the amorphous nature of carbon. Due to activation, PSAC shows fine pattern composed of several sharp peaks (Fig. 1a (blue curve). The obtained graphitic peaks at 2θ = 26.5° can be assigned to the graphitic (002) crystalline planes (JCPDS: 74-2328). The PSAC showed a less intensity of (002) plane, suggesting the cause to be the increase of surface area, due to the structural change caused by KOH activation [51]. Other additional peaks observed for PSAC, associated to graphitic C3N4 (JCPDS: 75-0444), indicating the presence of nitrogen species in the carbon structure. The peak at 13.28° can be indexed to the (100) crystal plane of C3N4, corresponding to the ring-shaped part of triazine or piperazine like structures [56]. From the XRD patterns, it can be clearly observed that, activation process influences the carbon planes, thereby creating the necessary surface modifications. The BET N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of PSAC can be observed from Fig. 1b. As shown in Fig. 1b. the obtained isotherm exhibited the IUPAC classified Type (I) adsorption isotherm [46]. The BET specific surface area (SBET) of PSAC was observed to be 2338.5 m2 g−1. As predicted from previous studies, by KOH activation, surface area can be improved up to >2000 m2 g−1 [51]. The improvement in the surface area of the PSAC was due to the interaction of the carbon frame work with gaseous carbonized products such as CO2, CH4, H2O, etc. and also by the interaction of various other compounds formed by the interaction of metallic salts during activation [46,55]. This larger surface area of PSAC can provide more active sites, which is beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity [57]. After post treatment, these intermediates leave the material's structure, while also leaving pores behind. The curves of pore size distribution can be found in the inset of Fig. 1b, shows the pore size exists between 30 Å and 75 Å, indicating their presence in the mesoporous regime. It is clearly observed that the surface characteristics of PSAC were significantly improved by the activation process, resulting in high surface area and porosity, as shown in Table 1 . The functional components of both PSC and PSAC were investigated using the FT-IR studies. As shown in Fig. 2a, new functional moieties were observed for PSAC in the range of ~1000–1500 cm−1, associated with the stretching vibrations of –C ≡ N. The observed broad stretching bands of –OH groups were observed at ~3400 cm−1, suggesting the KOH interaction with the carbon matrix, which results in the formation of –C=O (2355 cm−1), –C=C (1500–1600 cm−1), –C-H (2970 cm−1), etc. FT-IR analysis, suggests that the nitrogen moiety was formed with carbon framework, and additionally several new functional groups were formed, indicating the successful KOH activation process [55]. The graphitic characteristics of both PSC and PSAC were further studied by Raman measurements and are depicted in Fig. 2b. As displayed in Fig. 2b, the first order D and G bands of graphitic carbon were observed in both the PSC and PSAC pattern around 1345 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 respectively, with changes in their intensity prior to- and after activation. Generally, the D-band refers to the characteristic disordered (or) curved graphitic sheets, corresponding to the presence of dangling bonds in terminal planes or other lattice distortions in the carbon framework. It is assigned to the lattice vibrational mode of graphitic structures with A 1g symmetry [58], while the G-band occurs due to the E 2g symmetry corresponding to the ideal 2D graphitic lattice vibrations [35,58]. The D-band intensity (iD) of the PSAC was significantly improved compared to PSC, indicating the formation of more defective sites on the structure due to activation of KOH. The band intensity ratio commonly knows iD/iG ratio was calculated for both PSC and PSAC. The band intensity ratio of the PSC was increased from 0.78 to 0.99, after activation revealing about the decreased graphitic order or improved defective nature. The measured band intensity ratio of both PSC and PSAC was <1, suggesting that the structures are less likely to have pristine graphite like structure. Hence, the defects on the structure formed during the activation process, have a potential impact on the degree of graphitization of the carbon [43]. The chemical activation process improved the defects sites that correspond to the distortion of the structure, co-ordinated by the nitrogen presence in the carbon structure, which may improve the effective catalytic sites in the material's structure [27]. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images shown in the Fig. 3a and b, corresponds to PSC and PSAC respectively. It can be seen that before activation crumbled and disoriented sheet-like structure was observed from Fig. 3a. After activation, multilayer or short stacked sheet-like morphology was observed from Fig. 3b. The obtained sheet-like morphology was further studied using high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) technique. Fig. 4a depicts the TEM images of the PSC where, a disoriented multi-layer sheet-like structure can be observed. Fig. 4b displays the TEM images of the PSAC, which reveals the curved graphitic sheet-like structures. Fig. 4c shows the (002) crystal plane of graphitic carbon, it supports the discussion from XRD studies on the broadening and decrement in the height of (002) crystal plane. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was recorded for PSAC and is shown in Fig. 4d. From the obtained plane diffraction pattern, bright white dots were observed in the well-defined ring patterns, indicating the high crystalline nature of the material. From the microscopy studies, it can be clearly observed that PSAC possess a short stacked nanosheets-like structure with well-crystalline nature. The EDS spectra of both PSC and PSAC were recorded and depicted in Fig. 5 . The as-prepared PSAC possess nitrogen moiety of ~6.6%, which can be observed form Fig. 5b. This supports the suggestion of nitrogen presence in the activated carbon framework, which was previously discussed in both XRD (Fig. 1a) and FT-IR analysis (Fig. 2a). The surface elemental composition present in the PSAC was further identified using XPS analysis. The survey spectrum of the PSAC (Fig. 6 a) shows the presence of C, O, and N. Fig. 6b shows the de-convoluted spectrum of C 1 s, thereby revealing the presence of peaks at ~284.5, ~285.7 and ~288.5 eV, corresponding to –C=C, –C-O/-C-N and –C=O/-C=N groups, respectively [59]. Fig. 6c shows the N 1 s spectrum confirming the presence of N in the carbon matrix; the peaks at ~398.3, ~399.8, ~400.8 and ~403 eV are ascribed to pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic and pyridine oxide nature of nitrogen atoms, respectively [35,59]. The quantitative estimation of different nitrogen species by ESCA suggested a maximum graphitic-N (38.7%), then pyrrolic-N (34.5%), pyridonic-N (25.7%) and remaining 1% of pyridine oxide. Such quantitative investigation confirms the presence of nitrogen species at different structural locations on the carbon matrix. The O 1s spectrum of Fig. 6d revealed two major signals located at ~530.8 and ~532.8 eV corresponding to –C=O and –C-OH groups, respectively. Thus, the XPS spectral results further confirm the presence of C, N, and O corroborating the FTIR spectral results discussed in the previous section. All the electrochemical behaviour of PSAC was measured at ambient conditions in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic medium, where generally the performance of carbon material shows a significant improvement in HER catalytic activity comparing the basic medium [25]. The electrochemical activation of the catalyst was performed by CV scan in a potential range from −0.22 V to +0.28 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 600 continuous cycles (Fig. 7 a). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed to obtain the HER polarization curves at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. An excellent improvement was observed in the i-V response from the initial cycling, any further increment in the cycling only led to negligible improvement. The change in polarization curves before and after cycling can be seen from (Fig. 7b), where the curve depicts the electrochemical activation of the material in acidic medium and the formation of more surface active sites in acidic condition [60,61]. After initial cycling of PSAC, the polarization curves of PSAC were recorded and compared with a set of materials consisting two carbonaceous (Super P® and PSAC) and two metallic catalyst material (Pt/C and RuO2). As shown in Fig. 7c Super P® shows a weak HER activity followed by PSAC, RuO2 and Pt/C. Generally, to be an ideal HER catalyst the material should provide high current response to less overpotential values, and also a small HER onset potential (where the H2 evolution behaviour will be initially observed from the i-V response) comparable to that of commercially available catalysts [31]. The onset potential of PSAC was observed to be −0.08 V, which is lower than the compared commercial carbon material and, comparable to that of commercially available metal-based catalyst. The HER activity of any electrocatalytic material will be generally benchmarked by comparing their overpotential (ηHER) values @ 10 mA cm−2. Platinum observed to have the least overpotential around 0.03 V @ 10 mA cm−2, matches with the reports from previous studies [62,63]. The overpotential of PSAC was measured about 0.39 V @ 10 mA cm−2, higher than that of Pt/C and RuO2. But while comparing a metal free carbon, Super P® shows a higher ηHER value of 0.16 V more than that of PSAC. The onset potential, overpotential and the i-V response on increasing overpotential of PSAC was comparable with, many transition metal doped carbon and better than some impurity doped graphene structures [26,29,30,37]. The tafel plot is a necessary study to analyse the kinetics of HER electrocatalytic material, thereby gives an insight and interpretation on the mechanism of the hydrogen evolution [27]. The linear portions of low overpotential values of the LSV polarization curves were used to derive the tafel slopes of the material. The tafel plot of different catalytic material measured can be seen from Fig. 7d. The Tafel slopes determined from the plot are 34.4, 46.9, 75.7 and 124.2 mV dec−1 for Pt/C, RuO2, PSAC and Super P respectively. The slopes obtained for the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 are in accordance with previous reports [31,64,65]. A tafel slope of about 75.7 mV dec−1 was obtained for PSAC, indicates the higher electrocatalytic activity of the material, and excellent i-V response for an applied low overpotential values [66]. The HER kinetics observed at the slope of 75.7 mV dec−1 corresponds to the Volmer- Heyrovsky pathway, where the hydrogen adsorption and desorption occurs consecutively in a two-step process [13,27]. From the Tafel slope measurements, it can be inferred that the material possesses lower tafel slope values indicating higher HER activity by a two-step process mechanism (Volmer- Heyrovsky pathway), [27] and also depicts high rate of electron transfer, which was comparable with previously reported materials as presented in Table 2 . The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were also recorded in order to understand the faster electron transfer kinetics in prior to- and after CV continuous cycles (Fig. 8 ). The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) was enormously decreased to 29.1 Ω from 298.3 Ω after 600 continuous CV cycles, significantly improved the HER performance. The enhanced HER activity of the catalyst was due to the attribution of decreased charge-transfer resistance [71]. The long-term stability of the material is an important parameter to be considered for an HER electrocatalyst. The initial short-term stability of the material was carried out by chronopotentiometry (CP) at different current density values of 5.0, 10 and 15 mA cm−2 for about 1800 s can be seen in Fig. 9 . Then the long-term stability was initiated by same CP method with a current density input of 10 mA cm−2 for about 10 h. As shown in Fig. 10 , the stability curve shows short decrement and recovery in the potential response. It was visually confirmed that, the behaviour was due to the periodic accumulation (decrement of potential value) and discharge (recovery to the previous default potential state) of H2 bubbles from the surface of the working electrode and previous reports has shown such behaviour during long-term stability [59]. LSV polarization curves were recorded before and after long-term stability shown in the inset of Fig. 10. It can be seen that, there is no significant changes observed from the polarization curves, indicating the good stability of the material. From the electrochemical studies, it was observed that, PSAC possess high HER activity, with faster reaction kinetics and good long-term stability. Such electrochemical activity of the material suggests that PSAC has a good potential for metal-free enhanced HER system."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, metal-free nitrogen pre-fixated activated carbon nanosheets were successfully prepared by facile thermal pyrolysis of abundantly available peanut shell waste via chemical activation technique. Based on the physio-chemical analysis, PSAC carbon materials were observed to possess different nitrogen species, which was successfully doped in the lattice of the carbon framework. The obtained PSAC materials showed a multilayer or short-stacked nanosheets-like structure with a high specific surface area of about 2338.5 m2 g−1 with uniform mesoporous nature. For the first time, we have successfully analysed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards H2 production by activated carbon derived from peanut shell biomass. Electrochemical studies reveal that the PSAC possess a less negative onset potential of ~0.08 V, a small Tafel slope of ~75.7 mV dec−1 and an excellent long-term stability. Based on our studies, we represent a facile approach of deriving activated carbon nanosheets from nitrogen pre-fixated structures, which unveils path to a new paradigm of high-performance metal-free electrocatalysts, for sustainable energy conversion applications."
