0,Introduction,"In the context of a proposed hydrogen economy, the development of methods to produce hydrogen have been of increased interest in recent years [1–3]. Nickel complexes have received attention, as they have been shown to efficiently effect the electrode-driven reduction of protons to hydrogen, a process of interest in industrial applications [4,5]. The reverse process, oxidation of hydrogen to protons and electrons has also been achieved [6]. The mechanistic understanding gained from this reversible, biomimetic process [7,8] has been used to harness reducing equivalents in the reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels [9] Both organometallic [10] and coordination pincer complexes [11–13] are electrocatalysts for 2H+ +2e− →H2. Incorporation of redox-active substructures within the ligand framework of a metal complex has proved to be an effective strategy to facilitate multielectron reactions [14]. These ligand-based electron-reservoirs [15] act as either electron acceptors or donors in catalytic processes, thus imparting new or enhanced reactivity in both chemical and electrochemical applications [11,14,16]. They hold interest in their potential ability to facilitate multielectron chemistry in inexpensive, first row metals that normally prefer 1e redox steps. The main emphasis of this paper is the synthesis and characterization of two novel, potentially redox-active ligands, N5∗ and N7 , containing pendant base naphthyridine groups, together with Zn and Ni complexes both of N7 (Fig. 1 ) and of the known [14b] N5 . A crystal structure verifies the ability of N5 to engage in hydrogen bonding with a Ni-bound aqua ligand. Analogous Zn and Ni complexes of N5∗ proved too insoluble for detailed study but we retain the ligand synthesis here because we believe it will prove useful for the coordination chemistry community as an analogue of N5 that no longer has the ability to hydrogen bond to a metal-bound ligand because of the remote placement of the distal N atom. We report the reductive electrochemical behavior of the Zn and Ni complexes and their possible implications in catalysis. N5 and N7 can be considered doubly non-innocent in permitting ligand-based redox-activity as well as having pendant, potentially H-bonding sites. We therefore believe that all three ligands will prove useful in future."
1,Synthesis and characterization,"2,2′:6′,2″-Terpyridines have been explored extensively [17] as ligands and more recently have also received attention in catalytic [18–20] and energy-relevant photoelectrochemical applications [21–23] such as tethering molecular catalysts onto semiconductor surfaces [24,25]. Fig. 1 (left) shows a known ligand of this type, N5 , that was reported in 2005 along with its mononuclear Ru complex by Zong and Thummel [26]. This proved to be highly active for water oxidation, and although the role of the pendant N-atom of the naphthyridine remains a matter for discussion, the proposed mechanism may involve the active participation of the naphthyridine arm in the coordination and deprotonation of a bound water [27]. Boyer et al. [28] have investigated the water oxidation and water reduction activity of a series of mononuclear Ru complexes with a pyridine-2-(1,8-naphthyridine) ligand. The catalytic activity was highly dependent on whether the pendant basic sites were proximal or distal to the metal center. This prompted us to expand the polyaza ligand series with two new derivatives: N7 and N5∗ (Fig. 1) to study their electrochemical properties to look for ligand-centered reduction. The ligands were synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a Friedländer condensation of 2,6-diacetylpyridine and the corresponding nicotinamide (Fig. 2 ); their Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes were then prepared by standard methods. (See Supporting information for details). The compounds showed limited solubility in both acetonitrile and water: in particular, the Zn and Ni derivatives of N5∗ were too insoluble for detailed study and were therefore set aside. We retain the synthesis of the N5∗ ligand in this report in case it may prove useful."
2,Electrochemistry of 1Zn and 2Zn showing redox activity of the ligands,"The delocalized ligand framework was designed in the hope of promoting reductive ligand-based redox activity and the pendant N atoms were thought likely to favor both H-bonding and proton shuttling and thus facilitate catalytic proton reduction with H2 formation. To probe this idea, we synthesized 1Zn and 2Zn and studied their electrochemical response in acetonitrile at a glassy C electrode. Interestingly, 1Zn did indeed show what we assign to a one-electron reduction process at −0.81V vs. NHE (Fig. 3 left) which we assign to the ligand as Zn is redox-inactive. A similar analysis for 2Zn showed two one-electron responses at −0.49 and −1.05V versus NHE (Fig. 3 right). Although affected by solubility problems, the redox activity was clearly apparent. We cannot be certain that the complexes retain their structure in solution, although a 4-coordinate complex can be excluded because it would show an NMR spectrum. The multielectron ligand redox behavior of 2Zn suggests that two reducing equivalents could be hosted within the ligand framework without reduction of the metal center. This is particularly interesting since the reduction of protons to hydrogen is a 2e− process. Indeed, Wieghardt and coworkers [29] have reported catalytic alcohol oxidation by Zn complexes with redox-active ligands. Our Zn complexes were not catalytically active for water reduction, however, suggesting that Zn was not able to form the needed hydride intermediates; hydrides being better known for Ni than for Zn, we next studied the analogous Ni compounds."
3,Ni Electrochemistry,"The Ni analogues of 1Zn and 2Zn have a quite different electrochemical response from the Zn complexes. 1Ni exhibits two reduction features at −0.87V (broad, irreversible) and −1.48V (Fig. 4 left) respectively. Given the pattern of electrochemical behavior of 1Zn , the responses for 1Ni are likely due to a one-electron reduction of the ligand followed by a NiII →NiI metal-centered reduction. In contrast with these results, 1Ni showed an irreversible feature at −0.51V versus NHE followed by a second reduction at −1.05V versus NHE. In order to pinpoint the potentials of the irreversible waves, we performed square-wave voltammetry (SWV). Using this technique we also attempted to assign the number of electrons for each of the observed transitions, by comparing the electrochemical response against a ferrocene standard SWV at the same concentration as the analyte under study. This analysis is of course contingent upon the diffusional coefficient of ferrocene being comparable with the diffusion coefficients of 1Ni and 2Ni . We see two 1e− responses in Fig. 4 corresponding to 1Ni but a quite different behavior for 2Ni , which shows a reduction feature assignable to a 2e− event at −0.51V. Since 2Zn had a reduction signal at −0.49 versus NHE, we believe the −0.51V response of 2Ni corresponds to a combination of a 1e− reduction of the ligand and a 1e- reduction of the metal center at the same potential. This feature is then followed by a reduction akin to the second reduction feature of 2Zn , which would correspond to a ligand centered event. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of complex adsorption on the electrode surface. This would bring some uncertainty to the interpretation of the number of electrons from square wave voltammetry. In order to establish the structure of our Ni compounds, we attempted to crystallize 1Ni and 2Ni from water but were only able to obtain a crystal structure of 1Ni using a mixture of water/methanol (Fig. 5 ). The structure indicated the role of a pendant pyridine in moderately strong hydrogen bonding with an in-plane water molecule, the proton of which was located (O1⋯N1=2.767(6)A; O1–H–N1=150(8)°); the outer sphere O⋯Br distance indicates a rather weaker interaction (O2⋯Br2=3.188(4)A; O2–H–Br2=164(8)°) but the inner sphere distance (O1⋯Br1=3.42A; O1–H–Br1=114(6)°) is constrained by the geometry. Ni(II) is notorious for showing 4-, 5- and 6- coordination depending on conditions so we do not attempt to define the coordination number in solution. A similar structure is expected to occur for 2Ni but X-ray-quality crystals could not be obtained in this case. The crystal structure of Fig. 5 indicates that an in-plane water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to a naphthyridine side-arm of the 1Ni pincer ligand. This interaction may lower the pK a of the remaining basic site, thus decreasing the likelihood of a second protonation event. Reduction to Ni(I) would be expected to increase the basicity of the N atoms, however. Density functional theory calculations at the UB3LYP/LACVP/6-311G∗ level [30,31] using optimized structures based on the crystal structure of 1Ni have been included in the SI (Fig. 5; Supporting information). In order to test the comparative catalytic abilities of 1Ni and 2Ni for water reduction, we performed bulk electrolysis at three different different pH values with 4.5μM catalyst loading and then calculated the number of turnovers observed after 30min of electrolysis, after the necessary background subtractions (Table 1 ). The pH dependence of catalysis differed for the two ligands, N5 and N7. At pH 1, both catalyst precursors have similar turnover numbers at an applied overpotential of 440mV (55mol H2/mol catalyst for 1Ni versus 46mol H2/mol catalyst 2Ni ). 1Ni showed the highest turnover at pH 4, releasing 136mol H2/mol catalyst at 560mV of applied overpotential, whereas 2Ni only showed a third of the activity under the same conditions: 46mol H2/mol catalyst. Surprisingly, 2Ni showed great activity at pH 7 with a turnover number of 224mol H2/mol catalyst compared to 1Ni where only a modest 7.6 turnovers were observed at 690mV of applied overpotential. The Faradaic yields (Supplementary data) are strongly dependent on the conditions. For 1Ni they are adequate (80%±4%) at pH 1 in KCl/HCl, but much poorer at lower pH in phosphate buffers. For 2Ni they are similarly adequate at pH 1 and 7 but not at pH 4. Heterogeneity problems can be misleading in catalysis if the catalyst precursor is converted to a heterogeneous catalyst during the reaction [32]. In the present case, we verified that the electrode, once rinsed and returned to a solution containing electrolyte alone with no Ni complex present, gave no current above background, so a catalytic deposit on the electrode is excluded. We cannot definitively exclude a nanoparticulate material being formed in solution, however."
4,Conclusion,"We report the new N7 and N5∗ ligand frameworks, designed to be redox active as well as possessing pendant H-bonding sites. Our results suggest that precatalyst 2Ni is indeed capable of accepting two electrons within the ligand framework, whereas compound 1Ni can only host one electron in this way. Moreover, precatalyst 2Ni , having a 2e− redox-active ligand, has been shown to act as an active precursor for electrocatalytic water reduction under neutral conditions."
