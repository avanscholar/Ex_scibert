0,Introduction,"The contamination of environment as well as the increase of fossil fuels prices are the driving forces for search of new, environmentally friendly and cheap sources of energy. Among different proposed solutions, the application of hydrogen as an efficient energy carrier seem to be unavoidable. Application of this environmentally friendly element can be the solution for future. Burning of hydrogen either chemically or electrochemically generate 122 kJ g−1 of energy what indicates three times better energetic efficiency than any fuel based on hydrocarbons. At present, the most important task for hydrogen implementation as an energy carrier rely on its large scale and cheap production without use of fossil fuels. Among different methods of renewable hydrogen generation only biological, thermochemical, photocatalytical or photoelectrochemical processes can be seriously considered in the future [1]. At the moment microbiological methods seems to be the most advanced. All these processes are performed under mild conditions of temperature and pressure, do not generate toxic contaminations of environment and are renewable. The main advantages of microbiological methods of hydrogen generation rely on the possibility of utilization of industrial and municipal wastewaters, significant decrease of costs of production and simplicity of the processes [2–8]. Our earlier studies showed the possibility of use of brewery and dairy wastewater [9,10] as well as the glycerol contaminated wastewaters originated from oil transestrification process [11–13] as the efficient source of organic carbon for microbial hydrogen generation processes. The large scale production of ethyl alcohol is based on utilization of cane sugar, corn, potatoes, grains, wood hydrolyzates, molasses as well as sulfites waste, as the main source of carbohydrates. In all cases of alcoholic fermentation the yeasts of upper fermentation (e.g. Saccharomyces cerrvisiae) are required. Considering the agricultural efficiency (l/ha), production of ethyl alcohol from corn is very efficient because it overcomes even the yields of those obtained from wheat. The efficiency of C2H5OH production based on corn varies between 300 and 360 L per ton of the grain used as the substrate. This generate significant amounts of wastewaters. This is the mixture of all water soluble components after starch isolation from corn. Certain part of dried distillery waste is used as excellent source of vital components used for cattle feeding. It contains ∼23–29 wt.% of proteins, 3–12 wt.% of fats and 3–6 wt.% of mineral components. On the other hand the cane molasses based on distillery effluent contains up to 10–11 wt.% of solids [14]. Directly after the alcohol production other types of waste contains lower amount dry mass (3–5 wt.%) [14,15]. Nevertheless, all these wastes can be used efficiently in microbiological hydrogen generation. This paper is an attempt to establish the best conditions for hydrogen production from distillery wastewaters under laboratory conditions."

2,"Inoculum, medium and procedures","2.1 Inoculum, medium and procedures Inoculum. Anaerobic digested sludge originating from municipal purification unit was boiled for 15 min, and next frozen at −20 °C. Before each inoculation the defrosted sludge was kept at 4 °C for 2 h. The initial and final count of specific strains of bacteria was determined applying agar base for germination. The amount of Clostridium was identified with API 20A tests, Enterobacteriacae with API 20E, whereas Bacillus with API 20E and 50 CHB tests. Distillery waste water originated from local distillery was not sterilized. Medium and procedure. Medium containing 20 or 40 vol.% of distillery wastewater was enriched with the following components in grams per liter: 1 NaHCO3, 0.5 NH4Cl, 0.25 KH2PO4, 0.25 K2HPO4, 0.32 MgSO4·4H2O, microelements – 0.05 FeCl3, 0.032 NiSO4, 0.05 CaCl2, 0.007 Na2B4O7·H2O, 0.014 (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.023 ZnCl2, CoCl3·H2O, 0.01 CuCl2·2H2O and 0.03 MnCl2·4H2O [13]. The batch tests in 60 ml glass reactors were performed separately in triplicate (working capacity – 30 ml). Samples were inoculated with 10, 15 or 25 vol.% of inoculum (biomass content in inoculum: 2.5, 3.8 and 6.4 g VSS/l, respectively). Diluted solution of NaOH was applied for correction of the initial pH in the inoculated samples to the value of 5.5. After deaeration of samples with argon, all samples were sealed with silicon rubber membrane and incubated at 37 °C with agitation (150 rpm). First measurements were performed usually after 6 h. Next tests were performed subsequently in 6 h intervals. All tests were performed in two separate series in triplicate. Each series lasted 72 h."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The H2 and CO2 content of evolved biogas was analyzed with GC technique (GC-3800 from Varian equipped with TCD and capillary column CARBOPLOT P7 – temperature 100 °C and nitrogen as a carrier gas). The volume of generated hydrogen was measured by injection (gas-tight syringe) of known capacity of accumulated gases onto chromatographic column and calculated on the basis of calibration curves. Two maxima originating from H2 and CO2 were analyzed. The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols was analyzed with GC equipped with FID detector. Capillary column VF-WAXms from Varian was applied for the separation of the liquid metabolites. Samples for metabolite analysis were centrifuged for 7 min at 3000 rpm and obtained filtrate was centrifuged again for 7 min but at 12500 rpm before each injection. The elemental analysis of wastewater and the applied digested sludge (C, H, N, O content) was performed in triplicate using elemental analyzer – Vario ELIII Elementary, whereas metal content was established applying emission spectrometer from Varian (ICP-OES Vista – MPX). The amount of total solids (TS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined according to the Standard Methods [16]. The loss of organic compounds (ΔCOD) was monitored with dichromate method, whereas concentration of phosphates was analyzed by colorimetric method with ammonium molybdate applying DU640 UV–vis spectrometer (at 700 nm) [16]. The modified Gompertz equation was applied for calculations of cumulative amounts of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [13]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Inoculum concentration,"3.1 Inoculum concentration Characteristics of the applied active sludge and corn distillery wastewater is presented in Table 1 . The elemental analysis and the ΔCOD values indicate that concentration of organic carbon is much higher in wastewater than in active sludge. In all experiments the activated sludge was boiled to avoid methanation whereas the non-sterilized waste was applied because no methane was detected in the gaseous products during distillery wastes fermentation. Three different concentration of inoculum (10, 15 and 25% v/v) were applied in tests with distillery waste water at the initial concentration of 20% v/v and at pH equal 5.5. Fig. 1 and data in Table 2 indicate that an increase of inoculum concentration from 2.5 to 6.4 g VSS/l (10–25% v/v) causes slight decrease in the amount of generated hydrogen. The amount of generated hydrogen drops from 0.74 to 0.62 l H2/l medium whereas the specific yield of the process is lowered three times (from 0.3 to 0.097 l H2/l/g VSS). The change of inoculum concentration does not influence the lag time duration. When S 0/X 0 increased (waste conc./inoculum conc.) the amount of generated hydrogen was higher. Different laboratories, applying different strains of bacteria, studied the effect of inoculum concentration on the yield of hydrogen [17–23]. Kotay et al. [19] studying generation of hydrogen with Bacillus coagulans in presence of glucose found an increase in hydrogen production up to 10% v/v of inoculum concentration. Higher concentrations of inoculum, similarly to our experiments, resulted in lower amount of the evolved hydrogen. These experiments suggest that at higher concentrations of inoculum the organic substrates are much more involved in biomass formation rather then in hydrogen production. Similar studies [20] with Clostridium bacteria and inoculum concentrations varying between 5 and 20% v/v showed the best performance for 10% v/v. An application of thermophilic bacteria and food wastewater as the source of organic carbon showed again the best effects at concentration of inoculum at 10% v/v [22]. However, application of the seed sludge containing Clostridium sp. [20] resulted in an increase of hydrogen volume up to 3% v/v of the inoculum. Above this value an inhibitition effect by products (VFA's) was observed. Argun et al. [23] applying the mixed culture of bacteria (conc. between 0.5 and 5 g/l) and grounded wheat established the best conditions for hydrogen generation at inoculum concentration close to 1.1 g/l. These studies show that kind of applied bacteria, their age and substrate concentration influence the total volume of hydrogen formed. In all these experiments authors tried to establish the best conditions for hydrogen generation. In our studies, changing both inoculum concentration and initial concentration of distillery wastewaters it was established the maximum of hydrogen obtained at the S 0/X 0 = 2.2. Here, the concentrations of wastewater and inoculum were 40% v/v and 25% v/v, respectively. The amount of generated hydrogen was close to 1 l/l medium."
6,Wastewater concentration and pH,"3.2 Wastewater concentration and pH Three sets of experiments were performed with distillery wastewater (40% v/v) at different pH values. The initial pH in non-regulated systems was 4.6–4.8, whereas in regulated systems the initial values of pH were adjusted to 5.5 and 6.0. The choice of these was dictated by earlier studies with glucose and glycerol [11,13]. Data obtained in present experiments are shown in Table 3 . It was found that change of the initial pH from 5.5 to 6.0 does not influence the volume and rate of generated hydrogen. In the experiments performed without correction of the initial pH the amount of generated hydrogen was three times lower than in systems with regulated pH (compare data in Table 3). Moreover, it was observed fourfold drop in specific yield Y and the extend of the lag phase to 17 h. The pH values of 5.5 and 6.0 influences the metabolism and directing it toward generation of butyric acid. The influence of pH on generation of liquid metabolites was presented by Yu et al. [24] who applied rice winery wastewater as the source of organic carbon in fermentation process. They established that at pH equal 4.5 the production of propionate and ethanol is favored, whereas in experiments with pH of 5.5 and 6.0 mainly acetate and butyrate is formed. Moreover, it was found that hydrogen production is favored when butyric to acetic ratio (HBu/HAc) is high (from 3 to 5) [21–26]. The relationship between applied substrates and pH was studied by Van Ginkel et al. [27] and Khanal et al. [28] and showed that for sucrose and starch, as organic carbon sources, the optimum pH value should be 4.5. On the other hand Vijayaraghavan and Ahmad [29] applying oil mill residues in biohydrogen generation obtained the best efficiencies with pH equal 5.0, independently of the substrate concentration. In order to establish the best conditions for hydrogen generation series of experiments with different concentrations of distillery wastewater were performed. The two-fold increase of waste concentration (from 20% v/v to 40% v/v) with constant inoculum content (25% v/v) resulted in 40% higher volume of hydrogen, much higher reaction rate and shortening of the lag time by 2 h (see data in Table 4 .). While concentration of wastewater was rising from 20 to 40% v/v, the total ΔCOD increased from 3.9 to 5.5 g O2/l. Here, a higher ΔCOD values remain proportional to the content of organic compounds introduced to the medium. Similar effect was observed by Yu et al. [24] who found the increase of reaction rate but decrease of substrate yield. However, measurements of soluble ΔCOD in wastewater after centrifugation showed an increase by 4 g O2/l for 20% v/v and by 7 g O2/l for 40% v/v, respectively. This effect can result from formation of higher quantities of soluble metabolites from insoluble compounds present in the wastewater. Literature data show that too high concentration of the waste can cause both accumulation of liquid products during fermentation (VFA) with subsequent over-acidifying of bacterial cultures (inhibition of fermentation), as well as generation of too high partial pressure of hydrogen in the headspace. This inhibits further hydrogen formation and decreases specific yield of hydrogen [30,31]. Because the increase of waste concentration above 40% v/v resulted in lowering of the pH to 5.1, it was expected that further increase of waste concentration will decrease the hydrogen yield. Biomass content measurements estimated on the basis of TS and VSS values indicated that in certain cases (run 7 and 4) the biomass amounts decreased during the process. It indicates that microorganisms from digested sludge consume other organic compounds present in the suspension, as well. Literature data [32] show the importance of S 0/X 0 ratio in batch generation of H2. This value influences both catabolism and anabolism. An increase of S 0/X 0 results in lowering of pH values and cell growth depending on the type of microorganisms and substrate applied. Fan et al. [31] established optimal S 0/X 0 ratio between 3 and 4 for maximum yield and reaction rate in the case of dehydrated brewery substrate and grass compost as inoculum. In our studies, the highest value of specific yield was obtained at S 0/X 0 = 2.8 (Table 2, run 1) but the highest rate of reaction and hydrogen content in biogas was obtained in run with S 0/X 0 = 2.2 (Table 4, run 4). The higher is S 0/X0 the higher is the ratio HBu/HAc and in consequence higher yield of hydrogen."
7,Metabolites,"3.3 Metabolites The butyric and acetic acid were found as the main liquid metabolites in fermentation of distillery waste water. Only traces of propionic acid and ethanol were detected after each run. At high concentration of waste in the initial medium (40% v/v) the non-reacted glycerol was found in products, as well (see Table 5 ). The amount of glycerol in undiluted waste usually equals 5 g/l. Glycerol present in the diluted waste (20% v/v) is completely consumed during fermentation. After 18 h of process duration no glycerol was found in final post-reaction liquid. The comparison of data presented in Tables 2 and 5 show that the higher is HBu/HAc in liquid metabolites the higher is specific yield of hydrogen. This relationship was already observed by other groups [32]. Studying transformation of sucrose into ethanol it was proved that there is relationship not only between HBu/HAc ratio but also between loss of the substrate and the hydrogen yield. Changes in HBu/HAc ratio suggest different metabolism pathway. The amount of these acids in final metabolites depends also on the initial pH Our studies confirm (see Table 5, runs 1, 2, 3) that at pH 5.5 concentration of butyric acid is lower than at pH 6.0 what in consequence gives lower yield of hydrogen. The influence of acids (acetic, propionic and butyric) and ethanol on hydrogen production was studied by Wang et al. [33,34]. They proved the inhibitory influence of all tested acids (VFA) on fermentative hydrogen production, the substrate degradation efficiency, hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate. The influence of ethanol concentration was much lower. These studies proved that the higher is the concentration of acetic acid the lower is degradation of sucrose. Moreover these authors observed a characteristic shape of acetate production curve. They found that the loss of acetate causes the increase of VFA's concentration. Similar effects were found in our studies. Kinetic curves presented in Fig. 2 show that acetic acid introduced (1 g/l) into waste causes initial increase of concentration and after 18 h returns to the initial one. At the same time an increase of butyric acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were observed. The precise analysis of composition of the used wastewater was difficult to be performed and only approximate values were available. Therefore, an electron balance on the metabolites can not be performed precisely. However, it is possible to calculate the ratio of electron equivalents recovered as hydrogen and electron equivalents of the loss of initial substrate added on the basis of ΔCOD values and the amount of produced hydrogen [35]. These calculated values are 11% and 12.9% for the wastewater with concentrations 20 and 40 vol. %, respectively. Similar values were obtained by Giordano et al. [35] during fermentation of glucose or mashed potatoes."
8,Conclusions,"Corn distillery wastewater can be the efficient source of organic carbon for biohydrogen production. Significant amounts of acetic and butyric acids are formed as liquid metabolites in hydrogen generation process. The dilution of wastewater is required before the start of fermentation. The efficiency of hydrogen produced during fermentation of distillery wastewater is strongly influenced by waste concentration, amount of inoculum and pH of the process. Appropriately adjusted ratio between inoculum and amount of waste leads toward high rate (0.12 l/l/h) of hydrogen production and quantities comparable (∼1 l H2/l) with other wastes from food industry. The best specific yield of hydrogen production was obtained in system containing 10% v/v of inoculum and 20% v/v of the waste."
