0,Introduction,"Carbonyl compounds have carved a major place in the industrial field as solvents, precursors, pharmaceuticals and as ingredients in fragrances and flavor. A large number of carbonyl compounds available in the global market are produced traditionally from alcohol substrates following chemical oxidation methods. These methods mostly utilize harmful organic solvents, stoichiometric equivalent of toxic metal catalysts, or a large amount of energy along with the production of harmful byproducts and waste streams [1,2]. The research is increasingly focused on the utilization of redox enzymes as renewable biocatalysts for the synthesis of various carbonyl compounds under environmentally benign conditions [3]. The direct conversion of alcohol to the corresponding carbonyl compound is known to be catalyzed primarily by two different redox enzymes, namely, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and alcohol oxidase (AOx). The reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are shown in Scheme 1 . The biocatalytic conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds has been studied largely by using ADH [4]. However, the need to supplement the cofactors (e.g. NADP+, NAD+) for the catalysis causes difficulty in developing economically viable ADH-based process. The reaction catalyzed by AOx (alcohol: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.13) is widely known as irreversible and uses molecular oxygen as electron acceptor that leads to the formation of the product along with hydrogen peroxide. The redox active prosthetic group (flavin or its derivatives) in AOx is firmly bound to the protein; hence AOx-based catalytic process circumvents the need of supplementing the cofactor to the reaction medium for the catalysis. However, the exploitation of AOx as biocatalyst for the conversions is rare, the reasons being attributed to the low availability and inadequate study on this group of redox enzymes. In general, the AOx is a complex enzyme protein consisting of eight subunits as reported mostly from yeast and other fungal sources [5–7]. The enzyme is highly sensitive to ionic strength and temperature [8–10] and hence stabilization of AOx is a prerequisite for its application in biocatalytic process. From economic perspective, enzyme immobilization is typically an important step to initiate the biocatalytic synthetic process and several different immobilization techniques have been explored in the past including covalent attachment to glyoxal, epoxy or glutaraldehyde activated supports, entrapment within porous materials and adsorption onto PEI-coated supports [11–13]. We detected an AOx present in the microsomes of Aspergillus terreus that showed activity with various alcohol substrates [14]. The AOx is multimeric in nature with a total molecular mass more than 250kDa [15]. The microsomal enzyme however, loses significant activity when dissociated from the microsomal membrane. We used here the native microsomal AOx preparation as catalyst and studied the biocatalytic conversion of various alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. The result showed high yield syntheses of many long chain aldehydes including heptanaldehyde (n-heptanal), which is an important starting material for several aroma (perfumery) and flavor chemicals. We employed polyurethane foam as immobilizing support matrix for the microsomal AOx preparation and then utilized the immobilized AOx for the production of n-heptanal from the corresponding alcohol substrate, n-heptanol. A detailed account on the findings is incorporated in this paper."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), phenyl methyl sulfuronic acid (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), cyclooctanone, n-hexanal, n-dodecanal, cholestenone, 2,2′-azino-bis (ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), benzaldehyde and n-heptanal were purchased from Sigma (India). Acetonitrile and chloroform were obtained from Merck, India. Polyurethane foam was obtained from the local market. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without purification."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Isolation of AOx The microsomal AOx was isolated from hydrocarbon degrading A. terreus MTCC 6324 as reported previously [14]. In brief, the fungus was grown in a hydrocarbon rich medium, harvested in the early stationary phase, washed with 50mM Tris–HCl buffer (THB), pH 8.0 and n-hexane to prepare substrate free cell mass. The cells were suspended in THB, pH 8.0 containing EDTA (10mM), PMSF (1mM) and MgCl2 (1mM) and disrupted in a mechanical cell disruptor (Constant Systems, UK) at 30kpsi. The cell homogenate was then subjected to 10,000× g to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 20,000× g for 30min to remove the light mitochondrial fractions. The supernatant so obtained was subjected to ammonium sulphate precipitation at a saturation of 35% (w/v). The precipitated protein was separated at 15,000× g and desalted by dialyzing against the same buffer (500ml×2) containing 0.1mM PMSF. The microsome bound enzyme from the dialyzed protein solution was separated by 115,000× g, resuspended in THB, pH 8.0 buffer. The dialyzed microsomal enzyme protein was used in the present study. 2.2.2 Enzyme assay The AOx activity was measured by HRP-coupled assay method [16] using 2, 2′-azino-bis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-suphonic acid] diammonium salt (ABTS) as the chromogenic agent and heptanol as the substrate. The reaction is a two-electron two-proton system that generates equimolar concentration of H2O2 from the corresponding alcohol substrate. The assay was used to monitor the production of H2O2 at 405nm for ABTS radical at 30°C (ɛ 405 =18,400μM−1 cm−1). One unit of enzyme activity was expressed as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1μM H2O2 min−1 at 30°C. 2.2.3 Preparation of hydrazone derivatives of carbonyl compounds DNPH reagent (0.35mgml−1) was prepared in 1M HCl solution. Stock solutions of the substrates were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide to increase the solubility in aqueous reaction mixture. All the reactions were carried out in THB, pH 7.5. The total reaction volume was maintained at 10ml containing the following components: 9.89ml THB pH 7.5, 10μl (10mM) of the corresponding substrate and 100μl (∼46U) crude AOx proteins. The reaction mixture was gently vortexed and then incubated at 25°C and 150rpm for different time periods. The reaction mixtures were mixed with 5ml DNPH reagent and incubated at 20°C under static conditions in dark for 2h. The hydrazone derivatives so formed were extracted twice with 14ml of ethyl acetate and concentrated by evaporating the solvent using speedvac (≤35°C). The products were dissolved in acetonitrile and then analyzed immediately by LC-ESI/MS and UV–vis spectrophotometer. Several control experiments containing DNPH reagent, AOx protein and both DNPH reagent and AOx protein in the reaction mixtures were also analyzed separately for blank corrections. 2.2.4 Measurement of molar conversion of the carbonyl compounds The conversion yields of the carbonyl compounds were measured based on the molar absorption coefficients of their hydrazone derivatives obtained at UV360nm. Instead of taking a single molar absorption coefficient value to measure all the test compounds, acetaldehyde, n-hexanal, n-dodecanal, cyclooctanone, benzaldehyde, and cholestenone were used as the representative carbonyl compounds for short chain-(C1 C4), medium chain-(C7 C8), and long chain aldehydes or ketones (C10 C16), cyclooctanone, aromatic aldehydes, and cholestenone, respectively, to determine the molar absorption coefficients for estimation of different categories of the carbonyl compounds. A calibration curve for the representative carbonyl hydrazone derivatives in acetonitrile was recorded in the range of 10–50mMml−1. Molar absorption coefficients of the hydrazones were measured based on the calibration graph obtained by plotting absorbance versus concentration with an R 2 >0.99. The concentration and hence, the formation of the carbonyl compounds in the reaction mixture were calculated by computing the absorptions of the derivatives with the respective molar absorption coefficients of the representative hydrazone derivatives. All separation and purification of carbonyl products were performed using Q-Tof LC–MS/MS system (Waters) equipped with UPLC BEH RP 18 column (250mm×4.6mm5μm). The carbonyls were separated by using a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN), water and ammonium acetate solution (1mM) as mobile phase. Constant 50% ACN and 50% water during 0–10min, then changes of 50–90% ACN, 50–0% water and 0–20% ammonium acetate solution in 30min were used. Constant 90% ACN with 20% ammonium acetate in 60min and changes of 15–35% water, 20–0% ammonium acetate solution and constant 50% ACN in 60–65min were used followed by a 5min equilibration time. A constant flow rate of 0.6mlmin−1 was maintained during the entire separation process. All mass were recorded using electro spray ionization in the positive mode using the conditions: injection volume 10μl; nebulizer gas flow (N2), 2lmin−1; capillary voltage, 4kV; temperature of the ESI probe, 100°C; CDL temperature, 350°C; deflection voltages, 55V; detector gain, 1.7V; collision energy, 5eV. For scan measurements, a mass range from 100 to 1000 m/z was chosen. Mass was calculated based on the calibration of the instrument with standard leucine enkaphalin using a lock mass m/z 556.2771. The spectra obtained were processed and analyzed with the MassLynx V4.1 integrated software. 2.2.5 Enzyme immobilization on polyurethane foam Commercially available polyurethane foam matrix was cut into small equal cubes weighing ∼2mg each. The cubes were thoroughly washed in warm deionized water and dried completely by incubating at 50°C for overnight. The foam matrix was immersed in the enzyme solution (8mgml−1) for 1h and then air dried. The unbound protein was removed by washing the foam matrix in 3ml of THB (pH 8.0) under gentle stirring conditions for 30min. The washing step was repeated three times for 30min each and the foam matrix was stored at 4°C until further use. The amount of AOx immobilized was calculated from the difference in protein concentration used initially to dip the matrix and the amount that was leached out during the washing steps. The loading efficiency of the foam was determined in terms of unit AOx immobilized per mg of matrix. A control experiment was done using BSA instead of AOx protein preparation and the protein loading efficiency was determined. All protein estimations were performed following standard Bradford method using BSA as standard [17]. 2.2.6 Immobilized AOx catalysis and product analysis About 16.2U (∼3.6mg) of immobilized AOx protein was added to the final reaction mixture vial containing various concentration of n-heptanol (10–40mM) in THB (pH 8.0) with the final volume being maintained at 10ml and incubated at 30°C and 80rpm. All the reactions were done in triplicates and standard error was calculated. After 24h of the reaction time, the AOx immobilized foam matrices were separated from the reaction mixture and washed with THB, pH 8.0 (3×10ml) to remove the loosely bound substrates and products and finally stored at 4°C for the next cycle of reaction. The reaction mixture containing the carbonyl product was transferred to a separating funnel and extracted thrice (2ml each) with chloroform. The organic phase was collected, dried by passing through activated Na2SO4 and then concentrated by vacuum rotary evaporator (Equitron) at 80°C. The concentrated product was membrane filtered and analyzed by GC (Varian 450) equipped with a CP-Sil 5 CB capillary column. The run parameters for the GC experiment are as follows: carrier gas, N2; flow rate of N2, 1mlmin−1; injection port and detector port temperatures, 220°C and 250°C, respectively; oven temperature: 60–250°C programmed at 10°Cmin−1 rise. The calibration curves for the substrate n-heptanol and the product n-heptanal were plotted in the concentration range of 10–100mMml−1. The concentrations of n-heptanal and the residual n-heptanol were obtained by measuring the peak area obtained for standard n-heptanol and n-heptanal chromatograms. To measure the residual substrate and product in the reaction medium the calibration curves for both n-heptanol and n-heptanal were constructed acquiring the equations y =14,836· X (R 2 =0.995) and y =29,517· X (R 2 =0.991), respectively, where, Y and X are the concentration of the respective compounds and area in the chromatogram, respectively. 2.2.7 Determination of kinetic parameters To determine the Michaelis–Menten constant (K m ) and turnover number (K cat ) of the immobilized enzyme, the activity assay was done at different concentrations (1–10mM) of heptanol at optimum conditions of 30°C and pH 8. K m was calculated using the Lineweaver–Burk plot."
4,Results and discussion,"The activity of AOx in the cells of A. terreus MTCC 6324 for a wide range of alcohol substrates was reported by us [14]. We studied here the molar conversion of various alcohol substrates to their corresponding carbonyl compounds using microsome-bound AOx from A. terreus as shown in Table 1 . The formation of the product aldehydes was measured based on the molar absorption coefficient of the hydrazone derivatives of the carbonyl compounds and the respective products were confirmed by the mass spectrometry. One of the representative mass spectra of hydrazone derivative of the product n-heptanal is shown in Fig. 1 . The yields of the carbonyl compounds were found to be relatively high when long chain primary and secondary alcohols substrates (C7 and above) and cyclohexanol were used as substrates. Unlike most of the AOxs reported so far, the AOx isolated from A. terreus showed poor enzymatic activity towards short chain alcohol (methanol and ethanol) substrates (Table 1). Notably, the enzyme is predominantly induced during the growth of the fungus on long chain alkane substrates [14]. The AOx is catalytically stable against in situ generation of H2O2, since catalase or other H2O2 scavenger was not required to be added to the reaction mixture to maintain the catalytic activity of the enzyme. It is reported that the inhibitory effect of H2O2 formed during AOx catalysis is generally neutralized by supplementing catalase to the reaction mixture, without which the oxidase is rapidly denatured by hydrogen peroxide [18]. We utilized the catalytic property of the AOx for the production of n-heptanal, an industrially important compound, from corresponding n-heptanol using the microsomal enzyme preparation immobilized in to a commercially available polyurethane foam matrix following a simple adsorption technique. The morphological characteristics of the AOx immobilized foam matrix were observed under the optical microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti) (Fig. 2 ). The pieces of foam matrix were cut into thin sections to avoid overlapping images of different layers present in the foam. The immobilization may be inferred from the opacity developed on the surface of the matrix (Fig. 2B) when compared to the control matrix without AOx protein (Fig. 2A). The immobilizing efficiency of the foam matrix (∼2mg) was compared between test sample (AOx protein) and control protein (BSA) using similar concentration (8mgml−1) of the proteins in the solution. The AOx immobilized foam matrix had a protein loading efficiency of 76.6%, while the control BSA had a protein loading efficiency of 6.7%. The high AOx protein loading efficiency has been attributed largely to the lipophilic nature of the enzyme composite consisting of the microsomal membrane assembly. The microsome-bound AOx preparation used in this investigation promotes its strong adhesion by means of large lipoidal aggregation to the porous hydrophobic architecture of matrix. Moreover, the air patches present in the matrix may act as safe hydrophobic regions which probably prevent the enzyme from leaching out to the nearby hydrophilic phase. BSA protein being highly soluble in aqueous phase (maximum solubility of 40mgml−1 and fractionated at 75% ammonium sulphate) was readily leached out from the foam matrix during the washing steps. The enzyme loading was calculated to be ∼2.02Umg−1 of matrix. To further validate the immobilization of functionally active AOx protein on the matrix, biological staining assay was performed for both control (Fig. 2C) and the immobilized matrix using n-heptanal as the substrate (Fig. 2D). It is evident that the control matrix did not give any color formation while AOx protein immobilized matrix generated intense green color owing to the formation of chromogenic agent (ABTS) radicals as a consequence of the AOx catalytic reaction. The activity of the immobilized enzyme in a range of pH buffers (pH 5.0–10.0) was studied and the optimum pH value of 7.0±0.5 (Fig. 3 A) was found. The effect of temperature on the activity of the immobilized enzyme was studied over a temperature range of 25–60°C (Fig. 3B). All enzyme assays were performed using ABTS method as described in methods section. Even though, the optimum temperature for the immobilized AOx protein was found to be 35°C the catalytic reactions were carried out at 30°C in order to increase the operational stability of the enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature for free AOx is 8.1±0.5 and 30°C [14]. However for immobilized enzyme the optimum pH and temperature were 7.0±0.5 and 35°C respectively. Hence there is not much deviation on the pH stability; however the stability of the immobilized AOx significantly increased with increase in temperature. The concentration of n-heptanol substrate used was in the range of 10–40mM in the reaction mixture. A maximum yield of n-heptanal 20.7±1.2% w/w was obtained at a substrate concentration of 10mM. With increase in substrate concentration the yield of n-heptanal was decreased and finally arrived at 1.2±0.1% (w/w) at 40mM n-heptanol. The results indicate the substrate dependent inhibition of the reaction. Normalizing the activity of the free enzyme and the immobilized enzyme, the yields of n-heptanal per unit of enzyme were ∼2% and 1.3%, respectively. The reason for marginally low conversion with the immobilized enzyme is attributed to the relatively poor substrate diffusion to the active site of the AOx molecules in immobilized foam matrix, probably caused by the aggregation of the protein inside the polyurethane foam matrix. The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized enzymes determined by using n-heptanol as substrate (at 30°C and pH 8.0) support the results. The Michaelis–Menten constant (K m ) and the turnover rates (K cat ) of immobilized enzyme were 4.86mM and 14.78s−1 respectively as compared to 0.49mM and 265.58s−1 for the free enzyme as determined earlier [15]. The high K m and low K cat value for the immobilized enzyme is attributed to the low substrate diffusibility to the active centre of the enzyme due to high aggregation of the enzyme on the immobilizing matrix. The operational stability of the immobilized enzyme was determined by repeating the catalytic reactions for several cycles. Each cycle was run for 24h using 10mM n-heptanol. After each cycle of reaction, the immobilized matrix was washed with THB, pH 8.0 and then transferred to the next reaction cycle. The reactions were repeated for at least 10 cycles and after each cycle the conversion yield of n-heptanal was measured. It was found that the AOx immobilized matrix retained more than 60% of its initial activity till fifth cycle and thereafter the activity declined steadily (Fig. 4 ). The storage stability was measured at regular intervals by incubating the immobilized protein matrix at 4°C. The immobilized protein was highly stable and retained almost 80% of its original activity for 72h (Fig. 5 ). The deactivation constant (k d ) of the immobilized enzyme was calculated to be 5.17×10−5 min−1 and the half-life time (t 1/2) of nearly 9days. AOx based production of short chain aldehydes are reported earlier [4,12,19–21], while the production of long chain aldehydes using AOx as a biocatalyst is not adequately known. The production of n-heptanal using AOx as the biocatalyst and other biocatalytic processes has not been reported so far. Heptanal is a well known starting material for various fragrance compounds. Considering the high cumulative yield obtained by repeating the reaction for multiple reaction cycles under environmentally benign conditions, the development of a potential biocatalytic process using the immobilized microsomal AOx for production of this industrially important n-heptanal is envisaged."
5,Conclusion,"The microsome-bound AOx from A. terreus used in this investigation is found as an efficient catalyst for the high yield production of various long chain carbonyl compounds in aqueous and environmentally benign conditions. Using the polyurethane foam immobilized AOx, the production of industrially important n-heptanal was investigated. The immobilization of AOx through physical adsorption on polyurethane foam obviates the need of the additional chemical steps usually involved in the chemical immobilization onto other carriers (polymer, inorganic, etc.). Moreover polyurethane foam is easily and abundantly available at low cost. Although the yield of the product aldehyde was marginally less as compared to the yield obtained by the free microsomal enzyme, the immobilization on the foam matrix provides high operational stability to the AOx as evident from the significant product yield obtained by the immobilized enzyme catalysis even up to the fifth cycle of the reactions. The direct application of the microsome bound enzyme not only provides the stability to the enzyme but also excludes the purification step of the enzyme, thus contributing to the reduction of cost factor involved in the preparation of the enzyme for the process. Hence, the application potential of the microsome-bound AOx immobilized into polyurethane foam matrix for industrial production of n-heptanal is demonstrated through this investigation."
