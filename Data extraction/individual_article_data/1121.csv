0,Introduction,"Energy requirements are increasing every day with the developing world's industry. To meet the growing demand for energy, the use of oil and fossil fuels is increasing at the same time [1–3]. As a result, the world faces a great threat of environmental pollution and global warming with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions [4]. Because of this, the need for renewable energy sources is growing every day [5]. Hydrogen is an important resource to meet energy requirements [6,7]. There are many ways to produce hydrogen, such as biomass reforming [8,9] and water electrolysis [10]. Known as a green energy carrier [11] and produced by water electrolysis, hydrogen [12] is one of the best environmentally friendly and clean fuels [13–15]. Water electrolysis is performed conventionally in an acidic [16,17] and alkaline environment [18,19]. However, a major issue in water electrolysis is the high production costs. One of the most important parameters that increase the efficiency of electrolysis via using more efficient catalysts. Therefore, researchers are working to develop more efficient anode and cathode materials [20,21]. Various catalyst combinations have been performed in the literature such as metals [22,23], binary [24–26] and ternary [24,27] alloys and their oxides [28–30]. Such combinations of catalysts can be applied to the surface of the support material by spraying, rolling or electroplating [24,31]. One of the most used and cheapest components for hydrogen production is nickel [5,27,31–33]. Because the interested advantages of nickel, nickel-based catalysts are frequently used by researchers [34]. One of the noble metals used in hydrogen evaluation reactions is Ruthenium. In order to reduce the hydrogen evolution overpotential, noble metals are usually added in trace amounts [35]. In this study, metallic nickel (Ni) was electrochemically deposited on the graphite (C) rod. Nickel (II) oxide was swept towards the C rod surface with nickel during the metallic nickel was electrochemically deposited on the surface. Metal oxides provide the synergistic effect to metal [36]. Ruthenium was deposited electrochemically on the nickel-nickel oxide combination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry and potentiodynamic polarization techniques have been used to electrochemically examine the catalytic effect of the obtained catalysts in the HER."
1,Experimental method,
2,Material and method,"2.1 Material and method C rods 10 cm in length were used as support material in the experiments. These rods were insulated with polyester, with the exception of the bottom sides of the rods. C rods have an active surface of 0.283 cm2. Prior to each experiment, the C rods were abraded with 1200 grid emery paper and the washed with distilled water, acetone and then distilled water, respectively. The NiO nano powders were synthesized with NiCl2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 97%), K2C2O4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%). 0.5 mmol NiCl2·6H2O dissolved in 20 ml distilled water. Then 0.03 g K2C2O4 and 8 ml ethylene glycol were added to the stirred solution. The mixture was left in a stainless-steel autoclave at 220 °C for 12 h. Afterward, the autoclave was cooled at room temperature. The resulting product was centrifugally precipitated and washed twice with distilled water and absolute alcohol. This precipitation was dried in a vacuum furnace at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, this material was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h [37]. DC power supply (TT T-ECHNI-C YH-303D) was used for the electrochemical deposition procedures via two electrode system. The electrochemical analyses were performed by three electrode technique where Pt sheet (2 cm2 surface area) as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and catalyst loaded C rod as the working electrode. These analyses were carried out using 1.0 M KOH solution as electrolyte. EIS, LSV and potentiodynamic polarization techniques were used to determine the catalytic efficiency for hydrogen production. EIS measurements were obtained with a frequency range of 106 to 0.01 Hz at 10 mV amplitude, and LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 between 0 V and cathodic 0.5 V. The CV technique was used between −1.3 VSHE and 1.4 VSHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The chronoamperometry technique was carried out at cathodic 0.3 VSHE for 41,200 s."
3,Experimental,"The C rods were electrochemically deposited at a current density of 137.8 mA/cm2 in a nickel bath, which the bath composition was given in Table 1 . The electrodeposition times have been applied as 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 s. Nickel deposited catalysts obtained in these processes are called Ni t . Here, t represents the time applied. EIS, LSV, and polarization techniques were used to determine the hydrogen production efficiency of catalysts obtained after nickel deposition. After determining the ideal deposition time, NiO nanoparticles were added in nickel bath and this suspension solution was used to nickel/nickel oxide co-deposition. In this way, suspended NiO was deposited on the surface during the electrochemical nickel deposition with the sweep effect without using any additional adhesive material. To determine the optimum amount of NiO, different quantities (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg NiO) were studied. These catalysts are called as Nit-NiO(Xmg). X indicates the amount of NiO added to the nickel bath. Finally, electrochemical ruthenium deposition at 137.8 mA/cm2 current density was done on the optimum Nit-NiO(Xmg) catalyst. The chemical composition of the ruthenium deposition bath was given in Table 1. Depositions were applied for 5 different periods (5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 s). The obtained cathode material was identified as Nit-NiO(Xmg)@Rut. EIS, LSV, and polarization techniques were used to analyze the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The best catalysts were tested for hydrogen evolution performance using the reverse burette method [32]. The generated hydrogen at the cathode was accumulated in the reverse burette and its volume was measured after 1 h. Experiments were carried out at 20 °C under 736 mmHg pressure in 1.0 M KOH solution and Pt was used as the anode. CV measurements were obtained for the Nit-NiO(Xmg)@Rut catalyst and the occurring redox reactions on the surface were determined. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 650 Field Emission SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) was used for surface characterization and elemental analyses of the catalysts. The powder XRD measurements were performed with a Rigaku diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, 2 kW, automatic divergence slit), 2θ angle between 5 ° and 90 ° ."
4,Results & discussions,"All catalysts were characterized by the LSV technique. Fig. 1 illustrates overpotential - current density curves for catalysts by applying different nickel deposition time on C rod at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 between 0 V and cathodic 0.5 V (vs SHE). LSV analyzes were performed to determine the best hydrogen evolution efficiency of nickel deposited rods, in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig, it was observed that the initial potential of C for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was −0.45 V. The initial potentials of hydrogen evolution for Ni5, Ni10, Ni15, Ni30, Ni60, and Ni120 catalysts were observed at points of −0.18 V, −0.19 V, −0.20 V, −0.24 V, −0.34 V, and −0.38 V, respectively. When the curves compared, it is seen that the highest cathodic current density and the lowest overpotential for HER belong to Ni5. EIS measurement at overvoltage zone gives information about catalyst resistance against hydrogen evolution. Nyquist diagrams for the prepared catalysts at −0.3 VSHE in 1.0 M KOH solution were given in Fig. 2 . Nyquist diagram of base C was given as inset graphic in Fig. 2. All catalysts have one time constant due to the charge transfer resistance. As examined the Nyquist diagrams of the catalysts, it is seen that Ni5 catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance. Metal oxides are known with their synergistic effects in catalysts [32]. For this reason, NiO, which are suspended in solution during electrochemically nickel deposition without using extra adhesive material (Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), etc.), was attached to the C rod surface by sweep effect. NiO nanoparticles were added to the solution in different amounts (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg) and its catalytic effect was investigated by using LSV and EIS techniques. Fig. 3 illustrates overpotential (vs SHE) - current density graphs for catalysts defined as Ni5–NiO(Xmg). When the Fig. is examined it is seen that the initial potentials of hydrogen evolution for Ni5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg), Ni5–NiO(1mg), Ni5–NiO(2mg), and Ni5–NiO(3mg) catalysts were at points of −0.18 V, −0.15 V, −0.28 V, −0.18 V, and −0.23 V, respectively. When the curves are compared at −0.3 VSHE of overvoltage, the highest cathodic current density for the prepared catalysts, 33 mA cm−2, and the lowest overpotential for HER, −0.15 V was obtained for Ni5–NiO(0.5mg). EIS measurements were taken at −0.3 VSHE overvoltage in 1.0 M KOH solution to determine the catalytic activity of catalysts prepared by adding NiO. Nyquist diagrams for the Ni5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg), Ni5–NiO(1mg), Ni5–NiO(2mg), and Ni5–NiO(3mg) catalysts were given in Fig. 4 . Comparing the curves in Fig. 4, it is seen that Ni5–NiO(0.5mg) catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance. Hence, it has higher hydrogen production ability than others. It is known that less amount of metal oxide with metals give the extra catalytic efficiency via synergistic effect. It was seen from the results when the metal oxides amount increased, catalytic efficiency reduces. The optimum amount was detected as 0.5 mg. Ruthenium, a noble metal, was electrochemically deposited on Ni5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg) to increase the efficiency of the catalyst. The metallic ruthenium was deposited at 137.8 mA cm−2 current density for different durations (5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 s). Prepared Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Rut catalysts were analyzed electrochemically by LSV and EIS methods. Fig. 5 illustrates overpotential (vs SHE) - current density graphs for catalysts defined as Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Rut. Examining the Fig, the initial potentials of hydrogen evolution for Ni5–NiO(0.5mg), Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru10, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru15, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30, and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru45 catalysts, were at points of −0.15 V, −0.20 V, −0.17 V, −0.10 V, and −0.20 V, respectively. Comparing the curves at −0.3 VSHE of overvoltage, the highest cathodic current density for the prepared catalysts, 52 mA cm−2, and the lowest overpotential for HER, −0.10 V was obtained for Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30. EIS measurements for the Ru deposited catalysts were also taken at −0.3 VSHE overvoltage to determine the catalytic activity. The Nyquist diagrams of Ni5–NiO(0.5mg), Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru10, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru15, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30, and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru45 catalysts were given in Fig. 6 . It is seen that Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance, which has 1.35 Ω cm−2. To compare the initial potential values of the obtained catalysts for HER, commercial 20% Pt/C electrode, purchased from ERDES Technology and Chemistry company, was used. In Fig. 7 , initial potentials for HER of the Pt/C, and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalysts were given as 33 mV and 80 mV, respectively. It seemed that Pt/C was more effective up to the current density of 50 mA cm−2 from the onset of hydrogen evolution. When the current density passed to 50 mA cm−2, it appeared that the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was more effective than Pt/C for HER. CV measurement for Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was given in Fig. 8 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 between −1.3 VSHE and 1.4 VSHE in 1.0 M KOH. When Fig. 8 is examined, the peak of A1 at −0.7 V and A2 peak at 0.3 V in the anodic direction and C1 peak is reverse of A2 at 0.3 V in cathodic direction are observed. The peaks comment as Ni/Ni+2, Ni+2/Ni+3 and Ni+3/Ni+2 convertion, respectively [31,38]. When the CV graph are examined, no reduction or oxidation peaks for ruthenium are seen. The reason of this, the species formed in the range of −0.3 VSHE and 1.4 VSHE in an alkaline medium dissolve in water according to Pourbaix diagrams [39]. However, in the LSV graph, metallic ruthenium gave a catalytic efficiency for hydrogen evolution (in the range of 0 to −0.5 VSHE). The potentiodynamic polarization technique for Ni5, Ni5–NiO(0.5mg), Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalysts were applied from 0 mV to 300 mV overpotentials at 10 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. The obtained data are plotted in Fig. 9 . To compare the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst, current densities at some overpotentials, which were 50, 100 and, 200 mV (-η50, -η100, and -η200) were determined from potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The current density at given overpotentials and Tafel constant (b), and i0 were given in Table 2 . When the obtained current densities at constant overvoltages are examined, it is seen that Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst is the most catalytically active catalyst compare than others. However, when the values of Tafel constant, b, in Fig. 9 were analyzed, the b values were higher than 120 mV dec−1. It is understood that the hydrogen adsorption mechanism takes place with Volmer-Hevrosky mechanism and the rate determining step of the reaction is Volmer [40]. Volmer, Hevrosky and Tafel mechanism were given as follows, (1) H 2 O + M + e − ⇌ M H a d s + O H − ( V o l m e r ) (2) H 2 O + M H a d s + e − ⇌ H 2 + M + O H − ( H e y r o v s k y ) (3) M H a d s + M H a d s ⇌ H 2 + 2 M T a f e l Hydrogen evolution experiments were carried out using the obtained catalysts Pt/C, base C, Ni5, Ni5–NiO, and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 in 1.0 M KOH solution applied at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 for 1 h and the results were given Table 3 . Hydrogen volumes obtained with the reverse burette were calculated as follows. (4) P T o t a l = P H 2 O + P H 2 (5) P H 2 = P T o t a l − P H 2 O (6) y H 2 = P T o t a l − P H 2 O P T o t a l (7) V H 2 = V T o t a l x y H 2 When the results are compared, it was seen that the Ni5–NiO@Ru30 catalyst was a more efficient catalyst for HER. Comparing the hydrogen evolution points in Fig. 7, the Pt/C catalyst would have been expected to be more effective for hydrogen production, but it was seen that the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was more effective at 200 mA cm−2 current density, which is confirmed by the hydrogen production amount. The chronoamperometry technique was applied to determine the stability of the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst in 1.0 M KOH for 11.4 h at 0.3 VSHE overpotential. As shown in Fig. 10 , the initial current density is about 4.6 mA cm−2 and decreases to 4.0 mA cm−2 within 10 Ks. After 10 ks, a plateau formed for 41,200 s. Fig. 10 shows that the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30catalyst has a high stability in alkaline medium. XRD measurements were performed on PANalytical EMPYREAN. XRD pattern of Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was given Fig. 11 . The obtained peaks were determined using reference pdf cards (JCPDF No.98-003-1170 (C), JCPDF No. 98-019-1753 (Ni) and JCPDF No. 98-005-3810 (Ru). When the XRD pattern of the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was examined, it was observed two peaks of C at 26.2 and 77.2, a peak of nickel at 53.6 and three peaks of ruthenium at 42.1, 44.2, and 82.7. The appearance of C peaks indicates that the surface is not completely covered, and a porous structure is formed on the surface. The peak of nickel oxide is not seen in the XRD results, because the nickel oxide is under the metallic nickel coating due to the sweep effect. Fig. 12 shows the SEM pictograms of the Base C (a), Ni5 (b), Ni5–NiO(0.5mg) (c), and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 (d) catalysts at 10.0 kx magnification, respectively. When the SEM pictogram of C (Fig. 12a) is examined, it appears as layers of leaves stacked on top of each other. The SEM pictogram of the Ni5 catalystis given in Fig. 12b. A smooth cloudy structure is seen on the surface. Fig. 12c shows the nickel oxide structure on the surface by the sweep effect during metallic nickel deposition. White and sharp-edged structures on the surface indicate oxidized structures. Finally, Fig. 12d illustrated the SEM pictogram of the catalyst obtained after ruthenium deposition. The differences between Ni5–NiO(0.5mg) and Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalysts surfaces were given in Fig. 12e and f at 50 kx magnification, respectively. At this magnification, the Nickel oxide structure (Fig. 12e) and ruthenium (Fig. 12f) are clearly visible. The surface homogeneity and surface composition of the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30 catalyst was characterized by the SEM-EDX and elemental mapping techniques and results were given in Fig. 13 . Elementary mapping results of C (a), O (b), Ru (c), and Ni (d) were given in Fig. 13a, b, Fig. 13c and d, respectively. Fig. 13e illustrates that nickel and nickel oxide are homogeneously dispersed on the surface and trace amount of Ruthenium was deposited on the surface."
5,Conclusions,"Different electrochemical deposition times was applied on the C rod to develop catalytic effect for HER. The obtained Ni t catalysts were analyzed by LSV and EIS methods. The optimum deposition time was chosen as 5 s and denoted Ni 5 . Due to the catalytic effects of metal oxides, Nickel (II) oxide was attached to the surface by sweep effect simultaneously during the nickel deposition. Different amounts of Nickel (II) oxide nano powder were added into the nickel bath and the solution was obtained in the form of suspension. The catalytic activities of the obtained Ni t -NiO (xmg) catalysts for HER were analyzed using LSV and EIS techniques. The optimum amount of NiO was found to be 0.5 mg and expressed as Ni 5 –NiO (0.5mg) . Ruthenium was deposited electrochemically on that catalyst by applying different depositing times. The most effective depositing time was determined as 30 s by using LSV and EIS techniques. The catalyst was denoted as Ni 5 –NiO (0.5mg) @Ru 30 . CV measurement was taken to clarify the redox reactions on the catalyst surface. The conversion peaks of Ni/Ni+2, Ni+2/Ni+3 and Ni+3/Ni+2 were detected. When the potentiodynamic analysis is examined, it is understood that the hydrogen adsorption mechanism takes place with Volmer-Hevrosky and the rate determining step is Volmer. In the overvoltage region, the Ni 5 –NiO (0.5mg) Ru 30 catalyst was found to be more effective than the Pt/C catalyst when compared to the amounts of hydrogen. Stability test has been shown that the Ni5–NiO(0.5mg)@Ru30catalyst has a high stability in alkaline medium. SEM-EDX and XRD techniques to demonstrate surface characterization. Characterization showed that Nickel, Nickel (II) Oxide are homogeneously dispersed on the surface and trace amount of Ruthenium was deposited on the surface."
