0,Introduction,"Biomass is an abundant and important sustainable resource that can be converted into a variety of value-added chemicals and fuels [1,2]. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), a degradation product of lignocellulose, is regarded as one of the most promising feedstocks for biomass-based platforms [3–5]. The 5-HMF derivative 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) has been extensively investigated, and is considered to be an ideal liquid fuel due to its good physical and chemical properties [6,7]. The selective catalytic reduction of 5-HMF to DMF has been widely studied, and catalytic systems to achieve this transformation are classified into two categories depending on whether molecular H2 was used as the hydrogen donor. A number of efficient noble-metal catalysts, mainly based on Ru [8–10], Pd [11–13], and Pt [14–17], have been employed for the hydrogenation of 5-HMF using H2 as a hydrogen source. Non-noble-metal catalysts, such as Ni/Co3O4 [18], Ni-W2C/AC [19], Cu-Zn [20], and Cu-Co/C [21], have also been developed. Although many of the developed noble and non-noble catalysts exhibited good performance for the hydrogenation of 5-HMF, the usage of high pressure H2 in these catalytic processes inevitably introduces issues, such as those associated with H2 storage, transportation, and safety [22]. For this reason, the use of formic acid and alcohols as hydrogen donors instead of high pressure H2 has attracted increased attention [23]. Formic acid has been successfully employed as a hydrogen donor for in situ hydrogenation reactions using Pd/C [24], Ru/C [25], and Ni-Co/C [26] catalysts. However, the use of acids has a negative impact on the environment, and requires the usage of acid- and corrosion-resistant reaction equipment, which greatly limits its applications. The use of alcohols as hydrogen donors in the hydrogenation of 5-HMF has also been studied, and secondary alcohols such as 2-propanol were found to exhibit better performance than primary alcohols such as methanol and ethanol [27–29]. To minimize the cost of the hydrogen donor, the use of methanol as the hydrogen donor has attracted extensive attention [30]. Hansen et al. [31] employed a Cu-doped porous metal oxide catalyst with methanol as the solvent and hydrogen donor, and achieved a 48% DMF yield at 260 °C for 3 h. Chen and co-workers [32] used Cu3Al catalysts, which achieved good performance in the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF at 240 °C after 1.5 h. Previous reports indicated that catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts using Al2O3, CeO2, ZnO, and ZrO2 for the production of H2 from methanol was obviously influenced by the different carriers [33–37]. However, the effect of different carriers on the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF using methanol as the hydrogen donor still remains to be systematically studied. In this work, Cu-based catalysts were prepared on Al2O3, ZnO, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, and were evaluated for the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF with methanol, as shown in Scheme 1 . Subsequently, the H2 production from methanol and the conversion of the intermediate 5-methylfuraldehyde (5-MF) were studied to compare the influence of the different carriers. X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) were utilized to characterize the structure and properties of the catalysts. The effects of the substrate concentration, catalyst loading, and reaction temperature and time on the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF were systematically investigated, and the reusability of the catalysts was also studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 5-HMF (99%) was purchased from Beijing J&K Scientific Ltd. DMF (99%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. 5-Methyl-2-furanmethanol (MFA, 97%) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Acros Organics. 5-Methylfuraldehyde (5-MF, 98.0%), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O, and Ce(NO3)2·6H2O were all purchased from Aladdin Reagent Limited Company. Methanol, Na2CO3, and NaOH were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Catalytic activity tests were performed in a microbatch reactor (14 mL). Briefly, a certain amount of 5-HMF, catalyst, and methanol were added to the reactor, and the sealed reactor was then heated to the desired temperature in a heating furnace. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature using cold water, and the solid catalyst was recovered by filtering the mixture several times. The hydrogen production experiments were performed in an 8 mL stainless steel autoclave. Briefly, 3.5 mL methanol and 15 mg catalyst were added to the reactor, and the sealed reactor was then pressurized with N2 three times and then charged with N2 at atmospheric pressure. The final pressure at room temperature in the reactor was recorded after the reaction, and the gaseous products were collected for GC analysis."
4,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of the catalysts All the catalyst precursors were prepared by the co-precipitation method. Typically, Cu/Al2O3 was prepared as follows: Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water, and a 0.4 mol/L Na2CO3 solution was used as the precipitant. The resulting metal salt solution and Na2CO3 were added dropwise to a 1 L round-bottom flask containing 30 mL deionized water at 65 °C and a pH value of 6.5 under vigorous stirring. After precipitation, the mixture was stirred for 3 h and aged for 3 h, then washed and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The as-prepared precursor was calcined at 450 °C for 3 h to achieve the corresponding calcined sample. Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2 were prepared using the same method as Cu/Al2O3 by substituting Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O, and Ce(NO3)2·6H2O as the metal precursors. Prior to the reaction, the as-synthesized catalysts were reduced in a tube furnace under 5 vol.% H2 balanced with Ar at 350 °C for 1 h."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of the reduced Cu-based samples were recorded using a Shimadzu diffractomer using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The Scherrer equation at a 2θ value of 43.3° was applied to calculate the Cu crystallite size. The thermogravimetric characteristics of the used catalysts were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a TAQ500 instrument. The samples were heated to 650 °C at 10 °C min−1 under a flow of air of 50 cm3 min−1. The Cu contents of all catalysts were obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 730 device). Prior to the analysis, the catalysts were dissolved in a mixture of HCl and HNO3. ICP results are shown in Table 1 . The actual Cu loadings of fresh Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2 were 18.5, 21.3, 24.5, and 19.7%, respectively, which are very close to the theoretical values of 20%. The leaching of Cu after reaction was also analyzed by ICP-OES. The H2-TPR experiments were carried out in a FineSorb-3010 equipped with a TCD detector. The gas mixture was 10 vol.% hydrogen balanced with argon at a flow rate of 15 cm3 min−1; the temperature was increased from 60 °C to 800 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1. The NH3-TPD experiments were also carried out using the FineSorb-3010 to evaluate the strength of the acid sites for the various Cu-based catalysts. The gas mixture was 5 vol.% NH3 in N2 at a flow rate of 20 cm3 min−1, and the temperature was increased from 50 °C to 700 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET) were collected using a Micromeritics 3Flex adsorption instrument. Prior to the measurements, each sample was degassed under N2 at 300 °C for 12 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used for the calculation of the specific surface areas and the results were shown in Table 1."
6,Analysis methods,"2.5 Analysis methods An Agilent 5977 A-7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm HP-5 column was used for the qualitative analysis of DMF. The carrier gas was nitrogen with a flow rate of 11.383 mL/min, and the liquid volume was 1 μL with a split ratio of 10:1. The temperature of the injector and detector were both 300 °C. 5-HMF, 5-MF, and MFA were quantified using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a 0.32 mm × 25 m Agilent CP-FFAP column; the liquid volume was 1 μL with a split ratio of 7:1 and the temperature of the injector and detector were both 280 °C A Shimadzu GC-2018 gas chromatograph with an Agilent PLOT 5 A molecular-sieve-filled column was used to analyze the gaseous products. The oven temperature was 60 °C, the liquid volume was 1 mL with a split ratio of 1, and the temperature of the TCD and FID detector were 100 °C and 180 °C, respectively. Identification of the products was performed with an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography/5977 A mass spectrometry instrument (GC/MS), and then further confirmed by matching the gas chromatograph retention times against known standards. The conversion and yield of the product were determined using the external standard method. Each result was confirmed by three repeated experiments, and the molar conversion of the reactant and the molar yield of the product were calculated as follows: Conversion (%) = (moles of converted substrate)/(moles of substrate added)×100% Yield (%) = (moles of product produced)/(moles of substrate added)×100%"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of all the fresh and used Cu-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 43.3° (111), 50.4° (200), and 74.1° (220) were attributed to metallic Cu (JCPDS 04-0836), and were clearly observed for all the catalysts. Additionally, diffraction peaks corresponding to Al2O3 (JCPDS 49-0134), ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), ZrO2 (JCPDS 17-0923), and CeO2 (JCPDS 43-1002) were observed in the patterns of Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2, respectively. The XRD results indicated that all the reduced catalysts were composed of a mixture of Cu metal and the corresponding carrier. No obvious differences in the diffraction peaks of the used catalysts were observed, indicating the stability of the crystalline phase after the reaction. The Cu crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation, and the results are summarized in Table S1. The Cu crystallite sizes of the fresh Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2 catalysts were 14.8 nm, 15.9 nm, 25.9 nm, and 21.9 nm respectively. The Cu crystallite sizes of Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO were much smaller than that those of Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2. In light of the superior catalytic activity of the Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO catalysts shown in Fig. 3a, a smaller Cu crystallite size seems to be favorable for the in situ hydrogenation reaction. The Cu crystallite sizes of Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2 did not increase after the reaction, as shown in Table S1. H2-TPR analysis of the calcined Cu-based catalysts was performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . For the calcined Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, and Cu/CeO2 samples, only one H2 consumption peak was observed at approximately 235 °C, which was ascribed to the reduction of well-dispersed CuO. The Cu/ZrO2 sample showed a broad H2 consumption band between 200 °C–320 °C, indicating the existence of strong interactions between Cu and ZrO2 [38]. All the calcined catalysts were completely reduced at 350 °C, which was chosen as the reduction temperature. The NH3-TPD profiles shown in Figure S1 were used to evaluate the acid strength and amount of acid generated by the various Cu-based catalysts. The desorption peaks of the samples were located between 100 °C and 700 °C; these desorption peaks were attributed to weak, medium, and strong acidity sites [39]. The strength and distribution of the acid sites of the various Cu-based catalysts were calculated using the peak areas of the desorption of NH3 at different temperatures, as shown in Table 1. The data obtained from the Gaussian fitting method further demonstrated that the Al2O3 support greatly increased the acidity of the catalyst, which may be another factor contributing to its efficient reactivity."
9,Catalytic activity of the different catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic activity of the different catalysts As shown in Fig. 3a, the performance of Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2 in the in-situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF was evaluated at 240 °C for 6 h using methanol as the hydrogen donor. Nearly 100% conversion of 5-HMF was achieved using all four catalysts; however, their selectivity towards DMF differed. Cu/Al2O3 showed a 73.9% yield of DMF, which was much higher than the 59.7% (Cu/ZnO), 24.9% (Cu/ZrO2), and 23.6% (Cu/CeO2) yields achieved by the other catalysts under the same experimental conditions. 5-HMF contains an aldehyde group (−CHO) and an alcoholic hydroxyl group (−CH2OH) in the furan ring, both of which could be converted to a methyl group (−CH3) by a hydrogenolysis reaction. In order to clarify the effect of the supports (Al2O3, ZnO, ZrO2, and CeO2) on the hydrogenation of −CHO and −CH2OH, 5-MF was used as a substrate for the in-situ hydrogenation process. As shown in Fig. 3b, 5-MF was completely transformed to give a 72.8% yield of DMF over Cu/Al2O3, and only a very small amount of the intermediate MFA was detected. The nearly 100% conversion of 5-MF over the four catalysts indicated that −CHO can be completely converted to −CH2OH at 240 °C. However, a significant amount of MFA was produced over Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2, resulting in their lower DMF yields. These results indicated that Cu/Al2O3 showed higher activity than the other studied catalysts for the conversion of −CH2OH to −CH3 under the same experimental conditions. The higher −CH2OH hydrogenolysis activity of Cu/Al2O3 should be ascribed to its stronger acidity (Table 1), which is in good agreement with previous reports in the literature [19,32,40]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the total yields of MFA and DMF were 73.1%, 51.3%, 51.1%, and 37.1%. The highest selectivity for the preparation of DMF from 5-MF was observed over Cu/Al2O3; similar results were also seen for the conversion of 5-HMF (Fig. 3a). These results indicated that Cu/Al2O3 had the best catalytic activity for the production of DMF, followed by Cu/ZnO. The smaller Cu particle size and stronger acidity of Cu/Al2O3, as determined from the XRD and NH3-TPD results, might be the main reasons for the better catalytic activity of Cu/Al2O3. The relatively low mass balance (<80%) in this reaction system was mainly ascribed to the formation of the condensation compounds in Figure S2."
10,In situ H2 production and its effect on the hydrogenation of 5-HMF,"3.3 In situ H2 production and its effect on the hydrogenation of 5-HMF In this reaction system, H2 was produced in situ by the conversion of methanol. Therefore, the relationship between the catalytic activity of Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2, and Cu/CeO2 and the in situ H2 production from methanol was investigated. The quantitative results of the analysis of the gaseous products obtained using methanol as the reactant at 240 °C for 6 h are summarized in Table S2. The pressure of the reactor after cooling to room temperature was recorded, and pressures of approximately 6.0 MPa and 3.8 MPa were detected for Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZrO2, respectively, which were much higher than the 1.0 MPa observed for Cu/ZnO and Cu/CeO2. The main gaseous product collected was H2, along with small amounts of CO and CH4. As shown in Table S2, 10.73 mmol and 6.79 mmol H2 were generated over Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZrO2, respectively. However, only 1.93 mmol and 1.84 mmol H2 were obtained over Cu/ZnO and Cu/CeO2, respectively. The greater amount of H2 generated by Cu/Al2O3 might be one of the reasons for its higher reactivity, as shown in Fig. 3a. However, Cu/ZnO exhibited a higher yield of DMF than Cu/ZrO2, even though it produced less in situ H2, suggesting Cu/ZnO could more effectively utilize the in situ generated H2 than Cu/ZrO2. Figure S3 also suggested Cu/ZnO exhibited higher 5-HMF hydrogenation activity compared to Cu/ZrO2 with H2 as the hydrogen donor. To further confirm the above results, the conversion of methanol and 5-HMF over Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2 at 220 °C was studied. As shown in Fig. 4a , the amount of H2 produced over Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZrO2 decreased significantly at 220 °C, but was still slightly higher than over Cu/ZnO and Cu/CeO2. The in-situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF was further investigated using different Cu-based catalysts at 220 °C for 6 h, and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. Compared to the results at 240 °C shown in Fig. 3a, the DMF yield decreased to some extent for all the catalysts at 220 °C. As higher H2 content has a positive effect on the in-situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF, the decreased H2 content in the system should be responsible for the decreased DMF yields. The DMF yields using Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO were much higher than those of Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2, as shown in Fig. 4b, which was consistent with the above discussion."
11,Optimization of the reaction conditions over Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO,"3.4 Optimization of the reaction conditions over Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO The effect of different reaction conditions on the Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO catalysts was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, the effects of reactant loading, catalyst loading, and reaction temperature and time on the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF over Cu/Al2O3 were studied at 240 °C for 4 h. Fig. 5a shows the conversion of 5-HMF and the yield of DMF with different 5-HMF loadings. The yield of DMF increased as the loading was increased from 60 mg to 100 mg, and then slightly decreased with further increases in the catalyst loading. Therefore, a 5-HMF loading of 100 mg was chosen for the subsequent optimization experiments. Catalyst loadings ranging from 15 mg to 40 mg were investigated at 240 °C for 4 h over 100 mg 5-HMF, and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. The yield of DMF increased as the catalyst loading increased from 15 to 30 mg, and then remained almost constant with further increases in catalyst loading. The results indicated that a catalyst loading of 30 mg was sufficient for the conversion of 100 mg 5-HMF. The effect of the reaction time on the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF at 240 °C with 100 mg 5-HMF and 30 mg Cu/Al2O3 was studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion of 5-HMF and the yield of DMF both increased from 0.5 h to 2 h. With further increases in the reaction time, the conversion of 5-HMF remained constant, and the yield of DMF increased gradually to reach a maximum of 73.9% at 6 h. Fig. 7 summarizes the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF for 6 h using 100 mg 5-HMF and 30 mg Cu/Al2O3 at temperatures from 220 °C to 260 °C. The complete conversion of 5-HMF could be achieved even at 220 °C, and the yield of DMF increased when reaction temperature was increased from 220 °C to 240 °C. However, the yield of DMF remained stable as the reaction temperature was increased further. Therefore, a reactant loading of 100 mg, a catalyst loading of 30 mg, a reaction temperature of 240 °C, a reaction time of 6 h, and a methanol loading of 7 mL were determined to be optimized reaction conditions for Cu/Al2O3. Although the in situ H2 production activity of Cu/ZnO was not high, this system could effectively utilize the in situ-produced H2. Therefore, the effect of the reaction temperature and time on the conversion of 5-HMF over Cu/ZnO was also investigated, and the results are shown in Table 2 . Near-complete conversion of 5-HMF over Cu/ZnO could be achieved even at 220 °C. The yield of DMF increased rapidly from 26% to 70.8% as the reaction temperature was increased from 220 °C to 260 °C. By extending the reaction time, a 76.5% DMF yield could be achieved at 240 °C after 10 h over Cu/ZnO."
12,Catalytic recyclability,"3.5 Catalytic recyclability Recycling experiments were carried out for the four Cu-based catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . The catalysts were washed with methanol several times, dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven, and then used for the next reaction. Unfortunately, the yields of DMF over Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO, and Cu/CeO2 decreased remarkably to 0, 3.9%, and 3.0% from 73.9%, 59.7%, and 23.4%. However, the yield of DMF over Cu/ZrO2 after use indicated that it retained almost the same catalytic activity as the fresh Cu/ZrO2. These results showed that Cu/ZrO2 had the best stability in the in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF. The TGA and ICP-OES results was employed for explaining the decrease of DMF yield over used catalysts. From the TGA results in Figure S4, the increase in weight from 100 °C to 400 °C on Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/ZnO was due to the oxidation of Cu. If 20 wt% Cu was completely oxidized to CuO, the increased weight should be around 4%. This indicated that almost no carbon deposition could be found over Cu/ZrO2, and carbon deposition was also negligible over Cu/ZnO. For Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/CeO2 in Figure S4, the peaks of carbon deposition and oxidation of Cu overlapped, and carbon deposition was found about 15% and 8% over Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/CeO2 respectively. Additionally, the leaching amount of Cu was less than 5% over Cu/Al2O3, Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/CeO2 in Table S1. However, the leaching amount of 9.8% was found over Cu/ZnO. Combined with TGA and ICP-OES results, the decrease of DMF yield over used Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/CeO2 was mainly ascribed to the formation of carbon deposition. For Cu/ZnO, the Cu leaching was the main reason. The relatively stable activity over Cu/ZrO2 should be attributed to the negligible carbon deposition and a small amount of Cu leaching."
13,Conclusion,"The in situ hydrogenation of 5-HMF to DMF over different Cu-based catalysts using methanol as the hydrogen donor was studied. The different carriers had a significant influence on the hydrogen production from methanol, with the amount of hydrogen produced following the order: Al2O3 > ZrO2 > ZnO > CeO2. The yield of DMF for the different Cu-based catalysts followed the order: Al2O3 > ZnO > ZrO2 ≈ CeO2. Based on the XRD, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD results, the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity, which can be attributed to its having the highest H2 production activity from methanol, the smallest Cu crystallite size, and the strongest acidity. Additionally, Cu/ZnO can utilize the produced H2 effectively, and Cu/ZrO2 showed good reuse performance. About 75% yield of DMF can be achieved by the conversion of 5-HMF using methanol as the hydrogen donor over Cu/ Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO under the optimized reaction conditions."
