0,Introduction,"Fusel oil is a by-product generated in bioethanol plants during the biomass fermentation and distillation steps. Generally, it is composed of higher alcohols of more than three carbon atoms (e.g., isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, and butanol), as well as other compounds, such as water, aldehydes, and esters (Ceron et al., 2018; Dias et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2013; Nemestothy et al., 2008). Fusel alcohols can be used as substrates to produce compounds of industrial interest, such as plasticizers and flavoring agents. Moreover, fusel oil has been widely applied as reactant in esterification reactions to produce aroma compounds, such as isoamyl butyrate (Anschau et al., 2011; Gamayurova et al., 2017; Welsh et al., 1990), isoamyl laurate (Boas et al., 2018; De Castro et al., 1999), and isoamyl acetate (Bi et al., 2009; Dias et al., 2018a, 2020; Guvenc et al., 2007; Kirdi et al., 2017). Among these components, isoamyl acetate has gained attention as a compound of high commercial value for food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries due to its intense fruity flavor (banana flavor), with a yearly production of 74,000 kg (Guvenc et al., 2003; Quilter et al., 2003). Lipases (glycerol ester hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) belong to the hydrolase group and can produce acids and alcohols through the catalytic hydrolysis of glycerol esters and long-chain fatty esters. Some recent reviews have successfully shown the applicability of lipases in pressurized fluids, encouraging their use in esterification reactions under pressurized systems (Brunner, 2005; Dias et al., 2018b; Knez, 2009). The use of supercritical fluids (SCFs) in biocatalytic reactions presents several advantages, such as improved mass transfer properties, easier product separation in downstream processes, and higher purity of the products. Besides, the high enzyme specificity to the substrates can be explained due to the stereo- and regioselectivity of the catalysts (Romero et al., 2005). Among the SCFs applied in industrial processes, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is the most commonly used solvent due to its superior properties such as non-toxicity, non-flammability, inertness, low-cost, full recovery and moderate critical properties (Pc = 7.38 MPa and Tc = 31.05 °C). The low energy cost for pressurization and mild temperatures that do not denature the enzymes make reactions in SC-CO2 feasible (Raventos et al., 2002; Reverchon and De Marco, 2006). Moreover, the high diffusivity and low viscosity of SC-CO2 can improve the mass transport properties in biocatalytic reactions, increasing the reaction conversions. Batch stirred-tank reactors (BSTRs) are widely employed for biocatalytic processes in SCFs. However, reactions in batch mode have low productivity due to their size limitations requiring reactors with larger volume and thus higher operational costs (Henkel, 2000). Besides, in batch mode, the enzyme activity can decrease because of the break of the catalysts due to the mechanical shear stress and the need for a depressurization step at the end of the process (dos Santos et al., 2017). Packed-bed reactors (PBRs) appear as an alternative for the production of aroma esters in SCFs due to the higher enzyme stability, the possibility of enzyme reuse which reduces the overall production costs, continuous removal of inhibitory compounds, and the independent adjustment of the reactional parameters to enhance the fluid properties (Escandell et al., 2015; Goddard et al., 2000). Furthermore, the lower substrate to enzyme ratio leads to higher enzymatic efficiency, and ease of automation and control can also generate a product with higher purity (Salvi et al., 2018). Aiming to use experimental data from a small to an industrial scale of the PBR, it is required to develop a robust mathematical model based on the law of conservation of mass. The reliability of the model can be validated with the experimental data of the small scale. Then, the model can be employed to a conceptual design of an industrial scale with the desirable performance in terms of isoamyl acetate production from fusel oil. This model also has the advantage of a significant decrease in the number of required experiments to evaluate the impacts of the reactor's parameters such as temperature, pressure, solvent flow rate, reactor's length and diameter, bed porosity, among others. The first required step toward modeling a reactor is the determination of the reaction kinetics. Recently, our previous work for a batch reactor has shown that one can well demonstrate the dynamic experimental data by considering an elementary reaction rate for both forward and reverse reactions (Dias et al., 2020). Thus, the same reaction rate can be used for the PBR of the current study after updating its constants. Although literature reports the use of fusel oil as a reactant to produce aroma esters in continuous mode (Boas et al., 2018; Ceron et al., 2018; Kirdi et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2012), there is a lack of studies dealing with the use of SC-CO2 as a solvent in such reaction. Therefore, this work focused on the continuous production of isoamyl acetate esters from fusel oil through reactions under SC-CO2 and immobilized lipase (Novozym 435) as the catalyst. Moreover, mathematical modeling was performed to understand better the mass transfer mechanisms of the enzymatic reactions in the packed bed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Fusel oil was acquired from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). The standards of all alcohols (isoamyl alcohol (≥99%), isobutanol (≥99%), propanol (99.7%), pentanol (≥99%) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), methanol (99.9%) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) and ethanol (99.9%) (Decon Labs, King of Prussia, USA)) were chromatographic grade. Novozym 435 was purchased from Strem Chemicals, Inc. (Newburyport, USA). The enzyme was expressed in Candida antarctica B (CALB) and immobilized on a hydrophobic carrier (acrylic resin) from poly-(methyl methacrylate) — Lewatit VP OC 1600. Other chemicals, such as acetic anhydride (99.7%) and n-hexane (99.9%) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) were analytical grade. Carbon dioxide (99.9%), hydrogen (99.9%), and helium (99.9%) were acquired from Matheson (Lincoln, USA)."
3,Fusel oil characterization,"2.2 Fusel oil characterization Fusel oil samples were characterized in our previous study (Dias et al., 2020) according to their main alcohols, initial water content, and density. For the main alcohols, the calibration curves of seven external standards were plotted. Gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) (HP 6890, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, USA) equipped with a capillary column (Agilent HP-INNOWAX, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Folsom, USA) was used for the alcohol analysis, following the methodology of Ferreira et al. (2013), with some modifications. Next, samples were filtered (Chormafil Xtra PA-20/25, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), diluted (50 mg/mL) using n-hexane, and injected (1 μL) into the GC-FID. The injection and detection temperatures were fixed at 200 °C. The equipment conditions were set as follows: (i) 40 °C for 4 min; (ii) from 40 to 60 °C at 1 °C/min; (iii) 60 °C for 1 min; (iv) from 60 to 83 °C at 5 °C/min; (v) 83 °C for 1 min; (vi) from 83 to 88 °C at 0.5 °C/min; (vii) 88 °C for 1 min; and viii) from 88 to 200 °C at 15 °C/min. Hydrogen was applied as ignition gas and helium as carrier gas. The composition of fusel oil was expressed as mean mass fraction (mg of component per mg of fusel oil, % (w/w)) and the results showed that isoamyl alcohol was the main identified alcohol 74.0 ± 0.2% (w/w), followed by isobutanol (9.0 ± 0.0% (w/w)), butanol (4.2 ± 0.0% (w/w)), propanol (3.7 ± 0.0% (w/w)), and ethanol (2.0 ± 0.0% (w/w)). Peaks of methanol and pentanol were not identified in the fusel oil chromatograms. Other possible components in fusel oil samples, which were not quantified in this study, are water, aldehydes and esters. These components affect the reaction conversion yields, since they can act as competitors of the active site of the biocatalysts, limiting the reactants (fusel alcohols), which work as acyl receivers. They may also reduce the solubility of the mixture in SC-CO2 at lower temperatures. Moreover, the market value of fusel oil is directly related to its higher alcohols amount, especially isoamyl alcohol. Karl Fischer titrator (Method ASTM E203-16) was used to measure the initial moisture content in fusel oil, obtaining a value of 0.1 ± 0.0% (w/w). The density was calculated through a digital density meter (Anton Paar DMA 4500, Graz, Austria) being found to be 0.8 ± 0.0 g/cm³."
4,Lipase characterization,"2.3 Lipase characterization Novozym 435 was characterized according to the moisture content, bulk ( ρ b ) and real ( ρ r ) densities, bed porosity ( ε b ) and mean particle diameter. A gravimetric method (105 °C for 24 h) was applied to determine the enzyme water amount, using a drying oven (Model ED 115, BINDER GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). It is crucial to know the water content of enzymes, since an optimum water level is necessary to maintain the enzyme conformation and functionality. When higher water amounts are added to the reaction medium, the enzyme can be completely hydrated with water layers, reducing the enzyme stability and activity (Rezaei et al., 2007). Moreover, the solvent polarity and the solubility of the substrates (e.g., fusel oil + acetic anhydride) and products (e.g., acetate esters) are changed for water contents above an optimum level, which may limit the mass transfer processes and the conversion yields (Dias et al., 2018a). The mean particle diameter was calculated through the static light scattering method using a Multi-Angle Static Light-Scattering Mastersizer (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). The bulk density was determined by weighing a known volume of the enzyme, whereas the real density was calculated using helium gas and an automatic pycnometer (Micromeritics Multivolume Pycnometer 1305, Norcross, USA). The bulk and real densities ratio provided the bed porosity, according to Eq. (1). Table 1 presents the properties of Novozym 435. (1) ε b = 1 − ρ b ρ r"
5,Continuous synthesis of isoamyl acetate in SC-CO2,"2.4 Continuous synthesis of isoamyl acetate in SC-CO2 Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the continuous PBR used for the enzymatic production of isoamyl acetate from fusel oil in SC-CO2. The system was composed of a syringe pump (model 260D, Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, USA) and an HPLC pump (model 305, Gilson, Middletown, USA) to feed the SC-CO2 and substrates, respectively. The stainless-steel tubular reactor was assembled with an inner volume of 10 mL (8″ in length and 5/16″ inner diameter). The system also consisted of manometers, thermocouples, control valves and a needle valve (Swagelok, Ohio, USA), a flow meter (Alicat Scientific, Tucson, USA), and a micrometer valve (Autoclave Engineers, Erie, USA). For each experiment, the reactor was packed with 1 g of immobilized lipase, and glass wool was placed in the reactor extremities as a filter. First, the PBR was heated at the operational temperature, pressurized with CO2, and the substrates (fusel oil and acetic anhydride) were pumped into the reactor. The substrates + CO2 mixture passed through a static mixer before entering the reactor. The reaction time was fixed at 60 min based on previous works that successfully performed the biocatalytic conversion of isoamyl acetate under SC-CO2 in batch mode from standard isoamyl alcohol (Romero et al., 2005) and fusel oil as acyl receivers (Dias et al., 2018a, 2020). Substrates were allocated inside a reservoir (Fig. 1), entering the system at room temperature. The temperature control of the system was performed with the use of heating tapes with a sensor placed at their end. The heating tapes were placed outside the reactor and outside the needle and micrometering valves to prevent freezing, as shown in Fig. 2 . Effects of pressure (10–20 MPa), temperature (40–60 °C), substrates (fusel oil + acetic anhydride) flow rate ( Q S 1 / S 2 : 0.2–0.6 mL/min) and CO2 flow rate ( Q C O 2 : 0.4–1.2 L/min) were evaluated on the isoamyl acetate conversion, as shown in Table 2 . Table 3 presents the design for the experiments, in which the four parameters were evaluated in two levels added of two central points in duplicate totaling 20 experiments. According to the preliminary experiments, all PBR experiments were performed at a constant fusel oil to acetic anhydride molar ratio of 1:2 to guarantee that the whole isoamyl alcohol would be consumed in the reaction. The isoamyl acetate conversion (X, %) was calculated as the difference between initial and final isoamyl alcohol concentration (limiting reagent) (Macedo et al., 2003), as shown in Eq. (2). Where C i was obtained from the initial fusel oil characterization and C f was obtained from the molar concentration of the alcohols after the reactions. The isoamyl acetate conversion was obtained using the GC-FID, according to the methodology developed by Macedo et al. (2003), with some modifications. (2) X % = C i − C f C i × 100 The residence time (τ) was calculated as the ratio between the bed porosity ( ε b ) and the total bed volume ( V t ) to the substrates (fusel oil + acetic anhydride) flow rate ( Q S 1 / S 2 ), as shown in Eq. (3). In this case, the drag effects of compressed fluids in the substrate's flow rate were disregarded. According to the substrate's flow rate, the corresponded residence times were between 12 and 36.5 min. (3) τ = ε b V t Q S 1 / S 2"
6,Mass transfer modeling in PBR,"2.5 Mass transfer modeling in PBR The concentration profiles in the PBR can be mathematically described by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs). The main assumptions were mono-sized spherical enzymes, constant temperature and pressure, flow with axial dispersion, linear adsorption isotherm, and unchanged bed porosity. Also, it was assumed that all involved components have the same adsorption constant. Moreover, the fluid properties were approximated as those of pure CO2 because the mass fraction of CO2 in the fluid was more than 83%. From the mass balance for the components, the following PDEs are obtained for the fluid (Eq. (4)) and solid (Eq. (5)) phases: (4) ∂ C i ∂ t = D i ∂ 2 C i ∂ z 2 − u ∂ C i ∂ z − 6 k f i 1 − ε b d p ε b C i − C i s (5) ∂ q i ∂ t = 6 k f i 1 − ε b ρ b d p C i − C i s ± r i where, i is the counter (i = 1 for isoamyl alcohol, i = 2 for acetic anhydride, i = 3 for isoamyl acetate and i = 4 for acetic acid), C i (kmol/m3) and q i (kmol/kgEnzyme) are concentrations of component “i” in the supercritical and solid phases, respectively. C i s (kmol/m3) is the concentration of component “i” in the fluid layer sticking to the surface of particles, calculated with Eq. (6): (6) C i s = ρ b q i K i where K i is the partition coefficient of the component “i” between the solid and the fluid phase assuming that is the same for all components, ρ b is the bulk density of enzymes (kg/m3), z (m) is the axial coordinate along reactor, t (s) is the time, Di (m2/s) is the axial dispersion coefficient, u (m/s) is the interstitial velocity, d p (m) is the particle diameter, ε b is the bed porosity, and k f i (m/s) is the external mass transfer coefficient of the component “i”. Moreover, r i (kmol/kgEnzyme s) is the reaction rate, which is assumed as elementary for both forward and reverse reactions, as shown in Eq. (7): (7) r i = k 1 C 1 C 2 − k 2 C 3 C 4 where, k 1 and k 2 are the forward and reverse reaction constants (m6/kgEnzyme kmol s), respectively. The negative sign of r i in Eq. (7) is used for reactants, while the positive sign is used for the products. Boundary and initial conditions for the above PDEs are expressed in Eq. (8): (8) At t = 0 a n d 0 < z < L ⇒ C i = 0 , q i = 0 A t t > 0 a n d z = 0 ⇒ D i ∂ C i ∂ z = u C i − C i 0 a t t > 0 a n d z = L ⇒ ∂ C i ∂ z = 0 where L (m) is the reactor length, and C i 0 (kmol/m3) is the concentration of component “i” in the feed. 2.5.1 Model parameters The density and viscosity of CO2 were obtained from NIST Chemistry WebBook. The binary diffusion coefficient ( D i , C O 2 , cm2/s) of each component in CO2 was obtained using the (Wilke and Chang, 1955) correlation, according to Eq. (9): (9) D i , C O 2 = 7.4 × 10 − 8 ϕ C O 2 M C O 2 0.5 T μ V i 0.6 where μ is the CO2 viscosity (cP), T is the temperature (K), M C O 2 is the CO2 molecular weight (g/mol), and ϕ C O 2 is the association factor of CO2 (that is equal to unity). Moreover, V i is the molar volume of component “i” at its normal boiling point (cm3/mol) that can be calculated from the critical molar volume as proposed by Tyn et al. (1975) and shown in Eq. (10): (10) V i = 0.285 V c i 1.048 where V c i is the molar volume of component “i” at its critical point (cm3/mol). The axial dispersion coefficient ( D i ) was obtained using the correlation in Eq. (11) (Delgado, 2007): (11) D i D i , C O 2 = 1 τ i f P e < 0.1 P e 0.8 τ × P e + 0.4 i f 0.1 < P e < 4 P e 18 τ × P e − 1.2 + 2.35 S c − 0.38 i f 4 < P e a n d R e < 10 P e 25 S c 1.14 τ × P e + 0.5 i f P e 10 6 a n d R e 10 P e 2 i f 10 6 < P e where Pe and Sc are the Péclet and Schmidt numbers defined as shown in Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively. τ is the tortuosity factor that can be calculated in Eq. (14), according to Lanfrey et al. (2010): (12) Pe = u d p D i , C O 2 (13) S c = μ ρ D i , C O 2 (14) τ = 1.23 1 − ε b 4 / 3 ε b ϕ 2 where ε b is the bed porosity, and ϕ is the particles sphericity factor, which is equal to unity for a sphere enzyme. The mass transfer coefficient in the fluid phase ( k f i ) was calculated with Eq. (15), according to (Treybal, 1980): (15) k f i = S h D i , C O 2 d p where Sh is the Sherwood number that was calculated using a correlation reported by Tan et al. (1988) (Eq. (16)): (16) S h = 0.38 R e 0.83 S c 0.33 where Re is the Reynolds number (Eq. (17)): (17) Re = ρ u ε b d p μ According to our previous study on the biocatalytic production of isoamyl acetate from fusel oil under SC-CO2 in a batch reactor (Dias et al., 2020), the reverse reaction rate is by far smaller than the forward reaction rate. Thus, the reverse reaction rate constant (k2) was set to zero in the current work. However, the forward reaction rate constant (k1) and the partition coefficient (K) were determined by a trial and error procedure, so that the model predictions of isoamyl alcohol best approximated to experimental data. To solve the mathematical models (Eqs. (5) and (6)), the first and second partial derivatives of “C” for “z” were expanded using finite difference method. In contrast, the partial derivatives of both ""C"" and ""q"" for ""t"" were kept unchanged. Accordingly, the PDEs were converted to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which were numerically solved using ODE toolbox of MATLAB software (R2017a, MathWorks, Natick, USA)."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis The software Statistica for Windows 7.0 (Statsoft Inc., USA) was used to evaluate the isoamyl acetate conversion (X, %) from fusel oil, according to Tukey's test at the level of 5% (p ≤ 0.05)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Fractional factorial design,"3.1 Fractional factorial design The effects of pressure, temperature, Q S 1 / S 2 and Q C O 2 on the isoamyl acetate conversion under SC-CO2 were evaluated. Table 4 shows the fractional factorial design with the results for isoamyl acetate conversion. Nevertheless, it is difficult to evaluate from Table 4 the impacts of the independent factors, because the values of the isoamyl acetate conversion are similar considering the mean ± standard deviation. So, the estimated main effects for the experimental design are represented in Table 5 ."
10,Effects of substrates flow rate ( Q S 1 / S 2 ),"3.2 Effects of substrates flow rate ( Q S 1 / S 2 ) From Table 5 one can see that Q S 1 / S 2 had the highest impact on the isoamyl acetate conversion being followed by temperature, pressure and Q C O 2 . All parameters had a negative effect on the isoamyl acetate conversion, but only the effect of Q S 1 / S 2 was statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Studies of substrates flow rate and residence time are of great importance when assembling a reactor since an optimum balance between these parameters is aimed to optimize the process and to reduce production cost. Moreover, residence time provides valuable information about the packed bed operation, such as the formation of channels, stagnation, or dead zones (Ceron et al., 2018). Ceron et al. (2018) evaluated the synthesis of biolubricants by transesterification of palm kernel oil with isoamyl alcohol and simulated fusel oil in a continuous mode. The authors used immobilized lipase from Burkholderia cepacia in a free-solvent system. They noticed that when isoamyl alcohol was applied, no preferential paths were found, resulting in a satisfactory packing system. However, the use of fusel oil increased the residence time approximately 18%, which could be related to the substrate's nature, i.e., a mixture of components, resulting in a different flow rate. Bôas et al. (2017) synthesized isoamyl laurate from lauric acid and fusel oil using immobilized lipase from Rhizopus oryzae as the catalyst. Reactions were performed in batch and continuous modes with isooctane as solvent at atmospheric pressure, 45 °C and substrates flow rate of 1.8 mL/h. Boas et al. (2018) noticed that isoamyl alcohol was converted entirely in the first 36 h of residence time, while 90% of lauric acid was converted for the same reaction time. However, after 48 h, the water formation as a by-product led to the reduction of the ester formation. Furthermore, dos Santos et al. (2017) synthesized isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol and acetic anhydride using Novozym 435 as the catalyst under SC-CO2. They observed a reduction in the ester conversion from 63.1 to 36.1% when raising the substrates (isoamyl alcohol/acetic anhydride) flow rate from 0.00098/0.0005 to 0.0037/0.002 mol/min of substrates. This is first related to the reduction of the residence time of the substrates that consequently decreases the reaction time, and also to the reduction of removal of the water generated as a by-product, which leads to the decrease of the enzyme activity (dos Santos et al., 2017). Dalla Rosa et al. (2009) evaluated different substrates flow rates in the synthesis of fatty acid ethyl esters under compressed fluids using Novozym 435 as the catalyst. In that work, high substrates flow rate (2.0 mL/min) reduced the conversion due to the higher substrates' superficial velocity, which promoted a lower contact between the enzyme surface and the substrates. Salvi et al. (2018) synthesized geraniol esters in a continuous-flow packed bed reactor using Novozym 435 as the catalyst and n-heptane as the solvent, where the maximum conversion of 94% was obtained after 6 h of reaction at the optimum residence time of 15 min. In that study, higher conversions were achieved with the PBR compared to the batch stirred reactor due to the higher enzyme stability, no presence of shear stress of the enzyme, and the reduction of heat and mass transfer resistance because of the substrates laminar flow. In the present work, the lowest substrates flow rate (0.2 mL/min) resulted in higher isoamyl acetate conversions. A possible explanation for this trend is the longest residence time (36.5 min) in this condition, inferring that a longer contact time between substrates and enzyme surface reduced the mass transport limitations, thus enhancing the isoamyl acetate conversion."
11,Effects of pressure and temperature,"3.3 Effects of pressure and temperature One can see from Table 5 that the effects of pressure and temperature on the isoamyl acetate conversion were not statistically significant at the level of 5% (p > 0.05), suggesting that Novozym 435 is thermostable at the evaluated temperatures, keeping its activity and stability. Studies of pressure and temperature on biocatalytic reactions under SC-CO2 are essential to understand the substrate's behavior in dense CO2, reaction mixture composition, mass transfer properties, and reaction kinetics. However, the impact of operational conditions in transesterification is challenging to predict since, on the one hand, high pressures can increase the solubility of the substrates, improving the reaction conversion, but on the other hand, the molar fraction of the reactants can reduce the initial reaction rate. Laudani et al. (2007) synthesized long-chain fatty acid esters using lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme RM IM) as the catalyst in a PBR system. The authors performed the reactions from 8 to 30 MPa at 40 °C and found an optimum pressure at 10 MPa with a maximum conversion of 90%. The pressure increment favored the reactional system due to a raise in the system diffusivity and a decrease in its viscosity and surface tension. However, at pressures above 10 MPa, the solubility of CO2 in the liquid phase changed, reducing the esterification yield. Moreover, that work evaluated different temperatures (35–110 °C) at 10 MPa. Temperatures above 50 °C induced denaturation of the enzyme, reducing its productivity and affecting the substrate's partition between the vapor and liquid phase. Another trend was found by Salvi et al. (2018), who evaluated different temperatures (40–80 °C) to synthesize geranyl esters in a PBR with Novozym 435 as the catalyst. They obtained an optimum ester conversion of 88% at 70 °C, observing an increase of the initial reaction rate with temperature, which could be related to the reduction of viscosity and raise of miscibility and diffusion of the substrates toward the enzyme (Paroul et al., 2011). Kirdi et al. (2017) synthesized isoamyl acetate through transesterification of isoamyl alcohol from fusel oil using a free-solvent fluidized bed system, with lipase from Aspergillus oryzae as the catalyst. The authors observed an increase in the isoamyl alcohol conversion from 24 to 89.55% with increasing the temperature from 30 to 70 °C. In this case, temperature could enhance the diffusion of the substrate and, therefore, improve the enzyme activity and molecular transfer. Aiming to reduce operational costs, reaction parameters were fixed at 10 MPa and 40 °C for the following experiments in the present work."
12,Effects of CO2 flow rate ( Q C O 2 ),"3.4 Effects of CO2 flow rate ( Q C O 2 ) The effects of CO2 flow rate ( Q C O 2 ) are also relevant since it correlates with the residence time of the substrates in a PBR. Moreover, the substrates can have their concentrations changed due to their transport from the active site of enzymes, reducing the by-products accumulation. Laudani et al. (2007) varied the CO2 flow rate from 75 to 570 L/h at 10 MPa, 40 °C and substrates flow rate of 18 mL/h. A linear increase in the product yield was observed up to 210 L/h CO2 flow rate, due to a faster substrates diffusion with minimum external limitations inside the bed. On the contrary, higher CO2 flow rates led to a decrease in the production yield because of the less available substrates in the reaction bulk. Couto et al. (2011) synthesized geranyl esters in a PBR using Novozym 435 as the catalyst under SC-CO2. They noticed that an increment in the SC-CO2 flow rate from 0.25 to 1.0 mL/min reduced the conversion rate due to the increase of the residence time. A similar trend was observed by Bourkaib et al. (2018) in the geranyl acetate production in a PBR under SC-CO2 and Lipozyme 435 as the catalyst. However, a different behavior was found in the present work, in which the CO2 flow rate did not show a significant effect (p > 0.05) on the isoamyl acetate conversion. It suggests that at the evaluated conditions, the substrates were still available to be in contact with the enzyme bed, overcoming the mass transport limitations. Thus, the possible effects of the SC-CO2 on the density of the substrates were too low to considerably modify the residence time. A reactional kinetic experiment was performed to evaluate the enzyme performance with time. Table 6 shows that the isoamyl acetate conversion did not have a significant change, according to Tukey's test at the level of 5% (p > 0.05), which can be explained by the high activity and stability of Novozym 435. In these experiments, the condition was fixed at 10 MPa, 40 °C, 0.2 mL/min substrate's flow rate, and 0.4 L/min CO2 flow rate."
13,Mass transfer modeling in the PBR,"3.5 Mass transfer modeling in the PBR The mathematical modeling of the PBR system was applied considering the previously fixed condition, pressure of 10 MPa, temperature of 40 °C, substrate's flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, and CO2 flow rate of 0.4 L/min. Before comparing the model results with the experimental data, it is necessary to calculate the required models’ parameters. These parameters were categorized into two groups as independent (1st) and dependent (2nd) on the transport components. The first and second groups are represented in Tables 7 and 8 , respectively. Fig. 3 illustrates the model and experimental data in terms of output mass of isoamyl alcohol per input mass of fusel oil. Zero conversion of the model in the first 3.5 h can be described as follow: since the initial concentrations of the whole involved components inside the reactor are zero, based on Eq. (8), the mathematical model without the diffusion term needs 6.359 h (the residence time) to detect the first components of reactants at the rector outlet because L/u = 0.2032 (m)/5.326 × 10−4 (m/s) = 381.539 s = 6.359 h. This time, however, is shortened to approximately 3.5 h (based on Fig. 3) as the diffusion term in the mathematical model enhances the mass transfer rate along the reactor, and the components flow out sooner. The discrepancy between model and experimental data may be explained by the assumptions adopted for modeling, such as considering the fluid properties as the same as pure CO2 properties, equal partition coefficients for all involved components, and ignoring the reverse reaction. Nevertheless, the model accuracy is acceptable from the engineering point of view, as its trend is similar to the experiments, and it passes through data points. Fig. 4 shows the concentration profiles on the fluid bulk and enzymes surfaces for isoamyl alcohol (Fig. 4a and b) and isoamyl acetate (Fig. 4c and d) along the PBR. It is clear from this figure that the concentration profiles have the same behavior for fluid bulk and enzymes, but with different numerical values. The concentration of isoamyl alcohol for shorter reaction time (t = 1, 2, and 3 h) decreases linearly, then drops sharply and finally reaches zero at the reactor outlet. At the same time, the concentration for the highest reaction time (t = 6 h) decreases gradually and stabilizes at a non-zero concentration at the reactor outlet. On the other hand, the concentration profiles of isoamyl acetate presented a different trend from those of isoamyl alcohol. Isoamyl acetate concentration increased initially along the reactor, reached a peak, and then declined with further progress along the reactor. The maximum concentration increased with reaction time, and its location moved toward the reactor outlet. Once validated, the model was used to investigate the effects of the input molar ratio of fusel oil per acetic anhydride (IMFA) and the length per diameter ratio (L/D) of the PBR on the reactor's performance. In this study, a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying only one parameter for each run while keeping the other parameters constant. Fig. 5 depicts the effects of IMFA on the output concentration of isoamyl acetate at t = 6 h. The isoamyl acetate concentration increased sharply from 0.03 kmol/m3 at IMFA of 0.053 to 0.19 kmol/m3 at IMFA of 0.667, reached a maximum of approximately 0.21 kmol/m3 at IMFA of 1.000 and then slowly declined at higher IMFA. While Fig. 5 recommends IMFA of 1.000 for attaining the highest isoamyl acetate from theoretical perspective, this work used excess moles of acetic anhydride (IMFA of 0.5) to ensure that all the isoamyl alcohol would be converted to isoamyl acetate. Fig. 6 reveals the effect of the length per diameter ratio (L/D) of the PBR on the output mass of isoamyl acetate per input mass of fusel oil. As can be seen, the L/D ratio did not considerably change the PBR performance for either high or especially small reaction times. All curve profiles passed through one single point at the reaction time of approximately 5.5 h, regardless of the L/D ratio. For the reaction time higher than 5.5 h, PBR with a higher L/D ratio (25 and 50) provided higher efficiency. Therefore, the model suggests the use of PBR with a higher L/D ratio for isoamyl acetate production from fusel oil under supercritical conditions for improved performance of the PBR. Besides, according to Fig. 6, little difference was observed between L/D of 25 and 50 after 5.5 h. It is worthwhile to reiterate that the L/D ratio of the reactor used in this study was 25.6, thus being a value capable of providing higher isoamyl acetate conversions. The positive impact of increasing the length per diameter ratio of packed-bed reactor and extractor on their efficiencies was also reported by Rodrigues et al. (2020) and Hatami et al. (2020), respectively."
14,Conclusions,"Isoamyl acetate esters were successfully synthesized from fusel oil, a by-product obtained in bioethanol plants, in a continuous mode under SC-CO2 and Novozym 435 as the catalyst. A fractional factorial design was applied to study the effects of pressure, temperature, Q S 1 / S 2 , and Q C O 2 . Only Q S 1 / S 2 had a significant effect on isoamyl acetate conversion, where the highest conversion was achieved at the lowest substrates flow rate (0.2 mL/min). A possible explanation for this trend is the higher residence time (36.5 min) at this condition, which enhances the contact between reactants and enzymes. Reaction kinetics were performed for 6 h at the fixed condition of 10 MPa, 40 °C, 0.2 mL/min substrate's flow rate, and 0.4 L/min CO2 flow rate. The ester conversion did not change with time, suggesting that Novozym 435 kept its stability and activity during the process. The phase equilibrium diagram showed that at 10 MPa and 40 °C the reaction medium of fusel oil and acetic anhydride is characterized as a pressurized monophasic system. The applied mathematical model fitted acceptably to experimental data. The model presented two adjustable parameters, the reaction rate constant ( k 1 = 1.170 × 10−3 m6/kgEnzyme kmol s) and the partition coefficient (K = 38) at 10 MPa and 40 °C. After the model validation, the impacts of the input molar ratio of fusel oil to acetic anhydride (IMFA) and the L/D ratio of the PBR were highlighted. The isoamyl acetate concentration reached its maximum of 0.21 kmol/m3 at IMFA of 1.000. The impact of L/D was also significant, and a reactor with a higher L/D ratio resulted in higher performance. The primary motivation of this work was to present alternative reuse for fusel oil through a biocatalytic production of isoamyl acetate, aiming to reduce the industrial waste generated through an eco-friendly process. Suggestions for future works are related to a scale-up of the continuous production of isoamyl acetate under SC-CO2, the use of other acyl donors from natural matter, and the economic evaluation of the method."
