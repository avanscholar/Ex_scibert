0,Introduction,"The current global energy demand is mostly satisfied by fossil fuels, which are continuously being depleted. Therefore, the world faces a challenging future with limited access to energetics. In addition, severe pollution problems have arisen due to the presence of diverse byproducts from fossil fuel combustion [1]. These factors motivate the development of different methods for obtaining energy from clean renewable sources. However, the application of reliable energy alternatives still requires significant research efforts [2]. Hydrogen (H2) is a carbon free and clean fuel, as the only final byproduct of its combustion is water. The H2 production can also be helpful for addressing the global warming problem, in addition to replacing fossil fuels and diminishing their long-term effects [2]. H2 can be obtained as a byproduct of diverse biological processes, such as dark fermentation, photo fermentation and biophotolysis [2]. These processes are considered to be less energy demanding and more environmental friendly than processing fossil fuels because organic wastes can be used as the substrates and because of the reduction in CO2 production [3]. During dark fermentation (DF), carbohydrate-rich substrates are metabolized anaerobically to produce H2. Under anaerobic environments, protons (H+) can act as electron acceptors to neutralize the products generated by the oxidation of organic substrates, yielding the production of H2 [4,5]. Acetate and butyrate are two of the most common byproducts of DF [6]. Another method for producing H2 is photo fermentation (PF). During the PF process, under anaerobic conditions, photoheterotrophic bacteria use light as an energy source and metabolize organic molecules to produce biomass, H2 and CO2 as the primary byproducts. Some remarkable photoheterotrophic microorganisms include the purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB), which are capable of producing H2 due to their ability to use a wide spectrum of light energy and to consume organic substrates, such as organic acids (OAs). PNSB have demonstrated higher theoretical conversion yields from substrate to H2 compared to those obtained during DF processes [6,7]. Data found in the literature shows that both processes, DF and PF, are suitable for the obtention of H2 [2]. However, the complete utilization of the energy present in the substrate and the optimization of H2 production are still inadequate [8,9]. In this context, the primary drawback to the application of this technology is its low H2 production efficiency; therefore, much recent research has been performed to increase the H2 yield [10,11]. Some strategies that have been proposed to increase the efficiency of the process consist of different two-stage systems (e.g., dark fermentation followed by methanogenesis, photo fermentation, or electro hydrogenesis) [10,11]. Some researchers have focused their efforts on integrating the DF and PF processes [12–17]. Although DF has been claimed to be more feasible than PF, the main disadvantage of DF is that the H2 yield is limited to 33% of the theoretical yield [11]. During H2 production, a significant fraction of the carbohydrate feedstock is converted to OAs that remain untreated in the system [10,11]. Therefore, it is necessary to apply another process to remove the residual carbon and energy, which is expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) [11]. In particular, the sequential process of DF and PF would allow: a) the treatment of residual materials; by using DF as the initial stage, a wide range of substrates (including organic solid waste and wastewater) can be transformed into H2 and soluble metabolites, such as OAs and alcohols, at a high production rate [13,15,16]; and b) the further treatment of the soluble byproducts obtained at the end of DF and the increased production of H2 at the expense of light energy. Hence, the highest theoretical H2 yield of 12 mol H2/mol glucose can be achieved through a combination of DF and PF processes. Consequently, adequate conditions during both DF and PF must be stablished before an effective and economically feasible integrated H2-producing system can be attained [18–20]. There are several options for the integration of these two processes. Some researchers have focused on studying the effects of different culture operating conditions for the photoheterotrophic bacteria, and others have focused on improving the DF effluent to obtain suitable concentrations of the OAs required for H2 production by PF [13,17,18,20]. Authors agree that the overall efficiency of the process, the overall yield, and COD removal depend on: the composition and concentrations of the OAs contained in the DF effluents, the pretreatment of DF effluents, and the microbial population of photoheterotrophic bacteria used in the second stage [11]. The substrate used during the DF process defines the final composition and the concentration of the OAs contained in the DF effluents. In addition, these factors have effects on the H2 production obtained during the PF stage; when acetate is the substrate, lower H2 yields (4 molH2/molacetate) are achieved than when lactate is the substrate (6 molH2/mollactate). Additionally, the photoheterotrophic bacteria are sensitive to extremely high OA concentrations. An optimum substrate concentration allows the efficient use of the available substrate and the maximization of the production of the desired product [11,21,22]. This aspect could also be determined by the application of a pretreatment to the DF effluents. Different methods, such as physical (dilution, heat, freezing, ultrasonic, and ultraviolet) and chemical (acid, alkali, and organic) methods, have commonly been used for pretreating DF effluents [23–25]. Regarding the microbial population, for practical applications, the use of microbial consortium is a more realistic approach than pure microbial cultures during the PF stage. The study of interactions between environmental conditions in the reactor and the microbial ecology represents an important step toward developing sustainable and optimized H2 productivity in sequential DF-PF processes [26–29]. It is known that a single bacterial population might not possess all of the enzymatic machinery that is required for the hydrolysis of complex organic compounds come from organic wastes. One of the advantages of developing a functional microbial consortium is to enforce the symbiotic association of diverse microbes [30]. Another aspect to consider for the establishment of a sequential process is the ammonium concentration in DF effluents, which could limit or even inhibit H2 production during the PF stage [31]. It is well known that H2 production during a PF process is extremely repressed by the presence of ammonium, nitrogen and oxygen in the reaction environment [31]. The overall efficiency of the sequential DF-PF process is the result of the effects of diverse parameters and their combinations. Knowing this, the use of experimental designs, which allows the determination of the effects of various variables and their potential interactions, constitutes a very useful tool for process optimization [11]. While sequential two-stage processes using pure strains and model substrate have been extensively studied, less is known about the use of residual feedstock, mixed microbial consortiums and the effect of different by-products patterns obtain during DF. DF effluents composition plays a very important role in photoheterotrophic bacterial metabolism, and therefore is an area that should be further explored. The objective of this study is to understand how metabolic patterns (after DF) enhanced H2 production in the sequential DF-PF process. The effects of the initial substrate, with different carbon to nitrogen ratios (lactose, and a mixture of cheese whey powder (CWP), and fruit and vegetables waste (VFW)) on H2 production during a DF process were evaluated. The DF effluents, containing different OAs distributions, were then used as substrates for PF. Three levels of dilution of the DF effluents, used as a pretreatment, were evaluated to allow the PF process to occur and to enhance the conversion of the OAs into H2. The microbial evolution of both processes was determined."
1,Materials and methods,"The two-stage process of DF-PF has the advantage of simultaneously increasing the H2 production and reducing the organic matter contained in organic residues. Some researchers have found that the main OAs in the DF effluents are acetate and butyrate. The hypothesis in this work is that by modifying the OAs fate during the DF stage, the process would be driven to a higher lactate production. This would in turn allow the process to reach higher HY at the PF stage. Accordingly, the experimental planning was as follows: At the DF stage, the C/N ratio was raised by increasing the proportion of the fruit and vegetable waste (FVW), a carbonaceous feedstock, in the mixture of FVW and cheese whey powder (CWP, predominantly a proteinaceous source) used as substrate. Consequently, the DF process was performed at five different C/N ratios. The H2 production, the COD elimination, and the OAs profile were determined. During the PF stage, the DF effluents with higher lactate concentrations were then diluted (1:2, 1:5, 1:10) and evaluated at the PF process. The H2 production and the COD elimination were also determined. Finally, the microbial population was analyzed in both processes to explain the performance and the mechanism of H2 production in each of the stages of DF-PF process. The overall H2 production can also be explained by these data."
2,Inoculum and substrates for DF fermentation,"2.1 Inoculum and substrates for DF fermentation The inoculum used for DF was obtained and characterized in a previous study [32]. The inoculum consists predominantly (85.4%) of Bifidobacterium and includes Klebsiella (9.1%), Lactobacillus (0.97%), Citrobacter (0.21%), Enterobacter (0.27%) and Clostridium (0.18%). A volume of 180 mL of the pre-inoculum was added to 1620 mL of the fresh substrate medium to prepare the inoculums. Systems with four different mixtures of FVW and CWP were used as initial substrate during the DF stage (Table 1 ). FVW was collected from a marketplace, its composition was as previously reported [32,33]. The CWP was obtained from LACTALIS (France). This product contains: proteins 11%, lipids 1%, lactose 69% and minerals 8.5% (reported by the manufacturer). As observed, the composition of the CWP used in the present study is different from the previously used crude cheese whey [32]. This CWP was used to obtain and evaluate higher C/N ratios than those evaluated during the previous study [32]. As seen in Table 1, four FVW:CWP ratios, 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, and 100:0 (%v/v), were tested, corresponding to C/N ratios of 39, 60, 71, and 82, respectively. Additionally, a mineral medium containing 30 g/L of lactose was used (C/N = 34). The mineral medium contains (g/L): 3 (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 KH2PO4, 2.4 K2HPO4, 1.5 MgSO4–7H2O, 0.15 CaSO4 and 0.03 FeSO4. Amber serological bottles with a total volume of 122 mL were filled with 100 mL of the five different combinations of FVW and CWP. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimps, and the gas phase was displaced by flushing with N2 gas to guarantee anaerobic conditions. These serological bottles were inoculated with 10 mL of inoculum. All of the systems were incubated at 35 °C and stirred at 150 rpm. The pH was set and manually maintained at 5.5 ± 0.5 using an NaOH solution (8N). Batch experiments were operated for 120 h. Liquid samples were taken at regular intervals to determine the biomass, pH and OA concentrations. At the same intervals, gas samples were obtained for H2 measurements. Before it was used in the PF experiments, DF effluent was first centrifuged (13000 rpm, for 15 min) and then sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Sterile DF effluent was diluted to 1:2, 1:5 and 1:10 with distilled sterile water. Dilution avoid inhibition of H2 production during the PF. This is achieved by reducing the high concentration of the OAs and nitrogen, knowing that this compound could cause inhibition of the nitrogenase enzyme responsible for the H2 production by the PNSB [11]."
3,Inoculum and substrates for PF,"2.2 Inoculum and substrates for PF The inoculum used for PF was a photoheterotrophic mixed consortium, arbitrarily labeled as C2. The microbial composition of this mixed consortium was previously reported [34]. This consortium was grown using the effluents from DF processes containing different OAs concentrations (acetate, butyrate, lactate and propionate). Dilutions of 1:2, 1:5 and 1:10 were evaluated for their abilities to increase H2 production. A set of transparent serological bottles with a total volume of 130 mL were filled with 60 mL of the DF effluents using the 6 treatments. As in the DF experiments, the fermentation systems were sealed and then flushed with Ar to obtain an anaerobic atmosphere. These serological bottles were inoculated with 20 mL of inoculum and were incubated at 30 °C, stirred at 150 rpm, and illuminated with white LED light (30 μ m o l m − 2 s − 1 ). The pH was initially set and maintained at 6.8 ± 0.5 using an NaOH solution (8N) and H2SO4 (5N). Batch experiments were operated for 240 h."
4,Analytical techniques,"2.3 Analytical techniques The H2 concentration in the gas phase was determined by a gas chromatograph (Gow-Mac 580 ®, Bethlehem, PA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, 120 °C). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The operational conditions was reported previously [32]. Fermentation byproducts, such as butyrate, acetate, propionate and lactate, were analyzed with a HPLC; PerkinElmer, Flexar, CA, USA equipped with a diode array detector. The acids were detected at 210 nm. A Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H+ (8%) column was used (Phenomenex®, Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of a sulfuric acid solution (0.01 M) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Samples were previously centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Eppendorf, MiniSpin) for 10 min, after which the supernatant was filtered (Whatman, 0.45 mm) prior to chromatographic analysis. Soluble protein and biomass were determined by the Bradford method [35], using the commercial reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total organic carbon was determined using the Walkley-Black method, and total nitrogen was measured by the Kjeldalh method."
5,DNA extraction and analysis,"2.4 DNA extraction and analysis DNA was extracted from 50 mL samples that were withdrawn from the serological bottles containing the various bacterial cultures using a modified CTAB protocol [32]. Cells from the broth were harvested in a tube by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 5 min followed by decantation of the supernatant. The pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 mL of a pre-heated CTAB extraction buffer, the mixture was incubated during 1 h at 65 °C. Once the samples were at room temperature, a chloroform-octanol solution (24:1) was added and then centrifuged at 1813 x g during 10 min. The aqueous supernatant was transferred into a sterile tube (1.5 mL) and 30 μL of RNase solution (10 mg/mL) were added. Samples were incubated during 50 min at room temperature. The DNA pellet was obtained by adding one volume of iso-propanol and centrifugation at 2414 x g for 10 min. The DNA pellet was re-suspended in TE buffer (1M Tris pH 8 and 0.5M EDTA) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Then, 1 mL phenol-chloroform solution (1:1) was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 1813 x g during 10 min. Afterwards, the total nucleic acid was precipitated with NaCl-ethanol solution and centrifuged at 9659 x g and 4 °C for 1 min. The purified DNA was eluted with 40 μL of miliQ water and kept at −20 °C before using it as template DNA for pyrosequencing analysis. For microbial population characterization, pyrosequencing (MiSeq) was performed at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA). The detailed protocols for the analysis of the sequences (DNA extraction and sequence analysis) are reviewed in Gomez-Romero et al. [32]. The analysis was modified according the specifications for the MiSeq platform. An additional data processing was performed by using the metagenomic analysis server (MG-RAST, http://metagenomic.anl.gov) [36]. Data were submitted (Project ID mgp86126) for online annotation using the quality control (QC) pipeline. A total of 218,301 reads were submitted, an average of 43,600 reads by sample was obtained with length of 292 bps. The reads that pass the QC pipeline (97.31%) were assigned to ribosomal RNA. The percentage of reads with predicted RNA genes annotated indicate the taxonomic distribution when the microbial consortium was exposed to different treatment to produce H2."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis To determine the effects of C/N ratio and dilutions, a factorial experimental design technique was used to optimize the experimental H2 production. A full factorial design of experiments was employed to study the effect of five C/N ratios (34, 39, 60, 71, 82) and 3 levels of dilution 1:2, 1:5, 1:10. The response variable was the cumulative H2 (mmol). The experimental design involved 30 batch experiments. The experimental data used for the analysis were the averages of values obtained in an independent experiment by triplicate. The regression analyses were performed by generating a second-order regression equation (1) using MATLAB™ software. (1) Y = α 0 + α 0 X 1 + α 2 X 2 + α 3 X 3 + α 12 X 1 X 2 + α 13 X 1 X 3 + α 23 X 2 X 3 + α 11 X 1 2 + α 22 X 2 2 + α 33 X 3 2 where Y is the response value obtained from RSM, and the coefficients α i , α j and α ij are the parameters estimated from the regression equation. From the evaluation of the response surface and, as proposed in the design of experiments, the coefficient values of the model were obtained. Equation (1) was derived by using the function of calculation of gradient in the MATLAB™ software, with respect to its independent variables for parameters corresponding to the maximum cumulative H2."

8,"Hydrogen, COD removal and byproduct distribution during the DF process","3.1 Hydrogen, COD removal and byproduct distribution during the DF process The DF process was initially evaluated to determine how the C/N increments modify the cumulated H2 production, the HY and the OAs metabolic patterns. This last aspect will in turn determine the HY at the PF stage. Table 2 summarizes the H2 production, COD removal and the metabolic byproduct concentrations as a function of the C/N ratio evaluated. The highest cumulative H2 production (31 mmolH2) was determined with the CWP as sole substrate (C/N = 39). The second higher cumulative H2 production of 20.2 mmolH2 was obtained with lactose, at a C/N ratio of 34, as the only substrate. As the proportion of FVW increased, the C/N ratio also increased, and the H2 production decreased. The highest HY obtained in this study considering the COD removed (Table 2) was of 387 mLH2/gCOD, at a C/N ratio of 34 (lactose). While a HY of 93 mLH2/gCOD was determined for the system with CWP as only substrate. When mixture of residues FVW:CWP, at C/N radios of 60, 72 and 80 were used as substrate, the HYs were lower. Under these conditions the highest HY of 12.5 mLH2/gCOD was obtained at a C/N ratio of 60. Reports in the literature concerning the HY obtained for different experimental systems can be arbitrarily classified into two groups: as those determined in a single-stage DF co-digestion process and those obtained in a two-stage DF-PF process. For the single-stage DF processes evaluated with a variety of residues as substrates. The maximum HY of 387 mLH2/gCOD obtained in this study is higher than some of those reported in the literature. Cheng et al. [37] reported that the HY obtained in a single-stage process of DF are in the range of 133–298.7 mLH2/gstarch (equivalent to 112.2 and 252 mLH2/g COD, respectively, calculated by using the data conversion of 1.185 gCOD/gstarch [11]) for different studies developed with cassava starch as substrate. Tawfik and El-Qelish [38] found a HY between 164 and 245 mLH2/gCOD for a co-digestion system of municipal food waste and kitchen wastewater. Zhou et al. [39] obtained a HY of 76 mL H2/g COD for a co-digestion process of food waste, primary sludge, and sewage sludge, and Rosa et al. [40] determined a HY of 42.2 mLH2/gCOD for a co-digestion of crude cheese whey (CCW) and glucose. Nevertheless, the maximum HY obtained is lower than the one reported by Mohanakrishna et al. [41] in a co-digestion of wastewater plant residues with vegetables wastes (641 mLH2/gCOD). The HY is also lower than that determined in a previous study [32], where a maximum H2 yield of 449.84 mL H2/g COD was found. The HY determined with CWP as substrate (93 mLH2/gCOD) is slightly higher than those reported by [39,40]. When comparing the maximum HY determined at the DF stage with data available in the literature for two stage DF-PF processes. The maximum HY is in the range of those reported by Cheng et al. [37] (351 mLH2/gstarch, equivalent to 296 mLH2/gCOD) and Zong et al. [42], who reported HYs of 212, 226 and 223 mLH2/gsubstrate when cassava, food waste and sucrose, respectively, were used as substrate. The HYs determined with the residues were lower than most of the data summarized above [32,37–41]. This pattern could be partially explained by the fact that the inoculum used in these experiments was initially adapted to lactose, as reported previously [32]. Due to the fact that this inoculum was previously used with a similar feedstock mixture, it was expected that the microbial population existing in the inoculum adequately assimilates both substrates namely FVW and CWP. In that previous study, a co-digestion process of FWV and crude cheese whey (CCW), at C/N ratios from 7 to 31 was evaluated. To obtain these C/N values none of the experimental systems contain only FVW, under these conditions it was demonstrated that the inoculum adequately assimilates the substrates, reaching high H2 production. However, in the present study the proportion of FVW was increased in the feedstock mixture to evaluate the effect of higher C/N ratios, the results suggest that the higher proportion of FVW constitute a substrate that cannot be easily degraded by the microbial community. On the contrary, as lactose is also present in CWP, it was easily assimilated by the microbial consortium, resulting in a higher H2 production. Moreover, the higher proportion of FVW promotes a change in the metabolic pathways to lactate, and a pH drop. In general, mixtures containing high organic wastes proportions constitute non-easily degradable substrates that require the activity of hydrolytic enzymes. Another aspect that negatively affects the DF process is the pH, which drops to 4 when organic residues are used at the higher C/N ratio. This effect can be explained by the low buffer capacity or low amounts of alkalinity that frequently lead to acidification and inhibition of activity when using increasing amounts of the FWV in the feedstock mixture. On the other hand, the co-digestion process of FVW and CWP at the adequate proportions allowed positive synergistic effects of the mixed materials with complementary characteristics and the supply of missing nutrients by the co-substrate (adequate carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and the macro- and micro-nutrients concentration). A balanced C/N ratio allows enhancing the buffer capacity of the DF system [32]. Additionally, as will be discussed in the next section, the low H2 production of the residues was a result of the deviation of the metabolic pathway to that of lactate, which in general reduces H2 production. The COD removal obtained in the DF stage is also shown in Table 2. The highest COD removal (95%) was obtained with lactose as the substrate. For the experiments where mixtures of residues were used, the COD removal increased with C/N ratio. It is well known that COD removals tend to be low, approximately 30%, when residues are used [32]. In the present study, the COD removal increased from 33%, obtained for CWP alone, to 64%, obtained for FVW as only substrate, and the second higher level of COD removal, 85%, was determined for the experiment using a mixture of FVW and CWP as the substrate, at a C/N ratio of 71. The total concentration of byproducts showed a relationship with the COD removal percentages (Table 2). The highest OA accumulation (18.5 g/L) corresponds with the highest COD removal percentage, measured at a C/N ratio of 71. One of the lower total OA accumulation and the lowest level of COD removal were found with CPW. The OA concentrations tended to increase when the C/N ratio increased for those experiments performed using mixtures of residues at different proportions. In general, data from the DF stage suggest that COD removal was increased for easily assimilate substrates, such as lactose, and increased as the FVW proportion was higher. However, the results suggest that these substrates were better used for biomass and by-products production, than for the H2 production. Once the nutrients were assimilated, the H2 production was inversely correlated with total OA accumulation. This suggests that H2 production competes with OA accumulation, and when more H2 is produced, fewer byproducts are formed. Significant differences in the metabolic patterns were determined as a function of the increased C/N ratio, data is shown in Fig. 1 . As seen in this figure, acetate, butyrate, propionate and lactate were determined as the main metabolic by-products during the DF stage. Each OAs production profile obtained at the different C/N ratios is presented in the corresponding graph. Fig. 1A shows that acetate was produced in most of the systems, except for the system at C/N = 34 (lactose), reaching a plateau at a concentration of around 0.75 g/L. Butyrate (Fig. 1B) was measured exclusively in the systems with lower C/N ratios of 34 and 39. At a C/N ratio of 34, butyrate accumulation started after 72 h and reached a maximum level of accumulation at 134 h of culture (2.5 g/L), being the main by-product under this conditions. At a C/N ratio of 39 (CWP), butyrate began to be produced after the 24th h and increased slowly to reach a maximum concentration of 1.2 g/L. The metabolic product propionate (Fig. 1C) was obtained in low concentrations in all the systems. At the lower C/N ratios of 34 and 39, the propionate started to be produced after 24 h and then remained almost constant at a low concentration (0.2 g/L) throughout the time culture at C/N of 34. The propionate concentration at a C/N of 39 (CWP) showed a steady increase during 72 h of culture, reaching its highest concentration, of 0.75 g/L, after 134 of culture. At the higher C/N ratios (60, 71, 82, residues) the propionate was initially produced and then presumably consumed, except for the highest C/N where the propionate production started after 48 h of culture and remain constant at the low concentration of 0.4 g/L (Fig. 1C). In Fig. 1D the lactate production at the different conditions evaluated is presented. Lactate was produced at low concentrations when lower C/N ratios (lactose and CWP) were used. However, at the higher C/N ratios (60, 71, and 82) the primary OA was lactate, reaching concentrations as high as 18.5 g/L at a C/N ratio of 71. This result could explain the low H2 production obtained during the DF experiments as H2 production is low for this metabolic pathway. As shown in Fig. 1E, the H2 production for the systems at the lower C/N ratios of 34 and 39 (lactose and CWP) started during the 24 and 48 h of culture, and continuously increased to reach the higher cumulative H2 production of around 600 and 800 mL for lactose (C/N 34) and CPW (C/N 39), respectively. In the systems with residues as substrates (C/N 60, 71, 82), the H2 production began during the initial hours of culture and remained constant throughout the rest of the culture attaining lower H2 cumulative production (around 200 mL) compared to those measured at C/N of 34 and 39. The complete results of Fig. 1 showed that the highest cumulated H2 production obtained with CWP (C/N 39) as substrate was associated with an equilibrated OA distribution, where all the OAs where found in concentrations between 0.5 and 2 g/L (Fig. 1 A, B and C). On the other hand, at the higher C/N ratio, the lower H2 production was related to a higher lactate accumulation, as primary metabolic product. The main goal in this section is to determine the effect increasing C/N ratio has on the H2 production and the metabolic fate. In general, experimental data showed that, both lactose and CWP are substrates that have C/N ratios in the optimal range as it has been reported by several researchers [32,43,44]. Lactose and CWP could be considered as “model substrates”, and they were easily assimilated by the microorganisms in the consortia, which allowed the production of higher H2 yields. While the systems with residues have higher carbon concentrations with respect to nitrogen. Hence, these systems showed higher OA concentrations, and the pH of the medium sharply decreased. Consequently, the metabolism of the bacteria responded negatively, resulting in lower H2 yields than for 34 and 39 C/N ratio-systems. The system with the highest level of OA accumulation also had the lowest H2 yield. The C/N ratios used in the present work were higher than those reported as being optimal in a previous study [32] and in other works found in the literature [43–46]. This finding could explain the low H2 production levels obtained using mixtures of residues (C/N ratios of 60, 71 and 82) and the byproduct patterns obtained, which differ from previous results [32]. According to the OAs distributions presented in the C/N ratios studied by Gomez-Romero et al. [32], (supplementary material, S1) it is necessary to study C/N ratios higher than 31 to obtain little to non-butyrate and more lactate. These aspects are important because it has been reported that butyrate at higher concentrations could reduce growth and H2 production in Rhodopseudomonas palustris and other H2 producing bacteria [31]. However, lactate is a reliable substrate for PF because a theoretical yield of 6 molH2/mollactate has been reported when using this substrate. Therefore, it is expected that these conditions would enhance H2 production during PF. Once the OA concentrations and production patterns were determined, a strategy to adequately couple the sequential process of DF and PF needed to be defined. In this study, the dilution of the DF effluents was proposed as a strategy for allowing the adequate performance of the PF process and the potential enhancement of H2 production during the sequential DF-PF process. The rationale for the use of this strategy was that the high levels of OAs obtained during DF (lactate, 14.34, 17.46 and 12.64 g/L), primarily when mixed residues were used (systems with C/N ratios of 60, 71 and 82), could inhibit the growth of the PNSB in the photoheterotrophic mixed consortium (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) [31]."
9,Hydrogen production during PF when using the DF effluents as substrates,"3.2 Hydrogen production during PF when using the DF effluents as substrates Most of the studies in the literature have been conducted with DF effluents containing mainly acetate and butyrate [42]. However, less is known about the use of lactate as substrate. This could result interesting since it is well known that theoretical HY is higher with lactate as compared to HY determined for acetate. Additionally, the effluents from the DF process were subjected to three levels of dilution to obtain adequate OA concentrations to perform the PF process, as the initial concentrations of OAs at high C/N ratios were extremely high (18.5 gOAs/L). Table 3 shows the cumulative H2 production, the H2 production rate (HPR), and the H2 yield as a function of COD removed when the five DF effluents at dilutions of 1:2, 1:5 and 1:10 were used as substrates. DF effluents from the systems containing the model substrates, lactose and CWP, reached higher H2 cumulative productions compared with the FVW:CWP feedstock. The highest cumulative H2 production of 38.6 mmolH2 was obtained during the PF process, using a 1:2 dilution of the DF effluents produced by a C/N ratio of 39. However, for practical applications, the H2 production is more interesting when a residual substrate is used instead of a model substrate, such as lactose. When the systems with different mixtures of residues (C/N ratios of 60, 71 and 82) were analyzed, the second higher H2 production of 35.0 mmolH2 was obtained using a 1:5 dilution of the DF effluents from a C/N ratio of 60. This value was similar to that obtained with the model substrate (C/N ratio of 39). A cumulative H2 production of 32.9 mmol was measured, for the DF effluent from a system with a C/N ratio of 71 at a 1:5 dilution. In these two experiments (C/N 60 and 71), at 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, the VHPR determined at the PF stage between 41.5 and 52.7 mLH2/Lh (Table 3), were higher than those reported in the literature. VHPRs of 21.1, 8.72, 16.4 and 34.04 mLH2/Lh have been reported at the PF for two-stage DF-PF processes using cassava starch, ground wheat solution, hydrolysate cassava starch and sugar beet molasses as initial feedstock, respectively [37,47–49]. Examining the HY as a function of the COD removal, the best results were obtained from systems at a C/N ratio of 60, at 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions. These systems reached high HY values of 496.0 and 781.1 mLH2/gCOD for 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, respectively. Similar behavior was determined for the system with an initial C/N ratio of 71, where the HYs were of 378.8 and 691.0 mLH2/gCOD at 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, respectively. The HYs obtained in the PF stage are similar to or in the higher range of some of those reported in the literature. Zong et al. [42] reported that the average HY during the PF stage of a two-stage process were of 611 mLH2/g cassava and 451mLH2/g food waste, these data were determined by using DF effluents containing acetate and butyrate as main substrates. In that work, the consumption profile of each of the substrates was determined, showing that acetate was completely and more quickly consumed than butyrate by R. sphaeroides ZX-5. This results corroborate that acetate is a more favorable substrate for PNS bacteria compared to butyrate, as it is reported by other authors [16]. The maximum HY found by Cheng et al. [37] in the PF process, as part of a two stage DF-PF process, was of 489 mLH2/gstarch (412 mLH2/gCOD). Su et al. [47], reported a maximum HY of 131.9 mLH2/gstarch (111.3 mLH2/gCOD) obtained at the PF stage in a two-stage DF-PF process with cassava starch as initial substrate. In general, the HY and the VHPR were high at the PF stage, this can be explained by the fact that lactate and acetate were the main by-products in the DF effluents used during the PF process. Our findings are corroborated with other published works as for example with data presented and analyzed by Lo et al. [16]. These authors evaluated the cell growth and photo-H2 production by R. palustris WP3-5 on acetate, butyrate and lactate as individual substrates at different increasing concentrations and as part of a DF effluent. Their results showed that if acetate is the only substrate, the VHPR increased as the initial acetate concentration increase from 1 to 4 g/L, reaching the highest HPR of 19.8 mLH2/Lh at an acetate concentration of 4 g/L. If lactate is the only substrate, the highest VHPR (17 mLH2/Lh) was determined at a lactate concentration of 5 g/L. Finally, when butyrate was evaluated, the corresponding maximum VHPR of 11.67 mLH2/Lh was determined at an initial concentration of 2.0 g/L. These results highlight that it is necessary to optimize the appropriate conditions for higher lactate and acetate, and lower butyrate production during the DF stage to enhance the H2 production at the PF stage. Data showed the potential use of DF effluents (from systems with C/N ratios of 60 and 71) in a second sequential PF process, obtaining high cumulative H2 production and HY. The high H2 production obtained during the PF could be explained by the fact that the dilution adequately reduces the OA concentrations and the residual ammonium concentration. Moreover, the DF effluents of these systems contained lactate as the main substrate for the PF process (as shown in Fig. 1F), which usually allows a higher H2 theoretical yield compare with that when acetate is the primary substrate (6 molH2/mollactate instead of 4 molH2/molacetate). The H2 production was similar to the highest level achieved with a model substrate, and the potential to eliminate the FVW and produce clean energy was demonstrated. The results also showed the positive effect of diluting the DF effluents to obtain high levels of H2 production during the PF process. These results agree with the data reported by Hitit et al. [11], whose determined, through the use of a surface response methodology, that the dilution of DF effluents had a stronger effect than those of the R. palustris inoculum concentration or the pH value on the PF process. These authors reported that the highest H2 yield was of 8.3 ± 0.1 mmolH2/gCOD and that this yield was obtained with a cell concentration of 1.64 ± 0.7 × 108 cells (9 mL inoculum), at a DF effluent dilution of 2.5 and a pH of 7.5. Similar results about the key role of dilution of the DF-effluents has been reported by Chen et al. [13], these authors reported that the best photo-H2 production at a dilution ratio of 1:2, giving a highest overall H2 production rate of 10.7 mL H2/L h (26 mL H2/g COD) in a two stage DF-PF process carried out with Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5. The data shown in Table 3 were also analyzed by the response surface methodology to statistically validate and optimize the H2 production. The surface methodology considered the dilution and the C/N ratio of the effluent to be independent variables. The response variable to be optimized was the cumulative H2 level. The experimental H2 production data were interpolated by implementing the spline technique, as shown in Fig. 2 . The variation in H2 yields, with respect to the C/N ratios and dilutions (D), shows that there exists a region where higher cumulative H2 can be obtained (red zone in Fig. 2). If the C/N ratio decrease, the dilution must decrease as well, resulting in a cumulative H2 production in the range of 35–40 mmol (Zone A in Fig. 2). Otherwise, if the C/N ratio increases (from 30 to 80) but the dilution increases, the cumulative H2 production is in the range of 30–35 mmol (Region B in Fig. 2). The absolute maximum cumulative H2 production was attained when the C/N ratio is near 30 and the dilution is 1:2 (0.5). This result agrees with previously reported results [11]. The cumulative H2 production decreases down to 5–10 mmol if both the C/N ratio and the dilution either decrease (Zone C in Fig. 2) or increase over 80 (Zone D in Fig. 2), simultaneously. The results corresponding to the C zone can be explained because, if C/N is much lower than 20 and the dilution is 1:10, there is not enough both C and N to sustain the metabolic activity. On the other hand, the low H2 production observed in the D zone can be a consequence of the relative excessive carbon concentration (no dilution) with respect to the nitrogen concentration. By applying the least mean square parameter identification method and using the design of experiments technique, the coefficient values of the quadratic linear model were obtained using the MATLAB™ software (Equation (2)). (2) Y (C/N, D) = −103.54 + 4.2025 C/N + 77.668 D - 0.5706 C/N * D −0.0347 C/N 2–0.49.508 D 2 The coefficients of Eq. (1) represent the relationship between the H2 production and the C/N ratio, as well as the dilution. The calculated optimum values were a C/N ratio of 34 and a dilution of 1:2. These values are near those found experimentally (C/N = 39 and dilution = 1:2). Therefore, based on this model, it is possible to predict the H2 production when using different DF effluents and dilution as an intermediate treatment in a sequential system of DF and PF. The results of the dilution strategy showed that the maximum cumulative H2 production requires fixing the C/N ratio approximately 30, with a dilution of 1:2 for the DF effluents used as the PF process substrate."
10,Overall H2 production obtained during the sequential process of DF-PF,"3.3 Overall H2 production obtained during the sequential process of DF-PF In this section the overall H2 production during the two-stage process is presented. These data are useful to highlight the effect of the modified OAs pattern in the DF effluents and to explain the mechanism that allowed the enhancement of the H2 production by increasing the cumulative H2 production and the HY during the PF process when the DF effluents enriched in lactate were used. An analysis of the role of each one of the stages to the overall H2 production under the complete scheme of the DF-PF process is also presented. These aspects constitute the main contribution of the approach evaluated in this study. The overall H2 production, represented as total cumulative H2 production, and overall HY obtained during the sequential process of DF-PF (at the different C/N ratio and dilution evaluated) are shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3 A-B, C-D and E-F the H2 production determined at the corresponding 1:2, 1:5 and 1:10 dilution, respectively, is depicted. Data of the total cumulative H2 (mmol) is presented in panels A, C and E of this figure. While data of the overall HY (mLH2/gCOD) is included in panels B, D and F. As seen in Fig. 3A, the highest final cumulative H2 production determined during the complete two stage DF-PF process was of 69.7 mmol H2, this result was determined when a C/N ratio of 39 was used during the DF stage and its effluent was diluted 1:2 during the PF stage. The second-best result for cumulative H2 production was of 48.4-mmol H2 , which was obtained with the same DF effluent at a 1:10 dilution (Fig. 3E). At increased C/N ratios of 60, 71 and 82 the highest cumulative H2 production was of 41.4-mmol, as shown in Fig. 3C. This cumulative H2 was attained when a C/N ratio of 60 was used during the DF stage, and the DF effluent was diluted 1:5 for use as the substrate during the PF process. Since the coupled process of DF-PF main advantage is its potential use for a simultaneous elimination of the organic matter contained in the residues and the H2 production, the analyses of the results must consider both the H2 production and highest COD removal. The highest overall HY of 1462.5 mLH2/gCOD (equivalent to 45.5 mmolH2/gCOD) obtained during the DF-PF process was the system with CWP (C/N 39) as substrates at a 1:10 dilution (Fig. 3 F), this HY is higher than some of those reported in the literature [11]. However, the analysis of the systems with residues (FVW-CWP) as the initial feedstock is more interesting. Moreover, studies using real feedstocks are rather limited compared with those using model substrates. The higher overall values of HY, 695.4 and 793.7 mLH2/gCOD (equivalent to 21.7 and 24.7 and mmolH2/gCOD, respectively) were determined with the residues at 60 and 70 C/N ratio and at a dilution of 1:10 (Fig. 3 F). These values are in the higher range than those reported in the literature for two-stage systems where starch (16.1 mmolH2/gCOD), starch/glucose (8.3 mmolH2/gCOD), and cassava starch (15.2 mmolH2/gCOD) were used as substrates [3,11,47]. And similar to those obtained in other works for sucrose (26 mmolH2/gCOD) and for cassava and food waste (28.1 mmolH2/gCOD) as substrates [12,42]. These higher overall HY are also similar to those reported by [42]. These authors reported a two-step DF-PF process, performed using an anaerobic consortium and R. palustris; using cassava and food waste as the feedstocks, total H2 yields of 810 and 671 mLH2/gsubstrate, respectively, (equivalent to approximately 680 and 536 mLH2/gCOD) were obtained. Ozgur et al., 2010 [49] evaluated a sequential DF-PF process using sugar beet molasses as the feedstock. In that work, the DF process was developed with the thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and several photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodobacter capsulatus wild type, R. capsulatus hup-mutant, and R. palustris) were used during the PF stage. A maximum volumetric productivity of 7.1 mmolH2/Lh was obtained during the DF stage in the absence of NH4. During the PF stage, a maximum HPR of 1.59 mmolH2/Lh was obtained using R. palustris, and an overall HPR of 8.7 mmolH2/Lh was reported. These values are higher than those obtained in the present study, which are in the range of 3.9 and 3.2 mmolH2/Lh for the systems using 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, respectively, at a C/N ratio of 60. The HY value obtained as a function of COD reported by these authors is also higher with our results, they obtained an overall H2 yield of 35.7 mmolH2/gCOD, while in the present work, we obtained maximum overall HYs of 21.7 and 24.7 mmolH2/gCOD for the systems mention before. More recently, Mishra et al., 2016 [50], reported an HPR of 562.93 mLH2/Lh, which is higher than those obtained in the present work (74.0 and 62.8 mLH2/Lh, 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, respectively, using a C/N ratio of 60). These authors used palm oil wastes as the substrate in a continuous DF-PF process. In general, the overall HY determined with the sequential DF-PF process were higher than those obtained with the individual processes. Using lactose as substrate at a C/N of 34, a HY of 387 mLH2/gCOD was determined during the DF stage. Whereas, the HY determined was 410.4 mlH2/gCOD during the PF at a 1:10 dilution. The overall HY for the DF-PF process was of 797.4 mlH2/gCOD. This shows that the HY was more than three times higher when the DF-PF process was used as compared to the individual processes. For the CWP (C/N 39) the HY were of 93, 1369.1 and 1462.5 mLH2/gCOD, at the DF, PF with 1:10 dilution and during the two stage DF-PF process, respectively. This effect was most important when the residues (FVW:CWP) were used; for a C/N of 60 the HY obtained at DF was of only 12.5 mLH2/gCOD. Furthermore, 781.1 mLH2/gCOD was determined at the PF with a dilution of 1:10 and 793.7 mLH2/gCOD was measured when the two-stage process was used. Comparing the results obtained in the present work with the literature, it can be noticed that the overall HY obtained at the two-stage DF-PF process is similar to some of those already reported [3,11,12,42,47]. Several previous studies for biological H2 production using two-stage systems have been conducted using DF effluents that mainly contain acetate and butyrate. It is important to highlight that in this work it was possible to obtain similar overall HY by using DF effluents with higher lactate concentration, being this substrate the main metabolic product of the DF stage. The effect of this modification was an increased H2 production during the PF stage as compare with de H2 production determined at the DF stage. This effect was particularly important when the mixture of residues (FVW:CWP) were used as substrates at higher C/N ratio. The overall results shown that the PF has the major role during the H2 production as seen in Fig. 3. Difference in performance among the two-stage processes reported in the literature and the present work is most likely due to differences in DF effluents composition, with most of the DF effluents containing a significant amount of acetate and butyrate, while the FVW:CWP DF effluents had higher amounts of lactate. As seen in Fig. 3, data showed that in general the H2 production was higher at the PF stage compare to the one obtained at the DF stage. This effect was mainly observed when mixture of residues was use at the higher C/N ratios. These results differ from some published works [37,42], where the increment in H2 production from the DF to the PF processes is by approximately two or three fold at the PF stage, and could be partially explained by the carbon source (primarily lactate) and the microbial population present during the process, which is why a microbial characterization analysis was performed. This project was developed to shed light into the fundamentals that drive the design of an efficient two-stage DF-PF process for H2 production. The possibility to enhance hydrogen production using two cheap and residual materials in co-digestion is of special interest. The feasibility to design an effective process in a two-stage DF-PF configuration based in a detailed study of the by-products and description of microbial ecology evolution the process led us towards a better understanding and control of the process. Considering the overall results, we could postulate a complete scheme for a successful application of the two-stage DF-PF process: the mixture of FVW and CWP at a 60 C/N ratio could be use as initial substrate at the DF. The initial substrate containing complex carbohydrates and lactose (constituting the total COD) is 45% consumed to generate lactate, acetate and for H2 production (HY = 12.5 mLH2/gCOD). Then, acetate and lactate (0.5 and 14 g/L, respectively) 10 times diluted are used as substrate for the PF. These substrates are approximately 60% consumed by PNSB to reach a higher HY of 781.1 mLH2/gCOD at the PF process. The overall HY (793.7 mLH2/gCOD) is in the higher range of those reported for two-stage DF-PF processes."
11,Microbial composition,"3.4 Microbial composition The microbial composition of the mixed culture used during DF and PF was characterized (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4A shows the initial microbial composition used at the DF stage. Data obtained agree with the OA distributions determined in the DF effluents. In the first case, when lactose was used as the substrate (C/N = 34) Fig. 3B, a greater percentage of Acetobacter lovaniensis, 82% at specie level, explains the smaller concentrations of acetate and lactate in the effluent because these bacteria are capable of oxidizing both substrates to CO2. In this consortia, the H2 producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum (10%) and Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum (3%) were also identified, which help other bacteria hydrolyze long-chain carbohydrates for consumption and transformation into H2, as reported by [32]. In the second case, when CWP was used as the substrate C/N = 39. A microbial population distribution of 36% of Clostridium butyricum and 20% of Enterobacter sp, which represent 56% of the H2 producing bacteria in the consortia was obtained (Fig. 4C). This microbial population promotes the highest H2 production at DF stage, and a regular distribution of the OAs in the effluent was found. Acetate, butyrate, propionate and lactate were all at concentrations lower than 2 g/L, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, with this substrate, it was possible to obtain 29% proportion of Bifidobacterium bacteria, which Gomez Romero et al. reported to be a syntrophic microorganism for H2 production [32]. When FVW was used as the substrate (C/N = 82), a higher percentage of Lactobacillus casei was obtained (71%), which explains the higher concentration of lactate (12.64 g/L) that was found in the effluent. The presence of Lactobacillus sp. has been reported to have a negative influence on the H2 production process Lazaro et al., in 2015 [51], because these bacteria represent substrate competitors and are capable of excreting bacteroicines that inhibit the growth of different species, such as Clostridium sp. Lactobacillus sp. are the most common bacteria in fermentation cultures that are performed under nonsterile conditions [52]. In addition, Göis et al. [53] confirmed that Lactobacillus competes with other microorganisms due to their fast growth and considerable tolerance to low pH. The presence of Lactobacillus species explains the generation of organic acids such as lactate in the present study. During the PF stage where the photoheterotrophic consortium C2 was used (Fig. 4E), the predominant microbial population at the species level (98%) was Rhodopseudomonas palustris under the evaluated conditions. The microbial distributions and evolution analysis elucidate relevant facts for why a C/N ratio of 39 resulted in better H2 production and productivities in this study. Through this analysis, it is possible to understand what composition and distribution of the effluent results in improved performance during PF and to suggest the optimal experimental conditions that justify the coupling of DF-PF. These conditions yield an enhanced H2 production levels that agree with the results generated by the response surface methodology."
12,Conclusions,"The feasibility of the enhanced H2 production by a two stage of dark fermentation (DF) and photo fermentation (PF) process was demonstrated. The process was developed using a mixture of FVW and CWP as initial feedstock at different C/N ratios. During the first stage of the process (DF), the type of substrate and the C/N ratio allows for the control not only of the H2 yield but also of the obtained intermediate products. These metabolites define the H2 production during the PF process because some OAs, such as lactate, favor higher H2 yields. H2 production was low during the DF stage due to the metabolism being deviated to the production of lactate. However, this compound, when used as the primary substrate for the PF stage, allowed high H2 production. Regarding the overall sequential DF-PF process, two behaviors were determined: a) for the model substrates, the highest HPR, 157.5 mLH2/Lh, was obtained when a C/N ratio of 39 was used during the DF stage and its effluent was diluted 1:2. These results corresponded with the experimental conditions predicted by the response surface methodology. Considering the most interesting use of waste as an initial feedstock, maximum HPRs of 74.0 and 62.8 mLH2/Lh, which correspond with overall HY values of 508.5 and 793.7 mLH2/gCOD, respectively, and were obtained at 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions, respectively, for the system at a C/N ratio of 60. The predominant microbial populations were identified for both processes; at DF the microbial population change as a function of the C/N ratio defining the metabolic patterns and the net H2 yield. At the PF stage performed with the photoheterotrophic mixed consortium, the predominant microbial population (up to 98%) was R. palustris."
