0,Introduction,"As the depletion of fossil fuels, the development of hydrogen energy becomes exigent. Hydrogen is generally recognized to be the ultimate form of energy. There are plenty of ways to generate power through hydrogen, like combustion and electrochemical conversion [1]. High efficiency, no pollution, and energy sustainability make polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells one of the most hopeful energy converters. PEM fuel cells contain four main parts: the polymer electrolyte membrane for conducting protons, insulating electrons, and separating H2 and O2, the catalyst layer where the HOR and ORR occur, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) for distributing gas, the bipolar plate fabricated with gas and coolant channels. The combination of the first three, namely, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), is the core of PEM fuel cells, determining the cost, performance, and durability. PEM fuel cells are generally fed with hydrogen at the anode and air at the cathode. In practice, high-pure hydrogen is necessary because the catalyst is very sensitive to impurities, such as carbon monoxide and sulfide. Nevertheless, high-pure hydrogen is rarely naturally existing. Water electrolysis can produce high-pure hydrogen, but the loss outweighs the gain unless renewable energy, like wind and solar, is used to generate electricity. More importantly, the cost and durability of the electrolyzer remain to be intractable technical challenges [2]. Furthermore, gaseous hydrogen is inconvenient to be stored and transported due to the incomplete hydrogen infrastructure. As a result, hydrogen production by water electrolysis is limited in application. Thus, a suitable hydrogen carrier that is accessible, renewable, and easy to be stored and transported will benefit the development of hydrogen energy in the near future. First of all, a survey of diverse hydrogen production pathways needs to be conducted."
1,Hydrogen sources and production,"1.1 Hydrogen sources and production Hydrogen can be produced by hydrocarbon reforming, hydrocarbon pyrolysis, and biomass gasification. Besides, water splitting via electrolysis, thermolysis, and photo-electrolysis has drawn attention recently [3–5]. There are three types of reforming: steam reforming, partial oxidation, and auto-thermal reforming. Steam reforming of hydrocarbon accounts for a large share of hydrogen production. About 49% of global hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) [6]. In the United States, about 95% of hydrogen is produced by SMR [7]. The reaction using methane to produce hydrogen is as shown in Eq. (1): (1) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 Nikolaidis et al. [5] reviewed 14 hydrogen production methods, including conventional and renewable ways, as shown in Fig. 1 . Meanwhile, cost, conversion efficiency, and trend are compared. Hwang [6] compared steam reforming of natural gas or corn ethanol, water electrolysis with gird or solar energy, and coal gasification with or without carbon sequestration in terms of life-cycle energy consumption and greenhouse emission (GHG). The electrolysis with gird is not recommended for the enormous energy consumption and GHG emission during electricity generation processes."
2,A suitable carrier of hydrogen: an introduction to methanol,"1.2 A suitable carrier of hydrogen: an introduction to methanol As the simplest alcohol, methanol is an essential raw material for many chemicals. Moreover, it is considered as a promising hydrogen carrier in the development of hydrogen economy [8,9]. Fig. 2 (a) shows the production capacity of China from 1995 to 2011. China has the biggest share of the global production of methanol. Fig. 2(b) shows the primary raw materials for methanol production in China. Coal and natural gas are widely used in methanol production, which adapts to the Chinese energy structure. 98% production of methanol is based on coal, natural gas, and coke-oven gas in China [10]. Also, methanol can be produced by CO2 hydrogenation [11], biomass [12]. Various technologies utilizing methanol to produce hydrogen are developed [13], as listed in Table 1 . Methanol can fuel direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), which has been investigated for many decades. The reactions for DMFCs are shown in Eq. (2): (2) Anode : Cathode : Overall : CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e - 3 / 2 O 2 + 6 H + + 6 e - → 3 H 2 O CH 3 OH + 3 / 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O In recent years, steam reforming of methanol for onboard hydrogen supply draws much attention. Methanol has great potential for hydrogen storage. Steam reforming of methanol can produce hydrogen with a high density of 18.8% by weight [19] when reusing the water generated in PEM fuel cells. It can release 99 g hydrogen per liter at room temperature, comparing to 71 g for liquid hydrogen in cryogenic containers [20]. The most significant advantage of methanol is that it is liquid at room temperature and ambient pressure, which is suitable for storage, transportation, and existing filling stations. As the simplest alcohol, methanol has a high H/C ratio and can be reformed at low temperatures and pressures [21], which allows low CO contents. There is no sulfur contained in methanol owing to the methanol production process [22]. Producing methanol by coal and natural gas has great potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by recycling the CO2. Xu et al. [23] captured and reused carbon dioxide that was generated during coal gasification to produce methanol, significantly reducing the carbon emission. Methanol-based coal refining can also serve the purpose of efficient and clean utilization of low-quality coal [24]. Methanol has been developed as a vehicle fuel for almost ten years in China. Some places, like Shaanxi Province and Shanxi Province, apply methanol as an alternate fuel for spark-ignited engines to save gasoline [10]. However, using methanol to produce hydrogen arouses concern about carbon emission, primarily when carbon fuels produce methanol. Therefore, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is needed during the process of methanol production [25]."
3,Hydrogen storage and transportation,"1.3 Hydrogen storage and transportation Hydrogen is the substance with the smallest molecular mass. It is gaseous and explosive at room temperature. Therefore, efficient and safe storage of hydrogen is crucial for applications of PEM fuel cells [26,27]. High-pressure containers can store 4% of hydrogen by mass, which is researched extensively in recent years [28]. Carbon-fiber-wrapped tanks are often used to store hydrogen at pressures of 350 bar and 700 bar [29]. Liquid hydrogen storage at high pressure and low temperature is preferred to enhance the mass density. The density of liquid hydrogen is 70.8 g/L. Due to the massive electricity used for liquefaction, liquid hydrogen is usually used in space technology and military aircraft. Magnesium is a good metal storage material with 7.6 wt% storage capacity and low cost. However, material modification needs to be further researched to improve adsorption/desorption kinetics and lower the hydriding/dehydriding temperature [30–33]. Lototskyy et al. [34] reviewed metal hydride-based hydrogen storage methods. Waste heat generated by the electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell is used to heat the metal hydride to release hydrogen, greatly enhancing the system efficiency. Appropriate metal hydrides for different types of fuel cell systems are discussed, aiming at high efficiency [34]. Other hydrogen storage methods have been investigated, like formic acid [35,36], nitrogen-doped graphene [37], porous materials [29,38]. Hydrogen can be transported by pipeline or compressed hydrogen trucks. Lahnaoui et al. [39,40] estimated different transportation methods considering the hydrogen demand and transportation distance, concluding that hydrogen will be transported at the high pressure of 250–350 bar in 2030 and 500–540 bar in 2050. The pipeline has advantages over compressed hydrogen trucks in the aspect of cost and energy consumption. Witkowski et al. [41] also compared the two methods in the aspects of thermodynamics and safety."
4,Comparison,"1.4 Comparison When comparing different hydrogen production methods, the routes from primary energy to end-users need to be considered, as shown in Fig. 3 . Hydrogen produced by water electrolysis fulfills the purity requirement for PEM fuel cells. However, the cost is too high to be accepted in practice use. Considering technical maturity and energy structure at present, life cycle assessment of hydrogen produced by water electrolysis indicates that it should combine with renewable energy for sustainability [43–45]. Hydrogen produced by reforming has one-third lower cost than electrolysis. Choosing liquid fuel reforming as the hydrogen production method will also significantly reduce the cost of storage and transportation [46]. Hao et al. [47] compared different storage and transport methods, concluding that methanol refueling station has the lowest GHG emissions and energy consumption among off-site hydrogen production via natural gas gasification, water electrolysis, and gaseous hydrogen. In terms of transportation, liquid hydrogen consumes the most energy and causes the most GHG emissions because abundant electricity is consumed for compressing and refrigerating hydrogen. Industrial production provides much impure hydrogen, like chlor-alkali process. Hydrogen produced by fossil fuel reforming also contains many impurity species. Some impurities may have severe effects on the PEM fuel cells. PEM fuel cells cannot utilize impure hydrogen directly. However, the utilization of impure hydrogen for PEM fuel cells can promote material utilization efficiency and solve the dilemmas of hydrogen storage and transportation, which can accelerate the commercialization of fuel cells. In the following sections, the sources of impure hydrogen are discussed first. Effects of impurities on the performance and durability of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM fuel cells are introduced in detail. The effects of carbon monoxide are emphasized. When PEM fuel cells are fed with impure hydrogen, the performance will decline rapidly. To avoid this, pretreatment technologies, like pressure swing adsorption (PSA), membrane separation, water-gas shift (WGS), preferential oxidation (PROX), and selective catalytic methanation, are reviewed and compared. PROX shows advantages for extensive applications. For low concentrations impurities, in-situ technologies operating on PEM fuel cells are preferred, which are oxidant bleeding (specifically air bleeding), CO-tolerant catalysts, high-temperature PEM fuel cell, and operating condition regulation. Finally, a PEM fuel cell system integrated with onboard steam methanol reforming and PROX is recommended."
5,Impure hydrogen utilization for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells,
6,Sources of impure hydrogen,"2.1 Sources of impure hydrogen Utilization of impure hydrogen reduces the cost of hydrogen and helps to enhance the overall utilization efficiency of other energy systems [48]. Oil refinery [49], chlor-alkali process [50], chlorate industry [51], and coal gasification [52] produce plenty of hydrogen annually. In chlor-alkali processes, electrolysis of sodium chloride produces chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen (Eq. (3)): (3) Anode : Cathode : Overall : 2 Cl - → Cl 2 + 2 e - 2 H 2 O + 2 e - → H 2 + 2 OH - 2 NaCl + 2 H 2 O → electrolysis 2 NaOH + Cl 2 + H 2 It is estimated that the global yield of chlorine is 53 million tons in the chlor-alkali processes in 2010, which produces 1.5-million-ton hydrogen as a by-product. In most cases, industrial by-product hydrogen is discarded or combusted for heat generation [51]. It is estimated that the yield of by-product hydrogen in the chlor-alkali industry can fulfill the demand for 2 million PEM fuel cell electric vehicles in the United States [53], indicating that the industrial by-product hydrogen can be an alternative for the hydrogen supply, as shown in Fig. 4 . Ihonen et al. [54] researched a PEM fuel cell system that operated with low-grade hydrogen from sodium chlorate production processes in an industrial environment. The impurities contained in the low-grade hydrogen are N2, Cl2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4 [54]. Due to the low concentrations, the operating results show no additional irreversible degradation. Verhage et al. [51] studied the reversible voltage decay after short contamination caused by Na+ and CO 3 2 − . Other possible impurities, such as sodium hydroxide, formaldehyde, formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, and hydrochloric acid, are also discussed in Ref. [51]. Concerning the carbon footprint, Hao et al. [47] estimated that vehicles using hydrogen from the by-product of the chlor-alkali industry had much lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the life cycle assessment, compared to hydrogen from water electrolysis based on the current Chinese energy system. Lee et al. [53] concluded that hydrogen produced from chlor-alkali discharged 20–90% lower well-to-gate greenhouse gas, compared to conventional steam methane reforming. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen sources and consumption in China. It is indicated that coke oven gas accounts for the largest share of by-product hydrogen, compared to chlor-alkali processes and small-scale electrolysis. Impure hydrogen from the above sources may have poisoning effects on PEM fuel cells. The effects of impure hydrogen need to be further studied."
7,Effects of impurities on low-temperature PEM fuel cells,"2.2 Effects of impurities on low-temperature PEM fuel cells Common impurity species in hydrogen fuels are carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and ammonia (about 30–90 ppm produced by the reaction of N2 and H2 [56] or exists as a gas tracer [57]). The concentration of carbon monoxide in the reformate gas could be as high as 0.5%–10%. Thus, reformate gas needs to be purified before fed to fuel cells. The purification methods will be introduced in section 3.1. Hydrogen sulfide is also introduced during the process of fossil fuels, which is fatal to fuel cell catalysts even at trace levels [56]. Ammonia has reversible decay effects to fuel cells during short exposure time but irreversible recession during introducing large amounts of NH3 and long exposure time [58]. Carbon dioxide has a diluted effect [59]. Moreover, CO can be generated by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. When 25% of CO2 is contained in the hydrogen, the RWGS reaction can produce 100–200 ppm CO [60], which causes adverse effects [54,61]. Inert gases, such as CH4 and N2, are considered no harm to the fuel cells but only the diluted effect [57,59,62]. Other trace impurities produced during the production of hydrogen as by-products, such as formaldehyde, formic acid, chloromethane, and acetaldehyde, can cause reversible cell performance decay. However, cocktail tests of the above impurities permanently damaged the proton exchange membrane [63]. For fuel cells fed with by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes, the influence of chloride that may occur in the hydrogen fluid needs to be discussed. Li et al. [64] researched the contamination effects of chloride on the performance and durability of fuel cells. Cl2 is reduced into HCl in the presence of H2O and H2. Thus, HCl was used in the tests. A sudden performance loss is observed after HCl injection and becomes severer when the current density and HCl concentrations increase. Whether the performance is recoverable or not is dependent on the concentrations of Cl-. The Cl- adsorption onto the Pt active sites and Pt dissolution caused by chloride complexes result in the decrease of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) [64]. A graphical summary of different impurities effects on PEM fuel cells is shown in Fig. 6 . Research on the effects of the mixtures of impurities (cocktail tests) on the PEM fuel cells is rare. The crucial impurity is carbon monoxide because it is common in hydrogen fuels and noxious to low-temperature PEM fuel cells [67–69]. The adverse effects of carbon monoxide on the performance and durability of PEM fuel cells are discussed below. 2.2.1 Performance deterioration caused by carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide can be absorbed onto the Pt catalyst active sites much easier than hydrogen. Furthermore, CO is difficult to be eliminated from the catalyst [70]. Eqs. (4)–(7) show the competitive adsorption and electrochemical oxidation of CO. A large amount of coverage ratio of CO on the catalyst blocks the adsorption of hydrogen, causing the increase of anode overpotential. Thereupon, the performance of fuel cells decays sharply. (4) CO + Pt ↔ Pt - CO (5) 2 Pt + H 2 ↔ 2 ( Pt - H ) (6) 2 CO + 2 ( Pt - H ) → 2 ( Pt - CO ) + H 2 (7) Pt - CO + H 2 O → Pt + CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - The poisoning effect of CO shows some noteworthy characteristics. The recovery and poisoning processes appear first-order dynamic response based on the mechanisms of adsorption, desorption, and electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen and CO [71,72]. Using pure hydrogen can partially recover the performance, but the recovery takes several times longer than the poisoning process, indicating different time constants in the two processes. Poisoning effects are related to concentrations of CO, the exposure time, operating temperature and pressure, and hydrogen flow rate [60]. With the increase of CO concentrations, exposure time, and hydrogen flow rates, the poisoning effects become more prominent. On the contrary, with the increase of operating temperatures and pressures, the poisoning effects are lessened. 2.2.2 Durability degradation caused by carbon monoxide Even if the poisoning effect of CO is reversible after introducing pure hydrogen [73,74], it is infeasible when utilizing impure hydrogen. Since rapid decay would occur at high CO concentrations, durability tests are often conducted at low CO concentrations. Accumulated CO deactivates the catalyst sites, causing detrimental degradation. Matsuda et al. [75] investigated the adsorption of CO at concentrations around the requirements of ISO 14687-2:2012 standard. It is indicated that CO accumulates on the Pt catalyst sites during the long-term tests. Heterogeneity degradation along the flow channels is observed when the PEM fuel cell stack operates with reformate [76]. Due to the nonuniform coverage of CO, more Ru catalyst dissolves at the anode outlet, and catalysts at cathode outlet degrade more than the cathode inlet [77]. Nevertheless, some researches show mitigation effects under CO contamination. Carbon corrosion at the cathode catalyst layer may be relieved with cycled current conditions in the presence of trace CO [78]. A decrease of reverse proton pumping effect caused by CO can explain the enhancement of PEM fuel cell durability [78,79]."
8,Effects of impurities on high-temperature PEM fuel cells,"2.3 Effects of impurities on high-temperature PEM fuel cells High-temperature PEM fuel cells usually operate between 100 and 200 °C [80,81], which makes it possible to be fed with reformate gas directly. Boaventura et al. [82] studied the effects of CO2 and methanol on the HT-PEMFC when 25% of CO2 and 10% of methanol exist in the reformate gas. Methanol poisoning increases anodic resistance. Water decreases the charge transfer resistance. The RWGS reaction in the presence of CO2 has a neglectable effect due to strong electro-oxidation under high temperatures. Dilution effects caused by the large amount of CO2 cannot be ignored, which is adverse to mass transport [83]. Simulation results by Jiao et al. [81] showed that high-temperature PEM fuel cells had a significant improvement in CO tolerance because CO has a weaker affinity to the catalyst at higher temperatures. The improvement is more apparent with the increase in operating temperatures, as shown in Fig. 7 ."
9,Key technologies for processing impure hydrogen applied to PEM fuel cell systems,"Most of the hydrogen worldwide is produced from fossil fuels, like natural gas and coals [42,84]. Methanol steam reforming can be a candidate for the onboard hydrogen source. Due to the reversibility of the reactions, many impurities that are deleterious for fuel cells are generated, like carbon monoxide and sulfide. PEM fuel cells cannot utilize hydrogen that contains high concentrations of these impurities directly. For example, carbon monoxide should be eliminated to below 10 ppm, especially [7,9,85]. Measures should be taken to handle impure hydrogen for PEM fuel cells. There are two directions for fuel cells utilizing impure hydrogen. The first way is to eliminate the impurities before fed to fuel cells. The second one is to improve the impurity tolerance of fuel cells."
10,Hydrogen purification technologies,"3.1 Hydrogen purification technologies 3.1.1 Pressure swing adsorption Pressure swing adsorption is a mature technology for sizeable industrial-scale purification or gas separation. Different impurities have different affinities to specific adsorbents at high or low pressure. With the swing of pressure, the impurities are absorbed or regenerated. PSA often contains several beds, so the absorption and regeneration stages can operate simultaneously. Grande et al. [86,87] described the process of PSA in detail. Adsorbents are vital for PSA. Materials, such as zeolite [88], activated carbon [89], and CuBTC [90], are often used as adsorbents. For hydrogen purification from reformate gas that contains different impurities, multiple layers of adsorbents should be used. The sequences of the layers need to be considered carefully, as summarized in Table 2 . For example, zeolite needs to be placed after water and CO2 are adsorbed because it is sensitive to those molecules [91]. Although PSA can obtain high pure hydrogen, there are some disadvantages. High purity requirement results in low recovery of hydrogen. Jang et al. [92] reported that the recovery of H2 purified by PSA is around 75–90%. 3.1.2 Membrane separation Membrane separation is attractive because of its low cost and energy consumption [93]. Several membrane separation technologies are summarized, as showed in Table 3 . The palladium membrane has been extensively researched. Palladium can selectively adsorb hydrogen, forming palladium hydride (PdHx). Hydrogen is then regenerated on the other side of the membrane. Palladium membrane can attain high purity up to 99.99999%. High temperatures and pressures are needed for palladium membrane purification to enhance CO and H2S tolerance and avoid hydrogen embrittlement [94]. 3.1.3 Water-gas shift Steam reforming of fossil fuels generates a large amount of CO. Through water gas shift reaction (Eq. (8)), the concentration of carbon monoxide can be reduced from 10% to 0.5% [95]. WGS conduces to improve hydrogen yield [96]. (8) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 WGS usually proceeds with two stages: HT-WGS and LT-WGS. At high temperatures, the WGS reaction has high thermal kinetics. While at low temperatures, the reaction is slow but achieves high conversion due to the thermal equilibrium [3]. The intervals of reaction temperature for the HT-WGS and LT-WGS are approximately 350–500 °C and 150–250 °C, respectively [97]. Roh et al. [98] reported a single-stage WGS using Pt/CeO2 catalyst, which obtained excellent conversion and selectivity. Since WGS could not attain fuel cell-grade hydrogen [99], it often services as pretreatment for reformate gas. 3.1.4 Preferential oxidation Preferential oxidation is a crucial method to eliminate CO from hydrogen-rich gas. With high selectivity PROX catalysts, introducing some air/oxygen into the reformate gas can remove CO from 0.5% to 10 ppm [102]. With the advantages of no critical requirements for the reaction temperature and pressure, simple apparatus, and low cost, PROX is expected for onboard hydrogen purification for vehicle and stationary fuel cell applications. The conversion (X) and selectivity (S) can quantify the performance of PROX catalysts, which are defined as following Eqs. (9–11), where c in, c out represent the concentration at the inlet and outlet of the reactors, respectively. (9) X CO = c CO in - c CO out c CO in ⋅ 100 % (10) X O 2 = c O 2 in - c O 2 out c O 2 in ⋅ 100 % (11) S CO = c CO in - c CO out 2 ( c O 2 in - c O 2 out ) ⋅ 100 % Maciel et al. [103] compared the conversion of CO using CuO/CeO2 catalysts prepared by deposition–precipitation (DEP) and co-precipitation (COP) methods and discussed the influence of metal content. López et al. [104] compared the activity and stability of several copper-based catalysts and pointed out that chelating methods were suitable for the preparation of copper-based PROX catalysts. Laguna et al. [105] studied the addition of Au as a supporter of CuOx/CeO2. The results show that Au can facilitate the adsorption of CO, which promotes the low temperature activity of the catalyst. The study of Maciel et al. [106] reveals that ceria can enhance the interaction between ceria and supported metal. Other catalysts also used for PROX, such as Pt/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3 (addition of Fe, Co) [107], Au/Al2O3 [108], Au1/CeO2 [109], Fe1(OH)x–Pt/SiO2 [110], Pt1/FeOx [111], MOX/CeO2-CuO (M = Fe, Co and Ni) [112]. Among the PROX catalysts mentioned above, CuO/CeO2 shows the most potential for the low cost and satisfying performance. The effects of H2O and CO2 are critical to high conversion and selectivity for PROX catalysts. However, there are controversial results for the effects of H2O. Ilieva et al. [113] studied the performance of the AuCeFeMA catalyst with/without H2O and CO2, indicating that H2O adsorption blocks the activity sites. On the contrary, CO oxidation promotion induced by H2O was observed in the studies of Ref. [114]. Duan et al. [115] also found that H2O can promote O2 dissociation and carbonate decomposition. CO2 hinders the process of CO adsorption and reacts with H2 through reverse water-gas shift [113]. Improvement of low-temperature activity benefits the rapid cold start of PROX reactors. Yen et al. [116] reported tailored mesostructured copper/ceria catalysts that have well low-temperature performance. Promoters are essential for the platinum group metal catalysts to improve low-temperature activity. Frequently-used promoters could be classified into bi-metal (alloy catalysts), reducible metal oxides, alkali metal cations, and the second noble metal component [117]. 3.1.5 Selective catalytic methanation Selective catalytic methanation removes CO from reformate gas through reactions as follows (Eqs. 12 and 13): (12) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O (13) CO + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Side reactions may occur when there exists plenty of CO2: (14) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O (15) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O Types of catalysts for selective catalytic methanation can be classified into Ni-based and Ru-based. Ni-based catalysts have comparable performance with Ru-based catalysts but cheaper than Ru-based catalysts, which raises the great interest of Ni-based catalysts studies [85]. Alihosseinzadeh et al. [85] extensively studied the effects of Ni contents, space velocity, CO2 and H2O, and CO:H2 ratio on the performance and stability of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, which indicates the research directions for selective catalytic methanation. Zhang et al. [118] prepared the catalysts Ni/ZrO2. Smaller ZrO2 crystallites had better NiO and Ni dispersion results with the precipitation method [119]. Catalysts 3.0Ni/ZrO2 prepared by the co-precipitation method attained below 10 ppm CO during the 100 h tests at 220 °C. Selective catalytic methanation can provide high conversion of CO, removing CO to a level below 10 ppm over a wide temperature window [120]. However, for selective CO methanation catalysts, activity at low temperatures should be enhanced, and side reactions should be suppressed [121]. 3.1.6 Summary Pressure Swing Adsorption is often used for mass production of hydrogen due to the huge volume so it is suitable for the purification of industrial by-product hydrogen. Pd membrane separation has problems of durability and cost. For fuel cell applications, PROX has great potential to be a candidate for hydrogen purification, although lots of technical problems need to be solved. Here give frequently-used catalysts for PROX, catalytic methanation, and WGS in Table 4 ."
11,CO-tolerant PEM fuel cells,"3.2 CO-tolerant PEM fuel cells It is prone to modify the PEM fuel cell systems as few as possible. Enhancing the CO tolerance of PEM fuel cells by oxidant bleeding, modifying the anode catalysts, using high-temperature PEM fuel cells, and optimizing operating conditions would work to some extent. 3.2.1 Oxidant bleeding Feeding the PEM fuel cell with a mixture of impure hydrogen and little oxidant has excellent potential to mitigate the poisoning effects [122–124]. When using air or oxygen as the oxidant, it is called air bleeding. The oxidants could also be hydrogen peroxide. Sung et al. [125] studied the effects of CO poisoning and air bleeding comprehensively. Applying air bleeding technology needs precise control of the amount of air in order to avoid adverse effects [126,127]. Different air bleeding methods have been discussed in Ref. [134]. The mechanisms of CO poisoning and air bleeding have been widely studied. Researchers often model the poisoning effects of CO and the recovery effects of air bleeding to obtain the relationship between the amount of air bleeding and the concentration of CO, as shown in Fig. 8 [135,136]. Many optimization methodologies have been proposed [137]. However, air bleeding causes the membrane and catalyst layer degradation [138], which can be explained as follows. Hydrogen peroxide is generated by the reaction between Pt-H and oxygen (Eq. (16)). In the presence of Fe2+ or Cu2+ ions, hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed to form · OH and · OOH radicals (Eq. (17)) [138]. M2+ can be Fe2+ or Cu2+. (16) Pt - H + O 2 → Pt + · OOH Pt - H + · OOH → Pt + H 2 O 2 (17) M 2 + + H 2 O 2 → M 3 + + · OH + OH - H 2 O 2 + · OH → · OOH + H 2 O Further studies on the effects of air bleeding on the PEM fuel cell durability need to be conducted. 3.2.2 CO-tolerant catalyst layers Pt-Ru catalysts are conventional alloy catalysts for the CO-tolerant improvement [139,140], even though the concentrations of CO should be limited at low levels to avoid the fuel cell voltage shut-down [141,142]. The bifunctional mechanism of Ru alloy is that water dissociates at low potential (0.2–0.3 V) at the anode, and CO is oxidized by OHads on the Ru catalysts [143], as showed in Eq. (18) (M is Ru). Pereira et al. [144] compared several bimetallic catalysts (PtRu/C, PtFe/C, PtMo/C, PtW/C, compared to Pt/C) in the presence of 100 CO in H2, and confirmed three CO-tolerance mechanisms. Firstly, all the bimetallic catalysts show a bifunctional mechanism. For PtFe/C, the electronic mechanism contributes to the increase of CO tolerance. Furthermore, a chemical reaction that is speculated to be the water-gas shift reaction occurs on the PtRu/C and PtMo/C catalysts. (18) M + H 2 O → M - OH ads + H + + e - Pt - CO ads + M - OH ads → Pt + M + CO 2 + H + + e - Ehteshami et al. [145] compared several binary and ternary catalysts in the single-cell tests, showing some extraordinary CO-tolerance anode catalysts, as shown in Fig. 9 . A lot of novel catalysts are deployed to enhance the CO tolerance of PEM fuel cells. MoOx@Pt core-shell catalysts were developed by Hu et al. [146] to reduce the precious metal loading. However, PtMo alloy catalyst has less voltage drop when 100 ppm CO contained in H2, compared to MoOx@Pt core-shell catalyst and PtRu catalyst. The main obstacle for the PtMo alloy catalyst is the stability caused by Mo migration across the PEM membrane [146–148]. PtCo/C shows remarkable CO-tolerant and high hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity in the meantime in acid solution [149]. Furthermore, Shi et al. [150] compared three novel catalysts alloyed with non-precious metal, Pt2AL-Pt−M/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni), demonstrating that Pt2AL-Pt−Fe/C reveals highest CO tolerance. Ru@TiO2 can block the CO adsorption, leading to an extraordinary CO tolerance in H2/1000 ppm CO [46]. Other novel catalysts also show great potential to be candidates for CO-tolerant catalyst materials, like Pt/C catalyst impregnated with WOx [151], PtCu single-atom alloy catalyst [152], AuPt-prGO catalyst [153]. One can also draw lessons from anode catalysts for DMFCs because the CO poisoning effect is an inherent problem when methanol is dehydrogenated [143,154]. Gong et al. [143] discussed single Pt atom catalyst, Pt-based catalyst, and non-platinum catalyst for anode methanol oxidation and indicated that high-performance catalysts should have high dispersion and small particle size. Besides, there are often trade-offs among performance, durability, cost, and stability. For commercial applications, mass production requires careful consideration of catalyst synthesis methods. The tolerance of CO in PEM fuel cells using Pt-Ru catalysts can be 50–100 ppm [69]. When the concentration of CO is higher than 500 ppm, the Pt-Ru catalysts loss its competence [150]. So, applying CO-tolerant catalysts has the condition that inlet hydrogen contains limited CO. High-performance catalysts need to be further developed to evaluate the performance at MEA or fuel cell levels. 3.2.3 High-temperature PEM fuel cell Catalysts of fuel cells have higher carbon monoxide tolerance operating at high temperatures than at low temperatures. Thus, reformate gas could be fed to HT-PEMFC directly [155]. Yan et al. [156] compared the effects of operating temperatures, the concentration of hydrogen or CO on the performance of a PBI/H3PO4 PEM fuel cells. It is concluded that operating at high temperatures weakens the adsorption of CO and facilitates the oxidation of CO [157]. HT-PEMFC can tolerate up to 5% CO [155], as shown in Fig. 10 . With high tolerance of CO, it is convenient to integrate the steam methanol reforming reactor with the high-temperature PEM fuel cells [80,158,159]. They both have approaching operating temperatures, which benefits thermal management. For high-temperature PEM fuel cells, the phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane is used extensively [160–162], while phosphoric acid leaching and the performance of the membrane remain to be the most concerning problems in the material area [163,164]. 3.2.4 Regulation of operating conditions Regulation of operating conditions can enhance the tolerance of CO [165]. Due to the weaker CO adsorption under higher temperatures than lower temperatures, increasing of operating temperatures is an effective method to enhance the CO tolerance, especially for high-temperature PEM fuel cells [166]. For low-temperature PEM fuel cells, the proton exchange membrane is unstable under high temperatures, which would lead to membrane failure and durability issues. Qi et al. [167] explained the cathode poisoning phenomenon caused by the anode CO and found that fully humidified membranes would fill the pin-holes with water, thus hinder the crossover of CO. Permeated oxygen from the cathode side can alleviate low concentrations CO poisoning [75], which is called internal air bleeding [123]. Therefore, maintaining a pressure difference helps oxygen diffusion from the cathode side to the anode side. However, this method accelerates the membrane degradation caused by mechanical stress."
12,The PEM fuel cell system integrated with onboard steam methanol reforming and PROX,"3.3 The PEM fuel cell system integrated with onboard steam methanol reforming and PROX As discussed before, onboard reforming solves the problem of hydrogen production and storage. However, reforming of carbon-containing fuel introduces a large amount of CO that is fatal to the Pt catalyst. Therefore, the pretreatment of reformate gas is necessary to eliminate the CO. In general, the concentration of CO in the reformate gas after the WGS reaction is as high as 0.5–1%. PROX is a suitable method to reduce the concentration of CO to acceptable levels. Air bleeding or CO-tolerant catalysts can enhance the tolerance of PEM fuel cells to the CO and avoid the RWGS reaction. Appropriate methods can reduce cost and system complexity. Here a PEM fuel cell system with onboard steam methanol reforming and PROX is introduced. In terms of operating temperatures of PEM fuel cells, there are two schemes, the high temperature one or the low temperature one. Herdem et al. [22] reviewed methanol reforming fuel cell systems and compared the advantages and disadvantages of HT-PEMFC and LT-PEMFC systems. For high-temperature PEM fuel cells, as introduced in section 3.2.3, the purification process can be omitted, making the system small and straightforward. Ribeirinha et al. [168] researched the heat integration of the MSR reactor and HT-PEMFC. They further studied the simulation and tested on a high-temperature PEM fuel cell system combined with a methanol steam reforming reactor, considering reforming reaction, WGS, and CO poisoning effect [80]. However, with high operating temperatures, the long cold start time makes it not applicable in some situations, like passenger vehicles. Conversely, commercial vehicles that have lower demand for cold start and volume are suitable for the high-temperature PEM fuel cell system. The low-temperature PEM fuel cell system that is integrated with onboard steam methanol reforming and PROX has significant advantages in four aspects: (1) Methanol is liquid at room temperature and ambient pressure, which is convenient for light and compact storage and efficient distribution. (2) High power density, compared to DMFCs. (3) Rapid start-up, compared to high-temperature PEM fuel cells. (4) Low pollution, low emission, and renewable energy, compared to traditional internal combustion engines. Dolanc et al. [169] fabricated a 100 W portable fuel cell system integrated with methanol reformer and PROX. Calculated specific energy was 374 Wh/kg. Wang et al. [170] designed a methanol-reforming fuel cell system with an output power of 3 kW. The system is developed at portable levels, while system efficiency needs to be further improved [171]."
13,Conclusion and outlook,"International organization for standardization (ISO) limits the concentration of impurities in hydrogen for road vehicle applications. However, few feasible hydrogen production methods meet these requirements except water electrolysis. Up to now, using water electrolysis to produce hydrogen produces more GHG emissions than other hydrogen production methods based on the Chinese energy structure, provided that much electricity is generated by coal. The cost and durability of electrolyzers and the hydrogen infrastructure need to be improved in the future. PSA is a mature technology to produce massive hydrogen while it is not applicable for applications that have high requirements of volume and weight. Methanol, as a liquid hydrogen carrier, shows the advantages of storage and low-temperature reforming. Vehicles can carry methanol tanks instead of high-pressure hydrogen tanks. Impure hydrogen from industrial processes, like chlor-alkali industry and steam methanol reforming, introduces impurities that are harmful to PEM fuel cells. For hydrogen that contains less than 100 ppm CO, CO-tolerant catalysts and air bleeding show the most possibility to enhance the output power of low-temperature PEM fuel cells. However, it is inevitable to apply pretreatment purification technologies to lower the CO contents in the first step if the concentrations of CO in the hydrogen exceed 1000 ppm, which will increase the investment of additional purification equipment, enlarge the system volume and mass, and need to develop precise control systems. Materials are vital for hydrogen energy and PEM fuel cells. For hydrogen storage, high-pressure containers and metal hydride are research hotspots. Safe and efficient storage is the dominating challenge. For hydrogen purification, adsorbent materials deployed in pressure swing adsorption play an important role in high pure hydrogen recovery. Downsizing of preferential oxidation or selective catalytic methanation reactors depends on high active catalysts. Researches have focused on the low-temperature activity, carbon dioxide and water-tolerance, wide operating windows, effects of promoters, stability, and durability of the catalysts. For polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, CO-tolerant catalysts are favored because of little need to modify the power system. High-temperature PEM fuel cells can tolerate high carbon monoxide content. However, performance and durability rely on the further improvement of membrane and electrolyte materials. Middle-temperature PEM fuel cells in which phosphoric acid is replaced with ionic liquid combine the advantages of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM fuel cells, showing great potential in the utilization of impure hydrogen."
