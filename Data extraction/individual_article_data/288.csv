0,Introduction,"In recent years, enantiometrically pure compounds including amino acids, organic acids, amines, alcohols, epoxides and so on, have been produced with the use of biocatalysts, because such methods are superior to general chemical methods in terms of enantioselectivity. 1 Among them, secondary alcohols are the most important chiral synthons for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Chiral metal complexes such as BINAP-Ru have been successfully used as catalysts in a number of cases of asymmetric reduction processes, and industrially applied for the synthesis of (−)-menthol and other terpenic substances. 2 However, in the case of ketone reductions, difficulties remain in the operation, and in obtaining sufficient enantiomeric excess and productivity. 2,3 An alternative to the chemical asymmetric reduction processes is a biocatalytic transformation system using enzymes or microorganisms. 4 Until now, many examples of the reduction of ketones with reductases and dehydrogenases have been described. 4,5 Oxidoreductases including NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from yeast, horse liver, 4 Candida parapsilosis 6,7 and Pseudomonas sp., 8 and NADP+-dependent ADHs from Thermoanaerobium brochii 9 and Lactobacillus kefir, 10,11 aldehyde reductase from Sporobolomyces salmonicolor (EC 1.1.1.2), 12 and carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) from Candida magnoliae 13 have been used for this purpose. However, in many cases, they have the disadvantages of a narrow substrate specificity, insufficient stereoselectivity or low chemotolerancy to ketone substrates and organic solvents. In addition, regenerating NAD(P)H is necessary to efficiently continue the bioreduction process. Therefore, such bioreduction processes are only economical when the cofactor can be regenerated in situ in a second catalytic cycle, for example, formate/formate dehydrogenase (FDH) or glucose/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). 14 From the viewpoint of the regeneration of NAD(P)H, 2-propanol is another suitable hydrogen donor for bioreduction because of its chemical properties and low cost. 6–9,15–17 Recently, Itoh et al. reported that phenylacetaldehyde reductase (PAR) from the styrene-assimilating Rhodococcus (former Corynebacterium) sp. strain ST-10 is a unique NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with a broad substrate range and high enantioselectivity to give (S)-alcohols from various carbonyl compounds without an additional coenzyme regeneration system, because the enzyme itself is able to regenerate NADH in the presence of 2-propanol. 17–21 Therefore, such a system is regarded as a superior asymmetric hydrogen-transfer reduction process. Recently, another chemotolerant ADH is reported in a R. ruber DSM44541 strain. 16 However, PAR can hardly transform phenyl trifluoromethyl ketone (PTK) 13 to (R)- or (S)-1-phenyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (PTE) 40, which would be a potential chiral synthon for liquid crystals. In a previous study, we described the screening of a microorganism (Leifsonia sp. strain S749), which can reduce PTK 13 to (S)-PTE 40, the purification of the corresponding ADH (LSADH: Leifsonia ADH), and the characterization of the enzyme. 22 Herein, we report the application of LSADH for the production of (R)-chiral alcohols from ketones including acetophenone derivatives, 2-alkanones and keto esters with a high enantioselectivity, and evaluate LSADH as an asymmetric hydrogen-transfer biocatalyst using 2-propanol."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Substrate spectrum and stereoselectivity of LSADH for various ketones,"2.1 Substrate spectrum and stereoselectivity of LSADH for various ketones As previously described, LSADH is a novel NADH-dependent ADH with a broad substrate range. 22 The enzyme is highly active toward medium-chain normal aldehydes and 2-alkanones between C5 and C8, and various aryl aldehydes and acetophenone derivatives, although it barely acts on short-chain normal alkyl aldehydes and 2-alkanones, and cycloalkanones. With the LSADH reactions, acetophenone 12, PTK 13 and 2-heptanone 3 are converted to (R)-1-phenylethanol 39 (99% ee), (S)-PTE 40 (>99% ee) and (R)-2-heptanol 30 (>99% ee) in the presence of 2-propanol. Therefore, LSADH was thought to be a suitable biocatalyst for producing the (R)-form chiral alcohols. 22 We further explored the substrate specificity and stereoselectivity of LSADH for various ketones. The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. It was found that LSADH was able to catalyze the reduction of not only ketones but also α-keto and β-keto esters. Until now, LSADH has been found to catalyze the reduction of more than 40 ketones, indicating a quite broad substrate spectrum. The data concerning the stereoselectivities for the substrates clarified that LSADH produced (R)-alcohols 39, 41–44, 47–52 from acetophenone or arylketone derivatives 12, 14–17, 20–25 and (R)-alkanols 28–30 from 2-alkanones 1–3, and (S)-halohydrins 37, 38, 45, 46, 53 from 4-halo-3-oxobutanoate derivatives 10, 11, 2-chloroacetophenone (phenacyl chloride) derivatives 18, 19 and chloromethyl 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl ketone 26 with an enantiomeric excess of more than 98%, except from 2,4-dicholoroacetophenone 20 (R-form, 79% ee), methyl benzoylformate 6 [(R)-form, 47% ee], ethyl benzoylformate 7 (R-form, 23% ee) and ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutanoate 8 [(S)-form, 85% ee]. This suggested that the stereoselectivity of LSADH strictly follows the anti-Prelog’s rule. 23 Interestingly, it was observed that substrates with weak reactivity for LSADH such as methyl or ethyl benzoylformate 6, 7 ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutanoate 8 and 2,4-dicholoroacetophenone 20 gave low enantiomeric excesses for the alcohols produced. Although the reaction system was not optimized for each substrate, conversions of 19 ketones out of a total of 27 tested reached more than 80%, and low conversion was only limited to the substrates to which LSADH showed a weak reactivity (less than 4% compared with PTK) such as methyl or ethyl benzoylformate 6, 7 and 2,4-dicholoroacetophenone 20, propiophenone 23 and 1-N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone 27 (Tables 2 and 3 ). The results clearly indicated that the LSADH can function as a biocatalyst to transfer hydrogen from 2-propanol to various ketones through a smooth NADH-regeneration to give enantiomerically pure (R)-alcohols with a practical level."
3,Stereochemistry of LSADH,"2.2 Stereochemistry of LSADH In order to elucidate the stereochemistry with respect to NADH, the LSADH-catalyzing transfer of deutride (D) or hydride from the D-labelled NADH at the pro-R position (NADD) was determined. NADD was obtained with the reaction of yeast ADH and CH3CD2OH as described in the Experimental. 1H NMR and GC–MS analyses of the PTE produced by LSADH with the NADD gave the same profiles as those of authentic PTE 40; 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 4.99–5.04 (1H, m), 7.36–7.56 (5H, m, ArH), GC–EI-MS m/z (M+ 176 for C8H7OF3) 137, 127, 107, 79, 51. These results indicated that the C-2 hydrogen of PTE was not replaced with D through LSADH reduction, in other words, the pro-S hydrogen of NADD is transferred to the re face of the carbonyl of PTK 13 (si face in the case of acetophenone 12), as illustrated in Figure 2 . The result together with those of the section above indicated that the stereochemistry of LSADH was the same as that of Mucor javanicus ADH, and different from that of the (R)-alcohol-producing ADH from Pseudomonas or Lactobacillus. 4"
4,Optimized conditions for LSADH-catalyzed production of (S)-PTE 40,"2.3 Optimized conditions for LSADH-catalyzed production of (S)-PTE 40 To improve the LSADH reduction system using 2-propanol as a hydrogen donor, reaction conditions were optimized using PTK 13 as a representative substrate (100mg/ml: 574mM, suspended in the reaction mixture). With regard to the concentration of 2-propanol in the reaction mixture, the optimal concentration was between 5% (v/v) (0.65M) and 10% (1.3M), and production of (S)-PTE 40 was inhibited at above 15% 2-propanol concentration (Fig. 3 a). This suggested that more than 15% (v/v) 2-propanol in the reaction mixture probably inhibited the LSADH reaction or denatured the LSADH. The optimal NAD+ concentration in the reaction mixture was measured. As shown in Figure 3b, a sufficient conversion was observed at an initial NAD+ concentration of more than 0.8mM. Considering the K m value of NAD+ for 2-propanol oxidation (0.12mM), 22 this observation seemed reasonable. The effect of pH on the reaction was also measured. As shown in Figure 3c, the optimal pH was between 7 and 8."
5,Time course of the production of (S)-PTE 40,"2.4 Time course of the production of (S)-PTE 40 Under the optimized conditions (10% 2-propanol, 1mM NAD+ and pH7.0), the time course of (S)-PTE 40 production was tested with a high concentration of PTK 13 (100mg/ml: 574mM) (Fig. 4 ). During the reaction, part of the NAD+ was rapidly reduced into NADH, after which NAD+ and NADH concentrations were maintained at 0.94–0.98mM and 0.03–0.09mM, respectively. The concentration of NAD+ was eight times higher than the K m value for NAD+ (0.12mM), whereas that of NADH was almost equal to the K m value for NADH (0.048mM). 22 A similar phenomenon was reported in the bioreduction of 2,3′-dichloroacetophenone 19 by PAR with 2-propanol. 17 The result including the case of PAR suggested that the reaction rate was kinetically controlled by the enzyme itself in both cases. Throughout the reaction, an almost equimolar production of (S)-PTE 40 and acetone with a decrease in PTK 13 and 2-propanol was observed in the range of measurement error. The observed reaction rate constant (k cat) for the reduction of PTK 13 calculated from the initial velocity in Figure 4 was approximately 30s−1, therefore, the overall reaction rate constant including the oxidation of 2-propanol should double this (60s−1). The value was comparable with that for PTK reduction (140s−1) and 2-propanol oxidation (47s−1) reported for LSADH. 22 Although, the 2-propanol used for NADH regeneration seemed to compete for the active site of the enzyme with the ketone substrate and lower the turnover for the desired reaction, LSADH-catalyzed hydrogen-transfer reduction proceeded efficiently from the viewpoint of the regeneration and utilization of NADH. After 35h, (S)-PTE 40 was obtained at 79% conversion (ca. 450mM in the reaction mixture: 79mg/ml) with >99% ee When the amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixture was increased by twice, (S)-PTE 40 was obtained at 99% conversion (ca. 570mM in the reaction mixture: 99mg/ml). The high accumulation of the product with a near perfect enantiomeric purity showed the potential of the LSADH bioreduction system for practical usage. The productivity could be improved further by using a larger amount of enzyme or recombinant E. coli cells expressing the LSADH gene, feeding of 2-propanol, elimination of the acetone produced under reduced pressure, and adoption of the solvent–water two-phase system and so on."
6,Conclusion,LSADH catalyzed the enantioselective reduction of ketones with high conversion and enantiomeric purity to give (R)-form alcohols. The stereochemistry of LSADH has been found to use the pro-S hydrogen of NADH. This bioreduction process would be industrially applicable to the production of enantiomerically pure alcohols because it can effectively regenerate NADH by itself by transferring hydrogen from 2-propanol to reduce the aimed ketones.
7,Experimental,
8,Preparation of LSADH and enzyme assay,"4.1 Preparation of LSADH and enzyme assay LSADH was obtained from Leifsonia sp. S749 cells as reported previously. 22 A partially purified enzyme preparation produced by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential Butyl-Toyopearl and Bioassist Q column chromatographies was used throughout the experiments. LSADH activity was assayed at 25°C by measuring the decrease in absorption at 340nm of NADH as described previously. 22 One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount that converted 1μmol NADH and PTK 13 in 1min. The substrate specificity of LSADH was measured spectrophotometrically by decreasing the absorption of NADH at 340nm using the purified enzyme and various ketones at 2mM, unless otherwise indicated, and their relative activity was compared with PTK 13 as 100%."
9,LSADH-catalyzed reduction coupled to NADH regeneration with 2-propanol,"4.2 LSADH-catalyzed reduction coupled to NADH regeneration with 2-propanol For determining the enantiomeric purity of the products and assessing the coupling of NADH regeneration, we constructed the LSADH and 2-propanol system (Fig. 1 ). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.5mmol KPB (pH7.0), 50mg of each substrate 1–27, 5μmol NAD+, 5% (v/v) 2-propanol and 5unit of purified LSADH in a total volume of 5ml, and was suspended in a 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube with shaking (300rpm) for 24h at 25°C. After the reaction, the mixture was extracted twice with 7.5ml of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were dried over Na2SO4, purified by silica gel (1.5×30cm) chromatography using n-hexane and ethyl acetate (3:1) as an eluent. The fractions were condensed by evaporation, and analyzed by GC or HPLC. The purified product was also analyzed by 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference, and GC-electron ionization (EI)-mass spectrometry (MS) (GC–EI-MS) (QP-5000 GC–MS, Shimadzu): column DB-1 (0.25mm×60m, J&W Scientific, CA, USA); flow rate at a linear velocity of 35cm/min of He; the split ratio of 50; injection and detection temperature of 250°C; column temperature 40°C for 5min then raised to 250°C at 10°C/min and held at 250°C for 5min. General GC was performed using a Shimadzu GC-18A system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column (DB-1, 0.25mm×30m, J&W Scientific, CA, USA) with an FID (flame ionization detector) with a flow rate of 1ml/min of He and the split ratio of 60 under the conditions described in Table 1 . GC was also performed using a Shimadzu GC-14 A system equipped with a coiled column (3mm×2m) packed with Thermon 1000 (5% on Chromosorb W) with an FID and a flow rate of 50ml/min of N2. The conversions were determined on the basis of the peak areas of ketone substrates and alcohol products from the GC. To determine the absolute configuration and conversions of some alcohols, the products 31, 39–46, 50 and 51, extracted with ethyl acetate from the reaction mixture, were analyzed using GC (HP 6890 GC system, Hewlett Packard, USA) with a CP-cyclodextrin-β-236-N19 chiral column (0.25mm by 25m, 0.25μm film, Chrompack, The Netherlands) and a FID. Helium gas was used as a carrier at 15psi (0.5ml/min), and the split ratio was 50. Details of the measuring conditions are summarized in Table 1. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the 2-alkanols 28–30, they were converted into benzoyl derivatives with benzoyl chloride and analyzed by HPLC with a chiral column, as previously reported. 19 Analytical HPLC was performed with a Shimadzu LC-10AT system equipped with a Chiralcel OB-H (4.6×250mm, Daicel Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase was hexane/2-propanol (49:1) and delivered at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min (Table 1). For determining the absolute configuration of the alcohols 32–38, 47–49 and 52–54, they were purified by silica gel chromatography as described above, and analyzed by HPLC with a chiral column. Analytical HPLC was performed with a Shimadzu LC-10AT system using a Chiralcel OB-H, OD-H or OF (4.6×250mm, Daicel Chemical Industries) under the conditions described in Table 1."

The reaction proceeded at 25°C for 48h. The PTE 40 produced was purified by extraction with ethyl acetate from the mixture and analyzed by 1H NMR and GC–EI-MS."
11,Optimization of production of (S)-PTE 40,"4.4 Optimization of production of (S)-PTE 40 In order to determine the 2-propanol and acetone concentrations in the reaction mixture, GC was performed using a Shimadzu GC-14 A system equipped with a coiled column (3mm×2m) packed with Thermon 1000 (5% on Chromosorb W) with an FID, column temperature of 30°C, injection temperature of 100°C, detection temperature of 150°C and a flow rate of 50ml/min of N2; retention times (min): 2-propanol, 4.4min; acetone, 2.3min. The NAD+ and NADH concentrations in the reaction mixture were also determined by HPLC as previously described. 17 The reaction mixture’s composition is mentioned in the legend of Figure 3, and the reaction was performed in a 2-ml polypropylene tube in a BioShakar MBR-022 (Taitec, Saitama, Japan) with shaking (700rpm) for 24h at 25°C."
