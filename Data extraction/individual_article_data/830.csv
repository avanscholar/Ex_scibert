0,Introduction,"Alcohol distillery wastewater treatment is a difficult problem that many countries have faced with. Due to the high concentration of organics, alcohol distillery wastewater can lead to not only environmental pollution but also resource wastes if no effective treatments are executed. Thus, a resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater is critical Yang et al. (2015). Several methods for resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater have been developed, which can be categorized into biological production (Kim et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2015), methane production Rodriguez et al. (2013), electricity generation (Ha et al., 2012; Quan et al., 2014). However, biological products from alcohol distillery wastewater have less application value; Methane produced by anaerobic fermentation usually requires long retention time; Electricity generation from alcohol distillery wastewater is generally limited by the cost and practicality of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In recent years, hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater has been investigated by biological methods. Chavadej et al. (Intanoo et al., 2012, 2014; Searmsirimongkol et al., 2011) used an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) to produce hydrogen from alcohol wastewater, obtaining hydrogen percentage concentration of 40% and hydrogen yield of 125mLH2/gCOD removed. Silva et al. Lazaro et al. (2015) combined sequential fermentative and phototrophic system for hydrogen production, which achieved COD removal of 70.3% and hydrogen yield of 123mLH2/g COD removed in an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR). Poontaweegeratigarn et al. (2012) studied biohydrogen production by dark fermentation from alcohol wastewater using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB). Under the optimum COD loading rate of 46kg/m3 d, it provided the hydrogen percentage concentration of 27%, hydrogen yield of 125.1mLH2/g COD removed, hydrogen flow rate of 12.5mL/min, and COD removal of 24%. Yu et al. (2002) investigated hydrogen production from rice winery wastewater in an upflow anaerobic reactor (UAR), obtaining hydrogen percentage concentration of 53–61%. Wicher et al. (2013) researched hydrogen production from distillery wastewater in batch dark fermentation process (BDFP). The experimental results showed that percentage concentration and flow rate of hydrogen can reach 62%, 2mL/min respectively. Hydrogen, as a renewable energy source, has been treated as a substitute for fossil fuels owing to its advantages including high calorific value, light weight, non-toxicity, and no pollution emissions (Kim and Kim, 2011; Lin et al., 2014; Srirangan et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). Hydrogen produced from alcohol distillery wastewater is a good idea, which conforms to the notion of turning the waste into treasure. However, considering the toxicity of high-concentration salt and the low biodegradability Searmsirimongkol et al. (2011), biological methods have many limitations. Therefore, an effective method to realize a resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater is eagerly needed. Pulsed discharge in liquid (PDL) combines with the advantages of pulsed discharge and liquid phase discharge, which can generate non-equilibrium plasma with high peak current density and large area Xin et al. (2016a). PDL has already been applied in hydrogen production (Xin et al., 2016a,b,c; Zhang and Cha, 2015) and wastewater treatment (Banaschik et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2000, 2011; Yang et al., 2010), which obtained many great achievements. Xin et al. (2016c) researched pulsed spark discharge in ethanol solution for hydrogen production. With the optimization of the plasma reactor, the energy consumption has been reduced to about 0.48kWh/m3 H2. Zhang and Cha (2015) investigated hydrogen production from hydrocarbons by pulsed corona discharge, obtaining hydrogen flow rate of 4.3mL/min. Sun et al. (2000) studied pulsed corona and spark discharge in aqueous solution for phenol degradation. The results showed that the removal efficiency of organic contaminants was higher for spark discharge than corona discharge, and the phenol removal rate can reach 100%. Yang et al. (2010) used pulsed spark discharge for calcium carbonate precipitation in hard water. The concentration of calcium ions fell 20–26% after 10min plasma treatment. As seen the remarkable advantages of PDL, pulsed discharge (especially pulsed spark discharge, which is more efficient both in wastewater treatment and hydrogen production) in alcohol distillery wastewater for hydrogen production is a promising research. In this investigation, hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by pulsed spark discharge was studied. A reactor for resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater was designed, and the characteristics of PDL in alcohol distillery wastewater were also presented. Meanwhile, characteristics of alcohol distillery wastewater treatment and hydrogen production by PDL were mainly researched in this work. Furthermore, combined the results of this work and the achievements of others, the mechanism of hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater was deduced. The processes of organic removal and hydrogen production by PDL were analyzed in this work."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup The schematic diagram of experimental setup for pulsed spark discharge in alcohol distillery wastewater for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 1 . The structure of the electrodes in the plasma reactor was the needle-plate electrode configurations. The needle electrode was made of platinum and shaped to have a sharp tip with a radius of curvature of approximately 0.2mm on the end with high positive potential, while the ground plate electrode was made of aluminum and the diameter was about 80 mm. The plasma reactor, which was loaded about 0.5L alcohol distillery wastewater in every experiment, was powered by a high voltage power supply (PPCP-0.2, CAEP HAITONG) equipped with a maximum allowable voltage of 60kV and frequency of 300Hz. During the experiments, both of two electrodes were immersed in alcohol distillery wastewater and spark plasma was directly generated in the liquid. A quartz window on the front of the plasma reactor was used to capture the information of spark plasma."
3,Analysis of discharge parameters & products,"2.2 Analysis of discharge parameters & products Analysis of pulsed spark discharge mainly consists of V-I characteristics, spectral characteristics and discharge images. The V-I characteristics were analyzed by an oscilloscope (TDS2024B, Tektronix) with a high voltage probe (P6015A, Tektronix) and a current probe (2878, Pearson Electronics). Based on the V-I characteristics, energy of single pulsed discharge and energy consumption can be calculated. (1) W = ∫ v ( t ) i ( t ) dt (2) ε = W · f 3600 Q H 2 t where W refers to energy of single pulsed discharge injected in the plasma reactor (J), ε refers to energy consumption of hydrogen production (kWh/L), f refers to discharge frequency (Hz), Q H2 refers to flow rate of hydrogen (mL/min), t refers to treatment time (min), and v(t), i(t) refer to voltage (V) and current (A) respectively. Voltage and current are in the function of time acquired by oscilloscope. A multi-channel spectrum analyzer (PMA-11, Hamamatsu Photonics) was used to research the spectral characteristics through the quartz window. To obtain the discharge images, a CCD camera (HiSpec1 2G Color, Fastec Imaging) was also fixed in front of the quartz window of plasma reactor. Gas production analysis can be accomplished by rotor flow meter (LZB-3, ZhengXing), mass spectrometry (HALO201, Hiden) and gas chromatography (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU), which were used to measure the flow rate, make qualitative and quantitative analysis of gas production respectively. (3) ω H 2 = V H 2 V total gas (4) Q H 2 = ω H 2 Q total gas (5) Y H 2 = 10 3 ∑ Q H 2 t V L · Δ COD where ω H2 refers to percentage concentration of hydrogen (%), V H2 and V total gas refer to volume of hydrogen (mL) and total gas (mL) respectively detected by GC, Q total gas refers to flow rate of total gas (mL/min), Y H2 refers to hydrogen yield (mL/g COD removed), ∑Q H2 t refers to total volume of hydrogen produced during every period, ΔCOD refers to the variation of COD (mg/L) and V L refers to volume of alcohol distillery wastewater (L)."
4,Water quality analysis,"2.3 Water quality analysis The conductivity and pH of alcohol distillery wastewater were detected by a conductivity meter (PHS-3C, Leici) and a pH meter (DDS-11A, Leici) respectively. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured by a COD meter (5B-3C, Lianhua), and a MI parameter meter (HI83200, HANNA) was applied to test ammonia. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was calculated by the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) during 5days, and DO was measured by a DO meter (HI4421, HANNA). Total solids (TS) and suspended solid (SS) were analyzed by gravimetric method."
5,Properties of wastewater,"2.4 Properties of wastewater Alcohol distillery wastewater was obtained from Jingbo distillery, Dashiqiao, China, where cassava was used as a raw material for alcohol fermentation. Table 1 shows the properties of alcohol distillery wastewater. It is observed that alcohol distillery wastewater is high concentration organic wastewater. Due to the cassava residues of alcohol fermentation, alcohol distillery wastewater contains a large amount of solids. Meanwhile, the biodegradability of alcohol distillery wastewater is bad owing to the low ratio of BOD to COD. Therefore, it is not suitable to directly use biological methods in alcohol distillery wastewater treatment. Considering the relatively high concentration of alcohol and the difficulty in disposing, alcohol distillery wastewater treated by plasma reforming for hydrogen production is appropriate. In this work, every experiment was repeated 5 times. The standard deviation was calculated as uncertainty, which mainly resulted from instantaneous instability of discharge or variation of external environment."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characteristics of PDL,"3.1 Characteristics of PDL The typical V-I oscillogram of PDL can be found in the previous work (Xin et al., 2016a,b,c). The process of PDL can be divided into two stages: propagation stage, and initiation stage. When the spark discharge is generated, voltage declines sharply and a strong current forms. The morphology of spark discharge can be also found in some work Xin et al. (2016c), which appears irregular filamentary structure. With the rapid formation of strong current, a large number of high-energy electrons can be formed, which were regarded as the first step in hydrogen production or pollutant removal by plasma reforming (Locke et al., 2006; Locke and Thagard, 2012; Xin et al., 2016b,c). The rapid formation of strong electric field makes electrons get the energy of 3–20eV. These high-energy electrons can collide with other molecules in liquid thereby forming many radicals. Free radicals such as OH, O, H have been found by spectral analysis in some work (Bruggeman and Leys, 2009; Xin et al., 2016b, 2016c; Zhang and Cha, 2015). There is great oxidability in OH and O, which can react with surrounding substance forming other active species such as HO2, O2 −, O3, H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Ozone (O3) have been found in PDL according to the previous work Sun et al. (2006). The concentration of H2O2 can be increased with the increase of input energy, and O3 exists in liquid even if no oxygen is bubbled into the reactor. These oxidizing active substances are the key for wastewater treatment Locke et al. (2006), and the formation of H is even a more important step to produce hydrogen Zhang and Cha (2015). Besides strong electric field and active species, ultraviolet light (UV) and shock wave also exist in PDL Bruggeman and Leys (2009). UV has a high energy, which is widely applied in pollutant removal. As some work shows, the effect of UV generated from PDL accounts for about 30% in overall effect (Lukes et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 1973). Meanwhile, quantum efficiency of UV emission (190–430nm) from PDL is always nearly (2−3)×1015 quantaJ−1 with different power supply Anpilov et al. (2001). Shock wave with intense of 10–20MPa is generated due to the rapidly expanding plasma channel Martin (1960). The resulting shock wave can induce pyrolytic and free-radical reactions indirectly via electrohydraulic cavitation Coleman et al. (1987). In addition, shock wave may affect the transportation of energy and substance (Cook et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1996). To sum up, PDL can generate strong electric field, active species, UV, shock wave, which are all good for the decomposition of raw material. The synergistic effect of these four makes PDL a good candidate for wastewater treatment. Hydrogen produced from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL can be also expected."
8,Organic removal and hydrogen production results,"3.2 Organic removal and hydrogen production results The experiments in this section were performed at peak voltage=25kV, discharge frequency=20Hz, electrode distance=15 mm. The water samples were treated by 5min, 10min, 15min, 20min, 30min respectively and then measured. Fig. 2 shows the effects of treatment time on organic removal. As shown in Fig. 2(a), both of the two curves show a rapid decline within the first 15min, then the trends become slower afterwards. The COD removal can reach 42% within 15min treatment shown in Fig. 2(b), and still shows an increasing trend though the growth rate slows down. The effect of treatment time on the ratio of BOD to COD is also presented in Fig. 2(b). The ratio of BOD to COD increases from 0.22 to 0.32 within the first 15min. It reflects that the biodegradability of alcohol distillery wastewater was achieved a significant improvement. The ratio of BOD to COD gets a slight decline after 15min, but it is still above 0.3 which is the minimum standard of biodegradation. All of gaseous products and volatile liquid products can be detected by the mass spectrum analysis, containing H2, CH4, CO, H2S, CO2, C2H5OH, C4H9OH, C2H3 N. The results indicate that many macromolecular organic matters exist in alcohol distillery wastewater, containing the elements of C, H, O, N, S. The effects of treatment time on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3(a), the flow rate of hydrogen shows an initial increase in the first 20min and then remains nearly constant. On the contrary, percentage concentration of hydrogen decreases rapidly in the first 20min and then stays around 50%. During the initial stage of treatment, a part of injected energy is used for the decomposition of macromolecular organics existed in alcohol distillery wastewater. These reactions probably cannot generate gaseous products leading to the low flow rate of hydrogen. However, the decomposition of some micromolecular organics like methanol is easier to generate hydrogen resulting in the high percentage concentration of hydrogen. As treatment time goes on, macromolecular organics have been adequately broken down and more gaseous products begin to be produced. It brings about higher flow rate of hydrogen but lower percentage concentration of hydrogen. Fig. 3(b) shows the effect of treatment time on hydrogen yield. Hydrogen yield can be effectively enhanced with the increase of treatment time. Hydrogen yield can reach over 140mL/gCOD removed after 30min treatment. Besides, energy consumption as a function of treatment time is also presented in Fig. 3(b). Energy consumption decreases with the increase of treatment time, which stays around 0.15kWh/LH2 after 20min treatment. The results in this section show that PDL can effectively remove the organics and improve the biodegradability of alcohol distillery wastewater. Meanwhile, hydrogen can be acquired from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL reforming. All these good results attribute to the characteristics of PDL analyzed in Section 3.1. However, the growth trend of organic removal and hydrogen production slow down after 15–20min treatment. The reason should be attributed to input energy shortage. After decomposing some labile substance, organics with higher bond energy cannot be easily decomposed that higher input energy is needed. The comparison of different methods on hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater is shown in Table 2 . It is found that this work has great advantages both in organics removal and hydrogen production. The efficient removal of COD can be achieved in a very short time compared with others. Meanwhile, the flow rate and percentage concentration of hydrogen are also higher than some other results. Hydrogen yield produced by PDL can be achieved the same level in contrast with ASBR, AFBR treatment, which may be further improved with the increase of treatment time as shown in Fig. 3(b). Thus, PDL is great for resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater for hydrogen production."
9,Mechanism of hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL,"3.3 Mechanism of hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL The mechanism of hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL was studied in this section, which considers both the function of strong electric field, free radicals, shock wave, UV generated by PDL and the effects of time, space, velocity. In this section, water and alcohol molecules in alcohol distillery wastewater were taken as example for mechanism analysis. Different region has different mechanism of resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL. The representative reactions in discharge channel generated by PDL are shown in Table 3 (Bundaleska et al., 2013; Buxton et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2010), which can be divided into electron reactions, free radical reactions and neutral particle reactions. 3.3.1 Electron reactions As the rapidly rising pulse with very short width applied in the electrodes, strong electrical field is formed thereby generating many high-energy electrons with 3–20eV in discharge channel. These high-energy electrons can collide with nearby substance (e.g. water and alcohol molecules) leading to the formation of free radicals (e.g. OH, O, H) and the decomposition of organics (e.g. alcohol). Hydrogen produced by PDL mainly occurred in discharge channel, which has been illustrated in the previous work Xin et al. (2016c). The generation of high-energy electrons was regarded as the first step in hydrogen production. Additionally, hydrated electrons are also generated from the reactions between water and electrons, which are an important source of hydrogen. 3.3.2 Free radical reactions Free radicals are the key to both wastewater treatment and hydrogen production, which have been confirmed in some literature (Bundaleska et al., 2013; He et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2016; Levko et al., 2012; Locke et al., 2006; Malik et al., 2013; Taghvaei et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010). Besides the free radicals generated from the electron reactions, shock wave and UV generated by PDL have high energy, which can also result in the formation of free radicals. The synergistic effect makes the effects of wastewater treatment and hydrogen production better around the discharge channel. As shown in reactions 27–32, the free radicals (e.g. OH, O, H) generated from the discharge channel can decompose the organic matters. Meanwhile, hydrogen is easily produced by many free radical reactions such as reaction 14, 15, 28, 31, 32. The formation of H is the key for hydrogen production by plasma reforming, which can be also found in many work (Levko et al., 2012; Malik et al., 2013; Taghvaei et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010). The majority of free radical reactions produced hydrogen has relatively faster chemical reaction rate (e.g. reaction15, 31, 32), which can be achieved over 1010 Lmol−1 s−1. Thus, hydrogen is easier to be generated in the process of PDL. Although the reaction rate is a little slower, the reactions of hydrogen consumption also exist such as reaction 20, 25. Thus, shortening the retention time of hydrogen in discharge channel is important for hydrogen production by plasma reforming. 3.3.3 Neutral particle reactions The strong oxydic free radicals can react with each other forming many neutral species such as H2O2, O3 (e.g. reaction 19, 22), which also have strong oxidizing property. These neutral particles can directly react with organic compounds (e.g. alcohol) achieving organic removal. However, the rate constant of neutral species reactions is far less than free radical reactions and these neutral species can be decomposed by some free radicals such as H generated from the discharge channel (e.g. reaction 17). Thus, neutral species reactions are few compared to free radical reactions in discharge channel. In discharge channel, free radicals play an important role in wastewater treatment and hydrogen production. However, far away from the discharge channel, free radicals generated in discharge channel cannot take effects according to the short lifetime of free radicals about 10−6–10−9 s. Thus, relatively stable active species such as H2O2, O3 generated by PDL play main role in the region of no discharge. The lifetime of O3 in liquid can reach one to ten minutes or even more, and H2O2 is more stable than O3 in liquid. What’s more, the concentration of H2O2, O3 can be boosted with the increase of treatment time Liu et al. (2015). The UV light generated by PDL acquires about 3–5% of injected energy, which can spread in liquid and generate some free radicals. The UV light can also decompose H2O2, O3 thereby forming strong oxydic free radicals such as OH, O. The velocity of shock wave generated in liquid is 3.7–4.3 times more than in gas, which can be attained about 103 m/s. However, this velocity cannot take the free radicals generated in discharge channel away, but the shock wave with high energy can produce free radicals in its propagation process. Certainly, free radicals far away from the discharge channel generated by UV light and shock wave account for less according to the limitation of energy and distance. The neutral particles with strong oxidizing like H2O2, O3 are more important for water treatment in this region. To sum up, the mechanism of resourceful treatment of alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL is diverse in different region. In discharge channel, high-energy electrons and resultant free radicals play a leading role. Far away from discharge channel, the neutral particles with strong oxidizing property are more important. Additionally, shock wave can form agitation in liquid, which stirs surrounding wastewater into discharge channel continuously improving the effects of both alcohol distillery wastewater treatment and hydrogen production."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL was first studied in this work. The biodegradability of wastewater can be improved and COD removal attained over 40% within 15min PDL treatment. Meanwhile, flow rate, percentage concentration, and yield of hydrogen achieved were 80mL/min, 50%, 146mL/g COD removed respectively within 30min treatment. Furthermore, the mechanism of hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by PDL was presented in this work. In discharge channel, high-energy electrons and resultant free radicals play a leading role. Far away from discharge channel, the neutral particles with strong oxidizing are more important."
