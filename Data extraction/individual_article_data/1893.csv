0,Introduction,"C4 alkenes are important raw materials in polymer manufacture. 1-butene is used as monomer to produce polybutene [1,2], and 2-butenes are widely used in the production of gasoline, detergent alcohols, synthetic lubricants and plasticizers [3,4]. In order to guarantee product quality, trace amount of alkynes and dienes in the C4 stream should be removed via selective hydrogenation [1,2,5]. The conventional catalysts for selective hydrogenation are noble metal-based catalysts such as Pt and Pd [6–12]. Recently, molybdenum carbide [13–16] has attracted attentions in catalysis due to its unique chemical and surface properties. Because molybdenum carbide possesses similar electronic properties to those of noble metals, it has been utilized in hydrogenation reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation to alcohol [17], CO hydrogenation to alcohol [18], hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) [19], hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [20], and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [21]. Molybdenum carbide exists in several crystal phases, among which β-Mo2C with the orthorhombic structure [22] and α-MoC with the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure [17] are most commonly used. Both could be used in the hydrogen-involved reactions; whereas they present different catalytic properties. Firstly, it was reported that strong adsorption of H could occur on the β-Mo2C surface, while α-MoC presented weaker hydrogen binding energy. In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the strong hydrogen binding energy over β-Mo2C benefited H+ reduction, while the weaker binding energy over α-MoC facilitated hydrogen release [23]. Secondly, β-Mo2C surface presented more coordinatively unsaturated Mo sites than α-MoC, and the coordinatively unsaturated Mo sites played a crucial role in different reaction pathways. In the hydrogenation of furfural in alcohol solvents, the more-unsaturated Mo sites were beneficial for the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol reaction; however they depressed the activity of furfural hydrogenation [24]. In CO2 hydrogenation, β-Mo2C exhibited higher selectivity to CO and methanol, and α-MoC presented better stability and preferential selectivity to hydrocarbons [25]. In the dry reforming of methane, it was found that the catalytic stability of α-MoC was superior to that of β-Mo2C [26]. Thirdly, because of the different intrinsic structure, α-MoC exhibited lower active site density than β-Mo2C, which was related to the catalytic performance. The lower site density could result in more space around the Mo atoms in the α-MoC phase, making the Mo atoms more accessible for the large reactant molecule. In the stearic acid hydrodeoxygenation, the α-MoC catalyst showed faster reaction rate due to its lower site density [27]. In the thiophene hydrodesulfurization reaction, it was reported that the higher catalytic activity of alumina-supported β-Mo2C catalyst stemmed from the higher density of active sites [28]. Furthermore, DFT studies revealed that the geometry and electronic properties of the clean MoC and Mo2C surfaces had strong influence on H2 dissociation as well as the adsorption properties of unsaturated hydrocarbon [22,29]. Posada et.al [30] reported that H2 dissociation could spontaneously occur on β-Mo2C(001) independently of the surface termination, whereas a small but noticeable energy barrier was needed on δ-MoC(001). Jimenez-Orozco et.al [22] reported that the adsorption energies of both acetylene and ethylene followed the trend of β-MoC > δ-MoC. In addition, the mixed phase α-MoC/β-Mo2C showed excellent performance due to the synergetic effect [15–17]. For example, Zhang et al. [31] reported a superior HER performance over α-MoC/β-Mo2C, and Wu et.al [32] reported the improved efficiency of lignin hydrogenation over α-MoC/β-Mo2C. In recent studies, the structure control of molybdenum carbides through the carburization of organoamine-molybdenum oxide became a popular method due to the easy fabrication procedure and the tunable product properties [33,34]. Organoamine-molybdenum oxide could be transformed into molybdenum carbide at lower temperatures compared with the conventional carbothermal reduction of molybdenum oxide [35]. The crystal structure and morphology of the resulting products could be easily modified by controlling different amines and reaction conditions [36]. The synthesized molybdenum carbides exhibited higher crystallinity [36] and surface area [37]. They exhibited excellent catalytic performance towards CO2 hydrogenation [38,39], hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [23,40], and photocatalytic reaction of H2 evolution. [41]. However, the existence of nitrides would be inevitable because the organoamine could not only act as a carbon source to form carbides, but also provide nitrogen atoms to dope into carbides [42]. Therefore, the effect of the nitride species obtained from this synthesis route should also be noted. In the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, the molybdenum carbide based catalysts showed potentially excellent activity similar as noble metal catalyst [43]. In our previous study, a molybdenum carbide catalyst synthesized via the H2-preactivation process with the presence of α-MoC phase exhibited higher butene selectivity than the pure β-Mo2C catalyst, which inspired us that the crystal phases of Mo2C may have significant effect on the catalytic performance [37]. In this study, we synthesized α-MoC, β-Mo2C, and the mixed phase of α-MoC/β-Mo2C (denoted as MoC-Mo2C) catalysts via the temperature programmed carbonization from amine-molybdenum oxide precursor to explore the effect of molybdenum carbide crystal phases on the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Moreover, the nitride effect over the catalyst was also discussed. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2-physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 1,3-butadiene temperature-programmed desorption (C4H6-TPD), H2 chemisorption, ethylene chemisorption and CO pulse titration. The adsorption properties of the different phase were further investigated by DFT calculations. The catalysts were evaluated at low and high temperatures in a fixed-bed reactor. By analyzing the experimental results and the DFT calculations, the catalytic performance of molybdenum carbides with the different phase phases for the selectivity of 1,3-butadiene were discussed."
1,Experimental and theoretical method,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The molybdenum carbide catalysts with different crystalline phases (α-MoC, β-Mo2C, and mixed phase MoC-Mo2C) were synthesized by temperature-programmed carburization from MoO3-aniline precursor. In the synthesis of precursor, 2.48 g of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O, Aladdin) was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water, and 3.28 mL of aniline (C6H5NH2, aladdin) was added into the solution. Afterwards, 1 M HCl aqueous solution was added dropwise with magnetic stirring at room temperature until white precipitate appeared (pH 4–5). After stirring at 323 K in oil bath for 2–6 h, the product was filtrated, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and was dried at 323 K for 12 h [44]. The precursor was then grinded to powder for later use. In the temperature-programmed carburization process, about 0.4 g precursor was placed in a tube furnace. After expelling air by argon at room temperature for 4 h, the temperature was ramped to T F at 5 K min−1. The temperature was kept for t 1 h in argon (50 mL min−1). The gas feed was then switched to a mixed stream of 20% CH4/Ar (50 mL min−1) for t 2 h. Afterwards, the gas was switched to Ar of 100 mL min−1 for t 3 h; and then the sample was left in H2 of 100 mL min−1 for t 4 h. Details of T F, t 1, t 2, t 3 and t 4 are listed in Table 1. The sample was cooled down to room temperature in 100 mL min−1 Ar, and was passivated in 50 mL min−1 1% O2/N2 for 6 h before exposure to air."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the phase composition using a Shimadzu XRD-600 instrument. The operating condition was 40 kV with a current of 30 mA and a scanning rate of 10° min−1 from 20° to 90°. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N2-physisorption using a BELSORP-max instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a JSM-7500F instrument operated at 20 kV together with the EDX elemental mapping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on JEM-2100 instrument operated at 200 kV. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on ESCALAB, 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα anode. The XP spectra of Mo 3d, C 1s and N 1s were recorded with a step size of 0.05 eV. The electron binding energies were calibrated to the C1s peak. The deconvolution was made based on the original data using the software of “XPS Peak”. The chemisorption experiments were conducted on a Quantachrome chemisorption analyzer. CO pulse titration was performed to determine the number of active sites available on the catalyst surfaces. The uptakes of H2 and C2H4 were measured to analyze the adsorption capacities of reactants on the catalysts. Temperature programed desorption (TPD) was performed to understand the desorption properties. Rather than the conventional pretreatment, a deactivation–regeneration process was performed before the chemisorption experiments to simulate the reconstructed surface during reaction. According to our previous report, the reconstructed molybdenum carbide surface after several deactivation–regeneration cycles would exhibit better stability [37]; therefore, the similar surface as in the reaction is crucial to characterize catalyst adsorption properties. The details of the deactivation–regeneration process was as follows: the sample was reduced at 723 K in 10% H2/Ar for 1 h; after cooling to 308 K in 10% H2/Ar, pulses of 100 mL 50% C2H4/N2 and 100 mL 10% H2/Ar were cycled for ten times. After repeating the process for two times, the sample underwent another reduction at 723 K and was cooled to room temperature in Ar. After the above pretreatment, pulse chemisorptions of CO, C2H4 and H2 were then performed using pulses of CO, 50% C2H4/N2 and 10% H2/Ar, respectively. In the TPD experiments, after adsorbing 5% 1,3-butadiene/N2 for 2 h and purging by Ar (100 mL min−1) for 40 min, the catalyst sample was heated from room temperature to 723 K at the ramping rate of 10 K min−1 in Ar."
4,Catalysts evaluation,"2.3 Catalysts evaluation The molybdenum carbide catalysts were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor. In a typical experiment, a mixture of 0.2 g fresh catalyst and 1.8 g silica was loaded into the middle of the fixed bed reactor and was reduced in H2 at 673 K for 1.5 h. After cooling to 308 K, the feed gas was switched to the reactant stream containing 9.1% H2 and 4.5% C4H6 balanced with N2 and the total flow rate was 66 mL min−1. Because the molybdenum carbide catalysts would undergo surface reconstruction during the reaction [37], the catalytic performance was evaluated after two deactivation–regeneration cycles. In each cycle, the reaction was allowed to occur at 308 K in the reactant stream until the conversion decreased below ~20%; afterwards, the catalyst was regenerated in H2 at 673 K for 1 h. In the catalyst evaluation, low temperature and high temperature performances were investigated. The low temperature evaluation was conducted at 308 K after two cycles of deactivation–regeneration. The high temperature evaluation was conducted at 398–453 K after a passivation procedure at 383 K for 100 min in the reactant stream. In the passivation (Fig. S1), the activity of the catalyst was observed to decrease rapidly initially, and to be stable with the rate of deactivation less than 1% min−1 after 100 min. Afterwards, the reaction temperature was elevated and the catalyst was left for 1 h at each reaction temperature. The outlet stream was analyzed online by a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector (SHIMADZU2014) and a HP-Al/S PLOT column (Agilent, 30 m × 0.53 µm). Only the C4 species (1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and butane) and trace amount of oligomer were observed, with the gas-phase carbon balance above 95%. The 1,3-butadiene (BD) conversion and selectivity to each butene species (X) were calculated by the equations: (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = 1 − C BD , out C BD , in × 100 % (2) S e l e c t i v i t y X ( % ) = C X C BD , in − C BD , out × 100 % The total butene selectivity was obtained by summing the selectivities of all butenes. (3) S e l e c t i v i t y T o t a l ( % ) = C t r a n s − 2 − b u t e n e + C 1 − b u t e n e + C c i s − 2 − b u t e n e C BD , in − C BD , out × 100 %"
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [45–49] using the vdW-DF2 functional [45,50] and the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) was implemented. The cut-off kinetic energy for plane-wave basis was 450 eV and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack grid. The electronic relaxation was considered converged when total energy in subsequent iterations varied by less than 1 × 10−5 eV and the forces convergence criteria were below 0.01 eV/ Å. The orthorhombic Mo2C phase with the lattice constants of a = 4.905 Å, b = 6.234 Å and the cubic MoC phase with the lattice constants of a = b = c = 4.273 Å were selected as the bulk model, corresponding to the β-Mo2C and α-MoC phases respectively. After the optimization of the bulk models, the supercells of p(2 ×2) β-Mo2C(001) and α-MoC(001) slabs with four repeated layers and a vacuum layer of 15 Å were built as shown in Fig. S2. The (001) surfaces were chosen due to the low Miller-index [51]. In the geometry optimization, the bottom two layers were frozen, while the top two layers were allowed to relax. After the cleaved slabs were optimized, the d-band center and the adsorption energies of H, C4H6 and C4H8 were calculated."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 Physical properties The XRD profiles of MoC-Mo2C, β-Mo2C and α-MoC are shown in Fig. 1. The α-MoC sample shows diffraction peaks at 36.5°, 42.1°, 61.5° and 73.8°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) facets of the α-MoC phase (JCPDS 65–0280). The β-Mo2C sample exhibits diffraction peaks at 34.5°, 38.0°, 39.5°, 52.2° and 61.7°, corresponding to the (002), (200), (102), (202) and (023) facets of the β-Mo2C phase (JCPDS 71–0242). The MoC-Mo2C sample exhibits mixed phases of β-Mo2C and α-MoC; the peaks at 34.5 °, 39.4 ° and 52.2 ° correspond to the characteristic peaks of β-Mo2C phase, and the peaks at 36.5° and 42.1° correspond to the characteristic peaks of α-MoC phase. The weight ratio of α-MoC and β-Mo2C phases over the MoC-Mo2C sample is further confirmed to be 48:52 (wt/wt%) by the refinement of XRD patterns. The XRD crystallite sizes were calculated by Scherrer Equation as shown in Table 2. The average crystallite sizes of MoC-Mo2C, β-Mo2C and α-MoC are 12.1 nm, 29.6 nm and 5.1 nm, respectively. In addition, it is known that the MoO3-aniline precursor could provide nitrogen atoms to form nitrides or dope into molybdenum carbides [42]. The XRD peaks of MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC partially overlap with the Mo2N (JCPDS 75–1150) peaks at 37° and 43°; and the peak of β-Mo2C shifts slightly towards higher angles possibly due to the insertion of nitrogen atoms. Therefore, the presence of nitrogen atoms in the investigated catalysts should not be excluded. In order to determine the elemental composition, EDX was performed by SEM, and the presence of nitrogen is confirmed as listed in Table S1. Combining the EDX analysis together with the XRD spectra, it is possible that nitride or N-doping should be present in the as-synthesized catalysts. Especially, the MoC-Mo2C shows higher bulk nitrogen content, indicating a stronger effect from nitride. The BET surface areas (S BET) of the catalysts are summarized in Table 2. α-MoC exhibits the largest surface area of 122.9 m2 g−1; β-Mo2C exhibits the surface area of 34.6 m2 g−1, and the surface area of MoC-Mo2C (84.3 m2 g−1) is between those of α-MoC and β-Mo2C. The results are in consistent with the previous reports that α-MoC usually possesses higher surface area than β-Mo2C [52,53]. Compared with the molybdenum carbide synthesized by the conventional CH4-temperature-programmed carburization from MoO3, the samples in the current work exhibit higher surface area [37]. According to the phase composition obtained from the XRD result, the weighted surface area of MoC-Mo2C should be 77.0 m−2 g−1, similar to the measured S BET of 84.3 m−2 g−1, which indicates that the surface area of MoC-Mo2C may be contributed by the different crystal phases; the slight increase of measured S BET with respect to the weighted surface area may stem from the higher content of nitride, which was reported to possess a higher surface area [53]. The mean pore diameters were also listed in Table 2. The pore diameters are in the order of β-Mo2C > MoC-Mo2C > α-MoC, which is opposite to the order of surface areas. The catalyst morphologies were investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2, the three samples are observed to possess wire-like microstructures with lengths of several micrometers and widths of several nanometers. The average wire widths of β-Mo2C, α-MoC, and MoC-Mo2C are 54 nm, 71 nm and 136 nm, respectively. It is reported that such wire-like structure exhibits much higher surface area than the Mo2C synthesized by the conventional temperature-programmed carburization [13,40], which is consistent with the BET results. Moreover, abundant small particles are observed along the wires over the α-MoC and β-Mo2C, which are quite sparse over MoC-Mo2C. After grinded and dispersed in ethanol, the TEM samples exhibit nanoparticles over the three catalysts as shown in Fig. 3(a, d, g), indicating that the nanowire structures are possibly composed of small nanoparticles. The particle size distributions are obtained in Fig. 3(c, f, i) based on the analysis of more than 100 particles. The average particle sizes of β-Mo2C, α-MoC, and MoC-Mo2C are 8.1 nm, 3.6 nm and 5.2 nm, respectively. The crystallite sizes of MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C from the TEM results are significantly smaller than those obtained from the XRD results, indicating that most of the small particles observed in TEM images are amorphous or low-crystallized. The high resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. 3(b, e, h). The lattice spacings of 0.22 nm and 0.25 nm correspond to the (101) plane of β-Mo2C [54] and the (100) plane of α-MoC [54], respectively. The lattice spacings of 0.22 nm and 0.25 nm are observed over MoC-Mo2C, implying the presence of the mixed phase of β-MoC and α-Mo2C. 3.1.2 Surface properties The XP spectra of Mo 3d are deconvoluted as shown in Fig. 4(a). The peak at 228.5 eV~228.7 eV is assigned to the Mo2+ 3d5/2, while the peak at 229.1 eV~229.3 eV is assigned to the Mo3+ 3d5/2. The surface compositions of different Mo species are summarized in Table 3. As expected, Mo2+ species prevail over β-Mo2C and Mo3+ species prevail over α-MoC. MoC-Mo2C exhibits similar surface compositions of Mo2+ and Mo3+ species, confirming the presence of both α-MoC and β-Mo2C phases. Moreover, the surface ratio of Mo2+/Mo3+ is 1.06, which is close to that of β/α fraction obtained from XRD result, implying that the surface composition is similar to the bulk composition. The surface electron state of catalyst has significant effect on catalytic behaviors. Specially, Mo2+ species possesses higher electron density than Mo3+; therefore, the catalyst performance would be greatly affected by the surface Mo species arising from the different crystalline phases. In Fig. 4(b), The XPS spectrum of C 1s was deconvoluted into five peaks: the peaks at 283.8, 284.8, 285.6 and 288.9 eV, corresponding to C−Mo, CC, C−N, C−O and O−CO, respectively. The C−N bond indicates the existence of nitrogen atoms in the samples. The existence of surface nitrogen atoms is further confirmed by the XPS spectra in Fig. S3, which is consistent with the aforementioned results. Subsequently, the XPS spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 4(c) was deconvoluted into five peaks. The peaks centered at 400.6, 399.1, 398.2, 396.6 and 394.6 eV correspond to the graphitic N, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N, N-Mo bond and Mo 2p3/2, respectively. In addition, the element contents of C, N, O, Mo were further determined by XPS (Table S1). The surface element ratios are compared with the bulk element rations from EDX. The bulk and surface C/Mo ratios both follow the order of α-MoC > MoC-Mo2C > β-Mo2C. It is noted that α-MoC exhibits obviously higher surface C content than MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C, which may be attributed to the absence of H2 treatment over α-MoC during the synthesis process. The adsorption properties of the catalysts were investigated by CO pulse titration, H2-chemisorption, C4H6-TPD, and C2H4-chemisorption after the deactivation–regeneration pretreatment, in order that the catalyst surface is identical to that in the catalyst evaluation. CO uptake and H2-chemisorption were performed to investigate the surface active sites and hydrogen adsorption properties. The CO uptake and H2 uptake values of MoC-Mo2C are significantly higher than those of β-Mo2C and α-MoC as shown in Table 4. When normalized by surface area, the uptake values still follow the order of MoC-Mo2C > β-Mo2C > α-MoC. The normalized CO uptake of MoC-Mo2C is still significantly higher than that of β-Mo2C and α-MoC, implying that there may exist considerable synergetic surface sites over MoC-Mo2C which could bear more CO. Moreover, the higher CO uptake over MoC-Mo2C may also benefit from the higher amount of nitrogen content, because the mixed-phase Mo2C-Mo2N was reported to chemisorb more CO than Mo2C [39]. On the contrary, the existence of nitrogen on molybdenum carbide can weaken the hydrogen absorption; therefore, the presence of nitrogen atoms over MoC-Mo2C should play a critical role in preventing the chemisorption of H2 [55,56]. However, the H2 uptake of MoC-Mo2C is higher than the weighted uptake calculated according to the surface β/α fraction, verifying the synergetic effect over the mixed molybdenum carbide phase. The CO uptake values are assumed to be the number of active sites over the catalysts; therefore, the ratio of H2/CO in Table 4 would represent the amount of hydrogen on each active site. β-Mo2C exhibits the highest H2/CO ratio, indicating that the hydrogen atoms are abundant at each active site. The abundant hydrogen atoms would promote the hydrogenation activity, however may decrease butene selectivity. C4H6-TPD and C2H4-chemisorption were performed to understand the adsorption properties of alkenes. The C4H6-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. S4, with the onset desorption temperatures summarized in Table 4. The highest onset desorption temperature of 451 K is observed over β-Mo2C, suggesting the strongest adsorption of 1,3-butadiene. MoC-Mo2C shows the onset desorption temperature at 366 K, which is between those of β-Mo2C and α-MoC. The strength of C4H6 adsorption follows the order of β-Mo2C > MoC-Mo2C > α-MoC. Moreover, β-Mo2C displays considerable amount of adsorbed C2H4; however, C2H4 adsorption capacity is almost absent on MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC, suggesting that β-Mo2C possesses more adsorption sites for alkenes."
8,DFT calculations,"3.2 DFT calculations DFT calculations were performed in order to further investigate the electronic and adsorption properties of different molybdenum carbide surfaces. MoC(001) and Mo2C (001) slabs were selected as model surfaces for α-MoC and β-Mo2C, respectively. The densities of states (DOS) of different surfaces are shown in Fig. S5. Both MoC and Mo2C surfaces appear the peaks at the Fermi level, and the Mo2C(001) surface show significantly increased density of states around the Fermi level compared with MoC(001). The d-band center values (ε d ) [57] are shown in Table 5. The ε d of Mo2C (−1.11 eV) is closer to Fermi level than the ε d of MoC (−1.54 eV), suggesting that the Mo2C surface might possess higher intrinsic activity than MoC [58]. These specificities of surface electronic states suggest that the catalytic properties might be significantly different between the two phases of molybdenum carbide. The optimized adsorption configurations of H, C4H6 (1,3-butadiene) and C4H8 (1-butene) are shown in Fig. S6, and the lowest adsorption energies (E ad) are summarized in Table 5. Hydrogen atom could adsorb at Mo site or C site. The adsorption energies at C site are lower than those at Mo site over both surfaces, implying that hydrogen adsorption is more stable at C site. Moreover, hydrogen adsorption is stronger on Mo2C(001) than on MoC(001), suggesting that hydrogen atoms adsorb more readily on the β-Mo2C catalyst. Similarly with hydrogen, the adsorptions of C4H6 and C4H8 are also stronger on Mo2C(001) than on MoC(001). The stronger adsorption of C4H6 on Mo2C(001) is consistent with the C4H6-TPD result. The lower adsorption energy of C4H6 on MoC(001) implies that the butene species would desorb from α-MoC surface more easily than from the β-Mo2C surface, resulting in higher selectivity to butene species over the α-MoC catalyst."
9,Catalyst evaluation,"3.3 Catalyst evaluation The molybdenum carbide catalysts were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The reaction temperature of 308 K was chosen for the low temperature evaluation. As previously reported [37], the as-prepared catalysts would undergo rapid deactivation when exposed to reactant stream, and the catalyst stability could be restored and enhanced by regeneration due to surface reconstruction. After two cycles of the deactivation–regeneration, the surface reconstruction was achieved that the catalyst performance does not change much thereafter. Therefore, the low temperature evaluation was conducted after the pretreatment (two cycles of deactivation–regeneration). Although the catalysts would deactivate within several hours at 308 K, it is not clear whether the catalyst would exhibit stable performance at higher temperature after the passivation in reactant stream. It was reported that depositing a thin layer of carbonaceous material on the surface of the Pd catalyst, the initial high activity was reduced and a stable catalytic performance was achieved [59]. Based on the analogy, the high temperature evaluation with a kinetic study at 393–453 K was conducted after a passivation at 383 K. 3.3.1 Low temperature evaluation The low temperature evaluation results are shown in Fig. 5. The conversions as a function of time-on-stream (TOS) are shown in Fig. 5(a). Both MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C exhibit complete conversion at the initial stage of hydrogenation, while α-MoC presents low initial conversion of 31%, and deactivates rapidly within 30 min. The conversion of β-Mo2C starts to decrease after 44 min, and decreases to below 20% within 170 min. The low initial conversion of α-MoC may be attributed to its high surface C content, which might cover the active sites and result in lower activity. The conversion of MoC-Mo2C starts to decrease after 105 min and decreases below 24% within 273 min. MoC-Mo2C shows better stability than α-MoC and β-Mo2C, suggesting that a synergetic enhancement exists over MoC-Mo2C. The enhancement of stability could be attributed to the significantly more active sites over MoC-Mo2C, and the considerable amount of active sites could participate in reaction incrementally and contribute to the prolonged high activity. The similar synergetic effect has been revealed in several reactions [15–17,32], resulting in improved intrinsic activity. Moreover, in the deactivation stage, the decrease patterns show exponential decay over β-Mo2C and MoC-Mo2C, which correspond to the 1st order of deactivation. The regressed deactivation rate constants (k d ) are summarized in Table S2 and the details of the deactivation model were provided in the supplementary material. It is observed that β-Mo2C has a larger k d (1.538) than MoC-Mo2C (1.024), which suggests that the intrinsic deactivation of the active site of β-Mo2C is faster than MoC-Mo2C. The catalytic stability of β-Mo2C in dry methane reforming was found to be lower than that of α-MoC due to the different reaction mechanism between β-Mo2C and α-MoC [26]. The selectivities to total butenes as a function of TOS and conversion and are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. The selectivities are observed to increase with TOS; with increasing TOS, the catalyst surface is partly deactivated and is covered with carbonaceous species. The increased selectivity partially stems from the surface modification by the surface carbon deposition, which was reported to cover some of the active sites for the complete hydrogenation and contribute to the increased selectivity to butenes [37,60]. On the other hand, with decreasing conversion, the reaction atmosphere also changes; the local alkene concentration decreases while the alkadiene concentration increases; therefore, the catalyst surface possesses less alkene species and the complete hydrogenation is limited. The selectivity to total butenes over β-Mo2C decreases slightly after achieving the highest value at 90 min, while the selectivity over MoC-Mo2C continues to increase, indicating that the selectivity over β-Mo2C is less affected by surface carbon. The selectivities to C4 products (1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene and butane) are shown in Fig. S7. It is observed that 1-butene and butane are the main products at low temperature. 1-butene selectivity follows the order of α-MoC > MoC-Mo2C > β-Mo2C at low conversions, which is the same trend with the total butene selectivity. The selectivities are closely related to the surface adsorption properties. Because the adsorbed H2/CO ratio (Table 4) is significantly higher over β-Mo2C, it is speculated that considerably more H atoms surround one C4 molecule at each active site, and the considerable H atoms would participate in butene hydrogenation and therefore contribute to lower butene selectivity. To verify the speculation, the hydrogenation of 1-butene was carried out over β-Mo2C and MoC-Mo2C as shown in Fig. S8. In consistence with the TPD results, β-Mo2C exhibits much better stability and higher activity than MoC-Mo2C, suggesting that 1-butene could be hydrogenated to butane more easily over β-Mo2C than over MoC-Mo2C. In addition, the stronger adsorption energy and higher adsorption capacity of alkenes over β-Mo2C concluded by DFT calculations (Table 5) and C2H4-chemisorption (Table 4) imply that the produced butenes tend to undergo hydrogenation to butane rather than desorption from catalyst surface, leading to the lower selectivity over β-Mo2C. The yields of butenes over the different catalysts are shown in Fig. 5(d). Among the investigated catalysts, MoC-Mo2C shows the highest yield of 28.8% at 150 min, while the highest yield over β-Mo2C is 20% at 90 min. In addition, the initial yield of α-MoC is 27.4%, which comparable to the highest yield over MoC-Mo2C. 3.3.2 High temperature evaluation: kinetic study The kinetic study of the molybdenum carbide catalysts was performed at high reaction temperature. In order to obtain stable catalytic performance, the catalysts underwent a passivation procedure in the reactant stream [59]. After 100 min passivation at 383 K, the conversion was observed to be stable with the deactivation rate less than 1% min−1. A thin layer of carbonaceous material thus formed on the catalyst surface prior to stable evaluation. The catalysts were then tested in the fixed-bed reactor under steady state in the temperature range of 393–453 K, in the C4H6 pressure range of 2.2–5.4 kPa, and in the H2 pressure range of 5–35 kPa. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) were calculated based on the surface area or the weight of catalyst using the average value of three consecutive conversions at the stable stage, and the conversions below 40% were used in order to eliminate the external and internal mass transfer limitations. Details of the mass transfer criterion calculations are provided in the supplementary materials (Section 3.2). The Arrhenius plots of the TOF normalized by catalyst surface area and catalyst weight are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The TOFs normalized by surface area display. the order of β-Mo2C > MoC-Mo2C > α-MoC, while the TOFs normalized by catalyst weight follow the order of MoC-Mo2C > β-Mo2C > α-MoC in the temperature range of 413–453 K, and the TOF of β-Mo2C becomes slightly higher than that of MoC-Mo2C at 393 K. The activity trend is consistent with that at low temperature MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C exhibit higher activity than α-MoC. The higher activity over β-Mo2C could be explained by the DFT result that the d-band center of Mo2C(001) is closer to Fermi level than MoC(001). In addition, it was reported that when the percentage of nitrogen in molybdenum carbide system increased, the d-band center shifted downwards. Therefore, the slightly inferior activity over MoC-Mo2C may partially originate from its higher nitrogen content, which makes the d-band center shift downwards more obviously, thereby decreasing the activity. The selectivity-conversion curves are shown in Fig. S9. All of the data were obtained with conversion lower than 40%. Therefore, the selectivities are compared directly without concerning the conversion. The selectivities to total butenes under the investigated temperatures are shown in Fig. 6(c). MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C show 100% selectivity to butenes while α-MoC shows lower selectivity of 77–92%. The loss of selectivity over α-MoC entirely comes from the formation of C6+ species. The increased selectivity compared with low temperature over MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C could be partially attributed to the surface carbon modification [37,60]. On the other hand, the thermodynamic data also illustrate the increased selectivity. As shown in Table S3, with increasing temperature, the equilibrium constants (K 1 and K 2) for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene to butene and the hydrogenation of butene to butane both decrease. In order to compare the two hydrogenation steps, logK 1 /logK 2 was calculated. The value of logK 1 /logK 2 increases from 0.684 (308 K) to 1.262 (393 K) with increasing temperature, suggesting that the hydrogenation to butene is more favorable than the hydrogenation to butane, resulting in higher butane selectivity at high temperature. The effects of reactant pressure on the TOF normalized by catalyst weight as well as the selectivity to total butenes are further investigated at 373 K as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) presents the TOF as a function of 1,3-butadiene partial pressure under the fixed H2 pressure of 13 kPa, and Fig. 7(b) presents the TOF as a function of H2 partial pressure under the fixed 1,3-butadiene pressure of 4 kPa. It is observed that the reaction rate increases with increasing partial pressure of H2, and is hardly affected by the partial pressure of 1,3-butadiene in the range of 2.2–5.4 kPa, which suggests that the reaction rate is more dependent on the P H2 (partial pressure of hydrogen) than on the P C4H6 (partial pressure of 1,3-butadiene) under the investigated conditions. Matthew et al. [59] reported similar results in the hydrogenation reaction of acetylene over Pd/Al2O3 that the reaction order of acetylene is approximate 0 below 398 K, while the reaction order of hydrogen is positive within the temperature range of 373–498 K. The selectivities to butenes under different reactant pressures are shown in Fig. 7(c-d). β-Mo2C shows 100% selectivity, while MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC show lower selectivity of 60–85%. The loss of selectivity over MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC both stems from the formation of C6+ species, which is absent over β-Mo2C, implying that β-Mo2C is superior to α-MoC in inhibiting the oligomerization pathway. Moreover, MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC exhibit increased selectivity with increasing hydrogen pressure, because the increased H2 partial pressure could inhibit the formation of C6 species [61], leading to the increased selectivity."
10,Discussion,"3.4 Discussion The low temperature evaluation represents the properties of the clean catalyst surfaces. Among the investigated catalysts, α-MoC possesses the highest surface area, however exhibits the lowest activity, suggesting the low intrinsic activity over α-MoC. β-Mo2C exhibits the highest activity and the lowest butenes selectivity, which is consistent with the characterization and DFT results. Firstly, the d-band center of β-Mo2C is closer to Fermi level, and the surface electronic properties contribute to the higher activity. Secondly, the uptake ratio of H2/CO is significantly higher than the other two catalysts; therefore, there exist considerable hydrogen atoms around one active site, leading to higher possibility of hydrogenation, resulting in higher activity and lower butene selectivity. Thirdly, β-Mo2C possesses higher capacity and stronger adsorption of alkenes, resulting in lower selectivity. A synergetic effect exists over MoC-Mo2C as verified by the chemisorption results. The synergetic effect prevails in the low temperature evaluation that MoC-Mo2C exhibits better stability than both α-MoC and β-Mo2C. In the high temperature evaluation, the passivation was conducted before reaction, and the molybdenum carbide catalysts show stable activity at high temperatures. The selectivities to butenes are enhanced over MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C due to the carbon modification and the thermodynamic effect. Apart from the reaction temperature, the partial pressure of hydrogen plays a significant role on the catalytic performance. Increasing hydrogen pressure not only could promote the activity but also reduce the formation of oligomers on the catalyst surface, leading to the improved selectivity. Among the investigated catalysts, β-Mo2C exhibits the best performance at high temperatures due to its higher activity and the inhibition of oligomerization. In addition, the synergetic effect over MoC-Mo2C is insignificant in the high temperature evaluation."
11,Conclusion,"In order to investigated the effect of different crystal phases in the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, three kinds of molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C, MoC-Mo2C and α-MoC) catalysts were successfully synthesized by temperature programmed carburization of MoO3-aniline, and were evaluated at low and high temperatures. The synthesized samples exhibit wire-like microstructures and higher surface area than the conventional CH4-temperature-programmed carburization procedure. The bulk ratio of β/α fraction over MoC-Mo2C is approximately 48:52 (wt/wt%) by XRD refinement, and the surface composition is similar to the bulk composition by XPS. The presence of nitrogen is confirmed in MoC-Mo2C, α-MoC and β-Mo2C by XRD, EDX and XPS analyses, and MoC-Mo2C may be more significantly affected due to its higher nitrogen content. The surface properties could significantly affect the catalytic properties. The chemisorption experiments show that MoC-Mo2C possesses higher CO uptakes, which should be attributed to its heterostructure and higher amount of nitride species; MoC-Mo2C also possesses higher H2 uptakes than α-MoC and β-Mo2C, which implies the synergetic effect. The hydrogen concentration around one active site on β-Mo2C is significantly higher than the other two catalysts, indicating the higher possibility of hydrogenation which could enhance the hydrogenation activity and reduce the butenes selectivity. Moreover, β-Mo2C has the strongest adsorption energy and the highest adsorption capacity of alkenes. DFT calculations reveal different surface electronic properties over Mo2C(001) and MoC(001). The d-band center of Mo2C(001) is closer to Fermi level, and the adsorption of H, C4H6 and C4H8 is stronger over Mo2C(001). In the low temperature evaluation, both β-Mo2C and MoC-Mo2C show complete initial conversion, and α-MoC exhibits the lowest intrinsic activity. β-Mo2C exhibits the lowest butenes selectivity, which could be explained by the chemisorption and DFT results. MoC-Mo2C exhibits better stability than both α-MoC and β-Mo2C due to more exposed active sites, verifying the synergetic effect. In the high temperature evaluation, as compared with the low temperature evaluation, the selectivity to butenes is enhanced over MoC-Mo2C and β-Mo2C due to the carbon modification and the thermodynamic effect, and is decreased over α-Mo2C due to the formation of oligomers. The reaction rate is more dependent on the partial pressure of hydrogen than on the partial pressure of 1,3-butadiene under the investigated conditions. Increasing hydrogen pressure not only could promote the activity but also reduce the formation of oligomers on the catalyst surface, leading to the improved selectivity. Among the investigated catalysts, β-Mo2C exhibits the best performance at high temperatures concerning its high activity and the inhibition of oligomerization. This work is valuable for the non-precious metal catalyst development and will inspire the community to pay attention to the novel catalyst performance at different temperatures."
