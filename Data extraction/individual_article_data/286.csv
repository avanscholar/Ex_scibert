0,Introduction,"Global energy demand is steadily rising in the world as a consequence of increasing human activities day by day. The main issue to be addressed is the provision of energy for ever-increasing consumption. Depending on limited and depleting energy reserves for overcoming challenges is not considered a sustainable approach. Accordingly, an energy crisis will be inevitable in the future if alternative energy sources are not found. Currently, the majority of the world energy requirement is supplied by using fossil fuel-based resources. The primary energy supply of the world is provided by oil (32%), coal (27%), natural gas (22%), biofuels/waste (10%), nuclear (5%), hydro (2%), and others (2%) [1]. However, fossil fuels– as the main energy supply– have some drawbacks such as being affected by political instability, fluctuation of price, limited reserves, energy security, and emission of a massive amount of pollutants to the environment (e.g. carbon dioxide) that negatively affects the climate change and increase the water level in the oceans. Consequently, the search for alternative energy is estimated to increase gradually in the near future [2]. Meanwhile, the rise in carbon emissions perpetuates global warming and serious threats to nature [3]. For this reason, low-carbon energy systems are recommended to mitigate the potential risks of global warming. This problem draws great attention particularly from the researchers in the fields of environment, climate, and energy [4]. The emission coming from fuel combustion needs to be decreased with strict regulations by national and international policies. For this reason, low-carbon powered systems must be increased to meet future energy demand and reduce gas emissions [5]. Energy derived from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydrogen could be attractive for building a feasible and sustainable energy plant [6]. Clean, renewable, and alternative, hydrogen appears to be a promising energy carrier for future energy demand. For instance, hydrogen conversion to electricity is not climate or weather dependent as an advantage compared to wind or solar systems [7,8]. Besides, the electricity produced from hydrogen is reliable and continuous; thus, an electricity storing facility is not required [9]. On the other hand, due to high energy content of hydrogen (122 kJ/g) compared to hydrocarbon fuels, it generates considerable amount of energy in combustion [10] and has received attention as a fuel for transportation [11]. At present, numerous methods are available for hydrogen production ranging from small to large scales. Electrolysis, pyrolysis, gasification, steam reforming of natural gas are extensively used pathways to produce hydrogen [12]. Despite various processes, industrial-scale hydrogen is majorly generated by steam reforming of methane, coal gasification, and water electrolysis [13,14]. Indeed, each production method has its own advantages and drawbacks in its application. However, biological hydrogen offers many distinct and special features relative to others. Biological hydrogen synthesis can be conducted by a certain group of microalgae, non-photosynthetic, and photosynthetic bacteria via biophotolysis, dark fermentation, and photofermentation processes respectively [15]. Photosynthetic bacteria (green sulfur, purple sulfur, and purple non-sulfur) are capable of producing hydrogen in an anaerobic environment. Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are promising and the most widely used photosynthetic group for biological hydrogen production [16]. Photofermentation is one of the biological processes driven mostly by PNSB which is consuming organic substrates as the electron donor and producing molecular hydrogen under nitrogen-limited, anaerobic, and light conditions (Fig. 1 ) [17]. In general, photofermentative process includes multi steps. Initially, the substrates such as carbohydrates or organic acids are utilized by TCA cycle in an oxidation reaction that provides electrons. Also, it produces carbon dioxide. Then, electrons are transferred from TCA to nitrogenase by successive oxidation and reduction of electron carriers. Nitrogenase is the primary enzyme catalyzing the hydrogen generation in PNSB. Electron carriers include NAD/NADH and (Fd)ox/(Fd)red. Alongside that, photosynthetic membrane provides ATP by utilizing sunlight. These ATP, electron and protons are transferred to nitrogenase and hydrogen is produced by proton reduction [18]. The action of nitrogenase in the presence of nitrogen indicates that per molecule of N2 one molecule of hydrogen can be generated as indicated in reaction 1. (1) N 2 + 8 e − + 8 H + 16 A T P → H 2 + 2 N H 3 + 16 A D P + 16 P i However, in absence of molecular nitrogen, 4 molecules of hydrogen are produced as shown in reaction 2. (2) 8 e − + 8 H + 16 A T P → ⋅ 4 H 2 + 16 A D P + 16 P i Thus, anaerobic nitrogen-limiting conditions (i.e. low levels of nitrogen source to nitrogenase) are favorable to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen generation metabolism from saccharides is presented by Sagir et al. [19]. PNSB by implementing the EMP and/or ED pathways can break down monosaccharides namely glucose or fructose to produce ATP and NADH. Disaccharides such as sucrose can be taken after its hydrolysis to glucose and fructose. Due to light excitation and sugar consumption electrons will be produced. Then, electrons are carried by Fd and NADH to enzyme and Calvin cycle and TCA cycles. As mentioned the nitrogenase enzyme catalyzes hydrogen production by consuming ATP and electrons providing from the TCA cycle. Photofermentation is considered as a promising process due to the use of solar energy and different carbon sources, a wide range of wavelengths (400–1000 nm) under light, working at mild pressures and temperatures [18]. There have been many studies in photofermentative hydrogen production so far [20]. From a substrate and bacteria perspective, various photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. R. sphaeroides, R. capsulatus, R. palustris) and compounds including organic acids (e.g. acetate, lactate, malate), and sugars (e.g. glucose, sucrose) have been used in photofermentation [19,21–24]. Biomass is also regarded as a potential renewable substrate source for biohydrogen production if it is effectively utilized. Biomass is mostly obtained as a result of agricultural and industrial processes where sugarcane, sugar millet, sugar beet, sweet sorghum, potato, and corn are used as raw materials [25]. Sugar-containing wastes are potentially suitable for biohydrogen production as they contain different carbon and nitrogen sources [26,27]. For this reason, two-stage sequential or combined systems involving both dark- and photofermentation have been mostly used to synthesize hydrogen from different sources of biomass or wastes [28–32]. Alternatively, hydrogen production from sugar-containing wastes (beet molasses and blackstrap) was also carried out by single-stage photofermentation [33]. In addition, hydrogen production was conducted by using various PNSB on sucrose and molasses [34]. In some of the other single-stage studies, photofermentation was implemented by Rhodobacter capsulatus YO3 on sucrose and beet molasses with large-scale compact tubular photobioreactors (PBRs) in indoor and outdoor conditions [35–37]. In the vast majority of the research in photofermentation, hydrogen production was accomplished by using PBRs with suspension cultures [38,39]. Cell immobilization is a method and technique to immobilize cells on a matrix. The principal aim of this approach is to enhance hydrogen production by making microorganisms immobile. Studies in the immobilization of photosynthetic bacteria have been initiated and intensified since the 1980s. The early studies reported that bacteria could be found at high concentrations and high rates of hydrogen have been obtained by immobilized cells [40]. Recent researches on photofermentative hydrogen generation by immobilized photosynthetic bacteria were illustrated in Table 1 . Immobilization provides considerable benefits over suspension cell culture systems including the ability to use high cell biomass, supply nutrients without harvesting cells, reduce the likelihood of cell contamination, improve the stability of the cells, and decrease the ground area of reactors used [41]. These parameters in return will provide more energy with regards to hydrogen production and long-term run of the process. Immobilization also presents the cell with a relatively more stable microenvironment than suspension culture. Although there are many reviews in biohydrogen and photofermentation, there has not been a recently published review on biohydrogen production by immobilized cultures through photofermentation. The objective of this study is to provide a review of biohydrogen generation by immobilized photosynthetic bacteria. In this respect, cell immobilization methods and techniques, impacts of different parameters in immobilized systems, pros and cons over suspension cultures, immobilized photobioreactors, and techno-economic evaluation have been scrutinized with regards to the enhancement of hydrogen production, yield HY, and rate HPR. The benefits and drawbacks of immobilization techniques have been discussed and possible approaches were also proposed. This review highlights the current perspectives of photofermentation and immobilization. This review intends to address the main issues in immobilized systems and proposes alternative solutions with a hierarchical workflow."
1,Immobilization of photosynthetic bacteria,"Cell immobilization means the process of making live cells immobile by holding them in a separate region from its surrounding environment. In fact, cell immobilization can be categorized into natural and synthetic cell immobilization. So far, photosynthetic bacteria have been immobilized by using different materials and methods for various purposes [42]."
2,Natural cell immobilization,"2.1 Natural cell immobilization Natural cell immobilization is a process involving natural ways of immobilizing the microorganisms. Biofilm formation is a natural bacterial process that starts by clinging to a surface. The formation of biofilm is the result of the survival strategy of bacteria against stress conditions in the environment. Although biofilm generation is a slow process, it is natural and provides higher cell stability compared to non-natural immobilization methods [43]. Biofilm photobioreactors (BPBR) are mainly used for waste removal via dark-or photofermentation processes as well as biofuel production. Biofilms could be used in different kinds of reactors such as flat panel, groove type, and an optical fiber for hydrogen production [44]. Biofilm formation is an inheritance characteristic of some species to surrender and fix cells at a position in space. Biofilm is a proper example of natural immobilization which is only developed by microorganisms without external interference. The formation of biofilm is a multistep process and demands some requirements to be met. Hence, it needs more time than synthetic immobilization. As indicated in Fig. 2 , the process of biofilm starts with the attachment of bacteria to a surface and then proceeds to grow and increase their number by forming a dense structure [45]. Thereafter, the bacteria become mature and secrete extracellular substances (e.g. polysaccharides, proteins) with time. The cells are surrounded by the formed protective matrix and thereby stay together. Finally, some of the bacteria are detached by dispersion and then the free bacteria may try to form a new colony. The natural biofilm formation process is considered to occur in three stages namely attachment, colonization and biofilm maturation as described by Tsygankov and Kosourov [46]. In the first step, PNSB makes effort to attach to the surface that can be affected by surface property including porosity and charges. On the other hand share forces implied by the liquid medium hydrodynamic conditions can affect adherence. After cells' irreversible attachment, the next step initiates with cell growth that results in small colonies of microorganisms. Providing desirable conditions in the environment (i.e. high availability of feed, low amount of toxins, low share forces toward the wall) process will continue as illustrated by Dagher et al. [47]. Finally in the biofilm cell density increases, and reaches a point that the biofilm formation and dispersal of microorganisms becomes a steady state [46,47]."
3,Synthetic cell immobilization,"2.2 Synthetic cell immobilization The synthetic immobilization techniques can be employed by using various approaches, materials, and methods. Until now, a variety of photosynthetic bacteria have been immobilized with various support matrices including agar [41,48,49], alginate [50], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [51], latex [52], porous glasses [40,53], glass beads [54], active carbon fibers (ACF) [55]. As previously mentioned, immobilization methods can be applied either by synthetic or natural immobilization techniques. An immobilized cell, in either case, should fulfill at least the following aspects; (1) immobilized matrix should be biocompatible to the cell, (2) the matrix should be robust to mechanical forces (e.g. thermal, shear) for a long-time, (3) the characteristics of the matrix should enhance the diffusion of substances, (4) the immobilization practice should be easy, simple and cost-competitive, (5) the material must also be transparent for efficient access of light to the reactor [46]. Adsorption, encapsulation, and entrapment are the main methods to make the cells immobilized (Fig. 3 ) [41]. Adsorption is a commonly used practice that occurs through the attachment of the bacteria onto a surface of a support medium with a reversible binding mechanism. The type of chemical forces between the adsorbent matrix and cell regulate the interaction. The type of binding depends on the load of the microorganism and the surface. It is well known that most of the bacteria have a negative charge on their surface. Thus, if the bacteria are placed onto a positively charged material, they will inhabit most of the area on the surface of the material. Activated carbons, carbon nano-materials, and porous glass can be potential adsorbents for immobilization intend [54,55]. Encapsulation is a way of immobilization of cells in a semi-permeable membrane which permits the transfer of molecules through the membrane. Encapsulation has been used for various purposes including biomolecules, chemicals, and enzymes. Gel encapsulation, latex coating, and alginate films are some basic examples of encapsulation. For encapsulation, numerous materials (including alginate, silica, polyvinyl alcohol) have been used to improve cell viability, light transparency, stability, mechanical flexibility, and porosity [50,51,56]. However, these features do not coexist in the same material, thus limiting its applications. Each material represents its specific characteristics and features when used for immobilization purposes. For instance, latex coating provides mechanical stability to immobilized bacteria. Although alginate films have low mechanical stability, different materials and polymers such as chitosan, PVA, polyurethane, etc. have been crosslinked with alginate to improve the strength and stability [57]. Gel entrapment is the most extensively used polymer assisted technique in which bacteria are immobilized within a network of the polymer matrix. It is a favorable way of immobilizing photosynthetic bacteria as it not only protects the cells from the environment but also provides an anaerobic environment that promotes hydrogen production [58]. Gel entrapment is performed using a wide range of natural or synthetic organic and inorganic materials including carbohydrates, proteins, and polymers. Although protein matrices are transparent in the visible spectrum, they are expensive to use for immobilization [59]. Polysaccharides such as agar, alginate, agarose, chitosan, cellulose, starch, pectin, and carrageenan have been widely used for the immobilization of cells. The main disadvantages of polysaccharides are low physical and chemical endurance and stability. Therefore, their application may require additional materials for further support. PVA is another material for cell entrapment due to its transparency, stability, and low price [60]. Furthermore, cooling, pH change, UV-light polymerization, bivalent ion addition are some commonly used methods to polymerize and form immobilized cell matrices [61]. Plenty of different support materials have been tested for immobilization so far. For instance, porous glass was used to immobilize Rhodobacter sphaeroides in research by Ref. [62]. In their study, biohydrogen production was conducted with a flat plate (200 mL) reactor in a semi-continuous mode. The results showed that porous glasses were feasible to immobilize the cells for stable hydrogen production. Similarly, the same research group also achieved continuous hydrogen generation by immobilized Rhodobacter sphaeroides on a modified porous glass. The average HPR obtained as 12.7 mL/L/h, by using malic acid as a substrate in a 235 mL glass PBR. It was also noted that hydrogen production was reduced due to the accumulation of formate and biomass in the medium [53]. Different matrices such as acrylic rods, high-density poly-ethylene cylinders, and luffa have also been used to immobilize PNSB using volatile fatty acids as substrates [63]. Continuous hydrogen production was carried out at 32 ± 2 °C in 120 mL serum bottles throughout 29 days. The authors reported that the most suitable support was luffa fibers for PNSB in terms of higher biomass concentration, area to volume ratio, and effective light distribution. Nano-materials have recently been used to enhance biohydrogen production [64]. Nanomaterials also allow the reuse of adsorbent thereby is considered economically feasible. Immobilized bacteria on nanoparticles have the ability to resist again temperature and pH differences. TiO2, SiC, and ZnO are highly used materials in biohydrogen production [65]. Overall, it can be stated that a single material or technique may not be sufficient for ideal immobilization. Thus different materials, methods, and techniques can be combined to maximize the benefit of the process."
4,Factors affecting hydrogen production in immobilized cultures,"The immobilized systems are influenced by various physiological, environmental, and constructional factors including materials used for immobilization, type of substrate/feed, pH, temperature, light source and intensity, modes of operation, strains of bacteria (Fig. 4 ) [66]."
5,Support materials,"3.1 Support materials The characteristics of the support material including porosity, texture, pore size, thickness influence substrate transport between bacteria and medium. The transfer of the substrate through the immobilized matrix determines the efficiency of the substrate utilization. In a study by Xie et al. [55] surface-modified ACF was developed to immobilize Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53 for continuous biohydrogen production. The surface modification was done by HNO3 oxidation, which enhanced the immobilization capacity of the cells. Hence, the modifications allowed the bioreactor to operate at a low HRT and with a high organic loading rate. Besides, an HY of 3.3 mol H2/mol acetate was attained in the immobilized system. Another study of the same research group examined the biological hydrogen generation by Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53 immobilized with diverse sizes and lengths of carbon fibers using a 100 mL glass vessel. The utmost HY of 3.08 mol H2/mol acetate and HPR of 32.85 mL/L/h was reported [67]. A different study using ACF as an immobilizing carrier demonstrated that excessive ACFs (higher than 0.8 g/L) could inhibit H2 production by increasing biofilm detachment and limiting the light conversion efficiency (LCE). They reported that the amount, length, and surface area of ACF have significant impacts on hydrogen production [55]. Therefore, the optimum carrier is suggested to be mechanically strong but its concentration should permit sufficient mass and light transfer through the bacteria and carrier. A group of photosynthetic bacteria was shown to be protected by the alginate matrix against external forces (e.g. proton gradient) in the work of Zhang et al. [50]. Besides, diffusional resistance to substrates and light penetration was reported with alginate matrix at a granule size of less than 2.5 mm. Besides, the use of mixed culture resulted in a competition of substrates for consumption by the various strains. A continuous hydrogen production process was performed by Ref. [53] Zagrodnik et al. using R. sphareoides immobilized with porous glass. It was noted that the HPR gradually decreased through the process due to VFA accumulation. The authors proposed that substrate conversion must be enhanced by proper HRT and mixing control. The use of porous glass enhanced the active biofilm and working volume of the bioreactor. In another study, Tian et al. [54] used glass beads for attachment of Rhodopseudomonas palustris in a photofermentative hydrogen process. Also, the biofilm on glass beads significantly enhanced hydrogen production. One of the important benefits of immobilization is using the same material for a certain period repeatedly. Results of Zagrodnik et al. [62] indicated that hydrogen production decreased through the subsequent cycles of the operation. This was attributed to the loss of the attached amount of cells on the glass surface. The low adsorption ability of the cells was due to the negatively charged glass surface. The best hydrogen production performance and stability were obtained with porous glass with large pores (100–160 μm) in a continuous hydrogen production system for 3 months. The outcomes of the work suggest that the carrier could be enhanced by some modifications to have a better attachment."
6,Substrates,"3.2 Substrates The selection of substrate is a critical factor in immobilized systems as the utilization and conversion efficiency differs among the substrates. A variety of substrates including acetate [41,67], glucose [68,69], sucrose [19], succinate [40] have been used in those systems for hydrogen production so far. Investigating the hydrogen generation rate of PNSB, Asada et al. [70] concluded that high acetate concentrations (from 84 to 162 mM) cause the inhibition of hydrogen synthesis. The results indicated the initial acetate concentration must be kept in a tolerable range for the bacteria to sustain better hydrogen performance. They also reported improved hydrogen production rate (HPR) of PNSB by gel immobilization. Recently, biohydrogen production was demonstrated by agar-immobilized R. capsulatus on acetate on a laboratory scale (200 mL) photobioreactor [41]. They optimized various factors including carbon (acetate), nitrogen (glutamate) source, and immobilized carrier (agar) concentrations. They hypothesized that long-term exposure to high acetate concentrations (higher than 60 mM) might lead to a metabolic change in bacteria. This was attributed to the lowered activity of nitrogenase and an increase in the production of other metabolites (e.g. poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)). Alongside that, biohydrogen generation was conducted by agar immobilized R. capsulatus on sucrose [19]. They reported that the initial sucrose loading should not exceed 10 mM for effective hydrogen production. The sequential batch was operated for about 2 months. However, the gradual formation of cracks in agar led to the disintegration of the agar-bacteria complex through time. The immobilized system prevented sudden pH changes which are resulted from VFA production during sucrose utilization. Similarly, single-stage photofermentation was employed in outdoor conditions by immobilized R. capsulatus using beet molasses as substrate through 40 days of operation. The average consumption of sucrose was about 50% of the initial substrate concentration. It was also noted that hydrogen production was inhibited at 20 mM initial sucrose [71]."
7,"pH, temperature and light","3.3 pH, temperature and light The change of pH influences hydrogen production as nitrogenase works optimally at a neutral pH in most of the PNSB [72]. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that the agar immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatus YO3 cells were less affected by pH variations employing cell entrapment with agar. The pH ranged between 6.0 and 7.5 throughout a long-term sequential batch run in a panel PBR on sucrose [19]. Likewise, the same PBR (1.4 L) was used with agar immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatus for hydrogen generation from acetate. The pH was maintained between 6.7 and 8.0 for the whole period of 72–82 days [73]. Similarly, a stable pH profile was achieved in a long-term (60 days) system by agar immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatusYO3 with small-scale PBR, thus the proposed system did not require buffer addition [41]. As well, the temperature has a critical impact on the immobilized systems in particular on the enzyme activities (e.g. nitrogenase, hydrogenase). Moreover, beyond HY and HPR of the immobilized bacteria, the immobilized matrix can also be affected adversely by the temperature fluctuation in the outdoor reactor system [18]. Therefore, immobilized material should be robust against possible disintegrations of cell-matrix resulting from temperature stress. Additionally, immobilized bacteria could be genetically modified to tolerate a wide range of temperatures. The light source and intensity play significant roles in photosynthetic immobilized cultures. Besides, transparency and the structure of the support material also affect hydrogen production by enhancing mass transport between carrier and substrate. It was shown that transparent gel granule enhanced light utilization and thereby hydrogen production [51]. In the work of Tian et al. [53], in which glass beads were used for immobilization of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, they observed photoinhibition at high light intensities between 5000 and 8000 lux. However, a remarkably high LCE (56%) was achieved at 5000 lux. Also, a high light intensity of above 8000 lux exhibited light inhibition to the PNSB immobilized with alginate matrix [50]."
8,Modes of operation,"3.4 Modes of operation The mode of the operation and the type of the processes (e.g. single, two-stage, sequential or combined) play significant roles in microbial systems in terms of feasibility, efficiency, and cost of the systems [74]. For instance, the utilization of sugars by immobilized bacteria has been demonstrated in some recent works. Single-stage photofermentation has been processed by agar immobilized PNSB on sucrose either in indoor or outdoor conditions (Fig. 5 ) [19]. They demonstrated scaled up of an immobilized system for sustainable biohydrogen production. The proposed system maintained a stable and less fluctuated pH profile during the hydrogen production for 64 days of operation. The highest HPR and HY of 17.8 mL H2/L/h and 19 mol H2/mol sucrose respectively, was achieved. Likewise, in a recent study, beet molasses was subjected directly to photofermentation by agar immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatus YO3 with a flat panel PBR in outdoor real conditions [71]. Hydrogen production was realized with sequential 10 rounds for 40 days under outdoor conditions. The highest hydrogen rate in outdoor conditions was 19.3 mL H2/L/h. They also reported that the initial sucrose loading of 20 mM inhibits hydrogen generation. These attempts on immobilization demonstrated the promise of the immobilized system for long-term sustained hydrogen production. In a two-stage study, hydrogen production was realized by photosynthetic R. faecalis RLD-53 and fermentative E. harbinense B-49 on glucose [49]. The effluents of the dark fermentative process (ethanol and acetate) were provided for use by the agar immobilized R. faecalis. The highest HY (6.32 mol H2/mol glucose) was achieved with 9 g/L glucose and 30 mM buffer concentration. It was concluded that the production of high ethanol reduced hydrogen production. Biohydrogen production was reported by immobilized Rhodobacter capsulatus in a long-term production on acetate in a 200 mL Roux bottle reactor [41]. Sequential batch hydrogen production was demonstrated by the operation of the immobilized PBR for 60–70 days."
9,Other factors,"3.5 Other factors The type of bacteria strains to be immobilized also influences the hydrogen generation. Asada et al. [70] studied the hydrogen synthesized by five different PNSB on acetate under photoheterotrophic conditions. The highest HY of 3.03 mol H2/mol acetate was attained by Rhodobacter sphaeroides RV on 21 mM acetate in a 212 mL Roux bottle reactor. The lowest hydrogen production was obtained with R. palustris. They also concluded that acetate concentration of which higher than 21 mM inhibited hydrogen production. In hydrogen production processes, the control of OLR and HRT is very critical from an engineering point of view. For this reason, Wang et al. [75] investigated the bioconversion characteristics of entrapped Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01. They observed that HY always decreased with increasing OLR and intermediate production. It was concluded that hydrogen production performance and conversion efficiencies were interactively affected by OLR, HRT, and light illumination. The overall energy efficiency (4.8%) was lower than the LCV (82.3%). Currently, research and operation of immobilized bacteria in the biohydrogen field at a large-scale remain insufficient. Recently, in a large scale operation of immobilized R. capsulatus in a PBR, hydrogen generation was prolonged for 82 days in sequential batches. Interestingly, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) formation as a byproduct, led to a reduction in hydrogen production by inhibiting the metal ion availability for the nitrogenase [73]. When recent studies are examined, it can be observed that HPR ranges from 8.7 to 62 mL/L/h (Table 1). The lowest HPR was obtained with glucose, while the highest HY was obtained with sucrose. These studies were also evaluated in terms of achievements and limitations as shown in Table 2 . Indeed, a wide range of carriers has been used to immobilize the cells for hydrogen production. Among them, agar and glass attracted more attention as they are very durable and easy to handle. The batch studies indicated that agar was a promising carrier for the photosynthetic bacteria. However, there is no report conducting a continuous photofermentative hydrogen production system using agar immobilized bacteria. Thus, studies mostly on large-scale continuous hydrogen production are recommended."
10,Photobioreactors for photofermentative hydrogen by immobilized bacteria,"A great number of photobioreactors (PBR) ranging from different design and configuration (Tubular, flat plate, helical, fermentor type, etc.) are available for photofermentative hydrogen production [76]. Immobilized PBR systems are established by a combination of the microorganism with a variety of support materials such as granular and rough surfaces, gels, beads in a closed system. As well, the selection of material in reactor configuration and construction is of major importance for sustainable long-term hydrogen production [77]. The characteristics and types of construction material are essential in terms of the durability and longevity of PBRs. In addition, area to volume ratio (A/V) and the thickness of the reactor affect light transmission and thereby LCE of the hydrogen production system [76]. A polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) fabricated vessel was used for biohydrogen production from a PVA-boric acid gel granule including immobilized Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 [51]. The granule facilitated light entrance and mass transport due to their porous character. The highest HY, 3.6 mmol/gcdw, was obtained at the optimal pH 7 and 30 °C. It was noted that the light intensity had a remarkable effect on HPR. Also, it was inferred that transparent PVA-boric acid gel enhanced light penetration. In one study, continuous hydrogen production by a groove-type biofilm reactor with Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 was operated under LED light illumination. The results were also compared to another flat-panel PBR operated in the study. The highest HY and LCE were 0.75 mol H2/mol glucose and 3.8%, respectively. These values were 75% higher than that obtained with the flat panel PBR [78]. Further increase of the light wavelength (from 590 to 630 nm) resulted in a severe decrease both in HPR and HY. A novel bio-carrier was developed with a polymer mixed with nano-sized inorganic compounds for enhancing the immobilization of Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53. The results showed that the particle size, carrier amount, and light intensity influence the hydrogen generation significantly in the continuous process. In turn, maximum HY and HPR were 3.24 mol H2/mol acetate and 36.06 mL/L/h, with the optimum conditions of particle size (2 × 2 mm), amount (3% w/v), and light intensity (6000 lux) [55]. In a study by Wang et al. [75] Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 was immobilized with PVA, alginate, and carrageenan in a PBR and operated in a continuous mode. A flat panel PBR made of PMMA with 5 mm thickness and 800 mL volume was operated continuously in an anaerobic environment using glucose as a substrate. A light intensity of 200 W/mm2 was provided by LED lamps at various wavelengths. The highest hydrogen production (62 mL H2/L/h) was obtained with an LCE of 82.3%. Biofilm photobioreactors (BPBRs) have recently attracted a great deal of interest in both hydrogen production and waste removal. BPBRs offer many advantages including packing the cells at high concentration, high conversion yield, reduced photobioreactor volume, and avoiding cell washout problems. On the other hand, BPBRs have still some drawbacks such as light conversion efficiency, slow growth, and low biofilm activity [44]. Most of the BPBRs in literature have been implemented in dark fermentative hydrogen generation. Only a few studies are available in the literature using biofilms for photofermentative hydrogen production. Some of the recent studies on biohydrogen production with BPBRs are illustrated in Table 3 . A biofilm reactor was enhanced by optical fibers and the additional rough surface was operated using Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 [79]. Notably, it was observed that these modifications improved the biofilm formation and consequently increased H2 production. They also found that the ideal conditions for H2 generation were 60 mM glucose, 30 °C, and pH 7.0. Also, the highest HPR of 42 mL/L/h was reported in that research. Further increase of influent substrate (80 mM) and influent flow (40 mL/h) led to a decrease in LCE, HPR, and reactor performance. The optical fibers with the rough surface improved biofilm, hydrogen production, and long-term stability. In a recent study by Fu et al. [80], a novel BPBR using a light guide plate (LGP) and support carrier was demonstrated to amplify the H2 generation by enhancing light intensity (Fig. 6 ). In the BPBRs implementing LGP and SCM-LGP (SiO2-chitosan-medium) have increased the amount of hydrogen 0.6 and 1.1 times higher compared to cases that original BPBR with PMMA respectively. It was also shown that SCM-LGP was preferable for the biofilm formation compared to LGP and PMMA. Recently, a biomaterial doped with nanomaterial, designated as GeO2-SiO2-Chitosan-Medium-LaB6 (GSCML), was developed and used for hydrogen production (Fig. 7 ). The novel material was used to enhance the biofilm process and HPR. The biofilm formation rate and HPRs were improved by 3.4 and 4.1 times more than that of the commercially available glass material [81]. In a very recent study, a BPBR by Rhodopseudomonas sp. on a silicon sheet was employed [82]. It was clearly demonstrated that protein and DNA were the main components in EPS and biofilm formation. They suggested that biofilm regulated acetate utilization and decrease EPS secretion to enhance hydrogen production. Also, the BPBR improved the HY from 2.6 to 3.06 mol H2/mol acetate. Continuous hydrogen production and biofilm development of Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 on a grid columnar in a glass panel PBR were investigated in a recent study [83]. The authors reported that the novel BPBR improved the surface area of biofilm, mass transfer of glucose, and H2 production with a high rate of 32 mmol/L/d. Overall, the design, construction material, and configuration of PBR should be well organized for a proper hydrogen performance. Especially, some of the key aspects such as temperature control, gas exchange, mixing, area/volume ratio, and material type should be carefully considered when establishing a PBR. Among the various PBRs, tubular and, flat plate types made of transparent materials such as glass and PMMA are highly recommended since light conversion efficiency is one of the major challenges in photofermentative systems [77]."
11,"Hydrodynamic, heat and mass transfer in cell immobilized photobioreactors","Transport phenomena namely mass, energy, and momentum exchange have significant effects on hydrogen production in a cell immobilized system. For instance, mass and heat transfer are two crucial factors influencing the immobilized cultures in PBRs. Notably, in a typically immobilized culture, the improvement of hydrogen production is attributed mainly to the high surface area of the PBR, immobilized biomass, and efficient mass transfer of the substrate and other products in media [84]. For an efficient process, immobilized material must allow access to substance and heat through the matrix. Work by Elkahlout et al. [41] indicated that an agar concentration of more than 4% cause a decrease in mass transfer in the biohydrogen process by immobilized R. capsulatus. Therefore, substrate concentration must be optimized to enhance mass transfer and substrate utilization. The produced hydrogen by the immobilized cells may have hurdles while diffusing out of the medium. The diffusion of the hydrogen can be affected by the physical and chemical structure of the carrier and the medium. Limited gas diffusion could also lead to the disintegration of carriers and cells. Hence, porous materials should be preferred in such systems in order to eliminate the carrier disintegration. In a recent work of immobilization, it was reported that mass transport between immobilized cells and the medium could be hindered in the system [19]. It was also shown by Tian et al. [51] using PVA-boric acid gel granule facilitated light penetration and mass transport due to their porous character in a PMMA fabricated vessel by immobilized photosynthetic Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01. On the other hand, suspension cultures enable easy access for the transport of the produced gases and metabolites in the system. Mixing is a vital process as the produced hydrogen must be removed from the liquid medium. Otherwise, the partial pressure of hydrogen could likely decrease mass transfer efficiency and thereby lowers HY. Although mixing is a necessary phenomenon in these systems, it raises the overall cost of the process. The optimum operating temperature for the PNSB is 30 ± 2 °C. Therefore, maintaining temperature by controlling exchanged heat inside a PBR is crucial to produce hydrogen at high yield. This phenomenon is highlighted while a PBR gets overheated (likely in an outdoor run at a typical summer day) since PNSB will be deactivated and stop generating hydrogen. Although, by cooling very below the optimum temperature PNSB will stop converting a substrate to hydrogen. As soon as temperature increases PNSB starts production. Different efforts have been made to keep the temperature at outside conditions around the desired set point by spraying water on the PBR surface [85–87] or immersing of the PBR in a thermo-regulated pool [88,89]. Various studies were conducted to model the temperature inside a PBR [90–93] and even in a suspension culture while producing hydrogen [94]. However, the temperature impact on a cell immobilized PBR productivity is still missing. In order to model the heat transfer considering numerous parameters such as heat exchange due to metabolic activity of PNSB and heat release/absorb by cooling/heating solvent circulating inside the immobilized PBR are vital. Alongside that, there are major environmental variables including ambient temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity that affect convective heat transfer. Energy received by radiation not only covers direct and diffuse solar radiation but also radiation and reflected radiation from the ground and surrounding air. Besides, the reactor emits radiation energy which should be taking into account [95]. Furthermore, if the substrate is feed continuously the work done by the pump also should be added to the energy balance equation. The essential parameters in the heat transfer modeling are presented in Fig. 8 . Sagir and coworkers [19] conducted outdoor experiments to convert sucrose to hydrogen in an agar immobilized PBR and just reported temperature data in the spring and summer. In order to set the temperature around 30 °C cooling water was used. Because of the time variability of parameters describing the general image demands to run experiments over at least a full year. Then a heat transfer model can be established with these data for further implementations. The dynamic behavior of fluid in a PBR is equally important as heat and mass transfer issues. The shear stress effects on alga cultivation were investigated [95,96] but the impact of these forces on immobilization and its life duration is missing. For instance, the hydrodynamic forces caused by turbulent mixing in a continuous flow large scale PBR should not surpass the level that cannot be tolerated by the immobilized PNSB. Flow dynamic modeling and validation are important for proper PBR scale-up [97,98]. Computational Fluid Dynamics is used for simulating hydrodynamics, heat, and mass transfer in alga cultivation PBRs [99]. Thus as a useful tool, it can be implemented to obtain an understanding of the hydrodynamics and flow pattern in the immobilized PBR and applied for the scale-up."
12,Required steps to perform techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen production by a bacteria immobilized process,"The energy demand was raised in the last decade in parallel to the increasing human population in the world. Biohydrogen has become an alternative, renewable, and clean fuel to meet the energy requirement. However, there are challenges to achieving a sustainable production system in the biohydrogen area. The hydrogen production from biological routes is still far from being effective since HPR and HY are low and expensive than other fuel options [100–102]. For commercial and viable biohydrogen, there are costs associated with feedstocks, capital investment and operating costs [103,104]. Reforming of gases (natural and biogas) is the current leading method in commercial hydrogen production. Coal and biomass gasification are also used as a traditional way but they depend on fossil fuels and are highly energy-intensive. Electrolysis and electrohydrogenesis are expensive methods that require expensive electrodes thus are not economically favorable yet [105]. In photobiological hydrogen production, more research and development are required to achieve and become a feasible and competitive route. In immobilized PBRs, the number of cells is higher than the suspension culture in the unit area in the reactor system. In contrast to immobilization, suspension systems require large PBR volume and ground area thereby increasing the cost of the system. Immobilized systems offer the economic advantage of the reuse of immobilized material in the subsequent operations. However, for a sustainable techno-economic aspect, more scientific research must be carried out in immobilized culture and PBRs. Some of the major techno-economic aspects of hydrogen production by the immobilized system are shown in Fig. 9 . Unfortunately, there are a limited number of reports in the cost analysis of immobilized cultures in literature. The cost of photobiological hydrogen is estimated as 2.8$/kg H2 through photofermentation by using solar energy and organic biomass [14,106]. PBR design and process optimization are key components to build an economic option. More emphasis is needed in the areas of design, configuration, biochemistry, and microbiology of the microorganisms involved in the process. Especially, research efforts on molecular genetics and bioengineering are crucial to overcoming the main barriers including the production rate and yield of hydrogen. Decentralized hydrogen production by using biomass (wastes), developing hydrogen infrastructure and refueling stations are considered to decrease the cost of biohydrogen, thereby needs more attention [107]. The ultimate hydrogen target is to keep the cost below 2$/kg H2 for a commercial and competitive fuel option [108]. There are a limited number of studies on pilot scale immobilized systems in the literature. Therefore, researchers should focus on scale-up studies and bring down biohydrogen costs by using favorable technology. Also, cost analysis of immobilized PBRs is suggested in the future studies to fulfill this gap."
13,Analytical Hierarchy Process approach in immobilized system,"As stated, various parameters have effects on hydrogen production in a cell immobilized system. Thus, a rational multi-criteria decision-making process is crucial to construct a viable hydrogen synthesis process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is introduced [109] as a useful tool in a decision-making problem which works by stating the problem, presenting and quantifying its parameters, connecting these elements to final aims, and assessing the alternative solutions. The method consists of multiple levels and steps to decompose a problem then structuring it in a path to maximize consistency of subjective judgments and have been used for solvent selection in the pharmaceutical process [110], choosing an appropriate location for a solar power plant [111], establishing a decision-making approach and tool for sustainable energy [112], energy planning [113], process safety evaluation [114], assessing problems in process engineering [115] and hydrogen economy [116]. The AHP approach has been studied as a multiple criteria decision-making methodology in a different field related to hydrogen. As examples in hydrogen production research, Heo et al. [117] used fuzzy-AHP for selecting the hydrogen production method considering costs, risks, and opportunities. Besides, Lee et al. [118] implemented the fuzzy-AHP for prioritizing hydrogen production processes in a technology roadmap and assessed national competitiveness in the hydrogen production processes section [119]. The AHP is also used to investigate the hydrogen generation pathways [120] and the sustainability analysis of various hydrogen production processes [121]. Thengane et al. [122] conducted the cost-benefit analysis to compare various hydrogen generation processes implementing the AHP and the Fuzzy-AHP. Despite the AHP's great potential in providing a pathway for improving the hydrogen synthesis by a cell immobilized process, it has not been implemented yet. This can be attributed to different reasons for instance lack of required judgments from outdoor pilot-scale condition experiments. It worth mentioning the AHP can be used in related sub-issues such as PBR selection since reactor evaluation by the AHP is successfully conducted [123–125]. In order to do that a three-level model can be constructed as presented in Fig. 10 . In the first level, the objective of the analysis is defined. Then, in second-level functions required for PBR (e.g. scalability, handling, safety, etc.) are determined and weighed based on pairwise comparisons. In the level three reactor types (e.g. flat panel, plug flow, circulatory flow, etc.) are defined. Thus a scale of the relative importance of a criterion to other criteria should be prepared. Then by establishing a matrix and solving that the consistency ratio will be determined and finally decision vector will be ready. The major point is performing the pairwise comparisons which are provided based on an expert's judgment and experience. This process can be extended to other sections of cell immobilized systems to make decisions."
14,Immobilized systems versus suspension systems,"Microbial cells have been cultivated mostly in suspended systems in biohydrogen production studies. Even though it is a widespread system, some hurdles in the process of the suspension culture such as mixing, separation of phases, and low HPRs and HYs led the researchers to find alternative approaches to tackle them [66] (Table 4 ). Immobilization technology is used in particular to enhance hydrogen production, yield, and rate in biohydrogen research [74]. This technology offers the advantages of using high cell concentrations in the reactor, the operability of the process in the growth phase for a long time, smaller volume requirement than suspension cultures, providing relatively more stable activity, and resistance to contamination, side products, and inhibitors [72,126]. These advantages of immobilization reduce the overall cost of the system compared to suspension cultures. There are many reports in the literature on cell immobilization indicating an improvement in hydrogen production. In one of the previous studies, the cells of Rhodopseudomonas palustris DSM131 were immobilized by using different materials such as agar, agarose, carrageenan, and alginate. The results showed that hydrogen production by alginate-immobilized bacteria from mandelate, benzoyl formate, cinnamate, and benzoate was twice as high as the suspended culture [127]. One of the goals of cell immobilization is to protect bacteria from the inhibitory effect of the metabolites in the environment. For example, it is presented that ammonium (NH4 +) inhibits the activity of nitrogenase in photosynthetic bacteria [128]. In related research, various materials such as cationic polyelectrolytes, polyethyleneimine, and trimethyl ammonium glycol chitosan iodide were used to entrap Rhodobacter sphaeroides RV to circumvent the inhibitory effect of ammonium (NH4 +). Biohydrogen production was enhanced by the chitosan immobilized bacteria despite the presence of ammonium. Also, chitosan increased the resistance against diffusion of NH4 + in the matrix but not that of negatively charged lactate which was used as the carbon source [129]. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of ammonium was prevented by agar gel-immobilized Rhodobacter sphaeroides in a study where hydrogen was produced using wastewater of tofu factory [130]. In a report by Pandey and Pandey [131], reverse micelles were used as microreactors to entrap the whole cells of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides and Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1. Notably, the microreactor system protected nitrogenase from the inhibitory effect of oxygen. Also, hydrogen production was increased by 25–35 times by immobilization. One of the main bottlenecks of immobilized cultures in photosynthetic systems is insufficient light penetration and light distribution. Besides, in immobilized cultures, undesired color formation in the reactor medium may further lead to limited light penetration. These factors overall affect the light conversion efficiency of the system [42]. Similarly, it was noted that the dark color of the medium at high concentration (20 mM) of beet molasses caused relatively lower hydrogen production and yield than lower concentrations [71]. Thus, it can be inferred that transparent carriers can be more advantageous than the others in photosynthesis dependent systems. Also, the light source has a major role together with the wavelength of the light. LED light has been reported to have higher photosynthetic efficiency than other sources such as tungsten, halogen, and incandescent lamps [66]. Besides, the thickness and color of the support material should allow easy transmission of light towards the photosystem of the cell. Also, photosynthetic antenna pigments reduce photosynthetic light conversion efficiency, which is mostly close to 0.1% and less than 1%. Therefore, mutants of antenna pigments can be an option to improve hydrogen production by enhancing the light conversion efficiency at high light intensity [22]. On the other hand, genetic engineering might be used to improve the strains against light saturation via modification or alteration of certain genes [76]. The main approaches to improve hydrogen generation is illustrated in Fig. 11 . Furthermore, the homogenous distribution of the cells plays a vital role in immobilized cultures. The distribution of the cells on support is proportional to the number of enzymes involved in hydrogen production, especially by nitrogenase activity per unit area [84]. Therefore, this will eventually contribute to overall conversion efficiency. The cells could also suffer from the shading effect where cells prevent light transmission to other cells found in the bottom relative to the neighbors. This could be overcome by designing PBRs with high surface to volume ratio or inserting an internal light system which can provide uniformity in light distribution [77]. Some of the studies in suspension cultures were compared with the immobilized culture on various substrates (Table 5 ). It can be said that organic acids (acetic, malic acid, etc.) are more suitable substrates as higher HPRs were achieved through photofermentation by both suspension and immobilized cultures. On the other hand, single-stage photofermentation and immobilization offer an alternative approach by enhancing HPR and HY when carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose are used as feed."
15,Concluding remarks and future prospects,"Advances and recent studies on biohydrogen production by immobilized photosynthetic bacteria were covered and reviewed in the present work. Reuse of the immobilized system for a long time provides an important advantage over suspension cultures. In addition to increasing cell stability, relatively higher hydrogen yields and rates make immobilized systems more attractive. Although several efforts have been made to generate hydrogen, there are still some issues to be addressed for a viable production system. In fact, producing hydrogen in small-scale reactors will not reveal the issue of hydraulics as well as heat and mass transfer. For instance, there is not a report of a large volume (more than 100 L) immobilized reactor. To identify and overcome the barriers, a considerable size immobilized reactor should be implemented. This will pay the way for future industrial-scale hydrogen production. Furthermore, running PBRs in real outdoor conditions is very limited in the literature. Sagir et al. [71] conducted hydrogen production in spring and summer real outdoor conditions, however performing experiments in the cold and winter weather condition is still missing. It seems that critical heat transfer modeling is necessary to estimate the required amount of energy for providing an optimum reaction condition. There are some issues to consider when designing and configuring an immobilized system. For instance, light transmission through the cell must be carefully considered and handled. Although different materials are available for immobilization purposes, there is no single material and immobilization technique that is perfect in all respects. A combination of various materials with advantageous properties such as transparent, porous, robust, etc. can be used for immobilization to maximize the overall efficiency. A variety of strategies might be developed such as genetically modified high temperature and light intensity tolerated strains, heterologous enzyme transfer, or metabolic engineering for the elimination of some competing pathways for H2 production. Presently, hydrogen production through biological routes has higher costs than other biofuels. Besides, it is worth to mention that performing a detailed techno-economic analysis is vital in order to map the impacts of different parameters on the final hydrogen price. Then, efforts can be directed toward decreasing them. In addition, performing the AHP will pay the way for the best decision to make in an immobilized system. Studies and efforts on process optimization, genetic modifications, metabolic engineering, reactor design, and configuration are considered to alleviate the limitations of biological hydrogen production. Although biofilm is an encouraging approach, further research is necessary for reducing the time required for biofilm formation, enhancing mass transfer through the biofilm matrix, improving light conversion efficiency and light distribution, development of BPBRs at low cost and efficient designs and configurations. Although hydrogen is a clean and promising energy carrier there are issues related to its storage and handling which has been review recently by Abe and coworkers recently [137]. On the other hand, comparing and assessing the biomass biological conversion to other energy sources such methane was not the aim of this study and can be finding elsewhere."
