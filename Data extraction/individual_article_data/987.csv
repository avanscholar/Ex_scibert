0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is abundant, cheap and biodegradable feedstock to generate value-added products by anaerobic digestion process [1]. Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is one of the major lignocellulosic by-products generated in the Brazilian sugarcane industry (250 kg bagasse per each ton of processed sugarcane). It is estimated that there is sugarcane bagasse surplus of 12.0 and 8.0% in autonomous or annexed sugar mills and ethanol distilleries, respectively [2], justifying its application in biological process for the conversion into value-added chemicals [3]. SCB mainly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a polysaccharide of cellobiose (glucose disaccharide) linked via beta-1,4 glycosidic linkages. Cellulose chains are interlinked by van derWaals forces and hydrogen bonds forming high tensile strength microfibris. It is formed by amorphous (low crystallinity) and crystalline (high crystallinity) regions. Hemicellulose links the cellulose microfibrils and both are covered by lignin [4]. This complex structure renders SCB resistant to biological and chemical attacks. In this sense, pretreatments which break down the lignocellulosic biomass, and make it easily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars [5] are a key step for SCB bioconversion. There are many different pretreatments such as physical, chemical, and biological approaches. Hydrothermal treatment, in which the SBC is maintained in pressurized liquid hot water and then quickly depressurized, is an attractive option to improve the breakdown of hemicellulose into free sugars, favoring its conversion into biotechnological products by fermentative bacteria [6]. Besides the pretreatment, there are many other factors that affect the bacterial growth in anaerobic bioreactors, such as substrate and nitrogen availability. Yeast Extract (YE) is a nitrogen source which stimulates the cellular bacterial growth and consequently improves hydrogen production [7]. The type of substrate and concentration also affects the biological hydrogen production [8]. Therefore, the identification of optimal nutrient and substrate concentration for improving hydrogen production is a knowledge gap in lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion. The taxonomic and functional profiles of the microorganisms responsible for lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion are scarce, although information about the composition and activity of the microbial consortium is critical to optimize reactor performance. The main molecular approach applied to analyze the microbial community structure in bioreactors include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and the sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons [9]. To evaluate the microbial communities related to linear alkylbenzene sulfonate biodegradation. However this tools does not provide consistent insights about the functional profile [10] and exhibits many limitations, such as several artifacts related to PCR amplification and sequencing errors [11]. In this sense, the application of the metagenomics approach is imperative to correlate the phylogenetic and metabolic potential of microbial communities. Therefore, in this paper, response surface methodology (RSM) was carried out to optimize the hydrogen production using hydrothermal SCB as substrate. Finally, the microbial communities from the high hydrogen performance batch reactor was evaluated by the metagenomic approach, providing a clear understanding of the taxonomic and functional profile from the microorganisms and to establish a collection of cellulolytic, fermenter and methanogenic microbial genomes that will simplify future studies regarding the bioconversion of complex biomass into biotechnology products."
1,Material and methods,
2,Microorganisms and culture conditions,"2.1 Microorganisms and culture conditions The anaerobic consortium was obtained from a mixed culture from soil and composting residue (4.86 g/L of total solids, 2.55 g/L of volatile solids). To obtain the fermentative and cellulolytic consortium, food-waste composting was collected in University of São Paulo at São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC/USP), Brazil, where this research takes place. Similarly, soil samples were collected close to a sugarcane plantation near EESC/USP. For this, 100 g of soil and composting residue were sieved (mesh of 2 mm) and then added in Erlenmeyer flask containing 900 mL of dissociation solution (0.1% sodium pyrophosphate and 0.1% Tween 80), 50 g of glass beads (5 mm) and maintained under stirring for 20 min at room temperature. The liquid fraction was used as inoculum for batch reactors. Each inoculum (soil and composting residue) were acclimated separately for 48 h in 300 mL of cellulose anaerobe medium [12], supplemented with 1 g/L yeast extract and 1 g/L carboxymethyl cellulose Sigma-Aldrich® (St. Louis, USA). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the incubation temperature was 37 °C. The cellulose anaerobe medium consisted of (g/L) NaHCO3, 2.1; NH4Cl, 6.8; (NH4)2SO4, 0.15; MgSO4, 0.12; KH2PO4, 0.18; K2HPO4, 0.296; CaCl2, 0.061; Fe2(SO4)3, 0.021; C6H9NO6, 0.015; NaCl, 0.1; MnSO4, 0.005; CoCl2, 0.0001; ZnSO4, 0.0001; CuSO4, 0.0001; AlK(- SO4)2, 0.0001; H3BO3, 0.0001; Na2MoO4, 0.0001; and vitamin solutions (10 ml/L). Finally, both inoculums (50-50% v-v) were mixed in a single reactor."
3,Sugarcane bagasse pretreatment,"2.2 Sugarcane bagasse pretreatment The sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was obtained from São Martinho sugar mill (Pradópolis, Brazil). The SCB was pretreated using a hydrothermal system of 100 mL capacity at 200 °C for 10 min at 16 bar. After the hydrothermal pretreatment the solid phase was separated from the liquid phase by vacuum filtration; the SCB fiber was air dried until constant weight, stored at room temperature, and used as substrate in batch reactors."
4,Central composite design,"2.3 Central composite design CCD was used to optimize the hydrogen production from hydrothermal pretreated SCB. Two independent variables, namely yeast extract concentration and SCB concentration were studied at five levels ( ±1; 0; ±1.42) with three repetitions at the central point and two replicates at axial and factorial points. The variable ranges (center point) of YE concentration and SCB concentration were determined to be 2 and 5 g/L, respectively (Table 1 ), resulting in total of 11 conditions. The analysis of the experimental data were performed using the Statstica 7.0 software. Test factors of Xi were coded as xi and appeared in the equation (1). (1) x i = ( X i − X 0 ) = Δ X Where Xi is the value of the independent variable; xi is the coded value of the variable Xi; X0 is the value of Xi at the center point, and ΔX is the step change value. A linear model was used to optimize the media compositions (Equation (2)), using the significant coded values. (2) Y = b 0 + b 1 X 1 + b 2 X 2 Where Y is the predicted response; b0 is a constant; X1 and X2 are the dependent variables (YE and SCB, respectively) b1 and b2 are the linear coefficients for the dependent variables (X1 and X2, respectively)."
5,Batch reactors,"2.4 Batch reactors The experiments were performed in triplicate in the 1 L batch reactor with 500 mL working volume composed of culture medium [12], inoculum 10% v/v and the substrate, and 500 mL of headspace submitted to N2 (100%) for 10 min. The pH of all experiments was adjusted to 6.0. The reactors were incubated at 37 °C for 400 h, until the hydrogen plateau was reached."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The hydrogen and methane were determined by gas chromatography using a GC 2010 Shimadzu system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT column (30 m × 0.53 mm) according to [13]. The organic acids and ethanol were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV diode array detector (SPD-M10 AVP), a refraction index detector (RID-10 A), a CTO-20 A oven an LC-10 ADVP Pump, an SCL 10 AVP control and column HPX-87H from Aminex, with 300 mm × 7.8 mm (BioRad). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01 N) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate [14]."
7,Kinetic analysis,"2.6 Kinetic analysis The experimental data was adjusted to the average values obtained from triplicates using the software package Statistica® 8.0. The data of the accumulated hydrogen production was adjusted using the Gompertz equation, modified by Ref. [15] (Equation (3)). (3) H = P ⋅ exp { − exp [ R m ⋅ e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where: P – Potential production of H2 (mmol/L), Rm – Production Rate of H2 (mmol/L.h), t – time of incubation (h), e − Euler number (2.71828) and λ – time to start the H2 production (h)."
8,Taxonomic and functional analysis of metagenomic data from the high hydrogen performance batch reactor,"2.7 Taxonomic and functional analysis of metagenomic data from the high hydrogen performance batch reactor The DNA extraction from the high hydrogen production reactor (OPT) was carried out using acid-washed glass beads (Sigma®), followed by washing consecutively with phenol and chloroform according to [16]. The library preparation and metagenomic sequencing were performed at MR DNA (www.mrdnalab.com, Shallowater, TX, USA) following the manufacturer's (Illumina) guidelines. The samples were prepared using the NextEra DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and the insert size was determined using the Experion Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-Rad). The sequencing was performed using the Illumina platform HiSeq 2 × 150 bp. The sequences from the OPT reactor were annotated according to the instruction from the MG-RAST server version 3.5 [17]. Artificial and low qualities sequences were removed according protocols described by Ref. [18], and [19], respectively, using the default parameters. For taxonomic profiles, the best score classification at a maximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identification of 60%, and a minimum alignment length of 15 against SEED database [20] were utilized. For functional profiles, the reads were annotated against the KEGG database and SEED [21] subsystem databases, with default parameters. The enzyme functions and its specific pathways were verified using the analysis tools available on the KEGG web service (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The sequencing reads were deposited in the Metagenomic Rapid Annotation (MG-RAST) server with accession numbers mgm4734362.3."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of yeast extract and sugarcane bagasse concentration on the hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of yeast extract and sugarcane bagasse concentration on the hydrogen production The impact of the YE and SCB concentration on the hydrogen production from hydrothermally pretreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was statistically analyzed by CCD. The YE and substrate concentrations had a linear influence on hydrogen production. The factors above 95% confidence levels were considered significant. Table 2 shows the matrix for CCD along with the experimental and predicted values. The lowest hydrogen production (0.28 mmol/L) was obtained at the lowest YE concentration (0.58 g/L) and 5.00 g/L of substrate (C9) In contrast, the highest hydrogen (1.53 mmol/L) production was obtained at the highest YE concentration (3.42 g/L) and 5.00 g/L of SCB (C8). As the same SCB concentration (5.00 g/L) was used in both condition (C8 and C9), the observed difference in the hydrogen production, between C8 and C9, was due to the variation on the YE concentration which reached the maximum and minimum values (3.42 and 0.58 g/L in C8 and C9, respectively). The adequacy of the model was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) as shown in Table 3 . By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental results, the polynomial equation was obtained to describe the hydrogen production using the coded independent variables (Equation (4)). (4) Y ( mmol/L ) = 0 . 872 + 0 . 253 X 1 + 0 . 268 X 2 Where Y is the predicted hydrogen production (mmol/L), X1 is the coded value for the yeast extract concentration and X2 is the coded value for substrate concentration. The optimum level of the independent variables and their interaction on the hydrogen production were evaluated by response surface plot (Fig. 1 ). The response surface plot showed that the optimum hydrogen production could be obtained, while the YE and substrate concentration were high. The bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel requires nitrogen availability, which in the right balance can provide optimum product yield [22]. The nitrogen availability is one of the most crucial factors for microbial growth due to its structural role for microbial cell. The YE addition on the culture medium is one way to achieve the nitrogen supplementation. The substrate concentration is another crucial factor which affects the hydrogen production and the hydrolysis rate from lignocellulosic biomass, such as SCB. High substrate concentration can be unfavorable to mass transfer, leading to low efficiency of the bioconversion process. Additionally, high substrate concentration can produce high acid concentration which inhibits the cellulolytic activity and decreases the hydrogen yield [23]. In contrast, low substrate concentration results in low metabolite production rates and short fermentation duration [24]. So, the optimum substrate concentration depends on the physical-chemical substrate characteristics and microorganisms used in the process [25]. In the present study, low hydrogen productions (0.50, 0.31, and 0.60 mmol/L) were observed using low SCB concentrations (3.58, 4.00, and 4.00 g/L, respectively). In the same way, high hydrogen productions (0.95, 0.98, 1.04, 1.05, 1.06, 1.30, and 1.53 mmol/L) were observed using the highest SCB concentrations applied in this study (6.00, 6.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 6.42, and 5.00 g/L, respectively). Pattra and co-workers [25] evaluated the effect of substrate concentration (SCB hydrolyzed) in batch reactor inoculated with Clostridium butyricum TISTR 1032 in mesophilic condition (37 °C). In these conditions, the highest hydrogen production (8.03 mmol/L) was reported at 20 g COD/L of substrate and decreased to 6.70 mmol/L at 40 g COD/L, probably because the increase of the substrate concentration led to the increase of hydrogen to a certain extent and then had a negative effect due to reduced hydrogen. In agreement with Pattra and co-workers the increase of substrate concentration from 5.00 to 6.00 g/L reduced hydrogen production from 1.53 to 0.95 mmol/L with 3.42 and 3.00 g/L of YE, respectively. When the substrate concentration exceeds the optimal value, the hydrogen-producing bacteria overproduce inhibitory metabolites, such as volatile acids, which accumulate at the early stage of hydrogen production, and consequently decrease the pH in the medium, leading to low hydrogen production [26], which in this study was confirmed by the low pH at the end of fermentation (approximately pH 5.5)."
11,Fermentative pathways and metabolites,"3.2 Fermentative pathways and metabolites The main organic acids produced were acetic, butyric, and propionic (Table 4 ). In the conditions C1, C2, Central point, and C8 the main produced acid was acetic acid (218.23, 407.42, 459.31, and 491.53 mg/L, respectively). In the present study, high hydrogen production was obtained under these conditions (0.95, 0.98, 1.05, and 1.53 mmol/L, respectively). In the same way, in conditions C3, C4, C9, C10, and C11 the butyric was the most produced acid (648.41, 645.77, 638.85, 1117.98, and 899.55 mg/L, respectively). The low hydrogen productions were observed under these conditions (0.60, 0.31, 0.28, and 0.50 in C3, C4, C9, and C11, respectively). Propionic acid was observed in all conditions. The generation of propionic acid is harmful to hydrogen production because 1 mol of propionic acid requires 2 mol of hydrogen [27]. There is no significant effect of YE and substrate concentration on the organic acid production (p-value higher than 0.1). The highest organic acid concentration was obtained in C10 (1525.03 mg/L). High hydrogen production was observed under this condition (1.30 mmol/L), indicating that the conditions applied favored the fermentative metabolism. Methane production was observed in C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, and C11 (Table 5 ). The highest methane production (1.47 mmol/L) was obtained in C2 (6.00 and 1.00 g/L SCB and YE concentration, respectively). Hydrogen (0.98 mmol/L) and acetic acid (407.42 mg/L) were observed in this condition, and were probably consumed as substrate by methanogenic archaea. There is no significant effect of YE and substrate concentration on the methane production (p-value higher than 0.1)."
12,Experimental validation of the hydrogen production model,"3.3 Experimental validation of the hydrogen production model The statistical model was validated by assays using 2.77 g/L of YE and 5.84 g/L of SCB. Under these conditions, the predicted model response for hydrogen production was 1.26 mmol/L, against the observed values of 1.50 mmol/L (Fig. 2 ). The experimental value was close to the predicted value."
13,Taxonomic profile of the microbial community in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor,"3.4 Taxonomic profile of the microbial community in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor The high hydrogen production (1.53 mmol/L) was obtained using 3.42 and 5.00 g/L of YE and SCB, respectively (C8). In total, this reactor contains 20, 893, 538 sequences totaling 3,546, 593, 502 base pairs with an average length of 170 bps. Concerning the Bacteria domain, the phylum Firmicutes was the most abundant (50.02%). The crucial step for the efficient bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass involves the breakdown of the cellulosic structure [28], however fewer bacteria are able to hydrolyze plant biomass, such as those that belong to the classes Clostridia and Bacilli [29]. As expected, the overwhelming majority of the identified abundant bacteria in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor were members of the classes Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Bacilli (44.22, 29.89, and 5.27%, respectively). At the genus level, there are over 320 different taxa, demonstrating the microbial diversity of the high hydrogen performance batch reactor. Among the Clostridia, the genus Clostridium occurred most frequently (relative abundance of 33%). This genus includes bacteria that can hydrolyze cellulose by means of an extracellular multi-enzymatic complex, the cellulosome [28]. The cellulosome which was first described in Clostridium thermocellum, is a macromolecular, multi-component, extracellular complex of cellulolytic proteins that mediates cellulose degradation [30]. The most abundant identified genera (relative abundance above 2%) are listed in Fig. 3 . The high proportion of Clostridium suggests an important role of these bacteria in the efficient bioconversion of the complex substrate in anaerobic bioreactor. Their role in the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass may be due to the high cellulolytic activity of many members of this genus as well as their capability to perform numerous fermentation pathways. Among the Clostridium genus, species such as C. acetobutilycum, C. thermocellum, and C. saccharolyticum can efficiently degrade cellulolytic biomass and exerts hydrogen-producing activities [29]. The outstanding strictly anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium from the genus Bacteroides ferments glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, xylose, galactose, ribose, melibiose, mannose, lactulose, galacturonic acids, pectin, starch and cellulose to acetic, propionic, and succinic acids production [31]. In contrast, the genus Porphyromonas has noteworthy substrate specificity, as it can use essential amino acids and produce organic acids, such as acetic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids [32]. Organic acids, mainly acetic and propionic, were also generated by the strictly anaerobic bacteria such as the genus Parabacteroides. The genus Desulfitobacterium includes species able to degrade syringate, vanillate, and isovanillate, which are phenyl methyl ethers mainly released by the decomposition of lignin macrostructure [33], and probably had a potential role in the conversion of these intermediate metabolites in this study. A prominent and well-characterized genus is the Bacillus, which is an important cellulase - producing bacteria [34] and consequently, has lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion potential. The enzymes from the genus Bacillus hold exceptional interest for a large-scale biotechnological process, mainly due to its thermostability [35]. It is important to note that the hydrogen, acetic acid, and CO2 produced by the bacterial genera discussed above, could be substrates for the hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenic archaea. Around 5% of the overall identified microorganisms in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor belonged to the Archaea. The genus Methanothermobacter predominates in the community (40.0% of archaeal community). Interestingly, the same archaea has been reported in many methanogenic bioreactors [36,37]. The genus Methanothermobacter, includes species with strong preference for hydrogen as substrate [38]. The predominance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that methane is produced mainly by hydrogenotrophic pathway, and acetoclastic methanogenesis develops a secondary role in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor treating SCB. Besides Methanothermobacter, other abundant hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea were found in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor, such as Methanobrevibacter, Methanocullens, Methanosphaerula, Methanocorpusculum, and Methanosphaer. Acetic acid stimulates the growth of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta (relative abundance of 11.0 and 1.0%, respectively), although Methanonarcina prefers methylated compounds such as Methanol and Methylamines, while Methanosaeta uses only acetic acid. Due to the specificity of Methanosaeta with acetic acid, this genus is widely distributed in the environment and prevails over Methanosarcina in the low acetic acid availability [39], which occurs in anaerobic systems."
14,Functional characterization of the high hydrogen performance batch reactor,"3.5 Functional characterization of the high hydrogen performance batch reactor To expose the functional profile of the high hydrogen performance reactor, the reads were annotated according to the categories of SEED, subsystem, and KEEG databases. The subsystems carbohydrates category was the most abundant (16.22%), followed by clustering-based subsystems (12.30%), amino-acids and derivatives (9.96%), and protein metabolism (9.21%) (Fig. 4 ). Analyzing the subsystems carbohydrates category, the monosaccharides, central carbohydrates metabolism, di and oligosaccharides, fermentation, and one-carbon metabolism were the most abundant categories (21.16, 19.37, 14.46, 8.69, and 7.09%, respectively). Many enzymes in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor, annotated with high read numbers, are related to the cellulose degradation, such as cellulase [EC: 3.2.1.4] responsible for the endohydrolysis of (1,4)-beta-d-glucosidase linkages on cellulose, and beta-glucosidase [EC:3.2.1.21] responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing beta-d-glucosyl residues to release beta-d-glucose. Glucose is the mainstay of the cellulose, however hemicellulose contains other sugars, such as xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, besides glucose, which result in a complex and recalcitrant nature [40]. Approximately 13% of the metabolism of monosaccharides were related to xylose metabolism, such as xylulose kinase [EC:2.7.1.17], xylose isomerase [EC: 5.3.1.5], and beta-xylosidase [EC:3.2.1.37]. Xylanases and xylosidase participate in the xylan metabolism, one of the most important constituents of hemicellulose [40]. In particular, xylooligosaccharides can be produced from xylanases and used for many purposes, such as food, pharmaceutical industries and in innovative and promising areas such as renewable energy sources and biofuel production [41]. Since the major constituent of hemicelulose is mannan, the beta–mannosidases enzyme (EC 3.2.1.25) that can catalyze the hydrolysis of beta-1,4-linked mannosides, releasing mannose from the non-reducing end of mannans and mannan oligosaccharides [42], had an important role in the lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion. Beta-galactosidase [EC: 3.2.1.23] degrades galactose through the breaking of a beta-galactosidic bond and l-arabinose isomerase [EC: 5.3.1.4], which catalyzes the conversion of arabinose and, less efficiently, converts galactose into tagatose. Additionally, in the present study, the codifying genes of enzymes related to the bioconversion of starch were identified, such as α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), and fructose metabolism such as UDP-d-xylose 4-epimerase (EC5.3.1.5). Starch is one of the principal storage products in lignocellulosic biomass, and its hydrolysis results in the production of maltodextrin, modified starches, or glucose and fructose syrups. The cleavage of the 1–4 glycosidic bonds of the amylose or amylopectin chain is developed by the endoamylases such as α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), [43]. The conversion of high glucose syrup into high fructose syrup is performed by the UDP-d-xylose 4-epimerase enzyme (EC 5.3.1.5) [43]. Lignin degradation is also indispensable for the efficient accessibility of hemicellulases and cellulases to promote the hydrolysis of complex biomass. In this sense, the glycolate oxidase enzyme [EC:1.1.3.15] which oxidizes aromatic compounds, such as lignin, was found in the high hydrogen performance reactor. During the anaerobic digestion, the hydrolysis step is followed by the acidogenic pathway, which is characterized by the production of organic acids (formic, acetic, butyric, propionic, and lactic), and ethanol [40]. The generation of formate was mediated by the pyruvate formate-lyase enzyme [EC:2.3.1.54] and the lactic acid production was catalyzed by both l-lactate dehydrogenase [EC: 1.1.1.27] and lactate-malate transhydrogenase [1.1.99.7] enzymes. Similarly, the ethanol production, developed in the high hydrogen performance batch reactor was performed by many enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase [1.2.4.1], which converted pyruvate into 2-hydroxy-ethyl-ThPP, which was subsequently transformed into acetaldehyde by the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme [4.1.1.1], and finally it was converted into ethanol by the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme [EC: 1.1.1.1]. Acetic, butyric, and propionic acids were also produced in this study, and different enzymes participated in these pathway, such as acetate coA-ligase [EC: 6.2.1.13], propionate coA-ligase [6.2.1.17], and butyrate kinase [EC: 2.7.2.7]. At the acetogenic stage of anaerobic digestion, the organic acids, hydrogen and CO2 produced during the acidogenesis step were converted to acetic acid by obligate hydrogen-producing acetogenic or homoacetogenic bacteria, using the acetyl co-A synthetase [EC: 6.2.1.1] as the key enzyme. Finally, the last stage of the anaerobic digestion is performed by methanogenic archaea, producing methane as the end products. This process includes acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways. For methylotrophic methanogenesis, the methanol is converted into methane with the methyl CoM as intermediate by the methyl-CoM reductase enzyme [EC: 2.8.4.1]. In relation to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, CO2 is converted to methane through the formation of many intermediates by the action of different enzymes, including anaerobic carbonomonoxide dehydrogenase [EC:1.2.7.4], tetrahydromethanopterin methyltransferase [EC: 2.1.1.86], and methyl-CoM reductase [2.8.4.1]. For acetoclastic methanogenesis, methane is produced from the acetic acid, which is firstly converted into the key metabolite intermediate acetyl-CoA by the acetate kinase enzyme [EC: 2.7.2.1] associated with phosphate acetyltransferase [EC: 2.3.1.8]. Then, acetyl-CoA is converted into a methyl group and later to methane, using the methyl-CoM reductase enzyme [2.8.4.1]. The main enzymes, its reaction and the major intermediates produced during the four stages of anaerobic digestion are described in Table 6 ."
15,Conclusion,"Both independent variables (substrate and yeast extract concentration) had significant effect on the hydrogen production, which reached 1.50 mmol/L under the optimized condition (2.77 g/L of YE and 5.84 g/L of SCB). The hydrogen production was accomplished by the acetic, butyric, and propionic acid production. The bioconversion of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was performed by hydrolysers, acidogenic, acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms working together. The high abundance of Clostridium, which is the main fermenting bacteria, could be an indicative of the important contribution of these bacteria to the efficient bioconversion of the complex substrate such as SCB. In the same way the Methanothermobacter was the predominant methanogenic archaeal genus, strongly suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be the dominant pathway in the system."
