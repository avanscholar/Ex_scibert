0,Introduction,"During the biomass gasification process, a large amount of tar (complex compounds of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly including toluene, phenol, naphthalene et al.) inevitably generates and blends with the product gas due to the high volatile of biomass. It decreases the system efficiency and easily causes severe fouling, corrosion and clogging of downstream pipes and applications [1,2]. Catalytic steam reforming of tar to H2-rich syngas is considered as one of the most efficient and economical route to remove tar, and Ni-based catalysts have been widely used due to their high activity in cleavage of C–C and C–H bonds and relatively low cost in comparison with noble metal catalysts (such as Pb, Ru) [3–6]. However, Ni-based catalysts are prone to be deactivated by coke deposition which covers the active sites and destroys the structure of catalyst [7,8]. Different types of coke including amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes and/or carbon nanofibers were proved to deposit on the surface of Ni-based catalysts [9–11]. Our previous work found that the amount and quality of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) would significantly improve under some certain reforming conditions (catalyst support [12], steam addition [13] and organic compounds [14]), and the growth of CNTs could play a positive role in catalytic performance of Ni-based catalyst. Besides, the CNTs can be collected after the separation process from developed catalysts, such as the dissolving in acid solution. CNTs, as a new kind of carbon nanomaterial with unique physical/chemical property, have numerous potential applications in the field of catalyst support, hydrogen storage, adsorption agent and nano-electronic device etc [15,16]. During tar removal process, the production of CNTs significantly enhances the economy of reforming system, and it supplies a new method to prepare low-cost CNTs. Thus the co-production of hydrogen and CNTs through catalytic reforming of biomass tar was put forward in our researches. Reaction temperature is an important factor to affect tar conversion, H2 yield and CNTs production. The increasing temperature remarkably improves the reforming reaction rate [17,18]. Hu et al [19] reported that carbon conversion and H2 selectivity increased more than 80% and 30%, respectively with the temperature increasing from 300 °C to 600 °C during steam reforming of acetic acid. Moreover, reaction temperature influences the types and growth rates of CNTs during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process [20,21]. Generally, the temperature for preparing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) ranges from 600 °C to 1150 °C, which was higher than that for preparing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (temperature range of 300–800 °C) [22]. Lee et al [23] found the growth rate of CNTs on Fe-deposited SiO2 substrates increased by four times during thermal chemical vapor deposition of acetylene gas as the growth temperature increased from 750 °C to 950 °C. Chhowalla et al [24] found that the average nanotube length on Ni/SiO2/Si film was initially increased with the substrate temperature and then decreased at higher temperature by using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The above literatures investigated the different effects of temperatures on reforming reaction for hydrogen and CVD reaction for CNTs production independently. However, both the reforming reaction and CVD reaction exist in the co-production process during steam reforming of tar, which contains not only the reforming reaction (R1) and water–gas shift (R2), but also the formation (R3) and consumption (R4) of CNTs. The raising of temperature would promote the reforming reaction (R1) to increase H2 yield, but it could reverse the chemical equilibrium of water–gas shift reaction (R2) to decrease the production of H2. Besides, the high temperature promotes the decomposition of tar (R3) to generate more amorphous carbon and CNTs, while it also enhances the water gas reaction (R4) to consume them. Especially amorphous carbon and CNTs have different formation mechanisms and consumption properties, resulting in their different behaviors with the raising of temperatures. In generally, owing to their high graphitic degree, CNTs are more difficult to be oxidized by steam than amorphous carbon [25]. Thus, for the co-production of hydrogen and CNTs, multiple competitive processes amid steam reforming and water–gas shift reaction, tar cracking and water gas reaction, as well as amorphous carbon and CNTs growth were simultaneously occurred with the increasing of reaction temperatures. Understanding these multiple competitive processes at different temperatures is necessary to optimize the co-production of hydrogen and CNTs. Until now, these processes have been rarely reported in consideration with tar removal, hydrogen and CNTs production, besides the solely reforming reaction and CVD process from literatures cannot clearly explain these multiple competitive processes during steam reforming of tar.

A series of analysis techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed oxidation coupled with mass spectrum (TPO-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the CNTs and catalyst. The effects of temperatures on the yield and quality of co-production were investigated to clarify multiple competitive processes. Besides, the decomposition reactions of toluene (without the addition of steam) were also performed to further explore the influence mechanism of temperatures on the formation of amorphous carbon and CNTs at different temperatures."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 10 wt% Ni was loaded on a support of α-Al2O3 using wet impregnation method. The detailed catalyst preparation was described elsewhere [13]. In brief, the α-Al2O3 support was obtained by calcining γ-Al2O3 (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, grain size of 0.15–0.18 mm) at 1150 °C in air for 2 h. After calcination, the support and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, analytical reagent) solution were mixed into a rotary evaporator and impregnated at 60 °C for 2 h. Then the sample was dried at 105 °C for 24 h and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 700 °C for 4 h."
3,Evaluation for catalytic performances,"2.2 Evaluation for catalytic performances Catalytic reforming tests were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. 50 mg of catalyst was diluted with 325 mg silica sand of same grain size (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent). The reaction temperatures were 500, 600, 650, 700 and 800 °C. The steam-to-carbon (S/C) molar ratio of 2 was selected from our previous investigation [13]. To highlight the effect of reaction temperature, the reaction conditions that fully eliminated the effects of both internal and external diffusion by decreasing particle size of catalyst and increasing total flow rate were determined. These experiments were described in the supplementary material. Thus the catalyst with grain size of 0.15–0.18 mm was selected. The flow rate of Ar carrier gas was 193.7 mL/min. And the molar flow rates of toluene and steam were kept at 166.6 μmol/min and 2333.3 μmol/min, respectively in the reforming experiments. The formation of coke mainly occurred in the range of 0 ~ 30 min and its amount kept stable after 30 min [26]. Reaction time of 60 min was selected in this paper. Before the reforming reaction, the catalyst and silica sand was mixed and placed in the bottom of U-type reactor (5 mm i.d.). The catalyst was reduced in 100 mL/min 50%H2/N2 flow at 700 °C for 2 h, and then purged the reactor by high purity Ar gas. When catalyst bed reached target temperature, the toluene (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, analytical reagent) and deionized water were continuously injected into an evaporator which was kept at 250 °C, and were carried by Ar gas to catalyst bed. The blank experiment proved that toluene did not crack at 250 °C. During the reforming reaction, a small part of product gas was analyzed by an on-line quadrupole mass spectrum (HPR20, Hiden Analytical Inc.). The other part of gas successively passed though ice water and ice-salt baths (containing 10 mL anhydrous alcohol solution) to remove the unreacted water and condensable organic compounds, and then collected by a gas sampling bag. After 60 min experiment, the spent catalyst and U-type reactor was weighed accurately. The amount of coke was mainly measured by the weight of fresh and spent catalyst. In order to make sure its accuracy, the weights of U-type reactor and catalyst were also tested before and after the reforming reaction. In each experiment, the deviation of two measure methods can be controlled within 0.5 mg. The components of product gas were quantified by micro-GC system (3000A, America Agilent), and toluene conversion was calculated by the following equation of R5 according to carbon molar content of CO, CO2 and CH4 in product gas. The blank and repeat experiments were conducted to ensure the accuracy of results. (R5) T C % = ( n co + n co 2 + n C H 4 ) / 7 n toluene × 100"
4,Characterization of catalyst and CNTs,"2.3 Characterization of catalyst and CNTs A series of analysis methods such as N2 isothermal adsorption–desorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were used to characterize Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The proportions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and amorphous carbon on spent catalyst were detected by temperature-programmed oxidation coupled with mass spectrometer (TPO-MS). The morphology of CNTs was characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, HITACHI) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Titan G2 60–300). Besides, Raman spectra (Horiba JobinYvon LabRAM HR800) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, VG Multilab 2000) were used to analyze the chemical structures of CNTs and amorphous carbon."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Toluene conversion and H2 production,"3.1 Toluene conversion and H2 production With reaction temperatures increasing, both toluene conversion and hydrogen yield remarkably increased, as shown in Fig. 1 (A). Toluene conversion was only 10% at 500 °C, and remarkably increased to almost 100% at 800 °C. The yield of H2 increased from 300 mmol/g-cata at 500 °C to 2500 mmol/g-cata at 800 °C, indicating that reaction temperature is a key factor to promote catalytic reforming of tar (R1). The high temperature enhances the breakage of C–C or C–H bond in toluene and remarkably increases the reaction rate. Meanwhile, the composition of product gases was varied at different reaction temperatures, as shown in Fig. 1(B). The proportion of CO gradually increased and that of H2 slightly decreased from 69% at 500 °C to 64% at 800 °C. The water–gas shift reaction (R2) was an exothermic reaction. The increasing temperature therefore inhibited this chemical reaction equilibrium of moving to the direction of hydrogen generation. For H2 production, its yield remarkably increased by 7 times while its purity decreased 5% when the temperature increased from 500 °C to 800 °C. Toluene conversion and hydrogen yield decreased with the increasing of reaction time. It mainly attributed to the suppression effect of coke deposition on catalytic activity. Different effects of coke (including amorphous carbon and CNTs) have been investigated in our previous work [12]."
7,Coke deposition and CNTs production,"3.2 Coke deposition and CNTs production 3.2.1 Coke amount at different reforming temperatures After 60 min reforming reaction, coke amounts were determined by difference of the weight of fresh and spent catalyst at different temperatures, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . The yield of coke reached a maximum amount of 240 mg/g-cata at 650 °C which is almost 3 times and 7 times more than the amount of coke generated at 500 °C and 800 °C, respectively. In the reforming reaction, the high reaction temperature promoted cracking of toluene (R3), and more precursors of coke were generated on the surface of active sites to improve the formation of coke. Meanwhile, the oxidation reaction between coke and steam (R4) was enhanced with the increasing of temperature. The coke amount at different temperatures was determined by the competitive process of coke formation and consumption. Under our reaction conditions, the higher temperature enhanced the cracking reaction to promote coke yield when the temperature was lower than 650 °C. Continuing to increase the temperature, the consumption reaction of coke was significantly enhanced, resulting in a decreasing of coke deposition. 3.2.2 Proportions of amorphous and graphitic carbon Besides coke amounts, different types of coke were generated and their proportions were remarkably varied with the increasing of temperatures. TPO-MS profiles of spent catalysts are used to analyze their proportions, which are showed in Fig. 3 (A). The peak area and oxidation temperature of CO2 signals separately represented the yield and reactivity of coke. The formation of two different types of coke (amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon) were proved in some literatures [9,10,20]. Owing to their different reactivity, they had different oxidation temperature, thus TPO curves can be divided into two peaks. The low temperature peak (T < 650 °C) and high temperature peak (T greater than 650 °C) corresponded to the oxidization of amorphous and graphitic carbon (mainly CNTs in our study), respectively [9]. Their proportions were calculated by a peak fitting method [27], and shown in Fig. 3(B). The proportion of amorphous carbon reached more than 90% at 500 °C. With reaction temperature increasing from 500 °C to 650 °C, the proportion of graphitic carbon gradually increased. It reached a maximum of 50% at 650 °C. Compared with amorphous carbon, graphitic carbon with poor reactivity was difficult to react with steam [9]. The increasing temperature accelerated the consumption of amorphous carbon, thus decreasing its proportion. On the other hand, the high temperature improved the rate of carbon diffusion through catalyst particles to promote the transformation from amorphous to graphitic carbon [28,29]. In this transformation process, the amorphous carbon films firstly cover the Ni particles, and nucleate at the metal surface and metal-graphene interface. Then graphene layers are formed and encapsulate the particles. Finally, the metal is gradually forced to flow out of the graphene layers and spread on the substrate, which is concomitantly graphitized at its surface. The low temperature peak was close to high temperature peak in the curves of 500 °C, 600 °C and 650 °C, thus one obvious peak was showed. These mainly attributes to the more defects and less amount of CNTs at 500 °C and 600 °C, and relative low reactive of amorphous carbon at 650 °C. However when the temperature increased from 650 °C to 800 °C, the proportion of graphitic carbon decreased, which exhibited the opposite trend in comparison with the changes of graphitic at low temperature range (from 500 °C to 650 °C). The decreasing of graphitic carbon at high temperature would be investigated in section 3.3. 3.2.3 Morphology of CNTs The morphology of coke at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 4 . The filamentous carbon with several micrometers was generated on the surface of catalyst at both 500 °C and 650 °C. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with the spacing between parallel graphene layers of about 0.31 nm were generated and marked in TEM images (Fig. 5 ). Their diameters mainly ranged from 10 nm to 35 nm. The yield of CNTs as a typical graphitic carbon increased remarkably when the temperature raise from 500 °C to 650 °C, which was agreed with the results of TPO-MS. Mass formation of CNTs at 650 °C covered the whole surface of catalyst. Ni particles always located at the top of CNTs as shown in Fig. 5, which indicates that the growth of CNTs mainly followed the tip-growth mechanism. From Fig. 5(C), it is clearly seen that carbon nanotube dissolved out from the bottom of Ni particle (average size around 35 nm), and the latter was separated from the Al2O3 support during the growth of CNTs. Simultaneously, Ni particle was found to have been encapsulated by graphite layer, leading to stop growing of CNTs that shortened their length. It was mainly attributed to Ni particle with large size that was not conducive to the growth of CNTs [30,31]. Excluding CNTs, the flake amorphous carbon covered the surface of Ni particle and support as marked in Fig. 5(A). However, almost no CNTs were observed on the surface of catalyst when reaction temperature was at 800 °C, and only some flake amorphous carbon were generated as shown in Fig. 4. The above results indicated that toluene was nearly all converted to syngas and a little amount of coke generated during the reforming reaction at 800 °C. Owing to the intensive oxidization effect of steam at high temperature, the adsorbed carbon species on active sites were easily reacted to produce syngas and less of them were supplied for CNTs growth. Besides, the high temperature gave rise to the sintering of Ni particles [32], which enlarged Ni particles size and suppressed the growth of CNTs. These influence mechanism of temperatures on the yield and proportion of CNTs would be verified in section 3.3. 3.2.4 Cnts quality To characterize the quality of CNTs produced at different temperatures, Raman spectra of coke deposition are shown in Fig. 6 (A). There exists three distinct peaks: the D-band, G-band and G’-band peak at approximately 1342 cm−1, 1578 cm−1 and 2680 cm−1, respectively. Generally, the ratio of D band over G band (ID/IG) represents the graphitization degree and the ratio of G’ band over G band (IG’/IG) was used to compare the content of defects. The low value of ID/IG and high value of IG’/IG represent the good quality of CNTs with high graphitization and little defects. These ratios were calculated by using the peak fitting of Lorentzian line shape [33] and the results were listed in Fig. 6(A). During reaction temperatures range from 500 °C to 800 °C, the graphitization degree had opposite change tendency with surface defects. The quality of CNTs became better firstly and reached the best at 650 °C. Compared with the quality of CNTs (ID/IG = 0.48 ~ 0.87, IG’/IG = 0.35 ~ 0.62) prepared by conventional CVD process [34,35], CNTs in our study had relative low graphitization (ID/IG = 1.28 ~ 1.36) and more defects (IG’/IG = 0.33 ~ 0.45) due to the steam addition and high proportion of amorphous carbon formation during reforming reaction. From the XPS analysis of coke as showed in Fig. 6(B), excluding C–C, the structures of C–H and C = O were generated to aggravate surface defects of CNTs. The proportion of C–C was about 60%."
8,Competitive processes of CNTs formation at different temperatures,"3.3 Competitive processes of CNTs formation at different temperatures From the above investigation, the amount and type of coke (amorphous carbon and CNTs) were influenced by the addition of steam at different temperatures. In order to clarify these influence mechanism, the experiments of catalytic decomposition of toluene (without steam addition) at same conditions as that of reforming reaction were performed, as shown in Fig. 7 . With temperature rising from 500 °C to 800 °C, coke amounts after decomposition reaction significantly enhanced. It reached the maximum of 496 mg/g-cata at 800 °C. The higher temperatures promoted cracking of toluene to stimulate the formation of coke. With the addition of steam, coke amount after reforming reaction at 800 °C was only 1/15 of that after decomposition reaction. It is proved that the reaction between coke and steam remarkably enhanced at high temperature, and the coke amount was depended on competitive process of coke formation and consumption. Same to the result of reforming reaction, few CNTs were generated at 800 °C after decomposition reaction although the largest amount of coke was formed on catalyst (as showing in Fig. 8 (A)). Thus high temperature (more than 650 °C) restrained the growth of CNTs in this reaction condition. From the XRD results of Fig. 8(B), the intensity of metal Ni after reforming reaction at 800 °C was remarkably higher than that at 650 °C. According to Scherrer equation [36], Ni average crystallite sizes were calculated and those after reforming reaction at 800 °C and 650 °C were 17.64 nm and 7.99 nm, respectively. It indicated the high reaction temperature caused to the severe sintering of Ni crystallite and enlarged their particle size [37]. However, Ni particles with large size were easily encapsulated by graphite layer, which suppressed the formation of CNTs [30,31]. Thus there were almost no CNTs formed on Ni/α-Al2O3 during catalytic steam reforming of toluene. From the above, it can be concluded that numbers of reactions affect H2 production and CNTs formation. During the decomposition process, coke amount increased due to the enhanced decomposition reaction (R3) with the increasing of temperatures. As steam was added into the system, new reactions like steam reforming of tar (R1), water–gas shift reaction (R2), and water gas reaction (R4) were also introduced. Toluene conversion and H2 yield remarkably increased. But H2 proportion slight decreased due to the suppression effect of R2 chemical reaction equilibrium at high reaction temperatures. The yield and quality of CNTs improved with the temperature from 500 °C to 650 °C, which attributed to the transformation from amorphous to CNTs and consumption of amorphous carbon by steam. However, the higher temperature aggravated the sintering of Ni particles and enlarged their particle size. These Ni were easily encapsulated by graphite layer, thus suppressed the formation of CNTs"
9,Conclusions,"Multiple competitive processes with increasing reaction temperatures were investigated for improving co-production of H2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) over Ni/α-Al2O3 during catalytic steam reforming of toluene. The high temperature remarkably increased H2 yield, but slightly decreased its purity. Coke amounts were determined by the competitive rate of formation and consumption reaction. They were initially increased and reached the maximum at 650 °C, then sharply decreased at higher temperature. Owing to the enhancing transformation from amorphous to CNTs and the good reactivity of amorphous carbon with steam, the yield and quality of CNTs were gradually enhanced with the increasing temperatures from 500 °C to 650 °C. However, the continually increasing temperature suppressed the formation of CNTs, and almost no CNTs generated at 800 °C, which was attributed to the sintering of Ni crystallite thus enlarging Ni particle sizes at high temperature."
