0,Introduction,"The massive consumption of traditional and geopolitically sensitive fossil-fuel energy resources for driving advanced industrial processes and human activities over the past few decades has triggered increased interest in the development of new technologies that enable the utilization of alternative renewable energy supplies. Among the major available renewable energy resources (i.e., solar, biomass, hydropower, wind, and geothermal), solar energy is considered the most abundant, cleanest, and most sustainable. Although the solar energy delivered to the Earth in 1 h exceeds annual global energy consumption, the conversion and utilization of this diffuse form of energy is challenging [1–4]. Semiconductor photocatalysis, which has attracted intensive attention because of its potential applications in clean energy production and environmental remediation, is regarded as the most promising technology for the direct conversion and utilization of solar energy [5,6]. Numerous transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, oxynitrides, and other semiconductor materials have already been explored as photocatalysts for this purpose [7–9]. Unfortunately, many of these materials are still far from a level of practical utilization for solar energy conversion because of their intrinsic drawbacks, which include poor solar energy harnessing ability, high fabrication costs, photocorrosion, poor reusability, and rapid charge-carrier recombination. Recently, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor, has prompted great interest because of its fascinating intrinsic properties, which include a tunable electronic structure, high elemental abundance, suitable bandgap energy (ca. 2.7 eV) for visible-light absorption, superior thermal and chemical stabilities, low cost, straightforward synthesis, and ecofriendly nature [10–12]. These extraordinary properties render g-C3N4 attractive in various fields, including the degradation of hazardous substances, photocatalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, catalysis, and sensing, among others [13,14]. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is not competitive, mainly because of the rapid recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers, which results in limited visible-light response. Thus, modification of g-C3N4 could improve its photocatalytic performance and provide access to its inherent advantages. Researchers have already investigated numerous approaches to address these limitations of g-C3N4; some successful methods include doping with foreign elements [15,16], loading noble metals [17,18], inducing textural porosity [19], and coupling with conducting materials or other semiconductors to form composites [20–22]. Among these strategies, the integration of g-C3N4 with a narrow-bandgap semiconductor with matched energy levels is by far the most promising approach to impede the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and extend the wavelength range of visible-light absorption [23]. In addition, to enhance photocatalytic performance, the catalyst should display high dispersibility to ensure efficient contact between a reaction mixture and the catalyst particles. However, such high dispersity usually introduces difficulties with respect to separating and recycling the catalysts. One approach to overcoming this limitation is magnetic separation, which is a convenient method for separating and recycling magnetized catalysts under an applied magnetic field [24,25]. This approach can also avoid agglomeration of the catalyst particles during recycling and can extend the lifetime of the catalysts [26]. Because of its relatively high dispersity in water, g-C3N4 also faces the recyclability problem, which seriously limits its practical applications. Hence, the fabrication of a magnetically separable g-C3N4-based composite catalyst would represent an important advancement. Among the various available magnetic materials, spinel ferrites (general formula: MFe2O4, where M = Zn, Sn, Cu, Ni, etc.), because of their strong magnetic properties and relatively narrow bandgap, are promising candidates for visible-light photocatalysts that can be easily retrieved by magnetic separation [27–29]. Given the merits of g-C3N4 and spinel ferrites, we rationally integrated g-C3N4 and SnFe2O4 semiconductors into a magnetically recoverable SnFe2O4/g-C3N4 (SFO/CN) hybrid through a facile in situ precipitation method. The photocatalytic performance of these hybrids was evaluated on the basis of their ability to degrade hazardous dye substances such as Rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO), and methylene blue (MB) and their ability to produce H2 via water reduction. The catalyst stability and recyclability, reaction kinetics, influence of reactive species in the degradation process, and photocatalytic mechanism for dye degradation and H2 generation were comprehensively studied. Additionally, total organic carbon (TOC) measurements were performed over the optimized hybrid to verify the extent of mineralization of dyes during the degradation process. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report on the use of a magnetically responsive SnFe2O4/g-C3N4 composite for visible-light-induced pollutant elimination and H2 generation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of catalysts Pristine CN nanosheets were prepared according to our reported procedure with some modifications [21]. Briefly, 5 g of melamine powder was placed in a closed alumina crucible and heated to 550 °C for 2 h (5 °C min−1) in a muffle furnace under static air atmosphere. After the reaction, the obtained yellow bulk CN product was ground in an agate mortar into fine powder. Then, 100 mg of the as-synthesized bulk CN powder was dispersed in 200 mL of water by ultrasonication for approximately 15 h. The formed suspension was centrifuged at low rpm to separate the residual unexfoliated CN. Finally, the supernatant suspension was carefully dried to obtain a pale-yellow powder of CN nanosheets. The SFO/CN hybrids were synthesized via a facile in situ precipitation method. In a typical synthesis, a certain amount of as-synthesized CN powder was dispersed in 100 mL of water by ultrasonic treatment. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (0.07 M) and tin (II) chloride dihydrate (0.035 M) were then added to the CN powder suspension under continuous magnetic stirring. After complete dissolution of the metal salts, the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C; diluted ammonia solution was then added dropwise to adjust the pH to 10. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was stirred for another 4 h and allowed to precipitate. The resultant precipitate was washed repeatedly with water and dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight to obtain the SFO/CN hybrids. A series of SFO/CN hybrids with different weight percentages of SFO to CN (i.e., 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%) were synthesized and are hereafter denoted as SFO/CN-10, SFO/CN-20, SFO/CN-30, and SFO/CN-40, respectively. Bare SFO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via a similar process but without the addition of CN. The experimental details for the materials, characterization techniques, and photocatalytic activity tests are provided in the supplementary material."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the fabricated CN, SFO, and SFO/CN hybrid catalysts. In the pattern of CN, the intense peak at 27.8°, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 0.32 nm, can be indexed to the (0 0 2) diffraction plane, which is associated with the characteristic interplanar stacking of conjugated aromatic networks. Another weak peak at 13.04° with a d-spacing of 0.67 nm corresponds to (1 0 0) in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units [30]. The XRD peaks of the bare SFO at 30.3°, 35.7°, 43.2°, 57.2°, and 62.8° 2θ can be indexed to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) diffraction planes of CN, respectively, which well match the reflections of spinel-structured SnFe2O4 reported in the literature [28,31]. No impurity phase such as tin oxide or iron oxide was identified, indicating the successful preparation of highly pure SFO NPs. The XRD patterns of the SFO/CN hybrids show peaks attributable to SFO and CN, demonstrating the formation of hybrids. Moreover, with increasing amount of SFO in the hybrids, the characteristic peaks of SFO intensified gradually at the expense of the CN peaks (Fig. 1a), reflecting their respective amounts in the SFO/CN hybrids. After SFO was introduced, the typical peak of CN (at 27.8°) in the patterns of the SFO/CN hybrids slightly shifted from its actual position (Fig. 1b). This diffraction peak shift towards higher 2θ angles for the SFO/CN hybrids indicates minor shrinkage of CN structure after SFO NPs formation. A similar kind of shift in the diffraction peak is also observed in previously reported hybrid photocatalysts [32,33]. The optical properties of the CN, SFO, and SFO/CN hybrid catalysts were determined by UV–vis DRS analysis. The spectrum of CN (Fig. 2 a) displays a steep absorption edge at approximately 460 nm, reflecting its intrinsic visible-light response. Meanwhile, bare SFO exhibits a strong optical absorption capability in the visible-light range (∼450–700 nm). In comparison with the absorption edge of CN, those of the SFO/CN hybrids are gradually shifted toward the longer-wavelength region (red shift), indicative of intimate interactions between SFO and CN in the SFO/CN hybrids. Notably, after SFO/CN integration, photoabsorption is substantially enhanced over the entire investigated UV–vis region. This enhancement is consistent with a color change from the pale yellow of CN to coffee brown of SFO/CN-40 (see the digital photos in the inset of Fig. 2a). In addition, the bandgap energies of the CN, SFO, and SFO/CN catalysts are 2.7, 1.9, and 2.55 eV, respectively, as estimated from Tauc plots of the UV–vis spectra (Fig. S1). The bandgap-narrowing and improved visible-light response of the SFO/CN hybrids could favor the effective harnessing of solar energy, thereby resulting in superior photocatalytic performance compared with that of pristine CN. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were conducted to characterize the specific surface areas and related porous properties of the synthesized samples (Figs. 2b and S2). According to the IUPAC classification [34], the catalyst CN exhibits a type IV isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm); by contrast, SFO exhibits a type IV isotherm with a H4 hysteresis loop, which reflects narrow slit-like pores (Fig. 2b). The obtained specific surface area (S BET), average pore diameter, and total pore volume of CN are 78.8 m2 g−1, 38.5 nm, and 0.297 cm3 g−1, respectively; the corresponding data for the aforementioned surface properties of the other samples are summarized in Table 1 . Interestingly, after SFO with a high S BET (136.4 m2 g−1) was introduced to CN, the resultant SFO/CN hybrids displayed enlarged specific surface areas and their S BET values increased gradually with increasing SFO content in the investigated SFO concentration range. Table 1 also shows that the pore volumes of hybrids are rather smaller than that of CN, presumably because some pore channels of CN are occupied by SFO NPs [35,36]. However, the average pore diameter of the hybrids did not obviously differ from that of the CN (Fig. S2). The mesoporous features and improved specific surface areas of the SFO/CN hybrids would favor the exposure of active sites and the adsorption of reactants, particularly dye molecules, thereby enhancing photocatalytic performance [24,37,38]. FESEM and TEM measurements were collected to analyze the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized catalysts. CN exhibited a randomly oriented thin sheet-like structure (Fig. 3 a), indicating successful exfoliation of the CN from its bulk counterpart. As shown in Fig. 3b, the SFO NPs are spherical, with an average diameter of ∼20 nm. The SEM image of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid in Fig. 3c reveals the presence of CN and SFO components. Moreover, Fig. 3d shows numerous segregated SFO NPs strongly attached to the CN network. This strong coordination between CN and SFO components is further supported by the TEM image of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid in Fig. 4 a. In addition, the HRTEM image of the SFO/CN-30 (Fig. 4b) shows lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.32 and 0.25 nm, which are well indexed to the (0 0 2) plane of CN and the (3 1 1) plane of SFO, respectively [28,39]. The high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) elemental mapping images of the SFO/CN-30 (Fig. 4c–h) reveal the coexistence of C, N, Sn, Fe, and O; the uniform distribution of these elements further confirms the intimate integration of the CN and SFO constituents in the SFO/CN hybrids. The FT-IR spectra of the CN, SFO, and SFO/CN composite samples are presented in Fig. S3. The spectrum of CN shows three predominant absorption regions: the broad absorption band at 3000–3400 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of residual uncondensed amino (N–H) groups, the sharp band at 804 cm−1 corresponds to the typical breathing mode of tri-s-triazine heterocycles, and the bands in the 1200–1700 cm−1 region originate from the characteristic stretching vibrational modes of the C–N bond within the tri-s-triazine rings [40,41]. In the spectrum of SFO, the typical bands at approximately 570 and 630 cm−1 are assigned to M−O (M = Sn, Fe) stretching vibrations, consistent with the formation of spinel-structured ferrite [28,42,43]. The additional broad absorption band of SFO at 3000–3500 cm−1 is assigned to the O–H stretching vibrations arising from physisorbed water molecules. In the spectra of the SFO/CN composites, the characteristic band of CN (804 cm−1) is slightly shifted toward higher frequencies demonstrating that the conjugated structure of CN was slightly weakened and that solid interfacial interactions established between CN and SFO in the resulting SFO/CN hybrids [44,45]. XPS was used to characterize the surface chemical composition and the valence state of the elements in CN, SFO, and the SFO/CN-30 catalysts. The survey XPS spectrum of CN (Fig. S4) shows peaks corresponding to C and N, whereas SFO indicates the predominant presence of Sn, Fe, and O. Meanwhile, the survey spectrum of SFO/CN-30 indicates the coexistence of the peaks corresponding to both CN and SFO. High-resolution C 1s, N 1s, Fe 2p, and Sn 3d XPS spectra are presented in Fig. 5 a–d, respectively. The C 1s spectra of CN and SFO/CN-30 (Fig. 5a) show peaks at 284.6 eV and 288.1 eV, which are assigned to adventitious carbon (C–C) units adsorbed onto the surface and to N–C = N coordination within the tri-s-triazine network, respectively [44]. The N 1 s spectrum of CN in Fig. 5b was deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.3, 399.5, and 400.8 eV, corresponding to C–NC, N–(C)3, and N–H units, respectively [21,39]. However, a clear negative shift in the binding energies of these N components was observed in the spectrum of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid compared with those for CN. This shift in the binding energies is due to the intimate interactions between Fe3+ ions and N–H groups, which are existed at the surface of the CN framework and function as main growth sites of SFO NPs [46]. In the Fe 2p spectrum of SFO, the peaks at 710.9 eV and 724.4 eV with a spin–orbit splitting of 13.5 eV are assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 5c) [47,48]. The clear satellite peaks indicate the high-spin Fe3+ valence state of Fe in the SFO. The unusual peak at ∼715.1 eV in Fe 2p spectrum is assigned to Sn 2p3/2 [49]. In contrast to the N 1 s spectra, a significant positive shift in the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 binding energies was discerned for the SFO/CN-30 hybrid relative to that of SFO, further indicating the strong interfacial interactions between CN and SFO components. In the Sn 3d spectra of both SFO and SFO/CN-30 hybrid (Fig. 5d), the peaks centered at 485.9 eV and 494.3 eV are assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively, implying that Sn exists primarily as Sn2+ [50]. The negative and positive shifts in the binding energies of N 1s and Fe 2p components, respectively, demonstrate the intimate interfacial interactions between CN and SFO, which favor the transfer of photoinduced charges to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the SFO/CN hybrids [39,44,51]. To deduce the actual SFO content in the SFO/CN composites, TGA analysis was performed from 30 °C to 800 °C (Fig. S5). In the TGA trace of CN, the mass loss in the temperature range 550–720 °C represents thermal decomposition of g-C3N4 [52,53], revealing its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range. The TGA curve of SFO shows only a total mass loss of approximately 15% in the investigated temperature range. The actual contents of SFO in the SFO/CN composites, as estimated from their TGA curves, are 7.6, 14.2, 24.1, and 32.3 wt% for SFO/CN-10, SFO/CN-20, SFO/CN-30, and SFO/CN-40, respectively."
5,Photocatalytic activity of SFO/CN hybrids,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity of SFO/CN hybrids The photocatalytic activities of the synthesized SFO/CN hybrids were initially assessed by investigating the degradation of RhB, a widely used dye, in water under visible-light irradiation; the results are presented in Fig. 6 a. The photodegradation performance of the hybrids was compared with the performances of its bare CN and SFO components and also with that of commercial P25 catalyst under similar conditions. Photolysis results in the absence of a catalyst indicated that RhB was photostable, whereas catalytic activity in the dark (without irradiation) further confirmed that the RhB degradation was induced only by the combination of a catalyst and light. Fig. 6a shows that only 29% and 36% of RhB was degraded over SFO and CN, respectively. P25 exhibited poor photodegradation activity because of its UV-only light absorption and rapid charge recombination. By contrast, all of the SFO/CN hybrids displayed activities toward the degradation of RhB far superior to those observed for CN, SFO, and P25. Among the tested samples, the SFO/CN-30 with 30 wt% of SFO on CN exhibited the highest RhB degradation activity, where approximately 99% of RhB was degraded within 30 min under irradiation. Fig. 6b clearly shows that the photodegradation of RhB is fitted well by pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. These kinetic plots reveal that the degradation rate of SFO/CN-30 was almost 10.6, 14.2, and 23.5-times higher than the rates observed for CN, SFO, and P25, respectively. Notably, the photodegradation performance of the SFO/CN hybrids increased gradually with increasing amount of SFO until the SFO content reached 30 wt%; it then decreased as the SFO amount was increased further. This trend is likely explained by self-agglomeration resulting from the addition of excessive SFO to CN, thus decreasing the density of the SFO/CN interfaces, thereby resulting in diminished degradation activity. Hence, control over the amount of SFO in the SFO/CN hybrids is critical to achieving optimum photodegradation activity. In addition, the SFO/CN-30 physical mixture (PM) catalyst obtained via physical mixing of CN and SFO (30 wt%) displayed degradation performance inferior to that of SFO/CN-30 as well as other SFO/CN hybrids fabricated by an in situ precipitation method (Fig. 6), revealing weak interactions between the components in the SFO/CN-30 PM sample. This result clearly demonstrates that the strong synergy between CN and SFO in the SFO/CN hybrids is an important contributor to their remarkable photocatalytic activities. To study the universality of the fabricated SFO/CN hybrids, we investigated the photodegradation activities of two other dye molecules, MO and MB; the results are displayed in Fig. S6. Interestingly, the SFO/CN hybrids display extraordinary performance toward the degradation of both MO and MB—far superior to the performances of the CN, SFO, and P25 reference catalysts. Although the SFO/CN-30 hybrid exhibited the highest activity toward the degradation of RhB, MO, and MB among the investigated catalysts, the general trend in the MO and MB photodegradation results differs slightly from that in the RhB photodegradation results. Decolorization of a dye does not mean that it has been completely mineralized into CO2 and H2O because intermediate fragments can be produced during the degradation process. Therefore, TOC measurements were performed over optimized SFO/CN-30 hybrid to verify the extent of mineralization of RhB, MO, and MB dyes achieved during the degradation process (Fig. 7 a–c). Approximately 72%, 85%, and 68% TOC removal was achieved for RhB, MO, and MB, respectively, after their respective irradiation times. These TOC analysis results indeed provide evidence of the efficient mineralization of RhB, MO, and MB dye molecules over the SFO/CN hybrids under visible-light illumination. The photocatalytic activities of the developed SFO/CN hybrids were also evaluated for H2 production from water that contained TEOA (10 vol%) as a sacrificial reagent. Almost no H2 was detected in the absence of either catalyst or light, suggesting that both catalyst and light were necessary to drive the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. CN displayed minimal generation of H2 (Fig. 7d), with a yield of 16.2 μmol at 4 h, whereas the amount of H2 produced over SFO was 9.5 μmol at 4 h. All of the SFO/CN hybrids displayed substantially greater H2 evolution activities than the CN and SFO components. Among the SFO/CN hybrids, the SFO/CN-30 hybrid exhibited the best H2 generation performance, with a H2 yield of 132.5 μmol, representing remarkable 8.2- and 14.0-fold improvements over the H2 generation yields of CN and SFO, respectively. The general trend in H2 production differs slightly from that of RhB degradation but is similar to the trends in MO and MB photodegradation activities. These results confirm that the synthesized SFO/CN hybrids are candidate catalysts not only for pollutant elimination but also for sustainable H2 energy production. In addition to photocatalytic performance, reusability is also a prerequisite for a catalyst to be used in practical applications because it enables the catalyst to be used multiple times, thus minimizing costs [37,54]. Magnetically responsive catalysts have the advantage of easy separation and recycling via the application of an external magnetic field, especially in liquid-phase reactions. To assess the reusability of the present magnetically responsive hybrid system, five successive experimental runs were performed using the optimized SFO/CN-30 catalyst for photodegradation of RhB and for H2 generation. Fig. 8 a and b show that the SFO/CN-30 hybrid retains its extraordinary activity toward both dye degradation and H2 evolution even after five consecutive test cycles. As shown in Fig. 8c, the SFO/CN-30 catalyst forms a stable dispersion in water. However, after an external magnetic field is applied (a 1 in. commercial magnet bar), the formed dispersion becomes a transparent solution within a short time because of the rapid collection of the magnetized SFO/CN-30 catalyst particles (Fig. 8d). With this approach, the SFO/CN-30 catalyst was conveniently separated from the test solution, refreshed, and then reused in consecutive photocatalytic runs. The stability of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid catalyst during photocatalytic reactions was evaluated via XRD, FTIR, XPS, and TEM analyses. As shown in Figs. S7a and b, no obvious change was observed in the XRD and FTIR spectra of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid before and after the reaction, indicating that the phase and chemical structure of the catalyst are unaffected during the prolonged photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, no obvious change in the N 1s (Fig. S8a) and Fe 2p (Fig. S8b) XPS profiles of the SFO/CN-30 hybrid before and after the reaction, further confirming that the chemical structure of the hybrid is essentially unaltered during the photocatalytic experiments. Additionally, the TEM images (Fig. S9) of the reused and fresh SFO/CN-30 hybrid implying its morphological stability. The results from these experiments conclude that the magnetically responsive SFO/CN hybrids can be used as stable photocatalysts for practical applications in both pollutant elimination and H2 evolution."
6,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism Various experiments were performed to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism underlying the extraordinary performance of the SFO/CN hybrids; the results are described as follows. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted to study the interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency in the SFO/CN hybrids. The intensity of the PL emission peak is well known to serve as a direct measurement of the recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers; the stronger the PL emission intensity, the greater the charge recombination probability [55,56]. As the PL spectra show (Fig. 8e), CN exhibited the most intense PL emission peak in the visible region (460 nm), reflecting rapid charge recombination of the photoexcited charge carriers. All of the SFO/CN hybrids exhibited decreased emission intensities compared with that of CN, implying that the electron–hole recombination of CN was effectively suppressed after the introduction of SFO NPs. Moreover, SFO/CN-30 hybrid displayed the lowest PL emission intensity among the fabricated catalysts, consistent with its remarkable photocatalytic activity. This greater quenching of the PL intensity for the SFO/CN hybrids is ascribed to effective charge transfer between CN and SFO at the interface, which hampers the direct recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes. To gain further insight into the transfer efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers in the SFO/CN hybrids, we characterized the transient photocurrent responses for CN and the SFO/CN hybrids with several on–off cycles of intermittent visible-light illumination. In general, a greater photocurrent response reflects greater charge-carrier separation efficiency [57,58]. Fig. 8f shows that all of the SFO/CN hybrids exhibited superior photocurrent responses compared with that of the reference CN catalyst, thus demonstrating greater charge separation efficiency in the SFO/CN hybrids. Among all of the examined catalysts, the SFO/CN-30 displayed the highest photocurrent response, in accordance with the PL and photocatalytic activity results. Importantly, the highest photocurrent response and the lowest PL emission of SFO/CN-30 compared with those of the other SFO/CN hybrids further clarify the influence of the SFO content in the SFO/CN hybrids on charge separation. Therefore, the PL and photocurrent response results infer that the substantially improved charge separation could be one of the underlying factors responsible for the outstanding photocatalytic activities of the SFO/CN hybrids toward both pollutant degradation and hydrogen production. Superoxide anion radicals (O2 •−), holes (h+), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are the main reactive species responsible for the photodegradation of pollutants [59–61]. Trapping experiments involving appropriate quenchers revealed the roles of these reactive species in the RhB photodegradation process over the CN, SFO, and SFO/CN-30 catalysts. As presented in Fig. 9 a, for CN, when the tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, quencher of •OH) was introduced into reaction solution, the RhB degradation activity is slightly decreased. However, introducing benzoquinone (BQ, quencher of O2 •−) and ammonium oxalate (AO, quencher of h+) brings in clear suppression of RhB degradation, which indicates that O2 •− and h+ are the key reactive species of CN in the degradation of RhB. Besides, the degradation activity of SFO is almost invariable upon the addition of AO, implying that h+ did not participate in the degradation process. In contrary, the degradation performance of SFO was drastically decreased when BQ was introduced, while the addition of TBA had modest effect in decreasing the RhB degradation activity, demonstrating that O2 •− plays a major role, and •OH plays a moderate role in the degradation reaction. In the case of SFO/CN-30, the degradation performance was slightly diminished upon the addition of TBA, which implies that •OH plays a minor role in the degradation process. The degradation of RhB was moderately suppressed by the introduction of AO, which indicates that h+ is important but not the main reactive species in the degradation reaction. Interestingly, a dramatic decrease in the degradation activity was observed upon the addition of BQ, revealing that O2 •− is the main reactive species of the SFO/CN hybrid catalysts in the photodegradation of pollutants. The electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was further employed to verify the production ofO2 •− and •OH species on the surface of CN, SFO, and SFO/CN-30 photocatalysts during the photodegradation process, and 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a typical spin-trap molecule. The lack of ESR signals in Fig. 9b and c under the dark condition for all of the samples implies that the spin-reactive species (DMPO−•OH and DMPO–O2 •−) were solely produced under stimulation of visible light. As can be seen in Fig. 9b, all of the three photocatalysts exhibit the characteristic peaks of the DMPO–O2 •− adducts. Moreover, compared to CN and SFO, the SFO/CN-30 hybrid displayed a high intensity DMPO–O2 •− signal, signifying that the amount of O2 •− species produced on the surface of SFO/CN-30 hybrid is more than that of CN and SFO. Surprisingly, all of the tested samples illustrate the weak signals corresponding to the DMPO−•OH adduct, indicating that the small amount of •OH species were also generated on the surface of the CN, SFO, and SFO/CN-30 samples, which is in accordance with the results of the trapping experiments. In contrast, the valence band (VB) potentials of both CN and SFO (+1.38 for CN and +0.45 for SFO, as determined by the VB-XPS analysis discussed later) are less positive than the standard oxidation potential of OH−/•OH (+2.4 eV vs. NHE) [62,63], which means that •OH cannot be produced from the VB holes of both CN and SFO. Besides, it is well documented that the •OH species can also be produced from the O2 •− species through multistep reduction reactions [64,65]. On the basis of these observations, it can be deduced that the few •OH radicals that participated in the degradation process were likely produced from the multistep reduction of O2 at the conduction band rather than the reaction of H2O with holes at the valence band. In general, the transfer direction of photoexcited electrons and holes in the hybrids depends mainly on the respective band-edge potentials of their constituents. In the present study, VB edge potentials for the CN and SFO catalysts were determined by VB-XPS from the intercept of the tangent to the density of states at the Fermi edge as +1.38 and +0.45, respectively (Fig. S9) [44,51,66]. Based on the bandgap energies and VB edge potentials of CN and SFO, the conduction band (CB) edge potentials were calculated to be −1.32 eV and −1.45 eV for CN and SFO, respectively. Since both the VB and CB potentials of CN are more positive than those of SFO, the charge transfer at the interface may follow the Z-scheme transfer mechanism or conventional double-transfer mechanism. If the double-transfer mechanism is assumed, the photoreduction reaction would proceed on the CB of CN, and the photooxidation reaction on the VB of SFO. Nevertheless, trapping experiments demonstrate that h+ in the VB of SFO did not participate in the degradation process. This means that h+ of SFO does not contribute to the oxidation process neither to degrade the pollutant molecules directly nor to produce •OH from water molecules. On the contrary, h+ in the VB of CN plays a decent role in the degradation reaction, as confirmed by the trapping experiments. This indicates that the charge transfer in the present SFO/CN hybrid system likely follows the direct Z-scheme transfer mechanism, where the photoreduction process occurs on the CB of SFO and the photooxidation reaction occurs on the VB of CN. Owing to their suitable bandgap energies for visible-light absorption, both CN and SFO are excited simultaneously under visible light to generate electrons in the CB and holes in the VB, as illustrated in Fig. 10 . Because of the well matched band-edge potentials and the formation of a heterojunction between CN and SFO, the excited electrons in the CB of CN are easily combine with holes in the VB of SFO, resulting in the accumulation of electrons in the CB of SFO and holes in the VB of CN. As such, the direct recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes was successfully inhibited in the SFO/CN hybrids. Because the CB potential of SFO (−1.45 V vs. NHE) is more negative than that of O2/O2 •− (−0.33 V vs. NHE) [67,68], the electrons gathered in the CB of SFO can easily react with dissolved O2 to form O2 •−, which can further participate in the degradation process. Meanwhile, a few O2 •− species are further reduced to •OH radicals through multistep reduction reactions and participate in the degradation process. Besides, the assembled holes in the VB of CN can directly participate in the degradation reaction to eliminate the dye molecules. In this way, O2 •− species played a major role and holes and •OH species played relatively minor roles in the degradation of dye pollutants. In the case of H2 evolution, the electrons in the CB of SFO can efficiently produce H2 because the CB potential of SFO is more negative than the standard reduction potential of H+/H2 (−0.41 eV vs. NHE at pH 7). Meanwhile, the holes in the VB of CN can react with TEOA to hinder charge recombination. Given the aforementioned results, the main steps involved in both the photodegradation and H2 generation reactions over the SFO/CN hybrid are summarized by the following equations: S F O / C N + h v → S F O / C N ( e C B - + h V B + ) S F O / C N ( e C B - + h V B + ) → S F O ( e C B - ) + C N ( h V B + ) S F O e C B - + O 2 → S F O + O 2 ∙ - O 2 ∙ - + R h B / M O / M B → d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s ( m a j o r ) O 2 ∙ - + e - + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 H 2 O 2 + e - → O H ∙ + O H - ( h + + O H ∙ ) + R h B / M O / M B → d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s ( m i n o r ) S F O 2 e - + 2 H + → S F O + H 2 ; E 0 = - 0.41 V C N h V B + + T E O A → C N + T E O A +"
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully synthesized magnetically responsive SFO/CN hybrids via a facile in situ precipitation route. These SFO/CN hybrids exhibited remarkable photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of representative dye pollutants (RhB, MO, and MB) and H2 production, where the performance was far superior to those of CN, SFO, and commercial P25. Among the prepared catalysts, the SFO/CN hybrid containing 30 wt% of SFO exhibited the best photocatalytic performance. The strong synergy between the constituents in SFO/CN hybrids that facilitate interfacial charge transfer to hinder the direct recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes, together with improved light absorption and specific surface area, contributed to the exceptional photocatalytic performance of the SFO/CN hybrids. The trapping experiments corroborated that O2 •− played a major role, whereas holes and •OH played minor roles in the degradation process. Notably, SFO/CN hybrids could be easily recovered magnetically and displayed high recyclability and stability during consecutive test cycles. Therefore, the results provided in this work offer valuable insights into the development of magnetically responsive catalysts for applications in environmental remediation and sustainable energy production."
