0,Introduction,"Biomass is the unique alternative to replace traditional fossil resources from which energy, fuels and chemicals can be obtained [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass, composed by cellulose (40–50%), lignin (15–25%) and hemicellulose (20–35%), is a suitable and available carbon source for chemical synthesis without competing with the food chain [2–6]. Furfural (FUR) is one of the main products which can be derived from the lignocellulosic biomass, with a high industrial importance associated to its large spectrum of applications. The presence of an aldehyde group and an aromatic ring makes FUR an interesting platform molecule. In addition, these features are responsible of its high reactivity, which have prompted the establishment of several chemical routes to convert FUR in other high value-added products [2,4]. Among these chemical pathways, FUR hydrogenation is one of the most widely used reactions for FUR valorization, yielding several products, such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL), methylfuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, furan, tetrahydrofuran, cyclopentanone or olefins. FUR hydrogenation can proceed through liquid or gas phase, having been proposed a wide range of transition metals such as Cu [7–10], Ni [11,12], Co [13], Pd [14,15], Pt [16,17] or Ru [18] as active phase, to replace the industrial copper chromite hydrogenation catalyst [19,20], because of the high toxicity of chromium species. The largest FUR production takes place in China, counting about 70% of the global world production, followed by Dominic Republic and South Africa, all of three countries responsible of the 90% of total production (280 kTn per year) [5]. Nevertheless, an efficient alternative to the classical catalytic hydrogenation, in which hydrogen is the reducing agent, could be the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), already proposed to transform ketones or aldehydes in alcohols, since, in this way, the use of high hydrogen pressures is avoided. In this sense, in the mid of 1920s, Meerwein, Ponndorf and Verley (MPV) reported that aldehydes and ketones can be reduced by secondary alcohols in the presence of a Lewis acid or basic catalyst [21–25]. Lewis acid sites were able to activate the CO bond of aldehydes or ketones, while the alcohol suffers deprotonation. Moreover, the formation of a six-membered intermediate was postulated, with the participation of the hydrogen in the position Cα, being both aldehyde/ketone and the deprotonated alcohol directly activated on the Lewis acid sites [26,27]. The MPV process is easy, with low requirements for reactants purity and high chemoselectivity, due to reactivity of the carbonyl group of both aldehydes and ketones, while double and triple bonds are unreactive. Traditionally, the MPV reaction takes place using aluminum (Scheme 1 ) [28–30] zirconium [30] and magnesium [31] complexes or alkoxides, as homogenous catalysts; however, these catalysts display several drawbacks, such as expensive separation and purification of products, and moisture sensitivity. In this context, heterogeneous catalysts have emerged as alternative for MPV processes, due to their easier separation and ability to be reused. These include metal oxides [32–35], hydrotalcites [36,37] and zeolites [38–43]. Among them, alumina (Al2O3) is an attractive catalyst due to its high availability, low cost, environmentally benignity and relatively low toxicity. Moreover, the synergy between acid and basic sites has been highlighted to explain the higher catalytic activity of hydrotalcites in comparison to the pure basic oxides, and it could be also applied to the case of alumina, but this has been scarcely evaluated in this catalytic process [30]. The FUR conversion through MPV reaction has been reported using zeolites [40,42,44] or mesoporous silica modified with heteroatoms to generate Lewis acidity [39,45]. The FUR hydrogenation leads to furfuryl alcohol, which can react with the secondary alcohol to produce furfuryl ethers. In addition, the process can go forward the formation of other products, such as levulinic acid or γ-valerolactone, due to the coexistence of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites [44]. In any case, all of them are high value-added chemicals. Thus, furfuryl alcohol is largely employed for resins because of its interesting thermal, mechanical and chemical properties, and high resistance against corrosion [2], while furfuryl ethers can be used as blending components of gasoline [46] or as flavors [47]. The aim of this work was the evaluation of a series of commercial aluminas in the FUR hydrogenation by the MPV reaction, by considering the different surface properties of aluminas to establish structure-activity relationships. In addition, several key experimental variables, such as the reaction temperature, the alcohol:furfural molar ratio and the nature of the secondary alcohol, were optimized to attain the highest conversion and selectivity to a particular hydrogenated product. Finally, the reutilization of the solid catalysts was also studied."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Commercial aluminas were supplied by Alfa-Aesar (Brockmann Grade I, 58 Å). These aluminas were denoted as acid, neutral and basic alumina, being labeled as A-Al2O3, N-Al2O3 and B-Al2O3, respectively, and they were employed as received. The reagents used in the hydrogen transfer reaction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol were furfural (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), isopropanol (VWR, HPLC grade, 99.9%), 2-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and cyclohexanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), as sacrificing alcohols, and o-xylene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) as internal standard Gases used were He (Air Liquide, 99.99%), H2 (Air Liquide, 99.999%), N2 (Air Liquide, 99.9999%) and NH3 (Air Liquide, 99.9%)."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The identification of crystalline phases in aluminas was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a PANalytical automated diffractometer (EMPYREAN model) and Cu-Kα (1.5406 Å) radiation, with a last generation PIXcel detector. The average crystallite size and the lattice strain were estimated by the Williamson-Hall method, using the equation B cos θ = (K λ/D) + (2 ε sin θ), where θ is the Bragg angle, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray and ε the lattice strain [48]. Textural parameters (SBET, VP and DP) were evaluated from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C, determined by using an automatic ASAP 2020 system from Micromeritics. Prior to adsorption, samples were outgassed at 200 °C and 10−4 mbar, overnight. Surface areas were determined by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation assuming a cross section of 16.2 Å2 for the nitrogen molecule [49]. The pore size distribution was calculated by the density functional theory model (DFT) [50], whereas total pore volume was obtained from N2 adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.996. The amount of acid sites was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). 0.08 g of catalyst was previously evacuated in a He flow (40 mL min−1) from room temperature to 550 °C, with a rate of 10 °C min−1, and cooled under the same conditions until 100 °C. After that, the catalyst was saturated with NH3 for 5 min. Then, a He flow (40 mL min−1) was passed to eliminate the physisorbed ammonia. Finally, temperature-programmed desorption was carried out by heating the samples from 100 to 550 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed ammonia was quantified by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). FTIR spectra after pyridine adsorption were recorded on a Shimadzu 8300 FTIR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Each spectrum was average over 128 scans. Self-supporting wafers of samples, with a weight/surface ratio of about 12 mg cm−2, were placed in a vacuum cell with greaseless stopcocks and CaF2 windows. Samples were evacuated at 350 °C and 10−4 Torr overnight, exposed to pyridine vapors for 15 min at room temperature, and then outgassed at different temperatures. The net FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were obtained after subtracting the background spectrum of the solid. X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected using a Physical Electronics PHI5700 spectrometer with non-monochromatic Mg Kα radiation (300 W, 15 kV and 1253.6 eV) with a multichannel detector. Spectra of samples were recorded in the constant pass energy mode at 29.35 eV using a 720 μm diameter analysis area. Charge referencing was measured against adventitious carbon (C 1s at 284.8 eV). A PHI ACCESS ESCA-V6.0F software package was used for acquisition and data analysis. A Shirley-type back ground was subtracted from the signals. Recorded spectra were always fitted using Gaussian-Lorentzian curves in order to determine the binding energies of the different element core levels more accurately. The TG-DSC data were recorded with a Mettler-Toledo (TGA/DSC-1) instrument equipped with a MX5 microbalance. The temperature was varied from RT to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The measurements were performed with samples in open platinum crucibles under an air flow."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The furfural hydrogenation, via MPV reaction, was carried out by using glass pressure reactors with thread bushing (Ace, 15 mL, pressure rated to 10 bars). In the assays, 50–125 mg of catalyst were mixed with 100 mg of furfural and 2-8 mL of different secondary alcohols, as 2-propanol (i-pr-OH), 2-butanol (2-bu-OH) and (CH-OH) cyclohexanol, varying the alcohol:furfural molar ratio between 25 and 100. Prior experiments, reactors were always purged with helium. Reaction time was extended until 6 hours, under continuous stirring (450 rpm), whereas the reaction temperature ranged between 90 and 150 °C. The temperature was controlled by a thermocouple directly in contact with a silicone bath. After the reaction time, the reactor was moved away of the silicone bath and cooled in a water bath. Samples were microfiltered and analyzed by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A), equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector and a CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column. The furfural conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: C o n v e r s i o n % = m o l o f f u r f u r a l c o n v e r t e d m o l o f f u r f u r a l f e d X 100 S e l e c t i v i t y % = m o l o f t h e p r o d u c t m o l o f f u r f u r a l c o n v e r t e d X 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of the catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalysts The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (Fig. 1 ) has allowed to identify the presence of a γ phase (γ-Al2O3) with cubic structure (PDF 01-077-0396), in all cases. This is inferred from the presence of diffraction peaks at 2θ (º) = 32.1, 37.7, 39.5, 42.9, 45.7 and 66.9, being discarded the existence of other crystalline phases. The average crystal size was determined using the Williamson-Hall equation [48], obtaining similar values, in the range of 5–8 nm. 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 2 ) also display similar patterns for all the aluminas, with two signals at 67.9 and 9.3 ppm with similar width, which can be attributed to tetrahedral (AlIV) and octahedral (AlVI) aluminum species, respectively [51]. The presence of AlV, previously observed in highly disordered transition aluminas, can be ruled out [52]. All FTIR spectra (Fig. 3 ) display a broad band between 3800 and 2700 cm−1, that can be assigned to the stretching vibration mode of –OH groups of hydration water and AlOH groups [53]. In addition, the absorption band located at 1633 cm−1 is the typical HOH bending vibration mode of hydration water molecules, whereas signals at 1566, 1461 and 1382 cm−1 could be associated to the stretching vibration of carbonate groups [54,55]. The A-Al2O3 catalyst possesses a higher proportion of carbonate species. Textural characterization, carried out by N2 sorption at −196 °C (Fig. 4 ), reveals that all N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 4A and Fig. S1) are of Type IV in the IUPAC classification, typical of mesoporous materials [56]. This type of isotherm is accompanied by a hysteresis loop, which can be classified as H4, associated to porosity due to aggregated crystals [56]. The specific surface area (SBET) values are between 137 and 158 m2 g−1, while the pore volume varies between 0.236 and 0.252 cm3 g−1 (Table 1 ). The pore size distributions, estimated by the DFT method [50] (Figs. 4B and S2), are narrow, with pore sizes between 2.5 and 10.5 nm, with a maximum about 5 nm, discarding the presence of large mesopores. This similarity suggests that the acid-base nature of alumina does not seem to affect their textural properties. XPS analysis was used to get insights into the surface characteristics of catalysts (Table 2 ). The Al 2p3/2 core level spectra display a single contribution located at 73.6–74.0 eV, which can be ascribed to Al in an oxidic framework [57]. In this sense, the symmetric band in the O 1s core level spectra, between 530.4–530.9 eV, would confirm this assumption [57]. The Al/O ratio is similar in all cases, between 0.46–0.48, although far from the theoretical one (0.66), which could be explained by the hydroxylation of the alumina surface. In addition, it is noticeable the presence of sodium and chlorine species, probably due to the pre-treatment used to create acid and basic sites, as previously pointed out by Nassar et al. [58]. Finally, the C 1s core level spectra show a contribution located about 288.5–288.9 eV, together with the adventitious carbon (ca. 284.8 eV), attributable to carbonate species, mainly in the case of the A-Al2O3 catalyst, in agreement with the FTIR data (Fig. 2). NH3-TPD measurements have been performed to quantify the total amount of acid sites, which is an important parameter in addressing the catalytic behavior in the MPV reaction (Table 1). The data confirm the different acid character of the three aluminas. Although all catalysts exhibit similar textural properties, the density of acid sites, expressed per surface unit, follows a similar trend to that deduced from the NH3-TPD analysis."
7,Catalytic results,"The catalytic behavior of commercial aluminas was evaluated in the MPV reaction for the reduction of FUR. The study of the influence of the reaction temperature (Fig. 5 ) has demonstrated that, in all cases, the FUR conversion increases with the reaction temperature, as well as with the reaction progress. All catalysts display similar catalytic behavior, reaching high FOL yields (around 90%), with full FUR conversion, at 150 °C after 6 h of reaction. In this sense, it has been reported that adsorption plays a key role in MPV reaction due to desorption of both reactants (FUR and alcohol) and products is favored when the temperature raises [42]. The use of alumina in MPV process has been reported at high reaction temperatures (300 °C), in vapor phase, although also provoking the alcohol dehydration due to its strong acid character [59]. In our case, in liquid phase, it is necessary to increase the temperature up to 150 °C in order to reach a high FOL yield . Other authors have pointed out the positive effect on reaction rate of the addition of small amounts of base, which has been explained by the deprotonation of the alcohol bound to the alumina surface and the formation of alkoxide species, although this improvement is not noticeable [60]. In this sense, Komanoya et al. have reported the synergy between basic and Lewis acid sites in the MPV reduction of cyclohexanone [61]. The present data (Fig. 5) are in agreement with the literature, since it has been observed that the superficial basic treatment has a positive effect in the MPV reaction, since higher conversion values are attained at shorter reaction times. On the other hand, the concurrence of secondary reactions between FOL molecules, or FOL and the sacrificing alcohol using solid acid catalysts, such as mesoporous silica modified with Al [39,62], Zr [39,45] or mesoporous zirconia [63], has been also reported. Thus, the incorporation of heteroatoms, such as Zr or Al, into the siliceous framework creates strong acid sites, or increases the strength of silanol groups. These catalysts achieve high FUR conversion at lower reaction temperatures, although the amount and strength of acid sites also favor the etherification of the alcohol by a nucleophilic substitution, when the temperature increases from 80 to 130 °C [39,45,62]. In the case of aluminas, higher reaction temperatures are required to reach a high FUR conversion. However, this lower reactivity of Lewis acid sites has a beneficial effect, since the MPV reduction of FUR is highly selective towards FOL, minimizing side reactions under these experimental conditions, as can be inferred from the corresponding chromatograms (Fig. S3). Nonetheless, the FUR conversion and FOL yield follow different tendencies when both temperature and reaction time raise. This could indicate, in the absence of other peaks in the chromatograms, either the formation of carbonaceous deposits or the adsorption of heavy by-products. Several authors have previously reported the MPV reaction with catalysts highly selective to FOL. Thus, Kim et al. have synthesized Al2O3 dispersed on a carbon, obtaining a FOL yield close to 96% after 6 h of reaction at 130 °C, although by using a higher pressure (60 psi = 0.4 MPa) [64]. On the other hand, Wang et al. have evaluated the catalytic behavior of hydroxyapatite-encapsulated magnetic γ-Fe2O3, obtaining a FUR conversion of 96% with a FOL yield of 91% [65], although at a reaction temperature (180 °C) higher than that used in the present work. Taking into account that the B-Al2O3 catalyst reaches the highest FUR conversion at lower reaction time (150 °C), this was chosen to evaluate the influence of other experimental parameters, such as the calcination temperature of the catalyst, the type of sacrificing alcohol, the alcohol/FUR molar ratio and the catalyst reusability, on FUR reduction via a MPV process. Thus, the study of the thermal treatment (Fig. 6 A) shows that FUR conversion decreases when the catalysts is activated at a higher temperature. This fact is more pronounced when the B-Al2O3 catalyst was thermally treated at 700 °C, with a FUR conversion of 73% and a FOL yield close to 66%, at 150 °C, after 6 h of reaction. The XRD patterns of B-Al2O3 treated at different temperature are barely modified, maintaining similar crystal sizes in all cases (5–7 nm) (Fig. S4). However, 27Al NMR spectra evidence small changes (Fig. 6B), since an increase of the temperature in the thermal treatment causes a slight decrease of the AlVI signal. Previous researches have pointed out that the modification of tetrahedral/octahedral positions affects to the proportion of the Lewis acid sites [66], which is in agreement with the catalytic data reported in Fig. 6A. Therefore, a more drastic thermal treatment could modify the distribution of tetrahedral/octahedral aluminum species. It has been previously reported that secondary alcohols seem to be the most efficient hydrogen donors for the MPV reaction, due to the higher stability of the secondary carbocation formed during the hydride transfer, in comparison to primary alcohols [67]. Although primary alcohols can also be used as hydrogen donors, their respective aldehydes, formed after the MPV reaction, can suffer self-condensation processes [68]. In addition, the aldehyde formed can react with another alcohol leading to undesired secondary reactions. The tertiary alcohols cannot be used as hydrogen donors due to the lack of hydrogen in the α-carbon [67]. Considering these premises, different secondary alcohols have been evaluated as sacrificing alcohols in this research: 2-propanol, 2-butanol and cyclohexanol. The catalytic data (Fig. 7 ) reveal that the use of 2-butanol leads to the highest conversion value, reaching a FOL yield close to 80% after 6 h at 110 °C. Under similar experimental conditions, the FUR conversion slightly decreases with isopropanol, mainly at shorter reaction times, with a FOL yield of 74%. It has been previously established that long-chain alcohols provide higher reaction rates than those with shorter chains due to the polarity decrease of the alcohol with the chain length of non-cyclic alcohols. This fact leads to a stronger interaction with the Lewis acid sites causing a decrease in flexibility of the six-membered intermediate, as was indicated in the MPV reduction of alkyl levulinates [41]. The lowest FUR conversion was attained for cyclohexanol due to the MPV reaction is sensitive to the steric hindrance [69], reaching a FOL yield of only 50% after 6 h at 110 °C. Moreover, the higher boiling point of cyclohexanol (161.8 °C versus 82.6 and 99 °C for isopropanol and 2-butanol, respectively) could be also responsible of this low catalytic activity, since a lower autogenous pressure is generated into the reactor with high boiling point alcohols. From the Antoine equation, which describes a correlation between the temperature and vapor pressure (data shown in Table S1), it can be observed that isopropanol displays the highest vapor pressure (2.79 bar), while cyclohexanol reaches a lower vapor pressure (0.15 bar) at 110 °C. Thus, the autogenous pressure could play an important role in the MPV reduction of FUR since both isopropanol and 2-butanol have higher pressure autogenous, which favors the formation of FOL, in comparison to cyclohexanol. In any case, an increase of the reaction temperature to 150 °C leads to all sacrificing alcohols showing similar conversion values, with FOL yields between 90–95% after only 2 h of reaction. On the other hand, an increase of the alcohol/FUR molar ratio allows attaining high FUR conversion and FOL yield at shorter reaction times (Fig. 8 ). Thus, a i-PrOH/FUR molar ratio of 25 in the feed leads to a FOL yield of 59% after 1 h of reaction, at 150 °C, while a 79% FOL yield can be obtained with a molar ratio of 100. Previous studies have demonstrated that the MPV reaction is reversible (Oppenauer oxidation), so it is necessary the removal of the low boiling ketone formed as product, or the addition of an excess of sacrificing alcohol, to shift the equilibrium toward products formation, according to Le Chatelier's principle [69]. An analogous effect has been observed by varying the catalyst/FUR mass ratio (Fig. 9 ), where the highest FOL yield was attained as the amount of catalyst increases (catalyst/FUR mass ratio of 1,0–1,25). This trend can be ascribed to the increment of the amount of available active sites, which favors the interaction with a high number of isopropanol and furfural molecules, and hence the catalytic process [45,70]. Heterogeneous catalysis takes advantage of the reutilization of solid catalysts, and therefore the recovery and reutilization of the B-Al2O3 catalyst has been studied by evaluating the catalytic behavior after several runs (Figs. 10 and 11 ,). Moreover, the comparison of the use of distilled and non-distilled FUR reveals a progressive decline of FUR conversion and FOL yield, decreasing the FOL yield from 88% in the 1st run to 52% after the 4th run when distilled FUR was used. This decay is more pronounced for the non-distilled FUR where the FOL yield diminishes from 84% after the 1st run to 37% after 4th run. From these data, it is clear that the FUR distillation can reduce slightly the deactivation process in the MPV reaction, mainly after several catalytic cycles. It is well-known that FUR tends to suffer polymerization reactions in contact with O2 and/or under light radiation. In this sense, XPS spectra of used catalysts evidence an increase of the surface carbon content, which could be attributed to the presence of carbonaceous deposits (Table 2). Considering the absence of other products, the small differences in the carbon balance are ascribed to these carbonaceous species on the surface of the alumina. These deposits are more extended when non-distilled FUR is used, which is in agreement with the lowest conversion values along the runs due to a progressive loss of available acid sites. The deactivation by leaching must be discarded since the aluminum content detected in the reaction medium was only of 0.002% for the A-Al2O3 catalyst and 0.005% for N-Al2O3 and B-Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. In order to improve the reuse of the B-Al2O3 catalyst, the catalyst was recovered between runs. After filtration, the catalyst was dried at 60 °C and then calcined overnight at 550 °C to remove the organic matter, according to TG analysis (Fig. S5). The obtained data show that the liquid phase generates lower proportion of carbonaceous deposits in comparison to the FUR hydrogenation in gas phase [71]. The catalytic data reveal that the catalyst regeneration by calcination minimizes the deactivation along the next runs (2nd–4th). It can be observed that the conversion values decrease after the 1st run since it is required a temperature of 550 °C to regenerate the B-Al2O3 catalyst. The obtained value is close to that achieved for this catalyst thermally treated at 550 °C after 2 h of reaction (Fig. 6). The regeneration of the catalyst along several cycles indicates that the B-Al2O3 catalyst maintains its FUR conversion and FOL yield. From the experimental data, it can be inferred that calcination improves the conversion of FUR in comparison to washing with 2-propanol and subsequent drying overnight, probably due to the carbonaceous deposits, accumulated along the cycles, are not removed. Finally, bearing in mind the interest in the one-pot conversion of xylose into furfuryl alcohol, the influence of the addition of the stoichiometric amount of water formed in the dehydration of xylose into furfural (H2O/FUR molar ratio of 3) has been evaluated. Fig. 12 reveals that the presence of water causes a drastic decay of the catalytic activity, with a FOL yield close to 55% after 6 h at 150 °C, instead of 90% in the absence of water. It has been previously reported in the literature that the MPV reaction mainly proceeds through Lewis acid or basic sites. Thus, the nature of the acid sites of the B-Al2O3 catalyst has been evaluated by pyridine adsorption coupled to FTIR (Fig. 13 ). The band located at 1447 and 1608 cm−1 are ascribed to vibration modes of pyridine coordinated on Lewis acid centers [72,73]. The presence of pyridine coordinated to Brönsted sites can be discarded by the absence of the characteristic vibration bands at 1637 and 1542 cm−1. The band located about 1491 cm−1 is assigned to the vibration mode of pyridine associated to Lewis sites, whereas that a at 1597 cm−1 is associated to hydrogen-bonded pyridine to superficial hydroxyls, although this band disappear when the temperature increases. In an additional test, the B-Al2O3 was previously treated under a vapor steam flow at 450 °C for 4 h, and after drying at room temperature, it was tested as catalyst along 6 h at 150 °C (Fig. 12). It is noteworthy that the catalytic behavior is similar to that shown for the B-Al2O3 catalysts when H2O was incorporated in the reaction medium. In this sense, the presence of H2O in the reaction medium can transform Lewis into Brönsted acid sites [74,75], which are inactive in the MPV reaction. This fact was confirmed by carrying out an additional test using a typical catalyst with Brönsted acid sites such as Amberlyst-15, where the dehydration of the sacrificing alcohol is favored while the MPV reaction does not take place."
8,Conclusions,"Several commercial aluminas with different acid-base nature have been used for the FUR reduction into FOL through the MPV reaction. In spite of these aluminas require higher reaction temperature in comparison to other catalysts used in this reaction, the catalytic data reveal that these aluminas are highly selective to FOL, discarding the existence of cascade reaction leading to by-products. In the present work, the optimization of several parameters such as reaction time and temperature, the alcohol/FUR molar ratio, the catalyst loading and the type of sacrificing alcohol, has been also carried out in order to reach the highest FOL yield. The catalytic data have revealed that an increase of the temperature improves the FUR conversion and FOL yield as the reaction time progresses. Both isopropanol and 2-butanol reach higher conversion values due to the higher vapor pressure in comparison to cyclohexanol which is related to the lower rigidity of the sacrificing alcohol and higher miscibility with the FUR as well as the higher autogenous pressure, favoring the shifting of the reaction to the products. The catalytic data also showed that the presence of H2O in the reaction medium and/or the catalysts has an adverse effect in the catalytic behavior by the blockage of the Lewis acid sites and the conversion of the Lewis sites to Brönsted sites, which are inactive in the MPV reaction."
