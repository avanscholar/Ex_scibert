0,Introduction,"Due to the increase of continuously drinking and change of diet structures, the prevalence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has raised in China, becoming one of the leading causes for contributing to liver diseases and also caused morbidity and mortality worldwide [1,2]. Besides, as a condition comprising a spectrum of clinical signs and morphological changes including hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer, the ALD has affected people's living status and social stability [3]. And a lot of complications such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and hypertension can also be induced by ALD [4]. Most evidences have indicated that stimulated oxidative stress is the main cause of ALD pathogenesis, the possible mechanism may be that during the alcohol metabolism, the alcohol can be circulated into the microsome ethanol oxidation system and metabolized accompanying by reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation [5,6]. Meanwhile, there are increasing evidences that ROS can modify and inactivate proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby destroying normal cellular function [7]. Nowadays, bifendate with side-effects clinically is limited in applying to treat the hepatic related diseases. Therefore, to explore a new-style natural agent with antioxidant ability for intervening ALD is necessary and significant. In recent years, mushroom polysaccharides, the natural-occurring substances with hepatoprotective, antihypertensive, anti-aging, anti-hyperlipidemic, immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities, are generally separated from fruiting body, fermentation broth, mycelia and mushroom residues [4,8–11]. Coprinus comatus, a delicious edible fungus commonly named as shaggy mane, has highly nutritious including polysaccharides, fatty acids, tocopherols, organic acids, and phenolic acids, and widely cultivated in China, Korea, Japan and other Asian countries [12,13]. Many publications have demonstrated that it has various bioactivities such as antibacterial, antifungal, hypoglycaemic, immunomodulation, antitumor, antioxidant, and hypolipidemic effects [12,14]. Meantime, Li et al. have reported that polysaccharides from C. comatus (PCC) possess hypoglycemic activity [15,16]. Yu et al. have shown that selenium-PCC had hypoglycaemic, hypolipidemic, and antioxidant activities [17]. Cui et al. have displayed that PCC can inhibit tumor growth [18]. Ozalp et al. have found that PCC can treat and prevent liver injury induced by chronic alcohol [19]. Xu et al. have reported that PCC can enhance nonspecific immunity, cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity functions of the immunosuppressed mice [20]. However, there is little information regarding the hepatoprotective activity of modified PCC (MPCC) with the snailase treatment. The aim of this study was conducted to characterize MPCC and evaluate its hepatoprotective effects in alcohol-induced mice."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals The fruiting body of C. comatus was provided by Beijing Engineering Research Center for Edible Mushroom (Beijing, China). The reagents for analyzing superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Co. Ltd., (Nanjing, China). Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), interleukin-6 (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were obtained from Jiangsu Meibiao Biological Technology Co. Ltd., (Jiangsu, China). Monosaccharide standards of rhamnose (Rha), arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), mannose (Man), galactose (Gal), glucose (Glu), ribose (Rib) and fucose (Fuc) were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co. Ltd., (St. Louis, USA). All other chemicals of analytical grade used in this study were obtained from local chemical suppliers. The Kunming mice (male, 20 ± 2 g) in this experiment were obtained from Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Taian, China)."
3,Preparation of MPCC,"2.2 Preparation of MPCC The mixture including C. comatus powder and appropriate deionized water at 90 °C for 4 h was centrifuged at 2900g for 10 min to obtain the supernatant, which was concentrated, precipitated using 3 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol and stirred vigorously. After centrifugation (2900g, 10 min), the collected precipitate was deproteinated by the Sevage method [21], dialyzed, lyophilized and finally named as PCC. The MPCC was prepared on the basis of the previous method reported by Zhao et al. [10]. The PCC powder and snailase were mixed into sodium acetate buffer (50 mL, 1%, w/v) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation (2900g, 10 min), the resulting precipitate was processed by above method to obtain MPCC, which was lyophilized for future experiment."
4,Acute toxicity study,"2.3 Acute toxicity study The experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shandong Agricultural University in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. 1986 (amended 2013). Acute toxicity test in mice was performed according to the method reported by Zhang et al. [22]. The mice fed in a standard room under the conditions of temperature 22 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 50 ± 5% and a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice, acclimated for one week, were randomly divided into one dose-group and one control group (five mice in each group). The dose-group was treated with 5000 mg MPCC/kg by oral administration, and the control group received the isometric physiological saline (PS) for 14 days. All mice were allowed for food ad libitum and kept under regular observation for any mortality or behavioral changes. At the end of this acute toxicity study, all mice were weighed, and then sacrificed quickly by euthanasia. Blood were collected and centrifuged (3900g, 4 °C) for 10 min to obtain the serum for evaluating aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using an automatic biochemical analyzer (BS-380, Shenzhen, China). The liver, used for histological analysis, was rapidly fixed in formalin (10%, v/v), embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm pieces, dyed with hematoxylin and eosin and observed by a microscope under ×400 magnification."
5,Animal experiments,"2.4 Animal experiments The thirty acclimated mice were randomly divided into five groups (six mice in each group) including one PS group, one alcohol control (AC) group, one drug control (DC, 150 mg bifendate/kg body weight) group, one MPCC-300 (300 mg MPCC/kg body weight) group, and one MPCC-600 group (600 mg MPCC/kg body weight) group, while mice in the PS and AC groups were administrated with the same volume of PS. During this experiment, PS, MPCC and bifendate were given to mice by oral gavage. After 25 days, the mice except the PS group received 12 mL/kg alcohol solution (50%, v/v) every 12 h five times. After 12 h fasting following the last alcohol treatment, serum was collected using the above method for assaying AST, ALT, TC, TG, LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) using an automatic biochemical analyzer (BS-380, Shenzhen, China). The liver was surgically removed, weighed, and homogenized (10%, w/v) in phosphate buffer solution (0.2 M, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 2900g for 10 min to obtain liver homogenate for assessing ADH, iNOS, COX-2, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT activities, and IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, TC, and TG levels. Liver mitochondria were separated using a previously reported method [23]. Fresh liver was homogenized (1:9, w/v) in cold PS, centrifuged (600g, 4 °C) for 10 min, and the collected supernatant was centrifuged (8500g, 4 °C) for 15 min again to offer precipitation which was washed twice with cold PS and resuspended with PS to obtain liver mitochondria suspension for assaying SOD, GSH-Px, CAT activities and MDA levels. Liver microsomes were collected using the method reported by Jiang et al. [24]. Briefly, fresh liver was homogenized (1:4, w/v) in ice-cold buffer including 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.5 and centrifuged (9000g, 4 °C) for 20 min. The obtained supernatants and 88 mM CaCl2 solution (10:1, v/v) were mixed and centrifuged (27,000g, 4 °C) for 20 min to give microsomes for assaying CYP2E1 level. Furthermore, histological analysis of liver was processed using the above method."
6,Preliminary characterizations of MPCC,"2.5 Preliminary characterizations of MPCC 2.5.1 Monosaccharide compositions and molecular weights The monosaccharide composition of MPCC was assayed by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a Rtx-1 capillary column (30 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) using the method reported by Zhang et al. [25]. The MPCC was hydrolyzed by trifluoroacetic acid, acetylated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and pyridine and centrifuged to yield supernate (1 μL), which was injected into capillary column for investigating monosaccharide components using monosaccharide standards as comparison. The molecular weights were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a HPLC system (Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with a Shodex SB-806HQ column (8 mm × 300 mm, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and a refractive index detector. The injection volume was 100 μL, and the mobile phase was deionized water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. A series of standard dextrans (Sigma) were used to make the calibration curve, and the molecular weight was analyzed by Agilent GPC software. 2.5.2 Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra The MPCC was ground with dry KBr (1:10, w/w) and pressed into a tablet, which was analyzed on a 6700 Nicolet Fourier transform-infrared spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., USA) within wave numbers 4000–500 cm−1. 2.5.3 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra The MPCC, processed using deuterated water, were recorded using a Bruker AV-300 spectrometer (300 MHz, 25 °C)."
7,Statistical analysis,2.6 Statistical analysis All data were expressed as means ± SD (standard deviations). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by t-test in acute toxicity study and Duncan-test in other studies (SPSS software package). Differences between experimental groups were regarded as a statistically significant if P < 0.05.
8,Results,
9,Acute toxicity study,"3.1 Acute toxicity study In this test, the mice did not exhibit any mortality, abnormal behavior such as dyspnea, excitement, irregularity in walking, coma, and toxic symptoms during the supplement of MPCC when compared with the control group. Moreover, the body weights, physiological indexes (AST, ALT, TC and LDL-C) and histopathological observation of liver showed no significantly different between control and dose group (Fig. 1 ). These results indicated that the MPCC was practically a non-toxic substance."
10,Effect of MPCC on body weights and liver indexes,"3.2 Effect of MPCC on body weights and liver indexes As shown in Fig. 2 , there was no significant difference in body weights among all groups at the end of the experiment. The liver index in the AC group was elevated when compared to that in the PS group (P < 0.05). However, there is no significance statistically in liver index among the MPCC-600, MPCC-300, AC and DC groups."
11,Effects of MPCC on ALT and AST activities,"3.3 Effects of MPCC on ALT and AST activities Alcohol administration significantly elevated the activities of serum ALT and AST in comparison with those of the PS group (P < 0.05, Fig. 3A and B), manifesting that liver injury induced by alcohol had occurred in mice and the model was successfully established in this work. However, the supplement of MPCC reversed alcohol-induced increases of ALT and AST with a dose-dependent manner when compared to the PS group (P < 0.05)."
12,Effects of MPCC on hepatic lipid levels,"3.4 Effects of MPCC on hepatic lipid levels TC and TG levels in liver tissue were displayed in Fig. 3C and D. Distinct increases of hepatic TC and TG were found in the AC group as compared to the PS group (P < 0.05), demonstrating that lipid metabolism was damaged by alcohol. MPCC-600 and MPCC-300 pretreatments significantly lowered TC and TG levels."
13,Effects of MPCC on alcohol metabolizing enzymes,"3.5 Effects of MPCC on alcohol metabolizing enzymes As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the mice in the AC group exhibited significant decrease in hepatic ADH activity and increase in mitochondrial CYP2E1 levels (P < 0.05) when compared with the PS group, testifying that alcohol dehydrogenase oxidation system and microsome alcohol oxidation system were partly destroyed. Compared to the AC group, the activity of ADH in liver was enhanced markedly (P < 0.05) and the level of CYP2E1 in microsome was reduced observably (P < 0.05) by the MPCC administration."
14,Effects of MPCC on serum lipids,"3.6 Effects of MPCC on serum lipids As displayed in Fig. 4C–F, the TC, TG and LDL-C levels were obviously enhanced, while the HDL-C level was reduced in the AC group compared to the results in the NC group (with all P < 0.05), manifesting that metabolic disorder of serum lipids had occurred by alcohol treatment. Interestingly, after the supplement of MPCC-600 and MPCC-300, these changes had been improved. Briefly, TC, TG and LDL-C levels in the MPCC-600 group reached 1.95 ± 0.28 mM, 1.29 ± 0.14 mM and 1.89 ± 0.15 mM, respectively, which were lower than those in the AC group. While HDL-C levels in the MPCC-600 and MPCC-300 groups were 1.43 ± 0.11 mM and 1.38 ± 0.09 mM, which were higher than that in the AC group."
15,Effects of MPCC on antioxidant enzymes and MDA in liver homogenate and mitochondria,"3.7 Effects of MPCC on antioxidant enzymes and MDA in liver homogenate and mitochondria The distinct decreases of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities were found in liver homogenate and mitochondria of alcohol-induced mice as compared to the PS group (Fig. 5A–C and E–G, P < 0.05), respectively, indicating that the mice treated with alcohol suffered from oxidative stress. However, reductions of these parameters were significantly ameliorated by treatment with MPCC when compared with AC group. The hepatic and mitochondrial SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities of MPCC-treatment groups were expressed dose-dependently. The activities of hepatic SOD, GSH-Px and CAT reached the maximum in the MPCC-600 group, which were 83.72%, 166.78% and 63.12% higher than those in the AC group, respectively. The mitochondrial SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities were 67.03%, 92.00% and 51.61% higher than those in the AC group. Besides, hepatic and mitochondrial MDA levels were significantly enhanced by inducement of alcohol in comparison with those in the PS group (P < 0.05). After treatment with MPCC, the abnormal increases were suppressed. MDA levels in liver and mitochondria were decreased by 48.39% and 51.28% in the MPCC-600 group, and decreased by 41.94% and 39.74%, respectively."
16,Effects of MPCC on histopathological changes,"3.8 Effects of MPCC on histopathological changes Representative photomicrographs of livers from different groups were revealed in Fig. 6 . The PS group showed normal hepatocyte morphology, abundant cytoplasm, clear nucleus, distinct cell boundaries, well-ordered hepatocyte and no symptoms of fat degeneration (Fig. 6A). Inversely, the serious liver damage, characterized by cellular degeneration, hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocyte disarrangement and lipid droplet accumulation, was found in the AC group (Fig. 6B) when compared with the PS group. However, alcohol-induced serious liver damage was improved by treatment with MPCC (Fig. 6C and D)."
17,Effects of MPCC on inflammatory response,"3.9 Effects of MPCC on inflammatory response Compared with those of the PS group, there was a remarkable elevation in the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2 in the AC group (Fig. 7 , P < 0.05). However, treatment with MPCC significantly attenuated these parameters levels compared with those as compared with those in the AC group (P < 0.05)."
18,Polysaccharide characterizations,"3.10 Polysaccharide characterizations The monosaccharide composition of MPCC was determined in comparison with retention time of guide monosaccharides (Fig. 8A). As is clear from Fig. 8B, MPCC was made up of seven different monosaccharides (Fuc, Rib, Ara, Xyl, Man, Gal and Glu) with a percentage composition of 0.91%, 0.71%, 0.45%, 1.60%, 2.04%, 4.41% and 89.88%, demonstrating that MPCC was a heteropolysaccharide and glucose is the main sugar unit. Based on the results of HPLC, The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PCC were 143.0 kDa and 98.3 kDa, while the MPCC were 121.0 kDa and 87.5 kDa, respectively (Fig. C). FT-IR spectroscopy was used for identifying the polysaccharides structures such as monosaccharide types, glycosidic bonds and functional groups ranging from 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1. A strong peak at 3389 cm−1 of hydroxyl groups with stretching vibration, a weak peak at 2931 cm−1 of CH stretching vibrations, a strong peak at 1600 cm−1 of CO vibration, and a peak at 1405 cm−1 of CO (COOH) stretching vibrations were found in the FT-IR spectra of MPCC (Fig. 8D). The stretching peaks at 1152 cm−1 of asymmetric vibration of COC glycosidic rings indicated that MPCC was pyran-polysaccharide [26,27]. Moreover, MPCC showed a peak at 1152 cm−1–1131 cm−1, which was due to the presence of β-(1 → 4)-glucan and β-(1 → 4) xylan units and galactose units with any link type and position [28,29]. The lower frequencies at 1078 cm−1–1034 cm−1 were polysaccharides with Fuc, Rib, Ara and Man, and the characteristic absorptions at 708 cm−1, 805 cm−1, 840 cm−1 and 947 cm−1 showed the presence of α- and β-configurations in MPCC [26,30]. NMR is the most powerful and available instrument for assaying the polysaccharide structures. The peaks were observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy of MPCC (Fig. 8E and F). The 1H NMR spectrum was crowded in a narrow region from 3.00 ppm to 5.40 ppm and 13C NMR spectrum was gathered ranging from 60 ppm to 110 ppm, indicating MPCC was typical of polysaccharide [31]. The resonance signals of anomeric proton at 4.44 ppm–5.40 ppm and anomeric carbon at 90 ppm–110 ppm showed MPCC was a polysaccharide with α- and β-configurations [31,32]. The signals at 5.40 ppm, 5.19 ppm, 4.93 ppm, 4.50 ppm, 4.44 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, and the signals at 104.90 ppm, 98.57 ppm, and 93.32 ppm were attributed to H–1 and C–1, and signals at δH 3.00–4.17 and δC 60–90 were ascribed to H2–H6 and C2–C6, respectively. Furthermore, the 1H chemical shift at 5.19 ppm was assigned to an anomeric proton of glucopyranose units in the main chain and 13C chemical shift at 98.57 ppm also supported the above inference [33]. The signals at 4.44 ppm and 4.50 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra and the signal at 104.90 ppm in the 13C NMR spectra could be derived from galactopyroanoses."
19,Discussion,"The polysaccharides from medicinal mushrooms have become a research hotspot. However, little attention has been focused on the modified polysaccharides. As the polysaccharides can be hydrolyzed by glycosidase, the enzymes of cellulose, pectinase, lyase, chitosanase, glucanase and its complex (e.g. snailase) are commonly used in polysaccharides modifications. Moreover, Yang et al., Wu et al. Jia et al. Ma et al. and Gao et al. have reported that enzyme-modified polysaccharides possess superior biological activities and good water-solubility, high stability, safety and non-poisonous [34–38]. Therefore, in this work we selected snailase to modify PCC. MPCC pretreatments at 300 mg/kg or 600 mg/kg attenuated hepatic injuries, disorders of liver and blood lipid, and inflammatory response induced by alcohol, while our histological results supported that treatment with MPCC improved alcohol-induced hepatic injury, indicating that MPCC had a hepatoprotective effect against acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. Alcohol administration leads to AST and ALT leakage into the serum, which is reason that liver cells damage and/or hepatocytes necrosis induces membrane permeability increased [39]. AST and ALT in serum are commonly identified as major indexes for diagnosing hepatic injury. AST leak, an obvious marker of relatively severe liver injury, can reflect mitochondrial damage. However, ALT is more credible, which is due to that its half-life is longer than that of AST. It was found that the serum AST and ALT activities in the AC group were higher than those in the PS group. In various literatures, it was also reported that alcohol-induced AST and ALT activities in serum were elevated during alcoholic liver disease [2,40]. However, the supplement of MPCC inhibited the increases of AST and ALT activities induced alcohol, suggesting that MPCC can enhance cytomembrane stability, thereby repairing the alcohol-damaged liver function. The above results were also supported by pathological observations. Formation of liver lipid is the earliest and most common response to excessive drinking [41]. Hepatic steatosis is induced by alcohol intake, which is due to fat accumulation in the liver. When liver disease is in the initial stage, stacking TC and TG in hepatocytes cause the hepatic fat development [42]. In our work, levels of TC and TG were reduced significantly in the MPCC-treatment groups compared to those in the AC group, indicating that MPCC can lower the risk of alcohol-induced liver fat formation. These results are consistent with other reports that some polysaccharides show effective in reducing hepatic lipids induced by alcohol [43]. Alcohol metabolism is mainly through two pathways including alcohol dehydrogenase oxidation system and microsome alcohol oxidation system [4]. Ninety percent of alcohol intake is partly oxidized by gastric ADH at first, and then the rest is assimilated through the portal bloodstream into the liver and metabolized by hepatic ADH in alcohol dehydrogenase oxidation system [44]. About 10% alcohol intake is metabolized by CYP2E1 in microsome alcohol oxidation system [45]. CYP2E1, an enzyme from the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, is a major contributor to oxidative stress and liver injury induced by alcohol [39]. Many reports have indicated that mice of CYP2E1 knockout can diminish alcohol-induced oxidative stress, while regaining CYP2E1 in mice of CYP2E1 knockout restores oxidative stress induced by alcohol [46,47]. In the present work, MPCC administration in alcohol-fed mice elevated ADH activity and decreased CYP2E1 level, testifying that MPCC can repair alcohol-destroyed alcohol metabolism systems. Some publications have proved the alcohol-induced hepatic injury is related to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [48]. Overproduction of ROS including hydroxyl, superoxide anion, DPPH radicals and hydrogen peroxide, induced by binge alcohol consumption, plays an important role in the development of ALD [1]. Therefore, elevating scavenging abilities against ROS is necessary to treat and prevent ALD. In vivo, antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH-Px and CAT, important defense enzymes against alcohol-induced oxidative damage, can counterbalance the antioxidant and oxidative system [2,40]. These antioxidant enzymes can be induced by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2, which can up-regulate the transcription of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT. In the present work, MPCC significantly increased the SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities as compared to the AC group, which may be that MPCC activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 in mice livers. These results indicated that the activities of antioxidant enzymes might be one of the main mechanisms for contributing to the protective effects of MPCC against alcohol-induced liver injury. Meantime, Koch et al. have indicated that scavenging free radical is believed to play a central role in treating and preventing alcohol-induced liver injury [49]. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation, a primary index for estimating oxidative injury, can damage structure and/or function of cytomembrane [48]. MDA, an important product of lipid peroxidation, is formed by ROS interacting with polyunsaturated fatty acid [50]. The present work showed that MPCC administration reversed the increase of MDA induced by alcohol. ALD is clinically accompanied by serious dyslipidaemia, which could be evaluated by the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C [43]. HDL-C is “beneficial” to human health, which is due to that HDL-C can carry cholesterol/cholesterol esters in peripheral tissues/cells by blood circulation to the liver for catabolism, thereby reducing the risk of cholesterol [51]. LDL-C in endarterium may be oxidized into ox-LDL-C, which lower combining capacity of LDL-C and specific membrane receptors [52] Thus, a mass of LDL-C is stuck in bloodstream, causing the development of hyperlipidaemia. In the present work, blood lipid levels were observably ameliorated in the alcohol-induced mice following the gavage of MPCC, indicating that MPCC can attenuate alcohol-induced dyslipidemia. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of ALD [53]. Excessive alcohol intake can activate inflammatory responses, thereby releasing inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6 [54]. TNF-α promotes neutrophil migration, which can induce hepatic injury due to overproduction of proteolytic enzymes and ROS [55]. IL-6 can expedite several inflammatory diseases for liver injury and malignant tumor [50]. In addition, binge alcohol consumption can also cause the overexpression of inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2), which can accelerate the production of down-stream factors for contributing to the pathogenesis of acute and chronic liver inflammation [40,56]. Experimental investigations have shown that treatment with MPCC significantly inhibited the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2, demonstrating that MPCC can diminish alcohol- induced inflammatory response. The monosaccharide composition of MPCC was composed of seven monosaccharides of Fuc, Rib, Ara, Xyl, Man, Gal and Glu. However, Dobruchowska et al. have showed that monosaccharide composition of water-extracted PCC contains Glu, Gal, Fuc, Man [15], and Liu et al. have reported that monosaccharide composition of water-extracted PCC includes Fuc, Gal, Man, Xyl and Glu [16], which were not consistent with our GC result. By HPLC analysis, we found that Mw of MPCC were smaller than that of PCC. Yang et al. have reported that Mw of polysaccharides treated with enzyme is lowered comparing to untreated polysaccharides [34]. Meantime, Chen et al. have showed low-Mw polysaccharides possess superior biological activity, compared with high-Mw polysaccharides [57]. By FT-IP and NMR spectrum analysis, MPCC was a polysaccharide with α- and β-configurations, which was different from water-extracted PCC with α-configuration [15,16]. These differences might be ascribed to that the snailase had altered the characterizations of this polysaccharide. Jia et al. have indicated that the molecular weight and monosaccharide compositions of enzyme-treated polysaccharides could be changed when compared to untreated polysaccharides [36]."
20,Conclusions,"MPCC exposed in vivo antioxidant, hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities in alcohol-induced mice. Moreover, the characterization analysis showed that MPCC was a pyran-polysaccharide with α- and β-configuration containing of Fuc, Rib, Ara, Xyl, Man, Gal and Glu. The present conclusions demonstrated that MPCC could be considered as a potential healthcare food to prevent and alleviate the alcohol-induced liver injury and its complications."
