0,Introduction,"Triarylmethylium ions are among the most stable carbocations, owing to the delocalization of the positive charge over the three aromatic rings, and they play an important role in organic chemistry (Fig. 1 ) [1]. Triarylmethylium ions are readily generated from the corresponding alcohol or ether by treatment with an acid catalyst. This particular feature renders the triarylmethyl group a suitable protecting group for not only hydroxyl groups but also other heteroatom-containing functionalities [2]. Indeed, the triarylmethyl protection is applicable in diverse organic and bioorganic chemistry fields, including nucleoside, oligonucleotide, peptide, and carbohydrate chemistry. When the aromatic unit of the triarylmethylium ion bears an oxygen or nitrogen substituent at the para- or ortho-position, the cation tends to isomerize into the quinoid form, a key structural component of organic dyes, such as rosolic acid and malachite green, and xanthene fluorophores, such as fluorescein and rhodamine. In addition, the parent tritylium ion and its derivatives are isoelectronic to triarylboranes and exhibit Lewis acidity as they can accept an electron pair into their low-lying empty p-orbital [3], which allows for not only the activation of Lewis bases but also hydride abstraction (dehydridation); the latter is a salient property of the triarylmethylium ion as it is very rare for organic molecules to be capable of dehydridation [4]. In comparison to base-promoted deprotonative reactions, alternative dehydridation-initiated transformations have been far less studied, primarily due to the scarcity of dehydridating reagents as such that organic molecules capable of exerting dehydridation activity are virtually limited to triarylmethylium ions and quinones [5,6]. Furthermore, despite the fact that dehydridative oxidation of heteroatom-containing functionalities, such as alcohols and amines, via the generation of cationic species represents a powerful tool for selective functional-group manipulation, the development of a catalytic system still remains a significant challenge as the regeneration of dehydridating reagents is generally difficult [7]. Upon dehydridation, dehydridating reagents are converted into their reduced form, such as triarylmethane and hydroquinone, and re-oxidation to the active form often requires over-stoichiometric amounts of strong oxidants, possibly causing substrate or product decomposition [5a]. While a few systems involving metal-catalyzed regeneration of quinones as dehydridating reagents have been reported, the design of regenerable dehydridation reagents has never met with success. Herein, we describe our molecular design strategy for imparting regenerability to triarylmethylium ions, enabling them to act as catalysts for the dehydridative oxidation of benzylic alcohols under mild and operationally simple conditions [8]."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Molecular design of the dehydridative catalyst,"2.1 Molecular design of the dehydridative catalyst To design a dehydridation catalyst, we hypothesized that enhancement in the stability of the triarylmethylium ion by contriving the molecular structure could render its regeneration process favorable. As commonly understood, the introduction of an electron-donating group to one of the aromatic units of a triarylmethylium ion stabilizes the cation through the formation of a quinoid counterpart. In other words, one of the canonical structures of a quinone methide (QM) possessing two aromatic substituents on the terminal sp2 carbon can be regarded as a triarylmethylium surrogate [9]. However, while QM is known to be a highly reactive electrophile that undergoes conjugate addition of a nucleophile at the partially cationic benzylic carbon, the contribution of its zwitterionic resonance form, featuring triarylmethylium and aryloxide moieties, is considered to be infinitely small [10]. With these characteristics in mind, we reasoned that endowing QMs with molecular distortion pertinent to weaken the conjugation of the carbonyl and olefin functionalities would allow us to elicit dehydridation activity. To this end, we sought to introduce an overcrowded olefinic component [11] into the QM framework to effectively disrupt the conjugation by interfering with the inherent planarity and adopted ortho-QM (o-QM) of type A as the primary structural platform for accessing a catalytically competent triarylmethylium ion (Fig. 2 ). We assessed the validity of our hypothesis by investigating the intrinsic reactivity of 2-naphthol-derived, isolable o-QM 1 toward an organic hydride donor (Fig. 3 a) [12]. Thus, 1 was treated with an equimolar amount of 2-phenyl benzothiazoline [13] in CDCl3 at ambient temperature; 1H NMR analysis of the resulting reaction mixture indicated that 1,4-reduction had not occurred. We surmised that the lack of reactivity of 1 was probably due to the insufficient cationicity of its β-carbon. This rationale prompted us to prepare o-QM 2H featuring a 10,10-dimethyl-9(10H)-anthracenylidene framework with assumption that increased steric congestion around the olefinic core would induce structural distortion beneficial for weakening the conjugation with the carbonyl group (Fig. 3b). Indeed, treatment of 2H with 2-phenyl benzothiazoline resulted in the 1,4-reduction to afford 2H–H2 in a moderate yield, implying the enhanced zwitterionic character of 2H. To gain insight into the origin of the reactivity difference between 1 and 2H, we initially pursued spectroscopic analysis. However, the negligible difference between the maximum absorption wavelengths of 1 and 2H suggested a similarity in their effective conjugation length and degree of zwitterionic character (Fig. 4 a). Although subsequent single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis also revealed that 1 and 2H have nearly identical anti-folded structures around the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, prominent distortion was observed in 2H, as the mean plane dihedral angle of the benzocyclohexadienone subunit (142.21°) was considerably smaller than that of 1 (153.68°) (Fig. 4b and c). In addition, the dihydroanthracene subunit of 2H was significantly bent (121.53°) to minimize the steric repulsion between the substituents on the olefinic carbons in the fjord region. These distorted structures can be reproduced in simulations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (SMD(CH2Cl2)-CAMB3LYP/6-31 + G(d) level) [14], which indicated that the distortion in the crystal structure did not stem from the crystal packing force (see SI). Based on these results and the computationally optimized structure of 2H–H2 comprising planar 2-naphthol and dihydroanthracene subunits (see SI), it appears that the dehydridation activity of 2H originates from release of the distortion through hydride acceptance. However, degree of distortion seemed insufficient for increasing the contribution of the zwitterionic resonance form to an extent whereby 2H was capable of abstracting a hydride from less reactive donors such as cyclohexa-1,4-diene (Fig. 5 a). This interpretation is consistent with the observation that the addition of a catalytic quantity of methanesulfonic acid (MsOH) to the reaction of 2H with cyclohexa-1,4-diene facilitated the production of 2H–H2 at ambient temperature, most likely as a consequence of increased intervention of the zwitterionic structure in its protonated, carbocationic form. The generation of this intermediate was visualized as a color change of the reaction solution from pale yellow to deep red upon the introduction of MsOH. The reddish color was indicative of carbocationic character, and X-ray diffraction analysis of the deep-red single crystal of 2H–HBF4 prepared separately from 2H–H2O and HBF4 revealed its three-dimensional structure bearing a benzylic carbocation (Fig. 5b). The nearly perpendicularly connected 2-naphthol and dihydroanthracene subunits (torsion angle: 78.1°) were both planar, meaning that the structural distortion in the precursor 2H was completely released. The benzylic carbon adopts an sp2-hybridized planar structure (sum of the angles: 360°) in accordance with its cationic character responsible for high reactivity, as illustrated by the smooth reaction of 2H–HBF4 with cyclohexa-1,4-diene to afford 2H–H2 in 83% yield (Fig. 5c). As the participation of the zwitterionic form was of critical relevance to the operation of the dehydridation process, we considered the possibility of generating the zwitterionic form without the use of acidic additives. Because overcrowded olefins with an anti-folded structure are known to twist around the CC bond axis upon photoexcitation via biradical formation [15], we reasoned that o-QM 2H with a push-pull-type structure could be converted into the zwitterionic resonance form upon photoexcitation via intramolecular charge-transfer state with concurrent molecular motion. The validity of this hypothesis was evaluated by the examination of the photoexcitation process of 2H using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations (SMD(CH2Cl2)-TD-CAMB3LYP/6-31 + G(d) level) (Fig. 6 a). Local excitation of the ground state of 2H (S0) followed by vibrational relaxation and internal conversion furnishes the lowest-lying first singlet excited state (S1) (ΔE = 3.28 eV). Because the double-bond character of the overcrowded olefinic core is annulled with the formation of the biradical, the structural distortion in the S1 state with the anti-folded conformation is spontaneously released via the unfolding process. The resulting twisted S1 ( t S1) state, consisting of two perpendicularly connected planar subunits, is 2.15 eV more stable than parent S1. Finally, the zwitterionic form of 2H ( t S0) requisite for acting as the dehydridating reagent is furnished through the relaxation of t S1, which is expected to be rapid owing to the small energy gap (ΔΔE = 0.43 eV) between t S1 and t S0. The calculated molecular orbitals of t S0 indicated intramolecular charge separation, and the largest orbital lobe in the LUMO was located on the benzylic carbon, reflecting the zwitterionic character of t S0 (Fig. 6b). The similarity between the structures of 2H–HBF4 and t S0 calculated at the SMD(CH2Cl2)-TD-CAMB3LYP/6-31 + G(d) level signified the importance of the cationicity of the benzylic carbon in the zwitterionic form of 2H for attaining dehydridation reactivity. Although refolding of t S0 (ΔE = 0.70 eV) to S0 is thermodynamically favorable, as seen in Fig. 6c, it involves a two-step transition process after conformational relaxation to give int1; namely, bending of the dihydroanthracene subunit along the C9–C10 axis with an increase in the double-bond character of the bridging bond to afford int2, and subsequent rotation around the bridging bond. While the energetic barriers for the two transition states (TS1 and TS2) were estimated to be very low, this profile of the transition process suggests that the lifetime of t S0 allows it to participate in the intermolecular dehydridation reaction. These computational analyses led us to appraise the feasibility of photo-induced generation of the zwitterionic form experimentally by irradiating a mixture of 2H and cyclohexa-1,4-diene in CH2Cl2 at ambient temperature, which afforded 2H–H2 in 56% yield (Scheme 1 )."
3,Catalytic dehydridative oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols,"2.2 Catalytic dehydridative oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols Having verified the viability of effectively generating the zwitterionic resonance form of o-QM 2H under visible-light irradiation both theoretically and experimentally, we aimed to apply 2H as a dehydridation catalyst. To this end, we chose the dehydridative oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols as a model reaction and evaluated the intrinsic reactivity of 2H. Because the simple treatment of 1-(4-methylphenyl)ethanol (3a) with 5 mol% of 2H in dichloromethane at ambient temperature for 12 h did not result in the formation of the corresponding ketone, we first confirmed the effect of the Brønsted acid co-catalyst using MsOH (5 mol%), where 4-methyl acetophenone (4a) was obtained in 4% yield (Table 1, entry 1). On the other hand, performing the reaction under blue LED irradiation (456 nm) and otherwise similar conditions afforded 4a in 17% yield, which exceeded the amount of 2H used as a catalyst (entry 2), implying the ability of 2H to act as a dehydridation catalyst (turnover number = >3). The results of subsequent experiments performed to understand the regeneration process of 2H showed that traces of oxygen could oxidize 2H–H2 under light irradiation, as conducting the reaction under air or oxygen atmosphere significantly improved catalytic efficiency, while oxidation was suppressed under argon atmosphere (entries 3–5). The role of oxygen as a terminal oxidant was further confirmed by the detection of hydrogen peroxide as a Ti-oxo-complex in the crude reaction mixture (see SI) [16]. This observation suggested that the regeneration process of 2H was likely facilitated by active oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen or superoxide [17]. In the UV–vis spectrum of 2H–H2, the absorption terminus reaches 470 nm; hence, 2H–H2 can be excited by blue-light irradiation, thereby sensitizing O2 for excitation. The energy of 2H–H2 in the excited state was estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is sufficient to activate ground-state triplet O2. Although the TD-DFT analysis also suggested the feasibility of an alternative process, that is, the participation of an electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex of 2H–H2 and O2 followed by photoexcitation, careful examination of the UV–vis spectra of 2H–H2 under both Ar and O2 atmospheres did not provide any evidence for the formation of the EDA complex. We then attempted the oxidation of 3a by employing 2H–H2 as a catalyst under aerobic photoirradiation conditions and observed comparable reactivity to that of 2H, verifying the catalyst turnover (entry 6). An additional important finding was that the installation of a bromo substituent on the 2-naphthol subunit of the catalyst was beneficial for improving the catalytic activity, and 6-bromo derivative 2Br–H2 facilitated the near-complete conversion of 3a to 4a within 12 h (entry 7). While the origin of the reactivity enhancement is yet to be clarified, it probably stems from the extension of the absorption wavelength resulting from the introduction of the bromo appendage. It is worth noting that the importance of the overcrowded olefinic component of 2H for acting as a competent dehydridation catalyst was verified by comparing its reactivity to that of 1 (entry 8). The substrate scope for the oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols 3 under the dehydridative catalysis of 2Br–H2 was explored, and the representative results are listed in Table 2 . In general, smooth conversion of 3 was achieved using 5 mol% of 2Br–H2 to give the corresponding ketones 4 in high yield. The introduction of an arbitrary group to the aromatic substituent of 3 was tolerated irrespective of its position and electronic character although the attachment of an electron-donating group tended to decrease the reactivity (entries 1–10). Variation in the alkyl substituent (R) of 3 was also possible, and both liner and branched chains were well accommodated (entries 11–15). Chemoselective oxidation of a benzylic alcohol over an aliphatic alcohol was achieved when a diol was used as the substrate (entry 16). It should be added that the protocol is scalable, as demonstrated with 3a as the substrate (entry 17). However, as expected, the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols was not feasible under the present reaction conditions, (Ph(CH2)3OH: <5%, cyclohexanol: 5%), and allylic and propargylic alcohols afforded complex mixtures as a result of inevitable competitive side reactions."
4,Catalytic dehydridative oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols,"2.3 Catalytic dehydridative oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols Having established the conditions for the oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols, we turned our attention to the oxidation of primary alcohols 5, the benzylic hydrogens of which are less hydridic. In this case, controlling product distribution between the aldehyde and carboxylic acid is often problematic [18]. However, we expected that 2Br-catalyzed aerobic oxidation under light irradiation would predominantly afford carboxylic acids because of the following reasons: 1) hydrogen peroxide is generated in the catalyst-regeneration process, and 2) the initially formed aldehyde would thus be converted into a perhydrate possessing an acetal hydrogen, which is more reactive toward dehydridation than the benzylic hydrogen of the starting primary alcohol (Scheme 2 ). An initial attempt was made by exposing 1-(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (5a) to the reaction conditions optimized for the oxidation of secondary alcohols for 24 h, which gave the corresponding carboxylic acid 6a albeit in a very low yield, as determined after conversion to methyl ester 7a (Table 3 , entry 1). Interestingly, the use of the hydrated form of 2Br (2Br–H2O) as a catalyst delivered significant improvement in the catalytic efficiency to allow the isolation of 7a in 74% yield, meaning that the photo-induced generation of catalytically active 2Br was operative (entry 2) [9c,19]. To obtain experimental support for the dehydridative oxidation of the perhydrate generated from the transiently formed aldehyde, we examined the reaction in the presence of methanol. If hemiacetal formation from the aldehyde and methanol competed with the generation of the perhydrate, subsequent dehydridation of the hemiacetal would directly afford 7a. In fact, the reaction of 5a conducted with 10 equivalents of methanol under otherwise identical conditions to those for entry 2 furnished 7a in 35% yield with the concomitant formation of aldehyde 8a (23%) (Scheme 3 ). While this result clearly indicated the intervention of presumed perhydrate oxidation, the presence of methanol caused a non-negligible decrease in reactivity. We inferred that methanol might impede hydrogen-bonding interactions between 2Br and 5a, which would play an important role in facilitating oxidation. The theoretical analysis of the possible transition states of the 2Br-promoted dehydridation delineated the structure, in which the hydrogen bond between the OH proton of the starting benzylic alcohol and the aryloxide moiety of 2Br contributes to positioning the benzylic hydrogen near the carbocationic site of the catalyst, rendering the concerted deprotonative dehydridation pathway favorable to afford the aldehyde (Fig. 7 ). The comparison of the energy of this transition state structure (ΔG = 16.4 kcal/mol, SMD(CH2Cl2)-M06/cc-pVTZ level) [20,21] with that of the most stable transition state structure (ΔG = 24.1 kcal/mol) modeled for the stepwise dehydridation pathway without hydrogen-bonding interactions corroborated the importance of hydrogen-bond-assisted preorganization for attaining sufficient reactivity. We then investigated the applicability of the oxidation protocol to other primary benzylic alcohols 5. As seen in the representative results in Table 3, the electronic and steric nature of the para-substituent had a marginal influence on the reaction profile, and the corresponding methyl esters 7 were generally obtained in good yields (entries 3–9). Although this catalytic system was sensitive to the presence of ortho- or meta-substituents on the substrates, meta-chlorophenyl and ortho-methylphenyl methanols could be oxidized in moderate yields (entries 10 and 11)."
5,Conclusion,"An overcrowded olefinic framework was introduced into the o-QM structure enabling them to function as triarylmethylium surrogates. The design element was aimed at inducing structural distortion to increase the contribution of the zwitterionic resonance form of o-QM, and the dehydridation activity thereof was fully realized via photoexcitation. Harnessing this salient feature of the newly devised o-QM enabled dehydridative catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols under aerobic photoirradiation conditions. The combination of experimental and computational analyses supports that the ground-state zwitterionic intermediate acts as a dehydridation-active species and that o-QM is regenerated from its reduced form by either singlet oxygen or superoxide. We believe that this study offers valuable insights into the development of organic molecules capable of dehydridative catalysis and their synthetic applications."
