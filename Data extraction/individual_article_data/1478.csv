0,Introduction,"Among available renewable resources, only biomass contains the carbon and hydrogen that can be converted into fuels for the transportation sector and chemical production. Advanced thermochemical technologies, i.e. pyrolysis and gasification, are considered as potential approaches to reduce the heavy dependency upon fossil fuels in the transportation sector (>90% from fossil based fuels) and their associated environmental impacts. Direct conversion of biomass into liquid fuel via pyrolysis is still encountering a number of issues due to thermally and chemically unstable liquid products. However, biomass can be converted into gas via gasification that can be either used for transportation fuels, i.e. H2 or converted further into hydrocarbons (via a Fischer-Tropsch synthetic route) or methanol. The concept of gasification of coal is well-known but there are issues when the same approach is applied to biomass. This is because biomass consists of 75–85% volatile matter as compared to only 20–35% in coal. Large amounts of volatiles in biomass are released rapidly in a very narrow temperature range (250–400 °C) [1,2] potentially leading to the formation of high molecular weight compounds (known as tar) which are difficult to break down in later stages of processing and end up in the gas stream [3,4]. Tar condenses at low temperatures (<60 °C) causing operational difficulties for the downstream process (e.g. corrosion, clogging and fouling of installations) [4–6], requiring tar treatment/removal steps. In addition, some carbon and hydrogen content of the feedstock is lost, thus reducing the energy efficiency of the process. Therefore, fully understanding the effect of the pyrolysis on gasification stages is crucial to obtain high quality gas products in a gasification process. Extensive research has been done on the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, focusing on the effects of operating conditions on yields and properties of the process e.g. temperature [7–14], heating rate [15–19], vapour residence time [17,20–23] and particle size of the feedstock [19,22,24–27]. However, these studies investigated pyrolysis as a single process without providing any links between the physicochemical properties of pyrolysis products and the operating parameters in the pyrolysis process that are required for syngas/hydrogen production via a gasification route. In this study, the effect of pyrolysis conditions on the gasification process in terms of quality of synthetic gas (syngas) and tar formation was investigated via two-stage gasification in which feedstock was decomposed into intermediate products and subsequently gasified, to provide an operating window for developing a simple, highly efficient and robust gasification unit that can be used for green hydrogen production without major downstream processing to remove impurities."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock Waste wood obtained from Sustainable Campus, Newcastle University, was ground and sieved to 850 μm for characterisation (Fig. 1 a) and cut into cubes of 0.5 cm3, 1 cm3 and 2 cm3 using a circular saw for experimental tests (Fig. 1b). The waste wood had a very high volatile matter (84 wt%) and low ash content (<1 wt%) compared to coal (20–35 wt% volatile and 10–20 wt% ash) as shown in Table 1 . As a result, tighter controls are required in the oxidation step in the gasification process to ensure that all volatiles have a good contact time with the oxidising agent in order to get high quality gas and a char product which is highly reactive for solid-gas reactions occurring in a very short contact time (1–2 s) at high temperatures (>800 °C), i.e. minimising the diffusion limitations to convert all the carbon content in the char into gas. Waste wood had an empirical formula of C6H11O5.5N0.04 with 51 wt% oxygen content compared to around 7–10 wt% in coal."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Approximately 25.0 ± 0.1 g of the waste wood (size 0.5, 1 or 2 cm3) was placed in the centre of a 33 mm diameter and 830 mm long Inconel 600 fixed bed (Fig. 2 a). Prior to the experiments, the reactor was continuously purged with N2. As soon as the system was air free (confirmed by gas chromatography), the N2 was adjusted to a fixed flow rate of 30 or 120 ml/min to study the effect of vapour residence time (1–3 s) on product yields and properties in the pyrolysis step. The heating system was switched on at a fixed heating rate of 20 °C/min; it was found in preliminary trials in this study that there was no significant effect of the heating rate on product yields and characterisation of products between 5 and 20 °C/min. As soon as the set temperature reached, i.e. 600, 700, 800 or 900 °C, the system was held for a further 15 min before being switched off to ensure full decomposition of the volatiles released. The volatiles released from the pyrolysis were cooled down in two condensers, kept in an ice bath (0 °C), whereas the non-condensable gas was collected in a 500 ml tedlar sample bag for gas analysis. The solid residues and condensable liquid were collected and weighted for their yields and stored in glass bottles for further analysis when the reactor temperature was below 50 °C. The experimental set-up to examine the effect of pyrolysis product properties on the gasification stage is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The volatiles released from the pyrolysis were passed through a char bed (which was produced by pyrolysis of waste wood at different temperatures of 600, 700, 800 or 900 °C as described previously) heated at 1000 °C. As soon as the volatiles from the pyrolysis stage were released (around 290–300 °C), steam was injected at the T-mixer before going into the gasification reactor at a steam to carbon in biomass (S/C) molar ratio of 5.7. The product collection and analysis procedure was the same as described previously in the pyrolysis step."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis Solid residues (char) were tested for their proximate analysis including moisture content, volatile matter and ash content based on a British standard (BS-1016-6). The physical morphology of the waste wood sample before and after the pyrolysis was examined by a Hitachi TM 3030 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) operated at a 15 kV accelerating voltage. The specific surface area of char was determined from three random ground samples taken from a bulk sample by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption technique using a Thermo Scientific Surfer Gas Adsorption Porosimeter. There was considerable point to point variability in the samples due to the expected variability of the natural feedstock. The functional groups analysis of the char was carried out using an Agilent Cary 630 FT-IR Spectrometer with scan range from 700 to 4000 cm-1. The elemental analysis and the calorific value (HHV) of the char and condensed fraction (liquid) were carried out using an Elementar Vario MICRO Cube CHN Elemental Analyser and a CAL2K ECO Bomb calorimeter. A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used to measure the pH of the liquid (bio-oil) at atmospheric temperature (20 °C). The water content in the liquid sample was measured using a Karl-Fischer titration (915 KF Ti-Touch), according to the American Society for Testing and Materials standard (ASTM E203-16). FT-IR analysis was carried out to characterize the organic functional groups in the liquid fraction using a ReactIR™ 4000 FT-IR spectrometer, with scan range from 600 to 4000 cm-1. The chemical compositions of the liquid samples were identified and quantified using a 7200 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF GC/MS and gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID) equipped with a 60 m × 250 μm x 0.25 μm capillary column (14%-cyanopropyl-phenly-methylpolysiloxane, Restek Rtx-1707) with helium as carrier gas. Non-condensable gas was analysed using a Varian 450-GC gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with 5 columns and 3 detectors (1 TCD and 2 FID) with argon as carrier gas. A Molecular sieve ultimate 13× column (1.5 m × 1/8″ × 2.0 mm) was used to detect the permanent gases (CO2, CO, H2, N2 and CH4). A Hayesep T and Q ultimetal column (0.5 m × 1/8″ × 2.0 mm) was used to detect CO2, C2s (acetylene, ethylene and ethane) and hydrocarbon gases. A CP-SIL 5CB capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.4 μm) was used with a FID to determine hydrocarbons. A CP-WAX 52CB capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm × 1.2 μm) equipped with another FID was used to detect light oxygenated compounds."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of pyrolysis temperature on product yields and properties,"3.1 Effect of pyrolysis temperature on product yields and properties Table 2 shows that operating temperatures of 600–700 °C had little effect on product yields. A further increase in temperature to 700–800 °C resulted in a 23% increase in gas yield mainly at the expense of the liquid. This is because the devolatilization of the feedstock almost ceased at temperatures above 700 °C and volatiles were deeply cracked at high temperatures to form gases. This was evidenced by the amount of fixed carbon and the char carbon content remaining constant at 93–94 wt% and 87 wt% as shown in Table 3 . Although there is a small amount of volatiles (around 3–4 wt%) present in the char, they could be tightly bonded or locked in stable structures and could not be released at the tested operating conditions. The carrier gas flow rate in the range of 30–120 ml/min (volatiles residence time around 1–3 s) had little effect on the product yields (Table 2). This could be because the residence time was insufficient to promote significant cracking of the volatiles. A small increase in the extent of cracking (around 4%) has been reported by others at lower temperatures, i.e. 550 °C [13,17,19,23,28]. As observed in Fig. 3 , hydroxyl groups (OH) at ∼3300 cm-1 and the aliphatic C–H stretching vibration at ∼2900 cm-1 in the raw material (Fig. 3a) disappeared at temperatures, i.e. 600 °C (Fig. 3b), whereas other functional groups, i.e. CO (stretching vibration at ∼1700 cm-1), aromatic C–C/CC (vibration at ∼1600 cm-1), C–O (stretching (peak at ∼1100 cm-1) and the aromatic C–H (stretching vibration between 700 cm-1 and 900 cm-1), decreased their intensities with increasing pyrolysis temperatures and completely disappeared at temperatures above 700 °C (Fig. 3c–e). The results obtained from this study (Fig. 3) agree very well with other findings [29–33], where functional groups on the char surface started to decrease at pyrolysis temperatures above 550 °C. Removal of functional groups at high temperatures provides char with high stability and degree of condensation on the char [34–38]. The experimental results (Table 3) showed that the energy content of the feedstock was mainly stored in the liquid and char. The energy yield (which is defined as calorific value of product*product yield/calorific value of raw material*mass of feedstock) was around 39–46% in char and 42–47% in liquid over the tested range of temperatures. Fig. 4 shows the change in the char morphology with temperature. At a fixed particle size of 1 cm3, increasing temperature accelerated the rate of decomposition [39–41], resulting in the formation of small pores on the surface of the char (where volatiles are released) from the smooth solid cells in the raw material (Fig. 4a). The specific surface area of char increased from 38.6 m2/g at 600 °C to 98.4 m2/g at 900 °C (Table 3). A significant increase in the total pore volume from 21.7 × 10-3 cm3/g to 52.1 × 10-3 cm3/g and micropore (2–30 nm) volume from 13.1 × 10-3 cm3/g to 34.4 × 10-3 cm3/g was observed when increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 900 °C. The average pore diameter of the char surface was found to be in the range of 7–12 μm, suggesting a sufficient pore size to accommodate the volatiles from biomass, i.e. oxygenated compounds, heterocyclic aromatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (<2 μm) [42–44]. High total pore and micropore volumes will promote the mass transfer between gas and char particles, accelerating the heterogeneous solid-gas reactions, thereby reducing unburnt carbon in the ash residues [45,46]. Table 3 shows the CO2 concentration gradually decreased from 32.8 to 15.1 mol%, whereas CO formation increased from 38.5 to 47.6 mol% when increasing pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 900 °C. This is because when CO2 was released from inner layers of a particles it can react with a hot char layer via a Boudouard reaction ( C + CO 2 → 2 CO ), which is dominant at temperatures above 700 °C, leading to the formation of CO [47]. Moreover, CO2 could also react with other hydrocarbons (C1–C5) via a dry reforming reaction ( C x H y + xCO 2 ↔ 2 xCO + ( y 2 ) H 2 ) to form H2 and CO at temperatures above 640 o C [47,48]. Although, the H2/CO ratio increased when increasing temperature, i.e. from 0.3 at 600 °C to 0.5 at 900 °C due to an increase in H2 and CO (Table 3), it is still much lower than the required ratio for syngas applications, i.e. chemical production and transportation fuel (H2/CO > 1) [49–51]. The liquid product was highly acidic with pH of 2.3–2.4 containing a large amount of water (around 44 wt% (based on liquid fraction) or 22 wt% based on biomass feedstock (Table 3)). This causes the corrosion of installations and difficulties in ignition due to low calorific value, thereby reducing the local combustion temperature. The liquid product had much higher H/C and O/C ratios (H/C∼2.0 and O/C∼0.8) than heavy fossil-based oil (H/C∼1.5 and almost zero oxygen) [52,53]. If all water is removed, the liquid product would have a H/C in a range of 1.3–1.4 and O/C of 0.4–0.5, which is still higher than the required ratios for transport fuel applications. In addition, the liquid derived from pyrolysis is chemically unstable due to more than 300 chemical compounds, oxygen-containing compounds in particular (i.e. hydroxyacetaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, acetol, phenol and derivatives, levoglucosan and anhydrosugars) [54–56] that are present in the liquid product. As shown in Table 4 full decomposition of unstable compounds (i.e. sugars and their derivatives) was observed at pyrolysis temperatures above 700 °C, while the concentration of other compounds derived from decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose, i.e. acids, ketones, aldehydes and furans, gradually decreased with increasing temperature. However, phenol and its derivatives increased with temperature due to Diels-Alder reactions which are favoured at high temperatures [57]. At all tested temperatures the liquid consisted mainly of furan and its derivatives and phenolic compounds (around 60% (Table 4)). This indicates that high temperature alone cannot decompose aromatics into gaseous products."
7,Effect of particle size on product yields and properties,"3.2 Effect of particle size on product yields and properties Decreasing particle size from 2 cm3 to 0.5 cm3 had a significant effect on the char and gas yields, i.e. an approximately 31% decrease in the char yield and 29% increase in the gas yield (Table 5 ). This is due to heat transfer limitation in larger particles, causing higher temperature gradients inside the particles. It took around 46 min for the middle of 0.5 cm3 particle to reach the set temperature of 900 °C but 52 min for 1 cm3 and up to 62 min for 2 cm3. The outer char layer could act as a hard shell hindering the release of volatiles [58,59], resulting in increasing char yield from 19.8 wt% for 0.5 cm3 to 28.7 wt% for 2 cm3) and the volatile content remaining in char (6.5 wt% for 2 cm3 but only 2.3 wt% for 0.5 cm3) as shown in Table 5. Thus, understanding the temperature profile of single particles could help in designing a gasifier that provides sufficient time for decomposition of fuels. Although, there was little variation in C, H, O content (Table 5), the specific surface area of the char was significantly enhanced up to 124.5 m2/g at 0.5 cm3 compared to 73.0 m2/g at 2 cm3. The small variation in the repeated measurements (5%) was because different char samples derived from different waste wood feedstock pieces were chosen when determining specific surface area. As shown in Fig. 5 , the presence of cracking and development of the pore structure (micropores and macropores) was observed for the small particle size due to the rapid release of volatiles. Decreasing particle size from 2 cm3 to 0.5 cm3 led to increases in the total pore volume from 39.1 × 10-3 cm3/g to 66.3 × 10-3 cm3/g and the micropore volume from 23.1 × 10-3 cm3/g to 42.9 × 10-3 cm3/g. Due to the significant difference in temperature observed for large particles, an increase of CO2 from 11.0 to 20.5 mol% and light hydrocarbon (C2–C5) from 0.8 to 3.8 mol% was observed, whereas other gas concentrations gradually decreased with increasing particle size from 0.5 cm3 to 2 cm3. As shown in Table 5, reducing particle size to 0.5 cm3 had little effect on the ratio of H2/CO (around 0.5). As illustrated in Table 5, increasing particle size slightly decreased the carbon content in the liquid (from 46.4 wt% for 0.5 cm3 to 41.5 wt% for 2 cm3) but the water content in liquid fraction increased slightly (around 6%). This could be due to the rapid release of volatile matter, minimising secondary reactions (i.e. dehydration) when small particles are used [13,14,60,61]. The calorific values (HHV) of the liquid decreased from 18.0 MJ/kg at 0.5 cm3 to 14.9 MJ/kg at 2 cm3. Phenol and its derivatives decreased from 18.6 wt% at 0.5 cm3 to 13.7 wt% at 2 cm3 (Table 6 ). This could be due to an incomplete decomposition of lignin in the feedstock [56,57,62]. However, the concentration of other compounds gradually increased with increasing particle size as shown in Table 6."
8,The effect of pyrolysis conditions on gasification process,"3.3 The effect of pyrolysis conditions on gasification process Pyrolysis products obtained from three different pyrolysis temperatures (i.e. 600, 800 and 900 °C) at a fixed particle size of 1 cm3 and nitrogen flow rate of 120 ml/min were used to examine the effect of pyrolysis on the syngas quality and tar formation in two-stage gasification. Gasification was fixed at a temperature of 1000 °C and a steam to carbon in biomass (S/C) molar ratio of 5.7. Table 7 shows that the tar concentration in the gas stream significantly decreased from 42.9 g/Nm3 (products derived at 600 °C pyrolysis) to 21.2 g/Nm3 (products derived at 900 °C pyrolysis), corresponding to approximately 50.6% tar removal. This could be because the high specific surface area and pore volume of the char derived at high pyrolysis temperature (Table 3) promotes cracking/reforming of tars [63–66]. Moreover, the high porosity of char also enhances access of the gasifying agent (O2, CO2 or steam) to form H2 and CO via the heterogeneous solid-gas reactions occurs in the gasification process, i.e. the Boudouard reaction ( C + CO 2 → 2 CO ) and the water gas reaction ( C + H 2 O → 2 CO + H 2 ) [67–69]. The H2 and CO in the syngas increased from 48.8 to 67.2 mol% and 4.5–8.8 mol% with the products derived at pyrolysis temperature of 600 and 900 °C respectively (Table 7). Increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 900 °C alters the gas yield (from 77.8 to 95.8 wt%) at the expense of solid residues (ash) (from 16.3 to 0.4 wt%) and unburnt carbon in the ash residues (<0.01 wt%) at a fixed gasification temperature of 1000 °C and a steam to carbon in biomass (S/C) molar ratio of 5.7 (Table 7). Moreover, an enhancement in the gas properties (higher CO concentration in the gas stream), which results in an increased pyrolysis temperature (Table 3), promotes a significant reaction, i.e. water gas shift reaction ( CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 ) , which occurs in the gasification step leading to the formation of H2 in the gas stream. Parameters affecting the pyrolysis process and the gas properties derived from gasification in this study can be applied for other high-volatile containing feedstock (75–85%). The initial waste wood composition (C, H, N, O) was found to have little influence on products derived from pyrolysis process [70–72]. However, the amount of steam required for the gasification process should be adjusted according to the initial carbon content in the feedstock to maintain the optimum ratio. Ash in lignocellulosic materials contains mainly alkaline and other metals (Na, K, Si, Ca, Mg etc.) and remains as a solid residue. These metals could act as catalysts for reforming/cracking of high molecular weight compounds in both pyrolysis and gasification processes [64,65], promoting less tar formation. However, these inorganic species could cause a number of challenges such as fouling, erosion and corrosion of installations as well as slagging and agglomeration when the gasification temperature is above 1200 °C (melting point). The process developed in this study is carried out at a temperature range of 1000–1100 °C, which only just enough to transfer these metals into stable forms, i.e. NaO, Al2O3, P2O5, K2O, K2CO3, KCl, SiO2, Fe2O3, CaCO3, CaO and MgO [73,74]."
9,Conclusions,"The effects of pyrolysis temperature (600–900 °C), nitrogen flow rate (30 and 120 ml/min corresponding to volatile residence time (1–3 s) and particle size (0.5, 1 and 2 cm3) on the product yields and properties of pyrolysis of waste wood were investigated. Decreasing the particle size of the feedstock increased the specific surface area and total pore volume of the char from 73.0 m2/g and 39.1 × 10-3 cm3/g at 2 cm3 to 124.5 m2/g and 66.3 × 10-3 cm3/g at 0.5 cm3. There were strong interactions between pyrolysis operating conditions and the gasification step. Temperature in the pyrolysis process strongly altered the char morphology (around 2–3 time increase in surface areas, total pore and micropore volumes) and composition of the volatile products, which in turn had a strong influence on the syngas properties, i.e. tar, carbon in ash (residues) and hydrogen content in gasification. Increasing pyrolysis temperature increased hydrogen content whilst decreasing hydrocarbons, CO2 and tar content in the gas stream. Pyrolysis temperatures above 700 °C promoted the formation of phenolic compounds that would be precursors of multiple aromatic ring species in the gas products in gasification. Nonetheless, only decreasing size to 0.5 cm3 and applying high temperature in pyrolysis would not be sufficient to produce high H2/CO ratio (only 0.4–0.5). Our findings show that at a pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C, a particle size of 0.5–1 cm3 and at a controlled steam to carbon in biomass (S/C) molar ratio, i.e. 5.7, the H2 content in gasification products increased up to 67 mol% from around 49% whereas the aromatic compounds decreased by up to 50.6%. The carbon content in ash (residues) from gasification was less than 0.01 wt%."
