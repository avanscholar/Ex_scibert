0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production is considered a promising opportunity for sustainable energy generation from renewable sources. It can be achieved through photosynthetic and fermentative processes. Comparatively, dark fermentation may be more advantageous for producing hydrogen because it features higher production rates, economic viability, and the possibility of using several organic substances as substrates [1–3]. Additionally, there is the possibility of using mixed microbial cultures for anaerobic decomposition, in addition to low-cost wastewaters as substrates, which makes this alternative rather attractive [4,5]. Among the different residues that can be used as raw material, cheese whey is a potential substrate for hydrogen production because it is an agroindustrial byproduct rich in carbohydrates that is constituted mainly of lactose (approximately 70%), proteins and lipids [6,7]. Consequently, usage of this compound associates bioenergy production with the treatment of this waste stream. There are several possible reactor configurations that can be used for fermentative hydrogen production. Among them, fixed-bed reactors are advantageous because they allow operations with shorter hydraulic retention times than reactors without immobilization, owing to more significant biomass retention inside the reactor. However, instability in hydrogen production has been reported in recent studies using acidogenic packed-bed reactors (APBRs) [8,9]. This fact has been mainly attributed to excessive biomass accumulation and to long cell retention times [5,8]. The anaerobic structured-bed reactor (ASTBR) is a variation of the conventional APBR configuration. In this novel configuration, the support material is ordered to allow biomass attachment, but with a much higher bed porosity, which diminishes the excessive accumulation of biomass in the bed interstices, reducing bed clogging problems and consequently favoring hydrogen production [10–12]. Despite the advantages of dark fermentation for hydrogen production, serious challenges must be overcome to make this process a practical reality. The hydrogen production performance observed in experiments with undefined mixed microbial cultures and complex wastewaters as feedstocks is often significantly inferior than that expected theoretically. The main barrier may reside in the limitations of the metabolic processes, such as low efficiencies in the conversion of substrates and the formation of soluble metabolites that consume hydrogen, such as acids and alcohols, which are often observed [1,13,14]. Therefore, there is a need to conduct more research focused on increasing the energy recovery from the fermentative substrates [14] through steering the metabolic pathways occurring in dark fermentative reactors. Hydrogen production by undefined mixed microbial cultures is dependent on the establishment of complex interspecies metabolic interactions. An imbalance between the producing and consuming populations is necessary to obtain an accumulation of hydrogen and organic acids inside the reactor. Efforts have been made to improve acid production with hydrogen liberation through the system's operational control, managing the type of inoculum [15], hydraulic retention time (HRT) [16], bed porosity [17,18], organic loading rate (OLR) [19], nutritional conditions [20], temperature [21], and pH [22], among other parameters. Mathematical modeling tools can facilitate the integration and interpretation of experimental data, therefore providing a more in-depth understanding of complex and dynamic systems such as microbial communities. Mathematical models provide descriptions of relevant processes, such as biomass growth, substrate consumption and product formation, in addition to considering the effects of physicochemical parameters, such as pH, temperature and gas–liquid transfer rates [23]. Therefore, information obtained through modeling may allow the determination of more favorable operational conditions to obtain higher hydrogen production performance [24,25]. Different approaches to model dark fermentation hydrogen production have been attempted, among which the modified Gompertz equation and adaptations of the anaerobic digestion model n° 1 (ADM1) can be highlighted [24,26]. The ADM1 framework is fairly comprehensive and has been successfully adapted to describe fermentative hydrogen production [25,27]. In the present study, an acidogenic ASTBR was evaluated for dark fermentative biohydrogen production from cheese whey wastewater. The mixed microbial culture selected in the continuous reactor was further investigated in batch experiments. An ADM1-based, unstructured kinetic model was developed and fitted to the experimental results, providing insight into the main metabolic pathways involved in hydrogen production at the community level."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthetic wastewater,"2.1 Synthetic wastewater All experiments were performed with a synthetic wastewater composed by reconstituted cheese whey powder (CWP). Dehydrated CWP was purchased from Barbosa & Marques S.A (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The composition of the CWP was as follows (w/w): carbohydrates (76.5%), proteins (13.3%), lipids (1.0%), sodium (1.1%), other minerals (7.6%). The CWP was reconstituted to yield variable chemical oxygen demand (COD) values according to the required OLR. The wastewater was supplemented with 0.5 g NaHCO3 g COD−1 as a pH buffering agent. A detailed characterization of the inorganic constituents of the synthetic wastewater is presented in Table SM-1."
3,Continuous flow experiments,"2.2 Continuous flow experiments A bench-scale ASTBR was used for the continuous biohydrogen production experiments. The reactor design is detailed in Ref. [28]. The reactor was filled with low-density polyethylene cylinders as support material for biomass attachment. The cylinders were orderly placed along 5 steel rods distributed equidistantly within the reactor, resulting in a bed porosity (ε) of 85% and a working volume of 1.63 L. The ASTBR was operated in upflow mode at a controlled temperature of 25 °C, with a constant OLR of 24 kg COD m−3 d−1 and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h. The ASTBR was inoculated according to the procedure described by Leite et al. [29]. A total of 20 L of the synthetic wastewater was exposed to ambient conditions until natural fermentation occurred after 3 days. The fermented solution was then recycled into the reactor for 5 days to promote biomass attachment."
4,Batch experiments,"2.3 Batch experiments Batch experiments were performed in 5-L reactors (Duran® flasks) with a 2-L working volume. Synthetic wastewater was used as substrate, with an initial COD of 24 g L−1. Biomass from the ASTBR treating CWP wastewater was used as inoculum, in a proportion of 213 g COD g VSS−1, according to the recommendations of Vieira et al. [30]. The flasks were flushed with nitrogen gas for 15 min to establish anaerobic conditions and then placed in an orbital shaker at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 304 h. The experiments were performed in triplicates. The composition of the gas and liquid phases were measured at determined time intervals and the headspace pressure was relieved after sampling."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The continuous and batch reactors were monitored via analysis of soluble COD, pH, carbohydrates, total and volatile suspended solids (TSS and VSS, respectively), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and solvents. For the analyses of COD and total carbohydrates, the samples were filtered with 1.2 μm membranes. For VFA and solvents the samples were filtered with 0.22 μm membranes. The values for the pH, COD, TSS and VSS were determined according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [31]. Carbohydrate concentrations were determined using the method described by Dubois et al. [32]. The volume of biogas produced in ASTBR was measured using a flow meter (Ritter model MilligasCounter). The composition of biogas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) was determined via gas chromatography (GC-2021, Shimadzu) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a CARBOXEN 1010 Plot (30 m, 0.53 mm) column with argon as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector and detector were maintained at 220 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The column temperature had an initial temperature of 130 °C and was heated at a rate of 46 °C min−1 until it reached 135 °C [15]. All gas volumes are reported under standard conditions (0 °C, 1 atm). The concentration of VFA and alcohols were determined with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Shimadzu) equipped with a pump (LC-10ADVP), auto sampler (SIL-20A HT), column oven (CTO-20A) at 43 °C, UV-diode array detector (SDP-M10 AVP), refraction index detector (RID-10A), system controller (SCL-10AVP) and an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm, 7.8 mm, BioRad). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.005 mol L−1) at 0.5 mL min−1. The following response variables were used to evaluate the performance of the system [33]: lactose conversion efficiency (CElactose, in %), biogas flow rate (BFR, in mL h−1), volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR, in L H2 L−1 d−1 for the ASTBR and mL H2 L−1 h−1 for the batch experiments), molar hydrogen flow rate (MHFR, in mmol H2 h−1), and hydrogen yield (HY, in mol H2 mol lactose−1). In the batch experiments, the potential hydrogen production (PHP) was also defined as a variable to analyze the system performance. The PHP (L H2 L−1) was obtained from the maximal volume of hydrogen produced normalized by the reactor volume."
6,Kinetic model development,"2.5 Kinetic model development An unstructured kinetic model based on the ADM1 approach was developed and fitted to the experimental data to investigate the temporal profiles of the metabolites produced and consumed during the mixed-culture fermentation of cheese whey. The model was designed to describe a homogeneous compartment of constant volume without mass transfer limitations. The model equations were obtained from mass balances applied to a completely-stirred batch reactor. The model follows the conceptual layout presented in Fig. 1 . The considered biochemical processes are carbohydrate fermentation leading to the formation of biomass, acetate, lactate and hydrogen gas and the simultaneous consumption of lactate and acetate leading to the formation of butyrate and hydrogen gas. The choice of the reactions represented in the model stemmed directly from the experimental results. The state variables are carbohydrates (C) and the main fermentation products observed in the experiments: biomass (X), lactate (L), acetate (A), butyrate (B) and hydrogen gas (H). All state variables are expressed in terms of g of COD per liter of reaction volume. The biomass was quantified as VSS and was assumed to follow the chemical formula C5H7NO2 [34], which corresponds to a COD content of 1.42 g COD g VSS−1. The carbohydrate concentration was experimentally determined and converted in terms of COD by considering that lactose is the only carbohydrate present in cheese whey. The carbohydrate consumption rate was considered to follow Monod-type kinetics and can be described by Equation (1). (1) d C d t = − X · I · k C · C C + K S C in which kC is the maximum carbohydrate consumption rate (g COD g COD−1 h−1), KSC is the half-saturation constant for carbohydrate consumption (g COD h−1), and I is an empirical function to model low-pH inhibition [35], as described in Equation (2). (2) I = e − 3 · p H − p H U L p H U L − p H L L 2 , i f p H < p H U L 1 , i f p H > p H U L in which pHUL is the upper limit for pH inhibition, above which microorganisms are not inhibited, and pHLL is the lower limit for pH inhibition, at which the microorganisms are completely inhibited. This function was considered in all the biochemical processes present in the proposed model. In a general sense, it is expected that this empirical equation can indirectly account for a number of adverse effects of pH reduction on microbial metabolism, such as the increase in the concentration of undissociated organic acids and partial enzyme denaturation. A sixth order polynomial function was fitted to the experimentally measured pH profile. The I function was evaluated at each time interval using the fitted pH values. As an unstructured modeling approach was used, microbial diversity was not considered in the model. Instead, the VSS content of the batch reactor was assumed to represent the entirety of the microbial consortium, capable of conducting all of the metabolic pathways proposed in the model. Biomass growth was assumed to be associated with carbohydrate uptake only. This assumption is in agreement with our experimental observations and has been previously made in similar modeling efforts [27]. The rate of biomass decay was assumed to have a first-order dependence on the biomass concentration, as usually assumed in anaerobic digestion models [35]. Thus, the net biomass growth can be expressed by Equation (3). (3) d X d t = − Y · d C d t − k d · X in which Y is the biomass yield on carbohydrates (g COD g COD−1) and kd is the first-order biomass decay coefficient (h−1). The production rate of hydrogen and butyrate from lactate and acetate was assumed to follow a Monod-type dependence on the concentration of lactate only, according to Diez-Gonzalez et al. [36], who suggested that acetate was not the limiting substrate in that reaction. The formation of all fermentation end products was modeled following the constant stoichiometry approach of ADM1. In this manner, the reaction rates of lactate (L), acetate (A), butyrate (B) and hydrogen gas (H) are described by Equations (4)–(7), respectively. (4) d L d t = − 1 − Y · f C − L d C d t − X · I · k L · L L + K S L (5) d A d t = − 1 − Y · f C − A d C d t − f L − A · X · I · k L · L L + K S L (6) d B d t = f L − B · X · I · k L · L L + K S L (7) d H d t = − 1 − Y · f C − H d C d t + f L − H · X · I · k L · L L + K S L in which fi-j are the stoichiometric coefficients of the fermentation product j associated with the consumption of i, kL is the maximum lactate uptake rate (g COD g COD−1 h−1), and KSL is the half-saturation constant for lactate uptake (g COD h−1). To ensure that the conservation of electrons was correctly maintained, COD balances were made for the reaction of consumption of carbohydrates (Equation (8)) and for the lactate cross-feeding reaction (Equation (9)). The mathematical relationships obtained reduced the number of coefficients to be determined in the model. (8) 1 − Y − 1 − Y · f C − L − 1 − Y · f C − A − 1 − Y · f C − H = 0 (9) 1 + f L − A − f L − B − f L − H = 0 The model differential equations were numerically integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method implemented in MS Excel. The biomass yield and decay coefficients and the pH inhibition limits, pHUL and pHLL, were taken to be 0.17 g COD gCOD−1, 0.02 d−1, 5.5 and 4, respectively, as recommended ADM1 parameters for carbohydrate acidogenesis [35]. These values were adopted in an attempt to minimize the number of kinetic parameters to be estimated. Moreover, these parameters are expected to exhibit low variability [35] and thus are expected to reasonably represent the reactor behavior. The remaining kinetic parameters and stoichiometric coefficients were estimated through curve fitting using a non-linear least-squares method. The MS Excel Solver tool was used to obtain the set of model parameters that minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between the measured and simulated values in the temporal profiles of all the state variables simultaneously."
7,Results,
8,ASTBR performance evaluation,"3.1 ASTBR performance evaluation The ASTBR was operated for 32 days. The maximum performance in terms of hydrogen production was achieved after 24 days of operation, corresponding to a peak yield of 2.4 moL H2 mol−1 of consumed lactose. The hydrogen production then gradually decreased, resulting in an average yield of 1.4 moL H2 mol−1 of consumed lactose over the entire operational period. At the end of the operation, the mixed microbial culture retained in the ASTBR, corresponding to a biomass concentration of 17.7 ± 0.8 g SSV L−1, was collected and used as inoculum for the batch experiments. The average performance data in terms of H2 production (BFR, VHPR, MHFR and HY) and substrate conversion (CElactose and pH) are compiled in Table 1 . In general, the obtained results were superior to previous attempts of biohydrogen production from cheese whey in conventional APBR reactors. Perna et al. [7] operated an APBR with an OLR of 22 ± 3 g COD L−1 d−1, pH of 5.7 ± 0.5 and temperature of 30 °C and obtained an HY of 0.20 ± 0.08 moL H2 mol−1 lactose and a VHPR of 0.2 L H2 L−1 d−1. Fernandez et al. [19], adopting similar operational conditions in an APBR (pH between 4.5 and 5.5, OLR of 18.8 g COD L−1 d−1 and temperature of 35 °C), obtained an HY of 0.5 moL H2 mol−1 lactose. Using an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor (ABFSB) and lactose-rich effluent, Carrillo-Reyes et al. [5] obtained results similar to the ones observed in the present study: HY of 2.14 moL H2 mol−1 lactose, for an OLR of 20 g COD L−1 d−1, pH 5.5 and temperature of 37 °C. Carrillo-Reyes et al. [37], using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor under mesophilic conditions, an OLR of 20 g COD L−1 d−1 and a pH of 5.9, adopted the strategy of gradually decreasing the HRT from 24 to 6 h and reached the highest production of 2.41 L H2 L−1 d−1 during the first 20 days of operation. However, the production remained stable only during the period from the 51st to the 84th day of operation, with an average production rate of 0.27 ± 0.1 L H2 L−1 d−1 and a constant HRT of 6 h. Hydrogen production instability is a frequent limitation in fermentative, mesophilic, fixed-bed reactors. Often, after achieving a peak in hydrogen production, the reactor performance tends to decrease gradually, and sometimes the hydrogen generation can cease completely. This is generally attributed to a gradual change in microbial community composition [8,10,15,17,38]. Although the present results were obtained during a short-term operation, thus preventing a stability evaluation, the ASTBR was shown to be a potential alternative for hydrogen production from CWP. The support material configuration in the ASTBR allows a high bed porosity, which decreases excessive biomass accumulation, which may have contributed to the improved results in terms of hydrogen production when compared to traditional packed-bed reactors. Fernandes et al. [17] and Lee et al. [18] observed that reactors with higher bed porosity (above 90%) enabled the periodic removal of suspended biomass while allowing the growth of adhered biomass, which led to better results in terms of hydrogen production. The main metabolites formed during the ASTBR operation were lactic, acetic and butyric acids, with effluent concentrations of 7, 5 and 3 g L−1, which corresponded to 33, 21 and 23%, respectively, of the metabolites produced in terms of COD. The batch experiments were then performed to provide further insight into the main metabolic pathways occurring in the reactor at the community level and to support the identification of performance improvement opportunities."
9,Batch experiments,"3.2 Batch experiments The biomass extracted from the ASTBR was used as inoculum in batch experiments. The degradation of the CWP wastewater was monitored by following the temporal profiles of total carbohydrates, H2, organic acids, pH and biomass concentration. The obtained time courses are presented in Fig. 2 . The carbohydrates were quickly consumed during the assay and 93% of the initial concentration was converted after 38.5 h of reaction. Lactic and acetic acids were the main metabolites produced, reaching peak concentrations of 12.2 g L−1 and 4.2 g L−1, respectively. Negligible concentrations of other volatile fatty acids were detected in this period. Ethanol or other solvents were not produced during the batch assay. Biomass concentration steadily increased with carbohydrate consumption until 38.5 h of reaction. Subsequently, a mild decrease was observed until the end of the experiment. The observed biomass profile was similar to those presented by Leh and Charles [39] and Cachon and Divies [40] during batch lactate fermentation of cheese whey and synthetic medium, respectively. Only a fraction of the produced hydrogen was associated to the consumption of carbohydrates. Although almost all carbohydrates had been converted by 38.5 h of reaction, the hydrogen produced in this period accounted only for 25.5% of the total produced volume. A plateau in hydrogen production was observed between approximately 38 and 85 h, dividing the hydrogen production in two stages. After this period, an increase in H2 production was observed, along with butyric acid production and a decrease in lactic and acetic acid concentrations. The hydrogen volume obtained directly from lactose in the first 38.5 h of reaction was 1.02 L, whereas the hydrogen volume produced in the second stage, generated from metabolites of the lactose fermentation, was 2.98 L. The temporal profiles of the measured organic acids show that the hydrogen production in the second stage was associated with the simultaneous consumption of acetate and lactate, as well as with the generation of butyric acid. Those observations suggest the occurrence of a carbohydrate-independent, hydrogen production pathway described by Equation (10) [41]. (10) 4 C H 3 CHOHCOOH + 2 C H 3 COOH → 3 C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 COOH + 2 H 2 + 4 C O 2 The occurrence of this reaction implies in the establishment of a trophic interaction between lactate-producing bacteria (LAB) and H2-producing microorganisms capable of fermenting lactate and acetate. This interspecies metabolite exchange, also referred as lactate cross-feeding, has been shown to occur in human colonic microbiota [42,43] and has been postulated to occur in fermentative bioreactors [44]. The consumption of lactic acid associated with the production of butyric acid and H2 was observed in H2-producing bioreactors by Matsumoto and Nishimura [45] during fermentation of sweet potato post-distillation slurry, by Baghchehsaraee et al. [46] during starch fermentation, and by Chojnacka et al. [47] during fermentation of molasses. During cheese whey fermentation, increased H2 yields associated with butyrate formation were observed by Yang et al. [48], Castelló et al. [49] and Perna et al. [7]. The VHPR observed in the batch experiments when both phases of hydrogen production are considered, 6.9 mL H2 L−1 h−1, was inferior to those reported in similar studies with cheese whey as a substrate. Davila-Vazquez et al. [4] obtained a VHPR of 19.6 mL H2 L−1 h−1, with an initial CWP concentration of 25 g L−1, initial pH of 7.5, 37 °C and a mixed anaerobic culture. Romão et al. [50] evaluated hydrogen production under similar conditions and obtained results of a similar order of magnitude to Davila-Vazquez et al. [4]: VHPR of 16.92 mL H2 L−1 h−1, with an initial lactose concentration of 20 g L−1, initial pH of 7 and a mixed anaerobic culture. Ferchichi et al. [51] also studied hydrogen production from cheese whey by pure cultures of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum with an initial lactose concentration of 41.4 g L−1, initial pH of 7, 30 °C and obtained a VHPR of 29.32 mL H2 L−1 h−1. The PHP calculated for the batch experiments was 2.0 L H2 L−1, which is also inferior than those observed in the studies mentioned previously, in which the PHP values remained between 3.8 and 5.2 L H2 L−1 [4,50,51]. The production of lactate from carbohydrates in H2-producing bioreactors constitutes an obvious drawback from the standpoint of H2 yield because lactate production usually consumes reducing power and does not result in H2 formation. Although undesired, the presence of LAB is commonly observed in mesophilic H2-producing reactors treating cheese whey [19,38,49]. The expressive lactate production observed in the batch reactor can be attributed to the use of the sludge from the acidogenic ASTBR treating CWP as the inoculum. Although a microbiological analysis was not conducted to characterize that inoculum, it is reasonable to presume the presence of LAB, as lactate accounted for approximately 33% of the reactor's effluent COD."
10,Kinetic modeling,"3.3 Kinetic modeling The developed kinetic model was fitted to the temporal profiles of total carbohydrates, lactate, acetate, butyrate, biomass and hydrogen gas. The obtained curves are presented in Fig. 3 . A satisfactory agreement between the measured and simulated values was obtained, as indicated by the calculated modified index of agreement (d1), which is a quality-of-fit statistic based on the sum of the absolute values of the deviations [52]. The obtained values were 0.8607 for carbohydrates, 0.7871 for lactate, 0.6674 for acetate, 0.8017 for butyrate, 0.5441 for biomass concentration and 0.8592 for hydrogen gas. The adequate description of the experimental data for the six state variables suggests that despite being an undefined mixed-culture fermentation of a complex substrate, lactate and acetate consumption leading to the production of butyrate and hydrogen appears to be a prevalent transformation pathway at the community level in the batch reactors. The kinetic model presented an inferior fit to the biomass concentration profile compared with the other state variables. The maximum biomass production was underestimated by the kinetic model, which can be attributed to the use of literature values for the biomass growth parameters, in addition to the presence of other growth-related substrates not accounted for in the model. Nevertheless, the overall reasonable fit observed indicates that the strategy employed for the reduction of parameters to be determined was suitable. In a general sense, the biomass yield and decay coefficients exhibit low variability [35], which makes them good candidates to be estimated from the literature without significant loss of model accuracy. The model's predictions could be further improved by the addition of experimentally measured biomass growth parameters. The kinetic model overestimates the production of butyrate and hydrogen, markedly before 75 h of reaction, when virtually no butyrate concentration was measured in the reactor. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that the model considers that the production of butyrate and hydrogen is initiated as soon as there is available acetate and lactate in the reaction medium, which results in a predicted butyrate presence in the reaction medium from the beginning of the experiment. However, an analysis of the soluble end products profiles indicates that butyrate formation does not start until all carbohydrate is depleted. This is possibly because the bacterial strains that are able to utilize lactate and acetate for the production of butyrate and hydrogen are generally also able to ferment carbohydrates [44], presumably with greater energetic yield. This ability was observed for strains of Clostridium acetobutylicum [36], Clostridium diolis [45], Clostridium tyrobutyricum [53] and Butyribacterium methylotrophicum [54]. The model was not able to predict the production of lactate and acetate observed between 50 and 74 h after the start of the reaction, when little change in carbohydrate concentration was observed. The formation of these organic acids during this period can be attributed to the fermentation of other substrates present in cheese whey not accounted for in the model. Although lactose is recognized as the main constituent of cheese whey, lipids, proteins and other fermentable substrates are also expected to be present. For the CWP used in this experiment, non-carbohydrate, organic substrates account for 14.3% of the total mass. The shape of the hydrogen concentration profile obtained in this work was very similar to that presented by Grause et al. [55], which was obtained during production of hydrogen from lactate in batch assays with initial glucose concentrations. The authors reported the occurrence of a short initial H2 production stage along with consumption of the initial carbohydrates, followed by a plateau in biogas generation before a second stage of hydrogen production correlated with the consumption of lactate, acetate and the production of butyrate. The hydrogen plateau observed in the present work correlates with the period in which a sharp decrease in pH occurred, between 38 h and 85 h of reaction, as presented in Fig. 2. During this period, the average reaction pH was 5.0 ± 0.1. This result is expected given the significant lactate production observed. Due to the low pKa of lactate, its production results in a strong effect on pH values, which impacts hydrogen production from clostridial fermentation [56]. However, considerable acetate production from carbohydrates was observed in the experiment. This result could be attributed to fermentation through the bifidum pathway, in which carbohydrate fermentation simultaneously yields lactate and acetate but no hydrogen [57]. The occurrence of a metabolic route in which carbohydrates are fermented directly to acetate, without any hydrogen production, has also been suggested [56]. The observed behavior indicates that the hydrogen production from acetate and lactate is inhibited by the medium pH, which was adequately accounted for in the model by the inhibition function I, even though the upper and lower pH limits for inhibition were taken from the literature. Although numerous studies make use of the empirical pH inhibition functions presented in the ADM1 framework, the adopted upper and lower limits are seldom reported [26,27,56,58,59]. Although the key role of pH on biohydrogen production from dark fermentation is widely recognized [22,60–62], there is no consensus regarding the optimal pH for fermentative systems, especially for the production of hydrogen from lactate and acetate. Matsumoto and Nishimura [45] did not observe any H2 production from lactate and acetate at pH values inferior to 5.1 for pure cultures of Clostridium diolis. Grause et al. [55] did not observe significant H2 production from lactic acid under pH 5, and De Gioannis et al. [22] observed severely limited biohydrogen production from cheese whey at a pH of 5.5. However, the studies of Venetsaneas et al. [62] and Stamatelatou et al. [63] employed a controlled pH of 5.2 for the production of H2 from cheese whey and obtained satisfactory results. These inconsistent outcomes regarding the optimal pH for biohydrogen production during mixed microbial fermentations reveal a knowledge gap in the literature that limits more accurate predictions of bioreactor behavior. The estimated yield coefficients for the kinetic model (Table SM-2) were used to assess the stoichiometric coefficients of the postulated cross-feeding reaction (Equation (10)). The obtained values are presented in Table 2 , in addition to values estimated in previous studies. In a general sense, the stoichiometric coefficients obtained in this study for butyrate and hydrogen production and acetate consumption were slightly inferior to some of those reported in the literature, and to those expected by the stoichiometry if the reaction presented in Equation (10) was the sole transformation route for acetate and lactate. However, the work of Wu et al. [65] showed that there is considerable variation in the stoichiometric coefficients according to the fermentation conditions, as the hydrogen yield, acetate consumption and butyrate formation varied greatly according to the volumetric loading rates applied to a continuous reactor. Lower loading rates lead to fewer electrons distributed towards hydrogen production. This indicates that in mixed-culture fermentation, the flow of electrons is directed to different metabolic routes according to the operational conditions. In the present work, the discrepancy in the coefficients' values also indicate the influence of unaccounted marginal transformation pathways. The fixed-stoichiometry approach used in the developed model does not account for the fact that the composition of the fermentation products may change according to the operating conditions. As an example, alteration of the reaction pH has been shown to significantly shift the metabolic routes and end-product formation during carbohydrate fermentation [66]. In a similar manner, the hydrogen partial pressure and undissociated organic acid concentrations can also influence product formation in biohydrogen fermentation [59,67]. Therefore, it is expected that the developed kinetic model would exhibit a limited predictive power for experiments performed under different conditions. Several authors highlight the importance of shifting from the fixed-stoichiometry approach present in the original ADM1 framework to a variable-stoichiometry approach, so that kinetic models based on the ADM1 can more adequately describe acidogenic systems [56,59,68]. Nevertheless ADM1-based models with fixed stoichiometry can be successfully employed to describe acidogenic reactors [26,27] as long as the modeling objectives are clearly outlined and the assumptions and constraints of the models are carefully considered."
11,Discussion,"In the present study, the developed ADM1-based kinetic model fulfilled its objective of providing insight into the predominant metabolic pathways involved in the mixed-culture fermentation of cheese whey. A satisfactory description of the process was obtained with a model with a minimum number of relevant parameters, despite the intricacies arising from the presence of multiple bacterial species and the use of a complex wastewater. The development of the kinetic model provided a better understanding of the cheese whey fermentation process, suggesting the role of lactate and acetate as hydrogen precursors, as well as revealing the influence of the reaction pH on the system performance. In the batch experiments, little H2 production could be attributed to carbohydrate uptake, and most of the production was associated with butyrate formation. This observation reveals that the electrons from the carbohydrates were directed primarily to lactate and acetate, resulting in a low hydrogen yield. Production of lactic acid from carbohydrates in H2-producing bioreactors is unwanted because lactic acid represents a drain of reducing equivalents that could otherwise be directed towards hydrogen production. Several authors associate the presence of LAB in hydrogen production reactors with poor H2 yields due to either competition for substrate or the excretion of antimicrobial peptides, the bacteriocins [19,69–72]. Utilization of inoculum pre-treatments to avoid the presence of LAB in H2-producing bioreactors treating cheese whey is ineffective because LAB are abundant in this wastewater [63] and are expected to eventually colonize the reactor. Thus, in long-term continuous operations, LAB will presumably be a part of the microbial community in the bioreactor and have been shown to predominate hydrogen-producing bacteria even during periods of high H2 production [7,48]. In this context, the adoption of operational strategies to enhance H2 yield despite the production of lactate may be the most desirable solution for H2 production from cheese whey in continuous, long-term operations. The conversion of lactate to butyrate in the presence of acetate can provide a maximum theoretical yield of 0.5 moL H2 mol lactate−1. This corresponds to a maximum yield of 2 moL H2 mol hexose−1, if the carbohydrates are converted only to lactate and acetate in stoichiometric proportions. This yield, albeit theoretical, is still superior to those reported in the literature for cheese whey fermentation [19,71,72]. Therefore, the adoption of engineering strategies that enable the establishment of a mixed culture capable of utilizing lactate and acetate for hydrogen production in the continuous reactor could enhance its performance. Although the ASTBR reactor used in this study exhibited a considerable hydrogen production performance, optimized operational conditions could improve its performance further. Such a change is possible because appreciable concentrations of lactate and acetate remained in the effluent of the ASTBR, which represents a wasted potential of H2 production. The metabolite profiling performed in the present work allowed for a functional characterization of the undefined mixed microbial culture involved in the production of H2 from cheese whey. Although the metabolic intermediates provide direct evidence of the underlying microbial dynamics, characterization of the microbial consortium would provide valuable insight into the key players involved in the process. Gradual changes in microbial community composition in both the ASTBR and the batch reactors cannot be ruled out in the present work. Future research is warranted to integrate community profiling techniques to the functional analysis strategy conducted in the present study. The use of these complementary approaches would support the advance of the fundamental understanding of biohydrogen production from cheese whey in mixed microbial cultures."
12,Conclusions,"The ASTBR was shown to be a potential alternative for fermentative biohydrogen production from cheese whey, presenting superior performance than conventional packed-bed reactors. A peak hydrogen production yield of 2.4 moL H2 mol−1 lactose consumed was observed, resulting in an average yield of 1.4 ± 0.7 moL H2 mol−1 lactose consumed over a 32-day period. The developed kinetic model provided a satisfactory description of the biohydrogen production process, providing insight into the main transformation pathways leading to hydrogen production. A postulated mechanism of hydrogen production from acetate and lactate could explain 74.5% of the total observed hydrogen production. Additionally, the model indicated that a pH of 5.0 is limiting for hydrogen production through this mechanism. As LAB are abundant in cheese whey wastewater, strategies to eliminate LAB in mixed microbial culture fermentations are expected to be largely ineffective. In this context, promoting the necessary conditions for the establishment of bacterial communities capable of producing hydrogen from lactate and acetate may be a suitable strategy to enable long-term hydrogen production from cheese whey in continuous systems."
