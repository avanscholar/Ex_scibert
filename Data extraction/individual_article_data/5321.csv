0,Introduction,"Cost-effective and user-friendly energy production has emerged as one of the major global challenges over the past few decades with an exponential growth of the modern human society [1]. Currently, the industrial energy sector is mostly driven by the fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. However, the excessive usage of these carbon-based energy resources has imparted grave anthropogenic effects on the climate [2]. Thus, the search for an inexpensive and viable alternative energy resource has become the need of the hour to resolve this serious energy crisis [3]. Solar energy is considered as one of the leading candidates in this pursuit of a green renewable energy source. Theoretically, the sunlight hitting on the earth every hour has sufficient energy to satisfy the global energy consumption for the entire year [4]. Despite all the advantages, the intermittent nature and the lack of an efficient procedure for storing the solar energy have interrupted their long-term usage [5]. The natural photosynthesis-inspired technologies have been evolved in recent years for the efficient transformation of sunlight into chemical energy [6]. Hydrogen molecule (H2) is widely regarded as one of the best energy vectors for this purpose due to its high energy density [7]. Here, the reversible conversion between protons/electrons and hydrogen molecule holds the key during this energy transduction process 2H+ + 2e-⇋ H2(Eq. 1 ). The H2 molecule can be directly utilized for synthesizing valued chemicals such as ammonia or hydrocarbons via industrial processes in addition to the direct energy extraction process in proton exchange membrane fuel cells [8,9]. Thus, the construction of H2 evolution catalysts has become a critical step for the development of sustainable renewable energy infrastructure, especially from an omnipresent source like water [10]. Platinum is a commonly used catalyst for H2 production reaction, but its low abundance and high cost have limited its utilization in the global scale [11]. Alternatively, Hydrogenase enzymes can efficiently produce H2 from the water with earth-abundant nickel and/or iron active sites. However, they are rarely utilized for industrial scale H2 production due to the fragility of these enzymes under chemically demanding conditions [12]. Despite the limitations, enzyme architecture has inspired the researchers to generate first-row transition metal-based sustainable, efficient, and scalable synthetic catalysts in the pursuit of water-mediated H2 production technology [13]. In the past decade, a plethora of inexpensive metal complexes have been explored for the role of H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Among them, cobalt-dimine dioxime [14-18], Cobalt polypyridyl [19,20], cobalt corroles-porphyrins [21,22], molybdenum-sulfur dimers [23], bimetallic [24,25], dithiolate complexes [26], carbene [27], cyclopentadienyl [28], macrocyclic complexes [29], Rhodium [30], ruthenium polypyridine [31-34], cobalt [35], and nickel-based complexes with diphosphine ligands consisting of pendant nitrogen bases can be cited as the primary examples of the most efficient synthetic HER catalysts [36]. Several di-iron-based complexes were developed, modeling the [Fe2] subsite of [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme [37]. These di-iron complexes nicely mimicked the active site; however, with their HER activity was either weak or absent [38-42]. Interestingly, their H2 production in aqueous solution was restored following its inclusion into a hydrogenase apoenzyme scaffold [43]. Recently, smaller peptides have been also utilized to develop di-iron complexes with limited activity [44,45]. These results indicated the importance of the protein environment in the catalyst design. In this process of constructing an efficient catalyst, appropriate remote regulation of the structure–function relationship of the molecular complex is warranted to optimize the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of the catalytic cycle. The Ni-bis-(diphosphine)-based DuBois catalyst is one of the prime examples of this strategy, where the proper positioning of a pendant amine in the second coordination sphere played a critical role in tuning the H2 binding affinity, basicity, homolytic bond association/dissociation energy, hydride donor/acceptor abilities, and the redox potentials of the NiP4 core to improve the overall catalytic performance [46-49]. The activity of the DuBois catalysts were further upgraded by the inclusion of a multi-component amino acid based proton relay in the form of an enzyme-inspired outer coordination sphere [50-52]. However, the acute air sensitivity of the Ni-bis-(diphosphine) complexes still casts serious doubts about their long-term stability under practical conditions [53]. On the contrary, cobalt-based molecular electrocatalysts are known for their oxygen tolerant H2 production activity [54-56] with moderate rate and overpotential [16,57-60]. However, the water insolubility of these cobalt complexes has restricted their electrocatalytic investigation mostly to the pure organic media. A number of such complexes were probed for photocatalytic HER in organic/aqueous blended solvents, albeit with poor long-term stability that limit their potential practical applications [29,61]. Research groups of Artero and Cao have independently adhered variants of molecular cobalt complexes on electroactive carbon nanotubes to induce heterogeneous HER activity [18,62]. Bren and co-workers have utilized outer coordination sphere scaffolds, in the form of protein and small peptides, to generate a series of water-soluble cobalt complexes [63-65]. These complexes exhibited HER activity in water only after the application of a huge overpotential. These results highlighted that the primary coordination sphere around the cobalt and the second/outer coordination sphere functionalities have to be properly synchronized for the evolution of the energy-efficient, water-soluble, and oxygen resistant HER catalysts. This bottom-up approach was utilized to induce aqueous HER activity in an otherwise inactive cobalt-salen core by the incorporation of peripheral amino acid-based basic functionalities. However, their H2 production catalysis was only detected in strongly acidic condition (pH ≤ 3) due to the intrusion of a closely positioned neighboring carboxylic acid group [66]. In a modified design, the peripheral basic groups were integrated remotely around a cobaloxime [Co-(dimethylglyoxime)2] core via an axially coordinated pyridine group. Here, the outer coordination sphere functionalities significantly improved the catalytic activity and chemical stability of these new set of catalysts in aqueous solution [67]. In this review, we have compared the different genres of cobalt-based molecular electrocatalysts that evolve H2 in a pure aqueous medium, while specifically highlighting the critical role of the outer sphere coordination sphere features during the catalysis."
1,Critical parameters for evaluating HER electrocatalysts:,"Over the past few decades, electrochemistry has been established as an useful tool for the evaluation of catalytic H2 evolution by metal complexes [68-74]. Both the catalytic rate and additional energy requirement (overpotential) and type (zone) of catalysis of an active catalyst can be probed in details via a range of electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chrono-coulometric, and chronoamperometry etc. [75] Typically, the two prime varieties of electrocatalysis are heterogeneous and homogeneous electrocatalysis. In heterogeneous system, the test material is directly adhered to the electrode via physisorption or chemisorption or covalent bonding through linker molecules. On the other hand, during the homogeneous electrochemistry, the electroactive species remains in the solution phase and only engages in electron transfer with solid-phase electrode. The complementary spectral techniques provide the opportunity to capture most of the possible intermediates during the catalytic cycle. Hence, the homogeneous system is a preferred choice for the researchers for probing the electrocatalytic properties of samples. The homogeneous electrocatalytic rate is typically expressed as turnover frequency (TOF). TOF is the number of moles of specific product formed per mole of catalyst in unit time [69,71,76]. This TOF measurement can be used as a proxy for observed rate constant (kobs ), which can be measured directly from the numerical analysis of the CV response of the test sample under catalytic conditions. Under ideal catalysis condition with no catalyst decomposition and side product formation, a reversible classical S-shaped response has been observed. Then kobs has been determined after scan rate independent plateau current condition. Dividing this plateau current with reversible peak current (ip ) gives diffusion coefficient and active surface area independent Eq. (2). Here, the stoichiometric current usually represents exchange of one-electron redox process. However, multi-electron stoichiometric processes are also known. In those cases, the equation is adjusted by dividing ip value with the exact number of electrons for multi-electron stoichiometric change [50]. So, the kobs or TOF can be calculated using the following Eq. (2). (2) i c i p = n 0.4463 RTk obs Fv 1 / 2 Here, ip is the stoichiometric peak current, ic is the catalytic peak current, n is the number of electrons involved in the catalytic process, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 Jk-1mol−1), T is the absolute temperature (in K), F is the Faraday constant (96485 Cmol−1), and ʋ is the scan rate (in Vs−1). The typical measurements of ip and ic are highlighted in Fig. 1 (A) with a model CV response from one of the representative cobaloxime complex [67,77]. In several cases, due to substrate consumption, side product formation, or adjacent reactions the current response deviates from the classical S-shaped CV. At this condition, it is proposed that “non-ideal catalytic voltammograms overlays with the idealized cyclic voltammogram near the beginning of the catalytic scan”. [76,78] Hence, the kinetic information extracted from near the foot of the wave is more reliable for these cases. This method is known as foot-of-the-wave-analysis (FOWA). Special care should be taken to accurately identify the initial catalytic position when the solvent (such as water) itself acts as the proton source. Either of the above-mentioned methods provides a general indication of the catalytic performance, although both of them have their own limitations. Catalytic process can go via either Electron-Chemical-Electron-Chemical (ECEC) or Electron-Electron-Chemical-Chemical (EECC) or simultaneously both process in a same system depending upon various factors [79]. Final release of hydrogen from active metal site can follow either metal/ligand assisted homolytic or heterolytic pathway [80,81]. Overpotential (ɳ) is another vital thermodynamic parameter that specifies the energy efficiency of the catalyst for a particular chemical reaction. It is generally defined as “the additional potential (beyond the thermodynamic requirement for the same reaction under same conditions) required to drive a reaction at a certain rate” and measured as per Eq. (3) [69,82]. (3) O v e r p o t e n t i a l η = E cat - E thermodynamic The measurement of the potential for the catalytic reaction is crucial for the evaluation of overpotential. Generally, this catalytic potential (Ecat ) is measured either at the onset or at the half-maxima or at the maximum current response of the catalytic wave, whereas the thermodynamic potential for H2 evolution in water is measured as per the following equation (4). However, in most of the recent studies, especially for heterogeneous catalysis, the Ecat is measured at the potential at which the catalytic current density achieves the value of 10 mA/cm2 [83]. The difference between Ecat (measured at half maxima or at the onset of catalytic response) and Ethermodynamic is known as the overpotential requirement at that specific condition (Fig. 1B). (4) E thermodynamic = E H + / 0.5 H 2 = 0 V - 0.059 × p H V Catalytic Tafel plot provide a direct correlation between the catalytic turnover frequency (TOF) and overpotential for a catalyst. Here, the logarithmic values of TOF are plotted against overpotential as measured from corresponding CV studies. As shown in Fig. 2 [73], the cobaloxime complex exhibited better energy efficiency compared to iron porphyrin, Ni-[bis-(phosphine)]2 complexes. Another parameter, turnover number (TON), which is defined as the number of moles of specific product formed per mole of the catalyst over a certain period of time, can also be measured by an electrochemical technique known as chronocoulometry. In this experiment, complementary gas chromatography (GC) is also performed for the detection and quantification of the gas generated (H2 in this case) during the study. This parameter is critical for the evaluation of long-term stability and current efficiency (also known as Faradaic efficiency) of the catalyst [76]. Hence, a precise picture of the structure–function relationship for an understudy molecular catalyst can be achieved from the in-depth analysis of these parameters as they are decisively influenced by the solvent, electrolyte, proton source, and surrounding conditions [70-72]. Here, it is worth mentioning that a number of these molecular electrocatalysts were also used for photocatalytic H2 production. In electrocatalysis, the metal complex is generally reduced by the electron provided from the electrode. While in the case of photocatalysis, a photosensitizer molecule is excited by electromagnetic irradiation. The excited photosensitizer, in turn, acts as an electron source to convert photons directly to chemical energy. The oxidized photosensitizer is terminally reduced by a sacrificial electron donor to revert the active photosensitizer. Variable combinations of photosensitizer-catalyst were utilized for successful photocatalytic H2 production such as: CdTe nanocrystal-hydrogenase enzyme [84], Ru-polypyridyl complex- Cobaloxime [31], photosystem-I (PSI)- Ni-[bis-phosphine)2] or cobaloxime [85,86], CdSe quantum dot- Ni-dithiolene complex [87], and streptavidin–biotin supported Co-polypyridyl system [88]."
2,Cobalt-based molecular electrocatalyst,"The research interest on cobalt-based materials began in the early 19th century [89,90], when it was observed that proteins could effectively generate hydrogen in the presence of cobalt salt during polarography study [91]. Later, Chao and Espenson discovered the critical role of molecular hydrido-cobalt complexes in this HER activity. Tetraaza-macrocyclic cobalt complexes (1–7, Fig. 3 ) were the popular choices as the catalyst for H2 production from acetonitrile/water mixture as it retained its activity even under CO and O2 atmospheres unlike the hydrogenase enzymes and Ni-based catalysts [14,92,93]. The mechanistic details of the catalytic activity of these cobalt(II) complexes were probed in details by Espenson [94]. Later, Hamid and co-worker established that the electrocatalytic H2 production by bis-(1,4,7-triazacyclodecane) Cobalt(III) complex proceeds via an ‘electron–electron-chemical-chemical’ (EECC) mechanism in the acidic medium [95]. The inclusion of an armed pendant amine in the molecular catalyst design altered the proton transfer rate during the catalytic cycle. This was exemplified by the difference in catalytic performance between macrocyclic hexamine and macrocyclic cage compounds. [96-99]. However, moderate rate and poor catalytic efficiency of these macrocyclic complexes have paved the way for the evolution of alternative genres of molecular cobalt-based HER catalysts [100]. Cobalt-corroles effectively produce hydrogen with ~ 100% current efficiency, although their intrinsic instability in acidic conditions has limited their usage [101-108]. Their activity in acidic medium was improved upon immobilization of these porphyrin analogues (8–15, Fig. 3) on glassy carbon/nafion/PVP coated electro-active surfaces [109-114]. Tactically inspired from fluorinated Co-corrole [103] Cao et al., developed a simple cost effective β-non fluorinated bi-functional Co-corrole catalyst. Glassy carbon immobilized Co-corrole system exhibited excellent HER activity while operating at 250 mV higher overpotential compared to its β–fluorinated analog [115]. They further grafted the complex on carbon nanotube through an array of grafting techniques. Among these surface immobilization methods, short-range linkage and π-π stacking displayed improved catalytic response over typical long-range covalent bonding. Covalent ligation through azo-amido-alkyne click chemistry resulted in the first Janus type catalyst with long-range aqueous stability [116,117]. A number of cobalt terpyridine complexes (16–21, Fig. 4 ) have been explored for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution that are active in organic medium or organic/aqueous mixture [118-121]. The surrounding pyridine moiety altered between the roles of chelating ligand and protonation site to control the H2 production activity of these complexes [122]. However, these catalysts warranted relatively high overpotential to display HER activity in both organic and organic/aqueous media. The tetra dentate N4-ligation has emerged as one of the optimized coordination geometries for cobalt complexes for effective hydrogen evolution activity, which was epitomized by the series of cobalt tetra-amine [81,123-130] and polypyridine [131-142] complexes (22–27, Fig. 5 ). Here the non-coordinated functionalities (such as amine, alcohol or alkyl chain) critically regulated the proton relay during the catalytic cycle. Some of these complexes (24, Fig. 5) produced heterogeneous nanoparticles during reductive scans, which are the predominant active species for the electrocatalytic H2 production activity [143]. Recently, a series of cobalt-salen like complexes, which were mostly known for their oxygen activating behavior, were probed for their potential hydrogen production activity (28, Fig. 6 ) [66,144-148]. These complexes exhibited moderate photocatalytic H2 production in pure and organic blended aqueous solutions. However, their electrocatalytic HER activity was mostly limited to heterogeneous condition. The inclusion of an enzyme-inspired peripheral basic functionalities around the Co-salen core allowed the evolution of otherwise unheard homogeneous electrocatalytic H2 production by these complexes in pure aqueous condition [66]. Cobalt-dithiolene complexes represent another unique class of cobalt-based H2 production catalysts (29–30, Fig. 6) [149-153]. The redox-active dithiolene motif improved the energy efficiency of the cobalt center, albeit with intrinsic oxygen sensitivity [154]. Usually the presence of redox partners around a catalytic core reduces the overpotential requirements for the multi-electron H2 production catalysis. In a different approach, bimetallic cobalt complexes were utilized to stimulate synchronous multi-electron exchange during catalysis (31–34, Fig. 7 ) [155]. However, the bulky nature of the multi-dentate ligand framework of these complexes affected their aqueous solubility [156-159]. The catalytic properties of cobalt-diimine complexes can be further regulated by the inclusion of appropriate axial ligand containing N-donor groups such as pyridine [16,77,160-163], imidazole [164,165], aniline [166,167], and their derivatives [168,169]. Research groups of Artero and Reisner have separately reported that the incorporation of an electron-withdrawing group on axial pyridine ligand (37, Fig. 7) decreases the overpotential requirement but destabilizes the complex during the catalytic cycle to curtail the catalytic rate of the derivatized cobaloximes [77,164]. On the contrary, the addition of an electron-donating group on the axial pyridine ligand shows the opposite effect to improve the stability and catalytic rate for the cobalt complexes. However, an increased electron density on the metal center warrants energy demanding reduction steps during the catalytic cycle, which is reflected by the relatively higher overpotential requirement for H2 production. A plethora of cobaloximes were synthesized so far on this platform where a variety of functionality such as alcohol [160,164,169], amide [16,169], cyanide [160], carboxylic acid [160,164], fluorescent dyes [170,171], nanotubes [62], phosphate [16,54], and even Nano-ITO slides [172,173] were linked through axial N-donating linker (37, Fig. 8 ) to improve the catalytic efficiency, water solubility, and long term stability of the parent cobaloxime core. However, most of the cobaloxime could be examined only for photocatalytic H2 production due to their inherent instability during hydride transfer from Co to ligand under aqueous electrocatalytic conditions. The BF2-bridged and phenyl-substituted Cobaloxime exhibited improved HER activity, although with the poor stability in acidic conditions (35–36, Fig. 8). [15,16,59,60,174,175]. The cobalt complexes, coordinated by N4-diimine-dioxime ligand scaffold, have exhibited relatively better catalytic stability, albeit with a significant drop in their catalytic rate [161,176-179]. Despite these shortcomings, the oxygen-insensitive H2 production reactivity exhibited by these cobalt-based molecular catalysts [180-182] highlights their potential for direct application in the industrial solar energy harvest [183,184]."
3,Enzyme-Inspired Cobalt-Containing molecular Electrocatalysts:,"The protein scaffold surrounding the metal active site in hydrogenase enzyme plays an essential role in achieving efficient catalysis with earth-abundant metals [185]. This protein scaffold is believed to create an outer coordination sphere (OCS) network that tunes the catalysis by regulating the electron and proton transport along with the substrate movement to and fro into the active site [186-188]. The significance of this protein scaffold-based OCS was exemplified when the inclusion of an otherwise inactive [Fe2(aza-propane-dithiolate)(CO)4(CN)2])core into an hydrogenase apoenzyme created a fully functional artificial holoenzyme with catalytic H2 production rate analogous to the native hydrogenases [43]. Ghirlanda et al. incorporated synthetic diiron clusters in a de novo designed peptide framework to initiate photosensitized H2 production by the construct [44]. Recently, Shafaat and her co-workers swapped the central iron with nickel in the rubredoxin protein to generate an artificial metalloenzyme. This Ni substituted rubredoxin displayed catalytic H2 production in aqueous solution [189,190]. In a different approach, Pyun et al, selected polymer support as an outer coordination sphere around synthetic α-haloester functionalized [2Fe-2S] cluster [191]. The effect of the polymeric backbone was tested on variable platforms including nonionic, ionic, and intermediate polymers. Among them, ionic polymer exhibited the best catalytic response with high turnover rate and low overpotential (230 mV). Water soluble-polymer support further improved the overall stability and oxygen insensitivity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster bound system [192]. Recently, Ward et al. also employed the streptavidin–biotin binding strategy to integrate a protein atmosphere around synthetic cobalt complex to induce improved water solubility while maintaining efficient photocatalytic HER activity [193]. Protein or Peptide Containing Cobalt Catalyst Tactically inspired from enzyme architecture, Bren and her co-workers constructed a cobalt-containing metallopeptide cobalt peroxidase-11 (CoMP11-Ac) via a histidine linkage. The artificial metallopeptide, acetylated CoMP11-Ac, was active for hydrogen evolution under aerobic aqueous condition. Inclusion of a single proximal peptide chain ensures water solubility with high TON for this sample. However, the practical application of CoMP11-Ac was hindered due to its high energy requirements (requires ~852 mV Overpotential, η) and instability (rapidly deactivates on mercury electrode) (40, Fig. 9 ) [64]. Later, they have redesigned the porphyrin binding pocket based on naturally occurring Hydrogenobactor thermophilus cytochrome c552 (Ht-c552) and attached it to the polypeptide chain. The cobalt substituted M61A variant of Ht-c552 (Ht-CoIIIM61A) improved the catalytic performance in terms of TON by ~10 times and longevity of the construct. However, the energy efficiency (η ~ 830 mV) of this synthetic metallopeptide remained unaltered (38, Fig. 9) [194]. Addition of another distal decapeptide chain to a deuteroporphyrin enhance the TON as well as stability further for cobalt-mimochrome VI*a (CoMC6*a) sample. Addition of trifluoroethanol (TFE) induced better folding of CoMC6*a and improved the energy efficiency of this metallopeptide for HER catalysis (39, Fig. 9). The catalytic H2 production performance by the metallopeptide was enhanced further when two additional peptide chains were linked with the metal-binding pocket [63]. Thus, Bren et al. established that the inclusion of rationally designed peptide scaffold can ensure water solubility, upgrade the catalytic performance, and enhance the durability of metallopeptide-based HER catalysts. Despite all the progress, the relatively low energy efficiency (high overpotential requirement) of this genre of electrocatalysts remained a concern. This huge energy penalty is typically attributed to the rigidity of the metal core in these metallopeptide motifs [195]. In a parallel catalyst design method, Bren and her co-workers developed small tripeptide (GGH) derived from the amino-terminal copper-and nickel (ATCUN) binding metallopeptide to exclusively produce cobalt bound metallo-tripeptide CoGGH (41, Fig. 10 ). This small metallopeptide provided better flexibility around the metal primary coordination sphere and displayed oxygen-tolerant electrochemical hydrogen production activity near-neutral aqueous medium (pH ~ 8) with slightly improved overpotential requirement [196]. Here, the interactions between the peripheral functional groups induce ‘entatic state’ around the metal catalytic center that significantly alters the energy landscape [197]. The comparative data of the H2 producing cobalt-peptide complexes are provided in Table 1 , which clearly depicts that despite the improvement in catalytic rates there is much room for improvement before these bio-inspired electrocatalysts can match the native enzymes in terms of energy efficiency [198,199]."
4,Polar peripheral functional groups containing cobalt Electrocatalyst:,"4.1 Polar peripheral functional groups containing cobalt Electrocatalyst: The practical usage of the synthetic cobalt-based metallopeptides was hindered by the inherent instability of these samples in harsher chemical conditions (low pH, high temperature, even presence of O2 in some cases) and poor energy efficiency. Shaw and her co-workers attempted to resolve this issue via a different approach. In a distinct bio-inspired catalyst design strategy, they included only the minimal and essential features of the outer coordination sphere on the ligand framework in the form of natural amino acids [50,200]. They developed a series of modified Ni-bis-(diphosphine) complexes with appended multi-component proton channel to enable even reversible H2 production behavior (operating at almost zero overpotential for both H2 production and H2 oxidation) in acidic aqueous solutions [52,201,202]. However, the air sensitivity of the Ni-bis-(diphosphine) complexes casted serious doubts on their long-term stability under practical conditions [53]. Analogous Co-(P2N2)2 complexes were also developed to introduce secondary coordination sphere effects on the relatively air-stable cobalt core. Interestingly, one of the P2N2 ligands was replaced by solvent molecules for these cobalt complexes (43, 45, Fig. 11 ) while it exhibited moderate H2 production in acidic acetonitrile solvent (44, Fig. 11) [35]. The pendant amine consisting ligands expectedly influenced the energy efficiency and catalytic performance of these cobalt complexes during catalytic HER activity [203], while the structural flexibility and electron-withdrawing effect exerted by the ligand substituents reduced the overpotential requirement for these catalysts (46, Fig. 11) [204]. Nevertheless, the limited water solubility of this set of cobalt complexes affected their long-term acid stability under electrocatalytic conditions to hamper their potential applications in practical conditions (42, Fig. 11) [205]. Nocera et al. designed the unique hangman complexes that contain a pendant –COOH group in the vicinity of a cobalt-porphyrin core. During the design, catalytically active cobalt-porphyrin core was separated from the –COOH groups by a xanthene spacer (CoHPX-COOH) (47a, Fig. 12 ). The effect of this fringe –COOH group was obvious when the –Br substituted analogue (CoHPX-Br) exhibited a significant decrease in the electrocatalytic H2 production response (47b, Fig. 12). Despite this secondary coordination sphere effect, the first generation of this hangman complexes displayed poor energy efficiency (η ~ 800 mV) during H2 evolution [206-209]. Cao et al. included hanging phosphonic acid groups linked through dibenzofuran on cobalt corroles to develop the next generation of hangman complexes (48, Fig. 12). These complexes demonstrated considerable HER activity possibly due to the electron-donating effect of the pendant phosphonic groups. A comparative study after depositing to the glassy carbon surface displayed that the catalytic H2 production by this complexes at a neutral aqueous buffer solution can be regulated in the following order by varying the pendant functionalities: Co-CH2PO(OH)2 > Co-PO(OH)2 > Co-COOH > Co-Br [210]. It is worth mentioning that all the corroles and porphyrin-based cobalt electrocatalysts still remained energy inefficient due to their comparatively high overpotential requirement (Table 2 ). On the contrary, the cobalt complexes ligated in tetra-imine macrocyclic N4 motifs with secondary and outer coordination sphere features displayed relatively low overpotential values. Electro-active surface (ITO or glassy carbon) immobilized aryl-substituted tetraimine cobalt complex consisting of –COOH groups required only 200–450 mV of energy penalty for displaying heterogeneous proton reduction (51, Fig. 12). The exchange of the oxime functionalities with BF2 groups further improved the energy efficiency for these surface adsorbed tetra-imine-bound cobalt complexes (51b, Fig. 12) [174]. During the catalytic H2 evolution cycle for these complexes, the oxidative addition step occurs at the coordinatively unsaturated metal core followed by an outer sphere electron transfer. This electron transfer process was generally coupled with the vital proton relay step. This proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) is typically boosted by the presence of peripheral acid/base functionalities. The complexes [Co(trans-diammac]3+ and [Co(cis-diammac)]3+ did not contain any vacant site around the central metal ion. Complexes of these series are strongly adsorbed on the polarized electrode in their corresponding reduced forms. In this condition, they mediate a rapid inner sphere electron transfer between the electrode and metal-core to facilitate proton reduction. In comparatively acidic medium, pendant amine groups of [Co(trans-diammac]3+ are more susceptible to protonation, which induces fast proton exchange during the catalysis (49–50, Fig. 12) [96]. The inclusion of peripheral basic functionalities in the form of amino acids induced a dramatic effect on an otherwise HER inactive cobalt-salen like complexes (52, Fig. 13 ). This dormant core was activated for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution once natural amino acid was attached to the proximity of the metal core. The fringe carboxylic acid groups, present amino acids fragment, played a vital role to demonstrate a pH-triggered HER activity for these complexes [66]. Despite this distinct outer coordination sphere induced catalytic activity, the proton reduction activity of these complexes was restricted by the narrow chemical space (HER activity only at pH ≤ 3) and high overpotential (η ~ 750–800 mV) (Table 2). These drawbacks were rectified by varying the metal core to cobalt-bis-(dimethylglyoxime) [Co–(dmg)2]. Here, the peripheral basic functionalities were incorporated via an axially coordinated pyridine ligand (53, Fig. 13). This unique catalyst design strategy ensured that the OCS-based functionalities remained distant from the cobalt core to avoid any primary coordination interaction. The presence of the peripheral basic functionalities significantly improved the HER activity of the cobaloxime core while maintaining a moderate overpotential requirement (Table 2). This enhancement in catalytic reactivity was attributed to the generation of a multi-component proton relay around the metal core [165]. Co(dmg)2 core typically loses the axial pyridine ligand in organic media that severely hampers the durability of the complex. However, the inclusion of basic group appended pyridine induces water solubility for the same cobaloxime core. Additionally, these peripheral groups generate an intricate hydrogen-bonding network in aqueous solution that stabilizes the Co-axial pyridine ligation. Hence, the trans-positioned axial chloride ion is substituted by the solvent water molecule during the HER catalysis by these peripheral functionalized cobaloximes. In a parallel approach, [CoX2DO(DOH)Pn] core was developed containing a robust primary ligand platform. The catalytic activity for this complex was further improved by rationally tethering a flexible pyridine motif to the equatorially positioned oxime-imine core. [179,211] The detailed analysis of the impact of these outer coordination sphere functionalities on the aqueous H2 production activity for complexes 52–53 are discussed in the next section."
5,Effect of peripheral basic functionalities on the HER activity of cobalt molecular electrocatalysts,"In this section, the detailed spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis of Co-salen type and cobaloxime-pyridine derivative complexes are discussed to highlight the role of the fringe basic facilities on the corresponding catalytic activity. Peripheral basic functionality controlled pH-switchable HER activity for Co-salen type complexes: The natural amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine were included in the salen-ligand framework for the synthesis of the Co-salen type complexes with the peripheral basic functionalities (52, Fig. 13). The formation of square planar Co-N2O2 coordination geometry was evident from the generation of the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) and cobalt-centered d-d transition bands in the corresponding optical spectra (Fig. 14 A). It was speculated that the carboxylic acid groups would compete with the Cl- and solvent water molecules for the axial coordination spot for around the octahedral cobalt center. However, this COO––Co binding was expected to occur only at pH ≥ 4.0 for these complexes as the pK a of this peripheral carboxylic acid is ~4.0. The presence of optically active natural amino acid induces chirality into an otherwise achiral cobalt core during ligation. Thus, the circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to monitor the interactions between the fringe amino acids and the central cobalt metal. As shown in Fig. 14C, the chiral LMCT band near 360 nm exhibited a clear deviation when the acidity of the solution was adjusted below pH 3.0. This pH-triggered shift in chiral LMCT band can be attributed to a change in the primary coordination sphere of the cobalt center. Hence, it was hypothesized that the COO––Co binding was disrupted following the protonation of the COO– group during this pH regulation. Interestingly, this vital pH-dependent in the metal coordination sphere change was only visible in CD spectra but not in the corresponding optical spectra. This observation possibly highlighted the dominance of salen (N2O2) ligand-cobalt interactions during the LMCT transitions (Fig. 14B). This pH-mediated cobalt coordination change directly regulated the catalytic HER activity of these Co-salen type complexes in aqueous solution. The tyrosine-bound cobalt complex 52d displayed homogeneous proton reduction catalysis only at pH ≤ 3 (Fig. 15 ). Similar activity was also observed for phenylalanine-integrated complex 52c. However, such pH-switchable HER catalysis activity was not observed for decarboxylated complexes 52a-b [66]. All these data lead to the hypothesis that at pH > 4 conditions, the deprotonated carboxylate groups (–COO-) strongly ligated the metal center to prevent any protonation and hence pauses the catalytic H2 evolution cycle (Fig. 16 ). However, at pH < 4, the same carboxylate functionalities were protonated to produce carboxylic acid groups (–COOH) and were detached from the primary coordination sphere of the central cobalt ion. At this condition, the HER activity set in with the available protonation site on cobalt, while the neighboring carboxylic acid groups played the role of an H+-relay to boost the catalytic performance (Fig. 16). The direct involvement of the –COOH groups in this proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step was supported by the merging of stoichiometric Co(III/II) redox signals only at pH ≤ 3. Peripheral basic functionality constructs synthetic proton relay to boost the HER activity for Cobaloxime core: A series of Cobaloximes with variable fringe basic functionalities was generated by mutating the axially coordinating pyridine derivatives. This strategy allowed the formation of one, two, and three-component proton relay system around the identical Co-N5 core (53, Fig. 13). The inclusion of the amino acid-derived proton channel (53c-d) substantially (2–9.5 times) improved the catalytic H2 production exhibited by the control Co(dimethylglyoxime)2-pyridine complex at neutral aqueous condition (Fig. 17 A). The cobaloxime-pyridine complexes typically do not display any homogeneous H2 production reactivity below pH 5 [77,164]. The reductive quenching of the photosensitizer is diminished under this condition; however, the rupturing of the primary oxime network and lack of electrons slow down the overall catalytic cycle. However, the inclusion of the synthetic OCS features around the complex demonstrated uninterrupted Fig. 17 homogeneous catalytic response (B). This observation suggested that the presence of the surrounding basic functionalities expanded the active catalytic space for the cobaloxime core even in the acidic conditions (pH < 5). However, the magnitude of the catalytic HER current response was reduced ~5 fold despite an increase in the acidity of the aqueous solution (pH 7 → pH 4), which possibly indicates to a pH-dependent change in H2 production reaction mechanism. Detailed computational studies from Artero and Sit groups have independently established that the hydrogen-bonded oxime groups, present in the primary coordination sphere of cobaloxime, acts as the primary protonation site (not the reduced metal center) during the proton reduction catalytic cycle [212-214]. That hydrogen bonded oxime groups are protonated (pK a ~ 4.0) in acidic conditions (pH ≤ 5.0) to exhibit a loss of the catalytic activity. The two dimensional NMR spectroscopy technique nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) was employed to decipher the effect of the neighboring basic groups on the catalytic reactivity. The NOESY data of tyrosine bound cobaloxime (53d) revealed the existence of an interactive proton relay between the tyrosine derived phenolic –OH, amine, and the hydrogen-bonded oxime along with solvent water molecules. The critical proton exchange interaction between the peripheral basic groups and the oxime functionality was visibly disrupted upon addition of acid in the same NMR solution of 53d. Interestingly, the proton exchange between the neighboring amine and phenolic-OH with the solvent water continued to exist even in this acidic condition. All these data indicated towards a dual role of the peripheral basic groups during catalysis. In the neutral condition, the protonation expectedly occurred at the hydrogen-bonded oximes while the nexus of the basic functionalities and water molecules boosted the proton movement around the metal to exhibit significant rate enhancement (Fig. 18 ). This improvement in the catalytic HER rate was directly correlated to the size of the peripheral proton relay system. On the other hand, the primarily coordinated hydrogen bonded oxime network collapsed in acidic condition as exemplified by the appearance of the protonated oxime peak at ~11 ppm in the NMR. However, the outer coordination sphere bound protic functionalities continued the catalytic cycle by providing a secondary protonation site after the deactivation of the hydrogen-bonded oximes (Fig. 19 ). However, this alternative protonation spot failed to match the efficiency of the hydrogen bonded oximes that is highlighted by the subdued catalytic rate at pH ≤ 5.0 condition compared to the neutral aqueous solution. The electrochemical data recorded at pH 7.0 further unveiled two independent H2 evolution mechanisms by the cobaloximes. As shown in Fig. 18(a), the model cyclic voltammogram (CV) for cobaloximes demonstrated two different H2 production catalytic responses following the stoichiometric Co(III/II) signal in neutral condition. The spectroelectrochemical data revealed that the electrochemically generated Co(II) species continued to exist even during the initial HER catalysis observed in the less reducing atmosphere (~-0.8 V) (Fig. 18(b)). The exchange of the axial Cl- ion by solvent water molecule on the cobalt core amplified this catalytic response, while acidification of the sample (pH ≤ 5.0) made it disappear (Fig. 19) [67]. All this information pointed to a Co(II)-centered H2 production cycle, where the critical protonation step was influenced by the hydrogen-bonded oxime as well as the axially coordinated water molecule to the cobalt center (formed following the axial Cl- exchange) (Fig. 18). Another intense catalytic H2 production signal was noticed when the scan was continued to further reducing potential (~−1.0 V). The corresponding spectroelectrochemical data demonstrated the consumption of Co(II) ion during this step (Fig. 18(b)). This data suggested that this second HER catalysis possibly followed a Co(I)-centered H2 production mechanism (Fig. 19). The presence of the peripheral basic functionalities positively influenced both the catalytic mechanisms presumably by promoting the H+ movement via an interactive proton relay. Intriguingly, the presence of Cl- ions played a crucial role in the rate enhancement for the Co(I)-centric H2 production in cobaloximes. The single crystal structures of the cobaloximes (53a-b, Fig. 20 ) also exhibited specifically positioned water molecules that connected various segments of the basic functionalities of the complex framework [67]. A number of Cl- ions also actively participated in the formation of this plausible water-mediated proton relay as demonstrated by the crystallographic data of 53a-b ( Fig. 20). As shown in the figure, these Cl- ions generated unique [(Cl−)m(H2O)n] for both the complexes to complete the proton exchange network between the remotely positioned basic functional groups and the hydrogen-bonded oximes. Hence, it was hypothesized that these Cl- ions were probably also involved in the peripheral basic group mediated H+ transport around the cobaloxime core during the catalytic cycle."
6,Concluding remarks,"The oxygen-stable and moderately active cobalt-based molecular catalysts were lagging behind other contemporary H2 evolution catalysts due to their poor water solubility and long-term instability. However, those shortcomings were rectified by the inclusion of enzyme-inspired features in terms of synthetic proteins, peptides, and minimal basic functionalities around existing cobalt cores. The strategic positioning of the peripheral basic groups has even induced HER activity into an otherwise inactive Co-salen type complex. On the other hand, these neighboring protic functionalities construct artificial water-mediated proton relay around the metal core to enhance the catalytic performance, durability, and active chemical space of the basic cobalt core."
