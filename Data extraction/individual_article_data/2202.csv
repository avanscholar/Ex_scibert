0,Introduction,"Due to our over-reliance on fossil fuels and the effect on global warming and air pollution, it is urgent to explore more sustainable and alternative resources for a circular and carbon-neutral development (Yong Jiang, 2020). To date, many researchers have paid attention to biomass-derived fuels and chemicals (e.g., hydrogen, methane and alcohols), which are regarded as an important contribution to meeting these sustainability criteria (Liu et al., 2020; Steinbusch et al., 2011). Microbial fermentation, for instance, is widely employed as a promising route to convert low-grade biomass into renewable products (Kiefer et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, with 2–5 carbon atoms) have attracted considerable attention in recent years, due to their high value and versatile utilization as raw materials for chemicals (Moscoviz et al., 2018). However, the separation and purification of SCFAs from the fermentation broth is still cost-ineffective (Yin et al., 2017). Recently, the production of caproate (C6), a typical medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs, 6–12 carbon atoms), from acetate (C2) or butyrate (C4) through the reverse β-oxidation (RBO) pathway has been gaining attention, as one of the options for solving the above-mentioned issues, thanks to its hydrophobic nature and high energy density (Angenent et al., 2016; Urban et al., 2017). To start the chain elongation (CE) process, ethanol, hydrogen or lactate need to be available as the electron donors (ED) in the fermentation liquor containing SCFAs (Wu et al., 2019). Grootscholten et al. (2013) obtained caproate yields of 16.6 g/L/d in up-flow anaerobic filters and achieved a high caproate selectivity of 91 % from acetate and ethanol. Zagrodnik et al. (2020) observed a caproate production of 7.67 ± 0.37 g/L by mixed culture (heat-treated anaerobic digester sludge and Clostridium kluyveri) from lactose, lactate, acetate, and ethanol. In addition, this process is greatly affected by some operation parameters, such as hydrogen partial pressure, pH value and methanogenesis. According to literature, the optimal pH range of the microorganism Clostridium kluyveri, a crucial microorganism in the CE process, is 5.5–7.4 (Zhang et al., 2013). Previous studies also confirmed that certain steps of the process, such as the oxidation of ethanol to acetyl-CoA and acetate, can be inhibited under excessive hydrogen partial pressure (P H2 ) (Wu et al., 2019), and that the decrease of pH value increases product toxicity (Li et al., 2018b). Meanwhile, inhibitors, such as sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (2-BES), can be applied to minimize the consumption of SCFAs by methanogens (Grootscholten et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016). Other operating parameters reported in literature have an effect on CE processes include, besides the already mentioned ED, the organic loading, reactor configuration, as well as the inoculum type (Fernando-Foncillas and Varrone, 2021). Electro-fermentation (EF) has been increasingly considered to implement the CE process, by controlling the fermentation environment and reducing the external ED dosage (Schievano et al., 2016). EF is an upcoming technology that exploits the electrochemical interactions between microorganisms and electrodes, in a controlled way. More in detail, EF uses microbial cells to catalyze the oxidation of organic/inorganic substances in which electrons are supplied and transferred to the anode. During the EF-mediated CE process, the in-situ produced hydrogen and ethanol, at the electrodes, can serve as EDs (Fig. 1 ). The functional microorganisms, attaching to the electrodes, are inexpensive self-regenerating biocatalysts that facilitate the electrode redox reaction and release the Gibbs free energy, by mediating intermediate reactions (Angenent et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017). Van Eerten-Jansen et al. (Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013), for instance, reached a caproate concentration of 739 mg/L when using the electrodes as ED. The reaction period lasted 15 days, which was due to the slow reaction rate and limited energy produced during the reduction of acetate to ethanol. Notably, the study by Gonzalez-Cabaleiro et al. (González-Cabaleiro et al., 2013) indicated that acetate reduction to butyrate was not feasible when using hydrogen as the sole ED, due to the kinetic and thermodynamic limitations, with highly endergonic reactions (ΔG 0 = 27.1 kJ/mol) even at high P H2 values. For this reason, it is necessary to investigate the concurrence of external EDs and electrodes for the promotion of CE process. Jiang et al. (2020a) showed that the selectivity of caproate production increased from 32.2 ± 32.6 % (only electrode) to 91.5 ± 0.6 % (ethanol + electrode) from CO2. However, the effect of coexistence of ethanol and electrode on caproate production from SCFAs has not been clarified yet. The contribution of ethanol as ED and carbon-donor needs to be clarified. Besides, fermentation broths can contain both, EDs and electron acceptors (EAs), as in the case of liquor-making wastewater and the effluent of waste-derived syngas fermentation (Wu et al., 2019). The contribution of EF on caproate production from this kind of feedstock has been seldom investigated. Hence, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect and feasibility of multiple EDs, by bio-cathode and externally-added ethanol, on the caproate production from acetate, using a series of single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Different ratios of acetate to ethanol and their effect on product specificity were investigated. The hydrogen partial pressure and bioelectrochemical characteristics of the controlled MECs were monitored to assess product stability and biofilm activities. Finally, microbial community dynamics and molecular ecological networks (MENs), in response to caproate production, were revealed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and enrichment procedure,"2.1 Inoculum and enrichment procedure A caproate-producing microbial consortium was acclimated in 100 mL serum bottles via selective medium: 5 g/L acetate and 15.78 g/L ethanol (served as EA and ED, respectively), 3.6 g/L NH4H2PO4, 5.4 g/L NaHCO3, 5 mL/L mineral salts and 10 μL/L vitamin solution. 2-BES was added as the methanogenic inhibitor, with a concentration of 10 g/L pH was controlled at 6.5 using 5.0 M HCl or 2 M NaOH. A mixture of activated sludge (Zhengyang wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), Jinzhong), garden soil (TYUT Mingxiang Campus) and anaerobic sludge (Xiaohongmen WWTP, Beijing) was applied as the initial inoculum. Prior to use, the waste activated sludge (WAS) was filtrated by a 40-mesh sieve, to remove impurities, followed by gravity settling for 24 h to concentrate. Serum bottles, feeding fresh selective medium and mixed sludge, were initially sparged with nitrogen fand incubated in an air-bath shaker (120 rpm) at 35 ± 1 °C. The cultured bacterial suspensions were transferred to the same selective medium every 5–8 days."
3,MECs reactors setup and operation,"2.2 MECs reactors setup and operation Single-chamber MECs with a working volume of 200 mL were constructed. Three electrodes were configurated in each reactor: anode, cathode and reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode). Anode and cathode were made of carbon brush (3 × 6 × 12 cm) and carbon cloth coated with Pt/C catalyst (3 × 6 cm2, 0.5 mg Pt cm−2 in reactive surface), respectively. Prior to use, the carbon brush was pretreated by acetone for 24 h and burned at 450 °C for 30 min. A gas bag (0.5 L, Hai de Co, Ltd, Dalian, China) was connected to each reactor. The enriched caproate-producing microbial consortium (10 % v/v) was used as the inoculum for MECs setup with a voltage of 0.8 V at 22 ± 2 °C. Before inoculation, the enriched consortium was centrifuged (10,000 g) and washed for three times to remove the residual fatty acids and ethanol. The medium contained 3.6 g/L (NH4)H2PO4, 0.33 g/L MgCl2·6H2O, 0.2 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.15 g/L KCl, 4 g/L K2CO3, 3.7 g/L NaOH, 5 mL/L micronutrient solution and 10 μL/L B-vitamins solution (Raes et al., 2017; Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013). All MECs reactors were equally divided into three groups, and then fed with the mixture of acetate and ethanol with a molar ratio (RA/E) of 1:0, 1:1.5 and 1:3 (referred to as RA/E = 1:0, RA/E = 1:1.5, RA/E = 1:3, respectively.). Each group was set up as open circuits (OC) and closed circuits (The MEC mentioned above) in triplicate. The enriched microbial consortium was inoculated into all the MECs groups in the first three cycles (8 d as a cycle), and fed with 50 mmol/L acetate and 0 (RA/E = 1:0), 75 (RA/E = 1:1.5), 150 mmol/L (RA/E = 1:3) ethanol, respectively. No inoculation was carried out for the next cycles. The compositions of substrates were adjusted to 25 mmol/L acetate and 0 (RA/E = 1:0), 37.5 (RA/E = 1:1.5), 75 mmol/L (RA/E = 1:3) ethanol for the three groups, respectively. The pH of the medium was controlled at 6.0 ± 0.1 by using 5.0 M HCl and 2.0 M NaOH. The current, substrate degradation and caproate production were monitored in regular time intervals, until stable. This period was then recorded as the operating period cycle. Subsequently, MECs operation was divided into two phases: initially, the pH varied as the reaction proceeded (Phase 1), while it was kept stabile at pH 6.0 in Phase 2. During MECs set-up and operation, the top of the reactors was filled with N2 to ensure the anaerobic environment required by the microorganisms."
4,Illumina MiSeq sequencing and analysis,"2.3 Illumina MiSeq sequencing and analysis The enriched caproate-producing microbial consortium, the mixed suspended and biofilms in the controlled reactors were collected. The carbon brush and carbon cloth were firstly immersed in sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and vortexed to ensure detachment (Liang et al., 2019). E. Z.N.A™ Mag-Bind Soil DNA Kit (Sangon Biotech bioengineering Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) was used to extract the DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with 341 F-805 R for V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16 S rRNA genes was conducted and Illumina MiSeq platform was used for DNA sequencing. The raw sequence (No. PRJNA723488) was submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive database. Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct and visualize the MENs of the key microbiomes, based on random matrix theory (Huang et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2021)."
5,Analytical methods and calculations,"2.4 Analytical methods and calculations Gases (i.e., hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide), alcohols (ethanol and butanol) and C2–C6 carboxylic acids (i.e., acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and caproate) were measured via gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 B, USA). Cathode potential was automatically measured by a multi-channel data potentiometer (Model 2700, Keithley Instrument). Both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) scanning were conducted via an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI660, China); the setting details were consistent with our previous study (Liu et al., 2020). Carbon balance was calculated based on the carbon supply of substrates and all fermentation products (in g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L). The equivalent COD conversion factors of organics were: 1.07 g COD/g acetate, 1.82 g COD/g butyrate, 2.28 g COD/g caproate, 2.08 g COD/g ethanol and 2.6 g COD/g butanol. Caproate specificity (SCaproate) was calculated based on electrons according to Eq. (1). (1) SCaproate = QCaproate / Qproduct Where QCaproate is the maximum caproate concentration (g COD/L), Qproduct is the total concentration of all the reduced organics (g COD/L). Electron recovery efficiencies (ηi), based on the electron transfer, were calculated according to Eq. (2). (2) ηi = Qi / (∫Idt/F + Qproduct) Where the subscript i referred to the reduced organics, I is the current value (A), t is the production time (s), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol e−). The number of electrons contained in the reduced organics is as follows: 8 mol e−/mol acetate, 20 mol e−/mol butyrate, 32 mol e−/mol caproate, 12 mol e−/mol ethanol, 2 mol e−/mol H2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of substrates on caproate production,"3.1 Effect of substrates on caproate production Concentrations of butyrate and caproate during enrichment time (using acetate and ethanol as initial substrates) are shown in Fig. S1. The n-butyrate concentration peaked at 13.0 g COD/L during the second and third transfer of the acclimation periods, but gradually decreased to 11.0 and 9.0 g COD/L during 4–6 and 7–11 cycles, respectively. After six transfers (day 30), stable conditions were achieved, with high caproate production (25.0–30.0 g COD/L). As a comparison, caproate production from a previous research by Yin et al. (2017) reached 19.20 g COD/L. The variations of carboxylic acids (acetate, butyrate and caproate) and alcohols (ethanol and butanol) concentrations under different RA/E and pH were investigated and presented in Fig. 2 . During Phase 1, caproate concentration peaked at 179 mg COD/L (3 d) in RA/E = 1:0_MEC. It further increased to 501 mg COD/L by operating the MECs bioreactor under a controlled pH value (Fig. 2A and B). However, it was difficult to maintain a stable performance. Notably, caproate production was remarkably increased and stably maintained in MECs with ethanol addition (Fig. 2C–F). This result was similar to the observations of Van Eerten-Jansen et al. (Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013), who concluded that external EDs addition was favourable to continuous caproate production. In the MECs with RA/E of 1:1.5 and 1:3, caproate concentration achieved an average of 3016 mg COD/L and 6510 mg COD/L during 4–6 d electro-fermentation, respectively. Meanwhile, butyrate first accumulated to a peak concentration (from 2 d forward) but decreased with the electro-fermentation time extension. Remarkably, the introduction of the bio-cathode contributed with a 10.7 ± 0.50 % (Phase 1, RA/E = 1:1.5) and 26.1 ± 1.38 % (Phase 1, RA/E = 1:3) increase over the MECs run at open circuit. This was attributed to the increased electron donors (hydrogen and ethanol), provided by the electrode (Fig. 1A). By comparison with traditional CE process based on ethanol and acetate, microbial electrosynthesis generated additional multiple pathways to accomplish caproate production from acetate, while generating additional in-situ produced EDs, such as hydrogen and ethanol. The specific thermodynamic information of possible reactions involved in this system is illustrated in Fig. 1B. At pH 6.0 (Phase 2), caproate production increased by 6 %–14 % over that of Phase 1 and peaked at 7454 mg COD/L in RA/E = 1:3_MEC, associated to a 14 %–39 % decrease of butyrate concentration. This result confirmed that the CE process may be affected by pH value, to some extent, as previously reported (Yin et al., 2017). Furthermore, when the pH value of MECs reactors dropped from initial 6.0 to 5.5 (RA/E = 1:1.5) and 4.9 (RA/E = 1:3), caproate production was inhibited (Fig. S2). This was consistent with the observations of Yin et al. (2017) and another previous study, showing that the bio-conversion of substrates was clearly inhibited under pH 5.5 in the CE process (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). Moreover, possible synergistic relationships among the key microbiome in the controlled reactors is also a key factor, which will be elaborated later on (in sections 3.5 and 3.6)."
8,Changes in caproate specificity and hydrogen partial pressure,"3.2 Changes in caproate specificity and hydrogen partial pressure The trend of caproate specificity associated well with the shift between butyrate and caproate as the dominant products. As shown in Fig. 3 A, caproate specificity in the closed-circuit groups was higher than that in the open-circuit groups, and it successfully enhanced by 23.2 % (RA/E = 1:0), 6.2 % (RA/E = 1:1.5) and 14.8 % (RA/E = 1:3) at pH 6. The result indicated that a small partial electron provided by the electrode could significantly affect the product spectrum (Moscoviz et al., 2016; Yong Jiang, 2020). Clearly, RA/E also played an important role in the CE process mediated by electro-fermentation. With the increase of ethanol, caproate specificity showed a rising trend, achieving for instance 67.8 % in RA/E = 1:3_OC versus 0 % in RA/E = 1:0_OC and 80.9 % (RA/E = 1:3_MEC) versus 5.4 % (RA/E = 1:0_MEC). As anticipated, the other key factor affecting CE efficiency in MECs was the pH adjustment, which determined a 17.8 %, 7.2 % and 7.8 % increase in RA/E = 1:0, 1:1.5 and 1:3, respectively. Interestingly, a previous study showed that stable pH value can promote the conversion of butyrate to caproate. The authors found that when the reaction solution was acidified by the formation of carboxylic acid, caproate production was inhibited, in absence of pH adjustment (Yong Jiang, 2020). Hydrogen can also serve as ED and participate in the CE process; thus P H2 was measured in this study (Fig. 3B). The values varied between 0.08 and 0.15 bar in all closed-circuit reactors during Phase 1, and tended to 0.10 ± 0.01 bar on day 5–6 during Phase 2, in good agreement with the high caproate specificity. Maximum P H2 (of around 0.24 bar) was observed with RA/E = 1:1.5_OC and lowest P H2 (0.03 bar) P H2 with RA/E = 1:0_OC, respectively. Jiang et al. (Yong Jiang, 2020) reported that the most suitable P H2 for caproate production was 0.10 bar. Higher P H2 will cause accumulation of n-butyrate/propionate, and increase NAD+ production (Rodríguez et al., 2010). Furthermore, excessive hydrogen in the headspace of reactors could inhibit the activity of caproate-forming bacteria (Wu et al., 2019)."
9,Carbon balance and electron recovery efficiency,"3.3 Carbon balance and electron recovery efficiency The results of carbon distributions showed that relatively large amounts of carbon losses were observed in RA/E = 1:0, with up to 45.1 % (OC) and 48.6 % (MEC) at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3C). Herein, carbon losses referred to the contents of carbon transferring to other organics except for the substrates and products, i.e., acetate, butyrate, caproate and ethanol. The underlying reason was probably that functional microorganisms in RA/E = 1:0 only relied on ED provided by bio-cathode, and the produced energy could not adequately meet the demand for caproate production (Reddy et al., 2018). The carbon recovery in organics chemicals improved to above 87.4 % in the controlled reactors employing bio-cathode and ethanol. Especially, the carbon recovery reached 98.6 ± 0.23 % in RA/E = 1:3_MEC at pH 6.0. This result indicated that most organics could be successfully detected. The calculated electron balance generally remained within the range from 88.2 ± 0.1 % to 99.1 ± 7.3 % in the controlled reactors (Fig. 3D). The ED provided by the bio-cathode constituted a small part (0.2%–1.3 %) in RA/E = 1:1.5 and RA/E = 1:3, where the electrons were mainly provided by the acetate and ethanol. In RA/E = 1:0, on the other hand, the electrons supplied by bio-cathode reached 8.0%–8.5 %, but the corresponding loss was excessively high. Therefore, RA/E = 1:0 was not considered as an ideal condition for caproate production. The electron balance of all reactors was lower than 100 % in this study, which might be due to the formation of other carbon-based products from the electron acceptors in the electrolyte during chain elongation (Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013)."
10,Electrochemical characteristics,"3.4 Electrochemical characteristics Electrochemical characteristics mainly reflect the electron transfer in the reactor. The electron transfer effect (in the reactors) increased with the improvement of electrochemical performance, which also increased the caproate yield. Stable current was generated in all MECs after five-cycle operation. The current increased dramatically and then decreased slowly, in each group (Fig. 4 A). It should be noted that the current gradually decreased with the increase of ethanol. The highest current density was 2.10 A/m2 in RA/E = 1:0, followed by 1.40 A/m2 and 1.45 A/m2 in RA/E = 1:1.5 and RA/E = 1:3 (in Phase 2), respectively. The result of CV scanning showed that the oxidation peak appearing at 0.36 V vs. SCE in RA/E = 1:3_pH 6 was from Geobacter sulfreducens (Fig. 4B), which indicated that relevant redox existed in biofilm, such as cytochromes (e.g., heme groups) participating in electron transfer (Anand et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). On the other hand, there were no obvious redox peaks observed in RA/E = 1:0 and RA/E = 1:1.5. A double-layer capacitor structure, capable of storing extra electrons, was successfully formed in all the reactors between the electrode and the biofilm. In addition, the maximum double-layer area, represented as a strong electron storage capacity, was observed in RA/E = 1:3_pH 6 with the redox current of 17.4 mA at the reduction cycle and 35.7 mA at the oxidation cycle. The results of EIS showed that the ohmic resistance (Rohm) in all reactors stayed at 3.5–4.0 Ω during Phase 2, which could be reflected by the high-frequency intercept of the X-axis in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 4C and Table S2). The diffusion resistance (Rdiff) decreased with the increase of ethanol. RA/E = 1:3_pH 6 exhibited the lowest value of 7.16 Ω, followed by RA/E = 1:1.5_pH 6 (15.3 Ω) and RA/E = 1:0_pH 6 (186.6 Ω). Previous studies have shown that lower Rdiff could accelerate the rate of electron and mass transfer between the electrode and EAB (Liu et al., 2020)."
11,Microbial community distribution and diversity analysis,"3.5 Microbial community distribution and diversity analysis The coverages of all the seven samples, i.e., inoculum, RA/E = 1:0_OC, RA/E = 1:1.5_OC, RA/E = 1:3_OC, RA/E = 1:0_MEC, RA/E = 1:1.5_MEC and RA/E = 1:3_MEC, were higher than 99 %, indicating that the sample sequencing was reasonable (Table S2). There were 191 OTUs shared among the 525 OTUs retrieved in the seven bacterial samples, accounting for 36.4 % (Fig. S3). For the groups of open and closed circuit, 246 (46.9 %) and 251 (47.8 %) OTUs were shared, respectively, but exhibiting different distributions. phyla are known to have microbial electrochemical and anaerobic fermentation. The introduction of applied voltage led to the decrease of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, while showing a noticeable increase of Actinobacteria (Fig. S3D). These three phyla had microbial electrochemical and anaerobic fermentation relevance (Jiang et al., 2020a). Most bacteria belonged to 11 classes, with a predominance of Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria (Fig. S3E). Clostridia are the most studied bacteria related to chain elongation from ethanol and acetate (Wu et al., 2018). At the genus level, Clostridium_sensu_stricto was the dominant bacterium in almost all samples; it has been widely studied and identified as dominant microbes for MCFAs production from a variety feedstocks, e.g., excess sludge (Jiang et al., 2020b), CO2 (Jiang et al., 2020a), food waste (Ma et al., 2021), etc. The relative abundances of Clostridium_ sensu_stricto in the open-circuit groups (18.3%–48.6 %) were higher than that in the closed-circuit groups (8.0%–16.4 %) (Fig. 5 ). This was mainly attributed to the inoculum, i.e., the enriched caproate-producing microbial consortium, in which Clostridium_sensu_stricto accounted for 46.5 %. Clostridium_sensu_stricto was most likely responsible for hydrogen production and organic utilization in CE process. Two well-known acetogenic bacteria were also identified, namely Acetobacterium and Acetobacter, which are able to produce acetate either through bio-conversion of H2 and CO2, or the incomplete oxidation of ethanol (Schiel-Bengelsdorf and Durre, 2012). Both genera increasingly accumulated in the closed-circuit groups, with the operation time. The relative abundances of Acetobacterium (3.3%–28.8 %) were higher than that of Acetobacter (0.9%–1.2 %). More interestingly, the proportion of Acetobacterium was higher in the open-circuit groups than that in the closed-circuit for RA/E = 1:0 and 1:1.5 groups, while an opposite phenomenon was observed for RA/E = 1:3 (6.5 % in open-circuit versus 13.8 % in closed-circuit). Interestingly, the sum of relative abundances of active fermenters, such as Aminobacterium, Cloacibacillus, Proteiniphilum, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides and Streptophyta, (Li et al., 2018a; Wüst et al., 2011), in the closed-circuit groups (12.7%–54.6 %) was higher than that in the open-circuit groups (1.9%–30.6 %). Lactobacillus, Desulfovibrio, Pseudoclavibacter and Corynebacterium being EAB, were mainly found in the closed-circuit groups and reached the highest proportion of 7.3 % in RA/E = 1:0_MEC. Desulfovibrio represented the main EABs (5.0 %) in RA/E = 1:3_MEC, which is able to grow with the cathode as the sole EA and produce H2 in the MEC system (Dessi et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021b)."
12,MENs analysis of the key microbiome,"3.6 MENs analysis of the key microbiome The overall RMT-based MENs of the open- and closed-circuit groups were divided into two distinct modules (Fig. S4). The topological properties of closed-circuit networks possessed higher averaged connectivity (8.45), shorter averaged path distance (2.87) and less modularity (0.32) (Table S3), indicating that the network of the microbiomes in the closed-circuit groups was more complex than that of open-circuit groups. The distinguishing topological properties showed the obvious differences in the interaction among microbiomes. Two OTUs subnetworks were constructed to explore the significant microbiomes interaction in the open- and closed-circuit groups (Fig. 6 ). In both subnetworks, Clostridium_sensu_stricto showed close correlation with other microbes, which was consistent with its high abundance and diverse physiologies. Positive correlations were observed between Clostridium_sensu_stricto and anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB)/acetogens. For example, Clostridium_sensu_stricto (OTU 6 and 65) were positively connected with Bacteroides (OTU 19) and Acetobacterium (OTU 2) (Fig. 6A). The same phenomenon was observed between Clostridium_sensu_stricto (OTU 39) and Acetobacter (OTU 18), as well as Clostridium_sensu_stricto (OTU 148) and Bacillus (OTU 57) (Fig. 6B). This indicated that an underlying symbiosis or analogical ecological niche was established between them. It is worth noting that positive relations were also observed between Clostridium_sensu_stricto and EAB in the closed-circuit subnetwork. Desulfovibrio (OTU 50) was positively related to Clostridium_sensu_stricto (OTU 25), the same holds true for Lactobacillus (OTU 340) and Clostridium_sensu_stricto (OTU 148). This indicated underlying cooperative relationships between them. That is, the EDs, directly or indirectly derived from the EAB/cathode and provided by ethanol, was beneficial for the promotion of the CE process, which was mediated by a phylogenetically diverse microbial consortia."
13,Conclusions,"This work explored the effect of multiple EDs, derived from the bio-cathode and the externally added ethanol, on the caproate production, in a series of single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells. Caproate concentration showed a rising trend with the increase of ethanol and peaked at 7454 mg COD/L in RA/E = 1:3_MEC, where the bio-cathode contributed with a 10.7%–26.1 % increase. The results of caproate specificity and P H2 showed that the coexistence of ethanol and the bio-cathode promoted the shift of product spectrum towards caproate. MiSeq sequencing revealed that the bioelectrochemical ethanol-driven CE process was mediated by a phylogenetically diverse microbial consortium, with Clostridium_sensu_stricto predominating. Clostridium_sensu_stricto was widely identified as dominant microbes for MCFAs production and showing positive correlations with other functional consortia, e.g., acetogens, EAB, and other fermenters. The findings provide a proof-of-concept for the application of EF, mediated by multiple EDs, on MCFAs production."
