0,Introduction,"CO2 emissions due to extensive use of fossil fuels result in global warming and search for alternative fuels is in the priority list of most nations' agenda [1]. The hydrogen is considered as one of the best alternative to fossil fuels. It has high energy content per unit weight of 122kJ/g which is almost three times that of hydrocarbon and its combustion product contains only water and no CO2. It is preferred to biogas or methane because hydrogen is not chemically bound to carbon, and therefore, burning does not contribute to greenhouse gases or acid rain [2]. However, hydrogen is currently produced mainly from natural gas, a finite resource, through steam reforming, a process that generates large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a principal cause of global warming. Biological hydrogen production processes are environment friendly and less energy intensive compared to chemical processes and it is more attractive if carbohydrate rich organic wastes and wastewater are used as cheap substrate. Among the various bio-hydrogen production methods such as direct biophotolysis and indirect biophotolysis, use of dark fermentation and photo fermentation sequentially (so called two-stage biological hydrogen production) seems to be promising method to improve H2 yield. In the first step of two-stage process, complex carbohydrates are converted to organic acids, alcohols, H2 and CO2 by anaerobic fermentative bacteria (Clostridium sp, mix consortium taken from soil, anaerobic waste treatment sludge and compost). In the second stage, the organic acids are further fermented by the photo-heterotrophic bacteria (e.g. Rhodobacter sp., Rhodopseudomonas sp.) to produce more H2. The highest theoretical yield that can be achieved through combination of dark and photo fermentation is 12mol H2 per mol glucose [3–5]. There are reports in literature in which various wastewater types were used for two-stage biohydrogen production purpose. For example, Lee et al. [6] studied photo-fermentative hydrogen production using an effluent from dark fermentation stage. Fascetti et al. [7] combined dark fermentation and photo fermentation to improve H2 production using municipal solid wastes. Eroglu et al. [8] reported two-stage hydrogen production from olive mill wastewater. The type and concentration of organic acids are usually the most critical factors affecting the cell growth and biohydrogen production [9–13]. In the second stage, organic acid concentration around 2000mg/l was reported to be the most suitable for hydrogen production by Rhodobacter species [5,14]. Acetate and butyrate would be the major organic acids, which are the predominant soluble metabolites from dark fermentation on carbohydrates. It is well known that photosynthetic bacteria can convert acetate and butyrate to hydrogen [10]. Therefore, photofermentative hydrogen production could be coupled with dark fermentation to achieve a higher overall H2 yield. Chen et al [15] combined dark fermentation by using sucrose as a substrate with photo fermentation, and they achieved overall H2 yield 10.02mol H2/mol sucrose. Su et al. [16] reported hydrogen yield of 1.59 and 1.72mol H2/mol glucose using Clostridium butyricum as an inoculum and glucose as substrate in dark fermentation. On the other hand, when they combined dark fermentation with photo fermentation, hydrogen yield between 1.59 and 5.48mol H2/mol glucose hydrogen yield was achieved. Some researchers employed pure forms of volatile fatty acids as the sole substrate for photo fermentation step [10,14,17–19], whereas very limited information is available on the use of effluent from dark fermentation and the two-stage biohydrogen production from cheese whey wastewater [20,21]. In photosynthetic hydrogen production, H2 production is driven by nitrogenase activity, which simultaneously converts molecular nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), thus, H2-producing activity of photo-fermentative bacteria is strongly inhibited by an excessive amount of nitrogen [11]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modifying the effluent characteristics of first-stage (feed into photo fermentation stage) via lowering the nitrogen and volatile fatty acid content of feed, adding extra l-malic acid into the feed on the hydrogen production performance of photo fermentation stage (second stage) using Rhodopseudomonas palustris."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture conditions,"2.1 Microorganism and culture conditions R. palustris (DSM 127) used in this study was obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). The bacteria was grown in 500ml serum bottle containing growth medium, which composed of 1g/l l-malic acid as carbon source, 1.69g/l sodium glutamate as nitrogen source, 3g/l KH2PO4, 0.5g/l MgSO47H2O, 0.0037g/l CaCl2, 1ml vitamin solution (0.5g/l thiamine chloride hydrochloride, 0.015g/l biotin, 0.5g/l nicotinic acid), 0.1ml x50 ferric citrate (50g/l) and 1ml trace element solution. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2: 70; MnCl24H2O: 100; H3BO3: 60; CoCl26H2O: 60; CuCl22H2O: 200; NiCl26H2O: 20; Na2Mo42H2O: 40; HCl (%25 v/v): 1ml. The growth medium composition was kindly provided by Professor Inci Eroglu (Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey). The initial pH of medium was adjusted pH 6.5 with 1N NaOH. The headspace of serum bottle was flushed by argon at least 3 min to provide anaerobic conditions, and then bottle was tightly capped with butyl rubber stopper and aluminum cap. The serum bottle was placed on reciprocal shaker in climatic room at 31°C, under illumination with 150W metal halide lamp (6000lux). After 48h incubation time, the bacterium was used for hydrogen production experiments."
3,Experimental setup and procedure,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedure Dark fermentation effluent was obtained from a thermophilic (55°C) CSTR reactor (The working volume was 1l) operating in continuous mode. The inoculum required to operate this acidogenic anaerobic bioreactor was as follows: anaerobic mixed microflora acquired from an operating field scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used as parent inoculum for producing H2 after pretreatment as follows; dewatered anaerobic sludge (pH: 7.5; SS: 100g/L) was subjected to heat-shock pretreatment at 85°C for 45min to enrich H2 producers but to deactivate the hydrogentrophic methanogens. Cheese whey (CW) was also subjected to heat treatment at 85°C for 30min to eliminate lactic acid bacteria, which may inhibit the biohydrogen production. The operating parameters of reactor were as follows; organic loading rate (OLR): 30g COD/l/day and hydraulic retention time (HRT): 24h. The effluent of reactor was collected and mixed during 5 days to have sufficient volume to be used in photo fermentation experiments. Then, the effluent was centrifuged at 5000rpm for 10min and filtered to remove all solids including biomass coming from dark fermentation effluent. The clear supernatant was used for feeding in the photo fermentation experiments. Batch photo-fermentative hydrogen production experiments with R. palustris were conducted in 250ml serum bottles in duplicates. The working volume throughout the study was 200ml with a headspace of 50ml. Effluent form the dark fermentation reactor was either used as it is (no dilution) or diluted at varying ratios such as 1/2, 1/5, 1/10 (etc; 1/5: 1 volume effluent/4 volume distilled water) using distilled water. In the second part of the study, l-malic acid at varying amounts was added into the hydrogen production medium in order to have l-malic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 4g/l. Raw and previously diluted mediums with or without l-malic acid additions were also tested for comparison purpose (as controls) (see Table 1 ). Prior to the hydrogen production experiments, all samples were subjected to pH adjustment, (pH 6.9) and sterilization by autoclave at 121°C for 15min. The amount of inoculation to the bioreactors was 10% by volume of the fresh medium. Batch photo fermentation reactors were incubated in a temperature controlled room at 31°C under illumination 150W metal halide lamp. The light intensity on outer surface of reactors was approximately 6000lux. The headspace of the serum bottles were flushed by Argon gas for at least 3min to provide anaerobic conditions. The hydrogen gas produced by the bacteria was collected from the top of the reactors by a thin hollow tube into a graded glass burette initially filled with water which was replaced by the hydrogen and CO2 produced during the process and the gas content was analyzed for hydrogen by Gas Chromatograph (GC)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured according to the standard methods [22]. Total nitrogen was measured with MERK 14 555 (N, 10–150mg/L) test kits. The effluent pH was measured with WTW pH meter. Volatile fatty acids (acetate, propiyonat, butyrate, iso-butyrate) in the mixed liquor were analyzed using a GC (6890N Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector and DB-FFAP 30m×0,32mm×0,25mm capillary column (J&W Scientific) The initial temperature of the column was 40°C for 3min followed with a ramp of 20°C/min to 60°C for 3min and then increased at 30°C/min to 120°C for 4min and reach a final temperature with ramp of 30°C/min to 240°C for 6min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were both 240°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at constant pressure of 103kPa. Lactic acid and malic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC (Shimadzu) equipped with UV–vis (SPD10A) detector (210nm) using 150 mm*4.6mm Prevail Organic Acid 5U (GRACE) column. 0.025M KH2PO4 (pH=2.5) was used in mobile phase at a flow rate 0.8ml/min. Mixed liquor sample of 1.5ml was first acidified with phosphoric acid and then filtered through 0.2μm membrane before analyzed. The H2 content in graduated-glass burette was analyzed everyday by gas chromatography (GC) (6890N Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and Hayesep D 80/100 packed column. Injector, detector and column temperatures were kept at 120°C, 140°C, and 35°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min."
5,Kinetic parameters,"2.4 Kinetic parameters The modified Gompertz equation (Eq (1)) was used to estimate the model parameters for describing the progress of cumulative H2 production obtained from batch experiments [23]. (1) H = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } In Eq. (1), H is cumulative hydrogen production (ml), P is the hydrogen production potential (ml), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/day), λ is lag phase time (day) and e is constant (2.718281828). The values of P, Rm and λ for each batch were determined by best fitting the hydrogen production data for Eq. (1) using regression analysis."
6,Results and discussion,"An acidogenic reactor effluent, so called dark fermentation effluent, was continuously used for photo-fermentative hydrogen production by R. palustris (DSM127) throughout the study. Operating conditions in this acidogenic anaerobic bioreactor (dark fermentation) was T: 55°C, OLR: 30g COD/l/day, HRT: 24h and pH: 5.5. The pH, COD and total nitrogen content of effluent were 5.5, 28g/l and 138mg/l, respectively. Hydrogen production yield of thermophilic CSTR reactor was 2.5–5.0l H2/lreactor/day on the average corresponding to 1.8–5.1moles of H2/mol lactose consumed and hydrogen content of its biogas composition was %40-60. Effluent from the dark fermentation reactor was either used as it is (no dilution) or diluted at varying ratios such as 1/2, 1/5, 1/10 using distilled water. In the second part of the study, l-malic acid at varying amounts was added into the hydrogen production medium in order to have l-malic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 4g/l in stock solution. The batch photo fermentation experiments were carried out until the bio-hydrogen production ceased (aprox. 528h). Fig. 1 depicts the cumulative hydrogen formation for R. palustris fed by either diluted or non-diluted effluent. In addition, a control experiment using only 4g/l l-malic acid as feed material was used. The highest cumulative hydrogen formation were obtained from 4g/l l-malic acid (253ml), 1/2 diluted effluent (247ml) and 1/5 diluted effluent (235ml) containing reactors, respectively. On the other hand, cumulative hydrogen production of 1/10 diluted effluent containing reactor (76ml) was lower than the other diluted reactors. This result may due to lower organic acid concentration, which is a required carbon source of R. palustris. The lowest cumulative hydrogen production (66ml) was measured when the effluent from dark fermentative reactor (first stage) was not diluted. This finding is in parallel with some literature data that reports the inhibition of hydrogen production caused by high organic acid and ammonium concentrations in the feed [5,11,14]. Volatile fatty acid concentrations (VFAs) in anaerobic effluent (feed for second stage) and residual VFAs after photo fermentation reaction completed are given in Table 2 . The main organic acids determined in the anaerobic acidogenic reactor effluent were lactate, n-butyrate and acetate as seen in Table 2, respectively. According to the Table 2, almost all butyrate and propionate were consumed during the second stage (photo fermentation) and also significant amount of consumption for acetate, lactate and l-malic acid was observed. Cumulative hydrogen productions from all batch experiments were correlated with Gompertz equation and related model constants were determined by regression analysis. Table 3 shows the constants of Gompertz equation. According to this equation the highest cumulative hydrogen production (418ml) and production rate (38ml/day) was obtained for Run 8. In the second part of study, l-malic acid at varying amounts was added into the hydrogen production medium in order to have l-malic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 4g/l. As given in Tables 3 and 4 , the highest hydrogen production was achieved when l-malic acid was used as a sole substrate. This indicates the affinity of the R. palustris over l-malic acid. Carlozzi and Lambardi [24] also reported that the hydrogen production rate of R. palustris with malic acid as carbon source was higher than with acetic acid alone. Therefore, it was decided to add l-malic acid in varying amounts into the anaerobic effluent in order to increase the hydrogen production (Table 4 and Fig. 2 ). According to this results, the best hydrogen production for raw effluent (with no l-malic acid addition) was obtained when the effluent was diluted at a ratio of 1/5. If this run is taken into account for l-malic acid addition, a mixture of 50% l-malic acid and 50% raw effluent provides the best hydrogen production amount (349ml H2/gCODadded). Even though the highest hydrogen production value in Table 4 is 380ml H2/gCODadded, this run requires at least 75% l-malic acid addition into the hydrogen media to reach to this value. The results indicated that effluent from anaerobic dark fermentative reactor (first stage) should be diluted and l-malic acid should be added before feeding into photo fermentation reactor. In regards to the relationship between final pH and the hydrogen production yields, pH 5 (Run1) represents the experiment (H2 production yield: 13ml H2/gCODadded) in which raw effluent without any dilution or l-malic acid addition, on the other hand, pH 8.3 (Run5- H2 production yield: 438ml H2/gCODadded) represents only l-malic acid addition as a sole carbon source. If we look at the other experiment which has a pH of 5.1 (Run 6- H2 production yield: 92ml H2/gCODadded), we see that there is a significant improvement in H2 production which might be attributed to the dilution effect. This becomes even more clear as the dilutions and l-malic acid additions are increased. Final pH's also indicates a good buffering capacity and better H2 production (Table 2)."
7,Conclusions,"It was found that, undiluted raw cheese whey wastewater effluent from dark hydrogen production reactor was not suitable for photo-fermentative hydrogen production. Overall hydrogen production performance of two-stage system was found to vary between 2 and 10moles H2/moles of lactose consumed. It was concluded that the dilution of anaerobic effluent helps to reduce the nitrogen (interfering with nitrogenase enzyme) and the volatile fatty acid content in the feeding that might be otherwise harmful to the photo-heterotrophic organism. Second conclusion that can be drawn is that cheese whey effluent should be mixed with a co-substrate containing l-malic acid such as apple juice processing effluent before fed into the photo fermentation reactor. In addition to the above conclusions, the general conclusion are given below; R. palustris was able to grow on fermentation waste (after pH adjustment), simultaneously removing organic components and neutralizing the pH. The repressability of nitrogenase is a common bottleneck in photobiological H2 production, which may be overcome by the use of: □ denitrification methods: Alternatively, ion exchange could potentially remove NH4 + with some selectivity, but either approach would add significant process costs. □ a two-part photobioreactor where ammonia is consumed for growth in the first reactor and H2 production follows in the nitrogen-limited second reactor. Wild-type bacterial strains could be employed in this approach, but process costs would be increased as compared to those for a single reactor arrangement. □ nitrogenase-depressed mutants, which exhibit nitrogenase expression in the presence of fixed nitrogen. Although industry is often reluctant to accept engineered strains, this approach could offer the efficient photo-production of H2 from a nitrogenous feed [23,24]. The need for neutralization would introduce an extra cost in large-scale photo-fermentative hydrogen production. Further work is required to achieve acid-tolerant remediation of fermentation effluent."
