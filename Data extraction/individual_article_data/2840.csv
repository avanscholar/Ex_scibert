0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting has been considered the sustainable energy conversion and storage technology, which could prevent and mitigate the rising threats of global pollution and fossil fuel exhaustion. [1–4] Pt-group metals have been adopted as the most effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the optimal hydrogen absorption. However, their high costs and earth scarcity have become the major barrier for their commercial application. [5,6] Thus, extensive efforts have been made to develop cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts, especially the Mo-based catalysts. [7–9] Among them, molybdenum phosphide (MoP), with a stable hexagonal crystal structure (space group: P-6 m2) where Mo3+ is bonded to six equivalent P3− atoms to form face-sharing MoP6 pentagonal pyramids, has been widely investigated as a potential HER electrocatalyst due to its intrinsic catalytic activity, high thermal stability, and cost efficiency (Fig. S1). [10–12] Despite great efforts to optimize the catalytic activity of MoP-based electrocatalysts, there would still be considerable room for the improvement in the HER activity through morphology modification and atomic engineering. Generally, an ideal HER electrocatalyst with high HER activity should have the following characteristics: (i) to expose the high density of catalytically active sites; (ii) to facilitate the electron transfer and the mass transport; (iii) to optimize the adsorption/desorption strength of intermediates. In order to reach these targets, interface construction and porosity engineering are frequently proposed to tailor the structure and morphology of MoP-based electrocatalysts to enhance HER performance. [13–15] As a typical example, an interface between MoS2 and MoP was constructed by the partial substitution of S by P in MoS2, which would lead to an enhanced HER catalytic performance. [15] Interface engineering could tune catalytic properties through promoting electron mobility and moderating the adsorption/desorption energies of reaction intermediates. [16,17] Shen and his co-workers fabricated porous MoP nanoflakes through phosphorization treatment of MoO2 nanoflakes hydrothermally grown on Ni foam. [12] Hole engineering would expose more active sites with a lower coordination number and allow fast access to electrolytes and efficient mass transport, thereby boosting the HER activity. [18,19] On the other hand, the 2D layered nanomaterials with large lateral size had great potential for obtaining high concentration of exposed active sites because of their large specific surface area and tunable lattice plane. Nevertheless, the irreversible restacking during the layered electrode fabrication would reduce the electrochemical active area and lengthen the electrolyte diffusion path. [20–22] Hence, controllable construction of nanosized holes and interfaces on 2D catalysts while introducing more catalytic sites and continuous mass/charge transport pathway would be an effective strategy for developing electrocatalysts with high HER performance. Previous researches have reported that ultrathin MoO2 nanosheets with surface unsaturated atoms and metallic conductivity could be served as the template to synthesize porous N-doped Mo2C nanosheets for HER. [23] Compared with carbon, phosphorus possesses appropriate characteristics with larger atomic size and lower electronegativity, making it a promising candidate for replacing oxygen to construct the interface between MoP and MoO2 domains. [24] Our calculations showed that the MoP (100) could be well grown on MoO2 (200) along the [200] direction with small interfacial strain (0.87%), verifying the feasibility of interfacial engineering of MoP and MoO2 (Fig. S2). Furthermore, the surface energy of MoP (100) (0.170 eV Å−2) was lower than that of MoO2 (200) (0.187 eV Å−2). Importantly, the interfacial energy of MoP (100) / MoO2 (200) was calculated to be −0.202 eV Å−2, suggesting that the heterostructure is exothermic, thereby favoring the interface formation and facilitating the catalytic reaction (Fig. S3). Based on these findings, we presented a facile PH3 and H2 vapor-assisted strategy to synthesize 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets with tunable phase for efficient HER catalysis. With the temperature elevation, the surface unsaturated O atoms in MoO2 nanosheet precursor were gradually replaced by P atoms from PH3 vapor, generating the P-doped MoO2 (P-MoO2), MoP/MoO2 heterojunction and pure MoP nanosheets under the temperature of 600, 700, and 800 °C, respectively (Scheme 1 ). Remarkably, compared with 2D MoO2, P-MoO2 and pure MoP nanosheets, the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets exhibited better HER activity as well as high durability in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The images from the atomic force microscopy and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly demonstrated that the heterostructure nanosheets were around 1.1 nm thick and possessed plentiful pores. Density functional theory calculations revealed that both P and Mo sites on the pore wall of nanosheets at the interface region are mainly reaction centers for optimizing the hydrogen binding energy and reducing the activation barrier."
1,Experimental section,
2,Reagents and chemicals,"2.1 Reagents and chemicals The commercial MoO3 powder (≥99.5%), Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2·H2O,≥99%), and platinum on graphitized carbon (20% Pt/C) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Carbon paper was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric. Co. Ltd., China. Ultrapure water produced by a Milli-Q system was used throughout the experiment."
3,Synthesis of the 2D MoO2 nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of the 2D MoO2 nanosheets The 2D MoO2 nanosheets were prepared via chemical vapor deposition process according to a previously reported method with only a slight modification. [25] In a typical synthetic procedure, the commercial MoO3 powders were loaded into a quartz boat, which was then placed in the tubular furnace. The chemical vapor reduction process was performed in the mixed gases (5% H2 − 95% Ar, 200 sccm) at 900 °C for 60 min. The solid-state MoO3 powders could be sublimated at the high temperature of 900 °C and then the gaseous MoO3 was reduced to MoO2 by a gas mixture of Ar-H2, followed by depositing onto the end of the tube wall layer-by-layer at room temperature.[23] After that, the 2D MoO2 nanosheets were acquired and collected at the tail end of the quartz tube."
4,Synthesis of the 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets,"2.3 Synthesis of the 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets The 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets were prepared via a phosphorization method using 2D MoO2 nanosheets as the precursor. The MoO2 nanosheets and 1 g of NaH2PO2 put respectively into a quartz boat were placed at two separate positions of the tubular furnace with NaH2PO2 at the upstream side. After the system filled with pure H2 atmosphere, the MoO2 nanosheets were heated up to 700 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1 under a flowing pure H2 atmosphere (flow rate, 10 sccm). Meanwhile, the NaH2PO2 was heated up to 300 °C within 35 min. Subsequently, the system was held at this temperature for 90 min, followed by naturally cooling to the room temperature. The synthesis procedure of 2D P-doped MoO2 or MoP nanosheets was similar with that of 2D MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets, except that the phosphorization temperature was adjusted to 600 or 800 °C, respectively."
5,Structural characterization,"2.4 Structural characterization Phase compositions were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (PANalytical Inc.) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) with a fixed slit. Morphology of samples were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE‑SEM, Hitachi, Japan). The evolved gases during HER were quantified by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Information on the lattice spacing of the materials was obtained using a high‑resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) equipped with an X‑ray energy‑dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (JEM‑2100F, JEOL, Japan). Nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distribution analysis were performed twice using an ASAP 2020 instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The average specific surface area was obtianed with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. X‑ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were also performed with a PHI5000 Versa Probe system, and all the spectra were calibrated against reference of C1s peak at 284.8 eV."
6,Electrochemical measurement,"2.5 Electrochemical measurement Electrochemical measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (Gamry) using a standard three‑electrode setup in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1.0 M KOH electrolytes in a two-compartment cell, which was separated by Nafion 211 membrane. Graphite carbon rod and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 1 mg catalyst into alcohol solution (100 μL) along with 5 wt% of Nafion solution (10 μL) and sonicated for 30 min to form a uniformly dispersed solution. Carbon paper was pretreated in concentrated H2SO4 for 6 h, and then cleaned by sonication sequentially in ethanol and ultrapure water for several times to remove surface impurities. Then, the ink solution containing 0.5 mg of catalyst was drop-casted onto the pretreated carbon paper electrode (1 × 1 cm2) and dried naturally. All the potentials measured were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.200 V. Before linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was conducted at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, the working electrodes were scanned for several cyclic voltammetry cycles until a stable cyclic voltammetry was obtained to verify the reproducibility and accuracy of electrochemical measurements. All the HER polarization curves were measured with 95% iR-drop compensation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of samples were carried out at η = 50 mV by using the experimental apparatus in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with AC amplitude of 5 mV. Chronopotentiometric measurement was conducted under the same apparatus with 95% iR-drop compensation. The cyclic voltammetry tests with 1000 cycles were performed at the potential window from + 0.1 to − 0.2 V vs. RHE for HER with the scan rates of 100 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to estimate the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at non-faradaic potentials by plotting the capacitive currents (ΔJ, Janodic - Jcathodic) against the scan rate and following with a linear fit. The Cdl as half of the slope can be further converted into the effective electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) using the specific capacitance value for a standard with 1 cm2 of real surface area (Cs). The Cs for a flat surface is normally between 0.02 and 0.06 mF cm−2. The average value of 0.04 mF cm−2 was adopted to calculate the ECSA as Cdl/Cs."
7,Density functional theory calculation,"2.6 Density functional theory calculation The MoO2(011), P doped MoO2(011), MoP (100), MoP(100)/MoO2(200), MoP (100)-hole, MoP(100)/MoO2(200)-hole surfaces were built, and the vacuum space along the z direction was set to be 15 Å, which was enough to avoid interaction between two neighboring images. The P and Mo activity sites were considered. Each atom in the storage models was allowed to relax to the minimum in the enthalpy without constraints. Besides, the H atom has absorbed on the surface of these materials. First-principles calculations in the framework of density functional theory including structural and electronic performances were carried out using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package known as CASTEP. [26] Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange–correlation functional with norm-conserving pseudopotentials and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional was adopted to describe the electron–electron interaction. [27] An energy cutoff of 750 eV was applied and a k-point sampling of 5 × 5 × 1 were was deemed to be converged. A force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å −1, energy tolerance of 5.0 × 10−7eV per atom and maximum displacement of 5.0 × 10−4 Å were considered. Adsorption energy ΔE of H atom on the surface of substrates was defined as: (1) Δ E = E ∗ H - - E ∗ + E H where *H and * denote the adsorption of H atom on substrates and the bare substrates, E H denotes the half of energy of H2. Free energy change ΔG of the reaction was calculated as the difference between the free energies of the initial and final states and shown as below: (2) Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E - - T Δ S where E is the calculated energy by DFT, ZPE is the zero-point energy, S denotes the entropy. The value of (ΔZPE- TΔS) is 0.26 eV. [28] So ΔG = ΔE + 0.26 eV. The surface energy ΔEsurf and interface energy ΔEinter were calculated: (3) Δ E surf = E surf - - E bulk / 2 A (4) Δ E int e r = E int e r - E surf - A - E surf - B / A where A denotes the surface area of systems. Esurf, Ebulk and Einter are the energies of surface, bulk and interface systems. Esurf-A and Esurf-B denote the energies of surface A and surface B."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization The fabrication procedure of the P-MoO2, MoP/MoO2 heterojunction and pure MoP nanosheets was schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. The regular hexagonal MoO2 nanosheets were firstly obtained on a large scale by annealing MoO3 powders at 900 °C in Ar-H2 atmosphere, as previously reported. [29,30] Then, a high-temperature phosphorization reaction in pure H2 atmosphere was carried out to transform the MoO2 into designed Mo-P products with NaH2PO2 as a phosphorus source. The PH3 gas decomposed from NaH2PO2 at low-temperature region (300 °C) was brought to the precursor surface by H2 gas flow. [31,32] The phosphorization process could be described as below: 2MoO2 + 2PH3 + H2 → 2MoP + 4H2O. The P doped MoO2, MoP/MoO2 heterojunction and pure MoP nanosheets could be acquired at 600, 700 and 800 °C, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to investigate the morphological structure of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 1 a showed the smooth and intact surface of the MoO2 nanosheets. Similar with other 2D nanosheets, some wrinkles were found on the MoO2 nanosheets due to surface tension. In addition, several pieces of MoO2 nanosheets featured thin lamellar structure and overlaid together, being transparent to an electron beam. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of MoO2 nanosheets displayed that the well-defined lattice fringes with a spacing of ∼ 0.34 nm matched well with the (011) plane of MoO2 (Fig. 1 b). The single set of diffraction spots from the selected area electron diffraction pattern clearly indicated the monocrystal nature of MoO2 nanosheet (Fig. S4a). Besides, the homogeneity of the MoO2 nanosheets was reflected by the TEM elemental mapping, in which both Mo and O elements displayed even distribution (Fig. S4b). After a high-temperature phosphorization (600 °C), the nanosheets still maintained its 2D ultrathin feature and displayed the clear lattice fringes, except that its surface became rough and slightly holey (Fig. 1 c-d). These holes were getting denser and more distinct as the temperature increased to 700 °C, while the ultrathin morphology was well preserved (Fig. S5). The dash cycles further revealed the apparent porous structure on the nanosheets surface with mesopores size of 10–20 nm (Fig. 1 e). These mesopores of the nanosheets would not only favor to the exposure of additional active sites on the edge, but also facilitate mass transport between reaction sites and reactants, thereby greatly improving the catalytic activity. Fig. 1 f revealed the presence of nanointerface that explicitly discerned two phases with different crystal structures, confirming the construction of heterostructure. The two sets of lattice fringe with interplanar spacings of 0.24 and 0.28 nm well corresponded to the (200) plane of MoO2 and (100) plane of MoP, respectively (Fig. 1 f). The bright-dark pattern might be associated with the level of electron density. The phase with a higher electron density means a closely packed MoP structure, while the darker area reveals a sparsely packed and loosen MoO2 structure filled with smaller oxygen atoms. [33] The corresponding elemental mapping results further verified its uniform spatial distribution along with the atomic ratio of Mo, O and P constituents nearly as 4.8:9.7:1.5 (Fig. 1 g and S6a). When further increasing the temperature to 800 °C, the obtained nanosheets with convex-concave surface were composed of numerous stacked nanosized particles without obvious aggregation (Fig. 1 i). This phenomenon might be attributed to the transformation stress of the nanosheet structure during the transition of monoclinic MoO2 to hexagonal MoP. The (001) and (100) lattice fringes of MoP were identified by HRTEM (Fig. 1 j). The elemental mapping analysis of MoP revealed the uniform distribution of Mo and P constituents with atomic ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 (Fig. 1 k and S6b). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images displayed that the average thicknesses of MoO2, MoP/MoO2 and MoP nanosheets were around 1.0, 1.1, and 1.4 nm, respectively, further confirming their few-layered structures (Fig. S7, 1 h and 1 m). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms analysis demonstrated that the MoP/MoO2 possessed the specific surface area of 23.9 ± 0.2 m2 g−1, much larger than that of MoP (18.2 ± 0.3 m2 g−1) (Fig. S8). In addition, the pore size analysis illustrated that these materials were consisted of mesopores with the size distribution of 2–20 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to detect the crystal structure of these nanosheets. As depicted in Fig. 2 a, the diffraction peaks could be well indexed to the monoclinic MoO2 (space group: P21/c; a = 5.611 Å, b = 4.856 Å, c = 5.628 Å, PDF# 73–1249). The XRD pattern of P-MoO2 revealed that it was well inherited from MoO2 without the formation of new MoP phase. In contrast, new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.9, 32.2, 43.1, and 57.5°, corresponding to the (001), (100), (101), and (110) crystal facets of hexagonal MoP phase (space group: P-6 m2; a = b = 3.222 Å, c = 3.191 Å, PDF# 24–0771), respectively, were observed from XRD pattern of MoP/MoO2, implying the formation of MoP/MoO2 heterojunction. As for that of MoP, the characteristic peaks belonging to (001), (100), (101), and (110) crystal facets of the hexagonal MoP were detected, while the MoO2 peaks disappeared, suggesting the complete conversion of MoO2 to MoP. These results were consistent with the observations of the lattice constant variation under HRTEM. The typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images further revealed the porous features on the surface of the phosphorized nanosheets, differently with the smooth morphology of pure MoO2 nanosheets (Fig. 2 b-d). The commercial MoO3 with orthorhombic structure presented the random particles with the size range from a few micrometers to tens of micrometers (Fig. S9). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to investigate the surface composition and chemical nature of the obtained nanosheets. For Mo 3d XPS spectrum, the peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo4+ at 229.6 eV and 232.7 eV were detected from 2D MoO2 nanosheets, and the two doublets at 231.1 eV and 235.0 eV were assigned to Mo6+ species due to the oxidation of Mo4+ in air (Fig. 2 e). [34] The difference of the Mo4+ peak area between MoO2 and P-MoO2 suggested the incorporation of foreign P atom caused significant modulation in the electronic structure of MoO2. With the phosphorization temperature increasing from 600 to 800 °C, the peak intensities at 129.1 eV and 130.0 eV belonging to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 of metal phosphide exhibited a growing trend, suggesting the structural evolution from P-MoO2 to MoP/MoO2 and then pure MoP (Fig. 2 f). [35] Accordingly, the binding energy peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 emerged at 228.4 eV and 231.3 eV, respectively, suggesting the existence of Moδ+ (0 < δ ≤ 4) cations that was ascribed to MoP in MoP/MoO2 and MoP (Fig. 2 e). [11] Notably, Mo4+ and Mo6+ species were derived from molybdenum oxide on the surface of pure MoP due to air exposure. The electron redistribution of MoO2/MoP heterojunction uncovered by the shifts of the peak sites in MoP/MoO2 catalyst in comparison with those of MoO2 and MoP would be helpful for the occurrence of the HER, which was in agreement with the previous research. [15]"
10,Electrocatalytic performance for HER,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for HER The electrocatalytic HER activities of the as-synthesized nanosheets were evaluated by using a standard three-electrode setup at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1.0 M KOH solutions. The loading mass of the catalysts drop-casted on carbon paper working electrode was kept constant as 0.5 mg cm−2. Fig. 3 a showed the 95% iR-corrected polarization curves of the Mo-based nanosheets catalysts, as well as 20% Pt/C known to be the best HER catalyst. In the acidic aqueous electrolytes, the MoO2 nanosheets possessed the HER performance with an overpotential over 498 ± 2 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2. After phosphorization treatment, the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction exhibited significant improvement in the HER performance with a low overpotential of 90 ± 1 and 150 ± 1 mV to reach the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. In contrast, pure MoP electrocatalyst presented inferior electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 194 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and P-MoO2 electrocatalyst displayed poor HER performance with an overpotential over 326 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Fortunately, the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction still owned a better activity toward HER than the other Mo-based catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. The overpotential corresponding to current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 was 79 ± 1 and 114 ± 1 mV for MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst, respectively, which was comparable to the MoP-based HER catalysts reported in recent studies. [10,36–39] Moreover, the cycling test was conducted to examine the long-term stability of MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. The polarization curves demonstrated that there was only subtle difference after 1000 cycles, indicating its good durability of this catalyst in long-term electrochemical process. As an inherent property of the electrocatalyst, the Tafel slope determined by the rate-limiting step of the HER could be used to evaluate the HER kinetics and elucidate the HER mechanism. According to the previous reports, the mechanism of acidic HER process could be considered as a combination of three basic steps including: (1) Volmer reaction with a slope of 118 mV dec−1; H3O+ + e− + * → H* + H2O; (2) Heyrovsky reaction for the electrochemical hydrogen desorption (40 mV dec−1): H* + H3O+ + e− → H2 + H2O, or (3) Tafel reaction for the chemical desorption (30 mV dec−1): H* + H* → H2 + * , where H* represents a H atom bound to an active site. [40,41] The Tafel slope of MoP/MoO2 heterojunction in 0.5 M H2SO5 was 60 mV dec−1, much lower than those of MoP (115 mV dec−1), P-MoO2 (142 mV dec−1) and MoO2 catalysts (256 mV dec−1), indicating the accelerated Volmer kinetics and Volmer-Heyrovsky HER mechanism (Fig. 3 b). In accordance with the order of alkaline HER activity, the MoP/MoO2 heterojunction also exhibited the smallest Tafel slope among the Mo-based electrocatalysts (Fig. 3 b). In order to probe the difference in HER performance of the catalysts, the effective electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by measuring the electrochemical double‑layer capacitance (Cdl). [42] Capacitive current from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was plotted as a function of scan rate to extract the Cdl as the half of the slope (Fig. S10 and S11). The Cdl values of MoP, MoP/MoO2, P-MoO2 and MoO2 electrocatalysts in acidic solution were calculated to be 8.9, 14.8, 4.5 and 2.85 mF cm−2, respectively, corresponding to the ECSA values of 222.5, 370, 112.5, 71.25 cm2 (Fig. 3 c). The largest values of Cdl (11.1 mF cm−2) and ECSA (277.5 cm2) in MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst were also obtained in 1.0 M KOH and shown in Fig. S11. This suggested that the introduction of interfaces and holes in the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction could create more accessible active centers. The geometric current densities were then normalized to ECSA in order to compare the intrinsic activity of these catalysts. The MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst displayed the highest current density at low overpotential among the Mo-based materials (Fig. S12). It should be noted that turnover frequency (TOF) can reflect the intrinsic activity of catalysts, but it is hard to be precisely calculated for these Mo-based electrocatalysts because catalytically active surface area and active sites cannot be accurately determined. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed to get insight into the electron transfer at the interface region between electrocatalysts and electrolytes. The charge transfer across the catalyst/electrolyte interfaces is strongly correlated with the electrode kinetics. [43] The Nyquist plots can be well simulated using a simplified circuit model that was composed of electrolyte resistance (Rs), a constant phase element (CPE) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) [41]. CPE is a capacitive impedance with a frequency-independent negative phase, which is often used in the simulated circuit because of the nonuniform distribution of surface charge and rough surface in a real electrode. The impedance of a CPE is given by the following equation: ZCPE = 1/Q(jω)α, Where Q is the CPE element, α is the CPE coefficient, ω is the angular frequency.[44,45] Notably, the value α = 1 gives an ordinary capacitor, α = 0 is a resistor, and α = 0.5 corresponds to the Warburg element used to model diffusion.[45,46] The corresponding analog impedance diagram as a typical Randle circuit was displayed in the inset of Fig. 3 d. The fitted results were shown in Table S1. The origin of its deviation from unity was possibly attributed to the absorption layer on the surface of the electrode, the uneven surface of the electrode and the conductivity of the electrolytes, reflecting the properties of the double layer deviating from the ideal capacitance.[46] The Rct of 5.1 ± 0.8 and 3.3 ± 0.1 O were obtained for MoP/MoO2 heterojunction in the acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, which were much smaller than those of other Mo-based electrocatalysts, revealing the faster HER kinetics of MoP/MoO2 heterojunction at electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface. Additionally, the stability of MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst under acidic and basic conditions were further exploited by using the chronopotentiometry test at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. The catalytic overpotential showed no apparent increase during more than 24 h of hydrogen release, confirming their good stability (Fig. 3 e). Moreover, the post-electrolysis characterization indicated that porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction still maintained the heterointerface and porous morphology after HER electrolysis with negligible changes, demonstrating its outstanding structural robustness (Fig. S13). Finally, generated hydrogen in 0.5 M H2SO4 by a loaded MoP/MoO2 electrode was determined using gas chromatography. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) was determined to be close to 98.7% for the HER via the comparison of the theoretical calculation to experimental measurement (Fig. S14)."
11,Theoretical calculation analysis,"3.3 Theoretical calculation analysis The theoretical investigation was performed based on the DFT calculations to deeply explore the internal mechanism of MoP/MoO2 electrocatalyst with excellent HER performance. Combined with theoretical calculation and experimental results, five different models were proposed including MoO2 (011), P-MoO2 (011), MoP (100), MoP (100)-hole, MoP (100) / MoO2 (200)-hole, as depicted in Fig. S15. The partial density of states (DOS) of Mo-based electrocatalysts presented a typical metallic nature with Mo 3d orbital crossing the Fermi level, which would be conductive to the rapid electron transfer in electrocatalysis (Fig. 4 a). Meanwhile, the d-band centers (εd) of P-MoO2, MoP / MoO2-hole, and MoP were calculated to be −3.96, −2.40, and −2.30 eV, respectively, much higher than that of MoO2 (−4.24 eV), suggesting that the substitution of P for O atoms in MoO2 contributed to the shift of the εd close to the Fermi level. The moderate value of d band position would support the optimal balance for the absorption/desorption strength of atomic hydrogen on the active sites. [47,48] On the other hand, the electron density difference of MoP (100) /MoO2 (200) was further calculated, and the blue and red regions in Fig. 4 b and S16 represented the electron depletion and electron accumulation area, respectively. The strong electron redistribution was clearly observed at the interface region. Besides, the electron density difference indicated that the O atoms near the interface accepted more electrons from the Mo atoms. The electron transfer from MoP to MoO2, resulting in the hole accumulation on MoP, was helpful for hydrogen desorption from MoP surface, which could avoid poisoning the active sites of the catalysts. Accordingly, the free energy of the atomic hydrogen (ΔGH*), a reasonable descriptor of the HER activity with a ΔGH* value close to zero, was thus calculated to further understand the HER performance in depth. [49,50] As shown in Fig. 4 c and S17, the top views of H absorption on Mo and P sites were plotted according to the above models. Fig. 4 d clearly presented that the |ΔGH*| value for Mo sites of P-MoO2 (011) was 0.27 eV, much lower than that of pure MoO2 (100) (|ΔGH*| = 0.37 eV). In contrast, the H absorption on Mo site of MoP at MoP (100) / MoO2 (200)-hole experienced a substantially low barrier of −0.10 eV and the |ΔGH*| value was 0.16 eV, suggesting that the nanointerfaces in porous MoP(100) / MoO2 (200) had great advantage over optimizing the energy of hydrogen binding and thus enhancing the HER activity (Fig. 4 d and S18). Further, it can be seen that the P site on the surface of MoP/MoO2 (|ΔGH*| = 0.47 eV) was inert for H2 production (Fig. 4 e). After introducing nanopores in MoP/MoO2, the |ΔGH*| value was reduced to 0.17 eV, revealing that the unsaturated P sites at the wall of nanopores were more catalytically active for HER compared with those on the intact surface. Nevertheless, the MoP(100)-hole exhibited a large value of 0.80 eV for Mo sites and 0.60 eV for P sites, which was even higher than that of pure MoP(100) (|ΔGH*| = 0.46 eV at Mo site, |ΔGH*| = 0.55 eV at P site). This modeling declared that abundant heterointerfaces and nanopores existing in 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets could greatly enhance the HER performance because of the increased electronic conductivity and the activated electroactive sites. Briefly, the superior HER catalytic activity of porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets could be mainly attributed to the collective effects of the desirable electron configuration, abundant heterogeneous interfaces and 2D porous nanoarchitecture (Fig. 4 f). Firstly, the metallic nature of MoP/MoO2 heterojunction favors the electron transfer between the catalyst and current collector, and the electron delocalization optimizes the electronic structure configuration, thereby lowering the barrier of hydrogen binding. Secondly, the abundant heterogeneous interfaces in MoP/MoO2 electrocatalysts could offer catalytically active sites and optimize the hydrogen adsorption energies, thus promoting the HER kinetics. Thirdly, the 2D porous nanoarchitecture could facilitate electrolyte penetration to the electrode surface, which shortened the ion diffusion path and supported continuous mass transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface. Meanwhile, holey structure could also expose more active edge sites with unsaturated coordination to boost the HER activity. In view of these advantageous features, the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets demonstrated to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst with superior HER activity among the reported Mo-based catalysts (Table S2)."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, a PH3 and H2 vapor treatment approach was developed for the controllable phase transformation from 2D MoO2 precursor to 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets for HER. Based on experimental and theoretical results, the phase regulation and porosity engineering were proved to be an effective means for enhancing the HER activity of electrocatalyst. Accordingly, the porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets exhibited superior HER activity and durable electrochemical stability in comparison with MoO2, P-MoO2 and pure MoP electrocatalysts. The outstanding performance of the MoP/MoO2 electrocatalysts could be attributed to additional exposure of electroactive sites, enhanced electron transfer and mass transport ability, and large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets. In addition, DFT calculations indicated that the interface between MoP and MoO2 domain could modulate the d-band centers for the optimization of H* adsorption, and holey engineering could generate more active edge sites at the interface of MoP/MoO2. This work not only exhibited the construction of interfaces and holes on 2D catalysts for creating abundant catalytic sites and optimizing hydrogen binding energy to boost the HER activity, but also provided a novel approach toward the rational design of highly efficient 2D electrocatalysts."
