0,Introduction,"Polymer thermodynamics have attracted much attention during the last decades and modeling of the phase equilibria of polymeric systems is becoming increasingly important for a numerous industrial processes and products. The knowledge of the phase behavior of polymer–solvent mixtures is necessary for the rational design of processes, such as the recovery and separation of organic vapors using polymeric membranes, the production of paints and coatings [1,2], the impregnation of polymers, the encapsulation of pharmaceutical substances in biodegradable polymer matrices [3] and the production of polymer nanocomposites and films using solution casting methods [4,5]. Moreover, the phase behavior of polymer solvent systems is important in polymer synthesis, since polymers are produced in or via solutions [6]. Empirical or semi-empirical models, such as activity coefficient free volume based models, are used very often in order to model the vapor–liquid equilibria of polymer–solvent mixtures [7–9]. Another wide family of models that are often used includes the equations of state. The lattice fluid theory [10], the Panayiotou–Vera equation of state [11] and their modifications [12,13] are among the most common and successful models. On the other hand, equation of state models derived from perturbation theories, such as the SAFT (Statistical Associating fluid Theory) type models, are also used [1,7,14,15]. Finally, during the last years modified cubic equations of state have been also applied in polymer systems [16,17]. Advanced lattice theories and SAFT type models can account for the potential hydrogen bonding between polymer chains and/or solvent molecules. However, the formation of hydrogen bonds in polymer systems increases the non-ideal behavior of such mixtures, rendering the modeling of their phase behavior a challenging task. Consequently, there are only few studies for the modeling of the phase behavior in hydrogen bonding polymer systems [1,14,18,19]. This work emphasizes on systems with complex hydrogen bonding behavior, in which functional groups of the polymer chain can self-associate or cross-associate with the solvent molecules. The vapor–liquid equilibria of systems of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAC) with various solvents has been investigated. Effort has been made to explicitly account for all hydrogen bonding interactions. For this reason the Non-Random Hydrogen Bonding (NRHB) model [20] was used, which recently showed promising results in modeling the phase behavior of systems with complex hydrogen bonding behavior, such as the most mixtures with pharmaceuticals [21,22]. NRHB is a recent development of previous successful lattice models and so far has been applied for the description of phase equilibria of various types of mixtures with low molecular compounds [23–25]."
1,The model,"NRHB theory is a compressible lattice model, where holes are used to account for density variation as a result of temperature and pressure changes [20]. NRHB accounts explicitly for the non-random distribution of molecular sites while Veytsman's statistics is used to calculate the contribution of hydrogen bonding to the thermodynamics of the system. Thus, the model is suitable for property calculations of highly non-ideal fluids. According to this, N molecules are assumed to be arranged on a quasi-lattice of N r sites, N 0 of which are empty, with a lattice coordination number, z. Each molecule of type i in the system occupies r i sites of the quasi-lattice. It is characterized by three scaling parameters and one geometric, or surface-to-volume-ratio factor, s. The first two scaling parameters, ε h * and ε s * , are used for the calculation of the mean interaction energy per molecular segment, ɛ*, according to the following equation: (1) ε * = ε h * + T − 298.15 ε s * The third scaling parameter, v s p , 0 * , is used for the calculation of the close packed density, ρ ∗ = 1 / v s p * , as described by the following equation: (2) v s p * = v s p , 0 * + T − 298.15 v s p , 1 * The hard-core volume per segment, v ∗ , is constant and equal to 9.75cm3 mol−1 for all fluids. Parameter v s p , 1 * in Eq. (2) is treated as a constant for a given homologous series [20,24]. The following relation holds: r = M W v s p * / v * , where MW stands for molecular weight. Finally, the shape factor is defined as the ratio of molecular surface to molecular volume, s = zq/zr = q/r, and is calculated from UNIFAC group contribution method [26,27]. In case of mixtures the following mixing and combining rules are used: (3) r = ∑ i x i r i (4) ε * = ∑ i = 1 t ∑ j = 1 t θ i θ j ε i j * where (5) ε i j * = ε i * ε j * 1 − k i j where θ is the surface fraction and k ij a binary interaction parameter. The equation of state for a fluid mixture assumes the following form [20]: (6) P ˜ + T ˜ ln 1 − ρ ˜ − ρ ˜ ∑ i ϕ i l i r i − ν h b − z 2 ln 1 − ρ ˜ + q r ρ ˜ + z 2 ln Γ 00 = 0 while the chemical potential for the component i is given by [20]: (7) μ i R T = ln ϕ i ω i r i − r i ∑ j ϕ j l j r j + ln ρ ˜ + r i ( v ˜ − 1 ) ln ( 1 − ρ ˜ ) − z 2 r i v ˜ − 1 + q i r i ln 1 − ρ ˜ + q r ρ ˜ + z q i 2 ln Γ i i + r i q i ( v ˜ − 1 ) ln Γ 00 + r i P ˜ v ˜ T ˜ − q i T ˜ i + μ i , h b R T where φ i is the site and fraction of component i. The following relation holds: (8) l i = z 2 r i − q i − r i − 1 while ω i is a characteristic quantity for each fluid i that takes into account the flexibility and the symmetry of the molecule. This parameter, cancels out in all applications of our interest. Parameters Γ 00 and Γ ii are non-random factors for the distribution of empty sites around an empty site and of molecular segments of component i around a molecular segment of component i, respectively. Finally, parameters T ˜ = T / T ∗ , P ˜ = P / P ∗ and v ˜ ( = 1 / ρ ˜ = ρ ∗ / ρ ) are the reduced temperature, pressure, and specific volume, respectively. The characteristic temperature, T*, and pressure, P*, are related to the mean intersegmental energy by: (9) ε ∗ = R T ∗ = P ∗ v ∗ Detailed expressions for the calculation of all these parameters can be found elsewhere [20]. The expression for the chemical potential of a pure component can be obtained from Eq. (7) by setting φ i =1 and the number of components in the summation equal to 1. NRHB can model properties of hydrogen bonded fluids of any number of donor and acceptor groups. In the following equations, m is the number of proton donor types and n the number of proton acceptor types that exist in the mixture, while d α k is the number of donor groups of type α in each molecule of type k and c β k the number of acceptor groups of type β in each molecule of type k. N α β h b is the total number of hydrogen bonds between a donor of type α and an acceptor of type β in the system. Parameter ν hb is the average per molecular segment number of hydrogen bonds in the system and is given by: (10) ν h b = ∑ α m ∑ β n ν α β = ∑ α m ∑ β n N α β h b r N The hydrogen bonding contribution in the chemical potential of component i is given by the expression: (11) μ i , h b R T = r i ν h b − ∑ α = 1 m d α i ln ν d α ν α 0 − ∑ β = 1 n c β i ln ν c β ν 0 β where the number of donors of type α per molecular segment, ν d α , is: (12) ν d α = N d α r N = ∑ k d α k N k r N and the number of acceptors of type β per molecular segment, ν c β , is: (13) ν c β = N a β r N = ∑ k c β k N k r N while the number of the unbonded donors of type a per molecular segment, ν a0, is: (14) ν α 0 = ν d α − ∑ β = 1 n ν α β and similarly the number unbonded acceptors of type β per molecular segment, ν 0β , (15) ν 0 β = ν c β − ∑ α = 1 m ν α β According to the model [20], the ν αβ ’s satisfy the minimization conditions: (16) ν α β ν α 0 ν 0 β = ρ ˜ exp − G α β h b R T for all ( α , β ) In Eq. (16), G α β h b is the free enthalpy of formation of the hydrogen bond of type α–β and is given in terms of the energy (E), volume (V), and entropy (S) of hydrogen bond formation by the equation: (17) G α β h b = E α β h b + P V α β h b − T S α β h b The formalism is general and sufficient for solving phase equilibrium problems in systems of hydrogen bonded fluids of any number of donor and acceptor groups. For associating fluids, NRHB has three more parameters that are the energy, E α β h b , the volume, V α β h b , and the entropy change, S α β h b , for the formation of hydrogen bonds between proton donors of type α and proton acceptors of type β in different molecules. However, usually the volume change for the formation of a hydrogen bond, V α β h b , is set equal to zero, so the number of hydrogen bonding parameters are reduced to two without compromising the performance of the model [23]. According to the model, the volume of the system is given by: (18) V = r N v ˜ v * + ∑ a ∑ β N a β h b V a β h b Setting the volume change for the formation of a hydrogen bond, V a β h b , equal to zero we obtain the following equations for the total and partial hydrogen bonding solubility parameters: (19) δ = δ d + δ p + δ h b = E c o h V = Γ 11 q Θ r ε * − r ∑ a ∑ β ν a β E a β h b r v ˜ v * and (20) δ h b = E h b V = − r ∑ a ∑ β ν a β E a β h b r v ˜ v * where Θ r is the surface (contact) fraction of molecular segments with respect to the total segments (empty and occupied) of lattice, E coh is the cohesive energy (i.e. the energy change upon the removal of all intermolecular interactions and E hb the energy sum of all hydrogen bonding interactions."
2,Pure fluids,"In order to estimate pure fluid scaling parameters for polyglycol molecules the corresponding parameters for low molecular weight glycols (with molecular weight up to 194gmol−1) were calculated. Such parameters were obtained by fitting the predictions of the theory to saturated liquid densities and vapor pressures from the DIPPR database [28] as well as to Hansen's partial hydrogen bonding and total solubility parameters using a procedure described elsewhere [21,22]. For ethylene glycol and propylene glycol five parameters were estimated (three physical parameters, ε h * , ε s * , v s p , 0 * , and two hydrogen bonding ones, E hb and S hb , for the –OH⋯OH– interaction). By keeping the latter hydrogen bonding parameters constants for all glycol molecules, five parameters (three physical parameters, ε h * , ε s * , v s p , 0 * , and two hydrogen bonding ones, E hb and S hb , for the –OH⋯–O–interaction) were also estimated for diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol. In all cases one proton donor and one proton acceptor sites were assumed in every hydroxyl group (–OH) and two acceptor sites in every ether oxygen group (–O–). In this way, the hydrogen bonding parameters for the –OH⋯OH– interaction were estimated equal to E hb =−22,500Jmol−1 and S hb =−27.5Jmol−1 K−1, while the hydrogen bonding parameters for the –OH⋯–O– interaction were estimated equal to E hb =−14,900Jmol−1 and S hb =−27.8Jmol−1 K−1. The obtained physical parameters for low molecular glycols are presented in Table 1 , while the experimental and the calculated by the model solubility parameters are shown in Table 2 . The aforementioned hydrogen bonding parameters (for the –OH⋯OH– and –OH⋯–O– interactions) were also kept constant for all polyglycol molecules. In a second step, the physical parameters ( ε h * , ε s * , v s p , 0 * ) for poly(ethylene glycols) with different weight average molecular weights (i.e. 300, 600, 1540, 18,500 and 100,000gmol−1) were estimated by fitting the predictions of the model to experimental density data over an extended pressure and temperature range [30]. In this way, appropriate expressions (see Table 1) were obtained for the dependence of the physical parameters from molecular weight. Physical pure fluid parameters for all other polymers that were used in this study were obtained by fitting the predictions of the model to experimental density data over an extended pressure and temperature range [30]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) was modeled assuming one proton donor and one proton acceptor sites in each hydroxyl group. For simplicity, the corresponding hydrogen bonding parameters for the –OH⋯OH– self-associating interactions were the same as in polyglycols (i.e. E hb =−22,500Jmol−1, S hb =−27.5Jmol−1 K−1). Moreover, poly(vinyl acetate) was modeled as non-self-associating fluid. However, one proton acceptor site was assumed in every –O–CO group that is able to cross-associate with proton donor sites in solvent molecules. Pure fluid parameters for solvents were adopted from previous studies. All physical parameters for the fluids that were used in this study are presented in Table 1. All hydrogen bonding sites that were assumed in every polymer or solvent functional group are presented in Table 3 . According to Grenner et al. [24] the hydrogen bonding parameters for self-associating interactions in water are E hb =−16,100Jmol−1 and S hb =−14.7Jmol−1 K−1. Also, the hydrogen bonding parameters for self-associating interactions in methanol are E hb =−25,100Jmol−1 and S hb =−26.5Jmol−1 K−1, while for all other alkanols are E hb =−24,000Jmol−1 and S hb =−27.5Jmol−1 K−1. Finally, the hydrogen bonding parameters for self-associating interactions in primary amines are E hb =−11,100Jmol−1 and S hb =−20.60Jmol−1 K−1. Finally, in the NRHB model, the parameter v s p , 1 * that is used in Eq. (2), is treated as a characteristic parameter of a given homologous series. It is equal to −0.412×10−3 cm3 g−1 K−1 for non-aromatic hydrocarbons, −0.310×10−3 cm3 g−1 K−1 for alcohols, −0.240×10−3 cm3 g−1 K−1 for acetates, −0.300×10−3 cm3 g−1 K−1 for water and 0.150×10−3 cm3 g−1 K−1 for all the other fluids [24]. As it is shown in Table 1, the model can accurately describe the volumetric properties of polymers. In all cases the absolute average deviation from experimental data on specific volume was lower than 0.6%. Characteristic correlations for the specific volume of PEG with molecular weight equal to 1540gmol−1 are shown in Fig. 1 ."
3,Results and discussion,"Calculations were performed for the vapor–liquid equilibrium of binary polymer–solvent mixtures. In all associating systems, hydrogen bonding was explicitly accounted for. Next, results are presented for model predictions (using no binary interaction parameter, k ij =0) and model correlations (using one temperature independent binary interaction parameter fitted to experimental data, k ij ≠0)."
4,Mixtures with poly(ethylene glycol),"4.1 Mixtures with poly(ethylene glycol) The vapor–liquid equilibrium of water–poly(ethylene glycol) and benzene–poly(ethylene glycol) systems was studied. Water molecules can form hydrogen bonds with ether oxygens and hydroxyl end groups of polyglycol chains. According to NMR studies the activation energy for the water–PEG association is about 34,000Jmol−1 [31], which most probably corresponds to two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. Consequently, the hydrogen bonding energy should be about −17,000Jmol−1. This value reflects only the interaction between water molecules and ether oxygens considering that in high molecular weight polyglycols the number of ether oxygens is significantly larger than the number of hydroxyl end groups. In a statistical thermodynamic model, Dormidontova [32] used the experimental value for the hydrogen bonding energy, while the hydrogen bonding entropy was fitted to experimental data and was found around −27.2Jmol−1 K−1. Furthermore, Smith et al. [33] calculated the hydrogen bonding energy and entropy using molecular dynamic simulations. For mixtures, in which the polymer weight fraction was below 0.5, the hydrogen bonding energy was calculated around −15,500Jmol−1 and the association entropy around −23.5 to −27.5Jmol−1 K−1. In this study, hydrogen bonding was explicitly accounted for. The hydrogen bonding energy for the –O–⋯HOH cross-association was taken equal to the experimental value, E hb =−17,000Jmol−1, while the association entropy was set equal to −27.0Jmol−1 K−1. On the other hand, for the –HO⋯HOH cross-association and for most other cases where there was lack of appropriate experimental data, the corresponding hydrogen bonding parameters were obtained from the following combining rules: (21) E i j h b = E i h b + E j h b 2 , S i j h b = S i h b 1 / 3 + S j h b 1 / 3 2 3 Results are presented in Table 4 , while representative calculations are shown in Fig. 2 . In all cases model predictions (using no binary interaction parameter, k ij =0) are in good agreement with the experimental data, while very accurate correlations are obtained using one temperature independent binary interaction parameter (k ij ≠0). At this point it is worth mentioning that in low molecular weight glycols usually only four equivalent sites, which correspond to the hydroxyl end groups, are assumed on every molecule [25,36,37]. This simpler way of modeling glycol systems results in successful correlations for the phase behavior of low molecular compounds with various non-associating solvents [25,37]. However, as it is presented in Fig. 3 , an unsatisfactory description of the phase behavior is obtained for aqueous systems. This happens because in this way the cross-associating interactions between water and ether oxygens are neglected. On the other hand, model predictions (using k ij =0) and correlations (k ij ≠0) are in very good agreement with experimental data when all hydrogen bonding interactions are explicitly accounted for."
5,Mixtures with poly(propylene glycol),"4.2 Mixtures with poly(propylene glycol) The vapor–liquid equilibrium of water–poly(propylene glycol), methanol–poly(propylene glycol) and benzene–poly(propylene glycol) systems was studied. In all cases, hydrogen bonding was explicitly accounted for. Parameters for the –HO⋯HOH cross-associating interactions and the –HO⋯HO– interaction between alkanols and polymer chain end groups were obtained from the combining rules of Eq. (21). Parameters for the –O–⋯HOH cross-association were the same as in poly(ethylene glycol)–water mixtures (i.e. E hb =−17,000Jmol−1, S hb =−27.0Jmol−1 K−1). Results are presented in Table 5 , while representative calculations are shown in Fig. 4 . Model predictions (k ij =0) show the highest deviation from experimental data for water–PPG system, however, they are satisfactory, considering the complexity of such mixture (Fig. 4a). Better description of the experimental data is obtained using a temperature independent binary independent binary interaction parameter (k ij ≠0). On the other hand, model predictions (k ij =0) are in excellent agreement with experimental data for both other cases and the use of binary interaction parameter is not needed, especially in benzene–PPG system."
6,Mixtures with poly(vinyl alcohol),"4.3 Mixtures with poly(vinyl alcohol) Next, the model was applied to describe the vapor–liquid equilibrium of water–poly(vinyl alcohol). Hydrogen bonding was explicitly accounted for and parameters for the –HO⋯HOH cross-associating interactions were obtained from the combining rules of Eq. (21). Results are presented in Table 6 and Fig. 5 . The number of hydroxyl groups that exist in polymer chains and their ability to form intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds as well as cross-hydrogen bonds with water molecules increases the non-ideal behavior of this system and renders the modeling of the phase behavior a challenging task. However, despite the complexity of the system the model predictions (k ij =0) are in reasonable agreement with experimental data, while a satisfactory correlation is obtained using one temperature independent binary interaction parameter (k ij ≠0)."
7,Mixtures with poly(vinyl acetate),"4.4 Mixtures with poly(vinyl acetate) The vapor–liquid equilibrium of poly(vinyl acetate) with various solvents was studied. Cross-associating interactions between solvent and polymer molecules were considered in mixtures with alcohols, amines and water. The hydrogen bonding parameters for the –HO⋯–O–CO cross-associating interactions between alcohol molecules and polymer chain groups (E hb =−22,100Jmol−1, S hb =−27.3Jmol−1 K−1) were adopted from Tsivintzelis et al. [22]. Since there are no self associating interactions in PVAC, in mixtures with amines, parameters for the –NH2⋯OC–O– cross-associating interactions were obtained from the following combining rules [22–25]: (22) E i j h b = E i h b 2 , S i j h b = S i h b 2 Results for mixtures with alcohols, amines and non-associating solvents are presented in Table 7 , while representative calculations are shown in Fig. 6 . Hydrogen bonding interactions exist only in mixtures with alcohols or amines. In systems with alcohols, model predictions (k ij =0) and correlations (k ij ≠0) show the lowest deviation from experimental data for methanol–PVAC mixture (Fig. 6a), while relatively higher deviations are observed for the other systems (see also Fig. 6b). Moreover, model's predictions and correlations are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data for mixtures with amines (see also Fig. 6c). In mixtures with ketones or acetates there are no hydrogen bonding interactions. In these systems, model's predictions and correlations are in good agreement with experimental data (see also Fig. 6d). The lower deviations from experimental data are observed for model's predictions and correlations for benzene–PVAC system. Finally, the mixture of PVAC with water was modeled using two approaches. Initially, parameters for the HOH⋯–O–CO cross-associating interactions were estimated using the combining rules of Eq. (21). However, as it is presented in Fig. 7 , this approach results in an unsatisfactory description of the experimental data, even using a non-zero binary interaction parameter. In a second approach, the hydrogen bonding parameters for the cross HOH⋯OC–O– associating interactions were optimized by fitting the predictions of the theory to the experimental data. In this way, as it is also shown in Fig. 7, satisfactory correlations were obtained. The corresponding hydrogen boding parameters were estimated equal to E hb =−15,685.5Jmol−1 and S hb =−15.20Jmol−1 K−1, respectively. Unfortunately, to the best of authors’ knowledge there are no experimental data for the strength of these hydrogen bonding interactions in order to validate the model parameters."
8,Conclusions,"The vapor–liquid equilibrium of binary systems with poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinyl acetate) with various solvents was modeled. Emphasis was on systems with complex hydrogen bonding behavior. The results reveal that the NRHB model provides a flexible approach for considering association in such mixtures. If all hydrogen bonding interactions are explicitly accounted for the NRHB model satisfactorily describes the experimental data. In most cases model's predictions (using no binary interaction parameter k ij =0) are in good agreement with the experimental data, while satisfactory agreement is obtained using one temperature independent binary interaction parameter (k ij ≠0). Work is underway to extend the suggested approach to polymer–solvent liquid–liquid equilibrium, to mixtures of hydrogen bonding polymers and to multicomponent mixtures.
