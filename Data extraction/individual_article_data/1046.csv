0,Introduction,"Human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) are zinc-containing enzymes, which catalyse one of the most important reaction in life, that is the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and proton [1]. So far 15 isoforms (of which only 12 are catalytically active) have been identified, which differ for tissue distribution, kinetic properties, oligomeric arrangement and sensitivity to inhibitors [1,2]. With the only exception of the isoforms VA and VB, all catalytically active hCAs have been structurally characterized by means of X-ray crystallography [2,3], showing that their catalytic domains have a very similar three-dimensional structure whose main feature is a central β-sheet surrounded by helical connections and additional β-strands [2]. The active site is placed in a large, conical cavity containing at the bottom the catalytic zinc ion tetrahedrally coordinated by three conserved histidine residues (His94, His96 and His119) and a water molecule/hydroxide ion. The latter is involved in a network of hydrogen bonds, which enhance its nucleophilicity, necessary for carrying out the catalytic reaction. In particular, it establishes hydrogen bonds with the strictly conserved residue Thr199 and with two water molecules, the first one, called “deep water”, located in the substrate binding pocket and the second one, located in a hydrophilic environment toward the entrance of the active site cavity [2] (Fig. S1). Several studies demonstrated important roles of hCAs in a variety of pathophysiological processes, showing that their abnormal levels or activities can be associated with different human diseases [1]. Consequently, in recent years these enzymes have become an interesting target for the design of molecules with diagnostic and therapeutic applications [2,4–6]. Primary sulfonamide derivatives represent the best characterized class of CA inhibitors (CAIs) so far developed, with several compounds in clinical use for many years, as diuretics, antiglaucoma agents, as well as antiepileptics [1] (Fig. 1 ). Starting from the first evidence of their inhibitory properties [1], a huge amount of structural studies have been carried out on adducts of these molecules with hCAs, allowing to explain in detail their action mechanism [2]. These inhibitors generally possess three main structural elements: the sulfonamide moiety, which acts as zinc binding group (ZBG), an organic scaffold that interacts with the lower-middle region of the active site, and one or more “tails” which interact with outer region of the catalytic cavity [7] (Fig. S2). The tails were initially conceived to improve the water solubility [8] and membrane (im)permeability [9], but afterward their design was oriented toward the improvement of isoform selectivity, since the outer region of the active site is the most variable one among the various isoforms [7]. However, due to the predominant role played by the sulfonamide-zinc ion interaction in determining the enzyme/inhibitor binding affinity, changes in the nature of the tail did not always show the desired effect on selectivity [10]. Therefore, many efforts have been dedicated in the last years to the development of new classes of CAIs either containing a less strong ZBG than the sulfonamide one, or possessing alternative inhibition mechanisms, such as the anchoring to the zinc bound water molecule (ZBW) (phenols, polyamines, sulfocoumarins) [11–13], the occlusion of the active site entrance (coumarins) [14] or “freezing” the conformation of the proton shuttle residue (some carboxylic acids) [15]. Alcohols are among the most common organic compounds, characterized by the presence of at least one hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic carbon atom [16]. According to the nature of the carbon atom, they may be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary alcohols [16]. They constitute an important class of molecules, with many industrial applications both as solvents and as intermediates in the synthesis of other compounds and for the production of molecules with pharmacological properties [17–19]. Indeed, the hydroxyl group is one of the functional groups most commonly found in marketed drugs. Actually, more than 35% of all drugs in the ChEMBL data set contain at least one hydroxyl functionality in their structure [20]. Indeed, the presence of the –OH group allows alcohols to form extended hydrogen-bond networks, giving an essential contribution to the drug-receptor binding affinity and selectivity [20]. Surprisingly, up to date alcohols have been scarcely investigated as CAIs; indeed few kinetic studies on the inhibition of some isoforms have been published [21–23], and only one crystallographic structure has been reported, showing the adduct formed by 2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS) (compound 1 in Fig. 1) with the hCA II variant His94Gln [24]. In this adduct the TRIS molecule coordinated the zinc ion in a bidentate way, through one of its hydroxyl oxygen and the primary amino group [24]. Thus, to get more insights into the CA inhibition properties of this class of molecules, in the present study we report the kinetic characterization of a simple primary alcohol, namely benzyl alcohol (compound 2 in Fig. 1), a well-known molecular scaffold presents in numerous approved or under investigation drugs [25–27]. In addition, the crystallographic structure of the complex that this molecule forms with hCA II has also been determined, allowing us to define the main protein-inhibitor interactions and thus opening the way to further investigations on such molecule for the development of isoform-selective CAIs."
1,Materials and methods,
2,CA inhibition,"2.1 CA inhibition An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument has been used for assaying the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity [28]. Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mM) has been used as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaClO4 (for maintaining constant the ionic strength) and following the initial rates of the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction for a period of 10–100 s. The KI-s reported in the work were determined at a concentration of substrate of 16 mM and a concentration of hCA II of 9.5 nM. At least six traces of the initial 5–10% of the reaction have been used for determining the initial velocity. The uncatalyzed rates were determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15–60 min at room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and represent the mean from at least three different determinations."
3,"Crystallization, X-ray data collection, and refinement","2.2 Crystallization, X-ray data collection, and refinement hCA II protein was prepared as previously described [29]. Crystals of the hCA II/2 complex were obtained by soaking pre-formed enzyme crystals in a solution containing 20 mM inhibitor in the crystallization buffer (1.3 M sodium citrate and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Before data collection, crystals were flash cryo-cooled in the reservoir solution with the addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. A complete data set was collected in-house at −180 °C, using a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF generator producing Cu Kα radiation and equipped with a Saturn 944 CCD detector. Data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 [30]. Details of data collection statistics are reported in Table S1. The structure of hCA II/2 adduct was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques, using the PDB file 1CA2 [31] as starting model for refinement after deletion of non-protein atoms. Structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS [32,33] and model building was performed with O [34]. In particular, an initial round of rigid body refinement was followed by simulated annealing and isotropic thermal factor (B-factor) refinement. The inspection of electron density maps in correspondence of the active site region after this single round of refinement revealed the presence of an inhibitor molecule in the active site of hCA II, which was easily built into the model. Restraints on inhibitor bond angles and distances were taken from the Cambridge Structural Database [35], whereas standard restraints [36] were used on protein bond angles and distances throughout refinement. Water molecules were built into peaks >3σ in |Fo|-|Fc| maps that demonstrated appropriate hydrogen-bonding geometry. Crystallographic refinement was carried out against 93.6% of the measured data, of which 4.1% was randomly selected and used for R-free calculations to monitor the refinement progress. Several alternating cycles of energy minimization, individual temperature factor refinement and manual model building gave the final model with Rwork/Rfree values of 16.9/19.4%. The correctness of model stereochemistry was finally checked using PROCHECK [37] and WHATCHECK [38]. Final refinement statistics are presented in Table S1. The refined model contained 2039 protein atoms, 194 waters, one zinc ion and one inhibitor molecule. The atomic coordinates of hCA II/2 complex were deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession code 7BI5."
4,Results and discussion,"A stopped flow CO2 hydration assay was used to determine the inhibitory activity of compound 2 against hCA II. Acetazolamide has been used as a positive control, as it acts as a potent, zinc binding inhibitor with a KI of 12 nM. As seen from data of Table 1 , when hCA II was incubated with benzyl alcohol for 15 min, a KI of 3170 μM was measured, showing the inhibitor to be extremely weak. However, when the incubation was prolonged to 30 min, the KI diminished almost 20-fold, to 178 μM, whereas incubation for one hour or longer periods, led to a KI of 153.5 μM. Thus, benzyl alcohol is a weak, micromolar CA inhibitor. Considering however that the scaffold of the compound is exceedingly simple, this inhibition data are quite significant for proposing alcohols, possibly with a scaffold decorated with other moieties, as a new interesting class of CAIs. To elucidate the binding mode of benzyl alcohol to the CA active site, the crystal structure of the adduct formed by compound 2 with hCA II was determined. hCA II was chosen as model isoform for crystallization, since it easily forms crystals and many studies have been reported on its adducts with all classes of known inhibitors [2,29,39–41]. Crystals of the complex were obtained by soaking the inhibitor molecule into pre-formed hCA II crystals. The structure was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques using the native hCA II coordinates as reference, and subsequently refined with the CNS program [32,33] to crystallographic Rwork and Rfree values of 0.169/0.194 in the 32.1–1.74 Å resolution range (Table S1). After the first stages of refinement, inspection of the |Fo–Fc| and |2Fo–Fc| electron density maps revealed the presence of one inhibitor molecule bound in the enzyme active site (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, as previously observed for other inhibitors, such as polyamines and some carboxylic acids [12,42,43], this molecule does not coordinate the catalytic zinc ion but is anchored by a hydrogen bond to ZBW (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, the inhibitor hydroxyl moiety, which is placed in the same position occupied by the “deep water” in the native enzyme, forms a second hydrogen bond interaction with the amide nitrogen of Thr199 (Fig. 2B). Finally, the phenyl ring is located in the middle of the active site cavity, establishing hydrophobic interactions with residues Val121, Leu141, Leu198 and Trp209 (Fig. 2B). Many sulfonamide CAIs containing primary alcohol moieties in their structure (see compounds 3–5 in Fig. 1) have been so far structurally characterized [44–46]. Interestingly, all these inhibitors, although containing two functional groups able to anchor the molecule to the enzyme, always bind the CA active site coordinating the zinc ion through the sulfonamide group, with the alcohol moiety being oriented towards the entrance of the catalytic cavity (Fig. S3) and thus playing only a minor role in the enzyme-inhibitor interaction [44–46]. Moreover, binding assays showed that these molecules are much stronger CAIs than simply aliphatic alcohols [44–46]. Altogether these data clearly evidenced that sulfonamide is a CA active site anchoring group much stronger than the hydroxyl functionality. Differently from alcohols, the strictly related phenols (compounds containing aromatic hydroxyl functionalities) have been much more investigated as inhibitors of both human CAs and CAs isolated from pathogenic organisms [47–49]. Moreover, for these compounds various crystallographic studies have been published, allowing to clarify in detail their inhibition mechanism [2,11,42]. It is worth noting that, although phenols and benzyl alcohol adopt the same CA inhibition mechanism, by anchoring to the active site through a hydrogen bond interaction with the ZBW, their phenyl rings present sometimes a very different orientation, as shown in Fig. 3 A, where the structural superposition between compound 2 and a representative phenol (compound 6 in Fig. 1) is reported. Interestingly, when the CA binding mode of compound 2 is compared with that of a simple benzenesulfonamide (compound 7 in Fig. 1) [50], despite their different anchoring to the enzyme active site (hydrogen bond to the ZBW the first and zinc ion coordination the second), the position occupied by the phenyl rings is very similar (Fig. 3B). This suggests that, as largely described for benezenesulfonamides (the CAIs par excellence) [2], the aromatic ring of 2 can be opportunely derivatized with different tails, to target the outer region of the active site. However, in this case, the presence of a weaker anchoring group could provide to the tails a greater weight in the binding affinity, thus allowing to better discriminate the different CA isoforms. Further studies on benzyl alcohol derivatives are currently underway in our labs to test this hypothesis. In summary, in this article we have reported the first kinetic and structural characterization of a simple primary alcohol in the CA active site, thus elucidating the CA inhibition mechanism of this class of molecules. Taken together our results clearly indicate that in the general efforts to find new selective CAIs, primary alcohols deserve to be more investigated."
