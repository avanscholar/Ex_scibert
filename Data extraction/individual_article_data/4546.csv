0,Introduction,"Development of hydrogen production processes from different resources is becoming more important because of the rising energy demand and environmental concerns. Among different types of fuel cells proposed in the literature, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) have been considered to have good potential to be used as auxiliary power units in vehicles [1,2]. Solid oxide fuel cells are also considered to have good potential in residential power generation. SOFCs operate at high temperatures (600–1000°C) and are reported to have a number of advantages over PEM fuel cells, such as higher efficiency, durability and ability to use different fuels [2,3]. SOFCs can also tolerate the presence of CO and CH4 in the hydrogen rich feed gas. However, PEM fuel cells are vulnerable to CO poisoning. It is assumed that methane will react with steam within SOFC to further produce hydrogen. However, use of a readily available resource of hydrogen is needed for widespread use of SOFC. Conventionally, hydrogen is produced by reforming of natural gas or naphtha and production units are generally built near the raw material sources. However, transportation and storage of hydrogen have been considered as the main problems to be resolved for widespread use of it as a fuel. Considering these problems, recent studies were focused on the production of hydrogen from other more readily available fuels, such as kerosene, diesel fuel, gasoline, jet fuel and alcohols. The challenges of processing of different fuels for hydrogen production are discussed in the literature [4–9]. Zheng et al. investigated pre-reforming of jet fuel for use in a micro solid-oxide fuel cell [10]. Their detailed study showed that supported Rh catalyst was highly active and coke resistant. Studies for the development of on-board hydrogen production technologies were also emphasized in recent publications [9–11]. Hence, development of fuel cell based auxiliary power units for vehicles, and diesel fuel reformer design for automotive fuel cells have attracted major attention of researchers and car manufacturers in recent years [3,11–13]. Steam reforming reactions of a hydrocarbon feedstock are endothermic and generally favored at high temperatures. C n H m + n H 2 O → n C O + n + m / 2 H 2 Composition of the hydrocarbon feedstock used in the experiments will definitely influence the product distribution and hydrogen yield. In the case of kerosene as the feedstock, its composition can be approximated by C14H30. C 14 H 30 + 14 H 2 O → 14 C O + 29 H 2 Occurrence of water gas shift reaction (WGSR) together with steam reforming cause further conversion of CO to CO2 and production of more hydrogen. C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Since WGSR is an exothermic reaction, thermodynamics of this reaction is not favored at high temperatures. Hence, high H2O/hydrocarbon feed ratios are generally preferred to increase hydrogen yield. Methane and coke formation may also take place as a result of decomposition of the hydrocarbon feedstock during the reforming process. Product distributions were also affected due to occurrence of these decomposition reactions. Methane may also form as a result of reaction of CO with hydrogen. However, due to its exothermic nature, this reaction is not thermodynamically favored at high temperatures. C O + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + H 2 O Similarly, coke formation as a result of Bouduard reaction is not also thermodynamically favored at high temperatures. 2 C O ↔ C O 2 + C Higher ratio of H2O/CnHm in the feed stream is expected to decrease methane formation and coking during reforming of these hydrocarbon mixtures. Commercial availability of kerosene in large quantities and its high energy and high hydrogen density attracted researchers to develop new stable catalysts and to design efficient reactors for its reforming to produce hydrogen rich gas. One important problem in using kerosene as the resource for hydrogen production is coke deposition and high content of light hydrocarbons in the product stream. This brings a challenge to synthesize new active and stable catalysts for steam reforming of such a liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Noble metal based catalysts were reported to show good activity for steam and dry reforming reactions. Among the noble metals, catalytic performance of Ru was investigated by number of researchers and such catalytic materials were shown to give high activity in reforming reactions [5,10,14,15,22,23]. Due mainly to the high cost of Ru, Ni based catalysts attracted the attention of catalysis researchers and catalyst producers. Ni based catalytic materials were generally preferred in reforming reactions due to their high activity and low cost [11,16–21]. However, coke deposition and catalytic instability were reported as important problems over Ni based catalysts. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and sintering of Ni clusters were reported to cause instabilities in the performance of such catalysts in reforming reactions. Doping of Ni based catalysts with small amounts of noble metals, such as Ru, Rh, or Pt was reported to have positive effects to eliminate Ni sintering and stabilize catalytic performance [16,17,20,21]. Doping of Ni based catalysts with small amount of Ru has been considered to improve the reducibility of nickel and hence its tolerance to oxidation during steam reforming reactions [25–28]. Synergistic effect between Ni and Ru was considered to help in the self-activation and stability of the catalyst in steam reforming of methane [25,27]. Formation of bi-metallic Ni–Ru clusters was also reported to improve Ni dispersion [28]. Ru addition to Ni based catalysts was also reported to help in the oxidation of the produced coke [24]. Ceria with its high oxygen donor ability is also considered as an attractive catalytic support material to increase catalyst stability and to decrease coke formation [10,18,23,24]. In the present study, Ru and Ni impregnated bi-metallic catalysts having different compositions, as well as mono-metallic Ru or Ni containing catalysts were synthesized using ceria incorporated alumina as the support. Activities of these materials were tested in steam reforming of kerosene, in a reformer which was designed in our laboratory. Results proved the importance of catalyst composition on the product distribution, coke formation and on the stability of the catalyst."
1,Experimental work,
2,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization In the synthesis of Ru and Ni impregnated catalytic materials used in this work, commercial γ-alumina pellets were used as the support material. These pellets were in cylindrical shape with dimensions of 3×5mm. This support material had surface area and pore volume values of 200m2/g and 0.6cm3/g, respectively. It is a mesoporous material with an average pore diameter of about 7nm. In the first stage of the catalyst synthesis procedure, 5% CeO2 was impregnated into γ-alumina. Predetermined amount of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in water and mixed with alumina, with continuous stirring for about 18h. After the evaporation and the drying steps, ceria impregnated alumina pellets were calcined at 500°C. In the preparation of Ru and Ni impregnated materials, RuCl3 and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were used as the Ru and Ni precursors. Impregnation was achieved in two steps and the final product was dried at 110°C. Following the procedure described by Suzuki et al. [5] removal of Cl− from the catalyst structure was achieved by ammonia treatment. Conversion of ruthenium chloride to ruthenium hydroxide was expected as a result of this treatment step. Calcination of the final product was performed at 900°C. Following the procedure outlined above, bi-metallic catalysts containing 1% Ru–5% Ni, and 1% Ru–15% Ni were synthesized. Besides these materials, catalysts containing only 1% Ru and 15% Ni were also prepared for comparison purposes. Synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption/desorption, and SEM techniques. X-ray diffraction analysis of the materials was achieved using a Rigaku Ultima-IV XRD instrument. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and related pore structure analysis were performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb-6 instrument available in the same laboratory. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the materials were obtained using the QUANTA 400F field emission instrument. As far as the characterization of the used catalysts were concerned, thermal analysis (TGA) of the catalysts after reaction were performed in flowing air. TGA analysis was performed to get information about the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts during reaction. These tests were performed using the Setaram Labsys TGA/DTA instrument."
3,Experimental system,"2.2 Experimental system Steam reforming experiments of kerosene were performed in a tubular flow reactor system designed in our laboratory. It has an inner diameter of 20mm and a length of 200mm. In each experiment 10g of fresh catalyst was placed at the central position of the reactor. The length of the catalyst bed was approximately 50mm. This experimental reactor was externally heated to the desired temperature and temperature was measured and controlled using a thermocouple placed at the center of the catalyst zone. Kerosene and water were pumped separately into the fuel and water evaporators at desired rates using Agilent HPLC pumps. Total flow rate of liquid stream was 0.7ml/min in most experiments. Water and kerosene evaporators were kept at 800°C and 300°C, respectively. Vaporized kerosene and water streams were then mixed and introduced into the preheater zone of the reactor, which was heated to 800°C and packed with an inert solid. Temperature of the reactor was also kept at 800°C to achieve high conversion of kerosene. Before the reforming tests, the reactor was charged with water vapor at the reaction temperature for about half an hour. Products leaving the reactor were first sent to a condenser to separate excess water. Chemical composition of the gaseous product mixture was determined using an Agilent gas chromatograph. A set of experiments were then performed with steam to carbon molar ratios of 3.89, 4.88 and 5.84 in the feed stream. The kerosene used in this work was commercial JP-8. It has a net heat of combustion value of 43.2MJ/kg. Its flash point is 38°C and density is between 0.775 and 0.840kg/L. It is a mixture of hydrocarbons composed mainly between C12 and C16."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Catalyst characterization results,"3.1 Catalyst characterization results XRD analysis of the synthesized materials clearly showed the presence of NiO, RuO2 and CeO2, in addition to Al2O3 phases. Typical XRD spectra of 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina and 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina are given in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the synthesized materials were all Type IV, indicating that pore structures of these materials were mesoporous with narrow pore size distributions. Typical N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina and 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Surface area values, pore volumes and average pore diameters of the synthesized catalysts are given in Table 1 . Impregnation of ceria, Ni and Ru into the pores of alumina caused reduction in pore volume, as well as in surface area and pore diameter. These results indicated that deposition of the impregnated materials caused some reduction in pore sizes and also some of the pores were blocked, as it would be expected. In spite of closure of some of the pores by active metals, all of these materials still have sufficiently high surface area values for catalytic purposes. A typical SEM image of 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina is shown in Fig. 3 . No large clusters of Ni or Ru oxide were observed on the external surfaces of these materials in the SEM images."
6,Steam reforming of kerosene results,"3.2 Steam reforming of kerosene results Experimental results performed at 800°C with all of the synthesized catalysts indicated complete conversion of JP-8. However, product distributions and hydrogen yield values showed significant variations from catalyst to catalyst and also by changing the H2O/C molar ratio in the feed stream. Typical values of hydrogen percentage (dry basis) values obtained in the product stream for 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina and 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalysts at different H2O/C ratios are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Results indicated that the highest hydrogen yield was obtained with the lowest H2O/C ratio of 3.89. This was an unexpected result and possible reasons of this observation were discussed in the coming paragraphs. Increase of H2O/C ratio is expected to shift WGSR to the products side, increasing CO2 and H2 concentrations. As it is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , increase of CO2 concentration, together with a sharp decrease of CO concentration was observed with an increase in H2O/C ratio, for both 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina and 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalysts. In fact, at a H2O/C ratio of 5.84, CO concentration decreased to a value of less than 0.1%, while CO2 concentration reached about 19% with the 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst. These are expected results considering the thermodynamics of WGSR. Hydrogen concentration was also quite close to the maximum possible hydrogen concentration that could be obtained with a H2O/C feed ratio of 5.84 over this catalyst. On the other hand, H2 concentrations observed with H2O/C=3.89 was higher than the values observed with H2O/C=5.84. This is an unexpected result and cannot be explained by considering only the steam reforming and WGS reactions. In fact, in addition to H2, CO2 and CO, formation of methane and coke were also observed during the reaction. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, methane concentration in the product stream increased with a decrease in H2O/C ratio, for both 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina and 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalysts. In the case of 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina, methane concentration showed an increasing trend during the reaction, reaching a value of 7% at the end of a 10hour reaction period, for H2O/C=3.89. On the other hand, its value was less than 1% and quite stable with H2O/C=5.84 over the same catalyst. In the case of 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina, much less and more stable methane concentrations were observed (Fig. 7b). At the reaction temperature of 800°C, methane formation is expected to be mainly due to decomposition of the hydrocarbon feed stream. In fact, it was also observed that coke formation on the catalyst also increased in parallel to methane formation. Coke formation due to decomposition of kerosene was also expected to increase hydrogen mole fraction in the product stream. C n H 2 n + 2 → n C + n + 1 H 2 Higher hydrogen concentrations observed with lower H2O/C ratio (H2O/C=3.89) were considered to be mainly due to higher coke formation which was caused by decomposition of the hydrocarbon feed. TGA analysis of the used catalysts supported this conclusion, showing negligibly small coke formation with H2O/C=5.84 over 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina, while coke formation was more significant with H2O/C=3.89 on the same catalyst. A typical TGA analysis result of the used 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst, after a 10h reaction period with H2O/C=5.84, is shown in Fig. 8 . Weight loss observed up to 230°C in this figure is due to removal of moisture from the catalyst. It was also found out in a separate experiment that the moisture content of the used catalysts was about 3.8%. The increase of the weight of the sample in the temperature range of 230–500°C is due to the oxidation of Ni of the catalyst to NiO (Fig. 8). Considering that this catalyst contained 15% Ni, the expected weight increase of the catalyst due to oxidation of Ni was estimated as 4.1%. Weight decrease over 500°C is expected to be mainly due to combustion of coke on the catalyst surface. This analysis of the TGA of the used 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst (with H2O/C=5.84) indicated that coke formed on the catalyst was less than 0.3%, while much higher coke formation was observed for H2O/C=3.89. Coke formation also causes catalyst deactivation and instabilities in its performance. Results reported in Fig. 4a and b showed higher H2 mole fractions with the catalyst containing 5% Ni (1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina) as compared to the catalyst containing 15% Ni (1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina). Methane concentrations observed in the product stream were also higher with the 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst as compared to the corresponding values observed with 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina (Fig. 7). Higher methane and coke formation, due to decomposition of hydrocarbon feed over 1% Ru–5% Ni/ceria–alumina also caused instabilities in the performance of this catalyst. In fact, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations observed with this catalyst showed some variations during the 10h reaction period (Figs. 5, 6 and 7, respectively) and they were less stable than the corresponding results obtained with 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina. Results proved that, the most stable operation was obtained with 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst at a H2O/C ratio of 5.84 in the feed stream. As supported by the TGA analysis, coke formation during 10h of reaction period was negligibly small for this case (Fig. 8). In order to compare the catalytic performance of the most stable Ru and Ni impregnated catalytic material (1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina) with the performances of the catalysts containing only Ru (1% Ru/ceria–alumina) or only Ni (15% Ni/ceria–alumina), another set of activity tests were performed with catalysts containing only Ru or only Ni. Hydrogen and CH4 compositions obtained with 1% Ru/ceria–alumina catalyst at different H2O/C feed conditions also indicated a decrease of CH4 formation and an increase of stability with an increase of H2O/C ratio in the feed stream (Fig. 9a and b). Improvements in the stability of the catalyst with an increase of H2O/C ratio was also observed with the 15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst. As shown in Fig. 10a, hydrogen production rate was not significantly affected by the H2O/C ratio in the feed stream with the 15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst. However, improvements in its stability were observed with an increase of this ratio. As shown in Fig. 10b, significant oscillations were observed in the methane concentration over this catalyst, especially at lower H2O/C ratios. Comparisons of the performances of 1% Ru/ceria–alumina and 15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalysts with the catalytic performance of 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina, for the production of H2 and CH4 at a H2O/C mole ratio of 3.89, are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 11, hydrogen production rate was more stable for 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina than both 1% Ru/ceria–alumina and 15% Ni/ceria–alumina, in a reaction period of 10h. Hydrogen production showed an oscillating behavior with 15% Ni/ceria–alumina. Such a behavior was also observed with higher H2O/C ratios in the feed stream (Fig. 10a). Similar oscillations were observed in the CH4 composition of the product stream for the 15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst (Fig. 12). Apparently, modification of 15% Ni/ceria–alumina with 1% Ru caused significant improvement in the stability of this catalyst. In fact, stabilization of Ni based catalysts and elimination of sintering of Ni by addition of small amounts of noble metals, such as Pt, Rh or Ru was also reported in the literature [16,17,20]. As it has also been discussed in the literature, incorporation of small amount of Ru into the structure of Ni based catalysts improved the reducibility of nickel. Reduction temperature of NiO was shown to be significantly decreased by the addition of small amount of Ru [25–27]. Dissociation of hydrogen molecules over the Ru sites and spillover of hydrogen atoms to nickel oxide is expected to facilitate its reduction to metallic nickel during the reaction conditions. Significant improvement of stability of Ni based catalysts as a result of incorporation of small amount of Ru has generally been attributed to this self-activation process, which minimizes oxidation of nickel particles by steam during the reforming reaction [26,27]. Similar conclusions for the improvement of reducibility of cobalt by the addition of small amount of Ru were also reported for Ru–Co based catalysts used in steam reforming of methane [15]. It was also reported in the literature that formation of bi-metallic Ni–Ru clusters improved Ni dispersion, which helped coke minimization and more stable catalytic performance [24,28]. Activity of the catalyst containing only 1% Ru was also very high. However, it caused significant amount of methane (Fig. 12) and coke formation due to decomposition of the hydrocarbon feed stream. In fact, TGA analysis of the used 1% Ru/ceria–alumina showed about 7% coke deposition on the catalyst surface after a reaction period of 10h (Fig. 13 ). All of these results proved that the performance of the bi-metallic catalyst, containing 1% Ru and 15% Ni, was the best, in terms of catalyst stability and coke minimization. Characterization results of the used catalysts also supported this conclusion. In fact, decrease of the surface area and pore volume values of 1% Ru–15% Ni/ceria–alumina catalyst as a result of coke formation during the course of reaction of 10h were quite small (Table 2 ). There was essentially no change in pore volume after 10h of reaction time. As it was discussed above, TGA analysis of the used catalysts had also proved negligible coke formation over this catalyst."
7,Concluding remarks,"Results of this work proved that bi-metallic Ru–Ni containing ceria–alumina supported catalysts were more stable than mono-metallic catalysts containing only Ni or Ru, in the reforming reaction of kerosene. Among the bi-metallic catalysts containing both Ru and Ni, the one which was synthesized by impregnating 15% Ni and 1% Ru into a mesoporous alumina support, which contained 5% ceria, gave the most stable performance. Besides being more stable than the others, methane formation and coking were also minimum with this catalytic material. Improvement of catalytic stability of Ni based catalysts as a result of incorporation of small amount of Ru into their structure has been attributed to the improvement of reducibility of nickel. Improvements in catalyst stability were also observed with an increase in H2O/C ratio in the feed stream. Best results were obtained with a H2O/C feed ratio of 5.84. Results of this work also proved that high hydrogen yields could be obtained by steam reforming of kerosene, producing a synthesis gas which might be used as a fuel in solid oxide fuel cells."
