0,Introduction,"Graphene as a two-dimensional carbon material, owing to its excellent thermal, mechanical and electrical performances, has shown great potential for applications in high performance supercapacitors [1–3], energy [4,5], photoelectric technology [6,7] and catalysis [8–10]. It is generally known that graphene oxide (GO) is the common precursor for the synthesis of graphene via chemical reduction or thermal annealing [11,12]. Moreover, functional groups (such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy group) [13,14] and defects on the surface of GO, which are generated in the oxidation process, may efficiently act as anchoring sites for deposition of metal nanoparticles [15]. Recently, graphene-supported metal composites have been explored and shown great potential in some catalytic reactions. Yan et al. [16] presented the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene with a catalyst of atomically dispersed Pd on graphene, giving about 100% butenes selectivity at 95% conversion. Metin et al. [17] developed FePd alloy nanoparticles assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a catalyst for selective transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines. Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a pivotal reaction in chemistry and chemical industry fields [18–20], because the corresponding benzaldehyde is an important intermediate of medicine, dyestuff and perfume [21]. In addition, aldehydic carbonyl, as one of the crucial activity groups in organic synthesis, could participate in oxidation, reduction, condensation and kinds of cross coupling reactions. However, the particular oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol in the industrial production is limited seriously by several problems related to cost, post-treatment, recovering and recycling of the homogeneous catalysts as well as environmental pollution. Based on this fact, in recent years, considerable efforts have been made to explore new reaction systems using environmentally friendly and low-cost O2 as oxidant for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and works related to the use of metal nanoparticles and metal-based composites were reported [22–24]. Recently, noble metal nanoparticles were found to exhibit high activity for alcohol oxidation using O2 under mild conditions [25,26]. Nevertheless, considering the high cost and aggregation of noble metals, it would be desirable to develop non-noble metal catalysts on proper carriers to effect alcohol oxidation. In our previous work, we have developed copper-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols in the absence of base [27]. In this work, we report that Cu nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and after synthesized by a facile one-pot coreduction route appears as an efficient, easily retrieved and recycled catalyst for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aldehydes in water using O2 as green oxidant."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of GO sheets,2.1 Preparation of GO sheets GO solution was synthesized by the oxidation of natural graphite power using the modified Hummers method [28]. The detailed preparation procedure is given in Supporting information.
3,Synthesis of Cu@rGO,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu@rGO 10mL of Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.001M) aqueous solution was added into a diluted GO (4mgmL−1) aqueous dispersion under stirring in order to obtain a uniform dispersion of Cu2+ and GO sheets. After fully mixing, 5mL sodium borohydride (NaBH4) aqueous solution (0.5molmL−1) was slowly added to the dispersion at room temperature with constant stirring. The final product (Cu@rGO) was collected by filtration, washing with water, and lyophilization. The Cu nanoparticles supported on activated carbon (Cu@AC) were synthesized by the same method."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS were performed to characterize the as-prepared Cu@rGO samples. The experimental details about the use of these characterization techniques are given in Supporting information."
5,Typical procedure for alcohol oxidation,"2.4 Typical procedure for alcohol oxidation A mixture of catalyst, TEMPO and water (1.5mL) were taken in a 25mL round bottomed flask and 0.5mL benzyl alcohol was added by a syringe. To the above system O2 was introduced in. Under oxygen balloon, the mixture was stirred for 10h at 80°C. The flask was cooled down to room temperature and the mixture was filtered to remove the solid catalyst and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was analyzed by an Agilent 7890 series gas chromatograph (GC) to determine the product and reactant concentrations. All reaction products were confirmed by GC-MS as well as by comparing the retention times to respective standards in GC traces."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of Cu@rGO,"3.1 Characterization of Cu@rGO The power X-ray diffraction patterns of GO, rGO and Cu@rGO are shown in Fig. 1 . The typical reflection peak (002) of GO appears at 2θ=11° with high intensity, indicating the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite after oxidation. After reduction, the characteristic peak disappeared in the rGO and Cu@rGO, and it was replaced by the peak around 2θ=23.2°, demonstrating that GO as support material was reduced during reduction of copper by NaBH4, and the process of reducing copper and the surface oxygen groups were removed partially. Besides, the diffraction peaks of Cu@rGO at 2θ=43.4 and 50.6° are consistent with the Cu 〈111〉 and 〈200〉 crystal planes, respectively [29,30]. The above results suggest that Cu@rGO nanocomposites are successfully synthesized. The corresponding TEM images of the rGO and Cu@rGO are given in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The graphene sheets were transparent films with crumpling on the surface. Obviously, the typical wrinkle structure still existed from the image of Cu@rGO, which indicates the reduction process only reduced the oxygen functional groups without destroying the layered structure. Moreover, a number of Cu nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of the rGO. It was found that the obtained Cu nanoparticles had a size distribution in the 20–56nm range with an average particle size of 36nm (Fig. S1). The result is also consistent with the SEM image shown in Fig. S2. XPS was used to further analyze the surface elemental composition of Cu@rGO catalyst (Fig. 3 ). The surface Cu amount in the XPS data is 58.1wt% and the total Cu loading is 56.2wt% detected by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis (Table S1). The survey spectrum of Cu@rGO is shown in Fig. 3(a). The peak of O 1s might represent the residual oxygen of rGO, whereas the Cu 2p (933.0eV) is observed. In addition, different valence states of copper (Cu0 and Cu2+) were detected in the Cu@rGO composite (Fig. 3(b)) but the main species is Cu0 (87.2%). This is likely to be due to the incomplete reduction of Cu2+, without excluding the possibility that some Cu particles in the composite were re-oxidized due to their exposure to air [31]. It should be noted that tiny amounts of Cu2+ (only 12.8%) existed on the surface of rGO, consistent to the fact that no characteristic diffraction peak for CuO was found in the XRD pattern of Cu@rGO."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The activity of Cu@rGO catalyst for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water is summarized in Table 1 . In the absence of a catalyst, only 2.1% (entry 1) of the substrate was oxidized, indicating initiators were very difficult to catalyze this reaction without any catalyst. Additionally, metal-free loaded GO exhibited low catalytic activity (9.3%, entry 2) although the benzaldehyde selectivity was 95.2%. As can be seen, Cu@rGO gave satisfactory catalytic activity (97.1%, entry 3) and high selectivity toward benzaldehyde (98.7%) after 10h. When the reaction time was prolonged to 16h, the conversion of benzyl alcohol reached the value of 99% (entry 5), with the selectivity remaining as high as 98.6%. Besides, when the amount of substrate was increased to 15mmol, the conversion was 94.1% (entry 6) and no significant decrease in the selectivity to benzaldehyde was observed. In order to understand the role of TEMPO, the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out with Cu@rGO in the absence of TEMPO. It could be seen that the reaction gave only 34.3% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 76.8% selectivity of benzaldehyde (entry 7), indicating that the addition of TEMPO can improve the activity and selectivity of Cu@rGO for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Furthermore, to study the impact of support, the activity of Cu@AC was also measured. The conversion of benzyl alcohol only reached 64.4% and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 93.1% (entry 4). The results indicate that rGO plays an important role as support of copper and the high activity of Cu@rGO is caused by synergistic effects between Cu and rGO. Fig. S3 displays the influence of reaction temperature on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over the Cu@rGO catalyst. It is observed that the conversion of benzyl alcohol (18.6%~97.1%) increased sharply with increasing temperature up to 80°C. However, when the temperature was higher than 80°C, the conversion increased slightly, while the selectivity showed a slight decline due to side reactions caused by high temperature. Therefore, the optimum temperature for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was 80°C. The effect of reaction time on the catalytic performance was studied during the time interval of 4–16h at 80°C (Fig. S4). The conversion of benzyl alcohol is increased gradually from 34.4% to 96.8% as the reaction time increases (4–10h). When the reaction time was prolonged to 16h, the substrate could hardly be detected. In contrast, selectivities in all instances are >95%, demonstrating that the rate of side reaction is less affected by the reaction time. The selective oxidation of various benzyl alcohols with different substituents was also investigated (Table 2 ). The aldehyde products could be readily isolated in all cases and alcohols could be oxidized within 10h. This indicated that the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde was not relevant to the kinds and position of substituents in benzene ring. In addition, for the oxidation of para-substituted, ortho-substituted and meta-substituted benzyl alcohols, the Cu@rGO could achieve satisfactory catalytic effects with nearly 90% conversions (Table 2, entries 2–6). Besides, the substrates which were substituted with electron-donating groups OCH3 and OH gave only ~4% higher conversion than that obtained after substitution with electron-withdrawing groups: Cl, F and NO2, while the selectivities to carbonyl compounds were all above 95% (Table 2, entries 3–7). The selectivity of disubstituted benzyl alcohol was the lowest with 76.3% and this result might have been caused by excessive oxidation, which generate by-products, such as aromatic acid and ester, due to the two electron donating groups of OH and OCH3 (Table 2, entry 9). The recycled experiment of the catalyst was evaluated on the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The Cu@rGO catalyst was reused five times under the same reaction conditions after separation from the previous reaction mixture by filtration and washing thoroughly with ethanol and drying. Fig. S5 shows the results of reusability of Cu@rGO composite. Up to five runs, the conversion and selectivity of benzyl alcohol oxidation decreased slightly due to the slight loss of catalyst mass in the catalyst recycling study. Additionally, the XRD pattern and surface morphology of the recycled composite is shown in Fig. S6. The peak of Cu phase could be easily observed and the morphology was not significantly changed after used for five consecutive times."
9,Conclusions,"We found that Cu@rGO composite synthesized by a facile reduction method showed high catalytic activity (ca. 97% conversion) for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde with O2 under mild conditions without using any organic solvents. Combined both the efficiency of a homogeneous catalyst and the durability of a heterogeneous catalyst, the present Cu@rGO composite shows great potential that could be used effectively to support other metal nanoparticles, thus providing more opportunities for designing new catalysts toward selective oxidation of benzyl related reactions."
