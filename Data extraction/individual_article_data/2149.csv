0,Introduction,"The first evidence of olive tree cultivation has been traced to about 5000–6000years ago in the eastern Mediterranean basin. From there it expanded to all the Mediterranean countries, which are presently responsible for 95% of worldwide olive oil production [1]. Today, olive tree cultivation covers 9.4 million ha and produces 16Mt of olives processed into 2.6Mt of oil. The main byproducts of olive oil production are the residual semi-solid matter of the olive pulp after oil removal (pomace), twigs and leaves, and olive mill wastewater (OMW). Although OMW is characterized by a seasonal production (Oct.–Dec.) of moderate extent (approximately 30Mm3 per year) compared to other agricultural wastes, its environmental impact is very high. In fact, the presence of phenolic compounds and long-chain fatty acids gives this wastewater both high resistance to biodegradation and high phytotoxicity [2]. OMW is characterized by its strong chemical oxygen demand (COD) and bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD); the pollution effect of 1m3 of OMW has been estimated to be equivalent to that of 200m3 of domestic sewage [3]. Several physico-chemical and biological processes studied for treating OMW have exhibited limited effectiveness [4–7]. Land disposal under relatively controlled conditions is still the most common practice; however, it can result in the contamination of soil and water bodies [4]. Taking a different approach, OMW can be deemed as a biomass to be valued instead of as a waste to be treated before discharge. Phenolic compounds of OMW have strong antioxidant effects that can lead to potential health benefits by reducing heart disease and cancer risks [8,9]. Generally, porous ceramic and polymeric membranes have been used for the fractionation of OMW through ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis [10,11]. Integrated physico-chemical–biotechnological processes have been also studied, in which, after removing the polyphenols by adsorption on resins, wastewater has been treated in an anaerobic bioreactor that converts the organic leftover into volatile fatty acids [12]. However, recovery of phenol compounds for the food and pharmaceutical industry can be performed only with OMW coming from biological olive oil production that is a small percentage of the total production. This is because the presence of very low residuals of pesticides or other chemicals in the phenols extracted from OMW is not compatible with the requirements of the food or pharmaceutical industry. In order to increase the value of wastewater, recent research has investigated thermochemical processes aimed at recovering energy from OMW. Based on its enhanced solvent properties, supercritical water has been proposed for the gasification of OMW in order to recover a gaseous stream mainly composed of methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide [13]. In previous work, our group has studied the reforming of concentrated OMW at 450°C in a Pd-based membrane reactor capable of producing pure hydrogen (permeate stream) and hydrogen-rich gas (retentate stream) [14]. In such a device, high hydrogen yields can be attained using a membrane selective to hydrogen coupled with a catalyst promoting dehydrogenation reactions. In fact, the continuous removal of one reaction product (the hydrogen) allows values of the reaction conversion to be attained that can overcome those imposed by the thermodynamic equilibrium, accordingly to the well-known “shift effect” of the membrane [15]. Thin-walled Pd–Ag membrane tubes having complete hydrogen selectivity and good permeability have been developed at ENEA Frascati laboratories [16]. These Pd-membranes have been successfully tested in long-term experiments for both purifying hydrogen from other gases and for producing ultra-pure hydrogen from dehydrogenation reactions [17,18]. In this work, a Pd-membrane reactor using a noble metals based catalyst was tested. The experimental results were compared with those obtained on a commercial Pt-based catalyst used in previous work [14]."
1,Experimental,"Tests were conducted on wastewater samples collected from a pressure olive mill located in the Frascati area in Autumn 2013. Before feeding the Pd-membrane reactor, the OMW was pretreated and characterized. Because of its high water content, the OMW had to be concentrated in order to meet the water/organics ratio that optimized the production of hydrogen via thermochemical processes."
2,OMW pre-treatment and characterization,"2.1 OMW pre-treatment and characterization After filtration, the olive mill wastewater had a density of 1.002kgL−1 and a pH of 4.95. Then, the wastewater was distillated to separate the fraction rich in water and a semi-solid residue, representing about 40 and 3wt% of the filtered OMW, respectively. The other fractions were mixed in order to obtain the distillate used for feeding the membrane reactor. The distillate was characterized in terms of pH, total phenols, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). Table 1 reports the characteristics of the OMW distillates used in this work and in previous work [14]. Total phenols determination was conducted according to APHA standard method 5550 B, using the Folin–Ciocalteau reagent. This method is sensitive to any compound containing an aromatic hydroxyl group [19]. The calibration curve was developed by preparing the standards at increasing concentrations of phenol (C6H5OH), using pure phenol in crystals from Carlo Erba Reagenti. Therefore, the results were obtained in terms of mg equivalents of phenol per liter. Folin–Ciocalteau reagent was purchased from Carlo Erba Reagenti. Sodium tartrate, sodium carbonate, and sodium sulphate anhydrous were acquired from Sigma Aldrich. Spectrophotometric measures were acquired by means of a Photolab 6600 UV–Vis spectrophotometer from WTW. The COD analysis was performed by the closed reflux standard method followed by spectrophotometric determination according to APHA ASTM standard methods. The spectrophotometer was a WTW Photolab 6600 UV–Vis. TOC was measured using an OI Analytical AURORA 1030W TOC Analyzer set in TC-TIC mode. In this specific mode, the TOC is calculated by the difference between the total carbon (TC), detected after degradation with 10% sodium persulfate (Carlo Erba Reagenti), and the total inorganic carbon (TIC), detected after acidification by the addition of 5% concentrated phosphoric acid (Carlo Erba Reagenti)."
3,Catalyst,"2.2 Catalyst The noble metals based catalyst, supplied by University of Salerno, consists of Al2O3 pellets coated with a CeO2–ZrO2 layer. The typical washcoating and impregnation procedures from aqueous solution was followed. The overall active species (platinum, rhodium and palladium) loading is lower than 3wt%. CeO2–ZrO2 mixed solutions display several benefits which justify their use for reforming reactions. Oxidation reactions, and water gas shift in particular, are enhanced by the high oxygen mobility which is also linked to the enhanced coke formation resistance and sintering phenomena prevention [20]. Moreover, marked thermal stability is assured by these layers to the final catalyst [21]. The noble metals based sample, once tested for OMW steam reforming, was characterized through thermogravimetric (TGA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) analyses, in order to study coke formation on catalytic surface. The analysis was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer Q600, TA Instrument, coupled with PFEIFFER ThermoStar Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. It was also used the instrument SEM–EDX analyzer mod. INCA Energy 350, Oxford Instruments. All the apparatus has been operated under vacuum (10−4–10−6 mbar) through a ionic pump, in order to reduce the interactions between electrons and gaseous molecules."
4,Pd-membrane reformer,"2.3 Pd-membrane reformer The membrane reformer consisted of a Pd-permeator tube filled with 4.8g of the noble metals based catalyst. The permeator was manufactured at the ENEA Frascati laboratories by joining a dense Pd–Ag (with Ag 23wt%) membrane tube to two stainless steel tubes at its ends. Table 2 describes the geometry of the Pd–Ag tube and compares it with that of a membrane having similar characteristics (area and wall thickness) used in previous work [14]. The permeator was assembled into a Pyrex shell in a finger-like configuration. This allowed for the free elongation/contraction of the membrane tube, thus avoiding any mechanical stress and ensuring its long life [17]."
5,Experimental setup,"2.4 Experimental setup The membrane module was characterized in both permeation and reaction tests in an experimental setup in which the liquid and gaseous streams have been measured under temperature- and pressure-controlled conditions. First, the permeator was characterized in permeation tests that measured the hydrogen permeated through the membrane and collected in the shell side by a nitrogen purge stream. Then in the reactions tests, the OMW distillate was fed into the membrane lumen while the permeate (the pure hydrogen permeated through the membrane) and retentate (hydrogen-rich mixture) were analyzed to verify the performance of the reformer. The gas phase of the retentate was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (mod. Agilent 7820) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID): the average error of these measurements was 2%. GC analyses were also performed on the permeated stream in order to measure the hydrogen concentration in the sweep gas. The liquid phase of the retentate was analyzed for total phenols, COD, and TOC, as described in the previous section. Further details of the membrane reformer design and of the experimental apparatus were reported elsewhere [14]."
6,Results and discussion,"OMW is a solution of organic compounds (oils, alcohols, sugars) in water. Accordingly, several thermochemical processes may occur when the OMW distillate is treated at high temperature. In a membrane reactor, the presence of a Pd-membrane selective to hydrogen promotes the dehydrogenation reactions and, together with the selectivity of the catalyst, can address the pyrolysis and cracking processes along different reaction patterns. In the following, we consider some reactions that are of interest based on the results of the reaction tests. In a simplified way, the reactions involving alcohols, in particular ethanol, are: – the steam reforming of a generic alcohol (1) C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( n - 1 ) H 2 O = n CO + 2 n H 2 Δ H > 0 – the water gas shift (WGS) reaction (2) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = - 41 kJ mol - 1 – the steam reforming of a generic alcohol coupled with the WGS: (3) C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( 2 n - 1 ) H 2 O = n CO 2 + 3 n H 2 Δ H > 0 – the hydrogenolysis of ethanol to methane (4) C 2 H 5 OH + 2 H 2 = 2 CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H = - 157 kJ mol - 1 – the cracking of ethanol to methane and CO2 (5) C 2 H 5 OH = 0.5 CO 2 + 1.5 CH 4 Δ H = - 74 kJ mol - 1 – the cracking of ethanol to methane, CO, and H2 (6) C 2 H 5 OH = CO + CH 4 + H 2 Δ H = + 49 kJ mol - 1 – the cracking of ethanol to carbon, methane, and water (7) C 2 H 5 OH = CH 4 + C + H 2 O Δ H = - 82 kJ mol - 1 – the equilibrium among carbon, CO, and CO2 (Boudouard reaction) (8) 2 CO = CO 2 + C Δ H = - 172 kJ mol - 1 Especially, the Boudouard reaction and the cracking reactions could be responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst due to carbon deposition. The hydrogen production by the membrane reformer is evaluated through the hydrogen yield and hydrogen recovery. The hydrogen yield measures the amount of hydrogen produced from a given amount of organic matter fed to the membrane reactor, and it depends on both the reaction and permeation kinetics. In this work, it was assessed as the weight percent of hydrogen produced and permeated through the membrane per a given amount of fed TOC: (9) HY ( wt % ) = H 2 perm TOC fed × 100 where H2perm is the mass flow rate of the hydrogen collected in the shell side of the membrane reformer (gh−1), and TOCfed is the total organic carbon fed with the intermediate distillate of the olive mill wastewater (gh−1). The average error of HY assessment was 0.75%. The hydrogen recovery describes the effectiveness of the membrane in separating the hydrogen produced by the reaction, as well as its capability of promoting the reaction conversion through the “shift effect.” The hydrogen recovery is given by the permeated fraction of all of the hydrogen produced: (10) H 2 rec = H 2 perm H 2 perm + H 2 ret × 100 where H2ret is the flow rate of the hydrogen leaving the reactor with the retentate stream. In this case, H2perm and H2ret can be expressed as mass or molar flow rates. In both the permeation and reaction tests, the membrane selectivity was verified in two ways: through leak tests conducted by pressuring the membrane lumen with nitrogen and through GC analysis of the permeate stream."
7,Permeation tests,"3.1 Permeation tests These tests were performed in the temperature range 250–450°C by feeding pure hydrogen into the membrane lumen at 100–600kPa. The permeated hydrogen was collected in the shell side at 100kPa by a nitrogen stream with a flow rate in the range 3.72×10−5–1.49×10−4 mols−1. The hydrogen permeability was assessed by assuming the validity of Sieverts’ law, which establishes the dependence of the hydrogen permeation flux from the hydrogen partial pressure through a pressure exponent equal to 0.5 [15]. The permeability values measured at the different temperatures have been interpolated according to Arrhenius’ law: (11) Pe = Pe 0 e - Ea RT where Pe is the hydrogen permeability (molm−1 s−1 Pa−0.5), Pe0 is the permeability pre-exponential coefficient, Ea is the activation energy (Jmol−1), R is the gas constant (8.314Jmol−1 K−1), and T is the absolute temperature (K). The values Pe0 =2.36×10−8 molm−1 s−1 Pa−0.5 and Ea =2106.8Jmol−1 were obtained from the permeation test."
8,Reaction tests,"3.2 Reaction tests The reaction tests were conducted by feeding OMW distillate into the lumen of the membrane reactor at 450°C. Three values of OMW flow rate, corresponding to 10, 15, and 20gh−1, were fed into the reactor lumen together with 7.5×10−6, 1.12×10−5, and 1.50×10−5 mols−1 of nitrogen as a carrier gas, respectively. The corresponding space velocities for the three values of feed flow rates were 1.16×10−2, 1.74×10−2, and 2.32×10−2 molh−1 g cat - 1 . The tests were conducted at three values of lumen pressure (100, 300, and 500kPa), while the shell side of the membrane reactor was purged by 3.75×10−4 mols−1 of nitrogen at 100kPa. The catalyst exhibited no significant loss of activity after 6–8h of operation as verified by the constant hydrogen production during each test. In fact, the oxygen storage and release capacity (OSC), typical of rare earth oxides such as ceria-zirconia, promotes the gasification of coke precursors compounds, thus limiting the deactivation phenomena [22]. Moreover, when supports with high oxygen mobility are employed, Rh can exhibit improved catalytic stability during reforming reactions [23], low Pt loadings (<1%) are sufficient for limiting deactivation phenomena [24] and Pd can show an excellent stability even at very low steam to carbon ratios [25]. Table 3 shows the hydrogen recovery and the hydrogen yield measured during the reaction tests performed at 10gh−1 (1.16×10−2 molh−1 g cat - 1 ), 15gh−1 (1.74×10−2 molh−1 g cat - 1 ), and 20gh−1 (2.32×10−2 molh−1 g cat - 1 ). Changing the pressure from 100 to 500kPa results in an increase in the hydrogen recovery due to the increase of the permeation driving force which drags more hydrogen to the permeate side. The hydrogen yield exhibits the same behavior as the hydrogen recovery. In fact, the hydrogen yield measures the permeated amount of hydrogen produced by dehydrogenation reactions. The increase in pressure and subsequently in the permeation driving force positively affects both the hydrogen production, according to the well-known “shift effect” of the membrane, and the hydrogen permeation, as seen previously in the analysis of the hydrogen recovery behavior. The effect of the feed flow rate (and, as a consequence, of SV) on the hydrogen yield is very modest, while it is evident that passing from 10 to 20gh−1 the hydrogen recovery reduces by approximately 15% at 100kPa and 10% at 500kPa. Such a feature should indicate that the membrane reactor used in the experiment is limited by permeation kinetics (Damkohler–Peclet number larger than 1); an optimization of the reactor would require an increase of the membrane permeance (i.e. increase of the permeation area, reduction of the thickness, etc.) [26]. The gas-chromatographic analysis of the retentate is reported in Table 4 . In all these tests, a negligible amount of methane (less than 0.5%) was detected, thus demonstrating the good selectivity of the catalyst. The hydrogen concentration in the retentate gas phase decreases with the pressure; in fact, the higher the pressure, the higher the permeation driving force that pulls more hydrogen to the permeate side. By increasing the feed flow rate, the hydrogen concentration in the retentate rises. Finally, a theoretical study was carried out in order to verify the absence of mass transfer limitations. The catalytic reaction takes place after reactant molecules diffuse through the fluid layer surrounding the catalyst particles (external diffusion or film diffusion), and then through the pores within the catalyst particle (internal diffusion). For the catalysts employed in the present work, the internal diffusion is supposed to be very fast because this phenomenon occurred only in a very thin layer of washcoat surrounding the pellets. In order to theoretically check the presence of external transfer limitations [34], the following equation (Eq. (12)), in which characteristic times of reaction and external diffusion are compared (Mears criterion), was verified: (12) N M = n ∗ - r A C ab ∗ r p ε k ′ ≪ 0.15 NM is the Mears number, n the reaction order, −rA the reaction rate (molm−3 s−1), Cab the bulk concentration (molm−3), rp the mean catalyst particle sizes (m), ε the void fraction of the catalytic bed and k′ the mass transfer coefficient (m/s). In the present study, the Mears number was found almost one order of magnitude lower than the limit value and, therefore, the external diffusion resistance can be neglected. In conclusion, the membrane process studied here has demonstrated strong effectiveness in abating the pollution potential of the OMW. Table 5 shows the results of the analysis of the liquid phase of the retentate stream. The phenols, COD, and TOC are reduced to a few percent of the values present in the feed stream (see Table 1). In the worst case, at a feed flow rate of 20gh−1, the concentration of the total phenols is reduced to 7%, and that of TOC reduced to 10%, of the values present in the feed stream."
9,Characterization of the exhaust catalyst,"3.3 Characterization of the exhaust catalyst Pt–Pd–Rh catalyst after the time-on-stream-tests was characterized in order to evaluate the coke formation tendency of the system. The carbon formation was investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed under an air flow stream in the temperature range 25–850°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. In Fig. 1 , TGA results in the temperature range 300–750°C are reported: this clear weight variation can be linked to carbonaceous deposits oxidation. The first weight loss observed at low temperatures (not reported in figure) was due to water evaporation. On the basis of TGA analysis, the coke yield Yc (Eq. (13)) was calculated: (13) Y c = mol coke mol carbon fed It was found that only 1.2% of the fed carbon was responsible for coke formation. The coke formation tendency of the system was compared with the values reported in the recent literature, as shown in Table 6 . However, very few studies dealt with olive mill wastewater reforming. Therefore, the stability of noble metals based sample was evaluated by reviewing steam reforming of alcohols, oils and sugars mixtures over different catalysts. It is noteworthy that coke formation rates lower than the ones found in our study are observable only at higher temperatures or by feeding a less complex stream (i.e. in the case of single alcohols steam reforming). Oxygenated compounds, in fact, at relatively low temperatures can easily decompose, forming mainly carbonaceous deposits on catalysts surface. The bimetallic catalyst used in this work, although tested at low temperature, was effective to limit this phenomenon. The reduced carbon formation on bimetallic sample was also confirmed by the results of the SEM–EDX analysis performed on the Pt–Rh–Pd sample after catalytic tests. In Figs. 2 and 3 , the SEM–EDX images of fresh and exhausts bimetallic catalyst are reported, respectively. Regarding the fresh sample, a good dispersion of active species (Rh and Pt) on catalytic support was observed from EDX analysis, while, within the detection limits of EDX, no information about Pd dispersion could be recorded. SEM–EDX analysis also confirmed a modest presence of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface."
10,Catalysts comparison,"3.4 Catalysts comparison The new noble metals based catalyst is compared with the commercial Pt-based (Pt 1wt% on alumina, BASF SP-01 T) catalyst used in a previous experiment under similar operating conditions (pressure and temperature, OMW feed composition characteristics of the Pd–Ag membrane tube) [18]. First, the new catalyst exhibits good durability: after 6–8h of operation no significant loss of activity was observed, whereas the Pt-based catalyst activity reduced drastically after 1–2h of testing. The difference in the catalysts’ stability can be primarily ascribed to the support used. As the commercial catalyst is supported on Al2O3, the oxide acidity favors ethanol dehydrogenation reactions which are responsible for ethylene formation. C2H4 can easily polymerize, becoming the main coke precursor [35]. Conversely, in the case of the novel catalyst, the redox properties of support promoted oxidation reactions and catalyst cleaning. The catalyst comparison, based on the results of tests conducted with a feed flow rate of 15gh−1, is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . Fig. 4 shows that the new catalyst at 300 and 500kPa exhibits slightly higher hydrogen yields than the Pt-based catalyst. This behavior can be explained by the higher selectivity of the new catalyst, which produces less methane and more hydrogen. The higher hydrogen yields are achieved at higher pressures (300 and 500kPa) when the permeation driving force can pull most of the hydrogen to the permeate stream. Fig. 5 reports the gas concentrations of the retentate. The Pt-based catalyst produced methane at concentrations of 8–14%, while a negligible presence of methane was detected (less than 0.5%) with the new catalyst. The very low selectivity of Pt–Rh–Pd catalyst toward CH4 formation can be related to its intrinsic higher reforming activity. In particular, Pd supported over oxides with high OSC ensured very high CH4 steam reforming rates and the activity of Pt, Rh and Pd towards this reaction was shown to be strongly promoted in the presence of rare earth metals [36]. The amounts of CO2 present for the cases of the two catalysts are very similar, while the differences in the hydrogen concentrations are due practically to the formation of methane with the use of the new catalyst. Finally, the new catalyst has been more effective than the Pt-based catalyst for reducing the pollution potential of the OMW. In tests with the Pt-based catalyst, the total phenols content of the feed stream was reduced in the retentate by approximately 60%, while the new catalyst allowed a reduction in the phenols of the OMW to less than 10%. In fact, the synergistic action of the different noble metals is responsible for the very high activity towards the CC bonds phenol breaking. Moreover the dissociation of hydroxyl ring group is promoted by the OSC of the support [37], thus resulting in lower phenol concentration in the retentate with respect to the alumina based sample."
11,Conclusions,"OMW is an agricultural waste having a significant environmental impact in the Mediterranean countries that produce the most olive oil worldwide. In this work, thermochemical treatments conducted in a Pd-membrane reactor were investigated for their ability to recover pure hydrogen and hydrogen-rich gas mixtures from OMW. In particular, a Pt–Rh–Pd based catalyst supported on rare earth oxides was tested in order to verify its capability of maximizing the hydrogen yield and reducing side reactions. As a main result, this work verified the following capabilities of the studied membrane process: – The production of hydrogen from waste (up to 3.25kg of hydrogen per ton of OMW). – A reduction in the pollution potential of the OMW (phenols and TOC concentrations are reduced by about 90%). Compared to a commercial Pt-based catalyst tested in previous experiments, the novel catalyst showed higher selectivity toward the reforming reaction, allowing a significant reduction in the formation of methane and coke and thus exhibiting a higher hydrogen yield and higher durability. In fact, in all tests, methane concentrations below 0.5% were detected in the retentate stream, while no significant loss of catalyst activity was observed after 6–8h of operation. The very low selectivity of noble metals based catalyst toward CH4 formation was related to its intrinsic high reforming activity."
