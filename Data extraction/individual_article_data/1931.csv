0,Introduction,"Recently, interest in developing biofuels has been growing vastly worldwide owing to the menace of universal climatic alteration and the contraction of oil reserves, which are steadily depleting. At the same time, energy demand rises, along with persistent high oil prices. Although many alternative biofuels have been introduced, such as biomethane, bioethanol, biogasoline, and biokerosene [1], liquid biodiesel such as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and green diesel are becoming progressively essential, as they have the potential to be produced by the present refinery infrastructure. Triglycerides and their derivatives of fatty acids are the prime components of animal fats and vegetable oils as well as excellent renewable resources for green diesel production because of ease to alter them into liquid transport fuels. For instance, the transesterification of triglycerides or fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is an important and eminent pathway to convert vegetable oils into diesel fuels [2]. However, there are worries regarding FAME as they cannot entirely displace fossil fuels (hydrocarbon-based fuel) due to their high oxygen content, which makes FAMEs have a lower energy density and less oxidation stability comparing to petroleum diesel. Moreover, the use of FAMEs in modern diesel engines causes many technical issues such as clogged filters, the corrosion of engine metal parts, and the build-up of sediments in fuel pumps resulting from the chemicals used during transesterification. Due to these reasons, green diesel (an oxy-free hydrocarbon-like fuel) would solve the instability issue of FAMEs [3]. Green diesel is currently produced through advanced technologies, for example, catalytic cracking reaction, hydrotreatment, hydrodeoxygenation, and deoxygenation reactions. The obtained green diesel exhibits similar properties to the petroleum diesel; for example, the oxygen content is almost zero with a high cetane number [4]. From an economic point of view, deoxygenation is beneficial because it cuts the costs related to the utilisation of H2 in the hydrodeoxygenation process. In general, the deoxygenation of fatty acids is performed through two major reaction pathways to produce green diesel [5], i.e., decarbonylation and decarboxylation (deCOx), whereby (i) the decarbonylation (DCO) pathway involves the elimination of carbonyl groups through CC and CO bond scission to produce straight-chain alkenes by releasing CO and water as by-products (Eq. (1)), and (ii) the decarboxylation (DCO2) pathway, which involves the elimination of carboxylic groups through CC bond scission and the liberation of CO2 to produce a straight-chain alkane with one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid (Eq. (2)) Decarbonylation pathway (1) R − COOH → R ′ − CH = CH 2 + CO g + H 2 O Decarboxylation pathway (2) R − COOH → R − H + CO 2 g R, R′ = alkyl groups Recently, many researchers have intensively studied catalytic deoxygenation reaction by using different kinds of solid acid catalysts involving noble metals, metal sulphides, metal phosphides, metal carbides [6,7], and d-block metal oxides supported on different oxide materials (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2.). The noble metal-based catalysts (using Pd or Pt) exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the deoxygenation reaction and produce a high yield of hydrocarbon components [8]. Still, the high price of noble metal catalysts prevents their use in industry. Sulfonated acidic catalysts exhibit a high tendency towards the production of hydrocarbon components, but the obtained green diesel suffers from sulphur leaching that simultaneously affects the quality of the fuel [9]. Previous studies indicate that the application of moderate acidity catalysts such as Ni/HZSM-5 [10], ZSM-5 [11], SBA-15 [12] have been applied mainly for the deoxygenation reaction. Yet, this kind of acid catalyst is likely to be responsible for the drastic degradation of catalyst active sites owing to coke deposition [13]. Hence, enhancing catalyst stability is required. Recent investigations have assessed the use of basic metal catalysts in the deoxygenation reaction to reduce coke formation compared to acidic catalysts. However, basic catalysts have high cracking activity and are less effective in the deCOx reaction, thereby yielding significant amounts of light hydrocarbon components. Hence, the coupling of basic and acidic metals (in the form of binary metal oxide) is vital for producing acid-base characteristics that simultaneously inhibit unselective cracking activity and facilitate deCOx pathways [14]. Several studies have demonstrated that transition metal oxides (TMO) incorporating Mo [15], Co [16], and Ni [17] possess acid-base characteristics in a binary; the synergy of Mo and Co exhibits optimum acid-base properties. One study recorded a successful improvement in acid-base properties of a catalyst by the impregnation of Co on AC attained from the trash coconut shell. The Co/AC effectively stimulated the deoxygenation of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and yielded a 91% green diesel (C8-C20) product [18]. Similarly, Krobkrong et al. studied the deoxygenation of oleic acid exclusively in an inert environment over Mo oxide-supported γ-Al2O3, which demonstrated excellent deoxygenation performance and 80% conversion selectively towards C17 hydrocarbon compounds [19]. The use of Co-Mo catalysts has been widely applied in the hydro-desulphurisation of petroleum products [20] and recently, in the hydrodeoxygenation process [21]. Based on these studies, excellent acid-base characteristics can be obtained via the incorporation of Co and Mo species. Mora-Vergara et al. reported that large acidic and basic sites were generated on CoMo promoters owing to the synergism between the metals [22]. Even though many studies have produced green diesel via hydrodeoxygenation, the majority of the catalysts were sulphided species (CoMoS) [21]. Despite the fact that CoMo metal sulphide catalysts have been reported to be selective for hydrodeoxygenation, these catalysts have drawbacks such as sulphur leaching, which leads to rapid deactivation owing to their sensitivity to CO poisoning, coke formulation and product contamination [23]. Due to the drawbacks mentioned above for CoMoS [24], one of the aims of this study was to develop highly stable sulphur-free CoMo catalysts for the deoxygenation PFAD. Principally, the catalyst support is the key role in enhancing the catalytic deoxygenation owing to its ability to reinforce the dispersal of active metals and increasing active sites. Activated carbon (AC) has a bright future as catalyst support because of its nature, high surface area, and low affinity towards coke formation [25]. Moreover, AC is thermally stable, which minimises the sintering of active metals during the deoxygenation reaction. Furthermore, Co supported over carbon has been studied in the deoxygenation reaction [18,26], but the produced green diesel was comprised of unsaturated species. The current study developed a series of sulphur-free CoMo-supported AC (derived from coconut shell) catalysts for the deoxygenation of PFAD into a saturated green diesel product. The effect of reaction variables such as temperature, reaction time and catalyst loading was assessed by employing of one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT), and the effect of different catalyst supports (Al2O3, TiO2, and AC) was explored. The catalyst reusability was determined to assess the stability of the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Fresh coconut shells were gathered from the central greenery marketplace in Serdang, Malaysia. Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co (NO3)2.6H2O) with purity >99.9%, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O) with purity 99.0%, aluminium oxide (γ-Al2O3) and GC solvent n-hexane grade (purity >98%) was purchased by Merck (USA). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was acquired from SGE international (Australia). Phosphoric acid with 85.0-87.0% purity procured from J.T. Baker (USA). Potassium hydroxide was obtained from R&M Chemicals. Hydrocarbon standards (C8-C20) and standard internal 1-bromohexane (C6H13Br) provided for gas chromatography (GC) analysis by Sigma Aldrich. Linde Sdn Bhd provided N2 gas with 99.9% purity. PFAD feedstock provided by Sime Darby Jomalina Sdn. Bhd and used directly without any treatment. The PFAD main physical properties and average composition are exhibited in Table 1 . The total acid number of PFAD (TAN = 174.6 mg KOH/g) suggests a high percentage of free fatty acids (87%)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Physical and chemical activation methods were used to prepare the activated carbon AC. Firstly, the coconut shells were mashed and pulverised for 3 h by a pebble mill (Vario-Planetary Mill Pulverisette 4). The soft powder was sieved using 200 μm mesh then carbonised for 4 h in N2 flow at a temperature of 700 °C. H3PO4 implemented the chemical activation of the carbon material at 150 °C for a duration of 12 h. The acid carbon blend was left to cool down, then washed with lukewarm deionised water until the pH is 7. The prepared AC was left to dry overnight at 100 °C. Several AC-based catalysts were prepared by incorporating a proper amount of Co(NO3)2.6H2O and ((NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O) solutions under intense persistent mixing for approximately 6 h at room temperature and dried for 12 h at 110 °C. The carbonaceous precursors were calcined at 550 °C in N2 flow for 4 h. The synthesised catalysts Co10/AC, Mo10/AC, and CoxMoy/AC where: (X = 10 wt%, Y = 5, 10, 15, 20 wt%) catalysts were prepared via the impregnation method. The Al2O3 and TiO2 supported CoMo were prepared via a similar preparation process and catalysts denoted as Co10Mo10/Al2O3 and Co10Mo10/TiO2."
4,Catalyst characterisation,"2.3 Catalyst characterisation Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) measured the surface area and pore distribution of the synthesised catalysts utilising the N2 adsorption-desorption analyser (Thermo-Finnigan Sorpmatic 1990 series). Typically, the catalyst specimen was degassed under vacuum condition at 150 °C for 12 h to eliminate the moisture. In the vacuum compartment at −196 °C, the desorption and adsorption procedure was carried out in nitrogen gas on the catalyst's surface. The X-ray diffractometer instrument (XRD) from Shimadzu (model XRD-6000) was employed to recognise the dispersion states of metal oxide incorporated on AC catalysts. The catalyst surface morphology was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) registered on an electron microscope of LEO-1455 VP. The elemental composition of the synthesised catalyst, including C, O, P, Co, and Mo were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) equipped with Rayny EDX-720 spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2) supplied with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) instrument brand Thermo Finnigan TPD/R/O 1100 system measured the acidity and basicity of the synthesised catalysts. Initially, 0.05 g of the catalyst treated for 45 min over the N2 gas stream at 150 °C, then exposed to NH3 gas at ambient temperature for 1 h to permit adsorption of NH3 on the catalyst's surface. Afterward, the excessive NH3 gas was flushed by the N2 gas stream (20 mL/min). The desorbed NH3 from the catalyst's acid sites was evaluated through TCD in He gas stream (30 mL/min) (50 to 900 °C) and held for 40 min. The CO2 adsorption and desorption procedures pursued the same steps as the TPD-NH3 method. The surface chemical states of the metal oxide specimen Co3O4 and MoO2 supported on AC catalysts was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the determinations were completed by a Microprobe PHI Quantera II under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (base vacuum of ~10–8 Pa) at room temperature. Mg Kα radiation (hυ = 1253.6 eV) was used as the X-ray source. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was applied to evaluate the thermo-stability of the synthesised catalyst using (TGA, Mettler Toledo 990). The catalyst was heated under a 50 mL/min N2 stream gradually to 900 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min. The acidity and basicity of spent catalyst were analysed by TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2 to evaluate the catalyst stability. Moreover, the deposited coke on the spent catalyst surface was assessed by XRD and TGA (TGA, Mettler Toledo 990), where the spent catalyst was heated 25–900 °C under an O2 flow (40 mL/min) with a ramping rate of 30 °C/min."
5,Deoxygenation of PFAD,"2.4 Deoxygenation of PFAD The catalytic deoxygenation of PFAD conducted in a 250 mL semi-batch reactor, mechanically stirred containing 10 g of PFAD and 3 wt% of catalyst (Fig. 1 ). Before the heating process, the reactor was purged with N2 gas to eject the O2. The reactor temperature gradually raised to 350 °C with constant stirring (400 rpm) and held for 60 min under 50 mL/min of N2 gas. The vapor product was condensed by the water cooler (18 °C) and collected in a receiver vessel. On completion of reaction, the reactor was left to cool down to room temperature. The deoxygenation reaction was repeated three times, and the gas product gathered in a 1 L Tedlar gas bag. Moreover, the deoxygenated liquid products were analysed by TAN tests, GC-FID, GC–MS, FTIR, and CHNOS."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis The liquid standards of hydrocarbons n-(C8-C20) were supplied by Sigma Aldrich (USA) and used to identify the components of deoxygenated liquid products. The yields of deoxygenated liquid products have been analysed using gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890A) fitted with an HP-5 capillary column (length: 30 m × inner diameter 0.32 mm × film thickness 0.25 μm) connected to a flame ionisation detector (FID) operating at 300 °C. A 1 μL volume of the obtained deoxygenated liquid product dissolved in n-hexane (GC grade solvent) inserted into the GC column operating at 250 °C, where the N2 gas employed as a carrier. The catalytic efficiency is measured by assessment the summation of peak area of alkanes and alkenes yield n-(C8-C20) (Eq. (3)) (3) Y = ∑ n e + ∑ n a / ∑ n t ∗ 100 % where Y = hydrocarbon yield (%), n e = area of alkene constituents (C8-C20), n a = area of alkane constituents (C8-C20) and n t = area of total products. (4) S carbon = ( C x / ∑ C t / ∗ 100 % The selectivity of the hydrocarbon component was determined by Eq. (4), where S carbon = hydrocarbon selectivity (%), C x = area of the alkene and alkane for the individual carbon atom and C t = the sum area of the total hydrocarbon components (alkane + alkene) within the range of (C8-C20). Furthermore, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) equipped with a non-polar DB-5HT column (30 m × 0.25 mm × I.D μm) with a split-free inlet (model Shimadzu QP2010 Plus) was utilised to analyse the feedstock (PFAD) and liquid deoxygenated products. The deoxygenated liquid products and PFAD diluted in n-hexane solvent (GC grade >98% purity). Additionally, the investigation of the component peaks of the GC–MS spectrum was enhanced by reviewing the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) library [27]. It is worth noting that a probability process matching more than (or equal to) 95% was used to differentiate the main products. The following equation was applied to recognise the deoxygenated product components yield,” “C O ” associated with peaks area belong to organic hydrocarbon compounds n-(C8-C20), isoparaffins, cycloalkane, and heavy hydrocarbons besides non-deoxygenized compounds such as (carboxylic acid, and alcohol) was evaluated using Eq. (5). (5) Y product = ( C o / ∑ t y ∗ 100 % where Y product = yield of organic constituent (%), C o = area of the desired organic constituent and t y = total area of organic constituents. In the deoxygenated liquid product, the functional groups were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR), which operates a spectrometer within 4 cm−1 resolution at 300–4000 cm−1 range. The gas-phase analysis offered essential information regarding the possible reaction pathways. 0.25 mL of the collected gases were injected in an off-line GC (Agilent Model G1540N, USA) equipped with TCD. The product separation process used high-purity carrier gas (He). The composition of the CO and CO2 gases was determined based on standard gas percentages. CHNOS analysis was used to determine the atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon (O/C) (Eq. (6)) or hydrogen to carbon (H/C) (Eq. (7)) in the feedstock and deoxygenated liquid product [28] using a TruSpec CHNS (LECO Corporation) analyser. The results are shown in a van Krevalen diagram. (6) Atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon O / C = Number of Oxygen atoms Number of carbon atoms (7) Atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon H / C = Number of hydrogen atoms Number of carbon atoms The feedstock and deoxygenated liquid product acid values were assessed to evaluate the number of carboxylic acids or fatty acids using the standard method (AOAS Cd 3d-63) Eq. (8) was used to calculate the acid value. (8) Total acid number TAN = V i − V e ∗ N ∗ 56 / W oil where Vi = solution required for titration of the sample (mL), Ve = solution required for titration of the blank (mL), N = concentration of KOH sample, 56 = the molecular weight of the KOH solution, W oil = the mass of sample in grams."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Both catalysts' structural and textural properties were defined by N2 adsorption and are tabulated in Table 2 . The AC surface area (420 m2/ g) gradually reduced after the incorporation of the metals. The surface area decreased with the rise in the Mo impregnation level. Similarly, with the increase of the MoO2 concentration incorporated in Co10Mo(5 – 20) wt%/AC catalysts, the pore volume decreased gradually. The deterioration of the pore structure was most probably due to the embedding of excessive active metals in the pores, concurrently resulting in a reduction in the surface area [29]. On the contrary, the pore diameter enlarged owing to the collapse of pore walls in the process of impregnation and partial destruction after calcination [14]. Large pores are typically advantageous for the dispersal of the reacting materials on the catalyst and simultaneously spur the deoxygenation ability. The majority of the metal-supported AC catalysts exhibited a pore diameter within a range of 5.7–9.1 nm, indicating the presence of mesoporosity. The XRD samples of the studied catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . The XRD distinctive phase of AC displayed amorphous broad diffraction peak centred at 2θ = 23°, which is a typical characteristic for activated carbon [30]. The AC amorphous texture dramatically diminished following to impregnation of the Co3O4 and MoO2 species owing to the intercalation of metals entrenched in the AC matrix and resulting in a wider dispersal of the AC-based catalyst. The XRD characteristics for the monometallic catalysts (Co10/AC and Mo10/AC) revealed the existence of a cubic Co3O4 phase at 2θ = 31.3°, 36.9°, 59.4° and 65.3° (JCPDS File No. 00-001-1152) and a tetragonal MoO2 phase at 2θ = 26.1°, 31.9°, 49.3°, 53.2°, 54.0°,66.7° and 73.3° (JCPDS File No. 00-002-0422). It should be pointed out that the less-intense Co3O4 peak indicates that Co is fully dispersed on the support surface [31]. Further incorporation of Co and Mo species resulted in the formation of distinguished peaks of a bimetallic phase of CoMoO4 in the Co10Mo(5 – 20)wt%/AC catalysts, which had been detected at 2θ = 23.4°, 26.5°, 27.4°, 33.7°, 39.0° and 60.7° (JCPDS File No. 00-021-0868) [32]. Visibly, no diffraction peaks corresponding to Co3O4 were noticed for Co10Mo(5 – 20)wt%/AC catalysts, which attributed to the Co3+ penetration into the mesoporous lattice structure of the AC support [19]. The incorporation of Co3+ also led to a reduction in MoO2 peak intensity, suggesting the insertion of Co3+ (0.58°A) into the Mo4+ (2.01°A) lattice [33]. Indeed, excess Mo species >10 wt% resulted in a high-intensity MoO2 peak, ascribed to the agglomeration of crystallites [34]. This finding is in concordance with the crystallite size of the bimetallic catalysts, which was determined at the most intense peak centred at 2θ = 26.1° by using Debyee-Scherrer's equation. Remarkably, the mean crystal size of the bimetallic catalyst-supported AC increased with an excess of Mo concentration (Table 2). Generally, an increase in the Mo concentration visibly led to the growth of MoO2 crystallites as a result of expanding the aggregate particle size; consequently, this may have decreased the catalyst surface area. These results agree with the BET analysis. The FESEM images in Fig. 3 revealed the surface morphology of all catalysts. The parent AC had a smooth and curved surface. These findings are in concordance with the sintering effect [35]. Interestingly, Co10/AC showed the formation of large pore structures, whereas Mo10/AC exhibited the formation of irregular fragments in addition to the homogeneous distribution of tiny slab needle-like structures with sharp edges. The needle-like structures are believed to have occurred due to the attachment of Mo on the AC surface. This result agrees with previous work [36]. The addition of a series of Mo concentrations with 10 wt% Co procured a significant alteration to the exterior surface morphology of the AC surfaces. 5 wt% Mo resulted in the formation of tiny irregular and non-disperse shapes over the AC surface; meanwhile, Mo-containing catalysts rendered the formation of a large flaky bulk structure with size >500 nm. The enlargement of the flaky aggregates in the 10–20 wt% Mo-containing catalysts chimes with the decreasing trend of surface area as shown in Table 2. Interestingly, the 10 wt% Mo promoter in the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst led to the formation of a regular nested porous structure, which provided a patterned surface for the reaction to take place and boosted the reaction rate by enhancing the catalytic activity, as is illustrated in Fig. 1S. The EDX results in Table 3 revealed that the AC support contained C, O, and P. The presence of P species demonstrates the effective phosphonation of AC with H3PO4. The metal-supported AC catalysts included Co and Mo, which suggests their successful attachment onto the AC surface through the impregnation method. The obtained experimental values for Co and Mo were close to the theoretical values. Noteworthy, the mixed metal-supported AC was predominantly comprised of C (35–55 wt%), which allows it to act as an effective sintering barrier and is believed to have incredible mechanical and thermal properties during the deoxygenation reaction [29]. According to a previous study, acidic and basic sites have essential functions in promoting the deoxygenation reaction [37]. Acidic sites are beneficial for CC bond cleavage, and basic sites are responsible for the removal of carboxylic groups via CO bond scission. Additionally, basic sites are able to generate an anti-coke effect [9]. For these reasons, TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2 were used for further investigation of the acidic and basic properties of the metal-supported AC catalysts; the results are exhibited in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The outcomes demonstrated that AC catalysts possess low and strong acid sites (Tmax > 100 °C and >800 °C). The strong acidity of AC is ascribed to the acidification of AC via phosphonation with concentrated H3PO4. Elfadly et al. (2017) [38] and Asikin-Mijan et al. (2020) [39] assured these findings, whereby both clay and AC with neutral properties exhibited superior strong acidic sites after undergoing phosphonation treatment [40]. Meanwhile, most of the metal-supported AC catalysts exhibited a large amount of superacid sites (Tmax > 850 °C). The acidic strength and its density increased when CoMo was incorporated into the AC surface, attributed to the synergistic interaction between Co3O4 and MoO2 species on the external surface of AC [34]. Additionally, the total super acid sites gradually increased when the Mo species concentration increased from 5 to 10 wt%; a further increase up to 20 wt% caused a slight decline in strong acid sites; this was attributed to the ability of MoO2 to form a strong chemical bond with AC, which caused the loss of -OH Brönsted acid sites at Tmax > 850 °C after binding to Mo4+ ions [41,42]. In the case of basicity, all catalysts showed the existence of strong basic sites (Tmax > 500 °C) and super basic sites (Tmax > 900 °C). Parenthetically, the majority of the bimetal-supported AC catalysts had higher basicity properties than Co10/AC and Mo10/AC, respectively, which is connected to the presence of free anions, i.e., O2− between Co4+ and Mo+2 pairs [43]. Similar to the acid site trends, an excess of Mo reduced the number of basic sites. The total basic sites reached its highest value in Co10Mo10/AC with a basicity distribution of 13.46 mmol/g. Overall, it can be predicted that Co10Mo10/AC favoured high deoxygenation activity via a preferable deCOx reaction attributed to the typical basicity properties and intense acid sites. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to examine the thermal stability of the synthesised catalysts; the findings were displayed in Fig. 2S. The results show no noticeable change in the mass loss at a certain temperature range (25–300 °C) for all metal catalysts, which indicates that the catalysts were thermally stable in this temperature range. After this temperature, the mono catalysts (Co/AC and Mo/AC) began to deteriorate with a total weight loss of 37.8 wt% and 41.6 wt%; respectively, this might be attributed to the decomposition of carbonaceous compounds and metal oxides that weakly bonded to the AC surface [44]. The bimetallic catalyst Co10Mo10/AC exhibited a substantial improvement in thermal stability with a weight loss of about 24.5 wt% as it started decomposition at temperature > 500 °C, which demonstrates that the cooperation of Co and Mo boosted the chemical bonding in the bimetallic catalyst and thus reinforced catalyst stability during the deoxygenation of PFAD at 350 °C [45]. A careful investigation into the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was further conducted using XPS to provide information about the chemical state of the metal and the atomic ratio of elements at the near-surface of the catalyst. The core levels of C1 s, O1 s, Co2p, P2p, and Mo 3d5 for the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst were observed through XPS spectra (Fig. 5 ). Visibly, the C1 s spectra provided with three peaks related to AC at BE 284.7 ± 0.1 eV, 286.2 ± 0.1 eV, and 287.1 ± 0.1 eV. Remarkably, these peaks are bound to CO, CC, and CO, which indicates that the surface of the AC is inlaid with oxygenated groups [46]. The Co10Mo10/AC catalyst also showed an acute O 1s peak located at 530.7 ± 0.1 eV, which corresponds to lattice oxygen and oxygen bound to metals. In addition, Co 2p exhibited two peaks at Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 with BE at 797.6 ± 0.1 eV and 781.7 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. These were assigned to Co2+ and Co3+ in the Co3O4 and CoMoO4 phase [14]. Similarly, Co10Mo/AC showed the presence of Mo4+ and Mo6+ belong to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 at BE 232.9 ± 0.2 eV and 236.1 ± 0.2 eV, respectively, which affirmed the existence of MoO2 and CoMoO4 phases [45]. Therefore, the “CoMoO4” is supposed to be the most active phase in the deoxygenation reaction, is likely to occur. Besides that, the P2p signal displayed at BE 133.0 ± 0.2 eV, which can be ascribed to PO4 3− species [47] from the residual phosphoric acid used during the chemical activation process of AC. By comparing with the XRD pattern of Co10/AC, Mo10/AC, and Co10Mo10/AC catalysts (Fig. 2), it can be seen that the Co10Mo10/AC catalysts exhibited consistent phase Co3O4 and MoO2 but with the new appearance of the CoMoO4 phase [29]. Due to this reason, it can be expected that the oxidation state of the Co and Mo supported AC remains the same [14]. It can be seen that the BE of Co2+ and Mo6+ in the bimetallic catalyst Co10Mo10/AC was higher than the corresponding CoO and MoO bulk [48], which indicates strong metal-support interactions between Co/Mo and AC, as supported by the TPD-NH3 results [49]. This finding is also in accordance with prior literature [33] [50], whereby that BE of 236.1 ± 0.2 eV and 781.7 ± 0.1 eV in CoMo bimetallic catalyst was higher than in monometallic catalysts. Additionally, the strong interaction between the metal and the support may prevent Co and Mo from sintering on the catalyst surface and thus preserve the characteristics of the metal active sites in maintaining deoxygenation efficiency at high temperatures (300–400 °C) [45]. This outcome pointed out that combining Co and Mo metals on AC effectively enhances catalyst stability and possibly favours CO bond cleavage. Table 4 exhibits the quantitative analysis of surface atomic (%) composition of these elements (C, O, P, Co, and Mo) in the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst, which is consistent with the theoretical results (10:10) and elemental compositions determined by FESEM-EDX (Table 3)."
9,"Screening deoxygenation of PFAD over AC, Co10/AC, Mo10/AC, and Co10-Mo(5 – 20) wt%/AC catalysts","3.2 Screening deoxygenation of PFAD over AC, Co10/AC, Mo10/AC, and Co10-Mo(5 – 20) wt%/AC catalysts The catalytic deoxygenation of PFAD was conducted at a reaction temperature of 350 °C, the reaction period of 60 min, and catalyst loading 0.3 wt% under ambient N2 gas. The catalytic efficacy and selectivity of the obtained products are shown in Fig. 6a–b. The results revealed that AC, mono-metallic catalysts Co10/AC and Mo10/AC yielded 29%, 38%, and 42% of (C8-C20) hydrocarbons, respectively (Fig. 6a). The obtained liquid products had a high value of TAN (72–102 mg KOH/g), which indicates the existence of a significant quantity of non-deoxygenized carboxylic acid. On the other hand, the bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity yield (46–64%) and a lower value of TAN (42–71 mg KOH/g). The hydrocarbon yield followed the next sequence: Co10Mo10/AC > Co10Mo15/AC > Co10Mo5/AC > Co10Mo20/AC > Mo10/AC > Co10/AC > AC. Fig. 3S highlighted the correlation between the deoxygenation activity and the acid-base density of the catalysts. Remarkably, the catalytic activity proportionates to the acid-base density, where the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst showed the highest hydrocarbon yield (64%) with the lowest TAN value of 42 mg KOH/g. This owed by the high acid-base density in Co10Mo10/AC, which rendered greater capability in converting the majority of the acidic components in PFAD into hydrocarbon compounds. Theoretically, the deCOx of PFAD, which consists of fatty acids (C16 and C18), generates hydrocarbons having one carbon atom lesser than the corresponding fatty acids [51]. The selectivity of n-(C15 + C17) for AC-catalysed PFAD was low because of the formation of light hydrocarbon components n-(C8-C13) is 32% yield (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the mono catalysts Mo10/AC and Co10/AC exhibited a slight improvement in n-(C15 + C17) selectivity to 41% and 50%, respectively. This finding confirms the conjunction of the metal oxide on the surface of the support enhanced the catalyst properties (acidity and basicity), which improved the deoxygenation activity. Interestingly, the selectivity n-(C15 + C17) of the bimetallic catalysts Co10Mo(5 – 20)wt%/AC persisted in rising with an increment in the Mo concentration to 10 wt% (63%) but dramatically reduced beyond this concentration, this ascribed to the cracking reaction. It can be suggested that Mo-rich catalysts with full acidic sites (see TPD-NH3) increase the cracking capability of n-(C15 + C17) and produce more light components n-(C10-C13) [42]. The higher cracking capacity of Mo-containing species was also shown by the Mo10/AC catalysed reaction, where the total light constituents of n-(C11-C13) was the highest (40%). Similarly, this was contributed to by the acidic characteristics of Mo10/AC. Depending on the catalytic activity results, an equal ratio of Co: Mo in Co10Mo10/AC catalyst is an optimum metal content for optimising deoxygenation activity. Notably, the selectivity of n-C15 was predominant, which pointed out that the deoxygenation reaction prime pathway for of PFAD returns to the CO bond scission in palmitic acid or by the incidence of CC bond splitting of the deCOx product n-(C17), which is thought to occur due to the lack of H2. [52]. Additionally, the Mo promoter also played a vital role in CC cleavage of fatty acid or intermediate compounds, yielding components in the range of C8-C16 [19]. GC–MS and FT-IR analysed the liquid deoxygenated product components; their chemical functional groups are displayed in Fig. 6c–d. The results revealed that PFAD contains around 98% carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C16 and C18 (see Table 1), which markedly reduced in the deoxygenated liquid products as a consequence of successful deoxygenation reactions and the elimination of the carboxyl group from the fatty acid structures. The deoxygenated liquid products catalysed by Co10Mo(5 – 20)wt%/AC were in the majority composed of aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) with carbon numbers in the range of C8-C20 (Fig. 6c); this agreed with the GC-FID analysis. The total aliphatic hydrocarbons were maximal (70%) when the reaction was catalysed by Co10Mo10/AC, reinforcing the idea of the strong influence of acid-base site distribution. Indeed, Co10Mo10/AC also resulted in the formation of minor amounts of intermediate oxygenated compounds (alcohols and acids) and non‑oxygenated products (cycloalkane and heavy hydrocarbons), suggested the presence of high acid-base sites density in the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst reduced side reactions, especially cracking and polymerisation. The excellent deoxygenation activity is also in agreement with the FT-IR results (Fig. 6d). It can be seen that the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst displayed a noticeable decrease in the intensity of the carbonyl groups belonging to -COOH groups at 1740 cm−1 and C-O-C absorption at 1271 cm−1 [53], suggesting a decline in the oxygen content towards deoxygenation. Interestingly, the alkene peaks at 930 cm−1 and 730 cm−1 in PFAD reduce after deoxygenation, associated with the saturation of alkenes via in-situ hydrogenation. At the same time, the CH stretching (alkane) peaks (2922 cm−1, 2850 cm−1) became more prominent and separated, indicating an increase in the alkane content."
10,Optimisation study (one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT)),"3.3 Optimisation study (one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT)) Based on the preliminary screening study, Co10Mo10/AC was the most effective catalyst. Reaction parameters such as catalyst loading 0.5–7 wt%, reaction period 60–240 min, and reaction temperature 300–400 °C were assessed by utilising one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT); the results are presented in Fig. 7 . The OVAT method is simple to implement by altering one factor at a time while maintaining the rest fixed. The study of catalyst loading on deoxygenation activity revealed that increasing the loading (0.5–3 wt%) led to an increment in hydrocarbon (C8-C20) yields from 45% to up to 64% and n-(C15 + C17) selectivity from 46% to 63% (Fig. 7a–b). An additional increment in catalyst loading above 3 wt% drove to a diminution in the yield and n-(C15 + C17) selectivity, ascribed to the existence of excess active sites leading to short hydrocarbon chain formation (C8-C14) as a result of CC scission via cracking reactions. In light of the obtained results, 3 wt% catalyst loading was optimal for good deoxygenation activity. Based on the effect of the deoxygenation temperature, it can be seen, with an increment of the reaction temperature 300–350 °C, that catalytic activity increased progressively, which raised the hydrocarbon (C8-C20) yield from 52 to 75% and the selectivity of n-(C15 + C17) from 46 to 70%. Contrariwise, the reaction temperature beyond 350 °C procured a deterioration in the deoxygenation activity because of the incidence of secondary reactions such as cracking and polymerisation reactions (Fig. 7c–d) [19]. Striking, the temperature of 350 °C was an effective reaction temperature for the deoxygenation reaction of PFAD. Assessing the effect of the reaction time (60–120 min) on deoxygenation activity showed that the yield of hydrocarbon (C8-C20) significantly increased from 75% to 92% and n-(C15 + C17) selectivity risen from 70 to 89% (Fig. 7e–f). The deoxygenation activity was negatively affected with prolonged reaction time > 120 min, where side reactions were aggravated due to CC cleavage of the deoxygenated product into undesirable lighter components (gaseous form). Therefore, it was suggested that for deCOx reaction adequate time should be 120 min. According to the current optimisation study, 3 wt% catalyst loading at 350 °C and 120 min reaction period under H2-free conditions were optimum to yield 92% hydrocarbon components with 89% selectivity for n-(C15 + C17)."
11,Elemental composition of the deoxygenated liquid product,"3.4 Elemental composition of the deoxygenated liquid product CHNOS analysis determines the elemental composition of the feedstock and deoxygenated liquid products, which allowed us to estimate the effect of the catalysts in the deoxygenation process. Van Krevelen diagram plot was used to explain the calculated atomic ratios of H/C and O/C (Fig. 8 ). The H/C ratio of the PFAD feedstock was 1.96, while the O/C ratio was 0.13. Overall, the liquid products of the single metal-supported AC catalysts exhibited a slight reduction in the O/C ratio to be (0.09–0.10) while the H/C ratio became (1.89–1.63). On the contrary, Co10Mo10/AC revealed a significant decrease in the O/C ratio to be (0.02) and increase in the H/C ratio to become (2.18). The low O/C ratio in the Co10Mo10/AC catalysed product agreed with significant deoxygenation activity and is indicative that CO bond scission dominated through the deCOx reaction [54]. Notably, the high H/C ratio in the Co10Mo10/AC catalysed product showed the preeminent capability of Co-Mo in improving the saturation of double bonds in hydrocarbon chains via hydrogenation [55], thereby resulting in alkane-rich species. Unlike Co10Mo10/AC, a lower H/C ratio (lower than PFAD) was noted for the mono-metallic catalysts, meaning that hydrogenation was inhibited. In contrast, cyclisation/aromatisation activities were favoured, leading to the high unsaturation activity of the hydrocarbon. The GC–MS outcomes (Fig. 4S) confirmed the CHNOS findings, where saturated hydrocarbons were observed in the Co10Mo10/AC deoxygenated liquid product while the single metal-supported AC catalysts demonstrated the opposite trend."
12,Comparison study relating the effect of the support on PFAD deoxygenation,"3.5 Comparison study relating the effect of the support on PFAD deoxygenation In this work, two oxide supports, i.e., TiO2 and γ-Al2O3, were applied in the deoxygenation of PFAD to study their effects on the reaction and selectivity of products using a Co10Mo10 promoter under the optimal reaction parameters: 3 wt% catalyst loading, 350 °C and 120 min reaction time in N2 stream, compared with the AC support. The catalytic activity profile of the deoxygenation reaction and the gaseous distribution is exhibited in Fig. 9 . The results reveal that the Co10Mo10/γ-Al2O3 and Co10Mo10/TiO2 catalysts provided low hydrocarbon yield (56% and 48%). At the same time, the TAN values were high 75 and 88 mg KOH/g, respectively. In the same manner, the Co10Mo10 supported γ-Al2O3 and TiO2 catalysts showed poor selectivity towards n-(C15 + C17) at 65% and 55%, respectively. Amongst the catalysts, the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst rendered the highest liquid hydrocarbon yield (92%) and selectivity of n-(C15 + C17) (89%) with the lowest TAN value (24 mg KOH/g) (Fig. 9a & b). The differences in deoxygenation activity for all the catalysts could be ascribed to the variety in acidity-basicity characteristics; this outcome agrees with Fig. 5S & Table 1S, which display a comparison of acidity-basicity properties. The Co10Mo10 supported metal oxides (TiO2 and Al2O3) exhibited weak acid-base properties [56]; conversely, the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst showed the presence of super acid-base properties. Noted, lower deoxygenation activity over CoMo supported Al2O3, and TiO2 was not because there's no synergistic interaction between (Co and Mo) but due to low acidity of the catalyst (Fig. 5S & Table 1S). This is consistent with Ranga et al. (2019) [45], whereby non-chemically activated TiO2 and Al2O3 promoted Co and Mo only has little positive influence on deoxygenation product selectivity. Thus, it has been clearly concluded that deoxygenation activity is related to the strength of acidity and basicity. Based on the gas analysis (Fig. 9c), Co10Mo10/TiO2 and Co10Mo10/Al2O3 showed a high amount of CO (>80%), which ascribed that decarbonylation reaction is the prevailing route, which is connected to the weak acid-base sites. In contrast, the Co10Mo10/AC exhibited the highest content of CO2, which suggests that the decarboxylation reaction was the dominant reaction. Overall, these findings profoundly affirm that the removal of oxygenated compounds via decarboxylation and decarbonylation is strongly affected by the strength of acid-base sites [57]; super acid-base sites promote decarboxylation, while weak acid-base sites favour decarbonylation activity."
13,Proposed reaction pathways for deoxygenation of PFAD over Co10Mo10/AC catalyst,"3.6 Proposed reaction pathways for deoxygenation of PFAD over Co10Mo10/AC catalyst Table 1 reveals that PFAD is mainly comprised of saturated fatty acids C16 (~56%) and saturated + unsaturated fatty acids C18 (~42%). After deoxygenation of PFAD, the majority of the products consisted of C15 in addition to C17, along with by-products of CO2 (80%) and CO (20%) [12]. The design of PFAD deoxygenation pathway (Fig. 10 ) depends on the results of GC-FID, GCMS for liquid-phase and GC-TCD for gas-phase analysis (Figs. 9b–c & 6S). Fig. 10 displays the direct decarboxylation of C16 in PFAD to form n-pentadecane (C15) besides CO2 as a by-product gas (reaction A). Simultaneously, decarbonylation reaction resulted in the formation of 7-pentadecene in addition to CO and water as by-products (reaction B) [18]. Interestingly, the yield of n-pentadecane predominated (68%), which implied that the decarboxylation pathway was favoured. On the other hand, the high formation of n-pentadecane probably due to the occurrence of the hydrogenation of 7-pentacenes (reaction C) [58] by the addition of in-situ hydrogen produced from the water gas shift reaction (WGS) (Eq. (9)). WGS is a reaction of CO and water to form H2. (9) CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 Surprisingly, in a comparison between the content of C16 in the PFAD feed and the yield of (C15) in the deoxygenated liquid product, that the (C15) content was higher than expected. This increment can be attributed to CC cleavage of the fatty acid C18, which can contribute to the formation of C16 fatty acids (reaction E) [59]. Simultaneously, the fatty acid (C18) subjected to hydrogenation and formed stearic acid (reaction C) [8,19], which underwent a further direct decarboxylation reaction to produce saturated n-heptadecane (C17) (reaction A) [19], and decarbonylation reaction to form 8-heptadecane (reaction B) [60]. In the meantime, mild cracking (CC cleavage) took place on the n-heptadecanes, which resulted in the production of n-pentadecane (reaction E) [61]. Light components (C8-C14) were also detected in the GC-FID analysis due to mild cracking to the intermediate product 7-pentadecanes and 8-heptadecenes (reaction D) [19,62]. This phenomenon agreed with Xing's findings in the deoxygenation of oleic acid in an inert ambient, which mainly produced 8-heptadecene, which further cracked to form short-chain olefins [10]."
14,Reusability and stability of spent catalyst in PFAD deoxygenation,"3.7 Reusability and stability of spent catalyst in PFAD deoxygenation Catalytic reusability studies must be carried out to check the economic feasibility of large-scale green diesel production. The reusability of the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was performed in a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C with a reaction time of 120 min and catalyst loading of 3 wt% under an N2 ambient. At the termination of the deoxygenation reaction, the spent Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was recovered by simple n-hexane washing, then dried out in an oven for 12 h. The results for deoxygenation activity and catalyst characterisation of both the fresh and spent Co10Mo10/AC catalysts are displayed in Fig. 11 [63]. The deoxygenation activity was consistent until the sixth round, whereas the hydrocarbon yield was 90–80% and selectivity n-(C15 + C17) 88–78% (Fig. 11a). A similar trend was observed in the GC–MS results, where the liquid product of the first to the sixth runs dominantly contained 94–88% hydrocarbon fractions (Fig. 11b). Moreover, the deoxygenated liquid product in the sixth run exhibited a marginal increase in carboxylic acid in comparison to the first run, suggesting a minor deterioration in deoxygenation activity. It is generally believed that the deterioration in deoxygenation activity after multiple runs is a result of the loss of active sites (acid-base sites). Evidently, the TPD-CO2 and TPD-NH3 of the spent Co10Mo10/AC catalyst showed a slight reduction in total acid-base sites after six runs (Fig. 11c & d). Moreover, Asikin et al. reported that the loss of active sites could be due to a metal phase change and coke deposition [64]. As investigated by XRD, the XRD peak for MoO2 at 2θ = 26.3° and CoMoO4 at 2θ = 27.6°, 32.3°, 53.6°, and 60.8° were remarkably reduced in intensity compared to the fresh catalyst (Fig. 11e), which suggests deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. TGA analysis was executed to study coke formation during the deoxygenation of PFAD over the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst; the results are shown in Fig. 11f. TGA analysis of the fresh and spent Co10Mo10/AC catalysts demonstrated that no weight loss at the region I (T < 180 °C) ascribed to moisture and volatile species, while the major weight loss was between 350 °C and 650 °C, which is attributed to the oxidation of the coke in air. The next region at 700–950 °C is attributed to the combustion of the AC support derived coconut shell [65]. Evaluation of the coke deposition in the spent catalyst Co10Mo10/AC in the temperature range between 350 and 650 °C was about 20 wt% after the sixth cycle. The coke can be categorised into two types as per TGA analysis. The first decomposition peak at region II (>180 °C–350 °C) is defined as soft coke. The soft coke is typically related to the existence of mobile carbonaceous sediments. Meanwhile the second region III (>350 °C–650 °C) assumed as hard coke formed as a result of polymerisation of carbonaceous compounds [66]. Obviously, Co10Mo10/AC mainly deactivated by soft and hard coke as recorded in the TGA results at high temperatures (region III (350 °C–600 °C)) [67]. The coke deposition depends on the quality of the feedstock, the high content of long-chain fatty acids in PFAD (98%) are precursors for polymerisation and condensation of carbonaceous material. Nevertheless, coke formation was still less than with acid catalysts [60,68], indicating that the bimetallic catalyst Co10Mo10/AC exhibited good coke resistance and excellent catalyst stability."
15,Conclusion,"This study assessed the effect of Co, Mo, and their combination supported on activated carbon in the deoxygenation of PFAD by studying the effectiveness of various supports. Based on the catalytic deoxygenation results, an equal ratio of Co: Mo in the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst showed the highest efficiency for deoxygenation activity, yielded 92% of (C8-C20) hydrocarbons, 89% n-(C15 + C17) selectivity and a TAN value of 24 mg KOH/g. The efficiency of Co10Mo10/AC catalysts can be ascribed to the synergistic action of Co and Mo on AC and the higher number of super acid-base sites. The deoxygenation of PFAD over Co10Mo10 supported (TiO2 and Al2O3) catalysts indicates that the removal of oxygenated compounds was dominant via the decarbonylation route, while the prevailing deoxygenation route with the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was via decarboxylation. This owing to the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst possesses super acid-base properties, while metal oxide supports (TiO2 and Al2O3) were weak acidic catalysts. High saturation of alkenes occurred via decarboxylation and hydrogenation pathways. The excellent stability of the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was shown by its ability to be reutilised up to 6 cycles with a hydrocarbon yield within the range of 90–80% and 788–78% n-(C15 + C17) selectivity. The slight reduction in deoxygenation activity over the cycles was owing to the loss of acid-base sites, metal phase changes, and coke deposition. From the applicable assessment point of view, the CoMo catalyst supported on AC derived from coconut shell showed high effectiveness and catalytic deoxygenation activity to promote the production of saturated green diesel. At the same time, the Co10Mo10/AC catalyst was economical and environment friendly."
