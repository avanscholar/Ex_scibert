0,Introduction,"Recent times have seen tumultuous turn-ups and downs in crude oil prices. Several economies have suffered from these unsecured events. The precarious nature of crude oil prices, depleting oil reserves, and environmental concerns related to the use of fossil fuels have led to increased interest in biofuels. This has led to unprecedented growth in biofuel production worldwide. Biodiesel, which comes from 100% renewable sources, is an important alternative to fossil fuels. The production of biodiesel by transesterification of vegetable oil with alcohol produces glycerol (10% by weight) as a by-product [1,2]. Due to the rapid production of biodiesel, the market is oversupplied with glycerol. Other production routes that produce glycerol by-products include soap manufacture, fatty acid production, and microbial fermentation [3,4]. The oversupply of glycerol has led to a decline in price that affects the overall economics of biodiesel production. The upgradation of low-value glycerol to high-value chemicals increases the sustainability and economics of the biodiesel production process. Among the many available options, glycerol hydrogenolysis for the production of propylene glycol is an attractive and relevant route. Many researchers have focused on this option. Noble metals have shown high activity in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, but the selectivity towards 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) is low due to their tendency to catalyze the cleavage of the C‒C bond [5–7]. However, Cu-based catalysts have been reported to exhibit excellent selectivity towards 1,2-PDO. Cu-based catalysts have a tendency to selectively cleave the C-O bond rather than the C‒C bond [8–10]. Various improvements on Cu-based catalysts have been investigated, such as the use of acidic supports such as SiO2, Al2O3, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [11–14]. The combination with other metals such as Cr, Co, Zn, Mg, and Ag, together with Cu, has also been investigated over the years [15]. Glycerol hydrogenolysis reactions were carried out with hydrogen gas at high temperatures and high pressure because the solubility of H2 gas in glycerol at lower pressure is low [16]. This requires H2 gas from fossil sources. To make the whole process a green process and avoid the inherent problems in handling hydrogen gas, researchers focused on in-situ production of hydrogen under process conditions. There are two options for in-situ production, including aqueous phase glycerol reforming and catalytic transfer hydrogenation. In catalytic transfer hydrogenation, hydrogen is transferred from a hydrogen donor species to an acceptor species. These reactions have an important advantage over the use of hydrogen gas; because the storage and transport of the hydrogen donor are much easier than that of hydrogen gas. Molecular hydrogen is also highly hazardous and highly flammable. The most important criterion for selecting a hydrogen donor is its solubility in glycerol. Nevertheless, several researchers focused on the in-situ production of 1,2-PDO by the hydrogen donor, but the best results were reported for the hydrogenation of glycerol under H2 pressure, where glycerol hydrogenolysis with Pt-catalyzed in-situ generation of hydrogen by aqueous phase reforming was reported for the first time [17]. In addition, several other catalysts were used for both aqueous phase reforming and catalytic transfer hydrogenation for in-situ glycerol hydrogenolysis. Various hydrogen donors and different types of catalysts have been used by different researchers, as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Extensive studies have been carried out on the choice of catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol and its selectivity to 1,2-PDO. Noble metals tend to cleave the more desirable C‒C bond. Cu-based catalysts have been reported to selectively cleave the C‒O bond via the dehydration pathway, as Cu has an inherent preference for the C‒O bond over the C‒C bond [5,7]. We focused on our research, synthesis of low-cost catalysts, and industrial feasibility, which showed higher activity under safe reaction conditions. In this work, the synthesis of the Cu-Al-Zn series of catalysts with different ratios of (Cu+Zn)/Al was performed. The co-precipitation method was used for the synthesis. Further, the catalysts were characterized by different methods like DTA/TGA, XRD, SEM, EDX, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and FTIR. The catalysts were further used for the conversion of glycerol to 1,2-PDO."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation In a particular synthesis, 0.01 mol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.15 mol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.04 mol of Al(NO3)2 .9H2O were dissolved in 400 mL of Millipore water. Another solution was prepared using a mixture of NaOH and Na2CO3. The concentration of NaOH was 0.8 mol L-1 and of Na2CO3 was 0.25 mol L-1. The latter was mixed dropwise to the nitrate solution in a glass reactor with vigorous stirring. The solution was added until the pH of the mixture reached a value of up to 9.5. The slurry was further aged with stirring at 90 ℃ for about 20 h, then allowed to settle and washed with Millipore water until the pH reached about 7. Then, the precipitate formed was dried overnight in an oven at a temperature of 120 ℃ to remove water and dry completely. The Cu content was kept constant, and the amount of Zn and Al was varied. Different ratios of (Cu + Zn)/Al were taken as 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1. The resulting catalysts were crushed and sieved to obtain the uniform size distribution of catalysts. The catalysts were calcined at a temperature of 400 ℃ for 4 h. Furthermore, the catalysts were reduced to activate the chemical state of copper species under hydrogen at 350 ℃ for 2 h. These catalysts are referred to as CZA3, CZA4, CZA5, and CZA6 in the rest of the report."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization To determine the characteristic properties of the catalysts, several characterizations of the catalysts were performed, including DTA-TGA, XRD, FE-SEM/EDX, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and FTIR. TGA/DTA was analyzed using the SII 6300 EXSTAR. For XRD, the patterns were obtained with the diffractometer D8 (Bruker AXS, Germany) using K α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with 0.02 steps from 5° to 80° (2θ). Peaks were identified using the ICDD-JCPDS database, and their lattice parameters were calculated using the standard cubic indexing method. Scherrer's equation was used to determine the crystal size [18]. SEM-EDX was used to determine the morphology and elemental composition. Quanta 200 field emission gun (FEG) from Field Emission Inc. (FEI), Netherlands, with attached electron backscatter diffraction (EDBS) was used. An error of ±15% was considered in the determination of the elemental composition. CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD were performed to determine the basicity and acidity of the catalyst, respectively. Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720, which has a built-in thermal conductivity detector (TCD), was used for the experiment. The sample (50 g) was kept in a U-tube, which was first degassed under nitrogen (20 ccmin-1) for 2 h to remove all moisture and expose the pores. A CO2 flow of 20 ccmin-1 was used for adsorption at 40 ℃ for 2 h until saturation. After adsorption, a He stream of 20 ccmin-1 was used to remove all the physically bound CO2 for one hour at 40 ℃. The desorption profile of CO2 was recorded by TCD in the range of 40–850 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃min-1. Similarly, NH3-TPD was used to determine the acidity of the catalysts. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine functional groups present on the catalysts (Thermo Nicolet, Model Magna 760)."
4,Catalytic activity,"2.3 Catalytic activity The catalytic performance was carried out in a high-pressure autoclave (Amar equipment) in the presence of Cu-Al-Zn catalysts for glycerol hydrogenolysis under different reaction conditions. Ethanol was used as a hydrogen donor in the hydrogenolysis reaction, and the other reaction condition was maintained at 200 ℃ and 30 bar using N2. The ratio of ethanol to glycerol was maintained at 4:1 (0.088 mol ethanol and 0.022 mol glycerol) with 0.25 g catalyst. After completion of the reactions, the reactor was kept in an ice bath to reduce the temperature to 5–10 ℃; then, the catalysts were separated from the products by centrifugation. Furthermore, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC) (Hewlett-Packard HP-5890) with HP-5 column. For catalytic activity, ethanol and glycerol were mixed in a ratio of 4:1 was used in a batch reactor. 1.5 g of catalyst was used per mole of glycerol, and the total volume introduced into the autoclave reactor was about 100 mL. The reactants were mixed together with the catalyst in the reactor, the temperature was raised to 200 ℃ with a built-in temperature controller, and the pressure was maintained at 30 bar with nitrogen. After 16 h reaction, the reactor was kept in an ice bath to reduce the temperature to 5–10 ℃; then, the catalysts and the reaction product were separated by centrifugation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 TGA/DTA The thermal decomposition (TGA/DTA) of the synthesized Cu-Zn-Al hydrotalcite (HTLc) curves are shown in Fig. 1. From the diagram, it is evident that there are distinct regions of endotherms similar to those found in layered double hydroxides and hydrotalcite structures. These endotherms are in the range of 0–200 ℃, 300 ℃, and beyond [19]. The first range can be attributed to the loss of moisture content and other volatiles presents. The second may be due to the removal of anions such as OH-, CO3 2- etc., in the form of H2O and CO2 [20–22]. The third one is due to the collapse of the crystalline structure, i.e., hydrotalcite-like structure. The formation of hydrotalcite structure can be confirmed by XRD analysis. In the thermal behavior of HTLc and as in this particular case, there are two transitions, one of which is the loss of interlayer anions without the collapse of the structure of HTLc, and this particular stage is reversible, which is commonly referred to as the memory effect, which is endothermic in nature. The second transition is the collapse of the crystalline structure. These curves can also be used to derive the temperature (350 ℃) at which the catalyst should be calcined for further use. 3.1.2 XRD The XRD analyses were performed on a precursor that is an oven-dried and a calcined catalyst, as shown in Fig. S1 and Table 1. The XRD pattern of the precursor shows peaks similar to those of hydrotalcite-like structure; similar peaks have also been reported in previous studies [23]. The peaks at 11.50, 23.24, 34.44, 39.01, 46.5, 59.86 reported from the uncalcined sample (precursor) correspond to (003), (006), (105), (108), (110), and (113), confirming the typical pattern of Cu-Zn-Al HTLc (JCPDS 38–487). This shows that the obtained Cu-Zn-Al HTLc have a regular layered structure with 3 R symmetry of HTLcc. Moreover, malachite peaks of hydrotalcite-like Cu-Zn hydroxycarbonate are also detected (JCPDS: 41–1390). Malachite favors the formation of a distorted octahedral structure due to the Jahn-Teller retroaction of Cu2+ ions. The average particle sizes calculated by the Scherrer equation are 18.7 nm (CZA3), 23.1 nm (CZA4), 26.2 nm (CZA5), and 28.1 nm (CZA6). Few weak CuO diffractions can also be observed, indicating that the Cu2+ cations are not completely situated between the layered hydroxides or increase the intermetallic distance [24]. As the ratio of M2+/M3+ decreases, the peak intensity becomes broad. With an increase in the ratio of (Cu+Zn)/Al, the intensity of the ZnO peaks also increases. Very weak CuO peaks are observed in the precursor, the oven-dried samples. This XRD analysis is in agreement with SEM images showing a lamellar type structure. At a lower ratio of (Cu+Zn)/Al, i.e., higher Al content, the peaks are merged [25]. The crystallinity of the CZA catalyst increased with an increase in the ratios of (Cu+Zn)/Al, i.e., sharp peaks are observed. In contrast, with decreasing ratio, the crystallinity decreased and peaks become broad and fuzzy in the XRD pattern. The average crystalline size of ZnO is 8.43 nm, while that of CuO is 8.29 nm."
7,FTIR,"3.2 FTIR FTIR is commonly used to determine the functional groups in the calcined and uncalcined sample, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2. The broad spectra in the range between 3000 and 3600 cm-1 correspond to the hydroxyl groups present between the interlayer of the hydrotalcite (in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). After calcination, these peaks become somewhat sharp, indicating that these hydroxyl groups have been converted to H2O. This can also be confirmed by TGA as there is a mass loss, which may contribute to the release of hydroxyl groups. The stretching peaks in the range of 1300–1400 cm-1 and bending between 750 and 780 cm-1 can be attributed to nitrate groups present [19,26]. At lower wavelengths, there are random peaks that may correspond to the presence of M-OH stretching. Bands between 650 and 670 cm-1 correspond to the presence of interlayer carbonate, the presence of which is also confirmed by XRD. The spectra of the calcined catalyst are sharper, confirming transformation of the crystalline structure by the removal of CO2 and water molecules."
8,FE-SEM,"3.3 FE-SEM The morphological examination of the catalyst surface with FE-SEM is shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, CZA3, CZA4, CZA5, and CZA6 catalysts exhibit the Zn/Al effect on catalyst morphology. When the Zn/Al molar ratio increased, the structure of petal-like nanosheets gradually disappears, and more irregular shapes are formed. However, when the Zn/Al molar ratio increased, the surface area and pore volume increased as the Zn improved the dispersity in the catalyst. When the molar Zn/Al ratio increased above 5, the Zn dispersion in the pores of the catalyst is saturated, resulting in a decrease in the surface area and the pore volume. SEM images show the formation of well-developed pellets, such as the crystal structure, as reported in the previous studies [19]. These crystals are in the range of 50–500 nm and correspond to the crystal sizes as determined from XRD patterns. The particles are difficult to distinguish individually because the edges are connected. The semi-transparent thin pellets can be observed because the electron beam easily penetrates them. 3.3.1 CO2-TPD Hydrotalcite-like structures, mainly based on Cu Zn Al, have numerous nonactive sites. Weakly basic sites such as hydroxyl groups and strongly basic sites of metal oxide are common in hydrotalcite. A typical CO2 desorption pattern shows three peaks in the range of 100–700 °C, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The three peaks correspond to the three types of basicity such as weakly basic sites, mainly due to the presence of Brønsted OH groups, moderate basic sites involving Lewis sites of the metal oxide, and the third peak corresponds to the same sites, but these are very strong due to poorly coordinated O2- acid-base pairs, and a temperature higher than 450 °C is required to release the captured CO2 [27,28]. Sometimes there is a super-strong peak in the range of 800–1000 °C. These super-strong base sites are mainly due to the type of support used. The thermal decomposition areas are very similar to previous studies with the hydrotalcite-like structure or layered double hydroxides [19,20]. Since mass loss occurs during heating, the CO2 produced by simple heating is also determined. HTLc structures contain CO3 2- anions between the intermediate layers. These are converted to CO2 to determine the precise CO2 adsorption. The decomposition of the catalysts was also monitored according to the methods reported in previous studies [29,30]. The actual desorption of CO2 was determined by subtracting the amount desorbed during decomposition from the CO2-TPD analysis. The overall basicity of the CZA catalyst was in the following order when the Cu/Zn ratio was adjusted: CZA5 (2.15 mmol/g)>CZA6 (1.86 mmol/g)>CZA4 (1.68 mmol/g)>CZA3 (1.45 mmol/g). 3.3.2 NH3-TPD To determine the acidic sites of the catalyst, NH3-TPD was carried out. The profile shows three types of peaks, called weak acidic sites, moderate sites, and strong acidic sites ( Fig. 5). The peaks of weak acidic sites are in the range below 200 ℃; moderate acidic sites are in the range between 300 ℃ and 500 ℃, and strong acidic sites are above 500 ℃. The catalyst with the lowest ratio of (Cu+Zn)/Al has the lowest amount of acidic sites, which is reflected in the result of the catalytic reactions because it has the lowest conversion. The following order of the acidic sites of the synthesized catalyst was found: CZA5 (4.56 mmol/g) >CZA6 (3.84 mmol/g) >CZA4 (3.12 mmol/g) >CZA3 (1.32 mmol/g). The catalyst CZA5 has the highest amount of acidic sites, as shown in Table 2. It can be concluded that these different peaks belong to different types of metallic oxides present in the catalyst. Kumar et al. [20] have conducted extensive studies on the profile TPD. They have examined the patterns obtained from pure copper and zinc oxides. Their patterns indicated the presence of weak and moderate acidic sites on these oxides. Weak acidic sites are attributed to the weak interaction between ammonia and the hydroxyl group, as they can easily form a hydrogen bond. However, the moderate acidic sites are due to stronger Lewis sites in the interaction of trivalent Al3+ and divalent Zn2+ with ammonia. They have also investigated that CuO has only Lewis sites and that these sites occur in the range 200 ℃−300 ℃. Therefore, it can be concluded that these catalysts have both types of acidic sites."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.4 Catalytic activity The indirect hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO in the presence of Cu-Zn-Al based catalyst was investigated. However, the H2 donor (in-situ H2 formation reaction) was generated by ethanol reforming or ethanol decomposition reaction (formed H2, CH4, CO and CO2) in parallel with glycerol hydrogenolysis. The formed H2 is used in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. For all reactions, we focused on the quantification of the liquid products detected during the glycerol reaction (1,2-PDO, ethylene glycol, allyl alcohol, hydroxyacetone, acetol (1-hydroxypropan-2-one), etc.). The gaseous phase generated was not analyzed but consists mainly of gaseous products formed during the reforming and decomposition of glycerol (H2, CH4, CO and CO2) [31,32]. Hydrotalcite or layered double hydroxide (LDH) compounds have both acidic and basic sites. LDH compounds have a two-dimensional layered structure with metal hydroxide sheets and negatively charged interlayer anions such as NO3 -, Cl-, or CO3 2-. In this study, hydrotalcite structures with different ratios of (Cu + Zn)/Al were prepared, and the basicity and acidity can be changed with different proportions of the respective salts. The calculated conversion of glycerol was lowest for CZA3, about 34%, with 57% selectivity of 1,2-PDO. For CZA4 and CZA6, the conversion increases slightly, by 38% with a selectivity of 63% and 38% with a selectivity of 66%, respectively, and the highest conversion was found for CZA5, which was about 43% with a 69% selectivity, shown in Table 3. The basicity of the catalysts controlled the catalytic activity. The catalyst CZA5, which had the highest basicity and Cu favors hydrogen mobility, gave the maximum conversion. The liquid product reached the highest selectivity of 69% 1,2-PDO at 43% glycerol conversion in the presence of CZA5. According to these results, the acidity and basicity of the catalysts play an important role in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. Moreover, the dehydration of glycerol to acetol occurs at acidic sites, and then the hydrogenation of acetol to 1,2-PDO occurs at the active metallic sites of the catalyst. Therefore, among other factors, the acidity of the support is also important. However, the H2 donors reaction was produced in parallel with glycerol hydrogenolysis, and this reaction also depends on the metal phase, basic and acidic sites of the catalyst [33–35]. Moreover, the dehydration of glycerol to formed acetol occurs at acidic sites, and further acetol hydrogenation to 1,2-PDO occurs at the metallic sites of the catalyst. The applicability of bifunctional catalysts has been extensively discussed, and several published papers have addressed it in various reactions [36–44]. Some have interpreted the increase in catalytic activity as an increase in acidity [14,45,46], while others have reported an increase in activity upon addition of NaOH. These results indicate that the conversion of isopropanol is also initiated on similar active sites for glycerol conversion; however, the reaction inhibition is not as significant as with other alcoholic H donors. A possible reaction mechanism for the hydrogenation of glycerol with a Cu-based catalyst using a hydrogen donor (ethanol, butanol, 2-propanol, formic acid, or methanol) can be adopted as shown in Scheme 1. The first step of the proposed reaction would be ethanol dehydrogenation and the dehydrogenation of glycerol and acetol formation as an intermediate. Basic catalyst sites would have been helpful in this step. Other active sites on Cu assist the hydrogenation of acetol with hydrogen from ethanol and the final conversion to 1,2-PDO. The ethanol was converted to acetaldehyde and further decomposed to ethyl acetate, 1-butanol and others. Traces of acetol, acetaldehyde, and butanol were present in the product samples."
10,Conclusions,"This study focused on the hydrogenation of glycerol to produce 1,2-propanediol in a hydrogen-free environment. Various Cu-Zn-Al ratios were used in the catalyst synthesis, and ethanol was used as a hydrogen donor. The basicity of the catalyst played an important role in the conversion of glycerol, and Cu was required for ethanol dehydrogenation. The conversion and selectivity to 1,2-PDO were maximum for the CZA5 catalyst. A trace amount of acetol and acetaldehyde were found in the products. Based on this observation, acetols’ reaction mechanism was proposed as an intermediate for glycerol hydrogenation and acetaldehyde for ethanol hydrogenation."
