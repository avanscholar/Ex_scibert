0,Introduction,"Benzyl alcohol is widely utilised as a solvent for inks, paints and lacquers and as precursor to a range of esters in the cosmetics and flavouring industries [1]. Industrial production via benzyl chloride hydrolysis releases chlorine with significant by-product (benzyl ether and NaCl) formation while toluene oxidation consumes large quantities of solvents with the inclusion of toxic bromides to enhance alcohol yield [2,3]. As an alternative, benzaldehyde hydrogenation has been promoted over Rh and Ru complexes using alcohols and organic acids as hydrogen donors [4,5]. Product separation and catalyst reuse are facilitated by switching to heterogeneous systems. Application of solid catalysts has focused on liquid phase reaction over Ni, Ru, Pt and Pd on a range of supports (monolith, Al2O3, activated carbon and SiO2) [6–9]; pertinent conversion/selectivity and associated reaction conditions are compiled in Table 1 . Okamoto and co-workers [9] recorded 100% alcohol selectivity at partial aldehyde conversion (84%) over polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified Pd/SiO2. Zhao et al. [10] achieved near complete benzaldehyde conversion and full selectivity to benzyl alcohol over Pt/C at elevated H2 pressure (4MPa). Gas phase continuous operation has employed a series of metal oxides (ZnO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and TiO2) [11] and oxide supported Pt, Cu and Ni [12–14]. Supported Pt exhibited superior performance with full selectivity to the alcohol at conversions up to 80% over Pt/TiO2 (Table 1), attributed to CO activation at the metal-support interface [12]. Product distribution over supported Cu was dependent on support and temperature where Cu/SiO2 delivered high selectivity (83% at 373K) but there was no detectable alcohol formation over Cu on Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 or ZrO2 irrespective of temperature [13]. Exclusive CO reduction, circumventing hydrogenolysis and phenyl ring reduction at high conversions remains challenging [14]. Oxide supported Au has exhibited enhanced chemoselectivity in the hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones relative to standard transition metal catalysts [15,16]. This is offset somewhat by lower reaction rates due to the lesser capacity of Au for H2 activation [16]. In previous work, we reported exclusive hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3 (prepared by impregnation) under conditions where Ni/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 were non-selective [17]. Complete selectivity over Au/Al2O3 was obtained at low hydrogenation rates (conversion≤15%). As an extension to that work, we have evaluated the catalytic action of Au/Al2O3 prepared by deposition–precipitation to generate smaller Au size. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time the use of water as an environmentally benign aldehyde carrier to elevate catalytic productivity in continuous gas phase operation (at 0.1MPa) with 100% alcohol yield. We also assess the catalytic performance of Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 to validate the promotional effect of water."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation The γ-Al2O3 (Puralox, Condea Vista) and TiO2 (P25, Degussa) supports were used as received. The ZrO2 carrier was synthesised by ZrOCl2 (0.1M) precipitation with aqueous NH3 (2.5M) under vigorous stirring (600rpm) at pH9.4–11.8. The hydrogel was dried at 373K (24h) and calcined (1Kmin−1) in 60cm3 min−1 air at 673K (5h). Alumina supported Au prepared by impregnation (Au/Al2O3-IMP) is described in detail elsewhere [17]. Synthesis by deposition–precipitation (Au/Al2O3-DP, Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2) employed an aqueous solution of urea (100 fold excess) and HAuCl4 (5×10−4 M) with support addition, heating the suspension to 353K (2Kmin−1), which was maintained for 3h with a pH increase to ca. 7. The solid was washed and dried in He (45cm3 min−1) at 373K (2Kmin−1) for 5h. Catalyst precursors were sieved into a batch of 75μm average diameter and activated at 2Kmin−1 to 473–603K in 60cm3 min−1 H2."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Gold content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 chemisorption were recorded on the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit, as described previously [17]. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using the Micromeritics Gemini 2390 system where total surface area was determined using the standard BET method and cumulative pore volumes by BJH analysis. Powder X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer. Diffractograms were identified using JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. Au (Card No. 04-0784) and γ-Al2O3 (10-0425). Gold particle size and morphology were determined by transmission (TEM, JEOL JEM 2011) and scanning transmission (STEM, JEOL 2200FS) electron microscopy. Samples for analysis were prepared by dispersion in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300Mesh). Surface area weighted mean Au size (dTEM ) was obtained from a count of at least 300 particles."
4,Catalytic procedure,"2.3 Catalytic procedure Catalyst testing was carried out in situ after activation in a continuous flow fixed-bed tubular reactor (i.d. =15mm, l =30cm). Isothermal conditions (393–423±1K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst with ground glass (75μm). Benzaldehyde was delivered as ethanolic or aqueous solutions via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). A co-current flow of benzaldehyde and H2 was maintained at GHSV =2×104 h−1 with an inlet benzaldehyde flow (F) of 4.8×10−5 molh−1. The molar Au to benzaldehyde feed rate (n/F) spanned the range 1.2×10−2–9×10−2 h. The reactor effluent was condensed in liquid nitrogen for analysis by capillary GC (Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL). Benzaldehyde (Fluka, ≥98%), benzyl alcohol (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99%) and ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%) were used as received. Repeated reaction with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered conversion/selectivity values that were reproducible to better than ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Textural characteristics of the four catalysts considered in this study are given in Table 2 . TPR of Au/Al2O3-DP and Au/Al2O3-IMP generated profiles shown in Fig. 1 with temperature maxima (Tmax ) in H2 consumption at 450K and 415K. A single TPR peak over 434–490K has been reported elsewhere for Au/Al2O3 and ascribed to the reduction of Au3+ species to Au0 [18]. The H2 consumed coincided with that required for precursor reduction (theoretical values recorded in Table 2). The reduction profile for Au/Al2O3-IMP spanned a lower temperature range than Au/Al2O3-DP, suggesting weaker precursor–support interactions that result in more facile reduction. Activation of Au/ZrO2 exhibited a similar Tmax (452K) to Au/Al2O3-DP and matched the requirement for Au3+ →Au0 (Table 2). The Tmax recorded for Au/TiO2 reduction was lower than that for Au/Al2O3-DP. Excess H2 consumption during the TPR of Au/TiO2 can be attributed to partial support reduction [19]. Delannoy et al. [20] considered the possible role of the carrier to modify Au precursor reducibility and proposed an order of decreasing reducibility (TiO2 >CeO2 >Al2O3) that is consistent with our results. Analysis by XRD generated the diffractograms presented in Fig. 2 . Au/Al2O3-DP exhibited diffraction peaks at 2θ =37.6°, 39.5°, 45.9° and 67.0° corresponding to (311), (222), (400) and (440) planes of γ-Al2O3. There was no detectable signal due to Au, suggesting a well dispersed Au phase. In contrast, signals at 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.6° and 77.5° for Au/Al2O3-IMP can be assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Au, diagnostic of larger Au particles. This was confirmed by TEM/STEM analysis and representative images are given in Fig. 3 . The Au particles exhibited a quasi-spherical morphology with a narrower distribution of smaller Au particles on Au/Al2O3-DP (2–8nm, mean=4.3nm) relative to Au/Al2O3-IMP (1–21nm, mean=7.9nm). This agrees with the literature where catalyst preparation by DP generated smaller Au particles and the residual chloride associated with IMP samples resulted in mobility and agglomeration of Au species during thermal treatment [21]. Gold particle size distribution (2–9nm, mean=4.5nm) on TiO2 was close to that determined for Au/Al2O3-DP, whereas Au/ZrO2 exhibited larger Au size (3–12nm, mean=7.0nm). Hydrogen uptake/activation is a critical catalyst property in hydrogenation applications. We have noted previously [17] that H2 chemisorption on Au/Al2O3-IMP at ambient temperature (<1μmolg−1) was appreciably lower than that reported for oxide supported transition metals, e.g. Ni/Al2O3 (4μmolg−1) and Pd/Al2O3 (24μmolg−1). Hydrogen chemisorption on supported Au is an activated process with increased uptake under reaction conditions (45–318μmolgAu −1 at 413K, Table 2). Bus et al. [22] have shown that H2 chemisorption is favoured on smaller Au particles (supported on Al2O3) that possess a higher fraction of low coordinated Au atoms at corners and edge sites. This agrees with the higher uptake that we have recorded for Au/Al2O3-DP relative to Au/Al2O3-IMP."
7,Catalyst activity and selectivity,"3.2 Catalyst activity and selectivity Time on-stream conversion (X) and benzyl alcohol selectivity (S) over Au/Al2O3-DP and Au/Al2O3-IMP exhibit a temporal decline (Fig. 4 ). Initial conversion (X 0) can be extracted from fitting the data to X − X 0 X 3 h − X 0 = Δ t β + Δ t where β is a time scale fitting parameter and X 3h is the conversion after 3h on-stream. Initial conversions were used to determine turnover frequency (TOF 0, calculated using Au dispersion obtained from TEM analysis) where Au/Al2O3-DP delivered a significantly higher value (86h−1) than Au/Al2O3-IMP (30h−1). We attribute this to the occurrence of smaller nano-scale Au particles on Au/Al2O3-DP and greater H2 uptake (Table 2). Mohr et al. [23] demonstrated structure sensitivity in the hydrogenation of acrolein over Au/ZrO2 where TOF increased with decreasing particle diameter (from 8 to 4nm). However, there is insufficient published data to establish any clear consensus regarding Au size effects in CO reduction. The influence of temperature on Au/Al2O3-DP catalytic response with ethanol as carrier can be assessed from Table 3 where conversion was elevated at higher temperatures with the formation of toluene as by-product (at 423K). We note that Saadi et al. [13] have reported preferential production of benzyl alcohol over supported Ni and Cu at low reaction temperature (<373K) with the occurrence of toluene at temperatures >383K. Exclusivity to the alcohol is challenging as illustrated by the reaction pathways in Fig. 5 , where toluene formation occurs via consecutive hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol or direct conversion of benzaldehyde. Benzene results from scission of the aldehydic CH bond [24]; there was no detectable benzene formation in this study. The solvent can influence activity and selectivity, notably in batch liquid operation. Solvent effects in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are associated with polarity, H2 solubility and surface interactions [25]. In gas phase applications, the solvent serves as a carrier and possible contributions to catalyst performance have not been studied. Green chemistry principles highlight the use of innocuous (non-toxic) solvents where water can serve as an inexpensive and benign polar solvent. In this study, use of water as carrier resulted in a dramatic increase in conversion, while retaining full selectivity to benzyl alcohol (Table 3). Moreover, an increase in the n/F parameter, which equates to contact time, resulted in the complete conversion of the inlet benzaldehyde and 100% selectivity to the alcohol. This represents unprecedented selective hydrogenation efficiency with respect to the existing literature (Table 1) for both liquid and gas phase operations. The beneficial effect of water as carrier in terms of elevated selective hydrogenation rate extended to Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 (Table 4 ). The promotional role of water on CO reduction in the liquid phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was attributed to facilitated interaction of the hydrophilic CO moiety with surface catalytic sites [26]. In gas phase hydrogenation over supported Au, activity is limited by available surface reactive hydrogen and any additional hydrogen supply should elevate rate. The generation of surface hydrogen (protons) from water dissociation is promoted by Lewis acid sites on Al2O3 [27] and oxygen vacancies on TiO2 [28]. The abstracted protons can bond with two-coordinate O2− sites on the support to form bridging hydroxyl groups. Buchanan and Web [29] have demonstrated that surface hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 act as a source of atomic ‘hydrogen’ and dehydroxylated Au/Al2O3 was inactive in butadiene hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations have established that the dissociation energy of water on Al and Au sites is in the ranges 0.83–2.12eV [30] and 0.61–2.2eV [31,32], respectively that are of the same magnitude as the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on Au (0.16–1.4eV) [33,34]. Activity of Au/ZrO2 in the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been correlated with surface hydroxyl group density where dehydroxylated Au/ZrO2 was inactive and activity was partially recovered by water treatment [35]. We therefore attribute the beneficial effect of water as carrier to a facilitated surface dissociation that generates reactive hydrogen."
8,Conclusion,"Gas phase hydrogenation of benzaldehyde over Au supported on Al2O3, ZrO2 and TiO2 was fully selective to benzyl alcohol as the target product. Increased benzaldehyde TOF over Au/Al2O3 prepared by deposition–precipitation is associated with increased H2 uptake on well dispersed Au (mean particle size=4.3nm) relative to synthesis by impregnation (mean=7.9nm). Use of an aqueous rather than ethanolic benzaldehyde feed delivered appreciably higher chemoselective rates with 100% benzyl alcohol yield. This is attributed to water dissociation on the catalyst surface, generating reactive hydrogen that compensates for the limited capability of Au to dissociate H2, with an overall increased hydrogenation rate. This promotional effect extends to benzaldehyde conversion over Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2."
