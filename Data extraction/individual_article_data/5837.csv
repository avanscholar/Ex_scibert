0,Introduction,"It was reported that the annual production of cotton fabrics for textiles and other applications exceeded 28 million tons in 2009, which for about 2/5 of the global market of textile fibers (Engelhardt, 2010). Generally, used clothes and leftover materials of textile industry end in waste stations are usually landfilled or incinerated (Miranda, Sosa-Blanco, Bustos-Martinez, & Vasile, 2007). These disposing methods not only create environmental pollution but also lead to great waste of the valuable resources. Therefore, recycling waste cotton fabrics (WCFs) into value-added products is an attractive and viable option for both environmental and economic benefits.During recent years, a number of methods have been pursued for recycling WCFs to value-added products, such as preparing cellulose derivatives (Ratanakamnuan, Atong, & Aht-Ong, 2012; Xiong, Lu, Zhang, Zhou, & Zhang, 2013) and energy production (Isci & Demirer, 2007; Jeihanipour & Taherzadeh, 2009; Shen et al., 2013). One potential way to high-value utilizing WCFs is extracting microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) from WCFs (Chuayjuljit, Su-Uthai, Tunwattanaseree, & Charuchinda, 2009) and used as reinforcement for composite materials (Chuayjuljit et al., 2009; Chuayjuljit, Su-Uthai, & Charuchinda, 2012; Saowaroj, Su-Uthai, & Charuchinda, 2010; Spoljaric, Genovese, & Shanks, 2009) due to its unique chemical and physical properties (Haafiz, Eichhorn, Hassan, & Jawaid, 2013; Mathew, Oksman, & Sain, 2005). However, the combination of MCC with the matrix encounters a considerable problem associated with the incompatibility between the polar and hydrophilic MCC fiber and the non-polar and hydrophobic polymer matrix. Recently, as a polar and biodegradable polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which could be manufactured from non-petroleum resources has attracted world concerns for developing ecofriendly composites (Jia et al., 2007). PVA has a large number of hydroxyl groups along its polymer chains, and most of the hydroxyl groups could form either inter- or intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, PVA is well suited for preparing composites with cellulose fiber because both of them are highly polar materials and the large amount of hydroxyl groups on these two materials may facilitate interfacial interactions through hydrogen bonding, leading to desirable adhesion at the PVA/cellulose fiber composites interfaces. However, to our best knowledge, most PVA/cellulose composites are limited in the solution processing (Cheng, Wang, & Rials, 2009; Ibrahim et al., 2010; Kadokawa, Takegawa, Mine, & Prasad, 2011 ; Nishio & Manley, 1998; Zia et al., 2012; Zuber et al., 2012), which could only yield low dimension PVA products because of the large consumption of energy and time at the dissolving and drying process. Thus, its application areas are significantly constrained. The melt-processing of PVA is a big challenge worldwide because its melting temperature (T m) is very close to its decomposition temperature (T d). Realization of melt-processing of PVA would be a great development in PVA industry. The author's laboratory (Zhen, Lu, Li, & Liang, 2012) has realized the melt-processing of PVA by using formamide and water as plasticizer which can form inter-molecular complexes with PVA through hydrogen bond. This plasticization technology adopted for melt-processing of PVA is much more effective, simple and cost-saving compared with the traditional solution-based processing technology. The formamide/water compound plasticizer was also used in this work. To our best knowledge, few publications have been reported concerning on PVA/MCC composites. The aim of this work was to prepare melt-processed PVA composites with formamide and water as plasticizers, using MCC which was extracted from the WCFs as reinforcement. The influence of MCC on the structure and properties of the PVA/MCC composites was investigated and discussed in detail."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Waste cotton fabrics (WCFs) were collected from tailoring workshops and subjected to cutting and shredding processes. Poly(vinyl alcohol) 1799, with degree of polymerization 1750±50 and degree of alcoholysis of 99%, was provided by SINOPEC Sichuan Vinylon Works, China. Analytical grade formamide, sodium hydroxide, acetone, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulfuric acid were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Plant."
3,Preparation of MCC,"2.2 Preparation of MCC MCC was prepared by hydrolyzing WCFs, and the procedure is according to Xiong, Zhang, Tian, Zhou, and Lu (2012) as follows: WCFs (100g) and 700mL of 3% NaOH were mixed and boiled with slow stirring for 6h. After cooling, WCFs were washed by distilled water, followed by boiling with 0.6% NaClO for 30min. Then they were washed by distilled water again. 68% Nitric acid, 37% hydrochloric acid and distilled water were mixed at a ratio of 1:2:2 (v/v) to obtain the mixed acid. The acid mixture (700mL) was used to hydrolyze WCFs at 60°C for 1h to produce MCC. The obtained MCC was filtered and washed to reach neutrality by distilled water. Further wash by 95% ethanol was done until the filtrate was colorless. Finally it was washed by acetone and filtrated using a vacuum pump. It was dried at 80°C and smashed to obtain product. It was found the yield of MCC obtained from WCFs is as high as approximately 90%, which is higher than wood, agricultural residues and other materials (El-Sakhawy & Hassan, 2007). WCFs appear a good raw material to prepare MCC, since it presents high cellulose content (Miranda et al., 2007)."
4,Preparation of PVA/MCC composites through melt-processing,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/MCC composites through melt-processing PVA, water, formamide (2:1:1 in weight) and MCC were mixed in a high-speed mixer (1000rpm) at room temperature for 10min. After that, these mixtures were sealed for a week to achieve sufficient diffusion of plasticizers into PVA. The content of additional MCC was expressed as parts per hundreds of PVA (0, 5, 10, 15, 20phr), respectively. The PVA blends were melt-mixed using a Brabender Plasti-corder PL2000 mixing machine with a mixing volume of 50cm3 at 150°C and 30rpm for 10min. After the blends were taken out of the mixing chamber, they were cooled to room temperature and broken up with a crusher. These mixtures were molded using a mini-injection molding machine (HAAKE Minijet, USA) into samples with the dimension of 75mm×4mm×2mm (length×width×thickness). The barrel temperature of the Minijet was 170°C and the mold temperature was 80°C. The injection pressure and the holding pressure were 60MPa and the holding time was 10s."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 FTIR analysis Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the PVA/MCC composites were conducted by means of a Nicolet 560 spectrophotometer (USA), taking over 20 scans for each sample with a resolution of 2cm−1, ranging from 400 to 4000cm−1. The samples were prepared by using the KBr-disk method. All the samples were dried in vacuum oven at 60°C for 24h before testing. 2.4.2 FT-Raman Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker FT-Raman spectrometer VERTEX-70 (Bruker Optics, Germany) using a diode pumped Nd:YAG laser at an operating wavelength of 1064nm. The measurements were performed using the 180° angle scattering geometry with 100 scans and a laser power of 500mW at the sample location. Samples of PVA/MCC composites were from the injection molding. The interferograms were apodized with the Blackman–Harris 4-term function and Fourier-transformed to obtain spectra with a resolution of 4cm−1. 2.4.3 Thermal property analysis Curves of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis for the samples were recorded on a NETZSH 204 DSC differential scanning calorimeter under a flowing N2 with sample weight 5mg. The thermal properties of all samples were measured by heating from ambient temperature to 250°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The degree of crystallinity of PVA was calculated based on the following equation. (1) χ c = Δ H m w Δ H m 0 where w is the weight fraction of PVA matrix in the composites, ΔH m is the heat of fusion and Δ H m 0 is the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline PVA which has a value of 161J/g (Uddin, Fujie, Sembo, & Gotoh, 2012). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen purge (flow rate about 100mL/min) was performed using a TA-2000 analyzer (TA Instrument), the scanning rate of 10°C/min and temperature range of 40–600°C was used. Samples of about 5mg were placed in an open alumina crucible. All the samples were vacuum oven dried at 60°C for 24h before testing. 2.4.4 XRD X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Philips Analytical X’Pert X-diffractometer (Philips Co., Netherlands), using Cu-Ka radiation (λ =0.1540nm) at an accelerating voltage of 40kV and the current of 40mA. The data were collected from 2θ =5–60° with a step interval of 0.03°. The crystallite size was calculated by using the Scherrer equation: (2) D = K λ β 1 / 2 cos θ where D is the “apparent crystallite size”, and β 1/2 is the full width of the diffraction peak measured at half maximum height (FWHM), constant K equals to 0.94. 2.4.5 SEM studies The morphology of the MCC particles and the cryofractured surface of PVA/MCC composites were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-5600, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 20kV. The samples were mounted on metal stubs using double side adhesive tapes. The samples were previously sputter coated with gold to prevent charging on the surface. 2.4.6 Molau test The Molau test (Molau & Wittbrodt, 1968) was used to study the interfacial interaction between the PVA matrix and MCC. In a typical example, melt-processed PVA/MCC composite (20phr MCC content) and PVA/MCC composite film prepared by solution casting method (20phr MCC content) were dissolved in water in a test tube at 60°C and agitated to form a uniform suspension. The solution was laid for 48h at ambient temperature, and then the suspension state was carefully observed. 2.4.7 Tensile tests The stress–strain properties were measured according to ASTM D 412-80 specification using dumb-bell test pieces by an Instron 5567 Universal Testing Machine at a crosshead speed of 100mm/min. At least five measurements for each sample were made in order to eliminate experimental error. All the samples were vacuum oven dried at 60°C to reach a constant weight before testing. 2.4.8 Dynamic mechanical analysis Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed in tensile mode on a DMAQ800 analyzer (USA). Temperature scans at 1Hz frequency were carried out at a heating rate of 5°C/min from −30 to 210°C. Samples of PVA/MCC composites were from the injection molding and were dried in vacuum oven at 60°C for 24h before testing."
6,Results and discussion,
7,FTIR and FT-Raman analysis,"3.1 FTIR and FT-Raman analysis Fig. 1(a) shows the FTIR spectra of WCFs and MCC. The absorption peak at 3416cm−1 which ascribed to the stretching vibration of OH groups of WCFs shifted toward lower wavelength after acid treatment, suggesting that the acid hydrolysis weakened the hydrogen bonding of cellulose (Ruan, Huang, & Zhang, 2005). The generation of free hydroxyl groups would benefit the formation of new hydrogen bonds with PVA. During the plasticization by formamide and water, the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds of PVA were broken. Consequently, the resulting free hydroxyl groups between formamide molecules and PVA molecules are expected to establish new hydrogen bonds during the melt-processing treatment. This claim is supported by FTIR spectra of neat PVA and PVA/MCC-0 composite as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this figure, the peaks at the wave numbers of 3416cm−1 (the stretching vibration peak of its side hydroxyl groups), 2923cm−1 (the CH2 group stretching vibration), 1145cm−1 (crystalline domains of PVA) and 1096cm−1 (the CO group) are characteristic peaks of neat PVA (Chhatri et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2009). The absorption peak at 3416cm−1 (the stretching vibration of OH groups) of neat PVA blue shifts (19cm−1) after the addition of formamide and water which indicates that the hydrogen bond could be formed between OH groups of PVA and the functional groups like NH2 and CO of formamide. It can be also seen that the absorption peak at 1145cm−1 slightly shifts toward the lower frequency after plasticization processing, suggesting the change of crystalline domains in PVA. The result is in accordance with the analysis of XRD as will be shown later. The FT-Raman spectra of neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites are given in Fig. 1(c). In this figure, the peaks at the wave numbers of 2908, 1444, 1363, 1147, 1094, 917 and 856cm−1 are attributed to neat PVA (Chhatri et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2003). It can be seen that the band intensity at 2908cm−1 of PVA becomes weaker after the addition of plasticizer, and the band of PVA/MCC-20 becomes much narrower and weaker compared with PVA/MCC-0, which indicates that PVA chain structure changed with the addition of formamide and MCC. The peaks at 1094 and 1147cm−l correspond to the infrared “crystallinity sensitive” band and dependent upon the crystallinity of PVA (Iwamoto, Miya, & Mima, 1979). These bands of PVA become weaker with the addition of MCC, which suggests the crystallization of PVA is suppressed by MCC. This result might be ascribed to the inter-molecular complexes formed through hydrogen bonding between MCC and PVA."
8,Thermal property analysis,"3.2 Thermal property analysis The key point to realize melt-processing of PVA is to decrease its T m and increase its T on, thus expanding its melt-processing window (T on − T m). DSC curves obtained from neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites are shown in Fig. 2 . The melting peak shows an obvious shift to lower temperature with the increase of MCC content. The DSC data of neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites are summarized in Table 1 . The T m of PVA decreases from 230 to 215°C with the incorporation of 20wt% MCC. Simultaneously, it could be found that when formamide and water was added to PVA, ΔH c and X c decreased remarkably as a result, suggesting that plasticizer could destroy the crystalline structure of PVA. The results indicated that formamide and water reduced the interaction of PVA chains and facilitated their chain movement. When MCC was added to PVA, such an effect was even greater. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that MCC have a strong interaction with PVA as well, and they will further destroy regular arrangement of molecular chains. Higher filler dispersion and interfacial adhesion is thought to hinder polymer chains regular rearrangements to some extent and hence inhibited crystallization of PVA. Fig. 3 shows the TG and DTG curves of WCFs, MCC, neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), MCC has similar thermal stability compared with WCFs. There is a single degradation step for WCFs and MCC, which starts from about 326°C and shows maximum decomposition at around 355°C. This result indicates that acid hydrolysis do not reduce the thermal stability of cellulose. Fig. 3(c) shows that there are two major weight losses for neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites in the range of 200–500°C, which could be attributed to the structural decomposition of PVA (Lu, Wang, & Drzal, 2008). All PVA/MCC samples show a small peak at about 205°C in derive curves (Fig. 4(c)), which is due to the evaporation of formamide in the composites. As indicated in Fig. 3(c) and (d), the onset decomposition temperature and the major degradation peak temperature of PVA/MCC composites notably shift toward higher temperature with the increase of MCC content, which demonstrating that MCC significantly improved the thermal stability of the composites. The enhancement of thermal stability of PVA with the incorporation of MCC could be explained by the higher stability of the MCC and particularly by the excellent compatibility between MCC and PVA matrix. It is obvious that the T m of the PVA/MCC composites moves to lower temperature and the T on moves to higher temperature with the increase of MCC content as shown in Table 1. As a result, the melt-processing window was remarkably expanded. A melt-processing window of 54°C is achieved when the content of MCC reaches 20wt%."
9,XRD analysis,"3.3 XRD analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful instrument for characterization of polymer crystalline structure. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of WCFs and MCC (Fig. 4(a)), neat PVA and PVA/MCC composites (Fig. 4(b)). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the diffractograms of WCFs and MCC exhibit main crystal planes of the crystalline cellulose I structure with the main characteristic peaks localized at 14.9°, 16.8°, 22.8° and 34.5°, which are assigned to the diffraction planes of 101, 101, 002, and 040, respectively (El-Sakhawy & Hassan, 2007; Gindl & Keckes, 2005). The results indicated that the crystalline structure of WCFs was essentially maintained in the MCC particles. On the other hand, the crystallinity index of MCC was calculated to be 87.1% through intensity measurements at 22° and 19° (amorphous background) according to the report by Levis and Deasy (2001). As shown in Fig. 4(b), neat PVA exhibits a significant crystalline peak at about 19.4° that assigned to the diffraction planes of 200, which was due to the strong inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding (Lu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2007). Obviously, with the addition of MCC into PVA matrix, the diffractograms of the composites display the characteristic peaks of the two components. The intensity of the diffraction peaks resulted from MCC increases with the increase of MCC content. Based on intermolecular complexation, formamide and MCC has a potential to form new hydrogen bonding with PVA by replacing the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding of PVA. In this way, the crystallization of PVA was inhibited. Fig. 4(b) shows the crystalline peaks of neat PVA are significantly weakened after the plasticization with formamide and water. Meanwhile, the intensity of the diffraction peak of the PVA/MCC composites at about 19.4° became lower and narrower with the increase of MCC content. Furthermore, the crystallite size of PVA decreases from 9.51 to 8.76nm with the incorporation of 20wt% MCC (Table 1). This is probably because the presence of MCC can induce a restricted mobility of PVA chains by forming hydrogen bonds in the interface, which is corresponded with the DSC result. This effect could be used to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites."
10,Morphological analysis,"3.4 Morphological analysis Under a drastic condition of acid hydrolysis, cellulose chains cause bond cleavage, i.e., hydrolytic cleavage of glycosidic bonds between two anhydroglucose units, producing short-chain cellulose. The amorphous component was reduced to acid-soluble end products, leaving behind the crystalline regions. Acid hydrolysis followed by mechanical stirring results in disintegration of cellulose into small irregular MCC particles (Das et al., 2009). Fig. 5(a) shows the SEM image of MCC. As seen from the figure that shortening of fibers occurred and rod-like MCC particles were formed. The particle size of the prepared MCC is irregular with broad particle size distribution from several to tens of microns. The degree of dispersion and the bonding ability between matrix and reinforcing phase is one of the most critical factors in determining the properties of any composite materials (Mathew et al., 2005). Fig. 5(b) and (c) shows the SEM images of PVA/MCC composites with 5wt% (Fig. 5(b)) and 20wt% (Fig. 5(c)) MCC, respectively. It can be seen that there are well-dispersed bright dots and short rods on the fractured section of composites, which are consistent with the ends of MCC in the polymer matrix. No large agglomerates of the fillers and good adhesion between the matrix and fillers are observed, which should play an important role in improving the mechanical performance and thermal properties of the resulting materials."
11,Molau test,"3.5 Molau test In the Molau test (Tian, Chen, & Guo, 2005), polymer-based composites were dissolved in solvent and then the dispersion state of the solution is observed. If the interfacial interaction between two components of the composites was not formed, the solution would separate into two parts; otherwise, the two components of solution would not be separated even after a long time, and a persistent turbidity comes into view. The Molau test results are shown in Fig. 5(d). It can be seen that MCC in melt-processed PVA/MCC composites is well distributed in solution after 48h and the sediment is not obviously. However, the solution of PVA/MCC film prepared by solution casting was separated into two parts quickly (20min) – a clear solution containing PVA on the top of test tube and the deposition of MCC particles at the bottom. The results indicate that MCC could establish strong interfacial interaction with PVA through hydrogen bonding after melt-processing."
12,Mechanical properties,"3.6 Mechanical properties The compound of MCC is also expected to improve tensile properties of the PVA/MCC composites. Fig. 6 shows the Young's modulus (Fig. 6(a)) and tensile strength, elongation at break (Fig. 6(b)) of PVA/MCC composites. The Young's modulus of PVA/MCC composites increases with increasing MCC content. Compared with the modulus of PVA/MCC-0 (204.8MPa), that of PVA/MCC-20 (731.2MPa) significantly increased by 257.0%. A similar increase of Young's modulus was reported by Zimmermann, Pöhler, and Geiger (2004), for cellulose fibrils isolated from sulphite pulp reinforced PVA composites. This outstanding property may be attributed to the formation of a networked structure above percolation threshold (Samir, Alloin, & Dufresne, 2005) which was produced by cellulose fibers interactions through hydrogen bonding. In general, the Young's modulus of polymers can be increased by the reinforcement of cellulose fibers, while the tensile strength does not improve or sometimes decreases due to flocculation of cellulose fibers (Ibrahim, El-Zawawy, & Nassar, 2010). For example, Mathew et al. (2005) reported that the incorporation of MCC has a negative effect on the tensile strength of poly(lactic acid), which was decreased from its original 49.6 to 38.2MPa with the addition of 10wt% MCC. However, it is apparent that the incorporation of MCC into the PVA led to an improvement in tensile strength (Fig. 6(b)) and Young's modulus simultaneously in this study. The tensile strength of PVA/MCC composites increased from 37.8 to 46.5MPa by 23.0%. These results further confirm the presence of strong interfacial interaction and good dispersion between MCC and PVA. The tensile strength decreased apparently when the content of MCC is above 25phr, which may be attributed to the aggregation of MCC at higher filler content. On the other hand, there is no obvious decrease in the elongation at break of the PVA/MCC composites with increasing MCC content, which is favorable for the performance of the composites."
13,Dynamic mechanical analysis,"3.7 Dynamic mechanical analysis Fig. 7 shows the storage modulus and tan δ versus temperature for PVA/MCC composites. In Fig. 7(a), it can be seen that the storage modulus of all the samples decreases with increasing temperature. The PVA/MCC composites show an increasing trend of storage modulus as compared with PVA/MCC-0 over the entire temperature span, suggesting improved thermal–mechanical properties of the composites. When the MCC content reaches 20wt%, the storage modulus exhibits a remarkable increment. This result is in accordance with tensile testing due to the strong interfacial interactions through hydrogen bonding between MCC with large specific surface and PVA matrix. The improvement in storage modulus was most significant before 60°C, where the molecular relaxation occurs for PVA. By incorporating MCC into PVA matrix, the glass transition temperature (T g) of PVA shifts to higher temperature from 17.6 to 30.3°C. The increase in T g due to the incorporation of MCC might be attributed to the occurrence of intermolecular interactions occurred between MCC and PVA matrix, which reduces the flexibility of molecular chains of PVA (Tsagaropoulos & Eisenberg, 1995). This behavior is consistent with the results of previous studies dealing with the preparation of MCC-reinforced polymer composites (Mathew et al., 2005; Spoljaric et al., 2009). Furthermore, a slight decrease in the tan δ peak at T g is observed with increasing MCC content (Fig. 7(b)). Apparently, a smaller proportion of the PVA matrix participated in the glass transition when MCC were present. This indicates favorable matrix–fiber interaction and possibly the formation of an interphase matrix layer, either immobilized or of reduced molecular mobility (Wu, Henriksson, Liu, & Berglund, 2007)."
14,Conclusion,"Recycling WCFs into the value-added products is an attractive option for environmental and economic benefits. We have demonstrated a viable and efficient approach to prepare ecocomposites based on plasticized PVA and MCC extracted from WCFs through melt-processing. The waste-derived MCC was used as reinforcement to enhance melt-processability of PVA, using formamide and water as plasticizer. It was shown that formamide and MCC could form inter-molecular complexes with PVA through hydrogen bonding and confine the crystallization of PVA. The melt-processing window of PVA/MCC composites was expanded up to 54°C with the incorporation of 20wt% MCC, and the mechanical properties of the resulting PVA/MCC composites were significantly improved. This work aims at demonstrating the value-added utilization of waste cotton fabrics and the feasibility of making WCFs-based high performance ecocomposites on industrial-scale production."
