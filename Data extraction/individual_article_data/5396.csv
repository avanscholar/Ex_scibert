0,Introduction,"Solar driven photocatalysis exhibited potentials in energy conversion and environmental remediation, especially in water splitting to produce hydrogen (H2) for converting and storing the sustainable solar energy [1]. As a promising metal-free organic semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become a hot research spot in photocatalytic H2 generation since 2009, owing to its visible light-responsivity, high chemical stability, excellent redox ability, and low-cost precursors [2,3]. However, the photocatalytic activity of bulk g-C3N4 was still too low to be applied in practice, primarily due to its low specific surface area and insufficient reactive sites, and sluggish charge transfer. A variety of strategies, such as element doping, heterojunction construction [4], nanostructure engineering [5], co-catalyst loading [6], and carbon material (graphene, carbon nanotube, and carbon quantum dots etc.) modifying [7,8], have been explored, aiming to improve the photocatalytic activity. Among these approaches, structural engineering is an effective method to promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs [9,10]. Recently, one-dimensional (1D) g-C3N4 nanotubes have received considerable attentions because of their unique 1D structural, electronic, and optical properties [11,12]. One-dimensional tubular g-C3N4 with open channel presented superior visible-light photocatalytic activity because of its decreased mass transfer resistance, reduced reactant diffusion distance, improved light-harvesting, and enhanced photogenerated carriers transfer. Zhou and co-workers synthesized 1D P-doped tubular g-C3N4 by calcining assembly supramolecular precursors prepared from the hydrolysis of melamine, which exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to bulk g-C3N4 [13]. However, more charge transfer tunnels and active sites are still required to further improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of tubular g-C3N4 [14,15]. Graphene has been considered as a promising candidate to modify and improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, owing to its high conductivity and large specific surface area [16–18]. However, there are some limitations when applying graphene in photocatalytic H2 evolution, such as the electronic properties damage and nanosheets aggregation during chemical exfoliation and reduction process, the hydrophobic nature and insufficient reactive sites for H2 evolution [19,20]. Thus, it is highly desirable to find alternative materials to overcome these shortcomings. Ti3C2 MXene, an emerging 2D transition metal carbide, has been widely applied in photocatalysis to promote the activity. The superiorities include highly hydrophilicity, excellent metallic conductivity, high structural stability, substantial surface active sites and outstanding visible light harvesting [21,22]. Moreover, benefiting from the abundant functional groups (O, OH and F) on the surface of Ti3C2 and its tunable work-function, a Schottky junction with strong interface contact can be constructed between Ti3C2 MXenes and other semiconductors to promote the spatial charges separation and transfer [23–25]. Yang et al. reported on a 2D/2D interfacial Schottky junction, Ti3C2/g-C3N4 with the high activity in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production [26]. The Schottky effect and built-in electric field accelerated the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Besides, owing to the surface terminal Ti sites and the close to zero of Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) in O-terminated Ti3C2, 2D Ti3C2 MXene has been regarded as an efficient co-catalyst in improving photocatalytic H2 production [27–29]. Su et al. synthesized 2D/2D heterojunction of Ti3C2/g-C3N4 nanosheets, which exhibited a high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (72.3 μmol/h/g) [30]. However, it is a complex process to completely exfoliate bulk g-C3N4. Thus, it is very difficult to achieve face-to-face junction between Ti3C2 and g-C3N4. Therefore, it may be more feasible to fabricate 1D/2D architectures of g–C3N4–based photocatalyst, which has been rarely reported. In this work, we developed a facile electrostatic self-assembly method to prepare novel 1D/2D P-doped tubular g-C3N4/Ti3C2 Schottky junction. In this composite, P-doped tubular g-C3N4 (PTCN) exhibited narrower band gap, and 1D channel for transferring electrons, and the delaminated 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets were served as the fast electron transfer channel to promote the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers, so as to improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Mechanism of the enhancement has been comprehensively studied and proposed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ti3AlC2 MAX (325 mesh, purity >99%) was purchased from Forsman Scientific (Beijing). Melamine, Hydrofluoric acid (40 wt.%), lithium fluoride (LiF), phosphorous acid (H3PO3), anhydrous ethanol, and hydrochloric acid (36∼38 wt.%, HCl) were analytic grade reagents and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of multilayered and delaminated Ti3C2 MXene Multilayered Ti3C2 MXene was synthesized by etching out Al layer from Ti3AlC2 MAX with concentrated HF [31]. Delaminated Ti3C2 MXene nanosheet was synthesized by the etching and intercalating of hydrofluoric acid mixture formed in-situ of LiF/HCl. Briefly, 4.0 g of LiF was dispersed into 40 mL of HCl solution (9 M), and then 2.0 g of Ti3AlC2 MAX was slowly added to above mixed solution and stirred constantly for 48 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the black precipitate was obtained by centrifugation and washing repeatedly with deionized water until the pH value of the supernatant over 6. The resulting sediment was dispersed and exfoliated in 200 mL of deionized water by hand-shaking. After centrifugation for 0.5 h at a rate of 4000 rpm to removal unexfoliated Ti3C2, the dark green supernatant was collected. Subsequently, the supernatant was filtered with vacuum through a PVDF membrane (0.22 μm of pore size) and dried in 60 °C for 12 h, the stacked monolayer Ti3C2 (s-Ti3C2) was obtained and the mass concentration of Ti3C2 colloidal solution was determined. Finally, the delaminated Ti3C2 colloidal solution was diluted to 1 mg/mL. 2.2.2 Synthesis of P-doped tubular g-C3N4 The route of supramolecular self-assembly and calcination was utilized to synthesize P-doped tubular g-C3N4. Melamine (0.90 g) and solid H3PO3 (0.40 g) were dissolved in 70 mL of 80 °C deionized water with stirring for 0.5 h. Then, the above aqueous solution was transferred to 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the needlelike solid was obtained by filtrating and washing with deionized water several times, and then dried at 60 °C. Subsequently, the obtained supramolecular precursor was calcined at 550 °C under N2 atmosphere for 2 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min to synthesize P-doped tubular g-C3N4, marked as PTCN. Bulk g-C3N4 was synthesized by calcining the pristine melamine under the same condition, denoted as BCN. 2.2.3 Synthesis of tubular g-C3N4/Ti3C2 hybrids An electrostatic self-assembly route was taken to prepare the tubular g-C3N4/Ti3C2 composite. Specifically, 200 mg of PTCN was added into 100 mL of HCl aqueous solution (0.5 M) and stirred for 2 h. Finally, the protonated PTCN was obtained by filtration and multiple washing, then dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water. Then 4 mL of Ti3C2 colloid was dropped into protonated PTCN suspension with stirring for 2 h. Finally, the precipitate was separated by filtration, dried at 60 °C. The obtained sample was labelled as PTCN/TC-2. Adjusting the added volume of Ti3C2 colloid, PTCN/TC-1 and PTCN/TC-3 were also synthesized. For comparison, according to the above procedure, BCN replaced PTCN to synthesize BCN/TC, and multilayered Ti3C2 replaced delaminated Ti3C2 flake to synthesize PTCN/MTC. Besides, P-doped tubular g-C3N4/reduced graphene oxide composite (PTCN/rGO) was also synthesized, specific details were described in Supporting Information."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The Zeta potential was measured at room temperature by a Zeta potential analyzer (Horiba, SZ-100). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) was used to observe the morphology and microstructure, and record the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping of the samples. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken on electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of samples were performed on XPS spectrometer (Thermo, EScalab 250) equipped with Mg Kα X-ray source, and the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as reference for all identified peaks. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo, Nicolet 6700). Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) was measured on Hitachi U-4100 with BaSO4 as reference background. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured on the fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh, FLS980) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (Supporting Information). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) was measured by scanning ESCA microprobe (ULVAC, PHI5000 VersaProbe III) using He I (21.22 eV) as light source under a bias of −5 V. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on the standard three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, CHI660E). Platinum and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) were served as counter electrode and reference electrode in the electrolyte of sodium sulfate aqueous solution (0.1 M), respectively. Working electrode was prepared as following: 5 mg of sample was added to the mixture of anhydrous ethanol (150 μL) and Nafion (15 μL) with 30 min ultrasound, then 10 μL of above slurry was dropped onto the cleaned FTO glass (active area: 1 cm2) and dried in air. Transient photocurrent was performed under 300 W–Xe lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300C) irradiation on the 60 s on–off cycle without bias voltage. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested under open-circuit potential with an amplitude of 5 mV with a frequency from 10−1 to 105 Hz. The Mott–Schottky (M−S) curves of samples were tested at the different frequency of 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, and 2000 Hz. The polarization curve of samples was tested with a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The potential versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode was converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale by using the Nernst equation (Eq. (1)). (1) E NHE = E Ag / AgCl + 0 . 197"
5,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of sample was tested on an online gas analysis system (PerfectLight, Labsolar 6 A). A 300 W Xeon lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300C) as light source was settled on 4 cm distance to the reactor. As-prepared sample (30 mg) was dispersed in the solution consisting of methyl alcohol (20 mL) and deionized water (80 mL). After vacuumed for 30 min, the reaction mixture was irradiated by the Xeon lamp with continuously stirring. The amount of generated H2 was measured on a gas chromatograph (PerfectLight, shiweipx GC7806) with nitrogen as carrier gas. The average generation rate of H2 was calculated in 4 h reaction time. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured by the same photocatalytic reaction conditions, and its calculation method was shown in Supporting Information."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and physicochemical properties,"3.1 Synthesis and physicochemical properties The synthesis process of P-doped tubular g-C3N4 decorated by Ti3C2 nanosheets (PTCN/TC) was shown in Fig. 1 a. Melamine was partly transformed to cyanuric acid under phosphorous acid assisted hydrothermal process, then the melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular precursor with phosphorous acid wrapped in or adsorbed was generated. After the calcination process, the P-doped tubular g-C3N4 (PTCN) was formed. The delaminated Ti3C2 nanosheet was synthesized by the in-situ formed HF etching and Li+ intercalating. After the protonation of PTCN, the Ti3C2 nanosheets were decorated onto the surface of PTCN by the electrostatic self-assembly, which was testified by Zeta potential analysis. Fig. 1b showed that the potentials of protonated PTCN and Ti3C2 surface were determined as 21.5 mV and −45.3 mV, respectively. Therefore, the spontaneous self-assembly between the positively charged PTCN and negatively charged Ti3C2 nanosheets was realized by the electrostatic interaction. The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared samples were characterized by SEM and HRTEM. The cross-section of Ti3C2 film (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1) showed the successful exfoliation of Ti3C2 flake from multilayer Ti3AlC2 MAX. Obviously, PTCN exhibited a hollow tubular structure with a diameter of 2–5 μm (Fig. 1d), which ensure the larger specific surface areas and more efficient electron transport than that of bulk g-C3N4. After the protonation of HCl and surface decoration of Ti3C2, a tubular structure was still maintained in PTCN/TC-2 sample (Fig. 1e), yet its length was slightly reduced and its surface was wrapped by some nanosheet. Besides, HRTEM images (Fig. 1f and g) confirmed the few-layer of Ti3C2 and the tube/nanosheets (1D/2D) heterojunction of PTCN/TC-2. In high magnification (Fig. 1h), the lattice spacing of 0.98 nm and 0.263 nm were assigned to the (002) and (110) crystal plane of Ti3C2 MXene, respectively [32]. In Fig. 1i, the EDX elemental mapping results exhibited the uniform spatial distribution of C, N, and P elements, and the sporadic distribution of Ti element was related to the Ti3C2 nanosheets position wrapped in the surface of PTCN. The above results demonstrated the successful synthesis of P-doped tubular g-C3N4 modified with delaminated 2D Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets via the intimate interfacial contact of electrostatic self-assembly. The crystal structures of as-prepared samples were confirmed by the XRD (Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2a, after etching by HF or HCl/LiF, the characteristic peaks at 34.0° (100), 38.8° (104), 41.7° (105), 48.4° (107) and 56.4° (109) assigned to Ti3AlC2 were disappeared in multilayer Ti3C2 and s-Ti3C2 patterns. Meanwhile, broadening and negative shift of the peaks of (002) and (004) facets were observed, indicating Ti3AlC2 was etched out Al layer and transformed to Ti3C2 MXene successfully. Compared with multilayer Ti3C2, there was a further negative shift of (002) peak from 8.9° to 5.9° for s-Ti3C2 sample, indicating the successful delamination of Ti3C2. The XRD pattern of bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) exhibited two evident diffraction peaks at 13.0° (100) and 27.5° (002) in Fig. 2b. The (002) diffraction peak of PTCN was broader and weaker than that of BCN, indicating the distinct size dependent properties of tubular structure [12]. The XRD patterns of tubular g-C3N4/Ti3C2 hybrids were similar to the diffraction peaks of PTCN, and the characteristic diffraction peak of Ti3C2 MXene around 6.6° was observed in PTCN/TC-2 and PTCN/TC-3, testifying that the composites of PTCN and Ti3C2 nanosheets were prepared successfully. Fig. 3 displayed the FT-IR spectra of s-Ti3C2, BCN, PTCN, and PTCN/Ti3C2 composites. There were no obvious characteristic peaks in s-Ti3C2, which was in accordance with other reports [26]. For BCN, PTCN, and PTCN/TC composites, the peak near 806 cm−1 could be attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of tris-triazine units. Apparently, the series of peaks in the range of 1200 cm−1 to 1650 cm−1 arise from the typical stretching vibration of CN heterocycles in g-C3N4 [33]. Besides, the broad peak located around 2900 cm−1 to 3400 cm−1 could be attributed to the uncondensed terminally residual amino (NH2/NH) or the hydroxyl of surface absorbed H2O (OH) stretching vibration. Compared with BCN, FT-IR results confirmed that PTCN and PTCN/TC composites possessed a typical g-C3N4 structure, and P heteroatom doped could not change the fundamental framework. However, the stretching or vibration peaks of P-related functional groups could not be observed due to the low content of phosphorus in PTCN. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state of as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the XPS survey spectra confirmed the presence of Ti, C, O and F elements in Ti3C2, and the successful removal of Al species. PTCN presented the mainly composed of C, N, and O elements. After the incorporation of Ti3C2 nanosheets, elements of Ti, C, and F could be found in PTCN/TC-2 composite. Although, P signal could not be observed in the survey spectrum of PTCN and PTCN/TC hybrids due to its low content, the high-resolution P 2p spectrum confirmed the existent of phosphorus element (Fig. S3). The peak of P 2p for PTCN/TC-2 and PTCN was located around 133.6 eV, which was typical for P–N coordination (P–C bonding was 1–2 eV lower), indicating that P probably replaces C in triazine rings [34]. In high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4b), PTCN exhibited two main peaks, which were deconvoluted into three peaks located at 284.8 eV, 286.6 eV, and 288.2 eV. The binding energy peak at 288.2 eV was attributed to the typical sp2-bonded carbon of NCN coordination the framework of g-C3N4, while peaks at 284.8 eV and 286.6 eV were assigned to C–C bond of adventitious carbon, and sp3-bonded carbon of C–N, respectively [35,36]. For PTCN/TC-2, emerging peak at 281.2 eV was designated to C–Ti of Ti3C2 [37], and the peaks of NCN and C–N were positively shifted to 288.3 eV and 286.7 eV, respectively. In the N 1s region (Fig. 4c), there were four peaks (398.8 eV, 400.1 eV, 401.3 eV, and 404.3 eV) fitted in the curve of PTCN sample, which could be assigned to CNC, N(C)3, CNH, and charging effect of π-excitations, respectively [38]. The N 1s spectrum of PTCN/TC-2 was similar to that of PTCN, but N-bonded peaks shifted to more positive binding energy positions. Besides, high-resolution Ti 2p was deconvoluted into four doublets (2p3/2–2p1/2) with fixed area ratio 2:1 and doublet separation of 5.7 eV. In Fig. 4d, the peak pattern of PTCN/TC-2 (×4 magnifications) was similar to s-Ti3C2, while an obvious nagetive shift of peak was observed. For PTCN/TC-2, the Ti 2p3/2 components were located at 454.2 eV, 455.1 eV, 456.5 eV, and 458.4 eV, assigning to Ti–C, Ti-X of substoichiometric TiCX (x < 1) or titanium oxycarbides, Ti ions with reduced charge state (TixOy), and TiO2, respectively [39,40]. Combined with the changes of C 1s and N 1s bonds shifting to higher binding energy, it was demonstrated that the electrons transferred from g-C3N4 to Ti3C2 in the PTCN/TC-2 composite due to the strong Schottky effect, leading the increment of electron density in Ti3C2. Above results confirmed that the successful synthesis of P-doped g-C3N4 and its composite decorated by Ti3C2 nanosheets, and the interfacial Schottky effect between PTCN and Ti3C2. BET specific surface area and pore structures of samples were investigated in Fig. 5 . The isotherms of all samples could be categorized as type Ⅳ with a H3-type hysteresis loops (Fig. 5a), indicating the mesoporous characteristic of samples. The specific surface area of BCN, PTCN, and PTCN/TC-2 was 2.3 m2/g, 17.4 m2/g, and 17.6 m2/g, respectively. Besides, the pore size distribution plots of samples were shown in Fig. 5b. The pore sizes of PTCN and PTCN/TC-2 exhibited the broad distribution in the rage of 2 nm–60 nm, proving the micro/mesoporous structure. For PTCN/TC composite, the larger specific surface area could provide more active sites and facilitate the diffusion of reactants adsorption, enhancing the activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution."
8,Light-harvesting and spatial charge separation abilities,"3.2 Light-harvesting and spatial charge separation abilities The photoabsorption behaviors and band gap of as-prepared samples were investigated by the UV-vis DRS (Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 6a, Ti3C2 MXene exhibited an intense light absorption in the full-spectrum range and no obvious light absorption edge. A typical absorption edge around 437 nm was observed in the bulk g-C3N4 (BCN). The PTCN sample displayed a slight red shift of absorption edge and a slight enhancement of photoabsorption compared to BCN, indicating that P-doped and tubular morphology might result in superior photocatalytic activity for g-C3N4. Due to the excellent light-harvesting ability of Ti3C2 co-catalyst, an enhanced light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light region was observed in PTCN/TC composite, but the absorption edge of PTCN/TC composites no obvious changes. The absorbance in the visible light region (450∼800 nm) of PTCN/TC composites was significantly enhanced accompanying by the increase of Ti3C2 content, which was consistent with the gradually darker color of samples (Fig. S4). Although, such enhanced photoabsorption in visible light region would not excite more electrons to jump from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) in g-C3N4, it might still convert light to heat facilitate the local surface catalytic reaction dynamics by on catalyst due to the photothermal conversion characteristics of Ti3C2 [41–43]. Besides, the band gap (E g) of samples could be estimated by the transformed Kubelka–Munk function. According to the tangents intercept in the plots of [F(R∞)/hv]1/2 versus light energy (hv) as shown in Fig. S5, the E g of BCN and PTCN was determined to be 2.76 eV, and 2.70 eV, respectively. Apparently, PTCN/TC-2 sample exhibited the enhanced light-harvesting compared with bulk g-C3N4, contributing to yielding more photogenerated electrons and holes in heterojunction under light irradiation. In order to explore the spatial charges separation efficiency and transfer dynamics, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, photocurrent response, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were investigated for as-obtained samples. PL spectra collected the fluorescence emission derived from the recombination of photogenerated electron and holes, which was an effective measure to evaluate the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. Compared with BCN, the fluorescence intensity of PTCN exhibited an obvious decrease, which was probably attributed to the introduction of P–N impurity level to reduce the recombination of electrons and holes. Thereafter, a sharp decrease on fluorescence of PTCN/TC composites was observed (Fig. 7 a), indicating that modified by Ti3C2 on PTCN surface could substantially inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charges. There was the lowest fluorescence intensity in PTCN/TC-2 sample, which was further researched by TRPL for acquiring more behaviors about spatial charge separation and transfer. After absorbing photons, electrons inside semiconductor were excited and jumped into the excited state. Such electrons in unstable excited state spontaneously returned to thermal equilibrium state, accompanied by releasing the excess energy through the radiative and non-radiative decay processes [42]. The average fluorescence lifetime (τ ave) could be fitted by biexponential equation (Eq. S1). The short lifetime (τ 1) and long lifetime (τ 2) were attributed to the radiative recombination of photogenerated electron and holes, and non-radiative transfer of charges, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7b, PTCN/TC-2 showed an obvious decrease in short (τ 1 = 2.34 ns, A 1 = 31.65%), long (τ 2 = 9.86 ns, A 2 = 68.35%), and average (τ ave = 9.00 ns) fluorescence lifetime by comparing with PTCN (τ 1 = 2.46 ns, 31.65%; τ 2 = 9.93 ns, 68.35%; τ ave = 9.16 ns). Such phenomenon could be attributed to the existence of more efficient non-radiative decay pathways in PTCN/TC heterojunction, which was caused by the electron transfer from g-C3N4 to Ti3C2. Therefore, the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers could be significantly inhibited, benefiting from the effective interfacial charge transfer upon the heterojunction of g-C3N4/Ti3C2. The transient photocurrent response was also conducted to evidencing the spatial charge separation ability. Fig. 7c exhibited that all samples could immediately generate the positive and reproducible photocurrent when light irradiating in the on–off cycles, testifying the photosensitivity and stability of samples. Compared with BCN, the PTCN sample showed the elevated response photocurrent density, owing to its P-doped and tubular morphology. The surface P–N bond as an impurity state acted as electrons capture center and extended the light absorption, resulting to produce more photogenerated electrons [44]. After the decorating of Ti3C2 nanosheet, PTCN/TC composites presented the significant enhancement of photocurrent density, demonstrating that Ti3C2-heterojunction can facilitate the spatial charges separation. Besides, the highest photocurrent density was observed in PTCN/TC-2 curve, and thus few Ti3C2 nanosheets in heterostructure could not support charges separation efficiently, and excessive Ti3C2 may block light absorption of g-C3N4. The electronic conductivity and the interfacial charge transfer ability of BCN, PTCN, and PTCN/TC-2 samples were further investigated by EIS measurement. As shown in Fig. 7d, the PTCN/TC-2 exhibited an obvious decrease in radius arc size compared with that of BCN and PTCN, implying much lower interfacial resistance of charge transfer after Ti3C2 modified, which was contributed to efficient spatial charge separation and transfer during the photocatalytic process. The polarization curves were also conducted to characterize the auxiliary effect of catalytic H2 evolution by Ti3C2 MXene. Compared with BCN, PTCN sample exhibited the enhanced cathodic current density (Fig. S6), indicating that the surface P–N bonding could effectively promote surface reduction reaction kinetics [44]. Furthermore, the maximum cathodic current density of PTCN/TC-2 was observed, meaning that Ti3C2 MXene could further enhance the electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction activity because of its rapid electrons transmission and reaction active sites [45]. The above results collectively confirmed the contribution of Ti3C2 MXene in capturing and transferring photogenerated electrons, thereby boosting the photocatalytic activity over binary composites."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the as-obtained g-C3N4 samples was evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation by using methanol as a sacrificial agent. In Fig. 8a , bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) prepared by traditional method performed poor hydrogen production rate of about 107 μmol/h/g, which was lower than that of P-doped tubular g-C3N4 (PTCN, 184 μmol/h/g). PTCN exhibited the improved light-harvesting, higher specific surface area, tubular structure and higher efficiency of electron–hole separation, result in the better photocatalytic activity than that of BCN. After the modification of delaminated Ti3C2 nanosheets, the PTCN/TC composites exhibited the enhancement in photocatalytic activity compared with pristine PTCN. The optimized PTCN/TC-2 sample yielded the highest H2 evolution rate of 565 μmol/h/g, presenting about 5.3 and 3.0 -fold that of BCN and PTCN. Such enhancements were attributed to the excellent electronic transmission, outstanding light-harvesting, and Schottky effect of Ti3C2 MXene flake, which was served as electron acceptor and co-catalyst in composite photocatalyst. To demonstrate the repeatability of PTCN/TC-2 composite, a cycle experiment of photocatalytic H2 evolution was performed. There was a slight decrease in H2 production rate after four cycles (Fig. S7a). Furthermore, no obvious changes of structure and chemical composition were detected in the XRD and XPS results (Figs. S7b and 7c) compared with fresh photocatalyst after recycling test, indicating its good durability and high stability. For investigating the advancements of 1D/2D tube/nanosheet structured Ti3C2-based Schottky junction, BCN/TC, PTCN/MTC, and PTCN/rGO decorated with the same content of co-catalyst (2 wt.%) were prepared and exploited in photocatalytic H2 evolution (Fig. 8b). The morphology of multilayer Ti3C2 and graphene oxide was observed by SEM measurement (Fig. S8). Besides, the UV-vis DRS curves of the BCN/TC, PTCN/MTC, and PTCN/rGO samples were exhibited in Fig. S9. The BCN/TC photocatalyst exhibited a higher activity of H2 evolution than that of BCN, but less than that of PTCN/TC. Such results were attributed to the superiority of P-doped g-C3N4 microtube in light absorption, photogenerated carrier separation, and larger specific surface area. Graphene has been widely employed as an electron acceptor for photocatalyst to facilitate photogenerated charges separation owing to its excellent electrical conductivity [46]. An enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation activity was observed for PTCN/rGO (354 μmol/h/g) compared with pristine PTCN (184 μmol/h/g). However, photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of PTCN/TC-2 was 1.6 times that of PTCN/rGO. Herein, the lower activity of PTCN/rGO than PTCN/TC-2 could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the superb electrical conductivity of Ti3C2 was obtained by the LiF/HCl etching method, but the electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide synthesized by the chemical oxidation exfoliation was undesirability. The PL analysis (Fig. S10) evidenced a better separation efficiency of photogenerated charges for PTCN/TC-2 than that of PTCN/rGO. (ii) The hydrophilia of reduced graphene oxide was poor, leading to an unfavorable hydrogen evolution from water. Whereas, Ti3C2 possessed numerous hydrophilic functional groups (OH and O), promoting the strong interaction with water molecules on its surface. (iii) Ti3C2 MXene was composed of carbon and titanium, and the exposed terminal metal sites on Ti3C2 surface might bring a stronger redox reactivity than that of pure carbon material, confirmed by the enhanced cathode current of PTCN/TC-2 (Fig. S11). Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm of PTCN/TC-2 and PTCN/rGO was measured about 5.9% and 2.3%, respectively (Supporting Information). Compared with other non-noble co-catalysts (MoS2, Mo2C, Ni2P, NiO, Carbon, and Ni–Mo alloys) modified g-C3N4 based photocatalysts (Table S2), PTCN/TC-2 also possessed active photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. According to the mentioned results and discussion, 1D/2D architecture of PTCN and Ti3C2 flakes composites could promote the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges via the 1D channel and Schottky junction. Furthermore, Ti3C2 nanosheets played an important role on collecting the electrons and convey to reactive site on its surface for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, benefiting from its excellent conductivity and exposed transition metal sites."
10,Band structure and proposed photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Band structure and proposed photocatalytic mechanism To get insight information of electron band structure, Mott–Schottky plots were employed to determine the flat-band potential (E FB) by the impedance potential measurement. As shown in Fig. 9 a–c, BCN, PTCN and PTCN/TC-2 exhibited the positive slope of the linear partial, indicating the n-type semiconductor characteristic of samples. According to the tangents intercept of plots, E FB of BCN, PTCN, and PTCN/TC-2 was determined as −1.35 V, −1.29 V and −1.19 V vs. NHE, respectively. Generally, the E FB of g-C3N4 is about 0.1 V lower than conduction band potential (E CB) [47,48], which is depended on the electron effective mass and carrier concentration. Thus, the E CB of BCN and PTCN was −1.45 V and −1.39 V, respectively. Combined with the E g value of UV-vis DRS results, the VB potential (E VB) of BCN and PTCN was calculated as 1.31 V and 1.31 V vs. NHE by the formula (E VB = E CB + E g), respectively. Besides, XPS-valence band spectra were also conducted to confirm the same E VB value of BCN and PTCN, which was consistence with the above calculations (Fig. 9d). The energy band structure was illustrated in Fig. 9e. For PTCN, the conduction band edge shifted to more positive position with the band gap narrowing after P-doped, which may be explained by the introduction of impurity level and the confinement effect tubular structure [49,50]. Besides, an obviously positive shift of E FB on PTCN/TC-2 (E FB = −1.19 V vs. NHE) was observed after the decoration of Ti3C2 nanosheets in the surface of PTCN (Fig. 9c). Such change of flat band potential was mainly caused by the lower Fermi level of Ti3C2 and the establishment of Fermi level equilibrium between PTCN and Ti3C2 nanosheets. After all, the PTCN and PTCN/TC composites possessed a narrower band gap and enough negative CB potential for photocatalytic H2 production. From the XPS results (Section 3.2), the transfer of electrons from PTCN to Ti3C2 nanosheets after their interfacial contact, could be inferred since the binding energy negative shift of Ti 2p and positive shift of C 1s and N 1s peaks. In order to further confirm the transfer pathway of electrons between interfaces of g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 MXene, UPS spectra was employed to scrutinize the variations in the work function of samples. As shown in Fig. 10 , after Fermi level (E F) was calibrated to 0 eV, cutoff energy (E cutoff) of protonated PTCN, s-Ti3C2, and PTCN/TC-2 was 17.69 eV, 17.02 eV, and 17.14 eV vs. vacuum level, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding Work function (e Φ ) was calculated by the following formula (Eq. (2)) [51]. (2) e Φ = 21.22 − (E cutoff − E F) Apparently, the work function of Ti3C2 (4.20 eV) was higher than that of protonated PTCN (3.53 eV), thus a Schottky junction would be established after interfacial contact in the self-assembly process. Besides, an upshift (0.55 eV) of the work function for PTCN/TC-2 (4.08 eV) also demonstrated the existence of Schottky effect compared with that of protonated PTCN. According to the above results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism over PTCN/TC Schottky junction was proposed in Fig. 11 . The work functions of Ti3C2 and PTCN were determined to be 4.20 eV and 3.53 eV, respectively. When Ti3C2 and PTCN were in contact, the difference of Fermi level between PTCN and Ti3C2 drove the electrons to transfer from g-C3N4 to Ti3C2 nanosheet until achieving an equilibrium state of Fermi level, which was also confirmed by the positive shift of flat band potential for PTCN/TC-2 (Fig. 9c). Subsequently, a space charge layer would be generated, resulting in upward bending of energy band on PTCN and the formation of Schottky barrier. As a result, electrons were excited from VB of PTCN to its CB under light irradiation. The photogenerated electrons would conquer Schottky barrier and migrate from the CB of PTCN to Ti3C2 through built-in electric field. The Schottky junction could inhibit the back-diffusion of electrons, enhancing the spatial separation of photogenerated charges and prolonging the lifetime of active electrons. Benefiting from the excellent hydrophilicity, outstanding electrical conductivity, and sufficient active sites of Ti3C2 nanosheets, the transferred electrons would rapidly shuttle to Ti3C2 surface and react with absorbed protons to generate H2. Finally, the accumulated holes at VB of PTCN were consumed by the sacrificial agent, and thus the generation of new electrons was not affected. Therefore, the delaminated Ti3C2 nanosheets could be served as an efficient co-catalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution, owing to its superior light absorption, prominent electrical conductivity, high work function for engineering Schottky junction, excellent hydrophilia, and the exposed terminal metal sites on Ti3C2 flakes."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, the interfacial Schottky junction of P-doped tubular g-C3N4/Ti3C2 composite (PTCN/TC) with 1D/2D structured was successfully fabricated by an electrostatic self-assembly method. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of optimized g-C3N4/Ti3C2/(PTCN/TC-2, 565 μmol/h/g) was over 4.3 and 2.0 -fold higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 and PTCN, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of PTCN/TC-2 was 5.9% at 420 nm. Such enhanced activity of PTCN/TC-2 heterostructure was ascribed to the P-doped, unique 1D tubular structure, and close intimate Schottky junction contact between the delaminated Ti3C2 nanosheets and tubular g-C3N4. The 1D/2D architecture provided 1D pathway and sufficient interfacial contact for promoting the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 tube to metallic Ti3C2. Besides, the formation of the Schottky junction and accompanying built-in electric field could effectively prevent the electrons flowing back g-C3N4 to recombine with holes, further improving the separation of photogenerated charges. In contrast to reduced graphene oxide, ultrathin Ti3C2 flake with better conductivity and exposed transition metal sites, as co-catalyst decorating PTCN exhibited a higher activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution. This research will be contributed to understand the mechanism of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 Schottky junction photocatalysts on improving the efficient of solar-fuel production, and it is anticipated to be extended to the fabrication of other high activity photocatalysts by using Ti3C2 as electron sink and co-catalyst."
