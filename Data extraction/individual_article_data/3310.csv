0,Introduction,"Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is an attractive p-type oxide semiconductor for solar energy conversion due to its band gap of 2.17eV, which absorbs visible light, e.g., as a photocatalyst for electrochemical splitting of water and degradation of organic materials [1–5]. As a low cost material, Cu2O shows low toxicity and good environmental acceptability [6,7]. Until now, extensive research on Cu2O has focused on morphology control [8–10] and compositing with graphene oxide, C3N4, noble metal, TiO2, WO3, MoS2, etc. [11–21]. In fact, the development of new performance for Cu2O is an ongoing challenge. Exploring new intrinsic performances of Cu2O microcrystals has been of interest and importance [22–24]. Here a novel property of Cu2O microcrystals is discovered. It is used in generating hydrogen by degrading formaldehyde solution at room temperature. As far as we know, there have been some reports on the use of metal nanoparticles such as Cu, Au, Pt, Ni, Ag, and Pd to accelerate the rate of hydrogen production from formaldehyde solution [25–31], but these reactions only occur in an alkaline environment. In this paper, we demonstrate that Cu2O microcrystals serve as a highly efficient and convenient photo-activator for hydrogen generation from formaldehyde solution under non-alkaline conditions. By optimizing the reaction parameters such as sacrificial agent and crystal morphology, the rate of hydrogen generation is further increased. Photocatalytic activity of Cu2O {110} and {111} facets for decomposition of dye solution was different due to the different atom arrangement [32–35]. Herein, studies of their photochemical activities clearly reveal that lightly truncated rhombic dodecahedra with {110} surface exhibit superior photochemical properties in comparison with hexapod exposing {111} surface for the generation of hydrogen in degrading formaldehyde solution. This peculiarity of Cu2O microcrystals is attributed to their ability to produce photo-generated electrons, hydroxyl radicals and [Cu+]·paramagnetic during the reaction, all of which contribute greatly to the hydrogen evolution. To the best of our knowledge, [Cu+]·paramagnetic has never been used to directly induce the generation of hydrogen, degradation of formaldehyde solution, and production of abundant hydroxyl radicals."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and materials.,"2.1 Reagents and materials. Copper nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.5%, Tianjin JinKe Fine Chemical Industry Research Institute], formic acid (HCOOH, ≥88%, XiLong Chemical), ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, 25–28%, XiLong Chemical) and formalin (HCHO, 37–40%, XiLong Chemical) were all analytical grade (AR) and used as received without further purification. Powdered TiO2 (P25, Degussa), MgO (98%, Xilong Chemical), ZnO (99.99%, Tianjin JinKe Fine Chemical Industry Research Institute), and CaO (98%, Yili Fine Chemical) were used as received. Absolute ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH, 99.7%, AR, Beijing Chemical Works) and deionized water (H2O, 18MΩ) were used for all solution preparations and sample washing. The spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolyne N-oxide (DMPO, Dojindo) was analytical grade and diluted to 1mol/L. Research-grade argon gas (Ar, V/V ≥99.9993%) and nitrogen (N2, V/V ≥99.9993%) were used."
3,Cu2O microcrystal synthesis.,"2.2 Cu2O microcrystal synthesis. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.01mol) was dissolved in mixture solution of H2O (13mL) and C2H5OH (23mL) to obtain a blue solution. Then HCOOH (2mL) and NH3·H2O were added to the blue solution in sequence. NH3·H2O was used as a vital agent to tailor the final morphology of the Cu2O microcrystals [35]. Then, the solutions were transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves, which were all filled to 80% capacity (50mL) and then supersonically vibrated for 5min. Afterward, the autoclaves were sealed and heated at 150°C for 120min in an oven and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were collected and washed with distilled water and ethanol three times, and then dried in the air at room temperature for storage and analysis. Lightly truncated rhombic dodecahedra and hexapod Cu2O microcrystals were obtained when 3mL and 1.5mL of NH3·H2O were used, respectively."
4,Activity tests,"2.3 Activity tests The photochemical activities of Cu2O microcrystals and other photocatalysts were determined by measuring the volume of hydrogen produced from the formaldehyde solution. 10mg photo-activators and 10mg sacrifice agents were added into HCHO aqueous solutions [10mL formalin and 10mL H2O] to form mixed solutions, which were put in 50mL quartz tubes irradiated by a xenon lamp with light intensity about 50mW/cm2. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) light was from a xenon lamp and visible light was achieved by a cutoff filter (≥420nm). Prior to light irradiation, solutions were aerated with Ar for 10min to remove the air. The quartz tubes were kept at room temperature by circulating water, and the solution was stirred vigorously during the reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and with argon as the carrier gas. No CO or other gaseous product was detected in these processes. A manual head space sampling method is adopted. The needle of gas syringe is used to pierce through the resilient rubber connector for quartz tube and collect 1mL gas-phase products from the quartz tube. The gas is injected rapidly into GC injector. The percentage of hydrogen is analyzed by GC, and the hydrogen amount can be calculated."
5,Instrumentation,"2.4 Instrumentation The morphologies of the samples were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800Hitachi) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra measurements were performed on a Panalytical X’Pert Pro MPD instrument using Cu Kα radiation (50kV). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained on a JEOL JES-FA200 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cryostat. EPR spectra of photo-generated charges were recorded at cryogenic temperatures about 77K, while measurements using DMPO spin trap were performed at room temperature. The test condition for EPR spectrum is that 10mg MgO, 20mL HCHO aqueous solutions mixed with 10mg Cu2O lightly truncated rhombic dodecahedra under visible light or 10mg TiO2 under UV–vis light at room temperature. All solutions were degassed with nitrogen before illumination. Negative ions in the solutions were measured by ion chromatography (Metrohm 883 Basic IC plus) in the manner of suppression conductivity detection."
6,Results and discussion,"FE-SEM images of Cu2O microcrystals with different morphologies are shown in Fig. 1 (A) and (B). Hexapod exposes {111} facets, while lightly truncated rhombic dodecahedron mainly exposes {110} facets [35]. Cu2O and TiO2 were used as photo-activators to decompose HCHO aqueous solutions under visible or UV–visible lights employing MgO as a sacrificial agent. As shown in Fig. 2 (A), Cu2O microcrystals enclosed with {110} facets perform well in producing hydrogen from formaldehyde solution. The amount of hydrogen evolution from the formaldehyde solution by TiO2 is negligible. Likewise, other photo-activator semiconductors, such as ZnO, Bi2O3, Fe2O3, and CuO, show no activity in producing hydrogen. The effect of OH− ions on hydrogen evolution is evaluated, as shown in Fig. 2(A-e). The amount of hydrogen evolution is negligible when NaOH is added to the solution to increase the pH value, because the OH− ion induced hydrogen generation process is temperature dependent [36]. Therefore, it can be inferred that the hydrogen production is greatly dependent on the presence of Cu2O microcrystals and MgO. In addition, the hydrogen yield by Cu2O microcrystals under visible light is significantly higher than that in the dark. To sum up, the presence of Cu2O, MgO, and light illumination are essential to efficiently produce hydrogen from formaldehyde solution as confirmed by Fig. 2(A). We examined the Cu2O microcrystals by X-ray diffraction (XRD) before and after their use in hydrogen evolution from formaldehyde solution. As Fig. 1(C) shows, there is a transformation from Cu2O (JCPDS 78-2076) to Cu (JCPDS 85-1326) in the hydrogen evolution process. We performed two controls: one was that the Cu2O was replaced by Cu and hydrogen releasing rate was very low, another was that the light was turned off at the second hour during the experiment and the rate of H2 evolution was declined obviously during the additional four hours. This will be explained in detail below. Other alkaline oxides instead of MgO were investigated as sacrificial agents in the same experiment condition, as shown in Fig. 2(B). The hydrogen yields by Cu2O dodecahedra are higher when using MgO as a sacrificial agent than when CaO or ZnO is used. Then, the effect of MgO amount on hydrogen generation was studied, as Fig. 2(C) shows. As the amount of MgO increased from 0 to 10mg, the hydrogen production rate greatly increased. However, with further increasing the amount of MgO up to 30mg, the rate of hydrogen production decreased obviously. So the species and amount of sacrificial agents play a key role in this reaction process. The H2 generation rates (in Fig. 2) were gradually increased as the reaction time prolonged. Usually, there is an induction period in the early stages of the reaction [37–41]. Photo-activators need time to contact with the reaction solution and take light energy. The surface active radical gradually generated on photo-activators and the activity was enhanced. The reaction process is monitored by EPR spectrometer. Cu2O microcrystals exposing {110} facets and TiO2 (P25) were chosen as a catalyst, respectively. MgO was added as a sacrificial agent and DMPO as a spin trap. Signals about the formation of DMPO-OH adducts are observed as shown in Fig. 3 (A-a), which does not arise in Fig. 3(A-b). This proves that the formation of hydroxyl radicals is attributed to the presence of Cu2O. To elucidate the activity of Cu2O microcrystals for hydrogen production, EPR measurements were taken at 77K in order to reduce the charge recombination rate [42]. Fig. 3(B) presents the EPR spectra of different solutions containing Cu2O lightly truncated rhombic dodecahedra under visible light illumination. A distinct signal at g average =1.976 is shown in Fig. 3(B-a), which approximates to the free electron g-value (2.0023) [43]. The EPR signals with g average =1.975 had been attributed to electrons trapped in the rutile (Ti3+)latt [44,45], herein, we associated the EPR signal at g average =1.976 with electrons trapped in Cu+ lattice, labeled as [Cu+]·paramagnetic. Fig. 3(B-b) shows an observable signature of Cu2+ hyperfine lines [46,47] but no signal at g average =1.976. Whereas in Fig. 3(B-c), there is neither observable signature at g average =1.976 nor Cu2+ hyperfine lines. In summary, the EPR spectra reveal that the corrosion of Cu2O and the subsequent Cu2+ ion formation in formaldehyde solution occur in the absence of MgO under visible light irradiation, while the presence of both HCHO and MgO contributes to the formation of paramagnetic [Cu+]·. Fig. 2(D) reveals that the activity of Cu2O microcrystals in hydrogen production is closely related to their crystal shapes. When the reaction time reaches 3h, the amount of hydrogen produced by Cu2O exposing {110} surface is 82.2μmol, while 50.5μmol hydrogen is produced by Cu2O exposing {111} surface. This indicates that {110} surface of Cu2O microcrystals shows higher photochemical activity than {111} surface for the generation of hydrogen from the formaldehyde solution. The amount of HCOO− ions in the solutions is measured by ion chromatography. There are 21.2μmol HCOO− ions in the initial formaldehyde solution, while the amount reaches 774.9μmol after the reaction. Cannizzaro disproportionation can result in a little existence of HCOO− ions in formaldehyde solution [25]. Furthermore, the amount of HCOO− ions has close relationship with Cu2O morphology. If Cu2O microcrystals exposing {111} facets are used, the amount of HCOO− ions in the formaldehyde solution is 659.9μmol after the reaction, less than that when Cu2O microcrystals exposing {110} facets are used. Summarizing the above results, we confirm that Cu2O microcrystal acts as an effective activator and MgO acts as an appropriate sacrificial agent in the process of hydrogen production from formaldehyde solution. Based on the above experimental results, we propose the reaction mechanism depicted in Fig. 4 , comprising two paths for the degradation of formaldehyde solution to hydrogen evolution operated by Cu2O microcrystals under visible light irradiation. In path A, Cu2O microcrystals generate electrons (e−) and holes (h+) under visible light irradiation, as the literatures reported [1,2]. The photogenerated holes react with H2O to create hydroxyl radicals and electrons combine with H+ ions derived from ionization of H2O to release hydrogen [45,48]. When NaOH is used as a sacrificial agent, H+ ions are consumed. Hence hydrogen evolution is restrained as shown in Fig. 2(A-e). In path B, the strong reducing HCHO first captures the oxygen atoms from the Cu2O microcrystal surface under visible light irradiation, and subsequently yields HCOOH. Since the Cu2O lattice consists of chains of linear OCuI O bonds [3], the CuI O bond of Cu2O the microcrystal surface is fractured. Cu□Cu forms on the Cu2O surface, which is the formation of [Cu+]·paramagnetic confirmed by the peculiar EPR signal at g average =1.976 [Fig. 3(B-a)]. One Cu□Cu indicates an oxygen vacancy between two Cu atoms. The [Cu+]·paramagnetic possesses a remarkable redox ability in reacting with H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals along with the evolution of hydrogen as the following equation. (1) [Cu+]+H2O → Cu+OH +1/2H2 The hydroxyl radicals from both path A and B play an important role in degradation of formaldehyde according to the following reaction: (2) OH+HCHO→HCOOH+1/2H2 The continuous generation of HCOOH raises H+ ions concentration and results in corrosion of the Cu2O microcrystal surface. Consequently, all catalytic processes depicted above are blocked, and Cu+ ions are produced. Furthermore, a dismutation reaction of Cu+ to Cu metal and Cu2+ ions occurs [49]. At this point, only the signature of Cu2+ hyperfine lines appears in Fig. 3(B-b), indicating that the generation of [Cu+]·paramagnetic is inhibited in the absence of MgO. [Cu+]·paramagnetic directly promotes the generation of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen. Hence hydrogen quantity decreases substantially in the absence of MgO, as shown in Fig. 2(C). So, HCOOH is desired to be consumed to maintain the appropriate concentration of H+ and guard against erosion of Cu2O microcrystals. This is why MgO is added as a sacrificial agent in the solution. Therefore, the phenomena shown in Fig. 2(B) and (C) can be explained. Other sacrificial agents, such as CaO and ZnO, can also consume HCOOH, but MgO performs best. We inferred that CaO can easily react with water and generate Ca(OH)2·Ca(OH)2 can consume HCOOH, but this will change the acid–base degree of reaction process and Ca(OH)2 impedes the Cu2O microcrystals from fully exploiting light [54]. ZnO possesses amphoteric nature and Zn2+ species, such as, Zn(OH)(HCOO)·nH2O, Zn(OH)3 − and Zn(OH)4 2−, can exist in the solution [50–53]. As a result, HCOOH cannot be consumed. So CaO and ZnO cannot effectively safeguard the solution environment comparing with MgO. Insufficient MgO may be unable to play an effective role in maintaining appropriate concentration of H+ ions and excessive MgO may impede Cu2O microcrystals from fully exploiting light, because the reaction rate is mainly limited by the number of catalytic centers [54–57]. When MgO is consumed completely in the experiment, Cu2O microcrystals begin to translate to Cu. Thus, Cu2O translates into Cu metal at the end of the experiment, as Fig. 1(C) shows. As stated above, some literatures have reported that Cu metal nanoparticles can accelerate the hydrogen production rate in highly alkaline solutions at room temperature [25,26]. They concluded that alkaline environment was necessary for their reaction. This validates the role of Cu2O microcrystals on hydrogen generation from non-alkaline formaldehyde solution in this work. Based on this mechanism, we also can explain why the {110} surface exhibits higher activity than the {111} surface as Fig. 2(D) shows through path B in Fig. 4. Because the {110} surface has a higher number density of surface copper atoms than the {111} surface [58], the {110} surface produces more [Cu+]·paramagnetic than the {111} surface, which is more advantageous to the generation of hydrogen from formaldehyde solution. This also explains why other semiconductor photocatalysts, such as ZnO, Bi2O3, Fe2O3, and CuO, show no activity in producing hydrogen under the same conditions. Thus, it can be seen that the formation of [Cu+]·paramagnetic plays a vital role for hydrogen generation."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, Cu2O microcrystals demonstrate good performance in producing hydrogen and degrading formaldehyde solution under visible light irradiation. Cu2O microcrystals play a role in two aspects of reactivity. First, the generation of electrons and holes from Cu2O results in production of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals. Second, the dissociation of the CuI O bond of the Cu2O microcrystal surfaces causes the formation of [Cu+]·paramagnetic. Cu2O with {110} surface shows higher hydrogen generation activity than Cu2O with {111} surface. Alkaline earth oxides act as sacrifice agents to consume excessive H+ ions and ensure retaining the activity of Cu2O microcrystals. From the viewpoint of growing awareness of issues related to an increase in global energy demand and environment pollution, we believe that this highly efficient performance of Cu2O microcrystals will provide a very promising method of hydrogen generation for energy supplies and formaldehyde degradation for environmental remediation."
