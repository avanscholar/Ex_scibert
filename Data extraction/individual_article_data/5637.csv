0,Introduction,"Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (simplified as CNTs in later text) have been drawing increasing attention [1–3] since their discovery [4]. This new form of carbon is structurally close to hollow graphite fiber, except that it has a much higher degree of structural perfection. This kind of nanotube-C possesses several unique features, such as highly graphitized tube-wall, nanosized channel and sp 2-C-constructed surface. They also display exceptionally high mechanical strength, high thermal/electrical conductivity, medium to high specific surface areas, and excellent performance for adsorption and spillover of hydrogen, which render this kind of nanostructured carbon materials full of promise as a novel catalyst promoter. The catalytic studies conducted so far on carbon nanotube-based systems range from selective hydrogenation [5,6], hydrofomylation of alkenes [7], selective dehydrogenation [8], selective oxidation [9], ammonia synthesis [10], Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [11], to methanol synthesis [12,13] and higher alcohol synthesis (simplified as HAS in later text) [14–17], etc. They have shown promising results in terms of activity and selectivity. The higher alcohols (C2+-alcohols) and dimethyl ether (DME) have been considered as the most important species among coal-based clean synthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks. These C2+-oxygenates have been confirmed to be a better and cleaner automobile fuel with high octane number, and lower emissions of NO x , ozone, CO, and aromatic vapors [18]. Recently, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as additive of oil-based fuel has been prohibited to be used in some countries or regions due to the new environmental regulation, which has greatly renewed the interest in hydrogenation of syngas to the C2+-oxygenates as gasoline blends. HAS on the Cu-modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts based on Co, Fe, or Ni has been extensively studied since the late 1970s. A number of pioneer work and excellent reviews [19–24] have been published on this subject. Progress in this field has considerably contributed to the growing understanding of the nature of these catalytic reaction systems. Nevertheless, the existing technology of HAS is still on a small scale. The single-pass-conversion of the feed-syngas and selectivity to C2+-alcohols are both relatively low. Under the typical reaction conditions, most systems produce methanol (e.g., over alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts) or hydrocarbons (e.g., over modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts) as the main product instead of C2+-alcohols [23–27]. Development of catalyst with high efficiency and selectivity for HAS has been one of the key objectives for R&D efforts. Recently, with a kind of home-made CNTs as the promoter, a CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalyst for HAS from syngas has been developed in our lab. We had previously reported the preliminary results on development of this catalyst [14,15]. In this article, preparation of the CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalysts and their catalytic performance for HAS from syngas were reported in detail. By means of a series of physico-chemical methods, the texture, structure and properties of the catalysts were characterized, and the nature of promoter action by this kind of CNTs was discussed. The results shed some light on the understanding of the mechanism of promoter action by the CNT-additive and on the design of catalyst for the HAS."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of CNTs and CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of CNTs and CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalysts The used CNTs were synthesized according to the previously reported method [28] by catalytic decomposition of CH4 or CO on a Ni–Mg–O catalyst. The produced CH4-derived and CO-derived CNTs were a kind of “herringbone-type” CNTs (symbolized as CNTs(h-type) or simplified as CNTs in later text) and a kind of “parallel-type” CNTs (symbolized as CNTs(p-type) in later text), respectively [29,30]. The freshly prepared CNTs were twice treated with boiling concentrated nitric acid for 4h, followed by rinsing with de-ionized water, and then drying at 473K under dried nitrogen. Open-end CNTs with hydrophilic surface were thus obtained. Using the above home-made CNTs and the nitrates of the corresponding metallic components, a series of CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalysts, denoted as Co i Cu j –x%CNT (where x% represented mass percentage), were prepared by constant-pH co-precipitation method. An aqueous solution containing calculated amounts of Co and Cu (total equivalent concentration of metallic cations at 4N), which was prepared by dissolving Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (all of AR grade) in deionized water, and an aqueous K2CO3 solution (4N) were simultaneously added drop-wise under vigorous stirring into a Pyrex flask containing a calculated amount of the HNO3-treated CNTs at constant temperature of 353K. The addition was adjusted to maintain a constant pH of around 7. The precipitation process was completed in 1h. The precipitate was then continuously stirred for 5h under the temperature of 353K, followed by aging overnight at room temperature and then filtering. It was then rinsed several times with deionized water until the content of K+ ions in the eluant fell below 1ppm, as detected by flame ion absorption method. The precipitate was then dried at 393K for 4h and calcined at 543–573K for 3h to yield the precursor of CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalysts. A CNTs(p-type)-promoted Co–Cu catalyst and an AC (activated carbon)-doped Co–Cu catalyst, as well as a CNT-free conventional co-precipitated Co–Cu catalyst, all used as references, were prepared in the similar way. All samples of catalyst precursor were pressed, crushed, and sieved to a size of 40–80 mesh for the activity evaluation."
3,Catalyst evaluation,"2.2 Catalyst evaluation Performance of the catalysts for the HAS from syngas was evaluated in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor and gas chromatograph (GC) combination system. 0.50g of catalyst (equivalent to approximately 0.5ml of catalyst sample) was used for each test. Prior to the reaction, the sample of the oxide-precursor of catalyst was pre-reduced in situ by a N2-carried 5%H2 gaseous mixture for 16h. HAS from syngas was conducted at a stationary state with pre-mixed feed-gas composition of V(H2)/V(CO)/V(CO2)/V(N2)=60/30/5/5 or 45/45/5/5 or V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2)=45/45/10 under 5.0MPa, 523–583K. Exit gas from the reactor was immediately brought down to atmospheric pressure and transported, while maintaining temperature at 403K, to the sampling valve of GC (Model GC-950 by Shanghai Haixin GC Instruments, Inc.), which was equipped with dual detectors (TCD and FID) and dual columns filled with carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) and Porapak Q-S (USA), respectively, for on-line analysis. The former column (2.0m length) was used for the analysis of N2 (as an internal standard), CO and CO2, and the latter (2.0m length) for hydrocarbons, alcohols and other oxygenates (mainly DME and acetaldehyde in a small amount). CO conversion (simplified as X(CO)) was determined through the internal standard (N2), and the carbon-based selectivity for the carbon-containing products, including alcohols, hydrocarbons, and other oxygenates (simplified as S(alc.), S(HC), etc. in later text) was calculated by an internal normalization method."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) imagings were performed on LEO-1530 (LEO, Germany) and Technai F30 (Philips, The Netherlands) electron microscopes, respectively. X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Rigaku Rotaflex D/Max-C X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 8°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe machine (PHI, USA) with Al Kα radiation (15kV, 25W, hν =1486.6eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (10−7 Pa), calibrated internally by carbon deposit C(1s) (E b =284.6eV). Specific surface area (SSA) of the CNTs and catalyst samples was determined by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics Tristar-3000 (Carlo Erba) system. Tests of H2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of catalyst were conducted on a combined fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor and adsorption–desorption system. The rate of temperature increase was 10K/min. Change of hydrogen-signal was monitored using an on-line GC (Shimadzu GC-8A) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 100mg of catalyst sample was used for each run. Prior to the TPD measurement, the catalyst sample was pre-reduced in situ in the TPD equipment by the N2-carried 5%H2 gaseous mixture stream (40ml/min), with the highest reduction-temperature reaching 573K and lasting for 16h. The reduced sample was cooled to 433K, followed by switching to a H2 (of 99.999% purity) stream and maintaining at 433K for 30min. After further cooling down to room temperature for 2h, the sample was flushed by the Ar stream at room temperature till the stable baseline of GC appeared. Subsequently, TPD measurement was conducted from 293K to 823K. (H2–CO–CO2)-temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) tests were conducted in a manner similar to that of the H2-TPD."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Optimization of catalyst composition,"3.1 Optimization of catalyst composition The reaction activity of HAS over a series of Co3Cu1–x%CNT catalysts with the same Co/Cu molar ratio of 3:1 and varying CNT content was investigated, and the results were shown in Fig. 1 . The observed carbon-containing products included C1–8-alcohols, C1–4-hydrocarbons, DME and acetaldehyde (in a small amount), as well as CO2 (yielded from the water–gas-shift (WGS) side-reaction). The catalyst with 11% of CNT-content showed the highest catalytic activity. The yield of C2+-alc. plus DME (i.e., the product of X(CO) and S(C2+-alc.+DME), simplified as Y(C2+-alc.+DME) in later text) reached 27.5% over this catalyst, while this value of the other four catalysts was successively 24.4%, 23.9%, 21.2%, and 20.1%. On the basis of the optimization of CNT content, the dependence of HAS reactivity upon the Co/Cu molar ratio was investigated on a series of Co i Cu j –11%CNT catalysts with the same CNT content at 11% but varying Co/Cu molar ratio. The results (Fig. 2 ) showed that the catalyst with the Co/Cu molar ratio of 3:1 had the highest catalytic activity. Over the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst, the observed Y(total oxy.), Y(C2–8-alc.+DME), Y(C2–8-alc.), and Y(total HC) reached 29.1%, 27.1%, 22.6%, and 8.1%, respectively, under the aforementioned reaction conditions."
7,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.2 Optimization of reaction conditions Fig. 3 showed the reactivity of HAS over the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst with varying temperatures. With increasing reaction temperature, X(CO) increased monotonously, while Y(C2–8-alc.) approached a plateau, simultaneously accompanied with accelerated increase of Y(total HC) when the temperatures went up to 583K. In order to obtain high yield of alcohols and low consumption of feed-gas, 573K was taken as the optimal operating temperature. It was experimentally found that the presence of a proper amount of CO2 in the feed-gas over the CNT-promoted Co–Cu system was highly beneficial, instead of harmful, toward hydrogenation–conversion of CO and selective formation of the oxygenated products. As shown in Fig. 4 , the syngas doped with 5%CO2 displayed the highest reactivity. Over the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst, addition of 5%CO2 to the feed-gas led to an increase by 40% in CO-conversion (38.5% vs. 27.1%) under the reaction conditions of 5.0MPa and 573K, accompanied with a marked improvement in S(total oxy.) and S(C2–8-alc.) (74.3% vs. 62.5% and 57.9% vs. 47.5%, respectively) and a certain decrease in S(total HC) (20.7% vs. 30.0%). Effect of H2/CO molar ratio of the feed-syngas on the reactivity and selectivity of HAS was investigated. The result (see Table 1 ) showed that over Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst, the observed single-pass STY of C2–8-alc. plus DME reached 760mg/(h·g) when fed with the feed-syngas of H2/CO=1 (molar ratio) (i.e., V(H2)/V(CO)/V(CO2)/V(N2)=45/45/5/5), while merely 441mg/(h·g) when fed with the feed-syngas of H2/CO=2 (molar ratio) (i.e., V(H2)/V(CO)/V(CO2)/V(N2)=60/30/5/5). It appears that properly low H2/CO molar ratio in the feed-syngas is favorable to formation of C2–8-oxygenated products."
8,HAS reactivity over the CNT-containing (or free) Co–Cu catalyst,"3.3 HAS reactivity over the CNT-containing (or free) Co–Cu catalyst The results of the comparative assay of HAS reaction activity showed that proper incorporation of a minor amount of CNTs into the Co3Cu1 host catalyst not only markedly increased the catalyst activity for CO conversion, but also dramatically improved its selectivity for formation of higher alcohols. Under the reaction condition of 5.0MPa, 573K, V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2)=45/45/10 and GHSV=7200ml/(h·g) (inlet), the observed X(CO), S(total oxy.) and S(total HC) were 27.1% vs. 13.7%, 62.5% vs. 54.1% and 30.0% vs. 36.4%, for the Co3Cu1–11%CNT vs. the Co3Cu1, respectively; while under the reaction condition of 5.0MPa, 573K, V(H2)/V(CO)/V(CO2)/V(N2)=45/45/5/5 and GHSV=7200ml/(h·g) (inlet), these values were 38.5% vs. 25.3%, 74.3% vs. 64.6% and 20.7% vs. 29.0%, respectively. Fig. 5 showed the product distribution of HAS over these catalysts. Over the Co3Cu1–11%CNT, the observed S(C2–8-alc.+DME) reached 69.3%, which were higher than that (58.7%) of the CNT-free counterpart. The products were the mixtures consisting of linear primary alcohols, hydrocarbons and DME, but the carbon-number distribution of the alcohols and hydrocarbons did not follow the classical Anderson–Schulz–Flory rule. BuOH and DME were the two oxygenate products with the highest carbon-based selectivity, 18.4% and 11.4%, respectively, over the CNT-promoted Co3Cu1 catalyst. In comparison, the corresponding numbers were 12.5% and 8.5%, respectively, over the CNT-free counterpart under the same reaction condition. Fig. 6 showed the operation stability of the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst for HAS continuing up to 275h. After 24h of “running in” stage of the reaction, the catalyst reached a stable operating state, with CO conversion of ∼40.0% and selectivity of ∼74.7% and ∼57.4% for the total oxygenates and C2–8-alcohols, without obvious deactivation observed after 275h of the reaction. The single-pass space-time-yields (STYs) of the HAS over the CNT-promoted Co3Cu1 catalyst and the related systems were listed in Table 1. Under the reaction condition of 5.0MPa, 573K, H2/CO/CO2/N2 =45/45/5/5 (v/v) and GHSV=7200ml/(h·g) (inlet), STY of the C2–8-alc. plus DME reached 760mg/(g·h), being ∼78% higher than that (428mg/(g·h)) of the CNT-free host. The mass% of C2–8-alcohols and DME combined reached ∼90% in the total oxygenated products, showing great potential in commercial use for the HAS. Fig. 7 showed the results of the measurement of apparent activation energy (E a) of the HAS. The E a taken on the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst was 10.7kcal/mol (with CO2-containing feed-gas) or 13.6kcal/mol (with CO2-free feed-gas). These values were fairly close to 12.2kcal/mol taken on the CNT-free host Co3Cu1 (with CO2-containing feed-gas). This indicated that proper incorporation of a minor amount of the CNTs into the Co3Cu1 host catalyst did not cause a marked change in the E a for the HAS reaction, most likely implying that the addition of a minor amount of the CNTs to the Co3Cu1 did not alter the reaction pathway of rate-determining step of the CO hydrogenation reaction."
9,Post-analysis of the tested catalysts by XRD and XPS,"3.4 Post-analysis of the tested catalysts by XRD and XPS The XRD post-analysis of the tested catalysts showed that the XRD pattern of the CNT-containing system were very close to that of the CNT-free host in the position and shape of their XRD features, except the peak at 2θ =26.1°, which was due to diffraction of graphite-like (002) face of the CNTs [29,30] (see Fig. 8(a) and (b)). This indicated that the addition of a minor amount of the CNTs to the Co3Cu1 did not cause a marked change in the phase compositions associated with Co and Cu components. In both catalysts, the Co and Cu components existed mainly in the forms of CoCu-alloy (2θ =44.0°) and divided copper metal (2θ =51.1° and 75.5°), while the content of divided cobalt metal (2θ =41.5° and 47.5° for hcp-Co x ) was extremely low. According to Scherrer's equation, it could be estimated that the mean particle diameter of CoCu-alloy and copper metal was ∼8.4nm and ∼6.2nm in the CNT-containing catalyst, which were smaller than those (∼11.0nm and ∼8.2nm, respectively) of the CNT-free counterpart, meaning that the CNT-containing catalyst had larger metal surface area. Fig. 8(c)–(f) showed the XRD patterns of the calcined precursors of four catalysts. The observed main crystallite phase was Co3O4 and CuO for the Co–11%CNT (Fig. 8(f)) and Co1Cu5–11%CNT (Fig. 8(c)), respectively, while were CuCo2O4 for Co2Cu1–11%CNT (Fig. 8(d)) and Co3Cu1–11%CNT (Fig. 8(e)) both. In association with the fact that the latter two catalysts had much higher catalytic activity for HAS, compared to the former two catalysts (see Fig. 2), it could be inferred that it was such a kind of CuCo2O4 spinel crystallites that would be responsible for generating, through H2-reduction, the solid–solution-type bimetal Co i Cu j sites catalytically active for HAS. Fig. 9(A) showed Cu(2p)-XPS spectra of the tested Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst and the CNT-free counterpart. Little difference in valence of the surface Cu-species existed between the two catalysts. The observed surface Cu-species were all in Cu0, with Cu0(2p 3/2)=932.6eV (B.E.) and Cu0(2p 1/2)=952.6eV (B.E.), indicating that all of the Cu-species at the surface of functioning catalysts existed in the form of metal copper, Cu0, being in line with the results reported by Sheffer et al. [31]. Unlike the Cu(2p)-XPS spectra, remarkable difference in the Co(2p)-XPS spectra (Fig. 9(B)) existed between the two tested catalysts. On the CNT-free catalyst (Co3Cu1), relatively large amounts of the surface Co-species was in Co0 [Co(2p 3/2)=778.0eV (B.E.)] and minor in CoO [Co(2p 3/2)=780.4eV (B.E.)] when fed with the CO2-free feed-gas (Fig. 9(B), b(2)), while dominant amount in CoO and a little in Co0 when fed with the CO2-containing feed-gas (Fig. 9(B), b(1)). On the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst, in addition to Co0 and CoO, a type of new Co-species with the Co(2p 3/2) at around 780.0eV (B.E.) was observed when fed with the CO2-free feed-gas (Fig. 9 (B), a(2)). This type of Co-species may be ascribed to CoO(OH) [32]. It was particularly interesting that the Co0 nearly vanished, while the CoO(OH) became the predominant Co-species at the surface of the CNT-containing catalyst fed with the CO2-containing feed-gas (Fig. 9 (B), a(1)). Analysis and fitting of these Co(2p)-XPS spectra were carried out and the results (see Table 2 ) showed that at the surface of the CNT-containing catalyst fed with the CO2-containing feed-gas, most of the Co-species was CoO(OH), rather than CoO or metallic Co0. Therefore, it could be suggested that such a kind of surface CoO(OH) species was closely related to the high selectivity of the HAS. It appeared that CO2 additive in the feed-gas together with the CNT promoter may synergistically play important roles in stabilizing the surface Co-species in the form of CoO(OH), thus increasing the probability of chain termination to form oxygenated products."
10,Textural and physico-chemical properties of the CNTs,"3.5 Textural and physico-chemical properties of the CNTs It was evident that the considerably better performance of the CNT-promoted Co–Cu catalyst for HAS from syngas was closely related to the unique structures and properties of the CNTs used as promoter. The previous HRTEM observation and XRD and Raman measurements have demonstrated that the two kinds of CNTs home-made by catalytic decomposition of CO and CH4 on a Ni–Mg–O catalyst were a kind of CNTs(p-type) and a kind of CNTs(h-type), respectively [28–30]. The former is composed of many concentric cylindrical graphene layers placed around a common central hollow. Their surface C-atoms were those located in the facets of the graphene layer, having a higher degree of valence-bond saturation, and thus, fewer dangling bond electrons, resulting in their weak adsorbability towards H2. Rather different from the former, the latter is constructed by the superposition of many graphene layer facets tilted at a certain angle with respect to the axis of central hollow nanofibre, as if a number of cones were placed one on another. Their surface C-atoms are those at edge of conical graphite-like facets, which are rich in dangling bond electrons. Their degree of valence-bond saturation is relatively low, thus apt to be further saturated by adsorbing some atom, small molecule or group, such as H-atom(s) or -molecule [3]. Fig. 10 showed SEM and HRTEM images of the CH4-derived CNTs(h-type). Their outer diameters were in the range of 10–50nm and the inner diameters in 3–7nm, with the N2-BET specific surface area (SSA) at ∼135m2/g. The element analysis showed that carbon content in the purified CNTs was ≥99%. The test of temperature-programmed hydrogenation (H2-TPH, with H2 of 99.999% purity as reductant) [3,14] showed that the carbon nanostructures in the purified CNTs were predominantly graphite-like (with the TPH peak at around 953K), and the content of amorphous carbon (with the TPH peak at around 613K) was very low (less than 10% estimated), and that the temperature needed for initiating the hydrogenation reaction of the CNTs with H2 was ≥773K, indicating that this kind of CNTs was stable in H2-atmosphere at the reaction temperatures for the HAS. Fig. 11 showed TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) profiles for H2 adsorbed on the two kinds of CNTs, CNTs(h-type) and CNTs(p-type) (with the outer diameters of 10–40nm and the inner diameters of 3–5nm and the N2-BET-SSA of ∼200m2/g), respectively. By combined analysis by GC and MS, it was evidenced that the desorbed product was almost exclusively gaseous hydrogen at temperatures lower than ∼693K. At temperatures higher than ∼693K, the product contained CH4, C2H4 and C2H2, in addition to a considerable amount of H2. This experimental result revealed that H2 adsorption on these types of CNTs may be in two forms: associative (molecular state) and dissociative (atomic state). Moreover, it was evident that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs(h-type) was considerably higher than that of the the CNTs(p-type). These were in good agreement with the aforementioned results of Raman characterization of the H2/CNTs adsorption systems [30,33]."
11,TPD/TPSR characterization of the pre-reduced catalysts,"3.6 TPD/TPSR characterization of the pre-reduced catalysts H2-TPD measurements also provided useful information about hydrogen ad-species and their relative concentrations at the surface of catalysts. The solid lines in Fig. 12 showed the TPD profiles taken on the pre-reduced catalysts adsorbing H2 (99.999% purity) at 433K followed by cooling down to room temperature. On the CNT-free catalyst, Co3Cu1, desorption of H-adspecies started at 333K, approached a peak at 410K, and ended at 523K; while on the Co3Cu1–11%CNT(h-type) catalyst, a shoulder-peak (region-II) spanning from 473K to 623K, which resulted from the desorption of H-species chemisorbed strongly, was observed, in addition to a main peak (region-I) at 418K due to desorption of weakly adsorbed H-species. It could be estimated that total area-intensity of the TPD-profile (corresponding to a certain H2-desorbed amount) taken on the CNT(h-type)-containing system in the range of 333–623K was 2.5 times that of the CNT-free system. It was conceivable that, at the reaction temperatures for HAS (523–583K for the present work), the surface concentration of the kind of H-adspecies interrelated with region-I (spanning from 333K to 473K) was expected to be extremely low, and most of H-adspecies at the surface of functioning catalysts was those interrelated to region-II (spanning from 473K to 623K). Therefore, it could be inferred that the kind of H-adspecies interrelated with region-II was closely associated with the reaction activity of HAS. The relative area-intensity ratio of the region-II for the two catalysts was estimated to be: (Co3Cu1–11%CNT):(Co3Cu1)=5.6:1. This suggested that the sequence of increasing surface concentration of H-adspecies on the functioning catalysts was (Co3Cu1–11%CNT)>(Co3Cu1), in line with the observed sequence of reaction activity of HAS over these catalysts. Using the feed-gas of V(H2)/V(CO)/V(CO2)=45/45/5 in place of H2 as adsorbate in the above experiments, the observed TPD–TPSR (temperature-programmed surface reaction) profiles were shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 12. On the Co3Cu1–11%CNT sample pre-adsorbing the feed-gas of H2/CO/CO2, a main peak at 541K and two shoulder-peaks at 590K and 653K were observed. The desorbed product was mainly H2 and CO at temperatures below 523K, and contained C1–8-oxygenates and C1–4-hydrocarbons in addition to H2 and CO at temperatures of 523K and above. With temperature increasing and the surface reaction accelerating, most of adspecies of H2, CO and CO2 remaining at the surface may be converted to the products of HAS, followed by the latter's desorption, so that the whole process of TPD–TPSR came to an end with temperature running up to ∼693K. Similar TPD–TPSR behavior was also observed on the CNT-free counterpart, but its adsorption capacity for the feed-syngas of H2/CO/CO2 was relatively low. The observed sequence of adsorption capacity of the two catalysts toward the feed-gas of H2/CO/CO2 was Co3Cu1–11%CNT>Co3Cu1, again in line with the observed sequence of reaction activity of HAS over these catalysts."
12,Nature of the CNT-promoter action,"3.7 Nature of the CNT-promoter action The aforementioned results of the catalyst evaluation showed that appropriate incorporation of a minor amount of the CNTs into the Co3Cu1 host catalyst led to a significant increase in CO conversion and selectivity for the higher alcohols. Yet the result of measurement of apparent activation energy (E a) indicated that the addition of a minor amount of the CNTs into the Co3Cu1 host catalyst did not cause a marked change in the E a for the HAS, most likely implying that the addition of a minor amount of the CNTs to the Co3Cu1 did not alter the reaction pathway of rate-determining step of the CO hydrogenation reaction. The measurements of the amount of CO adsorbed on the H2-reduced catalyst samples could provide the valuable information about active metal surface area. Unfortunately, since metallic Co and Cu both can adsorb CO in varying degrees and they may have different CO-site occupation sequence and adsorption model [34,35], it is impossible to calculate a definite active metal surface area from the amount of CO adsorbed on these CoCu-based catalysts. Still, the relative ratio of the active metal surface areas of different catalyst samples could be estimated. Such experiments have been done, and the results showed that under the condition of 298K and 0.1MPa, the amount of CO chemisorbed on the H2-reduced Co3Cu1–11%CNT sample was 1.21 times that of the H2-reduced Co3Cu1 host. This suggested that the active metal surface area of the Co3Cu1–11%CNT catalyst was about 1.21 times that of the CNT-free Co3Cu1. The increase of the N2-BET-SSA (120.2 (calcined) and 68.8 (tested)m2/g for the Co3Cu1–11%CNT; 108.2 (calcined) and 53.3 (tested)m2/g for the Co3Cu1), especially the active metal surface area, was undoubtedly in favor of enhancing the specific activity of the catalyst (i.e., activity of unit mass of catalyst). Nevertheless, it would be difficult to believe that the increase of as high as 50% in CO conversion (i.e., 38.5% vs. 25.3% for the Co3Cu1–11%CNT vs. the Co3Cu1, see Table 1) was solely attributed to the difference in their SSA or active metal surface area. In recent years there has been considerable experimental and theoretical interest in the use of nanostructured carbon materials as potential hydrogen sorbents. It was demonstrated by Ishikawa et al. [36] that graphitized carbon black surfaces were capable of rapidly equilibrating H2/D2 mixture. A dissociation rate of 2.5×1017 moleculess−1 (m2-ASA)−1 (ASA—active surface area) was measured at ambient temperatures and pressures, regardless of the nature of the carbon material under investigation. The ASA was described in terms of atoms located at edge positions on the graphite basal plane and was determined from the amount of oxygen able to chemisorb at these sites. It appears that the high reactivity of HAS over the CNT(h-type)-promoted Co3Cu1 catalyst was closely related to the peculiar properties of this kind of CNTs, especially their excellent performance for adsorption/activation of H2. Based upon the above TPD results, it could be suggested that, under the reaction conditions of the HAS, there existed a considerably larger amount of reversibly adsorbed H-species on the CNT(h-type)-promoted Co3Cu1 catalyst, which would generate a surface micro-environment with high stationary-state concentration of H-adspecies on the catalyst. Those active H-adspecies could be readily transferred to Co i Cu j active sites via the CNT-promoted hydrogen spillover, thus increase the rate of a series of surface hydrogenation reactions in the HAS. This was very similar to the cases of methanol synthesis over the CNT-supported/promoted Cu–Zn–Al catalysts [12,13] and HAS over the Co-decorated CNT-promoted Co–Mo–K catalyst [17]. Alternatively, synergistic action of the high surface-concentration H-adspecies with CO2 in the feed-gas led to a significant increase of the surface concentration of the CoO(OH)-species (a kind of catalytically active Co-species closely associated with the alcohols generation) on one hand, and a greater inhibition for the water–gas-shift side-reaction on the other hand. All these factors contributed considerably to an increase in the yield of alcohols. Compared to the CNTs(h-type), the CNTs(p-type)’s capacity for adsorption and activation of H2 was much lower, and thus, its promoter action was not marked. In sharp contrast to the CNTs(h-type)-doped catalyst, doping of the AC (activated carbon, a kind of amorphous carbon, Xiamen Chem. Reagent Co., with 830m2/g of N2-BET-SSA) into the Co3Cu1 host catalyst not only was unhelpful to improving the performance of the catalyst, but also led to a certain decrease in conversion of CO and STY of (C1–8-alc.+DME) (see Table 1)."
13,Conclusion,"The present work showed that CNTs(h-type) could serve as an excellent catalyst-promoter for CO/CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The CNT(h-type)-promoted Co3Cu1 catalyst achieved highly selective formation of C2–8-oxygenates, especially BuOH and DME, from syngas, and demonstrated great potential in commercial use for the HAS. The results also shed some light on the understanding of the promoter action by the CNT additive and on the design of catalyst for the HAS. For better understanding of mechanism of the promoter action by the CNTs, further studies, especially in situ characterization of reaction intermediates under the HAS reaction condition, would be desirable."
