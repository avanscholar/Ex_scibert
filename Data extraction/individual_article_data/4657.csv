0,Introduction,"At present, about 80% of global energy demand comes from fossil fuels and natural gas [1]. Combustion of fossil fuels brings about severe pollution and contributes to the greenhouse effect. To reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, H 2 is considered to be an ideal energy alternative in the future. Compared with chemical H 2 generation process, biological H 2 production using fermentative, photosynthetic bacteria, or algae is an environmentally friendly and energy saving process [1,2]. Furthermore, organic wastes can be used as substrates for biological H 2 production facilitating both waste treatment and energy recovery. The feasibility of fermentative H 2 production from organic wastes or wastewaters has been widely demonstrated by various laboratories [3–8]. The fermentative H 2 -producing process is greatly influenced by many factors, such as pH, temperature, oxidation–reduction potential and nutritional requirements [1,4,9]. For example, Oh et al. [9] found that methanogenesis could be prevented by heat treatment of seed sludge and that the maximum H 2 production occurred over a pH range of 5.5–6.0. Nutritional requirements on H 2 production have also been demonstrated by Lin and Lay [10]. Temperature is one of the important factors influencing the biological H 2 fermentation process. Substrate degradation, H 2 production, product distribution and bacterial growth are all affected by temperature. Furthermore, the microbial community in a fermentative H 2 -producing reactor is also greatly influenced by temperature [11,12]. Previous studies on fermentative H 2 production were operated in a mesophilic range, i.e., 30– 37 ∘ C [2,3,5–8], whereas some experiments were conducted in a thermophilic range, i.e., 50– 60 ∘ C [4,6], or even at ambient temperatures [13]. H 2 production and substrate degradation rate can be increased through elevating operating temperature. However, operation at high temperatures is not favorable for energy recovery. Therefore, for a balance between H 2 production and energy recovery, it seems to be reasonable to operate biological H 2 -producing reactors in the mesophilic range. Therefore, this study was conducted in the mesophilic range (e.g., 33– 41 ∘ C ) to investigate the performance of anaerobic H 2 -producing process at various temperatures in terms of substrate degradation, H 2 production, product distribution and cell growth. In addition, thermodynamic studies on H 2 production and cell growth were also performed. Glucose was used as the sole substrate, whereas heat-treated anaerobic sludge was employed as the seed sludge. To our knowledge, thermodynamic studies of biological H 2 production by mixed cultures are limited in the literature."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed microflora,"2.1 Seed microflora The anaerobic microflora used in this study was heat-treated anaerobic sludge, which originally came from a local municipal sewage treatment plant and was anaerobically stored at room temperatures for six months. Prior to use, the sludge was sieved to remove stone, sand and other coarse material. Thereafter, the sludge was heated at 85 ∘ C for 1h to inactivate hydrogentrophic methanogens and to enrich for H 2 -producing bacteria [9]."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure Hydrogen production experiments were conducted in a 5-l fermentor (Baoxin Biotech Ltd., Shanghai). Seed sludge of 150ml and a certain volume of nutrients solution were added to the fermentor and the working volume was adjusted to 2.0 l with distilled water. The solution in the fermentor was composed as follows (unit in mg/l): glucose 10000; NH 4 Cl 500; KH 2 PO 4 250; K 2 HPO 4 250; FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 15; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 125; NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 0.5; CaCl 2 1.0; KCl 20; NH 4 Mo 7 O 24 0.5; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 0.5; MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O 0.5; ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 0.5; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O 0.5. Prior to operation, the fermentor was purged with nitrogen gas for 10min to ensure anaerobic conditions. The pH in the fermentor was kept at 5.5 by feeding NaOH (4M) and HCl (2M) solutions via respective peristaltic pumps. The fermentor was stirred at a constant rate of 150rpm to ensure thorough mixing and to facilitate rapid diffusion of biogas. The fermentor was operated at 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 ∘ C , respectively. The amount of biogas produced was recorded using the water-displacement method. At each temperature the volume and composition of biogas, degradation of glucose and production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) were monitored. Moreover, experiment was replicated at least three times for each temperature and results were averaged."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The composition of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) (Lunan, Model SP-6800A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2m stainless column packed with 5Åmolecular sieve. The temperatures of injector, column and detector were kept at 100, 50 and 105 ∘ C , respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of VFA, acetone and alcohols in the liquor were determined by a second GC (Agilent, Model 6890NT) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μ m fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP). The VFA and alcohols analyzed included; acetate, propionate, butyrate, i-butyrate, valerate, caproate, ethanol and propanol. The liquor samples were first centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 5min, and were then acidified by formic acid and filtrated through 0.2 μ m membrane and finally measured for free acids. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 and 300 ∘ C , respectively. The initial temperature of oven was 70 ∘ C for 3min followed with a ramp of 20 ∘ C /min for 5.5min and to final temperature of 180 ∘ C for 3min. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2.6ml/min. Glucose was measured using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method [14], while volatile suspended solids (VSS) was determined according to the Standard Methods [15]. The accumulative volume of H 2 produced over the time course during the batch tests was fitted with the following modified Gompertz equation [16]: (1) H = P exp - exp r m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 , where H is cumulative H 2 production (ml), P is the H 2 production potential (ml), r m is the maximum H 2 production rate (ml/h), λ is the lag-phase time (h) and e equals 2.718. The growth of H 2 -producing bacteria was fitted to Eq. (2), which was modified from Eq. (1) with consideration of initial biomass concentration. Eq. (2) is expressed as follows: (2) X ( t ) = X max exp - exp R x e X max ( λ X - t ) + 1 + X 0 , where X ( t ) is the biomass concentration (g/l), X max is the maximum net cell growth concentration (g/l), X 0 is the initial biomass concentration (g/l), R X is the maximum cell growth rate (g/l/h), λ X is the lag-phase time (h) of biomass growth. The parameters in both Eqs. (1) and (2) were calculated non-linearly using “Microsoft Origin 6.1” by converting the residual sum of squares between the experiment and the estimation to a minimum value."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Glucose degradation,"3.1 Glucose degradation Both the glucose degradation rate and the degradation efficiency during H 2 production increased with increasing temperature (Fig. 1 ). At 33 ∘ C , glucose degradation ceased after 20-h incubation, achieving 97.6 ± 2.6 % of glucose degradation efficiency. However, at 41 ∘ C , the time for complete glucose degradation was shortened to 10h, and the glucose degradation efficiency was slightly increased, to 98.9 ± 2.5 % . With the increase in temperature of 8 ∘ C , the glucose degradation rate almost doubled. These results demonstrate that an increase in temperature was beneficial for glucose degradation."
7,Cumulative H 2 production,"3.2 Cumulative H 2 production With the anaerobic degradation of glucose, H 2 and CO 2 were produced as gaseous products. Fig. 2 illustrates the total gas production, H 2 percentage, and H 2 production over incubation time at each temperature. The total gas production increased with increasing temperature, from 4280 ± 300 ml at 33 ∘ C to 5870 ± 320 ml at 41 ∘ C after 20-h incubation (Fig. 2A). The H 2 percentage over incubation time has the similar trend at each time (Fig. 2B). For example, at 41 ∘ C , H 2 percentage reached a maximum of 57.6 ± 5.0 % at 13h, but it then slightly declined to 53.0 ± 5.0 % at 24h. H 2 production volume also increased with temperature, as indicated in Fig. 2C. At 33 ∘ C , the cumulative H 2 production was 2448 ± 250 ml at 24h. With an increase in temperature to 41 ∘ C , the cumulative H 2 production increased to 4070 ± 350 ml in 24-h incubation. In order to clearly evaluate the effect of temperature on cumulative H 2 production, experimental data in Fig. 2 were fitted to Eq. (1) and Table 1 summarizes the estimated values of the parameters in Eq. (1). As shown in Table 1, as the temperature increased from 33 to 41 ∘ C , the H 2 production potential increased rapidly from 2423 to 4165ml, the H 2 production rate jumped from 301 to 863ml/h. However, the lag phase time was reduced from 11.26 to 5.62h. All correlation coefficients of non-linear analysis by Eq. (1) exceeded 0.99, suggesting that the modified Gompertz model was able to adequately describe the H 2 production from glucose by mixed cultures within the mesophilic range."
8,Specific H 2 production rate and H 2 yield,"3.3 Specific H 2 production rate and H 2 yield The specific H 2 production rate was calculated by dividing the maximum H 2 production rate at exponential growth phase by the biomass concentration (VSS). The H 2 yield was determined by dividing the total volume of H 2 production by the consumed glucose. Table 2 summarizes the specific H 2 production rate and H 2 yield at various temperatures. As shown in Table 2, an increase in temperature from 33 to 39 ∘ C resulted in an increase in specific H 2 production rate from 2112 ± 23 to 3922 ± 45 ml / g - VSS / d . However, at a higher temperature of 41 ∘ C , the specific H 2 production rate was slightly decreased to 3780 ± 39 ml / g - VSS / d . On the other hand, the H 2 yield increased gradually from 0.97 ± 0.04 mol - H 2 / mol - glucose to 1.67 ± 0.04 mol - H 2 / mol -glucose as the temperature increased from 33 to 41 ∘ C . This implies that, in mesophilic range, a proper increase in temperature was beneficial for H 2 yield of a fermentative H 2 -producing reactor."
9,Cell growth,"3.4 Cell growth The growth of H 2 -producing bacteria was closely associated with glucose degradation, and was also influenced greatly by temperature. Eq. (2) was employed to fit the growth of biomass at various temperatures, and Table 3 summarizes the estimated values of the parameters in Eq. (2). As listed in Table 3, with an increase in temperature from 33 to 41 ∘ C , the net cell growth concentration increased from 0.70 to 1.14 g / l . On the other hand, the cell growth rate increased markedly from 0.062 to 0.614 g / l / h , while the lag phase time decreased from 10.6 to 6.3h. This implies that an increase in temperature in the mesophilic range could enhance the growth rate of H 2 -producing cultures. The high values of regression coefficient in Table 3 indicate that the modified model was able to properly describe the growth of H 2 -producing cultures."
10,Distribution of aqueous products,"3.5 Distribution of aqueous products In the acidogenic fermentation of glucose, VFA and alcohols were simultaneously produced as main aqueous products. Table 4 summarizes the distribution of VFA at various temperatures. According to Table 4, acetate and ethanol were the main aqueous products at lower temperatures such as 33 ∘ C . However, acetate and butyrate became predominate at higher temperatures such as 41 ∘ C . By contrast, propionate, caproate and acetone were present, but in relatively low quantities in all the cases. With an increase in temperature from 33 to 37 ∘ C , the percentage of acetate increased substantially from 33.1 ± 1.2 % to 60.0 ± 0.8 % . At 41 ∘ C , it decreased sharply to 39.9 ± 1.3 % . The corresponding butyrate percentage increased from 5.4 ± 1.0 % to 35.0 ± 1.1 % with an increase in temperature from 33 to 41 ∘ C . On the other hand, the changes in the percentages of ethanol and propionate had an opposite pattern. The percentages of acetone and caproate did not change significantly with temperature, except that caproate was not detected at 33 ∘ C . The total VFA also increased with increasing temperature. The above results demonstrate that the distribution of final aqueous products was influenced by temperature."
11,Thermodynamic analysis,"3.6 Thermodynamic analysis The thermodynamic analysis of biological H 2 production by mixed culture is very limited in the literature. The relationship between microbial growth rate and substrate concentration in H 2 production process can be expressed simply as follows: (3) r x = kS n , where r x is the microbial growth rate (g/l/h), S is substrate concentration (g/l) and k is constant. According to Arrhennius equation, the relationship between constant (k) and temperature is as follows: (4) k = A e - E a / RT , where E a is activation energy (kJ/mol), A is the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314J/mol/K) and T is the absolute temperature (K). From Eqs. (3) and (4), the following equation can be obtained: (5) ln r x = ln A + n ln S - E a R 1 T . In a similar way, a relationship between H 2 production and temperature can be established as (6) ln r H 2 = ln A + n ln S - E a R 1 T . In Eq. (6), r H 2 is H 2 production rate. From Eqs. (5) and (6), the activation energy can be estimated by using regression. The high regression coefficients shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the Arrhennius equation could adequately describe the relationships between temperature and H 2 production, microbial growth rate. Moreover, the activation energy for H 2 production and microbial growth was estimated as 107.66 and 204.77kJ/mol, respectively."
12,Conclusions,"The results of this work demonstrated that glucose degradation, H 2 production, and bacterial growth were influenced by the variation of temperature between 33 and 41 ∘ C . Glucose degradation rate and efficiency, H 2 yield, and growth rate of H 2 -producing bacteria all increased as the temperature increased from 33 to 41 ∘ C . The specific H 2 production rate increased with increasing temperature from 33 to 39 ∘ C , then decreased as the temperature was further increased to 41 ∘ C . The distribution of VFA was also greatly affected by temperature. A modified Gompertz model was able to adequately describe the H 2 production and microbial growth in the mesophilic range. The activation energies for H 2 production and microbial growth were estimated as 107.66 and 204.77kJ/mol, respectively."
