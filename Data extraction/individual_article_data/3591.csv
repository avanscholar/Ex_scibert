0,Introduction,"Being independent of weather conditions, ability to incorporate wide range of facultative and anaerobic bacteria along with simpler reactor design and less energy requirement, made dark fermentation an effective mean of biohydrogen generation [1]. Laboratory scale dark fermentation experiments are struggling to get upgraded to industrial applications due to low rates and yields of hydrogen formation compared to the conventional hydrogen producing methods [2]. Many researches are oriented towards intensifying the production through supplementing various additives including nanoparticles [3]. Zero valent iron (ZVI), a popular nanoparticle used as a catalyst in dark fermentation, is known for transformation of halogenated organic contaminants and heavy metals as well as eliminating pollutant hosts. Highly reactive characteristics are the primitive reasons behind the applications which will be elevated at nanoscales due to increase in specific surface area [1,4,5]. Optimum ZVI concentrations and operating conditions were already identified for different substrates, biomass and microorganisms through numerous studies. However, limited particle life and particle agglomeration are identified as key challenges. Thus, different geometries and structures of nano ZVI, as well as different coating and support materials should be incorporated. One of the most common support material for ZVI nanoparticles used in ground water remediation is chitosan. It has proven to improve the properties of ZVI as a reducing agent which justifies the applicability in dark fermentation. Hence, this study evaluated the use of chitosan supported ZVI nanoparticles as a catalyst to improve biohydrogen production via dark fermentation. Catalyst performance in different initial pH levels were analyzed while dark fermentation was carried out by Enterobacter aerogenes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and reagents,"2.1 Inoculum and reagents A complex medium was prepared on the composition of (g/L): glucose as carbon source 20, yeast extract 5, peptone 5, K2HPO4 7, KH2PO4 5.5, (NH4)2SO4 1, MgSO4 ⋅ 7H2O 0.25, CaCl2 ⋅ 2H2O 0.021, Fe(NH4)2SO4 ⋅ 6H2O 0.039, NiCl2 0.00002, and 10 mL of trace element solution containing 0.5 g MnC12 ⋅ 4H2O, 0.1 g H3BO3, 0.01 g AlK(SO4)2 ⋅ H2O, 0.001 g CuCl2 ⋅ 2H2O, and 0.5 g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na2EDTA) per liter [6]. A culture medium was prepared by mixing of 5 g/L peptone with 3 g/L beef extract [7]. After inoculation of 1 mL of E. aerogenes seed culture (0.5 McFarland) into serum bottles (100 mL serum bottles containing 50 mL of culture medium), the bottles were incubated for 12 h at 30 °C without shaking. After 12 h, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was decanted. The remaining cells were suspended in 10 mL of 0.1 mM phosphate buffer and used as the inoculum. All the chemicals used were in analytical grade."
3,Nano zero valent iron/chitosan (nZVI/CS) composite preparation,"2.2 Nano zero valent iron/chitosan (nZVI/CS) composite preparation Chitosan (Sigma Aldrich©, lower molecular weight) was dissolved in 40 mL of 0.05 M nitric acid to obtain 7.5 g/L concentration. The mixture was then stirred for 30 min at 40 ºC. A total volume of 15 mL of 33 g/L FeCl2 was added to the mixture followed by 40 mL of 20 g/L NaBH4 (Loba Chemie©) under N2 gas protection. Both FeCl2 and NaBH4 solutions were added drop wise. The acquired mixture was stirred until Fe2＋ is fully reduced. The obtained gray sediment was gathered and then washed with ethyl alcohol for at least three times, and then dried at 50 ºC under vacuum for 24 h [8]."
4,Morphological analysis,"2.3 Morphological analysis The morphological arrangement of nZVI/CS was determined using transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the Center of Scientific Equipment for Advanced Research, Thammasat University."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure A working volume of 50 mL was produced in 100 mL serum bottles with 10 mL inoculum and 40 mL nutrient solution. The catalysts were added to the concentrations of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 600 mg/L. Control samples were provided without nZVI/CS. Initial pH was adjusted in each batch for 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.8 and 7.0. Prior to the incubation, the bottles were flushed with pure nitrogen for 3 min to provide an oxygen free content and sealed. The bottles were placed inside a shaking incubator at 37 °C and 150 rpm [3,9,10]."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods After 24 h of fermentation a 50 μ L gas sample was drawn from each serum bottle to determine biogas composition and hydrogen content using gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer, USA) fitted with Porapak Q column. Total gas volume was measured using 50 mL syringes along with the final pH. Fermentation mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was filtered through a 0. 2 μ m syringe filter and preserved for further analysis. Soluble Fe concentration was measured using atomic adsorption spectrophotometer (AAS) (Perkin Elmer, USA). The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) (acetic, propionic, butyric, and lactic acids), ethanol and glucose were determined by a high performance liquid chromatograph (Agilent 1200 infinity series), equipped with VertisepTM OA column, 8 μ m , 7.8 × 300 mm at 35 °C. Sulfuric acid 0.01 N was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Based on the obtained hydrogen volume and glucose concentration hydrogen yield was calculated using Eq. (1). The optimum initial pH was identified based on the hydrogen yield after 24 h and cumulative hydrogen production was measured for the corresponding initial pH level every 2 h for 24 h. (1) Hydrogen yield = Hydroge Hydrogen produced ( mL ) Substrate consumed ( g glucose )"
7,Kinetic model,"2.6 Kinetic model The modified Gompertz’s equation mentioned below as Eq. (2) was used to describe the progress of a batch fermentative hydrogen production process and to establish the relationship among the substrate degradation rate, the hydrogen production growth rate. The cumulative hydrogen production data for optimum initial pH condition was fitted to the model to estimate values of parameters. The equation can be expressed as; (2) H ( t ) = H max ⋅ exp = { − exp [ R m × e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H and H max are the cumulative hydrogen production (mL) and the maximum cumulative hydrogen production (mL). R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); λ , t and e are the lag-phase time (h), cultivation time (h) and Euler’s constant (2.718), respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Morphological arrangement of nZVI/CS,"3.1 Morphological arrangement of nZVI/CS Fig. 1 provides the nanoparticle structure observed through TEM. The synthesis resulted in spherical shaped ZVI nanoparticle which were embedded on chitosan. Rather than agglomerating, the particles were scattered through the chitosan layer (Fig. 1(a)). Spontaneous arrangement of stick structured particles was also identified (Fig. 1c) similar to Zhang et al. [8]. As per the extracted images from TEM, the particle size has been maintained below 100 nm."
10,Hydrogen yield,"3.2 Hydrogen yield According to Fig. 2(a) the initial pH 6.8 provides the highest hydrogen yield after 24 h for all nZVI/CS concentrations. The optimum nZVI/CS concentration was 150 mg/L based on hydrogen yield. Hydrogen yields demonstrated a similar variation for pH 6.8 and pH 5.5 and yet, the obtained yields are about 50% of pH 6.8 condition. Since chitosan dissolves at pH levels below 6.5, there is a potential in amplifying its antimicrobial properties which can be the reason behind the increment of hydrogen yield just above initial pH 6.5 [11]. In both cases, the hydrogen yield declined for nZVI/CS over 200 mg/L possibly due to inhibitive Fe ion concentrations. Nevertheless, 600 mg/L provided a decline in hydrogen yield despite of the initial pH changes confirming a toxic behavior of excess ZVI supplementation that can lead to a decrease in enzymatic activities [10,12,13]."
11,"VFA, ethanol and soluble Fe ion distribution","3.3 VFA, ethanol and soluble Fe ion distribution As indicated in Fig. 2(b) the final VFA, ethanol and total Fe ion distribution in optimum initial pH (pH 6.8) condition. Lactic acid has shown a weak negative linear relationship ( r 2 = −0.43) with hydrogen yield. Both propionic acid and ethanol had resulted in moderate negative linear relationships indicating r 2 values of −0.65 and −0.56, respectively. This confirmed the consumption of hydrogen during the formation of both. Eq. (3) explains how hydrogen is used during propionic acid formation from glucose. Moreover, during the ethanol formation, at least 2 mol of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are released per 1 mol ethanol. The released NAD+ can later can be recycled back to NADH in a reaction competing with hydrogen production [6,14]. A weak positive linear relationship was found with acetic acid formation which confirmed the dark fermentation had occurred via acetic pathway as demonstrated in Eq. (4) [6,14]. It is reasonable to assume the consumption of hydrogen during propionic acid and ethanol formation has adversely affected the correlation between hydrogen yield and acetic acid concentration. Insignificant concentrations of butyric acid distribution conveyed butyric pathway was not the key pathway in producing hydrogen. However, Fe ion distribution resulted in a strong negative linear relationship ( r 2 = −0.88) with lactic acid generation indicating the lactate fermentation of E. aerogenes with ldhA gene [15]. (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Irrespective of nZVI/CS concentration, VFA distribution followed similar trends for each initial pH. Considering the relationship with initial pH, Fe ion showed the strongest negative correlation ( r 2 from −0.71 to −0.92) except for control. Due to the iron corrosion occurring once ZVI is introduced, both Fe2＋ and Fe3＋ are generated. Fe2＋ reduces the partial oxygen presence and motives the functional gene expression of hydrogenases. Moreover, the formation of acetate by Fe2＋ remains favorable for hydrogen production [10]. Acetic acid formation provided both weak and moderate correlations ( r 2 from 0.44 to 0.7) with initial pH. Moderate positive relationship was available for ethanol except for control and 150 mg/L nZVI/CS concentration."
12,Cumulative hydrogen production,"3.4 Cumulative hydrogen production Modified Gompertz parameters and hydrogen yield for control and 150 mg/L nZVI/CS for initial pH 6.8 is provided in Table 1. Decrease in lag time, increase in maximum hydrogen production and hydrogen yields indicates the favorable growth conditions such as lower ORP and Fe nutrient provided by nZVI/CS. Improvement in electron transfer can also be a possible reason behind favorable​ variation of the kinetic parameters [9,12,16]."
13,Conclusion,"Addition of nZVI/CS enhanced the biohydrogen production in dark fermentation. The maximum hydrogen production yield was 243 mLH 2 ∕ g glucose , 30% higher than the control. The improved performance was associated with continuous supply of Fe2＋ from nZVI/CS that enhanced the performance of hydrogenase. As this study was in search for a possible enhancement of fermentative biohydrogen production in a lab-scale experiment, upscale research must be performed to verify the cost–benefit for large-scale applications. The reusability of nZVI/CS should be assessed in comparison with unmodified ZVI nanoparticle to justify the impact of chitosan. An attempt to immobilize E.aerogenes can also be suggested as a next step. This line of research is underway."
