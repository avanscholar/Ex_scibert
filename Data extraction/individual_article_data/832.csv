0,Introduction,"Some key global issues like energy security, the surge of oil prices, depletion of fossil fuels reserves, and as well as global warming, have all urged to seek for alternative and sustainable renewable energy source (Khongkliang et al., 2017). Hydrogen (H2) is a promising alternative energy carrier due to its high density (142 kJ/g), high conversion rate, and clean burning with zero carbon emissions (Tufa et al., 2018). Biological hydrogen production using biomass/wastewater through dark fermentation is an eco-friendly and energy-saving approach (Mishra et al., 2018). Dark fermentation utilizes a wide range of complex organic wastes as substrate and provides better hydrogen yield. Thermophilic condition of dark fermentation has found to be more energetically favourable for enhancing hydrolysis rate of complex substrate and better hydrogen yield (Krishnan et al., 2017). Hydrogen production has been investigated with various different types of wastewater at thermophilic condition such as glucose, sucrose, cheese whey, olive pulp, food waste, and the hydrogen yield varied from 38 ml H2 gCOD-1 to 125 mL H2 gCOD-1 (Turon et al., 2016). Tanikkul et al. (2018) obtained hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield of 1.9 mL h−1 g−1 TVS and 77 mL g−1COD under thermophilic condition at optimal organic loading rate (OLR) of 35,000 mg COD L−1 with 25% COD removal. However, conventional single stage hydrogen production has limitations such as low COD removal and low energy recovery. Up to 33–40% of electrons in hexose sugars can convert to H2 and 55–60% of substrate energy in organic matter remains as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (Naidoo et al., 2013). In order to treat H2 fermented effluent and to maximize energy production, the two-stage bioprocess of hydrogen production followed by methanogenic process has been proposed as post treatment process. Integration of microbial electrolysis cell (MECs) is a novel, promising, and economically feasible technology used to produce methane during the second stage (Dhar et al., 2015). In such process, hydrolysis, and acidogenesis take place during the first stage at optimal pH of 5–6 and HRT 1–3 days while the remaining organics of the first stage i.e. hydrogenic effluent was converted anaerobically into methane via methanogenesis under optimal HRT and pH range of 10–20 days and 7–8, respectively (Krishnan et al., 2016). Mamimin et al. (2015) achieved continuous hydrogen and methane yield of 210 L H2 kgCOD-1 and 310 L CH4 kgCOD-1, at feed rate of 60gCODL-1d-1 using CSTR-UASB reactor at thermophilic temperature (55 °C). MEC is a device that can convert organic acetic and butyric acid to methane gas through microbial electrolysis process (Bo et al., 2014). In MECs, microbial biofilm attached to anode acts as an electron donor, which oxidizes organic waste/or effluent, thereby releasing electrons to cathode through an extracellular circuit, where cathode respiring bacteria (like methanogens) and catalyse methanogenesis by reducing electron acceptor like CO2 to produce methane (Pisciotta et al., 2012). This new concept eventually helps to improve gaseous energy recovery. Few studies have revealed higher degradation rates of various types of substrates in a conventional single stage MEC system. Using MEC, Sun et al. (2015) observed an increase from 11% to 32% in the total COD removal from waste-activated sludge at a concentration of 10 g COD L−1. However, hydrogen production coupled with MEC is highly influenced by various physicochemical factors including pH, electric voltage, substrate type, temperature, HRT, OLR, and reactor configuration. These parameters need optimisation for effective microbial metabolic balance and subsequently the fermentation end products. Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a major environment threatening effluent in chief oil palm producing nations like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It is estimated that palm oil mill in Malaysia and Indonesia discharges around 60 million m3 which has a potential to generate power equivalent of 850 GW (Lamaming et al., 2015). POME has high organic content which is normally discharged at high temperatures around 60 to 70 °C. Therefore, thermophillic dark fermentation is preferably more suitable method for its treatment than other available methods in order to achieve dual benefit of energy recovery and waste stabilization. However, there is still a lack of information for optimised two-stage process to treat POME, especially for continuous operation. Based on the above information, we herein developed a two-stage bioprocess combining thermophilic hydrogen production CSTR reactor and a mesophilic methane production MEC reactor. The objective of the present work is to examine the hydrogen and methane production potential of the POME using a two-stage thermophilic dark fermentation and mesophilic MECs approach at different HRTs (4–12 days) and voltages (0.1–0.8 V). The continuous operation of two-stage reactors was monitored, optimised, and microbial consortia inside both bioreactors were analysed for its practical operation for three months in terms of stable hydrogen and methane gas production. This integrated approach is a feasible, low cost and effective treatment technology for industrial wastewater stream with coproduction of bioenergy resources like hydrogen and methane."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum Anaerobic seed sludge (anaerobic) for H2 and CH4 production was collected from the anaerobic pond of Felda palm oil industry located at Lepar Hilir, Gambang, Malaysia. The inoculum was stored immediately at 4 °C temperature after collection in order to prevent acidification by indegenous microbes. The ratio of C: N: P of POME was maintained at 500:5:1 using peptone and disodium monohydrogen phosphate and pH was adjusted to 5.5 by adding sodium carbonate. Initially, pre-heated sludge (90 °C for 60 min) was used as inoculum to initiate fermentation. Such heat treatment allows the enrichment of H2 producing microbes in sludge and limits the growth of competitive bioactive methanogens. For methane generation in MEC reactor, alkali treated sludge was prepared and used as inoculum. It was prepared by adjusting the pH of anaerobic sludge to 8.0 by the addition of 3 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). It was monitored in an incubator for 5 days at 37 °C until no biogas production was observed. The physiochemical characteristics of inoculum used in MEC reactor contained 14500 mg/L of total solids (TS), 12100 mg/L of volatile solids (VS) and 10400 mg/L of volatile suspended solids (VSS). Each parametric analysis was carried out in triplicates."
3,Palm oil mill effluent (POME),2.2 Palm oil mill effluent (POME) POME wastewater (feedstock) was collected from the final discharge point of the palm oil mill and its basic physicochemical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . It was viscous liquid and dark brown in colour with the pH of 5.1. The POME was stored immediately at 4 °C temperature after collection in order to avoid acidification. The ratio of C: N: P of POME was maintained at 500:5:1 using peptone and disodium mono-hydrogen phosphate and pH was adjusted to 5.5 by adding sodium carbonate.
4,Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC),"2.3 Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) These batch experiments were conducted to identify the methane production potential of POME at different voltage ranges and HRTs. The values obtained were applied in continuous operation during the second stage of the MEC process. 2.3.1 Methane production potential The methane production potential (MPP) of POME in the MEC was assessed using the batch experiments. The small sized MEC configuration (single chambered membrane free) was constructed using stainless steel (300 ml workable volume) and operated to produce methane from dark fermentation effluent. The effluent was obtained from POME that was effluent from H2-CSTR which had COD ranges of 30 g COD L-1. The electrodes were dipped inside the MEC reactor containing dark fermented effluent at 37 °C. Platinum wires were used to connect MEC systems with the DC power supplier. The influence of voltages on MEC performance in terms of CH4 production was studied by applying voltage ranging from 0.1 V to 0.8 V. 2.3.2 Effect of hydraulic retention time on methane production Single-chamber MEC reactor comprised of graphite felt anode (length 180 mm, diameter 22 mm, surface area 148 cm2) and titanium wires as a cathode. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode for measuring cathode potential during electrochemical analysis and the MEC was operated at 37 °C. The 16-channel voltage collection instrument (EX1401, Amtek) was used to monitor the electric current across an external resistor for voltage calculation. Total volume of the reactor was 2500 ml (a 2200 ml working volume; 17 cm length, 5.5 cm diameters, and 95 ml headspace) and the anode biofilms inside MEC was cultivated for 40 days prior to the addition of dark fermentation effluent. Very few studies have been conducted with larger volumes and with good yielding efficiency. The MEC reactor was filled with dark fermentation effluent at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 30 kg CODm-3d-1 and HRT of 12 days. Once the operation reached a steady-state, the HRT was decreased steadily from 12, 8 and 4 days. Each of the HRT was established when the value of methane production rate (MPR) was varied less than 10%. The liquid and gaseous samples were collected for analysis on a daily basis."
5,Continuous reactor operation,"2.4 Continuous reactor operation Continuous hydrogen and methane production were conducted in CSTR and MEC reactor system for 120 days in experimental setup. 2.4.1 Continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) A two-stage reactor comprised of CSTR and MEC with the working volume of 800 ml and 2200 ml respectively was used and its schematic representation was illustrated in Fig. 1 . The seed sludge (inoculum) was added to the CSTR to fill the effective volume of 20%. The POME slurry from the well mixed tank was fed to the CSTR (around 80%). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.5 in hydrogen fermentative reactor using automated pH controller. The process parameters of CSTR was maintained at 80 rev/min of stirring with continuous mixing of 15 s at every 45 s; OLR of 60 gCOD L-1 d-1; HRT 2 days, and operation temperature of 55 °C. The process reached to a steady state when the H2 content, biogas volume and pH were stable (less than 10% variation). 2.4.2 Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) The MEC was operated at pH 8.2 with the HRT of 8 days and the applied voltage of 0.5 V in order to produce methane. The optimal voltage 0.5 and HRT 8 days were chosen based on the batch experiments results (Section 2.3). 400 ml of seed inoculum (alkali treated sludge) was added to the MEC reactor and the three fourth volume 1800 ml was filled with dark fermentation effluent. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a circular water bath. Gas meter was attached to each reactor to monitor the volume of gases automatically. The CSTR-MEC reactor was monitored regularly for the levels of gas production, chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, suspended solids (SS) and VFA. The challenges associated with the two-stage processes include optimisation of voltage in MEC, organic loading rate, certainty of linkage between POME with inoculum type and its reactor configuration."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The composition of produced gas and its content was analysed by gas chromatograph-TCD, (Shimadzu GC-8A), with molecular sieve column (mesh 80/100; 6 ft x 1/8 inch). Argon gas was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 50 ml min-1 and temperature of the column and TCD was set to 90 °C and 110 °C, respectively. The concentrations of organic acids and alcohol in the spent medium were determined using Gas Chromatograph-FID, Stabilwax-DA capillary column, 30 m × 0.53 mm Resteck, USA) in which helium gas was used as a carrier gas. The detector was programmed for 100 °C, 3min; 9 °C/min; 260 °C, 8 min; 290 °C for VFAs, 42 °C, 5 min; 23 °C/min; 100 °C, 3 min; 290 °C for alcohols). Analysis of pH, VSS, VS, TS, COD and alkalinity tests were performed by following APHA methods (2005). The phenol sulphuric acid method was used to analyse carbohydrate content. The protein content was estimated following the Lowry assay, while the NH4+ and total nitrogen determined using HACH apparatus at an operating range of 0–8 mg/L ammonium."
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis The microbial community structure in both CSTR and MEC reactor was assessed using (PCR-DGGE) polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as previously described by Kongjan et al. (2014). The bands were amplified, purified, and sequenced and closest match were found through Gene Bank using BLAST (Mamimin et al., 2015)."
8,Gas production calculations,"2.7 Gas production calculations Modified Gompertz equation was followed to determine the total hydrogen and methane production in the reactors which is given in Equation (1) as (1) H ( t ) = P . exp { − exp } [ [ Rm . e ] P ( ƛ − t ) + 1 ] where, H(t) - total volume of gas (H2/CH4) production in mL; P – signifies the gas production potential in mL; Rm – represents the maximum gas production rate in mL/h; e −2.71828; l –indicates lag phase time in hours and t stands-cultivation time in hours."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Influence of applied voltage in MEC on methane production,"3.1 Influence of applied voltage in MEC on methane production Influence of voltages over MEC reactor ranging from 0.1 V to 0.8 V was investigated for upgrading total energy recovery. Maximal methane yield, net energy recovery, and COD removal of 290 ml CH4 gCOD-1, 92.72% and 91% were obtained from the applied voltage of 0.5 V. The voltage of 0.5 applied to the microbial electrolysis cell reactor was found optimal for maximum methane production rate and total energy recovery. The yield of the methane gas from given voltage of 0.1–0.8 was 179.71, 218.27, 248.72, 279.81, 289.92, 228.49, 182.69, and 150.21 ml CH4 gCOD-1, respectively (Table 2 ). The highest total H2 production of 2830 ml L-1 was achieved at 0.5 V among various voltages from 0.1 to 0.8 V. Variations of total methane production in response to the applied voltage are shown in Fig. 2 . The total methane production increased from 567 ml L-1 to 2834 ml L-1, along with the increase in voltage from 0.1 V to 0.5 V. The total H2 production started to decrease from 2532 to 1950 ml L-1when the voltage raised over 0.6–0.8 V. It is reported that the greater applied voltage causes high plasmatorrhexis, which results in low metabolic activity, and low growth rate (Ding et al., 2016), hence the decrease of methane yield and COD removal efficiency. Therefore, the applied voltage of 0.5 V is recommended as optimal for methane production using MEC in this study. Khongkliang et al. (2017) reported that the maximal energy recovery from the MEC using acetic acid as an organic feedstock at an applied voltage of 0.6 V was 217%. Similarly, Guo et al. (2013) reported that 11.4–13.6 fold increase in methane production using Titanium/Ruthenium electrodes MEC at the given voltage of 1.4 V. The aberrant increment in methane yields can be expected by applying additional electrical field."
11,Influence of HRT during methane generation with MEC,"3.2 Influence of HRT during methane generation with MEC The steady state MEC reactor was used to study the influence of HRT on the methane production. During the experiment, HRT was reduced from 12 to 8 days with the OLR escalating between 25 g L-1 d-1 and 35 g L-1 d-1. The effect of HRT on methane production is shown in Fig. 3 . The average MPR and methane yield at HRT of 12 days, 8 days, and 4 days were found to be 1.6, 2.37 and 0.93 L CH4 L-1d-1 and 158, 265 and 115 ml CH4gCOD-1 respectively. Generally, low OLR is favourable for methane yield, while high OLR is more favourable for MPR. The maximum methane yield of 290 ml CH4gCOD-1 was achieved at 8 days HRT. On day 67 onwards, the reactor was operated with 8 days HRT to prevent the overloading effect from 4 days HRT and the MPR could recover up to 283 ml L-1 d-1, indicating that of 30 g L-1 d-1 OLR at 8 days HRT was found maximal and optimal OLR for methane production by MEC. Watson et al. (2015) noticed that an increase in the OLR and at the same time, decreasing the HRT from 24 to 8 days resulted in an increased rate of 70% in hydrogen production. The COD removals at various HRT are presented in Table 3 . The COD removals decreased with low HRT. This was due to the fact that high HRT caused a low substrate feeding rate to allow the substrate to remain in the system for a longer time, resulted in the high substrate conversion (Ruiz et al., 2013). Generally, microorganisms overproduce methane when it faces a stepwise increase of OLR and later they re-adjust its cell mechanisms based on the newly applied operating conditions, slows down their metabolic activities to be adapted to the new environment (Scoma et al., 2013). The VFA removal efficiency was ranged between 45 and 49% during the experiment."
12,Continuous two-stage reactor performance,"3.3 Continuous two-stage reactor performance The dark fermentation was performed at 2 days HRT, temperature of 55 °C and pH 5.5 and the results of hydrogen production rate (HPR) are given in Fig. 4 a. The gas production from the acidogenic CSTR consisted mainly of H2 and CO2 with no methane was detected. The complete absence of methane could be associated with the heat treatment, thermophilic condition, and fermented under low pH and HRT conditions. Thermophilic fermentation of hydrogen in CSTR is highly suitable for hydrolysis of highly suspended solid waste like POME. CSTR promotes high rate anaerobic processes with low HRT and prevents the interference of high suspended solids in the substrates (Mishra et al., 2018). Higher temperatures (55Cº) are energetically favourable for bioH2 production, enabling thermophilic bacteria to reach higher hydrogen yields than mesophilic one (Mamimin et al., 2015). Furthermore, the strict anaerobic thermophilic condition seems to inhibit contamination by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The maximum HPR from CSTR was 1920 ml L-1 d-1. The average hydrogen production rate over the entire experiment was 1730 ml L-1 d-1 and the hydrogen content in biogas was 50–58% with an average concentration of 55%. The maximum hydrogen yield of 205 ml H2 gCOD-1 was produced along with other by-products acetic, butyric, propionic, and lactic with concentrations (Fig. 4b). The concentrations of organic acids such as acetate, butyrate, propionate, and lactate were 3300, 2324, 180 and 1400 mg/L, respectively. The concentration of acetic acid was high and the concentration of propionic acid was low which have contributed to the system for a higher H2 production performance. It suggests that any process aligned primarily towards acetic and butyric acid pathways ought to lead maximum hydrogen production (Westermann et al., 2007). The composition of VFA clearly indicates that preferable fermentation pattern for hydrogen release had occurred in the CSTR. The COD removals, carbohydrate consumption, and VS removal efficiency during the first stage was 39%, 81%, and 59%, respectively. During the second stage, the MEC reactor was operated using the effluent of the first stage with 10 days HRT to produce methane. The MPR observed in the reactor is shown in Fig. 5 a. The maximum and the average MPR were observed as 2690 ml L-1 d-1 and 2550 ml L-1 d-1, respectively. The effluent characteristics of both CSTR and MEC reactor are presented in Table 4 . Integrating CSTR with MECs has shown COD and VS removal of 52% and 28% respectively, which was only 49% and 28% at the end of the first stage (Fig. 5b). Ruiz et al. (2013) confirmed that about two thirds of the hydrogen recycle was owed to the activity of homoacetogens in the acetic acid fed MEC, which used H2 as the electron source to produce acetic acid that is later consumed by anode respiring bacteria. The mass and energy balance of the two-stage bioprocess is shown in Fig. 7. The overall energy yield and COD removal from this process were 15.24 MJ kg COD-1 and 91%. The H2 and CH4 ratio of 01.2 to 0.21 was archived with the total energy recovery of 15.24 MJ kg COD-1 from this study. The summary of the two-stage energy process using various organic wastewaters is shown in Table 5 . The biogas rate obtained is within the range reported by the previous studies. While comparing to the other studies on two-stage thermophilic process using cassava wastewater (Khongkliang et al., 2017), the energy production rate (224.2 kJ L-1 d-1) was observed slightly higher than that of the two-stage hydrogen and methane production by dark fermentation and MEC (15.24 MJ kg COD-1). The possible reason for this difference among these studies was due to the differences in terms of inoculums, specific condition of each pretreatment method and the type of substrates."
13,Microbial community analysis,"3.4 Microbial community analysis The composition of microbial community in CSTR and MEC was examined in order reveal the microbes associated with hydrogen and methane fermentation. The sludge from CSTR showed -the presence of Thermoanaerobacterium species such as T.thermosaccharolyticum, T. acidoterolans, Thermococalles and Clostridium acetobutylicum predominant microbial species. Reportedly, optimum pH and temperature for Thermoanaerobacterium sp. growth is 5–6.5 and 55–60 °C, respectively and it respires on various kinds of sugars from glucose, sucrose, galactose to cellulose, cellobiose, starch and xylan. Similarly, this species was found as the dominant hydrogen producing species at a temperature above 55 °C and pH 5.5 and it has a vital role in hydrogen formation (Khongkliang et al., 2017). Additionally, Mamimin et al. (2015) observed the predominance of Thermoanaerobacterium microbial structure at 55 °C in CSTR. The bacteria and archaeal community structure from MEC are shown in Fig. 6 . During start up sample the bacterial and archaea community in the anode biofilm in the reactor - consisted of Candidatus Nitrosocaldus sp, Desulfovibrio putealis, Caloranaerobacter sp. Several methanogens such as Methanoculleus sp, Methanobacterium formicicum, Methanobacterium sp, Methanosarcina sp, Methanolinea sp, Methanococcoides Methanolinea sp, and Methanobacterium beijingense were found in the cathode biofilm. These results suggested that the applied 0.5 V on alkaline pre-treated sludge can enhance the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Methanosarcina sp can also convert methyl compounds such as methyl sulphides, methylamines, and methanol in to methane. Generally, D.putealis has specific cytochromes for extracellular electron transfers (enzyme coupled oxidative metabolism) to the electrode. Previously, this biofilm grown on graphite electrodes was found to produce hydrogen by gaining electrons. As described by Liu et al. (2016) and Zhao et al. (2015) Methanoculleus sp, Methanobacterium sp Methanosarcina sp perform acetoclastic methanogenesis that convert acetate into methane, and M. formicicum follows hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to produce methane from formate, hydrogen, and CO2. Similarly, Linji et al. (2013) observed the Methanosarcina was enriched inside a MEC reactor of graphite carbon cathode at the given voltage of 0.3 V. The quick conversion of hydrogen ions and CO2 generated during decomposition into methane gas by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was noticed. Besides, acetoclastic methanogenesis had occurred in the MEC owing to the pH decrease and VFAs accumulation. According to Malvankar et al. (2012) and Park et al. (2018) syntrophic interactions between two microbes generate a positive effect on MECs performance and generate energy. The presence of Methanosarcina sp., Caloranaerobacter sp, and a mesoalkaline archaeon, may be due to alkaline pretreatment at room temperature could screen this species from the microorganisms of sludge (Morita et al., 2011). It was demonstrated that methanogenesis occurs on an electrode surface, on which methane-producing archaea can able to convert the protons, electrons, and CO2 into methane gas (Clauwaert et al., 2008). Concurrently, the microaerobic oxygen generation at the anode region increases the hydrolysis performance towards high methane yield (Sun et al., 2015)."
14,Conclusions,"In this study, the two-stage dark fermentation coupled with MEC was found to be an efficient process for continuous H2 and CH4 production from the POME. The given voltage of 0.5 was optimal for microbial MEC to obtain maximal biogas yield. MPR of continuous single stage MEC was found to be 2700 ml CH4 gCOD-1. The hydrogen production was operated in CSTR under a pH of 5.5, 55 °C temperature, 2 days HRT, and 60 g CODL-1 d-1 OLR to achieve 1800 ml H2 L-1 maximum hydrogen production rate. The maximum methane production rate during the second stage using MEC was 2700 ml CH4 L-1 at 8 days HRT. The H2 and CH4 yields were 205 ml H2 gCOD-1 and 290 ml CH4 gCOD-1 with maximum 91% COD removed. Thermoanaerobacterium sp was dominated in the H2-CSTR while Methanobacterium formicicum and Methanobacterium beijingense were found dominant in MEC with the overall energy recovery of 95%. It is recommended that the production can be further enhanced by introducing immobilized sludge as biocatalyst and this approach prevents cell washout and maximizes the production rate and yield. Two-stage technologies of hydrogen and methane is one of best simple practical approaches to concurrently producing high energy carrier and efficient waste stabilization which is possibly promising to develop in to industrial scale in the near future."
