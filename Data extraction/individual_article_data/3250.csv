0,Introduction,"Sugar alcohols (polyols or polyhydric alcohols), derived from substituting an aldehyde group in a sugar molecule with a hydroxyl one, are low-digestible carbohydrates that are used as sweeteners in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries [1–3]. Sugar alcohols can be classified as hydrogenated monosaccharides (sorbitol, mannitol), hydrogenated disaccharides (isomaltitol, maltitol, lactitol), and mixtures of hydrogenated mono-, di-and/or oligosaccharides (hydrogenated starch hydrolysates) [1,3,4]. Recently, because of recognition of the beneficial effects of maltitol and maltotriitol by the food industry (especially in baking and beverage) and the pharmaceutical industry (such as their anti-dental plaque effect or drug activity related to their glass-forming structures in freeze state), the hydrogenated starch hydrolysates having high content of maltitol and maltotriitol are becoming increasingly attractive [3–10]. Maltotriitol is a trisaccharide polyol that consists of two glucoses and a sorbitol, while maltitol is a disaccharide polyol of glucose and sorbitol in equal parts. Both sugar alcohols can be obtained from starch hydrolysates with a chemical hydrogenation process in which maltitol is derived from hydrogenation of maltose and maltotriitol from maltotriose. The purified form of maltitol has been commercially produced with purification and crystallization from the hydrogenation mixture of maltose syrup. However, the purified maltotriitol is not routinely prepared because of the high cost and/or low conversion efficiency for the production of maltotriose from either pullulan hydrolyzed with pullulanase or starch with a specific α-amylase [11,12]. At present, the mixture of sugar alcohols consisting of ∼70% maltitol and up to ∼20% maltotriitol can be prepared from starch, in which maltotriose, the precursor of maltotriitol, is formed as a by-product during high maltose syrup preparation [1,3,4]. Given that a higher maltotriitol content (for example,>40%) is more desirable for certain food formula or manufacturing [4,12], it is of value to develop a new process based on starch hydrolysates to increase the maltotriose yield. In the present work, an enzymatic process was developed to produce a syrup with higher maltotriose content. Thermostable α-amylase was used to convert the starch into soluble maltodextrin, which was further debranched with a pullulanase to form malto-oligosaccharides (MOS) and simultaneously saccharified with bacterial α-amylase and β-amylase to produce maltotriose-rich MOS syrup. With chemical hydrogenation, the hydrogenated malto-oligosaccharide alcohol (MOSA) with a higher percentage of maltotriitol can be conveniently prepared from starch, thus allowing the production of a wide range of hydrogenated starch hydrolysates with different percentages of maltotriitol and other sugar alcohols. In lieu of the above the aim of this study focused on the development of a new process based on starch hydrolysates to increase the maltotriose content in malto-oligosaccharides (MOS)."

2,Development and optimization of MOS preparation process,"2.1 Development and optimization of MOS preparation process The action of enzyme (BBA, BAA, or PulA) on maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, or maltodextrin was carried out at 55°C and pH 5.8 for up to 3h with a substrate concentration of 25% (w/v) in a 5-mL volume. The samples were collected, followed by inactivation of enzymes by incubating at 100°C for 10min. The sugar profiles were analyzed by HPLCs as described below. The experiments for MOS preparation were carried out in a 500-mL reactor with the following steps: (1) Starch liquefaction: this was carried out with 25% (w/v, dried starch weight) cornstarch slurry in tap water and 200U/g (dried starch) of BLA at pH 5.8 and ∼100°C for different time periods, and samples were collected and the dextrose equivalent (DE) values were determined as described below. (2) Debranching: different amounts of PulA were added after the reaction mixture was cooled to 55°C, and the reaction was carried out at 55°C for up to 4h. (3) Saccharification: BAA and BAA plus BBA were added, and the reaction was maintained at 55°C for up to 12h. For scaling-up preparation of MOS in a 10-L reactor, 25% (w/v) liquefied cornstarch with DE value of about 29 was used as substrate, and the debranching and saccharification were carried out at 55°C. The samples were collected, followed by inactivation of enzymes by adjusting pH to 9.0 with 1mol/L sodium hydroxide, and incubated at 100°C for 10min. The sugar profiles were analyzed by HPLCs as described below."
3,Hydrogenation of MOS for MOSA production,"2.2 Hydrogenation of MOS for MOSA production The hydrogenation of MOS was carried out in a 20-l reactor catalyzed with Raney Ni RTH-311 under 11MPa, 120–130°C, and 500rpm for 2h according to the method described in [16]. The sugar profiles were determined by HPLC as described below."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods The DE value of liquefied starch was determined with the titrimetric method using glucose as reference according to the method described [17]. The total dry matter was determined as described previously [18]. The content and components of low molecular weight monosaccharides of MOS and MOSA were detected with an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system coupled with a ELSD detector (Alltech, Grace Co. Ltd.). The HPLC system included a carbomyl-silica HILIC column (TSK gel, Amide 80, 5μm, 80Å, 250mm×4.6mm I.D., Tosoh, Japan). The conditions for the column, injection of samples and standard curves for the mixture of G1–G6 were as described by Karlsson et al., 2005 [19]. Large molecular weight components were also analysed from MOS using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system coupled with a refractive index (RI) detector using a TSK gel G3000PW column (7.8mm ID×300mm, 7μm, Tosoh, Japan) with water as a solvent at a flow rate of 0.6mLmin−1 at 30°C as per manufacturers’ instructions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The procedure for maltotriitol-rich MOSA prepared from starch,"3.1 The procedure for maltotriitol-rich MOSA prepared from starch The general procedure for preparing maltotriitol-rich MOSA from starch is shown in Fig. 1 . Three main steps are involved: (1) starch liquefaction to form maltodextrin syrup, (2) maltodextrin debranching and saccharification to form maltotriose-rich malto-oligosaccharides syrup, and (3) chemical hydrogenation to produce maltotriitol-rich MOSA. The protocols outlined below were optimized by multiple laboratory experiments in our quest for the development of a novel process for preparing maltotriitol-rich MOSA from starch (data not shown). A 25% cornstarch slurry at the laboratory scale or 30–33% cornstarch slurry at the industrial scale in tap water (pH 5.8) was thoroughly mixed with thermostable B. licheniformis α-amylase. The starch liquefaction degree was controlled, and the optimized DE value of the resultant maltodextrin syrup was about 29. The maltodextrin syrup was treated at 55°C to debranch to yield MOS (with G2–G6 as its main components) with pullulanase (the optimized dosage was 8U/g dried substrate); the debranched MOS was simultaneously digested with various combinations of BAA and BBA to produce the maltotriose-rich MOS (the optimized combination was 16U BAA per gram of dried substrate and 0.1 DP BBA per gram of dried substrate). The resultant maltotriose-rich MOS syrup was chemically hydrogenated, and the maltotriitol-rich MOSA was produced with the conversion efficiency of up to 98.76%."
7,The maltotriose and maltopentaose levels of the syrup were greatly affected by the liquefaction degree of starch,"3.2 The maltotriose and maltopentaose levels of the syrup were greatly affected by the liquefaction degree of starch It is expected that maltotriose and maltopentaose levels in the maltodextrin syrup will determine the level of maltotriitol in the final product as maltopentaose may be further converted to maltotriose during the following saccharification stage. Therefore, the components of MOS in the liquefied starch with different DE values were analyzed and the results are summarized in Table 1 . The percentage of maltotriose in the liquefied starch with DE value of 15.6, 17.5, 27.8, 29.4, 32.4, 33.4, 38.0, 39.4, or 41.9 was 21.20%, 22.61%, 20.81%, 22.51%, 22.83%, 22.08%, 22.21%, 22.46%, 22.78%, or 23.95%, respectively, calculated on the basis of the total detectable sugar, while the content of maltopentaose was 31.46%, 33.32%, 44.42%, 49.15%, 45.29%, 40.38%, 39.19%, 38.59%, 35.40%, or 24.32%, respectively. Importantly, the percentage of maltotriose remained at about 22% after the DE values of liquefied starch were above 17.5, whereas that of maltopentaose largely depends on the degree of liquefaction; the maximum percentage of maltopentaose of 49.15% was obtained with the liquefied starch of 29.4 DE (Table 1). It is also noted that the total hydrolysis rate was about 83.7% of the theoretical conversion rate (93.02%/111.11%), indicating the presence of significant amounts of maltodextrins (mainly α-1,6-linkage limited dextrin) and the requirement of debranching with a pullulanase."
8,Converting maltodextrin syrup to MOS with pullulanase,"3.3 Converting maltodextrin syrup to MOS with pullulanase It is well established that pullulanase is a crucial enzyme in starch bioprocessing as it hydrolyzes α-1,6-linkage and consequently debranches amylopectin to form amylose [20]. However, its debranching efficiency on maltodextrin with low degree of polymerization is unknown. Different dosages of pullulanase were applied to the liquefied starch with the DE value of 15.6. The resultant hydrolysates were monitored with HPLC. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 . By using 8U/g pullulanase, almost all maltodextrin in the liquefied starch was digested into MOS (Fig. 2A) and resulted in a 105.80% conversion rate for substrate to MOS, which represents 95.22% of the theoretical conversion rate. The components in the MOS were glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, and maltohexaose (Fig. 2B)."
9,Conversion of MOS to maltotriose-rich MOS through the cooperative action of BAA and BBA,"3.4 Conversion of MOS to maltotriose-rich MOS through the cooperative action of BAA and BBA Among BAA, BBA, and PulA, BBA is known to act only on amylose or MOS to release maltose. We therefore examined the activity of BAA, BBA, and PulA on maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, or maltohexaose at 55°C for up to 3h by using HPLC to analyze the hydrolyzed products. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 . Clearly, PulA had no activity on G2–G6 and BBA and BAA had no activity on G2 and G3. BBA hydrolyzed G4 to G2, whereas BAA exhibited no activity on it (Fig. 3). BBA converted G5 to G2 and G3; BAA could also hydrolyze G5 into G2 and G3, but its activity was weaker than that of BAA (Fig. 3). Both BAA and BBA showed activities on G6, but the digestion patterns were totally different. BBA acted on G6 to release G2 and G4 first, and the resultant G4 was further hydrolyzed into G2; therefore, the final product of BBA on G6 was G2 (Fig. 3). However, BAA acted on G6 with a random digestion pattern and tended to form G5 and G3 first and then G2 and G1 but less G4 (Fig. 3). BAA acted on G6 with the following product pattern: G5+G1>G3+G3>G3+G2>G4+G2 (data not shown). These findings clearly indicated that the cooperative action of BBA and BAA can be used for G3-rich MOS preparation. Further experiments were carried out to examine the efficiency of G3 formation under the cooperative action of BBA and BAA. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The optimum dosage of BAA for maltotriose formation was 16U/g dried substrate. The optimum dosage of BBA in cooperation with 16U/g of BAA was 0.1 DP/g dried substrate. Through the catalytic actions of BAA and BBA, the G3-conversion efficiency reached up to 43.61% (Table 2). More BBA was not beneficial for maltotriose formation probably due to the fact that more G6 was converted into G2 by BBA but not into G3 or G5 by BAA (Fig. 3)."
10,Maltotriose-rich MOS preparation in a 10-L reactor,"3.5 Maltotriose-rich MOS preparation in a 10-L reactor On the basis of the above observations, maltotriose-rich MOS preparation was conducted under the following conditions: 25% (w/v) liquefied starch with the DE value of about 29 was adjusted to pH 5.8 and 8U/g pullulanase, 16U/g BAA, and 0.1 DP/g BBA were then added. The reaction was carried out for up to 22h at 55–58°C. Sugar profiles were monitored at fixed time points. As shown in Fig. 4 , rapid increase in maltotriose contents was observed within 1h, followed by a slow increase until the highest yield of 42.49% at 10h. A substrate conversion rate of 105.88% for MOS was reached, which represents 95.29% of the theoretical value. The contents of other sugar components were 6.45% (glucose), 49.40% (maltose), and 3.42% (maltotetraose). A further extension of saccharification process did not significantly increase maltotriose yields (Fig. 4)."
11,Sugar alcohol preparation with chemical hydrogenation,"3.6 Sugar alcohol preparation with chemical hydrogenation Sugar alcohol syrup was prepared using a chemical hydrogenation process, and the sugar alcohol profiles were analyzed. The syrup contained 48.51% of maltitol, 42.18% of maltotriitol, 6.76% of sorbitol, and 1.31% of maltotetraitol (Table 3 ). A yield of 98.76% for oligomeric maltoligosaccharide alcohol from MOS was obtained (Table 3). Thus, the total conversion rate for MOSA from starch was 104.57% (105.88%×98.76%). Considering that chemical hydrogenation of oligosaccharides is efficient (Table 3), the objective of this study was to produce maltotriose-rich malto-oligosaccharides from starch by an enzymatic process. Through evaluation and optimization of different enzyme preparations, a new process for preparing maltotriose-rich MOS was developed that was based on the collaborative action of BAA, BBA, and PulA. The resulting MOSA syrup contains>40% maltotriitol and>48% maltitol with a total substrate conversion rate of 104.57%, which represented the highest level ever reported. Generally, for production of starch-derived sugars, for example, glucose and maltose, starch liquefaction degree is always well controlled to satisfy the requirement of product conversion rate, especially in the manufacture of high maltose syrup, in which the low starch liquefaction degree (usually no higher than 8 DE value) is crucial. On the contrary, our study found that higher starch liquefaction degree but low dose of BBA is desirable for preparing maltotriose-rich syrup. The possible reason for this effect is that maltodextrin chain with odd degree of polymerization or G6 can be more conducive to the formation of maltotriose catalyzed by BAA not by BBA. It has been reported that certain types of α-amylases from various organisms are capable of direct hydrolysis of amylose to release maltotriose as main or even sole product, which might be used to develop a direct process for preparing high maltotriose syrup with starch as raw materials [12,21–27]. The maltotriose-containing syrup using Microbacterium imperiale maltotriose-producing amylase was composed of 55–60% maltotriose, 10–20% maltose, 1–3% glucose, and 20–40% other higher oligosaccharides [26]. However, no conversion efficiency from starch was recorded. Recently, AmyA from Microbulbifer thermotolerans DAU221 was identified as a novel maltotriose-producing α-amylase. Under the optimal conditions of reaction time, temperature, and pH (1.76h, 44.95°C, and pH 6.35, respectively), it produced maltotriose as a main product from 1% soluble starch with an approximate conversion rate of 24% [12]. Each of these enzymes may further be tested for their potential collaborative action with BAA, BBA, and PulA in maltotriitol-rich MOSA production."
12,Conclusion,"A novel process for the production of maltotriose-rich MOS and of maltotriitol-rich MOSA from starch was developed after chemical hydrogenation. This emanated from the cooperative activities of a B. naganoensis pullulanase, B. amyloliquefaciens α-amylase, and barley bran β-amylase on the liquefied starch hydrolyzed by B. licheniformis α-amylase; this process can enable to produce various desirable formulations of malto-oligosaccharide alcohols with different contents of sugar alcohols."
