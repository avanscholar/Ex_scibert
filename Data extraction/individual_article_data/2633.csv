0,Introduction,"Vegetal biomass, also called lignocellulose, is distinguished by being refractory to physicochemical and enzymatic treatments. Several factors contributed to this recalcitrance, such as the association between the three principal components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), the increase in its available superficial area for reaction, and the crystallinity of the cellulose [1]. There are two chief routes for converting the carbohydrate fraction of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels, such as hydrogen and alcohols (ethanol/butanol): (1) a series of steps comprising substrate conditioning, enzyme production, cellulose saccharification, and sugar fermentation, and (2) a consolidated bioprocess (CBP) that integrates the last three steps. In principle, a CBP requires less capital, has minor operating costs and higher global yields than conventional steps [2]. In a CBP, microorganisms must perform multiple tasks simultaneously when are grown on lignocellulosic biomass, such as dissolution of the polymeric components, polysaccharide solubilization, delignification, and sugar fermentation. Earlier studies used natural microbial consortia (NMC) to produce hydrogen or bioalcohols from lignocellulosic substrates [3–5]. Despite attaining biofuel production and until to understand the type of biological interactions presents in NMC, there are concerns associated with them. For example, the risk of losing their primary functions, low yields, and long fermentation times (>3d), which could increase the equipment and operating costs substantially. Alternatively, synthetic microbial consortia (SMC) integrate two or more known microbial populations with complementary metabolic activities [6]. In bioenergy, medicine, and food, there are various types of SMC applied. Microbial interactions, such as commensalism through metabolite interchange and microenvironmental manipulation, competition, and mutualistic division of resources, occur in SMC, effecting greater productivity, stability, and metabolic functions compared with single cultures. Most SMC are cocultures of two complementary microbial species, and some of them used three or more species. Certain SMC for hydrogen production cocultured species of Bacillus and Clostridium; the first hydrolyzes the substrate (for example, starch) and the second ferments the released sugars. Also, Bacillus (a facultative anaerobe) establishes an anaerobic environment in which Clostridium (an obligate anaerobe) prospers [7]. Also, negative interactions between these species could occur such as competition for starch if both species were amylase producer. Other SMC contained Clostridium butyricum with Escherichia coli using glucose as substrate [8] where the total H2 production enhanced possibly through of a mutualistic division of glucose. Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus with Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii improved the H2 production rate by consuming simultaneously glucose and xylose [9]. C. butyricum (a H2 producer) with Enterococcus saccharolyticus (a cellobiose degrader) produced H2 from cellobiose [10] apparently by a commensal interaction since C. butyricum benefits from E. saccharolyticus while E. saccharolyticus was unaffected. C. butyricum (a amylase producer) with Enterobacter aerogenes (a facultative anaerobe without the ability to utilize starch) efficiently produced H2 from starch [11] exhibiting a mutualistic interaction since both species required benefits from other one to live on such conditions. However, there are a few studies exploring the feasibility of using native lignocellulosic substrates for hydrogen production by SMC [12–14]. For bioalcohol production, a SMC integrated Clostridium thermocellum (a cellulase and xylanase producer), Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense (an amylase and xylanase producer), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a specialized fermenter) for ethanol/hydrogen production from cassava pulp [15], where S. cerevisiae received the glucose produced by the hydrolytic species. C. thermocellum (a cellulolytic and xylanolytic species) with Clostridium thermolacticum (a specialized pentoses consumer) produced ethanol from simple and complex carbohydrates [16]; two types of ecological interactions could be established depending if C. thermolacticum was benefited from C. thermocellum only (commensalism) or both species received benefits from the other (mutualism). Clostridium acetobutylicum (a solventogenic species) with Bacillus subtilis (a facultative anaerobe) produced acetone–butanol–ethanol from spoilage date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruits [17]; C. acetobutylicum clearly benefits from B. subtilis that establishes an anaerobic atmosphere, but it is not clear if B. subtilis competed for nutrients with C. acetobutylicum or received benefits in some way. Two specialists, Trichoderma reesei (a hydrolytic species) with E. coli (a fermenter species) produced isobutanol from hydrolyzates of corn stover [18]. Scheffersomyces stipitis (a specialized xylose fermenter) with S. cerevisiae (a specialized glucose fermenter) improved the ethanol production from hydrolyzates of wheat straw containing a mixture of xylose and glucose, since S. cerevisiae fermented rapidly glucose into ethanol leaving the xylose for its fermentation by S. stipitis [19]. Clostridium beijerinckii (a ABE producer) with Clostridium cellulovorans (a specialized cellulose degrader) were co-cultured for acetone–butanol–ethanol production from alkali-pretreated corn cobs where the high saccharolytic activity of C. cellulovorans provided glucose for C. beijerinckii [20]. Based on previous experiences, SMC for biofuel production present advantages such as the stable coexistence between microorganisms, the ability of such co-cultures to degrade complex substrates, and higher yields compared with monocultures. In this work, two SMC were designed for hydrogen and solvent production from wheat straw under a biorefinery scheme. The first SMC produced hydrogen from the xylan fraction, and the second SMC produced solvents from the cellulose fraction. Both SMC contained hydrolytic and fermentative species integrating the units for pre-treatment, enzyme production, saccharification and fermentation. Therefore, both SMC operated as a CBP."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Hydrogen production was performed with native wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.; cultivar Urbina S2007). The chain of custody of the straw from the field to the laboratory has been described [21]. Wheat straw (WS) samples retained on 2.00-mm sieves were used. The composition per kilogram of WS was 956g total solids, 867g volatile solids, 387g cellulose, 190g hemicellulose, 173 lignin, 30.6g extractives, and 86g ash, Fig. 1 [5]. Acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production was achieved with a mixture of the spent fermented substrate recovered from H2-producing reactors [5]. This fermented wheat straw (FWS) was washed with tap water until clarity. The FWS was dried at room temperature and then in a stove at 105±0.5°C for 12h. FWS samples retained on 2.00-mm sieves were used. The composition per kilogram of FWS was 895g volatile solids, 588g cellulose, 143g hemicellulose, 145 lignin, 12g extractives, and 77g ash (Fig. 1)."
3,Isolation and screening of xylanolytic strains,"2.2 Isolation and screening of xylanolytic strains Xylanolytic strains were isolated from the epiphytic microflora of WS at day 28 of a natural fermentation [5]. To this end, Petri dishes were prepared with xylan (SIGMA, X4252) as the sole carbon source. The composition of the anaerobic medium per liter was: peptone 1g, KH2PO4 4.4g, K2HPO4 0.7g, MgCl2 0.1g, NaCl 2.0g, CaCl2 0.5g, KCl 0.1g, l-cysteine 0.5g, resazurin 0.01g, K vitamin 0.01g, and hemin 0.001g [22]. The Petri dishes were inoculated with 100μL of the fermentation supernatant using the spreading technique in a Plas-Labs anaerobic chamber with an atmosphere of N2/CO2 (80/20) and incubated at 37±0.5°C for 96h. The resulting colonies with various morphologies were reseeded until to obtain monocultures, as verified by microscopy. The isolated strains were stored in serological bottles with anaerobic medium and xylan at 4°C. For screening purposes, the isolated strains were grown on 100mL of anaerobic medium with 1.8g/L oat-spelt xylan for 24h. For positive H2-producing strains, xylanase activity was assayed per Nagar et al. [23]."
4,Molecular identification,"2.3 Molecular identification DNA was extracted per the instructions in the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit (SIGMA, NA2120). A region of the 16S rDNA gene was amplified using 28F and 519R primer pairs, based on Yoon et al. [24], using the Quick Load Taq2x Master Mix kit (New England BioLabs, M0271S) in a thermal cycler (C1000 Touch, Bio-Rad, USA). The PCR products were purified using the PureLink PCR Purification kit (Invitrogen, K3100-01) and sequenced at National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity (LANGEBIO Irapuato, Mexico). The sequences were compared using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database with the BLAST tool. Also, the results were corroborated with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP), available at www.rdpcme.msu.edu. The nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers are KT029122–KT029126."
5,Hydrogen production by synthetic microbial consortia,"2.4 Hydrogen production by synthetic microbial consortia 2.4.1 Preparation of preinoculum The SMC for hydrogen production integrated xylanolytic isolates producers of hydrogen. Prior to the fermentation experiments, the xylanolytic isolates were precultured individually in 100mL of modified PYG medium (composition per liter: peptone 5g, yeast extract 10g, tryptone 5g, KH2PO4 4.4g, K2HPO4 1g, MgCl2·6H2O 0.1g, NaCl 2g, CaCl2 0.5g, KCl 0.1g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.0011g, and l-cysteine 0.5g), containing 2.5g/L oat spelt xylan as the carbon source, with an initial pH of 6.5. Precultures were incubated statically at 37±0.5°C for 24h. 2.4.2 Batch fermentations The batch reactors consisted of 120mL serological bottles with a working volume of 100mL. The reactors were loaded with 2.5% total solids (TS) of native wheat straw and 80mL of modified PYG medium with an initial pH of 6.0±0.5. The reactors were sterilized at 15lb/pulg2 for 15min and maintained statically for 24h to effect complete hydration and swelling of the substrate [21,25]. Then, 20mL of pre-culture in log phase was added to an initial optical density of 0.2 units. The treatments for the synthetic microbial consortia were: single-species cultures of each bacterial isolates as controls, two-species SMC, and a three-species SMC. In the multispecies cultures, each species was inoculated at the same optical density at 600nm to sum an initial value of 0.2 units. The reactors were incubated statically at 37±0.5°C for 14d. Reactors with culture medium and each inoculum without WS were used as controls. The H2 produced in these control treatments was subtracted from the respective treatments with WS. Each treatment and all controls were performed in triplicate."
6,ABE production by synthetic microbial consortia,"2.5 ABE production by synthetic microbial consortia 2.5.1 Preparation of preinoculum The SMC for solvent production integrated two bacteria: C. beijerinckii ATCC® 10132™ (Cb) and C. cellulovorans ATCC® 35296™ (Cc). Precultures were established as described for the xylanolytic isolates but grown on glucose. The treatments were: single-species cultures of each strain as controls (Cc and Cc) and a two-species SMC (Cb–Cc). In the two-species culture, the strains were inoculated at the same optical density at 600nm to sum an initial value of 0.2 units. 2.5.2 Batch fermentations Batch reactors for ABE production were similar to the hydrogen reactors, except that were loaded with 10% TS of FWS, the initial pH was 5.5, and were incubated statically at 37±0.5°C for 10d."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The volume, biogas composition, and sugar consumption were measured per [5]. To determinate the sugar consumption, the spent substrate after fermentation was recovered, dried and weighted. Before the sugar analysis, the solid particles were washed using acetic acid–nitric acid reagent to eliminate biomass [26]. The profiles of organic acids and solvents in the reactor supernatants were determined using a gas chromatograph (Varian 3300, USA) equipped with a FID detector and a 15-m-long (0.53mm id) Zebron ZB-FFAP column. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 190 and 210°C, respectively. The column temperature was maintained at 45°C for 1.5min, after which it increased to 135°C at a rate of 8°Cmin−1. N2 was the carrier gas at 9.5mL/min."
8,Crystallinity analysis,"2.7 Crystallinity analysis The FTIR spectra of WS loaded as substrates and spent WS (from H2 and ABE reactors) were measured on an FTIR spectrometer (IRAffinity-1, Shimadzu, Japan). The conditions of analysis were: resolution of 4cm−1 using 20 scans and frequency range of 600–4000cm−1. FTIR analysis was conducted to determine an infrared ratio related to cellulose structure, the peak pair 1429cm−1 (crystalline cellulose) and 893cm−1 (amorphous cellulose) which is referred as crystallinity index [27,28]. Also, cellulose crystallinity of native and fermented WS was analyzed in an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Ultima IV, Rigaku Americas, USA) with CuK generated at 40kV and 30mA which gives a wavelength of 1.54Å. The scan range was from 10° to 80° (2 theta), the sweep speed ad step width were 2° 2θ/min and 0.02°. The crystallinity index was calculated according to Segal et al. [29]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Hydrogen production from wheat straw xylan,"3.1 Hydrogen production from wheat straw xylan Hydrogen production by the epiphytic microflora of wheat straw was recently demonstrated [5]. Such bacteria, which occur naturally on the surface of leaves [30], specialize in consuming five-carbon sugars for hydrogen production. Here, seven strains of such epiphytic microflora were isolated; they were grown on oat-spelt xylan as the sole carbon source but exhibited low growth on glucose and cellulose. All isolates were Gram-positive, short-chain-forming, facultative anaerobic cocci, some of which failed to produce gas from sugar fermentation, whereas strains RP2, RP3, RP4, and RP7 produced hydrogen from oat-spelt xylan after 24h of incubation (Fig. 2 ). The organic acid production profile for these strains comprised acetic, lactic, propionic and succinic acids, similar to previously isolated enterococci [31,32]. The xylanolytic activities on oat-spelt xylan were 19, 29, 38, and 242mIU/mL for RP2, RP3, RP4, and RP7, respectively. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that the xylanolytic isolates belonged to the genus Enterococcus (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary material). The strains of Enterococcus RP3, RP4 and RP7 were selected to integrate the SMC for hydrogen production from wheat-straw xylan (WSX). In single-species cultures, the H2 production from WSX differed among isolates. E. RP7 had the highest biogas and hydrogen production, 69.3mL/g WSXadded with a maximum H2 content of 50.6% v/v, whereas E. RP3 and E. RP4 produced half the amount of biogas with a negligible H2 content of 5.5% and 0.7% v/v, respectively (Fig. 3 a). In these single-species cultures, the xylose consumption was 30%, 36% and 12% for E. RP3, E. RP4 and E. RP7, respectively (the glucose consumption was <5%). Although all of the single-species cultures consumed WSX, E. RP7 was the major hydrogen producer. The isolates E. RP3 and E. RP4 behaved differently in purified versus native xylan; the substrate consumption pathway was coupled to the hydrogen production in purified xylan but not in native xylan. When two-species SMC are tested, different types of species interactions occur. They can establish interactions that help or harm the other species, which is reflected in the overall growth – biogas and hydrogen production in this work. To study these species’ interactions, two-species SMC integrated the enterococcal isolates: RP3–RP4, RP3–RP7, and RP4–RP7 (Fig. 3b). The combinations of RP3–RP4 and RP4–RP7 had higher hydrogen production than that expected from the sum of the hydrogen production from the single-species cultures. The hydrogen production was 1.5 and 5 times higher than expected in the combinations RP4–RP7 and RP3–RP4, respectively. In contrast, the combination RP3–RP7 had worse hydrogen production in comparison with that expected. In pairwise cultures, three major behaviors could occur [33,34]. When two species occupy different niches, there is no competition for resources, and they do not interact with each other. In such conditions, growth is unaffected by the presence of the other species, and the overall growth is expected to be the sum of the two single species grown alone (additive growth is expected). When two species use the same resources, there is a negative interaction because the two species are mutually competitive. In this case, the overall growth is worse than the sum of the two single species grown alone (negative growth is expected). A synergistic interaction occurs when one or both species benefit from the presence of the other species. In a synergistic interaction, growth is expected to be higher than additive. Based on the behavior of biogas and hydrogen production in the single-species cultures on WSX, it is possible to infer the type of interaction that prevailed in the two-species SMC. The combination RP4–RP7 had a positive interaction, where the actual hydrogen production of 48.7mL/g WSXadded was barely greater than the additive hydrogen production of 34.7mL/g WSXadded (Fig. 3b). In the pairwise culture RP4–RP7, the biogas production corresponded to the sum of the biogas from the single-species cultures grown alone, but the hydrogen content improved in comparison with that expected only from additive growth. It is possible that E. RP7 facilitates soluble oligosaccharides to E. RP4, a similar condition to that in purified xylan in which E. RP4 produces hydrogen. Regarding the combination RP3–RP4, which both had the worst hydrogen production on WSX, the pairwise culture presented a positive interaction improving the hydrogen production by a factor of five. For this pairwise culture, the biogas production corresponded to that expected from additive growth, but the hydrogen content was improved. With a negative interaction, the combination RP3–RP7 performed worse (14.8mL/g WSXadded) than the expected hydrogen production of 26.9mL/g WSXadded (sum of the single-species cultures). The negative interaction between RP3 and RP7 could be due to several factors such as the relative abundance of species, loss of one of the species, competition for one specific nutrient that limited the growth of both species or toxin production [34], such as bacteriocins produced by enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria—in particular, closely related strains [35]. The information presented here is not sufficient to elucidate the mechanism of such negative interactions. Further work is needed including quantification of the resources used by each species, the production of toxins and monitoring of species abundance over time. The consumption of xylose and glucose by the two-species SMC was as follows: 22% and 9% for RP3–RP4, 22% and 17% for RP3–RP7 and 16% and 0% for RP4–RP7. In general, the two-species SMC consumed the substrate more efficiently than the single-species cultures. The three-species SMC also showed a synergistic interaction (Fig. 3b), the overall hydrogen production of 79.5mL/g WSXadded being very close to the sum of the hydrogen production from the two-species SMC (three times higher than the expected hydrogen production from the single-species cultures). The three-species SMC consumed 18% of the xylose but no glucose. Thus, the WSX consumed was converted efficiently into hydrogen representing a H2 yield of 2.5mol H2/mol xylose. In spite of this, there was low consumption of the WSX, which is attributed to the lack of ligninolytic strains for lignin degradation as occur in natural consortia [5]. Fig. 4 A and B shows the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the native WS loaded to the H2 reactors and that from the three-species SMC, respectively. Contents in the hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose fractions remained almost unchanged after the growth of the enterococcal species. Because native xylan presents covalent bonds with lignin [36], the SMC must break down these bonds to access the whole hemicellulose fraction. The isolates tested here were not able to degrade all of the WSX, such that ligninolytic strains could perform the hemicellulose release. In this study, three epiphytic bacteria of wheat straw produced cooperatively hydrogen from the native xylan. These strains belong to the genus Enterococcus, a type of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These isolates were obtained from the same environment, a natural fermentation in which such microflora already existed. It is possible that these enterococci evolved together by dividing the shared resources to avoid the competition for them. From the tested pairwise cultures, one negative interaction was observed, but the three-species SMC maintained a cooperative interaction in which the overall hydrogen production increased. Previous studies reported to enterococci widely distributed as part of the epiphytic microflora of various forage plants [30], in the gastrointestinal microflora of warm-blooded animals, including humans [38], and they are also frequently found in many types of foods [39]. Certain plant-associated enterococci from corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and forage crops are Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus hirae [40]. LAB performs hetero-, homo-, or mixed fermentation. They are responsible for silage fermentation transforming water-soluble carbohydrates into gas and organic acids that decrease the pH of silage [41]. Enterococcus has a wide range of metabolic activities, and typically this genus produces lactic and acetic acids in silage fermentation [40]. For example, E. faecium enhances the degradability, fermentation rate, and organic acid production from various forages [42]. Some species of Enterococcus were described with xylanolytic activity [43] and cellulolytic activity [44]. Relevance of Enterococcus was shown as the most abundant species in a biogas-producing microbial community [45]. Notably, Enterococcus gallinarum and E. saccharolyticus were part of an H2-producing consortium obtained from a cattle feedlot manure composting plant fed cellobiose [10]. An analysis of the genome of Enterococcus [46] demonstrates the presence of several xylanolytic genes: endoxylanase (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase), beta-xylosidase (xylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase), arabinosidase (xylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase), acetyl xylan esterase, and arabinofuranosidase (alpha-n-arabinofuranosidase). A recent work highlighted the significance of LAB concerning their exploitation in biorefineries [47]. This work demonstrates that hemicellulosic carbohydrates were converted into hydrogen by a synthetic microbial consortium of three Enterococcus species with a consolidated bioprocessing approach—i.e., the lignocellulosic substrate was hydrolyzed and fermented in a single unit by the SMC. There would be several advantages of using Enterococcus in scaled reactors: facultative anaerobes obviate the need for reducing agents or additional O2-consuming strains, which in turn consume substrate; this metabolically diverse bacterial group degrades complex and simple sugars; bacteriocin limit the growth of other strains that compete for the same substrate; such genus is generally recognized safe."
11,Acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production from wheat straw enriched in cellulose,"3.2 Acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production from wheat straw enriched in cellulose Here, a biorefinery concept of a consolidated two-stage bioprocessing scheme is proposed. The first stage produces hydrogen from the xylan fraction and the second stage produces solvents from the cellulose fraction. However, the three-species SMC – with the highest hydrogen production, had a poor performance in consuming the xylan fraction and the lignin fraction remained unchanged. Because of that, a mixture of WS fermented by two H2-producing natural microflora (from anaerobic sludge and epiphytic microflora) fed to the acetobutilic fermentation (Fig. 1). The enterococcal species in the first stage were isolated from this epiphytic microflora. These H2-producing natural microflora contained different populations of bacteria and fungi (visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy) acting on the WS reducing the content of hemicellulose between 87% and 96%, cellulose between 37% and 52% and of lignin between 18% and 20% [5]. Fig. 4C shows the FTIR spectrum of the fermented WS used as substrate for the ABE reactors. In comparison with the native WS, the FTIR analysis confirms a decrease in the content of lignin shown by the reduction of peaks at 1595cm−1 and 1510cm−1 associated with lignin. The hemicellulose in the mixture of such fermented WS was partially reduced, indicated by the reduction of peak at 1248cm−1 but not at 1720cm−1. The cellulose fraction in this fermented WS was partially reduced since the peak at 896cm−1 – indicative of the β-glycosidic linkages between the glucose units – was similar to that in the native WS. Additionally, those microorganisms in the natural microflora of the H2 reactors preferably consumed the fraction of amorphous cellulose, as indicated by an increase in the crystallinity index (from 0.810 to 1.22 determined by FTIR and from 31.3% to 51.4% determined by XRD, Fig. 5 ). Thus, the fermented WS loaded to the ABE reactors was enriched in cellulose by the partial reduction of the hemicellulose and lignin fractions. The H2-producing reactors as first stage worked as a biological pretreatment that reduced lignin and five-carbon sugars without using chemicals or producing fermentation inhibitors. The partially refined WS provided cellulose to a second two-species SMC integrated by C. beijerinckii ATCC 10132 (Cb) with C. cellulovorans ATCC 35296 (Cc). Single-species cultures grew on wheat straw enriched in cellulose (WSC) as control treatments (Fig. 3c). Cb produced a negligible amount of solvents (0.87g/L of ethanol), and Cc generated 0.6g/L of ethanol and acetic and butyric acids (2.27 and 0.86g/L, respectively). The single-species cultures performed poorly on WSC, and butanol production was not detected. In the two-species SMC, organic acids were produced in the first days. Then, solvents peaked at 23.3g/L by day 5 (3.7g/L ethanol, 14.2g/L butanol, and 5.4g/L acetone, Fig. 3d). From days 5 to 7, the ABE concentration declined from 23.3 to 14.9g/L due to inhibition by the product, a phenomenon reported earlier [48]. According to previous observations, Cc provides significant amounts of simple sugars to Cb to improve butanol production [20]. In this study, biologically pretreated wheat straw enriched with cellulose yielded 14.2g/L of butanol in 5days, similar titer have been reported from glucose [49] and with other strains [50,51]. ABE fermentation with simple sugars regularly takes <72h to reach a high butanol titer [49,51]. With insoluble substrates, ABE fermentation times rise to 80–240h [52,20]. The SMC of Cb–Cc obtained a high butanol titer in 120h using biologically pretreated WS enriched in cellulose. This substrate did not contain fermentation inhibitors, and the cellulose microfibrils were exposed, allowing Cc to degrade it efficiently. The FTIR spectrum of the spent WS from the two-species SMC of Clostridium (Fig. 4D) revealed that peaks at 1735−1 and 1249cm−1 associated with hemicellulose almost disappeared in comparison with the fed WS (Fig. 4C). Peaks associated with lignin at 1595cm−1 and 1510cm−1 remained unchanged due to the lack of ligninolytic activity in Clostridium. The XRD spectrum of the spent WS from the ABE reactor indicated an increase in the cellulose crystallinity from 51.4% to 60% which means that the two-species SMC of Clostridium preferably consumed the amorphous fraction of cellulose. Two synthetic microbial consortia produced hydrogen and solvents in a consolidated two-stage bioprocessing scheme. In the first reactor, a three-species SMC integrated by epiphytic species of Enterococcus produced hydrogen from WS xylose. The estimated hydrogen yield is remarkable in comparison with other studies using wheat straw as substrate (Table 1 ). The synergistic interaction between the epiphytic species of Enterococcus responsible for the hydrogen production and because they evolved together to consume efficiently this complex substrate could be reasons of such yield. However, because the substrate consumption was low (<20%), we hypothesize that complementary strains must join the SMC to degrade lignin and disintegrate completely the hemicellulose-lignin matrix. Fungal populations, such as those visualized in natural consortia [5], could perform this task, improving the WS xylose consumption. The first stage has two purposes: to produce biohydrogen from the hemicellulose fraction and to pretreat the lignocellulosic substrate, leaving the cellulose fraction exposed. In the second reactor, a two-species SMC with C. beijerinckii with C. cellulovorans converted the WS enriched in cellulose to solvents. The butanol titer was high, and the ABE yield was similar to other studies using WS (Table 1). However, contrary to those previous processes, here the WS was enriched in cellulose by using natural microbial consortia responsible for the hydrogen production from the xylan fraction as well as the lignin degradation. The challenge remains, imitate these microbial activities by the synthetic microbial consortium in the first stage. Also, the time of the ABE fermentation process still is high (120h). An economic evaluation considering these operational conditions could give information about the impact on the total production cost. This configuration can be used to design a two-stage biorefinery for hydrogen and solvent production using five-carbon and six-carbon sugars, respectively. This scheme does not require dedicated units for chemical pretreatment, enzyme production and cellulose saccharification."
12,Conclusions,"Two synthetic microbial consortia produced hydrogen and solvents (acetone–butanol–ethanol) from the xylose and cellulose fractions of native wheat straw, respectively. A synthetic microbial consortium of three epiphytic species of Enterococcus attained a maximum hydrogen production of 79.54mL H2 per gram of wheat straw xylose. A second synthetic microbial consortium of C. beijerinckii with C. cellulovorans produced 23.3g/L of solvents (3.7g/L ethanol, 14.2g/L butanol, and 5.4g/L acetone) from the biologically pretreated wheat straw enriched in cellulose in 5days. Both stages operated as consolidated bioprocesses, where hydrolytic enzyme production, polysaccharide hydrolysis, and fermentation occurred simultaneously."
