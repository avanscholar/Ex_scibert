0,Introduction,"Diminishing fossil resources, in combination with environmental concerns related to reducing atmospheric pollution and global greenhouse gas emissions, dictate the development of alternative renewable sources and new technologies for the production of fuels and chemicals. In this regard, conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is of special interest, since it is widely available and is the only carbon containing renewable feedstock [1]. However, biomass is highly oxygenated and highly functionalized, and therefore, the reactive oxygenated organic compounds should be selectively deoxygenated at high yields [1]. This can be achieved by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), which removes oxygen at a moderate temperature usually with high-pressure hydrogen without loss of carbon atoms [2]. Biomass derived furfural, produced by acidic dehydration of hemicelluloses, is an important intermediate for biofuels and chemicals [3]. Furfural is also a key oxygenated compound commonly found in bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of biomass [4,5]. In order to improve stability, boiling point range, and water solubility, the contained unsaturated compounds (like aldehydes) of bio-oil should be reduced [5,6]. Selective hydrogenolysis of furfural is a vital way to transform it into more valuable products, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methyl furan (MF), or cyclopentanone [7,8]. Among various products, MF is attractive due to its intrinsically high research octane number and its potential use for chemicals, e.g., by converting it to toluene [9–13]. Moreover, one of its two reactive α-positions is protected by an unreactive methyl group, which could reduce side reactions (i.e., overalkylation) [14]. In chemical industry, MF is used for the synthesis of crysanthemate pesticides, perfume intermediates and chloroquine lateral chains in medical intermediates [15]. Due to its high vapor pressure, furfural hydrogenation can take place efficiently both in the gas and the liquid phase and the most widely studied catalysts are Pt [7,16], Pd [17], Ru [8,16] and Cu [17] supported on carbon, alumina, or silica [4,5,7,8,16,18]. Efforts have been made to improve catalytic activity and selectivity either via catalyst doping with various additives, such as Cu on Ni/MgAlO [19] or Mo on Co/B [20] catalysts, or by using bimetallic systems, such as Sn–Pt [21], Sn–Ni [21], Pt–Ge [22] and Pt–Sn [22] supported on SiO2. The increased activity has been attributed either to an increase of metal electron density or the creation of new active sites, which both favor the hydrogenation of the CO group and eliminate undesirable reactions, such as decarbonylation and ring opening [21,22]. Liquid phase chemistry is probably preferred for compatibility with the upstream production of furfural [23,24]. Previous liquid phase hydrogenation studies showed that catalytic activity and especially product distribution are mainly affected by the solvent [7,8] and to a less extent by the nature of the catalyst and the initial concentration of furfural [16]. In particular, aqueous solvents lead to the production of cyclopentanol and cyclopentanone, whereas organic solvents, such as polar alcohols, produce mainly FA, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and methyl furan [7,8,16]. The formation of FA in liquid phase furfural hydrogenation has extensively been reported on many catalysts (Ru/C [8], Pt/C [7], Pt–Sn/SiO2 [18,21], Rh–Sn/SiO2 [21], Ni–Sn/SiO2 [21], Pt–Ge/SiO2 [22], MoNiB/γ-Al2O3 [5], Ce–Ni–B [25], Fe–Ni–B [26], Mo–Co–B [20], Co–Ni–B [27], Ir/TiO2 [28]) and/or solvents (n-butanol [7,8], methyltetrahydrofuran [8], 2-propanol [18,21,22], n-heptane [18], ethanol [18,20,25–27], methanol [5], n-decanol [7], tetrahydrofuran [7], n-heptane-EtOH [28]). Ordomsky et al. [8] found that on Ru/C furfural hydrogenation proceeds initially with the formation of FA, which, depending on the solvent, is further converted to THFA and/or MF (with a maximum selectivity of 19%). On the other hand, Villaverde et al. [29] recently found that FA selectivity is not influenced either by the initial furfural concentration or the temperature, and is always 100% using 2-propanol as the solvent over Cu-based catalysts. Contrary to the widely reported FA formation, only a few studies have produced MF (Table 1 ) [7,8,16,19,30–32]. Among these studies, only Yan et al. [31] reported recently a moderate yield of 51% over a Cu–Fe catalyst at temperatures as high as 220°C with the yield in other studies being low. Although no reference related to catalyst stability has been made, the authors state that such high temperatures would increase the energy cost as well as coke formation, via thermal polymerization of furfural [31]. In most of the studies reported so far, high-pressure H2 has been used. However, use of molecular hydrogen is not entirely green and is plagued by a number of problems related to hydrogen availability in remote locations, high compression cost, complex trickle bed reactor design, dilution, low solubility, safety, transportation, storage, and restrictions in operating parameters. These aspects increase the cost and complexity of the process [33,34]. An alternative route for the conversion of furfural to MF could entail catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), in which a hydrogen donor is used as a hydrogen source, instead of molecular H2. Among hydrogen donors, alcohols are attractive, since they are non-corrosive, can act both as reactants and solvents, can be produced sustainably from biomass (e.g., ethanol, butanol), and their dehydrogenation products (aldehydes or ketones) can readily be separated from the products and regenerated under mild-conditions using inexpensive base metal catalysts at moderate hydrogen pressures or used as chemicals [35–37]. In the present study the production of MF through CTH of furfural has been investigated in the liquid phase over Ru/C catalyst, in an attempt to identify the key operating parameters that determine catalytic activity and selectivity. Mechanistic aspects of the reaction are investigated by following the evolution of reaction intermediates and final products in the liquid phase, and possible pathways are presented."
1,Experimental,
2,Reactor and procedures,"2.1 Reactor and procedures CTH of furfural has been carried out in a stainless steel 100ml Parr batch reactor heated in a temperature-controlled oil bath on a digital stirring hot plate. In a typical experiment, 24mL of a 2-propanol solution of furfural (1wt.%) and 0.1g of 5wt.% Ru/C (Sigma–Aldrich) were added to the reactor, sealed under N2 pressure (2.04MPa) and heated to the reaction temperature. The reaction was stopped at desired times, the reactor was cool down in an ice bath and the suspension was collected, filtered, stored in sealed vials and analyzed. Prior to each experiment, Ru/C catalyst was treated for 3h at 300°C in H2 flow of 40cc/min followed by oxidation for 3h at 130°C in 5% O2/He flow of 40cc/min. As we discuss later, this mild calcination is important for catalyst performance."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods Identification of the liquids products was made using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Shimadzu QP2010 Plus) system. The GC (Shimadzu GC2010) is equipped with an HP-INNOWax capillary column (30m×0.25mm id×0.50μm film thickness) and interfaced directly to the MS (Shimadzu QP2010 Plus), which was used as a detector. Identification of the GC/MS spectral features was accomplished using a built-in library. Quantification of the liquids products was made using a gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A), equipped with an HP-INNOWax capillary column (30m×0.25mm id×0.5μm film thickness) and an FID detector. The GC operated with He as the carrier gas. Response factors were determined using self-prepared solutions of known concentration. Ethers were identified using a NMR spectrometer (Bruker AV400), equipped with a cryogenic QNP (1H, 13C, 19F, and 31P) probe. Prior to analysis, the product mixture, containing ethers, was dried using a rotary evaporator followed by dilution in deuterated DMSO. Since the ether produced was not commercially available, it was quantified by synthesizing it. For this purpose, furfural hydrogenation via the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reaction and etherification was carried out using an acid catalyst (Sn-Beta zeolite), leading to production and isolation of the ether as the main product, analogous to our recent work [37]. Its retention time and molecular structure have been confirmed with gas chromatography and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. The ether response factor of self-prepared containing ether solutions was then determined. Furfural conversion is defined as the moles of furfural reacted divided by the initial moles of furfural loaded in the reactor. Product yield is defined as the moles of each product containing carbon over the initial moles of furfural, multiplied with a scaling factor to account for possible differences in the number of carbon atoms (e.g., 4/5 for furan)."
4,TPR experiments,"2.3 TPR experiments Hydrogen-Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out using an Altamira AM-200ip instrument. In a typical experiment, 70mg of the catalyst was placed in a U-tube quartz reactor and reduced at 300°C with a flowing 50% H2/He mixture (30cm3/min) for 3h, followed by treatment at 130°C with a flowing 5% O2/He mixture (30cm3/min) for 3h. The sample was then cooled at room temperature and TPR experiments were carried out by switching the feed composition from He to 10% H2/Ar (30cm3/min), maintaining it at 25°C for 5min, and then heating linearly (β =10°C/min) to 700°C. Hydrogen consumption was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of reaction temperature on product distribution,"3.1 Effect of reaction temperature on product distribution The effect of reaction temperature, in the range of 120–200°C, on catalytic activity is presented in Fig. 1A. Furfural conversion increases from 30% to 95% with increasing temperature. The main hydrogenolysis products detected are FA and MF. The FA alcohol yield is 10–12% up to 170°C and then decreases to 5% with further increase in temperature. The yield of MF increases progressively with increasing reaction temperature and reaches 50% at 195°C. Although, high yield to FA is commonplace [5,7,8,18,20–22,25–29], only a few studies report high yields of MF from hydrogenolysis of furfural [7,8,16,19,30,31]. Hronec et al. [7] reported MF yields of 40.4 and 23.2% using n-butanol and n-decanol as solvents, respectively, at 175°C over Pt/C catalysts. In both cases, the FA yield was higher than that of MF, whereas furfural conversion was higher than 94%. It is only recently that a moderate MF yield of 51% was observed in octane solvent at 220°C over a Cu–Fe catalyst [31]. The formation of small yields of furan (FU), <5%, indicates that furfural decarbonylation occurs in parallel to the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group, in accordance with previous studies over Pd and Ni/SiO2 catalysts [6,17,38,39] but it is a dominant path under our conditions and catalyst. It has been proposed that decarbonylation is enhanced under conditions that favor the formation of acyl species, which acts as a precursor to furan and CO [6]. Production of traces of THFA (yields <1%) indicates that the hydrogenation of the furan ring is not favored under our experimental conditions. This is in agreement with previous studies where THFA was always detected as a secondary product, exhibiting selectivities lower than 10–15% [7,8,16]. The formation of the furan,2-(2-furanylmethyl)-5-methyl (compound 2; a dimer shown in Fig. 2 ) is possibly taking place either via FA dimerization, possibly through acid catalyzed dehydration [40–42] and/or via hydroxyalkylation/alkylation of MF [43]. The yield of the latter compound increases with increasing temperature, reaching 10% at 180°C (Fig. 1A). Experiments conducted using MF as reactant showed no dimer formation, indicating that MF alkylation is not taking place under CTH of furfural. On the other hand, as it will be discussed below, the dimer production occurs when starting from FA. FA dimerization has been proposed to proceed through condensation of a hydroxyl group of one furan ring with the C5-hydrogen of another, resulting in the above mentioned dimer, in which the furan rings are connected by a methylene group [42]. Another possible route for dimer formation is through interaction of FA with MF. Experiments conducted using 1% FA–1% MF mixture as reactant showed the production of this dimer, exhibiting higher yields than that obtained using solely FA, under otherwise identical reaction conditions. However, the dimer yield is always lower than 10% and therefore, FA dimerization could not be excluded. Among the products detected, the 2-(isopropoxy)methyl furan (compound 1; an ether shown in Fig. 2), seems to strongly influence the MF yield. The ether yield goes through a maximum of 32% at 170°C, which is almost equal to that of MF (Fig. 1A). This ether forms from the etherification of isopropanol with FA and has previously been observed under conditions of furfural hydrogenation over Pt, Rh, and Ni based catalysts [18,21]. The corresponding ether originating from 1-butanol solvent has also been reported by Ordomsky et al. [8] over Ru/C catalysts. That work led to an almost full conversion of furfural with only 37% selectivity to FA, THFA and MF. Similarly, Godwa et al. [30] observed the formation of 2-(diethoxymethyl) furan (14% yield) under conditions of furfural hydrogenation using ethanol solvent and Ru based catalyst. A similar side reaction leading to the hemiacetal by-product was observed in ethanol solvent/furfural mixtures on Ir/TiO2 [28]. The latter reaction was enhanced at the expense of FA as the catalyst surface acidity increased. The hydrogen required for furfural hydrogenation is produced in situ via the 2-propanol dehydrogenation reaction. Fig. 1B shows the 2-propanol conversion and product distribution vs. temperature. It is observed that the 2-propanol conversion increases from 0.1% to 1.5% with increasing temperature, with acetone yield reaching ∼1% at 180–195°C. Based on the reaction stoichiometry, 2-propanol dehydrogenation produces equivalent amounts of H2, which in turn are utilized in the upgrading of furfural. In addition to acetone, smaller amounts of diisopropylether (<0.3%) are also produced via 2-propanol etherification. Traces of propane are due to hydrogenation of propylene produced through 2-propanol dehydration. The yield of the latter products (propylene, propane) increases above 170°C, rationalizing the slight decrease of acetone yield at 195°C. The neat 2-propanol reaction over Ru/C catalyst has also been investigated to determine the amount of H2 gas that can be produced under the same reaction conditions and provide insights into the hydrogenation mechanism of furfural. It was found (Fig. S6) that in the absence of furfural, 2-propanol is readily converted into acetone (and equivalent amounts of H2) along with diisopropyl ether (<5%) and small amounts of propane (<2%). 2-Propanol conversion and acetone yield reaches 28% and 20%, respectively, at 180°C. Results provide evidence that 2-propanol can dehydrogenate under the CTH of furfural. As a result, the hydrogenation of the CHO group of furfural may occur from the hydrogen produced from the dehydrogenation of the alcohol on metallic Ru. An alternate path entails the MPV interhydride transfer reaction between the carbonyl group CO of the furfural and the OH group of the 2-propanol, which is known to occur on Lewis acid catalysts [37,44,45]. Under our reaction conditions, RuO2 is an effective MPV catalyst of the CHO group [57] and thus, both hydrogenation mechanisms can be at play. The competitive adsorption of furfural may reduce the ability of alcohol to supply hydrogen via direct metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of the 2-pronanol and hydrogenation of CHO. As a result, further studies are needed to understand the hydrogenation mechanism of CHO. Upon production of FA, the hydrogenolysis of CH2OH to CH3 should entail atomic hydrogen produced from 2-propanol dehydrogenation. Metal catalyzed hydrogen production is further corroborated from the molar balance of hydrogen (hydrogen produced from alcohol and utilized in hydrogenating products). We estimate no significant accumulation of hydrogen under many conditions except at long times and high temperatures. Interestingly, when 2-propanol is converted during CTH of furfural, the acetone yield is significantly lower compared to that from pure 2-propanol. This is in agreement with our previous study of CTH of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) [37]. It is possible that 2-propanol and furfural compete for active sites, resulting in lower rates of 2-propanol dehydrogenation during CTH of furfural compared to neat conditions. This hypothesis is supported from density functional theory periodic slab calculations in VASP that show that the adsorption energy (in eV) varies as follows: furfural (−2.4)>FA (−1.8)>MF (−1.6)>furan (−1.6)>acetone (−1.1)>2-propanol (−1.0). Overall, 2-propanol dehydrogenation is faster than its etherification and supplies the necessary hydrogen to drive the furfural upgrade. The contribution of protons from 2-propanol and the acid sites of carbon support (due to COOH groups) on the reaction chemistry was determined by investigating the reaction without any catalyst and over activated carbon, respectively. As it can be seen in Table S1 (Supplemental Information (SI)), furfural shows very little reactivity (6.3% conversion almost completely toward FA) in solution (without Ru/C catalyst or activated carbon), indicating that the alcohol protons do not play an active role on transfer hydrogenation. Furthermore, the reaction of furfural over activated carbon (SI, Table S1) shows 34.5% conversion with 15% yields of hydrogenated products (mostly FA) and 6.2% yield of the ether (compound 1). A similar experiment was conducted using FA as a reactant and results showed that FA is mainly etherified with 2-propanol on the surface of the carbon support, exhibiting a conversion of 41% with a 32% yield of compound 1 and a 2% yield of MF. Comparison with the results obtained using furfural as a reactant (Table S1) indicates that the rate of furfuryl alcohol hydrogenolysis is higher, in agreement with the results discussed below. Results suggest that some partial hydrogenation of furfural or FA is possible on the carbon. However, complete hydrogenolysis of furfural or FA to MF is not feasible without Ru under the same reaction conditions. The acid functional groups on activated carbon are most probably responsible for the observed etherification. Results of neat 2-propanol conversion over carbon support (Table S1) show that 2-propanol dehydrogenation activity is slightly higher in the absence of furfural (2-propanol conversion 0.62%; acetone yield 0.56%), but the effect is profound in the case of Ru/C catalyst. This can be clearly seen in Fig. S6, where the neat 2-propanol conversion and product yields are presented for Ru/C and activated carbon at 180°C. 2-Propanol conversion and acetone yield (and consequently H2 yield) increases from 0.6% to 28% and from 0.56% to 20% with the addition of Ru on the carbon support. Clearly, 2-propanol dehydrogenation on the carbon support is not important for the conversion of furfural in Ru/C catalyst."
7,Effect of reaction time and reactant on product distribution,"3.2 Effect of reaction time and reactant on product distribution The effect of reaction time on catalytic activity and product distribution over Ru/C catalyst has been investigated at 160°C (Fig. 3A). Furfural conversion and MF yield increase with reaction time, reaching 91% and 50%, respectively, after 16h. The yield of the ether (compound 1) increases up to 32% at ∼10h and then decreases, indicating that etherification is a reversible reaction and the ether is converted back to FA and eventually to MF. The FA yield remains ∼10–12% over the entire time range examined. FU, THFA as well as compound 2 are also detected, but their yields are low at all times, indicating that these products do not form fast enough. In order to understand the reaction network, hydrogenolysis experiments have been conducted using FA as the reactant. FA hydrogenolysis (Fig. 3B) leads to the same products as in furfural hydrogenolysis (Fig. 3A). The main difference is that the production of both MF and the ether (compound 1) takes place faster when FA is the reactant. In particular, 90% conversion of FA to MF and the ether is reached in less than 3h, with yields of 44% and 38%, respectively. The higher rate of FA hydrogenolysis results in lower production of THFA, FU as well as the dimer (compound 2) at all times compared to that from furfural (Fig. 3A). FA is fully converted in 0.5h at 160°C, whereas the conversion of furfural reaches 100% after 5h of reaction. Higher hydrogenolysis rates of FA compared to furfural have previously been reported over Ru/C in aqueous phase experiments [8]. Co-feeding 0.5% (by weight) furfural to FA showed that the rate of MF production decreases. This may indicate that furfural blocks the active sites resulting in lower rates of 2-propanol dehydrogenation and/or lower adsorption rate of furfuryl alcohol and consequently, in lower furfural hydrogenation activity. A main point from these experiments (as well as the transients) is the FA is an intermediate in the conversion of furfural to MF and the hydrogenation of furfural to FA appears to be controlling the overall rate of furfural conversion. Results of Fig. 3 indicate that both the ether and dimer compounds 1 and 2 originate from FA. In order to exclude the possibility of their production from any of the other detected-products, we conducted similar experiments using MF or FU as reactants. Results (not presented) showed that neither compound 1 or 2 forms. MF is hydrogenated to methyltetrahydrofuran and FU is hydrogenated to tetrahydrofuran and dihydrofurans, in agreement with previous studies [1,3,15,16,21]. These products are not formed when starting from furfural or FA, indicating that the oxygenated furan compounds (furfural and FA) prevent MF and FU from hydrogenation by blocking sites. Similar time dependent experiments of furfural hydrogenolysis have also been conducted at 140 and 180°C (Figs. S1 and S2). At higher temperatures, the maximum of 2-(isopropoxy)methyl furan yield occurs at lower reaction times. This can clearly be seen in Fig. S3, where the yield of the ether (compound 1) is shown as a function of time (Fig. S3A) and temperature (Fig. S3B). By increasing reaction time or reaction temperature, the ether yield reaches a maximum at ∼30–35%, as also observed in Figs. S1 and S3. The decrease in ether yield at long times and/or high temperatures are accompanied by an increase of MF yield. As discussed above, during CTH, 2-propanol is converted into stoichiometric amounts of acetone and H2, where hydrogen is in turn utilized in furfural hydrogenolysis. Therefore, comparison of acetone yield with that of the ether (compound 1) could provide an interesting correlation between 2-propanol dehydrogenation and 2-propanol etherification activity. Fig. 4A shows the yield of 2-(isopropoxy)methyl furan vs. the acetone yield over a wide range of reaction times and temperatures. It is observed that at low acetone yields, the ether formation increases linearly with increasing acetone yield, indicating that the production of acetone correlates with that of FA that is etherified in part as is being produced. At longer times and/or higher temperatures, above the maximum ether yield of ∼30–35%, the ether yield declines with increasing acetone yield. On the other hand, the MF yield increases linearly with increasing acetone yield (Fig. 4B), i.e., the furfural hydrogenolysis to MF is strongly affected by the 2-propanol dehydrogenation at all reaction times and/or temperatures investigated. Our results provide evidence that etherification is a reversible reaction where at long times and/or high temperatures, the ether converts back into FA that is further transformed into MF. In order to assess this, the ratio of concentrations of species participating in the etherification reaction was computed as a function of time. Results (Fig. S5) show that the ratio of concentrations is approximately constant at reaction times where the ether formation starts decreasing, i.e., etherification reaction is in equilibrium at times past the maximum. The hydrogen efficiency was defined as the molar ratio of H2 consumed to produce MF or useful products per H2 consumed to reaction products. The results obtained as a function of time at different reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. S7. The fraction of H2 utilized for MF production (Fig. S7A) or all valuable products (Fig. S7B), which can end up to MF, varies between 40% and 80% and is ∼90%, respectively. The latter fraction is high as expected because there is a low fraction of dimer produced and little ring hydrogenation, i.e., CTH delivers hydrogen very efficiently. Optimum results have been obtained after 10h of reaction at 180°C, where furfural conversion and MF yield reach 95% and 61%, respectively (Table 1, Fig. S2). It should be mentioned that the maximum MF yield reported before is 51% after 14h of reaction at 220°C over Cu–Fe catalysts, whereas the corresponding value at 180°C was only ∼10% [31]. Moreover, previous works employed high-pressure molecular hydrogen. Therefore, the 61% yield of the present study is not only higher compared to previous results but also avoids the need of external H2 supply. Importantly, CTH is extendible to other primary and secondary alcohols (not shown), including ethanol and butanol, which can be produced sustainably (via fermentation) from biomass. The use of external hydrogen on furfural hydrogenolysis was examined at 180°C for 5h over Ru/C catalyst, where the reactor was pressurized with a mixture of 150psi H2-150psi N2. It was found that furfural is completely converted toward 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and neither MF nor FA production was observed. While an extensive study of external H2 addition is beyond the scope of this paper, our results indicate that the use of external hydrogen leads to fast ring hydrogenation and CTH can be superior to traditional external H2-based HDO for MF production."
8,Catalyst stability and the role of catalyst pretreatment,"3.3 Catalyst stability and the role of catalyst pretreatment Catalyst stability has been examined by conducting catalyst recycling experiments. The catalyst was recovered after reaction by filtration and reused after drying at 100°C (denoted as Spent Catalyst). Results are summarized in Fig. 5A. On the spent catalyst, the furfural conversion and MF yield decrease from 88% to 75% and from 44% to 31%, respectively. The decrease of MF yield is accompanied by an increase of FA yield from 5% to 16%, whereas the yields of the other detected-products do not vary significantly. Our results demonstrate that although the furfural conversion over the spent catalyst does not decrease significantly, FA production increases at the expense of MF, i.e., the selectivity to MF decreases upon catalyst use. Importantly, the initial catalytic activity and product distribution are completely recovered after catalyst regeneration (Regenerated Catalyst) following the same pretreatment used for the fresh catalyst (reduction for 3h at 300°C in H2 flow followed by oxidation for 3h at 130°C in 5% O2/He flow), i.e., the Ru/C catalyst deactivation is reversible, and the catalyst is recyclable after regeneration. Similar recovery of catalytic activity has been reported by Yan et al. [46] over Cu–Cr catalysts. The authors attributed the catalyst deactivation to carbon deposition on the catalyst, which is removed upon calcination. Carbon deposition could also happen here, via formation of high molecular weight byproducts. However, our carbon material balance in the liquid products is almost complete even for the spent catalyst and our calcination procedure is too mild. Given that the support is carbon, we cannot check carbon deposition beyond closing the material balance. An alternate mechanism of deactivation may entail change of active catalyst sites under reaction conditions. In order to further investigate this, experiments were conducted over a fresh Ru/C catalyst that was only reduced for 3h at 300°C in H2 flow, i.e., without the mild oxidation, called Fresh Red catalyst (Fig. 5B). After 5h of reaction at 180°C, the furfural conversion of this fresh pretreated catalyst reaches 69%, whereas the yields of the main products were 12% FA, 23% MF, and 26% ether (compound 1). The performance of the spent catalyst after drying at 100°C (denoted as Spent Catalyst) is within error from the fresh pretreated (Fresh Red) catalyst. This is also the case for the Regenerated Catalyst following the same pretreatment used for the fresh catalyst (reduction for 3h at 300°C in H2 flow). These results indicate that the partial deactivation of the catalyst in Fig. 5A is not due to carbon deposit under our conditions. Comparison of the two fresh but differently pretreated catalysts (Fig. 5A and B) demonstrates that the catalyst subjected to mild oxidation exhibits higher furfural conversion and MF yield, lower FA yield, and more or less the same yields for the rest of the detected products. Interestingly, the results of Fig. 5B are similar to those obtained on the spent catalyst of Fig. 5A, providing evidence that the Ru/C catalyst is being reduced during CTH of furfural. We believe that this reduction of the catalyst is responsible for the partial deactivation and change in selectivity. Previous studies showed that hydrogenation of RuO x species takes place at 100–200°C [47–50]. Therefore, it is possible that some of the hydrogen produced from 2-propanol dehydrogenation is consumed for the reduction of ruthenium oxide species. In order to provide further evidence for the change in catalyst site, the catalysts were investigated using H2-TPR. The profiles obtained from the fresh Red-Oxid Ru/C catalyst (following the same pretreatments used prior to catalytic performance experiments), its spent version, and reduced catalyst (Red) are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that in the case of Red-Oxid Ru/C catalyst (trace a), three consumption features of hydrogen are present: a low-temperature (LT) peak located at 92°C, accompanied by a smaller medium temperature (MT) peak at 177°C, both due to reduction of ruthenium oxide species [37,51–54], and a high-temperature broad feature evolving at temperatures above 200°C, with a maximum at ca. 490°C, which can be assigned to the reduction of the surface functional groups of the carbon support [37,51,55]. Previous studies conducted over supported Ru catalysts have shown that oxidation of dispersed Ru crystallites results in the formation of various ruthenium oxides [56], including RuO2, RuO3, and RuO4, with these species varying with increasing oxidation temperature. A similar TPR profile with that of Fig. 6 (trace a) has been previously obtained over Ru/SiO2 catalysts [52]. The authors assigned the peak detected at 110°C to partial reduction of Ru (III) to Ru (II), and that at 160–170°C to reduction of Ru (II) to Ru (I) or Ru0. However, ruthenium crystallite size also affects the reduction temperature. Highly dispersed RuO x species are reduced at lower temperatures, whereas reduction of well-crystallized RuO x occurs at higher temperature [51]. Based on the above discussion, it may be argued that pretreatment of Ru/C catalyst under a flowing 5% O2/He mixture at 130°C prior to the TPR experiments, results in the formation of RuO x species, which participate in the reaction mechanism of CTH of furfural. The formation of RuO2 species on the catalyst surface has been confirmed in our recent work by XPS and EXAFS spectroscopy [57]. The TPR profile obtained from the prereduced (Red) Ru/C catalyst (Fig. 6, trace c) is characterized only by the HT consumption feature, indicating that reduction of the catalyst under a flowing 50% H2/He mixture at 300°C prior to the TPR experiments, resulted in the complete reduction of ruthenium oxide species to metallic ruthenium. A similar TPR experiment was conducted over the spent dried catalyst of Fig. 5A (red bars). Results (Fig. 6, trace b) showed that the LT peak shifts toward higher temperatures (from 86 to 126°C) compared to the Red-Oxid catalyst, whereas no MT peak appears, indicating that, during CTH of furfural, the population of ruthenium oxide species decreases. Results of Fig. 6 are in agreement with those of Fig. 5, providing evidence that the partial catalyst deactivation and variation of product distribution are taking place due to change of active catalyst sites under reaction conditions. Our results are in agreement with our previous study, where it was found that ruthenium oxide species are easily reduced in situ during the CTH of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [57]. Although furfural hydrogenolysis has extensively been studied over various metal supported catalysts, it has not been clear so far what the active sites are. Since control of dehydration (oxygen removal in the form of H2O) and hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen) sequences is critical for the hydrogenolysis of furfural, a catalyst with an optimum distribution of acid and metal sites is expected to be favorable for the production of MF. Results of Fig. 5 show that the catalyst subjected to reduction followed by a mild oxidation pretreatment exhibits higher activity and selectivity toward MF, compared to that a fully reduced catalyst (treated under H2 flow). It has been suggested that when the oxidation state of Ru is higher than zero, the Ru species may exhibit acidic sites [58,59]. Our results indicate the presence of both Lewis acid sites of RuO x and metallic Ru sites whose synergy results in the higher MF yield. In this context, we believe that accumulation of hydrogen or use of external H2 can reduce the catalyst faster and degrade the performance. Kobayashi et al. [60] proposed that the active species for the transfer hydrogenation of cellulose to sugar alcohol over Ru/C catalysts is a cationic Ru species, rather than Ru metal nanoparticles that are inactive for that reaction. The same group studied the cellulose hydrolysis to glucose over Ru/C catalysts, treated with H2 at 400°C followed by passivation by 10% O2/He at room temperature [58]. According to the authors the H2 pretreatment produces reactive Ru nanoparticles that are precursors to RuO2 species, formed during oxidation, which are considered as the active species for the reaction. In our previous study [57], we investigated the effect of catalyst pretreatment by conducting in situ H2 titrations of the catalysts calcined at different temperatures. Our results strongly support that mild oxidation (T <473K) generates a partially oxidized ruthenium surface, which is necessary for the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF. Results of the present study clearly verify our recent findings, indicating the coexistence of ruthenium oxide and metallic ruthenium, which is crucial for the production of reduced furans."
9,Conclusions,"We have performed the first study of catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of furfural to produce methyl furan (MF) in the liquid phase using a secondary alcohol (2-propanol) on Ru/C catalyst. Optimum results have been obtained after 10h of reaction at 180°C, with the highest than any previous published yield of 61%. We have shown that hydrogen is readily transferred from 2-propanol to the aldehyde group of furfural, producing furfuryl alcohol (FA) as an intermediate that undergoes hydrogenolysis to MF. The hydrogenation of the aldehyde group is slower in the overall reaction network. FA can dimerize to a small extent or etherified with 2-propanol probably on the carbon support. Etherification is enhanced at short reaction times and/or low temperatures, whereas longer reaction times and/or higher temperatures reverse the reaction from ether to FA and 2-propanol, leading eventually to MF. Very little decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation are seen. Our results indicate that partial calcination of the fresh catalyst is essential for the overall reaction since it is a combination of Ru oxide and Ru metal that is responsible for the high MF yield. During reaction, the Ru oxide is being partially reduced but the catalyst can completely be regenerated. We estimate negligible hydrogen accumulation under most conditions (except at long times and high temperatures), and we propose that this is an important trait of CTH that slows down the reduction of the catalyst resulting in high yield of MF."
