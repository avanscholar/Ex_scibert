0,Introduction,"Fatty alcohols are non-ionic surfactants widely used as emulsifiers, emollients and thickeners in alimentary and cosmetic industries [1]. Moreover, they can be substrates for the production of other surface-active materials, such as alkylamines and alkylsulfates. The current world production capacity of fatty alcohols reaches 3.35Mt/a, with an estimated global demand growth (2012–2017) of 3.2%/a [2]. Fatty alcohols are mainly produced through catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acids, methyl esters or wax esters. In traditional processes, the methyl esters are hydrogenated over Cu–Cr-based [3] catalysts with a high selectivity towards alcohols. However, due to low reactivity of the carboxyl group, elevated temperatures (200–300°C) and hydrogen pressures (20–30MPa) have to be applied. Moreover, chromium catalysts are not environmentally friendly due to a release of hazardous chromium compounds. Noble metal catalysts such as Ru or Pt were reported to be active in selective hydrogenation of fatty acids. Many kinds of Ru-based catalysts have been studied [4], from which bimetallic Ru–Sn/Al2O3 [5] shows the highest selectivity towards fatty alcohols (250°C; 5.6MPa) in methyl laurate hydrogenation. In addition, a change of the support in the Ru–Sn catalyst from Al2O3 to TiO2 increases the activity and selectivity which is ascribed to Ru–Ti metal–support interactions [6]. The same properties were observed with a Pt/TiO2 catalyst [7] as hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols was performed at relatively low temperatures (110–150°C) and hydrogen pressures (2MPa) with selectivity 90–93%. It is assumed that an enhanced activity is caused by the Ti3+ ion/oxygen vacancy on the metal–support interface, which interacts with the carbonyl oxygen and weakens CO bond, promoting hydrogenation of the carboxylic acid [6,7]. Rhenium catalysts were disclosed in the patent literature as being capable of hydrogenating carbonyl compounds to alcohols with high overall selectivity, without formation of ethers. Selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols was also studied over rhenium-based catalysts. Decanoic acid transformation has been performed over Re2O7 at 10MPa of hydrogen and 130°C, giving a low conversion and a moderate selectivity towards 1-decanol [8]. Moreover, it has been shown that an addition of OsO4 to form a bimetallic Re–Os [8] catalyst increases not only the rate but also the selectivity to 84%. Furthermore, Re and bimetallic Re–Sn deposited over ZrO2 and Al2O3 have been studied at 250°C and 5.6MPa of hydrogen pressure in the hydrogenation of oleic acid. The Re/Al2O3 catalyst afforded the highest selectivity to alcohols, reaching 58% [9]. In this work, Re/TiO2 was studied in the selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to 1-octadecanol, displaying high selectivity of 93% under mild reaction conditions. Unusual properties of Re allow a selective conversion of fatty acids suppressing the formation of by-products. Moreover, the catalyst can be tuned for the production of hydrocarbons."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Titania P-90 and perrhenic acid (assay 39.4%) were supplied by Nippon Aerosil and Johnson Matthey, respectively. The Re catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. An appropriate mass of the perrhenic acid solution was diluted with deionised water (18MΩ) of volume equal to the pore volume of the support. The solution was added to the support in three portions of equal volumes with stirring after each addition, until the solution was thoroughly mixed. The product was then dried at 120°C for 12h, followed by calcination at 500°C for 4h."
3,Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR),"2.2 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) Prior to the analysis, 50mg of non-reduced Re/TiO2 catalyst was kept in an oven at 100°C overnight. Temperature-programmed reduction was performed in an Autochem Micromeritics 2910 using 5% H2 in Ar. The temperature ramp was 10°C/min to 500°C."
4,Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD),"2.3 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) Temperature-programmed desorption was performed in an Autochem Micromeritics 2910. Ammonia and carbon dioxide were used for the determination of the acid and base sites, respectively. The sample was at first kept under a helium atmosphere at 400°C for 1h then cooled to 100°C, in the case of NH3 TPD, and 30°C, in the case of CO2 TPD. Afterwards, the adsorbate was introduced for 30min. Subsequently, the catalyst was flushed with an inert gas for 30min after which the analysis was started. The temperature ramp was 10°C/min up to 700°C for NH3 and 600°C for CO2 where the sample was kept for 1h. Before the adsorption, the Re/TiO2 catalyst was reduced in situ with hydrogen at 400°C for 2h."
5,CO chemisorption,2.4 CO chemisorption CO chemisorption was performed in an Autochem Micromeritics 2910. The Re/TiO2 catalyst was reduced in situ with hydrogen prior to the analysis at 400°C for 2h. The hydrogen excess was removed by flushing the catalyst with helium at reduction temperature for 30min. Pulse chemisorption was performed in a quartz glass reactor performed at 25°C and glass reactor submerged in a water bath for temperature control.
6,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM),2.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The rhenium particle-size distribution was measured by a JEM-1400 Plus Transmission Electron Microscope (voltage 120kV). The sample was reduced at 400°C for 2h before analysis. Histograms of the particle-size distribution were obtained by counting at least 100 particles on the micrographs for the sample.
7,Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP–OES),"2.6 Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP–OES) The Re content of the catalyst was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) using an Optical Atomic-Emission Spectrometer Optima 4300 DV. For the analysis of the Re content, the Re/TiO2 catalyst was dissolved in a microwave oven by an acid mixture (2ml H2SO4 – 96%+2ml H3PO4 – 85%+1ml HF – 40%+0.5ml HNO3 – 65%)."
8,Nitrogen physisorption,"2.7 Nitrogen physisorption The specific surface area of the fresh catalyst was measured by nitrogen physisorption using a Sorptometer 1900 (Carlo Erba instruments) apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the sample was degassed at 200°C for 3h. The specific surface area was calculated by BET equation."
9,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"2.8 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The Re/TiO2 catalyst was reduced at atmospheric pressure and at 0.5MPa in hydrogen. The catalyst was transported under acetone to a glove box where it was filtered and dried at room temperature in an inert atmosphere. The spent catalyst was transported after the reaction to the glove box submerged in reaction mixture. At inert atmosphere, the catalyst was washed with acetone and dried at room temperature. All catalysts were brought to the XPS equipment in sealed containers. During the insertion to the XPS equipment, the catalyst had less than 2-min contact with air. A Perkin–Elmer PHI 5400 spectrometer with a MgKα X-ray source operated at 14kV and 200W was used in the XPS analysis of the samples. The pass energy of the analyser was 17.9eV and the energy step 0.05eV. The binding energy calibration was based on the Ti 2p3/2 peak at 458.8eV. Fitting of the XPS data was performed after removal of Shirley background using Voigt profile. In the peak fitting procedure, the Re 4f5/2 and Re 4f7/2 intensity ratio was 0.75 and energy separation was 2.43eV. The sensitivity factors used in the quantitative analysis for O 1s, Ti 2p3/2 , Re 4f and C 1s were 0.711, 1.334, 3.961 and 0.296, respectively."
10,Kinetic experiments,"2.9 Kinetic experiments In all of the kinetic experiments, the reaction mixture was prepared from 1g (0.0035mol) of stearic acid (Merck 97%) and dissolved in 100ml of dodecane (Sigma–Aldrich 99%) at 60°C. The solution was injected to a heated pre-reactor at 90°C. To remove air, the pre-reactor was flushed with inert gas, which afterwards was substituted with hydrogen. Experiments were performed in a high-pressure steel Parr reactor at temperature range 180–220°C and total over pressure was 2–4MPa in hydrogen (AGA, 5.0). The catalyst (0.1g) was reduced ex situ, under a hydrogen atmosphere (1bar) for 2h at 400°C (temperature was selected based on Re/TiO2 TPR – Fig. 2) with a heating ramp of 2°C/min. After the reduction, the catalyst was immediately transferred to the reactor. The air in the reactor was substituted first with inert gas and subsequently with 0.2MPa of hydrogen. Thereafter, the reactor was heated (5°C/min) to the desired temperature at which the reaction mixture was injected together with hydrogen to achieve the desired pressure. The propeller stirrer with a stirring rate set to 1200rpm was used to exclude external mass transfer limitations. The internal mass transfer limitations can be excluded as a grain size of titania support was below 63μm. In the experiment with the non-reduced Re/TiO2, the catalyst was placed in the reactor at room temperature and flushed with argon to remove air. Afterwards, temperature was raised to 220°C. Reactants and hydrogen were injected at the same time and the stirring was started."
11,Product analysis,"2.10 Product analysis The analysis of the liquid phase was performed using gas chromatography (HP 5890) containing ZB-5 Inferno column (30m, 0.32mm, 0.1μm). Samples for analysis were prepared by mixing 0.1ml of the reaction mixture with 0.1ml of the silylation agent (BSTFA, Sigma–Aldrich), 0.1ml of eicosane (Acros Organics, 99%) dissolved in dodecane (1mg/ml) as an internal standard and 1ml of pyridine (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%). Thereafter, the samples were left in the oven at 70°C for 1h to ensure a proper silylation before injection to the GC. The same sample preparation procedure was performed before the qualitative analysis in GC–MS (GC-6890N, MS-5973) with the chromatographic column DB-PETRO (100m, 0.25mm, 0.5μm)."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2 was used to determine the strength and the amount of acid and basic sites. The NH3 TPD of non-impregnated TiO2 shows weak acid sites with a desorption maximum at 140°C. The Re/TiO2 catalyst showed two maxima at 198°C and 368°C, indicating two kinds of acid sites (Fig. 1 a). The total volume of ammonia adsorbed over the Re/TiO2 catalyst was 18 times higher than of bare TiO2, indicating a high increase of the acidity after the deposition of rhenium (Table 1 ). However, it has to be pointed out that the decomposition of ammonia over rhenium can occur at temperatures around 350°C, which could influence the generation of the second peak [10]. The TPD of CO2 was performed similar to that of NH3 on TiO2 and Re/TiO2 catalysts. Pure TiO2 showed a desorption peak at a low temperature (92°C), while after the deposition of rhenium, three kinds of sites were found with maxima at 80°C, 161°C and 348°C (Fig. 1b), with total volume of CO2 adsorbed increasing over 14 times (Table 1). 3.1.1 Oxidation state of rhenium The TPR analysis shows that the reduction of rhenium starts at around 200°C and passes through two maxima at 278°C and 330°C (Fig. 2 ). In all of the experiments, the catalyst was reduced at 400°C for 2h. At the same time, the XPS analysis revealed that the catalyst while being active was not fully reduced under these conditions (Fig. 3 b) and contains Re7+, Re6+ and Re4+ species, which is in agreement with the previous studies on the reduction of supported rhenium [11]. Re7+ was reduced during the reaction to form Re6+ and Re4+ (Fig. 3c). Moreover, similar catalyst oxidation states were found after the reaction independently on the reduction state of the catalyst before an experiment (Re-oxide/TiO2 or reduced Re/TiO2) (Table 2 ). Furthermore, there were no traces of metallic Re0 species in the fresh and spent catalysts suggesting that ReO x is the active component in the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols. It is important to mention that rhenium has a high affinity to oxygen, which increases with the metal dispersion [12]. A highly dispersed catalyst, which is prepared in this work, can be oxidized upon contact with air. To confirm this hypothesis, the reduced sample was separated into two parts. The first part was kept under an inert atmosphere, while the second one was exposed to air at room temperature for 15min. Thereafter, the catalysts were analysed with XPS. This experiment confirmed that even a short exposure to air at room temperature can result in the partial oxidation of Re6+ and/or Re4+ to Re7+ (Table 2). 3.1.2 Particle size of rhenium The rhenium particle-size distribution were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique, showing a very high dispersion of rhenium (close to 100%) with an average particle size calculated from the images being 0.9±0.03nm (Fig. 4 ). For comparison, CO chemisorption on the catalyst was also performed and the calculated (with assumed stoichiometric factor CO/Re=1) dispersion was 35%. The differences between TEM and CO chemisorption can be explained by the partial reduction of rhenium. Re4+ and Re6+ binds much weaker CO than Re0 since rhenium cations have less electrons to back-donate to the CO ligand [13]. This results in a lower CO uptake and subsequently underestimation of the dispersion."
14,Hydrogenation of stearic acid,"3.2 Hydrogenation of stearic acid The hydrogenation of stearic acid over ReO x /TiO2 was performed in the temperature range between 180°C and 220°C in hydrogen at a total pressure between 2 and 4MPa. The main product was octadecanol (Fig. 5 a). The experiments showed that the product formation can be achieved with a high activity even at temperatures below 200°C. The initial activity of the catalyst (calculated at 30min for each reaction) at 2MPa total pressure varied from 0.07 ( mol stearic acid g Re - 1 h - 1 ) to 0.39 between 180 and 220°C (Fig. 5b). Moreover, an increase in the hydrogen pressure enhances the reaction rate. It was observed that, at 200°C, an increasing the hydrogen pressure from 2 to 3 to 4MPa resulted in an increased conversion of 40% and 70% after 30min reaction time, respectively. The apparent reaction order with respect to hydrogen was close to unity. The formation of the alcohol from the acid over ReO x /TiO2 catalyst occurs through an aldehyde intermediate, which is formed at the beginning of the reaction and passes through a maximum. Simultaneously, small amounts of hydrocarbons were observed. Octadecane and octadecene were formed by dehydration and subsequent hydrogenation (only octadecane) of octadecanol, while heptadecane and heptadecene were the products of stearic acid decarboxylation or octadecanal decarbonylation/dehydroformylation. Similar reaction pathways have been proposed for deoxygenation of fatty acid over noble-metal-supported catalysts at higher temperatures [14]. Furthermore, the formation of a wax ester (stearyl stearate) was observed, which appears after ∼10% of stearic acid conversion from the reaction of stearic acid with 1-octadecanol. Based on the product distribution, the reaction pathway is proposed (Scheme 1 ). The selectivity to octadecanol increases with the conversion of stearic acid reaching 88–93% at a high conversions (Fig. 6 a and b). The aldehyde formation is prominent at low conversion levels, while ester formation influences the final selectivity at high conversion level. The formation of alkane is visible during the whole reaction. The selectivity to hydrocarbons is not strongly affected by a change of the reaction conditions, in contrary to the selectivity towards the aldehyde and the ester. The initial selectivity towards the aldehyde can be as high as 45% for the reaction at 220°C and 2MPa of total pressure. However, a decrease of the temperature at 2MPa of total pressure decreases the rate of aldehyde formation (Fig. 6c), therefore, increasing the initial selectivity to the alcohol. Moreover, it can be observed that the hydrogen pressure does not influence the selectivity towards the aldehyde (Fig. 6d). On the contrary, the formation of stearyl stearate at high conversion levels can be inhibited by a high hydrogen pressure that decreases the selectivity to ester from 3.5% to 1.5% (conversion=80%) in experiments at 2MPa and 4MPa of total pressure, respectively. The decrease of temperature had no influence on the selectivity towards the ester. The selectivity to hydrocarbons remains constant below 5% between 20% and 90% of the stearic acid conversion. During initial conversion period, an increased formation of alkanes can be observed (Fig. 7 ). Moreover, an increase of the hydrogen pressure does not influence the formation rates of the hydrocarbons as well as the distribution of hydrocarbon products. It was observed that lower reaction temperatures decrease the selectivity to total hydrocarbons. At 180°C (2MPa), no unsaturated products were found. Furthermore, the decarboxylation/decarbonylation rates decrease under these conditions, yielding less C17 hydrocarbons, while the rate of octadecanol hydrogenation to octadecane remains the same. In overall, the selectivity towards alkanes decreased to the level around 4%. The selectivity of 4% ReO x /TiO2 at different temperatures and pressures can be seen in Table 3 . 3.2.1 Formation of alkanes During the conversion of stearic acid, the formation of hydrocarbons is minimal and stays at a level of around 4–5%. However, after a complete conversion of the acid, the rates of the alkane formation increase rapidly. For the experiment at 220°C and 2MPa of hydrogen pressure, the generation activity of the main hydrocarbon product (octadecane) increases from 0.01 ( mol octadecane g Re - 1 h - 1 ) – during the conversion of fatty acids (60–80%) – to 0.05 – during the later transformation of the alcohol (3–9%). This phenomenon can be caused by a difference of the adsorption strength between fatty acid and the alcohol. Since the acid is stronger adsorbed on the active site, the alcohol cannot adsorb and react to form alkanes. In the absence of stearic acid, the transformation of the alcohol takes place, and thus, competitive adsorption is the main reason of the unusually high selectivity of stearic acid conversion to octadecanol over ReO x /TiO2 at medium temperatures and pressures. As all acid was converted, the transformation of octadecanol took place. The main product of the octadecanol conversion is octadecane with a rising selectivity as the reaction proceeds (Fig. 8 ). The ratio between the hydrogenation product (octadecane) and decarboxylation/decarbonylation product (heptadecane) increases with time as octadecanol is the main substrate for further transformation. However, a small amount of heptadecane was produced due to the conversion of stearyl stearate, which is still present in the system. 3.2.2 Reduction of the catalyst A reaction with a non-reduced Re/TiO2 catalyst was performed at 220°C in 2MPa H2. The conversion of stearic acids was significantly lower than in the reaction with the pre-reduced catalyst (Fig. 9 a) with an initial activity of 0.06 ( mol stearic acid g Re - 1 h - 1 ) compared to 0.39 for pre-reduced catalyst at the same conditions. Moreover, the selectivity to the main product for the non-reduced catalyst is lower at all conversion levels, which is caused by an increased formation of hydrocarbons in comparison with the experiment with a pre-reduced catalyst (Fig. 9b). The XPS measurements revealed that the oxidation state of rhenium for both non-reduced and pre-reduced spent catalysts was similar (Table 2), indicating that the reduction of rhenium for a non-reduced catalyst occurred during the reaction. However, a lower conversion in the experiment with the non-reduced catalyst indicates that the gas-phase pre-reduction step is crucial for the catalyst activity. It can be explained by a deficiency of the oxygen vacancies in titania, which formation requires a higher reduction temperature than used in the experiment [15]. During the pre-reduction of the catalyst at 400°C, TiO2 is partially reduced creating oxygen vacancies needed for the reaction to occur through the proposed mechanism, which is similar to the mechanisms suggested previously for the alcohol formation over titania-supported platinum [7] and ruthenium [6]. A shift in the binding energy of rhenium species for the reduced catalyst can be ascribed to substantial interactions between rhenium and Ti3+. The Re–O–Ti3+ sites are responsible for the formation of alcohol on which the carbonyl group of the acid is stronger adsorbed, thus inhibiting further transformations of the alcohol to hydrocarbons. A decrease in the titania oxygen vacancies on the interface with rhenium nanoparticles leads to a decrease of the number of sites on which adsorption of the acid is strong. Therefore, the alcohol can be more easily transformed to alkanes when the acid is still present in the system. This explains both lower conversion of fatty acids as a number of active sites for the reaction decreased and a higher formation of alkanes as the adsorption of alcohol on the catalyst increased. A similar effect was observed for hydrogenation of CO over ReO x /TiO2 at 250°C and 2.1MPa [15]."
15,Kinetic analysis,"3.3 Kinetic analysis The reaction network for hydrogenation of stearic acid is displayed in Scheme 2 . For the development of the kinetic model, it was assumed that all organic molecules are adsorbed on the same type of sites. The reaction order with respect to hydrogen is almost unity, which is consistent with low hydrogen coverage and its poor adsorption on rhenium compared to such metals as platinum. It was thus reasonable to assume that hydrogen from the fluid phase takes part in the reaction. Assumption of a pairwise addition of weakly adsorbed hydrogen would result in the same kinetic expression, while a concept of hydrogen adsorption with dissociation and stepwise addition of hydrogen atoms with the first step being the rate limiting in the spirit of the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism inevitably results in the reaction order towards hydrogen equal to 0.5. Based on kinetic regularities, generation of an intermediate complex on the surface consisting of stearic acid and hydrogen can be considered as the rate-limiting step in the route from stearic acid to octadecanal while a further rearrangement of the surface complex to the aldehyde and water is fast. An analogous sequence of steps was supposed for hydrogenation of octadecanal to octadecanol. Transformations of the latter to a corresponding alkane require first dehydration to octadecene with subsequent hydrogenation. Similar type of hydrogenation steps was considered in the literature [16]. Such sequence of steps can account for reaction orders in organic compounds ranging from zero to unity. The reaction mechanism is comprised of four reaction routes (Schemes 2 and 3 ). In Schemes 2 and 3, SA is stearic acid, AD, AC, OE, OD and SS are, respectively, octadecanal, octadecanol, octadecene, octadecane and stearyl stearate. Sign ∗ in Scheme 2 denotes the active sites on the metal surface, while steps R1, etc. are reaction steps, while steps A1, etc. correspond to adsorption. The fast steps are denoted as, for example, R1′. The schemes are based on the theory of complex reactions developed by Horiuti and extended by Temkin [17–19]. The elementary steps above can be described by four reaction routes, i.e. sets of stoichiometric numbers of steps. Elementary reactions are grouped in steps, and chemical equations of steps contain reactants and intermediate products. A set of stoichiometric numbers of steps is defined as a reaction route. Routes are essentially different, and it is impossible to obtain one route through multiplication of another route by a number, even in cases when their respective overall equations are identical. The number of basic routes, P, is determined by P = S + W − I, where S is the number of steps, W is the number of balance (link) equations and I is the number of intermediates. Such balance (link) equations can correspond to the total coverage of sites equal to unity. On the right hand side of equations for the steps, stoichiometric numbers along the four routes N(1)–N(4) are given. These numbers are selected in a way, that the overall chemical equations do not contain intermediates. Since octadecene was not present in the reaction mixture in experiments with the rhenium catalyst, its coverage can be considered low and further hydrogenation fast. Based on quasi-equilibrium adsorption of reactants and products, the following expressions can be written, respectively, for active sites (1) θ SA = K 1 C SA θ V ; θ AD = K 2 C AD θ V ; θ AC = K 3 C AC θ V ; θ OD = K 4 C OD θ V where K 1, etc. are the equilibrium constant of respective equilibrium steps A1–A4, C SA , etc., are concentrations and θV is the coverage of the vacant sites. From the balance equations for different types of sites, coverage of vacant sites can be easily computed (2) θ V = 1 1 + K 1 C SA + K 2 C AD + K 3 C AC + K 4 C OD The reaction rate r ( 1 ) along the first route N(1) is defined through step R1 which can be considered as the one limiting the rate in this route (3) r ( 1 ) = k 1 K 1 C SA C H 2 1 + K 1 C SA + K 2 C AD + K 3 C AC + K 4 C OD The rates along the second and the third routes are given in a similar fashion (4) r ( 2 ) = k 2 K 2 C AD C H 2 1 + K 1 C SA + K 2 C AD + K 3 C AC + K 4 C OD (5) r ( 3 ) = k 3 K 3 C AC 1 + K 1 C SA + K 2 C AD + K 3 C AC + K 4 C OD The route N(4) is considered as a non-catalytic, therefore (6) r ( 4 ) = k 4 C AC C SA Initially, this step was considered as reversible; however, during the numerical data fitting, it turned out that the backwards reaction in the studied domain can be neglected. Finally, the generation rates of compounds can be written as: (7) - dC SA ρ B dt = r ( 1 ) + r ( 4 ) , dC AD ρ B dt = r ( 1 ) - r ( 2 ) ; dC AC ρ B dt = r ( 2 ) - r ( 3 ) - r ( 4 ) ; dC OD ρ B dt = r ( 3 ) , dC SS dt = r ( 4 ) where t is time and ρB is the mass-of-catalyst-to-liquid-volume ratio. The temperature dependence of the rate constants was assumed according to the Arrhenius equation, while negligible influence of temperature on KSA was supposed. The kinetic modelling was performed for all reaction rates and reaction sets together. For the parameter estimation instead of absolute values of product concentrations, their molar percentage was used, and a set of differential equations describing the changes in the concentrations profiles of the reagents and products with time was solved by means of ModEst software [20]. Using Levenberg–Marquardt simplex method, the target function, which was defined as incompliance between the experimental and calculated values of concentrations, was used to solve the system. The sum of the residual squares between the model and the experimental data was minimized using the following objective function: (8) Q = ‖ x exp - x est ‖ 2 = ∑ t ∑ i ( x exp , it - x est , it ) 2 where xexp is the experimental value, xest denotes the predictions given by the model, i is the component index and t is the time value. The quality of the fit and accuracy of the model description was defined by the degree of explanation R 2; which reflects comparison between the residuals given by the model to the residuals of the simplest model one may think of, i.e., the average value of all the data points. The R 2 value is given by the expression (9) R 2 = 100 ( y model - y experiment ) 2 ( y model - y ¯ experiment ) 2 Preliminary calculations demonstrated that the values of equilibrium constants K 3 and K 4 are small enough to neglect them. Since the concentration of aldehyde is also low, the term K 2 C AD was neglected. Thus the values of k 2 and k 3 in fact are lumped ones, containing also the value of K 2 and K 3, respectively. The values of the calculated frequency factors, activation energy and adsorption constants as well as the estimated relative standard errors (in%) of the tested reaction mechanism are presented in Table 4 . The values of pre-exponential constants for k 1–k 3 also include the catalyst concentration. Fig. 10 displays as, an example, an excellent comparison for experimentally observed data and model predictions for reactants in the studied range of pressures, concentrations and temperature with the degree of explanation 99.72%. The standard errors of all parameters are acceptably low. The values of activation energies for selective hydrogenation of acids to alcohols are not readily available for Re-based catalysts, thus a comparison can be made only with other types of catalysts, such as homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation with Cu oleates giving 56kJ/mol [21]. The kinetic model, presented above, was developed for the case of first order in hydrogen, which implies weak adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface. It can be thus probably applied for similar catalytic systems as applied in the current work when, for example, oxophilic metals are used on reducible oxides or even non-reducible oxides. For reducible metals, such as Pt or a combination of reducible and oxophilic metals, such as ReOx–Pd/SiO2 catalyst utilized for hydrogenation of saturated fatty acids [22], some modifications of the kinetic model might be needed to address changes in hydrogen adsorption behaviour and possible different kinetic regularities."
16,Conclusions,"Highly dispersed ReO x /TiO2 was applied as a catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols. The selectivity to octadecane up to 93% was achieved in the temperature range between 180–220°C and 2–4MPa of total pressure. It was demonstrated that with a decrease of temperature and an increase of pressure, a higher selectivity to the main product is achieved. A high yield of octadecanol was obtained due to a strong adsorption of the fatty acid compared to the fatty alcohol, which inhibits a further transformation of the alcohol to alkanes. The hydrocarbon can be treated as the only by-product of the reaction, since stearyl stearate, which is also formed, can be further transformed to the desired products. Moreover, with pre-reduced 4% ReO x /TiO2, the selectivity to hydrocarbons is around 5%. However, after a complete conversion of stearic acid, hydrocarbons were mainly formed with octadecane as the main product. The XPS studies confirm that the oxidation state of rhenium was Re4+ and Re6+ during the experiments. In experiments with a non-reduced rhenium catalyst, a lower conversion was obtained with a higher formation of hydrocarbons, which was caused by a lower amount of oxygen vacancies on the interface between rhenium and titania. The reaction kinetics was modelled based on the mechanistic considerations for stearic acid hydrogenation. The calculated results were compared with experimental data through numerical data fitting, showing a very good correspondence was obtained (with the degree of explanation close to 99.6%)."
