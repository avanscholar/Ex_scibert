0,Introduction,"Thermal decomposition of methanol is mostly studied over a heterogeneous catalyst as a method of testing the efficacy of the catalyst for more complex compounds. For example, using irradiated alumina [1] or Ni (111) [2] to convert methanol to valuable chemicals such as methoxymethane or to H2 using copper based catalysts such as CuZn/Al2O3 [3] or palladium on zinc oxide supports [4]. In both cases, the process is not economically viable with methanol, but the findings would apply to larger molecules such as ethanol, which are more economically and environmentally attractive. Although cold plasma assisted decomposition of methanol has been of interest due to its unique properties that can potentially produce compounds which are impossible to obtain in conventional processes, studies on methanol decomposition via cold plasma are limited due to methanol being more valuable than the potential products. However, methanol is a useful model compound to prove the validity of the methodology and establish the process dynamics before testing with more complex inputs. For example, methanol decomposition under cold plasma conditions has been investigated for H2 production [5]. The mechanism of cold plasma initiated decomposition of methanol in N2 has also been theoretically studied [6]. However, the mechanism of the plasma catalytic process and the effects of a plasma-liquid interface on the reaction are not available. In cold plasmas, energy from electrons is transferred into gas molecules to form excited species [7], which then interact with liquid molecules causing cleavages of chemical bonds [8,9]. Depending on the carrier gas and plasma power, the rate of the formation of excited species can be modified, which is important to affect the degree of decomposition [6]. Due to its unique properties, cold plasmas can potentially induce reactions at ambient temperatures to generate products that are difficult to obtain in conventional chemistry In this study, a gas-liquid phase dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor was developed to explore the feasibility of cold plasma-initiated deoxygenation of alcohols. This work studied the effectiveness of two-phase plasma reactors for decomposition of methanol to test the validity of the reactor design and determine if any desirable products could be obtained. The mechanisms and the roles of carrier gases on the reaction pathways were also investigated and validated using experimental data."
1,Experimental method,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup The detailed experimental set up was similar to previous studies [10] and is shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor consisted of a 1.5 cm inner diameter and 30 cm long quartz tube covering in a 12 cm long plasma zone, giving a cross sectional area of 0.636cm2 and plasma volume of 7.632 cm3. Prior to experiments, the system was purged with the desired carrier gas i.e. H2, N2 or He (>99.999 % purity, BOC Ltd.) for 30 min at a flow rate of 50 mL/min measured by a Bronkhorst El-flow mass flow sensor (error: ±0.03 mL/min). N2 is the standard carrier gas for thermal decomposition studies, allowing easy comparison to this work. Additionally, it has a wide range of excited states above 12.96 eV, which permit a wider range of reactions than other gases [11]. He has the most stable electron configuration of the three carrier gases and has the most energetic initial excited state energy at 25.6 eV. This high energy state would allow extremely high energy reactions to occur that would be unfeasible under any other gas [12]. H2 was also included in this study, as while its excited states are typically low energy (3.7 eV) [11], the excited species include hydrogen radicals, which can facilitate hydrogenation reactions. This also allows identification and quantification of the effect of hydrogen radicals on the process. Once the system was confirmed air-free by gas chromatography (GC), the flow rate of the carrier gas was set to 40 mL/min. The liquid reactant, i.e. methanol (99 % purity, Fisher Scientific) was fed at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using a WPI Al-4000 syringe pump (error: ±0.01 mL/min) and mixed with the carrier gas at a T-junction (Fig. 1) before the inlet. This gas:liquid ratio (40:1) was used to generate a stable slug flow regime to ensure even distribution of the liquid at the inlet. When the gas and liquid inputs approached the reactor, the plasma system was switched on and adjusted to the desired power (10, 30 or 50 W). The reactor outlet was connected to condensers maintained at 30 °C and 0 °C respectively to collect liquid products. The gas evolved was analysed every 15 min and each experiment was continued until the gas evolved matched the previous GC analysis, typically 30−45 min. Each set of experiments was repeated three times to ensure repeatability. The results were averaged with errors within ±5 % of the average value."
3,Product analysis,"2.2 Product analysis Non-condensable gas was analysed online using a Varian 450-GC with one thermal conductivity detector and 2 flame ionisation detectors set up in two ovens and calibrated with reference gas mixtures. The oven for the thermal conductivity detector contained 3 columns in series (Hayesep T0.5mx1/8″ ultimetal, Hayesep Q0.5mx1/8″ ultimetal and Molsieve 13 × 1.5mx1/8″ ultimetal) to detect atmospheric gases. The second oven housed two columns in parallel: a CP-SIL 5CB FS 25 × .25 (0.4 mm ID) for hydrocarbons and a CP-WAX 52CB FS 25 × .32 (1.2 mm ID) for alcohols. The condensable products were analysed with off-line techniques. The water content of the liquid phase was determined by coulometric Karl-Fischer titration (error: ±0.03 % wt). The liquid products were identified and approximately quantified using a Perkin-Elmer Clarus 500 GC with a 30 m x 0.32 mmID x0.25 μm BPX-BD20 column and 540C MS detector. Once the liquid composition was identified, a HP 6890 GC with a 30 m x 0.32 mmID x0.25 μm BPX-BD20 column was used to quantify non-volatile products and a Varian 450-GC was used for volatile hydrocarbons and alcohols to determine the liquid phase yields. The heating profile for the Perkin-Elmer Clarus 500 GC and HP 6890 GC for glycerol analysis was 150 °C for 1 min, followed by heating at 10 °C/minute up to 210 °C followed by a 10 min hold, using 2 mL/min He as the carrier gas. The Perkin-Elmer Clarus 500 GC and Varian 450-GC heating profile for hydrocarbons and alcohols was 40 °C initially, heating at 2 °C/minute to 50 °C, then at 8 °C/minute up to 90 °C, then 10 °C/minute to 120 °C. The conversion of methanol (X) is defined as: X = m a s s f e e d s t o c k i n - m a s s u n r e a c t e d f e e d s t o c k o u t m a s s o f f e e d s t o c k f e d i n t o t h e s y s t e m × 100 The process yields are defined as: Y i e l d o f c o m p o n e n t i % = m a s s o f c o m p o n e n t i m a s s o f f e e d s t o c k f e d × 100"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Methanol decomposition,"3.1 Methanol decomposition Table 1 shows that methanol conversion increased with increasing plasma power for all three tested carrier gases (H2, N2 and He). This is because increasing the plasma power is realized by increasing the applied voltage, which increases the average electron energy and thus the number of energetic electrons. These energetic electrons initiate the formation of excited species, consequently accelerating the decomposition process in this study [13,14]. The carrier gas also had a significant effect on the conversion of methanol. For example, 25.9 % conversion was achieved in H2 environment but only 13.8 % in N2 at the same plasma power of 50 W. The conversion was typically in the order H2 > He > N2, with very different product distributions. CO2 was only produced under N2 and He whereas higher yields of CO (9.69 wt.%) and gaseous hydrocarbons (C1-C3) (14.44 wt.%) were obtained in a H2 environment. These differences suggest that different pathways are favoured for each carrier gas. The product yield distributions were very different from those obtained from conventional thermal processes and other cold plasma gas-phase systems (mainly H2 (15.1 %) and CO (35.4 %) [5,6]). It can be concluded that the product distribution is significantly affected by reactor design [3], multi-phase reactions [3,6], feedstock concentration and power input [5]. Previous studies [3,15] demonstrated that cold plasma treatment of gas phase methanol produces hydrocarbons (C1-C3), water and CO via two dominant pathways: (i) decomposition to methyl and hydroxyl radicals via CO bond splitting [16] and (ii) decomposition to methoxy and hydrogen radicals via OH bond splitting [3,5,6,16] as shown in Reaction 1. Methanol cation radicals can also form but are thought to contribute little to the range of potential products [3,15]. (1) Primary initiation reactions for methanol decomposition [6] Based on their dissociation energies, the formation of methyl and hydroxyl radicals (pathway (ii)) dominates due to the CO bond energy being lower (358KJ/mol) than the OH bond (428KJ/mol). However, methanol cation radicals (CH2OH+) also form due to the cleavage of a CH bond in the presence of cold plasma with a range of electron energies (Fig. 2 below). These methanol cation radicals can potentially reform to methanal by reacting with hydroxyl radicals, releasing water, but do not typically reform without further energy input [17]. The methoxy radicals can also reform into methanal via isomerisation when in the presence of hydroxyl radicals, releasing water as a by-product (Reaction 2) [18,19]. Derakhshesh et al. also modelled the decomposition of gas phase methanol (methanol trace 400 ppm) in N2 environment in a DBD plasma, proposing the two dominant initiation reactions as shown in Reaction 1 [6]. Despite observing higher conversion of trace gaseous methanol in cold plasma [17] than recorded in this gas-liquid phase study (due to fewer molecules to be dissociated in an equivalent pool of highly energetic electrons, radicals and other excited species [20]), the initial decomposition of methanol molecules was via the similar pathways (Reaction 1) [20]. (2) Reformation pathway for methoxy radicals to methanal In the H2 cold plasma environment, due to its low dissociation energy (3.7 eV), H2 is dissociated into hydrogen radicals (288KJ/mole), which then combine with methyl radicals to form methane (CH3 + H → CH4) and then longer chain hydrocarbons via reactions with other methyl radicals (e.g. CH3 + CH3 → C2H6) (Table 1). CO was formed at 10 W under all carrier gases (1.2–2.9 wt.%) providing evidence of the dissociation of the OH bond (428KJ/mole: equivalent to 4.43 eV). The generation of CO under H2 environment could also be due to the generation of methanol cation radicals via CH bond breakage followed by isomerisation to methanal (160KJ/mol or 1.65 eV) [22] and dehydrogenation to CO (296KJ/mol or 3.06 eV) [20]. CO could also form from methoxy radicals (Reaction 2) but methoxy radical formation is likely to be inhibited due to the abundance of hydrogen radicals. In an abundant H2 environment, i.e. using H2 as carrier gas, the yield of methane is expected [19] to be much higher than that of ethane because (i) the reaction rate of combination of methyl and hydrogen radicals is 10 times higher than that of combination of two methyl radicals ((3.5 × 10−10 cm3 mole−1s−1 compared to 6 × 10-11 cm3 mole−1s−1) (NIST) and (ii) the rate of ethane decomposition into methyl radicals (2.3 × 10−7 cm3 mole−1s−1) is much higher than the formation (6 × 10−11 cm3 mole−1s−1). However, this is not the case in H2 at plasma powers of 30−50 W. A plausible explanation could be the reaction between methoxy radicals and methyl radicals from the initiation reactions (Fig. 1) to form methoxymethane (1.95 × 10−11 cm3 mole−1s−1), then reforming to ethane by hydrogen radical attack (Reaction 3) [23,24]. The presence of ethanol in the liquid phase could be due to the combination of methyl and methanol cation radicals [22] as shown in Reaction 4. (3) Formation of ethane via methoxymethane decomposition (4) Proposed route for formation of ethanol (5) Formation pathway for carbon dioxide via formate radicals For gas-liquid reactions in cold plasma, only ions, radicals and excited species can diffuse into the liquid phase and/or interact with the molecules at the liquid surface while electrons cannot due to rapid loss of energy to surrounding molecules [18]. This means that electrical charging of the liquid molecules via electron collisions does not occur to any significant extent due to the electrical conductivity of the liquid spreading the charge. However, not all energetic electrons induce dissociation or excitation of the carrier gas and a significant portion of the energy (up to 90 %) is converted into heat [25], causing the methanol to vaporise. This then becomes subject to gas-phase decomposition, with electron attacks alongside radicals and excited species. As shown in Fig. 2, the proportion of electrons capable of exciting hydrogen to hydrogen radicals is greater than that capable of exciting nitrogen molecules, but nitrogen can produce higher energy species. This would suggest that hydrogen favours lower energy reactions over higher energy reactions. The highest conversion (25.9 %) and hydrocarbon (C1-C3) yields (14.44 wt.%) are obtained in H2 carrier gas, which supports this. In addition, hydrogen would provide an excess of hydrogen radicals to convert methyl radicals to hydrocarbons. Hydrogen radicals can also diffuse into the liquid phase, where they can interact with methanol molecules to generate methyl radicals, which can then initiate further reactions [26]. It was noted that the H2 carrier gas flowrate at the outlet was less than at the inlet, indicating its consumption during radical attack and stabilization of other radicals. The amount of H2 consumed during the decomposition process increased with plasma powers, for example 3.67 cm3/min at 10 W, 15.12 cm3/min at 30 W and up to 25.67 cm3/min at 50 W. The formation of CO2 in N2 and He environments is most likely via the reforming of methoxy radicals to CO, which in turn reacts with a hydroxyl radical to produce formate radicals, which then reform to CO2 (Reaction 5) [23,27]. Theoretically, formic acid could form from hydrogenation of the formate radicals, but no formic acid was detected during analysis under any conditions, indicating dehydrogenation to CO2 dominates. At the gas-liquid interface, the reactions of the methoxy decomposition pathway are inhibited in a H2 environment due to insufficient energy in hydrogen radicals. This is evidenced by the negligible yields of CO2 detected under H2 (formate radical to CO2 requires OH bond splitting). The prevalence of this pathway is also limited under N2 and He, with products such as methyl methanoate and CO2 at low yields due to the higher activation energy. In contrast to conventional thermal decomposition processes [24,28–30], methanal was not detected in cold plasma. This could be due to the instability of methanal in the presence of highly energetic electrons causing its rapid decomposition to CO and H2 [20]. In a He environment, a small amount of propanal (0.96 wt.%) was detected in the liquid phase at 50 W plasma power. This indicates that aldehdyes can be generated but are decomposed by the plasma if they are in gas phase. Unlike conventional thermal decomposition studies of methanol [24,28–30], ethanol and methyl methanoate were generated in the presence of cold plasma. Ethanol could potentially be generated via a reaction between methyl radicals and methanol cation radicals (Reaction 4), or from ethyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals. In this study, a small amount of ethanol was detected (0.45 wt.% at 10 W in Table 1), which disagreed with previous work for low methanol concentrations (10 ppm) in the gas phase [5] where ethanol was not detected in N2 environment. This study (Table 1) produced a wider range of products than reported in literature. This is because the conditions chosen for the experiments are not optimized. It is expected [10] that methanol is converted into a wide range of products in the presence of cold plasma. The purpose of the tests is to understand the effects of carrier gas and plasma power into the decomposition of alcohol compounds and to derive a mechanism under cold plasma conditions. For example, decomposition of a methanol/water mixture using nitrogen gliding arc plasma at 80 °C [5] produced mainly H2 (63 mol%) and CO (26 mol%). By comparison, this study produced abundant CO (7.9 wt.%), methane (2.0 wt.%) and ethane (3.1 wt.%). In addition, many other products were obtained at trace levels, such as methyl methanoate, propane and ethanol. The use of catalytic (Cu/Al2O3) plasma reactors for gas-phase cold plasma decomposition of methanol has also been studied previously [16]. Adding steam enhanced the conversion due to catalytic steam reforming, thus increasing the yield of H2. This indicates that increased temperature (150−250 °C) increases the effects of the cold plasma consistently due to thermal and gas-phase plasma-initiated decomposition occurring in parallel. Methyl methanoate can be produced from esterification of formic acid and methanol in the presence of a catalyst such as H2SO4 at ambient conditions [31,32]. Typical acidic esterification (Reaction 6) occurs via the addition of a hydrogen atom from an oxonium ion (H3O+) to the carbonyl oxygen to produce a diol group and an electropositive carbon atom. The alkyl molecule attaches to the electropositive carbon, transferring the electropositive zone as the ester bond forms [33]. This electropositive area is stabilised by releasing an oxonium ion (H3O+), which reforms the original carboxylic acid oxygen to a carbonyl group, leaving an ester [34]. In the He environment at 50 W plasma power, around 0.73 wt.% methyl methanoate (Table 1) was produced in the absence of a catalyst. This could be due to interactions between formate radicals and methanol (Reaction 6) as He has the highest excitation energy of the three carrier gases. The excitation energy has to be significantly larger than the activation energy due to the liquid phase preventing excited electrons from interacting with the liquid components. This limits decomposition to the liquid surface and formation of liquid radicals is required to induce bulk liquid decomposition. As the liquid is electrically conductive, a proportion of the incoming energy is dispersed as heat [25]. These factors combined mean that a significantly higher excitation energy is required for this reaction to be observed, explaining why methyl methanoate was only detected under He. (6) Typical acidic esterification reaction mechanism Unlike gas-phase cold plasma and thermal decomposition i.e. pyrolysis processes, the propagation of methyl radicals to form long chain hydrocarbons and formation of methoxymethane (Reaction 3) were observed under gas-liquid cold plasma. These products can occur in gas-liquid cold plasma due to their initiation being via radicals and energetic electrons. As the energetic electrons are unable to decompose bulk liquid [18], products of these reactions can accumulate. The reaction mechanism developed from experimental data for cold plasma decomposition of methanol is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The reactions are shown with their kinetic activation energies (Ea) to provide evidence of their feasibility and demonstrate the correspondence of activation energy with relative rates of reaction. In addition to cold plasma initiated reactions, Fig. 3 shows propagation and termination reactions between excited species. These reactions between excited species have activation energies below 10KJ/mol and occur spontaneously even in the absence of a plasma field."
6,Mechanistic modelling for methanol decomposition in the presence of cold plasma,"3.2 Mechanistic modelling for methanol decomposition in the presence of cold plasma This section describes how the experimental data and the derived mechanism were used to simulate the plasma reactor to obtain kinetic constants and allow comparison with other work. A mechanistic two-phase plasma model based on the proposed reaction scheme in Fig. 3 was established in MATLAB. This model assumes the following: • The electron generation reactions and mass transfer resistances between the two phases can be lumped into the activation energies to account for generation of excited species and their transfer into the liquid phase. • All the proposed reactions follow elementary law with respect to reactants, which is accurate providing the plasma does not modify the reaction orders relative to the equivalent non-plasma induced reactions [30]. • The process is equivalent to a batch process with a residence time of 11 s with a 10 s period with no energy input to simulate the effect of liquid condensation and radical termination reactions. The data available in Table 1 was used to evaluate the model, and the quality of the simulation was defined from the mean sum of squared errors (MSSE). The reaction constants of the 12 initial reactions were then modified until MSSE < 0.015. The modifications take into account that excitation of the carrier gas has an activation energy [25] and mass transfer resistance as well. The initial content of methanol was defined in the model at a concentration corresponding to the methanol: N2 flowrate ratio of 1:40 and the plasma zone volume of 7.16 cm3. Cold plasma assisted methanol decomposition was modelled by inducing 12 initiation reactions, with initial kinetic parameters derived from previous plasma decomposition studies [6,23,35,36] or from NIST where unavailable. These initial parameters are shown in Table 2 below. These kinetic parameters were then modified using the experimental data obtained from this study. This was done by identifying the sources of error between the simulation results and the experimental values, then adjusting the rates of each reaction that consumes and/or produce that component. The modification was initially carried out by adjusting the pre-exponential factor. If the agreement was not achieved, activation energy was adjusted accordingly. These steps were repeated until the MSSE was minimized. In addition to cold plasma induced reactions, radical propagation and termination reactions detailed in the mechanism shown in Fig. 3 were also modelled using kinetic data obtained through NIST [19,24]. The rate constants were calculated using the modified Arrhenius equation and the approximated A, N and Ea values above and solved using ODE45 over an 11 s residence time obtained from this study. The MSSE was then calculated and the pre-exponential constants were modified until MSSE < 0.015. The initial conditions were set, including the reactor temperature, electron temperature, residence time and initial component concentrations (1 mol methanol, 0.08 mol H2 if hydrogen purged). Each component is represented by a differential equation in the computational model: d m i d t = ∑ j [ a i j F - a i j R K i j ∏ j N i F Equation 1: Model differential equation for rate of change of each componentWhere: mi is the number of moles of component i Kij is the derived rate constant of reaction J at time t Ni F is the concentration of component I in the forward side of reaction j Aij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant I in reaction j, Where: aij F represents reactions that generate component i aij R represents reactions that consume component i These differential equations were solved simultaneously for every time step until the residence time was reached, then the electron temperature was set to 0 and continued for 10 s. The interval time step with this method and solver is variable and responds to the rate of change of reactants to maintain consistent accuracy using the Newton-Raphson method with a pre-defined tolerance value of 1 × 10−3. The plasma-initiated reactions used in the model are shown in Table 3 , with kinetic constants derived from experimental results under N2 environment. The reactions listed in Table 2 only include the initiation reactions. As the model accounts for mass transfer between phases and radical propagation behaviours by lumping these processes with the reaction constants, the activation energies found from the simulation are often significantly higher than those stated in literature for thermal decomposition reactions. The order of magnitude increase in the activation energy suggests that the liquid phase is very effective in preventing decomposition of liquid phase components as observed experimentally. In Table 2, the pre-exponential constants (A) for plasma-initiated reactions were around 100 times higher than those from the thermal processes. This can be explained by the high levels of electrically charged particles such as radicals and ions in the gas and liquid phases. Many of the excited species, including radicals, are electrically charged by the electron collision, and will strongly attract other charged species of the opposite polarity. This enhances the likelihood of a collision and hence increases the rate of collisions in both phases. In theory, catalysts would also have increased rates of collisions, as catalysts would also become charged as a result of exposure to plasma and hence attract molecules from the gas phase of the opposite charge. The simulated pre-exponential constants would also increase to mirror the increased activation energies identified under cold plasma. Some reactions, however, have greatly decreased rate constants compared to the thermal reaction. For example, ethane dehydrogenation had a thermal pre-exponential constant of 8.47 × 1018 cm3 mole−1s−1 compared to 1.53 × 10−5 cm3 mole−1s−1 with cold plasma. This is partially offset by the higher activation energy (432 KJ/mol thermally vs 122KJ/mol for cold plasma) and temperature dependence (−2.7 thermally vs −0.06 for cold plasma). These differences indicate that plasma can dehydrogenate hydrocarbons at relatively slow rates at all powers, but that the plasma power has much less effect on the H2 yield than predicted by thermal kinetics. This may explain the increased abundance of hydrocarbons other than methane in this study. These were not reported in thermal decomposition studies [30] and only traces were detected in previous plasma induced decomposition works [16,37]. Another significant difference is the decomposition of methanal, where the pre-exponential constant is increased from 2.11 × 10−7 cm3 mole−1s−1 to 1.67 × 10-4 cm3 mole−1s−1 by employing cold plasma. This difference is amplified by the activation energy, which drops sharply from 296KJ/mol to 18.3KJ/mol with cold plasma decomposition. This reflects the extremely rapid decomposition of aldehydes in cold plasma discovered prior to this work [20]. The results from the model were compared to experimental data for validation purposes and to determine any other effects that may be occurring in the reactor. The comparison data is tabulated below in Table 4 . The model and experimental data showed similar trends in product yields and conversion, implying that the model captures the general behaviour of the process. Ratios between products were also predicted effectively. The model correctly predicted an increased conversion with increasing plasma power. More accurate results were obtained at 30 and 50 W. However, some products were over-predicted i.e. water and methane whereas CO, ethane and propane were under-predicted. However, the predicted CO: CO2 ratio is close to the experimental ratio (1.85 simulated compared to 2.10 experimentally). At 50 W, CO2 can be decomposed into O2 and CO [38,39], which was not included in the simulation due to its slow rate and the rapid depletion of O2, resulting in little effect on the model outcomes from preliminary model designs. It was assumed that the dominant mechanism for ethane formation from the formation of methoxymethane from methoxy radicals and methyl radicals [40] was unaffected by plasma in the model as it is a reaction between already excited species [36]. At higher powers, ethane from methoxymethane reformation can decompose to methane readily (k = 2.3 × 10−7 cm3 mole−1s−1) (NIST). This would account for the differences in predicted-yield and experimental data for methane and water. Methoxymethane formation could be increased by the presence of cold plasma, which would increase ethane and hence methane yields, particularly at high powers. The under-predicted yields of all longer chain hydrocarbons (around 29 %) could be due to the higher activity of methyl and ethyl radicals in cold plasma than predicted. The discrepancies between the model and the actual data could also be due to the assumption of constant gas: liquid distribution. However, the temperature of the cold plasma reactor increases while in operation due to dielectric heating, potentially reaching the boiling point of methanol (68 °C). It is also likely that the two phase system, with methanol in both phases due to evaporation and with turbulent liquid: gas mixing, had very different dynamics to plasma and methanol without heating [25]. The electron temperature was calculated based on Boltzmann plot method for gas phase plasma and assumed to be constant throughout the reactor, which is unlikely to be true as electron temperature is known to depend on distance from the electrodes [41], and the presence of liquid may also influence it. As the electron temperature distribution in a multiphase reactor is not known and it was not measured during this work, the calculated electron temperature introduced in the simulation may provide in accurate results. However, in the gas-liquid phase system in this study, the reactions only occur at the gas-liquid interface and the variation in the electron temperature in the interface layer is expected to be negligible [41]. This could explain why the model was less accurate at low powers. At low powers, the uneven electron temperature distribution means that methanol decomposition can only occur in certain regions. At higher powers, electron temperatures are sufficient throughout and thus the overall reaction rate would likely be unaffected by the uneven temperature distribution. Overall, the model and actual data agreed well as to conversion and yields at all powers, with some unexpected differences that suggest additional reactions that were not captured. For example, the differences between the model and experimental data suggest that decomposition of water to hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals is possible at high powers [42]. The derived kinetics were also applied to the H2 and He runs, with corrections for the energetic state and relative abundance of H2. In the case of H2 additional reactions were included due to the abundance of H2 and hence hydrogen radicals present under plasma conditions. The H2 kinetic constants are shown below in Table 5 . In general, the kinetics derived for the N2 carrier gas provided a good fit for the He environment. However, the yields of carbon oxides under He were significantly under-predicted (2.76 wt.% vs 7.9 wt.% CO at 50 W). This suggests an increased rate of dehydrogenation reactions under He, which would also explain the over-prediction of water (2.57 wt.% vs 0.47 wt.% at 50 W). The predicted conversion for He was high at 10−30 W (14.7 vs 11.4 %) but slightly low at 50 W (17.1 vs 18.2 %), which was the inverse of what happened for N2. This appears to be due to an over-prediction of methane yields at high plasma powers (7.38 wt.% vs 2.04 wt.%), which could be because He favours dehydrogenation reactions over cracking and deoxygenation reactions (Table 6 ). Under a H2 carrier gas, the conversion was well represented at higher powers (25.02 % vs 25.32 % at 30 W) but was under-predicted at 10 and 30 W (8.80 vs 12.77 %). This is because significant hydrocarbon yields were recorded experimentally (11.33 wt.% ethane) but could not be achieved through process tuning without extreme water yields (>10 wt.%). As the N2 model did not consider the formation of methoxymethane as a plasma induced reaction due to it being between already excited species, predicted yields of ethane will be lower than experimentally observed. This pathway is therefore a likely method for the formation of the missing ethane. Ethane formation via methoxymethane was also discussed as a potential reaction under N2, but the discrepancy in ethane content was much less significant for N2 than H2. This further supports the methoxymethane pathway as the explanation, as abundant hydrogen is required to reduce methoxymethane to ethane. Methane yields were under-predicted at low powers (0.10 wt.% vs 1.21 wt.%), suggesting that formation of methyl radicals is limited under H2. Predicted CO yields were much lower in the H2 environment than in He (1.46 vs 2.76 wt.% for He at 50 W) which was opposite to that observed experimentally (9.69 vs 7.90 wt.% for He at 50 W). This could be due to the decomposition of methoxymethane to ethane and O2 as detailed in Fig. 3, Reaction 12. In general, the model developed for cold plasma assisted methanol decomposition in a N2 environment produces a good fit for the H2 and He carrier gas environments, except for the yields of ethane and CO for H2 environment and CO and CO2 for He environment. These discrepancies can be attributed to additional reactions that do not occur under N2, such as formation of methyl methanoate, or could be due to changes in reactant concentrations due to the different carrier gas excited states. The model and mechanism were also validated using data available in literature. Errors in experimental data derived from literature presented in Table 7 was reported in an ±5 % error range. Table 7 shows a good agreement between modelling and experimental results in gliding arc plasma decomposition in terms of conversion, with similar yields of hydrocarbons and water. However, the CO yield was underestimated by 56 % whereas the CO2 yield was over-predicted. These discrepancies may be partially due to the gliding arc plasma study utilising a co-feed of water and methanol at a 1:1 ratio while this simulation model is based on a pure methanol feedstock equal to the methanol flowrate. This would explain the higher H2 yields, as water decomposes to hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, where hydroxyl radicals often reform to water via attack on CH bonds [6]. However, this contradicts the yields of CO, which would be further converted to CO2 if an abundance of hydroxyl radicals were present. Of note is that the summed carbon oxide yields only differ by 1.2 mol%, which indicates that the difference is that gliding arc plasma does not induce the conversion of CO to CO2 as rapidly as DBD plasma. For the corona discharge studies, the CO: CO2 ratio was predicted well for the 300 °C run (4:1 ratio) but not individual yields, (around 93–95 % difference, shown in Table 7). No other gaseous products were reported for this work. The discrepancies can be explained as the work used filtered air as the carrier gas instead of N2, therefore oxidation reactions were part of the process. A good agreement in the conversion was achieved at the lower temperature (120 °C) corona discharge run. However, the yields of carbon oxides are still under-predicted by 80–85 % (Table 7). This may indicate that temperature effects are highly significant."
7,Conclusions,"Gas-liquid cold plasma assisted methanol decomposition was carried out in a DBD reactor under three different carrier gases (H2, He and N2) at ambient pressure. H2 produced carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons up to propane with high selectivities and high conversions at 30 W and above. N2 produced carbon dioxide and H2 in addition to all the H2 products but with reduced conversions except at 10 W. He also produced ethanol, propanal and methyl methanoate, with intermediate conversion values between N2 and H2. The traces of methyl methanoate suggest that esterification can be performed under He. Methanol primarily decomposed via radical mechanisms, in which the CO bond cleavage route dominated under cold plasma. Low molecular weight aldehydes (e.g. propenal) were unstable in cold plasma and were decomposed further to ethene and formate radicals. The work shows that although the cold plasma mechanism is similar to thermal decomposition via radical processes, it permits methylation and carbonylation reactions that would not be feasible without specific catalysts such as gallium nitride in thermal processes. The liquid phase reactor output contained low levels of ethanol, which increased with plasma power. The two phase plasma process produced the same range of products as steam reforming except without requiring pressurised steam at 200 °C and a catalyst such as palladium and may therefore prove to be useful for syngas production. The mechanism was successfully validated using a simulated reactor with the proposed reactions present under all three carrier gases and agreed well with the experimental values under most cases. Simulation of the process mechanism demonstrated that the carrier gas has a significant effect on the range of excited species that can be generated. Therefore, the carrier gas can be chosen to permit a high degree of tunability towards specific products. This work demonstrated that the gas-liquid interface also protected less volatile products from decomposition, enabling cold plasma to generate specific products unobtainable via conventional methods. In conclusion, gas-liquid cold plasma is a highly robust and selective method for decomposition of alcohols and offers potential for the valorisation of other organic liquids without requiring extreme conditions, additional reagents or a catalyst."
