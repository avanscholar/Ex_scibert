0,Introduction,"The consumption of fossil energy is rapidly increased, and this has brought many environmental problems. Therefore, it is urgent to develop and utilize environment-friendly and sustainable resources [1,2]. Biomass is the only natural, renewable carbon resource on the earth. It is expected to be as a substitute for fossil fuels, and thus has attracted more and more attentions in the field of new energy sources [3]. Levulinic acid (LA) is considered as one of the most important biomass platform chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass for fuels and chemicals. It can be used not only as raw materials for medicines, resins, spices, coatings and solvents, but also to synthesize many high value-added chemicals [4–7]. Via hydrogenation, LA can be converted into γ-valerolactone (GVL) [8], which is generally recognized as an excellent energy substance because of low toxicity and high stability. Additionally, GVL is also widely used in food additives, flavors, solvents, liquid fuels and so on [9–14]. There are many studies on the hydrogenation of LA using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Currently, supported catalysts are widely investigated in the heterogeneous hydrogenation of LA into GVL. Among them, Ru-based catalysts are most commonly used for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL [10,15,16]. In addition, Ir-based also showed good catalytic performances for the process. Du et al. reported the synthesis of GVL from LA hydrogenation at 50 °C and 2 MPa of H2 using carbon nanotubes supported Ir catalyst, and the reaction even proceeded smoothly in the presence of formic acid [17]. Non-noble metal catalysts also show potentials for the hydrogenation of LA. For examples, SiO2 or ZrO2 supported Cu catalysts have showed good activity for selective hydrogenation of LA [18,19]. However, most of these catalytic reactions required relatively high temperature (100−270 °C) or high H2 pressure (1−15 MPa). To realize efficient hydrogenation of LA to GVL under mild conditions, researchers employed supported bimetallic catalysts for the process [20]. Generally, bimetallic catalysts show higher catalytic hydrogenation activity than their corresponding monometallic systems due to possible synergistic effects between two metallic components. For examples, Landenna et al. reported that Au-Ru/TiO2 catalyst showed a positive synergistic effect for hydrogenation of LA to GVL [21]. Zhao et al. found that Au-Ir/TiO2 exhibited enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol [22]. Xia et al. prepared a series of bimetallic Pd-Cu/solid-base catalysts for hydrogenolysis of glycerol, and found that the hydrogenolysis process proceeded more easily on the bimetallic catalysts than separated Pd and Cu catalysts because the H2-spillover from Pd to Cu increased the activity of Pd-Cu catalysts [23]. Recently, we found that SiC supported metallic catalysts exhibited interesting performances for different hydrogenation reactions, and the good performances were related to the semiconductive feature and surface properties of cubic SiC [24–27]. Ir/SiC catalyst has shown excellent catalytic activity and stability for hydrogenation of LA under mild aqueous conditions (50 °C, 0.2 MPa H2) [27]. In view of the high activity of metallic Ru, it is interesting to incorporate Ru to the Ir/SiC catalyst for LA hydrogenation. In this work, a series of Ru-Ir/SiC catalysts were prepared and tested for hydrogenation of LA. It was found that the incorporation of Ru could effectively promote the activity of metallic Ir. The promotion is related to a synergistic effect among Ru, Ir and SiC."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Iridium chloride hydrate (IrCl3·3H2O), Ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·3H2O), LA, α-angelicalactone, cyclohexane, benzene, i-propanol, chloroform and ethanol were obtained from Aladdin (AR), and CH3OH, CH3CN and DMSO were obtained from Tianjin Kemiou (AR). Deionized water was made in the lab. High purity nitrogen gas, argon gas and hydrogen gas (99 %) was obtained from TISCO (Shanxi, Taiyuan). All chemicals were used as received without any further purification."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Cubic SiC powders with a specific surface area of 46 m2 g−1 were prepared by a sol-gel and carbothermal reduction process [28]. SiC-supported catalysts were prepared via a wet impregnation method. In a typical process, 200 mg of the above SiC powders, 7.76 mg of iridium chloride (IrCl3) and 2.1 mg of ruthenium chloride (RuCl3) were dispersed into 10 mL alcohol solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. Next, the mixture was heated to 80 °C until the solvent was completely evaporated. After drying at 100 °C in the oven for 5 h, the residual solid was reduced by 5 % H2/Ar mixture at 300 °C (5 °C/min) for 2 h, then the Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst was obtained (Ru and Ir loads were 0.5 wt% and 2.5 wt%, respectively). For comparison, other catalysts (Ru3/SiC, Ru0.1-Ir2.9/SiC, Ru0.3-Ir2.7/SiC, Ru1.0-Ir2.0/SiC, Ru1.5-Ir1.5/SiC, Ru2.5-Ir0.5/SiC, Ir3/SiC) with a total metal content of 3 wt% were prepared by the similar process. For comparison, Ru0.5-Ir2.5/TiO2 and Ru0.5-Ir2.5/Al2O3 were also prepared by the similar method."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature on a Rigaku D-Max/RB diffractometer using Cu Kα radiations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100 F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was detected using an ESCALAB 3MKII de VG spectrometer with an Al Kα as X-ray source. In Situ Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements were performed on a Tensor 27 infrared spectrometer with a resolution of 8 cm−1. Hydrogen temperature-programed reduction (H2-TPR), Pulse hydrogen adsorption and Hydrogen temperature-programed desorption (H2-TPD) experiments were carried out on a TP-5080 adsorption analyzer (Xianquan, Tianjin). For H2-TPR, 50 mg of catalyst sample was filled in a quartz tubular reactor prior to the measurement, and introduced H2-N2 mixture (10 vol% H2) until the hydrogen signal reached a constant value. The sample was then heated linearly from 30 to 800 °C with a rate of 5 °C/min. For H2 pulse adsorption and H2-TPD, 100 mg of catalyst was pretreated in N2 gas flow at 300 °C for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature in N2 gas flow. After the pretreatment, H2 pulses were introduced until adsorption saturation of the sample. Then, TPD was carried out after the gas lines and reactor system were purged with N2 (30 mL/min) until the hydrogen signal reached a constant value. The temperature of the catalyst sample was then increased linearly from 30 to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C/ min."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction The catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL was conducted in a 50 mL stainless-steel autoclave. A typical reaction process is described as follows: 4 mmol of LA, 50 mg of catalyst and 10 mL of solvent were dispersed in an autoclave. The reactor was purged with H2 three times, and then filled with 0.2 MPa of H2 gas. The reaction was conducted in ambient H2 at 25 °C under stirring for 1.5 h. After the reaction, the reaction solution was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC–MS, BRUKER SCION SQ 456, Germany). The conversion of LA and the selectivity of GVL were calculated based on the following Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) C o n v . % = M 0 , L A − M t , L A M 0 , L A × 100 % (2) S e l e c t . % = M t , G V L M 0 , L A × 100 %"
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations The DFT calculations on LA adsorption energy were implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with plane-wave-based periodic DFT method [29,30]. The exchange and correlation energy were parametrized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, while the electron-ion interactions were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) setups [31,32]. Based on XRD and TEM results, the most exposed SiC (111), Ir (111) and Ru (101) facets were modeled using a four-layer periodic slabs with 4 × 4, 5 × 6 and 5 × 6 supercells, respectively. Adsorption energies (Eads) of LA on different models were defined relative to clean slab and LA gas molecule (Esub) according to Eads = Esub/slab – Eslab – Esub, in which Esub/slab is the total energy of LA on slab surface."
7,Results and discussion,"The catalytic performances of different catalysts for the hydrogenation of LA into GVL were investigated. The results are summarized in Table 1 . From the Table, pure SiC powders do not show any catalytic activity for LA hydrogenation (Table 1, entry 1). Monometallic Ir3/SiC and Ru3/SiC catalysts are catalytically active for the reaction, but the activities of both catalysts are low. At 25 °C, the LA conversions are 51.2 % and 45.9 %, respectively for Ir3/SiC and Ru3/SiC (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). When replacing a small amount of one metal in the monometallic catalysts by the other, the bimetallic catalysts show enhanced catalytic activity (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). All of these catalysts show very good selectivity for GVL. It is interesting that the activity of bimetallic Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC is evidently higher than that of Ir0.5-Ru2.5/SiC. In addition, the mixture of Ir2.5/SiC and Ru0.5/SiC shows a very lower activity (54.1 %). These suggest that the Ru and Ir nanoparticals have a synergetic effect in the bimetallic catalysts. To further confirm the dependence of catalytic activity on the catalyst composition, we prepared a series of catalysts with different Ir and Ru loadings. In these catalysts, the total mass percentage of Ir and Ru are 3 %. The performances of various catalysts for LA hydrogenation are shown in Fig. 1 . As the Ru content in the Ir catalysts increases, the catalyst activities exhibit a typical volcano evolution. Although the activity of monometallic Ir catalyst for LA hydrogenation is poor at the room temperature, its catalytic activity increases rapidly after replacing by a small amount of Ru. On the contrary, the activity of Ru catalysts increases slowly when replacing by Ir. These indicate that Ir plays a more important role in the bimetallic catalyst. The results shown in Fig. 1 are in agreement with those in Table 1. Therefore, the Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst was selected for the work. The influences of different polar and nonpolar solvents were investigated in the reaction system (Table S1), and water is the best for LA hydrogenation. This may be due to that the presence of H-bonded molecules can reduce the energy span of hydrogenation of ketones and improve the catalytic activity [27,33]. The recyclability of Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC for the hydrogenation of LA was also investigated by reusing it for five rounds under the same reaction condition. The results in Fig. S1a show that the yield of GVL decreased from 100 % to 90 % after 5 consecutive cycles. The slight decrease in catalyst activity is mainly caused by the agglomeration of the active metal on the support surface, which can also be seen from the electron microscope diagram (Fig. S1b) of the catalyst after 5 reactions. To confirm the structural features of Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst, different characterizations such as TEM, HRTEM and XRD were employed. From the TEM images of Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC (Fig. 2 a and b), Ru and Ir nanoparticles are independently distributed on the SiC surface with an average diameter of about 2.4 and 1.5 nm (Fig. S2), respectively. This independent distribution is further confirmed by the high-resolution elemental mappings of Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC (Fig. 2c and d). The lattice spacings of Ir and Ru nanoparticles in Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst are 0.216 nm and 0.205 nm, respectively, corresponding to Ir (111) [34] and Ru (101) [35] crystal planes. Compared with single metal Ir3/SiC and Ru3/SiC (Fig. S3), the lattice spacings of Ru and Ir nanoparticles remain unchanged, indicating that the deposition of Ru and Ir nanoparticles onto the SiC surface does not change the crystal structure of Ru or Ir. From the XRD patterns of Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst (Fig. 2e), all the strong diffraction peaks are corresponding to β-SiC, indicating that the support is well-crystallized [24]. No diffraction peak of Ru or Ir has been observed, which may be due to the low loading of Ru and high dispersion of Ir. For Ru3/SiC and Ru2.5-Ir0.5/SiC, a weak diffraction peak at 44.0° can be observed (Fig. S4), which is ascribed to Ru (101) [36]. The above results suggest that the dispersion of Ir is better than that of Ru when they are deposited on SiC support via the wet impregnation method. XPS was carried out to study the electronic properties of Ir and Ru in the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. From the XPS results shown in Fig. 3 a, the binding energy (BE) of Ir 4f7/2 decreases slightly from 60.7 eV in Ir3/SiC to lower value of 60.5 eV in Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC. Similarly, the BE value of Ir 4f5/2 decreases from 63.7 eV in Ir3/SiC to 63.5 eV in Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC. Comparing with the standard value of metallic Ir (60.9 eV for Ir 4f7/2 and 63.9 eV for Ir 4f5/2) [27,34], the BE values of Ir in both catalysts shift to lower values. In Ir3/SiC, some electrons in the conduction band of SiC transfer to Ir due to the Mott-Schottky effect, which originates from that the work function of Ir (5.27 eV) is higher than that of n-type semiconduct SiC (4.0 eV). In Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC, the electron enrichment on Ir is further enhanced because of the addition of Ru. From Fig. 3b, the BE value of Ru 3p3/2 increases from 462.7 eV in Ru3/SiC to 463.2 eV in Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC, indicating that Ru has lost some of its electrons. Because the work function of Ru (4.71 eV) is lower than that of Ir, some electrons of Ru could transfer to Ir via the semiconductive SiC. In Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC, Ir not only obtains electrons from SiC but also seizes electrons from Ru. As a result, the catalytic activity of Ir increases rapidly. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to test the oxidation-reduction properties of the catalysts. From the H2-TPR results (Fig. 4 ), monometallic Ir catalyst shows a simple reduction peak between 100 and 180 °C with a maximum at 149 °C, which is ascribed to the reduction of Ir species. The monometallic Ru catalyst has a reduction peak at 118 °C (from 50 to 150 °C) that can be attributed to the reduction of Ru species (RuOx, RuO2 amorphous or Ru(OH)x). Another broader peak from 300 to 400 °C can be designated to the reduction of Ru(OH)3 species or the reduction of RuO2 [37]. The bimetallic Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst shows a peak at 124 °C and the hydrogen reduction peak is between the monometallic Ru and Ir catalysts. These results suggest that there exist interactions between Ru and Ir, and the reduction of Ir species becomes easy after adding a small amount of Ru. Dissociation of H2 is an important step for the hydrogenation of LA, therefore it is crucial for the catalysts to efficiently activate molecular hydrogen under mild conditions. To confirm this, we performed H2 pulse adsorption and H2-temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) to investigate the active sites for H2 adsorption and measure the strengths of hydrogen-surface interactions. The saturation adsorption of H2 on Ir3/SiC and Ru3/SiC are 192 and 60 μmol/g, respectively (Table 2 ). Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC shows an enhanced H2 capacity of 293 μmol/g, suggesting a synergistic effect for H2 chemisorption. From the H2-TPD spectra (Fig. 5 ), we can see that all the catalysts have a small H2 desorption peak at about 50−60 °C, which can be assigned to physical adsorption or weak chemical adsorption of H2. For Ir3/SiC, a wide H2 desorption peak in the 350−580 °C range with a maximum at 564 °C is attributed to desorption of hydrogen from Ir particles. And then the hydrogen desorption further continues to above 800 °C, which may be due to the direct desorption of hydrogen species from SiC surface [26]. These results mean that hydrogen adsorption sites include both metal Ir and SiC support. For the latter, the hydrogen bonded on SiC surface comes from the hydrogen spillover from the surface of metal particles. For Ru3/SiC, the H2 desorption temperature (∼ 572 °C) is slightly higher than that of Ir3/SiC (∼ 564 °C), and the H2 desorption amount is less than that of Ir3/SiC. In addition, the direct desorption of hydrogen from SiC surface on Ru3/SiC is not as obvious as that on Ir3/SiC. These results suggest that the ability of Ir3/SiC catalyst for activating hydrogen is stronger than that of Ru3/SiC. For Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC, with the addition of a small amount of Ru, the H2 desorption amount significantly increases and the temperature for H2 desorption decreases to 534 °C. This indicates that the hydrogen desorption from Ir surface becomes easier in the bimetallic catalyst. The sharp peak at 534 °C may be also related to the hydrogen adsorbed on the SiC surface, which migrates to Ir and then desorbs from Ir surface. In other words, the interactions of adsorbed hydrogen with SiC surface become weak, and this will benefit to the hydrogenation processes that occur on the SiC surface. From the TPD results, the addition of a small amount of Ru obviously increases the number of active sites for H2 chemisorption and weakens the interactions between adsorbed hydrogen and SiC surface. This is very similar to that of Pd-Au synergism on SiC surface [26]. In-situ diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to study the adsorption of LA on different catalysts. In the FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. 6 , the main absorption band at ∼1715 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of CO. It can be seen that the absorption band of CO shows negligible shift on pure SiC and SiC-supported catalysts. These suggest that the adsorption of LA possibly occurs on the SiC surface rather than Ru or Ir surface. When using Al2O3 or TiO2 as the catalyst support, the adsorption band shifts evidently (Fig. S5). These further confirm that the adsorption of LA molecule mainly occurs on the SiC surface. Only in this way can the spillover hydrogen greatly contribute to the hydrogenation of LA. The adsorption of LA on SiC support, Ir and Ru metals were further confirmed by DFT calculation, and SiC (111), Ir (111) and Ru (101) slab models were implemented. As shown in Fig. 7 , the adsorption energy of LA on SiC is as high as −7.97 eV, indicating that LA has a strong chemical adsorption over SiC. LA adsorbs on Ru (101) facet with a very low adsorption energy of −0.03 eV, suggesting its weak physical adsorption on Ru surface. An adsorption energy of 2.21 eV for Ir (111) facet means that there is no adsorption of LA on Ir metals. These results are in well accordance with the FT-IR results that LA are preferred to absorb on the SiC surface rather than Ru or Ir. The hydrogenation of LA to GVL can proceed via different intermediates, 4-hydroxypentanioc acid or α-angelicalactone, as shown in Scheme 1 . To confirm the reaction pathway of LA hydrogenation, α-angelicalactone was used as the reactant. LA on Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC can be completely hydrogenated into GVL with a GVL selectivity of 100 %. Under the same conditions, α-angelicalactone hydrogenation on the same catalyst can only achieve a conversion of 92 % (Table 3 ). This indicates that the addition reaction of hydrogen with C = O in LA is the key step. Therefore, the hydrogenation of LA into GVL is achieved via the intermediate of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid. According to the above results, a simple model is built to explain the hydrogenation process of LA over the Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst (Fig. 8 ). The Mott-Schottky contact between metals and SiC and the electron transfer from Ru to Ir nanoparticles collectively lead to electron-rich Ir nanoparticles, which have higher activity for the dissociation of H2. The dissociated hydrogen spills over to the SiC surface and reacts with levulinic acid adsorbed on SiC to produce γ-valerolactone."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, bimetallic Ru-Ir/SiC catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation. It is found that Ru0.5-Ir2.5/SiC catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid into γ-valerolactone under mild conditions. Compared with monometallic Ru or Ir catalysts, the bimetallic catalyst exhibits an evidently enhanced catalytic activity. The superior hydrogenation activity originates from the synergistic effect among Ru, Ir and SiC, which changes the electronic structure of the SiC surface. The present work reveals a synergistic effect of separated Ru and Ir nanoparticles on semiconducting SiC support and provides a green and efficient synthetic route for the production of γ-valerolactone under mild conditions."
