0,Introduction,"During last decades, much attention has been paid to hydrogen gas and its potential use as a fuel, since produces only harmless water when combusted, possesses a high energy yield (122kJ/g) and it could be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells (Lay et al., 1999; Benemann, 1996). Current hydrogen production methods can be largely divided into physico-chemical and biological methods. Among biological hydrogen production processes, fermentative production has been considered as a viable and effective method. This process occurs at ambient temperatures and pressures which are less energy-intensive and more environmental friendly (Lin et al., 2007). In such processes, it is well founded that carbohydrates are the main source of hydrogen and therefore wastes or agricultural residues rich in carbohydrates can be used as substrates (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). In general, glucose degradation gives, under anaerobic conditions, a variety of metabolic products, mainly volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic, propionic and butyric acid, lactic acid, butanol and ethanol, as well as hydrogen, depending on the microbial species present and the prevailing conditions. The highest maximal yield of 4mol H2 from one mole of glucose is produced in acetic acid fermentation (Hawkes et al., 2002) while the production of other, more reduced organic acids and/or alcohols lowers the yield of H2. For instance the conversion of one mole of glucose into butyrate is accompanied by the production of only 2mol of H2 while glucose conversion into propionic acid and ethanol lead to negative and zero yield of hydrogen, respectively. Moreover, the metabolism of glucose towards acetate may occur via a non-hydrogen yielding pathway where glucose is converted directly to acetic acid (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a). In mixed acid fermentation processes, the involved microorganisms may use more than only one pathway while converting glucose, which in turn implies lower than the maximum theoretical yields of hydrogen. Selection of pathway and consequently hydrogen and fermentation end-products production, is highly dependent on the conditions of the process, such as pH and HRT (Noike and Mizuno, 2000; Okamoto et al., 2000). One of the significant problems encountered in the fermentative hydrogen production process is that most of the organic fraction of the feeding wastewater remains as soluble fermentation products. Thus, a complementary stage after fermentation would be necessary for COD elimination. It is well known that VFAs formation during acidogenesis of the organic matter is actually the precursor to methanogenesis. Therefore, the hydrogen production process could be efficiently coupled with a subsequent anaerobic digestion step with the conversion of the remaining organic content to biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide), which may also be used as a fuel for the production of electricity. A two-stage anaerobic digestion process, in which acidogenesis and methanogenesis occur in separate reactors may offer several advantages, such as impoved digestibility of the wastewater (Kyazze et al., 2007) enhancing hydrogen and methane production and achieving stabilization of the treated wastewater prior to disposal (Ghosh et al., 1985). Cheese manufacturing industry generates large amounts of high strength wastewaters characterized by high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and COD concentrations. (Demirel et al., 2005; Farizoglu et al., 2004; Omil et al., 2003; Wust, 2003). The main contributors to the organic load of these wastes are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Cheese whey is a by-product during cheese manufacturing (Ferchichi et al., 2005; Kisaalita et al., 1987), which consists of lactose (45–50g/L), soluble proteins (6–8g/L), lipids (4–5g/L) and mineral salts (8–10% of dried extract). The mineral salts are comprised of NaCl and KCl (more than 50%), calcium salts (primarily phosphate) and others. Whey also contains appreciable quantities of lactic (0.5g/L) and citric acids, non-protein nitrogen compounds (urea and uric acid) and B group vitamins (Panesar et al., 2007; Siso, 1996). Whey as a by-product from the manufacture of hard, semi-hard or soft cheese, is known as sweet whey and has a pH of 5.9–6.6 while the manufacture of mineral–acid precipitated casein, yields acidic whey, with a pH of 4.3–4.6 (Bylund, 1995). Whey management has attracted more attention due to stricter legislation (Farizoglu et al., 2004) and for economic reasons (Yang et al., 2007). From a wastewater treatment point of view, anaerobic digestion of cheese whey offers an excellent approach. However, raw whey is known to be quite problematic to be treated anaerobically, because of its low bicarbonate alkalinity, high COD concentration and its tendency to get acidified very rapidly (Malaspina et al., 1996). Supplemental alkalinity is required so as to avoid acidification and subsequently anaerobic process failure (Lo and Liao, 1986; Wildenauer and Winter, 1985). Antonopoulou et al. (2008a) suggested that separation of the acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps in a two-stage anaerobic process could be an alternative solution for treating cheese whey. In their study, bio-hydrogen and subsequent methane generation were achieved at low HRTs, using a continuous bioreactor for the acidogenic stage and a high rate buffled bioreactor (Periodic Anaerobic Baffled Reactor) for the methanogenic stage, obtaining a wastewater COD reduction of 94% at an HRT of 4d. In this study, a two-stage continuous process was developed for the biological hydrogen production from cheese whey and the subsequent production of biogas. In the first stage, bio-hydrogen production was achieved using the indigenous mixed microbial culture already contained in the raw whey, a practice that has been applied and proposed by Antonopoulou et al. (2008a,b). The hydrogen producing reactor operated continuously (H2-CSTR) at an HRT of 24h and a pH of 5.2. For maintaining the pH at a constant value, two different tests were performed: manual alkalinity addition and the use of an automatic pH control system. In the second stage of the proposed process, a continuous anaerobic digester (CH4-CSTR) fed with the effluent of the H2-CSTR was operated anaerobically at an HRT of 20 days."
1,Methods,
2,Analytical methods,"2.1 Analytical methods Determinations of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (DCOD), total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), alkalinity and Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were carried out according to standard methods (APHA, 1975). Fats and oils were determined with the Soxhlet extraction method (APHA, 1975), while for total phosphorus (TP) determination, the persulfate digestion method and the ascorbic acid method (APHA, 1975) were used. For the quantification of VFAs and alcohols, 1mL of sample acidified with 30μL of 20% H2SO4 was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (VARIAN CP-30), equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (Agilent technologies, INC. 30m×0.53mm) and an autosampler (VARIAN CP-4800). The oven was programmed from 105 to 160°C at a rate of 15°C/min, and subsequently to 235°C (held for 3min) at a rate of 20°C/min for VFAs analysis and from 60°C (held for 1min) to 230°C (held for 0.5min) at a rate of 45°C /min for alcohols analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 15mL/min, the injector temperature was set at 175°C and the detector at 225 and 200°C, for VFAs and alcohols determinations, respectively. The produced hydrogen and methane were quantified with a gas chromatograph (VARIAN STAR 3600) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column (Poropak Q, 80/100-mesh) with nitrogen as carrier gas. The injector, column and detector temperatures were set at 70, 80 and 180°C, respectively. The measurement of the produced gas volume was defined with an acidified water displacement device. For the determination of carbohydrates, L-tryptophan, sulfuric and boric acids were added to the samples, and were then measured colorimetrically at 520nm (Joseffson, 1983). D- and L-lactic acids were determined using the enzymatic reagent kit (Megazyme D-/L-Lactic acid kit, K-DLATE 10/05). The measurement of the pH was done using a HANNA (pH 211) pH-meter with a HANNA (HI 1230) electrode."
3,Wastewater,"2.2 Wastewater Cheese whey used as feed for the hydrogenogenic reactor was obtained from a local cheese producing factory, located in Achaia prefecture, nearby the city of Patras, in Western Greece. The wastewater was received from the factory in batches, was stored at −20°C and was thawed before use. The average characteristics of the cheese whey obtained from the different batches are shown in Table 1 . From Table 1 it is seen that the wastewater mainly consisted of carbohydrates, which are an ideal substrate for fermentative hydrogen production. VFAs, ethanol, butanol as well as lactic acid were not detected at all in the raw cheese whey."
4,Experiments for hydrogen production,"2.3 Experiments for hydrogen production A 500mL active volume mesophilic (35°C) CSTR-type digester (H2-CSTR) was started-up and fed with cheese whey. The reactor was made of stainless steel, cylindrical in shape, and was stirred continuously. It was operated anaerobically at an HRT of 24h. For start-up, the reactor was filled with undiluted cheese whey with an added alkalinity of 20g/L NaHCO3, and was operated anaerobically at a batch mode for 24h at 35°C in order to activate the indigenous microflora contained in the wastewater (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a,b). After start-up, the operation of the hydrogen producing reactor was subsequently switched to a continuous mode. Due to the low alkalinity of cheese whey, an adjustment of pH was necessary in order to maintain the pH of H2-CSTR in the range of 5–6 allowing hydrogen production (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a). This was done either by alkalinity addition in the feeding wastewater or by placing a pH controller at H2-CSTR. In the first case, 20g NaHCO3 per liter cheese whey was manually added to the raw whey (alkalinity controlled experiment), while in the second case a pH controller (Black Stone, BL-931700-1) equipped with an industrial flat-tip pH electrode (HANNA HI61004) was directly attached to the reactor, regulated the H2-CSTR pH at 5.2 through a dosing pump (HANNA, BL 1.5) providing a solution of NaOH 2N (pH controlled experiment). The reactor was fed intermittently for 1min, every 3h with cheese whey maintained at a temperature below 4°C. Simultaneous flow of the effluent occurred during feeding by liquid overflow, in order to maintain constant reactor volume. As a result, a portion of the wastewater fed was removed with the effluent, and the initial concentration of carbohydrates for every feeding cycle, may be calculated according to the following equation: (1) S = S 0 - ( S 0 - S in ) × e - ( Q / V ) × t where S is the resulting concentration when feeding was completed, S 0 is the influent concentration, S in is the concentration when feeding started, namely the concentration measured at the end of each cycle, Q is the volumetric feeding rate, V is the reactor volume and t is the duration of feeding. Gas and liquid samples were taken 10–15min before feeding started. The reactor performance (biogas production and composition in H2, pH, carbohydrates, soluble COD, ethanol, butanol, L- and D-lactic acid and VFAs concentration) was monitored daily throughout the experimental period. Gas samples were analyzed for methane often, in order to monitor whether methane production was taking place. Complete characterization of the reactor effluent was made once a steady state was reached. By steady state, it is meant, that the variation of the monitoring parameters in time was less than 10%."
5,Experiments for methane production,"2.4 Experiments for methane production A 3L active volume mesophilic (35°C) CSTR-type digester (CH4-CSTR) was started-up using mixed anaerobic sludge obtained from the municipal biological treatment plant of the city of Patras, in Greece. The anaerobic digester fed with the effluent from the H2-CSTR from the alkalinity controlled experiment and was operated anaerobically at an HRT of 20 days. It should be noted, that the two reactors were not connected but the effluent of the hydrogenogenic stage was collected, homogenized and preserved at -20°C before use. The digester had the same structural and operational characteristics with the H2-CSTR and was fed intermittently for 1min every 8h. The reactor performance (biogas production and composition in CH4, pH, soluble COD and VFAs concentration) was monitored 3–4 times a week and complete characterization of the reactor effluent was made when steady state was reached."
6,Results,
7,Experiments for hydrogen production,"3.1 Experiments for hydrogen production The H2-CSTR operated at an HRT of 24h with an influent flow rate of 0.5L/d which corresponds to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 30g COD/d. It is well known that the pH is among the critical factors for the optimal production of hydrogen through fermentative processes. In the literature, several studies have been made regarding the optimal pH range giving inconsistent results. Kisaalita et al. (1987) proposed that the optimum pH range for lactose (or whey) acidogenesis is between 6 and 6.5 while Kyazze et al. (2007), Lay (2000) and Fang and Liu (2002) reported that maximum hydrogen yields are obtained when the pH of the culture medium is between 5 and 6. In a previous study we found that when the pH in the reactor was maintained at 5.2±0.1, then the hydrogen in the gas phase at concentration higher than 25% was measured (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a). At this study, a gas phase rich in hydrogen was achieved either by adding manually NaHCO3 in the raw whey at a concentration of 20g/L (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a) or by placing an automatic pH controller system adjusting bioreactor pH at 5.2. The evolution of biogas and hydrogen versus time in both experiments is presented in Fig. 1 . It should be noted that during the operation of the hydrogenogenic reactor no traces of methane were detected at any time, indicating the lack of methanogens in the acidogenic stage. In the alkalinity controlled experiment, the percentage of hydrogen in the gas phase at steady state was 23.8±0.7% and the rate of hydrogen production was 1.45 LH2/d (or 2.9±0.1 LH2/Lreactor/d). In the pH controlled experiment, the percentage of hydrogen in the gas phase at steady state was 32.0±1.9%, while the hydrogen production rate was 0.96 LH2/d (or 1.92±0.10 LH2/Lreactor/d). In the alkalinity controlled experiment, the biogas production rate was significantly higher compared to the pH controlled experiment (6.1L biogas/d contrary to 3L biogas/d, respectively) due to the fact that the addition of NaHCO3 in the feeding wastewater produced large amounts of CO2, increasing the volume of total biogas. For both experiments, the obtained values for hydrogen and biogas production rates were comparable with the respective values reported by Antonopoulou et al. (2008a), where 2.51±0.43 LH2/Lreactor/d) were produced using undiluted cheese whey as substrate at an HRT of 24h. In Table 2 the main characteristics of the reactor at each steady state are presented. According to the table values, TSS and VSS concentrations were 10.8±0.7 and 9.7±0.3g/L for the alkalinity controlled experiment and 9.4±0.4 and 8.1±0.8g/L respectively, for the pH controlled experiment. This variation was probably due to the different characteristics of the feeding wastewater, since the experiments were not performed using cheese whey obtained from the same batch. In both experiments, the main microbial products among metabolites measured were butyric and acetic acids as well as ethanol and lactic acid. Butanol, as well as propionic, isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acids were not detected at all (Table 2). At the alkalinity controlled experiment, the dominant metabolic products were acetic (9.20±1.00g/L) and butyric acids (14.50±1.30g/L) while small amounts of lactic acid (1.20±0.30g/L) and ethanol (0.25±0.04g/L) were also produced. At the pH controlled experiment, the concentrations of the respective products measured, were remarkably lower. The concentration of butyric acid was 8.04±0.70g/L while acetic acid concentration was 6.23±0.40g/L. Lactic acid and ethanol production stayed at low levels. In the study of Antonopoulou et al. (2008a), acetic acid was reported to be the dominant metabolic product (9.394±0.544g/L), followed by lactic acid (7.543±0.450g/L) and butyric acid (7.199±0.650g/L). The observation regarding the different distribution of the end metabolic products, when the H2-CSTR operates at the same HRT, could be attributed to the different characteristics (such as microbial charge, content in carbohydrates, proteins) of the feeding wastewater at different batches. It is well known that cheese whey contains microorganisms which have remained after the cheese making process (Bylund, 1995). Since the start-up of the reactor was carried out using the indigenous microbial cultures contained in raw cheese whey without any treatment, the metabolic products as well as the final hydrogen production depended on the dominant microbial species contained in the whey and on the final pathway they followed under the prevailing conditions. At steady state, the calculated COD concentration, which corresponded to the sum of the different metabolic products (ethanol and lactic, butyric, and acetic acids) as well as the residual non-consumed carbohydrates, expressed in terms of COD was equal to 44.5±3.0 and 34.1±2.7g COD/L, respectively for the two different experiments. In the alkalinity controlled experiment, the calculated COD concentration accounted for 89% of the measured COD concentration (50.1±2.1g COD/L), while the respective value for the pH controlled experiment was only 68%. In any case, it can be assumed that not all of the metabolic products from the cheese whey fermentation were determined and especially in the pH controlled experiment there was another undetected metabolic product with high contribution to the soluble COD value. Such products could be either soluble proteins or amino-acids contained in raw cheese whey and not hydrolyzed at this short HRT. The efficiency of total carbohydrates consumption in glucose equivalents was 86% in the alkalinity controlled experiment, since the concentration of carbohydrates in the feed was 43.8±3.1g/L and the respective concentration in the mixed liquor was 6.1±2.3g/L. In the pH controlled experiment, the respective efficiency was calculated equal to 76%, since 10.7±2.8g/L carbohydrates were not consumed and remained in the mixed liquor. Based on the above observations, the yield of hydrogen produced per mole of glucose consumed was approximately 0.78±0.05 for the alkalinity controlled experiment and 0.61±0.04mol H2/mol glucose consumed for the pH controlled experiment, respectively. These values were significantly lower than the theoretical yields of 4 and 2mol H2/mol glucose for acetic and butyric acid production respectively. In general, lower than maximum theoretical hydrogen yields were due to the competing reactions, which were carried out simultaneously under fermentative conditions. Production of various end metabolic products justified the above claims. Consequently a mixed acid fermentation occurred upon biological degradation of carbohydrates contained in raw cheese whey resulting low obtained yields of hydrogen production. This yield varied proportionally to the concentration of the individual metabolic products. In the alkalinity controlled experiment, the production of acetic and butyric acid, which in general favour hydrogen production, was higher compared to the respective values for the pH controlled experiment, resulting in higher yield of hydrogen."
8,Experiments for methane production,"3.2 Experiments for methane production The mean values of the main characteristics of the CH4-CSTR feed, which was the effluent from H2-CSTR from the alkalinity controlled experiment, after collection, homogenization and preservation at −20°C, are presented in Table 1. The influent of the methanogenic reactor was rich in VFAs from the acidification stage of cheese whey processing, with the concentration of soluble carbohydrates being almost negligible compared to the COD concentration. The digester was operated at an HRT of 20 days for about 80 days (which corresponded to four HRTs), with an influent flow rate of 150mL/d. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of biogas and methane produced throughout the experimental period while the main characteristics of the CH4-CSTR at steady state are presented in Table 1. The methane production rate reached approximately 1L CH4/d (147mL CH4/g VSS) giving a yield of 6.7L CH4/L of influent. Because of NaHCO3 addition at the first acidogenic stage, the alkalinity concentration of the CH4-CSTR was at high levels (approximately 12,750mg CaCO3/L). The methanogens, though, seemed to adapt to these conditions and produced biogas. The reactor performance was stable with acetic and butyric acids remaining at low levels, while ethanol and propionic acid were not detected. The percentage of DCOD removal was approximately 95.3% since a concentration of 2.2±1.5g COD/L remained in the effluent implying that further HRT reduction would lead to higher VFAs accumulation and deterioration of the COD removal efficiency. In general, long HRT values (5–20 days) are used in studies on anaerobic treatment of undiluted cheese whey to overcome the potential instability problems and the failure of the process (Ergüder et al., 2001) because of its rapid acidification tendency. For this reason, alkalinity addition is necessary. Ghaly (1996) operating a 155L digester with acidic cheese whey, under mesophilic conditions and at an HRT of 20d, produced 8L CH4/d without pH control while the productivity reached 87.5L CH4/d with pH control."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, the possibility of biological hydrogen production from cheese whey and subsequent methane generation from the effluent of the hydrogenogenic process was investigated. Continuous fermentative hydrogen production was carried out at an HRT of 24h, in mesophilic conditions. Alkalinity addition or the use of an automatic pH controller was performed, to maintain the pH culture at a constant value of 5.2. With alkalinity addition, hydrogen production rate was 2.9±0.2L/Lreactor/d, while the yield of hydrogen produced was approximately 0.78±0.05mol H2/mol glucose consumed. This yield corresponded to the production of 2.9L of H2/L cheese whey. At pH controlling experiment, the hydrogen production rate was 1.9±0.1L/Lreactor/d, while the yield of hydrogen was 0.61±0.04mol H2/mol glucose consumed, corresponding to the production of 1.9L of H2/L cheese whey. The distribution of the metabolic products was different in both experiments and was proved to be sensitive to the feed characteristics and the applied method of maintaining the pH. However, the hydrogen production rate seemed to be less sensitive. Further conversion of the effluent of the hydrogenogenic reactor to methane was conducted in a continuous anaerobic digester, operating at an HRT of 20d in mesophilic conditions. The anaerobic digester produced approximately 1L CH4/d, corresponding to a yield of 6.7L CH4/L of influent and a percentage of COD removal of approximately 95.3%."
