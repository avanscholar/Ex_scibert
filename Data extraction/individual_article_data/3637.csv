0,Introduction,"In the search of alternative energy sources, a considerable amount of attention is being given to hydrogen [1–3]. Hydrogen is attractive, because it promises negligible environmental pollution impacts compared to the burning of petroleum products [4,5]. Besides, hydrogen does not suffer from many of the problems associated with liquid fuel, such as cold wall quenching inadequate vaporization, poor mixing and so forth. Unfortunately, providing a pure and practical source of hydrogen has posed a greater concern though, hydrogen is most abundantly available on the earth [6,7]. Presently, efforts are being made to utilize solar radiation to split water for hydrogen production but its commercialization is not likely in near future. At present, hydrogen is produced efficiently in large scale by reforming of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and hydrocarbons of low carbon number [8–11]. Steam reforming is the most preferred process for hydrocarbons of lower carbon numbers. However due to a tendency of formation of coke, the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) process is advantageous for higher carbon no. hydrocarbons. In presence of oxygen, the coke formation is less likely as compared to that in the steam reforming. Oxidative steam reforming (OSR) also has a high thermal efficiency and dynamics during transient operation as well as lower system complexity [12,13]. Assuming that the products are only CO2 and H2, the general reaction formula for OSR, using air as the oxygen source, can be expressed as follows: (1) C n H m + x ( O 2 + 3.76 N 2 ) + 2 ( n − x ) H 2 O → nC O 2 + 2 ( n − x + m / 4 ) H 2 + 3.76 x N 2 The heat generated in the above reaction can be controlled directly by adjusting the proportions of fuel, air, and steam in the feed [14]. For the success of hydrogen economy, it is essential that apart from natural gas & naphtha, cheap sources should be explored and suitable technologies be developed. In this regard, vacuum residue (residue obtained after vacuum distillation of petroleum crude) could also be a suitable choice for its conversion to hydrogen. However none of the catalytic processes (steam reforming, partial oxidation, oxidative steam reforming, etc.) has been successfully applied because of high aromaticity of residue which are coke precursors and form coke at a temperature ∼673 K much lower that the temperature (1073–1173 K) required for any of the catalytic process to take place [15]. A limited number of works have been reported in the literature where higher carbon number (C12–C16) hydrocarbons have been attempted. It has been reported that the reforming or OSR of higher hydrocarbons, e.g. diesel, was difficult because of the refractory nature of the compounds present in diesel fractions [16]. The main problems were related to the degradation of catalysts over time due to the harsh operating conditions. The causes of degradation included the poisoning of the catalysts by sulphur, thermal sintering and extensive coke formation due to the low H: C ratio and decomposition of diesel by thermal cracking [17]. In an attempt to produce hydrogen from vacuum residue, we have developed a two-step process. In the first step, the residue was reacted in the liquid phase with ozone to get oxidized and cracked products. In the second-step the product obtained after ozonolysis was subjected to catalytic oxidative steam reforming (OSR) for the production of hydrogen. The first step of the process has been already reported [18]. In the present paper we describe the second step. Effects of the reaction temperature, the steam to carbon (S/C), and the oxygen to carbon (O2/C) molar ratios and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) were investigated. Activation and deactivation studies were also studied. Catalysts were characterized to investigate the changes in microstructure."
1,Experimental method,"In the first step of the process, the vacuum residue having the characteristics as shown in Table 1 was used. The detailed process is described elsewhere [18]. The vacuum distillation of vacuum residue and ozonolysed vacuum residue yielded distillates having volumes 10 & 40 mL respectively for 100 mL of vacuum residue. The distillate of the vacuum residue (VR) and ozonolysed vacuum residue (OVR) had the elemental analysis as given in Table 2 [18]. The VR and the OVR were also analyzed by GC–MS. The wt % of different types of hydrocarbons present in VR and OVR are reported in Table 3 . The compounds were categorized into different groups, i.e. C5–C10, C11–C15 and C15+ groups, with carbon number 5 to 10, 11 to 15 and greater than 15 respectively. Further in each category, the compounds were also grouped as aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic. Though some of the heterocyclic compounds (O atom present in ring) were aromatic also but such compounds have been considered as heterocyclic compounds, only. Compounds were also categorized on the basis of functional groups present as shown in Table 4 . Some of the compounds bear more than one functional groups, therefore these were categorized according to the following functional group priority order: Carbonyl > Alcohol > Ether > Ester. It is in order to mention that no oxygenated functional group was detected in VR. In our earlier communication [18], we have reported that a comparison of results of OSR of VR and OVR showed a better conversion of OVR to hydrogen and also a better catalyst life. Therefore, further experiments were carried out to study the oxidative steam reforming of OVR."
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A high surface area aluminum hydroxide gel was prepared by neutralizing a concentrated solution of aluminum nitrate with ammonia solution at pH 9 and temperature 303 K. The hydro gel was aged for 24 h and then washed with distilled water until it was free of nitrate ions. Finally, it was dried in oven at 383 K and then calcined at 1073 K each for 8 h to obtain γ-Al2O3 support [19]. The γ-Al2O3 support was crushed and sieved to a particle size ∼0.20 mm. The alumina was impregnated with the requisite amount of a dilute aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate [La(NO3)3.6H2O, 99.0% (Central Drug House (P)ltd.] to yield 3 wt % La2O3 in the final catalyst. This concentration was selected as it has been reported to be optimal in stabilizing the surface area of alumina against sintering [20]. The mixture was then dried over a water bath with continuous stirring and finally dried in oven at 383 K and calcined at 1073 K each for 8 h. Ceria was then incorporated into lanthana-supported alumina by impregnation with the requisite amount of a dilute nitric acid solution of Cerium (IV) sulfate tetrahydrate (99+ % Acros Organic) to obtain solids containing 9 wt. % CeO2. The mixture was then dried over a water bath with continuous stirring and then dried in oven at 383 K and calcined at 873 K each for 8 h. Platinum was then incorporated in the stabilized alumina– lanthana–ceria (A–L–C) support. Platinum (2% wt.) was introduced by wet impregnation using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (41.29% wt. Pt Johnson Matthey, USA) in appropriate amount. The mass was dried at 353 K at water bath with continuous stirring and then in oven at 383 K and finally at 773 K each for 8 h. Catalyst pellets were made of required size and catalyst was reduced in situ in the reactor at 623 K with 20 ml/min hydrogen flow for 4 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,2.2 Catalyst characterization Surface area and pore size distribution of catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique using Micromeritics (USA) model ASAP 2020 instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a diffractometer (Riggku D/Max-3B) with Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 1.542 Å for the analysis of the crystal phases and the crystallite sizes in supports and catalysts. Crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer equation. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts was determined by thermo gravimetric analysis in air using a Thermo gravimetric analyzer (make Perkin Elmer with Pyris Diamond software). The sample temperature was raised from 373 to 1473 K at a rate of 50 K min−1.
4,Activation and deactivation studies,"2.3 Activation and deactivation studies The schematic diagram of experimental set up used in the present study has been shown in our earlier paper [18]. Essentially, it consisted of a tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 30 mm and length 800 mm). The reactor was kept inside a temperature- controlled tubular electric furnace (Thermolyne, USA 79300). Ozonolysed vacuum residue (feed) and water were injected into the reactor separately through calibrated pumps (Fluid Metering Inc, USA, Model RHSY) at desired flow rates while oxygen was supplied through a pressurized tank and its flow rate was controlled and measured using a mass flow controller. Double distilled water was used in all the experiments. The water at a calculated rate first entered a pre-vaporizer, kept at a temperature of 423 K approximately. Oxygen also entered the pre-vaporizer and it swept away steam to the reactor from the top. Feed also entered at the top of the reactor. The bottom section of reactor was filled with inert alumina particles of size 3–4 mm (height ∼ 200 mm). Catalyst particles were placed in the middle section and finally there was a ∼10 mm height alumina bed at the top for preheating the reactants. The catalyst particles were of size ∼ 4 mm. The catalyst particles were diluted with alumina (dp ∼ 4 mm, Al2O3/Catalyst = 6 v/v) to avoid preferential gas flow path and hot spot in the catalytic bed. The height of catalyst bed was 40 mm. In each test, fresh catalyst sample was used. Temperature of the catalytic bed was monitored with a thermocouple sliding inside the thermocouple well into the catalytic bed. All the data were collected when the temperature became constant at the desired value for at least 30min with a deviation of less than ±5 K. The product gas was allowed to flow through a water condenser and the volume of gas produced was measured by a wet gas flow meter. The product gas was analyzed using an Orsat apparatus for CO, CO2, and O2. A Nucon make GC was used to analyze the product gas for H2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons. The effect of reaction temperature was studied at constant feed condition of reactants which corresponded to S/C = 4, O2/C = 0.4 and WHSV = 3.27 h−1. The effect of S/C was investigated at 1173 K and constant O2/C = 0.4. The effect of O2/C was investigated at 1173 K and constant S/C = 4. The effect of WHSV was investigated at 1173 K between 1.64 to 6.55 h−1 by varying amount of catalyst at constant feed condition of reactants S/C = 4 and O2/C = 0.5."
5,Results and discussion,"In the present work conversion to gaseous product of feed has been calculated as Conversion ( % ) = Total number of carbon in CO , C O 2 and C H 4 in product Carbon number in feed × 100"
6,Effect of temperature,"3.1 Effect of temperature The reaction was studied between temperature 973 and 1273 K. The constant feed condition of reactants corresponded to S/C = 4, O2/C = 0.4 and WHSV = 3.27 h−1. WHSV was defined as, weight of feed/(weight of catalyst. Time (h)). It has been reported in literature [21] that higher S/C ratio (stiochiometric value >1) facilitates coke gasification Eq. (2) and thus the coke deposition over the catalyst surface is minimized. (2) C + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 H 2 Therefore, experiments were carried out at a higher S/C ratio and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . It is observed from the above figure that a rise in temperature from 973 to 1173 K, conversion increased from 64.6 to 76.8. However on further increase in temperature, the conversion decreased and reached to 74.9% at 1273 K. Gas production rate followed the same trend. In the literature it has been reported that conversion increases with temperature but the reported results are for lower molecular weight hydrocarbons [13,22]. Our results are in contrary to the above reported results. It may be that at higher temperatures (>1173 K) coke formation predominated steam reforming reaction leading to deactivation of catalyst and consequently the lower conversion. Fig. 2 shows the effect of temperature on product gas composition. The product primarily consisted of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. No carbon monoxide was detected in the product. It may be due to the fact that the feed, instead of hydrocarbons, was partially oxygenated hydrocarbons. Also, reforming reactions were carried out in presence of oxygen and steam both. Since steam was in excess, it may have reacted with carbon monoxide to form hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2). It is also observed that at all the temperatures oxygen conversion was 100%. The oxygen conversion is based on the oxygen present in the feed in the form of oxygen gas. Other species (other than CO2, H2, CH4, O2 and CO) were present at very low concentrations and these could not be identified. Vol % of these species were obtained by subtracting the sum of vol%’s of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (if any) from 100. From the Fig. 2 it is observed that with increase in reaction temperature from 973 to 1173 K concentration of hydrogen increased gradually to 64.4% and thereafter it remained almost constant. The concentration of CO2 showed the similar trend. However on the other hand with increase in temperature from 973 to 1173 K, CH4 vol% decreased from 28.2 to 12.1On further increase in temperature CH4 vol% increased to 13.5%. It has been reported that [9] during reforming higher hydrocarbons first adsorb irreversibly on the metal sites and then cleavage of C–C bonds take place, one by one until the hydrocarbons are converted into C1 components. Therefore, it is likely that methane is an intermediated product of reforming of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons which may be converted to CO2 and H2. Increase in CH4 vol% attributed to dissociation of higher oxygenated hydrocarbons, which were favored at higher temperature (CnHmOp → CH4 + Cn−1Hm−4Op)."
7,Effects of S/C,"3.2 Effects of S/C An increase in S/C was predicted to inhibit coke formation on the catalyst. Therefore, the effect of S/C was investigated at 1173 K (reaction temperature at which concentration of hydrogen was highest) and constant O2/C = 0.4. Fig. 3 shows the result. It can be seen from the Fig. 3 that the both conversion and product gas volume increased with an increase in S/C ratios from 2 to 5, and on further increase these level off. The increase in conversion with S/C is attributed to the fact that a higher ratio of steam to carbon prevents formation of coke. The product gases compositions as a function of S/C ratios at 1173 K have been shown in Fig. 4 . It is observed from the Fig. 4 that with the increase of S/C ratio, vol% of hydrogen and CO2 increased and CH4 decreased. Increase in S/C ratio, the formation of synthesis gas and water gas shift (WGS) reaction is favored which would result in an increase in CO2 and H2 concentrations and decrease in CH4 concentration. Increase in S/C ratio also enhances the coke gasification reaction Eq. (2) and consequently increasing hydrogen production. The similar result has been reported in literature for hexadecane oxidative reforming [23]. Usually high S/C ratio could help prevent carbon deposition on the catalyst but too high a value of S/C ratio will obviously compromise the gross energy efficiency for it shall be difficult to recover the residual heat. Therefore, we have limited our study to S/C ≤ 6."
8,Effect of O2/C,"3.3 Effect of O2/C It is seen from the Fig. 3 that with the increase in the S/C ratio conversion increased. But it could not completely inhibit coke formation (conversion ∼ 100). Therefore, the effect of O2/C (0.2–0.8) on conversion at 1173 K at a constant S/C of 4 was investigated. The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . Form Fig. 5, it is observed that conversion increased with the increase in O2/C ratio. However product gas volume showed a different behavior. It increased from 12.8 to 15.1 L/h with increase in O2/C ratio from 0.2 to 0.5. But on further increase in O2/C the gas volume decreased to 14.6 L/h. It is in order to mention that in the literature [23] it has been reported that at O2/C ratio less than 0.5, partial oxidation of hydrocarbon takes place but at higher ratios combustion of hydrocarbons becomes predominant resulting into formation of water and carbon dioxide. Therefore, on increasing O2/C greater than 0.5, decrease in gas volume is attributed to the formation of combustion products which includes condensed water. Souza et al. [24] have also reported a similar result in oxidative reforming of methane. They have reported that the increase in O2/CH4 feed ratio resulted into an increase in the conversion and also the deposition of carbonaceous residues over the catalytic surface was minimized. It is observed from the Fig. 6 that hydrogen vol % in the product increased when O2/C was increased from 0.2 to 0.5 but any further increase had an adverse effect on hydrogen vol%. Further, with the increase in O2/C ratio carbon dioxide vol% increased and methane vol% decreased. It is also observed from the figure that at low value of O2/C (<0.3) carbon monoxide was detected in the product. However, its concentration was always below 1%. Therefore it is concluded that increasing O2/C from 0.2 to 0.5 the partial oxidation of feed takes place resulting into increased hydrogen vol % on further increase complete oxidation reaction become predominant leading to higher CO2 concentration and lower hydrogen concentration (Eq. (3)). (3) C n H m O p + ( n + m / 2 − p / 2 ) O 2 → nC O 2 + m / 2 H 2 O At O2/C greater than 0.5 lowering of methane concentration is also attributed to the combustion resulting higher CO2 concentration. Kopasz et al. [25] have also reported a similar result in oxidative reforming of diesel. They have reported that at constant S/C = 2.0 the hydrogen content increased to a maximum at an O2/C of 0.45, then it decreased as additional oxygen began to decrease the selectivity and oxidized hydrogen to water."
9,Effect of weight hourly space velocities (WHSV),"3.4 Effect of weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) The effect of WHSV was investigated at constant flow and composition of the feed (molar ratio C/O2/H2O = 1:0.5:4) at 1173 K. The WHSV was varied between 1.64 and 6.55 h−1 by varying amount of catalyst. The results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . It is observed that conversion as well as product gas volume decreases on increasing WHSV. It is obvious that an increase in WHSV would decrease contact time between reactants and catalyst, resulting in a decreased conversion. From the Fig. 8 it is observed that on decreasing the WHSV H2, CO2 vol% increased whereas CH4 decreased. At WHSV 6.55 h−1 the hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were 61.2, 21.0 and 14.6% whereas their values change to 65.2, 22.6 and 10.7% respectively at WHSV of 1.64 h−1. At lower value of WHSV reforming reaction predominated over thermal cracking reaction, leading to higher concentrations hydrogen and carbon dioxide."
10,Deactivation and regeneration studies,"3.5 Deactivation and regeneration studies The deactivation pattern of the catalyst was studied at S/C = 4, O2/C = 0.5, WHSV = 3.27 h−1 and 1173 K. The effect of prolonged use on the conversion is given in Fig. 9 . The conversion on the fresh catalyst decreased from 77 to 62.8% within 8 h of run. The deactivation of catalyst is considered to be due to coke deposition on the active sites. The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by blowing oxygen through the bed of deactivated catalyst at 1173 K for 4 h. The conversion on regenerated catalyst is also shown in Fig. 9. It is observed that the activity of catalyst is largely regained on regeneration. It can also be noticed from the above figure that product gas volumetric rate also decreased with time on stream due to deactivation of catalyst. Gas production rate over regenerated catalyst followed the same trend with lower values. Product gas distribution over fresh catalyst and regenerated catalysts with time on stream are given in Figs. 10 and 11 respectively. It can be noticed from the above figures that the compositions of product gas remained almost constant on both fresh and regenerated catalysts. The results of three repeated cycles are nearly same over the regenerated catalyst (not shown in Fig. 9)."
11,Characterization,"3.6 Characterization 3.6.1 Surface area and pore size analysis The results of BET surface areas of γ-Al2O3 support, fresh, deactivated and regenerated catalysts are given in Table 5 . The cumulative pore volume curves are shown in Fig. 12 and the pore size distributions are given in Table 6 . It is observed that γ-Al2O3 support has surface area of 290 m2/g whereas that of the fresh catalyst was 70 m2/g only. However, the change in total pore volume is only marginal. The alumina support has total pore volume of 0.35 cm3/g in comparison the fresh catalyst has 0.28 cm3/g. Another observation is that, the alumina has a significant number of pores of radius less than 60 Å; whereas the maximum in the pore size distribution for fresh catalyst is between 100 and 200 Å. From the above observations, it is concluded that, during the preparation of catalyst, the smaller pores of alumina have, collapsed and pores of larger sizes have been formed. The loss in the surface area (fresh catalyst in comparison to the support) is largely attributed to the above conclusion. It is also observed from the Table 5, that the deactivated catalyst having 10% lower surface area compares with fresh catalyst. The change in total pore volume of used catalyst in comparison to the fresh catalyst is only marginal but pores of the used catalyst are of smaller radii. Therefore, it is concluded that pore mouth blocking of the catalyst may not be the cause of deactivation of catalyst. Instead the coke has deposited inside the pores of catalyst and that has resulted into the deactivation of catalyst. Wang et al. [26] have also reported a similar result in oxidative reforming of mixture of hydrocarbons over Ni-Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. They have reported that used catalyst having ∼6% lower surface area compared with fresh catalyst as a result of carbon formation on the catalyst surface. It is further observed that regenerated catalyst has nearly same surface area, pore size and pore size distribution as compared with the fresh catalyst. It suggests that the deposited coke on the used sample of catalyst is largely removed by blowing air/oxygen for 4 h at 1173 K. 3.6.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD patterns of γ-Al2O3, fresh, deactivated and regenerated catalysts are shown in Fig. 13 . The d values (interplanar spacing) for every peak of the support and catalysts were calculated applying the Bragg’s law and compared (Table 7 ) with the standard values reported for γ-Al2O3, CeO2 and Pt metal. The absence of diffraction peaks of La2O3 in all the samples indicates a high dispersion of lanthanum oxide in the fresh, the used and the regenerated catalysts. Diffraction lines of γ-Al2O3, CeO2, Pt phases were observed in the catalysts. Further there were number of unidentified peaks in the used sample of catalysts which may be of polycrystalline coke. Among them, diffraction peaks at d spacing 2.18, 2.10, 2.08 and 2.02 correspond to carbon (JCPDS 26-1081). These peaks disappear when the catalyst was regenerated. From XRD patterns it is also observed that γ- alumina support was largely amorphous in nature but sharp peaks of γ- alumina are observed in the catalysts. Crystallite sizes of γ- alumina, Pt and CeO2 were calculated by application of the Scherer equation and are shown in Table 8 . Peaks corresponding to its d- values of 1.39 (for γ- alumina), 2.26 (for Pt) and 3.12 (for CeO2) were analyzed. The results show a negligible sintering of Pt but γ-Al2O3 and CeO2 experience a small amount of crystallite growth on use. 3.6.3 Thermo gravimetric studies Thermo gravimetric analysis of the used catalyst after 8 h of reaction was carried out to estimate the amount of coke deposited by the weight loss due to oxidation of coke in air (Fig. 14 ). It is seen from the fig that the weight loss started at 753 K and continued to 973 K. The total weight loss of 4.2% was observed. This loss is attributed to the removal of coke from the catalyst. Therefore the deactivation of catalyst is primarily related to the deposition of coke over and inside the catalyst. It also shows that 973 K is sufficient for the regeneration of catalyst when oxygen is blown over the deactivated catalyst bed."
12,Conclusions,"The activity of alumina-supported Pt catalyst promoted with ceria and lanthana for oxidative steam reforming of ozonolysed vacuum residue distillate was examined in a fix bed reactor. At constant reaction condition (S/C = 4 and O2/C = 0.4) the rise in temperature from 973 to 1173 K conversion and product gas volume increases and on further increase decreases. At higher temperature coke formation predominates over steam reforming consequently the lower conversion. The S/C and the O2/C molar ratios were observed to be crucial factors for oxidative steam reforming. With the rise in S/C, conversion and product gas volume enhanced and levelled off at high ratios. Increase in S/C cannot completely inhibit coke formation. In addition, with increase in O2/C, conversion increased. However product gas volume and hydrogen vol% exhibited maxima. For O2/C ratio greater than 0.5, total combustion of hydrocarbons took place resulting in formation of water and carbon dioxide. The deactivation of catalyst activity was observed in the long-term test. This is ascribed to the deposition of coke primarily in the inside catalyst. Almost complete regeneration of used catalyst was possible by blowing oxygen over the catalytic bed at 1173 K."
