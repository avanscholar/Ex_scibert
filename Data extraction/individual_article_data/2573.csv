0,Introduction,"Cheese whey is a yellowish liquid resulting from the coprecipitation and removal of milk casein in cheese making processes. On average, for the production of 1kg of cheese 10kg of milk are used, which produces 9kg of cheese whey as a by-product. This is equivalent to 5million tons a year of whey worldwide. Some of the most important components of whey are lactose and soluble proteins. Typically, cheese whey contains 4.5–6wt.% lactose, 0.6–1.1wt.% proteins, 0.8–1wt.% minerals, 0.05–0.9wt.% lactic acid, 0.06–0.5wt.% fats and 93–94wt.% of water [1–4]. This effluent produced by the cheese industry has BOD and COD values ranging from 27–60kg/m3 and 50–102kg/m3, respectively. Therefore, it should not be directly discharged into the environment without appropriate treatment and/or valorisation [3]. In the past, most cheese factories released their effluents onto land or discharged them into rivers, lakes and/or oceans without any pre-treatment. However, as a result of environmental concerns and stricter regulations, cheese effluent management has become an important issue [1–4]. In this context, two different options for cheese whey management have normally been considered [3]. The first is the application of filtration technologies and physicochemical treatments such as coagulation–flocculation. These technologies aim to recover the most valuable compounds from cheese whey such as proteins and lactose. Filtration technologies can be used to separate lactose and proteins from whey [3]. Ultrafiltration membranes can be used to separate proteins and reverse osmosis to increase the lactose concentration in order to facilitate the evaporation of water and the crystallisation of lactose [2]. Physicochemical treatments include thermal and isoelectric precipitation [5,6], as well as protein precipitation with coagulant/flocculant agents [7]. The second option relies on the application of biological treatments without valorisation, such as aerobic digestion, and with valorisation such as anaerobic digestion, lactose hydrolysis and fermentation for hydrogen and methane production [3]. Aerobic digestion consists of the degradation of the organic matter of whey at room temperature using short hydraulic retention times. However, the high organic content of cheese whey makes this technique inappropriate [8]. Anaerobic digestion takes place under mesophilic conditions (35–37°C) where lactose can be converted into propionic acid, ethanol and lactose acetates [9]. Lactose hydrolysis constitutes a preliminary step for other biological processes, as the number of microorganisms able to metabolise glucose and galactose are significantly higher than those that directly metabolise lactose [4]. Cheese whey fermentation includes the production of ethanol, lactic acid, and hydrogen. The bioconversion of lactose to ethanol has a theoretical maximum yield of 0.538kg ethanol/kg of lactose [10,11]. However, cheese whey fermentation is hardly economically competitive if compared to other feedstocks, particularly when using diluted cheese whey solutions [3]. To improve the economy of the process, the anaerobic fermentation of the permeate solution obtained after subjecting cheese whey to an ultrafiltration process has been considered, increasing the concentration of the ethanol produced by up to 12% [11]. The production of lactic acid has usually been carried out using the concentrated cheese whey coming from ultrafiltration [12–16]. The greatest limitation for the production of lactic acid from cheese whey is the low yield of the process (3.8–12kg/m3). Anaerobic fermentation processes have been conducted for hydrogen production from different cheese whey effluents: the original cheese whey [17,18], diluted cheese whey solutions [19–21], concentrated whey powder [22–24] and permeates resulting from different filtration processes [25]. The anaerobic fermentation has a theoretical yield of 4mol H2/mol lactose and produces a gas made up of a mixture of H2, CO2 and CH4. Different clostridium species [21] and facultative anaerobic species [24] have been used employing CSTR, batch, and UASB reactors [3]. COD reductions of around 80–90% and lactose consumption between 87% and 97% have been reported [17–19,21,24,25]. However, the residual liquid feed is still unsuitable for disposal as it contains different organics such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids and ethanol together with unreacted lactose. The presence of these compounds in the residual stream has led other authors [17,18] to consider this residual effluent from H2 production for CH4 generation in anaerobic continuous bioreactors. A COD removal of 95.3% has been achieved, with 2.2kg/m3 of COD remaining after the two anaerobic processes. Azbar and Cetinkaya Dokgoz [19] treated this effluent by photo-fermentation with Rhodopseudomonas palustris in a two-step biological process. The authors concluded the process was inadequate due to the presence of nitrogen and volatile fatty acids in the solution. Diluting this effluent with l-malic acid, which simultaneously improves hydrogen production, can partially solve this problem and a final yield of 2–10mol H2/mol lactose has been reported. However, the energy supplementation and the need for large volume bioreactors makes the process unreliable [3]. Another interesting option for the treatment and valorisation of cheese whey effluents that has not been considered before is the use of thermochemical processes. Among these, catalytic steam reforming represents a challenging and promising alternative for the treatment of these residues. Steam reforming is one of the most widespread processes for the generation of a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas from organic compounds. This catalytic process, which is carried out at atmospheric pressure and at moderate temperatures, enables the organic matter of cheese whey to be transformed into a gas with a high hydrogen content, up to 70vol.%, with many different posterior applications [26]. It also reduces the organic matter of the original feedstock to appropriate levels for safe discharge into the environment. A reaction pathway for lactose steam reforming is provided in Section 2.4. The catalyst plays an important role in catalytic steam reforming. Specifically, it must enhance the reaction rate of the reforming process, which includes both the reforming reaction and the subsequent water gas shift (WGS) reaction. In addition, it must have high deactivation resistance and sufficient strength if the process is to take place in a fluidised bed reactor [27,28]. A good approach to this challenge is using Ni-based catalysts. A Ni–Co/Al–Mg catalyst, which has been proved to be suitable for the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fractions [29,30], was selected for this work. This catalyst includes Ni as the active phase. Ni based catalysts meet the challenge of being active and selective towards H2, although they are susceptible to deactivation by coking. Therefore, the catalyst was modified with Mg and Co. Mg was added as a support modifier, enhancing the water adsorption in order to gasify the coke or its precursors, as well as to provide more attrition resistance if the catalyst is to be used in a fluidised bed. Co was added as an active phase modifier to enhance the steam reforming and WGS reactions and prevent catalyst deactivation by coking, as a Ni–Co interaction can be formed in the catalyst which reduces the crystallite size [30]. Having a theoretical hydrogen yield of 24mol H2/mol lactose, this process could be postulated as a suitable alternative for the treatment and valorisation of cheese whey. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies in the literature concerning the catalytic steam reforming of cheese whey or lactose solutions. Furthermore, the works dealing with the catalytic steam reforming of sugars are extremely scarce. Hu and Lu [31] studied the catalytic steam reforming of glucose for H2 production, analysing the effect of the reaction time (0–3h), temperature (300–600°C) and steam to carbon (S/C) ratio (3–9mol H2O/mol C) on the process. Marquevich et al. [32] reported the effect of the temperature and S/C ratio on the catalytic steam reforming of xylose, glucose and sucrose. Both studies reached the same conclusions. An increase in the temperature increases gas production and the yield to H2 and reduces char formation. The S/C ratio plays a very important role in the process, decreasing solid formation and enhancing gas production, therefore high S/C ratios are necessary to ensure a high carbon conversion to gas. These sugars are unstable at high temperatures and decompose before reaching the catalytic bed, which results in a serious formation of char in the upper part of the reactor, thus decreasing the efficiency of the process. Therefore, it was claimed in both works that minimising the thermal decomposition and avoiding char formation is one of the main challenges during the steam reforming of sugars. Given this background, this work analyses the catalytic steam reforming of a lactose solution, both theoretically and experimentally, as a possible option for the treatment and valorisation of cheese whey effluents and/or lactose solutions. The theoretical study addresses the effect of the temperature (300–600°C), lactose concentration (1–10wt.%), and N2 (0–80cm3 STP/min) and liquid flow (0.1–0.5mL/min) rates on the thermodynamics of the process. The experimental part includes an in depth study of the effect of the temperature (300–600°C), lactose concentration (1–10wt.%) and mass of catalyst/lactose mass flow ratio (4–16g catalyst min/g lactose) in a fixed bed reactor using a Ni-based catalyst. For cheese whey valorisation, it is not only important to produce a hydrogen rich gas from this waste, but also to come up with a carbon-free liquid stream that could be discharged to the environment. Therefore, the effect of the operating variables on gas, liquid and solid production and on the compositions of the gas and liquid phases has been exhaustively analysed. Furthermore, optimal values for the operating variables were sought and an energy balance was performed to provide a thorough technical and energetic analysis of the process. Given that the catalytic steam reforming of cheese whey or lactose solutions has never been reported before and that works dealing with the steam reforming of sugars are very scarce, this work represents a challenging and novel investigation not only for the management and valorisation of cheese whey but also for hydrogen production from sugars or sugar-based streams by catalytic steam reforming."
1,Experimental,
2,Theoretical study,"2.1 Theoretical study Different simulations based on a 2 level 4 factor Box–Wilson Central Composite Face Centred (CCF, α: ±1) design were carried out to analyse the influence on the thermodynamic gas composition (vol.%) of the reforming temperature (300–600°C), lactose concentration (1–10wt.%), flow rate of N2 (0–80cm3 STP/min) and liquid flow rate (0.1–0.5mL/min). The gas composition (vol.%) was theoretically calculated with the aid of the software Hysys 8.4 using the Gibbs energy minimisation method. Four thermodynamic packages (PRSV, Twu–Sim–Tasonee, Lee–Kesler–Plöcker and BWRS) were used for the calculations. This Gibbs reactor utility provides the theoretical equilibrium composition minimising the Gibbs free energy of the system, which allows calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium without introducing the reaction stoichiometry, as described in the works of Chen et al. [33], Wang et al. [34] and Duo et al. [35]. For this calculation, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 were considered as output products for lactose steam reforming, which is in good agreement with the output products normally selected in reforming processes [34]. The results were analysed by means of an ANOVA test with 95% confidence. Furthermore, the relative influence of the operating variables was calculated using the cause-effect Pareto principle."
3,Experimental reforming study,"2.2 Experimental reforming study The experimental study addresses the influence of the reforming temperature (300–600°C), lactose concentration (1–10wt.%) and ratio mass of the catalyst/lactose mass flow rate (W/m lactose =4–16g catalyst min/g lactose) on the catalytic steam reforming of lactose. The experiments were planned using a 2 level 3 factor Box–Wilson Central Composite Face Centred (CCF, α: ±1) design. The results were analysed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 95% confidence and the cause-effect Pareto principle was used to determine their relative influence on the process. This corresponds to a 2 k factorial design, where k indicates the number of factors studied (in this case 3 operating variables) and 2 k represents the number of runs (in this case 8) for the simple factorial design. 10 axial experiments were performed to study non-linear effects and interactions according to the CCF design. In addition, four replicates at the centre point (centre of the variation interval of each factor) were carried out in order to evaluate the experimental error. This experimental design is suitable not only for studying the influence of each variable (linear and quadratic effects) but also for understanding possible interactions between variables. The experimental rig used in the experiments was a microactivity unit designed and built by PID (Process Integral Development Eng & Tech, Spain). It consists of a small bench scale rig comprising a fixed bed reactor of 25mm in height and 9mm inner diameter. The lactose solutions were fed into the reactor with a HPLC pump. N2 was used as a carrier gas to facilitate the feeding of the solutions, as well as an internal standard for gas quantification. Liquid and N2 flow rates of 0.4mL/min and 40cm3 STP/min were used, respectively. Once inside the reactor, the feed down-flow passed through the catalytic bed, consisting of a mixture of catalyst and inert sand. The gaseous mixture passed to a condensation system consisting of a stainless steel vessel cooled by means of a Peltier thermoelectric cell where the condensable vapours were trapped. The permanent gases exiting the condensation system were analysed online with a micro gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detectors. More details concerning the set-up can be found in our previous communications [29,30,36]. A Ni–Co/Al–Mg catalyst prepared by coprecipitation was selected. The preparation involved adding a solution of NH4OH to a solution containing Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O, Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O, Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O dissolved in milli-Q water until a pH of 8.2 was reached, in a similar manner as reported in the work of Wang et al. [34]. The precipitation medium was maintained at 40°C and moderately stirred. The hydrated precursor was filtered, washed at 40°C and dried overnight at 105°C. Afterwards it was ground and sieved to a particle size ranging from 160 to 320μm and calcined in an air atmosphere up to a temperature of 750°C for 3h. Finally, it was activated in situ prior to reaction with H2 at 650°C. The catalyst has a 28% (relative atomic percentage) Ni expressed as Ni/(Ni+Co+Al+Mg), an atomic Mg/Al ratio of 0.26 and an atomic Co/Ni ratio of 0.10, with a BET surface area of about 132m2/g. Crystalline phases of NiO/MgO and NiAl2O4/MgAl2O4 spinels were found in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the calcined precursor. No crystalline phases of Co were detected by XRD. These crystalline phases are consistent with the TPR analyses, where two peaks were detected. A small peak was found at 300–320°C, corresponding to the reduction of the NiO phase as well as the reduction of the Co3O4 phase [37–39]. This may suggest a high Ni-Co interaction, which was confirmed by the positive shift of the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 detected in the XPS analysis. A second higher intensity peak was found at 732°C, which might correspond to the reduction of the NiAl2O4 spinel phase. Further information about the characterisation of the catalyst can be found in our previous communication [30]. The lactose solutions were prepared dissolving d-lactose monohydrate (C12H22O11⋅H2O Sigma Aldrich, CAS Number 64044-51-5, Bio-Ultra>99.5% HPLC) in Milli-Q water. The response variables studied were: the lactose conversion (X lactose, %), the carbon conversion to gas, liquid and solid products (CC gas, CC liq and CC sol, %) and the compositions of the gas (vol.%) and the liquid condensate (relative chromatographic area free of water and unreacted lactose, %). The CC sol includes both the carbon deposited on the catalyst (coke) and the char. The used catalyst was characterised by elemental analysis to calculate the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface. The CC coke and the amount of C deposited with respect to the amount of catalyst and lactose reacted (mg C/g catalyst g lactose reacted) were calculated from these analyses. Table 1 summarises the response variables and the analytical methods used for their calculation."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis In the simulations made for the theoretical study and in the fixed bed experiments, the lower and upper limits of all the factors (temperature, lactose concentration and liquid and N2 flow rates in the theoretical study and temperature, lactose concentration and W/m lactose ratio in the experimental study) were normalised from −1 to 1 (codec factors). This codification permits all factors to vary within the same interval and helps to investigate their influence in comparable terms. The experimental study analyses the effect of the operating conditions on the response variables as well as the evolution of the response variables with time. To analyse the evolution with time, the results are presented divided into three intervals of 60min. Each interval provides the average value of the response variable obtained during 60min of experiment. All these values (three per experiment) have been compared using a one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test, both with 95% confidence. The results of the ANOVA analyses are provided as p-values. P-values lower than 0.05 indicate that at least two values are significantly different. The LSD test was used to compare pairs of data, i.e. either between two intervals of the same experiment or between two intervals of two different experiments. The results of the LSD tests are presented graphically in the form of LSD bars. To ensure significant differences between any pairs of data, their LSD bars must not overlap. The effect of the operating variables on the process has been studied considering the results corresponding to the first 60min of reaction using a statistical analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) test with 95% confidence. This avoids including the activity variation with time in the analysis. The ANOVA analysis helped to select the operating variables and interactions that significantly influence the response variables under consideration. In addition, the cause-effect Pareto principle was also used to calculate their relative importance on the process."
5,Possible reaction network for lactose steam reforming,"2.4 Possible reaction network for lactose steam reforming Lactose steam reforming includes reforming, cracking and thermal decomposition reactions due to the instability of sugars at high temperatures [31,32]. 1. Reforming reactions: Steam reforming of the oxygenated compounds: lactose and intermediate products (1) C 12 H 22 O 11 + H 2 O → 12 CO + 12 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 1181 kJ / mol ) (2) C n H m O k + ( n - k ) H 2 O ⇔ n CO + ( n + m / 2 - k ) H 2 Water gas shift (WGS) reaction: (3) CO + H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol ) Methane steam reforming and dry reforming: (4) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇔ CO + 3 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ / mol ) (5) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + 4 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 165 kJ / mol ) (6) CH 4 + CO 2 ⇔ 2 CO + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 247 kJ / mol ) 2. Thermal decomposition and cracking reactions (7) C n H m O k → Liquids ( C x H y O z ) + Gas ( H 2 ,CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , … ) + carbon The thermal decomposition of lactose produces organic liquid intermediates of different nature, gases and carbonaceous residues. Fig. 1 shows a possible reaction pathway for the formation of the most important liquid products during the thermal decomposition of lactose, taking into account the work of Carlson et al. [40]. The formation of these compounds starts with an initial lactose decomposition by hydrolysis into glucose and galactose, which can be subsequently decomposed into other intermediate liquids. At a low temperature and low pyrolysis rate, both monomers evolve towards the formation of oxygenated compounds of low molecular mass such as acids, aldehydes, ketones and alcohols by retro-aldol and grob fragmentation reactions. At high temperatures and a fast pyrolysis rate the formation of anhydrosugars is favoured. These compounds can subsequently be dehydrated to give furanic compounds. Mono-aromatic compounds can be formed from both furans and small-oxygenates by oligomerisation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions. Poly-aromatic species can be produced as a final step from mono-aromatics."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Theoretical study,"3.1 Theoretical study Table 2 shows the simulations performed and the results obtained in the theoretical study. For each gas an empirical model that relates the operating variables (temperature, lactose concentration, N2 and liquid flow rates) to the volumetric composition of the gas was developed according to the ANOVA analysis. The relative influence of each factor in the model was calculated making use of the cause-effect Pareto principle. The results of these analyses are summarised in Table 3 . The thermodynamic results predict a complete lactose conversion to gas for all the simulations. Lactose has a C/O ratio close to 1, which permits complete conversion to be achieved at low temperatures [31,41]. The ANOVA analysis reveals that the temperature, lactose concentration, liquid flow rate and N2 flow rate have a statistically significant influence on the equilibrium composition of the gas (p-values<0.05), although their relative influence is different. The cause-effect Pareto analysis shows that the gas composition is strongly affected (more than 77 of relative influence) by the temperature, concentration of lactose and an interaction between these two variables. The weak influence of the liquid and N2 flow rates is related to the small variations in the partial pressures inside the reactor when varying these flow rates, which have a slight affect on the thermodynamic equilibrium [33]. As a direct consequence, the majority of works dealing with steam reforming only consider the effects of the concentration of the organic compounds (or steam to carbon ratio, S/C) and the temperature in thermodynamic studies. Taking this information into account, two different models were developed. The first was a full model used for prediction purposes which includes all the significant effects and interactions of the four operating variables. The second was a simplified model which only includes the effects of the temperature, the lactose concentration and temperature–lactose concentration interactions. This was used for studying the thermodynamics of the process. The full model (not shown) indicates that the relative amounts of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 in the gas vary as follows: 38.2–69.0vol.%, 31.7–40.3vol.%, 0.0−1.7vol.% and 0.0–21.0vol.%, respectively. Table 3 shows the terms of the simplified model and the relative importance of all the variables according to the Pareto test. The effects of the N2 and liquid flow rates and their interactions have been grouped together under the term “others”. The lack of fit for all the simplified models is not significant in comparison with the pure error (p-value>0.05) and their R 2 is higher than 0.99 in all cases. In addition, no significant differences were observed between the values predicted with the models and the values obtained in the simulations, with 95% confidence. This indicates that they are able to predict up to 99% of the variations observed, confirming the slight effect of the liquid and N2 flow rates on the thermodynamic results in this work and the good accuracy of the models developed. As regards the relative influence of the operating variables on the process, the codec model listed in Table 3 shows that within the interval of study considered in this work, the temperature (the linear term and its interaction with the lactose concentration) exerts the highest influence on the equilibrium composition. The quadratic effect for the temperature (T 2) is significant, which indicates the existence of maxima and minima. Conversely, quadratic terms for the lactose concentration are not significant with 95% confidence, denoting a linear evolution for this operating variable. In addition, a significant interaction between the temperature and the concentration of lactose was detected; therefore the effect of the lactose concentration depends on the temperature and vice versa. The effect of the temperature is related to the variations of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of all the reactions involved in the process, while the effect of the concentration (1–10wt.%) is linked to the variations in the water content of the solutions (variations in the S/C ratio from 157 to 14mol H2O/mol C). High S/C ratios help to shift the WGS and methane reforming reactions towards the formation of H2 [42]. Fig. 2 shows the interaction plots between the temperature and lactose concentration obtained from the models shown in Table 3, obtained from the statistical analysis of the results obtained in the simulations listed in Table 2. Specifically, the volumetric gas composition (vol.%) is plotted as a function of the temperature for the lowest and the highest (1 and 10wt.%) lactose concentrations employed in this work. In general, an increase in the temperature between 300 and 600°C increases the proportions of H2 and CO in the gas, reducing the relative amounts of CO2 and CH4. The reforming reaction of lactose (Eq. (1)) is highly endothermic and the water gas shift reaction (Eq. (3)) is moderately exothermic [31], giving an overall endothermic process. Thus, an increase in temperature augments the equilibrium concentration of H2 and CO in the gas. The proportions of CH4 and CO2 in the gas decrease due to the endothermic nature of the reforming (Eqs. (4) and (5)) and dry reforming (Eq. (6)) of methane as well as the exothermic character of the WGS reaction, respectively [42]. These variations are more appreciable as the concentration of lactose in the solution increases due to the significant interaction between the temperature and the lactose concentration. This makes the effect of the temperature on the composition of the gas extremely weak for very diluted lactose solutions (1wt.%) due to the large amount of water employed (S/C=157mol H2O/mol C). Conversely, an increase in the lactose concentration from 1 to 10wt.% increases the effect of the temperature. An increase in the lactose concentration has two different consequences depending on the temperature. On the one hand, between 300 and 450°C, an increase in the amount of lactose in the solution reduces the proportion of H2, augmenting the relative amounts of CO2 and CH4 in the gas. Within this temperature range, an increase in the concentration of lactose diminishes the excess of water, thus decreasing the steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of the solution from 157 to 14mol H2O/mol C. This originates a lesser shift of the WGS and methane reforming reactions towards H2 production. On the other hand, between 450 and 600°C, the same increment in the concentration of lactose increases the proportions of H2 and CO and reduces the concentration of CO2 in the gas. The variation in the relative amount of H2 is relatively small, since the optimum for H2 production is found to be at temperatures around 500–550°C. These variations are the consequence of the greater spread of reforming reactions at high temperature, which favours H2 production."
8,Experimental study,"3.2 Experimental study 3.2.1 Global lactose conversion and carbon distribution: CC gas, CC liq and CC sol. Table 4 lists the experiments performed in the fixed bed reactor. A complete and steady global lactose conversion (X lactose) was achieved in all the experiments, indicating that all the lactose was converted into gas, liquid and solid products. The C/O ratio close to 1 of lactose allows complete conversion to be achieved even at the lowest temperature used in this work [31,41]. Complete conversions were achieved at temperatures higher than 500°C in the work of Hu and Lu [31] during the steam reforming of glucose. Fig. 3 shows the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol obtained for the experiments in three intervals of 60min. The statistical analysis reveals significant differences between the results obtained in the experiments for the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol (p-values<0.001), which vary as follows: 2–97%, 0–66% and 0–95%, respectively. In addition, increases and reductions in the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol are detected in some experiments. The general trend for the CC gas is a reduction with time. Reductions are clearly observed in runs 2, 4, 6, 8, 9∗, 14–19 and 21 and might be the consequence of the progressive deactivation of the catalyst. All these experiments were conducted at a temperature higher than 450°C. A decay in the CC gas with time was also reported in the work of Hu and Lu during the steam reforming of glucose [31]. A comparison between experiments 2 and 4 shows how an increase in the W/m lactose ratio increases the initial CC gas due to the positive kinetic effect that the catalyst exerts on the process. Furthermore, a greater value of the W/m lactose ratio results in a lessening of the decay of the CC gas over time. This trend is also observed for runs 6 and 8. However, run 8 displays an initial increase in the CC gas followed by a posterior decay. This phenomenon could account for the progressive gasification of the carbonaceous deposits formed by an incomplete vaporisation of the feed, as has been reported in other works dealing with the steam reforming of sugars [31,32,36]. The effect of the lactose concentration is seen when comparing runs 2 with 6 and 4 with 8. An increase in the concentration of lactose decreases the excess of water, and consequently the S/C ratio. This decreases the reaction rate of the gasification reactions of the carbonaceous deposits and increases the reduction over time of the CC gas. Similar trends have been reported during the steam reforming of xylose, glucose and sucrose [31,32]. Runs 1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 20 and 22 display a steady and low CC gas (<5%). All these experiments were conducted at 300°C using different lactose concentrations and W/m lactose ratios. These results indicate that gas production is not favoured at low temperatures. Under these conditions, the lactose concentration and W/m lactose ratio do not exert a significant influence on the CC gas due to the endothermicity of the reforming reactions. The CC sol displays increases and decreases with time. On the one hand, for runs conducted at 300°C (1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 20 and 22) the CC sol is high at the start of the experiment and progressively decreases with time. Sugar molecules are unstable at the temperatures of this process and quickly decompose through pyrolysis, leading to the formation of char particles and gases [32]. The accumulation of this char in the upper part of the reactor might have a positive catalytic effect on lactose pyrolysis and/or cracking reactions. Char obtained from the pyrolysis of different biomass materials has been reported to have catalytic activity for the reforming and cracking of different hydrocarbons [43–49], which accounts for the drops over time observed for the CC sol [31,32] and the increases in the CC liq. Conversely, for runs conducted at higher temperatures (450–600°C), where the vaporisation of the solution is more favoured and carbon deposits can be removed by gasification due to the relatively high temperature and high S/C ratio of the feed, the CC sol increases or remains steady over time. The increases are the consequence of the progressive deactivation of the catalyst, which originates a decrease in the CC gas and an increase in the CC sol [31,32]. In addition, the accumulation of char particles in the upper part of the reactor hinders the vaporisation of the feed as the atomisation system is not as effective when the liquid comes into contact with solid particles, leading to bigger droplet sizes. Consequently, the evaporation takes places at lower heating rates. This enhances the formation of more carbonaceous deposits, augmenting the formation of char over time, which increases the CC sol [50]. However these variations do not take place in runs 16, 17 and 21, where a steady CC sol is obtained. These runs were conducted using a high W/m lactose ratio and a medium lactose concentration (run 16), an intermediate W/m lactose ratio and a low lactose solution (run 17) and high temperature and an intermediate lactose concentration (run 21). These conditions reach a compromise between carbon deposit formation and elimination that can provide a steady evolution for the CC sol. As regards the evolution over time for the CC liq, increases with time are observed for the vast majority of experiments. These increases have two different backgrounds. On the one hand, for the experiments with an initial high CC gas (2, 6, 9∗, 14–18), the increase in the CC liq accounts for the progressive deactivation of the catalyst, which is not able to completely transform the organic content of the feed into gas, thus increasing the proportion of intermediate liquid products originating from thermal decomposition and incomplete reforming. On the other hand, for the experiments with both an initial low CC gas and a high CC sol (1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 20 and 22), the increases might be the consequence of the formation of liquid condensable products from the progressive pyrolysis of the feed and or/the carbon deposits (mainly as char), thus increasing the CC liq over time. Interestingly, experiments 4, 8 and 19, which were conducted at a high temperature (600°C) and high spatial time (16g catalyst min/g lactose), display negligible CC liq and a relatively high amount of CC gas regardless of the lactose concentration. The COD values for 1, 5.5 and 10wt.% lactose solutions are 11.5, 63.5 and 115.5kg/m3, respectively. The liquid condensate obtained in experiments 4, 8 and 19 (1, 10 and 5.5wt.% of lactose, respectively) has COD values of 3.29, 4.60 and 1.59kg/m3, respectively. This corresponds to a reduction in the COD of the solutions of 71%, 96% and 97%, respectively, with respect to the original feedstock. Therefore, high temperatures and spatial times enhance gas formation from the vaporised part of the feed, thus producing an almost carbon free liquid condensate with a considerably lower COD than that of the original feedstock. To gain a better insight into the carbon deposition, the carbon deposited on the used catalysts was examined and the solid carbon distribution between char and coke was calculated. Table 5 lists the CC coke, CC char and the amount of C deposited on the catalysts during the reforming experiments. The results indicate that the vast majority of the CC sol is due to the formation of char. In general more than 80% of the total solid C is due to char formation. This proportion increases up to 90% for the experiments conducted at 300°C, confirming the significant formation of carbonaceous solid at low temperatures. Char production is highly likely to occur during the thermal decomposition of lactose. Lactose is unstable when heated at the temperatures employed in this work and it decomposes before reaching the catalytic bed, resulting in severe char formation in the upper part of the reactor. This tendency of sugars to decompose giving char has also been reported for xylose, glucose and sucrose [31,32]. The statistical analysis of the amount of carbon (expressed as mg C/g catalyst g lactose reacted to produce gases) reveals that the highest deposition takes place at 300°C (groups A to G). Furthermore, a relatively high amount of this carbon is deposited on the catalyst surface, proving evidence for the experimentally observed catalyst deactivation. This catalyst deactivation by coking has been reported in other works dealing with the steam reforming of other oxygenated compounds. A very detailed mechanism for coke deposition, explaining the deactivation of Ni-based catalysts by coking, is provided in the work of Wang et al. [51]. The specific effect of the operating conditions as well as their possible interactions on the process has been studied using the results obtained during the first 60min of reaction. The models created in terms of codec factors considering the ANOVA analysis of the experiments performed (Table 4) are presented in Table 6 . The reaction temperature is the operating variable with the highest influence on the CC gas and CC sol. An increase in the temperature increases and decreases the CC gas (positive term in the model) and CC sol (negative term in the model), respectively. An increase in the temperature not only facilitates the vaporisation of the feed, decreasing the formation of solid carbon, but also favours the reforming process due to its endothermic nature [31,32]. Furthermore, the effect of the temperature depends on the W/m lactose ratio due to the significant interaction between these two variables. The CC liq is significantly influenced by the temperature and W/m lactose ratio. An increase in the temperature decreases the CC liq (negative term in the model) due to the positive effect that the temperature exerts on the gas production from the intermediate liquid compounds resulting from the thermal decomposition of lactose. The effects of the operating variables on the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol are shown in Fig. 4 . The evolution of these variables was obtained from the ANOVA analysis (Table 6) of all the experiments performed (Table 4). In addition, when possible, some experimental points were added. Specifically, Fig. 4 a and b shows the effect on the CC gas of the temperature for W/m lactose ratios of 4 and 16g catalyst min/g lactose when 1 and 10wt.% lactose solutions were used, respectively. Fig. 4c and d and e and f illustrates these effects for the CC liq and CC sol, respectively. In general, the CC gas and CC sol show opposite trends. An increase in the temperature augments the CC gas and reduces the CC sol, as discussed above. With respect to the effect of the W/m lactose ratio, an increase from 4 to 16g catalyst min/g lactose increases the CC gas and decreases the CC sol due to the positive catalytic effect the catalyst has on the reforming reaction and the pyrolysis and gasification of solid deposits [31,32]. However, this increment depends on the temperature and lactose concentration. At temperatures between 300 and 350°C, an increase in the W/m lactose ratio from 4 to 16g catalyst min/g lactose does not have a statistically significant influence on the CC gas. Within this temperature range, the vaporisation of the feed is not favoured and the vast majority of the organics are converted into carbonaceous deposits or liquid intermediates. Therefore an increment in the amount of catalyst (W/m lactose ratio) does not have a significant influence on the CC gas. Conversely, as the temperature increases and the formation of gas is most favoured, an increase in the W/m lactose ratio significantly augments the CC gas. An almost complete CC gas can be achieved at temperatures higher than 500°C when a 1wt.% lactose solution is fed. This increment in the W/m lactose ratio diminishes the CC solid regardless of the temperature. However, this drop depends on the concentration of lactose and the W/m lactose ratio. The effect of the concentration of lactose can be gathered comparing Fig. 4a with b and e with f. An increase in the concentration of lactose in the solution from 1 to 10wt.% reduces the CC gas between 350 and 550°C, as explained above. As the lactose concentration increases, the formation of carbonaceous deposits obtained from an incomplete vaporisation of the feed is most favoured due to the reduction of the S/C ratio (157 and 14mol H2O/mol C for 1 and 10wt.% lactose solutions, respectively) that lowers the excess of water. The excess of water in the feed not only helps the vaporisation of lactose but also helps the conversion of the carbonaceous deposits to take place. Hu and Lu [31] reported these trends when increasing the S/C ratio from 3 to 9mol H2O/mol C during the steam reforming of glucose and concluded that at high S/C ratios the high partial pressure of steam in the reactor favours char removal by gasification and promotes the adsorption of steam on the active sites of the catalyst, helping to reduce coke formation. Marquevich et al. [32] found an increase in gas production together with a decrease in solid formation during the steam reforming of glucose and xylose when increasing the S/C ratio from 7 to 47 and 14 to 37mol H2O/mol C, respectively. Employing a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose, a complete CC gas can be obtained at temperatures higher than 500 and 600°C when lactose solutions of 1 and 10wt.% are fed, respectively. This increase in the concentration of lactose increases the CC sol for the whole range of temperatures studied in this work except for temperatures lower than 350°C, where the formation of carbonaceous deposits is similar. The effect of the temperature on the CC liq depends on the lactose concentration and W/m lactose ratio, since a significant interaction between these variables was detected. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, an increase in the temperature between 300 and 600°C has two different effects depending on the W/m lactose ratio. On the one hand, when a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose is used, the CC liq increases as the temperature increases. However, the opposite trend is found when a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst is used. This increase in temperature favours the reforming process, decreasing the CC sol. However, when a low amount of catalyst is used the CC liq increases, since this amount of catalyst in the bed may be insufficient for a complete conversion of the organics of the feed (lactose and its decomposition products) into gases, thus increasing the production of intermediate liquids. However, when a higher amount of catalyst is used, the reaction rate of the reforming reactions towards gas production increases and therefore both the CC sol and CC liq decrease. The effect of the concentration of lactose on the CC liq can be seen when comparing Fig. 4c with 3d. This effect depends on the W/m lactose ratio. When a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose is used, two different tendencies are found for the CC liq, depending on the temperature. For temperatures lower than 450°C, an increase in the lactose concentration augments the CC liq. At this temperature range, the reforming process is not favoured. In addition, this increase in the lactose concentration reduces the excess of water of the feed, leading to a lower extension of the reforming reactions and thus increasing the CC liq. In contrast, at temperatures higher than 450°C the same increment in the concentration of lactose reduces the CC liq. At these temperatures, the CC sol is lower for a 1wt.% than for a10wt.% solution. This drop in the CC sol enhances the formation of intermediate liquid products, increasing the CC liq. 3.2.2 Gas composition Fig. 5 shows the gas composition obtained for the different experiments. The gas phase consists of a mixture of H2 (0–70vol.%), CO2 (20–70vol.%), CO (2–34vol.%) and CH4 (0–2.4vol.%). Statistically significant (p-values<0.05) variations are observed for the gas composition between experiments and intervals of the same experiment. The highest variations with time for the relative amounts of H2 and CO2 in the gas are observed for runs conducted at 300°C (3, 5, 7, 13, 20 and 22), where the proportions of H2 and CO2 in the gas decrease and increase, respectively. These experiments were conducted at the lowest temperature employed in this work (300°C), and where the greatest amount of coke was deposited on the used catalysts (more than 11mg C/g catalyst g organic reacted). This accounts for the catalyst deactivation by coking and indicates that the temperature exerts a significant influence on catalyst deactivation. The temperature significantly influences the reforming process, increasing the reaction rate of the reforming reactions, thus partially compensating for the catalyst deactivation. In addition, during the reforming process an initial thermal decomposition of the organic compounds might occur before reaching the catalytic bed. This produces gases (mainly H2, CO, CO2 and CH4), other intermediate or decomposition products and char [32]. The gases and the intermediate products evolve towards achieving the thermodynamic composition for the gas when passing through the catalytic bed, which results in an increase and a decrease in the proportions of H2 and CO2, respectively. Comparing the experiments conducted at the same temperature, the lower the W/m lactose ratio, the higher are the reductions with time in the proportion of H2. High W/m lactose ratios allow having a greater amount of active catalyst in the bed, thus minimising the decay observed for the proportion of H2 in the gas. This finding can be appreciated by comparing the following experiments: 2 and 4; 6 and 8; and 9, 15 and 16. Some variations with time are observed for the proportions of CO and CH4 in the gas. The proportion of CO increases with time due to the progressive deactivation of the catalyst and the lesser shift of the WGS reaction towards H2 and CO2. The greatest increases in the proportion of CO occur at low temperatures, where the highest deactivation of the catalyst is observed. An exception to this occurs in experiment 3, where the decrease in the proportion of H2 is accompanied by an increase in both the proportions of CO and CO2, probably due to the decrease over time observed in the evolution of the CC sol, which slightly increases the amount of C in the gas. The proportion of CH4 in the gas remains steady with time for the vast majority of the experiments. The specific effects of the operating conditions as well as their possible interactions on the volumetric composition of the gas were studied considering the results obtained during the first 60min of reaction. Table 7 lists the results of the statistical analyses. The temperature (linear and quadratic terms) is the operating variable exerting the highest influence on the proportions of H2, CO2 and CO in the gas (relative importance of 31%, 19% and 31%, respectively). The interaction between the temperature and the quadratic term for the W/m lactose ratio has the highest influence (21%) on the concentration of CH4 in the gas. The coefficients of the codec models show how an increase in the temperature increases the concentration of H2 in the gas (positive term) while reducing the proportion of the other gases (negative term). The concentration of lactose individually does not influence the gas composition. However, significant interactions with the temperature and the W/m lactose ratio are detected. The effects of the operating conditions on the composition of the gas obtained with the ANOVA analysis are plotted in Figs. 6 and 7 . Specifically, Fig. 6a and c shows the effect of the temperature using a 1wt.% lactose solution and W/m glycerol ratios of 4 and 16g catalyst min/g lactose on the concentrations of H2 and CO2. The influence of the temperature and the W/m glycerol for a 10wt.% lactose solution is shown in Fig. 6b and d. Fig. 7 plots these effects for the concentrations of CO and CH4 in the gas. The evolution of these variables was obtained from the ANOVA analysis (Table 7) of all the experiments performed (Table 4). In addition, when possible, some experimental points were added. 3.2.2.1 H2 and CO2 Fig. 6 shows how an increase in the temperature from 300 to 600°C increases the concentration of H2 in the gas regardless of the other operating variables and decreases the proportion of CO2 in some cases. This development in the proportion of H2, where an optimum takes place at 450–500°C, has also been reported in other works dealing with steam reforming of other saccharides [31,32] and is the consequence of the endothermic character of lactose steam reforming. The temperature exerts the greatest effect on the proportion of these two gases for a 1wt.% lactose solution, while its effect is relatively weak as the concentration of lactose increases up to 10wt.%. As an exception, the temperature does not exert a significant effect on the proportion of CO2 for a 1wt.% lactose solution using a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose. This high W/m lactose ratio produces a concentration of CO2 close to that predicted thermodynamically over the whole temperature range. A comparison between Fig. 6a with b and c with d reveals that the proportion of H2 in the gas increases between 300 and 450°C when increasing the lactose concentration from 1 to 10wt.% and reduces the relative amount of CO2 in the gas for a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose. These developments account for the formation of C deposits that lower the amount of C in the gas as the concentration of lactose increases, thus increasing and decreasing the proportions of H2 and CO2, respectively, especially at low temperatures. An increase in temperature decreases the solid carbon formation allowing thermodynamic composition to be reached for the proportions of H2 and CO2. An increase in the W/m lactose ratio increases the proportion of H2 in the gas and reduces the concentration of CO2 between 300 and 500°C for a 1wt.% lactose solution. Lactose steam reforming involves an initial thermal decomposition forming CO2, CO and other intermediate products that subsequently evolve towards the thermodynamic composition of the gas [32]. At low temperatures, decomposition reactions might prevail over reforming reactions, which results in a gas with a higher and lower proportion of H2 and CO2, respectively, than those thermodynamically predicted. An increase in the temperature or in the W/m lactose ratio increases the reaction rates of the reforming reactions shifting the proportions of H2 and CO2 towards their thermodynamic value. For a 10wt.% lactose solution the W/m lactose ratio exerts a negligible effect on the proportions of H2 and CO2. This is the consequence of the trade-off between the gasification of the carbon deposits (which decreases and increases the proportions of H2 and CO2, respectively) and reforming reactions (which shift the proportion of H2 and CO2 towards their thermodynamic value). 3.2.2.2 CO and CH4 Fig. 7 shows how an increase in the temperature decreases the relative amount of CO in the gas. At low temperatures (300–450°C), lactose is thermally decomposed into a gas with a high proportion of CO and CO2 [31]. This high proportion of CO in the gas decreases towards its thermodynamic value when increasing the temperature. In general, an increase in the W/m lactose ratio from 4 to 16g catalyst min/g lactose decreases the relative amount of CO in the gas due the greater spread of the water gas shift reaction. The effect of the lactose concentration on the relative amount of CO in the gas can be observed comparing Fig. 7a with b. An increase in the lactose concentration for a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose decreases the proportion of CO in the gas, especially at temperatures higher than 450°C due to the low amount of C of the gas phase. Conversely, for a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose the effect of the concentration of lactose is not significant. At temperatures higher than 450°C, the reforming process is favoured and a thermodynamic concentration for the CO is obtained. At temperatures lower than 450°C there is a trade-off between the gasification of carbon deposits and the higher extension of the WGS reaction. The proportion of CH4 in the gas is lower than 0.5vol.% in all cases. For a 1wt.% lactose solution the concentration of CH4 increases with temperature regardless of the W/m lactose ratio. The proportion of C in the gas increases with temperature, which can increase the concentration of CH4. For a 10wt.% lactose solution and employing 4g catalyst min/g lactose, the temperature does not have a significant influence, while for a 16g catalyst min/g lactose the relative amount of CH4 drops as the temperature increases. At temperatures higher than 450°C the evaporation of the feed and the reforming process are favoured but the thermodynamic proportion of CH4 decreases. A comparison between Fig. 7c and d shows how an increase in the concentration of lactose increases the proportion of CH4 in the gas between 300 and 500°C due to the thermodynamics. Between 450 and 600°C the same increase in the concentration of lactose causes a decrease in the concentration of CH4 in the gas. 3.2.3 Liquid composition The liquid phase is made up of a mixture of aldehydes (acetaldehyde and propanal), ketones (2-propanone), carboxylic acids (acetic and propionic acids), sugars (levoglucosan and d-alose), furans (furfural, 2-furancarboxaldehyde and 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde), alcohols (ethanol, propanol and cyclic alcohols) and phenolic compounds (phenol and methyl-phenols). The presence of these compounds in the liquid phase, which is consistent with the reaction pathway proposed in Fig. 1, is the result of the thermal decomposition of lactose and the incomplete reforming of lactose and its liquid intermediates. All these reaction intermediates have a high tendency to form coke (especially sugars, furans and aromatic species) [36,52–55] which explains the formation of coke observed experimentally and the high proportion of CO and CO2 in the gas under some experimental conditions. Fig. 8 plots the relative amounts of each of the different families of liquid compounds for the different experiments represented in 3 intervals of 60min, together with the results of the Fisher’s LSD test. The results from the statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in the concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, sugars, furans, alcohols and phenols (p-values<0.05). The proportion of these compounds in the liquid, expressed as relative chromatographic area, is as follows. Aldehydes: 0–100%, ketones: 0–99%, carboxylic acids: 0–29%, furans: 0–99%, sugars: 0–89%, alcohols: 0–9% and phenols: 0–4%. For the operating conditions where a negligible formation of liquid is achieved (high temperature and W/m lactose ratio), the liquid phase is made up of aldehydes and of a mixture of ketones and sugars when feeding a 1 and a 10wt.% lactose solution, respectively. Studying the evolution over time for these compounds, two tendencies are found. Aldehydes, alcohols and phenols remain relatively steady, while high variations over time can be seen for ketones, carboxylic acids, sugars and furans. Aldehydes display a decrease in their relative area in run 4. The relative amount of phenols decreases for run 3 and increases for runs 6, 14 and 18. Increases in the proportion of ketones are found for runs 2 and 6 while decreases take place for runs 5, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 19. Carboxylic acids display increases for runs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 22 and decreases for runs 1 and 17. The proportion of sugars increases for runs 1, 3, 4 and 19 and decreases for runs 2, 6 and 22. The relative amount of furans in the liquid increases for runs 6, 14, 17 and 22 and decreases for runs 1 and 3. To gain a better insight into the variations over time of these compounds, a multivariate analysis by means of Spearman’s test was conducted to find significant relationships between the proportions of these compounds in the liquid phase. This test reveals significant relationships with 95% confidence between the proportions of furans and carboxylic acids (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.65); carboxylic acids and ketones (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.35); carboxylic acids and sugars (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.65); furans and alcohols (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.63); furans and sugars (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.36); alcohols and phenols (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.46) and phenols and carboxylic acids (p-value=0.0001; R 2 =0.56). These relationships account for the experimental observations and the reaction pathway shown in Fig. 1. The test reveals that the increase in the proportion of sugars takes place together with decreases in the proportions of furans and ketones. The specific effects of the operating conditions as well as their possible interactions on the liquid composition were studied considering the results obtained during the first 60min of reaction. Table 8 shows the significant terms in the codec model and their relative influence in the process according to the cause-effect Pareto test and the ANOVA analysis for the different families of compounds. Sugars, furans, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are the compounds displaying the highest variations in their proportions during the first hour of experiment, and consequently they are the most influenced by the operating conditions. Thus, only the influence of the operating conditions on the proportion of these families has been discussed in depth. The relative influence of the operating conditions on the liquid composition summarised in Table 8 indicates that the temperature and the W/m lactose exert the greatest influence on the proportion of these liquids. Lactose decomposition is a competitive process involving competition between fragmentation and polymeric reactions. Therefore the operating conditions significantly influence the composition of the liquid phase [56]. The temperature, residence time and pH are the most influential parameters affecting product distribution during the thermal decomposition of carbohydrates [57]. Fig. 9 summarises the effect of the operating variables and the most important interactions on the liquid product distribution according to the ANOVA analysis. The evolution of these variables was obtained from the ANOVA analysis (Table 8) of all the experiments performed (Table 4). In addition, when possible, some experimental points were added. Some plots predict slightly negative relative areas due to the experimental character of the models. Specifically, Fig. 9a, c, e, g and i shows the effect of the temperature on the proportion of sugars, furans, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids in the liquids for W/m lactose ratios of 4 and 16g catalyst min/g lactose when a 1wt.% lactose solution was used. These effects are plotted for a 10wt.% lactose solution in Fig. 9b, d, f, h and j. 3.2.3.1 Sugars The influence of the temperature on the proportion of sugars in the liquid depends on the W/m lactose ratio. For 4g catalyst min/g lactose the temperature does not exert a significant effect between 300 and 400°C, where a liquid free of sugars is obtained. An increase in the temperature between 400 and 600°C dramatically increases the proportion of sugars as their formation is favoured at high temperatures [40]. Conversely, for a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose, a rise in the proportion of sugars takes place as the temperature increases from 300 to 450°C. A posterior drop follows this increase when the temperature is further increased up to 600°C. The increase in the W/m lactose ratio promotes the transformation of sugars into gases, thus reducing their proportion in the liquid phase. The W/m lactose ratio exerts a significant influence on the proportion of sugars. Between 300 and 450°C an increase in this ratio leads to an increase in the proportion of sugars in the liquid. Within this temperature range, an increment in the amount of catalyst helps to decrease the formation of carbon deposits, which increases the formation of liquid products. However, at temperatures of 450°C and beyond, where the reforming process is more favoured, this same increase leads to a decrease in the proportion of sugars for a 1wt.% solution, probably due to their steam reforming to produce gases. This effect is not observed for a 10wt.% solution, since the formation of sugars is more favoured when increasing the concentration of lactose in the feed. The effect of the lactose concentration on the proportion of sugars in the liquid depends on the W/m lactose ratio. For 4g catalyst min/g lactose, the effect of the concentration is relatively small, while for 16g catalyst min/g lactose an increase in the concentration of lactose in the feed greatly increases the relative amount of sugars in the liquid. A lower amount of water can help to shift the dehydration reactions of glucose and galactose towards the production sugars. 3.2.3.2 Furans The highest proportion of furans in the liquid occurs at low temperatures, where their formation might be favoured. An increase in the temperature decreases their proportion in the liquid due to the greater extension of reforming reactions to produce gases. The effect of the W/m lactose ratio is only significant for a concentrated lactose solution (10wt.%). Under these conditions, an increase in the amount of catalyst reduces the relative amount of furans in the liquid between 300 and 450°C. Within this temperature range, an increase in the W/m lactose ratio increases the CC gas, which increases the proportion of sugars, thus reducing the relative amount of furans in the liquid. Moreover, an increase in the W/m lactose ratio also aids the transformation of furans into phenolic compounds and gases, which accounts for the drop observed for this family and is in agreement with the reaction pathway proposed in Fig. 1. The lactose concentration is only significant at temperatures between 300 and 400°C, where an increase from 1 to 10wt.% reduces the proportion of furans in the liquid. The increase observed in the proportion of sugars due to the lower excess of water accounts for this variation. 3.2.3.3 Aldehydes The influence of the temperature on the proportion of aldehydes in the liquid depends on the concentration of lactose and the W/m lactose ratio. For a 1wt.% lactose solution employing a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose, the temperature does not exert a significant effect on the proportion of aldehydes in the liquid. For a ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose, an increase in temperature increases the proportion of aldehydes. Acetaldehyde, obtained from the fragmentation of glucose and galactose, is the major constituent of this family. High temperatures favours linear aldehyde production [56], which is in agreement with the experimental results of this work. For a 10wt.% solution the effect of the temperature and W/m lactose on the proportion of aldehydes is weak, and a proportion of aldehydes lower than 5% is obtained within the whole temperature range considered in this work. 3.2.3.4 Ketones The effect of the temperature on this family depends on the other two operating variables. When a 1wt.% lactose solution and a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose are used, an increase in the temperature initially increases the proportion of ketones from 300 to 450°C, while a further increase up to 600°C reduces their relative amount. For a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose, the opposite trend with the temperature is observed. Low temperatures can favour the extension of retroaldolic reactions, increasing the proportion of ketones in the liquid. An increase in temperature might favour their transformation into other liquid intermediates and/or gases. For 16g catalyst min/g lactose, the initial decrease in the proportion of ketones takes place together with an increase in the relative amounts of aldehydes and sugars, which might indicate a lower reactivity of ketones in steam reforming [36,58,59]. For a 10wt.% lactose solution the temperature does not exert a significant influence for a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose. However, an initial decrease in the proportion of ketones takes place for temperatures from 300 to 450°C followed by a posterior increase from 450 to 600°C when a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose is used. The higher formation of carbon deposits when feeding a concentrated lactose solution, which decreases the fraction of vaporised organic compounds, might hinder any increase in ketones with the temperature; thus the ketones follow the same trend as found for a 1wt.% lactose solution. As the temperature increases and the CC sol decreases, the proportion of ketones reaches the same value as that for a 1wt.% solution. The effect of the concentration of lactose is found to be significant only between 400 and 500°C for a W/m lactose ratio of 4g catalyst min/g lactose. Under these conditions an increase in the concentration of lactose decreases the relative amount of ketones in the liquid. Retroaldolic reactions might be favoured when high S/C and low W/m lactose ratios are used. A greater amount of catalyst might increase the reaction rates of the reforming reactions, thus increasing gas production. 3.2.3.5 Carboxylic acids Carboxylic acids are intermediate products in lactose steam reforming. They are obtained at low temperatures from the decomposition of glucose and galactose by fragmentation and retroaldol reactions [40]. They can be obtained from alcohol dehydration and aldehyde oxidation. The effect of the temperature depends on the concentration of lactose. For a 1wt.% solution, an increase in their relative amount takes place between 300 and 450°C regardless of the W/m lactose ratio, reaching a maximum in the proportion of carboxylic acids at 450°C. Lactose decomposition through retroaldol and fragmentation reactions might be favoured at this temperature range. A further increase in the temperature up to 600°C reduces the proportion of carboxylic acids, probably due to their transformation into other liquid products and/or gases. For a 10wt.% lactose solution a mild decrease with temperature takes places. The W/m lactose ratio does not significantly influence the proportion of carboxylic acids, while the concentration of lactose exerts a significant influence decreasing the proportion of acids in the condensate as the lactose concentration increases from 1 to 10wt.%."
9,Theoretical prediction of optimal operating conditions and energetic assessment,"3.3 Theoretical prediction of optimal operating conditions and energetic assessment Optimal conditions for hydrogen production were sought making use of the experimental models developed for the optimisation and scaling-up of this valorisation process. The predicted R 2 of all the models is higher than 0.90, allowing their use for prediction purposes. Three different optimisations were carried out. The first was the optimisation of the temperature for processing the highest amount of lactose, i.e. maximising the concentration of lactose in the feed. The second and the third aimed at optimising the process for the treatment of real cheese whey, fixing the concentration of lactose at 5.5wt.% (the usual concentration of lactose in cheese whey) and maximising the CC gas and the proportion of H2 in the gas. In the second optimisation the temperature and the W/m lactose ratio were minimised, while no restrictions for these two variables were considered in the third optimisation. Additionally, the evolution over time of the CC gas and the proportion of H2 in the gas were minimised in all the optimisations. To meet these objectives, a solution that strikes a compromise between the optimum values for all the response variables was sought. To do so, a relative importance (from 1 to 5) was given to each of the objectives in order to come up with the solution that satisfies all the criteria. Table 9 lists the relative importance assigned to each variable, the criteria used in the optimisations and the optimisation results. A possible optimum for maximising the concentration of lactose in the feed was found at 559°C employing a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose (Opt. 1). These conditions provide a CC gas of 78% with a proportion of H2 in the gas of 65vol.%. When feeding a lactose concentration of 5.5%, an optimum for H2 production takes place at 506°C using a W/m lactose ratio of 15g catalyst min/g lactose (Opt. 2). These conditions provide a CC gas of 72% with a relative amount of H2 in the gas of 66vol.%. The second optimisation predicts a lower temperature than that of the first due to the lower concentration of lactose. For maximising the CC gas and the relative amount of H2 in the gas (Opt. 3), the temperature must be increased up to 586°C. As a result a CC gas of 88% and a proportion of H2 in the gas of 67vol.% can be obtained. This increase of 80°C reduces the CC liq from 6% to 0% and the CC sol from 18% to 12%. These conditions not only produce a H2 rich gas from cheese whey, but also provide a carbon-free liquid product that can be discharged to the environment without any further treatment, thus helping to improve the economy and sustainability of the cheese manufacturing companies. An energy balance for the process was conducted for the third optimisation using Hysys 8.4 simulation software with a PRSV thermodynamic package. The input energy, calculated as the sum of energy needed to heat the feed up to the reforming temperature and the energy needed for the steam reforming reaction, is 3555kJ/kg of solution. The theoretical output energy, calculated as the energy recovered from the gas as it is cooled from the reforming temperature to 25°C (assuming water in liquid state), is 3338kJ/kg of solution. As a result, it is necessary to provide 217kJ/kg of solution for the process. This energy can be theoretically generated by the combustion of 20% of the reforming gas with the stoichiometric amount of air (0.07kg air/kg solution) and with the energy recovered from the gas as it is cooled from the adiabatic combustion temperature (1632°C) to 25°C (assuming water in liquid state). Fig. 10 shows a schematic diagram of this reforming-combustion process. Overall, with the combustion of 20% of the gas produced in the process, 68% of the carbon present in the original feed can be transformed into a rich hydrogen gas (67vol.%), with a global H2 yield of 16mol H2/mol lactose in a neutral energy process. To study a more realistic case, it has been considered that 5% of the energy recovered in the coolers and produced by combustion is lost. In this case, considering an energy loss of 5% in the burner and the subsequent cooler, the combustion of 41% of the reforming gas would be required to provide the energy necessary for the process. The stoichiometric amount of air and the adiabatic combustion temperature are 0.13kg air/kg solution and 1606°C, respectively. Taking these heat losses into account, an overall carbon conversion to gas of 52% and a global H2 yield of 12.5mol H2/mol lactose could be obtained from this valorisation-combustion process. This H2 yield is close to the theoretical maximum of the process (24mol H2/mol lactose) and is higher than those obtained in anaerobic fermentation (4mol H2/mol lactose) or anaerobic fermentation plus photo-fermentation with l-malic acid (2–10mol H2/mol lactose). In addition, the energy calculations indicate that catalytic steam reforming is energetically feasible for energy and H2 production."
10,Conclusions,"The catalytic steam reforming of lactose, the major organic constituent of cheese whey, has been evaluated both theoretically and experimentally in a fixed bed reactor using a Ni-based catalyst. The most important conclusions obtained from this preliminary study for the valorisation of this waste stream obtained during the cheese making process are summarised as follows. 1. This process enables the lactose present in cheese whey effluents to be transformed into a rich H2 gas, reducing the amount of carbon present in the liquid effluent and resulting in an almost carbon-free liquid stream under certain operating conditions. 2. The temperature and the concentration of lactose are the factors with the highest influence on the thermodynamics of lactose steam reforming. A thermodynamic optimum for H2 production is found to be at a temperature between 430 and 570°C for the whole range of lactose concentrations considered in this work (1–10wt.%). 3. The temperature, lactose concentration and W/m lactose ratio have a statistically significant influence on the carbon conversions to gas, solid and liquid products as well as on the composition of the gas and liquid phases. An increase in the temperature augments the CC gas, due to the endothermic nature of the reforming process. In addition, the temperature enhances the vaporisation of the feed and promotes the gasification of the carbonaceous deposits derived from an incomplete vaporisation. 4. The gas phase was made up of a mixture of H2 (10–68vol.%), CO2 (24–63vol.%), CO (1–28vol.%) and CH4 (0–1vol.%). The temperature is the operating variable with the greatest influence on the composition of the gas. An increase in the reforming temperature increases the proportion of H2 and reduces the concentration of CO in the gas. An increase in the W/m lactose ratio favours the reforming and the water gas shift reactions. The effect of the concentration of lactose on the composition of the gas phase depends on the temperature and W/m lactose ratio due to the coexistence and competition of kinetic (vaporisation and reforming reaction rates) and thermodynamic effects. 5. The liquid phase is made up of a mixture of aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, sugars, furans, alcohols and phenols derived from the thermal decomposition of lactose. This thermal decomposition involves competition between fragmentation and condensation reactions. 6. The maximum CC gas (88%) together with the highest proportion of H2 (67vol.%) in the gas, along with a carbon-free liquid stream when feeding a 5.5wt.% lactose solution (typical of cheese whey), are achieved using a reforming temperature of 586°C and employing a W/m lactose ratio of 16g catalyst min/g lactose. The combustion of 20% of this reforming gas provides the energy necessary for the process. Considering the global process (reforming and combustion) a rich hydrogen gas with a global H2 yield of 16mol H2/mol lactose can be obtained. If heat losses are considered, the proportion of the reforming gas needed for combustion increases up to 40%, and the global H2 yield decreases up to a value of 12.5mol H2/mol lactose."
