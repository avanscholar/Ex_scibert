0,Introduction,"The two major challenges faced by the current energy sector at a global scale are the increasing environmental impacts of fossil fuels and their fluctuating prices. The escalating global demands of fossil fuels associated with their greenhouse gas emissions have laid emphasis on the urge to explore alternative fuels with economic competency. Increasing air pollution has made it essential to explore environmental-friendly fuel alternatives. With these goals, there have been significant advances in the processing of biofuels. In fact, the development of compatible engines and a rigorous attempt to commercialize the biofuels have taken their evolution to progressive levels. Feedstocks from diverse sources such as lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. agricultural wastes, forestry refuse and energy crops), algae, sewage sludge, municipal solid wastes, industrial effluents and animal manure have been explored as precursors in pyrolysis, liquefaction, gasification and fermentation to produce biofuels such as bio-oil, bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and synthesis gas (Naik et al., 2008; Birouk and Toth, 2015; Nanda et al., 2015; Sahraei et al., 2017). Vegetable oil is a potential fuel source, which can be categorized as edible and non-edible based on its properties. The edible vegetable oil (or cooking oil) is composed of triglycerides extracted from plant sources. Triglycerides can be defined as the chains of three fatty acids connected with glycerol by the carbonyl group. The configuration of all the double bonds is cis-configuration. Most of the chemical and physical properties of cooking oils are attributed to their fatty acid composition (Dupain et al., 2007). Several hours of deep-frying at high temperatures result in the cooking oil to lose its edible properties and nutritional value. The disposal of waste cooking oil continues to be an unattended problem due to its environmental and health-related threats. Several nations are now imposing penalties upon the disposal of waste cooking oil into the municipal drainage system and/or natural water bodies. Owing to a large number of restaurants and pantry services as well as the practice of massive scale frying and food processing, huge volumes of waste cooking oil are generated globally every day. The worldwide production of vegetable oils has increased steadily over the years reaching about 195 million metric tons (MMT) in 2017 (Statista, 2018a). The global consumption of vegetable oils in 2017 was 198 MMT, which consisted of palm oil (62.9 MMT), soybean oil (56 MMT), rapeseed oil (29.4 MMT), sunflower seed oil (16.8 MMT), palm kernel oil (7.2 MMT), peanut oil (6 MMT), cottonseed oil (4.9 MMT), coconut oil (3.2 MMT) and olive oil (2.6 MMT) (Statista, 2018b). Every year, about 3.8 megatons of waste cooking oil is generated in the U.S. with the annual average per capita estimate of 9 lb (Chhetri et al., 2008). Likewise, in Canada and the U.K., the annual waste cooking oil production quantities are close to 0.14 megaton and 0.2 megaton, respectively (Chhetri et al., 2008). Waste cooking oil is a potential economical substitute for the virgin cooking oil that is a relatively expensive feedstock for green fuel production. In most countries, waste cooking oil was used as animal feed until 2001. In 2000, the European Union banned the use of waste cooking oil as a livestock feed because of its role in contamination of food chain through intoxication and far-reaching incidence of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). Additionally, waste cooking oil is not a good choice for soap production due to concerns about potential health hazard. So far, the widespread interest in its alternate use is best found in biodiesel production. Though this route might not fetch the cooking oil demands for commercial biofuel production, it can certainly reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and reduce the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. It is evident that biodiesel obtained from vegetable oil (soybean and canola blends) has potential properties to act as an effective substitute of conventional diesel fuel (Chhetri et al., 2008; Lang et al., 2002). The prominent challenge in the commercialization of vegetable oil-derived biodiesel is the high production cost primarily due to the high cost of virgin cooking oil. The price of cooking oil as the precursor of any green fuel is a crucial factor in determining its overall manufacturing value. The estimates of waste cooking oil generated worldwide suggest that it is ample to be utilized as a feedstock for biodiesel production or any other equivalent biofuel. Leung and Guo (2006) have studied the transesterification of neat and used frying oil for its application in biodiesel production. The parameters that affect the transesterification process of the triglycerides present in the virgin and used oil such as catalyst concentration, reaction time, methanol-to-oil molar ratio and reaction temperature were studied. Demirbaş (2003) has compiled a survey on biodiesel fuels from vegetable oils using catalytic and non-catalytic routes during supercritical alcohol transesterification. However, biodiesel produced from vegetable oil has issues relating to flowability, emissions and atomization because of its high viscosity and tendencies for drying and thickening in cold weather (Altın et al., 2001). Many studies have suggested that waste cooking oil is a reliable source to produce biodiesel (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Meng et al., 2008) and biolubricants (Chowdhury et al., 2013; Bokade and Yadav, 2007; Wang et al., 2014). Cooking oil could serve as an impending resource for hydrogen production through gasification in supercritical water (SCW). At temperatures and pressures beyond its critical point (374 °C and 22.1 MPa), water exists in a fluid state that has densities like liquids and high kinetic energy like gases (Reddy et al., 2014; Kruse, 2008). These gas and liquid-like properties, low-cost availability, non-toxicity and abundancy makes SCW an ideal green solvent for solubilizing many recalcitrant compounds and polymers through gasification. High supercritical temperature weakens the hydrogen bonding between the molecules of water and organics leading to hydrogen production (Nanda et al., 2017). There is limited literature available on the utilization of waste cooking oil as a feedstock for next-generation biofuels production other than for biodiesel. Moreover, there is no comprehensive study to justify the candidacy of waste cooking oil as a potential feedstock for hydrogen-rich syngas production. With this objective, the current study is focused on supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of waste cooking oil as an effective valorization method. Clean syngas fuel was produced from waste cooking oil in SCW medium with comprehensive optimization studies on the effects of temperature, reaction time and feed concentration. Moreover, several alkali and metal catalysts were also applied in the catalytic supercritical water gasification of waste cooking oil to enhance the gas yields."
1,Materials and method,
2,Waste cooking oil and catalysts,"2.1 Waste cooking oil and catalysts Waste cooking oil was collected from a local Asian restaurant in Toronto, Canada. The waste cooking oil collected was a result of continual deep-frying for 3–4 days of different foodstuffs such as potato wedges, French fries, onion rings, chicken wings, battered fish and shrimp tempura. In the virgin state, the source of cooking oil was a blend (60–40%) of canola and soybean oil. The catalysts (e.g. Na2CO3, K2CO3, Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3) used in the gasification studies were of commercial grade and purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, Canada."
3,Physicochemical characterization of waste cooking oil,"2.2 Physicochemical characterization of waste cooking oil The waste cooking oil was analyzed in a Bruker Alpha Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker Optics Ltd, Milton, Canada) to determine its organic functional groups. The FTIR spectra that were collected averaged 64 scans ranging from 500 to 3500 cm−1 with 2 cm−1 scanning resolution. The ultimate compositional analysis of waste cooking oil was performed to determine its carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen contents through an Elementar Vario EL III CHNOS analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany). The calorific value or higher heating value (HHV) of waste cooking oil was measured through a static bomb calorimeter using the procedure described elsewhere (Nanda et al., 2013)."
4,Supercritical water gasification of waste cooking oil,"2.3 Supercritical water gasification of waste cooking oil For SCWG of waste cooking oil, a tubular fixed bed reactor made of stainless steel SS316 grade was used. The dimensions of the SCW reactor were 40.5 cm in length, 0.94 cm in inner diameter and 1.27 cm in outer diameter. The reactor schematics are shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor setup included two pressure gauges to monitor the pressure inside the reactor and gas collection cylinder. The SCW reactor that heated using an ATS Series 3210 split furnace (Applied Test Systems, Butler, USA) controlled an ATS Type-K temperature controller system. The temperature inside the SCW reactor was monitored using an Omega Type-K thermocouple (Spectris Canada, Inc., Laval, Canada) connected to a computer equipped with Omega USB-4718 Portable Data Acquisition Module. The stainless steel (SS316) reactor tubing, fittings and accessories (e.g. 2 μm filter and check valves) were purchased from Swagelok (Swagelok Central Ontario, Mississauga, Canada). A gas-liquid separator was used to separate the condensed liquids and gas products that passed through a desiccant column (Praxair Canada Inc., Ontario, Canada) to trap moisture from the outlet gases. The volume of the product gas collected at the desired time interval was measured using a Delta Smart II mass flow meter (Brooks Instrument, Hatfield, USA) that estimated the flow rates of gases. Finally, the product gases were collected in Tedlar® bags (Environmental Sampling Supply, San Leandro, USA) for analysis in the gas chromatography. A pressure relief valve was connected to the SCW reactor assembly solely for safety reasons. Nitrogen was used to purge the reactor as an inert gas. Depending on the desired reaction temperature range, the SCW reactor (containing water and waste cooking oil) was initially pressurized to about 5–10 MPa. A low initial pressure was required for higher final temperature and vice versa. With the rise in temperature, N2 at initial pressure expanded and reached 23–25 MPa. After the supercritical pressure was attained, the experimental reactor temperatures and reaction times were maintained. The product gases were analyzed using an Agilent 7820A gas chromatography (GC) instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was installed with the GC that consisted of one capillary column and three packed columns. To quantify the concentrations of H2, CO and CH4, Ultimetal HayesepQ T 80/100 mesh column was used, whereas for estimating the concentrations of CO2 and C2H6, Ultimetal Hayesep T 80/100 mesh column was used. Argon was used as the carrier gas and the temperature of the column was set at 60 °C. Agilent OpenLAB CDS ChemStation was the software employed for the data analysis of the product gases."
5,Experimental parameters,"2.4 Experimental parameters SCW gasification experiments were conducted to see the impacts of temperature (375–675 °C), reaction time (15–60 min) and feed concentration (25–40 wt%) on gas yields from waste cooking oil. Deionized water was used as the aqueous medium for SCW gasification. In a typical experiment, the calculated amount of waste cooking oil (e.g., 2.3 g at 25 wt%) was loaded into the tubular reactor with 9 mL of deionized water. After loading the waste cooking oil in the reactor, the operating procedures were followed as mentioned in the previous section. The conditions for maximum gas yield for each parameter was optimized and the results were used to study the trends for catalytic SCWG of waste cooking oil. Commercial alkali catalysts (e.g. Na2CO3 and K2CO3) and metal catalysts (Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3) were employed at a constant 5% loading to see their influence on the gas yields and composition from catalytic SCWG of waste cooking oil. For catalytic SCWG experiments, the required amount of catalysts was loaded into the reactor containing cooking oil and deionized water. The yield of an individual gas, represented in mol/kg, was calculated as the moles of each gas per kilogram of waste cooking oil. The total gas yields were determined as the sum of the moles of total gas products collected per kilogram of waste cooking oil. The lower heating value (LHV) of the gas products was estimated based on the composition of combustible gases e.g. H2, CO, CH4 and C2H6 (measured in mol/kg) as shown in Eq. (1) (Lv et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2006; Mohammed et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2012., 2014). (1) L H V ( k J / N m 3 ) = [ 30 × C O + 25.7 × H 2 + 85.4 × C H 4 + 151.3 × C 2 H 6 ] × 4.2"
6,Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of liquid effluents,"2.5 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of liquid effluents NMR spectroscopy of the liquid effluents collected from each gasification experiment at variable temperatures was done to determine the presence and identity of any aqueous-soluble organic components. NMR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Milton, Canada) equipped with a 5 mm TXI 1H/13C/15N probe operated at 25 °C and 700.28 MHz frequency. The samples were prepared in 10% D2O with a total volume of 0.6 mL. Water suppression was performed using excitation sculpting. The spectra were acquired using standard pulse programs and analyzed using TopSpin™ software v.3.5.b.91. The preparation of samples, standardization and quantification of components are described elsewhere (Gong et al., 2017)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of waste cooking oil,"3.1 Characterization of waste cooking oil Table 1 represents the ultimate analysis of waste cooking oil in terms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur contents. As it can be seen from the table that waste cooking oil had the high carbon and hydrogen contents of 76.3 wt% and 14.1 wt%, which led to a high atomic H/C ratio of 2.22. From the atomic ratios, the chemical formula of waste cooking oil was determined to be CH2.22N0.013O0.08S0.001. The calorific value of waste cooking oil was determined to be 45.1 MJ/kg. The FTIR analysis of waste cooking oil is shown in Fig. 2 . The characteristic peaks assigned to the functional groups were identified to understand the chemical nature of waste cooking oil used as the feedstock for SCW gasification. The peak at 722 cm−1 was assigned to CH alkynes and phenyl rings. The peaks at 1094, 1164 and 1240 were ascribed to CO functional groups such as those of alcohols, carboxylic acids, ethers and esters. The presence of these peaks in the waste cooking oil indicates that vegetable oil denatures to the abovementioned compounds with gradual heating during the cooking process. The presence of CH alkanes was evident from the transmittance peaks at 1462, 2853 and 2922 cm−1. The intense peak at 1743 cm−1 was attributed to the elongation vibration of CO group from carbonyls, aldehydes and ketones. The peak at 3011 cm−1 was due to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of CH aromatic rings (Muhizi, 2014). The thermolytic, oxidative and hydrolytic reactions taking place during vegetable oil frying cause the formation of these functional groups in waste cooking oil (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006)."
9,Effects of temperature on gasification of waste cooking oil,"3.2 Effects of temperature on gasification of waste cooking oil Waste cooking oil was subjected to gasification in SCW at 375–675 °C to study the effects of temperature on gas yields and composition. The effect of temperature was determined with 25 wt% feed concentration for 30 min. The trends for H2 yield showed an increase with the rise in temperature with maximum yield (4.1 mol/kg) at 675 °C (Fig. 3 ). The total gas yield also increased by 130% with elevation in SCWG temperature from 375 to 675 °C. The total gas yields from 25 wt% waste cooking oil in 30 min of SCW gasification was found to increase from 3.65 mol/kg (at 375 °C) to 8.4 mol/kg (at 675 °C) as shown in Table 2 . H2 selectivity of the product gas also showed 53% increase from 375 to 675 °C. The H2 selectivity of gas products generated at 675 °C was 95% compared to that generated at 375 °C (42%). The increase in CH4 concentration from 0.36 mol/kg (at 375 °C) to 1.58 mol/kg (at 675 °C) shows that methanation was favored at higher reaction temperatures. The decrease in CO concentration from 0.96 to 0.67 mol/kg with a rise in temperature from 375 to 675 °C coupled with the increment of H2 and CO2 yields suggests the dominance of water-gas shift reaction at higher SCWG temperatures (Fig. 3). High temperatures promote water-gas shift reaction, which results as the reaction of CO with H2O, consumption of CO during the reaction and production of CO2 and H2 (Nanda et al., 2016b). Several authors have suggested that water-gas shift reaction is usually endothermic but can also be moderately exothermic and kinetically preferred at high temperatures (Kruse, 2008; Kim et al., 2012; Rana et al., 2017). A decline in the yields of CO with the rise in temperature indicates that water-gas shift reaction is promoted at elevated temperatures (Guo et al., 2010). Moreover, the simultaneous increase in the yields of H2 and CO2 also indicate that water-gas shift reaction is highly preferential beyond 575 °C (Fig. 3). Lee et al. (2002) performed SCW gasification of 0.6 M glucose at 480–750 °C and 28 MPa for 10–50 s. They reported an abrupt improvement in H2 and CO2 concentrations in the product gases along with the decrease in CO yields with rising temperatures beyond 660 °C. It was attributed to a fast-type water-gas shift reaction. Furthermore, the fast-type water-gas shift reaction also corresponded to increasing CH4 yields at high temperatures (∼700 °C). These findings were in good agreement with our observations on the activity of water-gas shift reactions at elevated temperatures. Together with water-gas shift reaction, dehydrogenation of saturated compounds is also a key pathway for H2 generation (Youssef et al., 2011). The reduced CO and increased CH4 concentrations at high temperatures (675 °C) suggest that the steam reforming reaction was not prevalent during the SCWG of waste cooking oil at high temperatures. The yields of C2H6 also declined to 0.1 mol/kg at 675 °C from its initial yield of 0.46 mol/kg at 375 °C. The LHV values increased from 660 kJ/Nm3 to 1158 kJ/Nm3 with an increase in temperature from 375 to 675 °C, respectively. LHV calculations assume that the latent heat of vaporization of water in the fuel and the reaction products is not recovered. In contrast, the latent heat of vaporization of water at the end of combustion is considered in the higher heating value (HHV) or the gross calorific value. When the temperature of a hydrothermal reaction exceeds the critical temperature of water (i.e. 374 °C), a reduction in water density is observed which is similar to that of gases (∼0.1 g/cm3) (Akiya and Savage, 2002). The lowering of water density at high temperatures reduces the formation of ionic products (H+ and OH−). Although high-temperature SCW reactions lower water’s ion product formation, they also favor free radical generation, which results in superior solvation of biomass components leading to high gas yields (Guo et al., 2010). In addition, low-temperature SCW gasification leads to hydrolysis reactions (ionic mechanism) causing bond cleavage and dehydration. On the other hand, high-temperature SCW gasification results in pyrolysis reaction (i.e. free radical mechanism) causing decomposition, depolymerization, decarboxylation and deamination of biomass components."
10,Effects of feed concentration on gasification of waste cooking oil,"3.3 Effects of feed concentration on gasification of waste cooking oil The effects of feed concentration on SCWG of waste cooking oil were studied for feed concentrations ranging from 25 to 40 wt%. The variation in gas yields on SCWG of waste cooking oil at 675 °C for 30 min is known in Fig. 4 . The increase in feed concentration from 25 to 40 wt% shows a drop in H2 yields by 45% and CO2 yields by 77%. As seen from Fig. 4, H2 was relatively greater at a lower feed concentration of 25 wt% (4.1 mol/kg) than at higher feed concentration of 40 wt% (2025 mol/kg). This was dramatically reflected on the H2 selectivity of the gas products obtained with 25 wt% waste cooking oil (95%) and 40 wt% waste cooking oil (58%) (Table 2). The reduction in H2 yields at high feed concentration was due to saturation of degraded organic compounds and stabilization of hydrocarbon radicals (Sai et al., 1995; Katikaneni et al., 1995; Savage, 1999). These reactions at high feed concentrations are consequential to hydrogenation and methanation reactions leading to the formation of CH4 at the expense of H2. In a similar study, SCWG of oleic acid led to the formation of stearic acid as a saturated fatty acid in the liquid phase, which suggested the hydrogenation of oleic acid double bond and subsequent discount in H2 yields (Youssef et al., 2011). On the other hand, CO yield increased by 36% at higher feed concentration. This suggests that water-gas shift reaction and steam reforming reaction are both not favored with an increase in the feed concentrations. The increase in CH4 concentration from 1.58 to 2.16 mol/kg suggests that methanation reaction overtakes at increased feed concentrations of waste cooking oil during SCWG at 675 °C. The yields of H2 and CO2 decreased at higher feed concentrations due to their consumption in methanation reaction to produce CH4 and water (Moghadam et al., 2017). Moreover, the yield of C2H6 also elevated from 0.1 to 0.39 mol/kg at high cooking oil concentration of 40 wt%. The total gas yields decreased from 8.4 mol/kg (with 25 wt% waste cooking oil) to 6.16 mol/kg (with 40 wt% waste cooking oil) (Table 2). Since water acts as a reactant along with organic component in SCW gasification it could become the limiting reactant at higher feed concentration. Therefore, at higher feed concentration, the feed molecules are greater and water molecules are reduced, which compromise the gas yields (Nanda et al., 2016a). Moreover, the gas yields amplify due to steam reforming reactions, which are reliant on water concentration (Guo et al., 2007). In contrast, the trend of LHV showed an inclination with the rise in feed concentration. Although not drastic, LHV of the gas products increased from 1158 to 1381 kJ/Nm3 as the waste cooking oil concentration amplified from 25 wt% to 40 wt%."
11,Effects of reaction time on gasification of waste cooking oil,"3.4 Effects of reaction time on gasification of waste cooking oil The impact of reaction time was studied at variable intervals between 15 and 60 min with 25 wt% waste cooking oil concentration at 675 °C. The trends for H2 yield showed an increase from 0.95 to 5.16 mol/kg with an increase in reaction time from 15 to 60 min (Fig. 5 ). The respective yields of CO2 and CH4 also increased to 1.34 and 3.51 mol/kg at 60 min. However, the concentrations of CO and C2H6 reduced at longer reaction times. The decrease in CO yield (0.45 mol/kg) at a longer reaction time of 60 min in parallel with the increase in H2, CO2 and CH4 suggest that water-gas shift reaction and methanation reaction are propelled at longer reaction times. In addition, the steam-reforming reaction was atypical at longer reaction times for SCWG of waste cooking oil. Consequently, the H2 selectivity increased from 37% (at 15 min) to 97% (at 60 min) of SCW gasification of waste cooking oil (Table 2). The total gas yields remarkably augmented from 3.55 to 10.5 mol/kg with the lengthening of reaction time from 15 min to 60 min, respectively (Table 2). The LHV for waste cooking oil also increased from 570 kJ/Nm3 (at 15 min) to 1899 kJ/Nm3 (at 60 min). The gas yields are found to improve at longer reaction times with the dominance of thermal cracking reaction including dehydration, decomposition, decarboxylation and depolymerization (Chen et al., 2003). At low reaction times, the efficiency of hydrothermal liquefaction increases, which liquefies the reactive components to generate more stable components such as acetic acid, phenol, and methanol. Conversely, at longer reaction times, gasification reactions and free radical mechanisms are enhanced that helps in continual cracking of the intermediates to produce permanent gases. In two parallel studies by Byrd et al. (2007, 2008) on the SCW reforming of methanol, glucose and glycerol, higher CH4 yields were reported as a result of secondary reactions at longer reaction times. The secondary reactions such as methanation and hydrogenation reactions occur at longer reaction times due to the interactions between H2, CO2 and CO. In the secondary reactions, almost all H2, CO2 and CO are recycled to produce CH4, which remains relatively stable (Resende et al., 2008)."
12,Effects of catalysts on gasification of waste cooking oil,"3.5 Effects of catalysts on gasification of waste cooking oil The optimal temperature, feed concentration and reaction time for SCW gasification of waste cooking oil were found to be 675 °C, 25 wt% and 60 min, respectively. The highest H2 and total gas yields found at these optimal SCWG conditions are 5.16 mol/kg and 10.5 mol/kg, respectively. To improve the gas yields and H2 concentration in the gas products, catalysts such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 were used. At the defined conditions (675 °C, 25 wt% and 60 min), catalytic SCW gasification of waste cooking gave maximum total gas yields in the presence of 5 wt% Ni/Si-Al2O3 i.e. 21.71 mol/kg (Table 2). Among all the catalysts studied, the lowest total gas yield for observed with K2CO3 (16.65 mol/kg). The trend attained for total gas yields by the catalysts used was Ni/Si-Al2O3 > Ru/Al2O3 > Na2CO3 > K2CO3, whereas the H2 selectivity varied as K2CO3 > Ru/Al2O3 > Ni/Si-Al2O3 > Na2CO3. When compared to the non-catalytic SCWG at optimal condition (675 °C, 25 wt% and 60 min), the H2 selectivity decreased with the use of the catalyst. The H2 selectivity was lowest in the case of Na2CO3 followed by Ni/Si-Al2O3 (Table 2). Nevertheless, maximum H2 yields were observed with the application of 5 wt% of Ru/Al2O3 (10.16 mol/kg) followed by Ni/Si-Al2O3 (9.25 mol/kg), K2CO3 (8.13 mol/kg) and Na2CO3 (7.54 mol/kg) (Fig. 6 ). Ni/Si-Al2O3 (8.15 mol/kg) showed the highest yield of CH4 followed by Na2CO3 (7.86 mol/kg) suggesting their superior activities in methanation reaction during SCWG. In the case of both catalysts, CH4 concentration almost doubled compared to the non-catalytic SCWG. Nickel is an effective catalyst for methanation and hydrogenation reactions (Minowa and Ogi, 1998; Yoshida et al., 2004; Sheikhdavoodi et al., 2015). Although high levels of H2 are generated with the aid of Ni-supported catalysts in SCWG of biomass, a substantial portion of it is also consumed in methanation and hydrogenation reaction. In Ni-assisted hydrogenation, H2 is used for reduction and saturation of the organic compounds, whereas in methanation, it reacts with CO and CO2 to produce CH4. Higher yields for H2 (10.16 mol/kg) and CO (2.17 mol/kg) for Ru/Al2O3 suggest that steam reforming reaction takes place along with water-gas shift reaction when Ru is used as the active metal (Fig. 6). The findings in the current study are in accordance with the results reported by Youssef et al. (2011) on SCW gasification of oleic acid as a model compound of lipids. They reported higher H2 yields from pelletized Ru catalyst followed by powdered Ni catalysts from oleic acid gasification at SCW conditions of 400–500 °C and 28 MPa. In the current study, the combined yields of CO and CO2 from the SCWG of waste cooking oil varied as: no catalyst (1.79 mol/kg) < Na2CO3 (2.61 mol/kg) < K2CO3 (2.7 mol/kg) < Ni/Si-Al2O3 (3.6 mol/kg) < Ru/Al2O3 (6.81 mol/kg). The yields of CO and CO2 are improved due to the decarboxylation and decarbonylation of intermediate compounds and oxygenated hydrocarbons such as fatty acids and esters. It should be noted that high concentrations of CO has the ability to inhibit the gasification at low temperatures; however, high-temperature gasification can prevent this issue (Mitsuoka et al., 2011). The LHV of the gas products generated using catalyst increased owing to its high activation energy. Ni/Si-Al2O3 (4506 kJ/Nm3) showed highest LHV followed by Na2CO3 (4340 kJ/Nm3), K2CO3 (3412 kJ/Nm3), Ru/Al2O3 (3208 kJ/Nm3) and non-catalytic SCWG (1899 kJ/Nm3) (Table 2). Similarly, the total gas yields for Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 were as high as 21.4 mol/kg and 21.71 mol/kg, respectively. High total gas yield (21.4 mol/kg), high H2 selectivity (90%), maximum H2 yield (10.16 mol/kg) qualify ruthenium as one of the ideal active metals for SCWG of waste cooking oil. There are several studies that report the deactivation of Ru-based catalyst in SCW (Osada et al., 2006; Youssef et al., 2011). Ru-supported catalysts (e.g. Ru/Al2O3 or Ru/activated carbon) tend to deactivate due to the formation of aggregated Ru particles on the support. Ru/Al2O3 catalyst can deactivate because of a significant decrease in the surface area of alumina, which results from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 due to the change in its crystal structure. Lipids and fatty acids also lead to the deactivation of catalysts (Sai et al., 1995). Catalytic cracking of fatty acids enhances the generation of free radicals, which further crack to produce coke and tar. The coke tends to deposit on the catalyst and support surface causing sintering. Regardless, the application of catalysts in the SCWG of organics could initially result in the greater yields of H2, CO2 and CO through hydrolysis, thermal cracking and CC bond cleavage on the surface of catalyst/support (Cortright et al., 2002)."
13,Effects of temperature on the liquid effluents from gasification of waste cooking oil,"3.6 Effects of temperature on the liquid effluents from gasification of waste cooking oil The liquid effluents collected from waste cooking oil gasification at 375–675 °C with 25 wt% feed concentration for 30 min were assayed by NMR spectroscopy to determine the relative amounts of aqueous-soluble hydrocarbons, intermediates and byproducts. The NMR spectra were compared to the previously reported spectra of olive oil (Vlahov, 1999). The series of 1H NMR spectra of the liquid effluents obtained from the temperatures between 475 °C and 675 °C have numerous resonances, which were identified using 2D 1H–1H COSY (homonuclear correlation spectroscopy), 1H–13C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) and 1H–13C HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) methods. The 1H NMR spectra of the gasification liquid products showed many resonances over the entire chemical shift range as seen in Fig. 7 . The most notable were three large resonances corresponding to glycerol between 3.5 and 3.8 ppm. These resonances were the largest resonances in the spectrum indicating a very high concentration of glycerol. The next most abundant compound was acetic acid followed by hydroxyacetone, methanol, propionic acid, phenol, propionaldehyde and acetone. The presence of propionic acid, propionaldehyde and hydroxyacetone were consistent with gasification products of glycerol (Guo et al., 2013). The large aliphatic chain portion characteristic of vegetable oil had a very low intensity indicating that it was converted to other compounds (Vlahov, 1999). Any of the remaining original hydrophobic fatty acid chains (δ1.0–1.5 ppm) appear to have been insoluble and showed very little intensity relative to the more soluble glycerol. It is interesting to note that many of these products are consistently found in the pyrolysis of triglycerides (Maher and Bressler, 2007) and gasification of glycerol (Guo et al., 2013). The triacylglycerides and lipids hydrolyze into free fatty acids (i.e. short-chain, long-chain or volatile) and glycerol in a hydrothermal reaction medium (Vardon et al., 2014). To assist in the analysis of the relative amounts of products generated at various temperatures, the peak areas for the main compounds identified were compared and are shown in Table 3 . In this table, the proton peak areas for each compound were normalized to the peaks of Effluent-675 °C. As the SCWG temperature increased, the relative proportion of glycerol reduced significantly while some of the other trends were more subtle. Generally, as the temperature increased from 375 to 675 °C, the amounts of methanol, phenol, acetic acid and propionic acid with higher oxidation states also increased. This findings were consistent with the evolution of other gases. On the other hand, the concentrations of glycerol, acetone, hydroxyacetone and propionaldehyde decreased in the liquid phase with increasing temperature. The rise in supercritical temperature above a certain regime lowers the incidence of liquefaction and promotes gasification, which favors the free radical mechanisms such as decarboxylation (Sınaǧ et al., 2003). Decarboxylation results in the formation of fewer specific products in the liquid phase (Harry et al., 2014). The generation of phenols gradually increased in the liquid effluents with temperature, e.g. Effluent-375 °C (1.95 mM) < Effluent-675 °C (2.44 mM) (Table 3). The elimination of hydrogen from cyclic compounds led to the occurrence of aromatics such as phenols. This trend also indicates that the compounds with functional groups with higher oxidation states such as carboxylic acids and phenol increase at the expense of certain compounds such as alcohols. Moreover, certain interactions between SCWG temperature and reaction time play a key role in determining the occurrence of intermediate and degradation compounds. A combination of high temperature—short reaction time or low temperature—long reaction time increases the efficiency of hydrothermal liquefaction reaction occurring alongside gasification that primes the more reactive and less stable compounds such as glycerol, acetone and propionaldehyde to relatively stable compounds like phenol, methanol, acetic acid and propionic acid. Tilay et al. (2014) have demonstrated the extraction and fractionation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives using supercritical CO2. Therefore, these abovementioned compounds found in the liquid effluents from waste cooking oil gasification can be recovered as industrially-relevant fine chemicals and products."
14,Reaction mechanisms in hydrothermal gasification of waste cooking oil,"It is evident from the current findings that SCWG of waste cooking oil involves several thermal events and reactions that are interrelated in many ways. Fig. 8 illustrates a proposed reaction mechanism for SCWG of waste cooking oil and the interplay of chemical reactions. In public catering enterprise and household use, frying of food materials is performed in a batch of cooking oil for several days to weeks. During frying, cooking oil is continually subjected to high temperatures in the presence of air for longer periods although at intermittent intervals. This heating process of cooking oil degrades it in several reactions such as hydrolysis, oxidation and polymerization (Sanli et al., 2011). Because of hydrolysis, free fatty acids, monoglycerides and diglycerides are generated from the moisture content of the cooking oil. These products are oxidized to monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric triglycerides, as well as aldehydes and ketones. Finally, the polymerization reaction at high temperatures leads to the production of dimeric and polymeric triglycerides with ring structures. The abovementioned degradation components in cooking oil create many health issues in the digestive tract of human beings and livestock animals upon consumption (Cvengros and Cvengrosova, 2004). This makes it extremely important for the consumers to ensure a safe disposal of waste cooking oil so that it does not contaminate the food cycle or cause any kind of health concern. The chemical changes in cooking oil after prolonged frying increase its viscosity and amount of free fatty acids, but decrease the iodine number. Consequently, there is a physical change in its color and refraction with the increase in the tendency of fat for foam formation. During SCWG of waste cooking oil, several long-chain fatty acids are formed as a result of hydrolysis, decomposition and depolymerization reactions (Fig. 8). The long-chain fatty acids break down to short-chain fatty acids by CC bond cleavage and high-temperature thermal cracking. Long-chain fatty acids are further transformed into saturated fatty acids through hydrogenation, which involves the reduction reaction by H2. Moreover, H2 aids in the saturation of intermediate products and stabilization of free hydrocarbon radicals (Sai et al., 1995; Katikaneni et al., 1995; Savage, 1999). The cleavage of CC bonds in unsaturated compounds leads to the formation of hydrocarbon radicals, short-chain fatty acids and dienes (Savage, 1999). In contrast, long-chain hydrocarbons are formed through the decarboxylation of fatty acids containing CC bonds, which also result in the formation of dienes (Youssef et al., 2011). Regardless of the carbon chain, long-chain, short-chain and saturated fatty acids along with cooking oil are converted to aliphatic hydrocarbons through decarboxylation and decarbonylation. The aliphatic hydrocarbons that are generated from waste cooking oil are methanol, glycerol, propionaldehyde and propionic acid. The elimination of H2 from cyclic-compounds leads to the formation of aromatics such as phenols and its derivatives. The aromatics and cyclic compounds tend to be more stable and recalcitrant. Hence, they usually do not decompose to gases (Leeuw, 2017). In contrast, the aliphatic hydrocarbons and short-chain fatty acids produce H2, CO and CO2 through steam reforming and other gasification reactions. In the next step, CO reacts with H2O to generate H2 and CO2 through water-gas shift reaction. The fate of H2 produced can also be in hydrogenation, whereas respective fractions of CO and CO2 can be consumed in methanation reaction to yield CH4. CH4 is also a result of decomposition of intermediate aliphatic compounds such as acetic acid, propionic acid and propionaldehyde at high temperatures. Besides CH4, other light hydrocarbon gases such as acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8) are also generated through cracking of short-chain fatty acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons (Leeuw, 2017). Two reaction mechanisms prevail within the supercritical regime, especially the ionic mechanism and free radical mechanism. Near-critical pressures and temperature (<400 °C) favor ionic mechanisms, whereas higher supercritical water temperatures (≥500 °C) promote free radical mechanism (Kruse, 2008). Ionic mechanism results in the formation of organic acids and phenols as intermediate degradation products, whereas alcohols and aldehydes are the results of the free radical mechanism (Sınaǧ et al., 2003). A hydrogen-transfer reaction between hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) and methoxide (CH3O) facilitated by free-radical generates methanol (Bühler et al., 2002). Moreover, aldehydes occur by both ionic and free radical mechanisms. Due to non-polarity, fats, lipids and oils are insoluble in water at ambient conditions. However, these compounds can exhibit increased solubility in SCW at high temperature and pressures due to the decreasing dielectric constant of water (Pavlovič et al., 2013). Even in subcritical water, lipids can hydrolyze to produce fatty acids and glycerol. Cooking oil is composed of triglycerides made of fatty acids connected with glycerol by carbonyl groups. Therefore, the thermal decomposition of vegetable oil and its derivatives produce substantial amounts of glycerol in its liquid effluent phase. Furthermore, hydrothermal decomposition of glycerol results in the formation of saturated and unsaturated aldehydes and alcohols (Qadariyah et al., 2011). Catalytic hydrothermal gasification at high temperatures and long reaction times cause thermal degradation of waste cooking oil to fatty acid derivatives, aliphatics, aromatics, long-chain hydrocarbons and permanent fuel gases. The results indicate that waste cooking oil is not only a candidate feedstock for H2-rich syngas production, but also for the base chemicals generation."
15,Conclusions,"The current study was focused on SCW gasification of waste cooking oil for the purpose of hydrogen-rich syngas production. Waste cooking oil was gasified in a tubular batch SCW reactor to study the influence of process parameters such as temperature, feed concentration and reaction time. The results infer that the total gas yields (8.4 mol/kg), as well as H2 (4.1 mol/kg) yields, improved with an increase in temperature. In addition to high temperature (675 °C), lower feed concentration (25 wt%) and longer reaction time (60 min) gave a better total gas yield of 10.5 mol/kg and H2 yield of 5.16 mol/kg without any catalyst. While high temperatures favored water-gas shift reaction and dehydrogenation of saturated compounds with greater yields of H2, high feed concentrations led to methanation reaction and greater CH4 yields. The activity of alkali catalysts e.g. Na2CO3 and K2CO3, as well as metal catalysts e.g. Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 were also investigated on the SCW gasification of waste cooking oil. The catalyst-assisted SCW gasification resulted in an increase in the total gases and H2 yields in the range of 19–21.7 mol/kg and 7.54–10.16 mol/kg, respectively. The catalytic study reveals that Ru/Al2O3 demonstrated maximum H2 yield (10.16 mol/kg) due to water-gas shift reaction, whereas Ni/Si-Al2O3 resulted in high CH4 (8.15 mol/kg) yield due to methanation and hydrogenation reactions. Acetic acid, propionic acid and propionaldehyde were found to be the intermediate degradation compounds generated from the SCWG of waste cooking oil at high temperatures that eventually generated methanol, phenol, acetone, hydroxyacetone and glycerol in the liquid products. Though the use of vegetable oil has been realized for biodiesel production, its use as a source of H2 is least explored. This study is clearly one of the initial reports to suggest the effective remediation and valorization of waste cooking oil that is an abundant organic waste generated at a global scale. The use of waste cooking oil as a feedstock can help generate H2 for green fuel production while at the same time reducing the waste oil disposal issues that are a threat to the natural environment."
