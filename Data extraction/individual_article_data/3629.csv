0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production methods include by-product hydrogen generation, natural gas reforming, water electrolysis, and biological processes (Holladay et al., 2009; Turner, 2004). Currently, the most widely used commercial methods include by-product hydrogen generation and natural gas reforming (Guo et al., 2010; Nath and Das, 2003). By-product hydrogen is produced by separating hydrogen from the hydrogen mixed gas that is emitted during industrial processes such as petrochemical refining (Steinberg and Cheng, 1989). Currently, while there is no shortage of hydrogen, the amount of the element that can be utilized as fuel for hydrogen cars or fuel cell power generation is limited. Although a large amount of hydrogen is produced in petrochemical complexes, most of it is used within the industry, as hydrogen utilization in the existing industries is high. Therefore, it is difficult to use the by-product hydrogen freely for hydrogen cars and fuel cell power generation. The most economical method of producing hydrogen for overcoming this limitation is natural gas reforming (Slinn et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2008). Natural gas reforming is a method of decomposing natural gas into high-temperature, high-pressure steam. It accounts for more than half of the world's total hydrogen production (Farrauto et al., 2003). It is the cheapest way to produce hydrogen through a physicochemical process (Holladay et al., 2009). The most environment-friendly hydrogen production method is water electrolysis (Rosen, 2015). However, it incurs a high cost for electricity supply (Wang et al., 2014). Finally, biological processes for hydrogen production do not require fossil fuels, chemicals, or a large amount of electricity (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001). Despite these advantages of biological hydrogen (hereafter termed as biohydrogen) production, its commercialization is delayed, primarily due to low conversion yield and difficulty in achieving stable hydrogen production (Lee et al., 2010; Nath and Das, 2004). Several researchers are attempting to overcome the limitations of the biohydrogen production process (Kraemer and Bagley, 2007; Wang and Wan, 2009). In particular, they have attempted to improve hydrogen production efficiency by optimizing operational conditions (e.g., hydraulic retention time, organic loading rate, pH, and temperature) (Fang and Liu, 2002; Jo et al., 2008), and adding membranes and supporting materials for biohydrogen production (Park et al., 2018c; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). However, such methods do not provide a fundamental solution, as they cannot be applied to all hydrogen production processes, and hydrogen production increases only under certain conditions. Recently, many studies have reported that anaerobic digestion efficiency can be improved by supplementing with conductive materials such as granular activated carbon (GAC), magnetite, and polymers (Park et al., 2018a). The conductive materials improve anaerobic digestion performance by enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer between two groups of microorganisms (exoelectrogens and methanogens) involved in anaerobic digestion (methane fermentation). While minimal research has been conducted on the effect of supplementation of conductive materials on biohydrogen production, some researchers have reported the positive effects of conductive material supplementation on hydrogen production without an explanation of the mechanisms. They speculate that the enhanced biohydrogen production is due to the increase in microbial growth or concentration and decrease in toxic materials in the hydrogen producing reactors (Jamali et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2007). Nevertheless, changes in the metabolic pathways by conductive material supplementation is virtually unknown. Without such research, sustainable development in the field of biohydrogen production would be difficult. The main objectives of this study are i) to evaluate the effects of GAC supplementation on biohydrogen production, ii) to identify the functional genes associated with hydrogen metabolism, and iii) to propose metabolic pathways for increasing the performance of hydrogen production by GAC supplementation. To achieve these objectives, batch tests with and without GAC supplementation were conducted in order to observe the changes in hydrogen production. Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the functional genes involved in hydrogen production."
1,Methods,
2,Strain and pre-culture,"2.1 Strain and pre-culture Clostridium butyricum DSM10702 was used as a model hydrogen-producing bacterium. Pre-cultivation was carried out to obtain a uniform inoculum prior to the main cultivation for biohydrogen production. The freeze-dried stocks of strains with 25% glycerol were activated at 37 ℃ and 200 rpm for more than 12 h using a Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM; Difco Laboratories, USA). The inoculum was transferred to the medium for biohydrogen production as the bacteria reached the exponential phase by activation."
3,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen fermentation All cultures for the biohydrogen production were prepared with a working volume of 100 mL in a 160-mL serum bottle, and the initial concentration of inoculums was 0.1 optical density (Park et al., 2001). The composition of the culture medium (modified RCM) for the hydrogen fermentation was as follows (Park et al., 2018b): 10 g/L of peptone, 10 g/L of beef extract, 3 g/L of yeast extract, 5 g/L of dextrose, 1 g/L of soluble starch, 5 g/L of sodium chloride, 3 g/L of sodium acetate, 0.5 g/L of L-cysteine hydrochloride, 5 g/L of sodium bicarbonate, 100 ul/L of antifoam, and 10 g/L of granular activated carbon (GAC) as a conductive material. All tests were conducted in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Manufacturing, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) using a mixed gas with 85% N2, 10% H2, and 5% CO2, at 60 and 200 rpm. The pH was maintained at approximately 7 during the hydrogen fermentation using sodium bicarbonate."
4,Adsorption test of VFAs and glucose on GAC,"2.3 Adsorption test of VFAs and glucose on GAC Isotherm adsorption tests were conducted to confirm the amount of sugar and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) adsorbed in the culture medium by GAC (Hamdaoui and Naffrechoux, 2007; Liu et al., 2010). The concentration of sugar and VFAs in the reaction solution for the isotherm adsorption test was determined based on a series of cultures previously tested. The concentration of GAC in the reaction solution was 1–30 g/L, while the concentrations of glucose, lactic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid were 5.0, 0.7, 3.0, and 1.5 g/L, respectively."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The hydrogen in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC; 6890 N, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a 10 m × 300 μm CP-Molsieve 5A capillary column (Lo et al., 2010). The temperatures of the inlet, the oven, and the detector of GC were 100 ℃, 80 ℃, and 250 ℃, respectively. The biogas obtained from the serum bottles was analyzed with 10 mL/min of high purity nitrogen (99.999%) as a carrier gas at a split ratio of 10:1. Sugars and VFAs in the culture medium were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; 1200 series, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) using a refractive index detector (RID) and a 300 mm × 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column with 5-mM H2SO4 as the mobile phase for 40 min (Park et al., 2018b). Prior to the injection of the sample into the HPLC inlet, the liquid samples were filtered by a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) membrane filter (ADVANTEC, Japan) with a pore size of 0.45 μm after centrifugation."
6,Kinetic analysis,"2.5 Kinetic analysis The gas (biogas and hydrogen) production as function of time were fitted to the values estimated using a modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)), to estimate ultimate gas volume, maximum gas production rate, lag-phase of gas production, and R-square (Park et al., 2014). (1) H = P × - e x p R m P × λ - t × e + 1 where H is the cumulative gas volume (mL), P is the ultimate gas volume (mL), Rm is the maximum gas production rate (mL/hr), λ is the lag time of gas production, t is the time (hr), and e is the exponential (1)."
7,RNA sequencing,"2.6 RNA sequencing For analyze RNA sequencing, RNA was extracted from each condition of samples (Control and GAC supplementation test) using the MoBio RNA PowerSoil total RNA isolation kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocols. RNA purity was determined by assaying 1 µl of the total RNA extract on a NanoDrop8000 spectrophotometer. Total RNA integrity was evaluated using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN). The mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina Truseq stranded mRNA library prep kit). The mRNA was purified and fragmented from the total RNA (1 ug) using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads with two rounds of purification. The cleaved RNA fragments, primed with random hexamers, were reverse transcribed into the first strand of cDNA using reverse transcriptase, random primers, and dUTP instead of dTTP. (The incorporation of dUTP quenches the second strand during amplification, because the polymerase does not incorporate beyond this nucleotide.) These cDNA fragments were subjected to the addition of a single 'A' base and the subsequent ligation of the adapter. The products were purified and enriched with PCR to create the final strand specific cDNA library. The quality of the amplified libraries was verified by capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer, Agilent). After qPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), the libraries that were index tagged in equimolar amounts in the pool were combined. Cluster generation occurred in the flow cell on the cBot automated cluster generation system (Illumina). Subsequently, the flow cell was loaded on the HiSeq 2500 sequencing system (Illumina), and sequencing was performed with a read length of 2 × 100 bp."
8,Read mapping,"2.7 Read mapping At first, the reads for each sample were mapped to the reference genome for Clostridium butyricum by Tophat (v2.0.13) (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/). The aligned results were added to Cuffdiff (v2.2.0) (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/) to report differentially expressed genes. For library normalization and dispersion estimation, geometric and pooled (“blind” when each condition has a single replicate, or “pooled” when multiple replicates are available) methods (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/) were applied. The Cuffdiff data were added to CummeRbund (v2.8.2) (http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/manual_2_0.html) to visualize the RNA-seq data."
9,Identification of DEGs and functional enrichment analysis,"2.8 Identification of DEGs and functional enrichment analysis Cuffdiff provides various output files. Using one of its outputs, the “gene_exp.diff”, DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) were identified. To detect DEGs between sample 1 as the control and sample 2 as the case, two filtering processes were applied. Firstly, using the Cuffdiff status code, genes that only had an “OK” status were extracted. The status code indicates whether each condition contains sufficient reads in a locus for a reliable calculation of the expression level, and the “OK” status means the test is successful in calculating the gene expression level. For the second filtering, a 2-fold change was calculated and the genes belonging to the following range were selected. Up - regulated:log 2 case - log 2 control > log 2 2 = 1 Down - regulated: l o g 2 [ case ] - log 2 [ control ] < log 2 ( 1 / 2 ) = - 1 For ontology analysis, genes after the 2-fold change were selected (for bacteria samples, genes with 2 fold & p-value <0.05 & FDR (False Discovery Rate) <0.1 were selected for ontology analysis) and applied to DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) as an input to obtain a comprehensive set of functional annotations. Disease, Gene ontology, and pathway categories were selected, and the Ease score was changed from 0.1 to 1 to include more output. Ease score is a conservative adjustment to the Fisher exact probability. It assigns weights significantly in favor of the association supported by more genes. DAVID then generated the functional annotation chart, which lists annotation terms and their associated genes under study."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Batch test of hydrogen production with GAC supplementation,"3.1 Batch test of hydrogen production with GAC supplementation 3.1.1 Hydrogen production Fig. 1 shows cumulative biogas (CO2 and hydrogen) and biohydrogen production profiles with and without GAC supplementation using the modified RCM. Hydrogen fermentation was conducted for 16 h until its production was complete. Gompertz analysis was adapted for obtaining the kinetic parameters on hydrogen production including ultimate hydrogen production volume, maximum hydrogen production rate, and lag phase (Table 1 ). All experiments showed similar lag times for biogas and hydrogen production, irrespective of the GAC supplementation. However, the other aspects of hydrogen production performance showed a remarkable difference with GAC supplementation. The biogas and biohydrogen production increased by 27.1 and 38.0%, respectively, with GAC supplementation. Moreover, the maximum biogas and biohydrogen production rates increased significantly by 37.9 and 50.8%, respectively. Several researchers have reported on the potential benefits of GAC on anaerobic digestion. Firstly, GAC could absorb toxic compounds such as levulinic acid, formic acid, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (Park et al., 2012) that might otherwise inhibit microorganisms involved in biohydrogen production (Wang and Han, 2012). Hydrogen fermentation was conducted using RCM, a growth medium optimized for the Clostridium species, to reduce the probability of growth medium contamination though toxic substances. Secondly, GAC has a high specific area due to its porous structure. Therefore, it can provide favorable sites for microorganisms to attach and grow, and it can extend the retention of microorganisms in some reactor designs (Aziz et al., 2011). However, the possibility of this is low in a batch culture without flow due to a short culture period (approximately 1 day). An additional possibility can be created by the adsorption of acetate and butyrate in the hydrogen production reactor by GAC. According to Le Chatelier's law, high product concentrations can decrease the reaction rates, while low product concentrations (e.g., adsorption of products) can accelerate the reaction rates. To investigate whether the hydrogen production performance was enhanced by the adsorption, an experiment was carried out using GAC saturated with acetic acid, butyric acid, and a mixture of acetic acid and butyric acid. The amounts of biogas and biohydrogen production were constant regardless of whether the organic acid was saturated or not. This result suggests that the enhanced biohydrogen production observed in this study was caused by a mechanism other than GAC adsorption. Additionally, a high rate agitation test (200 rpm) was conducted to exclude the growth of microorganisms adhering to the GAC surface. The result shows that hydrogen production performance was not altered significantly in the high agitation condition. 3.1.2 Metabolite production Metabolites such as acetate, butyrate, lactate, and ethanol are important indicators of the hydrogen production performance. Among them, acetate and butyrate are well-known by-products of hydrogen production, as shown in Eqs. (2) and (3) (Park et al., 2015). (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO - + 2 HCO 3 - + 4 H + + 4 H 2 Δ G ′ 0 = - 206 KJ / mol (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO - + 2 HCO 3 - + 3 H + + 2 H 2 + Δ G ′ 0 = - 254 KJ / mol From Eqs. (2) and (3), the maximum hydrogen yield is two and four moles for one mole of glucose metabolism, when acetate and butyrate are the end products, respectively. Usually, the butyrate generation pathway is more prevalent than the acetate production pathway in the biohydrogen fermentation by Clostridium due to the thermodynamic preference (Liu et al., 2011). Therefore, hydrogen production yield is generally close to two moles or slightly higher. On the other hand, lactate and ethanol are end products that do not produce hydrogen (Lin et al., 2007). These substances are indicators of an unstable hydrogen production process. Table 2 shows the profile of VFAs over the hydrogen fermentation period. The final concentrations of acetate and butyrate were not significantly different. The acetic acid concentration at the end of fermentation was 3.1 and 3.2 g/L with GAC supplementation and without GAC, respectively (initial acetic acid concentration was approximately 1.3 g/L in both tests). GAC supplementation increased the butyrate production by 11.2 and 28.4% at 10 and 15 h, respectively. However, butyrate concentrations were similar at the end of fermentation (2.4 g/L), irrespective of GAC supplementation. On the other hand, the changes in lactic acid concentration were very different with and without GAC supplementation. The concentration of lactic acid increased to 0.97 ± 0.01 (without GAC) and 0.84 ± 0.02 g/L (with GAC), respectively, at 8 h of fermentation. The accumulation of lactic acid without hydrogen production indicates that the hydrogen yield is low. After 8 h of fermentation, the lactic acid rapidly decreased by 97% (from 0.84 ± 0.02 to 0.02 ± 0.02 g/L during 6 h) with GAC supplementation, while lactic acid decreased by only 23.5% (from 0.97 ± 0.01 to 0.74 ± 0.01 g/L during 6 h) without GAC supplementation. The lactic acid reduction is noteworthy. Lactic acid is a well-known strong inhibitor of hydrogen production (Noike et al., 2002) as well as a substrate with acetate during hydrogen production (Matsumoto and Nishimura, 2007). One mole of lactic acid with 0.27–0.4 mol of acetic acid can produce ∼0.7 mol of butyric acid with 0.47–0.6 mol of hydrogen by Clostridium (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995; Tao et al., 2016). The increase in hydrogen production by GAC supplementation could be explained by stimulation of the metabolic pathway associated with simultaneous utilization of lactic acid and acetic acid as the substrates, especially for the later period of the batch experiment. However, the measured values of the produced by-products might be different from the actual (total) values, as GAC is an efficient adsorbent for the compounds observed during hydrogen fermentation (e.g. glucose, acetic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid). The experiments were conducted by supplementing GAC between 0.1 and 3.0 g/L. Amounts of the compounds adsorbed could be negligible for the low GAC supplementations. However, the amounts of the compounds adsorbed would increase significantly for the high GAC supplementations and, in turn, the measured concentrations of the compounds might be lower than the actual concentrations. Further discussion is presented in Section 3.2.2."
12,Effect of various GAC concentrations on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of various GAC concentrations on hydrogen production 3.2.1 Hydrogen production To evaluate the effect of GAC concentration on the hydrogen production, batch tests were conducted at various GAC concentrations (0–3 g/L of GAC). Fig. 2 shows the profiles of biogas and hydrogen production by supplementing GAC. Hydrogen production performance increased as the GAC supplementation increased. For example, the ultimate production of biogas and the maximum hydrogen production rates increased by 1.7 and 2.3 times, respectively, by supplementing 3 g/L of GAC. Interestingly, the ultimate biogas and biohydrogen production increased by 39.5 and 57.9%, respectively, with only 0.1 g/L of GAC supplementation. Furthermore, the maximum biogas and biohydrogen production rates increased up to 2.3 and 3.3 times, respectively, by supplementing 3 g/L of GAC. However, the lag times for biogas (3.6–4.1 h) and hydrogen production (37–4.1 h) were not significantly different, regardless of the amount of GAC supplementation. Table 3 shows the kinetic parameters of hydrogen production performance according to the various concentrations of GAC. 3.2.2 Profile of metabolites Fig. 3 (a) shows the profiles of acetate and butyrate production based on the GAC supplementation concentration. Acetate concentration increased from 0.73 to 0.84 g/L with increasing GAC concentration. However, the butyrate concentration increased from 2.0 to 2.8 g/L until 1 g/L of GAC supplementation and subsequently decreased with higher GAC (2 and 3 g/L of GAC) supplementation. This phenomenon is closely related to the adsorption properties of GAC (Štandeker et al., 2007), as discussed in Section 3.1. High concentrations of GAC supplementation appear to inhibit hydrogen production. However, lower concentrations of organic acids were measured than the initial concentrations due to the adsorption of the produced organic acids by GAC. Acetate and butyrate are important indicators in understanding the metabolic pathway of hydrogen production (Park et al., 2015). Therefore, adsorption tests by GAC were carried out in order to more accurately identify the amount of organic acids produced. The adsorption tests were conducted with the mixtures present in the hydrogen fermenter (glucose, acetate, butyrate, and lactate) based on the various GAC concentrations (Fig. S1). A total of 1.2 g/L of the substances was adsorbed with 1 g/L GAC supplementation, and the adsorption ratio of glucose, lactate, acetate, and butyrate in the mixture were 9.3, 8.3, 16.6, and 65.8% respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows the acetate and butyrate produced by considering the amount adsorbed by GAC. Acetate and butyrate concentrations were 1.6 and 3.6 g/L with 3 g/L of GAC supplementation. These values were 2.1 and 1.8 times higher than the control, respectively. These results suggest that GAC stimulated the metabolic pathway producing acetate and butyrate, and activated the acetate production pathway to produce hydrogen. Another possible reason for the increase in hydrogen production can be the change in lactate concentration during hydrogen production. Fig. 4 shows the change in lactate during hydrogen production with GAC supplementation. Lactate increased for 5 h after the start of hydrogen production, regardless of GAC supplementation. After 5 h, the lactate concentration decreased with GAC supplementation, except for the control. As the GAC supplementation increased, the lactate reduction rate also accelerated. This decrease can be clearly distinguished from the adsorption by GAC. The lactic acid concentration was decreased by 1.1 g/L with supplementing 0.1 g/L of GAC, and only 0.25 g/L of lactate remained 25 h after the start of hydrogen production. The reduction of lactic acid by GAC supplementation can be explained by three possible mechanisms: i) adsorption of lactic acid by GAC, ii) consumption of lactic acid together with acetic acid as a substrate, as discussed in the Section 3.1.2, and iii) conversion of lactic acid to pyruvate. For the third mechanism, Buhl and Jackson (1978) reported that lactic acid can be converted to pyruvate by lactic acid dehydrogenase. This conversion may also explain increased hydrogen production, as pyruvate is funneled to acetic acid and butyric acid production pathways. Considering availability of several lines of experimental evidence (Jamali et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2007), the increased hydrogen production by GAC supplementation may work in continuous mode operation as well as in batch vials. This suggests that the increased hydrogen production was not due to GAC’s adsorption of some inhibitory organic acids (e.g. lactic acid) for hydrogen production, as GAC would lose its adsorption ability in a long-term operation. Nevertheless, in the near future, it is necessary to conduct a systematic experiment with continuous mode operation to monitor hydrogen production in association with organic acids adsorption by GAC over operational time."
13,Transcriptome analysis,"3.3 Transcriptome analysis To identify differential gene expression due to GAC supplementation, RNA-seq was conducted. Total RNA samples were collected from the reactors with and without GAC supplementation at 10 h from the beginning of hydrogen fermentation. RNA was expressed the most actively at approximately 10 h, as hydrogen was produced the most actively at that time. A total of 4,207 mRNA were identified via RNA-seq. Among them, 906 mRNA were categorized as hypothetical proteins. RNA-seq data show significantly different gene expression levels (up- or down-regulation) with GAC supplementation. The relative expression levels for mRNA based on Log2 conversion were estimated as fold changes. A total of 1,329 mRNA exhibited over 2 folds changes (up regulation: 655 mRNA, down regulation: 674 mRNA). The differentially regulated genes were clustered based on functional annotations using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database ( http://clove.org ) (Parreira et al., 2016). Over 50% of the annotated genes were affiliated with transport and metabolism (15.2%); translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (13.0%); post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones (12.8%); and energy production and conversion-related proteins (11.9%; Table 4 ). Furthermore, a potential metabolic pathway flux was suggested based on the RNA-seq result (high abundance of reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) >50) (Fig. 5 ). Calusinska et al. (2015) reported that nitrogenase is more important than other genes such as various hydrogenases (f hydA2, hydA8, hydB2, hydB3) for biohyrogen production (Calusinska et al., 2015). In this study, nitrogenase gene expression also increased up to 4.70 times with GAC supplementation; however, the RPKM value is lower than 50. Also, genes involved in nitrogen metabolism such as N-carbamoylputrescine, Asp-ammonialyase, L-asparaginase, Allophanate hydrogenase, and Urea carboxylase were rarely observed. RNA-seq results were mapped and analyzed using the Kegg pathway of Clostridium butyricum (Gungormusler-Yilmaz et al., 2014). Glucose entered the inner cell via the phosphotransferase system, and was converted to pyruvate by phosphorylation. Subsequently, pyruvate is converted to various organic acids and alcohols such as acetate, butyrate, lactate, and ethanol through several metabolic pathways. Among them, acetic acid is produced with four moles of hydrogen, butyric acid consumes two moles of hydrogen to produce two moles of hydrogen, and lactic acid and ethanol consume four moles of hydrogen. In terms of hydrogen production efficiency, a high amount of hydrogen production can be expected when acetic acid and butyric acid are produced in large amounts and lactic acid and ethanol are produced in small amounts. Lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) are involved in the production of lactate and ethanol, which are representative hydrogen consuming products (Nakashimada et al., 2002). They decreased by 1.78 and 0.67 times with GAC supplementation. The amount of beta-hydroxylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (hbd) and crotonase involved in butyrate production from acetyl-CoA decreased by 2.45 and 1.64 times, respectively. On the other hand, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pfor) and 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (oxct) increased by 1.75 and 1.48 times, respectively. pfor reduces hydrogen ions to hydrogen using the electrons generated when pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA. oxct is a functional gene that converts acetyl-CoA to acetate, which does not consume the four moles of hydrogen produced in the upper stage (from glucose uptake to acetyl-CoA production). Instead, it is released as the final product with acetic acid. Overall, the hydrogen production with GAC supplementation increased the hydrogen production ability probably by shifting the metabolic pathway associated more closely with hydrogen production than with hydrogen consumption. It is necessary to note that samples for the transcriptome analysis were taken during the middle of the batch experiment. Considering that the products containing organic acids showed a larger difference in the hydrogen fermentation after the middle, the mechanism for the increased hydrogen production could be different in the later period. For example, lactic acid together with acetic acid could be a substrate for hydrogen production and result in increased hydrogen production, as discussed in the Section 3. 1. 2."
14,Conclusions,"Supplementation of GAC to hydrogen fermenters significantly increased maximum hydrogen production as well as production rate. Transcriptome analysis was conducted to identify the mechanisms of the enhanced biohydrogen production. GAC primarily increased biohydrogen production capacity of Clostridium butyricum by altering its metabolic pathways to those that are favorable for hydrogen production. The genes and metabolites of the biohydrogen production pathways were activated (pfor and oxct), while biohydrogen consumption pathways were suppressed (ldh, adh, hbd, crt, and buk). In addition, the GAC supplementation converted lactate into pyruvate, thereby securing additional hydrogen production potential."
