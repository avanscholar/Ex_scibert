0,Introduction,"Nowadays, hydrogen is identified to be an ideal energy carrier with high efficiency since it possesses the highest energy content per unit of weight (about 120.7MJ/kg) compared to any other known fuels. It burns cleanly, without generating any environmental pollutants and the only by-product is water. Hydrogen will play an important role in the future global economy. In particular, its production is an attractive subject of current interest for fuel cell applications [1–3], which are considered to have the potential to provide a clean energy source for automobile as an alternative to gasoline or diesel engines. Hydrogen is also one of most important chemicals and is widely used for ammonia production, oil refineries, and methanol production etc. Currently, main processes for producing commercial hydrogen are catalytic steam reforming of natural gas and oil-derived naphtha, partial oxidation of heavy oils, gasification of coal as well as electrolysis of water [4,5]. In view of growing environmental concerns such as global warming and the depletion of fossil fuel, major efforts are being dedicated to develop the utilization of renewable energy sources. Biomass has been proposed as an alternative to produce hydrogen and other basic chemical building blocks [3,6–8], because this renewable rich resource does not contribute to a net increase in atmospheric CO2. There are different routes proposed for biomass conversion into hydrogen or hydrogen-rich gas, mainly including thermochemical conversion and bio-chemical/biological conversion [9,10]. For production of hydrogen by thermochemical conversion such as biomass gasification [11,12], biomass catalytic pyrolysis [13,14] and catalytic steam reforming of liquids derived from biomass (bio-oil) etc. [15,16] have been widely investigated. Gasification is the conversion of biomass into a combustible gas mixture (e.g., H2, CO, CH4 etc.) by the partial oxidation of biomass at high temperatures (typically in the range of 800–900°C) [17]. The route of the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production involves fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil, and reforming of it to produce a gaseous rich-hydrogen mixture. The bio-oil generally contains numerous and complex oxygenated organic compounds including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, substituted phenolics and other oxygenates derived from biomass carbohydrates and lignin [18] and it represents another potential source of renewable chemicals [19–21]. The bio-oil can be further reformed via steam over reforming catalyst in order to obtain high content of hydrogen. In view of higher yield of hydrogen, production of hydrogen through the reforming of bio-oil may be one of the most promising options in various routes proposed for biomass conversion into hydrogen [8]. Generally, the steam reforming of bio-oil is simplified as the steam reforming of the oxygenated organic compound (C n H m O k ) by the following reactions [48,49]: (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O = n CO + ( n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 ( steam reforming reactions ) The above reaction is followed by the water–gas shift reaction: (2) n CO + n H 2 O → n CO 2 + n H 2 ( WGS reaction ) Therefore, the overall process can be represented as follows: (3) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 The steam reforming of the bio-oil proceeds according to the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds (C n H m O k ) in bio-oil with water and the further water–gas shift reaction. For the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil [22–30], it has been explored via the reforming catalysts including the oxide catalysts, the Ni-based catalysts, and noble metal-loaded catalysts etc. Lower reforming temperature is essential from the viewpoint of economy. Noble metals (Pt, Ru, Rh) are generally more effective than the Ni-based catalysts and less carbon depositing [31–34]. Such catalysts are not common in real applications because of their high cost. Another hindering for the catalytic reforming of bio-oil is the deactivation of catalysts due to coke or oligomer deposition even in the presence of an excess of steam (S/C>5) [15,36]. Thus, it is very significant to realize low temperature reforming of bio-oil using non-noble metal catalysts. It is also important to decrease carbon deposits during the bio-oil's reforming process. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a unique form of carbon, which is a promising alternative support material owing to their intrinsic properties such as high surface area, unique electronic properties and chemical inertness, thermal stability and high mechanical strength [37,38]. It has been confirmed that CNTs are suitable supports for many kinds of metal catalysts [40–42]. For example, Planeix reported that ruthenium supported on carbon nanotubes exhibited high selectivity toward unsaturated alcohol in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [40]. Chambers et al. reported that both the activity and selectivity of 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation could be dramatically altered when the metal was dispersed on graphite nanofibers [41]. They assumed that the strong interaction between metal nano-particles and the p-electrons of the support medium was responsible for the difference of catalytic performance. However, the synthesis of CNTs-supported metal catalysts with high dispersion and high catalytic activity remains a challenge. In our previous work, attention has been paid to the fast pyrolysis of biomass [43–47] and the production of hydrogen and bio-syngas from bio-oil [28,29,50,51] and the synthesis of liquid bio-fuels such as gasoline and diesel etc. [29] We have investigated the catalytic steam reforming for bio-oil, acetic acid and ethanol by using various reforming catalysts such as Ni-Al2O3, C12A7, metal-doped C12A7 and NiCuZn–Al2O3 reforming catalyst [28,51–54]. In particular, a low-temperature reforming approach for the production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming of organic compounds has been proposed [52–54]. The main aim in this work is to promote the reforming of the bio-oil via the current applied to the high-dispersion Ni-CNTs catalyst, indicating that it is useful for increasing the yield of hydrogen by the low-temperature reforming of the organic compounds in bio-oil."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) (i.d. 5–10nm, o.d. 20–40nm, length 10–30μm) produced by exploiting chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes were purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd., Chinese Academy of Science. The as-received CNTs were purified and oxidized by concentrated HNO3/H2SO4 (3:1) at 90°C for 4h, then thoroughly washed and dried for further use. The Ni-CNTs catalyst was prepared by the homogeneous deposition–precipitation method. 8.7g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in 600-mL deionized water and 10.0g of the oxidized CNTs were added. 1h ultrasonic treatment was carried out for a good dispersion of the CNTs in the solution. When needed, the suspension was brought to pH 2 with a few drops of HNO3. While stirring, the suspension was brought to 90°C and kept at that temperature during the precipitation. An aqueous solution containing 5.4g urea was added at the final temperature. After deposition for 18h and cooling to room temperature, the loaded CNTs were washed, dried at 120°C and then reduced in a 20% hydrogen-in-nitrogen flow (100ml/min) at 400°C for 3h at 1bar. In this way, 15wt% Ni-CNTs catalyst was prepared. Different contents of Ni supported on CNTs were also prepared by adjusting the proportion of nickel nitrate hexahydrate, CNTs and urea. 15wt% Ni-γAl2O3 was prepared by the same method. After deposition, the mixture was dried at 120°C and calcined at 600°C, then reduced in a 20% hydrogen-in-nitrogen flow (100ml/min) at 600°C for 3h at 1bar."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The metallic element contents in the prepared catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP/AES, Atom scan Advantage of Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation, USA). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume were evaluated from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at 77K over the whole range of relative pressures by using a COULTER SA 3100 analyzer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured on an X'pert Pro Philips diffractrometer with a Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure of the catalyst was examined with conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Japan H-800), which has a primary electron energy of 200keV and a point resolution of 0.45nm in TEM mode. The powder sample was dispersed in ethanol and kept in an ultrasonic bath for 3h, then the sample was deposited onto a carbon-covered Cu supporting grid and dried at 25°C for TEM analysis. The XPS measurements were performed on an ESCALAB-250 (Thermo-VG Scientific, USA) spectrometer with Al Ka (1486.6eV) irradiation source. The normalized XPS intensities, which are proportional to the concentrations of the corresponding elements in the surface layer, were determined as the integrated peak area divided by their corresponding sensitivity factor. The C (1s) peak at 284.6eV was generally used as a calibration standard for determining the peaks' position and the elemental concentration. The hydrogen chemisorption and temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) were carried out using a self-designed apparatus that included gas chromatographic and data processing systems. For each experiment, 50mg of catalyst was initially reduced at 400°C for 2h, then the reduced sample was treated in a flow of argon at the reduction temperature for 0.5h (flow rate=100cm3/min) and then cooled to room temperature under argon atmosphere. H2 adsorption processed at room temperature for 1h. After removing all the physically adsorbed H2 with Ar flow, H2-TPD was conducted from 30 to 600°C at a constant rate of 10K/min. Amount of H2 desorption during H2-TPD is measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amount of surface nickel atoms was calculated from the amount of desorbed H2, assuming a stoichiometry of one hydrogen molecule adsorbed per two surface nickel atoms. The nickel dispersion is calculated as the percentage of surface nickel atoms with respect to total nickel atoms in the catalysts."
4,Bio-oil,"2.3 Bio-oil Bio-oil, also called pyrolysis oil or pyrolysis liquid, was produced by the fast pyrolysis of biomass in a circulating fluidized bed with a capacity of 120kg/h of oil at our Lab (patent: ZL01263584.7, the Anhui Province Key Laboratory of the Biomass Clean Energy). The pyrolysis temperature ranged from 420 to 540°C, which was supplied by the byproducts of charcoal formed in the bio-oil production process. The pyrolysis of biomass was generally performed with a heating rate of about 104 °C/s for a residence time of less than 2s and was followed by a fast cooling process. The main products of the fast pyrolysis of biomass consisted of liquid bio-oil (55–70wt%), a mixture gaseous products (e.g., CO2, CO, CH4, etc.), and charcoal. Bio-oils are dark-brown organic liquids and comprise different molecular weight products derived from depolymerization and fragmentation reactions of three key biomass building blocks: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Therefore, the elemental composition of bio-oil varied with different feedstocks of biomass. Some physical and chemical properties of the bio-oils derived from the sawdust, rice husk, and cotton stalk powder were summarized in our previous paper [52,53] (Table 1 ). The bio-oils contain a large number of complex compounds such as hydroxyaldehydes, hydroxyketones, sugars, carboxylic acids, phenolics, and so forth. The distribution of these compounds depends on the type of biomass used and on the pyrolysis process conditions (temperature, residence time, and heating rate). Because the main elemental composition of the pyrolysis bio-oils was C, H, and O, we described the oxygenated organic compounds in the pyrolysis bio-oils with a chemical formula of C n H m O k ·xH2O. As for bio-oil derived from sawdust, the chemical formula is CH1.48O0.53·0.32H2O (Table 2 ). The crude oil derived from the pyrolysis of biomass contains some amounts of nonvolatile materials (35–40wt%) such as sugars and oligomeric phenolics etc., which are generally difficult to be reformed and easily lead to carbon depositions on the catalyst surface. Thus, the volatile organic components of the crude bio-oil, obtained from vaporizing the crude bio-oil from 60°C to 180°C, were used for present experiments. The amount of the volatile organic components was about 50–60wt% of the crude oil [45]. The oxygenated organic compound in the volatile components was represented as a chemical formula of CH2.03O0.67·0.89H2O (Table 2). Some of the most important compounds in the crude bio-oil from sawdust have been reported in Ref. [45]. The volatile organic components obtained from vaporizing the crude bio-oil have not been investigated, which will be studied in our future work."
5,Reaction system,"2.4 Reaction system As shown in Fig. 1 , the bio-oil steam reforming experiments were carried out in the continuous flow systems, using a quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. To obtain a stable and quantitative carbon feeding, the bio-oil was fed into the reactors using the micro-injection pumps (Model: TS2-60, Longer Precision Pump). On the other hand, the steam from the stream-generator was simultaneously fed into the reactors for adjusting the S/C ratio (mol ratio of steam to carbon in bio-oil fed). The steam amount fed and the effluent gases from the reactors were controlled and measured by the mass flow controllers. The steam amount was also calibrated before running the reforming experiments. The reaction temperature and its distribution were measured by the thermocouples inserted into the catalyst beds. This system contains two different function modes — Common Steam Reforming (CSR) mode and Electrochemical Catalytic Reforming (ECR) mode. ECR mode was used when testing the effects of current on the steam reforming of the bio-oil; while CSR mode was taken placed in other tests [52–54]. For the ECR mode, an annular Ni–Cr wire, which passed through a given ac electronic current, entwined around a quartz column for heating the catalyst and synchronously providing the electrons onto the catalyst, and installed in the center of the reactor. The catalyst was uniformly embedded around the Ni–Cr wire. To investigate the features of the electrochemical catalytic reforming for bio-oil, the reforming were performed under different current, meanwhile other experimental conditions (i.e, T (temperature), S/C (the ratio of stream to carbon fed), and GHSV (liquid hourly space velocity)) were maintained at given constants. The products of the bio-oil's steam reforming reactions were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs (GC1 and GC2) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Ultra-high purity argon (99.999%) was used as carrier gas. The products of H2, CO and CH4 and other hydrocarbons were detected by GC1 (Molecular Sieve 5A). The CO2 formed was detected by GC2 (GDX-502). The composition of the effluent gases from the reactor was also confirmed by a Q-MS mass spectrometer (Mode: GSD 300 Omnistar). The reforming performance of the bio-oil was studied by measuring hydrogen yield, carbon conversion and dry gas composition under different reforming conditions. The hydrogen yield was calculated as a percentage of the stoichiometric potential, in case of complete conversion of carbon element in the bio-oil to CO2 according to the reaction (C n H m O k +(2n − k) H2O=(2n + m/2− k)H2 + nCO2) [48]. The potential yield of hydrogen is (2n + m/2− k)/n mole per mole of carbon in the feed. The carbon conversion was calculated by the total mol carbon in the gaseous products divided by the mol carbon in the fed bio-oil (i.e., the ratio of the mol carbon in the effluent gases to the carbon in the bio-oil fed) [48]. Generally, all experiments were repeated three times. In typical catalytic activity test for the fresh catalyst, the deviations both for the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion were generally lower than 10%. The bigger deviations for the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion (10–15%), sometimes, occurred for the tests of the catalyst stability. The deviations might mainly attribute to bit of fluctuation of the experimental parameters and small difference of the catalyst preparation."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterizations of catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of catalysts 3.1.1 Chemical and physical properties Table 3 shows the fundamental chemical and physical properties for the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts and the γAl2O3-supported Ni catalysts, including the Ni loading contents, BET surface area, pore volume, averaged Ni crystallite size and Ni dispersion. The BET surface areas for the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts range from 110.8 to 131.6m2/g. The averaged crystallite size of Ni supported on CNTs (estimated on the basis of TEM image) ranges from 6.1 to 19.4nm, which depends on the Ni loading content. As increasing the Ni content of the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts, both the BET surface areas and the Ni dispersion decreased, accompanied with the increase of the size of the Ni particles. Generally, the decrease of the Ni dispersion or the increase of the particle size will lead to the decrease of the catalyst activity. The above results indicate that, the changes of the catalyst properties induced by altering the Ni loading contents and/or supporters would cause significant influence on the production of hydrogen from the reforming of the bio-oil (Fig. 6). 3.1.2 XRD analysis The XRD analysis was carried out to investigate the diffraction structure of the Ni-based catalysts supported on different supporters prepared in different conditions. Fig. 2 (I) shows the XRD patterns from seven different samples, including (a) the purified CNTs, (b) 15% Ni-CNTs before reduction, (c) 5% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (d) 15% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (e) 35% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (f) the used 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst after bio-oil steam reforming at 500°C for 15h, respectively. And Fig. 2(II) presents the XRD patterns for the 15% Ni-γAl2O3 catalysts before reduction (Fig. 2(II: a)) and after the reduction treatment by 20vol% H2 at 600°C for 3h (Fig. 2(II: b)). For the purified CNT (Fig. 2(I-a)), two characteristic peaks at 2θ =26.18° and 43.18° were identified which were due to the diffractions of the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) planes of graphite-like tube-wall of the CNTs [40–42]. For the Ni-CNTs catalyst before reduction (Fig. 2(I-b)), three new peaks at 2θ =37.5°, 43.3°, and 62.9° were assigned to the NiO phases of NiO (2 2 2), (4 0 0) and (4 4 0) respectively. Besides the CNTs feature, the presence of metallic Ni in the reduced Ni-CNTs catalysts (Fig. 2(I: c–f)) is clearly revealed, characterized by the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) at 2θ =44.5°, 51.9°, and 76.4° respectively. The level of the catalyst reduction for the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts, described by the ratio of r =[Ni0]/([Ni0]+[Ni2+]), was about 95% (Table 4 ). This means that present CNTs-supported catalysts belong to one of the Ni-based catalysts after the reduction treatment. The mean particle sizes of Ni were estimated by analyzing the broadening of the strongest (1 1 1) diffraction peak. The mean particle sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation. As can be seen in Table 3, with increasing the Ni loading from 5% to 35%, the size of the Ni particles was found to increase significantly from 5.4nm to 15.0nm, indicating a larger sized aggregate in the case of the higher Ni loading. Moreover, it was noticed that the intensity of Ni diffraction peaks decreased after the stream reforming of the bio-oil. This may reflect that part of the Ni particles was covered by the coke formation on the catalyst surface, leading to the inactivation of the catalyst [60]. 3.1.3 TEM analysis Fig. 3 shows typical TEM images from (a) the purified CNTs, (b) 5% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (c) 15% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (d) 35% Ni-CNTs reduced by 20vol% H2 at 400°C for 3h, (e) 15% Ni-Al2O3 reduced by 20vol% H2 at 600°C for 3h. The particles of Ni (the black dots in the TEM photos) were well uniformly deposited on the 5% Ni-CNTs catalyst with lower loading content of 5wt% (Fig. 3b). The average Ni particle size estimated statistically from TEM is about 6.1nm, which approximately agrees with the value derived from the XRD results by the Scherrer equation (Table 3). Most of the Ni metal particles seem display outside the CNTs. With increasing the Ni-loading content from 5wt% to 15wt% (Fig. 3c), the average Ni particle size obviously increases from 6.1nm to 11.2nm. A serious particle accumulation (presented as the globoid) was observed for the Ni-loading content of 35wt% (35% Ni-CNTs, Fig. 3d) with the average particle size of 19.4nm. Thus, the Ni particle size and its distribution mainly depend on the supporter used and the Ni content. Smaller Ni particle size with a higher dispersion should be favor to the reforming performance of bio-oil. 3.1.4 XPS analysis The alterations of the Ni atomic states between 15% Ni-CNTs and 15% Ni-Al2O3 were investigated by the Ni XPS spectra. Fig. 4 shows typical Ni (2p) XPS spectra from two samples of 15% Ni-CNTs and 15% Ni-Al2O3. The binding energies and assignments were summarized in Table 4. As can be seen from the Ni XPS spectrum in Fig. 4(a), the bind energy at about 852.8eV and 856.3eV were observed for the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst, corresponding to the main lines of Ni0 (2p3/2) and Ni2+ (2p3/2), respectively. The Ni XPS peak at 861.4eV was assigned to the satellite band of Ni0 (2p3/2). The bind energies at about 872.1eV and 874.7eV correspond to the main lines of Ni0 (2p1/2) and Ni2+ (2p1/2) for the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Ni XPS spectra from 15% Ni-Al2O3 was similar to that from 15% Ni-CNTs. Moreover, the elements on the x% Ni-CNTs catalyst surface with different Ni content were also analyzed by the XPS measurements. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the Ni loading content and the ratio of [Ni]/[C], in which the elemental contents of Ni and C were estimated by the XPS peak areas and calibrated by the detection sensitivity. At lower Ni loading content (<10wt%), it was found that the ratio of [Ni]/[C] increased sharply with the Ni loading content. However, when the Ni loading content was over about 10wt%, the ratio of [Ni]/[C] smoothly rises with increasing the Ni loading. The above results may reflect that the Ni atoms uniformly distributed on the x% Ni-CNTs surface at lower Ni loading content. The Ni congregation and/or multi-layer distribution may occur at higher Ni loading content. The XPS results also agreed with other characterizations via TEM, XRD and the H2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. In addition, the amount of the carbon content on the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst before and after the reforming of the bio-oil for 15h (reforming conditions: T =500°C, S/C=6.1, GHSV=12 000h−1 and P =1atm) was carried out. The increase of the C content on catalyst surface was about 3.2at.% after reforming, indicating that the C deposition occurred in the process of the bio-oil's reforming and led to the catalyst's deactivation."
8,Features of steam reforming of bio-oil over the Ni-CNTs catalysts,"3.2 Features of steam reforming of bio-oil over the Ni-CNTs catalysts 3.2.1 Catalytic activities of Ni-based catalysts over different supporters The reforming performance of the bio-oil over various catalysts prepared, including CNTs, 5% Ni-CNTs; 15% Ni-CNTs; 35% Ni-CNTs and 15% Ni-γAl2O3, were tested as a function of reforming temperature (350–550°C) at a given molar steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C=6.1) and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV=12 000h−1) under about 1atm. Fig. 6a presents the conversion of carbon in the bio-oil fraction into all gaseous carbon-containing compounds (i.e., CO2, CO, CH4 etc.) versus temperature over the above catalysts. The purified CNTs without adding Ni present a very poor activity for the steam reforming of inorganic compounds in the bio-oil. With the addition of Ni, the conversion of carbon in the reforming of the bio-oil significantly improved, indicating that the Ni element is the most important active site. The conversion of carbon overall Ni-based catalysts increased with increasing the reforming temperature in our investigated range. In particular, the conversion of carbon over the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts was significantly higher as compared with the behavior of the 15% Ni-γAl2O3-supported Ni catalyst. This means that the supporter also plays an important role in the reforming of the bio-oil over the Ni-based catalysts. Fig. 6b shows the hydrogen yield versus temperature over the above catalysts. The 15% Ni-CNTs and 35% Ni-CNTs catalysts have higher H2 yield than the other tested ones. The H2 yield over the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst ranged from 43.6% to 92.5% in our investigated temperature range (350–550°C), which was about 2–8 times higher than the values over the γAl2O3-supported Ni catalyst (15% Ni-γAl2O3). To further investigate the effects of Ni-loading content on the reforming activity of the bio-oil, the yields of hydrogen and the carbon conversions were also measured at different Ni-loading contents in the x% Ni-CNTs (x =0–35 in wt%) catalysts. As the Ni concentration in the x% Ni-CNTs catalysts increase from 5wt% to 15wt%, the performance of the steam reforming of the bio-oil was significantly improved. Further increasing Ni content over 15% did not result in an obvious increase of the hydrogen yield (Fig. 6). Thus, much attention in this work was paid to study the production of hydrogen from the steam reforming of inorganic compounds in the bio-oil over the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst. When nickel particles were supported on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the catalytic activity for the steam reforming of bio-oil (described by the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion) was excellent. It has been revealed that CNTs have unique intrinsic properties such as high surface area, unique electronic properties and chemical inertness, thermal stability and high mechanical strength [37,38]. According to present characterization results, several factors would cause the good performance of Ni-CNTs catalyst. First, it was found that the active element of Ni and/or NiO exhibited more uniform and higher dispersion on the CNTs-supported Ni catalysts, as observed by the TEM images (Fig. 3) and the hydrogen chemisorption and temperature-programmed desorption (Table 3). Since the CNTs surface is in the highly crystalline form of graphite, there is the possibility for metal crystalline to undergo a strong interaction with the support and this might induce preferred crystallographic orientation of the particles [56], which may favor the catalytic reforming processes. Second, both the average particle size on the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst (about 11.2nm) was obviously smaller than the size on the 15% Ni-Al2O3 catalyst (about 24.5nm). The distribution of the particle size became narrower for the CNTs supporters (Fig. 3). Generally, the decrease of the crystallite size might lead to the increase of the catalyst activity. Third, the level of the catalyst reduction for the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst, described by the ratio of r =[Ni0]/([Ni0]+[Ni2+]), was higher than that of 15% Ni-Al2O3 catalyst. We have confirmed that both the NiO and Ni based catalysts had the catalytic activity for the steam reforming of the bio-oil. The reforming activity over the Ni-based catalyst is somewhat higher than that over the NiO-based catalyst [53]. Moreover, it has reported that a large area of π-electron cloud owing to the graphite structure favors electron transfer between the support and the particles [55–57], which may result in an electronic perturbation of the metal and promote the catalytic activity of nickel particles. Taking it all round, the significant promoting effects of the CNTs supporter on the production of hydrogen from the bio-oil observed may mainly attribute to the alteration of the catalyst properties. 3.2.2 Effects of temperature and S/C ratio on the steam reforming of the bio-oil In this work, the influences of the most important parameters, the reforming temperature (T) and the molar ratio of steam to carbon fed (S/C), on the reforming process of the bio-oil over the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst were investigated using the stream as the carrier gas in the reforming reactor. The steam used as a carrier gas has several advantages including (1) it serves as a required reactant in the reforming process of the bio-oil, (2) it can decrease the formation of coke and tar in the bio-oil reforming process, and (3) it can simplify the purification procedure of the reforming products in comparison with inner gases such as N2 as carrier gas. On the other hand, the content of water contained in the crude bio-oil was about 21.0wt%. After the pretreatment by vaporizing the crude bio-oil from 60°C to 180°C, the amount of the water contained in the treated bio-oil increased to about 39.3wt% (Table 2). When we calculated the molar ratio of steam to carbon fed (S/C), both the content of water in the pretreated bio-oil and that of the steam supplied as carrier gas were taken into account. Table 5 shows the influences of the reforming temperature and S/C ratio on the hydrogen yield, the carbon conversion and the distribution of the reforming products. The reforming performance of the bio-oil was significantly enhanced by the reforming temperature in the catalytic bed. At T =400°C, S/C=6.1, and GHSV=12 000h−1, the yield of hydrogen over the 15% Ni-CNTs catalyst was about 55.0%. With increasing temperature from 400 to 550°C, the hydrogen yield remarkably increased, giving a maximum value of about 92.5% within our investigated region. The carbon conversion was about 63.2% at 400°C and reached about 94.9% at 550°C with S/C=6.1 and GHSV=12 000h−1. On the other hand, both the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion were obviously affected by the S/C (mol ratio of steam to carbon in bio-oil fed) ratio (Table 5). The intent of the bio-oil steam reforming process is to make as much hydrogen and carbon dioxide as possible by the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil in the presence of steam over a catalyst. It has been revealed that the reaction pathways occurred in the bio-oil steam reforming process is very complex (e.g., the reforming reactions between various inorganic compounds and water, secondary cracking of the inorganic compounds, reforming reactions of the fragments as well as the water–gas shift reaction etc.) [8] and a lot of potential products may form, depending on the catalysts and reforming conditions used. The reforming reaction (Eq. (1)) is generally endothermic and is favored by high temperature, leading to a higher carbon conversion and higher H2 yield at higher temperature. In contrast, the water–gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)) is exothermic and favors lower temperature. The increase of stream amount is in favor of both the reforming reaction and the water–gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase of the hydrogen yield at higher S/C. Moreover, present results show that H2 and CO2 are the major products in the bio-oil's steam reforming over 15% Ni-CNT together with some amount of CO and CH4 in the effluent gaseous compounds. As shown in Table 5, the dry gas composition also varies with the reforming temperature and the S/C ratio. Typical composition of the resulting gas at T =550°C, S/C=6.1 GHSV=12 000h−1 contained 68.1vol% H2, 1.6vol% CO, 29.4vol% CO2, 0.9vol% CH4. In order to more clearly reveal the feature of the composition distribution from the steam reforming of the bio-oil, the volume ratios of H2/CO and CO2/CO were depicted as a function of the reaction temperature at S/C=2.0–6.1 and GHSV=12 000h−1 (Fig. 7 ). The ratio of H2/CO, ranging from 1.6 to 44.5, increases with increasing temperature and the S/C ratio. The CO2/CO ratio was about 19 at T =550°C, S/C=6.1 and GHSV=12 000h−1, indicating that the products derived from the steam reforming of the bio-oil are the H2/CO2-rich mixture gas. With increasing the S/C ratio from 2.0 to 6.1 at 500°C, the ratio of H2/CO increases from about 11.5 to 44.5, and the ratio of CO2/CO increases from about 5.5 to 19.8. The above results indicate that a higher S/C ratio favors shifting in the water–gas shift equilibrium to form CO2 [58,59]. 3.2.3 Effects of current on the steam reforming of the bio-oil Besides the reforming temperature and the S/C ratio, it was also observed that the behavior of the bio-oil reforming was very sensitive to the current (I) passing through the catalyst, which was described as the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) [52–54]. Fig. 8 presents the influence of current on the carbon conversion and the hydrogen over the 15% Ni-CNT catalyst at the fixed conditions of T =400°C, S/C=6.1, GHSV=12 000h−1 and P =1atm. Both the carbon conversion and the hydrogen yield were significantly enhanced by the current through the catalyst. With increasing the current from 0A to 4.0A, the yield of hydrogen increased from 55.0% to 87.5% and the carbon conversion rise from 63.2% to 90.6%. In addition, it was found that the content of H2 and CO2 in the reforming products increased with increasing the current, accompanied by the decrease of the CO and CH4 content (Fig. 9 ). For example, the concentration of hydrogen increased from 49.1vol% to 67.2vol% with increasing the current from 0A to 4.0A at 400°C, while the content of methane decreased from 3.5vol% to 1.2vol%. The products' selectivity in the reforming processes of bio-oil was mainly determined by the steam reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil and their cracking fragments, the dissociation of the compounds as well as the water-shift reaction. The decrease of the CH4 content in the products at high current may reflect the thermal electrons from the Ni–Cr wire promoted the steam reforming and dissociation of hydrocarbons. It was noticed that the ECR mode (i.e., the electrochemical catalytic reforming via inner heating) and the CSR mode (i.e., the common steam reforming via the outside heating) have different temperature distribution in the catalyst bed [53,54]. The maximal temperature gradients in ECR were higher than those in CSR. Even though temperature in the center of the catalyst bed is almost close to the average value in the catalyst bed in our investigated range (350–550°C), the local temperature on the surface of the electrified Ni–Cr wire or near the wire, generally, was obviously higher than the averaged temperature. Accordingly, the activity of the catalyst reforming near the electrified Ni–Cr wire should be significantly higher than other position in the bed, partly, leading to the enhancement of the apparent overlap reforming effect. On the other hand, the enhancement of the decomposition and reforming in the ECR process may be partly caused by the thermal electrons. The presence of the thermal electrons both on the electrified Ni–Cr wire and on the electrified catalyst surface was observed by the anionic TOF measurements [52–54]. It is well known that when an electrified metal or a metal oxide is heated, electrons can boil off its surface, leading to thermal emission of electrons from surface (i.e., thermal electron emission) [30]. It has been reported that thermal electrons on a metal or a metal oxide surface play an important role in the reduction process (e.g., O2 +4e− →2O2−) [35], the dissociation and reforming of ethanol or acetic acid [54]. Thus, the thermal electrons may partly contribute to the decomposition and reforming of the bio-oil, leading to the increase of the hydrogen yield in the ECR process. Moreover, it was also found that the energy efficiency in the ECR reforming process was higher than that in the CSR process, which may be explained by the multiple roles including local temperature effect, the effect of thermal electrons, and less heat loss in the inner heating mode. Further work is still required to clearly understand the reforming mechanism in the ECR process. 3.2.4 Stability of the Ni-CNTs catalyst The stability of the Ni-CNTs catalyst during the steam reforming of the bio-oil was tested by measuring the carbon conversion and the yield of hydrogen as a function of the time on stream. As shown in Fig. 10 , both the carbon conversion and the hydrogen yield over the 15% Ni-CNT catalyst almost remained at a constant for the initial 6–8h under typical reforming conditions of T =500°C, S/C=6.1, GHSV=12 000h−1 and P =1atm. On the other hand, no obvious changes of the products' compositions were observed. Slow decrease of the hydrogen yield was observed for the longer term observation, indicating a gradual deactivation of the catalyst during the bio-oil's reforming. The hydrogen yield gradually dropped to 50% of initial value for about 14–15h reforming. The catalyst's deactivation, occurring in the process of the bio-oil's reforming, may mainly caused by the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) on the catalyst and sintering of catalyst [28]."
9,Conclusion,"The CNT-promoting Ni catalyst (15wt% Ni-CNTs) was prepared by the homogeneous deposition–precipitation method and successfully applied for the low-temperature reforming of the organic compounds in bio-oil. Besides the reforming temperature and the S/C ratio, it was also observed that the behavior of the bio-oil reforming was very sensitive to the current passing through the catalyst. With increasing the current from 0 to 4.0A, the yield of hydrogen increased from 55.0% to 87.5% and the carbon conversion rise from 63.2% to 90.6% at T =400°C, S/C=6.1, GHSV=12 000h−1 and P =1atm. The good performance in low-temperature reforming of the oxygenated organic compounds in bio-oil may mainly attribute to higher Ni dispersion with a uniform distribution over the CNTs-supported Ni catalyst together with the effect of thermal electrons. Potentially, it may be a useful candidate to produce hydrogen from bio-oil."
