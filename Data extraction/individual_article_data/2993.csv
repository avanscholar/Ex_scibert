0,Introduction,"The constant need to improve food quality and safety, and the concomitant concerns about excessive plastic waste production has attracted interest in the development of environmentally friendly packaging that has a low environmental impact throughout its life cycle (Dehghani et al., 2018; Ganesan et al., 2018). Bio-based packaging materials have undergone growth and have generated an increasing interest in development of new materials as alternative solutions to environmental problems caused by the accumulation of nondegradable synthetic materials. Effort has been made to design bio-based packaging based on natural polymers instead of synthetic plastic materials (Bonilla & Sobral, 2016; Hassan et al., 2018; Klangmuang & Sothornvit, 2018). Natural polymer-based edible coatings may enhance food quality and prolong shelf-life of food products by acting as semi-permeable membranes, thus reducing the rate of respiration and water loss from fresh food (Gokkurt et al., 2012). Edible coatings are defined as a thin layer of material used for wrapping foods that may safely consumed (Dehghani et al., 2018). These edible coatings can also reduce the rate of physiological postharvest degradation (Khalifa et al., 2016; Murmu & Mishra, 2018; Saberi et al., 2018). Among the biodegradable polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cashew gum polysaccharide (CGP) have advantages over other materials (Ma et al., 2017; Maria et al., 2008; Moreira et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2012, 2016; Tripathi et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2018). CGP is a non-allergic, biocompatible, and biodegradable polymer found in the gummy exudate obtained from the bark of the cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale), that is composed of branched heteropolysaccharides (Nayak et al., 2019; Paula & Rodrigues, 1995). Cashew gum extraction is ecofriendly, using a process similar to rubber latex extraction (Nayak et al., 2019). The extracted gum is purified in an ecofriendly process to obtain the polysaccharide fraction, using water solubilization and alcoholic precipitation. Therefore, CGP is considered a sustainable alternative for use as a thickening and gelling compound, colloidal stabilizer, surfactant and coating agent (Mothé et al., 2017; Pitombeira et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016). However, pure CGP films have poor mechanical properties and low stability, which limits the use of this polymer as the only material in film formulations. Blends of CGP with other biopolymers have been studied as replacements for non-sustainable synthetic materials (Cruz et al., 2019; Oliveira et al., 2018; Rodrigues et al., 2014). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an edible, non-toxic, film-forming and easily prepared environment-friendly polymer that shows good chemical resistance and mechanical properties (Sanders, 1960; Silva et al., 2013; Zanela et al., 2018). This polymer is approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use. It can be used as a component of coatings and packaging in food applications (Curley et al., 2014; Gómez-Aldapa et al., 2020). Incorporation of PVA into CGP-based films has been shown to improve mechanical, morphological and physicochemical performance of the resultant materials (Cruz et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2012, 2013). A biodegradable CGP/PVA food packaging was produced by blending CGP and PVA that had been oxidized with sodium metaperiodate (Silva et al., 2012). Despite their biocompatibility and biodegradability, these CGP/PVA films using metaperiodate as an oxidizing agent are not appropriate nor approved for edible coatings since the residual iodine can affect human metabolism, leading to thyroid-related autoimmune diseases (Knobel & Medeiros-Neto, 2004). Therefore, the present study developed an edible CGP/PVA-based coating using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant agent. Hydrogen peroxide is an unstable oxidizing agent found in biological systems, including the human body, that slowly decomposes into non-toxic compounds. It is a food additive that is considered safe by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 2005) and is used as an antimicrobial, preservative and sterilizing agent. Therefore, CGP/PVA edible coatings were characterized with respect to their viscosity, optical, mechanical and barrier-forming properties. This study also evaluated the efficiency of CGP/PVA edible coatings to act as an active covering to retard or prevent fungal growth in strawberries during storage."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ethanol (95%) was purchased from Dinâmica Química Contemporânea Ltda (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Hydrogen peroxide, phosphoric acid, sodium chloride (99% purity), calcium chloride (99% purity), calcium nitrate (99% purity), potassium carbonate (99% purity), urea (99% purity), potassium phosphate (99% purity), ammonium sulfate (95% purity), magnesium sulfate (99% purity), and trace elements solution (Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+) were purchased from Labsynth (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Mannitol (98% purity), potassium tetraborate (99% purity), sodium acetate buffer solution (50 mmol L−1, pH 5.2), glucose (99% purity) and potassium bromide (FTIR grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Peptone was purchased from Kasvi (São José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil).)."
3,Extraction of cashew gum polysaccharide (CGP),"2.2 Extraction of cashew gum polysaccharide (CGP) Crude samples of exudate were manually collected from native Anacardium occidentale trees between June and September 2018 in Aquiráz, Ceará, Brazil. The exudates were stored and transported within 12 h in polystyrene cooler boxes at 20 °C. The cashew gum was milled in a Tecnal mill-grinder (model TE-631/4, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil), immersed in distilled water (20% w/v), and stirred at 25 °C until the gum was solubilized. The solution was filtered using a nylon membrane (WHA7402002, Sigma-Aldrich) and precipitated with cold 95% ethanol with a ratio of 1:3 (v/v). The precipitated CGP was separated by centrifugation at 4000 x g, 4 °C, for 10 min (Centrifuge model 5804R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and washed twice with ethanol to remove the remaining impurities. The purified CGP was lyophilized (Liotop model L101, Liobrás, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) and milled using the mill-grinder, and the resulting powder was stored at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) in airtight vials for a maximum of 6 months."
4,Preparation of edible coatings,"2.3 Preparation of edible coatings Edible hydrogels were prepared by mixing 3 g of PVA (product number 363138, Sigma Aldrich) and 1 g of CGP with 100 mL of distilled water at 60 °C with stirring. After solubilization, the mixture was cooled to 25 °C and 5 mL of 0.1 M H2O2 was added as an oxidizing agent, 10 mL of 1 M H3PO4 as a catalyst and 0.1 g of mannitol (98% purity, Sigma Aldrich) as a plasticizer were added and left at 25 °C to slowly react for 4 days while the solvent was completed evaporated. The resulting matrix was resolubilized in 50 mL of distilled water and homogenized (3000 rpm, 10 min) using an UltraTurrax® (model T25, Ika®-Werke GmbH & Co., KG, Staufen, Germany) to obtain a CGP/PVA solution to produce the edible coatings. To ensure the complete removal of the H2O2, the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h, with stirring. The presence of H2O2 in the film-forming solution was determined using the method of Noble and Gibson (1970). Samples of 100 μL of film-forming solution were added to 1 mL of distilled water and the absorbance was determined at 240 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (BEL SPECTRO model S-2000, BEL Engineering, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil). The amount of H2O2 in the solution was calculated comparing the absorbance of the sample with a calibration curve of H2O2 in distilled water (r2 = 0.995)."
5,Characterization of the CGP/PVA edible coating,"2.4 Characterization of the CGP/PVA edible coating 2.4.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectra were carried out on a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Vertex 70, Bruker Co., Billerica, MA, USA) to characterize the presence of specific chemical groups in the materials. Polymers (10 mg) and CGP/PVA solutions (50 μL) were mixed thoroughly with potassium bromide (100 mg) and compressed into pellets by applying pressure of 200 kg cm−2 in a hydraulic press (model 15T, Specac Inc., London, UK). FTIR was done in attenuated total reflection mode between 400 and 4000 cm−1 with 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and scan speed of 0.2 cm s−1. 2.4.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM was done at the Laboratório Multiusuário de Microscopia de Alta Resolução at the Universidade Federal de Goiás (Goiânia, GO, Brazil). For microstructural analysis, 5 mL of CGP/PVA solution was left to dry at room temperature to obtain the edible coating which was cut with a scalpel into strips of ~1 cm2 and fixed onto copper stubs. The samples were gold-coated (Coating system model DESK V, Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ, USA), and observed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV (JEOL JSM-6610, Jeol Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England). Uncoated fruits (control) and fruit coated with edible CPV/PVA coatings were cut with a scalpel in slices of 4 cm2 and analyzed after 1 and 5 days of storage in a biosafety cabinet at 25 °C and 30% relative humidity (RH), using the same conditions described above. 2.4.3 Viscosity analysis Viscosity was measured as described by Saberi, Vuong, et al. (2016), using oscillatory measurements in an analogue rotational viscometer (model EEQ-9031, range 1–20,000 cP, EDUTEC, Curitiba, PR, Brazil). The viscosity was determined at 60 rpm and room temperature using the nº 2 spindle. Viscosity was measured in triplicate and the results were expressed in mPa.s. 2.4.4 Light transmission of the CGP/PVA edible coating Light transmission was measured according to the procedure reported by Cao et al. (2018), with minor modifications. The light transmittance of CGP/PVA edible coating was assessed using an ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer in the range of 200 to 800 nm, with 6 scans at a resolution of 10 nm and a scan speed of 250 nm min−1. The samples were fixed to a cuvette with a 1 cm slit width. Samples were cut with a scalpel into strips 4x2 cm and tested in triplicate. The thickness of the CGP/PVA edible films were determined using a digital micrometer (model MDC-SX/25 mm, Mitutoyo Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with minimal resolution of 0.001 mm and each strip was measure 10 times in different places. It was used with samples showing two different values of thickness, 32 and 88 μm (±1 μm). 2.4.5 Water vapor permeability (WVP) and CO2 permeability The WVP of the CGP/PVA edible coating was measured using the gravimetric method described by Pérez-Gago and Krochta (2001). CGP/PVA edible coating were cut with a scalpel into discs with ~1.5 cm radius (area ≈6.6 cm2) and 80 ± 2 μm thickness were sealed using an open metal cap on the mouth of weighing bottles containing 25 g of anhydrous CaCl2. These weighing bottles were conditioned in a desiccator with saturated NaCl solution to achieve 75% RH. Weight changes were measured for 6 days at 12 h intervals. The slopes of the weight gain (Δm) versus time (Δt) were obtained. Using these values, the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and WVP were calculated using the following equations: (1) W V T R = △ m ( △ t • A ) (2) W V P ( g • s − 1 • m − 1 • P a − 1 ) = W V T R • X △ p where A (m2) indicates the exposed sample area (0.00066 m2), X (m) indicates the average thickness of the CGP/PVA edible coating (0.00008 m) and Δp (Pa) indicates the difference in water vapor pressure between the two sides of the sample (1753.55 Pa). For the evaluation of CO2 permeability, films with thickness of 281 ± 2 μm were cut with a scalpel into discs of ~38 cm2. Prior to the determination, samples were conditioned at 25 °C for 48 h in a desiccator with saturated K2CO3 solution to achieve 50% RH. The CO2 (99% purity, White Martins Gases Industriais Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) permeability was measured with the Perme Vac-V1 gas permeability measuring device (model PermeVac-V1, Medford, MA, USA), running with a time interval of 10 s and a vacuum for 3 h. Testing was based on the differential pressure method to determine the gas transmission rate of films using the ASTM D1434-82 standard (ASTM, 2009). Each sample was measured in triplicate. 2.4.6 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of the CGP/PVA edible coatings (thickness of 200 ± 0.3 μm), including tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB), were determined in a texture analyzer (model TA1, Lloyd Instruments/Ametek, Largo, FL, USA) with a 50 N load cell equipped with tensile grips (model A/TG). Prior to the determination, samples were cut with a scalpel into rectangular slices of 15x90 mm and conditioned at 25 °C for 24 h in a desiccator containing a saturated K2CO3 solution to achieve 50% RH, in accordance with ASTM D882-02 (2002). Tests were done using 10 replicates and the initial grip separation and cross-head speed were set at 50 mm and 300 mm min−1, respectively. TS and percentage of EB were evaluated. Each sample used was previously inspected and those containing any defect such as air bubbles, holes, and tears were rejected."
6,Bioactivation of CGP/PVA edible TCWDE from Trichoderma asperellum T00,"2.5 Bioactivation of CGP/PVA edible TCWDE from Trichoderma asperellum T00 The production of TCWDE was done as described by Fernandes et al. (2013). Briefly, T. asperellum (obtained from the Laboratory of Enzymology's culture collection at the Federal University of Goias) was inoculated in Trichoderma liquid enzyme production medium (0.1% of peptone; 0.03% of urea; 0.2% of KH2PO4; 0.14% of (NH4)2SO4; 0.03% of MgSO4; 0.03% of CaCl2; 1 mL of 0.01% trace elements solution), enriched with 0.02% (w/v) glucose and 0.5% (w/v) chitin from shrimp shells (C7170, Sigma-Aldrich). The culture was incubated at 28 °C for 6 days and harvested by filtration using Whatman filter paper (WHA1001325, Sigma Aldrich). The filtrate containing the TCWDE was dialyzed (cellulose membranes with nominal molecular weight cut-off 14 kDa, D9277, Sigma Aldrich) against water and lyophilized. The activity of the enzymes produced by T. asperellum was evaluated according to methodology described by Silva et al. (2011). The chitinase activity was determined using colloidal chitin as the substrate. An aliquot of 500 μL of TCWDE solution (20 mg mL−1) was mixed with 500 μL of colloidal chitin and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture (250 μL) was added to 50 μL of 0.3 mol L−1 K2B4O7 and incubated for 3 min at 100 °C. Then, 1.5 mL of 0.1% (w/v) 4-(dimethylamino) benzaldehyde solution (DMAB, D2004, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 587 nm and one unit of enzyme (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to produce 1 μmol of reducing sugar in 1 h at 37 °C. N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was done by monitoring the rate of formation of p-nitrophenol from 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (pNglcNAc, N9376, Sigma Aldrich). An aliquot of 50 μL of TCWDE solution (20 mg mL−1) was mixed with 100 μL of 5 mmol L−1 pNglcNAc solution and 350 μL of sodium acetate buffer (50 mmol L−1, pH 5.2). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Sodium carbonate solution (1 mL of 0.5 mol L−1) was added and the content of p-nitrophenol released was measured at 450 nm. One unit of enzyme (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol in 1 min at 37 °C. The activity of β-1,3-glucanase was evaluated using laminarin (L9634, Sigma Aldrich) as the substrate. Samples of 50 μL of TCWDE solution (20 mg mL−1) were mixed with 100 μL of 0.25% (w/v) laminarin solution in acetate buffer (50 mmol L−1, pH 5.2). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 40 °C and the amount of reducing sugars formed was determined at 550 nm (Miller, 1959). One unit of enzyme (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of reducing sugar in 1 min at 40 °C. CGP/PVA edible coatings were bioactivated by mixing 10 mg of TCWDE with 1 mL of CGP/PVA solution. The system was stirred for 10 min at 25 °C and then used as a coating for fresh strawberries (Fragaria ananassa). The activity of the CGP/PVA/TCWDE edible coatings were evaluated using the method of Silva et al. (2011), using 50 μL of CGP/PVA/TCWDE solution. The CGP/PVA/TCWDE film-forming solution had the following enzyme activities: (1) 0.6 U mL−1 for chitinase, (2) 144 U mL−1 for N-acetylglucosaminidase and (3) 6 U mL−1 for β-1,3-glucanase."
7,Biological tests,"2.6 Biological tests To determine the efficiency of CGP/PVA and CGP/PVA/TCWDE edible coatings with respect to retarding or inhibiting fungal growth, tests were done using these materials as edible coatings for fresh strawberries. Strawberries (average weight: 14 ± 0.5 g) were purchased in a local market and immediately used in the biological tests. Prior to the beginning of the experiments, damaged, nonuniform, unripe, or overripe fruits were discarded. 2.6.1 Coating and storage conditions of the strawberries The coating of strawberries (including the sepal and pedicel) was done as described by Chlebowska-Smigiel et al. (2008). The fruits were washed with running water and rinsed with distilled water, drained and air dried on a stainless-steel screen for 30 min prior to applying the coating. To evaluate the antifungal effect of the CGP/PVA edible coating, the CGP/PVA or CGP/PVA/TCWDE edible hydrogels were spread over the entire strawberries surface using a sterile brush. The covered fruits were allowed to dry in a biosafety cabinet for 2 h (25 °C, 36% RH) to ensure polymerization of the edible coating. A solution of Penicillium sp. (obtained from the Laboratory of Enzymology's culture collection at the Federal University of Goias) was prepared in saline buffer and the numbers of spores were determined using a Neubauer chamber (Hecht Assistent®, Glaswarenfabrik Karl Hecht GmbH & Co. KG, Sondheim vor der Rhön, Germany). For the tests, an aliquot of 200 μL of Penicillium spore solution (107 spores mL−1) was spread over the surface of each strawberry (excluding the sepal and pedicel structures) using a brush and allowed to dry in the biosafety cabinet for 1 h. The fruits were stored in the biosafety cabinet (25 °C, 36% RH) for 5 days. A total of 15 strawberries were inoculated/experiment. For the biological tests, strawberries were organized in three groups: Group A: CGP/PVA coated group Group B: CGP/PVA/TCWDE coated group Group C: control (uncoated strawberries) 2.6.2 Structural appearance and weight loss A macroscopic evaluation was carried out to determine the fruit appearance and fungal incidence during 5 days of storage. All groups were stored at room temperature and the images were captured with a fixed (10 cm of distance from subject) photographic camera (model GU46 6 GG, Samsung, London, UK), using indoor natural lighting conditions. In addition, after 5 day of storage samples from coated and uncoated strawberries were analyzed using SEM as described in section 2.3.2. The weight loss was measured as described by Duan et al. (2011). The percentage of weight loss (WL) was calculated as coated weight (FW) of the fruit at each sampling time divided by the initial coated weight (IW) of the fruit (after coating and drying), using the following equation: (3) W L ( % ) = F W I W • 100"
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis All measurements were done at least in triplicate. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X ± SD). Variance analysis (one-way ANOVA) and Tukey's test were used to define differences in mean values. The variance analyses were carried out using Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The means of treatments with the same letters were not significantly different (p ≤ 0.05)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,FTIR spectroscopy,"3.1 FTIR spectroscopy The CGP/PVA edible coating was visually analyzed and no fractures or ruptures were observed after drying. The film was visually homogeneous and did not show opaque or different colored zones or the presence of insoluble particles (Fig. 1 a). SEM images showed that the surface of the CGP/PVA edible coating had a homogeneous and regular structure, without aggregates or the presence of pores (Fig. 1b). The FTIR spectra of the CGP, PVA and the CGP/PVA edible coating are shown in Fig. 2 . The FTIR spectrum of CGP showed the major peaks associated with this polysaccharide. There is a strong broad band around 3435 cm−1 assigned to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups and a band at 2934 cm−1 assigned to the C–H broad alkyl stretching band (Fig. 2a). The band interval between 1100-700 is commonly referred as “fingerprint region” related to the polysaccharide structure. The peaks at ~1080 and 710 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibrations of –C–O–C from glycosidic bonds and stretching vibrations of –OH bending resulting from the pyranosidic structures of CGP (Pavia et al., 2010; Pitombeira et al., 2015). A peak around 1640 cm−1 is associated with the asymmetric deformation of the –OH water groups (Lima et al., 2018). FTIR spectrum of pure PVA (Fig. 2b) showed a C–H broad alkyl stretching band around 2900-3000 cm−1 and typical strong hydroxyl bands for free alcohol (nonbonded –OH stretching band at 3600-3650 cm−1), and a hydrogen bonded band (around 3200-3570 cm−1) (Hassan & Peppas, 2000; Peppas, 1977; Reis et al., 2006). An important absorption peak was found at a frequency of 1096 cm−1. This vibrational band is mostly attributed to the crystallinity of the PVA related to a carboxyl stretching band (C–O, around 1090-1150 cm−1) (Coates, 2000; Mansur et al., 2002). This absorption band has been used as an assessment tool for the PVA structure because it is a semi-crystalline synthetic polymer capable of forming some domains depending on several process parameters. In addition, the vibrational frequency at 1736 cm−1 of pure PVA was assigned to the CO stretching of the acetate groups in the PVA structure (Malathi et al., 2010). The spectrum shown in Fig. 2c confirmed the formation of CGP/PVA blends. The disappearance of the hydroxyl groups (1600-1650 cm−1) and the presence of bands of the acetal ring (C–O–C) and the ether (C–O) linkages (1000-1130 cm−1) were probably due to the covalent bond formed between oxidized PVA and CGP (Pavia et al., 2010; Vlachos et al., 2006)."
11,Viscosity behavior,"3.2 Viscosity behavior The viscosity behavior of coating-forming solutions is an important factor that can affect the spread-stability, thickness, and uniformity of the liquid coating layer, in addition to directly interfering with mechanical properties, processing design, and applications (Ma et al., 2017). The CGP/PVA edible hydrogel had a viscosity of 111 ± 1 mPa s. This value was consistent with those reported for films based on gummy polysaccharides (Simas-Tosin et al., 2010). Nevertheless, there is a range of viscosity values for edible coatings, which are dependent on the nature and structure of the polysaccharides used in the hydrogel formulations. Intermolecular interactions will occur with a high frequency in linear polysaccharides, which will allow water molecules to move freely in the solution, thus decreasing the apparent viscosity. On the other hand, interactions with water molecules will predominate with branched polysaccharides and cause a reduction in the amount of free water in the solution, which increases the apparent viscosity. The hydrophilicity of the sugar components will also influence the viscosity of the resultant hydrogel. Despite the different viscosity behaviors of polysaccharide-based edible coatings, several researchers have shown that when the viscosity of the coating-forming solution is too high, there will be discontinuities in the final films (Cao et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2017; Saberi, Vuong, et al., 2016). Sothornvit and Krochta (2005) reported that plasticizers can restrict interactions of the polymer chain, creating a less organized film structure, which may decrease the viscosity and also interfere with the film structure. Mannitol (0.1% w/v) was used as a plasticizer agent. As the amount of plasticizer added to the formulation was low, no interference in the structure of the CGP/PVA edible coating was observed, indicating that polysaccharide branching and the interactions between the polymer chains are flexible enough to maintain a stable network."
12,Light transmission,"3.3 Light transmission The transparency of edible coatings is an important property for determining the applications of a material, mainly when it will be applied as a coating for food surfaces or for amending the appearance of the final product (Maran et al., 2013). In general, it is desirable that film packaging and edible coatings show high transparency and lightness. The regular light transmission spectra of the CGP/PVA edible coatings with two different thicknesses (32 and 88 μm) are shown in Fig. 3 . The film thickness affected the light transmission statistically significantly in the ultraviolet range (200–400 nm), with a reduction of about 25% in light transmission for the thicker film (88 μm). However, in the visible spectrum (400–700 nm) no statistically significant differences in light transmission were observed in the CGP/PVA edible coatings despite the 2.8 fold increase in the thickness. It is possible that the structural network of the CGP/PVA edible coating is regularly organized, which allows light transmission independent of the thickness of the material. The CGP/PVA edible coatings were transparent with a transmittance of 88% in the visible range and showed excellent optical characteristics as can be seen in Fig. 1a in which the writing covered by the CGP/PVA edible coating (88 μm) is visible. The light transmission profile was consistent with those reported for polysaccharide-based films and coatings. Silva et al. (2016) reported light transmission values around 70% for CGP/PVA films with thicknesses between 140 and 200 μm. Ortega-Toro et al. (2017) found light transmission values between 69 and 84% for antifungal starch-based edible films containing Aloe vera. Saberi, Vuong, et al. (2016) evaluated biodegradable edible films based on pea starch and guar gum and obtained transmission values of 78 to 90%. This profile of light transmission for the CGP/PVA edible coating allows a multitude of biotechnological applications for this material, since this coating does not compromise the visualization of the product, an important parameter for successful commercialization."
13,WVP and CO2 permeability,"3.4 WVP and CO2 permeability The WVP of coating materials is one of the most important properties of edible coating and films for food packaging applications, mainly because of the importance of the water in deteriorative reactions that directly influence the shelf-life of food products (Cerqueira et al., 2009; Spotti et al., 2016). Therefore, the lower the WVP value the better the barrier property (Du et al., 2016). The CGP/PVA edible coating showed a WVP of 7 x 10−11 g m−1s−1Pa−1 which was lower than those values shown for other polysaccharide-based films. Zhang et al. (2016) reported WVP values of 17 x 10−11 g m−1s−1Pa−1 for edible films based on gum ghatti. In another study, corn starch-based films containing glycerol had a WVP value of 8.7 x 10−11 g m−1s−1Pa−1 (Garcia et al., 2006). Bravin et al. (2006) reported values of 20.5 x 10−11 g m−1s−1Pa−1 for WVP of starch and methylcellulose films. These differences in the WVP values might result from the diversity in chemical composition of coating solutions or crystallinity of the films. Polysaccharide edible coatings have a hydrophilic nature, which provides good barriers to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and lipids (Biliaderis et al., 1999; Cerqueira et al., 2009). Carbon dioxide is important for living tissue respiration and a higher value of CO2 permeability can delay fruit softening. Therefore, a low rate of CO2 permeability in edible coatings is desirable. Edible CGP/PVA coatings showed a CO2 permeability of 363 cm3 m−2 day−1 at 0.1 Mpa−1, a value lower than those reported by Carvalho et al. (2017) for cellulose acetate films (5600 cm3 m−2 day−1 at 0.1 Mpa−1). These results confirmed the network cohesion of CGP/PVA edible coating, which can act to modify the internal atmosphere in the fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and cause retardation of the biochemical reactions linked to deterioration (Tzoumaki et al., 2009)."
14,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of CGP/PVA edible coatings were assessed by measuring their tensile strength and elongation upon breaking. Tensile strength (TS) represents the maximum tensile stress before breaking. Elongation upon breaking (EB) is a measure of film stretching capacity. The CGP/PVA edible coating showed values of 0.04 MPa for TS and 147% for EB. After comparing the mechanical properties of the CGP/PVA edible coating with other films, it was observed that the resulting TS value was lower than those obtained for other polysaccharides while the EB values were significantly higher (Cazón et al., 2017; Cerqueira et al., 2009; Chiumarelli & Hubinger, 2012; Davidovic et al., 2018; Souza et al., 2012; Spotti et al., 2016). According to Seyedi et al. (2014), coatings and films with low TS and high EB tend to be less fragile, especially when plasticizers are used in the formulations. In the case of CGP/PVA edible coatings, the mechanical results can be related to the mannitol penetration into the polymer matrix and reduction of inter-chain interactions which led to a high flexibility, showing that it underwent fracture with a slow and sustained pace. The three-dimensional organization of PVA and CGP also provided high flexibility characteristics to the final edible coating."
15,Biological tests,"3.6 Biological tests Edible coatings are intended to extend the shelf-life by acting as semi-permeable barriers, reducing moisture and solutes losses, gas exchange, respiration and oxidative reaction rates, as well as suppressing physiological disorders on fresh-cut fruits (Gol et al., 2013; Hassan et al., 2018). It was also reported that edible coatings may act as carriers for food additives such as antimicrobial agents, on food surfaces, to confer bioactivity against microorganisms (Davidovic et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2007). Therefore, aiming to determine the efficiency of CGP/PVA edible coating in extending the shelf-life of fresh strawberries, storage tests were done using uncoated (control) and coated fruits (groups A and B). In the macroscopic evaluation, it was observed that the strawberries coated with CGP/PVA edible coatings (groups A and B) showed a delay in the deterioration process compared to those uncoated (control). The coated fruits were visually brighter and more reddish compared to the controls, while the uncoated strawberries showed a visible weight loss, becoming withered and smaller (Fig. 4 ). According to Saberi, Thakur, et al. (2016) edible films provide reinforcement of natural layers to prevent weight losses, allowing a controlled interchange of important gases involved in the respiration of plant tissues, such as carbon dioxide, ethylene and oxygen. Weight loss is an important indicator of fruit freshness loss. The assessment of weight loss showed that the behavior of the control group strawberries was significantly different from the coated ones (p < 0.05). Group C showed a weight loss of 59% (±0.3), indicating that the uncoated strawberries lost 31% more weight than group A. In addition, the presence of immobilized enzymes did not interfere with the weight loss of the coated fruits with a 41% (±4) weight loss for those strawberries from group A and 45% (±1) for strawberries from group B, after 5 days of storage. According to Duan et al. (2011), migration of water from the fruit to the environment is the main cause of weight loss during storage. The use of edible coatings can reduce the weight loss because they act as an extra layer that also coats the stomata in the fruit, leading to a decrease in transpiration and respiration rates (Guerreiro et al., 2015; Ortega-Toro et al., 2017). The decrease in weight loss in the strawberries from groups A and B is probably related to coating composition. The entrapment of moisture between the CGP/PVA coating and fruit surface might reduce the dehydration rate of the fruits, thus increasing the strawberries shelf-lives. Despite the entrapped moisture being a factor that can favor the growth of fungus that were already on the fruit before the coating process, the natural antifungal activity (Cruz et al., 2017) shown by CGP probably inhibited the possibility of fungal development in the coated fruits, even without the presence of TCWDE in the formulation of the edible coating (Fig. 6 ). SEM images showed the surfaces of uncoated and coated strawberries on the first and fifth storage days at room temperature (Fig. 5). The structure of uncoated strawberries (Fig. 5a) underwent changes over time, showing a transition from a smooth to a rough surface as a consequence of the water loss. On the other hand, the structure of the strawberries that received the edible coating remained unchanged (Fig. 5b), showing that the CGP/PVA coating delayed the water-loss related deterioration process. These results were consistent with those reported in the literature (Gol et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Maqbool et al., 2011), confirming that coatings on fruits and vegetables can serve as a semipermeable barrier and cause a reduction in water loss and oxidation reactions, which delay the product's senescence process. The efficiency of the antifungal growth effects of the CGP/PVA edible coating containing TWCDE were evaluated in tests using Penicillium sp., a common fungus pathogen in fruits, as a contaminant. Strawberries were examined over 5 days of storage (Fig. 6). The visible microbial growth on the fruit was characterized as brown spots and softening in the injured zone. Coated strawberries (group A and B) maintained a uniform appearance, with minor loss of mass and color variation. They did not show signs of visible fungal decomposition during the storage period (Fig. 6b and c). However, the uncoated strawberries were completely vulnerable to the deteriorative actions of the inoculated fungus and showed weight loss, size reduction, and color alteration in addition to signs of fungal contamination and advanced deterioration (Fig. 6a). The CGP/PVA edible coating without TCWDE enzymes (Fig. 6b) was apparently enough to avoid fungal development on the strawberries. These results could be explained as a function of the physical barrier provided by the coating layer and also due to the intrinsic antimicrobial activity of CGP as reported by Cruz et al. (2017), who observed that CGP powder caused cell wall changes in Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium spp."
16,Conclusions,"The blend of CGP and PVA using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent can produce a biodegradable hydrogel that could be used to prepare edible coatings with good mechanical properties and barrier features. CGP/PVA hydrogels showed a viscosity of 111 mPa.s, which was enough to form an edible and water-soluble coating with a homogeneous microstructural surface without the presence of aggregates or pores. The CGP/PVA edible coating showed 88% light transmission, thus allowing diverse applications. In addition, the biological tests showed that a CGP/PVA edible coating is efficient at preventing weight loss and fungal deterioration of strawberries. The weight loss process of the strawberries coated with the CGP/PVA edible coating was delayed. SEM showed that the structure of the coated strawberries was preserved after 5 days of storage at room temperature. Fungal growth inhibition tests showed that CGP/PVA edible coatings were efficient as an antimicrobial barrier even without bioactivation using TCWDE, preventing fungal contamination, and consequently increasing the shelf-life of fresh strawberries. Therefore, the combination of all of these characteristics allows for the use of CGP/PVA edible coatings as an ecofriendly and bioactive food packaging material that contributes to avoiding fungal contamination and water loss of fresh fruits during storage."
