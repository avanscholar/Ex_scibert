0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, the development of clean and renewable technology has become one of the effective measures for facing the fast-growing consumption of fossil fuels and resultant pollutant emission [1–3]. Since Fujishima and Honda found that TiO2 electrode could photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen under UV irradiation [4]. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution has gained increasing attention, which could convert inexhaustible solar energy into clean hydrogen on semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Numerous efforts have been devoted to explore the photocatalytic water splitting performance of various kinds of semiconductors [5–8]. However, their inherent physicochemical drawbacks severely limit their practical application. Typically, the wide band-gap (Eg) makes TiO2 only active in ultraviolet light, which only accounts for ˜4% of solar spectra [9,10]. Besides, a suitable band positions of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is essential [11,12]. ZnIn2S4, as a ternary sulfide semiconductor, possesses a suitable Eg corresponding to the visible-light light. It has attracted far-ranging interests and been regarded as a promising candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen production due to its excellent photocatalytic performance, favorable chemical stability and facile preparation [13–16]. However, the fast recombination of photogenerated electron and hole hinder their large-scale applications. Accordingly, various strategies have been employed to enhance the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4, such as preparation of various morphologies, doping transition-metal ions, and formation of heterojunctions with other semiconductors or carbon materials [17–20]. Notably, it is proved that incorporation of carbon materials into the ZnIn2S4-based photocatalytic system can greatly suppress the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity [21,22]. Among different dimensionality carbon materials, Zero-dimensional (0D) carbon dots (CDs) possess unique properties combining the graphene nature and size-resulted quantum effects. Recently, it is widely used as photosensitizer to construct high-performance photocatalytic systems combined with other photocatalysts [23,24]. To date, researches were carried out mainly surrounding the effect of the content of CDs in composites on the photocatalytic performance of composites system or the advantages of CDs introduced over other carbon-based materials [25,26]. Nevertheless, few researches were focused on the substantial effect of the preparation methods of CDs-based composites photocatalysts on photocatalytic activity. To date, the preparation methods of CDs-based composite photocatalysts mainly include three basic types: 1) One-pot hydrothermal method: the CDs and the precursor of photocatalyst were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and then heated together for a period of time [27]. 2) Hydrothermal deposition method: the CDs and the as-prepared photocatalysts were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and then heated together for a period of time [28]. 3) Stirring method: the CDs and the as-prepared photocatalysts were dispersed in solution with continuing stirring for a long time [29]. In this context, we first analyzed and compared the photocatalytic performance of CDs/ZIS photocatalysts prepared with three different methods under the same reaction conditions. The structural, optical characteristics, surface element composition and chemical state of the as-prepared composite photocatalysts were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient photocurrent responses of ZIS-H sample indicated that the composites photocatalysts prepared by hydrothermal method have the most efficient separation and transport of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, hydrogen production experiments further revealed that the ZIS-H sample shows the highest hydrogen production rate and the most outstanding stability. This work highlights the effect of the preparation method of composites photocatalysts on photocatalytic performance and provides a new idea for the design and construction of composite photocatalysts."

Then the solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed autoclave was heated to 180 °C for 5 h. The final product was collected by centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to separate out the precipitate. Finally, the CDs powder was obtained by freeze-drying."

After that, TAA (4 mmol) was added into the above solution under stirring for 30 min. Then, the resultant suspension was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was heated to 180 °C and maintained for 12 h. After the autoclaves were cooled down to room temperature naturally, the as-synthesized products were rinsed several times with water and alcohol alternately, and dried at 80 °C. The pure ZIS samples were synthesized in the same process without adding CDs."

After cooling down to room temperature, the as-synthesized products were collected by centrifugation. Afterwards, the product was washed by ethanol and water respectively for several times. Finally, the samples were dried at 80 °C to get yellow powder. The synthetic method of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were presented in Scheme. 1 ."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, s-4800). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement was conducted using a JEOL JEM 2100 F microscope working at 200 kV. Powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was examined on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA). UV–vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were determined by a UV–vis-NIR Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda950). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on Axis Ultra HAS. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The BET surface area was evaluated by N2 adsorption in a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Bel sorpⅡ, Bayer Japan Co., Ltd., Japan)."
8,Photoelectrochemical tests,"2.7 Photoelectrochemical tests Transient photocurrent responses and Mott-Schottky plots were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760e Instruments) using a standard three-electrode system. The prepared samples were used as the working electrodes, a Pt wire is used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl is used as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.2 M, 100 ml) as the electrolyte. The flat band potential vs RHE is calibrated by the Nernst equation (EvsRHE = EvsAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.0592 pH). The working electrode was prepared as follows: 10 mg of photocatalyst was ultrasonically dispersed into 4 ml ethanol solution containing 30 μL of 10 wt% Nafion. The slurry was uniformly smeared onto fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrate (1 cm × 1 cm) and dried under infrared light for 30 min."
9,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.8 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity Typically, 100 ml of deionized water containing 50 mg of photocatalyst and 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S mixed sacrificial agent was added into a 300 ml quartz reactor, which is connected to a closed-cycle circulation system. Then, the reactor was subjected to vacuum until the pressure gauge was stable. A 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as light source. The reactor was kept at room temperature with cooling water. The gas produced during reaction was detected using an online gas chromatography and used high purity Argon as the carrier gas."
10,Results and discussion,"TEM image and the corresponding size distribution of CDs were presented in Fig. S1. Notably, CDs have been successfully prepared by hydrothermal method, with a size range from 1 to 7 nm and an average size of 3.7 nm (40 particle statistics). The optical properties of CDs were characterized by UV–vis spectra. the UV–vis absorption spectrum of CDs shows a strong peak centered at 280 nm (Fig. S3), which indicates that the as obtained CDs possess excellent optical performance. Moreover, the functional groups of CDs were explored by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. S4, five main characteristic absorption bands of CDs appear at 1081, 1410, 1616, 1736, 2929, and 3414 eV, corresponding to C–O-C/C–O, -C-H, CC, -C = O, -C-H, and −OH, respectively [31]. These functional groups endow CDs good water-solubility. SEM images of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were shown in Fig. 1 a-d. The pristine ZIS sample exhibited a well-bedded flower-like structure assembled by nanosheets and its diameter is about 10 μm (Fig. 1a). The EDS images of ZIS sample show Zn, ln, S and C elements, which consistent with the elemental composition of ZIS. The C elements maybe come from the instrument contamination (Fig. 1e). The SEM images of ZIS-S sample show that ZIS-S sample still maintained the initial morphology of ZIS, indicating that the mechanical stirring hardly damaged the structure of sample (Fig. 1b). Differently, we notice that the content of C elements on ZIS-S sample has increased compared with the pure ZIS sample after combined with CDs (Fig. 1f). Different from the ZIS sample, ZIS-HD sample become more compact and the ZIS nanosheets on ZIS-HD evolve from sharp to blunt (Fig. 1c). Similarly, the content of C elements in ZIS-HD sample is increased after hydrothermal deposition process (Fig. 1g). The SEM image of ZIS-H sample is presented in Fig. 1 d. Surprisingly, a more seriously agglomeration of ZIS nanosheets were found on ZIS-H sample. Meanwhile, there are a large number of nanoflowers with smaller diameter. The result could be explained by the fact that CDs would suppress the growth of ZIS nanosheet in the process of evolution from nanoparticle to nanoflower. Interestingly, the content of C elements in ZIS-H sample is the highest (Fig. 1h). The above result indicates that the synthetic method have a critical effect on the morphology and the content of C elements of ZIS/CDs sample. Thereinto, the hydrothermal method has the greatest damage to the morphology of sample. Certainly, the hydrothermal method will load the sample with more CDs under the same raw materials. In order to explore the structure and morphology of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples, the TEM images of different samples were presented. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the ZIS sample exhibit a well-defined flower structure and clear edge, which indicates that the growth mode of ZIS nanoflowers were formed by the outward extension of the intermediate seeds. Obviously, the ZIS-S sample demonstrates the similar features of ZIS sample. Differently, we can find some small particles attached on the surface of ZIS-S sample (Fig. 2b), indicating that the CDs particle were successfully loaded on the ZIS sample. Similarly, the ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples follows the same rules (Fig. 2 c and d). Additionally, it should be note that the ZIS-H sample can load more CDs under the same conditions. Furthermore, the EDX mapping images unequivocally corroborate the homogeneous distribution of the Zn, In, S and C elements throughout the ZIS-H sample (Fig. 2e). In addition to lattice fringes of 0.32 nm corresponding to the (102) crystallographic plane of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, clear lattice fringes of 0.22 nm corresponding to the (100) plane of graphite phase CQDs (Fig. S5), respectively, can be observed in the HRTEM image of the ZIS-H, indicating that the CQD nanocomposite has been loaded onto the surface of ZnIn2S4 [16,18,25]. As illustrated in the XRD patterns of CDs, two characteristic peak appear at around 25.8° and 43.6°, which are attributed to the (002) and (100) plane of carbon structure, respectively [32]. Fig. 3 a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples. All of them show nearly the same diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 21.5, 27.7, 30.3, 39.9, 47.4, 52.4 and 55.6°, which can be indexed to (006), (104), (102), (108), (112), (116), and (022) facet crystal planes of hexagonal ZIS, respectively (JCPDS No. 65-2023) [33]. Notably, no characteristic diffraction peaks for CDs were detected on the pattern of ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples, which is attributed to the low content and relatively low diffraction intensity of CDs in ZIS/CDs sample. The XRD patterns magnification of ZIS (006) facet diffraction peak were presented in Fig. 3 b. Notably, it is noted that the XRD peak for (006) facet show a slight low-angle shift for all ZIS/CDs samples compared with the pure ZIS sample. On the other hand, the corresponding data of d (006) spaces of samples were presented in Table. 1 . The value of d (006) spaces also exhibit the same trend. That is, the higher the C element on ZIS sample, the larger the shift of the facet and spaces. The previous reports demonstrated that the introduction of carbon materials into ZIS sample would strengthen interaction between ZIS crystals and carbon materials, leading to a macro-residual tensile stress to the ZIS and the regional lattice expansion [34]. Similarly, the above explanation can be applied to ZIS/CDs samples. Moreover, it can be concluded that the content of CDs has a positive effect on this phenomenon. The Raman spectra of ZIS/CDs samples were used to investigate the electronic properties of CDs and doping levels. As shown in Fig. 3c, two symbolic characteristic peaks at 1346 and 1596 cm−1 were observed, which correspond to the D and G bands of CDs, respectively [35]. In addition, all ZIS/CDs samples exhibit the presence the D and G bands of CDs, which confirmed the CDs particles were successfully introduced onto the surface of ZIS. The previous researches have confirmed that the ratio of ID/IG is a crucial indicator of the graphitization degree of carbonaceous materials [36]. The ratio of ID/IG of CDs and ZIS/CDs samples were summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the ZIS-H and ZIS-HD samples show a higher ratio of ID/IG than ZIS-S and CDs, which could be attributed to the reduction of CDs during hydrothermal processes. as shown in Fig. 3d, the ZIS/CDs and ZIS samples exhibit stepwise adsorption and desorption behavior Furthermore, according to the calculation from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the surface area values (SBET) and average pore diameter were presented in Table 1. The EDS analysis have confirmed that the different syntheticmethod would introduce the different content of CDs onto the surface of ZIS sample. Consistently, the SBET and pore size values of ZIS/CDs samples have a trend consistent with EDS analysis. The SBET and average pore diameter of ZIS show the largest value among on all ZIS and ZIS/CDs sample, and the SBET and average pore diameter value of ZIS sample were 97 m2 g−1 and 4.2 nm, respectively. After the introduction of CDs, the SBET and average pore diameter of ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H gradually decreased. The SBET and average pore diameter of ZIS-H was decreased to 49 m2. g−1 and 1.7 nm, respectively, possibly due to the blockage of pore in ZIS sample by CDs [37]. The electronic state of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were investigated by the XPS and the results were exhibited in Fig. 4 . The binding energies of 1045.1 and 1023.1 eV attribute to Zn 2p, 452.8 and 445.1 eV to In 3d, and 161.8 eV to S 2p [38]. It is noted that the binding energies of Zn 2p signals in ZIS-H sample show shifted slightly toward the higher binding energy as compared to the pure ZIS sample (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the binding energies of In 3d signals in ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples also shifted slightly toward higher binding energy compared with the pure ZIS sample (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the binding energies of S 2p of all ZIS/CDs sample show an obvious shift toward higher binding energy compared with the pure ZIS sample (Fig. 4c). This indicates that there is a strong interaction between CDs and ZIS at the interface of the heterojunction, which is well consistent with the XRD result [39]. The XPS spectra of the ZIS/CDs samples in the C1s region shows three peaks approximately at 284.8 and 286.6 eV, which can be assigned to the carboxyl (OCO), epoxy/hydroxyl carbon (C–O) and sp2-hybridized carbon (CC), respectively (Fig, 4d). This oxygen-containing groups contribute to enhance the water solubility of photocatalyst, thus improving the photocatalytic performance. It is obviously found that the peak ascribed to the C–O in ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples shows significantly decreases compared with ZIS-S sample. Meanwhile, the peak corresponding to the OC = O in ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples totally disappeared, indicating that the hydrothermal treatment has an important effect on the reduction degree of CDs [40]. The UV − visible diffuse reflectance spectra were employed to elucidate the optical absorption characteristics of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples. As show in Fig. 5 a and b, pure ZIS sample exhibits an absorption edge at about 560 nm and optical energy gap is calculated to be 2.33 eV from the Kubelka–Munk function [41]. Interestingly, absorption of all samples in the visible region were significantly enhanced to varying degrees, while the band gaps didn’t change, which can be attributed to the difference in content of black CDs incorporated into the surface of ZIS via different synthetic method. This result is in agreement with the observed the samples colour varying from yellow to dark green [42]. The surface charge transfer effect and excited state of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were detected by the PL spectra. As show in Fig. 6 a, the emission peak of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples show a broad peak approximately at 550 nm, which can be indexed to the band gap transition of ZnIn2S4 [43]. It is obviously found that all ZIS/CDs samples show a lower fluorescence intensity than pure ZIS sample, suggesting that the ZIS/CDs samples possessed a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes than the bare ZIS. It can be further inferred that CDs possess excellent electro-conductivity and could accept the Photogenerated electron derived from the surface of ZIS sample, thereby improving the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs [38]. Moreover, the ZIS-H sample shows the lowest fluorescence intensity because of its the highest content of CDs among ZIS/CDs samples, which further confirmed the above conclusion. Similarly, the transient photocurrent responses are another powerful technology to explore the surface charge transfer between CDs and ZIS. As revealed in Fig. 6b, the photocurrent response of all ZIS/CDs samples are better than pure ZIS sample, suggesting that the incorporation of CDs could significantly improve the electron transport of ZIS. To further confirm that the introduction of CDs into ZIS samples can enhance the electron transport rate of ZIS. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed. The results are presented in Fig. 6 c. According to previous literature reports, the intermediate-frequency response is associated with the electron transport and transfer at the ZIS/electrode interface [39]. It’s noted that the arc radius of the Nyquist semicircle of all ZIS/CDs samples are much smaller than the pure ZIS and the ZIS-H sample exhibits the smallest arc radius of the Nyquist semicircle, suggesting that the ZIS/CDs sample has a lower resistance than that of pure ZIS and that the ZIS-H sample possesses the lowest resistance. These results further confirmed that the incorporated CDs into ZIS sample could facilitates the electron-hole separation. The photocatalytic H2–production performance of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were examined under visible light irradiation using the Na2S and Na2SO3 mixing aqueous solution as sacrificial reagent. The hydrogen evolution rate of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were presented in Fig. 7 and Table 1. Specifically, the hydrogen evolution rate of the ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples were 1.42, 2.19, 2.25, and 4.15 mmolg−1. h−1, respectively. It indicates that the CDs as co-catalyst could dramatically enhanced the photocatalytic performance of ZIS. As we know, CDs is an ideal electron acceptor, while the ZIS sample can produce electron under visible light excitation. Therefore, the recombination of electron and hole would be suppressed by partial electron injected into CDs, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts. Moreover, the loading content of CDs have a vital effect on the photocatalytic performance of ZIS. Mott–Schottky measurements were recorded in darkness at a frequency of 500 and 1000 Hz for deeper understand the intrinsic electronic properties of ZIS and ZIS/CDs samples. As displayed in Fig.8 a-d, the flat-band potential of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples determined from Mott–Schottky plots is ca. -1.04, -0.9, -0.86 and -0.76 V versus Ag/AgCl at pH = 6.8, respectively. The calculated conversion Mott–Schottky plots is ca -0.84, -0.70, -0.66 and -0.56 V versus NHE at pH = 6.8, respectively. The conduction bands of ZIS and ZIS/CDs samples are very close to their flat-band potentials attributed to all of them demonstrated the characteristic behavior of an n-type semiconductor [44]. The conduction band (CB) of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples can be estimated to be -0.84, -0.70, -0.66 and -0.56 V versus NHE at pH = 6.8, respectively. Combination of the band gap value of sample obtained from the DRS result, the valence band (VB) of ZIS, ZIS-S, ZIS-HD and ZIS-H samples can be calculated to be 1.49, 1.63, 1.67 and 1.77 V versus NHE at pH = 6.8, respectively. The corresponding band structures of the samples were systematically shown in Fig. 8 e. Obviously, the ZIS/CDs samples have an increased VB width and elevated CB minimum in contrast to the pure ZIS, indicating a much higher mobility and better consumption of photoexcited holes for the ZIS/CDs samples. Furthermore, although the ZIS-H sample show the maximal CB value among all samples, it still has the ability to convert H+ into H2 because of its CB value more negative than that of H+/ H2 (0.52 V vs. NHE)[45]. And the highest activity of ZIS-H should be the higher CDs contents, and the photocatalytic mechanism also showed in Scheme S1."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the synthesis methods have a crucial influence on photoelectric performance and photocatalytic H2 production rate of CDs/ZIS photocatalysts. The results of PL and photoelectrochemical tests indicates that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes of all CDs/ZIS samples has been enhanced a dramatically compared to pure ZIS. The photocatalytic H2 production experiments further confirmed the above results. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of CDs/ZIS samples owing to the CDs as co-catalyst and electron acceptor significantly improve the charge separation efficiency to enhance photocatalytic performance of CDs/ZIS samples, Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of CDs/ZIS samples prepared by three types of methods under the same conditions have a significant difference, which could be attributed to the difference of the content of CDs on CDs/ZIS samples prepared by different methods."
