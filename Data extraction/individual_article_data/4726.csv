0,Introduction,"Advanced water splitting for clean and sustainable hydrogen resources has turned out to be an intensively attractive topic because of the increasing energy demands and more serious environmental issues [1–5]. Among all the well-developed strategies, electrocatalytic water splitting for production of highly pure H2 has been proved to be a highly-efficient one [6,7]. The central issue in the water-splitting process is seeking for a highly–active catalyst. Currently, platinum–group electrocatalysts are widely regarded as the most effective ones for reduction of overpotentials of the two half-reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), during the overall water–splitting process [8,9]. However, their high costs and limited reserves are serious barriers to their large–wide practical applications. Thusly, for reducing the costs and maximizing the H2 production efficiency, developing stable earth-abundant metal-based electrocatalysts have turned out to be a critical task. In the past a few years, transition metal phosphides, including molybdenum phosphide (MoP) [10,11], iron phosphide (FeP) [12,13], nickel phosphide [14,15] and cobalt phosphide [16–18] etc., have been found to be excellent substations to platinum-group catalysts with high catalytic performance and low cost. It was found that the P atoms on the surface of metal phosphide hold negative charges for trapping protons. Additionally, P atoms can also provide a high activity for the dissociation of H2 molecules. Both the advantages provide the metal phosphide catalysts promising electrocatalytic activities [19]. Among all the developed transition metal phosphides, Co2P electrocatalyst is of very advantageous for large–scale model production of hydrogen, owing to the suitable free energy of hydrogen adsorption and plasticity of element valence state. Moreover, since cobalt is one of the most abundant and cheapest metallic elements on earth, the cobalt-based electrocatalyst to be an economical choice [20,21]. Although numerous Co2P catalysts have been reported as HER catalysts, Co2P with poor electronic conductivity leads to a less efficient charge transfer between cobalt phosphides and electronic conductive framework [22–24]. To enhance the HER performance, the metal-metal phosphide composites have been developed. Because of the catalytically synergetic effect between metal nanoparticles and metal phosphide nanoparticles, charges can be easily aggregated and separated on the surface of metal nanoparticles, which promotes the reduction of hydrogen ions for a boosted HER performance [25]. When regarding the HER reaction, long-term running is an inevitable factor, but the free-standing metal-metal phosphide catalysts suffer from instability and aggregation. Inspired by the confining effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for limiting the aggregation of particles, the CNTs encapsulated nanoparticles can provide physical and chemical protection for the encapsulated nanoparticles (including metal phosphides), and outstanding stability can be expected [26–29]. Herein, a CNTs encapsulated cobalt–cobalt phosphide growth on graphene (Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO) were engineered via a simple one-pot high–temperature phosphating reaction. The catalysts were well-characterized to verify that the metallic Co is vital to the formation of CNTs. The obtained Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalysts were further employed in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the excellent catalytic performance was gained, which is originated from the existence of metallic Co and synergistic effect of the catalyst. Moreover, to highlight the confining effect of CNTs, the stability of the optimized Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalyst was tested and excellent stability during the 20 h stability test was gained. This work may provide a rational strategy for the preparation of metal-metal phosphide electrocatalysts for an enhanced electrocatalytic performance."
1,Experimental,"All chemicals with analytical purity were gained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Shanghai Co., Ltd., and no further purification is needed. 20% Pt/C catalyst was gained from Alfa Aesar."
2,Preparation of CNT Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of CNT Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalyst The carbon nanotubes encapsulated Cobalt–Cobalt phosphide on graphene (Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO) catalyst was synthesized by following process: typically, n mmol (n = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, triphenylphosphine and dicyandiamide were grounded with 40 mg GO (mass ratio of Co(NO3) 2·6H2O: triphenylphosphine: dicyandiamide was 1 : 2: 4). Afterwards, the uniform powder was transferred to an alundum tube and heated to 850 °C in a N2 atmosphere. The ramping rate was set as 4 °C·min−1 and kept at 850 °C for 1 h, further cooled down to room temperature naturally. The catalyst was washed with water and ethanol for three times and dry at 40 °C in a vacuum condition. The final catalyst was named as Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–n (where n = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9)."
3,Preparation of Co–Co2P@CNT catalyst,2.2 Preparation of Co–Co2P@CNT catalyst The preparation process of carbon nanotubes encapsulated Cobalt–Cobalt phosphide (Co–Co2P@CNT) was similar to that of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO without adding GO.
4,Preparation of Co2P@C/rGO-n catalyst,"2.3 Preparation of Co2P@C/rGO-n catalyst Similar, the carbon-coated Cobalt phosphide on graphene (Co2P@C/rGO-n) was prepared by the same process of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalyst use melamine replace dicyandiamide."
5,Preparation of rGO,"2.4 Preparation of rGO The graphite oxide was prepared by a modified Hummer’s method with natural graphite powder as the raw material [30,31]. The rGO was obtained by being heated at 850 °C under N2 protection for 1 h."
6,Material characterization,"2.5 Material characterization The XRD patterns were gained from a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (scanning rate was set up with 7° min−1 and the scanning range was 5–90°). The specific surface and pore sizes of the catalysts were characterized by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 with the methods of Brunauer–Emmet–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM–2100, Japan) and field–emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM–6700, Japan) was employed for determination of the morphology of as–prepared catalysts. XPS data was obtained from an X–ray photoelectron spectrometer by Al Ka radiation (ESCALAB 250). Raman spectra were achieved by a DXR Raman microscope with 532 nm excitation sourced from an Ar + laser. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO was measured by Autochem II 2920."
7,Electrochemical measurements for HER,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements for HER Typically, a three-electrode system was employed to test the HER performance on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation with a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (Chen Hua Instruments, Shanghai, China). During all experiment, the nitrogen was purged above the electrolyte to keep the condition is undisturbed. The glass carbon electrode (GCE, the diameter is 5 mm) was buffed by Al2O3 powders, which can ensure the electrode surface is smooth. The reference electrode hired a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and the counter electrode was graphite (diameter is 6 mm). Although there are very few amounts of graphite would be exfoliated from the counter graphite, the graphite counter electrode is relative stable (Fig. S1). The homogeneous ink of the catalyst was formed by the flowed steps. 2 mg of catalyst and 20 μL of Nafion suspension (DuPont, USA) was suspended in 1.98 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol, then ultrasonic agitation about 30 min to ensure the catalyst was fully dispersed. 10 μL of homogeneous ink was dropped onto the surface of the GCE and drying under room temperature (the loading content of catalyst was 0.102 mg cm−2). The potential in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was calculated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by this formula: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.281 V [32]. All potentials in this paper were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structure and property of catalysts,"3.1 Structure and property of catalysts To provide the detailed components of the prepared samples, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of all samples were performed and the obtained XRD diffractograms are displayed in Fig. 1 and Figs. S2 and S3. In the XRD patterns of Co–Co2P@CNT and Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO, two characteristic peaks for Co2P, being attributed to (121) and (211) lattices, were clearly detected, which agrees with standard orthorhombic Co2P (JCPDS PDF card NO. 32–0306) [33,34]. Besides, metallic Co was also clearly detected with three characteristic peaks including (111), (200) and (220) lattices, being indexed with standard cubic Co (JCPDS PDF card NO. 15–0806) [35]. The results illustrate that with dicyandiamide as the carbon precursors, Co in the Co–Co2P@CNT-0.7 and Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 catalysts exist in the form of Co2P and metallic Co. Differently, with melamine as the carbon precursor, no peaks for metallic Co were detected in Co2P@C/rGO, and only orthorhombic Co2P was found instead. Additionally, for GO, a clear peak was detected around ∼11°, and the peak was widened and weakened after being treated at 850 °C, and a new peak was detected around 2θ = 25°, indicating the reduction of GO to rGO (Fig. S2). Meanwhile, in the prepared Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 and Co@C/rGO-0.7 samples, the characteristic peak around 25° was also clearly found. The result demonstrates that the GO was successfully reduced and introduced to the catalysts during the preparation process. The widened and weakened intensity of the GO peaks illustrates that the stacking status of rGO was destroyed during the thermal pyrolysis process. Besides, with lower Co contents, the intensities of the peaks for Co2P and metallic Co both decreased (Figs. S3 and S4). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to investigate the morphologies of the prepared samples in Figs. 2 , S5, and S6. For the investigation of the formation process of Co–Co2P@CNT-rGO catalysts, the SEM images of samples prepared under different temperatures were presented. As shown in Fig. S5 that when the pyrolysis temperature was 650 °C, the catalyst presented in the form of bulk structure. With the temperature increased to 750 °C, CNTs with diameters of 20–50 nm initially formed (Fig. S6). When the pyrolysis temperature further increased to 850 °C, the length of CNT increased to ∼1 μm, and the diameter retained to be 20–50 nm (Fig. 2a and b). It is noteworthy that compared with pure rGO (Fig. 2c), the graphene nanosheets were fragmented to be smaller pieces with sizes of 1–2 μm during the pyrolysis process, and numerous CNTs were formed on one side of their surfaces. To highlight the importance of metallic Co in the formation process of CNT, SEM image of Co2P@C/rGO was performed in Fig. 2d. Obviously, no CNT was detected in Co2P@C/rGO, and the carbon in the catalyst existed in the form of the bulk structure instead, which is not beneficial to the dispersion of catalytically active sites. The detailed structures of the prepared samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) in Fig. 3 . For Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7, we can see from the TEM image that the nanoparticles are clearly detected in the front end or inner sides of CNTs, indicating that the formation of CNT is originated from the existence of Co and Co2P, which well agrees with the SEM characterization. Besides, the rGO fragments were clearly seen under the CNT, illustrating that the rGO functioned as the platform for the growth of CNTs. Moreover, compared with Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 (Fig. S7), which was in a bulk structure, the particles in Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 hold a better dispersion. The enhanced dispersion mainly being originated from the formation of CNTs, which can effectively disperse the metal particles. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was further performed in Fig. 3c and d. As we can see from the HRTEM image, for the nanoparticles, two couples of lattice fringes are clearly seen. The calculated lattice distance of Section I in Fig. 3c was found to be 0.205 nm, which is assigned to (111) lattice facet of metallic Co. Meanwhile, another couple of lattice fringes in Section II with lattice distances of 0.221, 0.219, and 0.208 nm are respectively detected, corresponding to the (121), (220), and (221) lattice facets of Co2P. The result indicates that when the dicyandiamide was employed as the carbon source, Co2P was partly reduced to form metallic Co and the metallic Co and Co2P co-exist in the same particle. Fig. S8 was obviously to explained the Co–Co2P nanoparticles were encapsulated into the CNT. Additionally, the HRTEM image showed that the CNT was well crystallized with the numbers of layers to be 2–6 layers and the CNTs tightly covered the Co–Co2P alloyed nanoparticles, indicating the confining effect of CNTs to the Co–Co2P alloyed nanoparticles [36]. In the characterization of carbon-based materials, the Raman spectrum is an important tool. The Raman spectra of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-n catalysts were recorded in Fig. 4 . As we can see from the Raman spectra, two chrematistic peaks around 1350 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 were detected. The two peaks are attributed to D band and G band of graphene, respectively. The D band stands for the edge structural properties, including defects in carbon rings, the sp 2 vibration of disordered carbon and vacancies, etc., while the G band represents the sp 2 vibration of ordered graphene six-membered rings [36,37]. The defect density of graphene can be determined by ID/IG . As shown in the Raman spectra, the ID/IG values of GO, rGO, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7, Co–Co2P@CNT, and Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 were calculated to be 0.87, 1.03, 1.07, 1.00, and 1.05, respectively. The ID/IG value of GO powder is larger than the value of GO, indicating that the disordered carbon content increased after 850 °C treatment. Meanwhile, compared with Co–Co2P@CNT, the addition of rGO also gives rise to the increment of ID/IG value. The result demonstrates that the increment of ID/IG value mainly originates from the addition of rGO. In electrochemistry, the increment of ID/IG value indicates more disordered carbon contents, further induces a better electron transfer performance. Thusly, the introduction of rGO is in favor of the electron transfer during the HER process, and further leads to an enhanced HER performance [38]. Fig. 5 a shows that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–n samples are of type IV with an H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, reflecting the presence of a mesoporous structure of the composites. Specific surface area data of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–n samples were recorded in Table S1. The specific surface area of Co–Co2P@CNT composite catalyst without graphene reached 99.10 m2 g−1, owing to the existence of CNT. For Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO samples, when the cobalt content increased from 0.3 mmol to 0.7 mmol, the specific surface area of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO composite electrocatalyst increased from 55.02 to 78.35 m2 g−1. When the cobalt content was further increased to 0.9 mmol, the specific surface area reduced to 60.97 m2 g−1, which may be ascribed to a large amount of cobalt induced decrement. The specific surface area is consistent with the HER catalytic activity of the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO composite electrocatalytic material. This result shows that the specific surface area has a significant correlation with the activity of the catalyst. Additionally, the specific surface area data of the Co2P@C/rGO-n composite electrocatalytic material also showed in Fig. S9 and Table S2. Compared with the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO, the specific surface area of the CNT-free sample, Co2P@C/rGO-0.7, downshifted to 16.56 m2 g−1, much lower than those of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-n. The results illustrate that CNT is important to the high specific surface areas. Additional chemical composition and electronic environment of the catalysts were further determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the XPS survey spectra in Fig. 6 a, we can see that all elements, including Co, P, C, N, and O, were found in Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7. Furthermore, the high–resolution XPS spectra of all elements were measured in Fig. 6. High-resolution C 1s spectrum of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 presented in Fig. 6b was divided into four peaks, which are corresponding to C–C (284.6 eV), C–N (285.2 eV), C–O (286.7 eV), and CO (288.6 eV), respectively [39]. Meanwhile, for the N 1s core-level XPS spectra (Fig. 6c), three peaks around 398.2 eV, 399.3 eV and 401.1 eV can be fitted, respectively being ascribed to pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen [40–42]. The result demonstrates that a few N has been introduced to the catalysts, which is in favor of the electrochemical performance [43,44]. In the O 1s core-level XPS spectrum (Fig. 6d), the peak at 532.9 eV is the characteristic peak of O–P. Along with the O–P, another two peaks around 532.9 eV and 531.9 eV, being assigned for O–C and OC, can be fitted. In the Co 2p core-level spectra in Fig. 6e, after careful fitting, two peaks around 778.3 and 793.3 eV can be seen, attributing to the Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 of Co0, respectively. Meanwhile, the peaks around 780.8 eV and 795.8 eV were also detected, which are assigned to the Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 of Co2+/3+. The result confirms the coexistence of Co2P and metallic Co. Another two peaks around 785.6 eV and 801.3 eV are satellite peaks [45–48]. The P 2p core-level XPS spectrum was presented in Fig. 6f. The two peaks located around 129.3 eV and 130.2 eV are attributed to P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 in Co2P of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO. Besides, the peak around 133.6 eV is ascribed to the P–O, in accordance with the O 1s core-level XPS spectrum, which is originated from the triphenylphosphine reacted with oxide groups of GO [49,50]. For the XPS analysis results of Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 in Fig. S10, almost all the conclusions are similar, and the only difference is that no metallic Co was found in the Co 2p core-level spectrum. The result illustrates that the Co2P@C/rGO sample only contains Co2P but no metallic Co was found, which is in accordance with the XRD patterns."
10,Discussion of enhanced HER performance,"3.2 Discussion of enhanced HER performance To investigate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the prepared samples, the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO catalysts were employed in electrocatalytic HER with the scanning rate of 2 mV s−1 in acidic aqueous solution and the result was presented in Fig. 7 . All the LSV curves in the figure were obtained after iR correction. In electrocatalytic HER, overpotential is an important parameter for evaluation of the HER activity, which commonly uses the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. As we can see from the result that the LSV curves of GCE and rGO were almost straight ones, indicating the very poor HER activity. While for the prepared samples, the overpotential of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.3, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.5, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.9, and Co–Co2P@CNT were measured to be 231, 222, 210, 240, and 245 mV, respectively. With the increment of the Co content, the HER performance increased as well, and the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 has the best HER performance. Nevertheless, when the Co content further raised, the HER activity showed a slight decrease, which may originate from the decrease of exposure of active sites and specific surface areas. It is noteworthy that the rGO almost show no HER activity, but the addition of rGO to Co–Co2P@CNT can enhance the catalytic activity remarkably. The enhanced HER performance of addition of rGO may be originated from the boosted electron transfer rate and the synergistic effect between rGO and catalytic active sites. Moreover, the two-dimensional plane structure of rGO is beneficial to the dispersion of catalytic active sites, which partly leading to a boosted HER performance. In addition, the corresponding Tafel plot curves were listed in Fig. 7b. Tafel plot is not only often used to indicate the electron transfer dynamics during the reaction process but also an important index to evaluate the HER performance. Generally, it is regarded that the smaller Tafel slope is in favor of a better HER activity [60]. The Tafel slope is determined by the following equation: η = b log j + a where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density. After careful calculation, the Tafel slopes of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.3, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.5, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.9, and Co–Co2P@CNT were determined to be 82.24, 71.35, 55.43, 87.18, and 93.10 mV dec−1, respectively. The Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 holds the smallest Tafel slope and a very large exchange current density of 5.62 × 10−3 mA cm−2. The result illustrates that Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 exhibited the best electron transfer rate and excellent HER performance [32]. Compared with Co–Co2P@CNT, the addition of rGO can readily enhance HER performance, indicating the synergistic effect of rGO [61]. Nevertheless, the reduction of HER activity over Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.9 may be ascribed to the poor exposure of active sites and lower BET surface area. Even though the HER performance of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 is still poorer than that of Pt/C, whose Tafel slope was 43.38 mV dec−1, the current HER catalyst holds an excellent electrocatalytic performance than previous reports on non–noble metal-based carbon catalysts (Table 1 ). To highlight the importance of metallic Co, the prepared Co2P@C/rGO catalysts were further employed in HER as a comparison (Fig. 8 and Fig. S11). As we can see from the result that the overpotential for Co2P@C/rGO–0.7 was found to be 282 mV (η10), which is much higher than that for Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 (210 mV). The result indicates that the existence of metallic Co in the electrocatalyst can evidently decrease the required potential of HER catalytic reaction, and thusly give rise to a better HER activity [41,62,63]. Moreover, Tafel slope and exchange current density for Co2P@C/rGO–0.7 were found to be 102.66 mV dec−1 and 3.78 × 10−3 mA cm−2. The higher Tafel slope and lower exchange current density for Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 illustrate that the existence of metallic Co in Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 can effectively promote the electron transfer for an enhanced HER performance [41,48]. To investigate the effects of reaction temperature and scanning rate over the electrocatalytic HER activity of the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 catalyst, we tested the HER activities under different reaction temperatures and scanning rates and the results were presented in Fig. 9 . The LSV curves of the catalyst under different temperature were recorded in Fig. 9a. The overpotentials were found to be 210, 204, 198, and 194 mV when the reaction temperature was 298, 308, 318, and 328 K, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slopes were calculated to be 55.43, 53.40, 50.02, and 51.34 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 9b). A conclusion can be gained that the reaction temperature rarely shows influence on HER performance. The effect of scanning rate on HER activity was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 9c. The results show that when the scanning rate changed from 2 to 40 mV s−1, the overpotential reduced ∼8 mV, indicating that higher scanning rate is beneficial to the improvement of HER performance. Nevertheless, the Tafel slope only decreased ∼4 mV dec−1 (Fig. 9d), illustrating that scanning rate can rarely promote the electron transfer during the HER process. In general, the HER performance of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO electrocatalyst is tiny affected by the reaction temperature and scan rate we choose. Stability is an important factor in the evaluation of HER electrochemical catalysts. Fig. 10 a records the LSV polarization curve of the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 catalyst after 500 cycles. As we can from the result that compared with the pristine LSV polarization curve, the curve after 500 cycling was not obviously changed, indicating that the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 holds excellent long–term HER activity. Additionally, the 20 h running current curve with a potential of 350 mV was shown in Fig. 10b. As it is exhibited that the current density only decreased by ∼15% in the first 4 h and stayed stable without further decrease due to a few catalysts drop from the surface of GCE during. On the other hand, the hydrogen bubble left from the GCE induced the drop of some catalyst particles from GCE, which will stroke the decline of current density during the first 4 h. However, the current density is stable during the last 16 h reveal that the stability of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7."
11,Possible mechanism of enhanced HER performance,"3.3 Possible mechanism of enhanced HER performance When discussing the HER performances for different catalysts, Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 shows the best HER activity. It is necessary to distinguish the importance of Co, CNT, and rGO. As it was characterized in the XPS result, a few N atoms are introduced to the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 catalyst, which can promote HER performance. However, since N atoms are also detected in Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 catalyst, it can be verified that the N-doping is not the only origin of boosted HER activity. Compared the HER performance of the Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 catalyst, we find the Co metal contribute the greatest improvement in HER process. It means the Co metal provide more active sites in HER process. The electrochemically-active surface area (ECSA) is a typical data to evaluate the HER activity of catalytic, it always determined by the electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC). Fig. S12 is CV curves of different catalysts with the potential range of −0.28–0.35 V (vs. SCE) at various scan rates (2–40 mV s−1). The EDLC of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7, Co–Co2P@CNT and Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 were 2.25, 1.53 and 0.95 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 11 ). The EDLC of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 is higher than Co2P@C/rGO-0.7, proved that the Co metal can improve the HER activity of catalysis. In addition, the EDLC of Co–Co2P@CNT is higher than Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 and lower than Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 means the rGO can also improve the HER process, but no more than Co metal. Meanwhile, the EDLC of Co–Co2P@CNT is higher than Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 suggests that the synergistic effect between Co and CNT can accelerate HER process sharply. This result proved that the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 show the maximum active sites in these catalysts because of the N-doping, existence of metallic Co together with CNT. The turnover frequency (TOF) is another important estimation for active sites of catalytic activity [64]. Fig. S13 is the cyclic voltammetry (CV, the scan rate is 50 mV s−1, PBS solution, pH = 7.0) to calculate the number of active sites, which present a one-electron process for both reduction and oxidation. The TOF of Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 is 155 mV at 4.0 s−1, and 170 mV at 7.0 s−1 (Fig. S14), which is higher than the other reported sample [65,66]. It gives another evidence that the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 is an outstanding HER catalyst. CO-TPD was used to estimate the dispersion of metal that the Co metal in Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 particle is 7.16%, as well as Co2P@C/rGO-0.7 is 5.79%, suggest that the CNT in the catalyst is conducive to dispersing the active particles. Simultaneously, the active particle diameter (hemisphere) is 14.28 and 17.20 nm for Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 and Co2P@C/rGO-0.7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was shown in Fig. 12 . The smallest semicircle for Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 means the catalyst with the best ionic and ohmic resistances because of the good conductivity [67]. Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO–0.7 presents the better ionic and ohmic resistance than Co–Co2P@CNT due to the rGO. It’s also better than Co2P@C/rGO–0.7 because of Co metal and CNT. And the increased HER activity was a benefit of the higher electrical conductivity of rGO, as well as the existence of N-doping along with the synergistic effect of metallic Co and CNT."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we successfully engineered a graphene single–side growth CNTs encapsulated cobalt–cobalt phosphide composite material (Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO) by a simple one-step high–temperature phosphating reaction. By rationally control the precursor, a metallic-Co-free electrocatalyst (Co2P@C/rGO) was also prepared as a comparison. All the catalysts were well-characterized and we found that the metallic Co is essential to the formation of CNTs. The formed CNTs is vital to the dispersion of catalytically active sites in turn. When both catalysts were employed in HER process, a boosted HER performance was expected with the presence of metallic Co, that the Tafel slope and exchange current density reached 55.43 mV dec−1 and 5.62 × 10−3 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition, the Co–Co2P@CNT/rGO-0.7 held very excellent stability, which is assigned to the confining effect of CNTs. We expect this work can afford a rational and simple strategy for preparation of metal-metal phosphide electrocatalysts for enhanced electrocatalytic performance."
