0,Introduction,"Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), a typical layered metal dichalcogenides semiconducting material (MX2), have received much attention in recent years due to its unique two-dimensional (2D) crystal structures similar to that of graphite [1,2]. MoSe2 is composed of weakly interacting layers of Se–Mo–Se which were held together by van der waals interactions [3]. The single- and few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets have been studied and applied in various fields including electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage devices, electrocatalysis and so on [4–10]. Various physical and chemical strategies including mechanical and chemical exfoliation [11,12], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [13], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [14], solid-state reactions [15] and solution chemical method [16,17] have been applied to obtain ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets. The exfoliation technique was popular to produce ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, however, exfoliation routes produce small amounts of samples and samples synthesized by this method might possess many defects and small lateral size, and this approach needs to operate with schlenk technique [18]. CVD method is also an attractive strategy for growth of high-quality MoSe2 nanosheets with desired thicknesses and excellent performance but the material−substrate interactions limit the yield and detailed analyses. By contrast, solution-chemical approaches have been emerging as a very promising alternative towards the high yield, low cost, and large scale production of all types of ultrathin 2D nanosheets [19–22]. Recently, many efforts have devoted to solution chemical synthesis, such as 2D-templated synthesis [23,24], hydro/solvothermal synthesis [16], self-assembly synthesis [25] and soft colloidal templated synthesis [26,27]. As compared to other wet chemical process, hydrothermal or solvothermal route is convenient and facile operated with mild reaction conditions. Zhou et al. developed a facile one-pot solvent-thermal method to fabricate MoSe2−x nanosheets with ethanol as solvent [16]. Song et al. synthesized SnSe2 nanosheets with benzyl alcohol as solvent and PVP as surfactant [28]. Actually, surfactants are undesirable for further applications, especially for catalysis and electronic devices. Therefore, it is urgent to find a surfactant free method for controlled synthesis of ultrathin 2D nanosheets. In addition, the experimental parameters, such as the concentration of precursors, solvent, reaction temperature are also important factors for the hydro/solvothermal synthesis method. Thus, modification of the thickness of 2D nanosheet just by altering solvent without the help of surfactants was in high demand. In the present work, MoSe2 nanosheets with ultrathin thickness of 3–6nm were synthesized by facile solvent-thermal method by using n-alcohol as solvent and without surfactants. The thickness of the MoSe2 nanosheets could be controlled by changing the chains of the n-alcohol solvent. The structure and morphology of the MoSe2 nanoflowers were characterized in details. The HER electrocatalytic performance of the as synthesized MoSe2 nanosheets was tested in 0.5M H2SO4 solution. Additionally, their adsorption performance was tested by the removal of rhodamine B in water. The as obtained MoSe2 in ethanol solvent exhibits the best electrochemical and adsorption performance may be due to its higher crystallinity and better wettability than other samples. This work indicates that except for thickness, the surface hydrophilicity is also an important factor for the application performance of MoSe2 nanosheets."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Selenium powder was used as the Se source, MoO3 powder was used as Mo source, and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) was used as the reducing agent, respectively. Ethanol (n-butanol, 1-hexanol, and n-octanol) was used as organic solvent. All of the reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of MoSe2 nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of MoSe2 nanosheets A certain amount of selenium powder and MoO3 powder were dissolved in hydrazine hydrate solution, and then distilled water and organic solvent (ethanol, n-butanol, 1-hexanol, and n-octanol) were added under stirring [16]. After that, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100mL for solvent-thermal treatment at 180°C–250°C temperature for 6h. The autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally and the as prepared samples were washed in distilled water and absolute ethanol respectively, and dried in the oven at 80°C. The samples synthesized in different solvents (ethanol, n-butanol, 1-hexanol, and n-octanol) were named as MoSe2-E, MoSe2-B, MoSe2-H and MoSe2-O, respectively."
4,Adsorption experiment,"2.3 Adsorption experiment Reactive brilliant Rhodamine B was chosen as the simulated pollutants to evaluate the adsorption ability of the as-prepared MoSe2 nanospheres. In a typical adsorption experiment, 15mg of the as-prepared MoSe2 nanospheres powder was mixed with 20mL of aqueous solutions of rhodamine B (50–100mgL−1) under stirring at a rate of 300rpm. During the adsorption period, 2mL of suspension was removed from the reactor at regular time intervals of 5min and centrifuged. Finally, the concentration of rhodamine B solution was analyzed by the UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu)."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system at an electrochemical station (CHI760E). The three-electrode configuration was adopted for polarization and electrolysis measurements, where a Hg/Hg2Cl2 (KCl saturated) electrode, large area Pt foil and MoSe2-based catalysts were used as the reference electrode, the counter electrode and the working electrode respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry with scan rate of 10mVs−1 was conducted in 0.5M H2SO4. For a Tafel plot, the linear portion is fit to the Tafel equation. All data has been corrected for a small ohmic drop based on impedance spectroscopy. All the potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The stability of the catalysts were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) carried out at a scan rate of 100mVs−1 for 1000 cycles. The potential of the SCE is related to RHE by the equation E(RHE)=E(Hg/Hg2Cl2)+270mV."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out in a parallel mode (ω=0.5°, 2θ varied from 20° to 80°) using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406Å). The microstructure and composition size of the sample were investigated by a SU8000 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage (3–5KV). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) were obtained on a Tecnai G20 (FEI Co., Holland) microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV, the sample powder was dispersed into ethanol and dropped a very dilute suspension onto a copper grid. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were collected with a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer from 200 to 800nm using BaSO4 as background. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG Multilab 2000 (VG Inc.) photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples were evaluated through the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 gas adsorption apparatus (USA). AFM height images of the films were obtained using a Bruker Metrology Nanoscope III-D atomic force microscope in tapping mode under atmospheric conditions. Tapping AFM tips (RTESP/Si,Bruker, USA) used for this study had a typical spring constant of 40Nm−1 and a resonance frequency of 300kHz. Typical scan line frequency was 0.5Hz and each image contained 512*512 pixels. The software was used for image display purposes is NanoScope_Analysis_v140r3sr5. Static contact angle (CA) measurements were performed with an optical contact angle meter (OCA20 Micro, Dataphysics, Germany). The wettability of the samples was determined by measuring CAs of one probe liquids: water."
7,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 indicated that the as prepared MoSe2 could be assigned to the hexagonal 2H-MoSe2 phase. [10] The peaks at 2θ=13.38°, 31.76°, 38.07°, 47.33°, 56.29° and 65.84°, correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (105), (110) and (200) planes of the hexagonal MoSe2, respectively. All of the diffraction peaks agree well with the standard pattern of the hexagonal MoSe2 (JCPDS card, no. 29-0914) for MoSe2 samples synthesized with ethanol solvent, revealing the high purity of the as-synthesized product. No peaks assigned to Se power and MoO3 could be observed for all the as synthesized samples in different solvents. The crystallinity becomes much weaker as the increasing of the chains of the n-alcohol solvent. The intensity of diffraction peaks of MoSe2-E becomes stronger when the solvotherml temperature increased from 180°C to 250°C which indicates that the crystallinity becomes stronger as increasing the reaction temperature. The morphology and the structure of the as obtained MoSe2 nanoflowers were given by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. From an overall view (Fig. 2 a), the MoSe2 are uniform nanopheres in shape with average size distribution. The close-up view shows that the individual nanospheres are nanoflowers which possess a superstructure assembled by numerous ultrathin nanosheet with the thickness of about 5nm (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2(c–d) represents the influence of reaction time on the thickness and microstructure. Longer reaction time induces the aggregation of nanosheets into blocks. The influence of different reaction temperature is shown in Fig. 2(e–f). The products obtained at 120°C are spherical in shape and the nanosheet structure is not obvious. When the reaction temperature increases to 250°C, the MoSe2 samples are also nanoflowers assembled by numerous ultrathin nanosheet similar to that of 180°C, however, the size of the nanoflowers is about 1μm in diameter and the nanosheets becomes thicker than that of 180°C. Fig. 3 (a–d) represents the morphology of MoSe2 samples synthesized in different n-alcohol solvent. When the solvent was changed from ethanol to n-butanol, 1-hexanol or n-octanol, the products are also nanospheres in shape and the thickness of the thin nanosheet was further characterized by AFM. Fig. 4 (a–b) represents the TEM images of MoSe2 samples synthesized in ethanol solvent. The TEM images further confirm that these MoSe2 ultrathin nanosheets are assembled together to form 3D MoSe2 flowers with uniform diameters of 200nm. The thickness of the MoSe2 nanosheets was further characterized by AFM. From Fig. 5 (a–d), the thickness of ultrathin nanosheets is estimated to 6.5nm in ethanol, 5.4nm in n-butanol, 3.5nm in 1-hexanol, and 3.3nm in n-octanol, respectively. It can be seen that the thickness of MoSe2 nanosheets becomes thinner as the chains of the n-alcohol solvent increased. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy was further used to complement the characterization of the crystalline quality and the thickness of the MoSe2 nanosheets on a much larger length scale [4,29]. Fig. 6 a shows the Raman spectra for the MoSe2 nanosheets synthesized in different solvent. As reported by previous works, the most intense and identifiable peak for bulk MoSe2 is the out-of-plane A1g mode located at∼244cm−1 [4]. The A1g mode tends to shift from ∼243.5cm−1 to 240.5cm−1 as the number of layers decreases. The longer the chains of the solvent, the A1g mode is softened which is attributed to the decreased inter-planar restoring force (Fig. 6a). A sharp and intense PL peak at ∼760nm was observed (Fig. 6b) corresponding to a band gap of 1.63eV which in agreement with the reported 1.4–1.6eV for MoSe2 nanosheet [13]. The intensity of the peak decreases as the longer chains of the solvent which also indicates that the thickness of the nanosheets becomes thinner. The chemical compositions and chemical state of the element of MoSe2 nanospheres were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 7 ). The two peaks located at ∼231.6 and 228.5eV are corresponding to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of Mo (IV) state in MoSe2 which are similar to earlier reported positions for MoS2 and MoSe2-based systems [30]. The additional peaks with higher binding energies at 232.7 and 235.9eV are assigned to Mo (VI) in residual MoO3 [31]. The peak of Se around 54.0eV can be divided into Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 with peak positions at 54.5 and 55.0eV, respectively. The binding energies at 54.5eV and 55.0eV suggesting the −2 oxidation state of Se in the nanosheets [10]. The adsorption technology is an effective approach to remove organic pollutants from water [32,33]. From Fig. 8 (a), it can be seen that the removal efficiency of rhodamine B rapidly reached 99% within 5min for MoSe2 synthesized in ethanol and 90% for MoSe2 synthesized in butanol solvent. For samples synthesized in 1-hexanol, and n-octanol, the percentage of removal at the first 5min was only 32% and 5%, respectively. The completely adsorption process costs 45min for MoSe2-H and MoSe2-O. The effect of initial dye concentration on the adsorption capacity of the MoSe2 synthesized in ethanol was investigated under equilibrium conditions with a concentration of 0.75gL−1 of adsorbent (Fig. 8(b)). The adsorption capacity increased as the dye concentration increased. The maximum adsorption capability of Rhodamine B (RhB) on MoSe2 nanosheets reached 133mgg−1 in 5min. Activated carbons are widely used because of their relatively low cost, inert nature, and high surface area. Thus, for comparison, the adsorption capability of activated carbon was also investigated in this study. As shown in Fig. 8(c), MoSe2 nanosheets demonstrated much higher adsorption capacity than activated carbon in the first 5min. The maximum adsorption capability of Rhodamine B (RhB) on MoSe2 nanosheets reached 133mgg−1 in 5min, while the same adsorption capabilities on activated carbon need 20min. It suggests that the as-prepared MoSe2 nanosheets have good potential as an efficient adsorbent material for organic waste water treatment applications. As shown in Table 1 , the sample synthesis in different solvent have similar BET surface area around 35–38m2/g. To the best of our knowledge, the as-obtained MoSe2 nanosheets possess a higher surface area than previous reports. A high surface area induces high adsorption capacity for an adsorbent in water treatment because of more active adsorption sites available. Furthermore, layered MoSe2 or grapheme surface is π electron rich region, the π-π stacking interactions between aromatic compound of RhB and the surface of MoSe2 is also an important factor for the excellent adsorption capacity [4]. Static contact angle (CA) measurements were performed for further understanding the different adsorption capacity of MoSe2 synthesized in different solvents. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table 1, with the chains of n-alcohol solvent increased, the water CA increased which proved that the wettability becomes worse as the increasing of the chains of n-alcohol solvent. The adsorption capacity of MoSe2 synthesized in different solvent could be relate to their different hydrophilic property. The electrocatalytic HER activities of MoSe2 synthesized in different solvent were investigated in 0.5M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode setup. The polarization curves (Fig. 9 a) exhibited the onset overpotential of 130mV for MoSe2-E, beyond which the cathodic current rose rapidly under more negative potentials. The onset overpotential of MoSe2-B, MoSe2-H and MoSe2-O is 190mV, 190mV and 200mV, respectively. In contrast, pure bulk MoSe2 shows onset overpotential of around 200mV as reported by previous literatures [2]. At a same current density of 20mAcm−2, the MoSe2-E nanosheet needs an overpotential of 250mV while MoSe2-H requires a greater overpotential of 350mV. Three possible reaction steps have been suggested for the HER in acidic aqueous [34,35]. (1) Volmer step:H+ +e− +cat→Hads−cat+H2O (2) Heyrovsky step:Hads−cat+H+ +e− →H2 +H2O (3) Tafel step:Hads−cat+Hads−cat→H2 The Tafel slope is an inherent property of catalyst materials and indicates the rate-determining step in the whole HER process [10]. The Tafel slopes measured from these MoSe2-based samples are in the range of 71−99mVdec−1 which suggests that the rate-determining step on our MoSe2 catalysts may be the electrochemical desorption step (the Heyrovsky reaction) [36,37]. The MoSe2-E nanosheets show a small Tafel slope of 71mV per decade while bulk MoSe2 in the range of 120–190mV. A smaller Tafel slope is preferred as it means a faster increase of hydrogen generation rate with increasing overpotential applied. Besides of more active HER catalysis sites, the enhanced charge transfer kinetics also contribute to the improved HER electrocatalysis efficiency [37]. In order to further study this effect, Ac impedance measurement was carried out at an overpotential of 180mV (Fig. 9d). As the chains of the solvent increase, the diameter of semicircle decreases. The MoSe2-E nanosheets exhibited a much lower charge transfer impedance than other MoSe2 samples, indicating faster electrode kinetics during HER kinetics. To investigate the stability of our MoSe2-based catalysts during HER process, we carried out a long-term cycling test and continuous HER at a given overpotential. As an overpotential of 230mV was applied, after a period of 18,000s, the cathodic current density displays almost no degradation, as shown in Fig. 9c, suggesting the excellent stability of MoSe2-E toward HER. The results show that our MoSe2-based catalysts exhibit a good stability during a long-term HER process in an acidic solution. The relatively high crystallinity of MoSe2 synthesized in ethanol ensures the stability during long-term electrocatalysis. [38] MoSe2 synthesized in ethanol solvent exhibited the best HER performance than other samples which suggested that the HER efficiency was highly dependent on the crystallinity of the catalyst. Earlier studies have suggested that amorphous structure is favorable for HER due to the active unsaturated atoms, but the poor crystallinity leads to poor conductivity [39]. Both active sites and electric conductivity of catalysts are crucial factors to affect the electrocatalytic activity. Besides, the well surface hydrophilic property of MoSe2-E ensures the fast adsorption of proton onto the electrode surface during the catalytic process."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, the ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets with thickness of 3–6nm were synthesized by a facile solvent-thermal method with n-alcohol as solvent. The thickness of the MoSe2 nanosheets could be changed by changing the chains of n-alcohol solvent, the longer the chains of the n-alcohol solvent, the thinner the thickness of MoSe2 nanosheets. MoSe2 synthesized in ethanol exhibited the best adsorption capacity and HER performance. The excellent adsorption capacity of MoSe2-E could be attributed to the large specific surface area, well surface hydrophilic property and π-π stacking interactions between aromatic compound of RhB and the surface of MoSe2. The better HER performance of MoSe2-E was mainly due to its good crystallinity which could balance the active sites and conductivity. Furthermore, the well surface hydrophilic property and large specific area of MoSe2-E ensures the fast adsorption of proton onto the electrode surface during the catalytic process."
