0,Introduction,"During the last decade a large surplus of glycerol has been generated in manufacturing biodiesel fuel from vegetable oils since about 100kg of this chemical per ton of biodiesel are formed. According to recent estimates [1], worldwide production of glycerol could have reached 2 million tons in 2010 and will grow in coming years due to the increasing demand for biodiesel, as well as the emergence of other large-scale processes based on the conversion of cellulose and lignocelluloses in which glycerol is also a by-product [2]. Consequently, new applications for this polyol as a low-cost raw material need to be developed and/or the existing ones expanded [3]. Today, most efforts in this area are focusing on the development of procedures to convert glycerol into value-added chemicals, that have either been previously prepared from petrochemical sources or suffered from environmental problems during their preparation [1,3,4]. Glycerol reforming for hydrogen production [5], and its transformation into fuel additives [6], are also extremely active areas of research. Due to its unique combination of physical and chemical properties, such as polarity, low toxicity and flammability, high boiling point, ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and to dissolve both organic and inorganic compounds (salts, acids, bases and transition metal complexes), and easy availability, glycerol has recently emerged as an economically appealing and safe solvent for organic synthesis [7,8]. The growing interest of the chemical community in finding “green” solvents from renewable sources is also a prime motivation for the exponential growth of this research field [9]. In this context, works from Crotti's [10] and Wolfson's groups [11] have demonstrated that glycerol can act as solvent and hydrogen donor in metal-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) reactions. Note that, such a catalytic process, it is nowadays recognized as an efficient reduction method of unsaturated organic compounds (ketones, aldehydes, imines and olefins) when 2-propanol or formic acid/triethylamine mixtures are used as the hydrogen source [12–14]. In particular, using different homogeneous ruthenium(II) and iridium(I)-based catalysts, as well as palladium and ruthenium supported on carbon, the reduction of benzaldehyde, acetophenone and several unfunctionalized olefins was studied by Crotti and Wolfson in glycerol [10,11]. Although all the processes were operative in this alternative reaction medium, their efficiencies were in general low, leading to the desired reduced products only in modest yields or requiring remarkably high catalyst loadings to achieve good conversions. Consequently, the search for effective TH processes in glycerol is still challenging. Recently, we have disclosed an operationally simple and highly efficient procedure for the selective reduction of the CC bond of allylic alcohols in both organic (iPrOH) and aqueous media (NaO2CH/H2O) using readily accessible ruthenium catalysts [15]. The process, which proceeds in a one-pot manner and represents an illustrative example of auto-tandem catalysis via ruthenium-hydride intermediates [16], involves a sequence of two independent reactions: (i) the initial redox-isomerization of the allylic alcohol [17], and (ii) the subsequent transfer hydrogenation of the resulting carbonyl compound (Scheme 1 ) [18]. It is important to emphasize that this catalytic transformation is an appealing alternative to the classical hydrogenation reactions of allylic alcohols since it avoids the use of highly flammable H2(g) [19]. In line with our current interest in developing metal-catalyzed transformations in glycerol [7b,20], and inspired by the works of Crotti and Wolfson [10,11], we wondered on the suitability of this alternative reaction medium to perform the tandem isomerization/TH process depicted in Scheme 1. Thus, herein we describe our efforts in the search of an efficient catalytic system able to reduce the CC bond of allylic alcohols using glycerol as solvent and hydrogen donor."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification with the exception of compounds [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-arene)}2] (arene=C6H6 (1a), p-cymene (1b), mesitylene (1c), C6Me6 (1d)) [21], [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(PTA)] (arene=C6H6 (2a), p-cymene (2b), mesitylene (2c), C6Me6 (2d)) [22], [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(PTA-Bn)] (arene=C6H6 (3a), p-cymene (3b), mesitylene (3c), C6Me6 (3d)) [22d], [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(DAPTA)] (arene=C6H6 (4a), p-cymene (4b), mesitylene (4c), C6Me6 (4d)) [22d], [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(TPPMS)] (arene=C6H6 (5a), p-cymene (5b), mesitylene (5c), C6Me6 (5d)) [22b,d,23], (E)-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-ol [24], (E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-ol [24] and (E)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-propen-1-ol [24], which were prepared by following the methods reported in the literature. Pharmaceutical (99.5%) and technical (87%) grade glycerol were purchased from VWR International and used as received."
3,General procedure for the catalytic reduction of allylic alcohols under optimized reaction conditions,"2.2 General procedure for the catalytic reduction of allylic alcohols under optimized reaction conditions Under an inert atmosphere, the corresponding allylic alcohol (2mmol) and glycerol (20mL) were introduced into a Schlenk tube fitted with a condenser. Then, KOH (45mg, 0.8mmol) and [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a; 48mg, 0.1mmol; 5mol% of Ru) were added, and the resulting solution stirred at 100°C in an oil-bath for 6–15h. After this time, the solution was cooled to room temperature and extracted with diethyl ether (3×25mL). Note that, when pharmaceutical grade glycerol was used as solvent, the reaction crude was previously diluted with water (5mL) to reduce its viscosity and facilitate the extraction processes. The combined organic extracts were evaporated to dryness, controlled by 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine the conversion and yield of the process, and the saturated alcohol purified by column chromatography over silica-gel employing a mixture hexanes/Et2O (90:10) as eluent. The identity of the saturated alcohols was assessed by comparison of their 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature and by their fragmentation in GC/MSD."
4,Results and discussion,"The feasibility of the tandem isomerization/TH reactions of allylic alcohols in glycerol was evaluated employing the reduction of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol (cinnamyl alcohol) into 3-phenyl-1-propanol as model. Our initial efforts focused on the use of the readily accessible (η 6-arene)-ruthenium(II) dimers [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-arene)}2] (arene=C6H6 (1a), p-cymene (1b), mesitylene (1c), C6Me6 (1d)) as potential catalysts for this transformation (Fig. 1 ) [21]. In particular, our investigation began by running the reduction of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol with [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-p-cymene)}2] (1b). This metal source was chosen due to its proven ability to promote the TH of carbonyl compounds using glycerol as the solvent and hydrogen source [11], and its effectiveness in the redox isomerization of allylic alcohols in different reaction media [25]. Experiments were carried out at 100°C employing 2mmol of substrate, 2.5mol% of dimer 1b (5mol% of Ru), pharmaceutical grade glycerol (0.1M solutions of the allylic alcohol) and variable amounts of KOH as the base. The results obtained are collected in Table 1 . As expected, performing the catalytic reactions in the absence of KOH did not yield appreciable amounts of the saturated alcohol, even after 22h of heating (entry 1). Only the partial isomerization of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol into 3-phenyl-propionaldehyde was observed, thus confirming the need of a basic media for forming the active species for both steps of the tandem process, i.e. the [Ru]-H intermediates [12,17]. Introduction of KOH in the medium accelerates the transformation of the substrate into 3-phenyl-propionaldehyde and 3-phenyl-1-propanol (entries 2–11), the highest conversion and selectivity toward the desired 3-phenyl-1-propanol being reached in the presence of 80mol% of base (entry 9). Under these conditions, complete disappearance of the starting material was observed after 6h with formation of the saturated alcohol in 97% yield (determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy from the crude reaction mixture after extraction with Et2O). As shown in entries 10–11, increasing the amount of base to 90–100mol% resulted counterproductive, due probably to the partial decomposition of the active species under these strongly basic conditions. At this point we should note that a blank experiment, carried out with 80mol% of KOH in the absence of dimer 1b, ruled out the occurrence of a catalysis mediated solely by the base [26,27]. Thus, as shown in entry 12, only 11% of conversion was observed under these “metal-free” conditions, thus confirming the crucial role played by ruthenium in both steps of the tandem process. Using the optimal substrate/ruthenium/base ratio (100:5:80) different alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and tert-butoxides, as well as triethylamine, were screened as potential bases for this reaction (Table 2 ). Best results were obtained employing hydroxides and carbonates with the bulkier alkaline cations K+ and Cs+, which all led to 3-phenyl-1-propanol in excellent yield after 6h of heating (96–97% yield by 1H NMR spectroscopy; entries 3–4 and 7–8). Based on these results, inexpensive KOH (80mol%) was chosen as the base for the rest of our studies. In order to improve the efficiency of the process, some experiments were also performed at different concentrations of the substrate (from 0.05M to 1M), but no marked differences in activity and selectivity were observed. In contrast, remarkably poorer results were obtained lowering the reaction temperature (e.g. at 80°C only 30% of conversion of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol was observed after 6h of heating) or the ruthenium loadings (e.g. using 1mol% of 1b only 57% of conversion of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol was observed after 6h of heating). Finally, as shown in Table 3 , the use of the related arene–ruthenium(II) dimers [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-arene)}2] (arene=C6H6 (1a), mesitylene (1c), C6Me6 (1d)) neither allowed to improve the results obtained with [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-p-cymene)}2] (1b) (entries 1, 3 and 4 vs entry 2). With the aim of finding a more competitive alternative to dimer [{RuCl(μ-Cl)(η 6-p-cymene)}2] (1b), a series of mononuclear arene–ruthenium complexes [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(L)] (2-5a–d; Fig. 1), containing the hydrophilic phosphine ligands PTA, PTA-Bn, DAPTA and TPPMS [28], were also checked under the optimized conditions described above (i.e. 0.1M solutions of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol in pharmaceutical grade glycerol, a metal loading of 5mol%, 80mol% KOH as the base, and a working temperature of 100°C) [29]. Complexes 2-5a-d were chosen since the presence of the hydrophilic P-donor ligands confers them a higher solubility in glycerol with respect to the dimeric species 1a-d (5–23 vs 1–2mg/mL at room temperature). As shown in Table 4 , all these mononuclear complexes were found to be active catalysts providing 3-phenyl-1-propanol in good to excellent yields after 4–6h. Only in the case of complexes [RuCl2(η 6-arene)(PTA-Bn)] (3a–d) a remarkably lower reactivity compared to 1b was observed (entries 5–8), which could be explained by the presence of the coordinating chloride counteranion which slows the formation of active [Ru]-H intermediates. From this general catalyst screening, the benzene derivative [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a) emerged as the top choice due to its selectivity and efficiency (quantitative yield in the reduced alcohol after only 4h; entry 9). Interestingly, the catalytic activity of [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a) remained very high in the presence of only 40mol% of KOH. Thus, under these conditions almost quantitative formation of 3-phenyl-1-propanol was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (>99%) after 6h of heating at 100°C, allowing us to isolate this compound in pure form with an excellent 90% yield [30]. More importantly, the same reaction performed in technical grade glycerol (87% purity) resulted also in the quantitative formation of 3-phenyl-1-propanol after 6h. Since refining of crude glycerin into pharmaceutical grade glycerol is a highly energy-consuming process, the development of synthetic processes using lower grades of glycerol, such as the technical one, is undoubtedly much more appealing from an economic point of view [7,31]. On the other hand, to further define the scope of this catalytic transformation, other allylic alcohols were subjected to the combined action of [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a; 5mol%) and KOH (40mol%) (Table 5 ). Thus, as observed for (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol, related cinnamyl alcohols could be efficiently converted into the corresponding saturated alcohols within 6h regardless of the electronic nature of the aromatic ring (entries 1–3). Again, no remarkable differences in activity and selectivity were found when performing the catalytic reactions in pharmaceutical or technical grade glycerol. Complex 4a was also effective with aliphatic substrates, such as (E)-2-octen-1-ol (entry 4) and (E)-2-nonen-1-ol (entry 5), thus confirming the generality of this “tandem” reduction process. However, we must note that in these cases longer reaction times (15h) were required to attain similar conversions. Extraction of the crude reaction mixtures with Et2O, followed by chromatographic work-up provided analytically pure samples of the saturated alcohols (70–90% isolated yield), whose identity was assessed by comparison of their 1H and 13C{1H} NMR data with those previously described in the literature, and by their fragmentation in GC/MSD. For practical applications, the lifetime of a catalyst and its level of reusability are key factors [32]. In this sense, the recycling of complex [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a) was investigated using the reduction of (E)-3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol into 3-phenyl-1-propanol, in technical grade glycerol, as model reaction (Fig. 2 ). Thus, we have found that after simple extraction of the reduced alcohol with diethyl ether, the glycerolic phase containing 4a can be effectively reused in at least four consecutive runs. However, a progressive decrease of the activity was observed after each cycle, due to the partial decomposition of the catalyst (release of the C6H6 ligand was observed by GC after prolonged periods in solution at 100°C). At this point, we must note that the recycling of 4a in glycerol represents a significant advance with respect to our previous studies in water and 2-propanol using related homogeneous ruthenium complexes, where such a matter could not be successfully addressed [15]. In fact, the heterogeneous systems Ru(OH) x /Al2O3 and Ru(OH) x /TiO2, described by Mizuno and co-workers [18], are the only precedents of recyclable catalysts for these reduction processes of allylic alcohols."
5,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated that catalytic reduction of allylic alcohols by means of arene–ruthenium(II) complexes can be conveniently performed in both pharmaceutical and technical grade glycerol, which acts as solvent and hydrogen source in the process. Remarkably, the use of this inexpensive and green reaction medium also enables easy product separation and catalyst recycling. Overall, the results reported herein represents a new example of the utility of glycerol as solvent for synthetic organic chemistry [7,8], an emerging research field that has as main objective the revalorization of a waste generated by the biodiesel industry. Further studies aimed at broadening the scope of this transformation, as well as an evaluation of the applicability of complex [RuCl2(η 6-C6H6)(DAPTA)] (4a) in related TH processes from glycerol, are currently in progress in our lab and will be presented in due course."
