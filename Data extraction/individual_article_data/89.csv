0,Introduction,"At present, with the continuous consumption of fossil energy and increasingly serious ecological damage on a global scale, the development of renewable energy has been an urgent and important issue to solve these problems [1,2]. Biomass, as an eco-friendly renewable resource with enormous storage capacity, can be a good alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Therefore, exploring an efficient catalytic conversion of biomass and its platform compounds has attracted widespread attention in modern industry [3,4]. And a wide range of important biomass-derived chemicals, including furfural (FAL), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, glycerol, etc., are obtained in large quantities from agricultural waste resources (cellulose and hemicellulose) [5–8]. Among them, FAL derived from C5 or C6 sugars through well-established methods is considered to be one of the top 30 platform chemicals derived from biomass [9–12]. Degradation of FAL, the hydrogenation of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), can be utilized to produce various chemicals including synthetic fibers, resins, foundry binders, binders and other important platform molecules (Scheme 1 ) [13–16]. Traditionally, a harsh reaction condition (130−200 °C with 30 bar H2) is applied to the synthesis of FOL from the gas phase and liquid phase hydrogenation of FAL with a toxic copper-chromium catalyst [17–19]. Further, the catalyst is replaced by various transition metals (including Pt [20,21], Pd [22], Ir [23–25], Cu [26,27], Ni [28,29], etc.). However, the use of explosive H2 at high temperature or high pressure required the use of specialized equipment, and has potential safety issues [30]. Recently, as a substitute for the hydrogenation reaction, a catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction utilizing a H-donor (formic acid and alcohols) as a hydrogen source has been proposed [13,31–33]. Especially, the alcohols can provide both a hydrogen source and a solvent for the reaction. Several catalytic systems with different alcohols as the hydrogen source have been developed for the CTH reaction of FAL in the presence of various catalysts such as NiO [34], Zr-HAs, [35] ZrPN [36], Co-Ru/C [37], MgO [38], etc. In these catalytic systems, the conventional filtration method for separating heterogenous catalyst from solution is inconvenient to handle in industrial production, which allows the easily separated magnetic catalytic materials to enter our field of view [15,39–41]. And some wonderful works on the CTH reaction from FAL to FOL with magnetic materials as catalysts are listed as follows. Yang et al. found that magnetic ferrite nickel nanoparticles and a series of acid/base bifunctional magnetic Al–Zr@Fe mixed oxides can efficiently catalyze the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL with 90 % yield of FOL at 180 °C for 4 h [42,43]. Zhang et al. studied hydroxyapatite-encapsulated magnetic γ-Fe2O3 (γ-Fe2O3@HAP) as a magnetic base to promote the CTH reaction of FAL and obtained 91.7 % yield of FOL at 180 °C for 10 h [30]. Xu et al. synthesized a magnetic zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (MZCCP) catalyst capable of efficiently converting FAL to FOL at 140 °C for 2 h (98.2 % yield of FOL) [40]. In this study, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized and exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL with 2-propanol (2-PrOH) as hydrogen source and solvent under relatively mild reaction conditions (120−160 °C). And the smaller the Fe3O4 particles, the larger the BET surface area and the pore diameter, and the better the catalytic performance. Further, a scaled-up CTH experiment of FAL verified that the catalytic reaction system has the potential to large-scale production. Combined with a two-phase reaction system, FOL can be produced directly from xylose. In addition, reaction kinetics and a possible mechanism were also studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, methyl levulinate, γ-valerolactone, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, acetophenone, 1-phenylethanol, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamyl alcohol were purchased from TCI Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, NH4OH, ethylene glycol, benzoic acid, pyridine, NaCl, tetrahydrofuran (THF), AlCl3·6H2O and all solvents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Anhydrous sodium acetate, FeCl3·6H2O and FeSO4·7H2O were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Fe3O4 (200 nm) was purchased from Tianjin Huadong Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China). All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 12 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by the co-precipitation method. To do this, 2.22 g FeSO4·7H2O and 5.72 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were put into a three-necked bottle and dissolved with 160 mL deionized water by ultrasonication for 10 min. Then, the bottle was heated in a water bath and was stirred at 80 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere. Next, 10 mL of NH4OH (25 %) was quickly added to the solution and stirring was continued for 30 min. After reaction, the bottle was cooled to room temperature. Black precipitate was collected by a magnetic separation method and washed three times with water and alcohol, respectively. Finally, the sample was dried in vacuum at 60 °C and designated Fe3O4-12. 200 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-200) were synthesized by well-established hydrothermal method, referred to the relevant literature [44]. Briefly, 8 g anhydrous sodium acetate and 2.4 g FeCl3·6H2O were dissolved in 60 mL ethylene glycol with stirring for 30 min. Then the liquid was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was collected by a magnetic separation method, washed (ethanol/water), and dried in vacuum at 60 °C. In addition, 300 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-300) were commercially available."
4,CTH reaction and sample analysis,"2.3 CTH reaction and sample analysis CTH reaction of FAL to FOL was carried out without stirring in a 35 mL steel alloy autoclave (Fe-Cr-Ni alloy, GB1220-92). Typically, FAL (0.67 mmol), solvents (20 mL) and catalyst (0.1 g) are moved into the reactor, then sealed and heated to the target temperature (120−160 °C) for a certain reaction time (1−8 h). After the reaction, the autoclave was taken out and cooled to ambient temperature. In addition, a scaled-up CTH experiment of FAL was performed in 300 mL stainless steel autoclave (JULABO) with heating jacket (Fig. 7a). Typically, in a scale-up experiment, FAL (60 mmol), 2-PrOH (150 mL), and catalyst (1 g) were charged into the autoclave, then sealed and heated to 180 °C for 1−8 h. Identification of liquid products in the reaction mixture was achieved by the TRACE ISQ GC–MS (Thermo Scientific Co, TR–WAX–MS column 30.0 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm). The temperature program started at 60 °C for 1 min, then increased from 60 °C to 230 °C at a rate of 15 °C /min and held for 2 min."
5,A production process from xylose to FOL through the two-phase reaction and the CTH reaction,"2.4 A production process from xylose to FOL through the two-phase reaction and the CTH reaction The xylose-derived FOL was prepared by a two-step process. One step was the formation of FAL from xylose by a two-phase reaction. In detail, the reaction was carried on in a stainless steel autoclave (40 mL) heated in a temperature-controlled oil bath. The mixture of xylose (0.1 g), solvents (biphase: 15 mL 2-butyl alcohol (2-BuOH) as extract phase and 15 mL saturated NaCl solution as reaction phase) and AlCl3 (0.1 g) were put into the autoclave with a magnetic stirring bar, then sealed and heated to the target temperature (140 °C) for a certain reaction time (1−3 h). After reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The organic phase (extract phase) was separated and 2-BuOH in organic phase was removed by a rotary evaporator for reuse. The remaining liquid is high-purity furfural for subsequent reactions. In the inorganic phase (reaction phase), a certain amount of xylose and 15 mL of 2-BuOH were added to the phase to continue the reaction. The other step was to further convert the purified FAL to FOL through the CTH reaction with 2-PrOH as solvent, which is the same as the CTH reaction of pure FAL."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out via a Rigaku D/max-2550 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The wavelength of X-ray source was set at 0.154 nm, and the step width was 0.02° with a scanning speed of 4° per minute between two thetas of 5° and 80°. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed in a thermogravimetric analysis system (TG: PerkinElmer Instruments) under air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The magnetic property was assessed using a magnetic property measurement system (SQUID-VSM) with an applied force of −30 000 to 30 000 Oe at room temperature. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was measured on an Asap 2420 surface adsorption apparatus. NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) were conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II2920 automated chemisorption analyzer to assess the surface acidity and basicity of catalysts, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using ESCALAB250 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a charge neutralizer and an Mg Kα X-ray source. The morphology of the samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai F20) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Jeol JSM-6700 F). The elemental compositions of catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) on an Optima 3300 DV (PerkinElmer Instruments)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts XRD patterns of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with different particle sizes are shown in Fig. 1 a. For Fe3O4-12, Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300, the XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ = 18.2, 30.0, 35.2, 37.0, 43.0, 53.3, 56.9, 62.5, 65.7, 70.9, 73.9, 74.9 and 78.9°, are assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), (531), (620), (533), (622) and (444) planes of Fe3O4, respectively, which is consistent with JCPDS card 19−0629. Especially the commercial Fe3O4-300, its crystallinity is significantly higher than synthesized Fe3O4. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were further analysed by XPS spectrum (Fig. 1b), and the photoelectron peaks at 711 and 725 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 (without satellite peaks) and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, indicates the formation of Fe3O4 other than γ-Fe2O3 [41]. And then the two peaks at 711 and 725 eV split into four peaks, two of them at 710.3 and 723.4 eV ascribing to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 orbits of Fe2+, and the other two peaks at 711.6 and 724.9 eV corresponding to the Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 orbits of Fe3+ (Fig. S1a). Moreover, the peak area ratios of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in Fe3O4-12, Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300 are approximately 2.131, 2.138 and 2.117, respectively, which is very close to the stoichiometric ratio of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in Fe3O4. From Fig. S1b (XPS spectra of O 1s), the binding energies at around 530.4 and 532.5 eV are attributed to FeO bonds and CO bonds, respectively, which manifests that the O species in Fe3O4-12 are substantially coordinated with iron compared to Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300. Additionally, XPS spectra of C 1s are also displayed in Fig. S1c. The magnetic properties of Fe3O4-12, Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300 catalysts were assessed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at 300 K (Fig. 1c). From the magnetic hysteresis loops, it can be concluded that the saturation magnetizations (Ms) of Fe3O4-12, Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300 are 78, 90 and 85 emu g−1, respectively, indicating that these materials have high magnetic properties and facilitate separation of the catalyst from the catalysis system. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the Fe3O4 samples measured by the N2 physisorption (Fig. 1d) displays type IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loop, which is attributed to the irregular mesoporous structure between the nanoparticles. Further analysis of the sample (Table 1 ), BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of Fe3O4-12 (76.8 m2 g−1, 0.312 cm3 g−1 and 16.25 nm) are significantly greater than those of Fe3O4-200 (18.4 m2 g−1, 0.071 cm3 g−1 and 15.34 nm) and Fe3O4-300 (2.8 m2 g−1, 0.009 cm3 g−1 and 12.77 nm), indicated that the smaller the particle size, the larger the BET surface area, the pore volume and the pore size. To further confirm the morphologies and particle size distribution of the nanoparticles, the Fe3O4 samples were observed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2 ). From Figs. 2, the size distribution range of the three nanoparticles (Fe3O4-12, Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300) are 6−24 nm (12 nm at most), 80−280 nm (200 nm at most) and 190–430 nm (300 nm at most) respectively. Since acid-base sites of the catalysts play an important role in the CTH reaction of carbonyl compounds, [36,45] the acid-base properties of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were measured by NH3- and CO2-TPD (Fig. 3 a and b), and the detailed data are compiled in Table 1. The acid and base concentrations of Fe3O4-12 are 0.828 and 0.642 mmol g−1, respectively, which are evidently higher than those of Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300 (Table 1). From the NH3- / CO2-TPD profiles (Fig. 3), two broad desorption peaks appear at 50–150 ℃ and 300–500 ℃, representing the weak acid / weak base sites and strong acid / strong base sites of the catalysts, respectively. Therefore, compared with Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300, Fe3O4-12 has the strongest acid / base sites. Combined with BET analysis, it was concluded that the smaller the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the larger the BET surface area, pore volume and pore size, resulting in more acid-base active sites of the catalysts. Therefore, Fe3O4-12 should have the best catalytic activity in the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL."
9,CTH reaction of FAL to FOL over various Fe3O4 nanoparticles,"3.2 CTH reaction of FAL to FOL over various Fe3O4 nanoparticles In the blank experiment, no reaction occurred without catalyst at 160 °C for 5 h (Table 2 , entry 1). With Fe3O4-12 as catalyst, 97.5 % conversion of FAL and 90.1 % yield of FOL were obtained (Table 2, entry 2). The increase of the particle size of the catalyst to 200 nm (Fe3O4-200) reduced the catalytic activity (47.6 % conversion of FAL and 44.3 % yield of FOL, Table 2, entry 3). When the particle size was further increased to 300 nm (commercial Fe3O4-300), the yield and the conversion were dropped sharply (8.9 % conversion of FAL and 7.5 % yield of FOL, Table 2, entry 4). Similarly, the TOF value of FAL and the formation rate of FOL of Fe3O4-12 (1.21 mmol g−1 h−1 and 0.101 h−1) are also higher than those of Fe3O4-200 (0.59 mmol g−1 h−1 and 0.049 h−1) and Fe3O4-300 (0.10 mmol g−1 h−1 and 0.009 h−1). However, the selectivity of the reaction maintains at a high level with the three nanoparticles as catalysts. And a small amount of by-products, 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan and 4-(2-Furyl)-3-buten-2-one, were detected by GC–MS (Fig. S2). Combined with the characterization of BET, SEM, TEM and NH3- / CO2-TPD, it can be inferred that the smaller Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the more active sites (eg. acid-base sites) are exposed, resulting in better catalytic performance of the catalysts. Subsequently, in order to investigate the effect of the acid-base sites on the catalytic performance, pyridine and benzoic acid were separately added to the reaction system for poisoning of the acid-base sites of the catalysts without changing the reaction conditions (Table 2, entry 5 and 6). The results revealed that the catalytic activity was greatly reduced, which further confirmed that the CTH reaction was a catalytic reaction with a synergistic effect of acid-base sites. Experiments on the effect of catalyst dosage on the reaction (Table 2, entry 2,7 and 8) confirmed that 0.1 g was the preferred amount of catalyst with the best yield of FOL (90.1 %). However, as the amount of catalyst was reduced to 0.05 g, the formation rate of FOL (1.91 mmol g−1 h−1) and the TOF value of FAL (0.153 h−1) increased significantly, which may be attributed to an increase in the utilization of active sites per unit mass of catalyst."
10,Effect of reaction temperature and time on the catalytic performance of Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles and reaction kinetics study,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature and time on the catalytic performance of Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles and reaction kinetics study The reaction temperature and time have a remarkable effect on the activity of the reaction. Thus, the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL was carried out at different reaction temperatures, ranging from 120 to 160 °C, within a certain period of time (from 1 h to 8 h) (Fig. 4 a). It is well known that increasing the temperature accelerates the yield of FOL and the conversion of FAL. In detail, at 120 °C, the conversion of FAL and the yield of FOL increased with increasing reaction time, reaching 70.9 % and 65.5 % at 8 h, respectively. Increasing the temperature to 140 °C, it takes only 4 h to achieve similar conversion of FAL and the yield of FOL at 120 °C for 8 h, and the conversion of FAL and the yield of FOL are 94.1 % and 88.3 % at 8 h, respectively. When the temperature goes up to 160 °C, the conversion of FAL quickly reached 100 % and remains constant, while the yield of FOL decreased to 85.4 % at 8 h after reaching a maximum of 90.1 % at 5 h, since the generated FOL was further etherified to 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan with 2-PrOH. Therefore, 160 °C and 5 h are the optimal reaction conditions for the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL over Fe3O4-12. In order to provide more detailed information about the reaction, the kinetics of the reaction were calculated at three temperatures of 120, 140 and 160 °C. In the catalytic system, since the amount of the catalyst is constant with an excess of 2-PrOH, we assume that the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL is a first-order reaction as a function of FAL concentration. From Fig. 4b, the experimental results reveal a linear relationship between ln(C0/Ct) and reaction time, and the relevant reaction rate constants (k) are calculated at each temperature (120, 140 and 160 °C) from the corresponding slope of the plots, which corresponds to 0.1324, 0.2669, and 0.5320 h−1, respectively. Based on the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy (Ea) is calculated to be 49.16 kJ mol−1 over the Fe3O4-12 for the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL with 2-PrOH as the hydrogen source, which is close to or below the reported Ea value for the reaction with other catalysts. [43,45,46] The lower activation energy is attributed to smaller particle sizes, larger pore volumes, higher BET surface area and more acid-base sites."
11,Influence of different hydrogen donor,"3.4 Influence of different hydrogen donor Catalytic performance of Fe3O4-12 with different alcohol sources was summarized in Fig. 5 . With primary alcohols as the hydrogen source, the acetalization reaction dominates the competition with the CTH reaction of FAL, and especially when methanol was used as a hydrogen source. As the carbon chain grows, the hydrogen supply capacity increases, from methanol to ethanol to n-propanol, and finally to n-butanol, the yield of acetal products gradually decreases, and the yields of the corresponding four products (furfural dimethyl acetal, furfural diethyl acetal, furfural dipropyl acetal and furfural dibutyl acetal) are 80.8 %, 41.2 %, 40.6 % and 32.9 %, respectively. The reason is explained according to the reaction mechanism. The elimination of β-hydride is difficult to occur after the alcohol formed an alkoxy species on the surface of Fe3O4, resulting in the primary alcohols being poor H-donors in the CTH reaction. Similarly, tertiary alcohols are also weak H-donors and fail to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds because no hydrogen is close to the hydroxyl group [33,47,48]. Therefore, primary and tertiary alcohols are not suitable as hydrogen sources for the reaction. Instead, the high conversion of FAL and the high yield of FOL occur in a reaction with secondary alcohols as a hydrogen source, which indicates that the dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohols is easier than those of the primary and tertiary alcohols. Therefore, 2-PrOH, represented as secondary alcohols, is used as a suitable hydrogen source and a reaction solvent for the reaction."
12,Reusability and heterogeneity of the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles,"3.5 Reusability and heterogeneity of the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles Reusability and heterogeneity of the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles were carried out to evaluate its practical application. After completion of each cycle (Fig. 6 a), the magnetic Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles, separated from the reaction system by magnet, were washed twice with water and ethanol, and vacuum-dried for reuse. The catalyst exhibited almost constant performance after five consecutive cycles, with the yield of FOL slightly decreasing from 90.1 %–87.8 %. And no iron ions were detected in the solution after the reaction by ICP analysis, confirming that the catalyst has good stability under the reaction conditions. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles in the catalytic progress was tested by removing the catalyst from the mixed system after 2 h at 160 °C and maintaining the autoclave in the oven for a further period of time (1−3 h) without the catalyst (Fig. 6b). The yield of FOL did not continue to increase and no other reactions occurred, stating that no active sites entered the liquid and the catalyst was heterogeneous. Subsequently, the removed Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles were re-added to the catalyst-free system and maintaining the autoclave in the oven for a further period of time (1−3 h). Eventually, the yield of FOL continued to increase and reached 89.4 % after 3 h. The result further supports the above conclusion (ie: heterogeneity of the catalyst). The stability of Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles is also exposed by XRD, BET, VSM, TG, SEM and TEM. The XRD diffraction peaks and the saturation magnetization of the catalyst after 5 cycles are almost consistent with those of the fresh catalyst, indicating that the structure and magnetic properties of the catalyst do not change before and after the reaction (Figs. S3a and S3b). From the BET analysis (Figs. S3c), the same N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the catalyst before and after the reaction revealed no change in the pore structure of the catalyst, and the BET surface area decreased slightly from 76.8 m2 g−1 to 58.9 m2 g−1, which may be caused by carbon accumulation. From the TG analysis (Fig. S3d), the fact that less carbon accumulation on the catalysts was evidenced by the similar weight loss of the spent catalyst with the fresh catalyst. Images of SEM and TEM (Figs. S3e and S3f) reveal that the particle size of the catalyst did not agglomerate after five cycles. In summary, the catalyst is stable."
13,CTH reaction of other carbonyl compounds and a scaled-up CTH reaction of FAL over the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles,"3.6 CTH reaction of other carbonyl compounds and a scaled-up CTH reaction of FAL over the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles In order to examine the universality of the catalyst, the CTH reaction of other carbonyl compounds with 2-PrOH was attempted at 160−180 °C. From the Table 3 , the catalyst had good catalytic activity for the examined compounds. Particularly for FAL, cyclohexanone and methyl levulinate, the yields of their target products were all above 80 %. Therefore, Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles have a good feasibility for the CTH reaction of different carbonyl compounds. Combined with its simple, economical and easy to separate features, the catalyst has excellent application prospects. In order to assess the industrial application potential of the catalyst for CTH reaction of FAL to FOL, a scaled-up experiment of FAL (close to 100 times magnification) was performed with 60 mmol of FAL as substrate (Fig. 7 ). From Fig. 7 b and 7 c, the yield of FOL still remained above 90 % at 180 °C for 7 h and the catalytic activity of catalyst did not decrease significantly after five cycles. After the reaction, the reaction solution was subjected to rotary distillation to obtain pure FOL (Fig. S4). Accordingly, the Fe3O4-12 catalyst has potential for large-scale production of FOL from FAL."
14,A production process from xylose to FOL through the two-phase reaction and the CTH reaction,"3.7 A production process from xylose to FOL through the two-phase reaction and the CTH reaction The upstream feedstock of FAL is xylose derived from corncob (see the supplementary materials for details). In order to verify the industrial production feasibility of biomass conversion, xylose is served as a raw material to produce FOL through two steps of two-phase reaction system (dehydration) and CTH reaction (hydrogenation). First, a two-phase reaction system was established to synthesize FAL from xylose (Fig. 8 ). After the reaction, an optimum yield of 67.8 % FAL is acquired from organic phase at 140 °C for 2.5 h (Fig. 8a). Further, the solvent in the organic phase was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain FAL (containing an small amount of water, 2-BuOH, NaCl, by-products, etc.), and the distilled solvent (2-BuOH) and the saturated NaCl solution with catalyst (AlCl3) are returned to sample mixer to continue to produce FAL as the extract phase and the reaction phase, respectively (Fig. 8c). After two-phase system cycle test (Fig. 8b), the accumulation of FAL in the recycled organic phase caused by the formation of an azeotrope of FAL with the solvent (2-BuOH) during the steaming process resulted in an increase in the yield of FAL from 67.8 %–99.5 % after five cycles. Although humin and FAL changed the organic and inorganic phases to pale yellow, they did not affect the system. Finally, the above-mentioned unpurified FAL derived from xylose was used as a raw material for the subsequent CTH reaction, and a yield of 86.7 % FOL was obtained at 160 °C for 5 h. The above experimental results elucidate that the intention to produce FOL from xylose using a two-phase system and a CTH reaction is feasible. And a simple process flow chart from xylose to FOL is designed (Fig. 8c). First, the reaction raw material is mixed into the sample mixer (4) and injected into a two-phase reactor (6). After the reaction, the organic phase enters one fractionation tower (7), and the inorganic phase is returned to the reactor 4 for reuse. Next, after passing through the fractionation tower, the solvent (2-BuOH) is reinjected into the mixer 4 for reuse, and the purified FAL is introduced into the CTH reactor (9) and undergoes the CTH reaction with Fe3O4 and 2-PrOH (8) to form FOL. Finally, the catalyst is fixed by a magnet (10) after the reaction, and the liquid is transferred into the other fractionation tower (11) to separate the product FOL from the solvent (2-PrOH) which is returned to apparatus 8 for reuse."
15,Mechanism analysis,"3.8 Mechanism analysis Based on the above results and relevant literature [31,49], a possible mechanism was proposed, assuming that the hydrogenation of the FAL undergoes a six-membered ring coordination process. Detailed picture in Scheme 2 , first, 2-PrOH was adsorbed on the surface of Fe3O4, and formed an alkoxide by interacting with the acid (Fe2+ or Fe3+) and base sites (O2−) of Fe3O4. Meanwhile, C = O of FAL was also adsorbed and activated by the acid-base sites. Further, hydrogen transfer took place between the dissociated alkoxide and the activated FAL via a concerted process involving a six-link intermediate to form FOL and acetone. Finally, the FOL and acetone were obtained. In addition, the by-product 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan was the etherification product of FOL and 2-PrOH under the action of acid sites [50]. Another by-product, 4-(2-Furyl)-3-buten-2-one, was the aldol condensation product of FAL with acetone under the action of base sites [51,52]. It is well known that magnetic catalysts have the advantage of being easily separated from the reaction system, including simple magnetic materials having active sites themselves and composite magnetic materials covered with active sites on magnetic materials. From the Table 4 [26–30], the magnetic catalysts have high catalytic activity for CTH reaction of FAL, especially for composite magnetic materials. However, the preparation process of composite magnetic materials is complicated and costly compared to a simple magnetic material. Therefore, the facile, low-cost and green preparation method together with high catalytic performance render the Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles a promising substitute of magnetic catalysts for the CTH reaction."
16,Conclusions,"Magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as easily separable catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the CTH reaction of FAL to FOL with 2-propanol (2-PrOH) as hydrogen source under mild reaction conditions. Comparing Fe3O4 nanoparticles with different particle sizes, the minimum Fe3O4-12 catalyst had the best catalytic performance, and the yield of FOL reached 90.1 % with 97.5 % conversion of FAL at 160 °C for 5 h. Combined with the characterization of BET, SEM, TEM, NH3- and CO2-TPD, it can be inferred that the catalytic performance of Fe3O4-12 nanoparticles is better than that of Fe3O4-200 and Fe3O4-300 nanoparticles, which is also related to the relatively low activation energy (49.16 kJ mol−1). Moreover, a scaled-up CTH experiment of FAL and a production process from xylose to FOL manifested that the catalytic system has the potential for large-scale production. The simple, low-cost and high-efficiency catalyst in this work is a potentially attractive catalyst for conversion reaction from xylose to FOL."
