0,Introduction,"Triggered by the global problem of energy production, increasing attention has been paid to the creation of new ways to generate energy vectors of industrial interest efficiently as well as respectfully with the environment [1]. In this context, photocatalysis may play a significant role in generating fuels. This is particularly the case of hydrogen photoproduction as a clean fuel for the future [2–7]. Nowadays, hydrogen is broadly used in the industry, but its green generation and usage as a clean fuel in chemical reactions, fuel cells and transportation cars would be foreseen as a key technological field to allow a sustainable future [8,9]. All photocatalytic processes use light to generate charge carrier species. However, the usage of such carrier species in chemical reactions needs to avoid the recombination taking place between electron and hole related species. Overall, a photocatalyst needs to harvest light efficiently, the charge carrier species generated need to be separated and transported to the surface. Finally, it produces redox (both oxidation and reduction steps) reactions at the surface of the photocatalyst. The efficiency of the photochemical process is a combination of thermodynamics and relevant kinetic parameters [4,10,11]. Titania (TiO2) is the photocatalytic material by excellence due to its low cost, low toxicity and high biocompatibility, high availability, and versatility in all oxidation and reduction reaction process, particularly in hydrogen production [2–7,12]. Doping of titania by cations such as Nb or Sb has been shown to produce highly active systems in this reaction [13–16]. On the other hand, alcohols from bio-sources are interesting reactant molecules for hydrogen production in the quest to set up a carbon neutral and thus environmentally benign process. Alcohols having at least one hydrogen atom bonded to the (carbon) alpha position have been shown to provide high reaction rates [17–26]. Among such bio-derived alcohols, methanol is the most frequent alcohol tested in the literature [27–32]. In the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, the Pt/TiO2 system has become the main reference material [2,5,10,33–35]. Platinum is the most studied noble metal co-catalysts of titania-based powders due to its high effectiveness. The outstanding functional properties obtained in the presence of the noble metal are based in a significant number of physicochemical aspects, but those usually considered most critical would be; i) the high work function (the higher among noble metals) favoring the electron transfer from semiconductors; ii) the facility for multielectron capture and redox processes, and iii) and efficient capture of protons and subsequent formation of the hydrogen molecule due to the low energy for proton reduction [22,24,28–30,36–50]. Despite the important activity shown by the Pt/TiO2 system in the photoproduction of hydrogen using aqueous solutions of bio-alcohols, the literature actively seeks for better catalysts. The combination of titania promoting by Zr-doping and Pt surface deposition is, to our knowledge, unexplored in the context of hydrogen photoproduction. Nevertheless, Zr promotes photoactivity of titania-based catalysts in other reactions related to the degradation of several (dyes, volatile organic compounds, emergent contaminants, etc.) organic compounds [51–57]. In these contributions the isoelectronic substitution of Ti by Zr in titania oxides appears to occur with relatively minor structural distorting effects at the structure but with modification of the surface properties. These properties seem to promote significantly the activity of the titania based photocatalysts. Thus we will test here the Zr-doped Pt/TiO2 photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production through the aqueous phase reforming of methanol. As mentioned, the doping of titania showed effective for hydrogen photoproduction using other cations [13–16,32]. To confirm, the improvement of photocatalytic performance associated with the doping process of titania, activity is quantitatively assessed here following the IUPAC guidelines. This leads to the calculation of the quantum efficiency, a typical two steps procedure considering; i) the measurement of the optical properties of the catalyst suspension at the liquid reaction medium, and ii) the modeling of the light-matter interaction at the reactor where catalytic measurements are carried out [58]. Moreover, here we measured the activity of the materials in a broad range of experimental conditions considering the most critical variables. These variables are, according to the literature, i.e. the water:methanol ratio, the catalyst concentration and light intensity [6,10–12,14,28]. In addition, we use UV and visible illumination conditions in order to check the suitability of the materials for using sunlight. The combination of a bio-derived reactant (methanol) and the use of sunlight as the energy source of the process will lead to a genuinely green, environmentally benign process. The study is completed with a multitechnique analysis of the physico-chemical properties if the solids. Moreover, we carried out an in-situ analysis of the catalyst response to the reactant mixture using infrared and combined the result with an analysis of the charge carrier fate using photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance. The joint result from the classical and in-situ characterization indicates that Zr doping is among the most effective ways to promote Pt-TiO2 activity for hydrogen photoproduction using sunlight as the energy source of the reaction. Thus this system would be a step forward to pave the way to obtain technologically relevant catalysts for hydrogen photo-production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation and chemical composition of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation and chemical composition of catalysts Catalysts preparation was carried out using a water in oil microemulsion method. Titanium tetra-isopropoxide was added in an inverse emulsion containing an aqueous solution of hydrated zirconium (IV) oxynitrate (Sigma Aldrich) or just water (for the reference material) dispersed in n-heptane as organic media, using Triton X-100 (Aldrich) as surfactant and hexanol as cosurfactant. Water/M (M = Ti or Ti + Zr) and water/surfactant molar ratios were, respectively, 110 and 18 for all samples. The mixture was stirred for 24 h, centrifuged, decanted and rinsed with methanol. Then, the solid was dried at 110 °C for 12 h. After drying, the solid were calcined using a heating ramp (1 °C min−1) up to 450 °C, maintaining this temperature for 2 h. The co-catalysts were introduced by a deposition method using a H2PtCl6 (Aldrich) in solution. First, the powder material was suspended by stirring in a deionized water solution for 30 min. After that, the proper quantity of H2PtCl6 was added to the solution and kept on stirring along 5 min more. Based on previous studies, Pt loading was adjusted to get throughout the series a constant 0.4 mol. % -1 wt%- of Pt on metal basis [13,15]. The reduction was carried out using a NaBH4 (Aldrich) aqueous solution (M/NaBH4 molar ratio 1/5). The final solid was profusely rinsed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 0C. Samples were named T for the Pt/TiO2 reference and T-xZ for the doped samples. The x letter corresponds to the Zr molar percent."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Chemical analysis of the solids was performed using atomic emission with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES) with an Optima 3300DV Perkin Elmer spectrometer. XRD profiles of the samples were obtained using a Policristal X́Pert Pro PANalytical diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a 0.02° step. The particle sizes and strain were estimated using XRD using the Williamson–Hall formalism [59]. The BET surface areas were measured by nitrogen physisorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Shimadzu UV2100 apparatus using Teflon as a reference, and the results presented as Kubelka-Munk transform [60]. Photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer LS50B). Scanning transmission microscopy (SEM) studies were carried out in a JSM 6335F microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (HTEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectra (XEDS) were recorded on a JEOL 2100F TEM/STEM microscope. Particle size distributions of the noble metal were obtained, counting more than 150 particles in all cases. XPS data were recorded on 4 × 4 mm2 pellets, 0.5 mm thick, prepared by slightly pressing the powered materials which were outgassed in the prechamber of the instrument at room temperature up to a pressure <2 × 10−8 Torr remove chemisorbed water from their surfaces. The SPECS spectrometer main chamber, working at a pressure <10−9 Torr, was equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 multichannel hemispherical electron analyzer with a dual X-ray source working with Ag Kα (hν = 1486.2 eV) at 120 W, 20 mA using C 1s as energy reference for adventitious carbon (284.6 eV). Surface chemical compositions were estimated from XP-spectra, by calculating the integral of each peak after subtraction of the “S-shaped” Shirley-type background [61] using the appropriate experimental sensitivity factors and the CASA-XPS (version 2.3.15) software. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed with a Bruker ER200D spectrometer operating in the X-band. The sample suspensions (0.5 mg mL−1) were prepared in redistilled water (Milli Q) or methanol (HPLC grade, Scharlab) and sonicated for 4 min before the experiment. The 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as spin trapping agent. The solutions of DMPO (0.01 M) were prepared in specific solvents (water or methanol) and kept on ice during the whole set of experiments. 100 μL of the solid suspension and 100 μL of the corresponding DMPO solution (in water or methanol) were mixed into an EPR flat quartz cell under atmospheric air. Then the cell containing the experimental mixture (sample/DMPO/water or sample/DMPO/methanol) was irradiated at different times (from 0.5 to 10 min.) with the identical light excitation source to that employed for the photoreactor, being then immediately transferred to the spectrometer cavity for EPR analysis [62]. In some cases, small radical concentration decay (below 3% on average) was observed in the dark during the course of spectrum recording. Typical EPR spectrometer settings in a standard experiment were: ca. 9.75 GHz microwave frequency, 19.5 mW microwave power, 100 kHz modulation frequency, 1 G modulation amplitude and 2 × 105 spectrometer gain. All spectra were obtained at room temperature. No significant signal saturation was observed in those conditions. Blank experiments (without sample) were also performed to check the absence of radical formation in DMPO solutions (water or methanol) under irradiation and in the absence of solid. The g-values (±0.0001) were determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH, Sigma-Aldrich) as the internal standard. The EPR spectra were recorded and analyzed using the Bruker software WinEPR. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectra (DRIFTS) were taken in a Bruker Vertex 80 FTIR spectrometer using a MCT detector and running under OPUS/IR software. The set-up consists of a praying mantis DRIFTS accessory (Harrick Scientific) and a reaction cell (HVC, Harrick Scientific). The reaction mixture was prepared by injecting 3000 ppm of methanol (≥99%; Aldrich) into a wet (3:7 methanol, MeOH, to water ratio) N2 flow before entering the DRIFTS cell. Higher quantities of methanol provide a strong gas-phase IR signal, which does not allow to obtain any information of the surface species. The DRIFTS spectra were collected in the range of 4000–600 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1, by averaging 10 scans over a total of 1.2 s. In DRIFTS experiments, in-situ light excitation was carried out using 365 nm (20 nm half-width) radiation. Each sample, without any previous treatment, was subjected in a continuous mode (without modifying gas mixture) to a single, multi-step experiment which aims to test: i) the adsorption of the reactive mixture under dark conditions, ii) the reaction mixture evolution under illumination conditions, and iii) the subsequent stay at dark conditions. Spectra were taken after different exposure times to verify any evolution behavior."
4,Description of the catalytic measurements and observables,"2.3 Description of the catalytic measurements and observables Photocatalytic measurements at the liquid medium were carried out using a batch pyrex (cutting absorption edge at ca. 300 nm) reactor as depicted in Fig. S1 of the supporting information section. The reactor contains a x:y (x:y going from 3:7 to 7:3 v/v) CH3OH/H2O mixture medium maintained at a constant temperature (20 ± 1 °C). The catalyst suspension (full details at the Supporting information section) was first degassed with an Ar stream for around 15 min. Subsequently, the Ar flow was settled down to 10 mL min−1 and stabilized before reaction. Ar is used as a carrier to displace reaction gases from the reactor to the detection system. The solution inside of the reactor was irradiated using a Hg-Xe lamp (500 W) and dichroic filters (LOT Quantum Design), allowing exposure of the catalysis to the UV (280–400 nm) or Visible (420–680 nm) wavelength range. The kinetic analysis of the catalytic response to experimental variables was carried out through a Box-Benhken factorial design [63]. As justified in the introduction section, three factors (water:methanol ratio, catalyst content at the reaction medium and illumination level) at three levels were used, as detailed in the Supporting information (Table S1). The reaction rates for hydrogen production were evaluated at 3 h from the start of the irradiation, where a pseudo-stationary situation is reached. The hydrogen rate was analyzed using an on-line Mass spectrometry (Onmistart 300). Pareto Charts were used to assess statistically significant effects of the three factors mentioned on hydrogen photoproduction [64]. Pareto charts of standardized effects and main effects are powerful visualization tools that summarize the results of the factorial design carried out. They indicate the statistically significant parameters as those that are above the established threshold. To model the catalytic response of the solids, we utilized linear, quadratic and crossed terms between the three factors studied. For a parameter to be statistically significant, the null hypothesis of the parameter’s coefficient, being equal to zero is tested by comparing the calculated ANOVA p-value with a significance test level here set at α = 0.05 (95% of probability). If the p-value is less than α, the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero is rejected and deemed to be statistically significant. The length of the plotted bar indicates the weight of the parameters. Quantum efficiency is defined, according to the IUPAC recommendation [58], as the ratio of the number of molecules reacting by the number of photon interacting with the sample (Equation (1)). (1) η q ( % ) = 100 × 2 × r ( m o l m - 3 s - 1 ) < e a > ( E i n s t e i n m - 3 s - 1 ) This equation takes into account that the transfer of two electrons are required to reduce two protons and thus to produce one H2 molecule. The reaction rate of hydrogen production (r in equation (1)) is measured in the liquid phase reactors, as detailed in the previous subsection. To determine the denominator, we obtain the solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the heterogeneous reactor [65]. As detailed in the Supporting information section, this renders the so-called local volumetric rate of photon absorption; e a . In equation (1) we used the volume average values of the e a observable parameter. The RTE (equation (2)) measures the variation of intensity (associated to a beam of x-rays at wavelength λ in the direction of a solid angle vector , Ω _ ) through a direction of the space (s). (2) d I λ , Ω _ ( x _ ) ds = - κ λ I λ , Ω _ x _ - σ λ I λ , Ω _ x _ + σ λ 4 π ∫ Ω ' = 4 π p Ω _ ' → Ω _ I λ , Ω _ ' d Ω _ where κ λ is the absorption coefficient; σ λ is the dispersion coefficient; and p Ω _ ' → Ω _ is the scattering phase measured with the Henyey and Greenstein phase function, as usually carried out for titania samples [66]. The optical properties of the materials under study are presented in Fig. S3 of the Supporting information section. These equations assume; (i) the emission radiation is negligible (at room temperature), and (ii) steady state condition during the photocatalytic processes. A summary of the mathematical procedure to calculate the denominator of equation (1) is presented in the Supporting information section. In order to study photo-activity, this work combines the measurement of the optical properties of the solids already mentioned with the production of radical species (measured using EPR). The combination provides a formalism to obtain an intrinsic (free of light dependence) analysis of the kinetically-relevant radical formation rates and their role in controlling the reaction rate. The procedure is presented in the Supporting information section."
5,Results and discussion,"The catalytic response of three selected solids to the 15 experiments corresponding to the Box-Benhken factorial design is presented in Fig. 1 . A simple plot presenting the response of all materials to the central point of the factorial design is presented in Fig. S5 of the Supporting information section. At the experimental conditions of the central point, we observed that the T-2.5Z sample displays an improved activity regarding the parent T reference, presenting rates 2.7 and 2.5 times under UV and visible illumination conditions, respectively. The catalysts included in Fig. 1 are selected to illustrate the Zr effect on activity and are: the T (Pt/TiO2) reference, the doped sample presenting maximum activity (T-2.5Z), and the one having the maximum Zr content and displaying a relatively low activity (T-5Z). The surface response of the T reference sample differs qualitatively from the T-xZ samples. In spite of it, maximum rates for all samples are here obtained for methanol:water ratios around 50:50, as previously observed for many titania-based samples [13,14,67,68], and catalyst concentration roughly around 0.35–0.45 g L-1. We also note the sharp decrease of the activity observed for the low and high water content of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1). For the T-2.5Z sample, the activity in pure water and methanol is ca. 26/12 times lower than the maxima above mentioned. To analyze in more detail the sensitivity of the functional response of the materials to the experimental variables (methanol:water ratio, catalyst concentration and light illumination), we used the Pareto plots displayed in Fig. S6. For the T reference, we can note that the three experimental variables notably affect activity, although the methanol to water ratio scores the lower value. For the Zr-containing references, the activity is not sensible to the methanol:water ratio as a more flat response is observed in the range studied (3:7 to 7:3). This does not mean that a flat behavior is detected outside this range. For a 1:9 ratio (result not included in the statistical analysis that concentrates in the region of maximum activity) we observed a decay of 30–40% from the corresponding 3:7 result. This is in line with previous reports [13,14,32]. The Pareto plots also provide evidence that crossing terms and, more importantly, quadratic terms of the relevant variables are significant for the T sample indicating complex kinetics. However, Zr presence appears to simplify the dependence as only one crossed and quadratic term(s) are statistically significant. The discussion highlights that Zr affects photoactivity in a general way, i.e. similarly for all doped samples, changing the reaction rate dependence of the experimental design variables to a significant degree with respect to the T sample. It additionally affects the maximum activity value(s) under all illumination conditions tested, as illustrated in Fig. 1. On the other hand, we can note that Zr-doping allows obtaining a rather stable catalyst under reaction conditions. Fig. S7 shows that the T-2.5Z system has an essentially constant behavior over four consecutive cycles for a total of ca. 85 h of operation. A better, quantitative estimation of photoactivity is achieved here following the IUPAC rules [58] and using the quantum efficiency parameter. Fig. 2 presents quantum efficiency values for all samples under UV and visible illumination conditions. A marked maximum is observed for the T-2.5Z sample under UV illumination while a broader maximum, located in the region in the 1–2.5 mol. % of Zr, is detected under visible illumination. The optimum performance under all illumination conditions is therefore achieved with the T-2.5Z sample, displaying quantum efficiency values of ca. 8.5 and 4.2% for, respectively, UV and visible illumination conditions. Considering an AM 1.5 solar standard, the use of the (so-called true) quantum efficiency allows us to calculate the profit of sunlight achievable with our optimum sample, T-2.5Z. This is not possible using conversion, reaction rates or even apparent quantum efficiency. The mentioned sample (T-2.5Z) reaches a value of 4.6%. This value exceeds by far the ones previously reported for Pt (and other noble metal like Pd and Ru) promoted (doped or not) titania and carbon nitride based materials, which were in the 1.1–3.5% interval [13–15,32,69–71]. From Fig. 2 we can also note that the optimum Zr quantity increases the quantum efficiency value(s) of the T reference by ca. 2.9 times both under UV and visible light illumination. This 2.9 times increase, the stability at long time on stream conditions as well as the outstanding activity under sunlight indicates the significant effect exerted by the Zr incorporation into the Pt/TiO2 reference catalyst formulation. This doping process ends up in a material presenting the best performance reported in the literature to date, able to provide maximum profit from solar light and transform such energy in a fuel of industrial interest. To interpret the activity, we carried out a complete physico-chemical analysis of the catalysts. Structural characterization was initially performed using XRD and Raman spectroscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , XRD patterns are dominated by the anatase polymorph of titania (PDF 21-1272; space group I41/amd). Similarly, the Raman spectrum is dominated by the anatase phase [72], displaying peaks at ca. 143, 395, 515 and 636 cm−1 (Fig. 4 ). Both techniques do not show any signal attributable to the presence of Zr (single or mixed such as ZrTiO4) oxides and/or isolated surface species [51,53,73]. The inclusion of Zr into the anatase structure takes place with relatively minimum disturbance of the anatase network, as previously observed by others for Zr doping levels up to ca. 5 mol. % [53,74]. This is further confirmed below using XPS. From XRD patterns, the primary particle size of the samples was estimated. As summarized in Table 1 , the T reference presented a primary particle size of 11.3 nm. Doped samples display similar primary particle size values in the 11.2 to 12.1 nm range. The similitude in primary particle size is somewhat general considering morphological parameters. All materials are high surface BET area powders. However, Table 1 shows a trend in the surface area and pore volume observables. As higher the Zr content as lower the value of these two physico-chemical parameters. Due to the essentially constant primary particle size of the anatase polymorph, this can be understood as a moderate effect of Zr on the pores of the catalysts, leading to partial occlusion. The catalysts were subjected to microscopy examination. On the first place, SEM micrographs were obtained and presented in Fig. S8 together with XEDS maps. SEM micrographs show the microsized secondary particles typical of the anatase oxide prepared using the same synthesis procedure [70]. In all cases, the solids present the mentioned secondary particles with size in the micron range, and a homogeneous dispersion of Zr and the noble metal. The noble metal component was analyzed in more detail using TEM. For selected samples, Fig. 5 includes low and high magnification TEM micrographs as well as platinum primary particle size distributions. The platinum component is present as nanorods, with aspect ratio going from ca. 1 to 2 for all samples. The primary particle size is similar in all cases, rendering an average particle size in the 4.2 to 4.3 nm range. According to the TEM images, the noble metal phase morphology is similar in all samples, this including the primary particle size, shape and distribution over the supports. The contact between the noble metal and anatase is better examined using the dark STEM images presented in Fig. 6 . The Pt seems located preferentially at specific locations of the support, likely connected with the edges of the anatase nanoparticles (see also Fig. 5). In Fig. 6 we can also observe the significantly more homogeneous (with respect to the noble metal) distribution of the Zr in the materials. The SEM-TEM-STEM combined analysis provides conclusive evidence of the strong similarity of the samples in terms of the noble metal entities morphological/structural properties, their contact with the support as well as the Zr dispersion at the anatase phase. The analysis of the minor (and major) components present in the samples was completed with the help of XPS. As expected, the analysis of the Ti 2p signal (Fig. S9) in all samples provides the evidence of a Ti(IV) chemical state (Ti 2p3/2 binding energy peaking at 458.0 eV for all samples) characteristic of titanium oxides [75]. The analysis of the cation species of the oxide component is completed with the study of the Zr 3d region. This XPS region is presented in Fig. 7 . The Zr 3d5/2 binding energy has a value of 181.1 ± 0.1 eV for all samples, indicating a constant Zr(IV) chemical states in all powders [75]. Fig. 7 also includes a correlation plot of the Zr/Ti atomic ratio measured using XPS and chemical analysis. A near linear trend between these two observables is evident from the plot. The slope of the correlation is 0.91, indicating that Zr has a rather modest tendency to be at the bulk of the anatase component for all samples. In addition, the data confirm the homogeneous dispersion within the anatase nanoparticle. This confirms our previous conclusion based in microscopy and other physico-chemical analyses. For the platinum component, the 4f7/2 peak (see Fig. 8 for T-xZ samples and Fig. S10 for the T reference) displays a constant binding energy of 70.95 ± 0.05 eV for all samples. This binding energy corresponds to a metallic state [71,75]. The zero valent chemical state of the noble metal is in line with previous reports studying platinum deposition on titania, where an inert atmosphere was utilized [13,15,76]. Further details of the noble metal phases can be obtained from the analysis of the Pt/Ti ratio. In Fig. 8 we first note that chemical analysis rendered a noble metal content equivalent to 0.85 to 0.94 wt%. This is rather close to the target value of 1 wt% and the differences between samples are rather small. The XPS result is essentially equal to the chemical analysis counterpart. This fact is in agreement with the nearly equal platinum particle size values rendered by the analysis of microscopy results (Fig. 6). The UV–visible spectra of the samples are collected in Fig. 9 . The spectra of all samples recall the one of the bare support except for a broad absorption feature extending into the visible region. In the UV region, the spectra are dominated by anatase as expected by their chemical composition. Considering that the anatase phase is an indirect gap semiconductor [77], we calculated (see Fig. S11) the band gap values presented in Table 1. The similar band gap value displayed in this table for all samples is accompanied by the absence of noticeable changes in valence and conduction band position according to the analysis of the XPS valence band onset (results not shown) and bandgap constancy. The noble metal component is not detected by any signal or contribution to the UV–visible spectra as the surface plasmon resonances in Pt cases do not usually render discrete peaks in the UV–visible spectrum due to the damping effect caused by d-d intraband transitions [53,61]. Thus, the broad signal at the visible region is attributable to localized electronic states related to the Zr presence at the anatase component. Thus Zr presence at the anatase structure (up to the level here analyzed, 5 mol. %) does not alter the band gap of the semiconductor but generates localized states located in the gap [53]. These localized states can be directly connected with the Zr- associated anion defects, according to theoretical studies of Zr-doping of the anatase structure [78]. Summarizing the structural and electronic characterization of the materials, the study shows the rather small differences among samples apart from the different Zr content of the materials and the presence of localized electronic states at the bandgap, leading to absorption in the visible range. We also note that according to the observables presented in Table 1 and Figs. 7 and 8, post-reaction specimens do not evolve under reaction conditions. This includes the similar values obtained in the primary particle size, anatase band gap, and valence and conduction bands positions, as well as Zr (surface/bulk) distribution in the anatase network and, finally, the morphological properties in all the samples. The physico-chemical stability of the materials justifies the rather stable activity presented for the catalysts under repeated cycling catalytic tests, as illustrated in Fig. S7 for the most active sample, T-2.5Z. The in-situ analysis of the catalyst(s) response under reaction conditions was followed using infrared. Figs. 10 and 11 summarize results for sample T and T-2.5Z, respectively. Infrared results for sample T-5Z are presented in Fig. S12. These figures display results under UV illumination conditions and contain plots concerning difference spectra, taking as background the first spectrum recorded during each step of the treatment of the samples consisting in a sequential: i) adsorption of methanol in the presence of water vapor, and ii) reaction mixture (methanol:water) under illumination conditions. Samples were pre-treated only with a nitrogen flow (10 min) prior to IR measurements. Rather similar results to Figs. 10 and 11 were obtained under visible light illumination (results not shown). Following previous experience in the hydrogen photo-production reaction, the infrared study is utilized to uncover the reaction mechanism [13–15]. Adsorption of methanol prior to illumination generates surface methanol and methoxy species (spectra presented in the top charts of Figs. 10 and 11). In all cases studied, methanol (C–H contributions at 2952/2842 cm−1) seems to have larger intensity than methoxy (2922/2828 cm−1) species [13,79,80]. This is concomitantly observed with a slight decrease of isolated hydroxyl of titania at ca. 3700–3650 cm−1 as well as a strong decreasing of the water (and interacting hydroxyl radicals) signals at ca. 3650–3200 and 1636 cm−1 (see the last panel in Figs. 10 and 11 for the water region). C-O stretching bands for the two (methanol/methoxy) adsorbate species appear around 1033 cm−1, but the bands are so broad that cannot be easily resolved (Figs. 10 and 11). All samples (T, Fig. 10, T-2.5Z, Fig. 11, and T-5Z, Fig. S12) generate CO2 as the main product detected by infrared. The gas-phase branches of the molecule at 2350/2341 cm−1 are visible in all samples, with intensity roughly proportional to the activity. Thus methanol/methoxyl species evolve in the surface of the materials and finally render CO2. The most efficient surface chemistry of the T-2.5Z is demonstrated by the higher amount of carbon dioxide. To understand the evolution of the methanol-related species, we analyzed the peaks in the ca. 1500–1100 cm−1 region. These peaks are indicative of the formation of species coming from the oxidation of the carbon containing sacrificial molecule (Figs. 10, 11 and S12). In particular, the 1563/1414 cm−1 contributions can be ascribed to bridged carboxylates (likely formate species) in the T reference sample [13,79,80]. The samples containing zirconium show a slightly different carboxylate species, with contributions at 1573 and 1414 (weak)/1358(strong) cm−1. This may indicate the presence of Zr near a part of the adsorbed carboxylate/carbonate species. Under reaction conditions we only detected a slight increase of the common carboxylate species (to T and T-xZ samples). In addition, we detected the presence of atop carbonyl species over metallic Pt in all samples. This species is associated with bands at 2057–2064 and 2029–2033 cm−1 [13,15,81]. The two frequency ranges likely represent adsorption in closed planes (highly coordinated Pt atoms; low wavenumber contribution) and in more unsaturated Pt coordination environments, corresponding to edges or kinks (high wavenumber contribution). Only the higher wavenumber counterpart reacts under illumination. It is important to note that the characteristic carbonyl species over titania (ca. 2175–2120 cm−1; see ref. [82]) are not observed in Figs. 10, 11 and S12, nor for the support alone under reaction (result not shown). The infrared study can be rationalized with a step-way transformation of methanol dominated by the chemistry of the titania surface up to the production of formic acid precursors (CH3OH + 2 h+ →CH2O + 2H+; CH2O + H2O + 2 h+ →HCOOH + 2H+). Protons are (concomitantly) produced in each step of the organic compound(s) oxidation process, generating hydrogen with a primary role of the noble metal surface (2H++ 2e- →H2). This step-like alcohol reforming-type mechanism has been shown dominant when methanol is present in the reaction media (from ca. 1 to 90 vol%) for many Pt promoted titania-based materials [10,11,13,28,46]. Once at the surface, carboxylates, mainly formate species according to infrared results, evolve forming carbon monoxide, HCOOH → CO + OH− + H+ (2 Ti-OH). This reaction occurs in thermal catalysis and is likely promoted under the light in specific systems [83]. The CO formation step would be followed by the water gas shift reaction, generating hydrogen (CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2) as carbon monoxide is not detected at the outlet of the reactor for any sample. Note that carboxylates can evolve directly to CO2 but the infrared study demonstrates that it is not a dominant patway in the conversion of carboxylate type surface species. All samples display rather similar surface chemistry (with the exception of a minor effect of Zr in carboxylate/carbonate species as detected by small shifts in the frequency values of infrared active modes) and thus the influence of Zr on photoactivity should have other grounds. To further analyze the Zr catalytic effect we performed a thorough analysis of charge handling and fate in the catalysts. We use photoluminescence to analyze charge recombination and combine it with a study of the formation of the different radical species using electron paramagnetic resonance. Under UV (upper row in Fig. 12 ), bare anatase shows rather broad photoluminescence peaks coming mostly from the annihilation of free electron/holes with localized (defect-related states) holes/electrons [84]. The presence of Pt significantly decreases the signal. The noble metal – semiconductor interaction is known to facilitate the decay of hot electrons in electron – hole pair species, favoring separation of charge and resulting in the acute photoluminescence intensity decay here detected [85]. The photoluminescence spectra under visible (425 nm) illumination are also displayed in Fig. 12 and show the typical relatively weak signals associated to defect state(s) de-excitation over a decay curve corresponding to the excitation line [86]. Under both illumination conditions the presence of Pt decreases significantly the photoluminescence intensity indicating the lower recombination of charge. The co-presence of Zr and the noble metal makes a stronger, positive effect, limiting the recombination of charge. Using EPR we followed the transformation of the charge carrier species avoiding recombination and reaching the surface of the materials. Specifically, we measured the hydroxyl-type radical species formed using DMPO as probe molecule. Fig. 13 (upper panels) show the typical 1:2:2:1 signal with spin Hamiltonian parameters: aNO = 14.9 G, aH = 14.9 G; g = 2.0056, attributed to the formation of a DMPO-OH adduct [14,87,88]. The intensity of the DMPO-OH signal increases with UV irradiation time. The accumulation of DMPO-OH radical adducts grows continuously for all samples but such radicals have a limited stability and a maximum concentration as a function of time is always detected. The latter is an effect of multiple additions, within consecutive reactions, of OH radicals to DMPO molecules to yield diamagnetic species. The initial rate of radical formation normalized to take into account the optical properties of the solids is a measure of the radical rate of the hydroxyl-type species reaching the surface of the materials (for the quantitative measurement of this rate see equation S23 at the Supporting information section). The bottom panel of Fig. 13 confronted the availability of this radical at the surface of the material with the hydrogen photoproduction reaction rate. A linear trend is observed as expected if this species controls activity [11,89]. Thus, optimum activity is linked to optimum generation of charge carrier reaching the surface. This is optimized for a 2.5 mol. % of Zr. Further increase of the Zr content increases recombination of charge according to photoluminescence (Fig. 12), a fact likely connecting with the presence of recombination centres generated by the close proximity of doped species. Thus the joint usage of photoluminescence and EPR demonstrates that the decrease of charge recombination related to the Zr presence at the anatase network is directly linked with the higher availability of hydroxyl-radical species at the surface of the material(s) and in turn this favors the production of hydrogen. This is illustrated in Scheme 1 which also provides a graphical view of the simultaneous higher production of electrons (in turn used in generating hydrogen at the metal surface) as well as the essentially null effect of Zr in surface properties driving the transformation of the sacrificial molecule. So, Fig. 13 provides a conclusive proof that the optoelectronic (rather than morphological, structural and/or surface) effects exerted by Zr in charge recombination and (charge carrier) availability at the surface are at the core of the outstanding catalytic properties of the Zr-doped Pt-TiO2 system. Note that this occurs under both UV and visible illumination conditions, rendering highly active materials for the use of sunlight as a green energy source of the hydrogen photoproduction process."
6,Conclusions,"In this work we carried out the synthesis of Zr-doped pure nanosized anatase nanoparticles using a microemulsion method. Anatase-based materials with a Zr content up to 5 mol. % were obtained. After platinization, the solids are high surface area materials with a Zr distribution roughly homogeneous through the anatase nanoparticles. Pt forms rather similar metallic nanorods in all samples, with a particle size ca. 4 nm. Zr introduction in the anatase phase showed a strong positive effect in hydrogen photo-production. As measured by the (true) quantum efficiency, Zr (T-2.5Z sample) is able to create a material with a 4.6% value under sunlight illumination, the top of those currently available. This comes from significant enhancement of the Pt-TiO2 performance under both UV and visible illumination conditions. The study of the reaction mechanism showed that the sacrificial methanol molecule evolve though consecutive oxidation steps up to formate species which further evolves rendering CO. This molecule is transformed at the Pt surface though the water gas shift reaction. Zr does not modify the surface chemistry of the Pt-TiO2 materials substantially, but accelerates the reaction as judged by the detection of carbon dioxide. The joint use of photoluminescence and EPR showed the enhancement of activity is grounded in a decrease of charge recombination under all illumination (UV, visible) conditions and the efficient transformation of charge (avoiding recombination) in hydroxyl-type radicals involved in the controlling kinetic steps of the reaction. Thus Zr doping has a critical role in optoelectronic properties, which drive the formation of charge carrier species at the surface of the material involved in hydrogen photoproduction. In short, Zr incorporation to the well known Pt-TiO2 system renders an outstanding material for the fruitful use of sunlight as the energy source of the reaction."
