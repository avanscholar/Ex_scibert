0,Introduction,"A diminishing of the worldwide petroleum reserves has shifted the focus of energy sources to other alternatives such as conversion of natural gas and biomass to H2 [1]. Fuel cells that use H2 as an energy source are environmentally friendly as compared to the traditional forms of combustion using fuels such as gasoline and diesel in the sense that the only one by-product from the H2 fuel cells is water, thereby eliminating the emission of greenhouse gases [2,3]. Furthermore, the H2 fuel cells also offer high energy conversion efficiency and a variety of possible uses in both mobile and stationary applications [4]. H2 can be produced from many sources and by a variety of methods, such as electrolysis and photo-splitting of water, water-gas shift, reforming of hydrocarbons, alcohols and biomass [5–9]. Although the H2 production from water is nearly carbon-free, the cost of water electrolysis is prohibitively high while the efficiency of photo-splitting of water is rather low for the large-scale production of H2. Therefore, reforming reaction that is a primary conventional method for H2 production remains the major method for a certain period. In order to improve the efficiency of H2 production, reforming technology has been improved step by step. The replacement of conventional fixed-bed reactors with membrane reactors is believed to be one of the most important improvements on reforming technology. Recently, many attentions have been placed on the integration of separation (or purification) membrane and chemical reactor [10,11]. Catalytic membrane reactor (CMR), particularly Pd-based membrane reactor, which combines the Pd-based membrane as a part of separation unit and chemical reaction into one device is consequence of this integration. CMR is capable of promoting the reaction efficiency by selective removal of H2 through the membrane from the chemical reaction, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards the product side [12,13]. As a result, the integration of these two units offers two prominent advantages [14–16]. Firstly, highly pure H2 can be directly produced from the CMR without any requirement of further purification, hence reducing the cost of H2 production. Secondly, the removal of H2 from the reaction zone enhances the reaction efficiency by shifting the equilibrium forward, which is able to increase the reaction conversion as well as the H2 selectivity and/or reduce the reaction temperature. Table 1 summary the membrane type, operative condition and performances of the Pd-based membrane reactors and other types of CMRs which have been successfully used for H2 production from hydrocarbons reforming and other reactions. Mostly, membrane reactors were made in the tubular structure which pure Pd or Pd-alloy membrane is deposited on the outer surface of the tubular porous support. Based on the configuration of catalyst bed, there are mainly two different types of the Pd-based membrane reactors, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, the catalyst bed is packed inside the tubular porous support [19]; this configuration limits to the high pressure reactions. Alternatively, the catalyst bed is coaxially packed around the Pd-based membrane coated on the outer surface of the tubular porous support, enabling to avoid the problem of the first configuration [22–25]. These previous works show that the reaction conversion and the reaction efficiency can be greatly improved by replacing the conventional fixed-bed reactor with the catalytic membrane reactor. However, such previous works still have a number of drawbacks, especially the catalytic membrane reactors those the catalyst bed is arranged in the vicinity of the Pd-based membrane. In certain reactions such as auto-thermal reforming reaction, a sudden combustion reaction may takes place and generates heat to the portion of the catalyst layer. As a result, the Pd-based membrane can be exposed directly to high temperature, which may affect the durability of the membrane [35]. Furthermore, palladium can be reacted with the CO or CO2 produced in the catalyst layer, forming the PdCx-species on the surface of the Pd-based membrane which can significantly lower the separation efficiency of the Pd-based membrane [36]. Therefore, this work mainly concentrates on the above problems and develops the new triple-layer catalytic membrane reactor which consists of: (1) highly porous inorganic support (middle) layer; (2) catalyst (external) layer, capable of converting hydrocarbon to H2; and (3) Pd-based membrane (internal) layer for H2 separation. In other words, the Pd-based membrane will be not directly contacted with the catalyst layer by means of a porous support layer. Another task of this work is to further enhance efficiency of the catalytic membrane reactor by means of hollow fiber membrane which is capable of providing much larger surface area for gas permeation and chemical reaction as compared to the conventional tubular and dish-shaped membrane reactors with the same volume. More particularly, this work involves the development of triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor (T-HFCMR) which comprises: (1) A highly porous α-Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane, which provides high mechanical strength, high thermal stability and high chemical resistance, is used as the support. However, the presence of large pores as a defect on the membrane surface is the main problem of the α-Al2O3 support. These defects make it difficult to form the thin and dense Pd-based membrane by using the method of electroless plating. Therefore, another ceramic material (i.e. YSZ) was added to fill up the large pores of the α-Al2O3 support. (2) A catalyst layer, which is capable of converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen, is coated on the outer surface of the porous YSZ-doped α-Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane support wherein reforming reactions take place. The reforming catalyst used in this work is Ni-based catalyst which is well-known as the most effective, due to its high catalytic activity for reforming reactions and its low cost. In our previous works [37,38], Ni-based perovskite oxide have been successfully used as catalyst precursors for methane reforming, therefore the Ni-based perovskite oxide (i.e. LaNiO3 perovskite) was used as a catalyst layer of this triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor. (3) A hydrogen-permeable membrane, which is used to separate H2 gas from other gases, is coated on an inner surface of a porous YSZ-doped α-Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane support by sequential electroless plating. In our previous work [39], the internally-coated Pd-Ag alloy membranes exhibit the improved thermal and mechanical stability and durability as compared to the conventionally externally-coated Pd-Ag alloy membrane. Therefore, the internally-coated Pd-Ag alloy membrane was also used in the present work. Finally, performance of the developed T-HFCMR was investigated by using catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) reaction as a model reaction. The effects of flow configurations, reaction temperatures, and trans-membrane pressures on the H2 production efficiency of the T-HFCMR were also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of LaNiO3 perovskite,"2.1 Preparation of LaNiO3 perovskite LaNiO3 perovskite used as a catalyst precursor was prepared from a citrate sol-gel method. La(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)3·6H2O and citric acid (as a chelating agent) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The procedure for preparation of LaNiO3 perovskite was reported in detail elsewhere [37]."
3,Preparation of triple-layer hollow fiber membrane reactor,"2.2 Preparation of triple-layer hollow fiber membrane reactor Fig. 2 shows a procedure for the preparation of triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor which consists of (i) porous ceramic hollow fiber support (middle) layer, (ii) catalyst (external) layer and (iii) Pd-based membrane (internal) layer. The porous ceramic hollow fiber membrane support (2) made from the mixed ceramic materials (i.e. α-Al2O3 mixed with 20wt% of YSZ) was prepared by phase-inversion method. The detailed procedure for the preparation of the porous ceramic hollow fiber membrane support was reported in detail elsewhere [39]. The catalyst layer (3) made from the LaNiO3 perovskite was coated on the outer surface of the obtained porous ceramic hollow fiber membrane support (2) by the combination of dip-coating and phase-inversion methods. More particularly, 30wt% of LaNiO3 perovskite and 20wt% of α-Al2O3 were mixed with polymer solution containing 42wt% of NMP and 8wt% of PESf to prepare the catalyst-polymer dope solution which was used as the coating solution. The obtained mixture was continuous stirred until a homogeneous catalyst-polymer dope solution was obtained. The resultant dope solution was then coated on the outer surface of the porous ceramic hollow fiber membrane support (2) by dip-coating method. Thickness of the coating layer was controlled to be 200µm, providing about 200mg of the LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor. Finally, the obtained dual-layer hollow fiber membrane was sintered in air at different temperatures of 800, 1000 and 1200°C (with a heating rate of 1°C/min). Lastly, the H2-permeable membrane (1) made from the palladium-silver alloy was coated on the inner surface of the porous ceramic hollow fiber membrane support (2) by electroless plating. Prior to electroless plating, the external surface of the dual-layer hollow fiber membrane was coated with the protective polymer layer (which is a mixture of 42wt% NMP and 8wt% PESf) to prevent the deposition of palladium and silver on the LaNiO3 perovskite catalyst layer during the electroless plating. Prior to electroless plating, all samples must be accomplished by conventional two processes comprising sensitization using a SnCl2 solution and activation using a PdCl2 solution. Table 2 shows the plating composition of Pd and Ag plating solutions. A desired amount of each component was added into 50ml of 1mM acid aqueous solution and stirred until the homogenous clear solution was obtained. Prior to the electroless plating of Pd and Ag, pH values of the plating solutions were adjusted to be in a range of 8–9 by using 28% NH4OH solution. Finally, 0.3ml of 1M N2H4·H2O was slowly added to the pH-controlled plating solution to start the deposition of Pd and Ag. The Pd-Ag membrane was prepared through the sequence deposition of palladium and silver whereby the Pd-seeded dual-layer hollow fiber membrane were firstly immersed in the Pd plating solution, and thoroughly washed with deionized water before immersing in the Ag plating solution. After plating, the resultant membrane was again washed with deionized water and then dried at 60°C. The Pd and Ag deposited membrane was then annealed to form Pd-Ag alloy. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 350°C with a heating rate of 2°C/min under 50ml/min of helium, and then temperature was further increased from 350°C to 480°C under the H2 atmosphere (10vol% H2 in helium) and temperature was hold at 480°C for 7h. Finally, the temperature was decreased to room temperature under 50ml/min of helium."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Structural properties of samples were characterized by using a SHIMADZU XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154nm), operated at 40kV and 30mA. The data was collected at 0.02° with a counting time of 5s per step, in the 2θ range of 20–80°. Reduction behaviour of LaNiO3 perovskite was studied by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a ChemBET™ 3000. The sample was first degassed at 150°C for 3h with a helium flow rate of 50ml/min and then cooled to room temperature under flowing helium. Reduction profiles were recorded using 5vol% H2 in N2 balance, with a heating rate of 10°C/min, from room temperature to 800°C. Morphology of the prepared triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactors were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 2872), carried out using an electron beam of 15kV. EDX analysis which is in connection with the SEM was used to identify the composition of Pd and Ag elements in Pd-Ag alloy coated hollow fiber membranes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) was performed to examine the structure and size features of the catalysts. The samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol in order to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. A droplet of the dispersion was placed in a carbon coated copper grid and dried at 60°C for 15min The microscope was then operated at an acceleration voltage of 100–150kV, with magnifications in the range of 10,000–100,000."
5,Performance testing of T-HFCMR,"2.4 Performance testing of T-HFCMR Fig. 3 shows the apparatus which as used to investigate the performance of the developed T-HFCMR for H2 production from the CDM reaction. A catalyst layer (contains ~0.2g of LaNiO3) was firstly reduced at 600°C for 1h by introducing 20ml/min H2 into the reaction (shell) side of the T-HFCMR. After that, the CDM reaction was conducted by introducing methane into the reaction side of T-HFCMR. The reaction temperatures ranging from 450 to 600°C and pressure (or shell-side's pressure) ranging from 100 to 200kPa were used to investigate the performance of the T-HFCMR. Helium (50ml/min) used as a sweep gas was feed into the lumen-side of the T-HFCMR. Both the permeate stream and retentate stream from the T-HFCMR were continually analysed by online gas chromatography (GC, HP6890) using a packed column (Carboxen™ 1000, 60/80 mesh sizes and 0.5g/ft packing density) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In order to compare the efficiencies of the T-HFCMR developed and the conventional fixed-bed reactor, the catalytic performance test of the LaNiO3 perovskite was also carried out in the fixed-bed reactor under the same condition. The following definitions were used to describe performance of the developed triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor (T-HFCMR): (1) CH 4 conversion , ( % ) = 1 − CH 4 , out CH 4 , in × 100 (2) H 2 recovery , ( % ) = H 2 , permeate ( H 2 , permeate ) + ( H 2 , retentate ) × 100 (3) H 2 selectivity , ( % ) = H 2 , permeate ( CH 4 + H 2 + CO ) permeate × 100 where H2, CH4, and CO permeate are the H2, CH4, and CO molar flow rate permeating through the T-HFCMR and collected in the permeate (core) side, respectively, H2, retentate is the H2 molar flow rate remaining in the reaction (shell) side of T-HFCMR, CH4, in is the inlet molar flow rate of methane, and CH4, out is the outlet molar flow rate of methane over the T-HFCMR."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Dual-layer (catalyst-support) hollow fiber membrane,"3.1 Dual-layer (catalyst-support) hollow fiber membrane LaNiO3 perovskite as a catalyst precursor for reforming reaction was coated on the external surface of the 20wt% YSZ-doped α-Al2O3 hollow fiber by using dip-coating method. In order to obtain the same amount of the LaNiO3 perovskite (~0.2g) in the catalyst layer, thickness was carefully controlled. The obtained dual-layer hollow fiber membranes were then sintered at different temperatures of 800, 1000, and 1200°C to investigate the effect of sintering temperature on morphology and properties of the catalyst layer. 3.1.1 Morphology of dual-layer hollow fiber membrane Fig. 4 shows physical morphologies of the double-layer hollow fiber membranes obtained after sintering at different temperatures. At sintering temperature of 800°C, the cracking between the catalyst (outer) layer and the support (inner) one can be clearly observed (as shown in Fig. 4a), indicating the poor adhesion between these two layers. Upon increasing of sintering temperature significantly improves the adhesion between the catalyst and support layers. On the other hand, the catalyst layer was found to be strongly attached to the support layer without any cracking at the interface of dual-layer hollow fiber membrane sintered at 1200°C (as shown in Fig. 4b), indicating the strong adhesion between the catalyst and support layers in the dual-layer hollow fiber membrane. However, the further increase in the sintering temperature (>1200°C) significantly causes the phase transition of LaNiO3 perovskite, which is due to the solid-state reaction between Al2O3 and LaNiO3 perovskite at high sintering temperature. This phase transition can significantly lower the catalytic performance of LaNiO3 perovskite, due to the low reducibility of the new phase that will be discussed later. Therefore, the dual-layer hollow fiber membrane sintered at 1200°C was chosen for further studies. 3.1.2 XRD analysis of LaNiO3 perovskite catalyst layer Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and the reduced LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of the dual-layer hollow fiber membranes sintered at different temperatures. The characteristic diffraction peaks of LaNiO3 perovskite-type structure (2θ=23.2, 32.6, 40.5, 46.9 and 65.4°) with a rhombohedral symmetry (that is indicated by the splitting peak at 2θ=32.6°) and Al2O3 (2θ=35 and 43°) used as a binder in the catalyst layer are clearly observed in the fresh LaNiO3 catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes. In addition, the main characteristic peaks of NiAl2O4 spinel phase (2θ=37, 46, and 65.5°) can also be observed when it was sintered at high temperatures, as shown in Fig. 5a. The formation of this NiAl2O4 spinel phase can be attributed to the solid-state reaction between Al2O3 and Ni diffused from either LaNiO3 perovskite or NiO phase, which usually takes place during the sintering at high temperature [46]. Moreover, the decrease in the peak intensity of Al2O3 with the increase of sintering temperature can also be the evident for the presence of this solid-state reaction. After the reduction under H2 atmosphere at 600°C for 1h, main characteristic peaks attributed to the LaNiO3 perovskite-type structure disappeared and changed into the characteristic peaks of La2O3 and metallic Ni° (2θ=45, 52, and 76.5°), as shown in Fig. 5b. Moreover, it can also be observed that the peak intensity of metallic Ni° after the H2 reduction decreased when the sintering temperature was increased from 800 to 1200°C. This result suggests that the reducibility of LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membrane decreases with the increase in sintering temperature. Furthermore, the NiAl2O4 spinel phase can still be observed in the catalyst layer after the reduction. This is mainly due to the fact that the NiAl2O4 spinel phase has much lower reducibility as compared to the LaNiO3 perovskite phase. 3.1.3 Reduction behaviour of LaNiO3 perovskite in catalyst layer The reduction behaviour of pure LaNiO3 perovskite powder as a reference and LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membrane was analysed by H2-TPR analysis and results are as shown in Fig. 6. Both pure LaNiO3 perovskite powder and LaNiO3 perovskite catalyst layer in the dual-layer hollow fiber membrane exhibited two main transition peaks at temperature ranges of 300–450°C and 500–600°C. The first transition peak can be assigned to the reduction of Ni3+to Ni2+, and the second one can be assigned to the reduction of Ni2+to metallic Ni° particle [47]. Moreover, it can be observed that the transition peaks of LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes was shifted to higher temperature with increasing of sintering temperature. This result indicates that the reducibility of LaNiO3 perovskite decreases with the increase in sintering temperature, which is consistent with the previous XRD results. Furthermore, the additional transition peak at 700°C can also be observed in the LaNiO3 perovskite catalyst layer, while it cannot be observed in pure LaNiO3 perovskite powder. Therefore, the additional transition peak at 700°C can be assigned to the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel phase [48]. Moreover, it can also be observed that the intensity of this additional transition peak increases with an increase of sintering temperature. This result also indicates the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel in the catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membrane during the sintering at high temperature. TEM image ( Fig. 7) of the reduced LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes shows the formation of metallic Ni° nanoparticles dispersed on the La2O3 after H2 reduction at 600°C for 1h. The small particle size and well dispersion of Ni° nanoparticles (average particle size of 18.06±3.512nm) can be obtained after the H2 reduction of LaNiO3 perovskite. Therefore, it is worth to be noted that this is the advantage of using LaNiO3 perovskite as a catalyst precursor for reforming reaction [37]."
8,Triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor,"3.2 Triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor Ultra-thin (~1.2µm) Pd-Ag alloy (~21.06wt% Ag) membrane as the H2 separation layer was finally coated on the inner surface of the dual-layer hollow fiber membrane by using the sequential electro-less plating of Pd and Ag, respectively, and followed by annealing at moderate temperature under hydrogen atmosphere. 3.2.1 Morphology of triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane Fig. 8 shows the cross-sectional and surface morphologies of the obtained triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor which consists of (1) LaNiO3 perovskite as the catalyst (outer) layer, (2) 20wt% YSZ-doped Al2O3 as the highly porous support (middle) layer, and (3) 1.2µm thick Pd-Ag alloy membrane as the H2 separation (inner) layer. The cross-sectional view of the support layer, as illustrated in Fig. 8a, shows that the finger-like voids were formed near the walls of hollow fiber membrane. These finger-like voids are usually undesired because they may lower the mechanical strength of the membranes. However, it is important to note that H2 permeation flux can be remarkably decreased when the membrane with dense structure is used as the support, which is due to the increase in gas diffusion barrier of the dense support layer [40]. Therefore, in order to eliminate gas diffusion barrier of the support layer as well as minimize the effect of concentration polarization which is resulted from the accumulation of the less-permeable gases and the depletion of H2 gas in the boundary layer near the membrane surface, the YSZ-doped Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane used as the support were fabricated to have small finger-like voids near the both internal and external walls. On the other hand, the cross-sectional view of the catalyst layer, as illustrated in Fig. 8b, shows that the catalyst layer in the T-HFCMR has highly porous structure, which is necessary for diffusion of reactant gases and reaction to take place. The catalyst layer with a thickness of ~200µm was controlled to obtain approximately 0.2g of LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer. Finally, the Pd-Ag alloy membrane with the thickness of ~1.2µm located at the inner layer of the T-HFCMR has a homogenous and dense structure without any pinhole on the surface of membrane, as shown in Fig. 8 c. 3.2.2 H2 permeability of 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane in triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor Prior to the permeation tests, pressure-hold test at room temperature was conducted using pure hydrogen gas in order to investigate the gas-tight property of the Pd-Ag alloy membrane. The triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor (T-HFCMR) with the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane exhibited almost identical pressure hold capability at 300 kPa (3bar) pressure. This result suggests that the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane inside the triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor is defect-free and therefore has the gas-tight property. The hydrogen permeability of the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane in the T-HFCMR was then investigated using pure hydrogen gas over a temperature range of 450–600°C and trans-membrane pressure difference of 40–120kPa. The H2 permeation flux equation is generally expressed as follows: (4) J = P ( P r e t e n t a t e n – P p e r m e a t e n ) Where J is the H2 permeation flux, P is the H2 permeance, Pretentate and Ppermeate are the H2 partial pressure on the retentate and permeate sides of the membrane, respectively, and n is the pressure exponent value which depends on the rate-determining step of hydrogen permeation through the Pd-based membrane. According to Sievert's law [39], n-valve is equal to 0.5 when the H2 bulk diffusion through the membrane is the rate-determining step. On the other hand, n-valve will be close to 1 when the surface reactions (i.e. associative and/or dissociative chemisorption of H2 on the membrane surface) become the rate-determining step. Fig. 9 shows H2 permeation flux of the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane as a function of pressure difference across the membrane at different temperatures. The linear dependence of H2 permeation flux on P1.18 retentate−P1.18 permeate for 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membrane at the given temperatures (Fig. 9a) suggests that the surface reaction is the rate-determining step rather than the bulk diffusion of atomic hydrogen for H2 permeation through the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membranes. It was also found that the pressure exponent (n-valve in Eq. (4)) is higher than 1. This can be explained by the surface segregation of silver on the membrane surface at high temperature, which can retard the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of palladium [49,50]. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of H2 permeation through the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membranes well follows the Arrhenius's equation, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the 1.2µm Pd-Ag alloy membranes was calculated to be 13.64kJ/mol, which is in good agreement to the literature [41,51,52]."
9,Hydrogen production from triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactors,"3.3 Hydrogen production from triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactors Fig. 10 shows general concept for production of hydrogen from the developed triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor (T-HFCMR) via hydrocarbon reforming reaction. Firstly, the stream of hydrocarbon is fed into contact with the catalyst layer (1) coated on an outer surface of porous support, producing hydrogen and other possible gases such as carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen gas produced is then easily diffused through the highly porous structure of a support layer (2), and continuously removed from the reaction zone through a dense Pd-Ag alloy membrane (3) into the permeate (core) side of triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor via solution-diffusion mechanism. On the other hand, other gases incapable of passing through the dense Pd-Ag alloy membrane remain in the retentate site and discharged from a gas outlet of the reactor. Catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) was chosen as a simple model reaction to investigate performance of the developed triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for pure hydrogen production. Typically, hydrocarbon reforming reaction must be operated at high reaction temperature in order to obtain highly pure H2 in the product stream. For instance, in our previous study, the highest H2 content in the product stream of 80vol% (or about 92% CH4 conversion) can be obtained only when the CDM reaction was operated at a reaction temperature of 800°C. This not only increases the energy consumption for pure H2 production from hydrocarbon reforming reactions, but also increases the deactivation rate of catalysts. Therefore, the use of triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor, whereby reaction and separation take place simultaneously in the same device, enable the reforming reaction to overcome those difficulties by continuous removal of H2 from the reaction side. As a result, the reaction shifts towards the product side, resulting in the high CH4 conversion even at the low reaction temperature and thus the deactivation of catalyst can be conceivably avoided. 3.3.1 Performance of the triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor as a function of flow configuration It has been reported that flow configurations of the sweep gas can significantly affect the H2 production efficiency of catalytic membrane reactors [42]. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of flow configurations (i.e. co-current and counter current), helium as a sweep gas was introduced into the permeate (or core) side of triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor in two different directions. Fig. 11 shows the H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery during the CDM reaction in the T-HFCMRs as a function of flow configurations. It can be seen that the T-HFCMR performed by using the counter-current flow configuration exhibits better performance in term of H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery as compared to the T-HFCMR performed by using the co-current flow configuration. This is due to the differences in the distribution of H2 gas partial pressures along the reactor in these two different configurations. More particularly, in the co-current flow configuration, the H2 partial pressures in both the permeate side and retentate side increase along the reactor axes, and hence the difference between the H2 partial pressure in the permeate side and in the retentate side decreases along the reactor axes [43,53]. As the driving force for the H2 permeation through the Pd-based membranes is the difference between the H2 partial pressure in the permeate side and in the retentate side, therefore by using the co-current flow configuration, the H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery are relatively low. On the other hand, in the counter-current flow configuration, the difference between the H2 partial pressure in the permeate side and in the retentate side nearly remains the same or even become larger along the reactor axes as a sweep gas flows in the opposite direction [33,34,42,53]. Moreover, it has been reported in the literature [43] that even though the H2 partial pressure in the retentate (reaction) side decreases along the reactor because almost all of the H2 gas produced from the reaction is permeated through the membrane and it almost become zero at the end of the reactor, but there still be a driving force for the H2 permeation because this is the inlet zone for the sweep gas. However, it should be noted that the differences in terms of reaction conversion, H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery in the co-current flow configuration and in the counter-current one become negligible when a very large sweep gas flow rate is used. For example, it has been reported that the reaction conversion, H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery in the co-current flow configuration and in the counter-current one are the same for a sweep gas flow rate >12,500 [43,44]. 3.3.2 Performance of the triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor as function of temperature and pressure A comparative study of CH4 conversion during the CDM reaction as a function of reaction temperature and pressure in the conventional fixed-bed reactor and the developed T-HFCMR are shown in Fig. 12. Under the similar reaction conditions, the increase in CH4 conversion can be obtained from the T-HFCMR as compared to the fixed-bed reactor. For example, 49.5% CH4 conversion was obtained from the T-HFCMR performed at the reaction temperature of 600°C and reaction pressure of 1bar, while only 39% CH4 conversion was obtained in the fixed-bed reactor performed at the same reaction condition. The increased reaction conversion in the T-HFCMR as compared to the fixed-bed reactor is due to the fact that the continuous removal of H2 from the reaction zone through the Pd-Ag alloy membrane shifts the reaction towards the product side and hence induces the higher reaction conversion, which is in accordance with the “Le Chatelier” principle. Under the same reaction pressure, it was also found that the difference in CH4 conversion obtained from T-HFCMR and fixed-bed reactor substantially increases with the reaction temperature. For example, at a constant reaction pressure of 1bar, 4% and 10% increase in CH4 conversion was obtained from the T-HFCMR as compared to the fixed-bed reactor at reaction temperature of 550 and 600°C, respectively. This is due to the temperature dependence of H2 permeation through the Pd-based membranes in which the H2 permeation flux increases with increasing temperature. Therefore, at the higher temperature, the higher H2 removal from the reaction zone through the Pd-Ag alloy membrane leads to further shift the reaction towards the product side, resulting in the higher CH4 conversion. As the results, it can be concluded that triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor can significantly increase the reaction conversion as compared to the conventional fixed-bed reactor, which is due to the continuous removal of H2 from the reaction zone through the Pd-Ag alloy membrane induces the higher CH4 conversion. Moreover, the reaction conversion can further be increased by the increasing of reaction temperature, which is due to the facts those: (1) CDM reaction is the endothermic reaction thereby the higher CH4 conversion is favoured by the higher reaction temperature; and (2) H2 permeation through the Pd-Ag alloy membrane in T-HFCMR is the temperature dependence process in which the higher temperature induces the higher H2 permeation through the membranes, and hence inducing the higher CH4 conversion. In contrast, the increasing of reaction pressure has two competitive effects on CH4 conversion during the CDM reaction performed in the developed T-HFCMR: • Negative effect due to thermodynamic feature of the CDM reaction (CH4→C+2H2), which higher H2 formation (or higher CH4 conversion) is not favoured by higher reaction pressure; and • Positive effect due to the pressure dependence of H2 permeation through the Pd-Ag alloy membrane, which higher pressure in the retentate side induces higher H2 removal from the reaction zone, and thus induces the higher CH4 conversion by shifting the reaction towards the product side. It can be seen in Fig. 12 that at a constant reaction temperature, CH4 conversion substantially increases with reaction pressure. For example, at 550°C the increasing of reaction pressure in the retentate side of the T-HFCMR from 1bar to 2bar increases CH4 conversion from 39–47%. This result indicates that the positive effect of the increasing reaction pressure dominates the improvement of reaction efficiency and performance of the T-HFCMRs. In order to explore performance of the developed T-HFCMR in term of pure H2 production, H2 permeation flux, H2 selectivity, and H2 recovery as a function of reaction temperature and pressure were investigated at different reaction temperatures ranging from 400 to 600°C and reaction pressures ranging from 1 to 2bar. As can be seen in Fig. 13a, H2 permeation flux and H2 selectivity (that is defined as the molar ratio between the H2 and all gases permeated through the dense Pd-Ag alloy membrane) increase with increasing reaction temperature and pressure. For example, at a constant pressure of 1.5bar, H2 permeation flux increases from 0.06 to 0.13molm−2 s−1 and H2 selectivity increases from 97.4–98.7% with increasing of temperature from 450 to 600°C. At a constant temperature of 550°C, H2 flux increases from 0.09 to 0.12molm−2 s−1 and H2 selectivity slightly increases from 97.7–98.3% with the increasing of reaction pressure from 1 to 2bar. Similarly, H2 recovery (that is defined as the molar ration between the H2 in the permeate side and the total amount of H2 produced) also increases with the increasing of reaction temperature and pressure, as shown in Fig. 13b. For example, at a constant pressure of 1.5bar, H2 recovery increases from 76–80% with the increasing of reaction temperature from 450 to 600°C. At a constant temperature of 500°C, H2 recovery increases from 72–82% with the increasing of reaction pressure from 1 to 2bar. These results can be explained by the fact that the increasing of reaction temperature and pressure results in the higher H2 flux permeated from the reaction zone through the dense Pd-Ag alloy membrane during the CDM reaction, which helps to shift reaction towards the product side (following Le Chatelier principle). This leads to the higher H2 permeation flux and higher CH4 conversion (lower unconverted CH4), therefore the H2 selectivity and H2 recovery also substantially increase with the increasing of reaction temperature and trans-membrane pressure. 3.3.3 Performance of triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor as a function of time on stream In order to investigate the stability of triple-layer catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor, the H2 flux, H2 recovery and H2 selectivity were measured during the CDM reaction which was performed continually for 35h at a constant reaction temperature of 550°C and reaction pressure of 1.5bar. Fig. 14a shows the H2 permeation flux through the developed T-HFCMR as a function of reaction time. The initial increase of H2 permeation flux from 0.035 to 0.097molm−2 s−1 can be observed within the first hour of time on stream. Similarly, the initial increase of the H2 recovery from 34–75% and the H2 selectivity from 96–98.5% can also be observed within the first hour of on stream, as illustrated in Fig. 14b. These results can be explained by two possible reasons: (1) the re-arrangement of palladium atoms in the palladium lattice [45] leads to the low H2 permeation and hence low H2 recovery and low H2 selectivity at the initial stage; and (2) the low hydrogen partial pressure in the retentate side which is due to the low catalytic activity of the catalyst layer at the beginning of CDM reaction. As mentioned earlier that the reducibility of LaNiO3 perovskite in the catalyst layer decreases with the increase sintering temperature, therefore there is some LaNiO3 perovskite phase still remains in the catalyst layer after the reduction; this can be responsible for the low catalytic activity at the beginning of CDM reaction. However, the remaining LaNiO3 perovskite phase can be further reduced by the H2 produced from the CDM reaction, and consequently further form the active Ni° nanoparticle. Therefore, CH4 conversion gradually increased from 32% at the beginning to the maximum valve of 43% when the remaining LaNiO3 perovskite phase was completely reduced. As a result, the H2 permeation flux, H2 recovery, and H2 selectivity gradually increase at the initial stage of reaction. Moreover, it can be seen that the triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor exhibits almost constant H2 selectivity over the period of testing time. This can be attributed to the high stability of internally-coated Pd-Ag alloy membrane which has been reported in our previous work [39]. However, the slight decrease in the CH4 conversion was observed after 10h of the reaction time, which is mainly due to the formation of deposited carbon on the surface of the catalyst during the CDM reaction. On the other hand, it was observed that the H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery were remarkably decreased after 14h of the reaction time. Apart from the decreased CH4 conversion, the decrease in the H2 permeation flux and H2 recovery might also due to the effect of the concentration polarization which is resulted from the accumulation of the less-permeable gases and, consequently, the depletion of H2 gas in the boundary layer near the membrane surface leads to the decrease in the H2 permeation flux as well as the H2 recovery of the membranes [54]. This result is in good agreement with the literature [55] which reported the effect of concentration polarization on gas separation and the membrane reactor. For example, Mori et al. [56] reported that the concentration polarization had a significant effect on the decrease in the hydrogen recovery in the steam reforming of methane using a catalytic membrane reactor with a highly permeable Pd-Ag membrane."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, triple-layer hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor (T-HFCMR) was developed and successfully used for H2 production via the CDM reaction. The T-HFCMR showed better reaction conversions as compared to a fixed-bed reactor which was operated under the same conditions. From the results, the amount of H2 produced and recovered from the core side of the T-HFCMR is positively affected by temperature and pressure across the T-HFCMR. More particularly, H2 flux ranging from 0.06 to 0.15molm−2 s−1 with 80–90% of H2 recovery and 95–99% of H2 selectivity can be obtained from the T-HFCMR developed over the given operating temperatures and pressures. Moreover, H2 recovery in the core side of the T-HFCMR under the counter-current flow configuration by using helium as a sweep gas is more efficient than the co-current flow configuration. Last but not least, mechanical damages (e.g. scratching) of Pd–Ag membrane can also be prevented as the Pd–Ag alloy membrane is not exposed directly to the external surface. Our preliminary work demonstrates that the fabrication techniques and process understanding generated from this study are generic and may be applied to other reactions."
