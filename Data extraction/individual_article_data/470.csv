0,Introduction,"Sonochemistry is considered as one of the cleaner ways for hydrogen production [1], particularly if the sonicated solution (water principally) contains alcohols at low concentrations [2]. The ultrasonic (US) irradiation of water, provoke the generation of strong oxidizing agents (i.e. ●OH, HO2 ● and O) and molecular species (i.e. H2 and H2O2) through the acoustic cavitation, which is the central event of this technique [3]. After formation, acoustic cavities can grow and collapse violently. During the fast compression of the entrapped vapor and gases, hot extreme conditions of temperature and pressure (∼5000 K and ∼ 500 bar [4]) are formed, leading to the decomposition of bubble content (i.e., water vapor, gases and entrapped volatile solutes) and the generation of different substances (radicals and molecules) [5]. The sonochemical hot spot theory considers the bubble at the last stage of collapse as a microreactor within which high energy combustion reactions and sonoluminescence occur in very short time (scale of nanoseconds). After final collapse, the bubble content is diffused into the thin layer immediately surrounding the collapsing bubble, where oxidants can drive other reaction chain in the liquid phase [6]. Methanol is an important chemical product. It is mostly utilized in the manufacture of other compounds such as formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl and vinyl acetates, methyl methacrylate, methylamines, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), fuel additives, and other chemicals. Every year, approximately 98 million tonnes are produced, almost entirely from fossil fuels (either natural gas or coal) [7,8]. The use of methanol in sonochemistry field has found a place through several experimental and theoretical works. In the early days of sonochemistry, Henglein and Schulz [9] have indicated a decrease of iodide oxidation yield with the increase of methanol amount added to sonicated potassium iodide aerated-solutions at 500 kHz. This was ascribed to the high vapor pressure of methanol, which causes the suppress of bubble sonoactivity. Similarly, Son and Zoh [10] have found that the increase of methanol quantity into the bulk liquid causes the formation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation rate of 1,4-dioxane to be reduced. The decrease of H2O2 generation at low temperatures was attributed to the scavenging effect of methanol towards hydroxyl radicals at the bubble-solution interface, whereas, the increase of liquid temperature transfer this mechanism into the acoustic cavitation. Additionally, Son and Zoh [10] indicated that the scavenging effect of ●OH radicals is time dependent (accelerated at the beginning of sonolysis), where, they observed that the degradation of 1,4-dioxane was accelerated after some time (depending on CH3OH concentration) in the presence of methanol. Buttner et al. [11] showed that typical pyrolysis and combustion products are obtained via the sonolysis of a methanol–water mixture under an argon and oxygen atmospheres, respectively, where the composition of the sonolysis products changes proportionally with the concentration of methanol in the bulk liquid. Additionally, Buttner et al. [11] observed clearly the increase of the chemical production in 10% (v/v) methanol solution compared to the case of pure water, whereas the sonoactivity is completely suppressed for the solutions containing more than 80% of methanol. Similarly, under an argon atmosphere, Rassokhin et al. [12] demonstrated the increased formation of the sonolysis products (e.g. hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide) of methanol proportionally with the increase of its concentration in the solutions (diluted solutions, 0.001–0.5 M). However, it is found that the yield of hydrogen peroxide goes down with the increase of methanol concentration due to the thermal dissociation of methanol, which promotes the formation of CO, whereas in very diluted solution of methanol, the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with methanol favors the formation of H2O2 and CO. Krishna et al. [13] have indicated the formation of CH3 ● (in a relatively important quantity) and CH2OH● radicals. The generation of methyl radicals was explained by the pyrolysis of methanol in the hot spot. However, the formation of CH2OH● radicals was attributed either to the pyrolysis of methanol or to the H abstraction through the reaction of methanol with H●, ●OH and CH3 ● radicals. Okitsu et al. [14] and Mizukoshi et al. [15] have observed the low consumption of DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) compared to the formation of hydrogen, which indicated the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals by methanol molecules inside bubbles. In addition, Okitsu et al. [14] and Mizukoshi et al. [15] have attributed the different degradation rates of DPPH to the evaporation rates of the organic solutes rather than their vapor pressure. Moreover, the effect of methanol (in addition to other organic species) on bubbles coalescence and its relation with sonoluminescence has been extensively analyzed in several works [16–18]. According to the experimental works of Rassokhin et al. [12] and Buttner et al. [11] an important amount of hydrogen can be produced in aqueous solution compared to that of pure water. Recently, numerous works have been concentrated on the sonochemical production of hydrogen [2,19–22]. Promising results have been achieved through these studies for an efficient and clean hydrogen production. Merouani et al. [2] and Kerboua et al. [23] have lately presented interesting reviews on the sonochemical production of hydrogen. Kerboua et al. [24] have also investigated theoretically the effect of saturating gases (Ar and O2) on the sonolysis of methanol, where a maximal molar yield was retrieved for a solution containing 40% of methanol in spite of the amount of argon. Additionally, Kerboua et al. [24] showed that the highest molar production is obtained through a concentration of 40% (v/v) for methanol and molar fraction of 40% for argon. In another theoretical study, Kerboua et al. [21] found that the best combination for hydrogen production and methanol conversion is obtained for a solution containing 20% (v/v) of methanol saturated with 70% molar of argon, where 99.9% of methyl alcohol is eliminated, and 59% of methanol is converted to hydrogen. In general, the theoretical studies performed for methanol sonochemistry adopt a single ambient bubble radius (mean radius) for representing the bubbles population. However, in reality this is not the true situation, because, bubbles population in acoustic field is an interval rather than a single value; the statement which is well proven experimentally through several technics [25–30] and theoretically through different models [25–33]. Besides, because of the dual role of methanol within the bubble (i.e. generator of methyl radicals and quencher of hydroxyl radicals), the active bubbles population in the sonochemical reactor may be greatly modified due to the change of the sono-activity of individual cavities. In another word, methanol sonochemistry can affects one of the most significant features of the cavitation field, which is the size of active bubbles. This problem was never addressed previously, neither experimentally nor theoretically. The determination of the population of active bubbles has a great importance, because if this range is properly determined, it will be facile to study the bubbles effects and their interactions with the acoustic irradiation [34]. In fact, the bubble temperature, and so the bubble sono-activity, are strongly affected by the ambient bubble size (i.e., R0) [32,33,35]. Therefore, based on the chemical mechanisms adopted by Kerboua et al. [21,24] for methanol pyrolysis and combustion inside acoustic cavitation, the present study attempts to reveal, for the first time, the effect of methanol concentration [% (v/v)] on the range of active bubbles for hydrogen production and methyl alcohol conversion. However, in our work, some important chemical reactions such as water dissociation and methane formation (i.e. ignored in the Kerboua et al.’s mechanism) were added for an accuracy approach. Model The mathematic model we used combined in one part the bubble dynamics and the energy balance equations developed by Yasui [36–38] and, in another part, the Toegel model [39,40] for heat transfer, as well as the Hertz-Knudsen model for mass transport [41]. Additionally, an improved chemical kinetics mechanism for methanol pyrolysis within the bubble is adopted, where many essential chemical reactions for water sonolysis and methane formation were added to the Kerboua et al.’s [21,24] reaction scheme. These combinations provide an excellent prediction of the experimental bubble temperature and the yields of H2, CH2O and CO over a wide range of methanol concentration, as it will be seen in Section 3.1. In addition, our model fitted perfectly the Yasui’s bubble dynamics at 140 kHz (please see Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Material ). The model’s detail is presented below. The model is built on a set of ordinary differential equations that account for non-equilibrium evaporation and condensation of water vapor and methanol at the bubble wall, thermal conduction (i.e. heat transfer) both within and outside a bubble and chemical reactions (i.e. heats of reactions are incorporated). Interactions between bubbles are ignored. All numerical simulations were carried out for a single bubble oscillating in O2 and/or argon-saturated water with varying amounts of methanol. Bubble temperature, bubble pressure, bubble radius and bubble wall velocity can be calculated at any time during the bubble oscillation. The radial dynamics of the bubble is described by the following form of the Keller-Miksis equation [36]: (1) 1 - R ̇ C + m ̇ C ρ L R R ¨ + 3 2 R ̇ 2 1 - R ̇ 3 C + 2 m ̇ 3 C ρ L = 1 ρ L 1 + R ̇ C P B t - P A s i n 2 π f t + R C - P ∞ + m ¨ R ρ L 1 - R ̇ C + m ̇ C ρ L + m ̇ ρ L R ̇ + m ̇ 2 ρ L + R ̇ m ̇ 2 C ρ L + R C ρ L d P B dt where t is time, dots (●) signifies time derivative (d/dt), R is the radius of the bubble, ρL is the density of the liquid, C is the speed of sound in the liquid, m ̇ is the net rate of evaporation of water vapor and methanol per unit area and unit time and P∞ is the static pressure (1 atm). PA is connected to the acoustic intensity Ia by: PA= (2Ia ρ L C)1/2 . The liquid pressure PB(t) exerted on the external side of the bubble wall is related to the internal bubble pressure P(t) as [42]: (2) P B t = P t - 2 σ R - 4 μ R ̇ R σ and µ are is the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid, respectively. The van der Waals equation (Eq. (3)) is used for calculating the internal bubble pressure P(t) : (3) P t = n R g T V - n b + a n 2 V 2 a and b are the Van de Waals constants (calculated as functions of O2, Ar, H2O and CH3OH as in [43,44]), T is the temperature inside the bubble, Rg is the universal ideal gas constant and V is the bubble volume [4/3(πR3)]. The mass flux of evaporation and condensation of H2O and CH3OH at the interface is expressed using Hertz-Knudsen formula derived from kinetic theory of gases [41]: (4) m ̇ i = a P s a t _ i R - P vi 2 π T [ R ] R g M i i = H 2 O, C H 3 OH Psat_i [R] is the saturation pressure of water or methanol (calculated by using Antoine’s equation as in [45,46]) at the interface temperature T[R] = Tliq , PV is the vapor pressure (H2O or CH3OH) within the bubble. Mi is the molecular weight of H2O or CH3OH and α is the accommodation coefficient (for both H2O and CH3OH), given as [21]: (5) a = a = 0.35 , f o r T ≤ 350 K 0.35 - 0.05 T 50 - 7 2 + 0.025 T 50 - 7 T 50 - 8 a = 0.05 , f o r T ≥ 500 K T 50 - 9 , f o r 350 ≤ T ≤ 500 K Heat transfer through the bubble wall is calculated as [40]: (6) Q ̇ = 4 π 2 R λ mix T liq - T ξ (7) ξ = m i n R π , R χ R ̇ λmix, χ and L t h are the heat conductivity, thermal diffusivity of the gas mixture and the thickness of the thermal boundary layer respectively. λmix is estimated by [47]: (8) λ mix = ∑ λ i ( T ) n i n t Where λi(T) is the thermal conductivity of water vapor, methanol and argon and/or oxygen at temperature T (in K), respectively. λi (in W/m K) of H2O, Ar, O2 and CH3OH are estimated by [42,48,49]: (9) λ H 2 O T = 9.967213 × 10 - 5 T - 1.1705 × 10 - 2 (10) λ Ar T = 3.5887 × 10 - 5 T + 6.81277 × 10 - 3 (11) λ C H 3 O H T = 1.02 × 10 - 4 T - 0.0161 (12) λ O 2 T = 6.4478 × 10 - 5 T + 7.2211 × 10 - 3 The temperature in the bubble is calculated as [50]: (13) T = E + a n 2 V C v n t where E is the internal energy of the bubble, nt is the total number of moles inside the bubble, V is the bubble volume and Cv is the molar heat of the gases and vapor within the bubble [Cv = (3/2)Rg for monoatomic gases (Ar, He…), (5/2)Rg for diatomic gases (H2,O2…) and (6/2)Rg for the other gases]. The variation of the internal bubble energy (ΔE) in time (Δt) as a result of the pressure work, heat of chemical reactions within the bubble, energy transported by water and methanol molecules by evaporation and condensation and heat exchange by thermal conduction at the bubble interface, is given by [38]: (14) Δ E = - P t Δ V t + 4 π R 2 Δ t m ̇ M H 2 O e H 2 O + m ̇ M C H 3 O H e C H 3 O H + 4 π R 2 Δ t λ T liq - T ξ - 4 3 π R 3 Δ t ∑ i = 1 n Δ H i r i In Eq. (14), ΔHi and ri are the enthalpy change and the rate of the ith reaction, respectively, and eH2O and eCH3OH are the energy transported by 1 mol of an evaporating or condensing water vapor and methanol, which are expressed by: (15) e i = C v , i T i = H 2 O , CH 3 OH"
1,Internal bubble chemistry,"1.1 Internal bubble chemistry The reaction scheme given in Table 1 is considered in the absence of methanol. It is composed of 38 reversible chemical reactions involving H2O, H•, O, •OH, HO2 •, H2O2, H2 and O2 chemical species. For a bubble initially containing methanol in addition to argon and water vapor, a chemical kinetics consisting in 32 chemical reactions (Table 2 ) is taken into account, involving H2O, H•, O, •OH, HO2 •, H2O2, H2, O2, CH3OH, CH3O•, CH3 •, CH2OH•, CH2O, HCO•, CO, CO2 and CH4 molecules. For a bubble initially containing methanol in addition to argon, oxygen and water vapor, a chemical kinetics consisting in 32 chemical reactions (Table 3 ) is taken into account, involving the same species as in Table 2. It should be noted that the chemical reactions involved in Tables 2 and 3 are validated from static, flow and shock-tube reactors [51,52]. From a theoretical viewpoint many chemical reactions are expected through the pyrolysis and combustion of methanol. This has been demonstrated by various works [51–53]. However, in sonochemistry and inside the bubble (an effective micro-reactor), the space available for chemical reactions is quite different (small and varying volume), in addition the time available for chemical reactions is very short (a few nanoseconds, as in Fig. 1 ). Moreover, other phenomena are expected such as heat exchange, variation of reactor volume, segregation of vapor and gas content of bubble, light emission … [43]. Consequently, it is deduced that the acoustic cavitation is a different environment for chemical reactions; therefore, depending on the initial composition of bubble, the kinetical mechanism is very limited [43]. The present chemical mechanisms used in our study (Tables 2 and 3) are principally inspired from the reduced mechanisms of Seiser et al. [51] and Norton and Dryer [52], which are in good agreement with the experimental results validated by static, flow and shock tube reactors. It should be noted that methane formation (from CH3) is considered in Tables 2 and 3. On the other hand, the mechanisms of Tables 2 and 3 are supported by the experimental sonolytic results of Buttner et al. [11] and Mizukoshi et al. [15]. According to the experimental study of Buttner et al. [11], the typical pyrolysis (sonolysis) products of methanol detected under argon atmosphere are: H2, CH2O, CO, CH4 and traces of C2H4 and C2H6 (very low yielding), whereas, under oxygen atmosphere, the typical products of methanol combustion inside the bubbles are: CO2, CO, HCOOH, CH2O, H2O2 and traces of H2. On the other hand, Mizukoshi et al. [15], shows that in presence of argon as a saturating gas, the detected products of methanol pyrolysis are: H2 (main product), CO, CH4 and aldehydes. More interestingly, schemes of Table 2 and 3 are validated by the comparison of our results for the production of H2, CH2O and CO to those obtained experimentally by Buttner et al. [11] and theoretically by Kerboua et al. [24] at 1 MHz (see Fig. 2 ). Additionally, the efficacy of our chemical mechanism was asserted through the confrontation of our bubble temperatures to those obtained experimentally by Rae et al. [54] for a range of methanol concentration from 0 to 500 mM, where a good accordance is observed between our results and the Rae et al.’s results (Fig. 3 ). The chemical kinetics model by which the reaction schemes of Tables 1-3 are involved in the bubble dynamics is provided in detail in our previous work [55]. The water vapor and methanol change with time inside the bubble, due to the evaporation and condensation at the bubble wall and due to chemical reactions is given by: (16) dn H 2 O dt = 4 π R 2 m ̇ H 2 O M H 2 O + 4 3 π R 3 U ̇ H 2 O (17) dn CH 3 O H dt = 4 π R 2 m ̇ CH 3 O H M CH 3 O H + 4 3 π R 3 U ̇ CH 3 O H For other species k (except Ar): (18) dn k dt = 4 3 π R 3 U ̇ k where, U ̇ H 2 O , U ̇ CH 3 O H and U ̇ k are the variation rates of H2O, CH3OH, and all other species inside the bubble (except Ar, i.e. inert species) due to chemical reactions involved in Tables 1, 2 and 3. U ̇ k is calculated as: (19) U k ̇ = 1 V d n k dt ∑ i = 1 I υ "" - υ ' r i k = 1 , ⋯ , K where nk is the mole number of the k th species (including H2O and methanol). The rate ri for the i th reaction is given as: (20) r i = k fi ∏ k = 1 K X k υ ' ki - k ri ∏ k = 1 K X k υ "" ki [Xk ] is the concentration of the k th species. If a third body (M) is applicable, Eq. (20) should be multiplied by [∑(αki)(Xk)], (k = 1,…K), where αki is the third body effeciency factor of the k th species in the i th reaction. If it is not stated under Table 1-3, αki = 1 for all substances. The role M is stabilizing chemical products through eliminating the excessive of reaction energy. kfi and kri are the forward and reverse rate constants of the i th reaction, respectively. kfi and kri for the i th reactions are given by the modified Arrhenius law [56]: (21) k fi = A fi T b fi e x p - E a fi R g T (22) k ri = A ri T b ri e x p - E a ri R g T Arrhenius parameters (A, b and E) of each chemical reaction are given in Tables 1-2."
2,Resolution methodology,"1.2 Resolution methodology The nonlinear second-order differential equation of the bubble dynamics (Eq. (1)) has been converted into a system of two differential first-order equations as (23) dR dt = R ̇ (24) d R ̇ dt = 1 ρ L 1 + R ̇ C P B t - P A s i n 2 π f t + R C - P ∞ + m ¨ R ρ L 1 - R ̇ C + m ̇ C ρ L + m ̇ ρ L R ̇ + m ̇ 2 ρ L + R ̇ m ̇ 2 C ρ L + R C ρ L d P B dt - 3 2 R ̇ 2 1 - R ̇ 3 C + 2 m ̇ 3 C ρ L 1 - R ̇ C + m ̇ C ρ L R Equations (13), (14), (16), (17), (18), (23) and (24) are solved using finite difference method. The outputs of these equations are the variation of bubble temperature, pressure, radius and wall velocity as well as the quantities (mole numbers) of all species (except argon, which is chemically inert) in the bubble, all along the bubble oscillation (with respect to time). The initial pressures of Ar and/or O2, H2O and CH3OH inside the bubble fulfill the equilibrium relation: P0 = P∞ +2σ/R0 , where P0 is the internal bubble pressure (Pv,0 + P CH3OH ,0 + Pi,0 ) at equilibrium, R = R0 (Pi,0: initial gas pressure, i = Ar, O2). The initial pressure of CH3OH within the bubble is governed by Raoult’s law: P CH3OH ,0 = X CH3OH,0 . P sat,CH3OH ,0 (P sat,CH3OH ,0 = 0.13 bar at 20 °C), where X CH3OH ,0 is the CH3OH mole fraction in the aqueous phase (i.e. from 0 to 1). The water vapor pressure (Pv,0 ) is calculated through Antoine's equation (2.33 kPa at 20 °C [57]). The initial gas pressure Pi,0 is calculated as Pi,0 = P0-(Pv,0 + P CH3OH ,0). Initial mole fractions of CH3OH, H2O and Ar and/or O2 were calculated as Pi,0/P0 , where i = CH3OH, H2O, Ar and O2. Accordingly, the initial bubble composition varies with the CH3OH liquid concentration due to the change in P CH3OH ,0 . For a methanol concentration of 50% (v/v) in the bulk liquid and 50% (mole fraction, inside the bubble) of argon (at 20 °C), initial mole fractions of CH3OH, H2O, Ar and O2 were 0.029 (2.9%),0.017 (1.7%), 0.477 (47.7%) and 0.477 (47.7%), respectively."
3,Results and discussions,"Throughout this work, the word “efficiency” is reserved for the comparison of H2 production and CH3OH conversion (in mol) [and the wideness of R0’s range] at different molar concentrations of argon (or oxygen) inside the bubble and volumetric concentrations of CH3OH in the solution. Therefore, the maximal efficiency is observed when the maximal molar production of H2 and CH3OH conversion (and the largest of R0’s range) is obtained at a determined molar fraction of argon within the bubble and methanol concentration in the bulk liquid."
4,Methanol effect on the bubble kinetics,"2.1 Methanol effect on the bubble kinetics Fig. 1(a) shows the evolution of the different species at around the end of the bubble collapse for an argon bubble (Table 1), where the main substances created at this level are H● (5.937 x10-19 mol), ●OH (6.225 x10-19 mol), O (1.539 × 10-20 mol) and H2 (2.98 × 10-20 mol), where the maximum bubble temperature is Tmax = 4600 K. The same trend was obtained by several studies [24,47,55]. The numerical simulations of Fig. 1(a) were given for a bubble oscillates in Ar-saturated water (20 °C) at frequency of 355 kHz and an acoustic intensity of 1 W/cm2. The typical ambient radius of the bubbles is 3.2 µM [29]. For the same conditions, the simulation results for methanol/water solution (10% v/v of CH3OH) is depicted in Fig. 1(b). According to Fig. 1(b), it is clearly observed that the decomposition of methanol inside an argon-saturated bubble (Table 2) modifies completely the chemistry of the bubble (especially around the end of collapse). The important substances are: CH2OH• (2.107 × 10-19 mol), CH2O (1.159 × 10-21 mol), CH3O● (1.717 × 10-20 mol), CH3 ● (5.1 × 10-21 mol), ●OH (7.03 × 10-20 mol), H● (1.617 × 10-20 mol) and H2 (1.4 × 10-19 mol), as calculated at the maximum bubble temperature (Tmax = 3876.4 K). This behavior (modification of bubble chemistry) has been corroborated experimentally by Henglein and Schulz [9], Rassokhin et al. [12] and through other volatile species as it was demonstrated by Henglein [58] in presence of CO2, N2O and CH4. Moreover, a similar trend has been obtained in our previous works [43,44] in the presence of carbon tetrachloride within the acoustic bubble. Compared to the argon bubble, the CH3OH (at 10% v/v) decreases the Tmax by 15.73% [from 4600 K to 3876 K, Fig. 1(a)-(b)]. Note that the time scale in Fig. 1(a) is only 0.006 µs (from 0.155 to 2.161 µs) and in Fig. 1(b) is 0.0014 µs (from 2.2585 to 2.2599 µs), at around the end of the bubble collapse. As a result, the temperature profile is always superior to 1500 K. However, if we reveal the complete view of the bubble temperature profile we get the plots of Figs. S2(a) and S2(b) of the Supplementary Material . These figures show clearly that bubble temperature goes up gradually from 293.15 K and comes back to this lower temperature (293.15 K) after attaining its maximum depending on the chemical composition of the acoustic bubble. Fig. 1(b) shows clearly the increase (by 4.7 times) of hydrogen production compared to the case where methanol is absent in the bulk solution (Fig. 1(a)). In addition, the yield of hydroxyl radicals decreased by 8.85 times due to the scavenging effect of methyl alcohol within the acoustic cavitation (Reactions (4) and (5) in Table 2). The results depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (b) indicate the plausible modification of the range of active bubbles for hydrogen yield (targeted species) because of the dissociation of methyl alcohol inside the bubble. This effect will be analyzed with respect to the optimum amount of methanol (in solution) and argon and oxygen in the bubble. Before discussing the different results obtained in our work, we would like to firstly compare the normalized production of H2, CH2O and CO for an Ar-CH3OH-bubble (Table 2) to those found theoretically by Kerboua et al. [24] and experimentally by Buttner et al. [11] at 1000 kHz (In: 2 W/cm2). In Fig. 2(a)-(d) the normalized yields of H2, CH2O and CO are given over a range of 0 to 80 % (v/v) for an aqueous solution of methanol. As it can be seen, the outputs of our chemical mechanism (Ar-CH3OH-bubble, Table 2) are in good concordance with those obtained by Kerboua et al. [24] and Buttner et al. [11] for the whole range of methanol volume concentration (0–80%). For example, in the case of our study and that of Kerboua et al.’s work [24], the maximal production of hydrogen is obtained at ∼ 15% of methanol in solution, whereas this optimum is shifted to ∼ 5% for the experimental work of Buttner et al. [11] (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, the maximal yield of formaldehyde and monoxide of carbon are observed at ∼ 30% and 10%, respectively, as it is observed from the experimental results of Buttner’s group [11] (Fig. 2(b) and (c)). However, the optimums of these species (CH2O and CO, respectively) are obtained at around ∼ 20% for Kerboua et al. [24] and ∼ 15% according to our results. These optimums [Fig. 2(a)-(d)] are due to the fact that when methanol concentration increased, bubble temperature goes down, however, the yield of the different species continues to be increased. Nevertheless, after certain concentration of methanol, the lower temperature inside the bubble is unable to ensure the increase of the different substances production, therefore, optimum productions (of the different species) are created. On the other hand, Fig. 3(a) shows a good agreement between the bubble temperatures found in our study (Table 2) and those obtained experimentally by Rae et al. [54] at 355 kHz in the range of methanol concentration from 0 to 500 mM. These results indicate that our model is accurate for predicting the bubble temperature, and therefore, it can be used with confidence for studying hydrogen recovery from methanol sono-pyrolysis within acoustic bubbles. As it can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the presence of 100 mM of methanol (in the bulk solution) reduces bubble temperature from 4600 to 3930 K (14.56 % of decrease) as a result for the increase of bubble heat capacity (presence of CH3OH) and the endothermal dissociation of methanol. However, the increase of methyl alcohol concentration (from 100 to 500 mM) has practically no effect on the maximal bubble temperature (Tmax ∼ 3900 K). This is probably owing to the lower concentrations adopted by Rae et al. [54]. For this reason, we extended the evolution of the bubble temperature over the whole range of methanol concentration in solution [0–100 % (v/v)] (Fig. 3(b)). As it was expected, the increase of methanol concentration in the bulk liquid has a negative impact on the peak temperature of our acoustic cavitation, where the maximal temperature goes down gradually from 4600 (0% of CH3OH) to 2941 K (100% of CH3OH)."
5,Optimal conditions for the maximal hydrogen yielding and methanol conversion,"2.2 Optimal conditions for the maximal hydrogen yielding and methanol conversion In order to reveal the effect of methanol on the range of active bubbles (in term of R0) for hydrogen production, the ideal conditions of bubble composition (argon amount) should be determined for the purpose to get a clear view of methanol impact on the range of active bubbles, and obtain the initial composition of liquid and acoustic cavitation giving the maximum efficiency. According to several experimental works [59–62], the maximal activity of the bubble is obtained at around 355 kHz. Therefore, the ultrasound frequency is kept fixed at 355 kHz (In = 1 W/cm2). Fig. 4 (a)-(d) show the evolution of the bubble temperature (Tmax), hydrogen production, maximal methanol conversion and the total yield of the bubble, respectively. From Fig. 4(a), it can be observed that the bubble temperature is increased proportionally with the rise of argon amount inside the bubble or through the reduction of methanol volume fraction in solution (especially over 10% (v/v) of methanol in the bulk liquid). For example, in the absence of methanol, the increase of the initial argon percentage in the bubble from 0 to 100% causes the maximal cavitation temperature to be increased from 2806 to 4540 K. Nevertheless, for a methanol solution (100% CH3OH), bubble temperature increases from 2009 to 2942 K for the same interval of argon quantity (0 to 100%). On the other hand, for hydrogen production, methanol conversion and the total yield of the bubble (Fig. 4(b)-(d)), optimum points are observed at 80%, 60–80% and 80% of argon mole fraction (inside the bubble), respectively, for the majority of methanol concentrations. The maximal conversion of methanol (1.38 × 10-17 mol) is retrieved at 3% (v/v) of CH3OH and 70% of argon mole fraction (Fig. 4(c)), which corresponds to 9.46 × 10-19 mol for the maximal production of hydrogen (Fig. 4(b)). On the other hand, the maximal yield of hydrogen is obtained at 7% (v/v) of methanol and 80% of argon (mole fraction) with a value of 1.13 × 10-18 mol (19.45% of increase compared to the previous case, Fig. 4(b)). This production (1.13 × 10-18 mol) corresponds to 1.3 × 10-17 mol of methanol conversion, giving a decrease of 5.79% compared to the previous case (1.38 × 10-17 mol) (Fig. 4(c)). For the total yield of acoustic cavitation (Fig. 4(d)), it is observed that the majority of maximum productions are obtained at 80 % (mole fraction) of argon inside the bubble over the whole range of methanol concentration (0–100% (v/v)). It should be noted that according to Fig. 4(c)-(d), in general, the total yield of the bubble is slightly lower than the maximal conversion of methanol. This is ascribed to the conversion of a small amount of methanol to water (during the compression phase) which in turn is condensed during the strong collapse (lost). The analyzation of Fig. 4(b)-(d) indicates that the maximal efficiency of the bubble is obtained at 80% of argon (20% oxygen), where the best combination for the maximal hydrogen production (1.13 × 10-18 mol) and methanol conversion (1.3 × 10-17 mol) is observed at 7% (v/v) of methanol and 80% of argon. At this level, hydrogen production (1.13 × 10-18 mol) is increased by 32.7 times compared to the maximal value obtained in absence of methanol (and 100% Ar), which is equal to 3.46 × 10-20 mol. It is worth mentioning that the obtained optimal composition of bubble in saturating gases (80% Ar and 20% O2) is in line with various experimental studies [61,63–65] investigating the sonoactivity of acuostic bubble. Fig. 4(b)-(d) confirm also that the concentration of methanol (in solution) can be increased until 20%, where the yield of hydrogen is increased by 26.16 (9.05 × 10-19 mol) and 22.4 (7.74 × 10-19 mol) times at 10% and 20% of methanol, respectively, compared to the case in absence of methanol (and 100% Ar). At 10% and 20% (v/v) of methanol in the bulk solution, its conversion inside the bubble decreased by 13.84% (1.12 × 10-17 mol) and 22.3 % (1.01 × 10-17 mol), respectively, compared to the maximal conversion registered at 7% (1.3 × 10-17 mol). More information could be obtained by the analyzation of the whole range of active bubbles (detailed in the next section)."
6,Effect of methanol on the range of active bubbles for hydrogen production,"2.3 Effect of methanol on the range of active bubbles for hydrogen production From Fig. 5 (a) and (b) it can be observed that for methanol concentrations (in the bulk liquid) lower than 10%, some fluctuation is observed either for the maximal conversion of methanol or for the maximal yield of hydrogen. As it was pointed out in the previous section, where the best combination (maximal production of hydrogen and conversion of methanol) is obtained at 7% of methanol (and 80% of argon) in the aqueous solution. Fig. 5(a) and (b) indicate clearly the possibility of extension of this concentration to 20% (v/v) of methanol (and 80% of Ar). Over this amount (20% of CH3OH), a relatively rapid decrease of the maximal yield of hydrogen and methanol conversion is recorded. For example, at 30% (v/v) of methanol, the maximal production of hydrogen (5.72 × 10-19 mol) and methanol conversion (8.32 × 10-18 mol) are reduced by 49.4% and 36%, respectively, compared to those values obtained at 7% of methanol (1.13 × 10-18 and 1.3 × 10-17 mol for H2 production and CH3OH conversion, respectively). This decrease goes up to 89.4% and 77.92% respectively for H2 production (1.2 × 10-19 mol) and CH3OH conversion (2.87 × 10-18 mol) for methanol concentration of 80% (v/v) in the bulk liquid. This behavior is owing to the fact that when the amount of methanol is increased within the bubble, heat capacity of this cavitation is increased which means that the maximal temperature is reduced (Fig. 4 (a)), consequently, the conversion of CH3OH and H2 production go down. This negative impact of methanol was obtained previously in the case of other volatile compounds such as carbon dioxide [66–68] and carbon tetrachloride [44] at different amounts depending on their physical properties. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show that approximately for all methanol concentrations (0–100%), the mean radii (for the maximal yield of hydrogen and methanol conversion) are observed at 3.2 µm, which is in good agreement with that obtained experimentally by Brotchie et al. [29] for sonochemiluminescing bubbles at 355 kHz. In order to reveal the evolution of active bubbles ranges (for H2 production and CH3OH conversion) as function of the amount of methanol in the bulk liquid, Fig. 5(c) shows the normalized wideness of R0 (of active bubbles) ranges for hydrogen yield and methanol conversion as function of methanol concentrations (0–100%). As it can be observed in Fig. 5(c), the variation of methanol amount (volume fraction) in solution seems to have a little impact on the wideness of R0 (active bubbles radii) ranges for methanol conversion, where the normalized wideness of R0 ranges are in the range of 0.9 to 1. The increase of methanol concentration from 1% to 70–80% increases hardly (10% of increase) the range of active bubbles (normalized values vary from 0.9 to 1). At 90% of methanol (in solution) this normalized value goes down to 0.94 (for 100% methanol). At the opposite, hydrogen yielding shows a different behavior compared to that of methanol conversion (Fig. 5 (c)), where the normalized wideness of active bubbles (for H2 production) ranges increases rapidly from 0.5 (0% of CH3OH) to 1 by the introduction of only 1% (v/v) of methanol. This normalized value is slightly decreased (by 4%) when methanol concentration is increased to 20% in the bulk liquid. From this concentration (20%), the normalized wideness of active bubbles ranges (for H2 production) starts to be gradually decreased attaining 0.56 (44% of decrease) for a pure solution of methanol (100% CH3OH). As a recapitulation, Table 4 gives the evolution of R0 ranges for hydrogen yielding (Fig. 5(a)) and methanol conversion (Fig. 5 (b)). The pronounced effect of methanol concentration (in liquid) on the ranges of hydrogen production (decrease with the increase of methanol concentration in liquid) compared to that of methanol conversion (weak impact) is considered as a logical result. Because as it was observed previously for a single bubble (Fig. 4 a) and (c)), in spite of the decrease of bubble temperature with the increase of methanol concentration in solution (for a fixed amount of argon), the molar production of the bubble and methanol conversion persist to be clearly greater than the yielding threshold (4.67 × 10-22 mol). At the opposite, the molar production of hydrogen seems to be more affected by the decrease of bubble temperature as one of the methanol conversion species (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). Therefore, when methanol concentration is increased in the bulk liquid, more bubbles (at the range limits) are supposed to be activated (for methanol conversion) due to the additional amount of methanol present within these bubbles [43], however, the decrease of temperatures in these bubbles makes it difficult to keep the conversion of methanol over the threshold (4.67 × 10-22 mol). Consequently, the range of active bubbles for methanol consumption is hardly increased (Table 4). On the other hand, the increase of methanol concentration in the bulk liquid (and inside bubbles) affects negatively the range of active bubbles for H2 production, where more bubbles are deactivated (smallest and largest bubbles), because with the decrease of these bubbles temperatures it is not possible to keep the quantity of hydrogen produced inside bubbles greater than that of production threshold (4.67 × 10-22 mol). For more comparison, from Fig. 6 (a) and (b), it can be clearly observed that the sonochemical activity is reduced by the increase of argon mole fraction inside bubbles to 100%. For example, for hydrogen production, it is shown in Fig. 6(a) that the yield of hydrogen is decreased (compared to the previous case Fig. 5(a)) over the range of active bubbles for all methanol concentrations, where this production is lower than 8.2 × 10-20 mol (for all R0′s). Similarly, the consumption of methanol goes down over the whole range of R0 and for all methanol concentrations (Fig. 6(b)). The maximal conversion is equal or lower than 3.67 × 10-19 mol (for all R0′s). In addition, it is observed in Fig. 6(c) that the wideness of active bubbles either for hydrogen production or for methanol conversion is negatively affected by the increase of methanol concentration (0–100 %). Some exception is registered for methanol concentration equal or lower than 2% (for H2 production and CH3OH conversion) and greater than 90% (for hydrogen production). By comparing Fig. 5 and Fig. 6(a)-(b), it can be concluded that the maximal efficiency in terms of hydrogen production, methanol conversion and the broadness of active bubbles ranges (for H2 yielding and CH3OH conversion) is obtained at 80% of argon (inside bubble) and for methanol concentration between 7 and 20%. This conclusion indicates also that not only the maximal temperature (inside the bubble) is the controlling key for the sonoactivity of the bubble but also the amounts of oxygen, argon and volatile solutes encapsulated within the bubble (see section 3.2)."
7,Energetic cost,"2.4 Energetic cost In order to evaluate the energetic cost of our sono-system, it is necessary to know the number of bubbles generated within the sono-reactor. According to the semi-empirical technique of Merouani et al. [69], the number of active bubbles under a wave frequency of 355 kHz is ∼ 2.8428 × 107 bubble/L s. On the other hand, according to Fig. 1(b), the amount of methanol converted per one acoustic bubble (at 355 kHz, In = 1 W/cm2) during one cycle is 2.137 × 10-14 mol. Therefore, the amount of methanol converted per unit volume per unit time is 6.075 × 10-7 mol/L s, if it supposed that bubbles are fragmented at the first collapse. Now, if we suppose that we have a reactor with the following dimensions: volume V = 10-2 m3 and section S = 5 × 10-3 m2 (i.e. a Lab-scale reactor), this means that our power density (Pd) in the sono-reactor is 290.9 W/L [Pd= (Pa 2. S)/(2 × ρL × C × V)], where P a = 2 I C ρ L (ρL is the mass density of the liquid and C is the sound velocity in the liquid). As a result, we have a power density of 290.9 J/s L and a molar conversion of methanol of 6.075 × 10-7 mol/ L s in the whole reactor. This means that our energetical consumption is 7.54 × 10-3 mol/kWh for an acoustic intensity of 1 W/cm2 under a frequency of 355 kHz."
8,Conclusion,"This paper gives a special focus on the impact of methanol concentration (in the bulk liquid) on the range of active bubbles for hydrogen production and methanol conversion by sonolysis. It was demonstrated that the dissociation of methanol within bubbles is able to completely modify the chemistry of these cavities (at the end of collapse) as well as the range of active bubbles for the yield of hydrogen and methanol conversion. It has been observed that the maximal sonochemical efficiency of bubbles is obtained at 80% of argon (inside the bubble), where the best combination for the maximal H2 production and CH3OH conversion is obtained at 7% (v/v) of methanol and 80% of argon. In addition, it has been shown that it is possible to increase the concentration of methanol (in solution) until 20% without highly affecting the bubble activity. On the other hand, it was obtained that the variation of methanol concentration [0–100% (v/v)] has a little effect on the wideness of active bubbles ranges for methanol conversion. In contrast, a different behavior is observed for the production of hydrogen, where a gradual decrease of the active bubbles ranges is obtained for methanol concentrations greater than 20%. It has been concluded that the maximal efficiency for the production of hydrogen, wideness of active bubbles ranges (for H2 production and CH3OH conversion) and methanol conversion is obtained at 80% of argon and for methanol concentration between 7 and 20%. Additionally, this work shows clearly that the sonoactivity of bubbles is not only controlled by the maximal temperatures attained inside these cavities, but also by the amounts of saturating gases (e.g. O2, Ar…) and volatile solutes housed within these bubbles. Finally, the simulations performed in the present paper are aiming principally to reveal the effect of CH3OH on the range of active bubbles for H2 production and methanol conversion. Therefore, as it is clarified, the best combinations of bubble composition (80% Ar and 20% O2) and liquid concentration in methanol (7–20 % (v/v)) are determined. This means that our theoretical simulations give the first contribution to the practical side of sonochemistry in terms of hydrogen production and methanol conversion by ultrasound. Additionally, the discussed results (variation of R0 range for H2 production and CH3OH conversion) in the present paper are treated for the first time, consequently, our work is considered as a guideline for increasing the efficacy of hydrogen production in a sonochemical reactor."
