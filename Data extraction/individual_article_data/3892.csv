0,Introduction,"Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a problem of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by mucosal damage secondary to pepsin and gastric acid secretion [1]. PUD has been considered the principal leading cause of death in both advanced and developing countries [2]. It is well known that ethanol is mainly metabolized via alcohol dehydrogenases to form acetaldehyde and acetate, which present prominent toxic effects on the gastrointestinal tract [3]. The administration of ethanol generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide [4]. Thus, over-production of ROS plays a key role in the pathophysiological changes in cell membrane fatty acid composition, resulting in the increase of lipid peroxidation and the depletion of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, such as SOD, CAT, and GPx [5]. However, there is evidence to suggest that the oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants can be considered as a crucial part in ethanol-induced mucosal damage [6,7]. In this respect the medicinal plant extracts well known for their antioxidant properties are widely used to investigate their gastroprotective effects [8–10]. Chamomile [Matricaria recutita L. (Asteraceae)] is one of the most widely used and well-documented medicinal plants in the world [11]. It has been included for centuries in the pharmacopeia in many countries such as Tunisia. Owing to its antioxidant [12] and its anti-inflammatory [13] properties, chamomile extracts exhibit many beneficial health effects as anti-allergic [14], neuro-protective [15], antimicrobial [16] and anticancer [17] activities. Recently we have shown that chamomile decoction extract protects against diarrhea and then gastrointestinal oxidative stress induced by acute oralcastor oil administration in rat [18]. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the putative gastroprotective role of CDE treatment (10days against both ethanol induced gastric ulcers ethanol-induced oxidative stress. We also studied the possible implication of sulfhydril groups and some intracellular mediators in such protection."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Epinephrine, bovine catalase, 2-thio-barbituric acid (TBA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were from Sigma Chemicals Co (Germany). All other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade."
3,Preparation of chamomile decoction extract,"2.2 Preparation of chamomile decoction extract Chamomile flowers were cultivated from the region of Béja (North-West of Tunisia) during March 2013 and identified by Mrs. Mouhiba Ben-Naceur, professor of taxonomy in the Higher Institute of Biotechnology of Béja-Tunisia. The voucher specimens (No. M121) have been deposited in the herbarium of the Higher Institute of Biotechnology of Béja and also in our laboratory of integrated physiology in the Faculty of Sciences of Bizerta. Plant material was thendried in an incubator at 50°C during 72h and powdered in an electric blender. The decoction was made with double distilled water (1/5; w/v) at 100°C during 5min under magnetic agitation and the homogenate was filtered through a colander (0.5mm mesh size). Finally, the obtained extract (CDE) was lyophilized and stored at −80°C until used."
4,Animals and treatment,"2.3 Animals and treatment Healthy adult male Wistar rats (200–220g body weight; 15 weeks old) were purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Tunis and used in accordance with the local ethics committee of Tunis University for the use and care of animals in agreement with the NIH recommendations [19]. They were provided with standard diet (standard pellet diet- Badr Utique-TN) and water ad libitum and maintained in animal house under controlled temperature (22±2°C) with a 12h light-dark cycle. The animals were divided into seven groups of 10 rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls and had a physiological solution (NaCl, 0.9%, p.o.). Groups 3, 4, and 5 were pre-treated with various doses of CDE (25, 50, and 100mg/kg, b.w. p.o.) while groups 6 and 7 were pretreated respectively with famotidine (20mg/kg, b.w. p.o.) and ascorbic acid (250mg/kg, b.w. p.o.). A total of seventy rats were pretreated for 10days. They were fasted for 24h before the administration of CDE or reference molecules. After 2h, each of them, except those of groups 1 and 2, was intoxicated by acute administration of EtOH (4g/kg, b.w. p.o.). Sixty min later, animals were sacrificed. Blood sample was collected in heparinized tubes. After centrifugation at 3000g for 15min, plasma was processed to determine the free-iron, H2O2 and calcium level."
5,Evaluation of gastric mucosal damage,2.4 Evaluation of gastric mucosal damage The stomach was removed from each rat and opened along its greater curvature. The tissue was gently rinsed in NaCl 0.9%. The lesions in the gastric mucosa were macroscopically examined and the photographs of hemorrhagic erosions were acquired with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Ulcer indexes were calculated as the sum of the lengths of the whole gastric lesions (in mm2). A blind measurement of lesion lengths was performed by two independent observers.
6,Stomach mucosa preparation,"2.5 Stomach mucosa preparation After the macroscopic analyses, the gastric mucosa was rapidly excised and homogenized in phosphate buffer saline (KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 50mM, pH 7.4) with Potter–Elvehjem homogenizers. After centrifugation (10 000g for 10min at 4°C), supernatant was used for biochemical determination of protein, free iron, H2O2, calcium, SH- groups, MDA and antioxidant enzyme activities."
7,Histopathological analysis,"2.6 Histopathological analysis Immediately after the acrifice, samples of stomach were harvested and washed with ice-cold saline. Tissue fragments were then fixed in a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraffin and used for histopathological examination; 5μm thick sections were cut, deparaffinized, hydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The gastric sections were examined in a blind fashion in all treatments."
8,Lipid peroxidation measurement,"2.7 Lipid peroxidation measurement Gastric mucosa lipid peroxidation was determined by MDA measurement according to the double heating method [20]. Briefly, aliquots from gastric mucosa homogenates were mixed with BHT-TCA solution containing 1% BHT (w/v) dissolved in 20% TCA (w/v) and centrifuged at 1000g for 5min at 4°C. The supernatant was blended with 0.5N HCl 120mM TBA in 26mM Tris and then heated at 80°C for 10min. After cooling the absorbance of the resulting chromophore was determined at 532nm by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 640B). MDA levels were determined by using an extinction coefficient for MDA-TBA complex of 1.56 105 M−1 cm−1."
9,Antioxidant enzyme activity assays,"2.8 Antioxidant enzyme activity assays The activity of SOD was determined using modified epinephrine assays [21]. At alkaline pH, superoxide anion O2 − caused the autoxidation of epinephrine to adenochrome; while competing with this reaction, SOD decreased the adenochrome formation. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of the extract that inhibits the rate of adenochrome formation by 50%. Enzyme extract was added in 2mL reaction mixture containing 10μL of bovine catalase (0.4U/μl), 20μL epinephrine (5mg/ml) and 62.5mM sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer pH 10.2. Changes in absorbance were recorded at 480 nm. The activity of CAT was assessed by measuring the initial rate of H2O2 disappearance at 240nm [22]. The reaction mix contained 33mm H2O2 in 50mm phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and the activity of CAT calculated using the extinction coefficient of 40mM−1cm−1 for H2O2. The activity of GPx was quantified by the procedure of Flohé and Günzler [23]. Briefly, 1mL of reaction mixture containing 0.2mL of gastric mucosa supernatant, 0.2mL of phosphate buffer 0.1M pH 7.4, 0.2mL of GSH (4mM) and 0.4mL of H2O2 (5mM) was incubated at 37°C for 1min and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5mL TCA (5%, w/v). After centrifugation at 1500g for 5min, aliquot (0.2mL) from supernatant was combined with 0.5mL of phosphate buffer 0.1M pH 7.4 and 0.5mL DTNB (10mM) and absorbance was read at 412nm. The activity of GPx was expressed as nmol of GSH consumed/min/mg protein."
10,Thiol groups measurement,"2.9 Thiol groups measurement The total concentration of thiol groups (-SH) was performed according to Ellman's method [24]. Briefly, aliquots from stomach mucosa were mixed with 100μL of 10% SDS and 800μL of 10mM phosphate buffer (pH 8), and the optical density was measured at 412nm (A0). Then, 100μL of DTNB were added and then incubated at 37°C during 60min. After incubation, the absorbance of the sample was quantified at 412nm (A1). The thiol group concentration was calculated from A1 to A0 subtraction using a molar extinction coefficient of 13.6×103 M−1 ×cm−1. The results were expressed as nmol of thiol groups per milligrams of protein."
11,H2O2 determination,"2.10 H2O2 determination The gastric mucosa H2O2 level was performed according to Dingeon et al. [25]. Briefly, the hydrogen peroxide reacts with p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of peroxidase leading to the formation of quinoneimine that has a pink color detected at 505nm."
12,Iron measurement,"2.11 Iron measurement Gastric mucosa and plasma non-heme iron were measured colorimetrically using ferrozine as described by Leardi et al. [26]. Briefly, the iron dissociated from transferrin-iron complex by a solution of guanidine acetate was reduced by ascorbic acid and reacted with ferrozine leads to the formation of pink complex measured at 562nm."
13,Calcium determination,"2.12 Calcium determination Gastric mucosa and plasma calcium were performed using a colorimetric method according to Stern and Lewis [27]. Briefly, at alkaline medium, calcium reacts with cresolphtalein leading to color complex measurable at 570nm."
14,Protein determination,2.13 Protein determination Protein concentration was defined according to Hartree [28] which is a slight change of the Lowry method. Serum albumin was used as standard.
15,Statistical analysis,"2.14 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and were expressed as means±standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant."
16,Results,
17,Macroscopic examination of the CDE effect on EtOH-induced gastric mucosa injuries,"3.1 Macroscopic examination of the CDE effect on EtOH-induced gastric mucosa injuries Data from Fig. 1 shows the macroscopic examination of gastric mucosa after EtOH, CDE and reference molecules administration. As expected, EtOH (4g/kg b.w.) administration induced a marked gastric ulceration. However, CDE (25, 50 and 100mg/kg; b.w.) pre-handling, significantly and does-dependently protected against gastric mucosal damage caused by alcohol administration (Fig. 1). On the other hand, quantitative analyses showed that pre-treatment with CDE, at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, exhibited significant reduction of gastric lesions (ulcer index) with protection percentage of 46.77%, 63.30% and 90.95%, respectively when compared to EtOH group. However, sub-acute pretreatment with famotidine or ascorbic acid significantly protects against EtOH induced gastric mucosal damage (81.13% and 73.12%, respectively) (Table 1 )."
18,Histopathological examination of the CDE effect on EtOH-induced gastric mucosa injuries,"3.2 Histopathological examination of the CDE effect on EtOH-induced gastric mucosa injuries The stomach of the control section showed normal histologic features while following EtOH administration it revealed the prominent and severe gastric mucosal damage, hemorrhagic erosion, edema and leukocytes infiltration of the submucosal layer. pretreatment with CDE, FAM and AA greatly but only partially reduced EtOH-induced gastric structural changes. (Fig. 2 )."
19,Effect of CDE on EtOH-induced oxidative stress in gastric mucosa,"3.3 Effect of CDE on EtOH-induced oxidative stress in gastric mucosa Bearing on the effect of EtOH and CDE on oxidative stress condition, we firstly studied the gastric mucosa lipoperoxidation. As expected EtOH alone dramatically increased the gastric mucosa MDA level while CDE pretreatment significantly and does-dependently reversed alcohol-induced lipid peroxidation (Table 2 ). In this respect, the effect of EtOH and CDE pretreatment on gastric mucosa antioxidant enzyme activities was also investigated and the results are presented in Table 2. EtOH per se significantly decreased gastric antioxidant enzyme activities including SOD (A), CAT (B), and GPx (C). More importantly, CDE pretreatment significantly reversed all EtOH-induced antioxidant enzyme depletion in a dose-dependent manner. Subacute treatment with both famotidine and ascorbic acid protected against alcohol-induced oxidative stress in gastric mucosa."
20,Effect of CDE against EtOH-induced decrease of sulfhydril groups in gastric mucosa,"3.4 Effect of CDE against EtOH-induced decrease of sulfhydril groups in gastric mucosa We further looked at the effect of ethanol and CDE on gastric mucosa sulfhydril group contents. Our results indicated that alcohol treatment significantly decrease gastric thiol groups level. Interestingly, CDE, famotidine or ascorbic acid pre-treatments significantly protected against EtOH-induced sulfhydrils decrease in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 )."
21,"Effect of CDE on EtOH-induced changes in gastric mucosa and plasma H2O2, free iron and calcium levels","3.5 Effect of CDE on EtOH-induced changes in gastric mucosa and plasma H2O2, free iron and calcium levels In the present study, we also examined the effect of Ethanol and CDE on intracellular mediators including hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4 ), free iron (Fig. 5 ) and calcium (Fig. 6 ) levels in the plasma and gastric mucosa tissue. Alcohol per se significantly increased H2O2, free iron and calcium levels in plasma and gastric mucosa. CDE pretreatment significantly and does-dependently protected against EtOH-induced intracellular mediator disturbances. Reference molecules reversed these parameters to near control levels too."
22,Discussion,"The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether chamomile decoction extract (CDE) has a protective effect on ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal damage in rat. We also investigated the implication of oxidative stress, sulfhydril groups and some intracellular mediators such as hydrogen peroxide, free iron and calcium in such gastroprotection. We firstly examined the protective effect of CDE on EtOH-induced macroscopic and microscopic changes in gastric mucosa. We showed that CDE pretreatment significantly protected against alcohol-induced marked morphological and structural changes in gastric mucosa. Based on previous data from rat models, acute ethanol intoxication induced significant lesions and damaging effects on the gastric mucosa severely including hemorrhagic erosion, oedema and leucocytes infiltration of the submucosal layer [29,30]. In addition, ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury is associated with over production of free radicals, which lead to oxidative stress status assessed by increased MDA level and depletion of antioxidant enzyme activities such as SOD, CAT and GPx. MDA, the end-product of lipid peroxidation, is used as a marker of tissue damage [31]. Moreover, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity depletion are considered as reliable biomarkers of the degree of oxidative stress [32]. In this respect, and as there is a close relationship between ROS production and gastric inflammation, we will try in our future project to study the effect of CDE on the pro-inflammatory cytokines production. More importantly, our results showed that CDE significantly attenuated EtOH-induced oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. It indicates that can attenuate the process of lipid peroxidation and/or antioxidant enzymes depletion implicated in the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced gastric damage. EtOH-induced oxidative stress and gastric mucosa injuries have been attenuated by a number of medicinal plant extracts as Opuntia ficus [9], Momordica charantia [33], Brassica oleracea [34] Acacia nilotica [35], Acacia ferruginea [36], Piper aduncum [37] and Amukkara choornam [38]. The results of our studies of CDE revealed the presence of high concentrations of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, and condensed tannins. The use of HPLC-PDA-MS allowed to the identification of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cafeoylquinic acid, salicylic acid, quercetin, quinic acid derivative, hydroxybenzoic acid-O-hexoside, 5,7,4′-Trihydroxy-6,3′-dimethoxyflavone [39]. These phytomolecules have been shown to be responsible for the antioxidant and bio-functional properties of many plant extracts [40]. The antioxidant mechanism of would be due mainly to their redox properties, by allowing them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, free radical quenchers, metal chelators and decomposers of peroxides [41]. In order to combat and neutralize the deleterious effects of ROS, various antioxidant strategies have been proposed for our extract, either by enhancing the non-enzymatic defenses or by increasing the endogenous antioxidant enzyme defenses through dietary or pharmacological means. In fact, Tanigawa et al. reported that quercetin-induced ARE activity involves upregulation of Nrf2 through the regulation of both transcription and posttranscription sites and repression of Keap1 by affecting the posttranscription site in HepG2 cells [42]. In this respect, many studies strongly support the contribution of polyphenols to the prevention of digestive disorder [43]. However, it is well documented that phenolic compounds display a number of pharmacological properties in the GIT area, acting as antisecretory, cytoprotective, and antioxidant agents [9,18,44]. We further looked at the direct or indirect effec of EtOH and CDE on certain intracellular mediators related to oxidative stress status. Unsurprisingly, Alcohol administration significantly increased hydrogen peroxide, free iron and calcium levels in plasma and gastric mucosa tissue. Furthermore, both iron and/or H2O2 accumulation catalyzed the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH.) production via the Fenton reaction leading to membranes lipoperoxidation and enhancement of its permeability to calcium [45]. It seems that calcium homeostasis deregulation have a primal role in the injury induced by acute or chronic alcohol consumption [46,47]. However, it is generally reported that oxidants can cause a rapid increase of the cytoplasm calcium levels in various cell types [48,49]. More importantly, CDE pretreatment significantly attenuated EtOH-induced intracellular mediator deregulation in a dose-dependent manner. The phenolic compound extracts protection against oxidant-induced intracellular mediator deregulation has been previously described for myrtle berries seeds extract [50,51] and CDE [52]. Meanwhile, it’s tempting to speculate that CDE exerts its beneficial effect by chelating free iron and scavenging H2O2 leading to calcium homeostasis. We next sought to determine the putative involvement of sulfhydril groups in the EtOH and CDE mechanism of action. We realized that CDE pretreatment significantly and dose- dependently protected against −SH groups decrease induced by alcohol administration in gastric mucosa. The implication of thiol groups in the loss of integrity of the gastric mucosa has been previously shown for several products capable of inducing ulceration such as absolute ethanol [53], indomethacin [54], aspirin [55] and ketoprofen [56]. However, it is well known that sulfhydryls are partly involved in gastric cytoprotection [57,58], by maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier and scavenging free radicals resulting from noxious agents [59]. Indeed, we can suggest that CDE exerts its beneficial effect by maintaining gastric sulfhydryls as previously described for silymarin [55]."
23,Conclusion,"We have clearly demonstrated that chamomile decoction extract protects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage. The gastroprotection offered by CDE may be related partly to gastric mucosa sulfhydryls safety as well as its antioxidant properties and opposite effect on some intracellular mediators such as free iron, hydrogen peroxide and calcium."
