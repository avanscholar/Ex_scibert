0,Introduction,"The increasing environment pollution associated with global fossil fuels consumption induces the development of clean and renewable energy. Hydrogen is a promising clean energy because of its high heat value and eco-friendly advantages [1,2]. Natural gas steam reforming and coal gasification are traditional methods for hydrogen production in large quantities, along with the discharge of marked environmental hazards [3]. Up to now, water electrolysis is a promising way to produce high-purity hydrogen of 99.999 % [4–8], but the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) results in the high energy loss and thereby slows down its industrial application [9–11]. Recently, replacing anodic OER with carbon oxidation reaction (COR) was proposed and called carbon-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE) [12], which is consisted of the following reactions: (1) a t a n o d e : C + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − (2) a t c a t h o d e : 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 (3) o v e r a l l C + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 H 2 The theoretical thermodynamics potential for carbon oxidation into CO2 (0.21 V) is much smaller than that of OER (1.23 V). The introduction of carbon is possible to reduce the power consumption for hydrogen production to 1/6, since the chemical energy of carbon replaces part of electric input. Carbon-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE) requires much lower cell voltage than water electrolysis, and meanwhile improves carbon-based fuels utilization and reduces the environmental pollution. Moreover, the large amount of wind and light abandon with the development of wind and solar powers can be combined with the CAWE, so as to avoid renewable energy wasting [13,14]. As shown in Fig. 1 , with these carbon-based fuels, clean hydrogen will be generated at the cathode, the anodic CO2 produced through carbon-based fuels oxidation will be used as gasification gas or recaptured by living plants to regenerate biomass [15]. Currently, a variety of carbon-based fuels have been employed to assist water electrolysis for hydrogen production, including coal, biomass, commercial carbon, alcohols, and natural gas, etc. The advantages and disadvantages offered are different by each source. Coal is the cheapest among all the carbon sources [16], but redox ion additives such as Fe2+/Fe3+ in coal slurries are necessary [17,18], and current densities drop markedly over time because of the formation of passive carboxylic compounds on coal surface [19–23]. Liquid alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol-assisted electrolysis are promising since their electro-oxidation is sufficient and stable, but they are expensive sources due to the necessity for their production [24–30]. Biomass-based compounds such as lignin, glucose and starch can be converted into various commodity chemicals, including gluconic acid, gluconate, sorbitol, and glucaric acid, etc [31–35]. But the electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity is urgent due to the poisoning of precious metals. Natural gas used as oxidant on the anode side of solid oxide electrolyte cells requires a high temperature of above 700 °C [36]. It is necessary to explore for other sources of carbon, which possess high electrochemical reactivity and rich source. Later studies on the oxidation of coal and other solid carbon sources during CAWE showed that a higher surface area contributes to a higher current density and hydrogen evolution rate at cathode [15]. The biochar derived from pyrolytic softwood was found an excellent material for high-performance CAWE by Chen et al. [15]. Biochar possesses advantages in physical and chemical properties [37], including large specific surface area, high pore volume, high mineral contents, and enriched surface functional groups [38]. Higher electrochemical reactivity than well-carbonized or graphitized carbon sources such as carbon black and graphite is also expected [15]. Thus, biochar-assisted water electrolysis (BAWE) is an effective way to utilize biomass and achieve high-performance hydrogen production. However, the BAWE is limited by the slow biochar oxidation reaction (BOR) at anode, which is closely related to the chemical structure and composition of biochar. Moreover, apart from the high-temperature pyrolysis method for biochar generation [39], another common thermochemical technique called hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is milder [37]. The carbonization temperature in two techniques alters the physicochemical properties of biochar and thus affects the BOR performance. In this work, two typical carbonization methods including pyrolysis and HTC were used to produce pyrolytic biochar (PB) and hydrothermal biochar (HB) from abundant rice husk in China. Both types of biochar were tested in BAWE for hydrogen production. Anodic BOR was investigated using electrochemical approaches like linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CP). The physicochemical properties of biochar including morphology, structure, and composition related to the carbonization temperature were characterized. Detailed effects of physical and chemical structures, minerals, and electrolyte concentration on BOR were analyzed. At last, the stability of BAWE along with the hydrogen production was examined. The work will open a new avenue to develop more superior carbon-based fuels like biochar for assisting water electrolysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Primary rice husk was collected from farmland in China. Two typical techniques such as HTC and pyrolysis were applied for producing biochar, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Prior to carbonization, samples were dried to be constant weight at 80 °C in an electrical oven. For hydrothermal biochar (HB), the dried rice husk was premixed with deionized water in a mass ratio of 1:12. Subsequently, the slurry was poured into a steel and sealed reactor. The reactor was then put in the electrical oven with the HTC operating temperature ranging from 180 °C to 220 °C. Once 20 h of holding time arrived, the reactor was removed from oven and cooled to ambient temperature. Afterwards, the hydrothermal slurry was dried, ground, and sieved to obtain uniform HB particles within the range of 0–75 μm. The HB derived at different temperatures was denoted as HB180-220. For pyrolytic biochar (PB), the pyrolysis of dried rice husk was carried out in a lab-scale horizontal furnace with a temperature-programmed control system. Before heating the furnace, rice husk was held in a quartz boat and put into the center of furnace. A constant flow of N2 was purged into the furnace as carrier gas. The furnace was heated from room temperature to the pyrolysis temperature (600–900 °C) with a constant heating rate of 10 °C/min, and then held for 2 h. Afterwards, the furnace was quenched under N2 sweeping. The derived PB was ground and sieved to be within 75 μm. The PB derived at different temperatures was denoted as PB600-900. To identify the effects of minerals on the BOR, two acids such as HCl and HF were used to wash out the alkaline and alkaline-earth metals and silicates in biochar, respectively. After pickling, the samples were filtered, washed with deionized water, and finally dried."
3,Electrochemical measurements,"2.2 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with a standard three electrode system, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The platinum plate (10 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm) was used as the working and counter electrodes (WE and CE), and the saturated Hg/Hg2SO4 (MSE) was taken as the reference electrode (RE) considering the acid electrolyte environment. The BAWE was carried out using an H-type electrochemical cell (EC), in which the anode and cathode compartments were separated by a proton-exchange membrane (Nafion 117). Both the anolyte and catholyte were fixed at 80 mL. The basic anolyte was 0.8 g of biochar suspended in an aqueous solution of 1 mol/L H2SO4, corresponding to the biochar concentration of 10 g/L, while the catholyte was the same concentration of H2SO4. For comparison, water electrolysis was a blank test, while the same concentration of coal and carbon black were taken as anolyte and tested in the EC. Both electrolytes were stirred with 700 r/min using a magnetic stirrer. The electrolysis temperature was fixed at 70 °C. The LSV tests for BOR were collected at a scanning rate of 10 mV/s. EIS was performed at the open circuit potential in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 Hz for the BOR with AC amplitude of 20 mV. The stability of overall BAWE along with H2 generation characteristics was evaluated through 10 h chronoamperometry at 2 V by a two-electrode method. A drainage method was used to collect and measure the produced H2."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization The physicochemical characteristics of biochar were characterized using different techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Kα X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with an Al Kα X-ray radiation of 1486.6 eV for excitation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was tested on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Bruker D8 advance powder X-ray Cu Ka radiation diffractometer. N2 adsorption isotherm test was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 to analyze the BET surface area and porous distribution of biochar. Morphology of the samples was characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Comparison of different carbon-based fuels,"3.1 Comparison of different carbon-based fuels The LSV profiles for anodic oxidation of different carbon-based fuels were displayed in Fig. 3 (a). All the LSVs were performed after several cycles to get stable performance. Compared with the onset potential (E onset) for OER (1.2 V vs. MSE) in pure H2SO4 electrolyte, the onset potential for carbon-based fuels oxidation (COR, 0.4–1.0 V vs. MSE) was much lower, indicating the easier of COR than OER, as evidenced by a negatively shifted overpotential and an increased current density. The current densities for anodic oxidation with and without carbon-based fuels are compared and shown in Fig. 3(b). The addition of carbon-based fuel increased the anode current density when the same anode potential was applied, which indicated the advantages of carbon sources in improving water electrolysis and reducing energy input. At low anode potential of within 1.2 V vs. MSE, the corresponding current densities (less than 1 mA/cm2) for HB, coal, and carbon black were comparable, and were a bit higher than that for PB. However, further increasing anode potential to be higher than 1.2 V vs. MSE, the existence of PB at anode significantly improved current density to be larger than 2 mA/cm2. And the current densities for different anolytes follow the order: PB > coal > carbon black > HB > water, which showed that biochar, especially the pyrolytic biochar, was favorable upon anodic oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3(a), in the potential range of 0.4 V–1.0 V vs. MSE, a peak of current density was found for the HB, coal, and carbon black electro-oxidation. This was attributed to the oxidation of dissolved matter in slurry. Previous work found that ferrous ion (Fe2+) in coal was oxidized to Fe3+ at 0.6 V vs. MSE [19], which was in accordance with the variation of coal oxidation in this work. As the carbon black surface is rich in phenolic, quinone, carboxyl groups, etc., the current density for its oxidation at 0.4–1.2 V vs. MSE was higher than water electrolysis. However, the current-potential characteristics for PB and HB were different. The increasing current density for HB oxidation was found at 0.4–1.0 V vs. MSE, while the current density for PB oxidation increased markedly at 1.0 V vs. MSE or higher. Different carbonization method contributed to the different physicochemical property of biochar and thereby the different electrochemical characteristics. Further detailed analyses on biochar oxidation are discussed below."
7,Anodic biochar oxidation,"3.2 Anodic biochar oxidation The carbonization temperature in pyrolysis and HTC processes is a main influencing factor on the morphology, structure, and composition of biochar, which affect the BOR at anode. 3.2.1 Effects of physical and chemical structures of biochar Fig. 4 (a) shows the LSV profiles for the BOR of PB derived at different pyrolytic temperatures. There was no current at anode potential below 0.5 V vs. MSE. A peak current density at 0.6–0.8 V vs. MSE was observed for anode reaction, mostly due to the oxidation of easily oxidized solutes in slurry. The addition of PB reduced the onset potential from 1.2 V vs. MSE for OER to around 1.0 V vs. MSE for BOR. The rising pyrolytic temperature from 600 °C to 800 °C contributed to an earlier onset potential and a higher current density for BOR, but further increasing pyrolytic temperature to 900 °C increased the onset potential and reduced the current density. These were caused by the transformation in physicochemical properties of PB with carbonization temperature, so PB was characterized and presented in Fig. 5 . The SEM images of two typical biochar (PB800 and HB200) in Fig. 5(a), (b) show that more abundant pores existed in PB800 than in HB200, and the pore size of PB800 was smaller than that of HB200, which may be formed during the high-temperature pyrolysis process under the atmosphere of N2. To further analyze the specific surface area and pore width of biochar quantitatively, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured. Fig. 5(c) presents the isotherms of PB800 and HB200, both have hysteresis loops, which can be classified into Type IV isotherm. The H4 type of hysteresis loop for PB800 indicates the abundant microspores and mesopores. An unclosed hysteresis loop can be attributed to the interconnected pore characteristics of carbon particles and the presence of ink bottle holes. The H3 type of hysteresis loop for HB200 reflects the pore structure of flat slit, fissure, etc. The specific surface area (SSA) of biochar was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The SSA of PB600, PB700, PB800 and PB900 are 247.32 m2/g, 255.64 m2/g, 297.48 m2/g and 232.82 m2/g, respectively, while the SSA of HB is less than 20 m2/g. The corresponding pore size distribution based on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was recorded in Fig. 5(d). Most micropores in the range of 2–5 nm can be observed for PB, while massive mesopores in the location of 5–30 nm are found in HB. The average pore sizes for PB800 and HB200 are 1.91 nm and 13.17 nm, respectively. Therefore, the PB has much larger SSA and porosity, which may favor the faster transportation of ions or electrolyte and provide more active sites for BOR. At anode potential of within 1.2 V vs. MSE, pure biochar oxidation occurred without OER. Based on the BET results, the relationship between the SSA of PB and the current density at 0.8 V vs. MSE was evaluated and shown in Fig. 4(b). The increasing pyrolytic temperature from 600 °C to 800 °C increased the SSA of PB and the current density of BOR. A further increase in pyrolytic temperature to 900 °C resulted in pore collapse [37,38] and thereby the decrease of both the SSA and the current density. This correlation suggests that a higher SSA of biochar favors the effective BOR, in accordance with the previous findings [15]. Fig. 4(c) shows LSV profiles for the BOR of HB derived at different HTC temperatures of 180–220 °C. At anode potential of within 1.2 V vs. MSE, a higher current density for HB (∼1 mA/cm2) than PB was found, although the SSA of HB is only ∼5.89 % of PB. The proper increase of HTC temperature contributed to the earlier oxidation of HB and a higher current density for BOR. The HB derived from HTC process usually contains a complicated mixture of liquid and solid. To further determine the reaction mechanism of HB oxidation, the as-produced HB was separated into two parts (HB-liquid and HB-solid). Both materials were characterized by LSV measurement, and presented in Fig. 4(d). A peak current density (>2 mA/cm2) was found for HB-liquid oxidation at lower anode potential of within 1 V vs. MSE, probably due to the existence of easily-oxidized compositions, such as –OH. However, no current density occurred for HB-solid until the anode potential reached 1.1 V vs. MSE. These trends confirmed that the oxidation of soluble materials in HB dominated at lower anode potential, and contributed to a highly effective BOR. Further characterizing the chemical structure of biochar with XPS, FTIR, and XRD. The chemical state of C, O, N were measured, Fig. 5(e), (f) give the C 1s spectrum in PB800 and HB200, in which each binding energy located at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV, 287.9 eV and 292.6 eV is assigned to C–C/CC, C–O, CO/O–C–O and O–CO, respectively. For high-temperature PB, most C is in the state of C–C/CC, the relative content of which reaches 60–75 %. However, the relative content of C–C/CC in HB is less than 60 %, which indicates the stronger aromaticity of PB. A much higher relative content of C–O is found in HB (around 30 %) than in PB (less than 10 %), indicating the abundant functional groups of –OH in HB. Also, more CO/O–C–O in HB is measured, suggesting the existence of acetal, amide, and carboxylate, etc. But negligible O–CO corresponding to –COOH or ester is found in HB. Further compare the ratio of C, O and N of biochar, as shown in Fig. 5(g). Three elements follow the order: C > O > N. The increasing degree of carbonization with carbonization temperature contributes to a higher C content. PB is found to be more abundant in C content, while O content in HB is markedly higher than that in PB. These are caused by the bonding of O in H2O with biochar during the hydrothermal reaction between rice husk and water [37,38]. The molecular structure of biochar was further characterized by FTIR, and the typical FTIR spectra for PB800 and HB200 are plotted in Fig. 5(h). There have different peaks for PB and HB. The peaks of 2927 cm−1, 1602 cm−1 and 1108 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching of –CH3/-CH2, CC in aromatic nucleus and C–O–C, respectively. The –OH stretching is located at 3342 cm−1. More abundant –OH groups are found in HB than in PB, which are in accord with XPS results. The high carbonization temperature during pyrolytic process contributes to the dissociation of the bound water and the gradual breaking of the hydroxyl group bound, while the moderate condition and contact with water in HTC process leave the bond of biochar with –OH. The above trends suggest that the lower carbonization degree of biochar with abundant CO/O–C–O and –OH groups contributed to a higher current density for HB within 1.2 V vs. MSE, but the higher SSA and less oxygen-containing functional groups (OGs) for PB significantly improved the current density at anode potential of more than 1.2 V vs. MSE. The negative influence of OGs are in accord with coal-assisted water electrolysis [17]. 3.2.2 Effects of minerals in biochar The as-prepared biochar from the rice husk is supposed to be rich in minerals, which is an important influencing factor on BOR [17,40,41]. Thus, the biochar was characterized by XRD, and two typical XRD patterns for PB800 and HB200 are presented in Fig. 6 (a), which show similar trends. Two diffraction peaks at 16.5° and 34.6° are assigned to the hydrocarbon compounds, while that at 22.8° and 26.6° correspond to the inorganic salts of Mg, Al, etc. and SiO2, respectively. Results indicate that the biochar is abundant in minerals, especially the HB200 contains higher amounts of silicate. Another peak at 43.79° for PB800 is assigned to carbon, suggesting that the pyrolytic biochar is highly carbonized. The LSV plots for PB800 and HB200 with and without pickling are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c). The negative shift of LSV plots for PB800 was found after pickling, indicating the decline of onset potential for PB800 oxidation. The HCl pickling leaves the exposure of functional groups on the surface of PB800, which favored the BOR and increased its current density at lower anode potential of less than 1.2 V vs. MSE. Further HF pickling removed the silicates, which tend to form passive film on the surface of PB800 during electrolysis. Then an increasing current density for BOR was achieved after HF pickling. On the contrary, the pickling of HB200 meanwhile removed the readily oxidizable functional groups in HB, which dominated in BOR, and thereby increased the onset potential and reduced its current density. 3.2.3 Effects of H2SO4 concentration The H2SO4 is an acid electrolyte for increasing the conductivity of biochar slurry and improving the BOR, along with the transfer of proton through PEM. The LSV profiles for PB800 with changing H2SO4 concentration (C H2SO4) are recorded in Fig. 6(d). As the C H2SO4 increased from 0.5 to 1 mol/L, the onset potential for BOR slightly reduced while the current density increased at anode potential of less than 1.2 V vs. MSE. However, further rising of C H2SO4 to 2 and 3 mol/L resulted in the reduction of current density although the electrolyte conductivity was higher. These was due to that the viscosity of electrolyte increases with rising C H2SO4, and the small size, high SSA, and absorbability of biochar make it hard for particles to diffuse in the electrolyte. As a result, the agglomeration of biochar particles tends to occur at higher C H2SO4, which forms the uneven dispersion of the slurry and thereby disturbs the anodic BOR. 3.2.4 Impedance and kinetic analysis BOR kinetics was characterized using the value of current density, which reflects the electrode reaction rate. The Arrhenius relation between current density and activation energy is shown [22]: (4) j = f e x p ( − E a R T ) where j is current density, A/cm2. f is pre-exponential factor. E a is activation energy, J/mol. R is gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K). T is temperature, K. The above equation was transformed into the logarithmic form: (5) l g j = l g f − E a 2.303 R T Eq. (5) shows a linear relationship between lgj and 1/T. lgj derived from LSV curves measured at different temperatures was plotted as a function of the reciprocal temperature 1/T, which presented a good linearity after linear regression. E a was then determined from its slope. Impedance spectra for the BOR were obtained in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 Hz, as recorded in Fig. 7 (a) and (c). The intersection of the abscissa at high frequencies is assigned to the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, the semicircular arc at medium frequencies is corresponded to the polarization resistance of the electrodes, and the impedance recorded at low frequencies is related to the mass transfer of reactants at anode. An equivalent circuit consisting of an ohmic resistance of electrolyte (Rs), a charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and a constant phase element (CPE) was constructed and presented in Fig. 7(b), (d). Both Rs and Rct showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature. Thus, the temperature dependence of the impedance spectra is likely because of temperature influence on ohmic resistance and polarization. The higher temperature reduces the concentration overpotential of electrolyte and improves the ions conductivity, which decreases the E a and increases the reaction kinetics. The smaller Rs for HB than that for PB revealed good electrical contacts between the electrolyte and electrode. This was attributed to the abundant OGs in HB and high conductivity. On the contrary, the PB oxidation displayed a smaller Rct than that for HB, which indicated favorable electron transport rate and BOR kinetics. This could be due to the well-developed pore structure and excellent reaction performance of PB. Further analyses on PB at 70 °C were conducted with changing pyrolytic temperature and slurry concentration, and the impedance distribution was listed in Table 1 . At the same pyrolytic temperature of 600 °C, the increase of slurry concentration from 5 g/L to 20 g/L resulted in the marked increase of Rs, which was attributed to the uneven distribution of the large amount of biochar and the agglomeration of biochar in the slurry. Meanwhile, the generated bubbles and other products at anode had difficulty in fast-diffusion with increasing biochar particles, and thereby increased the Rct. At low biochar slurry concentration of 5 g/L, the less amount of biochar particles reduced the effective impact area for particles and electrode, leading to a higher Rct than that of 10 g/L. At the same biochar slurry concentration of 10 g/L, the increase of pyrolytic temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C improved the Rs significantly. More abundant pore structure and stronger adsorptive property of biochar with increasing pyrolytic temperature resulted in the accumulation of biochar in slurry and thereby the increase of Rs. Moreover, the Rct showed a small dependence on the pyrolytic temperature, but the lowest Rct of 1.92 Ω was obtained for PB derived at 800 °C, mostly because that the PB800 had a high specific area of 297.48 m2/g, rich pore structure including most micropores in the range of 2–5 nm and the average pore size of 1.91 nm, which could favor the faster transportation of ions or electrolyte and provide more active sites for BOR. This indicated the highest reactivity of PB800, which was in accordance with LSV measurements."
8,Continuous BAWE and hydrogen production performance,"3.3 Continuous BAWE and hydrogen production performance The H2 production in the continuous BAWE process at constant cell voltage was observed by the evolution of bubbles at the cathode, and further measured by drainage method. The time-dependent changes in current density and H2 production during 10 h of BAWE at 2 V were evaluated via chronoamperometry, as presented in Fig. 8 . The current density decreased monotonously with time, indicating the deactivation of biochar. The current of HB200 dropped faster than that of PB800 at the initial period of BAWE, which was due to the fast consumption of easily oxidized solutes in HB slurry. The overall higher current density for PB800 than that for HB200 was obtained, which was related to the lower Rct of PB800. After 10 h of system operation, the current densities of PB800 and HB200 decreased by 40.03 % and 53.37 %, respectively. The H2 production of PB800 was about 1.49–2.18 times that of HB200 during electrolysis. PB800 and HB200 taken about 10 min and 15 min to produce 2 mL H2 at highest current density, respectively. The comparison of H2 production for different CAWE processes has been listed in Table 2 . H2 production rate in this work was similar to the other CAWE process occurred in H-type electrolytic cell [15,21], but it was lower than that occurred in the single electrolytic cell with the mixed gas generation at anode and cathode [22]. These could be due to the less resistance for ions transportation without PEM separation. Moreover, the energy consumption for hydrogen production of PB and HB was 4.95–8.39 and 6.11–12.66 kWh/Nm3-H2, respectively."
9,Conclusions,"The biochar derived from pyrolysis (PB) and hydrothermal carbonization (HB) of rice husk was employed in biochar-assisted water electrolysis (BAWE) for hydrogen production. Replacing the anodic OER with BOR resulted in a decrease of onset potential and increase of current density. The lower carbonization degree with abundant CO/O–C–O and –OH groups in HB contributed to a lower onset potential and higher current density at low anode potential of within 1.0 V vs. MSE. But the well-developed pore structure and high specific surface area of PB made it showing excellent reaction performance at higher anode potential (>1.0 V vs. MSE). The elimination of minerals, especially the silicate after pickling leaves the exposure of functional groups on the surface of PB, and thereby contributed to the favorable decrease in onset potential and increase in current density. But the simultaneous removing of easily oxidized solutes in HB dominated and thereby made a decrease in current density and increase in onset potential. Appropriate H2SO4 concentration of 1 mol/L was suggested since the higher concentration made it easy for biochar particles agglomeration. Impedance analysis indicated the smaller ohmic resistance of electrolyte for HB and the smaller charge-transfer resistance for PB, and the PB derived at 800 °C with a slurry concentration of 10 g/L showed the lowest charge-transfer resistance and thereby a favorable kinetics. Continuous BAWE showed the deactivation of biochar with time and a stable H2 production rate. PB was found to be more superior than HB in increasing current density and H2 production. This work will broaden our horizons in development of more superior carbon-based fuels for assisting water electrolysis."
