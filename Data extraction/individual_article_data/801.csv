0,Introduction,"The possibility of production fuel and valuable chemical compounds from various types of biomass currently is an actual area of research. Furfural, obtained by acid-catalytic conversion of pentose carbohydrates contained in agricultural waste of herbaceous plants, is one of the most available compounds for the further production of various chemicals used as additives to fuels, solvents, and many other valuable products [1–5]. The catalytic furfural hydrogenation is a complex multi-stage process, including a number of simultaneously and sequential occurring reactions (Fig. 1 ). Industrially important products such as furan, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran are obtained as a result of furfural hydrogenation. Each of these products is in demand and has its own direction of use. Furfuryl alcohol (one of the most valuable compounds obtained by furfural hydrogenation) is used as a raw material for various polymers, lubricants, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, wetting agents, solvents and biofuels [6,7]. In addition, it can be used as an oxygen-containing high-octane additive (however, this requires the additional use of stabilizing additives to suppress alcohol polymerization reactions). Another promising furfural hydrogenation product is 2-methylfuran, which has a high octane number (131) and can be used directly as motor biofuel or as a high-octane additive [8]. Besides 2-methylfuran is used in the production of antimalarial drugs, pesticides and as a solvent. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is a product of deeper hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol and has been used as an environmentally friendly “green” solvent for the manufacture of printing inks, electrochemical cleaning products, and the production of 1,5-pentadiol [9]. Despite the wide range of products resulting from the furfural hydrogenation, their distribution primarily determines by the reaction conditions and the composition of the used catalyst. Both of these factors can be purposefully adapted depending on the task. In this regard, the development of new catalysts allowing to synthesize the necessary intermediates with high selectivity is an important scientific and technical task. There are two types of the furfural hydrogenation reaction carrying out: in the gas phase [10–13] and in the liquid phase [14–25]. Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, isopropanol) are most often used as a solvents for liquid-phase furfural hydrogenation [14–23]. However, in most cases, the solvent takes part in the reaction, leading to the formation of undesirable products. Aside from the alcohols, water is a promising solvent in this reaction due to its non-toxicity and availability [24,25]. Most often in the industry, furfural is obtained in the aqueous solution, and therefore, the use of water as a solvent in its further transformations is most expedient, since it eliminates the expensive stage of separation of furfural – water systems [26,27]. Copper-chromium catalysts are used for the industrial process of furfural hydrogenation (at pressures up to 100 atm and in the temperature range 130–200 °C), which make it possible to carry out the reaction with high conversion of raw materials and significant selectivity of furfuryl alcohol formation [10]. However, the toxicity of chromium compounds contained in this type of catalysts limits their use and contributes to the search and development of new catalysts that do not contain chromium compounds, but at the same time are not inferior in their catalytic characteristics to industrial analogues. To date, various types of mono- and bimetallic furfural hydrogenation catalysts have been proposed in the literature [11,12,14–21,24,25]. Platinum [16,25], palladium [14,16,22,25], copper [11,12,18], nickel [19], and ruthenium [23–25] are used as active metals in this case. Sometimes the active components are modified with additional metals to purposefully control the selectivity of the formation of certain products as a result of the reaction [15–17,21,23,24]. Various types of carbon materials, alumina and silica are used as supports for the catalysts. It was found that the greater the hydrogenating power of the active component of the catalyst (for example, Ni, Pd), the more this leads to the breaking of C — C bonds, up to the opening of the ring and the formation of alkanes. Thus, furan is the main product of furfural hydrogenation for Ni/SiO2 catalysts [17]. The use of a Pd/C catalyst (activated carbon) at 180 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar allows to carry out the reaction of furfural hydrogenation with high selectivity of the formation of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [22]. The furfural conversion was 95% at a temperature of 180 °C with the using a Ru/C catalyst; the yield of the main product, methylfuran, was higher than 61% [23]. The breaking of C - C bonds is less preferable for the catalysts with active centers of lower hydrogenating strength (Cu, Co). This leads to the formation of methylfuran and furfuryl alcohol as the main products of furfural hydrogenation. The greater selectivity for 2-methylfuran is observed for the catalysts Cu/kerolytic clay with a moderate copper content (of the order of 15%), whereas mainly furfuryl alcohol is formed with a high Cu content [12]. The introduction of Ce or Zn in the composition of the copper-containing catalyst leads to a decrease in the conversion of furfural. However, this contributes to a change in the electronic state of active centers, which is reflected in the achievement of almost complete selectivity for furfuryl alcohol. Ni-containing catalysts described in the literature, differ in the nature of support, active component content and reaction conditions. The high dispersion of the active metal on the surface of the support increases the activity of the catalysts in the furfural hydrogenation. Thus, SiO2, mesoporous silica SBA-15, carbon-silica, carbon nanotubes were used for the synthesis of nickel catalysts for furfural hydrogenation [17,28–34]. One of the possible ways to increase the dispersion of the metal may be its introduction directly into the composition of the support. This becomes possible when using special materials - layered double hydroxides (LDH) [18,19,35]. It is a class of inorganic compounds based on brucite, with layers composed of cations of heterovalent metals with close ionic radii, and hydrated anions located in the interlayer space [36]. Calcination of these compounds at temperatures below 600 °C leads to the formation of mixed oxides with a developed specific surface and a uniform distribution of metals in the structure [37]. The introduction of nickel into the composition of the LDH layers will make it possible to achieve its high dispersion at the atomic level (due to the structural features of brucite-like layers of LDH), thereby contributing to an increase in their activity in the furfural hydrogenation. Partial replacement of magnesium by nickel in the composition of MgAl-LDH-based systems can lead to a controlled change in the selectivity of the formation of specific products. Layered double hydroxides, as well as products of their calcination, containing nickel cations in the composition of the layers, have long been studied by various scientific groups. NiAl-LDH is used in methanol steam reforming [38–40], alkylbenzenes isomerization [41], and extraction of short-chain fatty acids [42]. The ternary MgNiAl-LDH systems were studied in the reactions of glycerol to acrolein conversion [43], as well as in the landfill gas conversion reaction [44]. In addition, NiAl-LDH are a precursors of catalyst supports, for example, Pt/NiAl-LDH are used for the catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde [45]. The structural properties [46], the transformations occurring during thermal decomposition of LDH [40], and the nickel reduction process in the NiAl-LDH structure [47] were studied for NiAl-LDH with different Ni/Al ratios (2–4). As was shown earlier, the introduction of nickel into the composition of the LDH layers does not lead to a significant weakening of the basic properties of the corresponding mixed oxides. Ni-containing catalysts based on the LDH for the reaction of furfural hydrogenation were studied in several articles. NiMgAl- and NiCoAl-catalysts were demonstrated a significant perspective for the gas phase furfural hydrogenation [48]. Systems, based on CuNi–MgAl-LDH [49] and NiAl-LDH, obtained on the surface of aluminium oxide [50], were showed a high activity in the reaction of liquid phase furfural hydrogenation. At the same time, the authors of all these works noted that the selectivity of product formation can be purposefully controlled by changing the nature and ratio of metals in the composition of LDH, as well as the nature of interlayer anions. It was shown that the use of basic supports for the catalysts of furfural hydrogenation (magnesium oxide, or MgAl-layered double hydroxides) eliminates the possibility of involving water in the reaction, and the main products are furfuryl and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols [27]. In this regard, the study of Ni-containing catalysts based on LDH, which, on the one hand, have moderate basic properties and, on the other hand, high dispersion of the active metal, is very promising. The aim of this work was to synthesize double NiAl-LDH and triple MgNiAl-LDH with different Ni/(Ni + Mg) ratios and to study their structural properties, texture properties of mixed oxides formed upon calcination, and activity in the aqua-phase hydrogenation reaction of furfural."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Ni(Mg)Al-LDH were synthesized by traditional coprecipitation method [51]. Solution, contained metals nitrates (C = 1 mol L−1) gradually added to the solution of sodium carbonate (C = 1 mol L−1) at constant temperature 60 °C. To obtain MgAl-LDH pH = 10 was maintained, and to synthesize Ni(Mg)Al-LDH pH = 9 was maintained. After subsequent steps aging at 60°С for 18 h, washing, filtration and drying LDH with preferential carbonate-anions into interlayer space were obtained. Layered double hydroxides were denoted as MgAl- X -Ni-LDH, where X = Ni/(Ni + Mg). To obtain mixed oxides Ni(Mg)AlOx LDH were calcined at 600°С. Obtained systems were denoted as MgAl- X -NiOx, where X = Ni/(Ni + Mg). Catalyst Ni/MgAlOx were obtained by wet incipient impregnation of the mixed oxide MgAlOx by nickel nitrate solution with concentration providing a nickel content in the finished catalyst of 10%. Metals content (Ni, Mg, Al) in the solid LDH were estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry on a Varian 710-ES instrument after their calcination and dissolution in the acids."
3,Physical characterization,"2.2 Physical characterization Structural properties of the synthesized LDH were studied by means of X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD). X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer using parallel Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ angular range from 5 to 80°. The scanning step was 0.02°, and the signal integration time was 5 s/step. The phase composition of samples was identified using the International diffraction database ICDD PDF-2. Cell parameters c and a of MgAl-LDH were determined by 003 and 110 peaks positions, and the crystallite sizes Lc were determined by the position and half-width of peak 003. Surface morphology of layered double hydroxides were investigated by scanning electron microscopy on a JSM-6460 LV (JEOL) instrument with the tungsten cathode and an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Before each of experiments, the samples were ground in an agate mortar and fixed on a conducting double-sided carbon Scotch tape. To prevent the re-charging effects, a conducting gold film was sputtered on the fixed samples. Prior to each experiment, the samples were evacuated in the microscope chamber for 15–20 min to remove volatile compounds from the surface, which could exert a detrimental effect on the secondary electron emission and thus deteriorate quality of the image. Textural properties of the Ni(Mg)Al-LDH were studied after their preliminary calcination at 600°С. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77.4 K were measured using an ASAP-2020 (Micromeritics) static volumetric apparatus. A range of equilibrium relative pressures was between 10−3 and 0.996 P/P0. The BET specific surface area (SBET) was calculated from the adsorption isotherm at equilibrium relative values of nitrogen vapor P/P0 = 0.05–0.25. In the calculation of specific surface area, the molecular nitrogen site in the filled monolayer was assumed to be 0.162 nm2. The adsorption pore volume (Vads) was determined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.99 under the assumption that density of the adsorbate is equal to the density of normal liquid, 0.02887 mol cm- 3. The average pore diameter was estimated by the formula D = 4Vads/SBET. Differential characteristics of the pore size distribution curves were obtained by applying the BJН method to the desorption branch of the isotherms. The calculation was performed within the cylindrical model of unconnected pores. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEM2100 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with a lattice resolution of 0.14 nm at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test For the liquid phase reaction of hydrogenation of the furfural preliminary oxidized and reduced in a stream of hydrogen (600°С) catalysts Ni/MgAlOx or Ni(Mg)AlOx (500 mg) placed in a steel autoclave with a capacity of 180 ml together with distilled water (40 ml). To remove air components from the pore space of the catalyst, it was prereduced with hydrogen (T = 50 °C, pressure 0.5 MPa, stirring 1400 rpm, time 30 min) directly in the autoclave. The reaction mixture was heated to a predetermined temperature by circulating heated water through an external “jacket”. After this activation, 5 ml of furfural and 60 ml of distilled water were placed in an autoclave. The furfural hydrogenation reaction was carried out at a temperature of 90 °C, a pressure of 2 MPa, with stirring at 1400 rpm. The reaction was controlled by measuring the volume of consumed hydrogen with a mass flow meter. The volume of consumed hydrogen normalized to normal conditions was recalculated to its equivalent amount that is needed for the formation of furfuryl alcohol from furfural. After completion of the reaction and cooling, the aqueous phase was separated from the catalyst by filtering. The quantitative determination of the reaction products was carried out by gas chromatography (Chromos GX-1000) in a capillary column VB-WAX (60 m × 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Study of the structural properties of Ni(Mg)Al-LDH,"3.1 Study of the structural properties of Ni(Mg)Al-LDH NiAl-LDH with molar ratio Ni/Al = 3, as well as Ni(Mg)Al-LDH with molar ratio (Ni + Mg)/Al = 3 and Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.3 и 0.5 were synthesized (Table 1 ). Good correlation between calculated and experimental (after samples dissolution) values of the metals ratios indicates on the completeness of the passing of the coprecipitation reaction. Diffractograms of all synthesized Ni-containing LDH regardless of nickel content have a typical set of reﬂections of hydrotalcite phase. Reflections 003 and 006 observed in the low angles area, reflections 012, 015 and 018 – in the area of medium angles and reflections 110 and 113 - in the region of high angles (Fig. 2 , a). The peaks different from hydrotalcite were not detected at diffractograms. Adsorption of the nickel nitrate on the mixed oxide MgAlOx led to the complete restoration of the initial layered structure (Fig. 2, a, curve 2). Introduction of the nickel cations into MgAl-LDH layers leads to the diminution of cell parameter a (Table 2 ) due to smaller ionic radius of Ni2+ cations (0.069 nm) compared to the ionic radius of Mg2+ cations (0.072 nm) [52]. Decrease of the cell parameter c for the NiAl-LDH sample and correspondingly the decrease of interlayer distance d 003 compared to MgAl-LDH connected with a larger attraction between the hydroxide layers formed by metal cations. Moreover, the decrease of the crystallite size L a and L c occurred with increasing of the nickel content in MgAl-LDH. All samples were subjected to oxidation and reduction treatment at 600 °C before the reaction. Diffractograms of the systems are presented at Fig. 2, b. As can be seen, high-temperature treatments lead to the complete disappearance of the layered structure of LDH and the formation of a mixed oxide structure. This is evidenced by the peaks at 2θ = 43 and 62°. Only the peaks characteristic of the mixed oxide phase were observed at diffractogram of the Ni/MgAlOx catalyst. There were no peaks of the metallic nickel phase at the diffractogram of the Ni/MgAlOx. For the samples, where nickel enters directly into their structure, phases of metallic Ni and NiO formed in addition to the mixed oxide phases (NiAlOx и NiMgAlOx). The content of this phases changed depending on the composition of the catalysts. The intensity of the corresponding peaks at diffractograms increased with increasing of Ni content (2θ = 44 and 51о). Almost complete transition of nickel to the metallic state occurred during the reduction process for the NiAlOx sample. There was also a diffuse peak related to NiO at the diffractogram of this sample. It turned out that with increasing the nickel content the growth of the crystal size of metallic Ni occurred (Table 3 ). For the MgAl-0.3-NiOx sample it was not possible to correctly estimate the size of nickel particles due to the low intensity of the corresponding peaks. This may indicate a high dispersion of the particles formed for this catalyst. For the studying of the structural properties of the samples in the conditions of the reaction of furfural hydrogenation NiMgAl-LDH were calcined (Т = 600°С), were reduced in hydrogen flow (Т = 600°С) and were rehydrated in distilled water. Diffractograms of the samples, dried at 120°С, are represented at Fig. 2, c. It can be seen that, as for the samples before hydration (Fig. 2, b), peaks characteristic of the phases of mixed oxides, nickel oxide, and metallic nickel were present at diffractodrams. Moreover, at diffractogram of the sample with Ni (Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.3 and 0.5 the peaks in the range 2θ = 44о и 51о corresponding to the LDH phase appeared. The intensity of these peaks increased with a decrease of the part of nickel in the catalysts. Thus, «memory effect» (reconstruction of layered structure after interaction of the corresponding mixed oxides with water) appear for the NiMgAlOx systems based on LDH with the small nickel content. The phase composition of the samples after reaction of furfural hydrogenation was almost the same with the phase composition of the samples after oxidation, reduction, hydration treatment (Fig. 2, d). When comparing the LDH lattice parameters in the initial samples and in the samples after the reaction (Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.3 and 0.5), it turned out that as a result of the treatments and the reaction itself, the lattice parameters a and the interlayer distance d003 decreased (Table 2) for due to the formation of nickel-containing phases. According to the SEM data, the surface morphology of the synthesized LDH determined to a large extent by the nickel content. So, for MgAl-0.3Ni-LDH “rosette” morphology is formed. “Rosettes” are represented by platelets overlapping each other in different directions (Fig. 3 , a). The similar surface topography is observed for MgAl-LDH [53]. The increase of nickel content in the structure of LDH leads to the sticking together and decrease of the size of plates. Consequence of this the «rosette» morphology become less pronounced (Fig. 3, b). For a NiAl-LDH sample that does not contain magnesium, the surface is an almost smooth region formed by the smallest particles (Fig. 3, c). Thus, introduction of nickel into LDH composition leads to the sticking together of the plates, observed for the MgAl-LDH, and to transition from “rosette” to smooth morphology. This is probably due to a change of the point of zero charge (PZC) of the LDH upon the introduction of nickel cations into their composition. When pH of the synthesis and the point of zero charge are equal (as it observed in the synthesis of MgAl-LDH) “rosette” structure is formed. In this case the formation of the primary particles is very fast, but their growth is slow due to electroneutrality of the surface. As a result, the particle growth occurs mostly along the (001) plane, where the surface charge density is minimal, with the formation of the so-called “rosettes”. At a lower pH of the synthesis (upon synthesis of Ni-containing LDH), the morphology of LDH is an aggregate of primary nanoparticles [54]. Thus, the layered structure formed in all studied range of Ni content in LDH. The structural properties of the samples that underwent a pretreatment similar to the conditions of the catalytic tests substantially depend on the Ni content. With a minimum Ni content in the samples, a partial reconstruction of their layered structure occurs after high-temperature treatments and holding in water, as well as a decrease in the intensity of peaks in the diffraction patterns corresponding to metallic nickel, which may indicate an increase in its dispersion. The surface morphology of the synthesized Ni-containing LDH also determined by the Ni/(Ni + Mg) ratio. The transition of the “rosette” morphology to a smooth morphology, formed by the smallest plates, occurs with an increase in the Ni content in LDH."
7,Study of the textural properties of mixed oxides Ni(Mg)AlOx,"3.2 Study of the textural properties of mixed oxides Ni(Mg)AlOx The textural properties (specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size, pore size distribution) were determined after preliminary calcination of the Ni(Mg)Al-LDH at 600°С. According to the obtained data nickel introduction into structure of the MgAl-LDH leads to the significant decrease of the specific surface area of the mixed oxides, formed after LDH calcination. So, at the ratio Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.3 specific surface area declined by 10%, and at the ratio Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.5 - by 25% compared with the sample without nickel in its composition. Specific surface area of the NiAlOx more than two times less than the corresponding indicator for the MgAlOx sample (Table 4 ). The values of the specific pore volume for the samples NiMgAlOx and MgAlOx practically coincide. Introduction of the nickel cations in the MgAl-LDH structure promotes a broader pore size distribution in the formed mixed oxides (Fig. 4 ) with a predominant pore contribution of more than 6 nm (the contribution of the mesopore region of less than 6 nm does not exceed 5–7%). The NiAlOx sample is characterized by a narrow, uniformly porous pore size distribution with the main contribution of mesopores in the region of pore diameters of 3–20 nm (about 94–98%) with a maximum on the distribution curve of 9.3 nm."
8,Study of catalytic properties of the Ni(Mg)AlOx in the reaction of furfural hydrogenation,"3.3 Study of catalytic properties of the Ni(Mg)AlOx in the reaction of furfural hydrogenation Ni(Mg)AlOx and Ni/MgAlOx were studied in the reaction of aqua- phase furfural hydrogenation at 90°С temperature and 2 MPa pressure during 200 min. Ni/MgAlOx catalysts were obtained by the impregnation of magnesium-aluminum mixed oxide by the solution of nickel nitrate. Before the reaction all the samples were subjected to oxidative and reduction treatment at 600°С. According to obtained data the highest amount of absorbed hydrogen is characteristic of NiMgAlOx ternary systems and amounts to about 1.9 mol of H2 per 1 mol of furfural. For the NiAlOx sample, the amount of absorbed hydrogen does not exceed 0.5 mol of H2 per 1 mol of furfural, which is almost four times less than for ternary mixed NiMgAlOx oxides. Furfural conversion and main products selectivity are presented at Table 5 . In accordance with the obtained data, complete conversion of furfural is observed for the MgAl-0.3-NiOx and MgAl-0.5-NiOx catalysts. The complete replacement of magnesium by nickel in the NiAlOx sample leads to a significant decrease in the activity of the corresponding catalysts, which is reflected in a decrease in furfural conversion to 58% (Table 5). The main hydrogenation products for all studied catalysts were furfuryl and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols. Only when MgAl-0.3-NiOx was used as a catalyst a small amount of tetrahydrofuran formed (a little more than 1 wt %). Despite the fact that, according to the literature data, nickel is a metal with a strong hydrogenating force, an increase in its content in the composition of mixed oxides did not lead to a significant formation of deep hydrogenation products. On the contrary, with an increase of the nickel content in the catalysts, the furfuryl alcohol selectivity increases, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol selectivity decreases. The NiAlOx catalyst, having the lowest conversion value of furfural, is characterized by the highest furfuryl alcohol selectivity (96%). Carrying out the reaction with incomplete conversion of furfural makes it possible to obtain furfuryl alcohol with high selectivity using any of the catalysts based on Ni-containing LDH (Table 5). Selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was 80–95%. This confirms the same reaction mechanism for the studied catalysts. Ternary systems NiMgAlOx are capable of providing complete conversion of furfural with the formation of a product of deeper hydrogenation - tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. The results, obtained at hydrogenation of furfural under similar conditions on a 1.5% Pd/Cnanotube catalyst, are presented in Table 5 to compare the catalytic characteristics of systems obtained on the basis of Ni-containing LDH, with the characteristics of traditional systems used in hydrogenation reactions. Obviously, when comparing the values of furfural conversion obtained for both types of catalytic systems, that MgNiAlOx catalysts are not inferior the Pd/Cnanotube sample in activity. The ratio of furfuryl alcohol selectivity and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol selectivity is almost the same for the studied Pd- and Ni-containing catalysts. It is also worth noting that the Ni/MgAlOx catalyst obtained by impregnating a MgAlOx support and not containing nickel in the structure was completely inactive in the furfural hydrogenation reaction under the selected reaction conditions. This is explained by the TEM results and XRD data. The activity of catalysts for the furfural hydrogenation directly depends on the particle size of the metallic nickel. According to the TEM the Ni/MgAlOx sample is characterized by the presence of globular particles without a pronounced crystal faceting (Fig. 5 , d). Moreover, as demonstrated by XRD analysis, there no metallic nickel in this catalyst. For all catalysts based on Ni-containing LDH, a completely different morphology is observed. The micrographs clearly show rounded particles, the size of which decreases with decreasing nickel content in the samples (Fig. 5 a, b, c). Thus, for the catalysts MgAl-0.3-NiOx and MgAl-0.5-NiOx, the size of active metal particles does not exceed 5 nm. Due to the structural features of the catalyst precursor - layered double hydroxide - nickel is fixed directly in the structure of the LDH layers. This leads to a uniform distribution of metal particles in the composition of the mixed oxide formed after heat treatment. The TEM results are in good agreement with the XRD data for these systems. The higher activity of the catalyst (complete conversion of furfural) based on NiMgAl mixed oxide containing the smallest amount of nickel in its composition can be explained from two perspectives. First, a mixed oxide containing the smallest amount of nickel is characterized by a maximum specific surface area and, in accordance with SEM data, a loose « rosette » morphology. This may contribute to greater dispersion of the active metal in the catalyst structure. Secondly, according to TEM, the active component of the catalyst is uniformly distributed over its surface in the form of particles of small diameter (less than 5 nm). Thus, the introduction of a hydrogenating metal - nickel - into the composition of MgAl-LDH layers at the stage of its synthesis promotes the formation of small metal particles on the catalyst surface, as well as the formation of a developed specific surface of the sample. The active centers with small size are highly active in the hydrogenation of furfural. Therefore, they make it possible to carry out the reaction with the formation of a product of deeper hydrogenation - tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. When there was no Mg in the catalyst composition, the active sites with a higher size formed. They were less active. Therefore, they were only able to carry out the reaction until furfuryl alcohol was formed. Thus the catalysts based on the LDH make it easy to adjust the size of active sites, providing the required selectivity of the formation of specific reaction products."
9,Conclusions,"The possibility of synthesis by coprecipitation of single-phase NiMgAl-LDH with a constant molar ratio of (Ni + Mg)/Al = 3 and a variable ratio of Ni/(Ni + Mg) = 0.3 and 0.5 was shown. The amount of nickel in the composition of LDH has a significant effect on its structural characteristics, as well as on the texture and catalytic characteristics of the mixed oxides obtained on their basis. An increase of the nickel content in the samples reduces the furfural conversion from 100% for MgAl-0.3-NiOx and MgAl-0.5-NiOx to 58% for NiAlOx. At the same time, a change of the Ni/(Ni + Mg) ratio makes it possible to regulate the selectivity of the formation of the target products of the furfural hydrogenation reaction. An increase in the amount of nickel in the catalyst promotes the selective of the furfuryl alcohol formation (more than 96%). The yield of the deeper hydrogenation product - tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol - significantly decreases with increasing of the nickel in the samples. The selectivity for this substance does not exceed 3% for NiAlOx sample. The activity of the Ni/MgAlOx catalyst synthesized by impregnation of a MgAlOx support with a nickel precursor turned out to be insignificant under used reaction conditions."
