0,Introduction,"Functionalizing biodegradable polymers or plastics with natural antioxidants has many practical and industrial benefits, particularly in the development of sustainable active packaging materials (De Moraes Crizel et al., 2018). They are ecological alternatives to conventional but synthetic antioxidant additives such as butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) (Kahl & Kappus, 1993). One of the most economically feasible and eco-friendly approach is to utilize industrial plant-based food waste directly to obtain natural antioxidants and incorporate them as a major component of biodegradable active packaging. There are several established methods of extracting antioxidants and essential oils from plants, vegetables, fruits and herbs (Conde, Moure, Domínguez, & Parajó, 2010). Most of these extractions require multiple-step procedures, solvents and produce additional waste that may not be recycled into edible food products. As a result, they are partially valorized as cellulosic biomass for energy generation or paper industry (Marković et al., 2018). However, certain plant-based food wastes such as orange peel, discarded low quality vinegar liquid, and green tealeaves waste are known to be still very rich in numerous flavonoids, phenolic acids, and aldehydes (Palacios, Valcárcel, Caro, & Pérez, 2002; Panrong, Karbowiak, & Harnkarnsujarit, 2019; Toh, Yokoyama, Noda, & Yuguchi, 2010). The well-known antioxidant capacity of green tealeaves comes from a special kind of polyphenols called catechins. Many researches have demonstrated the efficacy of catechins as an additive in food and food-packaging industry. They significantly improve the nutritional properties of food (Vuong, Stathopoulos, Nguyen, Golding, & Roach, 2011) and shelf life of perishables (Panrong et al., 2019; Toh et al., 2010). Moreover, these bioactive antioxidants have also been utilized as antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and UV-protector agents. The main catechins present in green tea are: (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (-)-epicatechin (EC), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (+)-gallocatechin (GC), catechin gallate (CG), and (+)-catechin (C) (Namal Senanayake, 2013). Similarly, vinegar industry generates large quantities of fermented vinegar that are discarded due to strict quality requirements related to taste, aroma, and acidity (Mas, Torija, del C. García-Parrilla, & Troncoso, 2014; Tesfaye, Morales, & Troncoso, 2012). Such an acidic liquid food waste still contains large amounts of valuable antioxidants, but it is generally unsuitable as agricultural fertilizer or soil additive due to high acetic acid levels. Balsamic vinegar is rich in polyphenols having several health benefits such as exceptional antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive properties (Liu, Tang, Zhao, Gan, & Li, 2019). In fact, balsamic vinegar was shown to contain macromolecules (melanoidins), colored and uncolored, ranging from high polymeric to oligomeric sizes (Falcone & Giudici, 2008). Detailed chemical analysis of the discarded vinegar used herein is beyond the scope of this work; however it conforms to the traditional balsamic vinegar production standards and is chemically comparable to well-characterized balsamic vinegars reported in the literature (Falcone & Giudici, 2008). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a common biodegradable, biocompatible, and transparent polymer with good oxygen barrier properties and high solubility in aqueous solutions and formic acid (Guzman-Puyol et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). It is used in many applications including controlled drug delivery systems, film formation, and packaging (He, Lan, Ahmed, Qin, & Liu, 2019). Active PVA films containing seaweed extracts and nano-cellulose with antiseptic and antioxidant properties have been very recently reported (Singh, Gaikwad, & Lee, 2018). PVA can also be blended with natural polymers such as chitosan in acidic aqueous solutions; incorporating natural extracts as well as mint and pomegranate peel (He et al., 2019). PVA films with antioxidant properties were also reported such that release kinetics of curcumin from gum modified PVA films were shown to have an effective antioxidant when it was released into fatty food simulants (Ma, Ren, & Wang, 2017). An interesting study utilized macroporous crosslinked PVA polymer as an adsorbent for selective removal of caffeine from tea extracts (N. Ma et al., 2012). A direct application in food packing of meat was demonstrated using catechins, extracted from fresh green tea, in a PVA-starch composite matrix film (Wu, Wang, & Chen, 2010). PVA has also been blended with tea polyphenols extracted from green tea by a multistep process consisting of extraction with water, ultrafiltration, and adsorption in a resin elution with a mixed solvent system and a final ultrasonic processing (Liu, Wang, Lan, & Qin, 2019). Similarly, bamboo vinegar has been used in chitosan as an antioxidant and antiseptic packaging for meat (Zhang, He, Kang, & Li, 2018). To the best of our knowledge, direct incorporation of processed plant food waste or its extracts into PVA polymer is rather scarce. For instance, development of polyvinyl alcohol and apple pomace (apple juice waste) bio-composite films with antioxidant properties for active food packaging applications was reported using direct mixing in hot water (Gaikwad, Lee, & Lee, 2016). Films demonstrated good levels of antioxidant activity. In this work, we present one-pot fabrication approach to fabricate antioxidant PVA films containing significant amounts of antioxidants from processed green tealeaves waste and commercially discarded balsamic vinegar. No prolonged and multistep procedures are needed to fabricate such antioxidant polymer films. Dried used green tealeaves were dispersed in formic acid and after filtering out; the solution was combined with a PVA-formic acid solution. In the case of discarded balsamic vinegar, the vinegar was directly added to aqueous PVA solutions and films were cast and dried in both cases. Upon drying, antioxidant and transparent food waste containing PVA films with diverse features could be obtained."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Formic acid (≥98 %), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (typical average Mw 89,000−98,000 g/mol, 98 % hydrolyzed), ABTS + (2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), Trolox ((±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra-methylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) and gallic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie (Steinheim, Germany). India origin green tea bags (Everton Tea India Pvt., Ltd.) were purchased from a local supermarket. Discarded balsamic vinegar (Aceto Balsamico Di Modena Igp) was donated by Villa Matilde SpA, Italy. Deionized water obtained from a Milli-Q Advantage A10 Ultrapure Water Purification device. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Germany)."
3,High-resolution ultra-performance liquid chromatography characterization of tea metabolites with mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS),"2.2 High-resolution ultra-performance liquid chromatography characterization of tea metabolites with mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) The chemical characterization of the extractions from tealeaves and tealeaves waste with water and formic acid was done by high-resolution ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) using a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) QToF Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer coupled to an Acquity UPLC system. Extracts were prepared by adding 3 g of dry material in 60 mL of solvent (water and formic acid) stirring for 120 min at room temperature and filtered through Whatman N°1 filter paper. The corresponding solution was diluted 50 times in 3 % acetonitrile for UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Tea metabolites were separated on a reversed phase C18 column (BEH 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) by using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (5–100% in 5 min). Flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min. Both eluents (water and acetonitrile) were added with 0.1 % formic acid. Five microliters of samples were injected in the system. Mass spectra were acquired in negative electrospray mode (ESI-) in the 50−1200 m/z mass range. Tandem mass spectra were continuously acquired in MSe mode over the same mass range. Leucine encephalin 2 μg/mL was continuously infused in the Lockspray source for on-line spectral recalibration. Tea metabolites were identified based on their accurate mass (within 3 ppm mass accuracy), the corresponding calculated brute formula and isotopic profile and, whenever possible, their MS/MS spectrum. METLIN (Guijas et al., 2018) and HMDB (Wishart et al., 2018) publicly available databases were consulted for the identification of catechins."
4,Preparation of the films,"2.3 Preparation of the films Tea waste was obtained by immersion of 20 paper bags (one bag contains 2 g processed tealeaves) of commercial green tea bags into pre-boiled 5 L of tap water at 100 °C while stirring. After 30 min, tea bags were collected and introduced in an oven at 70 °C until complete water evaporation. The bags were subsequently opened and the tealeaves were recovered (waste tealeaves). The extraction process was performed by adding 3 g of waste tealeaves in 60 mL of formic acid and stirring for 120 min at room temperature. The extract solution was filtered through Whatman N°1 filter paper and the concentration of the green tea waste extracts in formic acid solutions were calculated and adjusted by measuring the dry weight of the green tea waste extracts upon casting and drying filtered acidic solutions and this was adjusted to be 14.5 mg/mL. Separately, dry PVA flakes were dissolved in formic acid to obtain a polymer solution of 15 mg/mL. Different volumes of waste tealeaves extract solution were directly added to the formic acid polymer solution in order to maintain different waste tealeaves extract to polymer ratio in the final films. Then, PVA with formic acid and tea films were made by casting equal volumes of each solution in polystyrene Petri dish molds (90 mm in diameter). The solutions were allowed to dry under a chemical hood for 6 days. Resultant films were colored but transparent containing various concentrations (i.e., 5, 10, 20 and 50 wt.%) of used green tea extracts. These films were labeled as T5, T10, T20 and T50. Balsamic vinegar-PVA films were fabricated by dissolving PVA (15 mg/mL) in boiling water and stirring until complete dissolution. Discarded balsamic vinegar had a solids content of ∼180 mg/mL determined by drying discarded balsamic vinegar in the same plastic petri dishes and measuring weight before and after drying. Then, different volumes of discarded balsamic vinegar were added to the PVA aqueous solution to maintain different vinegar solids to polymer ratio similar to the waste tealeaves extracts. A control PVA film in water was also casted with the same concentration of 15 mg/mL. Solutions were poured into polystyrene Petri dish molds (90 mm in diameter) and dried in an oven at 70 °C overnight. Films containing 5, 10, 20 and 50 % (w/w) of balsamic vinegar waste were fabricated. These films were labeled as V5, V10, V20 and V50. Pure PVA films cast from water and formic acid were labeled as PVAw and PVAf, respectively. Before any characterization, films were briefly conditioned at 70 °C to remove any adsorbed water and measurements were immediately conducted. The average thickness of aqueous PVA (PVAw) and PVA-formic acid (PVAf) films were approximately 40 μm. Thickness of the green tea-waste films was approximately 60 μm. Discarded balsamic vinegar-PVA films had more concentration dependent thickness values i.e., 40 μm, 60 μm, 85 μm and 120 μm for 5, 10, 20 and 50 wt,% of discarded vinegar concertation. The fabrication procedure for both antioxidant films is schematically shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy,"2.4 Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy Infrared spectra were obtained with a single-reflection attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory (MIRacle ATR, PIKE Technologies) coupled to a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Equinox 70 FT-IR, Bruker). All spectra were recorded in the 3800–600 cm−1 range with a resolution of 4 cm−1, accumulating 64 scans to reduce the spectral noise. The fluorescence spectroscopy of catechins was performed by directly inserting dry PVA-tea waste films in a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. Emission spectra of films with different concentrations of tealeaves waste extract % (w/w) were recorded at 60° in the range of λ = 300−500 nm at excitation wavelength λex = 280 nm. Results were normalized to the thickness of the film. Fluorescence photomicrographs were obtained with a fluorescence confocal microscope Nikon A1 using 405 laser for excitation and 450-50 band pass filter for the emission modes. A magnification of 20× was used for imaging."
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Surface and cross-section morphologies of samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a JEOL JSM-6490LA microscope working in high vacuum mode, with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV of accelerating voltage. For the cross-section analysis, samples were immersed for few seconds in liquid nitrogen to enhance the break and, then, scratched with the aid of tweezers. Before the analysis, samples were mounted on stubs and coated with 10 nm of gold."
7,Mechanical characterization,"2.6 Mechanical characterization Mechanical properties of the films were measured by uniaxial tensile tests on a dual column Instron 3365 universal testing machine. Dog-bone shaped samples had a gauge length of 25 mm and a width of 4 mm. Strain displacement was applied with the rate of 20 mm/min. Stress-strain curves were recorded at 25 °C and 44 % RH. At least ten measurements were conducted for each sample and results were averaged to obtain a mean value. The stiffness of the material was defined by the Young’s modulus value, calculated from the slope of the linear part of stress-strain curve (before elastic limit); see Fig. 6. Both Young’s modulus and elongation at break values were estimated using the built-in software of the tensile tester."
8,Antioxidant activity: free radical scavenging assay,"2.7 Antioxidant activity: free radical scavenging assay The antioxidant capacity was calculated measuring the free radical scavenging activity of the total released phenolic compounds with two different antioxidant assay: ABTS + (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl). Both radical solutions were prepared following standard methods developed in (Guzman-Puyol et al., 2017). Films with a surface area of 78.54 mm2 (10 mm of diameter) were inserted into the 3 mL of diluted radical solution. These assays were based on the reaction between the released antioxidant molecules against the radicals ABTS + and DPPH , separately, promoting changes in the UV-spectra of the radical control solution. The absorption bands were collected at certain immersion time-intervals from 0 to 24 h for waste tealeaves samples and up to 72 h for discarded vinegar films. These measurements were performed with a Cary JEOL UV-spectrophotometer. The characteristic absorption peaks of ABTS + and DPPH , at 734 nm and 517 nm, respectively, were used to calculate the percentage of radical inhibition following the Eq. (1) below: (1) Percentage of radical inhibition = 1 - A 1 - A 2 A 3 × 100 where A1 is the absorbance of the sample extract in radical solution, A2 is the absorbance of the sample solution at the same wavelength, and A3 is the absorbance of the radical control solution. All measurements were performed at least five times to ensure reproducibility. The antioxidant capabilities of dried fresh tealeaves, waste tealeaves (previously extracted once with water), and discarded balsamic vinegar were characterized by the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) parameter. This is practically the concentration of antioxidants present in the solution which reduce the initial radical concentration by 50 % and it is expressed as μg/mL (Li, Wu, & Huang, 2009). IC50 value was calculated by plotting the radical scavenging activity (RSA) versus extract concentration (μg/mL) for fresh tealeaves, waste tealeaves and vinegar. For fresh and waste tealeaves measurements, the extracts were prepared both in water and in formic acid as described in Section 2.3. These solutions were used to obtain the calibration curves (see Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supporting information) by diluting them with water for ABTS + and ethanol for DPPH test. The IC50 of DPPH was measured only for dried tealeaves waste extracted in formic acid and dried solids of the discarded balsamic vinegar solutions because DPPH is sensitive to acidic environment. Since the IC50 values were used to compare the antioxidant capacity of water and formic acid extracts, IC50 results measured with ABTS + were considered instead. The aim of DPPH -IC50 value was to verify the reactivity of the natural antioxidants present in both waste/discard solutions against this radical and hence, to better-understand the results obtained in the release experiments (Fig. S2 in Supporting information). The antioxidant capacity of the composite films were also evaluated using a standard protocol known as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) per weight of dried film, expressed as μmoles of trolox/g dried film (Pellegrini et al., 2003). These values allows us to compare the antioxidant effect with other published systems containing natural antioxidants. For this, only selected polymer film samples were utilized, namely V10 and V50, containing 10 wt.% and 50 wt.% of waste. The μmoles of trolox/g dried film values of films after one hour of immersion in the radical solution were used this study. Note that DPPH measurement were considered only for waste tealeaves films since only the highest-concentration vinegar film (V50) responded against DPPH in ethanol medium after 24 h (see Fig. S3 Supporting information)."
9,Water uptake and oxygen permeability measurements,"2.8 Water uptake and oxygen permeability measurements For water uptake measurements, samples were first dried by conditioning in a desiccator until no change in sample weight measured. Then, dry samples were weighed on a sensitive electronic balance and placed in a sealed chamber under different humidity conditions (RH) at 25 °C. The following humidity conditions were set: 0 %, 15 %, 45 %, 85 % and 100 %. Once the equilibrium was reached, each sample was again weighed and the amount of adsorbed water was calculated as the difference with the initial dry weight. Three measurements were taken and the results were averaged to obtain a mean value. Water adsorption, in percentage, was calculated as follows: (2) W a t e r a d s o r p t i o n % = m f - m 0 m 0 x 100 where m f is the sample weight at RH (%) condition and m 0 is the sample weight at 0 % RH. The oxygen permeation tests of blend films were performed using an Oxysense 525oi device (Oxysense, USA) equipped with a film permeation chamber. This machine was operated according to ASTM Method F3136-15. The test was performed at standard laboratory conditions, i.e., 23 °C and 40 % relative humidity. The permeation chamber consisted of a cylinder divided into two parts (sensing well and driving well). The films were cut into rectangular pieces (6 cm × 6 cm) and placed between two wells in the testing module. The sensing well is equipped with a fluorescence sensor called oxydots, which measures oxygen concentration. This chamber was purged with nitrogen while the other one (driving well) was kept open to ambient air. An OxySense fiber optic pen measured the oxygen reading from the oxydots, at specific time intervals. Oxygen transmission rates (OTRs) of the blend films were measured by monitoring the oxygen uptake with time using Oxysense OTR software. At least ten measurements were taken for each sample with a minimum coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.95."
10,Results and discussions,
11,Extraction analysis by UPLS-MS/MS,"3.1 Extraction analysis by UPLS-MS/MS The main aim of this work was not to extract a particular antioxidant molecule at high purity from waste tealeaves (previously extracted once with water), but to entirely valorize waste tealeaves by treating them with a simple single-step approach. In previous works, the solution of some vegetables in acid solutions have promoted the hydrolysis and partially dissolved lignocellulosic mass (Rahimi, Ulbrich, Coon, & Stahl, 2014). Cellulose is also known to react partially with formic acid at room temperature without any catalyst, being transformed into cellulose formate that dissolves in formic acid (Fujimoto, Takahashi, Tsuji, Miyamoto, & Inagaki, 1986). Moreover, treating waste tealeaves in formic acid may have produced reasonable amounts of organic extract that can function as antioxidants for polymers. Hence, high resolution liquid chromatography was conducted to identify some of these molecules obtained in formic acid after the insoluble part of waste tealeaves were filtered out. As reference, extracts obtained from raw tealeaves in water (labeled as ‘Tea water’), waste tealeaves in water (Teaw water), and raw tealeaves in formic acid (Tea FA) were also analyzed and represented in Fig. 2 a. The peaks of the major species eluted from the chromatographic column at a given retention time were identified and labeled from 1 to 12. The molecular assignment and quantification of all peaks as well as the calculated percentage of the identified molecules are reported in Table 1 . In agreement with previous works (Yashin, Nemzer, Combet, & Yashin, 2015), gallated catechins, such as epigallocatechingallate and epicatechingallate, were present as major components in all tea extracts. In particular, the main peaks were attributed to polyphenolic compounds such as epigallocatechingallate (EGCG; 1), epicatechingallate (ECG; 2), epigallocatechin (EGC; 3) and epicatechin (EC; 4). Inspection of Table 1 indicated that water can extract significant amounts (∼88 %) of non-gallated catechins from tea waste, whereas formic acid favors gallated catechins by 96 %. From the results of Table 1, it appears that only two major flavanols can be extracted by formic acid from the waste tealeaves, namely EGCG and ECG with a minor amount of EGC. EGCG is known to be one of the most effective antioxidant and also cancer chemo-preventive polyphenol (Du et al., 2012; Lee, Kim, Kim, & Kim, 2014). This could be mainly attributed to the fact that water (even at room temperature) already extracts significant amounts of flavanols from green tealeaves. However, as can be seen in Table 1, formic acid still performed better than water in extracting major flavanols from waste tealeaves at room temperature. Flavanols extracted from fresh tealeaves with formic acid also feature high concentrations or percentages of EGCG, ECG and EGC, similar to the case of water. However, formic acid extract is a strong oxidant and more reactive than water. This could result in some reactions between flavanols and formic acid such as hydrolysis and oxidation of polyphenols. Note the color diversity of solutions in Fig. 2a (Dai et al., 2017). In summary (see last rows of Table 1), room temperature aqueous tealeaves extracts are both rich in gallated and non-gallated flavanols, whereas, formic acid solutions of waste tealeaves are rich in gallated catechins, such as EGCG and ECG, with less than 5 % non-gallated flavanols. This is not considered to be disadvantageous due to the fact that gallated catechins show very strong antioxidant and scavenging activity against radical species, such as DPPH and ABTS + (Namal Senanayake, 2013). Note, however, that DPPH assay is sensitive to acidic pH levels (Molyneux, 2004). Hence, for the antioxidant characterization of tea extracts in formic acid in terms of IC50 levels and values, we only worked with ABTS + protocol results. Even though water is still able to extract antioxidants from waste tealeaves, the last two rows of Table 1 show that formic acid is much more effective in extracting gallated catechins that are more potent antioxidants than non-gallated catechins. Interestingly, Fig. 2b showed that formic acid extracts had a distinctive peak at 2.5 min. This peak corresponds to a mass-to charge ratio (m/z) of ∼333.1 g/mol, which was typical of barceloneic acid B (BA). This polyphenol was also an anticancer compound commonly found in the fungus, Penicillium albocoreium (Overy et al., 2005). The presence of such an unexpected compound in the acidic tea extract solution demonstrated that potential reactions of formic acid with certain compounds left over in tea waste could take place that can create other useful and naturally found polyphenols. In the case of discarded balsamic vinegar, we did not conduct UPLC-MS/MS analysis as no extraction or chemical processing of the as-received balsamic vinegar was conducted that would require further chemical analysis. Moreover, there were very accurate publications on the comprehensive metabolite composition of balsamic vinegars as well as antioxidants (Pinu, De Carvalho-Silva, Trovatti Uetanabaro, & Villas-Boas, 2016). Since the reason of discarding was related to acidity that relays taste, its chemical composition should be very similar to well-documented balsamic vinegars. As such, traditional balsamic vinegars contain significant amounts of polyphenols, and among them, tannins contributed to about 50 % of the antioxidant activity of the total polyphenolic fraction. The residual antioxidant activity was due to the melanoidins (Tagliazucchi, Verzelloni, & Conte, 2008; Zhu & Edgren, 2010)."
12,Chemical characterization by ATR-FTIR,"3.2 Chemical characterization by ATR-FTIR Fig. 3 a shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of the most representative samples of both tea waste and discarded balsamic vinegar. On the left side of the image, the ATR-FTIR spectra of waste tealeaves (previously extracted once with water, labeled ‘Tea’), PVA cast from water (PVAw), PVA cast from formic acid (PVAf), the PVA containing 50 wt.% waste tealeaves extract (T50) are represented. Similarly, the ATR-FTIR spectra of discarded balsamic vinegar, PVA cast from water (PVAw) and PVA films containing discarded balsamic vinegar 10 wt.% (V10) and 50 wt.% (V50) are represented in the right side of Fig. 3a. In general, the infrared spectrum of PVA displayed typical absorption bands such as OH stretching mode at 3277 cm−1, asymmetric and symmetric CH2 stretching modes at 2935 and 2852 cm−1, respectively, CO stretching mode from residual acetate groups at 1682 cm−1, CH2 bending mode at 1420 cm−1, and CO stretch (attributable to secondary hydroxyl groups) at 1086 cm−1 (Krimm, Liang, & Sutherland, 1956; Millikan & Kenneth, 1958). In the case of PVAf, in addition to PVA vibrations, two new absorptions (i.e., CO and CO stretching modes at 1701 and 1171 cm−1, respectively) related to the carboxyl group of formic acid appeared (Bellamy, 1975). On the other hand, the main assignments for the dry tea extract from formic acid solutions are OH stretching mode at 3283 cm−1, asymmetric and symmetric CH2 stretching modes at 2917 and 2981 cm−1, respectively, ester CO stretching at 1730 cm−1, CC stretching mode of aromatics at 1615 cm−1, and the CO stretching at 1015 cm−1 (Ciolacu, Oprea, Anghel, & Cazacu, 2012). These bands can be associated with the main molecules (EGCG and ECG) found in the tea extract by UPLC analysis. Upon blending PVA and tea waste extracts, their relevant ATR-FTIR spectra featured all the characteristic bands of both PVA and tea extract, respectively. As an example, the T50 spectrum is demonstrated in Fig. 3(a). The infrared spectra of vinegar composites show characteristic bands of vinegar and PVA. The spectrum presents a peak at 1800 cm−1 that is attributed to the vibration of carbonyl group of the organic acids. The vibrations of CC of aromatic rings at 1600–1580 cm−1 are identified as polyphenols and a strong peak at 1100 cm−1 is attributed to the presence of sugars. V10 and V50 are used as examples in Fig. 3a. A more careful analysis of the FTIR spectra of PVA blended in Fig. 3b indicates that a shift in OH stretching region depending on the relative concentrations, towards lower wavenumber in tea waste samples, and towards higher wavenumbers in discarded vinegar blends. These shifts were analyzed in depth in Fig. 3c for tea waste samples. The position of this absorption significantly decreased from 3460 cm−1 for T5 to 3280 cm−1 for T50 (a reduction of 180 cm−1) as plotted in Fig. 3c. The OH stretching wavenumber for T50 was found to be close to that of waste tealeaves (3275 cm−1). From this, the energy of the H-bonds (EH ) was calculated as follows: (3) E H = 1 k ∙ ν 0 - ν ν 0 where k is a constant with a value of 1.68 × 10−2 kcal−1, ν0 is the standard wavenumber of the OH stretching mode ascribed to hydroxyl groups that do not interact by H-bonds (3600 cm−1), and ν is the experimental wavenumber of the samples. As reported in Fig. 3c, the EH as parameter was increased with the tea content. Interestingly, the energy of H-bonds for T20 and T50 was higher than the value for PVAf (calculated as 4.53 kcal from a wavenumber of 3339 cm−1), indicating that the polyphenols at high concentrations can reinforce the H-bonding network of PVA matrixes. By the same token, it can be argued that presence of discarded vinegar in PVA matrix decreases H-bonding energy and this might be partially reflected as plasticization effect as opposed to tealeaves waste extract containing films (Dai et al., 2017)."
13,Microstructural analysis,"3.3 Microstructural analysis Top surface and cross section SEM images of the selected films such as PVAf, PVAw, T50 and V50 blends were analyzed in this section. The top-surface morphologies of films were given in Fig. S4 a–d (Supporting Information). All films appeared to have uniform and homogenous micro-structure. Cross-section morphology of PVA films cast from water and formic acid appear to be very smooth as seen in Fig. 4 a and b. Particularly, however, PVA films containing waste tealeaves extract in formic acid, such as T50 in Fig. 4c, showed rougher cross section features due to fine lignocellulosic tea residues found in the samples (more micro-structural details can be seen in Fig. S4 e–h). The PVA film continuing 50 wt.% discarded balsamic vinegar (V50) has much more homogeneous cross-section morphology, as seen in Fig. 4d."
14,Fluorescence analysis,"3.4 Fluorescence analysis In order to investigate the dispersion of waste tealeaves molecules in PVA matrix, the well-known fluorescence emission from catechins (Namal Senanayake, 2013; Vuong et al., 2011) was considered. The emission spectra of all PVA-tea waste films (thickness normalized) were shown in Fig. 5 with excitation at 280 nm. The SEM cross section of the T20 film (Fig. 5b) and the corresponding fluorescence confocal microscope image of the same cross section were shown in Fig. 5c. Sample T5 had a weak and broad emission band located at around 360 nm associated with polyphenols in low concentrations (Snitsarev, Young, Miller, & Rotella, 2013). In T10, this band was much better defined and centered around 350 nm, since the concentration of EGCG, the main polyphenol present in all samples, increased. T10 sample spectra also demonstrated a weak shoulder around 430 nm. Some aromatic polyphenols were known to have emission at around 450 nm. For instance, hydroxycinnamic acids were known to have strong emission peaks at around 450 nm. This was related to their aromatic structure and conformal forms (fluorophores) that can become more abundant at higher concentrations due to their aromatic structure (Snitsarev et al., 2013). In T20 this shoulder was more apparent and broader indicating such an effect. In the case of T50, however, the concentration dependent trend reverses as the main band maximum shifts towards 375 nm. This was attributed to quenching effect of catechin-catechin interactions, as observed in other natural compound blends studied using fluorescence spectroscopy (Institute of Chemistry FEBRAS et al., 2017; Martelli et al., 2017). Moreover, at high concentrations, catechins were known to aggregate both in solution and in soft polymeric matrices and this was well correlated with the quenching of fluorescence intensities (Snitsarev et al., 2013; Trnková, Boušová, Staňková, & Dršata, 2011). This was also confirmed in our case in which fluorescence spectra of highly concentrated tea waste films demonstrated similar shifts, lower intensity and broader emission peaks (see inset, Fig. 5a). Nonetheless, the fluorescence image from a randomly chosen T20 sample cross-section (Fig. 5c) indicated homogeneously dispersed catechins within the composite films."
15,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of PVA films and PVA-waste blends are summarized in Fig. 6. Stress-strain curves of tea waste-PVA and discarded vinegar-PVA samples are plotted in Fig. 6 a and c. Interestingly, residual formic acid in PVAf functioned as a plasticizer for PVA increasing its elongation at break value 10 times compared to water-based PVA films (compare Fig. 6a PVAf with Fig. 6c, PVAw). The plasticizing effect of formic acid molecules can be attributed to their small molecular size that can interact with the PVA polymer chains via hydrogen bonding decreasing the interchain interaction. The same effect was observed in the case of trifluoroacetic acid processed PVA films (Guzman-Puyol et al., 2015). Formic acid extracts of waste tealeaves at low concentrations, <10 wt.%, in PVA did not significantly alter the properties of the PVAf matrix, with slight changed in elongation at break and elastic modulus values, see Fig. 6a and b. After 20 wt.% and above, tea waste concentration in PVA increased the stiffness of the films transforming them into a brittle state, as shown in Fig. 6c. This observation could be explained by the hydrogen-bond interactions as shown in the ATR-FTIR measurements of Fig. 3, and the increasing lignocellulosic content along with catechins hat would hinder movement of polymer chains (see Fig. 3c). Mechanical properties of pure PVAw and films based on discarded vinegar were shown in Fig. 6c and d. Discarded balsamic vinegar inclusion were found to enhance the elongation of PVAw films and reduce the Young’s modulus almost 3 times at 50 wt.% concentration. This is attributed to the organic acids (mainly acetic acid) content of balsamic vinegar along with some naturally occurring glycerol in balsamic vinegar (Sanarico, Motta, Bertolini, & Antonelli, 2003; Tagliazucchi et al., 2008). This observation is quite unique in the sense that discarded balsamic vinegars can be used in water-based PVA formulations as natural plasticizers with antioxidant properties."
16,Antioxidant activity,"3.6 Antioxidant activity The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of formic acid and water extractions of fresh tealeaves and waste tealeaves (previously extracted once with water), and discarded vinegar were determined (see Fig. S1, Supporting Information) (Ghasemi, Ghasemi, & Ebrahimzadeh, 2009). Note that herein, IC50 is a measure of the potential of the antioxidants in inhibiting oxidation of a select target such as ABTS+ . More specifically, it is the antioxidant concentration that neutralizes the 50 % of the free radicals in solution. Comparing two similar effects, lower IC50 value indicates more effective antioxidant activity. As such, formic acid extracts of fresh tealeaves and waste tealeaves had IC50 values of ∼8.1 and ∼73.1 μg /mL, respectively. On the other hand, water extracts of fresh tealeaves and waste tealeaves had IC50 values of ∼8.6 and ∼73.4 μg/mL, respectively. As expected, waste tealeaves solutions had lower antioxidant effect than fresh tealeaves solutions regardless of water or formic acid extraction. However, IC50 values of formic acid extracts were close and even slightly lower than those of water extracts indicating that formic acid did not pose any negative effect on the antioxidant activity toward ABTS+ . The IC50 value for discarded vinegar was found to be ∼1846.7 μg/mL that is two orders of magnitude higher than any of the tea extracts discussed above. However, compared to other vegetable or fruit wastes such as citrus fruits peels (IC50 ∼3600 μg /mL), the antioxidant potential of discarded balsamic vinegar was still significant (Ghasemi et al., 2009). The antioxidant activity of tea waste-PVA films, T, and discarded balsamic vinegar, V, is reported in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7a and b demonstrated inhibition of ABTS+ (water medium) by both films. As can be seen, PVA films containing 20 % and 50 % waste tealeaves extracts can inhibit ABTS+ within 2–6 h, respectively. T10 film achieved 100 % inhibition after 24 h of measurement in water. T5 film on the other hand, reached about 70 % inhibition level after 24 h due to the much lower concentrations of extracted antioxidants. Inspecting Fig. 7b showed that none of the discarded balsamic vinegar containing PVA films achieved 100 % inhibition of ABTS+ . This appears to be in agreement with much higher IC50 values found for pure discarded vinegar. However, films V20 and V50 could reach to approximately 90 % inhibition levels within about 3 days. Films V5 and V10 reached to much lower inhibition levels of 70 % and 40 %, respectively, at the end of 3 days of monitoring. For the case of inhibition of DPPH in ethanol medium, PVA-tea waste films demonstrated very potent inhibition effect as seen in Fig. 7c. All films reached 100 % inhibition levels at end of 24 h, including T5 and T10 films. Note that the test medium is DPPH dispersed ethanol in which the films were immersed. Ethanol is not a solvent for PVA whereas water is. As such, it can be argued that in the case of water (ABTS+ test method), at a given time (i.e., 6 h), there might be more antioxidants released in the medium and the release of antioxidants could be faster since water swelled and eventually should dissolve the PVA films. In the case of ethanol, lower quantities of antioxidant might be present at a given time. Nonetheless, DPPH appeared to be very a sensitive and easily quenched even at lower antioxidant concentrations. It is also very sensitive to the pH of the measurement environment and adsorbed/residual formic acid could also influence the measurements. It has been indicated that ABTS+ assay may be more useful than DPPH assay for detecting antioxidant capacity for fruits, vegetables and beverages compared to other foodstuffs (Floegel, Kim, Chung, Koo, & Chun, 2011). PVA films containing discarded balsamic vinegar responded much more slowly in DPPH assay tests. As such, the DPPH assay tests were extremely slow, spanning into several days with 50 % of inhibition readings only for the highest concentration films (V50) (see Fig. S3 in Supporting Information). This could be related to the specific interactions between DPPH and polymeric or oligomeric antioxidants in balsamic vinegar that were not found in tealeaves waste. DPPH method has been shown to be very sensitive to the release medium as opposed to ABTS+ (Dawidowicz, Wianowska, & Olszowy, 2012). Moreover, a recent report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) showed that PVA films cast from water solutions are insoluble in ethanol and diffusion of food hydrocolloids from such films to ethanol is hindered (Lopes and Simoneau, 2014). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of films (T10, T50, V10 and V50) were compared with other published polymeric films containing various antioxidants (Eça, Machado, Hubinger, & Menegalli, 2015; Tongnuanchan, Benjakul, & Prodpran, 2012) in Fig. 7d. Table 2 summarizes these results along with the present study measurements in terms of the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) in μmoles of trolox/g dried film. To obtain these values, films were immersed in ABTS+ and DPPH assay solutions for one hour. Based on the comparisons shown in Fig. 7d and Table 2, all films demonstrated rather competitive performance in terms of μmol trolox/ gram dried film considering that the antioxidants in the PVA films originate from food waste. More specifically, tea waste-PVA films had superior performance in ABTS+ assay with results ranging from ∼4.0 to ∼13.1 μmoles of trolox/g dried film for T10 and T50, respectively; whereas discarded balsamic vinegar films showed ∼2.7 and ∼5.1 μmoles of trolox for V10 and V50, respectively. For the DPPH assay, ∼4.5 and ∼8.5 μmoles of trolox/g dried film were measured for T10 and T50 films, respectively. Certain gelatin films from fish skin containing antioxidants such as lemon extract displayed slightly better results, see Table 2 and Fig. 7d (Tongnuanchan et al., 2012)."
17,Water uptake and oxygen gas permeability,"3.7 Water uptake and oxygen gas permeability Water uptake properties of all fabricated films were studied by measuring water adsorption levels under different humidity conditions, as shown in Fig. 8 a and b. T5 and T10 samples had the lowest water adsorption levels spanning the whole range of relative humidity compared to pure PVA films. Increasing tea waste concentration further, reversed this trend and water uptake levels increased significantly particularly after 50 % RH for both T20 and T50 films. This could be due to increase levels of other cellulosic biomass that react with water incorporating it into the structure (Eça et al., 2015; Haghighi et al., 2019). On the other hand, vinegar containing films (Fig. 8b) were found to be more sensitive to relative humidity, and particularly after 80 % RH, water uptake levels of all films were almost doubled compared to the tea waste films. This tendency was also observed by (Rodsamran & Sothornvit, 2019) in which films with higher concentrations of glycerol exhibited higher moisture uptake. The oxygen barrier properties of pure PVAw and PVAf films and films with 20 wt.% of waste, namely V20 and T20 (normalized with thickness) are displayed in Fig. 8c. PVAf films featured lower oxygen barrier performance compared to PVAw films due to formic acid induced changes in the morphology of PVA (see for instance Fig. 6). Nonetheless, introducing tealeaves waste extract reduces oxygen permeability to even lower levels compared to pure PVAw. This could be attributed in part to the strong chemical scavenging effect of the polyphenols rather than physical barrier formation. More interestingly, PVA films containing discarded balsamic vinegar, namely V20 was found to have the lowest oxygen permeability values. This could be due to the presence of high-polarity groups and the bulk structure observed in the cross-section images of Fig. 4."
18,Conclusions,"In summary, two major industrially processed plant food wastes (green tea and balsamic vinegar) have been effectively valorized by following a simple one-pot plastic fabrication process. Efficient antioxidant biopolymers were made from used green tea and quality control failed discarded balsamic vinegar. Formic acid was used to extract useful organics from dried tea waste while simultaneously dissolving PVA. Discarded vinegar was blended with a water solution of PVA and in both cases antioxidant films were produced by solution casting and drying. The polymer could be loaded up to 50 wt.% by both waste components allowing an optimal valorization of useful organics from both discarded foodstuffs. Formic acid enabled extraction of gallated catechins with very high yields (>95 %) from tea waste including a powerful biomedical compounded known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Both formic acid (residual) and balsamic vinegar effectively plasticized PVA with elongation at break values of 150 % and 30 %, respectively. Tea waste extracts exhibited better inhibitory concentration levels (IC50) of ∼73.1 μg/mL and discarded vinegar ∼1846.7 μg/mL. As such, tealeaves waste extracts demonstrated inhibitory levels comparable to other natural blends. Particularly balsamic vinegar -PVA films had better oxygen barrier properties than pure PVA with better elasticity. This makes them attractive in flexible antioxidant packaging applications."
