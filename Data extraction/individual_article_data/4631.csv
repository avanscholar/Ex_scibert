0,Introduction,"In natural processes and in industrial production, the controlled selective catalytic oxidation of organic molecules, especially alcohols, is ubiquitous for the construction of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds and heterocycles. Traditionally, these reactions are achieved by stoichiometric inorganic oxidants such as permanganate, chromate, and SeO2, which may cause overoxidation and produce environmentally lethal wastes [1–3]. Even with economic and non-polluted dioxygen as oxidant [4], expensive Pd and Au complexes or nanoparticles, redox-active TEMPO (TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl) radicals or nitrogen-coped graphene were usually necessary [5–15]. Recently, copper-based catalysts have received widespread attention for dioxygen oxidation of alcohols, due to their advantages of lower price, abundant resource and wide distribution of Cu-containing oxidases in vivo [16,17]. However, extra base or expensive nitroxyl derivatives as co-catalysts were also required to overcome some drawbacks, such as narrow substrate scope, high temperature or poor selectivity of product [18,19]. Therefore, from atom-efficient and environmentally friendly view of points, exploring an efficient Cu catalyst, which suit for dioxygen oxidations of alcohols under TEMPO/base-free condition, still has important practical meaning [20–22]. Recently, to achieve the aerobic oxidation of alcohols, Arndtsen and co-workers successfully employedbiomimetic Cu/DBED catalyst system. The approach exhibited remarkable oxidation activity for various alcohols by mimicking tyrosinase without using N-oxide as co-catalyst. However, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) asadditional base was necessary [22]. In addition, significant effort has been made to try to understand the oxidation mechanisms of alcohols, and to determine how copper reacts with O2 and how “Cux-O2” intermediates interact with substrate CH bonds [17,23–26]. Generally, there are three classes of mechanisms on aerobic oxidation reactions promoted by copper: single-electron transfer from substrates to CuII, organometallic mechanism, redox cooperativity between CuII and redox-active nitroxyl co-catalyst. Recent studies showed that water molecule played an important role in the process of the aerobic oxidation of alcohols [27–29]. Stahl and coworkers demonstrated that the presence of water led to the deactivation of catalyst and decreased reaction rates in copper/TEMPO system [27]. The Li group revealed that water or methanol was involved in the process of H-transfer in Au-catalyzed system [28]. The discovery of the latter is important because the existence of water is nearly unavoidable in practical system for alcohol oxidation. To pursue a more environmentally friendly oxidative method and further understand the role of water moleculars in copper-based and TEMPO-free system, we wish to develop an efficient dioxygen catalytic system for the selective oxidation of alcohols under mild conditions. This idea was inspired by our previous report of copper complexes with hydroxylated bipyridyl-like ligands [30,31]. Of these complexes, the neutral dinuclear complex Cu2(ophen)2 (Fig. 1 , Hophen=2-hydroxy-1,10-phenanthroline) shows interesting and catalyst-related features: (a) planar butterfly-like dinuclear structures with two Cu(I) centers as the “body” and two peripheral ophen rings as “wings”; (b) existence of coordinately unsaturated Cu(I) atoms; (c) easiness to be one-electron oxidized into mixed-valent CuICuII(ophen)2 fragment. All these features suggest that the Cu2(ophen)2 complex might be an efficient catalyst for the selective aerobic oxidation of alcohols. In addition, the defined structure of the dinuclear complex is better than that of systems composed of copper salt/ligands, providing a good platform for mechanistic investigation. Herein, we present our preliminary observation and mechanistic investigation of the selective dioxygen oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by the dinuclear complex Cu2(ophen)2 in the absence of TEMPO and base. To do this, we performed a combination of DFT and ESI(+)(−)-MS experimental study. Two distinct reaction courses of dioxygen and hydroperoxide oxidative dehydrogenations, featuring successive dioxygen activation from mixed-valentcopper(I,II)-superoxide to all-divalent copper(II)-peroxide species were revealed. Additionally, the role of H2O asa proton mediator in the Cu2-O2 catalytic cycle was clarified."
1,Results and discussion,"In the previous study, we found that coordinately unsaturated Cu(I) atoms of Cu2(ophen)2 can be easily oxidized into CuICuII(ophen)2 fragment [30,31]. Therefore, we speculated that the dinuclear complex would combine with oxygen and the interaction will make dioxygen molecule active. The combination of “L2Cu2-O2” may be an efficient promoter for some aerobic oxidation reactions. To test this idea, a series of probe tests were conducted. The oxidative reaction of benzylalcohol was investigated as model reaction. After carefulscreening of different parameters (Table S1), we found that the oxidation reaction proceeded smoothly in CH3CN at 60°C after addition of 5mol% Cu2(ophen)2 as catalyst with dioxygen as oxidant in the absence of nitroxyl co-catalyst and any base. The conversions of ethanol and benzyl alcohol were as high as 89% (O2 bubbling) and 92% (O2 ball), respectively. Obviously, the extraordinary activity of aerobic oxidative reaction was attributed to the Cu2(ophen)2 active species."
2,Oxidation of other alcohols,"2.1 Oxidation of other alcohols To extend the application of this efficient activator of dioxygen, we then examined the generality of the oxidative reaction. As shown in Table 1 , the oxidation reactions of primary benzyl alcohols with electron-rich (1b-e, h-j) or electron-deficient (1f-g) aryl groups and heteroaryl groups (1k-l) can afford corresponding aldehydes in excellent conversions. Surprisingly, the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of oxidizable NH2 (1h) was also be achieved. Substrates 1c, 1d and 1e bearing a methoxy group at para, meta and ortho positions of phenyl ring resulted in the target products 2c, 2d, and 2e, respectively, in high conversions. The results indicated that the position of substituents in aromatic rings had no obvious effect on the oxidation of mono-substituted benzyl alcohols. Bis-substituted o-benzyl alcohols 1m was selected to examine potential steric effect, and the corresponding product 2m with low to medium conversion indicated that increased further steric hindrance limited the reaction. Aromatic-substituted secondary alcohols (1n-p) showed good activity with medium to excellent conversions. Terephthalaldehyde 2q was obtained in high conversion, which indicated that dihydric benzyl alcohol was oxidized smoothly. Further testing the catalytic activity by the oxidation of non-activated aliphatic primary alcohols (1r-t) unfortunately showed low conversions. Importantly, using oxygen bubbling instead of an oxygen ball, significantly improved the effectiveness of primary alcohols oxidation (2r and 2s), but conversion still remained relatively low for secondary alcohol (2t). Importantly, we found that the amount of water had a large influence on the reaction rate and the conversion during oxidation. Using commercially alcohols in which with trace amounts of water as reactants, the reaction proceeded smoothly under optimized condition. However, the reaction rate and conversion rate decreased remarkably when experiments were conducted under conditions with larger amounts of water (≥10%) or without water (Fig. S1). All experimental results showed that the trace amount of water in the raw material promoted the oxidation process of alcohol. In order to verify the major oxidation species in this oxidative process, 2.0 equiv of benzoquinone (BQ, O2 − quencher) was used to examine the existence of O2 −. Adding BQ into the reaction system of 1a after 2h, we found that the oxidative process was completely shut down, affording only 59% upon standing for 10 h (Fig. S2). The great influence of BQ on the oxidation showed that the reaction was caused by O2 − to a large degree. To gain further insight into the reaction mechanism, a combined DFT and ESI(+)(−)-MS experimental study was performed. Using the oxidation of ethanol asan example, the ESI-MS spectrum suggested the presence of key species in the oxidative process (Figs. S3–7)."
3,Plausible mechanism of oxidation of alcohol,"2.2 Plausible mechanism of oxidation of alcohol The DFT study results indicated that two oxidative dehydrogenation processes occurred (Fig. 2 , S1–S22, Tables S3–9), featuring superoxide/peroxide (I) and hydroperoxide (II) (Scheme 1 ). (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH + O 2 → Cu 2 ( ophen ) 2 CH 3 CH = O + H 2 O 2 (2) CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O 2 → Cu 2 ( ophen ) 2 CH 3 CH = O + 2 H 2 O The DFT calculations showed that dioxygen tends to adsorb the Cu atom of Cu2(ophen)2 (1, M+ = 515.972, Fig. S3) with superoxide end-on Cu-OO (2, Figs. S4, 8–11) and end-end Cu-OO-Cu (2′, [M+H]+ = 548.967, [M+H]2+ = 274.988, Figs. S4, 8–11) styles via Cu/dz 2 and O2/π∗ orbitals. Two styles could be mutually transformed via transition state (TS-O2, ΔG of −0.1kcal/mol) despite that the former was slightly disfavored in energy(ΔE, 2.6kcal/mol). The adsorption energy (11.9–14.5kcal/mol) and the CuO bond length (1.98–2.14 Å) implied a moderate interaction between superoxide O2 − and copper ions. The end-on OO and end-end OO distances were 1.30 Å and 1.34 Å, respectively, in agreement with known superoxide bond lengths [23–25,32,33]. In this point, it wasn't much different from the Tyrosinase and its biomimetic models containing a dinuclear copper active site. Among them, the active species of activating CH bonds are μ-η 2:η 2-peroxo-coordinated dioxygen complexes [34]. In process I, after the dioxygen molecule was activated in superoxide and peroxide modes (Fig. 2), the ethanol was directly inserted into the vacant site of Cu to form co-adsorbed complex (3) via hydrogen bonding and CuO (2.23 Å) weak bonding interactions (EtOH⋯O2 −, Et = CH2CH3, M+ = 593.999, Fig. S5). Subsequently, another ethanol or H2O could then insert into the 6-member ring via hydrogen bond to form 4 (EtOH⋯EtOH⋯O2 −, [M+H]2+ = 321.027, Figs. S6b, S16, 19, or EtOH⋯H2O⋯O2 − M± = 612.017, Figs. S6d, S16, 20). The two wings of Cu2(ophen)2 folded with a barrier of 11.0kcal/mol (TS-fold) to yield the semi-closed reactive intermediate 5/5w (Fig. 2, S16). The similar trend for the energy profiles and the very close data demonstrated that the insertion of EtOH (Fig. 2, black line) and H2O (Fig. 2, blue line) was competitive. Likely H2O would become more favorable for the oxidation of large-sized alcohol, because (i) it can free up active-site space to alleviate crowding of reactant molecules, (ii) it has two OH groups and thus inserts faster than alcohols, and (iii) it migrates and rotates much faster than alcohols in solvent medium. The model was clearly supported by our experiments (Fig. S1). In addition, the role of water moleculeas a protonmediator was also observed for dioxygenelectrochemistry in Au surface [35]. It should be noted that too much water led to the deactivation of catalyst and the decrease of reaction rates, consistent with previous report [27]. The formation of intermediate 5 (Figs. 2, S21) was a landmark, based on which an electron could further transfer from Cu(I) to hydroxyl of EtOH to give all-divalent dicopper species. This would promote the migration of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of EtOH via two routes to O2 − (EtOH⋯ROH⋯O2, R = Et, H) to yield 6 with (EtO⋯ROH⋯OOH) peroxide species. For both routes (R = Et, H) the calculated barriers of 12.7–15.4kcal/mol (TS-H1 ) suggested that the formation of peroxide OOH can be achieved under mild conditions, in agreement with our experiments. The elimination process of methylene hydrogen atom was the rate-determining step and might originate by electronic pairing from 6 (triplet state) to 7([M+H]2+ = 275.995, singlet state, Fig. S7). After overcoming the highest energy obstacle (24.1–26.2kcal/mol, TS-H2 ), the acetaldehyde was formed and desorbed promptly into the solvent phase, and the all-divalent dicoppercenter was reduced to the initial monovalent Cu2(ophen)2 species, leaving H2O2 weakly adsorbed on the surface. Based on above results, we revealed a novel reaction mechanism in which water molecule as economical proton mediator promoted the dioxygen activation and migration of hydrogen atom (process I). Different from the copper/TEMPO system of alcohol oxidation, costly TEMPO plays a role of stabilizing “LxCu-O2” intermediate [26a] or transferring H-atom [26b]. Experimentally, we did not detect H2O2 in product mixture formed in process I, implying this environmentally friendly active byproduct was consumed directly for further oxidation of alcohol or decomposed promptly into O2 and H2O. To investigate the oxidation of alcohols by hydrogen peroxide, we tested the experiments of Cu2(ophen)2 and H2O2 on a variety of ROH (R=Et, PhCH2) and found that reaction rate of H2O2 was 8–24 times faster than that of O2, with the same excellent yields (Table S2). As shown in Figs. 3 , S7, S15, S17, the H2O2 adsorbs weakly on Cu2(ophen)2 via hydrogen-bond (7, [M+H]2± = 275.995), and then OO homolytic cleavage and two-electron transfer yield all-divalent dicopper-hydroxyl species (8); this was the rate-determining step (TS-cleave, ΔG of 26.7kcal/mol) in process II. Subsequently, the torsion of the catalyst generated the semi-closed (9) (dihedral angle from 175 to 90.0°. EtOH adsorbed on the upper surface in two potential ways (10 and 10′, Figs. S15, 17) and in both cases hydroxyl and methylene hydrogen atoms of EtOH could be transferred easily. The last step from (11 and 11′, Figs. S15, 17) to initial (1) yielded CH3CHO, accompanied by two-electron reduction of the dicopper species. After the reaction finished, strong ESI-MS signals of dicopper species were detected and the debris signals were not directly observed, which revealed that the dinuclear complex was complete and stable. We also calculated the dioxygen oxidation of the aromatic medium-sized C6H5CH2OH, which revealed a similar mechanism to that of EtOH (Figs. S18, 22)."
4,Conclusions,"To summarize, we demonstrated that the planar butterfly-like Cu2(ophen)2complex shows superior activating ability for dioxygen. In the absence of nitroxyl co-catalysts and bases, the complex can be used as a catalyst for the selective oxidation of alcohols under the dioxygen atmosphere. Furthermore, DFT calculations and ESI-MS experiments showed that two distinct processes were involved in the selective oxidation of alcohols. A series of shape changes of the Cu-complex, from “stretched to folded to stretched” occurred during two catalyzed cycles. Importantly, we revealed that water molecule can serve as a proton mediator in the L2Cu2-O2 cyclical process."
5,Materials and methods,"All chemicals were received from chemical suppliers commercially without further purification. Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were recorded by Agilent 7820A (FID detector from AGILENT 7820). ESI-MS spectra were obtained using Thermo Scientific Q Exactive. All results reported in this study were performed at the DFT level by using the Amsterdam density functional (ADF2014.10) program package [36–38]. Full geometry optimizations were carried out by using the PBE [39] functional together with Grimme’s dispersion correction [40] (denoted PBE-D3) and the ZORA-optimized TZP all-electron basis sets [41,42], in the presence of the COSMO [43] solvent model (acetonitrile, ε = 35.7). The ionic radii which actually define the cavity in the COSMO are 1.700, 1.350, 1.517, 1.608 and 1.883 Å for C, H, O, N and Cu, respectively. The value of the numerical integration parameter was 5.5. The geometry optimizations were followed by vibrational frequency analysis (analytically) to verify that the optimized structures are minima (zero imaginary frequency) or transition states (one imaginary frequency). The enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and Gibbs free energies (G) are calculated by using TAMkin [44] python package. For all of the open-shell complexes, the unrestricted DFT approach was used."
