0,Introduction,"The great advance in the development of human society achieved in last century has also caused tremendous energetic and environmental problems. Benefiting from the Honda-Fujishima effect discovered in 1972 [1], solar driven photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting was realized and has been studied extensively as a promising solution to address those issues [2–6]. Various semiconductors such as oxides [7–9], metal sulfides [10–12], and oxynitrides [13,14] have been investigated as potential candidates for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution through water splitting. However, none of them meet the needs for practical application, and visible light responsive photocatalyst with excellent charge separation ability and high solution stability still remains as a huge challenge. Among the various semiconductor photocatalysts which were developed in last decades for photocatalytic H2 evolution, Zinc cadmium sulfide (Zn0.5Cd0.5S) has received considerable attention due to its appropriate bandgap and high photocatalytic activity [15–17]. In addition, Zn0.5Cd0.5S also exhibits many excellent properties for practical application, including high stability, simple to synthesize and elemental abundant in natural reserves [18,19]. However, its intrinsic drawbacks, in particular low specific surface area, fast charge recombination and narrow light absorption range, have inhibited the further development of Zn0.5Cd0.5S and should be well addressed. The catalytic activities of Zn0.5Cd0.5S are determined the morphology and the micro crystal structure [20]. To enhance the photocatalytic activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, loading suitable co-catalysts to capture photo-induced charges and provide rich active sites for surface redox reaction has been demonstrated to be a useful approach. To date, various co-catalysts have been employed to combine with sulfides, including noble metals [21–23], transition metal oxides [24–26], transition metal sulfides [27–29], and hydroxides [30]. However, the most effective major co-catalysts today are predominantly relied on high-cost precious metals which are not suitable for large scale applications [31,32]. Therefore, it is an urgent task to explore the catalytic ability of low-cost non-noble metal co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Recently, transition-metal phosphides have been studied as co-catalysts, and several groups have shown that transition-metal phosphides, such as Co2P [33], Cu3P [34,35], CoP [36,37] and FeP [38,39], can be used as co-catalyst to effectively enhance the catalytic performance of photocatalysts. Compare to other noble-metal-free co-catalysts mentioned above, nickel phosphide exhibit many attractive advantages, including high activity of hydrogen production, long term stability [40,41], etc. Therefore nickel phosphides are considered as one of the best alternatives of noble metal co-catalysts. Motivated by the transition-metal phosphides co-catalysts research mentioned above, herein we prepared one-dimensional Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalysts via hydrothermal synthesis method. Detailed characterizations on the morphology, crystal structure, chemical states, and optical properties of the composite photocatalysts were carried out. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and stability of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S under visible light irradiation was also characterized. The apparent quantum yield of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S for hydrogen production can reach as high as 18.1% at 420 nm. The possible photocatalytic mechanism for enhanced H2 evolution activity was proposed. Our experimental results demonstrated that Ni2P can act as an effective co-catalyst for Zn0.5Cd0.5S which indicates that it may be also potentially benefiting for other semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 evolution."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(COOCH3)2·2H2O, Aladdin), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(COOCH3)2·2H2O, Aladdin), thioacetamide (A.R), red phosphorus (A.R), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2, A.R), ethyl alcohol (EtOH, A.R.), ethylenediamine (A.R), sodium sulfide (A.R), and sodium thiosulfate (A.R) were used as received without additional purification or treatment. Deionized water was used in all experiments."
3,Synthesis of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the photocatalysts The Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was prepared according to our previous work with a slight modification [16]. A total of 10 mmol equimolar of zinc acetate dihydrate and cadmium acetate dihydrate were added into 60 ml of ethylenediamine with stirring followed by another addition of 20 mmol thioacetamide. After vigorous stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the white solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After that, the product was washed by centrifugation with distilled water and ethanol for several times, respectively. Finally, the pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was obtained via drying the washed solution under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composites were prepared by hydrothermal method. First, 0.4 g of as-prepared Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was dispersed in 60 ml of deionized water under stirring, and then a calculated amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and red phosphorus (the molar ratio of Ni to P is 1:5) were added. The mixture was sonicated for 3 h, then the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After that, the products were washed by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol for three times, respectively. And the final product was obtained by drying the washed solution under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The molar percentages of Ni2P in the prepared composite catalyst were 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4% and 5%, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα as radiation was applied to investigate the crystallographic texture of all samples with 2θ range from 20° to 65°. The morphology of all samples was identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, accelerating voltage 200 kV). The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) of all samples was detected by Shimadzu UV-4100 spectrophotometer, and the reflection from BaSO4 powder was used as a reflectance standard. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5300 ESCA system) was applied to analyze the element valence state of the composite sample, the signal of carbon at 284.8 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the binding energies. The PL spectra of the photocatalysts were detected using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out in a 300 ml quartz reactor (Perfectlight Labsolar IIAG system), which was connected with a low-temperature thermostat bath to keep the reaction temperature at 4 °C during the characterization. The light source (PLS-SXE 300UV Xe arc lamp) was 1 dm over the reactor to illuminate the reactants with light intensity of 11.0 mW/cm2. In a typical photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment, 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of mixed aqueous solution with constant stirring, in which the mixed aqueous solution is composed by 100 ml water and 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. Before each photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment, the reaction system was evacuated for 30 min to create an anaerobic condition. A gas chromatography (Beifen 3420 A, TCD) was selected to analyze the products, and high purity Argon was utilized as carrier gas. The apparent quantum yield (ϕ) for H2 evolution was determined for the photocatalytic system containing 50 mg 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 in 100 ml deionized water. The solution was irradiated by 420 nm (±5 nm) visible light irradiation. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) could be calculated according to Eq. (1). (1) A Q Y ( % ) = t h e n u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s t h e n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100"
6,Density functional theory (DFT) calculation,"2.5 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation All calculations were performed using DFT within the plane-wave pseudopotential as implemented in the VASP code with a cutoff energy of 350 eV. The Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [42] exchange-correlation functional within a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed. The PAW method was used to describe the effect of core electrons [43,44].Gamma-centered k-point meshes of 2 × 2 × 1 were used. The atomic positions were relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.05 eV/Å. Using the periodic slab model and self-consistent dipole correction, the averaging electrostatic potential in the planes perpendicular to the slab normal could be obtained. Bulk Zn0.5Cd0.5S forms a tetragonal lattice with space group P63mc and experimental lattice constants are: a = b = 3.95 Å, c = 6.42 Å. Bulk Ni2P forms a tetragonal lattice with space group P-62 m and experimental lattice constants are: a = b = 5.86 Å, c = 3.38 Å. We built a periodic slab with four and four layers for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (002) and Ni2P (111) facets, respectively. 2 × 2 and 1 × 1 surface unit cells were used, respectively. The bottom two layers of Zn0.5Cd0.5S and Ni2P are fixed, while the top two layers are relaxed during the calculation. The vacuum gap thickness was set to be 12 Å. The heterostructures are modelled by an interface with 20 Å vacuum to avoid interactions between the adjacent slabs."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of Ni2P/Cd0.5Zn0.5S composite samples,"3.1 Characterization of Ni2P/Cd0.5Zn0.5S composite samples The phase purity and crystal structure of the as-prepared samples were determined by XRD analysis. Representative XRD patterns of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S are shown in Fig. 1 , and the data of the standard card of hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S (JCPDS No. 89-2943) is also shown as reference. The main peaks of 2θ at 26.11°, 27.76°, 29.62°, 46.02° and 54.58° can be readily indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (110) and (112) planes of hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S, respectively. It is obvious that the deposition of Ni2P did not affect the crystal structure of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. However, no apparent diffraction peak of Ni2P was observed in all composite samples, which may indicates that the deposition content of Ni2P in all the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples is quite low which exceeds the sensitive of XRD characterization. Nevertheless, the presence of Ni2P in the composites can be easily proved by TEM and XPS techniques as will be discussed later. To gain insight into the microstructure details of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, the morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), it can be seen that pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample has a rod-like morphology with an average diameter of ∼40 nm and length of 100nm∼200nm. The morphology of Zn0.5Cd0.5S after the chemical reduction deposition of Ni2P is shown in Fig. 2(c), reveals that Ni2P was deposited as nanoparticles on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S with high dispersion, and no other obvious changes in the microstructure of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods can be found. Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(d–f) present the HRTEM images of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S and Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples, different orientation and interplanar spacing were observed. The identified lattice fringe spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (002) lattice plane of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. With the deposition of Ni2P, a new interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm can be seen, which can be ascribed to the (111) lattice plane of Ni2P [45]. The TEM and HRTEM characterization results indicate that an intimate contact interface is formed between Ni2P and Zn0.5Cd0.5S components in the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample, which could serve as a critical role for effective improvement of the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons-hole pairs. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared Zn0.5Cd0.5S and Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples were performed to characterize their light-absorbing abilities. As shown in Fig. 3 , the pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample shows absorption from UV to the visible range with an abrupt decline at ∼500 nm, which gives an information to its opticalband gap. The band gap of Zn0.5Cd0.5S is determined to be about 2.4 eV by Tauc's plot as shown in the Fig. 3 insert, which is consistent with the value reported previously [46]. After deposition of Ni2P co-catalyst, all of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S samples have a similar abrupt decline in light absorption at ∼500 nm, but exhibit a remarkable enhanced light absorption in the visible region compared with pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The absorption intensity of the as-prepared samples in the visible range is strengthened with increasing the deposition content of Ni2P, which agrees with the color change of the prepared samples from light yellow to hazel-green. The DRS results demonstrate that the chemical in-situ deposited Ni2P has considerable positive influence on the utilization of visible light, and hence the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample is expected to have superior photocatalytic performance. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to investigate the surface chemical states of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample. It can be seen that the binding energy spectrum of Cd shows two peaks at 405.0 and 411.7 eV (Fig. 4 a), which are corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 respectively, indicating that the valence state of Cd element is +2. As shown in Fig. 4b, the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 were determined to be 1021.9 and 1044.9 eV, which confirmed the presence of Zn2+. This result agrees well with the values reported in our previous work [18,19]. Fig. 4c shows the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p3/2. The peak at 853.3 eV was assigned to Ni2+ of Ni2P, and the other two peaks at 856.2 eV and 861.3 correspond to surface oxidation states [45]. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4d, only one peak at 133.3 eV can be found for the P 2p of Ni2P [47,48]. Based on the XPS characterization results, we can conclude that Ni2P is successfully deposited on the Zn0.5Cd0.5S surface."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were investigated in Na2S and Na2SO3 aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . Control experiment of pure Ni2P sample for H2 evolution evaluation is also carried out; the control experiment result shows that pure Ni2P has no photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. The pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample without Ni2P deposition exhibits a low photocatalytic H2 production activity of 93 μmol h−1. After introducing Ni2P, all of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples exhibit a significantly enhanced activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Fig. 6 presents the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of Ni2P/n0.5Cd0.5S composite samples with different Ni2P deposition contents. After loading 0.5% Ni2P on Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods, the H2 evolution activity is remarkably increased to 461 μmol·h−1. Along with increasing the deposition content of Ni2P, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is further improved. The 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample presents the highest H2 evolution activity with a H2 evolution rate of 1172 umol h−1, which is 13 times higher than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. However, further increasing the deposition content of Ni2P beyond 4% leads to a decrease in photocatalytic H2 evolution rate. The decrease in the photocatalytic activity may be due to the high loading ratio of black Ni2P, which would inhibit the light absorption of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, leading to a reduction in the number of photo generated carriers. Thus, the competition of light absorption between Ni2P and Zn0.5Cd0.5S should be the key parameter for the deterioration in photocatalytic H2 evolution rate. Therefore, a suitable loading amount of Ni2P is important for the optimization of the photocatalytic activity of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples. The stability of a photocatalyst is highly critical for practical applications. To investigate the durability of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity of the 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was investigated via cycling test of photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments. Fig. 7 illustrates the H2 evolution curves in cycling photocatalytic run. The H2 production rate does not display obvious decrease after being irradiated for 16 h (4 cycles), which indicates that the 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst has sufficient stability for photocatalytic H2 production. Moreover, in order to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, its apparent quantum yield was measured at 420 nm (±5 nm). One molecule of H2 is assumed to be generated by the absorption of two photons. The result of apparent quantum yield is shown in Fig. 8 . The average rate of H2 evolution is ∼202 μmol h−1 which sets ϕ to be 18.95%. This high apparent quantum yield for photocatalytic H2 evolution stands for an efficient conversion of visible light energy, suggesting that the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite photocatalyst is highly active for electron-hole pair generation and separation. Thus, it can be seen that Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S is an efficient photocatalyst for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution."
10,Photocatalytic mechanism investigation,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism investigation It is important to clarify the underlying reason for the significant improvement in the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of these Ni2P modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S samples. We then calculated the work function of the materials via preliminary density functional theory (DFT) to reveal the charge injection behaviors at the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S interface. The calculation model of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (002), Ni2P (111) and the heterojunction metal-semiconductor structure of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (002)/Ni2P (111) is shown in Fig. 9 (a, b, c). In this system, the work functions of the metallic Ni2P (111) and Zn0.5Cd0.5S (002) are 4.94 eV and 6.78 eV, respectively. As is well-known, different work function of metal and semiconductor will results in energy band bending when they are bring into intimate contact [49,50]. Therefore, when Zn0.5Cd0.5S and Ni2P form intimate contact, the electrons will transfer from Ni2P to Zn0.5Cd0.5S as the Fermi level of Ni2P is higher than Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and leading to a downward energy band bending at the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S interface. After the electronic equilibrium of the heterojunction system is reached, the unified work function was observed to be 6.02 eV. Based on the calculation of work function and the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst is proposed. As depicted in Fig. 10 (a, b), Zn0.5Cd0.5S absorbs photons and generates electron-hole pairs under visible-light irradiation. However, without the deposition of Ni2P co-catalyst, the photo-generated electrons and holes are likely to recombine rapidly which leads to a low photocatalytic H2 production activity. After depositing Ni2P on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, the photo-induced electron will transfer rapidly from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to Ni2P due to the strong internal potential field formed at the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S interface, and then reduce H+ to H2 via the active sites present at the surface of Ni2P. The photo-induced holes will be accumulated on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S and are consumed by Na2S and Na2SO3 sacrificial regents [18,50]. As a consequence, the Ni2P can act as an electron collector and transporter to prolong the lifetime of the charge carriers, thus improving the photocatalytic activity of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S samples. To verify the proposed mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic performance in the Ni2P composite sample, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S and 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample were obtained to probe the status of radiative recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers. A high recombination rate of excited holes and electrons in the photocatalyst generally results in a low photocatalytic activity [4]. As shown in Fig. 11 (a), it was found that the PL intensity of 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S is lower than the pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The results clearly indicate that the presence of Ni2P is favorable for suppressing the recombination process of electron-holes, leading to high photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Therefore, a noticeable enhancement in the photocatalytic activity is achieved in the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample. The PL results fitted well with the energy band analysis result and photocatalytic activity characterization of the samples. To give a further evidence for the proposed photocatalytic mechanism, the dynamic behavior of photo-generated charge carriers was also investigated with the assistance of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 11(b)). It can be seen that the PL decay lifetime of the photocatalyst increases in the order of Zn0.5Cd0.5S < Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and the lifetime was determined to be 1.63 ns and 2.32 ns, respectively. The time-resolved fluorescence result clearly confirm that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is indeed supressed in the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorod samples."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a highly efficient composite and noble-metal-free photocatalyst Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was prepared via hydrothemal method. The Ni2P NPs are dispersed uniformly on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods and form intimate contact interfaces. A highest H2 amount as high as 1172 μmol h−1 was obtained in 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample, which is 13 times than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. In addition, the 4% Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample also exhibited a good stability in the cycling photocatalytic experiments. Finally, combined with the DFT calculation result of the Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction structure, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed to explain the observed H2 evolution activity enhancement in the Ni2P decorated Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample, which was further confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence characterizations. Therefore, our experimental results demonstrated that Ni2P is a promising co-catalyst for Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which can also be regarded as potential functional co-catalyst to promote the photocatalytic H2 production activity of other semiconductor photocatalysts."
