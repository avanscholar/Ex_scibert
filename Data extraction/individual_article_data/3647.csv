0,Introduction,"Ziegler–Natta catalysts are widely used in propylene polymerization and in the production of high-density and linear low-density polyethylene [1,2]. The discovery that MgCl2 can act as an ideal support for TiCl4 marked a breakthrough in the field of polypropylene polymerization catalysis [3]. The activity of the catalyst was improved dramatically and, because there was no need to remove catalyst residues from the polymer, production costs decreased sharply [4,5]. With use of MgCl2 support the morphology of the polymer particles improved as well. MgCl2 particles give the catalyst particles good morphology and, owing to the replica effect, the same good morphology is transferred to the polymer particles [6]. Before use as a support in catalyst synthesis, MgCl2 must be activated to δ-form [7]. The usual activation method is to precipitate MgCl2 from a solution of an alcohol, typically ethanol [6,8]. MgCl2 is first dissolved in alcohol to form the corresponding adduct and then precipitated from the solution by decomposition of the adduct. In addition to ethanol [9–14], also methanol [13,15,16], propanol [14], 2-ethyl-1-hexanol [15,17], 1-hexanol [18,19], and isopropyl alcohol [15,20] can be used in preparation of the support for Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Activity, molecular weight, and isotacticity index of the produced polymer are influenced by the alcohol used in the support preparation [14]. The structures of some MgCl2/alcohol adducts, such as MgCl2/6C2H5OH and MgCl2/benzyl alcohol, have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction [21,22]. In previous work [23] on the reaction between MgCl2 and 2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol, we found the mononuclear MgCl2/alcohol adduct to contain two 2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol molecules bound to magnesium through the oxygen atoms of the ether and alcohol groups and to form a chelated structure. Our aim in the present work was to study MgCl2 adduct formation of similar alkyloxy ethanols but with shorter alkyl chains. The alkyloxy ethanols examined were 2-(2-methylpropoxy)ethanol (2-isobutoxy ethanol, alkyloxy ethanol A), 2-(1-methylethoxy)ethanol (2-isopropoxy ethanol, alkyloxy ethanol B), 2-ethoxy ethanol (alkyloxy ethanol C), and 2-methoxy ethanol (alkyloxy ethanol D). At the outset of the work, we observed that the alcohol concentration in d-toluene significantly influences the chemical shift of the OH proton owing to the hydrogen bonding present in alkyloxy ethanols and their MgCl2 adducts. A comprehensive 1H NMR study on the variation of the hydrogen bonding with alcohol or adduct concentration was therefore carried out with all four (A–D) alkyloxy ethanols and their MgCl2 adducts. As well, we studied the temperature dependence of hydrogen bonding in the alkyloxy ethanols B and D and their MgCl2 adducts. Crystallization of the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts was examined, and the structures of the crystallized MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol compounds were determined."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The MgCl2 was anhydrous beads (99.9% and 99.99%) delivered by Sigma–Aldrich. MgCl2 was used as received and stored in a glove box. 2-Isobutoxy ethanol was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, and after distillation under inert atmosphere, it was stored in the glove box over molecular sieves. 2-Isopropoxy ethanol, 2-ethoxy ethanol, and 2-methoxy ethanol were from Sigma–Aldrich. 2-Isopropoxy ethanol was used as received and stored in the glove box. 2-Ethoxy ethanol and 2-methoxy ethanol were dried twice with molecular sieves before storage in the glove box. Toluene (p.a) and n-heptane (p.a) were purchased from Riedel-de Haën and were dried with molecular sieves, distilled under nitrogen atmosphere (drying with sodium benzophenone ketyl), and stored in the glove box. d-Toluene used in the NMR measurements was delivered by Euriso-top."
3,Crystallization and adduct formation of MgCl2/alcohol compounds,"2.2 Crystallization and adduct formation of MgCl2/alcohol compounds Structures of the alkyloxy ethanols A–D are presented in Scheme 1 . When MgCl2 was dissolved in alkyloxy ethanol, toluene was used as solvent. Alkyloxy ethanol/MgCl2 molar ratios were the lowest that could be used without precipitation. Ratios were 5:1 with alkyoxy ethanols A and B (2-isobutoxy ethanol and 2-isopropoxy ethanol) and 12:1 and 15:1, respectively, with alkyloxy ethanols C (2-ethoxy ethanol) and D (2-methoxy ethanol). MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol/toluene mixture was warmed to the reaction temperature under nitrogen flow and magnetic stirring. Reaction temperature of 100°C was used with alkyloxy ethanols A and B, and 70°C for alkyloxy ethanols C and D, which were of lower boiling point. After the MgCl2 was totally dissolved in the alkyloxy ethanol, n-heptane was added and the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature. After that, the solution was transferred to the glove box and left to crystallize. Crystallization time varied from a few days to months depending on the alkyloxy ethanol."
4,NMR measurements,"2.3 NMR measurements The NMR spectrometer was a Bruker 400 Ultrashield™. Samples were prepared in the glove box. A series of NMR samples was prepared with 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 200μl of alkyloxy ethanol (A–D) in 0.5ml of d-toluene. 1H spectra were measured at room temperature with 2s delay time. Sixteen scans were taken. Integrations of the proton spectra were confirmed with a longer (10s) pulse delay, and assignments of the signals were verified with two-dimensional NMR measurements (1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C short and long range correlations). Spectra were calibrated with the signal of the solvent (d-toluene, 7.09ppm). The temperature dependence of the OH signal was tested with two alkyloxy ethanols (B and D): temperatures were 20.05/22.65 (varying slightly depending on the room temperature), 30.05, 40.05, 50.05, 60.05, and 70.05°C. Delay time was 10s, and 16 scans were taken. Like those of the alkyloxy ethanols, NMR spectra of the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts were measured in d-toluene. In the case of 2-isobutoxy ethanol and 2-isopropoxy ethanol, alkyloxy ethanol/MgCl2 molar ratios were higher (10:1) than in the crystallization study since hydrocarbon solvent was not used to dissolve MgCl2. Concentration dependence was studied with the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol A–D adducts and temperature dependence with the MgCl2/B and MgCl2/D adducts. Measurement parameters, concentrations, and temperatures used with the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts were the same as those used in NMR measurements of the alkyloxy ethanols."
5,IR spectroscopy,2.4 IR spectroscopy The IR studies were done with a Nicolet Impact 400 D infrared spectroscope mounted inside a glove box. DRIFT method was used to study the complex formation between the alkyloxy ethanol and MgCl2 (liquid samples) and in measurements of the alkyloxy ethanols A–D. Measured wavenumber area was 650–4000cm−1 and 32 scans were taken.
6,Microscopy,"2.5 Microscopy In optical microscopy, samples were protected with oil (Fomblin® Y, Sigma Aldrich). The microscope was Olympus BX51."
7,X-ray structure determinations,"2.6 X-ray structure determinations The crystals of 1–4 were immersed in cryo-oil, mounted in a Nylon loop, and measured at 100K. The X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Kappa Apex II diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The apex2 [24] program package was used for cell refinements and data reductions. Structures were solved by direct methods using the shelxs-97 [25] program with the WinGX [26] graphical user interface. A semi-empirical absorption correction (sadabs [27], twinabs [28]) was applied to all data. Structural refinements were carried out using shelxl-97 [25]. The crystal of 1 was found to be twinned via a 179.9° rotation about the reciprocal axis (001). The two components were determined using the program CELL_NOW (Sheldrick, 2008) [29], integrated using the apex2 [24] program package, and merged and corrected for absorption using twinabs [28] (Sheldrick, 2008). The ratio of the twin components was refined to 0.61/0.39. The moisture sensitive crystal of 4 diffracted only weakly. The crystal was twinned by 180.0° rotation about (−7−86). reciprocal lattice direction. The two components were determined using the rotax program [30], and the ratio of the two twin-components was refined to 0.24/0.76. The H2O and OH hydrogen atoms in 1–4 were located from the difference Fourier map but constrained to ride on their parent atom, with U iso =1.5 U eq (parent atom). Other hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and were also constrained to ride on their parent atoms, with C–H=0.95–1.00Å and U iso =1.2–1.5 U eq (parent atom). The crystallographic details for 1–3 are summarized in Table 1 and selected bond lengths and angles in Tables 2–4 . The crystallographic data for 4 is given only as supplementary material (Tables S3–S4)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Concentration dependence of chemical shifts of OH protons of alkyloxy ethanols,"3.1 Concentration dependence of chemical shifts of OH protons of alkyloxy ethanols 1H NMR chemical shifts (tabulated and presented as Supplementary material) of the OH proton of the alkyloxy ethanols A–D varied with the sample concentration in d-toluene. Fig. 1 a presents the OH chemical shifts as a function of concentration. The higher the sample concentration in d-toluene the more deshielded was the resonance and the further downfield it appeared [31]. In a very dilute sample, isolated alcohol molecules are surrounded only by solvent molecules, but when the sample concentration is raised, the extent of hydrogen bonding between the sample molecules increases [31–34]. Fig. 1a also suggests that the chemical shift of the OH proton depends on the chain length of the alkyl group in alkyloxy ethanol: the longer the alkyl chain the more shielded the resonance and the further upfield it appears. Higher concentration is seen to have a slight deshielding effect on the signals of other protons, such as the protons of neighboring carbons of the ether group."
10,MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts,"3.2 MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts According to our previous study [23], a shift of the OH signal of alcohol about 200cm−1 to lower wavenumber in the IR spectrum of MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adduct indicates that two alcohol molecules are bound to MgCl2. Our present IR studies (spectra shown in Fig. 2 ) clearly showed that adducts are formed between MgCl2 and the alkyloxy ethanols. Since the IR spectra of the adducts show the alcohol signal to have shifted approximately 200cm−1 to lower wavenumber, we conclude that two alkyloxy ethanol molecules are bound to one magnesium in all four adducts. Excess alkyloxy ethanol appears as a shoulder in the IR spectra. Adduct formation was also studied by 1H NMR. Spectra of the alkyloxy ethanols A–D and MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts (100μl in 0.5ml of d-toluene) are presented as Supplementary data. Adduct formation caused the OH proton signal of the alcohol to shift downfield. As well, the signals of the protons bound to the neighboring carbons of the ether and alcohol groups were shifted slightly. Changes are similar to those we earlier reported [23] for MgCl2/2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol adduct, where a chelate adduct was formed through the oxygens of the alcohol and ether groups. Although excess alkyloxy ethanol was observed in the IR spectra, no signal of free alkyloxy ethanol was detected in the NMR spectra. Concentration dependence of the signal of the OH proton of the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts was studied. The 1H chemical shifts of the OH proton of the adducts are tabulated and presented as Supplementary material. Fig. 1b shows that when the sample concentration of the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts in solution increased, the enhanced hydrogen bonding causes the OH signal to shift downfield. However, Fig. 1b also shows that the length of the alkyl chain does not influence the chemical shift of the OH proton: the shifts of all the adducts are approximately the same as a function of concentration."
11,Temperature dependence of chemical shifts of the OH proton of alkyloxy ethanols and their adducts with MgCl2,"3.3 Temperature dependence of chemical shifts of the OH proton of alkyloxy ethanols and their adducts with MgCl2 Temperature dependence of the chemical shift of the OH proton was examined with alkyloxy ethanols B (2-isopropoxy ethanol) and D (2-methoxy ethanol) and their MgCl2 adducts. The chemical shifts are presented in a table in the supplementary material. Fig. 3 presents the chemical shifts of the OH protons of the alkyloxy ethanols B and D and the MgCl2/B and MgCl2/D adducts as a function of temperature. When the temperature was raised, the signal of the OH proton shifted upfield indicating a decrease in the extent of hydrogen bonding between the molecules. Chemical shifts of the OH proton are approximately the same for the two adducts in the studied temperature range indicating similar trends in the hydrogen bonding as a function of temperature."
12,Crystal structures of MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol compounds,"3.4 Crystal structures of MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol compounds Different molar ratios of alkyloxy ethanol/MgCl2 in the presence and absence of solvent were examined to clarify the dissolution of MgCl2. At lower molar ratios, complete MgCl2 dissolution required the presence of toluene as solvent. In previous crystallization studies of MgCl2/2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol [23], alcohol/MgCl2 molar ratio 3.5:1 was found to be sufficient to dissolve MgCl2 totally in the 2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol. With 2-isobutoxy ethanol and 2-isopropoxy ethanol (A and B), dissolution of MgCl2 required a molar ratio of 5:1. Still higher alkyloxy ethanol/MgCl2 molar ratio was needed with the alkyloxy ethanols with shorter alkyl chain (C and D): with 2-ethoxy ethanol 12:1 and with 2-methoxy ethanol 15:1. Crystallization of the MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts with shorter alkyl chain also took longer, and no crystallization was obtained with 2-methoxy ethanol (D) with shortest chain. In the case of 2-ethoxy ethanol (C), crystallization occurred for only a few samples. Crystals of MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol were diamond-shaped hexagons (Fig. 4 a), while those of MgCl2/2-isopropoxy ethanol were irregular in shape (Fig. 4b). MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol crystals were thinner than MgCl2/2-isopropoxy ethanol crystals. The size of the crystals varied from about 10μm to 200μm. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed that the alkyloxy ethanols bind to the magnesium as neutral ligands through the oxygen atoms of the ether and alcohol groups, giving rise to a chelated structure. The crystals of MgCl2/2-isopropoxy ethanol are binuclear in structure (structure 1, Fig. 5 ), with two magnesium atoms connected by chlorine bridges and two alcohol molecules bound to each magnesium atom. MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol crystals from different crystallization batches appeared as two distinct structures. The first (structure 2, Fig. 6 ) is a binuclear structure similar to that of MgCl2/2-isopropoxy ethanol (structure 1), except that there is no inversion center. The second (structure 3, Fig. 6) is a mononuclear structure and contains, in addition to two alkyloxy ethanol molecules, two water molecules, similarly to the structure of the MgCl2/2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)ethanol [23]. Water molecules are also present in MgCl2/2,4-pentadione structures [35]. MgCl2/2-ethoxy ethanol crystals (structure 4) are similar in structure to those of MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol (structure 3) except that the water molecules (and also the 2-ethoxy ethanol molecules) are in trans rather than cis position. This difference is probably due to the shorter alkyl chain of 2-ethoxy ethanol. Since the quality of the single-crystal X-ray data of MgCl2/2-ethoxy ethanol was poor, the structure (structure 4) is presented as supplementary data. As in the liquid state, extensive hydrogen bonding between the molecules of MgCl2/alkyloxy ethanol adducts was also present in the solid state. Fig. 7 shows the hydrogen bonding between the molecules of the MgCl2/2-isopropoxy ethanol adduct (structure 1). Hydrogen bonding in the other adducts is presented as Supplementary data. From the figure we can see that each anionic chlorine forms hydrogen bonds to the OH hydrogen of the alcohol group and weak hydrogen bonds to the hydrogen of the alkyl group. Weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen of the hydroxyl groups and hydrogen of the alkyl group is also present. In the binuclear structure (structure 2) of MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol adduct, anionic chlorine forms hydrogen bonds to hydroxyl groups and alkyl groups. In the mononuclear structures of MgCl2/2-isobutoxy ethanol (structure 3) and MgCl2/2-ethoxy ethanol (structure 4) adducts, hydrogen bonding exists between anionic chlorines and hydroxyl groups and between chlorines and water molecules, and weak hydrogen bonding between anionic chlorines and alkyl groups."
13,Conclusions,"The X-ray diffraction results revealed chelate structures with alkyloxy ethanols bound to magnesium through both oxygens (alcohol and ether groups). In all the MgCl2/alcohol adducts, magnesium is present with coordination number six. Where there are no water molecules in the structure (structures 1 and 2), the adducts show a binuclear structure with the magnesium atoms connected by two chlorine bridges. Two anionic chlorines also exist in the structure. When water is present (structures 3 and 4), adducts are mononuclear, and the water molecules are in trans or cis position depending on the length of alkyl chains of the alkyloxy ethanol. Extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding is present between the alkyloxy ethanols in the free alcohols and in their MgCl2 adducts in both liquid and solid states. The main hydrogen bonding network in the adducts is between the anionic chlorines and the hydrogen of the alcohol OH group. In water-containing adducts, hydrogen bonds also exist between the anionic chlorines and the hydrogen atoms of the water molecules."
