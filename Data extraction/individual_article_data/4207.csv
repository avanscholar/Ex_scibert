0,Introduction,"Continuous increase in the world population causes a rapid rise in energy demand. By the y 2030, the world demand for energy was projected to rise by 53% in comparison with y 2001 (Talebian-Kiakalaieh et al., 2013). Non-renewable fossil fuels will soon be depleted at this rate of consumption (Maceiras et al., 2011). The continued use of fossil fuel reserves like coal, oil, and gas may take another 200, 40, and 70 y, respectively (Shafiee and Topal, 2009). Transportation, manufacturing industries, and power production are the major sectors of fossil fuel consumption (Yin et al., 2020). The burning of these fuels generated environmental issues, such as carbon emissions and global climate change (Fan et al., 2018). The growing world's energy demand and global climate change create the need to explore alternative cleaner sources of energy (Yadav et al., 2014). Solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, and biofuels are possible alternative sources of energy (Sharma et al., 2020). Alternative fuel should be technologically viable, affordable, environmentally sustainable, and readily accessible (Lee et al., 2017). In this search, biofuels are the promising renewable source of energy with less carbon emissions (Mikulčić et al., 2020). Biodiesel is found to be the most suitable alternative to diesel fuel due to its comparable properties and cleaner-burning in compression ignition (CI) engines. It is classified into four generations on the basis of the type of feedstocks. First-generation biodiesel is derived from edible feedstocks like palm, sunflower, soybean, etc. Commercialization of biodiesel produced from these feedstocks is difficult due to the high cost of feedstock and food versus fuel competition (Jamil et al., 2018). If these oils are used to produce biodiesel, it will require more plantations, and due to this, unnecessary clearing of forests will happen (Mansir et al., 2018). These limitations associated with first-generation feedstocks create the need to switch on second-generation feedstocks. These feedstocks are derived from non-edible oils like jatropha, karanja, mahua, etc. These feedstocks can grow on non-important land. Less availability of this type of land forced the farmers to grow second-generation feedstocks on agricultural land. This affects the economy of society and food output directly. The oil yield obtained from non-edible feedstocks is not sufficient enough to meet the current oil demand (Singh et al., 2019). Another negative impact of second-generation feedstocks is the high alcohol requirement for biodiesel production from these feedstocks (Verma and Sharma, 2016). Due to these limitations of second-generation feedstocks, researchers shifted their focus to third-generation feedstocks. Third-generation feedstocks include waste oils and algae oils. The utilization of waste oil generated from various food processing industries is the need of the future (Liu et al., 2021). Most of waste oils are generated from edible oils after frying or cooking operations. The percentage share of different oils in biodiesel production is shown in Fig. 1 (Carus, 2019). Approximately 70–80% of the total cost of biodiesel production is associated with feedstock cost, so the cost of biodiesel production could be reduced to 60–70% if waste cooking oil (WCO) is used as feedstock (Farooq et al., 2013). Expanded production of WCO causes serious waste disposal issues. In most situations, this waste oil discharges into water bodies. It degrades the water quality, and this contaminated water can cause many health issues. The use of WCO as a biodiesel feedstock can mitigate issues such as water contamination and drainage systems blockages, which required additional cleaning. It is found to be a highly efficient way to deal with disposal issues with the partial fulfillment of the world's energy demand (Mittelbach and Remschmidt, 2006). WCO is collected from households, restaurants, and food processing industries. The percentage share of WCO generated from these sources is shown in Fig. 2 (Tawale, 2019). In India, an online food delivery startup (Zomato) started the collection of WCO from restaurants. The government of India set a target of collection of approximately 5 MT of WCO per y for 5% biodiesel blending with diesel fuel by 2030. Zomato is working on this government benchmark to meet the target (Gupta, 2019). The collected WCO is supplied to biodiesel production industries. This collected WCO contains high amount of water and FFA content because, during the frying operation, foodstuff's water mixes with oil at high temperature (Alves et al., 2010). This water in oil causes hydrolysis of triglycerides and from more FFAs. It increases the viscosity and acidity of WCO (Manique, 2011). High amount of water and FFA contents make biodiesel production difficult (Zhang et al., 2003a). To perform further biodiesel production steps, these amounts should be lower down to desired values (Suwannakarn, 2008). Steam sedimentation is the most preferred WCO pre-treatment method (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). After the pre-treatment, the production of biodiesel from WCO is done with transesterification approach in the presence of alcohol and catalyst (Sander et al., 2018). Apart from transesterification; micro-emulsification, dilution (blending), and pyrolysis are some other possible methods of biodiesel production. For industrial-scale biodiesel production transesterification is considered as the best method due to economic and smooth processing (Lian et al., 2012). Biodiesel produced from WCO is biodegradable and non-toxic with no or minimal sulfur content. It can be used in CI engines with minor modifications (Kirubakaran and Selvan, 2018). As the CI engines are not developed solely for the use of biodiesel fuel, the biodiesel analysis is not complete until it is tested in the CI engines (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). Most of the available review articles cover the information regarding production of biodiesel from WCO using different approaches (Table 1 ). Due to limited availability of review article that covers the biodiesel production from WCO to its performance and emissions analysis in CI engines motivates authors to write this article. The present review study collects state-of-art information on WCO to biodiesel production and its efficient use in CI engines. Fatty acids profile and physicochemical properties of WCO and WCO biodiesel are highlighted in this review. This article provides detailed insight on the different biodiesel production methods for WCO feedstock. Transesterification is found to be the most economical method of biodiesel production. Various catalytic and non-catalytic approaches of this method are discussed in detail. The effect of different reaction parameters on the biodiesel yield is also accessed. Detailed performance and emission analysis of CI engines operated on WCO biodiesel are also included in this review."
1,Methods,"Information reported in this review article is collected from various authentic publication sources like Science Direct, Springer, Taylor and Francis, ACS, etc. Patent works information is collected from Google scholar database. To find out the research gaps for the selected study, specific keywords are used like generation of biodiesel, waste oils, cost analysis of waste oils, WCO, consumer energy systems, biodiesel production from WCO, biodiesel standards, methods of biodiesel production, and performance and emission analysis of CI engine operated on WCO biodiesel. According to the record of Scopus, the number of publications regarding the production of WCO biodiesel and its application in CI engines increased from 82 in 2011 to 302 in 2019 (Fig. 3 ). The scrutinizing of articles is done on the basis of relevance to the topic of review. The information from articles of the y 2019 and 2020 also included to enhance the quality of analysis with the current technical scenario of biodiesel as a fuel in CI engines. Old research articles are also added due to their relevant information for some sections of this article. The introduction part of this article includes the novelty and methodology of research with available data. This section also highlights the industrial linkage with theoretical findings for biodiesel production from WCO. Third section contains the categorization of biodiesel generations based on the type of feedstocks, different countries' biodiesel standards, and benefits and limitations associated with the use of biodiesel. The reasons for considering WCO for biodiesel production are entirely described in section four. This section covers the physicochemical properties and economic considerations of WCO biodiesel. The most adaptive approach for biodiesel production from WCO is transesterification.

The study will not be complete if the testing of WCO biodiesel is not done on CI engines. Section six includes the detailed performance and emission analysis of CI engines operated on WCO biodiesel. This article will help researchers to analyze and compare the different production approaches for WCO biodiesel and its optimum use in CI engines."
2,Biodiesel,"Biodiesel is the monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids produced from different edible, non-edible, and waste oil feedstocks (Singh et al., 2020). Comparable physicochemical properties of biodiesel with conventional diesel fuel make it suitable fuel for use in CI engines. It is an attractive green fuel for the energy sector because of its special characteristics like no sulfur content, high cetane number, high flash point, non-toxic, sustainable, and renewable nature (Marwaha et al., 2018). Lack of sulfur content in the fuel increases the life of engine (Aghbashlo et al., 2016). A higher flash point provides safe storage ability to biodiesel in comparison with conventional diesel fuel (Farooq et al., 2013). Biodiesel is more environment-friendly than diesel fuel due to lower harmful emissions. Pollutants from engine exhaust adversely affect human health. The primary health problems due to exhaust emissions (CO, HC, PM, NOx, and CO2) are headache, fatigue, respiratory problems, wheezing, cough, cancer, chest pain, reduced reflexes, etc. Supplementary Table S1 briefly describes the ill effects of various pollutants on humans, plants, animals, and the ecosystem."
3,Generations of biodiesel,"3.1 Generations of biodiesel European academies science advisory council (EASAC) classified biodiesels on the basis of type of feedstocks. Biodiesel is classified into four generations. Edible oil, non-edible, and waste-derived feedstocks belong to first, second and third generations, respectively. Fourth-generation biodiesel feedstocks utilize synthetic biological technology and are termed as solar biodiesels (Singh et al., 2020). This technique enhances the quality of biodiesel with an increase in the photon to fuel conversion efficiency (PFCE). Research on fourth-generation feedstocks is on the initial level (Singh et al., 2019). The cost of feedstock production of fourth-generation biodiesel is very high, so third-generation biodiesel feedstocks are considered the most promising sources of biodiesel production. Different third-generation biodiesel feedstocks with their primary sources, oil yield, and significant producer countries are listed in Table 2 ."
4,Biodiesel standards in different countries,"3.2 Biodiesel standards in different countries Various countries like the USA, EU, India, Brazil, Japan, South Africa, China, etc., have prepared their standards for biodiesel fuel (Atadashi et al., 2010). Biodiesel standards developed by the European Union (EN 14214) and the USA (ASTM D 6751) are the internationally accepted standards to maintain the quality of biodiesel (Mat Yasin et al., 2017). Pure biodiesel is termed as B100, while mixing of biodiesel with diesel fuel is termed as biodiesel blend (BX), where X is always less than 100. ASTM D 6751 standards are for pure biodiesel (B100), not for biodiesel blends. Supplementary Table S2 specifies the biodiesel standards and test methods set by different countries in detail."
5,Merits and demerits of biodiesel,"3.3 Merits and demerits of biodiesel Biodiesel is considered as the green substitute for traditional diesel fuel due to its renewable and sustainable nature and comparable properties (Kegl et al., 2013). A wide range of fuels can be used in CI engines without any significant modifications (Ali et al., 2014). There are some more merits and demerits associated with the use of biodiesel in CI engines are given in Supplementary Table S3."
6,Waste cooking oil as a fuel,"To maintain economic viability in biodiesel production, manufacturers concentrate their efforts on the usage of cheap feedstock, such as waste oils (Singh et al., 2020). Waste oils are produced massively in every country and can contribute to contamination of water resources if no proper system of their disposal is implemented (Gui et al., 2008). Waste oils may be derived from food sectors, non-food sectors, restaurants, and households. Waste tyre oil, waste plastic oils, etc., are non-food sector feedstocks that can also be used for biodiesel production. Pyrolysis process is generally employed for biodiesel production from these feedstocks. Waste from different edible oils is termed as WCO, and it can be used for the production of biodiesel. In the y 2019–20, the global consumption of edible oils is found to be 191.71 MMT (Shahbandeh, 2020). The primary sources of edible oil are palm, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, peanut, cottonseed, coconut, olive oil, etc. The share of these oils in global edible oil consumption data is shown in Fig. 4 . Due to lack of reporting, the accurate estimation of WCO production from edible oils is difficult (Loizides et al., 2019). Jiang and Zhang reported the WCO generation data with Eq. (1) (Jiang and Zhang, 2016). (1) W C O g e n e r a t i o n = [ P o p u l a t i o n × P e r c a p i t a e d i b l e o i l c o n s u m p r t i o n ] × 30 100 From the above equation the global WCO production is found approximately 57.51 MMT in the y 2019–20. Issue of high cost of feedstock is resolved with the use of WCO for biodiesel production. WCO has higher amount of water than fresh oils due to the mass and heat transfer between food and oil during frying and cooking operations (Chhetri et al., 2008). Hydrolysis of triglycerides is accelerated with this high-water content. It causes an increase in the amount of FFA in the oil (Marmesat et al., 2007). Finally, this high amount of water with high FFA leads to more saponification during the biodiesel production process. Saponification decreases the output yield of biodiesel and increases the catalyst amount requirement, so the pre-treatment of oil is essential. After the pre-treatment, an effective transesterification process can be followed to produce biodiesel at a feasible cost (Buffi et al., 2017)."
7,Sources of waste cooking oil,"4.1 Sources of waste cooking oil Food processing industries and fast food companies use a large quantity of edible oils for frying purposes (Jamil et al., 2018). Frying is the operation in which food is immersed in oil at 150–200 °C temperature in the presence of moisture, antioxidants, and prooxidants contents (Safari et al., 2018). There are various reactions associated with the frying process like hydrolysis, oxidation, polymerization, decomposition, and isomerization of oil (Cao et al., 2017). After the frying operation, these oils are considered as waste and can be used for biodiesel production (Koh and Surh, 2015). Different edible oils like palm, canola, corn, rapeseed, mustard, cottonseed, etc., are used for biodiesel production after their use for frying or cooking operations. Countries like the USA, China, EU, Malaysia, and Japan are the most significant WCO producers."
8,Physicochemical properties of waste cooking oil biodiesel,"4.2 Physicochemical properties of waste cooking oil biodiesel When vegetable oil is used for frying operation then it undergoes various chemical and physical changes. Volatility of oil decreases, and molecular weight increases due to the formation of oligomeric substances during frying. WCO contains mainly oleic acid (45.15%) and linoleic acid (39.74%). Variation in the FFA profile leads to change in the physicochemical properties of biodiesel (Lam et al., 2010). Quantity of the number of double bonds or unsaturated bonds and the length of the carbon chain decides the fatty acid profile (Ma and Hanna, 1999). In these chains, carbon atom tends to attach with maximum possible numbers of hydrogen atoms. Fatty acids which don't have double bonds are known as saturated fatty acids like stearic acid. Linoleic acid is termed as unsaturated fatty acid due to the presence of double bonds. In the unsaturated fatty acids chain, the carbon atom doesn't attach a maximum number of hydrogen atoms due to the presence of double bonds. Change in the physicochemical properties affects the biodiesel performance in CI engines (Moecke et al., 2016). Different fatty acids present in WCO with their chemical structure, molecular weight, and average amount are given in Table 3 . Biodiesel obtained from WCO through transesterification has high viscosity, inferior combustion characteristics, and high conradson carbon residue (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). Table 4 briefly describes the physicochemical properties of WCO biodiesel and diesel fuel. Various vital characteristics of WCO biodiesel are as follows: 4.2.1 Cetane number Cetane number (CN) of fuel defines its ignition quality. High CN of fuel reduces the ignition delay period. The most adoptive range of CN is in between 40 and 60 (Ramadhas et al., 2004). CN of WCO biodiesel is obtained in between 47.7 and 59.8. This variation occurs because biodiesel is derived from WCO, which originated from different edible oils like palm, canola, rapeseed, etc. 4.2.2 Density Density of biodiesel is an important parameter and can be calculated with various standards testing methods like ASTM D 1298 (Atadashi et al., 2010), EN ISO 12185/3675 (Fonseca et al., 2019), ISO 3675/P32, JIS K 2249 (Barabás & Todoruţ, 2011), and GB/T 13377 (Jenvanitpanjakul, 2007). The maximum permissible value of biodiesel density is given 900 kg/m3 at 15 °C. Density of WCO biodiesel is obtained 887 kg/m3 at 15 °C. 4.2.3 Kinematic viscosity The maximum limiting value of kinematic viscosity is given 6.0 mm2/s as per ASTM standards. Kinematic viscosity of WCO is high. High viscosity results in poor atomization of fuel that finally deteriorates the engine performance (Lam et al., 2010). Transesterification method is used to reduce this value (Moazeni et al., 2019). 4.2.4 Calorific value Lower calorific value (LCV) of biodiesel fuels usually smaller than diesel fuel except for some algae-based biodiesel like spirulina platensis. LCV for WCO biodiesel is varied between 39.26 MJ/kg and 40.57 MJ/kg. The highest value is reported for WCO biodiesel generated from sunflower oil (Altın et al., 2001). The higher LCV resulted in low brake specific fuel consumption and high brake thermal efficiency. 4.2.5 Temperature Flash point, cloud point, and pour point are the important temperatures of the fuel to be used in CI engines. To operate the engine in cold climatic conditions, both cloud and pour points of WCO biodiesel should be low (Yaakob et al., 2013). In terms of fuel storage point of view, flash point of WCO biodiesel should be as high as possible. All these temperatures vary with the variation of WCO biodiesel blend percentage in diesel fuel (Lam et al., 2010). These values of temperature for WCO biodiesel are mentioned in Table 4. The maximum value of the cloud and pour point is given 10 °C and 7 °C, respectively, while the minimum value of the flash point is obtained 150 °C. 4.2.6 Saponification value Saponification value (SV) increases with increase in FFA and water content. High amount of FFA and water in the oil lead to more soap formation (Moazeni et al., 2019). This value for WCO increases during the frying operation of edible oils. For WCO biodiesel SV is reported 207 mg KOH/g (Table 4). 4.2.7 Acid number Acid number (AN) of biodiesel is the measure of FFA content in the fuel. AN of WCO is observed higher due to frying operation. This number can be measured by different methods like ASTM D 664 (Atadashi et al., 2010), EN 14104 (Fonseca et al., 2019), JIS K 2501/0070 (Barabás & Todoruţ, 2011), and GB/T 264 (Jenvanitpanjakul, 2007). The maximum permissible value of AN for biodiesel is given 0.50 mg KOH/g by most of the standards; expect GB/T 20828 standards (0.80 mg KOH/g)."
9,Comparison of waste cooking oil with other feedstocks,"4.3 Comparison of waste cooking oil with other feedstocks Most of the waste oils are derived from first-generation feedstocks. Some of the waste oils like waste tyre oil and waste plastic oil are derived from non-edible sources. Physicochemical properties of WCO are different from parent vegetable oils due to the frying process (Cvengroš and Cvengrosova, 2004). The change in physicochemical properties occurs due to hydrolysis and oxidation reaction in the frying process (Costa et al., 2000). These reactions increase FFA and moisture content in the WCO in comparison with raw oil and finally lead to soap formation in the biodiesel production process (Chuah et al., 2016). If water content in WCO biodiesel is high, then it may cause corrosion of engine parts. High FFA content in WCO is also responsible for engine wear. Due to these reasons, pre-treatment of WCO is necessary before the transesterification reaction (Cvengros and Cvengrosova, 2004). In pre-treatment process, moisture content is reduced below 0.3% and the acid number (AN) less than 1 mg KOH/g (Freedman et al., 1984). Cost of waste oils is far less than first-generation feedstocks that make them more suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. WCO is also more economical feedstock than second and some of third generation feedstocks like jatropha, karanja, mahua, algae, etc."
10,Waste cooking oil biodiesel economic consideration,"4.4 Waste cooking oil biodiesel economic consideration Continuous rise in the price of crude petroleum oil in the global market is the key factor behind the feasibility of commercial-scale biodiesel production (Agarwal, 2007). As discussed earlier, the cost of biodiesel from first and second generation feedstocks is higher than WCO. It can be collected directly from fast food stores, food industries, and non-food industries. The collection of waste oil through an optimum route will reduce the cost of biodiesel (da Silva Guabiroba, 2009). This collected WCO cannot be used directly for biodiesel production due to high FFA and water contents (da Silva César et al., 2017). To lower down these contents, pre-treatment is essential. Pre-treatment process increases the overall cost of biodiesel derived from WCO, so focus on technology development is required to reduce the cost (Demirbas and Balat, 2006). Most of the countries across the globe are now promoting WCO biodiesel as a sustainable and renewable substitute of diesel fuel. The policy formation regarding the collection and recycling of waste oil will surely increase the economic feasibility of waste-driven biodiesels."
11,Consumer energy systems and their practical applications,"4.5 Consumer energy systems and their practical applications In the energy sector, apart from new technology development, it is necessary to focus on consumer behavior. The investment in communication strategies is required to encourage consumers to engage with new technology (Rizzi et al., 2020). The energy requirement is fulfilled by the multi-carrier energy (MCE) such as thermal energy, electricity, and natural gas. The energy hub systems (EHSs) frameworks have been introduced to meet the demand. This framework provides environmental and economic benefits to the system operator by producing energy with minimum emissions (Chamandoust et al., 2019). The development programs for electricity generation from WCO are underway. For sustainable development, reduction in global environmental inequality is essential. The unequal distribution of carbon emissions across the countries creates the need to find the optimal allocation of quotas of environmental burdens (Pozo et al., 2020). Share of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic and wind power increases in energy mix continuously. Supply from these sources is uncertain, so electrical energy storage systems are used for power balance (Chamandoust et al., 2020a). Smart grid system is the modern approach that uses real-time supply information to provide an adequate energy supply. Demand response programs are used in smart grids to change the energy consumption on the basis of market price signals and incentives (Chamandoust et al., 2020c). In order to produce economic and cleaner electricity, renewable generators are a promising solution. Demand-side management strategy helps the consumers to reduce energy consumption and improve the environmental condition (Chamandoust et al., 2020b). Life cycle assessment is a decision-making tool for the measurement of environmental impacts to get the most favorable choice in getting a sustainable social and economic future (Kalverkamp et al., 2020). From various life cycle assessment studies, it is observed that the collection and delivery of WCO have impact to environment. To reduce energy consumption, an efficient energy management strategy is required for the vehicle with fixed mechanical design. Energy management in hybrid energy vehicles can be done with different speed prediction models (Li et al., 2020). Dust removal ash is the new approach for the production of combustible gas with high efficiency, energy savings, cleaner and eco-friendly nature (Song et al., 2020). Emissions from motor vehicle engines are responsible for deteriorating air quality and global climate change. For sustainable development, the reduction of carbon emissions is a challenging task in the countries like China (Wang and Hu, 2020). The government initiatives in the direction of an effective collection of WCO and industrial-scale biodiesel production will reduce the fossil fuel dependency with effective waste utilization. Various initiatives have been taken by governments in order to mitigate these issues. Collection and transportation of waste are directly associated with energy consumption and responsible for greenhouse gas emissions (Bong et al., 2017). Modification of transport infrastructure is one such alternate solution in this respect (Yang et al., 2020)."
12,Production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil,"Biodiesel production is the process of reduction in carbon chain length of fatty acids of oil to convert it into FAMEs (da Silva César et al., 2017). Biodiesel production from WCO consists of a number of steps like WCO collection, pre-treatment of WCO, viscosity reduction (biodiesel production), and post-production processing (Hajjari et al., 2017). Different methods are available to produce biodiesel, like transesterification, thermal cracking (pyrolysis), micro-emulsification, and dilution or blending (Verma and Sharma, 2016). The complete process of biodiesel production from WCO is shown in Fig. 5 ."
13,Collection of waste cooking oil,"5.1 Collection of waste cooking oil Waste oil generated in food processing industries directly transferred to biodiesel production units. In some cases, the same sector utilizes its waste oil to produce biodiesel and uses biodiesel to run its plant machinery. Waste oils produced from fast food stores or restaurants are collected by local collecting agents (Hajjari et al., 2017). Local collecting agents or plants supply the waste oil to the biodiesel processing industries with pre-treatment or without pre-treatment (da Silva César et al., 2017). In the biodiesel processing industries, the initial step is taken to check the quality of WCO. After the quality check, the recommended oil is processed further for biodiesel production."
14,Pre-treatment of waste cooking oil,"5.2 Pre-treatment of waste cooking oil Use of cooking oil over and over for frying operation increases the viscosity, acidity, specific heat, and unpleasant smell (Costa Neto and De Freitas, 1996). These factors make the pre-treatment of WCO necessary to increase its economic viability (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). Foodstuff's water mixes with oil during the frying process at high temperature. This water in oil caused hydrolysis of triglycerides and forms more FFAs (Manique, 2011). This causes increase in viscosity and acidity of waste oil (Alves et al., 2010). High amount of water and FFA contents make biodiesel production difficult (Zhang et al., 2003a). To perform further biodiesel production steps, these amounts should be lower down to desired values (Suwannakarn, 2008). Several pre-treatment methods can be used for WCO like steam and sedimentation, injection of steam, neutralization, vacuum filtration, ion exchange resin method, film vacuum evaporation, and glycerin with catalyst reaction (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). These processes reduce the viscosity, water, and FFA contents of oil. Pre-treatment of WCO also removes the solid impurities that are added during cooking and handling operation (Yaakob et al., 2013). High amount of water content can remove by heating at 100 °C (Li et al., 2014). Acid ion exchange resins can be used to reduce the FFA content in WCO. Some of these resins are Dowex HCR-W2, A-15, A-16, and A-35. When A-15 ion exchange resin is used as a catalyst in esterification reaction then low biodiesel yield (45.70%) is obtained (Ozbay et al., 2008). Glycerin can also be used with zinc chloride catalyst at 200 °C to reduce the FFA content. Conversion of FFA to monoglycerides and diglycerides takes place with this method (Van Gerpen et al., 2004). Some studies reported that pre-treatment of WCO could also be done with the esterification method (Leung et al., 2010). This pretreated oil can process further for biodiesel production by transesterification reaction."
15,Biodiesel production methods,"5.3 Biodiesel production methods After the pre-treatment, biodiesel production from WCO is done in the same manner as biodiesel from vegetable oils. There are many factors like high viscosity, FFA content, water content, density, etc. force to avoid WCO direct use in CI engines. High viscosity may cause gum formation in the injection system and combustion chamber. High water content increases engine wear due to corrosion. High acidity of fuel also reduces the life of the engine (de Araújo et al., 2013). Due to these reasons, it is necessary to lower down all these values to the permissible limit. There are several approaches used to reduce these values and produce biodiesel from waste oils. All these approaches are as follows: • Transesterification • Dilution (blending) • Micro-emulsification • Thermal cracking (pyrolysis) 5.3.1 Transesterification It is the process in which fats or vegetable oils are converted to FAME and glycerol at a predefined temperature in the presence of a definite amount of alcohol and catalyst. It is also called the alcoholysis process (Enweremadu and Mbarawa, 2009). One mole of triglycerides reacts with 3 mol of alcohol to produce 3 mol of esters and 1 mol of glycerol (Zou et al., 2013). Transesterification reaction for fats or vegetable/waste oils to produce biodiesel is shown in Fig. 6 . High alcohol amount is preferred to get more biodiesel yield (Agarwal et al., 2007). The selection of catalysts is critical because if a suitable catalyst with a defined amount is not used then, the reaction leads to more soap formation. There are different types of catalysts, which can be used in this reaction; like acid, base, enzyme, and nano-catalyst. Acid and base (alkali) catalysts may be homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts. Alkali catalysts are more favorable due to high product yield. Methanol is preferred over other alcohols for transesterification reaction due to less cost (Enweremadu and Mbarawa, 2009). Different benefits and limitations associated with various types of transesterification reactions are explained in Table 5 . The schematic diagram of the production of biodiesel from WCO using transesterification method is shown in Fig. 7 . The different types of transesterification reactions are as follows: 5.3.1.1 Catalyzed transesterification • Homogenous acid catalyst • Heterogeneous acid catalyst • Homogenous base catalyst • Heterogeneous base catalyst • Acid and base catalyst • Enzyme catalyst • Nano-catalyst 5.3.1.2 Non-catalyzed transesterification • Supercritical methanol 5.3.1.3 Transesterification with acid catalyst When FFA content in WCO is higher than 1% then acid catalysts are preferred over base catalysts (Lam et al., 2010). Homogenous and heterogeneous are two basic categories of acid catalysts. Acid-catalyzed transesterification reaction starts with the mixing of the acid catalyst with alcohol. After that, acidified alcohol is mixed with oil, and transesterification reaction occurred in a single step. The alcohol in reaction acts as both esterification reagent and solvent (Cervero' et al., 2008). A range of alcohols like 2-ethoxyethanol, 1-butanol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, ethanol, and methanol are used for producing biodiesel. Among all these alcohols, methanol is considered as the best option due to its low cost and easy availability. After transesterification reaction, two layers of biodiesel and glycerin are appeared after settling for some time (Wang et al., 2006). Glycerin is set in the bottom part and can easily separate from biodiesel. Various homogenous acid catalysts like hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and organic sulfonated acids are used to produce biodiesel from WCO. Table 6 describes the various reaction parameters associated with homogenous and heterogeneous acid-catalyzed transesterification reaction. It is observed that the biodiesel yield with an acid catalyst obtained more than alkali catalysts, but the time of reaction is more for acid catalysts (Nye et al., 1983). Freedman et al. conducted a transesterification reaction using homogenous H2SO4 with methanol (30:1) at 65 °C for 4140 min, and the biodiesel yield is obtained 99% (Freedman et al., 1984). The alcohol requirement is also high with the use of acid catalyst (Lam et al., 2010). High biodiesel yield (99%) is obtained in this study when high amount of homogenous H2SO4 catalyst (41.80% by weight) and high molar methanol to oil ratio (245:1) is used. From various studies, it is found that the increase in alcohol amount the reaction time reduces for homogenous acid-catalyzed transesterification reaction with moderate temperature conditions. H2SO4 is the most widely used homogenous acid catalyst due to its low cost, high reactivity, and high biodiesel yield. For high FFA content waste oils, heterogeneous acid catalysts are preferred over homogenous acid catalysts. In the case of heterogeneous acid catalysts, ZrHPW is found the best suitable catalyst for transesterification of the WCO. Biodiesel yield is obtained highest (98.90%) at moderate reaction parameters with the use of this catalyst. Reactivity of ZrHPW heterogeneous acid catalyst is higher than traditional homogenous H2SO4 under controlled reaction conditions. Separation of biodiesel from glycerin is easy with this catalyst. It can be reused more than one time. Activity of this heterogeneous catalyst is independent of water and FFA content in WCO. All these factors make it the most adoptive acid catalyst for the transesterification of WCO (Zhang et al., 2009). Some more heterogeneous acid catalysts like MoO3/ZrO2, MoO3/SiO2, zinc stearate supported on silica, and WO3/SiO2–Al2O3 are also used for biodiesel production from WCO (Table 5). 5.3.1.4 Transesterification with base catalyst Use of base catalyst in the transesterification reaction is limited due to high FFA and water content in WCO. Base catalysts for transesterification reaction are classified into homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts. Various homogenous catalysts like KOH, NaOH, and CH3ONa are commonly used for biodiesel production from WCO (Math and Irfan, 2007). High water and FFA content in WCO lead to more soap formation during the transesterification reaction. Various parameters associated with transesterification reaction using homogeneous KOH, NaOH, and CH3ONa catalysts are listed in Table 6. The highest biodiesel yield (98.20%) from WCO is obtained with the use of homogenous KOH catalyst. The study reported the use of a homogenous KOH catalyst of amount 1% (w/w) and molar alcohol to oil ratio of 6:1. The complete conversion of triglycerides to FAMEs takes place at 70 °C temperature in 60 min (Agarwal et al., 2012). In another study, when KOH amount, methanol amount, reaction time, and reaction temperature increase, then lower yield (87%) of biodiesel is obtained (Demirbas, 2009). Pedro Felizardo et al. reported high biodiesel yield (98%) with 0.6% (w/w) of NaOH catalyst and low alcohol amount (4.8:1) in 40 min at 65 °C temperature (Felizardo et al., 2006). From these studies, it is observed that the increase in catalyst amount, reaction temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio above optimum value causes reduction in biodiesel yield. Heterogeneous base catalysts require high alcohol amount, and the rate of reaction also slower than homogenous catalysts. High biodiesel yield (97.30%) is obtained when a heterogeneous K3PO4 catalyst of amount 4.0% (w/w) is used with 6:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio (Guan et al., 2009). Base catalyzed transesterification reaction is costlier than acid-catalyzed transesterification due to the need of the separation process and treatment of alkaline wastewater. These post-reaction purification steps would be eliminated with the usage of the heterogeneous alkaline catalyst, but it did not contribute to a reliable conversion comparison with a homogeneous catalyst (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). Regeneration of heterogeneous catalysts reduces the overall cost of biodiesel production. Heterogeneous catalysts can be used more than one time with a slight reduction in catalytic performance. During the consecutive runs, most of the catalyst deactivated. The presence of air and impurities in feedstocks are the main reasons behind the deactivation of active sites of catalysts (de Lima et al., 2016). No significant reduction in the biodiesel yield is observed when a regenerated catalyst is used for transesterification reaction (Galadima and Muraza, 2020). Presence of more number of active reaction sites makes the heterogeneous base catalysts preferred over heterogeneous acid catalysts (Khodadadi et al., 2020). Regeneration of catalysts associated with some cost due to high temperature thermal treatment. But the overall cost of biodiesel production using heterogeneous catalysts is lower than homogeneous catalysts. 5.3.1.5 Two-step transesterification In two-step transesterification approach, both acid and base catalysts are used in a definite proportion (Wan Omar et al., 2009). In the initial step, an acid catalyst is used to reduce the high FFA content of WCO. This process is termed as an esterification process. In this process, FFA content of WCO is reduced to less than 1%. Now this less FFA content WCO can be transesterified with base catalyst. Biodiesel yield obtained by this method is higher for a moderate range of operating parameters than single-step transesterification methods discussed earlier. Patil et al. reported the use of ferric sulfate and KOH catalysts for the production of biodiesel from WCO. Ferric sulfate of 2% (w/w) amount with 9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio is used to reduce the FFA content. The reaction takes place for 120 min and at temperature of 100 °C. KOH with 0.5% (w/w) is used for the transesterification of WCO. Yield of biodiesel obtained in this method is 96% (Patil et al., 2010). The same catalysts are used in another study with different reaction parameters, and 97% biodiesel yield is obtained at lower reaction temperature and higher base catalyst amount (Wang et al., 2006). When ferric sulfate catalyst is used with CaO catalyst, then less biodiesel yield (81.30%) is obtained in more time. Reaction temperature used in this study is lower than the above cases (Wan Omar et al., 2009). From these studies, it is observed that the biodiesel yield with moderate reaction parameters is obtained higher in comparison with a single catalyst. There are some limitations are also associated with this method, like difficult recovery of catalyst. The presence of catalysts in FAME may cause engine wear. Acid catalysts may wear out the engine parts, and base catalysts increase the production of incombustible ash, so it is necessary to remove the catalysts after the completion of the reaction (Romano, 1982). This issue can resolve with the use of more quantity of base catalyst for the neutralization of acid catalyst. This step increases the overall cost of biodiesel production from WCO. From an economic perspective, this approach is considered as the best suitable for commercial-scale biodiesel production with high biodiesel yield. 5.3.1.6 Transesterification using enzyme catalysts Production of biodiesel from WCO using enzyme catalysts is independent of water and FFA contents (Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006). Various enzymes like Novozym 435, Rhizopus oryzae, PS 30, Bacillus subtilis, etc., are used to produce biodiesel from WCO (Table 5). When Novozym 435 is used as a catalyst with an amount 4% (w/w), the yield of WCO biodiesel is obtained 90.90% (Watanabe et al., 2001). In this reaction, 3:1 methanol to oil molar ratio is used at low-temperature (30 °C) for 3000 min. In this case, the stepwise addition of methanol is done to reduce the catalyst inactivity. The same catalyst is used by Halim and Harun Kamaruddin, and they found the reduction in biodiesel yield with an increase in catalyst amount (12% by weight) and decrease in reaction time to 720 min (Halim and Harun Kamaruddin, 2008). This reduction in biodiesel yield is observed due to reverse reaction. During the reverse reaction, with increase in reaction time, more saponification of WCO occurs. The highest biodiesel yield (96%) is obtained with 13.70% (w/w) of the PS 30 catalyst. The reaction time (148.2 min) was reported lower in this case (Wu et al., 1999). PS 30 is considered the most efficient enzyme catalyst with moderate reaction parameters. Production of biodiesel using enzyme catalyst is an attractive option due to various advantages like medium reaction temperature (35–45 °C), easy product removal, and recycling of catalyst (Wu et al., 1999). Some of immobilized enzyme catalysts like B. Cepacia and P. cepacia are effective catalysts for transesterification of high water and FFA content WCO. Various advantages and disadvantages associated with lipase catalysts are listed in Table 5. 5.3.1.7 Transesterification using nano-catalysts Nano-catalysts have received a unique emphasis on the production of biodiesel due to high catalytic efficiency (Ambat et al., 2018). Surface area of nano-catalyst media is large, which amplifies their activity in comparison with traditional catalysts (Hashmi et al., 2016). As the nano-catalyst surface area is high, different bottleneck issues related to the transesterification reaction using conventional catalysts are eliminated (Baskar and Aiswarya, 2016). High activity, stability, reusability, effective surface/volume ratio, and a strong saponification resistance are the main features of nano-catalysts (Hu et al., 2011). The process of utilization of catalysts with nano-dimensions takes place in support with solids (carbon, zeolites, and oxides) or without any support (Akia et al., 2014). Nano-catalysts can be produced using different methods for biodiesel synthesis. The most popular techniques used are vacuum deposition and evaporation, gas condensation, precipitation, impregnation, chemical vapor, sol-gel processing, mechanical attritions, and electrochemical deposition (Rajput, 2015). Various reaction parameters associated with the use of nano-catalysts in transesterification of WCO are listed in Table 6. Baskar and Aiswarya reported biodiesel production from WCO using CZO nano-catalyst. In this process, biodiesel yield is produced 97.71% with 12% (w/w) of nano-catalyst CZO and 8:1 methanol to oil ratio at 55 °C. The reaction takes place for only 50 min (Baskar and Aiswarya, 2015). When nano-catalyst CaO (1.5% by weight) is used with 7:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, then 94.37% biodiesel yield is obtained in 360 min (Tahvildari et al., 2015). When transesterification of WCO is done with mesoporous TiO2/PrSO3H nano-catalyst then 98.3% biodiesel yield is obtained with 15:1 methanol to oil ratio at 60 °C (Gardy et al., 2017). Gardy et al. experimentally transesterified the WCO using Ti(SO4)O nano-catalyst. The product yield is obtained 97.10% with 1.5% (w/w) catalyst amount (Gardy et al., 2016). CaO–MgO is considered the most efficient nano-catalyst with high biodiesel yield (98.95%) with moderate reaction parameters (Tahvildari et al., 2015). It is observed that reduction in reaction time decreases the biodiesel yield due to incomplete conversion of FFA to FAMEs (Table 6). High cost of catalyst and excess alcohol requirement during transesterification are some limitations associated with nano-catalysts. 5.3.1.8 Supercritical methanol transesterification In this method, high temperature and pressurized methanol is used for biodiesel production. The role of methanol in this approach is as a catalyst and also as a solvent (Warabi et al., 2004). Due to the presence of high water and FFA content in WCO, the use of this technology is preferable in comparison with traditional methods. A study reported 91.50% biodiesel yield with the use of this supercritical methanol approach (Aboelazayem et al., 2018). In this study, amount of methanol required is high with methanol to oil molar ratio of 37:1. Temperature and pressure of reaction also reported high (253.5 °C and 198.5 bar). The time of biodiesel production is observed very low (14.8 min) in this study. In comparison with the traditional approach, the high conversion efficiency is observed with supercritical methanol method for both neat and waste oils. This method is less economical in comparison with the traditional methods due to high energy requirement during the transesterification reaction. Various advantages and disadvantages associated with the supercritical methanol method are listed in Table 5. From the above literature analysis, it is observed that WCO contains high FFA and water content. Due to this reason, the use of base catalyst for transesterification of WCO is limited. Use of acid catalysts is also less favorable due to longer duration of reaction. From the economic point of view, this method is less suitable due to high thermal energy consumption for longer duration. High energy requirement in supercritical methanol method makes it less favorable method for commercial-scale biodiesel production. Cost and availability of enzyme and nano-catalysts are the main drawbacks associated with these catalysts. Overall, it could be concluded that for industrial-scale production of biodiesel from WCO, two-step transesterification method is considered the most effective approach. 5.3.1.9 Various factors affecting the yield of waste cooking oil biodiesel in transesterification reaction Transesterification reaction is affected by various factors like reaction pressure and temperature, time of reaction, alcohol type and amount, FFA and water content of oil, and catalyst type and amount (Yaakob et al., 2013). The physicochemical properties of WCO primarily affect the reaction parameters (Enweremadu and Mbarawa, 2009). Different factors affecting yield of WCO biodiesel are discussed below: 5.3.1.9.1 Reaction pressure and temperature Transesterification reaction is strongly dependent on the reaction pressure and temperature (Banerjee and Chakraborty, 2009). The pressure of reaction is usually atmospheric pressure except for the supercritical methanol method (Srivastava and Prasad, 2000). When methanol is used, then the temperature of the reaction should be below the boiling point temperature of methanol (70 °C at atmospheric pressure) (Raheem et al., 2020). From various studies, it is observed that the 50–70 °C is the optimum temperature range to produce biodiesel with high yield (Meng et al., 2008). Thermal energy supply should be sufficient enough to overcome the diffusion resistance of mixture of catalyst, alcohol, and oil feedstock by the increase in the number of collisions of reactant molecules (Makgaba et al., 2018). Increase in the temperature above the optimal point reduces the yield of biodiesel (Agarwal et al., 2011). High thermal energy vaporizes the methanol and creation of methanol vapor bubbles reduces the biodiesel yield (Degfie et al., 2019). When ethanol is used for transesterification of waste palm oil, the reaction temperature is taken 90 °C to get optimum biodiesel yield (Gunay et al., 2019). Reaction temperature also depends on the physicochemical properties of the oil (Phan and Phan, 2008). Yield of biodiesel increases with the increase in reaction temperature from room temperature to the boiling point of alcohol. In super critical methanol technique, high pressure and temperature are required to reach the critical point of methanol for effective biodiesel production (Sitepu et al., 2020). 5.3.1.9.2 Time of reaction Time of reaction is the important parameter that highly affects the refinery size and requirement of investments for biodiesel production on commercial-scale (Sitepu et al., 2020). Shorter reaction time is always desirable with complete triglycerides to esters conversion (Ouanji et al., 2016). During the first stage of biodiesel production, rate of transesterification reaction was fast up to the equilibrium point. After the equilibrium point, the backward reaction reduces the biodiesel yield. Degfie et al. found the optimum reaction time of 90 min with 96% of biodiesel yield (Degfie et al., 2019). Agarwal et al. reported decrease in biodiesel yield after 80 min due to hydrolysis of esters for a longer duration, causing more FFA to soap production (Agarwal et al., 2011). Reaction time with the use of homogenous base catalyst reported lower in comparison with a homogenous acid catalyst (Demirbas, 2009). When microwave heating is used with a homogenous CH3ONa catalyst, the reaction is completed only in 3 min (Chen et al., 2012). Time of transesterification reaction with different enzyme catalysts is reported higher than nano-catalysts (Table 6). This is happened due to the high surface area of nano-catalysts which increases their activity during the reaction. Reaction time for supercritical methanol transesterification reaction of WCO is reported lower in comparison with traditional catalysts (Aboelazayem et al., 2018). As the reaction duration is inversely related to the reaction temperature, so optimization of these parameters reduces energy consumption in biodiesel production. 5.3.1.9.3 Catalysts type and amount Different types of catalysts are used for the transesterification reaction of WCO. Various advantages and disadvantages associated with different catalysts are listed in Table 5. Heterogeneous catalysts are preferred over homogenous catalysts due to high reactivity. The selection of catalysts mainly depends on the type of oil. FFA content in WCO is high, so acid catalysts are preferred over base catalysts (Zhang et al., 2003b). There is a constraint also associated with the use of acid catalysts like corrosion of engine parts (Raheem et al., 2020). Degfie et al. reported the increase in the biodiesel yield with 0.5–1% (w/w) of heterogeneous CaO catalyst. Further increase in catalyst amount reduces the biodiesel yield due to soap formation. Optimum yield (96%) is obtained with 1% (w/w) of catalyst (Degfie et al., 2019). Agarwal et al. found the catalyst amount below the optimum value (1% by weight of oil) causes the incomplete reaction (Agarwal et al., 2011). In the case of enzyme catalysts, it is observed that an increase in catalyst amount increases the catalyst activity (Chen et al., 2009). Moderate amount of nano-catalysts is required in transesterification reaction due to the high surface area of nano-catalysts increase their activity during the reaction. There is no catalyst required when WCO is transesterified using supercritical methanol method. 5.3.1.9.4 Alcohol to oil molar ratio Biodiesel yield is profoundly affected by the molar alcohol to oil ratio (Jacobson et al., 2008). The highest reaction rate is obtained when 100% excess alcohol is used for the transesterification reaction. Due to the reversible nature of the transesterification reaction, an excess amount of alcohol is required to maintain the reaction in the forward direction (Banerjee and Chakraborty, 2009). For commercial-scale biodiesel production from WCO, 6:1 M alcohol to oil ratio is used (Raheem et al., 2020). The requirement of alcohol is more in the case of homogenous acid catalysts than homogenous base catalysts (Table 6). The reason behind the high alcohol requirement for the acid catalyst is due to high FFA content in WCO. Different types of alcohol like amyl alcohol, pentanol, butanol, propanol, ethanol, and methanol are used for transesterification reaction. Methanol is the mostly used alcohol due to its low cost and high polarity, followed by ethanol. A higher rate of transesterification reaction is obtained with methanol than ethanol. Less toxicity and production from renewable sources make ethanol as important alcohol for biodiesel production (Gunay et al., 2019). Degfie et al. experimentally evaluated the effect of variable molar ratio of methanol to oil (4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, and 10:1) on biodiesel yield. From molar ratio 4:1 to 8:1, the biodiesel yield increases due to the formation of methoxy species on the catalyst surface. The highest biodiesel yield (96%) is found for 8:1 M ratio of methanol to oil (Degfie et al., 2019). High amount of methanol than the optimum value slightly reduces the biodiesel yield due to the formation of emulsion during washing. Excess use of methanol reduces the reaction of methanol with oil feedstock and catalyst because methanol is highly dissolved in glycerol (Degfie et al., 2019). Methanol contains one polar hydroxyl group that causes the separation of ester difficult from water layer (Agarwal et al., 2011). The requirement of alcohol in the case of enzyme catalysts is less and moderate for nano-catalysts. In the case of supercritical methanol transesterification reaction, high alcohol is required (Table 6). 5.3.1.9.5 Water and FFA content in oil Water and FFA content are high in WCO due to frying operation. This increase in water content leads to more soap formation. Formation of soap increases the fuel's viscosity and also reduced the yield of the final product. Presence of water content also reduces the catalyst activity and the yield of biodiesel. Separation of final biodiesel products is also difficult due to the presence of high water and FFA content, so these amounts should be reduced before the transesterification of oil (Bradshaw and Meuly, 1944). The acid number of oils should be below 1% to performed base-catalyzed transesterification with a small base catalyst amount (Wright et al., 1944). For biodiesel production using transesterification reaction from different feedstocks primary step is the selection of catalyst. The reaction parameters like catalyst concentration, molar ratio of alcohol to oil, reaction pressure and temperature, and reaction duration should have their optimum value in order to get high biodiesel yield. On the basis of literature analysis, the influencing order of transesterification reaction parameters on biodiesel yield is catalyst type > catalyst concentration > alcohol to oil molar ratio > reaction pressure and temperature > time of reaction. 5.3.1.10 Biodiesel yield improvement approaches in the transesterification Many commercial-scale biodiesel plants produce biodiesel from vegetable oils utilizing the batch or continuous reactor (Lam et al., 2010). The most widely used catalysts are homogeneous baseline catalytic structures, such as KOH and NaOH, owing to quick reaction and mild reaction conditions. For WCO, a two-step transesterification is a suitable approach due to high water and FFA contents. This approach produces a high amount of wastewater than other approaches. This wastewater issue is resolved with the use of heterogeneous or enzymatic catalysts. Significant research efforts are required to improve the processing of biodiesel production with increase in mass and heat transfer effect (Yaakob et al., 2013). There are some processes improvements approaches in transesterification of WCO are as follows: • Microwave irradiation technology • Ultrasonic technology • Static mixers • Reactive distillation • Oscillatory flow reactor (OFR) • Centrifugal contactors • Membrane reactors • Rotating tube (spinning) reactors • Use of co-solvent like hexane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethyl ether (DME) 5.3.2 Dilution or blending Mixing of WCO directly (after pre-treatment) to the diesel fuel is known as dilution or blending. As the water and FFA content in WCO are high, they lead to engine wear and reduce engine performance. Formation of gum, chocking of injector nozzle, and high carbon deposition on piston heads are some other effects associated with the use of high viscous WCO directly in CI engines. In general, a liming percentage (20%) of oil is blended with conventional diesel fuel due to high viscosity (Singh and Singh, 2010). 5.3.3 Micro-emulsification Micro-emulsification is termed as a colloidal dispersion of optically isotropic fluid. The viscosity of WCO can be reduced with the help of this technique. At a low boiling point, the formation of explosive vapors increases the spray characteristic of fuel (Koh and Ghazi, 2011). Octanol, hexanol, butanol, ethanol, and methanol solvents are used to reduce the viscosity of oil to the required level. When micro-emulsified fuel is used in CI engines for a longer duration, then it creates problems like improper combustion, high carbon deposition, and sticking of the injector nozzle. 5.3.4 Thermal cracking or pyrolysis Thermal cracking is an anaerobic decomposition approach when heating of the oil is done in the absence of oxygen or air at medium temperature range. This is used to convert oil into biodiesel with adequate heat and with a catalyst or without a catalyst. This process may be used for biodiesel production from vegetable oils, waste plastic, water tyre oils, etc. (Jain and Sharma, 2010). The most critical parameter is the temperature during the pyrolysis process. The cost of biodiesel produced with this technique is high due to the high energy requirement. This method is less adoptive for biodiesel production from WCO due to less biodiesel yield and high cost. Based on residence time, this process is classified into three categories: • Slow or conventional pyrolysis • Fast pyrolysis • Flash or ultra-fast pyrolysis"
16,Waste cooking oil biodiesel downstream processing,"5.4 Waste cooking oil biodiesel downstream processing After completing basic biodiesel production steps, various downstream processing is required to produce biodiesel as per standard specifications. 5.4.1 Biodiesel separation After the completion of the biodiesel production process, biodiesel contains an excess amount of glycerol, catalyst, and methanol. Separation of glycerol can be done by gravity-based separation due to the difference in the specific gravity (Enweremadu and Mbarawa, 2009). Decantation approach can be used to separate the biodiesel from glycerol (Guo et al., 2002). Sedimentation (Encinar et al., 2007) and microwave irradiation (Ji et al., 2006) are other approaches to carry out the separation of phases. Among all these separation techniques, the use of separating funnel is a cost-effective approach to separate the glycerol from biodiesel (Meng et al., 2008). 5.4.2 Biodiesel purification Some impurities are also present in biodiesel after its separation from glycerol, like excess alcohol, catalyst, soap, and other dissolved impurities. These impurities can be removed with the following steps: • Alcohol recovery by evaporation with a vacuum pump. • Biodiesel washing with mist, bubble, stir, wet and dry approach to remove un-reacted oil, soap, and catalyst (Fonseca et al., 2019). • Membrane extraction can be used for separation of sodium soap, alcohol, and water (Atadashi, 2015) • Precipitation method can be used to remove calcium ions from crude biodiesel (Chozhavendhan et al., 2020). Some of the dissolved impurities are difficult to separate due to the formation of an emulsion. In this situation, use of centrifugal breaks and sodium chloride increase the speed of phase separation (Dunford, 2006). 5.4.3 Biodiesel drying Biodiesel is not colorless but transparent when it is in pure form. Presence of smoke or cloudiness reflects the need for purification. Heating and usage of chemical material are preferred in the drying of biodiesel (Lapuerta et al., 2008). Drying of biodiesel just needs to heat up to 55 °C for 15–20 min. Any residual water can quickly be evaporated or drained away (Encinar et al., 2007). One of the advantages of heating is that it also removes some residual concentrations of alcohol. The most popular chemical used in the WCO biodiesel purification is anhydrous sodium sulfate (Tomasevic and Siler-Marinkovic, 2003). Specific industrial compounds have also been used for drying, including anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Felizardo et al., 2006). 5.4.4 Biodiesel distillation Distillation is the final purification stage for biodiesel production from WCO to achieve the final biodiesel product that complies with the standard specifications. It is a common purification step to eliminate the unwanted impurities and odor from biodiesel (Zullaikah et al., 2005). It can be done with the help of a vacuum gauge and a condenser (Wang et al., 2006)."
17,Performance and emissions parameters of the engine using waste cooking oil biodiesel,"Biodiesel produced from WCO using different production techniques can be utilized in CI engines (Enweremadu and Rutto, 2010). These engines can be fueled with pure biodiesel or blends with diesel fuel (Sakthivel et al., 2018). This section provides detailed insights on the performance and emissions analysis of CI engines operated on WCO biodiesel and its blends (Table 7 )."
18,Performance analysis,"6.1 Performance analysis Engine performance parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake power (BP), and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are affected with the use of biodiesel produced from waste oils. Effects of using WCO biodiesel and its blends on BTE, BP, and BSFC are listed in Table 7. Lertsathapornsuk et al. used microwave irradiation technique to produce biodiesel from waste palm oil, and this biodiesel is used in the John-Deere 6076TF030 engine (Lertsathapornsuk et al., 2008). The study is conducted using B50 and B100 blend for a load range of 0–75 kW. There is a decrease in BTE, and an increase in BSFC is observed for both B50 and B100 fuels. When an experiment is conducted on Kirloskar single-cylinder engine using pure biodiesel for 0.5–4.0 kW loading conditions and 1500 rpm, the maximum 4% decrease in BTE and 0.07 kg/kWh increase in minimum BSFC is observed (Hirkude and Padalkar, 2012). When a four-cylinder turbocharged DI engine is used in the study of pure biodiesel, an increase in BSFC and decrease in BP is reported (An et al., 2013). Muralidharan and Vasudevan conducted an experiment on variable compression ratio (VCR) CI engine using B40 fuel. In this study, the effect of fuel on BTE, BP, and BSFC is evaluated with variation in the compression ratio. Increase in BTE by 5.4% and decrease in BP and BSFC by 0.05 kW and 0.055 kg/kWh, respectively, is reported (Muralidharan and Vasudevan, 2011). A study on TDI 110 turbocharged engine reported 0.55% decrease in BP and 14.34% increase in BSFC for B100 in comparison with diesel fuel (Utlu and Koçak, 2008). An experiment conducted on the Cummins B5.9-160 engine reported a rise in BSFC for B5, B10, B20, and B30 biodiesel blends. The highest increase in BSFC is found for the B30 fuel blend (3.42%) (Lin et al., 2011). Decrease in BTE and increase in both BP and BSFC is observed with the use of B20 fuel in a single-cylinder water-cooled engine of 3.7 kW rated power (Pradhan et al., 2016). Biodiesel production from waste oil in the presence of methanol is known as methyl esters (ME), and in the presence of ethanol is termed as ethyl esters (EE). A study is conducted on a turbocharged Ford cargo six-cylinder engine using both ME and EE from waste oil (Sanli et al., 2015). Increase in BSFC for ME (14.17%) is observed more than increase in BSFC for EE (11.44%). The majority of the literature surveyed showed a slight decrease in the BP of the engine with an increase in biodiesel percentage in the blend. Some researchers have used decreased heat content to justify this power deficit. Although, the argument may be made to compensate for maintaining the same power due to the higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of pure biodiesel or biodiesel blends. Some other authors justified the loss of power caused due to atomization problems in fuel flow. Due to the availability of a significant amount of oxygen, biodiesel has a lower weight basis calorific value but often higher specific gravity than traditional diesel fuel. Agarwal has found that the energy content per unit volume is around five percent lower overall (Agarwal, 2007). The higher viscosity may clarify a potential explanation for WCO's weak BTE compared with the baseline diesel fuel. Injection pressure and atomization ratio also affected the BSFC of WCO biodiesel (Hajjari et al., 2017). Comparison of fuels based on BSFC with different calorific values and densities may be misleading. Thus, BTE should be used instead of BSFC to compare various parameters (Enweremadu and Rutto, 2010). By evaluating various fuels, the heating value decreases when the biodiesel percentage in the blend increases and this value is less than petroleum diesel."
19,Emissions analysis,"6.2 Emissions analysis Engine performance and emissions largely depend on the physicochemical properties of the fuel. Biodiesel derived from WCO has comparable properties with traditional diesel fuel. The oxygen content of biodiesel is more in comparison with diesel fuel (Sakthivel et al., 2018). This high content of oxygen leads to a reduction of CO and HC emissions due to the proper burning of fuel. NOx emissions are increased with an increase in oxygen amount (Enweremadu and Rutto, 2010). The effect of WCO biodiesel fuel in CI engines on emissions parameters like CO, HC, CO2, NOx, PM, and smoke emissions are discussed in Table 7. When B50 and B100 biodiesel is used in John-Deere 6076TF030 six-cylinder engine, CO emissions decrease by 18% for B50 blend and 14% for B100. A higher reduction in HC emissions is observed for B100. NOx emissions are increased by 12.62% and 1.84% for B100 and B50 fuel, respectively (Lertsathapornsuk et al., 2008). In another study with the use of B5 and B10 biodiesel blend, the reduction in both CO and HC emissions and increase in CO2 and NOx emissions are observed (Can, 2014). PM emissions are reduced by 47% with the use of pure biodiesel in the Kirloskar single-cylinder engine (Hirkude and Padalkar, 2012). When a study is conducted on a single-cylinder DI engine using pure biodiesel, then CO (31%), HC (57%), and smoke emissions are reduced (15% for the full load and 10% for part load), while NOx emissions are increased (18.33%) (Gopal et al., 2014). Valente et al. conducted an experiment on MWM D229/4 four-cylinder engine using B50 and B75 blends. CO emissions increased by 46.1%, HC emissions by 23.5% (B50), CO2 emissions by 13.30% and NOx emissions increased by 6.5% (Valente et al., 2012). When B0, B20, B50, B100, and refined B20 are used as fuels in YC6M220G six-cylinder engine, CO emissions are decreased by 18.60% for refined B20 fuel in comparison with B0 blend. HC and PM emissions are reduced by 26.70% and 20.58%, respectively, for refined B20 fuel (Meng et al., 2008). Isik et al. reported a decrease in CO and CO2 emissions and increase in HC and NOx emission with the use of B20 biodiesel blend (Isik et al., 2017). Atmanli experimentally found 33.28% increase in CO emissions and very high (78.84%) increase in HC emissions. NOx emissions are reduced by 1.68% with the use of pure WCO biodiesel in six-cylinder IDI engine (Atmanli, 2016). Results suggested that pure biodiesel fuel produces significant reductions in total smoke, HC, and particulate emissions. NOx emissions are increased significantly for WCO biodiesel in comparison with traditional diesel fuel. The amount of alcohol used in biodiesel production has a significant impact on the total emissions of PM and HC. Alcohol has a volatile nature and resulted in raising both the concentrations of HC and PM. Ethyl esters showed lower total hydrocarbon (THC) concentrations at medium load conditions than methyl esters and no significant change at lower loading conditions (Sakthivel et al., 2018). In the case of methyl ester, marginally higher decreases in PM emissions and opacity with respect to diesel fuel are found. PM emissions are decreased significantly at peak loading conditions. NOx emissions are reduced at low loads and increased at peak loading conditions. Increase in NOx emissions is dependent on the operational conditions such as loading conditions, test conditions, and type of alcohol used (Utlu and Koçak, 2008). However, some studies have reported reduction in NOx emissions with the use of WCOME and its blends (Enweremadu and Rutto, 2010). The combustion chamber pressure, temperature, and oxygen concentration are the main factors behind the increase in NOx emissions. The studies reported decrease in NOx emissions due to very less nitrogen content in fuel. Biodiesel fuel is widely known to have no sulfur and aromatics content. This will create low levels of nitrogen in fuel. Any change in droplet size, droplet dynamics, and degree of mix with air and rate of penetration, evaporation capacity, and radiant heat transmission capacity resulted in the development of NOx. The effects of fuel chemistry could also result in a change in the production of NOx in the flame region. A reduction in CO emissions has been found in the majority of the literature studied when diesel fuel is substituted by WCO biodiesel and its blends. With the increase in acid value, the CO emission increases. In particular research, CO emissions were decreased for pure biodiesel and increased for blends. With the increase in saturation levels, CO emissions are decreased (Enweremadu and Rutto, 2010). The reason for general reduction of biodiesel CO emissions includes the additional oxygen contents in the fuel that improves combustion (Lee et al., 2018). At high pressure and temperature inside the combustion chamber, CO gets converted into CO2 due to high oxygen content in WCO biodiesel. HC emissions are decreased due to the complete combustion of biodiesel. HC emissions are reduced more at high engine speed due to the increase in the atomization of fuel (Canakci et al., 2009)."
20,Conclusion and scope of future work,"Present review study collects state-of-art information of WCO to biodiesel production and its efficient use in CI engines. WCO belongs to the 3rd generation of biodiesel. Approximately 30% of per capita edible oil consumption is generated as waste. The use of WCO reduces the cost of biodiesel production and reduces the load on waste disposal plants. WCO is originated from edible oils after the frying process. WCO can be collected from food processing industries, restaurants, and houses. This collected WCO has high water and FFA contents. In order to reduce these values, pre-treatment of oil is required before biodiesel production. Oleic acid (45.15%) and linoleic acid (39.74%) are the main fatty acids content of WCO. High biodiesel yield is obtained with some catalysts like homogenous acid H2SO4 (99%), homogenous base KOH (98.20%), heterogeneous acid ZrHPW (98.90%), heterogeneous base K3PO4 (97.30%), enzyme PS 30 (96%), and nano-catalyst CaO–MgO (98.95%). The high cost of enzyme and nano-catalysts make them less favorable in commercial-scale biodiesel production. Supercritical methanol method required the least time for the reaction to complete, but excess energy and methanol requirement are the drawbacks of this approach. Among all these methods, two-step transesterification is the most suitable method for industrial-scale biodiesel production with high biodiesel yield and low cost. Yield of biodiesel produced from transesterification reaction is highly influenced by the reaction parameters in order of; catalyst type > catalyst concentration > alcohol to oil molar ratio > reaction pressure and temperature > time of reaction. The physicochemical properties of WCO biodiesel are comparable with conventional diesel fuel. An increase in BSFC and decrease in BTE and BP are observed when WCO biodiesel is used in CI engines. Poor atomization of fuel inside the combustion chamber and lower heating value of fuel are the reasons behind these variations. With the increase in percentage of pure WCO biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blend, BTE decreases and BSFC increases. CO, HC, PM, and smoke emissions are significantly reduced with the use of WCO biodiesel in CI engines; however, NOx and CO2 emissions are found higher in comparison with diesel fuel due to the oxygenate nature of biodiesel. CI engines are more prone to NOx emissions due to their lean-burn nature, so antioxidants are added in biodiesel to lower down these emissions. Overall, it could be concluded that biodiesel produced from WCO serves as a cleaner and economical alternative source of fuel for CI engines. On the basis of literature analysis, it is found that vast research opportunities are available in the area of effective WCO collection and economical pre-treatment to reduce FFA and water contents. Research efforts can be made in the area of yield improvement without affecting the economic feasibility of biodiesel production process. Increase in photon to fuel conversion efficiency (PFCE) with the application of synthetic biology is the revolutionary future area of research."
