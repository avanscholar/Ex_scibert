0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production by photocatalytic H2O splitting into hydrogen and oxygen [H2O + hν → H2 + ½O2] would be an ideal route, as the raw materials (water and sunlight) are abundant [1]. However, a major shortcoming of photocatalytic splitting of H2O is the recombination of oxygen and hydrogen molecules. Utilization of a sacrificial agent is a well-studied approach to overcome the recombination oxygen and hydrogen molecules; in which the sacrificial agent react with the oxygen molecules to eradicate the recombination [2]. Yang et al. [3] reviewed the vital roles of cocatalysts in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical H2O splitting reactions. The authors indicated that the many research observations suggest that the oxidation and/or reduction (dual) cocatalysts are required to obtain efficient photocatalysts for H2O splitting reactions. It was also reported that loading of dual cocatalysts on semiconductors can accommodate oxidation and reduction reactions by providing the active sites, while suppressing the charge recombination and reverse reactions. In another review, Puga [4] indicated that surface deposited metallic or metal oxide nanomaterials are the preferred co-catalysts. In many studies, it was proved that noble metals exhibits best performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production and it appears that Pt is the most effective metallic element, followed by Pd, for photoreforming catalysts [5]. One of the most frequently studied semiconductor material for photocatalytic production of hydrogen is TiO2 [band gap energy in the range of 3.0–3.2 eV]; this is because of its photosensitivity, less expensive, non-toxic, and high chemical and thermal stability [6]. It is known that TiO2 occurs in three different crystalline forms, anatase, rutile and brookite [7]. Most of the early photocatalysis studies were revealed that anatase is the best photocatalyst among TiO2 polymorphs [8]. It is well known that TiO2 polymorphs can be activated mainly by near-UV radiation, therefore it is not an efficient photocatalyst under visible irradiation [9]. In addition, a high electron–hole recombination rate decreases the photocatalytic capability of TiO2 anatase semiconductor [10]. Due to these disadvantages, development of a sustainable photocatalytic technology using TiO2 based semiconductor materials and solar light has not been realized yet [11]. However, researchers found a practical alternative to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 materials by dispersing the metals or metal oxides on the surface of semiconductors. Decades ago, Sato et al. [12] observed the improvement of photocatalytic ability of TiO2 semiconductor after deposition of metals or metal oxides for the first time; the researcher discovered the Pt loaded TiO2 catalyst significantly improved the photocatalytic conversion of H2O to produce H2. It was well reported that addition of noble metals could enhance the separation of photo generated electron–hole pairs and existence another phenomenon called surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [13]. In another report, Li et al. used the oxidized Pt clusters as a co-catalyst for a photocatalytic process [14]. It was reported that over-all photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is depends on many parameters such as adsorption capacity of semiconductor including specific surface area, rate of electron–hole recombination, photocatalyst morphology, intensity of light, and also photocatalytic reaction conditions [3]. To enhance the photocatalytic efficiency under visible irradiation, it is crucial to tune the physicochemical characteristics of TiO2 semiconductor [15]. Hou et al. [16] synthesized TiO2/WO3/g-C3N4 ternary hybrid nanofibers and porous BiVO4@TiO2 core–shell hybrid nanofibers for visible light active photocatalytic H2 production [17]. Momeni et al. [18] used nanotube-structured TiO2, with a high specific surface area to obtain highly active photocatalyst. In another study, researchers studied the influence of nanosized TiO2 semiconductor morphology (zigzag, helics and rod) on the photo degradation of organic pollutants [19]. The researchers concluded that TiO2 nano zig-zag films exhibited superior photocatalytic degradation activity compared to nanohelics and nanorods because of the fact that nano zig-zag films possessed large surface area, high porosity with dispersion of active sites across the pores and also presence of more oxygen deficient species. It was also observed that mesoporous TiO2 fibers exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity and stability compared to both the conventional synthesized and commercially available TiO2 samples [20]. Despite of many dedicated TiO2 photocatalysis studies were existed in the literature, controlling the generation of selective TiO2 phase, size and morphology still an interesting topic of research, because TiO2 photo stability, electronic transitions and other physico-chemical properties vary with them [6]. In this research, we study and analyze the influence of TiO2 morphology of PtOx-TiO2 anatase catalysts for photocatalytic reformation of methanol to hydrogen process. Three PtOx-TiO2 anatase (2.0 wt.% Pt) samples with nanoparticles (NP), nanotubes (NT) and nanofibers (NF) morphology were prepared to study the role of morphology on the photocatalytic reformation of methanol. The prepared PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials were systematically analyzed by different techniques to evaluate physico-chemical properties of the samples and correlate them with photocatalytic activity in reformation of methanol to hydrogen."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of TiO2 anatase nanomaterials,"2.1 Preparation of TiO2 anatase nanomaterials 2.1.1 TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (Ti-A-NP) Ti-A-NP sample was prepared by adapting previously reported sol–gel method [21]. In a beaker, 150 mL of ethanol was added to determined quantity of titanium isopropoxide solution under continuous stirring and kept the beaker at ambient conditions for 60 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by slow addition of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide solution under constant stirring. A colorless gel was formed at pH = 10 and it was transformed into a white colored precipitate after removing the excess ethanol by heating the gel at 80 °C. The obtained white precipitate was washed three times with ethanol and dried in air at 100 °C for 12 h and then calcined under the flow of air at 400 °C for 5 h. 2.1.2 TiO2 anatase nanotubes (Ti-A-NT) The Ti-A-NT sample was prepared by following the alkaline hydrothermal method proposed by Kasuga et al. [22]. In the synthesis, 6 g of Ti-A-NP sample was dispersed in 120 mL of 10 M NaOH solution. The resultant suspension was stirred for 30 min, and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 130 °C for 48 h in an electric oven. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature and obtained material was filtered, neutralized with 0.1 M HCl solution and washed with deionized water for five times to remove the unwanted products. The material was then dried at 100 °C for 12 h and finally calcined under the flow of air at 400 °C for 5 h. 2.1.3 TiO2 anatase nanofibers (Ti-A-NF) TiO2 anatase nanofibers (NnF CERAM-TiO2) material was procured from Pardam nanotechnology, Czech Republic. The obtained bulk TiO2 anatase nanofibers material was calcined under the flow of air at 400 °C for 5 h. 2.1.4 PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials In a typical synthesis, 50 mg of TiO2 anatase nanomaterial and 24.6 mg of polymer (polyvinyl alcohol) were added into round bottom flask containing H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (0.2 mg/mL). After the suspension becoming uniform by sonication, 0.5 mL of freshly prepared sodium borohydride (NaBH4) aqueous solution (2 mg/mL) was injected to reduce the H2PtCl6 under vigorously stirring, and another 0.5 mL of NaBH4 solution was injected after 2 h. The solution was kept stirring for 12 h to obtain a precipitate and the formed precipitate was separated by centrifugation and it was washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times. The PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterial was finally obtained by drying the powder at 100 °C for 3 h in air."
3,Characterization of synthesized nanomaterials,"2.2 Characterization of synthesized nanomaterials The elemental composition of the synthesized materials was determined by using ICP-AES, Optima 7300DV (PerkinElmer) instrument. The XRD patterns of the powders were collected by using PANalytical XpertPro diffractometer. The crystallite size of obtained materials was determined by applying the Debye–Scherer equation. The TEM analysis of the samples was carried out using JEOL 2100HT microscope operated at 200 kV, with images collected on a Gatan digital camera. The laser Raman spectral analysis of the samples was carried out using Bruker Equinox 55 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an FRA106/S FT-Raman module and a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge detector using the 1064-nm line of a Nd:YAG laser with an output laser power of 200 mW. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the samples were collected using Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 Xi XPS instrument with Al Kα X-rays having a spot size of 650 mm. The peak shift due to charge compensation was corrected using the binding energy of C1s peak. The data was acquired using pass energy of 100 eV, dwell time 200 ms with a step size of 0.1 eV and 10–30 scans. The quantitative determination of the Pt active sites over the catalysts using CO pulse chemisorption measurements using laboratory made equipment. Prior to analysis, known amount of the sample (100 mg) was reduced at 250 °C under H2 flow (40 mL min−1) for 60 min and then cooled to 25 °C under the flow of helium gas. Then, the CO pulse injection was conducted in a flow of helium gas stream. The metal dispersion was evaluated from the amount of CO consumption (assuming CO/Pt = 1). The textural properties of the samples were obtained from the N2-physisorption experiments, which were conducted using Quantachrome ASiQ adsorption system. Optical properties were measured by Thermo-Scientific evolution UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm to measure the reflectance spectra of samples. Band gap energy values of all the samples were calculated using Kubelka–Munk method. The Kubelka–Munk factor (K) was determined by following equation; K = (1-R)2/2 R, where R is the % reflectance. The wavelengths (nm) were translated into energies (E) and a plot was drawn between (K∗E)0.5 and E to obtain a curve. The bandgap energy (eV) was obtained as the intersection point of the two slopes in the curve."
4,Photocatalytic reforming of methanol to hydrogen,2.3 Photocatalytic reforming of methanol to hydrogen Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in the liquid phase in a Pyrex flask under an argon atmosphere. The catalyst (150 mg) was dispersed by stirring at 500 rpm in 120 mL of a 20 vol% methanolic aqueous solution at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark to equilibrate any adsorption processes and ensure a uniform catalyst suspension. The reactor was then evacuated and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp providing a flux of approximately 125 mW cm−2 in the reaction zone for 1 h. Evolved gases flowing into the gas chromatograph sample loop through a closed gas circulation and the product analysis for H2 was carried out by using a Varian 3300 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2 m MS 13X column.
5,Results and discussion,"The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained to study the crystalline properties of bulk TiO2 and 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials (NP, NT and NF). The obtained patterns for are shown in Fig. 1 . It is well reported that TiO2 anatase phase exhibits major reflections at 2θ = 24.9°, 37.2°, 47.8°, 53.6°, 55.2°, and 62.3° corresponding to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) planes as referenced in JCPDS No. 21–1272. The bulk Ti-A-NP, Ti-A-NT and Ti-A-NF samples exhibited sharp reflections corresponding to the anatase crystalline structure, revealing that the synthesized samples possessed well-crystalline anatase phase. It is clear that the three samples have not exhibited any reflections due to presence of either rutile or brookite phase. It is also observed that the intensity of the anatase reflections are relatively high and also sharp in case of Ti-A-NT sample compared to Ti-A-NP and Ti-A-NF samples, revealing that the crystallinity of anatase phase and its size are high in Ti-A-NT than other two samples. Interestingly, the XRD patterns of 2.0PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials samples exhibited reflections due to Pt crystallites [JCPDS PDF card No. 04–0802] and PtO2 phase, thus revealing the presence of crystalline Pt and also oxidized Pt particles in the samples. Close examination of the XRD reflections reveal that they are weak and broad, revealing that the samples possessed nanosize Pt and PtO2 crystallites. However, the intensity of the reflections due to TiO2 anatase phase were decreased after the deposition of PtOx. This observation indicating that TiO2 crystalline structure was modified due to presence of an extra crystalline phase. It is interesting to note that Pt–Ti-A-NT sample maintaining the high crystallinity among the synthesized samples. The bulk Ti-A-NP, Ti-A-NT and Ti-A-NF samples possessed different crystallite sizes due to the different preparation conditions used to synthesize the samples. The crystallite sizes of anatase and PtOx phases presented in the synthesized samples were determined from full-width at the half-maximum of major reflections due to anatase and PtO phases using Scherrer formula (Table 1 ). The observed data indicating that the crystallite size of TiO2 anatase and PtOx are lower in case of 2.0 Pt–Ti–NF nanomaterial. Obviously, the deposition of PtOx nanoparticles resulted decrease of crystallite size of TiO2 anatase in all the samples. To compare the crystallite size of phases with particle sizes and investigate the morphology of materials, TEM measurements of the catalysts were performed. The TEM images of the bulk TiO2 and Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials samples are shown in Fig. 2 . TEM image of the bulk Ti-A-NF sample comprises of TiO2 nanofibers with diameter in the range of 20–40 nm and few micro meters in length. A uniform deposition of PtOx nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers was noticed with PtOx particles size in the range of 5–9 nm. It is clear that deposition of 2.0 wt.% of Pt resulted decrease of the length of the TiO2 nanofibers. This is probably due to the reduction treatment during the PtOx deposition. The TEM analysis of the bulk TiO2 anatase nanotubes samples revealing that the sample composed of tightly packed bundles of uniform nanotubes with an average diameter of 10 nm and length around 200 nm. The 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample exhibited typical morphology as the Ti-A-NT sample, however the length of the tubes was decreased as in case of nanofibers due to reduction treatment. Presence of PtOx nanoparticles as non-spherical black spots with size around 8 nm on the surface of the TiO2 tubes could be clearly observed. The TEM image of bulk Ti-A-NP sample clearly shown the presence of near spherical nanoparticles with size in the range of 10–20 nm as shown in Fig. 2. The TEM image also shows that the sample consisted of some agglomerated TiO2 particles. The 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP sample also possessed dense packed nanoparticles composed of PtOx as dark black spots on the surface of TiO2 particles. The results from TEM analysis revealing that deposition of PtOx had little effect on the TiO2 anatase morphology. For further morphology studies, the HRTEM images of both Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT samples were obtained (Fig. S1, ESI). The images displayed the existence of multi-walled hollow TiO2 nanotubes with open end. It is also clear that the nanotubes have lengths up to 1.0–2.5 μm, average outer diameters in the range of 5–8 nm, inner diameters of 4 nm. The HRTEM image of samples also show the characteristic lattice fringes with ‘d’ equal to 0.352 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 [23]. The exhibition of TiO2 anatase nanotubes with good crystallinity are in accordance with the results from the XRD analysis. The HRTEM image of the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample revealed the presence of Pt/PtOx nanoparticles with diameter around 4–6 nm in on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes. And the image also providing an evidence that the Pt nanoparticles are encapsulated in the TiO2 nanotube structure which indicates the strong Pt–TiO2 interaction. The Raman spectroscopy was used to further investigate the structural features of the synthesized bulk TiO2 and PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials samples (Fig. 3 ). It can be observed from the figure that the bulk TiO2 nanomaterials showed Raman bands at 144, 196, 394, 510, and 636 cm−1, which could be attributed to the anatase phase [24]. The Raman spectra of 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials samples are very similar to those of the bulk TiO2 samples, which means that the anatase phase of the 2.0 Pt–TiO2 nanomaterials possess a certain degree of long-range order. The position of typical Eg (1) Raman band for TiO2 anatase phase in bulk TiO2 nanomaterials was observed around 144 cm−1, however it was observed in the range of 146–150 cm−1 for 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials. Therefore, the three Pt deposited samples possessed small particle size compared to bulk TiO2 nanomaterials. This displacement in the Eg (1) signal to lower values of Raman shift is in accordance with the particle size. It was previously reported that broadening and shifting of Raman band occurs with decreasing particle size. Xu et al. [25] revealed that variation in the position of the Raman bands is because of phonon confinement; the authors explained that when the particle size is smaller, the phonon confinement increases within the particle, which leads to increase in the phonon momentum distribution. The enhanced the phonon momentum distribution causes asymmetric broadening and could lead to a shift in the position of the Raman bands [26]. There is no other peaks detected due to the dispersion of PtOx over the TiO2 anatase nanomaterials, which indicates that dominance of Raman bands due to TiO2 nanomaterials and these results are in agreement with the observed XRD observation. The DR UV–vis spectra of the synthesized of bulk TiO2 and 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials are shown in Fig. 4 . The bulk Ti-A-NP, Ti-A-NT and Ti-A-NF samples exhibited absorption bands below 400 nm, which could be assigned to the charge-transfer from VB of O atoms to the CB of Ti atoms [27]. It is clear that the bulk anatase TiO2 samples have not exhibited any absorption bands in the 400–750 nm range as displayed in the figure. The DR UV–vis spectra of 2.0 Pt-A-Ti-NP, 2.0 Pt-A-Ti-NT and 2.0 Pt-A-Ti-NF samples exhibited additional absorption band around 550 nm (visible region). It is clear that deposition of PtOx resulted the presence of absorption bands in the visible region. The excitation of Pt 4d electrons into the TiO2 conduction band (charge transfer transition) is responsible for presence of visible absorption bands [28]. The band around 550 nm could be attributed to the d–d transition in the Pt species. Existence of Pd–O–Ti bonds in PtOx-TiO2 materials could lead to overlapping between the CB of TiO2 and d-orbitals of Pt, which subsequently allows the composite to absorb the visible light. Appearance of a broad band at 550 nm is an evidence that interaction between the PtOx particles and TiO2 was existed as the enhancement of local electric field at the Pt–TiO2 interface was occurred [29]. Bigall et al. [30] reported that presence of large size Pt nanoparticles is the reason for an existence of localized surface plasmonic (LSP) absorption at the visible and even near-IR regions. Jung et al. [31] also reported that Pt nanorods showing LSP absorption band at ~400 nm. It was observed that the larger Pt particles, the larger near field enhancement at the PtOx-TiO2 interface because the SPR intensity increases with particulate size. It is clear that the intensities of absorption bands of 2.0 Pt–TiO2 nanomaterials are different, 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample shows high absorption compared to other two samples, indicating that the large size metal particles are presented this catalyst. The band gap energy values were calculated for the synthesized samples from the Tauc plots as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). By drawing the tangent to the slope, the intrinsic bandgap values for all the samples were obtained. The data revealed that the band gap energy for Ti-A-NT sample (2.56 eV) is lower compared to Ti-A-NF (2.86 eV) and Ti-A-NP (2.96 eV) samples. The band gap of TiO2 slightly decreased when the particle size was increased. A decrease in the value of the band gap energy for PtOx dispersed TiO2 nanomaterials. For 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP, 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NF samples, the bandgap energies are equal to 2.50 eV, 2.38 eV and 2.15 eV respectively. Therefore, Pt deposition could considerably alter the activity towards a visible light region. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms for bulk TiO2 and 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials samples are shown in Fig. 5 . The Ti-A-NP and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP samples showed type IV isotherms with H2 type hysteresis loops at P/Po of 0.46–0.86 for both materials, indicating that the materials possessed pores in the range of 1.5–100 nm as per the IUPAC regulations [32]. It is clear that the shape of the hysteresis loop changed after dispersion of PtOx over the Ti-A-NP semiconductor and the area of the hysteresis loop was also decreased. These observations revealing that the both bulk Ti-A-NP and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP samples has mesopores and Pt dispersion resulted the partial filling of mesopores of TiO2 nanoparticles. The Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT samples exhibited type V isotherms with H1 hysteresis loops [33], indicates there is a small interaction between nitrogen and the catalyst, and the both these catalyst samples possessed well-defined cylindrical pore channels in the range of 1.5–100 nm. It is clear that there is a slight change in the shape of hysteresis loop after dispersion of PtOx, indicating that the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample have pores with narrow necks and ink-bottle shape. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Ti-A-NF and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT samples can be characterized as type II, which generally found when the adsorption occurs on non-porous materials or powders with small amount of micropores or mesopores [32]. Both of nanofibers samples exhibited the H3 type hysteresis loops, reveals the possession of large aggregated particles with slit-shaped pores. The NLDFT method was used to obtain the pore size distribution patterns as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). The bulk Ti-A-NP material exhibited a broad pore size distribution (PSD) peak at 36 Å because of presence of unimodal pores, however a sharp PSD peak at 20 Å was appeared after dispersion of Pt. The bulk Ti-A-NF and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NF samples showed a narrow PSD peaks at pore radius of 18 Å and 20 Å respectively. It is interesting to note that the modification of TiO2 anatase nanofibers with Pt resulted shift in PSD peak position to higher values, revealing the growth in the inter-particle pore size in case of nanofibers sample. The bulk Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT samples exhibited broad PSD peaks with average pore radius of 215 Å and 195 Å. It is clear that pore size have not changed significantly after Pt decoration. The textural properties of the samples including BET surface area and pore volume were tabulated in Table 2 . The BET surface area and pore volume values for Pt deposited TiO2 anatase samples are lower than that of bulk TiO2 nanomaterials samples. The decrease of surface and pore volume could be due to the formation of crystalline PtOx particles on the pore channels of TiO2 nanomaterials. The observed variations in particle size and textural properties of PtOx deposited TiO2 nanomaterials could be due to the interaction between the PtOx and TiO2 nanomaterial (NP, NT and NF). The highest BET surface area was observed for bulk Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT samples; this is possibly due to the fact that the samples possessed mesopore structure and high Pt dispersion. Fig. 6 displays deconvoluted Ti2p, O1s and Pt4f XP spectra for prepared 2.0 Pt–TiO2 nanomaterials materials. The investigated materials exhibited a main peak at 457.2 eV attributed to 2p 3/2 of Ti4+ in case of 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP sample [34]. The 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NF samples also exhibited a very similar 2p 3/2 peak at 457.2 eV and these results demonstrating that the majority of the Ti species are existed as Ti4+ state in all PtOx dispersed TiO2 nanomaterials samples. It is interesting note that two small shoulders were appeared at 455.7 eV and 458.5 eV, which could be attributed to a Ti3+ state (oxygen deficient species in TiO2) and Ti4+ ions in Ti–OH species [35]. The observed peak intensities of Ti2p spectra revealing that the concentration of oxygen-deficient TiO2 species (Ti3+) are more in case of 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT than 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NP and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NF samples. The 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials exhibited three O1s XP peaks at 528.1 eV, 529.2 eV, and 531.3 eV. The major peak appeared at 528.1 eV could be assigned to lattice oxygen species in TiO2 phase, and the O1s peaks at 529.2 eV and 531.3 eV are due to the oxygen atoms in the Ti–OH functional groups [28]. The intensity of the O1s XP peaks due to surface hydroxyl groups are slightly higher in 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample than the other two samples. As observed, concentrations of both Ti3+ and Ti–OH species are high in nanotubes sample, there is a clear possibility that the –OH groups are attached to the surface defects in the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample. The deconvolution of Pt 4f XP spectra of all the Pt loaded TiO2 nanomaterials samples yielded four different characteristic peaks at 72.4 eV, 75.1 eV, 76.2 eV and 78.8 eV. The two peaks appeared at 72.4 eV and 76.2 eV could be assigned to the Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 for Pt2+ species respectively and the peaks appeared at 75.1 eV and 78.8 eV could be assigned to Pt4+ of PtO2 [36]. The absence of XPS peaks at 71.1 eV (4f 7/2 ) and 74.3 eV (4f 5/2 ) for Pt metal species indicating that the catalysts consists of oxidized Pt species [37]. A summary of the binding energies and suggested valence states of the elements and quantitative estimation of surface Pt (0), Pt (II) and Pt (IV) species presented in fresh 2.0PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials and spent 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample are provided in a Table S1 and Table S2 respectively. It is also important to observe that the intensity of XPS peaks corresponding to surface Pt2+ species are higher than Pt4+ species. And also the intensities of the peak due to Pt4+ species are different for the three samples revealing that the concentration of surface Pt4+ species different and it is high in case of 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample. The bulk and surface concentration of Ti, O and Pt presented in the synthesized samples are tabulated in Table 2. The determined composition data indicating that the bulk and surface composition of O and Ti are almost same for all the synthesized samples. However, in case of Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials, Pt concentration on the surface is lower than in bulk indicating that Pt was deposited inside the pore channels of the TiO2 nanomaterials. The results of CO chemisorption and Pt dispersion of synthesized PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials are presented in Table 1. The percentage of Pt dispersion was measured by assuming that one CO molecule adsorbed on one Pt metal site [5]. The results indicate that the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalyst reduced at 250 °C shows the highest Pt dispersion (55%) among the investigated catalysts due to the uniform distribution of Pt metal nanoparticles on the TiO2-NT surface. The presence of higher amount of surface Ti3+ and OH functional groups on the surface of TiO2-NT (XPS results) could be responsible for obtaining high Pt dispersion, as it is well known that the oxide surface have great influence on electrostatic interactions between the metal precursor and the support. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts was tested for hydrogen generation from aqueous methanol solution. To optimize the reaction conditions, several parameters such as methanol concentration, mass of the catalyst, pH of methanol & water mixture and reaction temperature were studied over bulk TiO2 and PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials. It was previously reported that the potential for oxidation of methanol is −0.95 V and methanol to CO2 is 0.044 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the potential for oxidation of water process is 1.23 V [38]. It is clear that the energy difference between the VB of TiO2 semiconductor (2.7 V) and standard electrode potentials of these reactions is large. It was also observed that photocatalytic oxidation of water would not be possible, when bulk TiO2 photocatalyst was used and the excited photoelectrons are not allowed for recombination due to positively charged holes were utilized by the methanol [39]. Fig. 7 shows the effect of methanol concentration on the photocatalytic reformation of methanol to hydrogen over synthesized bulk TiO2 and PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials. When the water was used without any methanol as a feed, the H2 production is negligible, but increased with increase of the methanol concentration and reached to the maximum at 10 vol.% in case of all the synthesized catalysts. However, increase of methanol concentration beyond 10 vol.% resulted gradual decrease of H2 production. It is clear that both bulk TiO2 and PtOx-TiO2 anatase materials exhibited similar kind of behavior irrespective of TiO2 morphology. Dispersion of PtOx nanoparticles resulted significant improvement in the H2 production in three PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials samples with three different morphology. It was previously observed that when the methanol concentration increases, more methanol molecules adsorbs on the surface of TiO2 [40], consequently decrease of the photocatalytic reformation of methanol to H2 was observed as the decomposition efficiency of methanol decreases. Therefore, the optimum methanol concentration is existed for the synthesized catalysts and usage of methanol beyond the optimum value resulted decrease of photocatalytic performance of catalysts. Among all the synthesized materials, Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT (which contained nanotubes morphology) samples exhibited superior activity, 27 μmolg−1 and 1257 μmolg−1 respectively. In the present study, when the water was used without any methanol as a feed, the H2 production is negligible, but increased with increase of the methanol concentration and reached to the maximum at 10 vol.% in case of all the synthesized catalysts. However, increase of methanol concentration beyond 10 vol.% resulted gradual decrease of H2 production. Al-Mazroai et al. [41] reported that the catalyst maximizes H2 production rate, when the monolayer is adsorbed on the catalyst surface, as adsorbed methanol is a crucial for the reaction mechanism. Beyond the monolayer adsorption, an unreactive methanol leaves the photocatalyst surface. The observed results are in accordance with the literature findings. It is well known that electrostatic interactions between the semiconductor surface and the reactant molecules play an important role in catalyst performance. Therefore, role of pH of the aqueous methanol solution (in the range of 0–10) on the photocatalytic performance of bulk TiO2 and PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials was studied. The results are illustrated in Fig. 8 . From the figure, it is clear that tested catalysts offered superior activity at pH = 6.0, which is near to zero point charge (zpc) of TiO2 (≈6.25) [10]. Wu et al. [42] observed the highest rate of hydrogen production at neutral pH (around 7). These authors reported that increase or decrease of pH of the solutions resulted decrease in hydrogen production rates. All the synthesized catalysts offered superior activity at pH = 6.0 mainly due to the fact that the hydroxyl (Ti–OH) groups presented on the surface of the semiconductor enables the adsorption of methanol molecules via hydrogen bonding [43]. The catalysts which have nanotube morphology were superior catalysts due to the fact that the Ti-A-NT and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalysts possessed more surface Ti–OH species and specific surface area (XPS and N2 adsorption results). Several decades ago, Kawai and Sakata [44] indicated that the methanol reformation progress stepwise, involving HCHO and HCOOH intermediates. In acidic solution, the rate of conversion of CH3OH to HCOOH is low, which leads to low H2 production as it was observed that HCOOH could easily dissociates into H‏+ and HCOO− ions, while it is very hard to ionize the CH3OH and HCHO. On other hand, in basic solution, HCOOH could easily oxidized to form CO2 due to deprotonation. Moreover, the pH of the solution also influences the surface state of TiO2. It is known that TiO2 is normally amphoteric. The increase and decrease of pH value of the aqueous methanol solution results change in the surface acidity-basicity characteristics of TiO2, which influence the CH3OH adsorption. In basic solution, the negatively charged TiO2 surface resulted lower the rate of H2 production due to interaction between methanol and TiO2 is lower [3]. Fig. 9 displays the effect of mass of photocatalyst on the photocatalytic reformation of methanol to H2 over 2.0PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials using 10 vol.% methanol solution at pH = 6.0. The hydrogen production increased with increase of the catalyst amount up to 150 mg, however further increase of the catalyst amount resulted decline in catalytic performance. Therefore, it appears that 150 mg is the optimum catalyst amount in PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials samples. It appears that beyond the optimum amount of catalyst, the quantity of active centers on surface of the catalyst become constant. There are other possibilities that increase of mass of catalyst could have decreased penetration of light and increased the light scattering. The loss of surface area could also possible due to agglomeration of catalyst particles at high solid concentration [45]. It is well known that the photocatalytic reforming of methanol takes place at the interface between the metal and surface of semiconductor. Thus, the lack of active sites could decrease the efficiency of photocatalyst, when a small amount of catalyst is used. The hydrogen production increased with increase of the catalyst amount up to 150 mg, however further increase of the catalyst amount resulted decline in catalytic performance. Therefore, it appears that 150 mg is the optimum catalyst amount in PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials samples. It appears that beyond the optimum amount of catalyst, the quantity of active centers on surface of the catalyst become constant. There are other possibilities that increase of mass of catalyst above the optimum loading could have decreased penetration of light and scatter the incident light from reaching the catalysts surface. Kisch et al. [46] indicated that the optimum amount of synthesized TiO2 catalyst is in the range of 0.5–3.0 gL-1. The observed results are in coincides with the literature reports. The observed photocatalytic activity data clearly indicating that Pt deposited TiO2 anatase nanomaterials are superior catalysts compared to bulk TiO2 materials. In case of 2.0PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterials, PtOx accepts the photogenerated electron from CB of TiO2 to extend the lifetime of the charge carrier. The synthesized nanomaterials were tested for time on stream analysis for photocatalytic reforming of methanol and the results are shown in Fig. 10 (A) . The figure shows the amount of hydrogen produced under optimized reaction conditions over all the samples. The highest amount of hydrogen was produced after 300 min of reaction in case of all Pt deposited TiO2 anatase samples and 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample exhibited the best activity among the synthesized samples. It is clear that after 300 min of reaction, the activity of catalysts was not changed considerably, which could be due to the establishment of equilibrium. Further, the influence of reaction temperature on the photocatalytic methanol reforming reaction using synthesized nanomaterials catalysts was studied between 30 °C and 60 °C [Fig. 10 (B)]. As presented in the figure, increase of temperature from 30 °C to 50 °C caused an increase in generation of hydrogen. However, further increase of reaction temperature to 60 °C resulted the decrease of hydrogen production in case of all the Pt deposited TiO2 anatase nanomaterials. Previously, Korzhak et al. [47] tested Cu–TiO2 nanocomposite catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production and the authors observed that the quantum yield is proportional to the reaction temperature; as it has a great influence over the quantum yield, most probably because of the thermal activation of products desorption. It is clear that the results observed in this research are dissimilar from those reported by Korzhak et al. [47]. The observed decline in hydrogen production beyond 50 °C could be due to the decrease of adsorption of methanol molecules over surface of the catalyst. The photocatalytic stability of the representative (most active) 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample was performed. It is well known that studying the photocatalytic stability is an important aspect due to the fact that the catalysts normally endure photo-corrosion during to catalytic reaction. For the reusability study, we filtered the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalyst after the first cycle of the reaction, washed, dried, and heated at 100 °C for 1 h and used it for next cycle of the reaction. The recycled catalyst was used for five cycles and the obtained results were plotted in Fig. 11 . The 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalyst exhibited photocatalytic performance for H2 production without considerable loss of activity. The recyclability of 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalyst could be attributed to structural stability the high resistance to photo-corrosion under investigated reaction conditions. In order to understand the photocatalytic reformation of aqueous methanol over synthesized PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials, a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of present results and literature observations [48] and it is shown in Scheme 1 . In the beginning of the reaction, the methanol molecule abstracts lattice oxygen from PtOx to activate the metal surface and that the process is mediated by the photo-generated electron (e −) and hole (h +). Reduction of PtOx could takes place via abstraction of lattice oxygen by methanol or by ∗OH radicals produced during light excitation. It was also proposed that the photo-generated h + species react with methanol molecule to generate formaldehyde and it was then oxidized by both ∗OH radicals and h + species to convert formaldehyde into formic acid [49]. The formic acid could decompose into CO2 and H+ or CO and H2O; the product analysis during activity studies indicated the presence of CO2 in the reaction products. Therefore, the formic acid was decomposed into CO2 and 2H+ species. It is clear from the characterization data that the PtOx particles are dispersed and in intimate contact with the TiO2 surface. When the catalyst is exposed to visible light irradiation, the photogenerated e − generally moves to the CB from VB of TiO2, and then electrons transfer to the neighboring PtOx particles [50]. It was previously reported that the interface of metal and semiconductor could act as Schotkky diode under the reaction conditions; thus the PtOx-TiO2 nanomaterial could exhibit more effective electron–acceptor properties. In the final step, the formed H+ ions rearranges into H2 molecules over metal particles. Many researchers used Pt incorporated semiconductor materials as photocatalysts and found the catalysts are very efficient. For instance, Li et al. reported optimal photocatalytic hydrogen production over PtO [51], whereas Xing and co-workers proposed that electron-deficient Ptδ+ species are more active compared to Pt clusters [52]. In another report, Jiang et al. [53] indicated that metallic Pt is more efficient cocatalyst in photocatalytic H2 production. These authors reported that photocatalytic H2 evolution is directly proportional to the surface concentration of Pt metal. Moreover, few literature reports revealed that Pt oxide could undergo reduction to Pt metal under illumination (charge carrier generation in the semiconductor) and assist the reaction [51]. The trend of rate of H2 production is characterized by an initial gradual increase followed by a plateau [Fig. 10 (A)]. The gradual increase in the H2 production rate in the initial period can be explained by the fact that in situ progressive formation of catalytically active sites such as Pt metal particles. The XPS characterization of the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalyst (Fig. S4) after several cycles of the photocatalytic reaction provided the evidence for in situ reduction of Pt oxides into Pt metal during the photocatalytic reforming of methanol. A similar observation was reported in a previous study [54]. It is also interesting to note that the spent 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample exhibited less Pt nanoparticles possibly due to leaching of Pt during reaction (Fig. S1). Table S3 shows comparison of the photocatalytic performance of synthesized catalysts with some related works. It is clear that the H2 production rates are higher in case of previously reported Pt–TiO2 catalysts compared to 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT catalysts in the present work. The Pt/PtO-hierarchically meso-macroporous TiO2 and the mesoporous Pt–TiO2-AC photocatalysts demonstrates the highest photocatalytic H2 rates. However, it is important to note that the physico-chemical characteristics of these catalysts and reactions conditions are different from the present work. Moreover, the present research is aimed to analyze the influence of TiO2 morphology in synthesized PtOx-TiO2 anatase catalysts for photocatalytic reformation of methanol to hydrogen. It is well reported that interaction between Pt species and metal oxide support could greatly influence the catalyst's physico-chemical characteristics including electronic properties, enabling distinctive prospects to modify catalyst's performance [31]. It was also observed that interaction between TiO2 and Pt involves the electron transfer, which can efficiently stabilize the dispersed Pt species in its oxidized state [13]. The results obtained from characterization techniques indicated that the Pt species are in oxidized state and a strong interaction was existed between oxidized Pt particles and the TiO2. Previously, it was also reported that usage of nano sized TiO2 crystallites could produce large amount of Pt–Ti interfacial sites [55]. Highly dispersed metal crystallites are well known to interact with reducible supports such as TiO2, thus the synthesized PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials exhibit better redox properties. In the present work, the photocatalytic hydrogen production is significantly higher in case of 2.0PtOx-TiO2 anatase nanomaterials than with bulk TiO2 anatase materials. The promotional effect of PtOx was previously explained on the basis of the energy levels of the Pt–TiO2 composite; the photo-generated electrons in CB of TiO2 could be transported and confined at the surface of PtOx nanoparticles [56]. This is mainly due to the energy level of the Fermi level of Pt is lower than the CB in TiO2, therefore, the photo-generated e − can become trapped relatively easily. It was also observed that the difference between the energy levels of CB of TiO2 and Fermi level of Pt was increased at the interface of TiO2 with Pt due to formation of Schottky barrier [57]. It is clear that interface contact area of TiO2 and PtOx components is more in case of 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample compared to other two samples. The large Schottky barrier could be assisting to trap the photo-generated e − and prolonging the lifetime of the trapped e −, thus enhancing the photo catalytic activity. The synthesized TiO2 anatase NTs could also enable higher control of the physico-chemical characterstics, as compared with TiO2 anatase NPs and NFs. Moreover, the hollow structure of one dimensional TiO2 anatase NTs is responsible for their unique physical structure and exceptional chemical characteristics, as 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample possessed high Pt dispersion and exhibited high surface area, pore volume and pore diameter with an open mesoporous morphology, which could assist for adsorption of reactant molecules on the active sites. Li et al. [58] indicated that interaction between Pt and the TiO2 semiconductor occurred during preparation, which resulted the formation of Ti3+ species. The XPS results clearly indicated that 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT sample possessed more surface Ti3+ species, thus, indicating that this catalyst possessed more oxygen deficient species and O2− anions, which could also effectively prevent e −-h + recombination [59]. Farghali et al. [60] reported that the morphology of TiO2 play an important role in a photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. In another report, Rashad et al. [61] utilized nanosheets, nanotubes and nanowires of TiO2 semiconductor for photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet and found that all morphologies displayed different degradation efficiencies, where the TiO2 NTs exhibited superior degradation efficiency. More importantly, TiO2 NTs normally possesses significantly fast and long-distance electron-transport and enhanced light absorption ability due to high ratio of length to pore diameter, both contribute to improve photocatalytic efficiency [62]."
6,Conclusions,"In conclusion, PtOx (2.0 wt.%) species were deposited over TiO2 anatase with nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanofibers morphology and the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials were tested for hydrogen production from aqueous methanol reforming. To optimize the reaction conditions, several parameters such as methanol concentration, mass of the catalyst, pH of the solution and reaction temperature and time were studied. Among the synthesized 2.0 Pt–TiO2 anatase nanomaterials showed that the 2.0 Pt–Ti-A-NT (nanotubes) sample exhibited the highest photo catalytic activity for hydrogen generation; a promising hydrogen quantity of 1489 μmolg−1 was observed at 50 °C after 3 h. This result suggests that the morphology of TiO2 anatase semiconductor played an important role. The unique physico-chemical characteristics of the TiO2 anatase nanotubes are responsible for the superior photocatalytic activity; with prominent synergetic effect, high surface area, large pore size, presence of PtOx and the tube morphology of the TiO2 anatase semiconductor. The interaction between the TiO2 anatase nanotube and PtOx nanoparticles leading to high dispersion of PtOx nanoparticles, decreasing the band gap energy, increasing electron storage and diminishing of the recombination of photo-generated e − and h +, which are greatly enhanced the photocatalytic production of hydrogen."
