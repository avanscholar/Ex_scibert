0,Introduction,"Anaerobic biotechnology presents enormous potential to produce bioenergy and platform chemicals from waste biomass to cope with the upcoming fossil fuel depletion (Bao et al., 2019a; Wu et al., 2016). Among the diversified anaerobic products, lactate is mainly produced from carbohydrate-rich wastes such as municipal wastewater, food industry wastewater, food waste, acid whey, etc. (Bao et al., 2019b; Duber et al., 2018; Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht, 2007; Kucek et al., 2016a; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). Although the production cost of lactate from waste biomass by anaerobic fermentation is relatively low, the complete miscibility of lactate and fermentation broth make its subsequent separation/extraction process (crystallization separation, esterification separation or molecular distillation) very expensive, thus largely limiting its exploitability. For example, lactate produced by waste biomass is mostly utilized in the places with low purity requirement, such as adding into wastewater treatment plant as carbon source. Recent studies introduced a more valuable lactate utilization approach, i.e., upgrading lactate (as an electron donor (ED)) into medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) by an emerging bio-refinery technology of chain elongation (CE) basing on reverse β oxidation pathway (Agler et al., 2012; Kucek et al., 2016a; Steinbusch et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2015). MCCAs are straight chain mono-carboxylates with 6–12 carbon atoms, mainly including caproate, heptylate, caprylate, etc (Wu et al., 2019). In contrast with the entirely miscible lactate, the solubilities of caproate, heptylate, and caprylate in water are as low as 10.82, 2.42, and 0.68 g/L, respectively (Xu et al., 2018), which means they can be separated from fermentation broth as oily fluid once the required concentrations are reached without expensive energy and chemicals inputs. Besides, upgrading lactate into MCCAs also further increases the energy harvest from the waste biomass. As for the subsequent use, MCCAs can be more efficiently processed into biofuels and industrial chemicals since it has lower oxygen/carbon ratio and higher energy density than lactate (Xu et al., 2015), or directly used as antimicrobial agents (Desbois, 2012) and food additive (Xu et al., 2015). Therefore, producing high-value and easy-separation MCCAs may be an economic viable proposition for lactate utilization, especially for the lactate that produced from (or existed in) complex wastes. To achieve large-scale application of this process, the high lactate utilization efficiency and MCCAs yield are primarily demanded. However, when lactate is used as an ED, except for the CE pathway, there is another competing acrylate pathway directing the lactate-carbon flow toward propionate, and thus decreasing MCCAs yield (Kucek et al., 2016a; Prabhu et al., 2012). Kucek et al. (2016a) proposed that a low residual lactate concentration (near zero), operation pH near 5.0, and in-line products extraction were necessary to prevent this competing reaction. Comparing with this conventional wisdom of inhibiting carbon flow dispersion, reutilizing the dispersed carbon flow of propionate to produce MCCAs might be an alternative strategy to concentrate lactate-carbon flow on MCCAs production during unstable or not optimal conditions. In general, this strategy could be achieved through two potential approaches. One is to directly elongate propionate into heptylate. The maximum heptylate selectivity so far by elongating propionate was only 23% because of the large generation of propanol, caproate, and valerate (Grootscholten et al., 2013). Another approach is to reduce propionate into propanol, which could be utilized as an ED in the CE process (Coma et al., 2016; Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). However, the biological reduction of propionate into propanol at standard condition (ΔG = −9.4 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically infeasible since the minimal energy quantity for the microbial reduction of short chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs) is −15 to −20 kJ/mol (Schink, 1997). According to Steinbusch et al. (2008), an elevated Hydrogen (H2) partial pressure resulted in a more negative Δ G r ′ G for SCCAs reduction, and thus properly supplementing H2 enabled the reduction of propionate into propanol. However, the conversion efficiency of propionate into propanol was only ∼50.3%, which was attributed to the generation of large numbers of byproduct CH4 (consuming ∼33.6% SCCA and H2) (Steinbusch et al., 2008). Thus, methanation inhibition is significant for efficient reduction of propionate to achieve further utilization of this dispersive lactate-carbon flow. In addition to acrylate pathway, there is another considerable and unavoidable dispersion of lactate-carbon flow in the CE process: a third of the carbon in pyruvate (product of lactate oxidation) is released as CO2 at the step of pyruvate oxidization into acetyl-CoA. If H2 is supplemented, H2 could also react with the CO2 to produce acetate and ethanol through homoacetogenesis and acetate reduction reactions, respectively (Zhang et al., 2013). The in situ formed acetate and ethanol could be sequentially converted into MCCAs by CE process (Angenent et al., 2016). Therefore, appropriate H2 supply might play a dual role in reusing the dispersive lactate-carbon flow to enhance MCCAs yield. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to (1) verify the feasibility of enhancing MCCAs yield from lactate by supplying H2; (2) reveal the corresponding mechanism by investigating the effects of H2 on electron efficiency and electron transfer capacity, role of H2, and conversion pathways of dispersive lactate-carbon flow; and (3) explore the key microorganism and their functions in the H2-supplemented reactor. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to reveal the effect of H2 on lactate-guided CE process and the related mechanism. Moreover, the proposed approach to reutilize the dispersed lactate-carbon flow for MCCAs production differed from the traditional way of inhibiting lactate-carbon flow dispersion, which might inspire researchers to enhance MCCAs production performance from another perspective or during times when unstable conditions prevailed. It also should be pointed out that it would always be more efficient to prevent the acrylate pathway from occurring in the first place."
1,Materials and methods,
2,The inoculum and medium,"2.1 The inoculum and medium The inoculum was the mixtures of excess sludge and pit-mud. The excess sludge came from the secondary sedimentation tank of Wenchang sewage treatment plant (Harbin, China). The pit-mud was taken from a brewing fermentation pit of strong-aroma type liquor distillery (Chengde, China). The experiment was conducted with synthetic medium, and ED and electron acceptor (EA) were added additionally based on specific experimental objectives. The composition of synthetic medium referred to Zhu et al. (2015)."
3,Effects of H2 supply on MCCAs production from lactate,"2.2 Effects of H2 supply on MCCAs production from lactate Seven sets of batch anaerobic reactors (1.5 L) labeled with R1–R7 were operated for MCCAs production. Each of them was filled with 100 mL inoculum and 900 mL medium, and the headspace volume was about 500 mL. The media of R2–R7 contained 100 mM lactate and 33.3 mM acetate, while the medium of R1 was not added any organic carbon sources. 10 g/L 2-bromoethanosulfonic acid (2-BES) was added into the seven reactors to suppress methanogenesis, and the pH was adjusted at 7.0 ± 0.1. R1 and R2 were purged with nitrogen gas (99.9%) for 5 min to ensure anaerobic conditions. R3 was purged with high purity H2 for 5 min and then kept a final H2 pressure of 1.5 bar in the headspace. R4, R5, R6 and R7 were continuously flushed with H2 with the small pore size spargers at the loads of 1, 3, 5 and 7 c through mass-flow controllers (Dwyer, USA), respectively. The exhaust gas was collected with drainage. These tests were operated in triplicates and stirred in an air-bath shaker (35 ± 1 °C, 150 rpm). To explore whether H2 was involved in the reaction and calculate the H2 consumption accurately, R3 were not sampled until the end of the run (30 days)."
4,Pathways to enhance MCCAs production from lactate under H2 supply,"2.3 Pathways to enhance MCCAs production from lactate under H2 supply The test was performed in six sets of anaerobic reactors (#1–#6) with three replicate in each set. All the reactors were fed with the same medium and inoculum as in Section 2.2. Then, 100 mM propionate (#1), 50 mM propanol and 50 mM acetate (#2), 50 mM propanol and 50 mM propionate (#3), 50 mM propanol and 50 mM lactate (#4), and 33.3 mM propionate and 50 mM lactate (#5) were added to these reactors, respectively. H2 loading rate of 5 L H 2 / L · d was applied into reactors #1–#5. CO2 and H2 with a molar ratio of 1:1 and total pressure of 1.5 bar were fed into the reactor #6 which did not contain other substrates. Other operation conditions were the same as in Section 2.2."
5,Electron equivalent balance,"2.4 Electron equivalent balance Electron equivalent balance was used to analyze the efficiency of electron conversion in the CE process, which was expressed in electron equivalent (mol e). All the involved compounds and their electrons are (mole electrons/mol compound): 12/ethanol, 18/propanol, 24/butanol, 12/lactate, 2/H2, 8/methane, 8/acetate, 14/propionate, 20/butyrate, 26/valerate, 32/caproate, 38/heptylate, 44/caprylate. Total electron equivalent in the whole reaction process is invariable, which is the sum of electron equivalents in the substrate ( e s i ), products ( e p j ) (including SCCAs, MCCAs, alcohols and methane) and inoculum ( e ino ) (Steinbusch et al., 2008). (1) e T = ∑ i = 1 m e s i 0 + e ino 0 = ∑ i = 1 m e s i t + ∑ j = 1 n e p j t + e ino t (2) Δ e ino = - ∑ i = 1 m Δ e s i t - ∑ j = 1 n e p j t Eq. (2) is derived from Eq. (1), which means the change of inoculum electron equivalent is equal to the electron equivalent changes in substrate and product. Both the added substrates and the inoculum (sludge and pit mud) degradation contributed to MCCAs generation. Thus the electron equivalents in MCCAs can be presented as Eq. (3). (3) Δ e p i = ∑ j = 1 n α i Δ e s j + β i Δ e ino 0 ≤ α i ≤ 1 ; 0 ≤ β i ≤ 1 where α i and β i were the respective proportions of electron equivalent contribution in substrate and inoculum for MCCAs generation. β i was calculated from the electron equivalents of products in reactor R1 (Eq. (4)) due to the inoculum being the only carbon source for MCCAs production in R1. (4) β i = Δ e p j Δ e ino Based on electron balance, electron efficiency was defined as the percentage of electron equivalents of consumed substrate that was converted into MCCAs (Eq. (5)), indicating the percentage of substrates conversion into MCCAs. (5) Electron efficiency = Δ e p i - β i Δ e ino ∑ j = 1 n Δ e s j × 100 %"
6,Electron transfer efficiency,"2.5 Electron transfer efficiency The measurement methods of Electron transfer efficiency includes electron accepting capacity (EAC) and electron donating capacity (EDC) referred to He et al. (2014). Both EAC and EDC were determined on an electrochemistry workstation (Chenhua CHI760D, Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode system. The Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and the stainless steel nets were used as working electrode and counter electrode. 50 mL fermentation broth was transferred into the electrochemical cell, and the amperometric i−t curves were measured for 5 min under the positive potential of + 0.6 V and negative potential of −0.6 V, respectively. The EDC and EAC were calculated according to Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively. (6) EAC = A p - e × N A × M C (7) EDC = A p + e × N A × M C where the values of A p (−) and A p (+) are the coulomb integrals of i−t curves obtained from negative potential of −0.6 V and positive potential of +0.6 V, respectively. e is the charge of an electron (1.6 × 10−19 C). NA is the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol−1). MC refers to the amount of carbon transferred to the electrochemical cell (2 × 10−4 g)."
7,Microbial community identification,"2.6 Microbial community identification After the experiment of Section 2.2, the microbiome samples of R2 (without H2 addition) and R6 (under H2 addition) were collected at day 30, and their genomic DNA were extracted with Z.N.A™ Mag-Bind Soil DNA Kit (Omega Biotek., USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Sequencing were performed at an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform at Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods The alcohols (ethanol, propanol and butanol), SCCAs, and MCCAs were measured using a chromatography (GC) (7890, Agilent Technologies, USA), which was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP innowax column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 1 μm). Lactate was measured by a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system equipped with an HSS T3 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm, Waters). Gas compositions (H2, methane, and CO2) were determined by a GC (7890, Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of H2 supply on lactate-guided CE process,"3.1 Effect of H2 supply on lactate-guided CE process 3.1.1 H2 supply promoted substrate conversion to MCCAs The concentration changes of substrates and products in R2 (without H2 supply), R3 (with 1.5 bar H2 pressure), and R4–R7 (with continuous H2 influx) are compared to investigate the effects of H2 on CE performance when lactate is used as ED (Table 1 ). The utilization ratios of lactate and acetate in R3–R7 were 87.22%–93.17% and 87.64%–98.35%, respectively, which were higher than those in R2 (∼86.43% and ∼83.85%, respectively). Besides, almost all of the SCCAs concentrations in R3–R7 were lower but all of the MCCAs concentrations in R3–R7 were higher than those in R2. It was suggested that H2 supply could facilitate the conversion of substrates (lactate and acetate) and intermediates (SCCAs) into MCCAs indirectly. Among those tests, the highest MCCAs concentration of 33.62 ± 4.52 mM was obtained in reactor R6 (with a H2 loading rate of 5 L H 2 / L · d which was about 1.65 times compared to the non-H2-supplemented reactor R2, followed by reactor R3 (31.23 ± 2.98 mM), suggesting both continuous H2 influx and elevated H2 pressure could enhance MCCAs production performance indirectly. However, it was worth noting that continuous H2 influx might waste more H2 due to the low solubility of H2 in the water phase (about 1.6 mg/L at 1 atm H2 and 298 K) (Rittmann, 2007), and thus the methods for enhancing H2 utilization efficiency need to be investigated in the future. Besides, MCCAs concentration was not proportional to H2 loading rate, which did not improve with the increase of H2 loading rate from 5 L H 2 / L · d (R6) to 7 L H 2 / L · d (R7). It was also found that more lactate was left in R7 than that in R3–R6, which might be related to excessive H2 input. 3.1.2 H2 supply enhanced caproate and heptylate productions As shown in Table 1, comparing with R2, H2 supply (R3–R7) improved caproate and heptylate productions to varying degrees, while it slightly affected caprylate generation. In particular, when 5 L H 2 / L · d of H2 was input into R6, caproate concentration was increased by about 44%, and heptylate concentration (9.63 ± 0.49 mM) were about 3 times of that in R2 (3.16 ± 0.68 mM). In addition, propionate concentrations also showed great differences between the non-H2-supplemented and H2-supplemented reactors. Except for reactor R4 (a low H2 loading rate of 1 L H 2 / L · d , the propionate concentrations in other four H2-supplemented reactors was more than 2 times lower than R2. Propionate concentration in R6 (1.36 ± 0.33 mM) was even less than one-tenth of R2 (16.83 ± 1.22 mM). The high propionate concentration in R2 was derived from the competing acrylate pathway (Kucek et al., 2016a). Considering the significantly higher heptylate and caproate concentrations observed in R3–R7 than that in R2, the much lower propionate concentration in R3–R7 might be ascribed to the further elongation/conversion of propionate to heptylate and caproate rather than the absent acrylate pathway, and this conjecture will be verified in Section 3.3. Additionally, in the H2-supplemented reactors, small amounts of alcohols including ethanol, propanol, and butanol were detected, which may have been generated from the reduction of corresponding SCCAs by H2 (Steinbusch et al., 2008). Slight methane was also detected, which could be derived from the hydrotrophic methanogens since hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis ( Δ G 35 ° C 0 = - 126.40 kJ / mol ) was more competitive than acetoclastic methanogenesis ( Δ G 35 ° C 0 = - 78.63 kJ / mol ) and 2-BES effectively inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis. It should be noted that 2-BES addition to suppress methanogenesis is not cost-effective from an economic proposition and thus cannot be scaled up. Weakly acidic pH would be more economically feasible for the large-scale MCCA production under the premise of in-time product extraction. To investigate the H2 consumption, headspace gas composition variations were analyzed, which mainly focused on R1–R3 since the gases in R4–R7 (with continuous H2 influx) cannot be quantified. By calculation, the required H2 for synthesizing alcohol and methane in R3 was less than 19.42 mM (assuming methane was only produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis), however, about 25.36 mM H2 was consumed (it was higher when considering the H2 generated from the CE process). Therefore, H2 might also be involved in MCCAs production process with an indirect effect (the possible pathways are revealed in Section 3.3). It is worth noting that H2 was once thought to be directly involved in the CE process as an electron donor (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013), however, this process was verified to be infeasible by a thermodynamic and kinetic analysis conducted by González-Cabaleiro et al. (2013)."
11,H2 improved electron efficiency and electron transfer capacity,"3.2 H2 improved electron efficiency and electron transfer capacity Fig. 1 (a) and (b) compare the differences of electron efficiencies and electron transfer capacities (electron accepting capacity (EAC) and electron donating capacity (EDC)) in the non-H2-supplemented and H2-supplemented CE reactors, respectively. Excluding the contribution of inoculum to the electron with Eq. (5), the electron efficiency in this study implied the extent to which electrons in substrate are recovered. It should be explained that since the H2 consumption in R4–R7 cannot be quantified, the electron efficiency obtained in R3 (H2 consumption was measured) was used to compare with that obtained in R2 (without H2 supply) to reveal the effects of H2 on electron utilization. The electron efficiency of total MCCAs in R2 was only 51.78 ± 4.11%, but it was improved to 74.42 ± 6.83% in R3. When exogenetic H2 was supplied, more electrons from substrates flowed into caproate and heptylate generations, which increased by about 5.00% and 16.66%, respectively. Meanwhile, much lower electrons were flowed into SCCAs generation (especially the propionate) under H2 supply comparing with the non-H2-supplemented test. It was indicated that appropriate H2 supply helped concentrate electron-flow on MCCAs production instead of other metabolic pathways. CE process involved mediated interspecies electron transfer (with H as a carrier), thus the electron transfer capabilities including electron accepting capacity (EAC) and electron donating capacity (EDC) were measured to evaluate the effects of H2 on CE efficiency. From Fig. 1(b), the contributions of sole inoculum decay (R1) to EAC (265.03 ± 26.81 μmol/g C) and EDC (7.05 ± 2.54 μmol/g C) were negligible comparing with the reactors containing both ED and EA. In R2, the EDC was only 81.74 ± 7.26 μmol/g C which was about one thirtieth of EAC (2712.31 ± 154.24 μmol/g C), suggesting available ED might be largely depleted so that MCCAs production could not be further increased if no additional ED was supplemented. When exogenetic H2 was involved in the CE process, EDC were improved significantly, which also signified the improved CE performance. Among them, R7 achieved highest EDC (191.61 ± 15.26 μmol/g C, more than 2 times of that in R2), followed by R6 (187.62 ± 14.77 μmol/g C). However, EAC in R2–R7 showed slight changes. This phenomenon was reasonable since both SCCAs and MCCAs affected EAC, and their total concentrations in those reactors were similar. However, EDC could only be affected by the substances that acted as ED (He et al., 2014). As mentioned above, the residual lactate (ED) concentrations in R3–R7 were lower than that in R2, thus the higher EDC in R3–R7 suggested H2 supply might bring about additional generation of available ED. The observed alcohols (the effective EDs) including ethanol, propanol, and butanol in the H2-supplemented reactors (Table 1) might support this speculation, which could be the reduction products of corresponding SCCAs under sufficient H2 (Steinbusch et al., 2008). Because of the insufficient H2 supply (low H2 loading rate of 1 L H 2 / L · d , R4 only obtained slight alcohols and meanwhile the lowest EDC among R3–R7. Therefore, the improved EDC might be directly related to the additional generation of alcohols. It is noteworthy that the alcohols concentration shown in Table 1 could not be all of the generated alcohols as part of them might have been utilized."
12,Pathway for enhancing MCCAs production from lactate by H2 supply,"3.3 Pathway for enhancing MCCAs production from lactate by H2 supply 3.3.1 H2 facilitated the conversion of propionate into caproate and heptylate Acrylate pathway was the primary competition reaction dispersing lactate-carbon flow and reducing MCCAs yield in the lactate-guided CE process (Kucek et al., 2016a; Wu et al., 2018). Propionate as the product of acrylate pathway could not be efficiently elongated into heptylate due to the large formations of byproducts, including propanol, caproate, and valerate. The highest heptylate yield from propionate so far was only 23% (Grootscholten et al., 2013). Based on the analysis at Section 3.2, H2 might facilitate the conversion of propionate to heptylate and caproate. To verify it, the possible conversion pathway of propionate and role of H2 were investigated in this section. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), in the reactors (#1) fed with sole carbon source of propionate and continuous H2, propionate concentration decreased gradually along with the increase of propanol concentration, indicating propionate was likely reduced by H2 to propanol. Thus, under the same operating conditions with #1, the propionate produced from acrylate pathway in R3–R7 could also be reduced into propanol. However, much lower propanol concentrations were detected in the final fermentation broth of R3–R7. It was thereby speculated that the generated propanol might be further utilized since it was also an available ED for CE process. To reveal the possible utilization pathways of propanol, three same reactors with continuous H2 input at a loading rate of 5 L H 2 / L · d were carried out with propanol and acetate (#2), propanol and propionate (#3), and propanol and lactate (#4) as substrates, respectively. It was found that the main products from substrates of propanol and acetate were heptylate and valerate (Fig. 2(b)), which could be produced by the acetate elongation with ED of propanol (Eqs. (8) and (9)) (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). When propanol and propionate were used as substrates (Fig. 2(c)), caproate was detected as the primary product, which was likely derived from the propionate elongation with propanol (Eq. (10) (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). When propanol and lactate were utilized (Fig. 2(d)), several products including caproate, heptylate, propionate, butyrate, and acetate were observed. The primary product of caproate could be generated from lactate upgrading (Eq. (11)) (Zhu et al., 2015) and propionate elongation with propanol (Eq. (10)). Furthermore, the rates of these side reactions were calculated and compared. The propanol production rate obtained from propionate reduction was about 2700 mg/(L·d), which was much higher than the production rate of 500–1200 mg/(L·d) reported by Roghair et al. (2018). In their study, propanol was formed through the reaction of propionate and H2 that was released from ethanol (Roghair et al., 2018). In addition, the propanol production rate was as low as 17 mg/(L·d) in an earlier study (Steinbusch et al., 2008), which maintained lower H2 pressure than this study. Therefore, sufficient H2 supply could effectively accelerate the reduction of propionate to propanol. The production rates of heptylate and caproate from propanol and acetate, and propanol and propionate were about 60.67 and 61.87 mg/(L·d), respectively. The much higher production rate of propanol than that of heptylate and caproate means that the reduction of propionate into propanol is not a limiting step for subsequent CE process when abundant H2 is supplied. Therefore, propanol was indeed an important intermediate for the conversion of propionate to caproate and heptylate under H2 supply. In addition, this study also investigated if propionate could be elongated into heptylate with lactate as an ED since propionate could not be reduced to propanol completely. Reactors #5 that fed with propionate and lactate was carried out to compare the products with reactor #2. From Fig. 2(b) and (e), the heptylate concentration obtained in #5 was negligible and was significantly lower than that obtained in #2. Consequently, under sufficient H2, the main pathway to utilize the propionate that produced from acrylate pathway could be first the reduction of propionate into propanol with H2 and then the elongation of acetate and propionate with the in situ generated propanol into heptylate and caproate, respectively. The direct elongation of propionate only contributed to below a third of the total heptylate production. Besides, it is noteworthy that not only the propionate but the acetate would be partly reduced into ethanol as well (Steinbusch et al., 2008). The in situ formed ethanol could be effectively converted into caproate and caprylate by (1) elongating the existing acetate, and (2) upgrading ethanol (a combination of ethanol oxidation into acetate and succeeding elongation of this acetate) (Roghair et al., 2018). Comparing with the non-H2-supplemented test, the available acetyl-CoA concentration under H2 supply was higher due to the additional ethanol generation, which also explained the reason of higher elongation ratio of SCCAs in the H2-supplemented reactors of R3–R7.

As shown in Fig. 2(f), after 30 days fermentation, the H2 and CO2 were consumed by 18.12 ± 1.46 mM and 9.59 ± 1.34 mM, respectively. Excluding the contributions from inoculum decay, acetate, ethanol, and butyrate with the concentrations of 1.92 ± 0.37 mM (∼3.84 mg/(L·d)), 1.02 ± 0.11 mM (∼1.56 mg/(L·d)), and 0.76 ± 0.13 mM (∼2.23 mg/(L·d)) were obtained, respectively. Previously, Zhang et al. (2013) obtained higher acetate (123.33 mM) and butyrate (11.14 mM) concentrations than this study by using a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor with continuous supply of H2 and CO2. Thus, continuous/sufficient H2 and CO2 could contribute to more efficient production of SCCA and subsequent alcohol. The detected acetate and ethanol could be successively produced by homoacetogenesis reaction (Eq. (12)) and acetate reduction (Eq. (13)), respectively, and then the in situ generated acetate and ethanol could be further converted to butyrate and caproate by CE process (Eqs. (14) and (15)) (Coma et al., 2016). In this case, it was reasonable that much more CO2 than H2 was left in the headspace since the initial molar ratio of H2 to CO2 of 1:1 was lower than the required stoichiometric ratios for homoacetogenesis (Eq. (12)) and acetate reduction (Eq. (13)). In addition, it was also found by detecting the contents of headspace gas in reactors R2 and R3 that a lot of CO2 was obtained in R2, while only slight amount of CO2 was detected in R3 and most of the injected H2 was consumed. Combining with above analysis, the large amounts of CO2 released from lactate-guided CE process could react with added H2 to produce acetate and ethanol, which then further contributed to MCCAs generation. In conclusion, the pathways for enhancing MCCAs yield by H2 supply were mainly (1) H2 reduced propionate (the main dispersive lactate-carbon flow from the competing acrylate pathway) into propanol which then as an ED elongated acetate and propionate to heptylate and caproate, respectively; (2) H2 reacted with CO2 (another dispersive lactate-carbon flow) to form acetate and ethanol successively, then the in situ generated acetate and ethanol were utilized as EA and ED for caproate and caprylate productions. The proposed conversion pathways are shown in Fig. 3 .

13,H2 concentrated lactate-carbon flow on MCCAs production,"3.4 H2 concentrated lactate-carbon flow on MCCAs production Based on the proposed lactate conversion pathways under H2 supply, the differences of lactate-carbon flow distributions in the non-H2-supplemented and H2-supplemented CE reactors are shown in Fig. 4 , which were graphed by calculating the substrate consumption and net production in each route from tests R2, R6, and #1–#6 (the contributions of acetate to carbon flow in R2 and R6 were excluded). In our study, the lactate-carbon flowed to MCCAs was only ∼43.5% (∼36.1% for caproate and caprylate, and ∼7.4% for heptylate) without H2 supply (Fig. 4a), which was improved to ∼71.9% (enhanced by ∼28.4%) when appropriate H2 was supplied (Fig. 4b). For the first dispersed lactate-carbon flow of propionate, except for the existing route of propionate elongation to heptylate with ED of lactate (∼7.4% lactate-carbon), H2 supply also helped convert additional ∼16% propionate to caproate and heptylate with propanol as intermediate. In the second dispersed lactate-carbon flow of CO2 (∼25.1% lactate-carbon), H2 supply recovered ∼12.4% lactate-carbon to produce caproate and caprylate. Therefore, comparing with the considerable waste of lactate-carbon flow in the non-H2-supplemented CE process, appropriate H2 supply effectively concentrated lactate-carbon flow on MCCAs production by reutilizing the dispersed lactate-carbon flow."
14,H2 supply differentiated the microbial community,"3.5 H2 supply differentiated the microbial community Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences at phylum, class, and genus levels with and without H2 supply were compared to reveal the key microbial taxa contributing to high MCCAs yield under H2 supply (Fig. 5 ). Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the four main phyla detected in the two microbiome samples. Bacteroidetes was positively related to caproate production from lactate (Kucek et al., 2016a) and was also the primary phylum (25.33%) in the non-H2-supplemented reactor. In contrast, Firmicutes, which contained abundant CE functional microorganisms (Agler et al., 2012; Angenent et al., 2016), dominated the microbiome in the H2-supplemented reactor (44.03%) and far exceeded the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (17.47%). More in-depth analyses were conducted by combining class and genus levels. In this study, phylum Proteobacteria mainly consisted of four classes Alphaproteobacteria, Bataproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria. Among them, Gammaproteobacteria was the primary class, which was also the only member that was more enriched in the H2-supplemented reactor. Besides, the relative abundance of its main genus Acinetobacter was also slightly higher under H2 supply (12.48%) than that without H2 supply (9.51%). Acinetobacter was previously detected as the dominant species for caproate production from lactate and butyrate (Kucek et al., 2016a), and thereby it could be committed to CE process. As for the classes and genera that belonged to phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, they occupied a large part of the microbiome in the non-H2-supplemented reactor but were not competitive in the H2-supplemented reactor, thus they were not the distinctive microbial taxa contributing to MCCAs production under H2 supply. Another main phylum Firmicutes consisted of three classes, including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Negativicutes. Clostridia was the primary class in both microbiomes, but its relative abundance in the H2-supplemented reactor (30.83%) was significantly higher comparing with the non-H2-supplemented reactor (17.11%). Thus, Clostridia might be one of the main microbial structure differences with and without H2 supply. 10 genera that affiliated to Clostridia were detected, including Clostridium III, Clostridium IV, Clostridium XIVa, Clostridium kluyveri, Clostridium sensu stricto, Clostridium scatologenes, Clostridium autoethanogenum, Clostridium ljungdahli, Intestinimonas, and Anaerotruncus. Among them, the non-H2-supplemented reactor was mainly enriched by Clostridium III, Clostridium IV, and C. sensu stricto. All the three genera were equipped with CE ability (Wu et al., 2018), especially the Clostridium IV, which even accounted for 79.07% of the total sequence in the lactate-guided CE process (Zhu et al., 2015) and was identified as the active caproate-producing functional microbes (Spirito et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2015). In our study, Clostridium IV could be initially introduced from the inoculum of pit-mud (Tao et al., 2017) and was then enriched to a higher relative abundance. In contrast to the non-H2-supplemented reactor, in addition to above mentioned three genera, another four Clostridium spp., i.e., C. kluyveri (1.17%), C. scatologenes (2.45%), C. autoethanogenum (3.66%), and C. ljungdahli (5.81%), were detected and enriched exclusively in the H2-supplemented reactor. Thus, these four Clostridium spp. are the main difference and the key microbes that distinguish the CE process with or without H2 supply. In the previous reports, C. scatologenes, C. autoethanogenum, and C. ljungdahli were found to be responsible for the generations of acetate and butyrate from H2 and CO2 (Hu et al., 2015; Steinbusch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013), which suggested the existence of homoacetogenesis reaction in this study. C. kluyveri was the best known strain for caproate production via CE with ED of ethanol (Agler et al., 2012; Steinbusch et al., 2011). Since these microbes are closely related to the generations of MCCA or its precursor, their enrichment could also contribute to the higher MCCA production under H2 supply. In addition, two genera of Oscillibacter and Lactobacillus affiliated to Bacilli were also more enriched in the H2-supplemented reactor. Oscillibacter had the ability to produce caproate and caprylate with ED of ethanol (Angenent et al., 2016; Kucek et al., 2016a; Kucek et al., 2016b). The enrichments of C. kluyveri and Oscillibacter under H2 supply indicated the formation of ethanol and its utilization for CE process. Lactobacillus indirectly contributed to caproate generation (Nzeteu et al., 2018). In summary, the main differences in microbial structure under H2 supply comparing with the non-H2-supply are the more enrichment (more species and higher abundance) of Clostridium spp., which could also be the key microbes contributing to higher MCCA production performance under H2 supply. These discriminating microbes in the H2-supplemented reactor also contributed to the proposed conversion pathways of dispersive lactate-carbon flow. Additionally, abundant lactate-utilizing CE bacteria like Clostridium IV, and Acinetobacter could be also the crucial contributors for the enhanced lactate utilization and MCCAs production efficiencies under H2 supply."
15,Implications to MCCAs production from waste biomass,"3.6 Implications to MCCAs production from waste biomass The outstanding features of high energy density, strong hydrophobicity, low production/separation costs, and versatility provide an opportunity for MCCAs to be an alternative biochemical to some fossil-fuel-based products. Since the precursors (ethanol, lactate, SCCAs, etc.) for MCCAs production are available in (or can be anaerobically produced from) various waste biomass, upgrading the affordable waste biomass into MCCAs is an economically and environmentally attractive recycling approach. So far, the lactate-rich organic wastes, including food waste (Bolaji and Dionisi, 2017; Nzeteu et al., 2018; Reddy et al., 2018), acid whey (Duber et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018), Chinese strong-flavor liquor wastewater (Wu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2015), etc., have been verified feasible feedstock for MCCAs production by open culture CE process. In order to suppress the acrylate pathway consuming lactate, Kucek et al. (2016a) proposed that maintaining a residual lactate concentration near zero by an in-line product extraction unit and operation pH near 5.0 is necessary. Other strategies aiming at inhibiting acrylate pathway or recovering its dispersive lactate-carbon is lacking. Moreover, another unavoidable lactate-carbon waste (in the form of CO2, occupying ∼25% of total carbon) from lactate oxidation step received even less attention. This work found that appropriate H2 supply could concentrate lactate on MCCAs production by reusing the dispersive lactate-carbon flow, and thus achieved a higher commercial value. The findings in this work could be applied to improve waste biomass-based MCCAs production efficiency. Considering the energy property and cost of H2, coupling a waste biomass-based H2 production reactor to CE reactor is more recommended comparing with the additional H2 supply. In addition, combining the H2 producing feedstock with lactate/carbohydrate-rich waste biomass as co-substrates is also a potential strategy, but this strategy needs to overcome a primary challenge, i.e., shaping the microbiome capable of simultaneously producing H2 and MCCAs and keeping the microbiome resistant. The optimal H2 dosage and way/conditions to effectively use H2 also remain to be investigated in the future. It is also worth noting that the MCCAs produced from lactate-guided CE process under H2 supply contains considerable heptylate. Therefore, with the special purpose for producing high-purified and high-yield caproate or caprylate, preventing the acrylate pathway with affordable and implementable method remains the preferred option."
16,Conclusions,"Appropriate H2 supply could indirectly enhance MCCAs yield from the lactate-guided CE process, which was achieved mainly by reutilizing the dispersive lactate-carbon-flow. Propionate, the product of acrylate pathway, could be reduced by H2 into propanol which contributed to heptylate and caproate generation. CO2, the unavoidable by-product from lactate-guided CE process, could react with H2 to produce CE substrates of acetate and ethanol firstly and then MCCAs. Moreover, H2 also improved electron efficiency and EDC during the CE process. Clostridium spp. were the discriminating microbes under H2 supplement. These findings provide a strategy for efficient MCCAs production from carbohydrate/ lactate-rich waste biomass."
