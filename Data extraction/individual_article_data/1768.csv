0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion resulting in biogas and fertilizers production is a well established biotechnological method used in practice for over a century for the treatment of waste-water and solid organic wastes [1]. At large scale biogas systems, bio-methane is used for combined heat and power production. At present more than 1300 vendors supplied systems operate throughout the world treating sewage sludge in anaerobic digestions systems. Fourteen sewage plants in New York City generate 10.2 billion cubic meters of methane annually. In Europe more than 125 Biogas Plants reprocessing cattle manure and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (separately or in combination) produce billions of cubic meters of bio-methane annually that is used for heat and power co-generation. This high volume fuel allows meeting energy needs of the plant and leaves a surplus of energy that can be subsequently sold. The stabilized residue is distributed to farmers, linked to the centralized biogas plants as soil conditioning and fertilizing [2]. Although methane fermentation is a well developed technology, co-production of hydrogen and methane in the course of anaerobic digestion of organic wastes nowadays is at the early stage of development. The actuality of hydrogen co-production from organic residues is increasing due to the demand for environmentally sound fuel-hydrogen that entails carbon neutrality for electricity generation. Electricity generation can be achieved using carbon neutral hydrogen fuel cells that convert chemical energy of hydrogen directly to electricity with 50–60% efficiency at all system scales [3]. Currently known biological hydrogen production processes are classified as direct biophotolysis, photo-fermentations, indirect biophotolysis and dark fermentation. Numerous publications have been reported on the groundwork for creating renewable hydrogen production systems through photobiological processes, performed by photoautotrophic and photoheterotropic microorganisms. In photoautotrophic hydrogen production, solar energy captured by the photo system of photoautotrophic organisms is used to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water (biophotolysis of water). The main drawback of the process is that oxygen produced simultaneously with H2 inhibits hydrogenase, which is extremely sensitive to oxygen. This fact sets a limit to the photochemical efficiency which, referring to literature data, does not exceed 1–5%. Another group of phototrophic microorganisms as photoheterotrophic bacteria also use captured solar energy and produce hydrogen from organic substrates like fatty acids. This process is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme which like hydrogenase is highly sensitive to oxygen and in addition is inhibited by ammonium ions. The maximum photochemical efficiency of photoheterotrophic hydrogen production calculated theoretically is approximately 10% on a full solar spectrum basis [4]. In contrast to phototrophic microorganisms, some species of anaerobic bacteria convert a large variety of carbohydrate sources to hydrogen, CO2 and volatile fatty acids and other products [5,6]. Since light is not required to provide additional energy, this process is termed to dark fermentation. However, in natural environments like compost, cattle manure, soil and MSW, hydrogen producing anaerobic bacteria coexist with methanogens which consume metabolic products of dark hydrogen fermentation including hydrogen and produce their own end product – methane. To overcome this drawback during mixed culture fermentations, two methods were applied: heat treatment at 90 °C for 20–30 min (so called “heat shock”) or chemical method involving the use of bromethanesulfonate or iodopropane that resulted in the methanogenesis inhibition at the lab-scale [7]. However it is evident that such approach cannot be used for large scale systems [8]. To obtain hydrogen as a sole product of fermentation at an industrial scale, decoupling of hydrogen production and methane formation should be achieved by using environmentally sound and low cost chemicals depressing methanogens in a way that hydrogen producers are not affected. Another important consideration for making hydrogen production economically viable from organic wastes with high content of lignocellulosic materials is the selection of microbial cultures capable to hydrolyze cellulose and ferment full spectrum of lignocellulosics derived sugars to hydrogen. As no single microbial culture with such combined abilities is known presently, research in this domain is based on the following approaches: (i) native cellulolytic strategy that involves development of a syntrophic microbial consortium comprising of naturally occurring cellulolytic and saccharolytic microorganisms with improved targeted end-product yield and high tolerance to fermentation products and inhibitors; and (ii) combining recombinant DNA technology and metabolic engineering with the aim to genetically modify an outstanding cellulase-producer that makes desired end-products like hydrogen, ethanol and volatile fatty acids in a way that mainly one of them is produced. The main impediment to the latter studies currently is the absence of a well–established gene transfer system for cellulolytic thermophiles [9]. Referring to publications, due to complex enzymatic system, thermophilic anaerobic bacteria - Clostridium thermocellum breaks down cellulose and hemicellulose and utilizes a number of different C6 sugars but not xylose to produce hydrogen, ethanol, acetate and carbon dioxide. The other anaerobic thermophile - Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum uses both hexose and pentose sugars to form the same end products as C. thermocellum. The latter organism utilizes also cellobiose faster than C. thermocellum, thus preventing buildup of this inhibitory and repressive disaccharide. Combination of C. thermocellum and C. thermosaccharolyticum forms closely associated syntrophic and very stable dual cultures [9]. The use of dual cultures of C. thermocellum and C. thermosaccharolyticum in dark fermentation is promising since a mixed bacterial environment within the bioreactor allows efficiently degrading cellulosic materials and converting cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis products into ethyl alcohol and fatty acids accompanied by production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [10,11]. Apart from the above mentioned, to improve digestibility of heavily biodegradable lignocellulosic materials contained in organic wastes like OFMSW, pretreatment resulting in the increase of cellulose surface area accessible to enzymes and with minimum formation of compounds that inhibit fermenting microorganisms is required [12,13]. The aim of this work was to develop economically viable two-stage anaerobic fermentation process for hydrogen and methane combined production from organic fraction of municipal solid wastes containing 35–37% of lignocellulosic materials. This paper describes: (i) syntrophic microbial consortium comprised of anaerobic thermophilic cellulolytic and saccharolytic bacteria of Clostridia sp. providing higher hydrogen production from cellulosic material over the hydrogen production in C. thermocellum monoculture fermentation; (ii) effect of freeze explosion method on the changes in lignocellulosics structure resulting in the increase of cellulosic materials digestibility; (iii) method for decoupling hydrogen and methane fermentations which is simple and easy in operation and requires less expenses compared to so called “heat shock” process; and (iv) optimum conditions for bio-methane production from metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation. The efficiency of OFMSW two-stage anaerobic digestion was assessed by comparing it to methane production in a single-stage process, which was run as control."

Strains of C. thermocellum GCD7, C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 and three strains of methanogenic bacteria - Methanoculleus thermophilicus GML1, Methanotrix GMK2 and Methanosarcina thermophila GMH7 were obtained from the Microbial Culture Collection of Durmishidze Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology (Tbilisi, Georgia). Mono- and co cultures of C. thermocellum GCD7 and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 were grown in modified GS-2 medium [14] of the following composition (g/l of double-distilled water): KH2PO4-0.4; K2HPO4·3H2O-0.4; NH4Cl-1.0; MgCl2·6H2O- 0.1; yeast extract- 0.2; NaHCO3-6.0; Na2S·9H2O- 0.25; and resazurine- 0.001. To 980 ml of the above described solution, vitamins’ and minerals’ solutions 10 ml each were added. Vitamins’ solution was composed of (mg/l) biotin-2.0; folic acid-2.0; pyridoxine hydrochloride-10; thiamine HCl-5.0; riboflavin-5.0; nicotinic acid-5.0; dl-calcium pantothenate-5.0; vitamin B12- 0.1; p-aminobenzoic acid-5.0; and lipoic acid-5.0.

For the growth of C. thermocellum in monoculture pretreated corn stalks was used as cellulosic substrate. Saccharolytic bacteria C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 was cultivated using cellobiose, glucose and xylose as the sole source of carbon and energy. Medium for methanogenic bacteria cultivation contained the following compounds (g/l of double-distilled water): NH4Cl- 0.31; MgCl2·2H2O-0.25; KCl- 0.30; KH2 PO4- 0.28; NaHCO3-1.0; Na2S- 0.05; CH3COONa- 5.0; 2 ml of the micro elements’ solution; 1 ml vitamins’ solution and resazurine 0.002 g/l. Mixed cultures of methane forming bacteria (M. thermophilicus GML1, Methanotrix GMK2 and M. thermophila GMH7) were grown in thermophilic conditions using ethyl alcohol, acetic acid and butyric acid with ratio 1:1.1:0.2 as the substrate. Agitation was kept constant at 50 rpm and pH was maintained at 7.2. All media except vitamins’ solution was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Vitamin’s solution was filter sterilized using a 0.22-μm-pore-size sterile filter (Millipore Filter Corp). Corn stalks were pretreated by freeze explosion method and milled to 0.5–1 mm size particles was used in studies regarding microbial hydrogen production from cellulosic substrate. Chemical composition of pretreated corn stalks was the following (dry mass basis): cellulose – 44.2%; glucose– 44.2 (% of cellulose); hemicellulose - 24.80%; xylose - 24.29 (% of hemicellulose), arabinose – 0.21 (% of hemicellulose), galactose – 0.12 (% of hemicellulose); mannose – 0.18 (% of hemicellulose); lignin – 14.47%; crude protein – 7.81%; soluble solids – 4.27%; ash – 4.45%. Experiments were performed in thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C) at pH 8.5 and 5.5 using 1 l working volume stirred batch bioreactor (New Brunswick Bioflo 300). To ensure an anaerobic environment, bioreactor was flushed with nitrogen of high purity. Volume of produced gas was measured at 20±1 °C. In series of experiments mono- and co cultures of C. thermocellum GCD7 (OD600 = 0.94), and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 (OD600 = 1.24) were inoculated in bioreactor. Cells used to inoculate the bioreactor were harvested during log growth based on optical density at 600 nm (OD 600). To adjust pH to 8.5 and 5.5, in different experiments 1 N NaOH and 1 N HCl were used respectively. Agitation was kept constant at 50 rpm. Hydrogen production from cellobiose, cellobiose-glucose-xylose mix and monosaccharides like glucose and xylose was studied both at pH 8.5 and 5.5 in mono- and co-culture fermentations of GCD7 and GSC2. Experiments were carried out in 1 l working volume stirred batch bioreactor (New Brunswick Bioflo 300). Studies were performed under pure nitrogen environment in thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C). Agitation was kept constant at 50 rpm. 2.1.2 Analytical methods Gaseous products of fermentation were analyzed using Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph Auto System LX with thermal conductivity detector. A 3 m length column packed with HayeSep Q followed by a 1 m length molecular sieve column was used for determination of H2, N2, O2, CO2 and CH4. Helium (40 ml/min) was used as career gas. Temperature of the detector and the injector were 120 °C and 50 °C respectively. Oven temperature was 40 °C. Liquid products of fermentation were analyzed using Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph Auto System LX with flame ionization detector. A chromopak K 80/100 CRS column was used. H2 and air were used as fuel. Helium was used as carrier gas. Oven temperature, injector temperature and detector temperature were 130, 200 and 200 °C respectively. Cells growth was determined by changes in optical density at 600 nm using Perkin Elmer UV–VIS spectrophotometer Lambda EZ. Reducing sugars were determined by DNS method [15]. Cellobiose was hydrolyzed by almond β-glucosidase to glucose. Glucose was assayed enzymatically [16]. Residual cellulose was washed using acetic acid-nitric acid reagent and water to achieve removal of noncellulolytic materials. Cellulose was then quantified using the phenol-sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard [17]. Hemicellulose was determined using the method developed by Michel. Du Bois et al. [18]."
3,Pretreatment of OFMSW,"2.2 Pretreatment of OFMSW Experimental studies included preparation of simulated OFMSW and pretreatment of simulated OFMSW and corn stalks by freeze explosion method followed by milling frozen substrates to 0.5–1 mm particles. Initially, composition of MSW sampled for several times at Tbilisi landfill was determined. It was sorted manually at the laboratory. Data indicated that MSW composition did not significantly depend on seasonal changes. OFMSW separated from other components of MSW like glass, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics, textile stones and numerous others, contained 35–37% of cellulosic wastes (grass, branches, leaves, paper, cardboard, saw dust); 58–62% of food wastes (peels of fruits and vegetables, bones, meat, fat residues) and 3–5% of inorganic admixtures (ash, sand, soil). Chemical composition of food wastes separated from MSW sampled at landfill was the following: moisture - 67%, TS - 32%, VS – 83% of TS, TN - 1.3%, water-soluble carbohydrates - 3.2 g/l. Alkalinity (g/l) – 0.2, total acid (g/l) 0.4, C/N – 21.0. Analyses were performed according to standard methods [19]. Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin percentage in lignocellulosic fraction of OFMSW was 39.1; 28.7 and 15.3% respectively. For preparation of simulated OFMSW corn stalks containing 44.2% cellulose, 24.80% hemicellulose and 14. 47% lignin was used as cellulosic component. Corn stalks were mixed with peels of potato, apple, banana, orange, cucumber, tomato, cabbage and carrot, bones and skin of chicken, pork and beef and margarine. Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content in simulated OFMSW made 13.69; 10.04 and 5.3% respectively. Simulated OFMSW prepared in the laboratory in an amount of 10 kg was stored in a refrigerator at +4 °C. For technical embodiment of freeze explosion process, CO2 was used as a heat agent. Lab arrangement was designed in such a way that CO2 was delivered from gas container by compressor to high pressure vessel were in series of experiments corn stalks milled to 3–5 mm particles and saturated with hot (50 °C) water and simulated OFMSW mixed with water in proportion 1:0.2 were placed. After 30 min of contact time, CO2 pressure was sharply dropped. Due to temperature decrease associated with evaporation of pressurized carbon dioxide, organic wastes saturated with water were frozen. The evaporated carbon dioxide was compressed back in gas container and reused. In series of experiments corn stalks and OFMSW were frozen at −5, −10 and −20 °C and milled in the frozen state to 0.5–1 mm size particles. Amount of CO2 (kg) needed for freezing of corn stalks and OFMSW at different temperatures (−5, −10 and −20 °C) was estimated according to the standard formula: m CO 2 = c 1 m 1 Δ T 1 + m 1 r + c 2 m 1 Δ T 2 + c 3 m 2 Δ T 3 h ’ ’ − h ’ Where m CO 2 is the mass (kg) of carbon dioxide that is to be compressed in the high pressure vessel where cellulosics saturated with water are placed. h’’ is enthalpy of saturated vapor pressure of carbon dioxide at defined pressure (MPa), h’ - enthalpy of saturated liquid’s pressure of carbon dioxide at defined pressure, c 1 = 4.19 kJ/kg – water heat capacity, m 1 – amount of water used for saturation of organic wastes, ∆T 1 – change in water temperature from T 1 to 0 °C, c 2 = 2.04 kJ/kg – ice specific heat; r – ice melting specific heat; ∆T 2 – interval of ice temperature change; c3 – specific heat of cellulosics, m 2 – mass of sample (kg); ∆T 3 – interval of temperature change. Effectiveness of freeze explosion method pretreatment process was estimated by changes in cellulose polymerization degree, cellulose specific surface area and water-soluble carbohydrates. Water-soluble carbohydrates were determined according to method developed by C. O. Appleman, W. E. Loomis et al. [20]. For determination of cellulose specific surface area the method based on chemotripsin absorption was used. Computation of specific surface area was done on the assumption that on the analytical sample, monomolecular layer of enzyme was formed [21]. Cellulose polymerization degree was determined by the viscosimetry method: samples of cellulosic wastes were dissolved by coppery–ammonia complex and the viscosities of obtained solutions were measured by Ostwald viscosimeter [22]."
4,Decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentation and production of hydrogen from OFMSW,"2.3 Decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentation and production of hydrogen from OFMSW Experiments for decoupling hydrogen and methane fermentation resulting in hydrogen production from OFMSW at the first stage of the anaerobic process were carried out in two continuously stirred 3 l working volume batch bioreactors with pH and temperature controllers. Studies were performed at pH 9.0 and 5.5 respectively. In series of experiments the following substrates were used: (1) OFMSW separated from MSW sampled at Tbilisi landfill and (2) simulated OFMSW prepared in the laboratory and pretreated by combination of freeze explosion and mechanical milling methods. Both substrates were mixed with water prior to introducing it into the bioreactor. Volatile solids content in liquid substrate was 10 g/l. To adjust pH in bioreactors with liquid substrate to 9.0 and 5.5, 1 N NaOH and 1 N HCl were used. Liquid cultures of cellulolytic, saccharolytic and methane forming bacteria GCD7 (OD600 = 0.94), GSC2 (OD600 = 1.24), GML1 (OD600 = 2.65), GMK2 (OD600 = 2.23) and GMH7 (OD600 = 2.56) in amount of10 ml/l of substrate each, were inoculated in bioreactor, treating simulated OFMSW. All experiments were run in thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C) under pure nitrogen environment. Stirring was kept constant at 50 rpm. Volume of gas produced during fermentation was measured at 20 ± 1 °C using a reversible liquid displacement device with a wet-tip counter. Obtained gas was analyzed on a daily basis using gas chromatograph with thermal detector. Composition of liquid products of fermentation was measured by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector."
5,Biogas production from metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation,"2.4 Biogas production from metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation Series of experiments were carried out in 5 l working volume up-flow bioreactor with temperature and pH controllers. All studies were performed in thermophilic conditions at T = 55 °C. pH was maintained at 7.2 by adding 1 N NaOH. Biogas reactor was fed with the effluent obtained from the hydrogen production phase. To initialize start-up of methane production in bioreactor, liquid cultures of methane forming bacteria GML1 (OD600 = 2.65), GMK2 (OD600 = 2.23) and GMH7 (OD600 = 2.56) in amount of 10 ml/l were introduced. In next series of experiments 30 g of cattle manure per l substrate was used as seed material. Chemical composition of cattle manure was the following: moisture - 63%, TS– 34%, VS 70.9% of TS; TN– 2% VS; Cellulose and hemicellulose – 0.9%; ash – 2.1%. Biogas reactor was fed with 1000 ml/day of effluent from the hydrogen production phase. To determine VFA optimal loading rate (g/l d−1), in series of experiments, biogas reactor was fed with substrate containing VFA in following amounts (g/l): 0.8; 1.4; 2; 2.6; 3.2; 3.8."

7,"Fermentation of pretreated corn stalks, cellobiose and monosaccharides by mono- and co-cultures of C. thermocellum GCD7 and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 in thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C)","3.1 Fermentation of pretreated corn stalks, cellobiose and monosaccharides by mono- and co-cultures of C. thermocellum GCD7 and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 in thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C) In thermophilic monoculture fermentation when controlling pH at 8.5 and 5.5 respectively, both C. thermocellum GCD7 and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 produced the same end products such as H2, CO2, ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid from pretreated corn stalks and cellobiose-glucose-xylose mix but in different amounts and rate. When grown on pretreated corn stalks at pH 8.5 C. thermocellum GCD7 degraded 97% of cellulose and 98% of hemicellulose but fermented mainly glucose with production of H2, CO2, ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid. Biohydrogen production started on the 14th hour and ceased in 65 h. Maximum gas production was at pH 7.5. By the end of the process, pH dropped to 6.0. Cumulative hydrogen production from 10 g pretreated corn stalks containing 44.2% cellulose and 24.8% hemicellulose was 2.06 l. H2 percentage in produced biohydrogen varied in the range of 49.5–51.3%. Cumulative hydrogen production from 10 g pretreated corn stalks was estimated at 1.04 l. Cellobiose and xylose were the major products accumulated in the medium. Glucose was not detected. C. thermocellum GCD7 does not utilize cellobiose and xylose in monoculture fermentation, but converts 99% of glucose producing H2, ethanol, acetate, minor amounts of butyric acid and carbon dioxide. Results are given in Table 1 . C. thermosaccharolyticumGSC2 did not grow on pretreated corn stalks. Testing GSC2 for ability to ferment cellobiose, xylose, glucose and glucose-xylose-cellobiose mix showed that this bacterium was able to produce hydrogen both from monosaccharides and cellobiose. In GSC2 fermentation, hydrogen production started in 7–9 h and finished after 16–20 h. Hydrogen production was accompanied with formation of acetic acid and ethanol. Butyric acid was produced in minor amounts. The level of H2 production from above listed substrates was examined both at pH 8.5 and 5.5 and different initial concentrations of substrate. Maximum hydrogen production was fixed at pH 8.5 and substrate concentration 20 g/l. Yield of hydrogen, ethanol, acetate, butyric acid and carbon dioxide produced in the result of glucose, xylose, cellobiose and glucose-xylose-cellobiose mix fermentation by C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 are given in Table 2 . Composition of liquid products formed in GCD7 and GSC2 fermentation points out that hydrogen production by these microorganisms is associated with mixed ethanol-acetate type fermentation. Hydrogen production along with acetic acid and butyric acid formation has been known as a typical, metabolic pathway during dark fermentation by clostridium species [23]. The maximum theoretical production of H2 in acetic acid fermentation makes 4 mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose: C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 4H2 + 2CO2 [24]. Co-production of ethanol in GCD7 and GSC2 mono- and co-culture fermentation results in the decrease of hydrogen yield compared to acetate fermentation. In the course of bioconversion of pretreated corn stalks at pH 8.5 by C. thermocellum GCD7 in co-culture with C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ethanol, acetic acid and minor amount of butyric acid were formed but in different amount and rates from those observed in C. thermocellum GCD7 monoculture. The rate of hydrogen production in dual culture fermentation increased threefold. Cellobiose, glucose and xylose accumulation was not detected. Cellulose and hemicellulose conversion rate was 98%. Cumulative hydrogen production from 10 g pretreated corn stalks came to 1.27 l. The increase of hydrogen cumulative production in co-cultures fermentation is due to combined metabolic activities of both species. The unique cellulase system of C. thermocellum studied by a number of groups biochemically, immunologically and via molecular biological techniques along with numerous endoglucanases, exoglucanases, cellobiose phosphorylase and others are also comprised of six xylanases [25]. C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 like some other strains described in publications [27] shares a syntrophic relationship with C. thermocellum, utilizes hemicellulose hydrolysis products and maximizes end products formation. C. thermosaccharolyticum converts pentose sugars to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ethanol, acetic and butyric acid and thus results in the increase of hydrogen yield over cellulosic substrate fermentation by C. thermocellum in monoculture [26]. The ability to convert xylose reemphasizes the significance of the co-culture in the bioconversion of substrates with high content of cellulose and hemicellulose. In the course of pretreated corn stalks fermentation at pH 5.5 by mono- and co-culture of C. thermocellum GCD7 and C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ethyl alcohol, acetic acid and minor amounts of butyric acid were produced but in much less quantities and lower production rate than in fermentation at pH 8.5 (data not shown). Time course of corn stalks fermentation at pH 8.5 in monoculture of C. thermocellum GCD7 and in co-culture with C. thermosaccharolyticum GSC2 is plotted in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively."
8,Pretreatment of OFMSW,"3.2 Pretreatment of OFMSW Several technological options developed for pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrate include steam explosion + dilute acid pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis [28]; steam pretreatment combined with dilute acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose followed with enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose [29]; two-stage acid hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose [30]. Obstacles in the above processes are the insufficient separation of cellulose and lignin (which reduces the efficiency of subsequent enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis); the formation of by-products that inhibit fermenting microorganisms, high use of chemicals and considerable waste production. To improve digestibility of heavily biodegradable lignocellulosics (that are usually a component part of OFMSW), freeze explosion method followed by milling of frozen biomass was introduced for OFMSW pretreatment. The idea regarding freezing lies in the application of anomalous characteristic of water. Particularly, on phase transfer: water-ice, specific volume of water increases by 10%. Expansion of water contained in cellulosics causes mechanical stress that is followed by partial destruction of crystalline cellulose. Milling of frozen cellulosics enhances subsequent breaking of cellulose that leads to further increase of cellulose specific reactionary surface area accessible for enzymes [31]. The effectiveness of freeze explosion method followed by mechanical milling of frozen cellulosic substrate (corn stalks) and OFMSW containing 35% of cellulosics to 0.5–1 mm size particles was estimated by changes in cellulose structural characteristics and water-soluble carbohydrates. Initial characteristics and changes in structure and water-soluble carbohydrates concentration (w/v) resulting from freezing of corn stalks and OFMSW at different temperatures and milling of frozen wastes to 0.5–1 mm particles are given in Table 3 . Maximum increase in cellulose specific surface area and significant reduction of cellulose polymerization degree was achieved when corn stalks saturated with water were frozen at −20 °C. Freezing of cellulosics and OFMWS also resulted in the release of water-soluble carbohydrates. According to calculations, freezing of 1 kg OFMSW (impregnated with 0.2 kg water) from +20 °C to −20 °C, 1.7 kg carbon dioxide should be pressurized to 65 atm in the vessel with OFMSW. Energy consumption for 1.7 kg CO2 compression to 65 atm by piston compressor of average pressure is 0.27 kWh electric . Results reported here are close to those obtained for ammonia “freeze explosion” (AFEX) process [31]. Considering that carbon dioxide is one of the products of anaerobic digestion, its use as heat agent for realization freeze explosion process can be considered economical over ammonia."
9,Decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentation and hydrogen production from OFMSW,"3.3 Decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentation and hydrogen production from OFMSW As hydrogen producing and methane forming bacteria coexist in OFMSW separated from MSW, hydrogen produced during anaerobic fermentation of OFMSW is consumed by methanogens. To obtain hydrogen as a sole product of OFMSW fermentation, decoupling of hydrogen production and methane formation should be achieved by depressing methanogens in a way that hydrogen producers are not affected. Taking into account that methanogenic group of microorganisms are known to be the most pH sensitive and can tolerate pH changes only in the range of 6.8–7.2 whereas most of anaerobic hydrogen producing bacteria keep their activity in an acid environment (pH 5.5–4.5) and some of them produce hydrogen in the medium within pH 10.5–7.0 [32,33], studies on decoupling of hydrogen and methane production included fermentation of OFMSW at pH 9.0 and 5.5. OFMSW fermentation at pH 9.0 and T = 55 °C. First 3 l working volume batch bioreactor was charged with OFMSW sampled at landfill and milled to 3–5 mm particles. In second 3 l working volume batch bioreactor simulated OFMSW pretreated by combination of CO2 freeze explosion and milled to 0.5–1 mm size particles was introduced. Both substrates were mixed with water prior to introducing them in bioreactors. Volatile solids content was 10 g/l. Cellulose and hemicellulose percentage was 8.3 and 4.7% respectively. Liquid cultures of thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic, saccharolytic and methane forming bacteria - GCD7, GSC2, GML1, GMK2 and GMH7 were inoculated in second bioreactor. Gas production in both bioreactors started in 3 h. In first bioreactor, on the eighth hour, gas production drastically increased and reached maximum. Drastic increase in gas production and the increase of hydrogen concentration in produced biogas from 28.9 to 51.5% coincided with pH change from 9.0 to 8.3. Methane content in biohydrogen varied in the range of 0.09–0.1%. On the eleventh hour of fermentation, pH decreased to 8.0. By the thirteenth hour, pH drastically dropped to 5.3. This change in pH was followed by the sharp reduction in gas production. By the 14th hour biohydrogen production came to minimum. When fermenting OFMSW sampled at landfill at initial pH 9.0, yield of hydrogen made 82.5 ml H2/g VS. Hydrogen percentage in biohydrogen was about 50%. Content of ethyl alcohol, acetic acid and butyric acid in the fermentation broth was 3.52 g/l; 3.87 g/l and 0.04 g/l respectively. When fermenting pretreated simulated OFMSW at initial pH 9.0 by using co-cultures of GCD7 and GSD7 in the presence of methanogens GML1, GMK2 and GMH7, hydrogen yield made 104 ml of H2/g of VS. Content of ethyl alcohol, acetic acid and butyric acid in the fermentation broth was the following: 4.8 g/l; 5.1 g/l and 0.05 g/l respectively. Thus, studies on biohydrogen production at initial pH 9.0 from pretreated simulated OFMSW and OFMSW sampled at landfill showed that in both cases gas production rate and composition were similar. Hydrogen percentage in biohydrogen was about 51%. Difference was observed in the yield of hydrogen. OFMSW fermentation at pH 5.5 and T = 55 °C. In subsequent experiments, first 3 l working volume batch bioreactor was charged with OFMSW sampled at Tbilisi landfill. Concentration (w/v) of volatile solids in bioreactor was 10 g/l. Cellulose and hemicellulose percentage in both bioreactors was 8.3 and 4.7% respectively. pH was adjusted to 5.5. Gas production started over the fourth day and reached maximum on the 11th day. The second 3 l working volume bioreactor was charged with simulated OFMSW pretreated by freeze explosion and milled to 0.5–1 mm particles. Volatile solids content was 10 g/l. Cellulose and hemicellulose percentage in both bioreactors was 8.3 and 4.7% respectively. Liquid cultures of thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic, saccharolytic and methane forming bacteria - GCD7, GSC2, GML1, GMK2 and GMH7 were inoculated in bioreactor. Biohydrogen production was initiated on the second day and reached maximum on the eighth day. In the course of fermentation, pH changes were not detected. In both fermentations gas production practically stopped on the seventeenth day. Biohydrogen produced from both substrates was of similar composition. Hydrogen content gradually increased from 32.7 to 49.8%. Methane percentage in biohydrogen varied between 0.1 and 0.3%. At pH 5.5 hydrogen yield made 22.87 ml H2/g VS. Composition of liquid products of fermentation was the following: ethyl alcohol 1.03 g/l; acetic acid - 1.12 g/l; butyric acid −0.011 g/l. When fermenting OFMSW at pH 5.5 by using co-cultures of GCD7 and GSD7 in the presence of methanogenic bacteria strains GML1, GMK2 and GMH7 yield of hydrogen came to 29.9 ml H2/g of VS. Content of ethyl alcohol, acetic acid, and butyric acid in the fermentation broth was 1.37 g/l; 1.46 g/l; 0.014 g/l respectively. Fig. 3 shows biohydrogen production over time from OFMSW at initial pH 9.0. Lines 1 and 2 correspond to biohydrogen production from OFMSF sampled at landfill and simulated pretreated OFMSW respectively. Time course of biohydrogen production from OFMSF at pH 5.5 is plotted in Fig. 4 . Lines 1 and 2 correspond to biohydrogen production from OFMSF sampled at landfill and pretreated simulated OFMSW respectively. Results of studies described here show that full inhibition of methanogenic activity can be achieved both at pH 9.0 and pH 5.5. No additional control for preventing methanogenesis at hydrogen production stage was necessary. Percentage of hydrogen in biohydrogen produced at pH 9.0 and pH 5.5 was almost equal. Substantial difference was in cumulative gas production. Particularly, at initial pH 9.0, cumulative biohydrogen production was 3.5 times higher compared to biohydrogen production at pH 5.5. Extremely high was the difference in the rate of product formation. Particularly, biohydrogen production rate at initial pH 9.0 twenty six times exceeded the rate of biohydrogen production at pH 5.5. Liu D,Zeng RJand Angelidaki I, reported that the yield of 43 ml H2/g VS was generated in the hydrogen production stage when optimum pH for hydrogen production in the system was in the range from 5.0 to 5.5 [34]. Comparing results obtained under the studies stated here with those published by Liu D,Zeng RJand Angelidaki I, it is evident that biohydrogen production from OFMSW by using co-cultures of cellulolytic and saccharolytic clostridia at initial pH 9.0 when hydrogen yield makes 104 ml H2/g VS, is advantageous over biohydrogen production at pH 5.5–5.0. Economic efficiency of the method based on the use of sodium hydroxide was estimated by comparing it with so called “heat shock” method that involves heating of OFMSW- water mix at 90 °C during 20 min. Amount of heat energy consumed for heat shock of 1 ton of OFMSW – water mix comprising of 40% OFMSW and 60% water was calculated according to standard formula: Q = (c1m1 + c2m2) ΔT Here c 1 is thermal capacity of water (c 1 = 4.19 kJ/kg K); c 2 is thermal capacity of OFMSW that is about 2.40 kJ/kg K [35]; ΔT = T 1−T 2 where T 1 = 15 °C (initial temperature of OFMSW); T 2 = 90 °C; m 1 and m 2 correspond to the mass of water and OFMSW and equal to 0.6 ton and 0.4 tons respectively. So, thermal amount of energy needed for heating 1 tone OFMSW from T = 15 °C to T = 90 °C during 20 min equals 260.550 MJ. It should be noted that in the reality heat energy consumption for ” heat shock” process will be more due to heat losses. The latter depends on thermal insulation of the equipment and gas-furnace’s thermal efficiency. On the assumption that only theoretical amount of thermal energy is spent for realization of “heat shock” process, about 8 cubic meters of methane should be burnt. According to up-to-date price of natural gas, the cost of methane used for treatment of 1 tone OFMSW – water mix by heat shock method will be 2 US $. On the other hand, less than 0.8 kg of sodium hydroxide is needed for decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentations during anaerobic fermentation of 1 ton of OFMSW– water mix. At present time the price of 1 kg sodium hydroxide (e.g. imported in Georgia from Russia) is 0.6 US $. Comparing data obtained as a result of above calculations, use of sodium hydroxide can be considered advantageous over the “heat shock” process in term of cost-efficiency. Moreover, decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentations by using sodium hydroxide is a simple process, whereas implementation of “heat shock” process will need additional investment, operational and maintenance costs."
10,Biogas (bio-methane) production from metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation,"3.4 Biogas (bio-methane) production from metabolic products of hydrogen fermentation Chemical composition of effluent from hydrogen producing bioreactor treating simulated OFMSW pretreated by freeze explosion and milled to 0.5–1 mm particles are given in Table 4 . Biogas production rate and composition was the same when using either methanogenic bacteria cultures or cattle manure as seed material. Particularly, CH4 and CO2 content in produced biogas varied between 76-78% and 22–24% respectively. No other gases apart from methane and carbon dioxide were detected in obtained biogas. To determine effluent optimal loading rate, biogas production was studied as a function of VFA. Fig. 5 shows biogas production profile at different VFA feeding rate. Best results were obtained when VFA daily loading rate was 2.6 g/l. Considering that 1.0 l effluent from biohydrogen fermentation contained 5.15 g of VFA, prior to entering in methane bioreactor effluent was diluted by adding 1.980 l of water. Analyses of effluent from methane bioreactor showed that maximum reduction of VFA (98%) occurs at the optimum feeding rate of 2.6 g of VFA per liter daily. In such feeding conditions, daily biogas production was 1.352 l. To assess energy characteristics of two-stage process resulting in hydrogen and methane combined production from OFMSW studies on biogas production in one-stage process also were performed. Experiments were carried out in 10 l working volume batch-type bioreactor equipped with temperature and pH controllers, mixer, equipment for feeding and effluent discharge and biogas outlet pipe. Biogas reactor was connected to gas flow meter. The digester was started by charging substrate - simulated OFMSW milled to 3–5 mm particles and mixed with water at volatile solid concentration of 10 g/l. Cattle manure in the amount of 30 g/l substrate was introduced in bioreactor as the source of cellulolytic and methanogenic bacteria. Temperature in bioreactor was maintained at 55 °C; pH - 7.2. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 5 days. Volume of produced biogas was measured at 20 ± 1 °C. Experiments were done in duplicate. As a result of studies biogas composition and yield were defined. Particularly, biogas composition was following: methane – 60%, carbon dioxide – 40%. Yield of methane was 0.39 l/g of volatile solids. Experimental results obtained under the studies were used to develop a diagram describing scenario for co-generation of heat and power (CHP) from fuel gases produced both in one-stage and in two-stage process. On the assumption that 1 ton of OFMSW in average contains 230–250 kg of volatile solids, 12 m3 of hydrogen and 110 m3 of methane can be produced in two-stage anaerobic process from 1 ton of OFMSW. Using low temperature hydrogen fuel cell with electric efficiency of 50%, electric energy that can be generated by conversion of chemical energy of 12 m3 of hydrogen (specific heat content of H2 = 10 MJ/Nm3) to electricity was calculated in the following way: 12 m3 × 10 MJ/Nm3 × 0.5 = 6 MJelectric Using combustion engine with 31% electric efficiency, electric and heat energy that can be produced by combusting 110 m3 of methane (specific heat content of CH4 = 35 MJ/Nm3) was calculated in the following way: 110 m3 × 35 MJ/Nm3 × 0.31 = 1197 MJelectric 110 m3 × 35 MJ/Nm3−1197 MJel = 2652 MJthermal Comparison of energy characteristics estimated both for methane single-stage production and for combined production of methane and hydrogen are given in Fig. 6 . Calculations show that in terms of heat and power co-generation, two-stage process with hydrogen and methane combined production support increase in heat and electricity production by 23% and 26% respectively compared to one-stage process with solely methane production."
11,Conclusions,"Sodium hydroxide provides blocking of methanogenesis resulting in the decoupling of hydrogen and methane fermentation. This method is advantageous over “heat shock” method in terms of cost-efficiency. Pretreatment of cellulosic wastes by freeze explosion followed by milling of frozen wastes to 0.5–1 mm particles results in the decrease of cellulose polymerization degree and increase of cellulose surface area accessible to enzymes. Use of co-cultures of anaerobic cellulolytic GCD7 and saccharolytic GSC2 bacteria strains provides 97–99% conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose contained in pretreated cellulosic material and ensures utilization of both hexose and pentose sugars. As a result, hydrogen yield and production rate significantly increases. In terms of heat and power co-generation, two-stage process with hydrogen and methane combined production supports the increase of heat and electricity production by 23% and 26% respectively compared to one-stage process with solely methane production."
