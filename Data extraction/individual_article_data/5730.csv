0,Introduction,"Increasing awareness of food safety and environmental impacts of non-degradable/non-renewable petrochemical-based products has driven a growing demand for biodegradable materials developed from naturally renewable ingredients (Younis & Zhao, 2019). Biodegradable films represent a feasible alternative to replace most applications of synthetic materials. These materials can be optimised to suit specific functions, including separation of layered foods, lamination, disposable pouches and as thin layers for the primary product contact (Soares, Lima, Oliveira, Pires, & Soldi, 2005). However, they need to undergo modification using economically feasible and acceptable techniques, to improve their compatibility and durability across different handling environments. Biodegradable films are formed by casting dispersions of biopolymers, such as proteins (legumes, cereals, dairy), polysaccharides (starch, chitosan and cellulose) or their composites. Protein-based films exhibit good gas and lipid barrier properties, particularly at low relative humidity. They also possess excellent mechanical properties due to covalent (e.g. disulphide), hydrogen‑hydrogen (HH), electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Bourtoom, 2008). On the other hand, polysaccharide films provide an adequate barrier to gases but possess weak water resistance properties due to their hydrophilic nature. However, polysaccharides contribute to the stability of the film-forming dispersions owing to the thickening, emulsifying, adhesive and gelling ability (Benichou, Aserin, & Garti, 2002; Fischer, 2013). Besides, composite films, developed for better film performance, can be tuned for various uses by varying the ratios of biopolymers or use of crosslinkers (Ahmed & Ikram, 2016; Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2019). Among the widely investigated biopolymers, co-products of the food industry such as zein (ZN), a prolamin protein from corn (Qu et al., 2019) and chitosan (CS), a polysaccharide derived from chitin (from the exoskeleton of crustaceans and some insects), are renewable and abundant biopolymers that exhibit desirable film-forming qualities (Zheng et al., 2019). The widespread interest in ZN and CS for production of biodegradable materials is attributable to their excellent properties, including amphiphilicity, compatibility, nontoxicity and numerous unique functionalities (e.g. hydrophobicity and polycationic behaviour) (Li et al., 2018). For ZN, the low affinity to water molecules and the ability to engage in robust hydrophobic, van der Waals and HH interactions presents an opportunity for targeted modification (Senna, Salmieri, El-naggar, Safrany, & Lacroix, 2010). On the other hand, CS chains can establish electrostatic and covalent interactions with other macromolecules and thus exhibits high biocompatibility. However, like other bio-based materials, ZN and CS-based films possess weak tensile properties and reduced stability in diverse environments (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). Among the numerous modification strategies, extensive use of chemical cross-linkers or techniques requiring purification continues to hinder the proper application of the films. Generally, conventional modification approaches, such as enzymatic, chemical and physical methods alter the nature of macromolecular interactions (e.g. electrostatic, covalent linkages) by altering their surface charges (Gan, Wang, Cochrane, & McCarron, 2005). Some literature sources concerning the role of surface residues and charge density during aggregation and self-assembly of CS (Li et al., 2018) and ZN (Kim & Xu, 2008) indicate that charge-charge interactions are crucial for their colloidal behaviour. Besides, surface charges can influence the strength of interactions, structure and functionality of formations in the solid-state. Thus modification of the surface properties can improve the functionality of the compounds, resulting in materials of better mechanical and stability properties in various environments (Qu et al., 2019). Processing of biomacromolecules under pulsed electric fields (PEF) has been postulated as a chemical-free, low-temperature technique for functional modification of biomacromolecules (Ma, Yu, Zhang, & Wang, 2012b; Sitzmann, Vorobiev, & Lebovka, 2016). As presented in recent reviews (Giteru, Oey, & Ali, 2018b; Sitzmann et al., 2016; Wang, Li, Sun, & Zhu, 2018; Yogesh, 2016), the potential of the pulsed system to modify biomacromolecules lies in the ability to influence the surface charges. According to the previous investigations, the energy dissipated during PEF can cause ionisation of the functional groups and break electrostatic interactions of macromolecules resulting in the cleavage or coalescence of monomeric units (Yao et al., 2011; Zhao & Yang, 2012). The influence of PEF processing on interactions and the microstructure of polymeric chains was reported in proteins (Li, Chen, & Mo, 2007; Yan-Yan et al., 2014), polysaccharides (Luo, Han, Zeng, Yu, & Kennedy, 2010; Ma, Yu, Zhang, & Wang, 2012a) and their composites (Guan et al., 2010). The evidence from these studies show that, at a certain critical intensity (Ic), varying the PEF parameters including the electric field strength (E), specific energy (Q), and pulse frequency (f), can individually alter the structure of biomacromolecules (Alahakoon, Oey, Silcock, & Bremer, 2017; Giteru, Oey, & Ali, 2018a). However, as the application of PEF to systems of macromolecules has only recently emerged, there is still no consensus on threshold levels regarding optimal parameters for such use (Giteru et al., 2018b; Jaeger, Meneses, & Knorr, 2014). Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of PEF processing on physicochemical properties of biomacromolecules in the colloidal and dried states. A Box-Behnken design was used to optimise PEF processing variables, including E, f and Q for film development from a composite dispersion of ZN, CS, poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyethylene glycol as well as to tailor the colloidal and microstructural properties of biomacromolecule dispersions to improve their functionality. Colloidal properties (viscosity, loss modulus and particle size), mechanical (tensile strength, Young's modulus) and erosion properties of the dispersions were measured under different PEF processing conditions. Films from PEF processed dispersions were also further assessed based on crystallinity, surface morphology and thermal stability and evaluated against films developed using conventional preparation techniques of heating and chemical cross-linking using sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP)."
1,Materials and methods,"Corn zein (ZN) (Z 3625, molecular weight (Mw) 22–24 kDa), 88.64% (w/w) protein (Kjeldahl analysis (AOAC, 2011)), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) (Mw 89,000–98,000 Da, 99+ % hydrolysed) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (molecular number, 380–420) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Shanghai Waseta International Trading Co., LTD (China) supplied chitosan (CS), Mw 890 kDa and 91% degree of deacetylation. Glacial acetic acid (Univar, USA) and ethanol (99.5%) (Anchor ethanol limited, Auckland, NZ) were of analytical grade. All reagents and chemicals were used as received."
2,Preparation of ZCP film-forming dispersions,"2.1 Preparation of ZCP film-forming dispersions A film-forming dispersion (FFD) was prepared according to a previously optimised method (Giteru et al., 2019). In this method, an intermix containing 0.25, 0.39, 0.13, and 0.23 weight fraction (dry basis) of ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG, respectively was prepared in 60% (v/v) ethanol/water and 6% (v/v) acetic acid. The composite dispersion was then homogenised at 8000 rpm for 2 min (IKA® T 50 ULTRA-TURRAX®, Krackeler Scientific, NY, USA). The final dispersions gave a pH of 5.6 ± 0.1 and a conductivity of 262 ± 10 μS/cm. The FFD was kept at 20 ± 1 °C for at least six hours before further processing."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design Preliminary investigations were used to determine the most significant levels of PEF parameters for the structure/function modification in zein-chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) (ZCP) dispersions. The trial experiments were either performed at a specific energy (Q) of 65–70, 150–160, 385–400 and 585–630 kJ/kg or electric field strength (E) of 0.9, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.4 kV/cm or pulse frequency at 10, 50, 100 and 220 Hz (Supplementary data, Table S1). The effect of PEF processing was tested using the zero shear viscosity (η0) (Pa·s) of the colloidal dispersions and tensile properties (tensile strength, (TS) (MPa) and elongation at break (EAB) %) of the films cast from the treated dispersions. According to the preliminary results, the most significant levels of PEF parameters were used in a Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD), as shown in Table 1 . The three independent variables, including E (X 1 ), f (X 2 ) and Q (X 3 ) fixed at 3-equidistant levels gave 15 independent experiments as determined by N = 2 k (k – 1) + C 0 (where k is the number of factors, and C 0 is the number of central points) (Yetilmezsoy, Demirel, & Vanderbei, 2009). In the BBD, the effect of PEF parameters was evaluated based on the responses derived from the colloidal properties of ZCP dispersions including the zero-shear viscosity η0 (Pa·s) (Y 1 ), loss modulus G″ (Pa) (Y 2 ), particle diameter (PD) (D·nm) (Y 3 ) and polydispersity index (PDI) (Y 4 ). Subsequently, film castings from the treated dispersions were characterised using the tensile strength TS (MPa) (Y 5 ), Young's modulus of elasticity EM (MPa) (Y 6 ), and erosion index (Ei) in water (%) (Y 7 ) to determine the translation of the PEF-induced effects from the colloidal to the solid-state. Each experiment was performed in three independent runs using three samples per experimental run."
4,Pulsed electric field processing,"2.3 Pulsed electric field processing PEF treatment was performed in a pilot plant scale system (ELCRACK-HVP 5, German Institute of Food Technologies, Quakenbrück, Germany) in a batch configuration mode. The equipment had a capacity of 25 kV output voltage delivered in square wave bipolar pulses. The voltage was monitored with a set of external probe and oscilloscope (Model UT2025C, Uni-Trend Group Ltd., China). The oscilloscope had a 25 MHz bandwidth, < 14 ns rise time, 250 MS/s sample rate real-time, 2 mV vertical sensitivity and 20 ns of scan time base. The PEF treatment chamber was a 40 mm gap stainless steel electrode with a maximum capacity of 50 cm3. Each treatment involved weighing 40 g of freshly prepared film-forming dispersion into the chamber followed by PEF treatment according to Table 2 (optimisation study) and Supplementary data Table S1 (preliminary study). The specific energy was calculated according to Eq. (1) (Zhang, Barbosa-Cánovas, & Swanson, 1995). Electric field strength (E) kV/cm, load resistance (R) ohms, voltage (V) kV, current (I) A, and pulse number (n p ) were measured using a built-in system integrated into the PEF equipment. (1) Q p kJ / kg = V 2 τ p n p Rw where, τ p is the pulse width (μs), and w is the sample weight (kg). The pulse width was held constant at 32 μs across the experiments, and the effective processing time (t PEF ) (ms) was calculated by n p × τ p × 0.001 (Table 2). Subsequent to PEF, the dispersions were chilled to 8.0 ± 1.0 °C, which gave a post-PEF temperature of 55–60 °C. Low temperatures during the treatment lowered the risk of ignition due to the presence of ethanol (60% v/v) in the solvent. The temperature (T, oC) and conductivity (C, μS/cm) of the dispersions before and after the treatment were measured using a conductivity meter (CyberScan CON 11; Eutech Instruments, Singapore, Singapore). Post-PEF treatment, the dispersions were cooled down (12 °C for 1 h) then used for the subsequent analyses."
5,Colloidal properties of ZCP film-forming dispersions,"2.4 Colloidal properties of ZCP film-forming dispersions 2.4.1 Rheological properties of ZCP film-forming dispersions Rheological measurements were performed using a 60-mm diameter double cone/plate sensor (DC 60–1 Ti, sample size 5.2 mL) at 0.052 mm gap (HAAKE Rheostress 1, Karlsruhe, Germany). The flow behaviour (shear stress, shear rate) was recorded at 12 ± 0.5 °C in controlled shear mode using steady-state conditions between 0.187 and 1000 s− 1 (60 data points) (Fig. 2a). In the steady-state, deformation is applied at every shearing level, and the stress is allowed to stabilise (maximum detection time 15 s) before recording a response at the particular shear rate The apparent viscosity (η a ) (Pa.s) was calculated from η a = σ/ γ ̇ , where σ is the shear stress (Pa) and γ ̇ is the shear rate (s− 1). The colloidal behaviour was also evaluated using the consistency index (K) mPa·s n , (a value obtained from the non-Newtonian Power-law equation σ = K γ ̇ n , where n is the flow behaviour index). Following preliminary assessments using various rheological models (data not shown), the relationship between η a and ( γ ̇ ) was further developed using the Carreau Yasuda (CY) model. CY-model fitting was necessary because the flow curves of η a versus (γ) depicted three transitions: a power-law shear thinning behaviour (<10 s− 1), a Newtonian regime (viscosity independent of the shear rate) and a shear-thinning region (high shear >100 s− 1) (Fig. 2a). Thus, the fitting of the flow data on CY-model (Eq. (2)) could help in understanding the influence of shear rate on macromolecular structures. The fitting on CY-model was performed using the non-linear least-squares method (R 2 > 0.99) on HAAKE Rheowin 3 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, GmbH, Germany). Carreau Yasuda model; (2) η a ∣ γ ∣ = ηο 1 + λ c γ a 1 − Na where η 0 is the zero-shear viscosity (Pa·s), λc is a time constant related to the relaxation times of the polymer in solution, N is the flow behaviour index, a is the CY fitting parameter describing the transition from Newtonian to shear-thinning behaviour (fixed at 2.0 in the current experiment) (Rao, 2014). Oscillation frequency sweeps were performed within the linear viscoelastic region (LVR), comprising of an angular frequency (ω) range of 0.1 rad/s – 62.8 rad/s, shear stress of 2 Pa and a temperature of 12.0 ± 0.5 °C. The storage (G′) and loss (G˝) moduli were recorded as a function of the angular frequency (ω) (rad/s). All rheological analysis were carried out in triplicate using three independent samples per treatment. 2.4.2 Determination of mean particle size diameter Hydrodynamic properties were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a high-performance particle sizer (HPPS) equipped with a 3.0 mW helium/neon laser at an output wavelength of 633 nm (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). In this method, undiluted FFD (1 mL) were transferred into disposable sizing cuvettes, and measurements of the dynamics of scattered light were recorded at 20 ± 0.5 °C using a non-invasive backscattering detection at an angle of 173 o. The sample viscosity measured at a shear rate of 40 s− 1 (η 40 s − 1) (Haake Rheostress 1) was manually entered during each run (Fig. 2a). The mean particle size diameter (Z-average) was obtained using the Stokes-Einstein relationship following the cumulant fit of the intensity of the scattered light. The polydispersity index (PDI) was derived from the cumulants analysis of the scattered light to describe the relative variance of the size distribution. Z-average was computed from the average of the ten measurements, and the experiment was run in triplicate using three independent samples."
6,Film casting and characterisation,"2.5 Film casting and characterisation PEF and non-PEF dispersions were degassed for 2 min at 25 ± 3 °C using an ultrasonic machine in degassing mode (37 kHz) (Elmasonic S 30H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). The dispersions were cast on a 10 cm × 10 cm polystyrene Petri dish using a constant rate of total solid (0.05 g/cm2) in order to minimise variations in film thickness. This was followed by drying at 20 ± 2 °C using forced draft (airflow rate = 0.5 m/s). Dried films were conditioned at 22 ± 2 °C in a vacuum desiccator equilibrated using magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg (NO3)2∙6H2O) (53 ± 3% RH) for a minimum of seven days. Thermal effects due to ohmic heating were discarded by running a conventional heat-treated sample at 70 °C for 30 min. Additionally, conventionally cross-linked films using sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) were prepared by mixing 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0% (w/v) sodium tripolyphosphate with the native dispersion followed by homogenisation (8000 rpm for 2 min). All dispersions were degassed and allowed to stand for 3 h before casting onto polystyrene Petri dishes. 2.5.1 Determination of tensile properties The thickness (T) of the conditioned films was measured using a hand-held digital micrometre (Thorlabs, NJ, USA) to the nearest 0.01 mm. Tensile properties were determined using a universal testing machine TA-HD plus (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Godalming, UK) following a standard method (ASTM D638-02a (V)) (ASTM, 2003). Briefly, the films were cut into a dumbbell shape (length between the grips (l 0 ) 25.4 mm, strain height l = 7.62 mm, width of the narrow section W = 3.18 mm). Testing was conducted using a load cell of 50 N, a cross-head speed of 4.8 mm/min, a pre-test speed of 4.8 mm/min, a post-test speed of 8 mm/min, initial separation of the grips 25.4 mm and a target distance of 30 mm. The cross-sectional areas of the test samples were determined immediately before the mechanical analysis using the thickness of individual samples obtained at five arbitrarily chosen positions. The tests were conducted at 22 ± 2 °C and 45 ± 3% RH. The tensile strength (TS) MPa (maximum stress) and Young's modulus of elasticity (EM) MPa, were obtained from the stress versus strain curves (Eqs. (3)–(4)), whereas the elongation at break, (EAB) % was calculated from the force-distance curves Eq. (5). Triplicate runs of at least six film strips were tested for each treatment. (3) TS MPa = F max / A o (4) EM = L O F 2 − F 1 A O δ 2 − δ 1 (5) EAB % = ∆ l / l 0 × 100 where, F max is the maximum load on the force-distance curve (N), A o is the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen (T × W) mm2. The force (F 1 , F 2 ) and displacement (δ 1 , δ 2) values were obtained from a linear portion (medium strain region) of the displacement against the force curve. Δl is the change in length from the original length (l o) of the specimen between the grips. 2.5.2 Determination of erosion index Erosion index (Ei) (%) of the films in water was determined gravimetrically as described by Yuan et al. (2016). Briefly, the films were equilibrated for seven days at 53% RH then dried (60 °C, 30% RH) for 24 h. Thereafter, samples of about 3 cm × 3 cm were weighed (W 0 ) into 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and the tubes were filled with 35 mL deionised water containing 0.02% sodium azide to minimise the growth of microorganisms. The tubes were sealed and incubated with shaking at 25 ± 2 °C for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 3300 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the solids were rinsed three times using deionised water. The final weight of the total insoluble solids (W 1) was obtained after drying the sediments at 60 °C until they attained a constant weight. The erosion index of the films (Ei) was calculated according to Eq. (6). (6) Erosion index Ei % = W 0 − W 1 W 0 × 100 2.5.3 Determination of phase transition properties using differential scanning calorimetry The thermal properties of the films were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on DSC Q100 (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE, USA). Dried samples (~5 mg) were sealed into a 10 μL DSC Tzero standard pan according to the standard method D3418 (ASTM, 2013). The sample was held at an isothermal temperature (25 °C) for 2 min before heating at 5 °C/min using a temperature regime of 25–225 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min and an empty pan as an inert reference. The transition points including the glass transition temperature (Tg), peak temperature during the melting transition (TM) and the enthalpy of melting (∆H) were analysed using the thermal analysis software, Universal 2000 version 4.5A (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE, USA). TM was taken as the peak of the endothermic curve, during heating. 2.5.4 Determination of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on X'Pert PRO MPD PW3040/60 diffractometer (Malvern PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) equipped with a 3 kW irradiation source (Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) of 40 kV tube voltage and 30 mA tube current) (Zhai et al., 2017). The measurements were recorded in the scanning range of 5 o < 2θ < 35 o diffraction angle in a continuous scan mode of 0.008° step size. All data were processed using X'pert accompanying software program (X'Pert HighScore v4.0). 2.5.5 The morphology of the films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the composite films from both the optimised PEF parameters and conventional processing were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The samples were mounted on stabs and gold-coated (2 min, 2 mbar) followed by the recording of the micrographs in a vacuum of 9.75 × 10− 5 Torr."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Three replications of the independent experiments were carried out using triplicate samples in each experiment. The regression relationships between the responses (Y i ) and the independent (X i, X j ) variables were tested by fitting the data to a second-degree non-linear quadratic model (Eq. (7)) in Minitab (Version 17, PA, USA) using backwards stepwise elimination at α = 0.1 (Chen et al., 2016) to discard insignificant variables. (7) Y i = β 0 + β i ∑ X i + β ii ∑ X i 2 i ≠ j + β ij ∑ X i X j + ε where Y i is the value of predicted response; β 0 , βi, β ij and β ii are the linear, quadratic and interaction coefficients of the regression model; X i and X j are the independent variables. The significance of the models was tested using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-test at p < 0.05 (Chmiel, Kupska, Wardencki, & Namieśnik, 2017) as presented in the supplementary data, Table S4. The proportion of the variation in Y i explained by the independent variables X i to X j in the regression models was described using the coefficient of multiple determination R 2 (squares of error/ total sum of squares (SSR/SST) and the adjusted coefficient (R a 2 ). Validation experiments were processed using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) with Tukey's post hoc test in IBM SPSS software (ver. 25, NY, USA)."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Effect of pulsed electric fields on ZCP dispersions and films,"3.1 Effect of pulsed electric fields on ZCP dispersions and films The effect of PEF processing on the microstructure of ZCP colloidal dispersions and films was initially evaluated using rheological analysis to determine optimal levels for biomacromolecule modification (Fig. 1 ). Changes in rheological properties reflected alterations of the molecular structure in the colloidal dispersions, including the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (Quezada Gallo, Debeaufort, & Voilley, 1996). The results showed a decrease in η0 with increases in E (≥ 2.8 kV/cm), Q (585–630 kJ/kg) (p < 0.05), and medium f (50–100 Hz) (Fig. 1a-c). However, the consistency index (K), which is an indicator of the viscous nature of a system and reflects the internal structure increased under varied E, f, or Q, which was likely due to the disintegration of larger molecules to smaller particles at higher PEF intensity. This may have led to improvements in solvent-macromolecule interactions and stabilised the particle-particle associations to prevent large aggregates. These findings were in agreement with previous studies reporting that PEF processing at increasing field strength (15–20 kV/cm) and pulse number (20–60) (f = 0.5 Hz, 20 pulses exponential series) resulted in higher K of dispersions containing milk proteins (Xiang, Simpson, Ngadi, & Simpson, 2011b). The modified aggregation and growth pattern of the protein aggregates were attributable to the firm intermolecular interactions between the proteins, to form weak transient networks. Another study reported a decrease in the viscosity of skimmed milk proteins upon PEF processing (E = 45–55 kV/cm, f = 40–120 Hz. Q = 204.9–82.0 kJ/kg, effective PEF exposure = 250–500 ns, continuous system T < 50 °C). The authors attributed the decrease in viscosity to the coagulation of the protein due to modified intermolecular interactions of the casein micelles (Floury et al., 2006). By influencing the molecular chain conformation, PEF processing can modify the nature of intermolecular interactions and self-assembly properties of macromolecules (Xiang et al., 2011b). Both the films from PEF-treated and untreated dispersions showed an increase in the tensile strength (TS) at high E (≥ 2.8 kV/cm), but a decrease at medium f and high Q (Fig. 1d-f). Likewise, increasing the intensity of PEF parameters resulted in lower EAB (Fig. 1g-i), showing that PEF processing might have raised the magnitude of intermolecular interactions in the assembled matrix (Guan et al., 2010; Perez & Pilosof, 2004; Xiang, Simpson, Ngadi, & Simpson, 2011a). As a result, the molecular chain mobility was depressed, leading to the formation of a compact but brittle film structure (Masamba et al., 2016; Nygraha, Lan, & Alain, 2005)."
10,Optimisation of PEF parameters using Box–Behnken experimental design,"3.2 Optimisation of PEF parameters using Box–Behnken experimental design The influence of PEF parameters: E, f and Q on the colloidal properties (η0, G″, PD, PDI) of ZCP dispersions and physicochemical properties of film castings from the treated dispersions (TS, EM, Ei) were investigated using the Box-Behnken design. The values for the experimental and predicted responses were summarised in the Supplementary data, Table S2 and Table S3. ANOVA analysis performed to determine the significance of the quadratic models (Supplementary data, Table S4) showed that the model parameters were significant (p < 0.05) for estimation of the dependent factors. Correlation between the predicted and experimental values of the dependent factors was specified further in the plots of the actual versus predicted and the corresponding R 2 (Supplementary data, Fig. S1). The results verified that processing ZCP dispersions at various levels of PEF parameters could reliably predict the structural properties of the dispersions and the resulting films. 3.2.1 Rheological properties of ZCP dispersions The regression model showed that η 0 could be predicted reliably by the independent factors of E, Q and f (R 2 = 98.68%) (Supplementary data, Table S4). From the prediction model (Eq. (8)), the viscosity can decrease by increasing the linear terms of E and Q but increase at high f (Fig. 2b). (8) Zero shear viscosity η 0 × 10 − 3 Pa = 25.95 – 2.78 E + 8.94 × 10 − 3 f – 14.56 × 10 − 3 Q + 0.47 E 2 + 0.11 × 10 − 4 Q 2 – 3.28 × 10 − 3 E · f + 2.40 × 10 − 3 E · Q The observed values of viscosity compared with the values predicted by the quadratic model are shown in the Supplementary data, Fig. S1 and Table S2. The quadratic terms of E 2 , Q 2 and their interaction, E·Q, may lead to higher viscosity, but high E combined with high f can cause a decrease (p < 0.05). The increase in viscosity can be attributed to the PEF-induced disaggregation of the initially established ZCP complexes exposing reactive moieties, which increases the surface area and solvent affinity of the particles (Han, Zeng, Zhang, & Yu, 2009; Li et al., 2007). Higher η 0 could also be related to the simultaneous disintegration and depolymerisation action of PEF on ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG, resulting in multiple active sites for intermolecular interactions. On the contrary, extremely high availability of reactive sites could promote molecular aggregation/re-aggregation of disintegrated units through electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions leading to the formation of large particles, thus the low viscosity (Rao, 2014; Xiang et al., 2011a). The potential for molecular disintegration and changes in the viscosity after PEF processing was earlier demonstrated in cassava starch (Hong, Zeng, Buckow, Han, & Wang, 2016), potato starch (Hong, Chen, Zeng, & Han, 2016) and chitosan (CS) dispersions (Luo et al., 2010). The decrease in the viscosity was attributable to the depolymerisation and breakdown of granular starch and CS chains. PEF-induced disintegration of biomacromolecules alters the hydrodynamic properties of the polymer chains, which manifests as the effect on molecular characteristics (Luo et al., 2010). The contribution of PEF parameters to the loss modulus was evaluated at an angular frequency of 1 rad/s. These measurements were crucial in relating the molecular configuration of the colloidal state of the dispersions to its properties in the solid-state. Generally, the dispersions exhibited liquid/viscous-like properties with a minimal elastic response. The loss modulus (G″) was always higher than the storage modulus (G′), depicting a lack of network structure but characterised by weak non-specific interactions (Ricciardi, Gaillet, Ducouret, Lafuma, & Laupretre, 2003). The second-order polynomial equation (Eq. (9)), depicted a decrease in G″ with an increase in the linear term of E, the quadratic function of f 2 and the interaction of f.Q (R 2 = 95.66%) (Fig. 3a-c). The insignificant (p > 0.05) lack-of-fit showed that the model was suitable in predicting G″ (Supplementary data, Table S4). Decreasing G″ implies re-establishment of conformational order in the dispersions. Wang, Wu, Shi, Deng, and Sun (1998) also reported higher intermolecular interactions after the exposure of CS dispersions to an electric field (corona charge system, E = 60–100 kV/cm, 30–40 min), which was attributable to self-association of CS molecules through hydrophobic interactions. The negative effect of E on the viscous dissipation of the dispersions perhaps originated from the PEF-induced disintegration of the particles of ZN, CS and PVOH, and subsequently availability of multiple anionic side groups for intermolecular interactions, which promoted network formation. Restoration of the network structure has also been observed in PEF-processed soy milk (E = 18, 20 and 22 kV/cm, np = 20–60, f = 0.5 Hz) (Xiang et al., 2011a) and bovine skimmed milk (E = 15–20 kV/cm, np = 25–100, f = 0.5 Hz) (Xiang et al., 2011b). In these studies, the increase in viscosity and consistency index occurred with increases in the number of pulses and electric field strength. Such network formations may have originated from the growth of protein aggregates due to strong intermolecular interactions between the denatured milk proteins to form weak transient networks. In a protein-polysaccharide system, the network formation can also occur due to cross-links development through either electrostatic means or covalent bonds between the free amino group (-NH2) in the unfolded proteins and the carbonyl (-C=O) of the polysaccharides (Benichou et al., 2002; Rodríguez Patino & Pilosof, 2011; Sun, Yu, Zeng, Yang, & Jia, 2011). Sun et al. (2011) reported bioconjugation between whey proteins and dextran resulting in network formation even as the secondary structure of the protein disappeared. Guan et al. (2010) also demonstrated an increase in PEF-assisted graft reaction between the ε-amino-groups (-NH2) of the protein and the carbonyl (-C=O) end of the reducing sugar when a bovine serum albumin (BSA)–dextran system was treated using PEF (E = 10 and 20 kV/cm). Collectively, these modifications can influence the nano-, micro-, and macrostructures, including rheological properties of the dispersions. Analysis of the factors contributing to the increase in G″ shows that increasing the pulse frequency and specific energy resulted in structural degradation and less network formation. Hong, Chen, et al. (2016) also reported the loss of interactions and internal microstructure in cassava starch. Perhaps by availing multiple reactive sites on macromolecular chains, PEF processing increases the interaction of particles with water, increasing their solubility and affecting their viscoelastic properties. (9) Loss modulus G "" × 10 − 3 Pa = 18.94 – 0.83 E + 0.04 f + 2.22 × 10 − 3 Q – 0.35 E 2 – 0.65 × 10 − 4 f 2 + 2.19 × 10 − 3 E · f + 1.46 × 10 − 3 E · Q – 0.26 × 10 − 4 f · Q 3.2.2 Particle size and polydispersity index The viscosity and viscoelastic behaviour, which are a consequence of solvent-macromolecule interactions, are also dependent on the number and size of the aggregates per unit volume (Wang et al., 2017). The stepwise fitting of the second-order polynomial model to the particle diameter resulted in few significant factors, which generally revealed that increased perturbations due to high-intensity PEF could decrease the particle sizes (R 2 = 86.21%) (Supplementary data, Table S4). From Eq. (10), increasing E could significantly decrease the particle sizes (p < 0.05) but the linear terms of f and Q were insignificant (p > 0.05) (Supplementary data, Table S4). The decrease in the particle sizes at increasing E and the 2-way interaction of f·Q agreed with the aforementioned PEF-induced disintegration of molecular chains. Similar decreases in the particle sizes at increasing E were observed in pectin-based dispersions (E = 18–30 kV/cm, t exp = 806–2418 μs) (Ma et al., 2012a). These findings evidence that perturbations during PEF could cause degradation of large molecules or preformed aggregates due to the cleaving of molecular chains and disruption of electrostatic, HH and van der Waals interactions. (10) Particle diameter PD nm = 121.70 – 3.51 E – 0.11 f – 0.04 Q + 5.92 × 10 − 4 f 2 – 2.07 × 10 − 4 f · Q The quadratic variable f 2 led to significant increases (p < 0.05) in particle sizes, an indication that the growth was dependent on the pulse density, owing to the fact that PEF-induced effects are cumulative, and that the actual changes occur within a range of PEF energy delivered over a given period (Luo et al., 2010). Therefore, certain critical intensities (Ic) of the frequency and energy may be required to cause modification in the particle diameter. The range of particle sizes observed in this study (121–148 nm) has previously been associated with ZN-CS systems (118–202 nm) (Zhang et al., 2014). The surface response diagram (Fig. 3d-f) provides details on various interactions of the independent factors. The maximum particle size of 148.19 nm was obtained at E = 2.5 kV/cm, f = 300 Hz and Q = 80 kJ/kg. These findings indicate that a low Q or a faster treatment (f = 300 Hz) could have favoured particle-particle interactions or retention of intact particles, implying that the range of parameters was below Ic. This finding was in agreement with an earlier observation of minimal degradation of pectin molecules after exposure to PEF for 806 μs compared to 2418 μs (E = 18–30 kV/cm, t p = 40 μs, f = 1 kHz continuous system) (Ma et al., 2012a). The polydispersity index (PDI) describes the distribution of distinct phases in a dispersion. Eq. (11) shows that the PDI was significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by the linear terms of E, f and Q (R 2 = 98.02%). (11) Polydispersity index PDI = 0.55 – 0.12 E – 0.59 × 10 − 4 f – 2.05 × 10 − 4 Q + 1.45 × 10 − 2 E 2 + 2.74 × 10 − 4 E · f + 1.59 × 10 − 4 E · Q + 1 × 10 − 6 f · Q The decrease in the PDI on PEF treatment may be attributed to the net stabilisation effect, owing to the exposure of multiple surface-active moieties that could temporarily halt the coalescence of the spheres (Amin, Barnett, Pathak, Roberts, & Sarangapani, 2014). This phenomenon can be experienced at sufficiently large electrostatic repulsions between the aggregates, suggesting that PEF-induced modifications provided electrostatic and steric effects that resulted in electrosteric stabilisation (De Kruif, Weinbreck, & de Vries, 2004; Wang & Zhang, 2017). The PDI of the dispersions was <1.0, indicating that the dispersions were not too polydisperse (Supplementary data, Table S3). From the second-order polynomial model, the PDI increased due to the 2-way interactions of E·f and E·Q (Eq. (11)), which was likely due to the disintegration of the molecules as the PEF conditions intensified. In particular, increasing E demonstrated a positive influence in the network formation under G″, which could have resulted from higher particle-particle associations after PEF. According to Rao (2014), an increase in particle sizes decreases the volume fraction of particles in a given dispersion resulting in higher separation distances between the particles and a decrease in interparticle interactions. In earlier studies, the particle sizes of pectin, potato starch, konjac glucomannan and corn starch increased under varied conditions of PEF (Han, Zeng, Yu, Zhang, & Chen, 2009; Han, Zeng, Zhang, & Yu, 2009; Ma et al., 2012a; Yao et al., 2011). The authors interpreted the increase as the reaggregation of particles through hydrogen bonding after the cleaving and degradation of the polymer chains under PEF."
11,Evaluation of the physicochemical properties,"3.3 Evaluation of the physicochemical properties 3.3.1 Mechanical properties of films prepared from PEF-treated dispersions The tensile strength (TS) of the composite films was measured to evaluate the degree of macromolecular interactions and cohesive forces between aggregated spheres in the films. The effect of PEF on TS was summarised in the Supplementary data Table S3 and described using the second-order polynomial model in Eq. (12) (R 2 = 89.71%). Increasing E and f can give higher TS, but these effects can decrease at higher levels of Q. Fig. 4a-c shows that high TS can be obtained from the medium-intensity field strength and at very low or high energy. (12) Tensile strength TS MPa = 14.21 + 9.77 E + 0.07 f – 0.03 Q – 1.98 E 2 – 1.59 × 10 − 4 f 2 + 3.3 × 10 − 5 Q 2 A closer examination of the contribution due to f (Fig. 4b-c) revealed that very high or low frequency could also decrease the TS. These results agree with the trend observed in the depolymerisation and dissociation effect of PEF on biomacromolecules (Hong, Chen, et al., 2016; Hong, Zeng, et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2011). Hong, Zeng, et al. (2016) reported an increase in the rate of depolymerisation of starch granules with subsequent increases in hydrophobic binding sites at an increasing intensity of the field strength (E = 1.5–2.5 kV/cm). Generally, a ZN–CS system exhibit poor tensile strength and low flexibility due to the brittle nature of their linkages, such as covalent bonding (disulphide cross-linking) and hydrophobic interactions. However, electrosteric stabilisation of the compounds in the colloidal phase due to the development of an intermix with PVOH and PEG can modify the interaction properties of ZN and CS. Subsequently, the process can modify the physicochemical properties of the developed films (Deng et al., 2018; Giteru et al., 2019). Upon exposure to PEF, the occurrence of electrochemical reactions yielding the reactive oxygen species and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) coupled with the polarisation effect may have caused dissociation and modification of the inter-chain binding reactions of the molecules (Castro, Swanson, Barbosa-Cánovas, & Dunker, 2001; Zhao et al., 2012). This phenomenon can mostly be related to the bond dissociation in large molecules (CS and ZN), which increased the number of intermolecular interactions between biopolymeric chains. Therefore, most likely, the higher interactions between the polymers and the plasticiser reduced the cohesive energy density (CED) (e.g. ZN-ZN), increased the compatibility of the compounds, and subsequently reduced the brittleness of the films (Alizadeh & Behfar, 2013; Ramos, Fernandes, Silva, Pintado, & Malcata, 2012). Fig. 4d-f shows the effect of various combinations of PEF variables on Young's' modulus of elasticity (EM). Increasing the linear terms of E, Q or the quadratic term of f 2 resulted in lower EM (R 2 = 92.83) (Supplementary data, Table S4). However, the linear term of the frequency, the quadratic term of Q 2 or the two-way interaction of E·f resulted in higher EM (Eq. (13)). The data suggests that, while PEF resulted in the crosslinking of the film, extremely high-intensity PEF resulted in stronger intermolecular interactions, increasing the rigidity of the films. Owing to the enhanced exposure of binding surfaces, higher intensity PEF may have increased intermolecular interactions through stronger hydrophobic and covalent interactions, thus higher brittleness (Floury et al., 2006). (13) Young ' s Modulus EM MPa = 460.40 – 5.57 E + 0.40 f – 0.50 Q − 1.37 × 10 − 3 f 2 + 6.21 × 10 − 4 Q 2 + 0.13 E · f On the other hand, an increase in EM with increasing f may be attributed to the increase in the crosslinking and packing density of molecular chains while minimising the brittleness due to high CED of individual polymers. Due to the reliance on the PEF mechanisms of electrolysis and polarisation (Ma et al., 2012a; Mazurkiewicz, Kołoczek, & Tomasik, 2015), the effect of the frequency on EM can be related to the following: firstly, at high frequency, rapid molecular perturbations per unit time may have impaired the build-up of the ions and the polarisation effect. This process led to exposure of fewer binding sites for the establishment of inter-chain linkages. Thus, extremely high f could have been below the Ic for particle modification. Secondly, a higher density of pulses per unit time could have reduced the total residence time (t PEF ) of the sample under PEF treatment for the delivery of the same energy, which could impair the effectiveness of the PEF mechanisms. In the current study, a moderate pulse frequency may have resulted in electrostatic stabilisation of ZN and other biomacromolecules in the colloidal state, which allowed gradual interactions of the compounds, for example, through hydrophobic interactions during solvent evaporation, resulting in the formation of a compact film structure (Giteru, Cridge, Oey, Ali, & Altermann, 2020). The highest EM of the films was obtained at a field strength of 3.5 kV/cm, frequency of 175 Hz and specific energy of ~100 kJ/kg. 3.3.2 Erosion index (Ei) of films prepared from PEF-treated ZCP dispersions The polynomial model predicting the Ei shows that an increase in the linear terms of f and Q could result in higher disintegration of the films in water (p < 0.05) (Eq. (14)). Highly erodible films are characterised by higher affinity to water molecules, which relates to the wetting ability of the material in the application environment. (14) Erosion index Ei % = 33.53 + 0.02 f + 7.10 × 10 − 3 Q – 6.5 × 10 − 5 f 2 – 6.0 × 10 − 6 Q 2 Moreover, the ability to bind water increases at high availability of hydrophilic heads, e.g. COO– and –OH, which could occur after disaggregation of the polymer chains under PEF (Han, Zeng, Zhang, & Yu, 2009). Fig. 5b shows that the films exhibited lower erosion index at low Q (<200 kJ/kg) and low or high f (50 Hz or > 250 Hz). These findings were in agreement with the polynomial model (Eq. (14)) demonstrating that the quadratic terms of f 2 or Q 2 may result in reduced degradation of the films (R 2 = 84.73). From these results, it is clear that the Ic for the modification process occurred at the low levels of Q, perhaps where adequate partial unfolding and disintegration favoured network formation in the continuous film. Similarly, Ic could be defined using the pulse frequency, where a low or extremely high perturbation rate allowed adequate fusion of the particles to form a compact film. Interparticle coalescence is driven by higher charge density, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the dispersion (Sun et al., 2011; Wu, Zhao, Yang, Yan, & Sun, 2016), which was different at varying intensities of PEF parameters. These findings suggest that enhanced particle-particle interaction at controlled PEF-intensity can increase the crosslinking of the cast films, resulting in lower degradation of the films in water. As the desirable erosion or solubility of the films depend upon their intended use (Laohakunjit & Noomhorm, 2004), the current study focused on the desire for slowly degradable films that can withstand a wide range of handling environments."
12,Effect of PEF structure-property and function relationships of the colloidal dispersions and films,"3.4 Effect of PEF structure-property and function relationships of the colloidal dispersions and films In principle, the physicochemical properties of a film are determined by the intermolecular interactions in the matrix. The contour plots reported in Fig. 5a-c related the functional characteristics of the films to the physicochemical properties of the colloidal dispersions. The data reveal the complex interactions between the selected response variables. Owing to the complexity of these relationships, paired correlations between the responses were insignificant (p > 0.05, Pearsons' correlation), which can be attributed, due in part to the sensitivity to different intensities of PEF parameters. The effect of Q and E on the relationship between G″ and TS can be seen in Fig. 5a. Increasing G″ (at low E and Q) resulted in films of relatively low TS, whereas lower G″ (at increasing levels of E and Q) resulted in higher TS (> 30 MPa), but only when Q remained below 400 kJ/kg. The results show that increasing the viscous dissipation of the dispersion (high G″) affected the coalescence of molecular chains during EISA, leading to the formation of a loose film matrix. This phenomenon was also elucidated by comparing the viscosity of the dispersions to the disintegration of the films in water (Fig. 5b). It was notable that dispersions exhibiting a low viscosity gave highly erodible films, compared to the high-viscosity counterparts. Although the high cationic nature of the macromolecules, e.g. chitosan, tends to increase the affinity of the films to water molecules, possible disintegration into low molecular weight CS under PEF (Giteru et al., 2018a) and subsequent cross-linking improved the strength and durability of the films (Ahmed & Ikram, 2016). Regarding the particle sizes, it was demonstrated that the disintegration of biomacromolecules into smaller particles resulted in a weak microstructure of the films, thus the low TS (Fig. 5c). The high number of charged moieties could have enhanced the ionisation of molecular chains, which increased electrosteric stabilisation effects, hence the impaired network formation (Giteru, Cridge, Oey, Ali, & Altermann, 2020). On the other hand, larger particle sizes may have resulted from higher particle-particle interactions (aggregation/reassembly) after the exposure to high intensity pulse frequency, which were translated into stronger film networks."
13,Optimising PEF treatment conditions for the development of ZCP films,"3.5 Optimising PEF treatment conditions for the development of ZCP films The responses were optimised using the desirability function of Minitab, which was based on the desire for high tensile strength and less degradation in water. The composite desirability (C d ) function was calculated from the BBD data, where the maximum, minimum and average desirable values were determined. The C d represents the weighted geometric average of individual desirability (d i ), where d i = 0, for an undesirable response, and d i = 1, for an entirely desired response, above which no further improvements are necessary (Pena-Serna & Lopes-Filho, 2013). It was notable that a pulse frequency of >100 Hz resulted in the highest post-PEF treatment temperatures (~55–60 °C) when Q was >400 kJ/kg. Thus, optimisation tests constrained the pulse frequency to ≤100 Hz to minimise the rate of heat development. Besides, the pulse frequency of ≤100 Hz gave low erosion index, which was desirable for the study (Fig. 5B). Validation results, including experimental, predicted, and absolute errors for Ei, TS, and EM, were summarised in Table 3 . 3.5.1 Improvements in the mechanical and stability of ZCP films Optimal PEF processing parameters, E, f and Q, for low erodibility were 3.4 kV/cm, 50 Hz and 100 kJ/kg respectively. The low Ei (33.42%) could be attributed to the development of continuous and homogenous film matrices due to the enhancement of covalent and hydrogen bonding among the film components. These interactions also resulted in higher stiffness of the films EM (504.59 MPa) (Table 3). On the other hand, a decrease in E to 2.4 kV/cm and an increase in Q to 650 kJ/kg resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) high erodibility (36.39%) and low EM (450.15 MPa) of the films, which could perhaps indicate that the intensity was above the critical and operation limits for the process. To compare the results of PEF modification with other conventional cross-linking techniques, we prepared the films using thermal processing (70 °C, 30 min) and sodium tripolyphosphate (Na5P3O10) (STPP). Comparisons between unprocessed, PEF-processed, thermal and chemical cross-linked films showed that differences existed in the underlying mechanism of film formation. While non-PEF films exhibited low TS and EM, they also gave a high Ei, which was attributable to the weakened polymer-polymer interactions and plasticiser involvement, owing to the compromised packing of the polymer chains (Fig. 6a). The findings agreed with Perez and Pilosof (2004), who showed that an increase in the entropy and the rate of reactions during gelation of egg white proteins resulted in a random configuration of biomacromolecules. The results suggested that the optimal PEF conditions for the development of films of high TS and low erodibility could be at low pulse frequency and specific energy (Fig. 6a). As shown in Table 3, modification of macromolecules during PEF resulted in stronger interactions, whereas the disruption of macromolecular conformations during conventional heating interfered with the formation of the network as shown by an unmodified TS and low EM. Concerning the thermal effects during PEF, Joule heating differs from a conventional heating process due to the cumulative and short-lived nature (micro/milliseconds) of the temperature increase during PEF (Toepfl, Heinz, & Knorr, 2007). In addition, Joule heating depends upon the electrical properties of the sample; for instance, particles may heat at different rates and magnitudes due to the differences in the proportions of hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface residues. Thus, the temperature increase due to Joule heating is localised and the rate of heating (V 2 /R, where V is the potential difference across the particle and R is the resistance offered by the particle) can vary from particle to particle within a dispersion, which can influence the level of particle modification (Jeyamkondan, Jayas, & Holley, 1999). On the contrary, a conventional heating process occurs by convection and conduction and is characterised by prolonged exposure of the particles to the heating conditions. Thus, this form of heating can easily modify the surface residues and charges of macromolecules, resulting in thermal damage (e.g. unfolding, denaturation, the disintegration of molecular chains, and random interactions of the macromolecules) (Perez & Pilosof, 2003). Compared to PEF-processing, crosslinking the films using 0.5–2.0% (w/v) STPP resulted in lower EM and TS (Table 3, Fig. 6a). STPP cross-linked films (≥ 1% w/v STPP) also showed lower Ei, which demonstrated the role of the hydroxyl and phosphoric ions in establishing ionic linkages with the amino groups of ZN and CS or the hydroxyl groups of PVOH and PEG (Wang, Du, & Fan, 2005). Compact films of high TS and EM were obtainable on processing the dispersions under optimised conditions R1 and R3 comprising of high E (3.4 kV/cm), low f (50 Hz) and low Q (100 kJ/kg) or extremely high Q (650 kJ/kg) (Fig. 6a). The combination of PEF parameters at f = 50 Hz, E = 1.0 kV/cm and Q = 90 kJ/kg resulted in lower TS, which suggested weak inter-chain interactions and development of loose matrices, perhaps due to lack of sufficient surface modification of the molecules. 3.5.2 Improvements in the microstructure and thermal properties of ZCP films As seen in Fig. 6b, processing the dispersions at low frequency/high-specific energy (R4) resulted in low crystallinity but a higher TS and extensibility. The results of the present and earlier studies (Luo et al., 2010) reveal that PEF processing of biomacromolecules has the potential to damage the crystalline regions. For instance, typical crystalline peaks for native CS occurs at ~ 8–11.5o and 19o 2θ, representing crystal form I and II, respectively (Souza et al., 2010) underwent degradation under PEF as observed in the loss of the peak at 8o 2θ. This finding confirms the role of PEF in the disintegration or network development in biomacromolecular systems (BeMiller & Huber, 2015). The results also agree with the increase in Ei according to Eq. (14) and Table 7 implying higher affinity of the matrix to water molecules at increasing levels of specific energy. Availing a high number of hydrophilic sites at high specific energy could disrupt polymer-chain packing during the assembly process. These findings also demonstrated a higher degree of the semi-crystalline structure at low f, and Q (R1) or extremely high Q (R3), which agreed with the results of high TS and EM (Fig. 6a). Generally, instances of structural development were evident at optimisation R1-R3, where new crystalline peaks appeared at 19.5 o, and 22.8 o 2θ, indicating that PEF-induced development of cross-links can influence the microstructure of the films. Souza et al. (2010) attributed an increase in the crystallinity of CS under moderate electric fields (0.1–0.2 kV/cm, alternating current) to a higher degree of deacetylation of CS and production of low molecular weight CS that were more flexible with a higher ability for hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, conventional processing of the dispersions using STPP showed drastic changes to the crystallinity of the films, which was evidenced by the new crystalline peaks at 16.1 o 2θ when 0.5% and 1% STPP was employed. These findings suggested the establishment of strong ionic interactions with the STPP intermediary (Huang & Lapitsky, 2017). The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are summarised in Fig. 7a-d. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the glass transition temperature (Tg) appearing at ~ 80 °C (Fig. 7a). However, compared to the native and STPP cross-linked films, the temperature at the onset of melting (TO) (~160 °C) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) under optimisations in R1, R3 and conventional heating (Fig. 7b). Besides, the melting peaks (TM) for the PEF-treated and STPP cross-linked films occurred at higher temperatures (p < 0.05) than the native and heated films. The high TM under PEF (R1 and R3) and STPP were paralleled by higher melting enthalpies (ΔH J/g), which depicted an enhancement of intermolecular interactions due to PEF and STPP. Conventional heating could not modify TM and ΔH (p > 0.05), which was likely due to higher aggregation of the proteins and destruction of interactions in the dispersion. TS and crystallinity data showed that at 0.5% (w/w of total solids) STPP was more effective in developing a compact film structure, which was attributable to the formation of strong ionic linkages between the hydroxyl groups of the films and the phosphoric ions of STPP origin (Huang & Lapitsky, 2017). The SEM micrographs (Fig. 8 ) demonstrated that PEF processing of the colloidal dispersions could modify the morphology of the films. The surface of the optimised ZCP films was typically more ordered and less defective than the non-PEF samples. The cross-sectional view (Fig. 8iii) portrayed a more ordered and denser microstructure in PEF-treated samples (R1) at E, f and Q of 3.4 kV/cm, 50 Hz and 100 kJ/kg, respectively. In this work, hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG in the PEF processed films may have resulted in the enhanced compatibility between the components, resulting in more compact films."
14,Mechanism of PEF action,"3.6 Mechanism of PEF action Although the exact mechanism underlying PEF modification of biological macromolecules is not understood, the two implicated processes include: (1) the occurrence of electrochemical and electrolysis reactions, which produces the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that have the potential to attack and modify a broad range of organic compounds (Ma et al., 2012b) and (2) polarisation due to the re-orientation of dipole moments resulting in the re-alignment of macromolecules along the polarity of the electric field (anisotropy), which can influence the surface residues and charges on molecular chains (Castro et al., 2001). These processes have several impacts on biomacromolecules: (a) enhancement of electrostatic forces due to modified surface residues and charge density; (b) conformational changes due to modified side-chain reactions; (c) modified cross-linking behaviour of polymeric chains; and (d) depolymerisation of aggregated units or elongation/stiffening of single molecules (Aguiló-Aguayo, Soliva-Fortuny, & Martín-Belloso, 2010; Ma et al., 2012b; Perez & Pilosof, 2003). In this study, interactions establishing the matrix of ZCP films in both the native and PEF-treated samples were HH linkages, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). The processes leading to the formation of these interactions are marked by the following stages: (1) formation of nuclei and the growth of the spheres into aggregates (Fig. 9 ) that include the side-chain interactions between the carbonyl, hydroxyl and amino groups of the partially unfolded protein and the reaction between the amino groups of CS and carboxyl groups of ZN and (2) fusion of the aggregates into larger spheres and ultimately, into continuous sheets during the solvent removal process (Wang & Padua, 2010). PEF processing can alter these processes by causing disintegration of molecular chains or partial unfolding (e.g. proteins) followed by partial reaggregation/assembly due to the exposure of surface-active moieties (Li et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2012b). Furthermore, this process avails the highly reactive sites for solvent-macromolecule interactions leading to particles adsorption into the liquid-interface (Fig. 9) (Perez & Pilosof, 2004; Turgeon, Schmitt, & Sanchez, 2007). From Fig. 9, when the intensity of PEF = Ic, the partial unfolding/ disintegration facilitated protein-protein interactions through hydrophobic associations, affecting the process of nucleation and sphere development (Zhao, Yang, Lu, Tang, & Zhang, 2007). At the same time, the •OH mediated attack on the β-ᴅ (1 → 4) glycosidic linkages in the backbone of CS molecule caused dissociation of HH bonds and weakening of intramolecular interactions on CS chains (Luo et al., 2010). These processes may have facilitated the formation of low molecular weight CS and free amine groups (Giteru et al., 2018b), which are protonated in the acidic environment (pH 5.6 ± 0.1). The ionised groups may have attacked and reacted with the carboxyl from ZN through covalent interactions, leading to bioconjugation reactions (Li et al., 2018). Additionally, the hydroxyl groups on CS (Escamilla-García et al., 2013) and PVOH (Senna et al., 2010) facilitated the establishment of inter-/intramolecular hydrogen bonds with ZN. Concerning the developed films, previous studies showed that PEF-induced depolymerisation may be accompanied by an increase in the surface activity of biomacromolecules, including changes in the ionic strength and surface hydrophobicity (PEF intensity = Ic) (Giteru, Cridge, Oey, Ali, & Altermann, 2020; Li, Chen, & Mo, 2007). Such occurrences could have affected the properties of the resulting films (e.g. TS) in several ways. Firstly, at PEF intensity = Ic, an increase in the surface activity increased the stiffness of solvent-dispersed molecules while establishing multiple attachment points for entanglements and caused establishment of intermolecular HH or electrostatic interactions, which increased the TS on assembly into dried films (Film B, Fig. 9) (Perez & Pilosof, 2004; Yao et al., 2011). On the other hand, at extremely low (PEF intensity < Ic) or high (PEF intensity > Ic) PEF intensity, inadequate/excessive surface ionisation of macromolecules may have impaired/favoured the process of nucleation and aggregation during sphere development, thus affecting the formation of coacervates and ultimately the firmness of the microstructure of the films after fusion (Film C, Fig. 9). These extremes may have resulted from reduced/excessive disaggregation of biomacromolecules, for example, the unfolding/denaturation of proteins to give surface hydrophobicity (Li et al., 2007). These findings demonstrate that specific energy, pulse density, treatment duration and the voltage density were significant determinants of the level of PEF-induced modification of the dispersions and the resulting films. While a range of PEF parameters was identified for effective modification of the dispersions and improvement of film properties, there were some limitations. These include the instability of the dispersion due to the differences in the interfacial properties of ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG in the ethanol/water solvent system. Even though the 60% ethanol was not ideal for the stability of zein solutions (Kim & Xu, 2008), an earlier optimisation study reported the solvent system as the optimal for the development of dispersions and films from the intermix of the four macromolecules (Giteru et al., 2019). The large absolute error of the predicted responses under TS (Table 3) was also reflected in the second-order polynomial model (R 2 = 89.71%, R a 2 = 81.98%) (Supplementary data, Table S4) reflecting the high uncertainty due to uncontrolled variables, such as the influence of the nature of molecular interactions by the stability of interfacial layers. Further, the maximum attainable level of PEF parameters was limited (Table 1) due to the solvent composition (60% v/v ethanol) to prevent spark and ignition development. The findings of the study depicted critical limits for the PEF parameters and a range of improvements to the films. It is noteworthy that the interpretation of results was a challenge due to the complexity of interactions between the PEF parameters and the range of structural modifications observed in the films. Thus, the results of the optimisation process provide the best view of the interaction effects and the likely outcomes. Additionally, because the mechanisms involved in the PEF-induced modifications are still in the process of elucidation and that the setup of a PEF process may vary according to the engineering aspects of the equipment (Jaeger et al., 2014), it is observed that different setup may yield different results."
15,Conclusions,"This study presented, for the first time in literature, the unique potential of using PEF as a pre-treatment in the development of thin biodegradable films without the use of chemical cross-linkers. The characteristics of thin films, including the tensile properties and water stability, provide detailed information on their integrity and durability. These properties may be influenced by the colloidal status of the dispersions, including the viscosity, viscoelastic properties, particle size and polydispersity index, which can influence the self-assembly of the aggregates into a continuous sheet. These properties can be modified on exposure to PEF. The optimum responses for tensile strength (maximised) and erosion index (minimised) of the films were predicted upon PEF pre-treatment at 3.4 kV/cm, 50 Hz and 100 kJ/kg (field strength, frequency and energy). PEF processing at these conditions transformed the film morphology from amorphous to a densely packed semi-crystalline structure, transforming the films to higher thermal stability than unprocessed films. The enhanced mechanical properties and crystallinity of PEF processed films indicated the potential of PEF to replace conventional methods used in cross-linking."
