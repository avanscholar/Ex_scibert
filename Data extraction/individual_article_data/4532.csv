0,Introduction,"In the last few years selective partial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters) to monounsaturated methyl esters has been gaining greater and greater attention as an industrially relevant process. In fact, this reaction provides an entry into upgraded biodiesel [1,2]. Moreover, monounsaturated FAMEs are also useful synthones for a variety of chemicals which can become accessible through a variety of reactions implying the functionalization of the CC double bond, such as, for instance, catalytic metathesis, oxidation, oligomerization, hydroformylation, hydroaminomethylation [3]. Partial hydrogenation can improve markedly the oxidation stability of biofuels by reducing the content of FAMEs with a high degree of unsaturation (≥3), that, according to European standards (EN 14214), has to be limited to the maximum of 12 wt% for methyl linolenate and 1 wt% for methyl esters of higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (double bonds ≥4) [4]. However, to preserve the cold flow properties of biodiesel, the content of fully saturated FAMEs, as well as the extent of cis→trans and positional isomerization, should be kept as low as possible in the final products. In this ambit the control of regio- and stereo-selectivity is, therefore, a major issue that makes partial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated FAMEs a not banal process. FAMEs are mostly produced by transesterification of triglycerides, obtained from renewable raw materials, with methanol. The characteristics of feedstock used in the transesterification step determine the composition of the FAME mixture undergoing the hydrogenation reaction: the latter feature has great effects on the hydrogenation process and heavily affects the properties of the final product. Commonly used FAME mixtures are derived from vegetal oils extracted from oleaginous biomasses, such as palm oil, rapeseed oil, canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil, jatropha oil, etc [1,2], that contain mono- (C18:1), and di-unsaturated (C18:2) FAMEs as major components, but are free (or show a low content) of tri-unsaturated (C18:3, ≤10 mol%) or poly-unsaturated FAMEs (C20:5, C22:6, etc). Several studies have been devoted to improve the oxidative stability of FAME mixtures derived from the above feedstocks by several methods, included selective partial hydrogenation [1,2,5–11]. On the contrary, partial hydrogenation of FAME mixtures with a higher content of C18:3 (usually 30–60%) has been investigated much more seldom, mostly using Cu supported heterogeneous catalysts [12,13], or catalytic systems based on transition M-complexes (M = Pt, Ru, Pd, Rh) [14,15]. Herein, we focus on the partial hydrogenation of a C18:3-rich FAME mixture mainly consisting of methyl α-linolenate and methyl linoleate (∼3.5:1 mol/mol). The used FAME material is a good model to study the whole spectrum of transformations C18:3 → C18:2 → C18:1 → C18:0 occurring in the partial hydrogenation of FAME mixtures derived from non edible oils with a high content of trienes C18:3 (linseed oil, Plukenetia Volubilis seed oil, oils from certain micro-algae, etc [16,17]). Pd on carbon (Pd/C) has been used as the catalyst of the process. Palladium has been recognized as one of the most promising metals for partial hydrogenation of CC bonds of polyunsaturated FAMEs [1,2] and Pd/C offers a few important practical advantages such as, for instance, low cost and availability of the support, easy metal recovery [18]. Pd/C catalysts [19–28], also a few ones commercially accessible [19–23], have been used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils [21,22,28], unsaturated fatty acids [23], and FAME mixtures [19,20,24–27] containing mainly mono- (C18:1) and di-unsaturated (C18:2) FAMEs, but, to the best of our knowledge, the use of Pd/C based catalysts to promote partial hydrogenation of C18:3 rich FAME mixtures to monoenes has not been matter of dedicated studies. In the present study the hydrogenation process was carried out over a reliable commercial Pd/C catalyst. This choice provided a reasonable starting point to investigate the influence of a few experimental parameters (temperature, time, solvent) on key features of the process, such as C18:1 productivity and selectivity, as well as the formation of cis/trans and positional isomers. 1 1 Recent studies on partial hydrogenation of palm or canola biodiesel promoted by Pd/MCM-41 or Pd/SBA-15 have highlighted the role of the support properties (pore size, acidity) in influencing C18:1 productivity and cis-trans selectivity [29,30]. The hydrogenation process has been investigated in a non-polar solvent such as n-heptane, under mild conditions (0–60 °C; PH2 = 0.1 MPa). The results have been compared with those obtained under solventless conditions and in polar or protic solvents."
1,Materials and methods,
2,General,"2.1 General Manipulations performed under an inert atmosphere (N2) were carried out by using vacuum line techniques. The FAME mixture was a commercial product (Methyl Linolenate technical, 70–80% (GC), Sigma-Aldrich) used as purchased and containing methyl (9Z-12Z-15Z)-octadecatrienoate (methyl α-linolenate; 74.5 mol%) and methyl (9Z-12Z)-octadecadienoate (methyl linoleate; 21.5 mol%) as main components. For further details on the composition of the used FAME mixture see, for instance, Table 3 (or also Table 5 or 7). H2 (99.9999% purity) was generated electrolytically by means of a hydrogen generator (DBS Mod. NMH2-250). The catalyst (Pd/C; Pd, 5%) was a commercial product (Lancaster Synthesis). It was dried under vacuum for 1 h at 150 °C before use. GC analyses were carried out with a TRACE™ 1310 GC equipped with a flame ionization detector; capillary column: BPX-70 (70% cyanopropyl polysilphenylene-siloxane), 120 m, i.d. 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.20 μm; detector/injector: 250 °C/225 °C; oven: 100 °C/10 °C/min/140 °C/5 °C/min/165 °C (20 min)/1 °C/min/170 °C (10 min)/1 °C/min/180 °C (10 min)/10 °C/min/220 °C (10 min); injected volume: 1 μL; split ratio: 100/1. The fatty acid esters were identified by their elution times with known standards. Hereafter, the locutions “monoene (C18:1) component”, “diene (C18:2) component” and “triene (C18:3) component” refer, respectively, to the total amount of cis/trans mono-unsaturated, cis/trans di-unsaturated and cis/trans tri-unsaturated FAMEs present in the reaction mixture, irrespective of the position of CC double bonds. The conversion of the starting C18:m (m = 2, 3) mixture (CC18:m), the yield of monounsaturated C18:1 FAMEs (YC18:1), the selectivity to C18:1 monoenes (SC18:1) were respectively calculated by means of Equations (1)–(3), where mol° C18:m (m = 2, 3) are the initial moles of the C18:m (m = 2, 3) component, mol C18:m,consumed are the consumed moles of C18:m (m = 2, 3) polyenes, and Δmol C18:m is the molar increment (Δmol > 0) of the component C18:m (m = 0, 1, 2) relative to the initial value. (1) C C 18 : m ( m = 2,3 ) = m o l C 18 : 3 , c o n s u m e d + m o l C 18 : 2 , c o n s u m e d m o l ° C 18 : 3 + m o l ° C 18 : 2 × 100 (2) Y C 18 : 1 = Δ m o l C 18 : 1 m o l ° C 18 : 3 + m o l ° C 18 : 2 × 100 (3) S C 18 : 1 = Δ m o l C 18 : 1 Δ m o l C 18 : 2 + Δ m o l C 18 : 1 + Δ m o l C 18 : 0 × 100 The selectivity to cis-C18:1 monoenes (S cis-C18:1) has been expressed as the molar ratio between the moles of cis-C18:1 monoenes formed, Δmol cis-C18:1 (Δmol > 0), and the overall moles of C18:1 monoenes obtained (Equation (4)). Likewise, the selectivity to C18:1(n-x) monoenes (x = 9 or 6), SC18:1(n-x), was given by the ratio of the moles of C18:1(n-x) monoenes formed, Δmol C18:1(n-x) (Δmol > 0), over the total moles of C18:1 monoenes produced (Equations (5) and (6)). S cis-C18:1 measures the extent of cis→trans isomerization for the C18:1 component. SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) provide a useful tool for comparing, respectively, the formation of the positional isomers C18:1(n-9) and C18:1(n-6).

3,Catalytic hydrogenation of the FAME mixture: general procedure,"2.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of the FAME mixture: general procedure Into a Schlenck tube, equipped with a screw cap and a torion stopcock, the catalyst (∼50 mg), the FAME mixture (1 mL) and the solvent (5 mL), if used, were introduced under an inert gas (N2) stream. The mixture was frozen using a cold bath and, after removing N2 under vacuum, was heated to the working temperature (0–60 °C). The reactor was then connected to a gas bag filled with hydrogen (excess) at atmospheric pressure. The suspension was reacted for a pre-established time and, then, filtered. The liquid phase, suitably diluted, was analyzed by GC."
4,Results,"Table 1 shows that the C18:3-rich feedstock considered in this study can be partially hydrogenated to monoenes over Pd/C under very mild solventless conditions (0–20 °C; 0.1 MPa H2). A relatively slow reaction was observed under the working conditions. At 20 °C, the C18:3 component practically disappeared within 6 h, while halving of the diene component needed a time as long as 22 h (Table 1). After this time the C18:1 component was prevailing, but a dramatic increase of stearate level (∼42%) was observed. At 0 °C, the hydrogenation reaction was noticeably slower: significant amounts of the triene component were still present in the reaction mixture after a reaction time of 6 h (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). At this temperature the system became visibly more and more viscous with the progress of the hydrogenation reaction. Nevertheless, at 0 °C the hydrogenation process was, as a whole, more selective than at 20 °C Accordingly, at 0 °C, C18:1 productivity (YC18:1), measured at comparable values of conversion (CC18:m), was markedly higher than at 20 °C. A markedly faster reaction was observed in n-heptane (Table 2 ). Fig. 2 illustrates the results obtained in the hydrocarbon solvent at 0 °C, under otherwise analogous conditions (0.1 MPa H2; catalyst load: 5.7 wt%). The C18:3 component was almost quantitatively consumed within 1.5 h, while the formation of methyl stearate was practically quantitative (>95%) within 6 h (Fig. 2a). The conversion of the C18:3 component resulted in the accumulation of the diene component, that, after reaching a maximum, decreased because of C18:2 → C18:1 hydrogenation. Both yield and selectivity to C18:1 monoenes increased over time and reached, respectively, the value of 72.8% and 91.3% after 2 h, when polyene conversion was close to 80%, (Fig. 2c). However, both of them vanished for longer reaction times (∼6 h) because of the hydrogenation of C18:1 monoenes to stearate (Fig. 2a). The selectivity to cis-C18:1 (S cis-C18:1) was as high as 73.6% after 1 h (Fig. 2c), but decreased with the progress of the conversion, and dropped to 64.2% after 2 h with the concomitant increase of trans-C18:1 isomers (Fig. 2b). The values of SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) indicate that formation of C18:1(n-9) monoenes is moderately more favored than that of the corresponding C18:1(n-6) regioisomers. As a whole, the sum of SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) was close to 70% when polyene conversion was around 80%. The reaction in n-heptane was investigated also at higher temperatures (Tables 2 and 3 ). After 2 h at 20 °C, a sensibly higher polyene conversion (92.9%) was observed (Fig. 3 c and Table 2), because of the faster consumption of both C18:3 and C18:2 components whose relative abundances dropped to 0.5 and 6.5%, respectively (Table 3): after this time the yield of C18:1 (81.8%) was markedly higher than at 0 °C (72.8%), while SC18:1 decreased only a little (88.1% vs 91.3% at 0 °C). However, the selectivity to cis-C18:1, that was close to 64% after 1 h (Fig. 3c), when CC18:m was still moderate (62.2%), went down to 33.5% after a reaction time of 2 h, because of the major formation of trans-C18:1 monoenes (Fig. 3b). The (temporary) accumulation of trans-monoenes vs. cis-monoenes is due not only to the cis→trans isomerization side-reaction, but reflects also the fact that trans-disubstituted C=C bonds are hydrogenated less easily than the cis-disubstituted ones [31]. Also at 20 °C C18:1(n-9) monoenes formed preferentially relative to C18:1(n-6) isomers. At the higher temperature of 40 °C the conversion of both the C18:3 and C18:2 components was practically complete within 1.5 h, but, after this time, the formation of methyl stearate (45.3%) was no longer negligible (Tables 2 and 3). The above experiments emphasize that both reaction time and temperature play a key role in controlling yield and selectivities. 2 2 Actually, catalyst loading is another factor affecting yield and selectivity. For instance, related experiments concerning the partial hydrogenation over Pd/C (15 °C, 0.1 MPa of H2, 45 min; n-heptane as solvent) of a FAME mixture consisting mainly of methyl linoleate (∼75 mol%) and methyl oleate (∼12 mol%) showed that the higher the catalyst load the faster the conversion into C18:1, but both C18:1 yield and selectivity became progressively less satisfactory because of increasing stearate formation. As an example, varying the catalyst load from 2 to 8%, CC18:2 increased from 87% to 99%, but YC18:1 decreased from 83% to 42% and SC18:1 from 95% to 43%. This aspect was further investigated. Fig. 4 summarizes the results obtained in the temperature range 0–60 °C after a reaction time as short as 1 h (see also Tables 4 and 5 ). As expected, the higher the temperature the faster the conversion of the polyunsaturated components (Fig. 4c). Initially, also YC18:1 and SC18:1 increased with temperature, but, afterwards, they decreased after reaching a maximum at the temperature of 50 °C. At the highest temperature investigated (60 °C), yield and selectivity to C18:1 became less satisfactory because of the higher incidence of stearate formation (Fig. 4a). The best compromise between polyene-conversion (82.9%) and C18:1 yield (81.1%) and selectivity (97.8%) was reached at 50 °C (Table 4). After 1 h at this temperature S cis-C18:1 was 51.5%, while SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) were close to 30% and 23%, respectively (Table 4). Fig. 4c shows that S cis-C18:1, as well as SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) (albeit more slowly), decreased progressively with the increase of temperature because of the growing incidence of both cis→trans isomerization and double bond migration, besides full hydrogenation of the relevant C18:1 components to stearate: the decrease of selectivity was faster at the highest temperatures investigated (>50 °C). The hydrogenation of the FAME mixture was studied also in more polar solvents than n-heptane, such as THF, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and MeOH (Tables 6 and 7 ). In the latter solvents the hydrogenation reaction proceeded more slowly and less selectively than in n-heptane: CC18:m was still moderate (38–68%) after 1 h at 50 °C and SC18:1 was around 55–65%. Consequently, also C18:1 productivity (YC18:1: 23–40%) was lower than in n-heptane (Table 6). The lowest conversion was registered in DMC. Under the working conditions, the change of solvent neither improved the selectivity towards C18:1(n-9) and/or C18:1(n-6) regioisomers (SC18:1(n-9): 26–28%; SC18:1(n-6): 20–21%), nor affected significantly the selectivity towards the cis-C18:1 component (58–62%)."
5,Discussion,"Partial hydrogenation of FAMEs (as well as vegetable oils) has been usually studied under solventless conditions. In this ambit the use of an auxiliary solvent as reaction medium has been explored sporadically and has been circumscribed to organic solvents, such as alcohols (MeOH [25,26], EtOH [32]) and, less frequently, hydrocarbons (n-hexane [19], n-octane [33]), or H2O [14,15] or also ionic liquids [34]. We have found that, in the range 0–20 °C, the hydrogenation of the used FAME material over Pd/C proceeded slowly under solventless conditions (Table 1), but the process was markedly faster and more selective towards C18:1 monoenes in a solvent such as n-heptane, poorly prone to interact with the catalytic system [31] and markedly less viscous [35] than the FAME mixture investigated [36,37]. 3 3 At 20 °C the dynamic viscosity of n-heptane is 0.415 mPa × s [35], while the viscosities of methyl α-linolenate and methyl linoleate were, respectively, 4.4844 and 4.9822 mPa × s [36,37]. Under solventless conditions the viscosity of the reaction mixture increased because of formation of methyl oleate (μ (20 °C) = 6.4499 mPa × s) and methyl stearate (μ (40 °C) = 4.9862 mPa × s) [37]. In the hydrocarbon solvent, at 50 °C, under 0.1 MPa of H2, the used C18:3/C18:2 FAME material was selectively (97.8%) hydrogenated to C18:1 with high yield (81%) within 1 h. This result stands very well the comparison with those obtained, under different working conditions, in the hydrogenation of triene-rich FAME mixtures (methyl α-linolenate: 37–60 mol%) with M-complexes of water soluble phosphines in biphasic media H2O/organic phase [14,15] (M = Rh (70–90 °C, 1 MPa H2, 2 h; YC18:1∼78%; SC18:1∼89%; S cis-C18:1 ≤51%) [14]; Pd (110 °C, 3 MPa H2, 1 h; YC18:1 = 64%; SC18:1 = 68%; S cis-C18:1 = 28%) [15]; Pt (60–100 °C, 3 MPa, 5–60 min; YC18:1 = 18–53%; SC18:1 = 30–71%; S cis-C18:1 = 79–95%) [15]) 4 4 The values of YC18:1, SC18:1 and S cis-C18:1 have been calculated according to Equations (2)–(4), using the data reported in the relevant literature. or with a few heterogeneous Cu based catalysts (160 °C, 0.4 MPa H2, 30 min; YC18:1 = 56–62%; SC18:1 = 81–95% [12]; 180 °C, 0.6 MPa H2, 15–60 min; YC18:1 = 43–48%; SC18:1∼83% [13]), 4 known for a long time for their selectivity in reducing polyenes to monoenes [6,38]. The final mixture (Table 5, entry 7) was practically free of trienes (0.1%) and also the C18:2 component (16.7%) was significantly curtailed (by ∼22%) relative to the starting value. Stearate did not exceed 2%. The total content of trans-C18:1 monoenes was 39.0% (Table 5, entry 7), while the ratio (%trans(9)C18:1/%C18:1) was contained within only 8.5%. A markedly lower content of trans-C18:1 (16.4%) can be achieved after 1.5 h at 0 °C (Table 3, entry 3) in addition to a nearly quantitative conversion of the triene component that was reduced to a level as low as 1.5%, by far below the threshold set by the European EN14214 regulation for biodiesel [4]. Under the latter conditions (Table 2, entry 2) S cis-C18:1 was as high as 72.2%, while YC18:1 (59.5%) and SC18:1 (77.5%) were still satisfactory, as well as the stearate level (3.3%) (Table 3, entry 3) in the final product. As a whole, the above results deserve attention for their relevance to the production of 2nd generation biodiesel fuel from alternative, non edible oils with a high content of C18:3 FAMEs, which, in principle, are not suitable for biodiesel production, but have the advantage to be derived from feedstocks that do not compete with food production. 5 5 We explored the recyclability of the catalyst in related experiments wherein a FAME mixture consisting mainly of methyl linoleate (66%) and methyl oleate (27%) was used as substrate. The catalyst, recovered quantitatively by filtration, was dried (see §2.1) and reused in the next run (15 °C, 0.1 MPa of H2, 1 h; cat. load: 5.7 wt%; n-heptane as solvent). A significant loss of activity was observed after the second cycle, as confirmed by the fact that CC18:2 and YC18:1 dropped from 98% and 91% to 41% and 39%, respectively. After the third cycle, both CC18:2 and YC18:1 decreased more slowly and became equal, respectively, to 22% and 19% after 6 cycles. SC18:1 did not change significantly after each cycle (93–95%). EDX analyses of the reaction mixture at the end of catalytic run (after separation of the catalyst) excluded loss of Pd by metal leaching. Moreover, DRIFT analyses on the recovered catalyst did not show the presence of bands due to organic molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Notably, the experimental conditions are not severe, much milder than those used in other relevant studies documented in the literature [13–15]. The latter feature contributes in keeping low the energy investment of the hydrogenation step. In solvents such as MeOH, THF or also DMC, containing functional groups capable of establishing more significant interactions with the catalytic system [31], the process was markedly slower than in n-heptane. This may be ascribed to the ability of the latter solvents of competing more effectively with the reactants (H2, FAMEs) for the active sites on the surface catalyst. The values measured for S cis-C18:1 (58–62%), SC18:1(n-9) (26–28%), and SC18:1(n-6) (20–21%) were close to those registered in the hydrocarbon solvent (51, 30, and 23%, respectively) under analogous conditions despite the markedly lower values of polyene conversion (38–68% vs 83% in n-C7H16) (Table 6): these data, together with those of productivity (YC18:1) and selectivity (SC18:1), indicate that in MeOH or THF or DMC the isomerization processes (cis→trans; positional) are in a more advanced phase than in n-heptane probably because of lower availability of H2 at the surface catalyst due to the reasons explained above. This slows down the conversion of the C18:3 and C18:2 polyenes into less unsaturated species and, therefore, enhances the incidence of those side-reactions, such as geometric and positional isomerization, that do not consume H2 [2]. Figs. 1–3 show that the hydrogenation reaction proceeds through consecutive reactions C18:3 → C18:2 → C18:1 → C18:0. YC18:1 increases more rapidly when most of the triene component (>50%) has reacted and the diene component starts decreasing after the initial growth (Figs. 2 and 3). Afterwards, YC18:1 grows more slowly not only because of the lower and lower concentration of the C18:2 component but also because of C18:1→C18:0 conversion. Accordingly, SC18:1 diminishes after a suitable time (for instance, after 90 min at 20 °C; Fig. 3c). Methyl stearate rises more rapidly after the disappearance of the C18:3 component (Figs. 1, 2a and 3a). Fig. 2a also shows that, in n-heptane, Pd/C can promote effectively the full hydrogenation of the FAME mixture up to the C18:0 stage under very mild conditions (0 °C, PH2 = 0.1 MPa). This result deserves attention as methyl stearate is an industrial relevant product that finds application as intermediate for detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, stabilizers, resins, lubricants, plasticizers. Full hydrogenation of C18:m FAME mixtures to methyl stearate (>95%) has been recently reported by using water soluble Rh- or Ru-complexes at higher temperatures (80–120 °C; 60 min) and under H2 pressure (5–8 MPa) [5,39]. S cis-C18:1 decreases over time because of cis→trans isomerization and full hydrogenation of cis-C18:1 to C18:0. The incidence of both the above side-processes is more significant at the higher temperatures, as suggested by the fact that the higher the temperature the faster the diminution of S cis-C18:1 over time (Figs. 2c and 3c). Accordingly, in Fig. 4c, S cis-C18:1 measured after 1 h decreases with the increase of temperature and the diminution of S cis-C18:1 becomes more marked at the highest temperature investigated (60 °C). According to Fig. 3, when stearate production starts growing more sensibly as a result of the significant reduction of C18:2 component (t > 90 min), S cis-C18:1 decreases over time more steeply than SC18:1 (Fig. 3c) suggesting that cis-C18:1 → trans-C18:1 conversion takes place faster than the conversion of the trans-C18:1 component to stearate. Accordingly, trans-C18:1 monoenes accumulate at expenses of the cis-C18:1 isomers (Fig. 3b). This suggests that full hydrogenation to stearate should involve in the final phases mainly the trans-C18:1 component. Initially, SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) tend to increase with time, but, with the progress of the polyene conversion, both of them diminish (Figs. 2c and 3c) not only because of full hydrogenation of the relevant regioisomers to stearate but also because of double bond migration. Also the decrease of SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) is affected by temperature and is more evident at the highest temperature investigated (60 °C) at which higher conversions can be attained faster (Fig. 4c). The sum (SC18:1(n-9) + SC18:1(n-6)) provides a way to estimate (albeit roughly) the extent of double bond scrambling resulting from double bond migration. Table 2 (see entries 6–7, or also entries 8 and 9) shows that, at a given working temperature, the sum (SC18:1(n-9) + SC18:1(n-6)) starts decreasing significantly for high values of conversion, suggesting that double bond scrambling becomes particularly important when most of polyenes have been reduced to monoenes. Double bond scrambling is favored by higher temperatures, as it can be inferred by the value of the sum (SC18:1(n-9)+ SC18:1(n-6)) calculated at 0 °C and 20 °C or at 0 °C and 40 °C for comparable polyene conversions (in Table 2, compare entry 3 with entry 6 or, also, entry 2 with entry 8). Tables 5 and 3 allow to compare the relative abundances of the single Z-C18:1(n-x) (x = 3, 6, 9) isomers (and, consequently, also their sum) with the relative abundance of the overall Z-C18:1 component: the data show that the extent of double bond scattering among the cis-C18:1 component is quite modest (9–14%) at the lowest temperatures investigated (0–20 °C) but becomes more important as temperature increases (up to 50%, at 60 °C; Table 5) or for longer times (in Table 3, compare entry 4 with entry 2 (at 0 °C), or entry 8 with entry 6 (at 20 °C)). Anyway, under the working conditions, the formation of methyl oleate was found to be preferential relative to that of the Z-C18:1(n-6) and Z-C18:1(n-3) regioisomers. A different regioisomeric distribution can be noticed among the E-C18:1 component where elaidate (E-C18:1(n-9)) forms generally in minor amounts relative to the E-C18:1(n-6) isomer. It is commonly accepted that hydrogenation of polyenes containing double bonds separated by single methylene units may pass through the intermediate formation of conjugated dienes [40], that are hydrogenated more rapidly than monoenes or polyenes with double bonds separated by several methylene units [31,40]. This accounts for the easier hydrogenation of polyenes such as, for instance, methyl α-linolenate or methyl linoleate relative to monoenes, such as methyl oleate, or also polyenes with double bonds separated by more than one CH2 group [40]. The above remarks may also provide the key to interpret, in Table 5, the fact that the isomer 9Z,15Z-C18:2 tends to accumulate (albeit at a moderate extent) relative to the isomeric species 12Z,15Z-C18:2 and 9Z,12Z-C18:2. This behavior is particularly evident at the lowest temperatures investigated, 0–35 °C (entries 2–4, Table 5), at which C18:1 yield was still moderate after 1 h (entries 1–3, Table 4). 6 6 In the temperature range 0–35 °C, after 1 h, the sum of the relative abundances of the different C18:2 isomers reported in Table 5 is quite close to the abundance of the overall C18:2 component, supporting that, under the working conditions (1 h; 0–35 °C; Table 5), the formation of additional C18:2 isomeric species occurs at a limited extent. The reason may be twofold: (i) the reduction of the middle C12–C13 double bond of the starting triene, which is part of both the conjugatable diene systems A and B (Scheme 1 ), is more likely than that of the C15–C16 and C9–C10 double bonds; moreover, (ii) the isomer 9Z,15Z-C18:2 is hydrogenated more slowly than the isomers 9Z,12Z-C18:2 and 12Z,15Z-C18:2, as the two cis-double bonds of the diene 9Z,15Z-C18:2 are reciprocally more distant than those of the 9Z,12Z- and 12Z,15Z-C18:2 isomers and, consequently, are expected to exhibit a reactivity close to that of the less reactive CC double bond of a cis-C18:1 monoene (see above). Accordingly, at the higher temperatures of 45 °C and 50 °C, (entries 6 and 7, Table 5), at which both conversion and C18:1 yield were markedly higher after 1 h (entries 5 and 6, Table 4), the 9Z,15Z-C18:2 isomer was still detectable in analytically significant amounts (4.4–2.5%) in the reaction mixture, differently from the isomers 9Z,12Z-C18:2 and 12Z,15Z-C18:2 that were detected in traces. In n-heptane, methyl α-linolenate is not significantly involved in cis/trans isomerization side processes. In fact, no significant increase or accumulation of geometric isomers of the starting triene was observed (Tables 3 and 5). The hydrogenation of methyl α-linolenate, therefore, is kinetically favored over the cis→trans isomerization of the double bonds of trienes. At the working temperature of 50 °C, these side-processes are more evident, although of modest importance, in THF, MeOH and DMC (Table 7) also in virtue of the lower hydrogenation rate in these solvents."
6,Conclusions,"A C18:3 rich FAME mixture, mainly consisting of a ∼3.5:1 (mol/mol) methyl α-linolenate/methyl linoleate mixture, has been partially hydrogenated over a Pd/C (Pd, 5%) catalyst. In n-heptane, under very mild conditions (50 °C, 0.1 MPa H2, 1 h), the FAME material was converted to C18:1 monoenes selectively (97.8%), with high yield (81.1%). The final hydrogenated mixture was free of C18:3 trienes (0.1%) and showed a very low content of stearate (2.0%). Also the C18:2 component (16.7%) was markedly reduced relative to the starting value. The total content of trans-C18:1 monoenes was 39%. A markedly lower content of trans-C18:1 (16.4%) was attained after 1.5 h at 0 °C. Under the latter conditions S cis-C18:1 was as high as 72.2%, while YC18:1 (59.5%) and SC18:1 (77.5%) were still satisfactory, as well as the stearate level (3.3%) in the hydrogenated mixture. The influence of a few experimental parameters (temperature, reaction time, solvent) on key features of the process, such as C18:1 productivity and the formation of cis/trans and positional isomers, has been studied. High C18:1 yield and selectivity required an accurate control of reaction time and temperature because of tendency of the reacting system to convert into stearate through consecutive reactions C18:3 → C18:2 → C18:1 → C18:0. Remarkably, in n-heptane, Pd/C can act as a tunable catalyst being able to promote effectively also the full hydrogenation of the FAME mixture to stearate under uncommon very mild conditions (0 °C, PH2 = 0.1 MPa) within a relatively short time (6 h). Also S cis-C18:1, SC18:1(n-9) and SC18:1(n-6) are markedly affected by the reaction conditions and decreased over time as much faster as the higher was the working temperature. Under solventless conditions or in polar solvents such as MeOH, THF or also DMC, the hydrogenation process was slower and less selective than in n-heptane."
