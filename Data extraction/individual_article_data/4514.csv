0,Introduction,"In the near future, by transition to a sustainable energy supply, it will be critical to deal with economic needs and environmental goals. This transition will require optimizing and commercializing a diverse area of new clean energy technologies [1]. Today, the main energy sources are fossil fuels, which have many disadvantages, including limited resources, warming up the earth and the environmental pollution. Several attempts are doing to replace fossil fuels with new, safe and green energy sources. At present, hydrogen is used as a raw material in various industries, but it will play an important role in the future energy market. It is a renewable energy carrier, and its resource is infinite [2]. Using hydrogen in fuel cells, will solve many environmental problems such as atmospheric pollution and release of greenhouse gases, and will help to reduce global dependence on oil [3]. There are several ways to produce hydrogen, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Among the industrial methods of hydrogen production three methods are highly regarded: reforming [4,5], photo conversion [6,7] and electrolysis [8,9]. The hydrogen production with water electrolysis is one of the best methods because of several advantages including: hydrogen production with high purity, manufacturing capability with small size and portability, lack of dependence on fossil fuel sources [10] and simplicity [11]. Despite the above advantages, this method has high expenses and high energy consumption. This is the reason to attract the researchers to deal with the problem. An important factor which influences the cost of this method is the over potential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [12]. Many efforts have been done for reducing this overvoltage. Platinum cathodes are commonly used for efficient hydrogen generation in the electrochemical method. However, this electrode has some disadvantages such as: deficiency of platinum in Earth’s crust [13], its high price and its poisoning probability. To the best of our knowledge, one way to solve the problem is to reduce the consumption of platinum in the electrode structure [14]. Another way is to use a suitable replacement for Pt, and there are many reports introducing modified electrodes instead of Pt containing cathodes [8,15–17]. In this study, iron oxide in bulk and nano sized particles and carbon nanotube modified with iron oxide are produced and simply are used for modification of carbon paste electrode (CPE), in which the Fe source of iron oxides is industrial iron scrap. The modified electrodes are applied for effective electrochemical hydrogen production without using Pt."
1,Experimental,
2,Apparatus and software,"2.1 Apparatus and software Electrochemical studies were accomplished with potentiostate/galvanostate (μ-Auto lab II, Echo Chemie, B.V., Netherlands). The electrochemical impedance was measured with an Auto lab PGSTAT 100 (Echo Chemie, B.V., Netherlands). The software of these devices was Nova version 1.7.8.) The three-electrode system was consisted of CPE or modified CPE (MCPE), Ag/AgCl (KCl 3M) and platinum which were respectively working, reference and counter electrodes. The body of the working electrode was a Teflon cylinder (3.0mm i.d.) that was tightly packed with carbon paste. A stainless steel rod which was inserted into the carbon paste established the electrical contact. For removing H2 bubbles from the electrode surface, the electrolyte solution was stirred with a magnet bar that was closed near the working electrode surface. Dispersion of nanoparticles was done with an ultrasonic probe (Hilscher, UP 400 S), and for filtration of nanoparticles a Millipore setup filter with cellulose nitrate membrane (450nm pore size, Sartorius®) was used. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed at room temperature (25°C) by PHILIPS X-ray diffractometer model of PW1800 (Netherlands), with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ =1.5418Å) and the step time of 0.05°s−1. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with Shimadzu FTIR-8400s spectrometer (Japan). The morphology of nanoparticles was observed by a Hitachi scanning electron microscopy (SEM) model F4160 (Japan)."
3,Materials and solutions,"2.2 Materials and solutions Sulfuric acid, graphite fine powder (spectroscopic grade, particle size⩽50μm), paraffin oil (spectroscopic grade, Uvasol®), FeCl3⋅6H2O, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Merck (Germany). All materials were analytical grade and they were used without any further purification. Multi-walled carbon nanotube with the diameter of 10–20nm and the length smaller than 30μm with the purity of 95% was purchased from Neutrino Corporation (Iran). Before using the pristine carbon nanotube (CNT) it was purified and carboxylated. To do this, CNT was refluxed in HNO3 (9M) at 80°C for 24h. After this stage, the dispersed nanotubes were filtered with a cellulose nitrate membrane (450nm pore size), and were washed several times with deionized water to remove the acids completely. The resultant CNT was dried at 80°C overnight. Convertor industrial sludge manufactured in steel-making process of Esfahan Steel Company ESCO (Iran) has been used as a source of iron ions. According to the ESCO report [18] the composition of the mentioned sludge is presented in Table 1 . All experiments were run at room temperature, and all the solutions of electrochemical cell were deaerated with inert N2 gas (99.95%)."
4,Synthesis of iron oxide (bulk and nano sized),"2.3 Synthesis of iron oxide (bulk and nano sized) To prepare the bulk iron oxide, first 15g of industrial iron sludge was mixed with deionized water and kept at 100°C for 1h, then the residual precipitate was filtered. Second, the iron ions of the precipitate was dissolved in sulfuric acid (solution 1), and then 2mL H2O2 solution (as an oxidizing agent to convert FeII to FeIII) was added into 25mL of solution 1, stirred for about 5min, after that, NaOH (3M) solution (as a precipitating agent) was added dropwise into the stirring solution. Finally, the precipitate was washed and dried at a temperature of 80°C and calcinated at 500°C for 2h to obtain Fe2O3. To prepare nanosized iron oxide, 0.05g CTAB, 90mL deionized water and 10mL ethanol were mixed and kept at room temperature for 24h. Then 2mL of H2O2 solution was added to 25mL of solution 1, and stirred for 5min. Afterward this solution was mixed with CTAB solution in ultrasonic bath for 15min. Finally, the NaOH (3M) solution was added dropwise, and the obtained precipitate was washed and calcinated at 500°C for 2h to obtain nanosized Fe2O3."
5,Preparation of Fe2O3/CNT composite,"2.4 Preparation of Fe2O3/CNT composite For preparation of Fe2O3/CNT composite one of the reported procedures in literature was applied [19]. First, 0.0026g of functionalized CNT was dispersed in 50mL of DI water with ultrasonic probe for 4min. Second, the dispersion was added to the homogenized mixture of 0.27g of FeCl3.6H2O and 1g of CTAB, well stirred, and heated in autoclave at 100°C for 15min. Third, The resultant mixture was filtered with cellulose nitrate (450nm pore size), and the filtrate was well washed with water and isopropanol. Finally, the precipitate was dried at 80°C for about 1h."
6,Preparation of CPE and MCPE,"2.5 Preparation of CPE and MCPE The CPE was prepared by mixing the graphite fine powder with paraffin oil binder (70:30 w/w) to obtain a uniform paste, and packing the obtained paste in the electrode hole. To prepare the MCPEs, various weights of Fe2O3 or Fe2O3/CNT (5–25%) and graphite fine powder were mixed in a mortar, and a certain amount of paraffin oil binder (15–30%) was added. Then the composition was well mixed to obtain a uniform paste. The final mixture was packed in the Teflon electrode body. Before running any experiment, the surface of the electrodes was polished and smoothed easily on a weighing paper, and then washed with deionized water. For electrocatalytic measurements 50mL of the electrolyte was used and its pH was optimized from basic (pH 11) to acidic (H2SO4 2M) media."
7,Results and discussions,
8,SEM images of synthesized catalysts,"3.1 SEM images of synthesized catalysts Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of Fe2O3 (A), nano Fe2O3 (B), acid treated CNT (C) and Fe2O3/CNT composite (D). The size of nano iron oxide particles was analyzed with Microstructure Measurement software, which showed that the size of particles was smaller than 100nm, moreover the mostly abundant are particles with a size between 20 and 30nm. The modified nanotubes with a needle shape were thicker than the unmodified CNTs (Fig. 1D), probably due to plenty of Fe2O3 particles which are uniformly embedded on the surface of CNTs, causing the bigger outer diameter for the tubes [20]."
9,XRD patterns of the synthesized samples,"3.2 XRD patterns of the synthesized samples The XRD pattern of the iron oxide (A), nano sized iron oxide (B), iron oxide/CNT composite (C) and CNT (D) is shown in Fig. 2 with the scan rate of 0.05°s− 1. The pattern of iron oxide (Fig. 2A) is consistent with the 00-001-1053 PDF2 pattern of Fe2O3 (hematite) with rhombohedral crystalline structure. In the pattern, peaks at 33.28°, 35.74°, 49.50°, 54.23°, 62.26° and 64.18° are related to (104), (110), (024), (116), (214) and (300) crystal planes. Also The pattern of nano sized iron oxide (Fig. 2B) excellently match with the reference pattern of 00-001-1053 PDF2. So, the average size of particles can be estimated with Scherrer equation [21]: τ = K λ β cos θ . ( Scherrer equation ) where τ is the mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains, that may be smaller or equal to the grain size; K is a dimensionless so-called shape factor, which usually takes a value of about 0.9; λ is the X-ray wavelength; β is the line broadening at half of the maximum intensity (FWHM), after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, the unit of β is radian, and θ is the Bragg angle with the unit of degree. According to the above equation, the mean size of the iron oxide nano particles is 30.3nm, which is in good agreement with the SEM images. In the pattern of functionalized CNT (Fig. 2D), the diffraction peak at ∼26° corresponds to out-of-plane reflection (002) [22] and the broad in-plane diffraction peak around 43° can be assigned either as (100) or (101) (or a combination of both) of carboxylated CNTs [23]. In Fig. 2C, both peaks that are related to CNT and iron oxide (Fe2O3) are seen."
10,FTIR studies,"3.3 FTIR studies The FTIR spectra of Fe2O3 (A), nano Fe2O3 (B), acid treated CNT (C) and Fe2O3/CNT composite (D) are shown in Fig. 3 . As seen in all the spectra, two peaks at about 480 and 577cm−1 are related to FeO stretching vibration. A very weak peaks are observed for key functional groups that can provide information on the surface functionalization process. The band at 3550cm− 1 is due to the bending vibration of OH in a hydroxyl group. Peaks observed at 3400 and 1640cm− 1, are assigned to the deformation vibration of HOH bonds of physisorbed water and surface FeOH bonds respectively. The weak bands at 1615 and 1386cm−1, corresponded to CO and CO stretching vibrations associated with carboxylic groups (COOH) while a broad peak at 1060cm− 1 is ascribed to a COH stretching vibration. In Fig. 3D, in addition to CO and OH bands, FeO band is also observed."
11,Electrochemical studies,"3.4 Electrochemical studies The CPE was modified with Fe2O3, nano Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/CNT composite. The performance of the electrodes for HER was examined and the important parameters were optimized, separately. According to electrochemical data and electrolyte composition, it can be concluded that the gas bubbles on the cathode are H2, and all solutions were stirred with a magnet bar to remove H2 bubbles from the electrode surface during cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry studies."
12,Optimization of the catalyst percentage in the electrode composition,"3.5 Optimization of the catalyst percentage in the electrode composition The amount of catalyst has an important role in the electrocatalytic processes. In this study, the amount of each catalyst was changed between 5% and 30% (for amounts greater than 30% the electrode consolidation was weak), and the percent of binder (paraffin oil) was kept constant (30%). In H2SO4 (2M) supporting electrolyte, for each MCPE, 50 successive cyclic sweeps were applied on the electrode surface. The last forward half cycles of the cyclic sweeps are illustrated in Fig. 4 . For comparing the HER onset, the potential (Ei ) and the current density (j) at potential of −1.2V were measured for each electrode. For Fe2O3 modified CPE (CPE–Fe2O3), the lowest Ei (−0.59V) was at 5% catalyst with the j of −89.19mAcm− 2, and the largest j (−124.65mAcm− 2) was for 10% catalyst with the Ei of −0.62V. According to the slight difference between onset potentials and considerable difference between the current densities, for the modified electrode, the 10% catalyst was used in the rest of experiments. For modified CPE with nano Fe2O3 (CPE–Nano Fe2O3), the lowest Ei (−0.39V) was at 5% catalyst with the j of −73.51mAcm− 2, and the largest j (−136.53mAcm− 2) was for 20% catalyst with the Ei of −0.41V. According to the slight difference between onset potentials and considerable difference between the current densities, the 20% catalyst was used in the rest of experiments of the mentioned modified electrode. CPE modified with Fe2O3/CNT composite (CPE–Fe2O3–CNT), had the lowest Ei (−0.30V) and the largest j (−116.15mAcm−2) at 20% catalyst, therefore in this modified electrode the proposed amount of catalyst was used in the rest of experiments."
13,Optimization of the binder amount,"3.6 Optimization of the binder amount In this experiment, the optimum amount of paraffin oil (binder) of the paste composition was investigated by 50 successive potential cycles with the scan rate of 100mVs−1. If the quantity of binder reduces to below 15%, the paste would be very dry which leads to weak consolidation. With quantities greater than 30%, the electrode conductivity would be considerably decreased. Therefore, optimization was done between 15% and 30% of the binder, while the catalyst weight percent was kept constant at the optimized amounts in the previous section. The forward scan of the last cycle of these voltammograms is illustrated in Fig. 5 . According to these voltammograms for CPE–Fe2O3 the best binder amount with the lowest Ei (−0.48) and the highest j (−139.07mAcm− 2) was 25%. In CPE–Nano Fe2O3, the lowest Ei (−0.39V) and the highest j (−180.20mAcm−2) was for 15% binder. For CPE–Fe2O3–CNT, the composition with 15% binder had the best performance with −0.30V and −224.23mAcm−2 for Ei and j, respectively."
14,pH effect on the HER,"3.7 pH effect on the HER For this study, various solutions with different pHs including phosphate buffers (pH=4, 7 and 11), and H2SO4 (1 and 2M) was prepared. The HER efficiency was examined in the solutions with cyclic voltammetry and the scan rate of 100mVs−1 (Fig. 6 ). It is obvious in this figure that the best results of all three MCPEs belongs to H2SO4 (2M) which may be due to the higher concentration of hydronium ions in more acidic media. Higher concentrations of sulfuric acid or other type of acids (HCl or HNO3) were not used because of their corrosion concerns. At phosphate buffers an opposite trend is observed, i.e. at the lower pH the current density decreases. The reason of this observation may be due to adsorption of phosphate ions at the iron oxide catalyst surface. There are some reports [24,25] which have shown phosphate adsorption on the iron oxide is strongly pH dependent and by decreasing pH, the amount of adsorbat is increased. Therefor in more acidic media, more area of the catalyst is inactivated with adsorbed phosphate. Fig. 7 compares the last forward scan of the voltammograms of the CPE and three MCPEs at their optimum compositions in H2SO4 (2M). Related to CPE, all MCPEs have better performance for HER, and CPE–Fe2O3–CNT has the best performance among the modified electrodes. This observation may be due to the larger surface area and better conductivity when CNT is used as the substrate of Fe2O3. Also CNT with Fe2O3 may have synergistic effects for HER. To confirm this opinion another CPE modified with 20% CNT and with the binder amount of 15% was prepared (CPE–CNT), and as above 50 successive CVs were applied on this electrode. The 50th forward scan is illustrated in Fig. 7(e), and as shown in this figure the current density at −1.2V is close to CPE–Fe2O3–CNT but its onset potential is considerably greater. Therefore application of CNT and Fe2O3 simultaneously causes to grater current density and smaller onset potential. According to our knowledge there is only one report for using Fe2O3 for electrochemical hydrogen production [26], and all reports were for photoelectrochemical [27] and chemical [28] H2 production. In Ref. [26] which the electrochemical procedure has used for HER, Fe2O3–TiO2 mixed oxide has incorporated Ni–P coating for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Compare to this report the overvoltage for HER in our work is lower. Also there are reports, which applied CNT or its composite in electrode structure for electrochemical HER, and some of them have used Pt in CNT composite [29]. In a recent report that has used vertically aligned CNTs for hydrogen production in 3.7M H2SO4 [30], the overvoltage is about −1V, which is very larger than the overvoltage value of CPE–Fe2O3–CNT. In another recently published paper, MoS3/CNT nanocomposite has used as electrocatalyst for HER [31]. In this study the HER overvoltage is almost lower than Fe2O3–CNT catalyst, but as mentioned in this reference by applying successive cycles the electrode performance is reduced, while in the proposed electrode in our study applying successive cycles does not reduce the electrode performance."
15,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study,"3.8 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study Experiments showed that applying successive cyclic sweeps on the CPE and MCPEs in H2SO4 (2M) improves the performance; such as increasing j and decreasing overpotential (Fig. 8 ). To investigate the optimum compositions, impedance plots (Z) vs. frequency logarithm (log f) for CPE and MCPEs, before and after applying 50 successive cyclic sweeps were obtained in H2SO4 (2M) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. In this study, the wave amplitude was 10mV and two step potentials 0 (near the equilibrium potential and frequency range of 1×10−1–1×104 Hz) and −0.7V (in the active HER region and frequency range of 2×10−2–1×104 Hz) were applied. The results of the experiments are illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 . In Bode plots the wave height is directly proportional to charge transfer resistance (Rct ) [32]. As shown in Fig. 9, after applying successive cyclic sweeps for all electrodes, the wave height is reduced. This means that Rct reduces after applying cyclic sweeps. This observation may be due to formation of metalized centers of iron or may be caused by reduced functional groups on the graphite or CNT surface, when the potential is scanned toward high negative potentials. The results are consistent with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results in the previous sections, and show that Rct for CPE before and after applying successive cyclic sweeps is much greater than Rct for modified electrodes. Fig. 10 illustrates the impedance plots at −0.7V potential after applying 50 successive cyclic sweeps on the electrode surfaces in H2SO4 (2M) solution. As the figure shows, in this potential Rct is in the order of CPE CPE–Fe2O3 >CPE–Nano Fe2O3 >CPE–Fe2O3–CNT, which means that the fastest HER charge transfer is for CPE–Fe2O3–CNT modified electrode. The quantity of double layer capacitance (Cdl ) was calculated with the simulated Bode plots, and the results were 0.440, 0.451, 1.01 and 11.1μF for CPE, CPE–Fe2O3, CPE–Nano Fe2O3 and CPE–Fe2O3–CNT, respectively. This order is probably proportional to the surface area, which is another evidence for higher performance of CPE–Fe2O3–CNT."
16,Steady-state polarization curves for HER at CPE and MCPEs,"3.9 Steady-state polarization curves for HER at CPE and MCPEs Steady-state polarization curves of HER at CPE and MCPEs were measured by LSV at a very low scan rate (2mVs−1) to evaluate their electrocatalytic activities. At steady-state condition and large cathodic overpotential (η), there was a linear relation between η and log j (Tafel equation), η = 2.3 RT α F log j o - 2.3 RT α F log j ( Tafel equation ) where jo is the exchange current density, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314Jmol−1 K−1), T is the absolute temperature and F is the Faraday constant. The values of Tafel slope (b), jo and transfer coefficient (α) are summarized in Table 2 . According to exchange current densities, it can be seen that the activity of the electrodes for HER increases in the order of CPE–Fe2O3–CNT>CPE–Nano Fe2O3 >CPE–Fe2O3 >CPE. Three possible reaction steps have been suggested for the HER in acidic media [33]. First event is a primary discharge step (Volmer reaction): (1) H 3 O + + e - → H ads + H 2 O b = 2.3 RT α F ≈ 120 mV It is followed by either an electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction), (2) H ads + H 3 O + + e - → H 2 + H 2 O b = 2.3 RT ( 1 + α ) F ≈ 40 mV and/or a recombination step (Tafel reaction), (3) H ads + H ads → H 2 b = 2.3 RT 2 F ≈ 30 mV The Tafel slope is an inherent property of a catalyst that is determined by the rate determining step (rds) of the HER [11]. It has been widely accepted that the value of α depends on the rds for multi-step reactions [34]. According to the general model for the HER mechanism, when the rds is Eq. (1), or Eq. (1) coupled with Eq. (2), or Eq. (1) coupled with Eq. (3), the value of α is 0.5. Therefore, b is equal to 120mVdec−1. Other possibilities are, α =1.5 and b =40mVdec−1 when Eq. (2) is rds; and α =2 and b =30mVdec−1, when Eq. (3) is the rds [34]. Here, for the proposed electrodes, the Tafel slopes range are between 110mVdec−1 and 142mVdec−1, and α values are very close to 0.5 (Table 1). Therefore, according the mentioned criteria, it can be assumed that the Volmer step must control the HER at these MCPEs."
17,Chronoamperometric studies,"3.10 Chronoamperometric studies Chronoamperometry technique was used for electrode stability investigation. Fig. 11 shows the chronoamperograms of the CPE and MCPEs in H2SO4 (2M) with the potential step of −0.8V for 100s duration time. This figure also shows that the greatest current density (the rate of hydrogen generation) is for CPE–Fe2O3–CNT and after a few seconds, the rate of hydrogen generation on the proposed electrode will be increased, which means the HER performance increases with time. The results are in accordance with the EIS studies, such as the largest j is for the smallest Rct ."
18,Conclusion,"Bulk and nanosized iron oxide (Fe2O3) particles were prepared from industrial iron sludge as an inexpensive resource. Iron oxide was also deposited on multiwall carbon nanotube. The compounds were used for CPE modification, and the performance was evaluated for HER. To obtain the best performance, some important parameters including pH, binder and amounts of modifier were optimized. For all MCPEs, the best results were obtained in H2SO4 (2M). The HER performance was evaluated at the optimum composition of the electrodes, and the electrocatalytic activities were in the order of CPE–Fe2O3–CNT>CPE–Nano Fe2O3 >CPE–Fe2O3. The as-modified electrodes had promising properties such as decrease in overvoltage with applying successive potential scans, increase in current density and subsequently the efficiency enhancement. According to low cost, ease of large-scale preparation and renewable surfaces of electrodes, the modified electrodes are promising for HER in acidic media."
