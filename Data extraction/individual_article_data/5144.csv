0,Introduction,"Biodegradable materials that can be effectively and sustainably integrated into the environment are attracting attention due to the environmental pollution problems derived from the use of synthetic plastics. Products derived from agricultural resources such as proteins, starch, cellulose, etc., provide a suitable alternative to develop biodegradable materials [1]. Starch is a biopolymer commonly found in form of granules in seeds, roots or tubers of different sources including corn, wheat, potato and rice. In nature, starch represents the main energy reserve of plants and it has been widely studied because of its abundance, low cost, edible and biodegradable properties [2,3]. Starch consists of a mixture of amylose, a predominantly linear glucan, and amylopectin, a high molecular weight and highly branched glucan [4]. Among all starches, potato starch yields the most viscous suspensions and has the lowest temperature of gelatinization. This behavior has been attributed to the endogenous phosphate groups on the amylopectin chains which is unique for potato starch. The phosphate groups are located in the amorphous rons of the starch granules and generate charged groups on the amylopectin chains making the starch susceptible to electrolytes when dissolved in water [5]. Starch is a sustainable alternative to produce biodegradable materials intended for food packaging; however, starch-based films have poor mechanical properties and high rigidity, which limits the applications in material engineering [3]. In order to compensate the poor mechanical properties of the starch-based films, blending with other biopolymers like chitosan [6], gelatin [7,8] and polyvinyl alcohol [9–13] has been studied. The combination of two or more polymers allows obtaining new materials with better mechanical performance and gas barrier properties, which could be a feasible alternative to replace the actual synthetic food packaging materials. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), is the biodegradable synthetic polymer produced at the highest volume worldwide, due to its excellent physical properties, chemical resistance and complete biodegradability [14]. PVOH is a linear-structure polymer, soluble in water, non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. It has a good compatibility with other materials, with excellent film-forming capacity and high emulsifying and adhesive properties, which have resulted in extensive industrial uses [10]. It is approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for human use and it can be used in food packaging applications [15–17]. PVOH films have a semicrystalline structure which results in a lower water adsorption capacity, high tensile strength and flexibility, as well as good oxygen and aromatic barrier properties [10,17,18]. The incorporation of PVOH has been shown to improve the mechanical properties and water resistance of biodegradable packaging based on several hydrocolloids including whey protein isolated [19] and corn starch [9,10]. The combination of these biopolymers with PVOH allows obtaining materials with excellent mechanical performance at a lower cost than if PVOH were used alone. Some blends of starch-PVOH have been developed and evaluated for applications as biodegradable packaging, showing excellent functional properties, suitable for using as food packaging [10,20–22]. Starch and PVOH are compounds with highly polar hydroxyl groups (-OH) forming inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds [9,17], which could improve the integrity of blended films and modify their functional properties. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of different proportions of biodegradable polymers (PVOH of synthetic origin and native potato starch) on the functional properties of their biodegradable films. In addition, as both polymers are hydrophilic, it is essential to assess the water adsorption capacity as an important property when used as food packaging material. The main goal is to obtain a completely biodegradable packaging material while maintaining its physical integrity as much as possible, even in high humidity conditions. The films obtained from the combination of potato starch and PVOH could have a better mechanical and gas barrier behavior, parameters that are desired in a packaging material."
1,Methodology,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Native potato starch, with 30% amylose and 70% amylopectin, was obtained from KMC (Germany). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH, Mw = 124000–186000 g.mol− 1, 98–99% hydrolysis) was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Reagent grade glycerol (Meyer, Mexico) was used as a plasticizer. Supersaturated saline solutions of LiCl, CH3COOK, MgCl2•6H2O K2CO3, NaBr, KCl and NaCl, BaCl2 (Jalmek Cientifica, Mexico) were used to obtain microclimates at different relative humidities."
3,Films preparation,"2.2 Films preparation The film-forming solutions were prepared with 4% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol and 5% (w/v) potato starch. Glycerol (25%, w/w of polymers) was added as a plasticizer. The PVOH solution was prepared by dissolving 4 g of PVOH in 100 mL of distilled water (w/v), the solution was heated at 70 °C while stirring during 2 h. The film-forming solutions were prepared in a 500 mL Kitazato flask, adding distilled water, polymers and plasticizer in the amount required to prepare 100 g of each formulation, according to data in Table 1 , 8 formulations were prepared. For the starch-PVOH films, the potato starch solution was prepared in the Kitazato flask, glycerol was added in the distilled water and stirred for 5 min, and then the starch was added and kept under stirring as the temperature was increased. When the starch solution reached 50 °C, the corresponding amount of PVOH solution was incorporated, mixed for 10 min and increased the temperature up to 85 °C and kept for 10 min, to promote the complete gelatinization of the starch granules. Then, a vacuum pump (Buchi, model V700, Germany) was used to remove the air bubbles formed in the filmogenic solution. 80 g of filmogenic solution were cast into 15 × 15 cm acrylic molds and dried in a forced convection oven (Thermolyne, model Oven series 9000, USA) at 65 °C for 5 h at 1 m s−1 airflow. Subsequently, the biodegradable films were cooled, peeled and cut into the corresponding shape and size for each characterization test. The films were conditioned at a relative humidity of 56% RH for 48 h prior analysis. The films were labeled as SxPy, where x and y represent the weight ratio of potato starch (S) and PVOH (P)."
4,Characterization of films,"2.3 Characterization of films 2.3.1 Thickness Thickness of biodegradable starch-PVOH films was measured using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, model C112EXB, USA, precision 0.001 mm). Measurements were carried out in ten random points on each sample. The results were expressed as average value and standard deviation of at least 10 film samples. 2.3.2 Density Films with 2 cm × 1 cm dimensions were dried at room temperature (~25 °C) for seven days on silica gel (~0% RH). The density was calculated by dividing the dry weight of the film sample by the volume, which was calculated by multiplying the area and the thickness. The average value and standard deviation of 5 samples were obtained. 2.3.3 Water solubility Biodegradable potato starch-PVOH films were cut into samples of 20 × 20 mm and dried at room temperature (~25 °C) for 7 days over silica gel to remove as much water as possible and then weighed. Films samples were placed individually in 50-mL Falcon plastic tubes with a lid and 30 mL of distilled water were added. Tubes were closed and shaken periodically during 20 h at room temperature. The content of the tube was filtered on dry filter paper and dried at 135 °C during 4 h, to determine the weight of dry matter. The percentage of water soluble matter was calculated using Eq. (1). Five replicates were made. (1) W a t e r solubility ( % ) = i n i t i a l d r y w e i g h t - f i n a l d r y w e i g h t i n i t i a l d r y w e i g h t ⁎ 100 2.3.4 Moisture adsorption isotherms To evaluate the interaction of water with starch-PVOH films, water vapor adsorption isotherms were determined using the static method of microclimates developed by the COST90bis project [23], with some modifications and according to the ASTM E104-02 standard [24]. 1-L acrylic containers with airtight lid were used, which contained supersaturated saline solutions of LiCl, CH3COOK, MgCl2, K2CO3, NaBr, NaCl, KCl and BaCl2, to obtain microclimates with relative humidity (RH) of 11.28, 21.61, 32.44, 43.17, 56.0, 75.09, 83.62 and 90.10%, respectively at constant temperature of 30 °C. Samples of 20 × 20 mm were placed by triplicate in plastic supports inside the microclimates, ensuring that the adsorption of water vapor occurred over the entire surface of films. The containers were placed in a chamber with controlled temperature at 30 °C for 15 days to allow reaching the equilibrium. The moisture content was determined following the gravimetric method, drying the samples in a convection oven (Thermolyne, model Oven series 9000, USA) at 110 °C for 20 h. The experimental data were fitted to the mathematical model of Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) (Eq. (2)). (2) X = x m C K a w ( 1 − K a w ) ( 1 − K a w + C K a w ) where X is the equilibrium moisture content of the material (g water/100 g dry matter) at a given water activity (a w ), x m is the monolayer moisture content, C is the energy difference between the upper layers and the monolayer, K is the degree of freedom of water molecules [25]. 2.3.5 Mechanical properties The mechanical performance of the starch-PVOH films was measured using a texture analyzer TA.XTplus (Stable Micro Systems, England), with a tension system A/TG at room temperature (~25 °C). The equipment was operated at a crosshead speed of 1 mm s−1, with an initial separation between grips of 50 mm, according to the standard ASTM D882-12 [26]. Rectangular samples of 10 × 90 mm, were previously conditioned at room temperature during 48 h at 56% RH, with a supersaturated saline solution of NaBr. The tensile strength (TS) and the percentage of elongation at break (%E) were calculated. Ten replicates were measured and the values of samples fractured at the center of the film were taken. The average and standard deviation were reported. 2.3.6 Water vapor permeability (WVP) To determine the water vapor permeability of the blended films, the standard ASTM E96-00 [27] was followed. The permeability cell consisted of a glass container with an internal diameter of 51.1 mm containing distilled water (~100% RH), the cell with the film sample was placed in a permeability chamber with controlled temperature at 30 °C, in the presence of silica gel (~0% RH), generating a differential pressure of 4244.73 Pa. The weight change of the cell was recorded automatically every 60 s during 7 h [28]. The determinations were performed in triplicate. 2.3.7 Thermo mechanical properties Circular specimens with a diameter of 8 mm were cut from the potato starch-PVOH films and tested in a thermo mechanical analyzer (TA Instruments, model Q400, UK) with a penetration probe. Analysis were carried out from 0 to 250 °C, at a heating rate of 5 °C.min−1 and a constant force of 0.2 N. The onset, midpoint and endpoint temperatures of the Tg transitions were calculated using the tangents drawn on the displacement curve. Midpoint was considered as Tg of the films."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis The Statistica v 7.0 (STATSOFT Inc., São Paulo, Brazil) was used to analyze the experimental results obtained by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test with a p < 0.05 significance level."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Films appearance,"3.1 Films appearance The visual appearance of biodegradable films made from blends of potato starch and PVOH were homogeneous, with no visible phase separation or bubbles, translucent and easy to unmold. In all the formulations combining the both polymers, a good compatibility was observed during processing, as well as in the resulting material. In previous research, several authors [10,29–31] have mentioned that starch and PVOH are not compatible, so it is necessary to add compatibilizer compounds such as formaldehyde to avoid phase separation [10,29–31], especially when the proportion of starch is higher than 40%. However, in this research, it was possible to blend potato starch with PVOH following the described methodology with no visible phase separation; this result could be due to the presence of phosphate groups in the amylopectin chains of potato starch. Starches from other sources do not contain phosphate groups, that is why several author reported the use of some additives in order to obtain a stable solution of starch and PVOH [10,22,30]. Tang and Alavi [17] reported that the addition of PVOH to corn starch-glycerol blends prevented cracks on the surface of the films, indicating a good compatibility of starch and PVOH. Likewise, it has been reported the use of substances to inhibit the formation of air bubbles in the solution allowing obtaining homogeneous films [30]. In this research, a vacuum pump was used to extract the air bubbles formed during the stirring of filmogenic solutions. Vacuum was carried out just before pouring the blended film-forming solution into the mold, which allowed obtaining homogeneous biodegradable films with no bubbles or cracks."
8,"Thickness, density and water solubility","3.2 Thickness, density and water solubility Pure potato starch film (S1P0) showed higher thickness values than those of pure PVOH films (S0P1), which were 182.70 ± 8.31 and 109.43 ± 8.69 μm, respectively. The films obtained from the mixtures of potato starch-PVOH had higher thickness values in comparison to the films obtained with pure PVOH (S0P1), which was in the range from 133 to 177 μm (Table 2 ), intermediate values to those presented by starch films (S1P0). It has been reported that the thickness of films is affected by the composition of the formulation [32]. The thickness values are smaller in films whose polymer chains are more linear, and higher in those with branched polymers. Taking into account that the starch used contains only 30% amylose, which are the linear chains of starch; the rest of the starch, that is 70% of amylopectin, has branched chains. PVOH is a linear chain polymer, so, when forming a film, polymer chains can be arranged in a more orderly manner, reducing the thickness of the resulting material. When mixed with starch, it increases the number of linear chains in the formulation, and the thickness varies significantly in each of the formulations; however, the change does not present a linear relationship with the concentration of PVOH. The density of the films made from the potato starch:PVOH blends was higher than that of both polymers alone; however, there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) with the increase in the proportion of PVOH (Table 2), suggesting that the chains are more compactly accommodated in the blended films, which would cause a reduction between the interstitial space of the polymer matrix [33]. The percentage of water solubility of films from blends of potato starch-PVOH was, in general, higher when compared to pure films of each polymer (Table 2); so, combining potato starch with PVOH allowed obtaining more hydrophilic films, increasing the water solubility, mainly due to the increase in OH groups [9,17,34]."
9,Water adsorption isotherms,"3.3 Water adsorption isotherms The water adsorption capacity of pure potato starch, blended and pure PVOH films, in the aw range from 0.11 to 0.90 at 30 °C, is shown in Fig. 1 . All isotherms showed a characteristic type-IV behavior, according to the classification proposed by Brunauer, Deming [35], which entails the initial formation of a monolayer, followed by a multilayer development, until the maximum thickness is reached [36]. The moisture adsorbed by starch-PVOH films increased as a function of the environmental RH and the proportion of PVOH. Similar effect has been reported by other authors [10,37]. Pure PVOH films (S0P1) showed a higher moisture adsorption capacity than pure starch film (S1P0), which had a moisture content (X) of 68.45 and 42.49%, respectively, when conditioned at 90% RH (aw = 0.9). The films made from the combination of the both polymers showed moisture content values in a range between the adsorption capacities of pure films. Moisture adsorption of blended starch-PVOH films increased as the proportion of PVOH increased (Fig. 1). S4P6 (40:60) film containing the higher proportion of PVOH adsorbed 54.28% of moisture at 90% RH. Chai, Chow [10] found similar results in corn starch-PVOH films (40:60) obtained by thermal compression, which could adsorb more than 61% of moisture. This moisture adsorption behavior was probably caused by the increase of available –OH groups when PVOH was added into the formulation [9,17,34]. The GAB model was used to fit the experimental data. The calculated parameters are shown in Table 3 . As the GAB equation has three theoretical parameters based on physical phenomena involved in the adsorption of water, it is considered as the most appropriate model to describe the experimental data in a range of aw from 0.10 to 0.90 [25,37,38], which is the range of interest in foods. In the films evaluated in this study, values of R2 > 0.98 were obtained indicating that the GAB model was suitable for fitting the experimental data. The monolayer moisture content (x m ), represents the amount of water forming the first continuous layer of water molecules on the adsorbing surface of the material and it is considered as the optimal moisture content for storing dry food products [39]. In potato starch:PVOH films, x m increased when the proportion of PVOH increased as a consequence of the hydroxyl groups incorporated into the polymeric matrix. The number of active sites to adsorb water molecules is increased when using PVOH, so that the moisture content required to fill the monolayer increased accordly. The values of K parameter decreased when the proportion of PVOH increased (Table 3). This behavior suggests a higher freedom of water molecules in the biodegradable films at higher concentrations of PVOH promoting the interaction among water molecules; meanwhile, in films with higher proportion of starch, water molecules interact mainly with the polymers."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.4 Mechanical properties The tensile strength (TS) and percentage of elongation at break (%E) of potato starch films, were significantly modified (p < 0.05) as the proportion of PVOH increased (Fig. 2 ), because the PVOH acted as a plasticizing agent. Similar effect has been reported by other authors [10]. TS of films based on blends of potato starch and PVOH increased significantly when the proportion of PVOH increased (Fig. 2A), especially at percentages higher than 40%, although much lower than the value observed in pure PVOH films (S0P1). Mechanical behavior change due to the formation of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds especially when the proportion of PVOH is ≥ than 30% [40]. %E changed in all proportions of PVOH (Fig. 2B), increasing from 93.45 to 484.52% in the S1P0 and S4P6 films, respectively, although without reaching the %E value of 630.19% found in pure PVOH films (S0P1). The increase in %E of potato starch films containing PVOH could be explained by the interruption of crystallinity of starch, due to the intermolecular disruption of hydrogen bonds among starch molecules and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the –OH from PVOH and the –OH at the C-2 or C-3 position and the ring oxygen O-5 in the glucose ring of the starch [34]. Cieśla, Abramowska [41] found that using high molecular weight PVOH resulted in improved mechanical properties of corn starch films due to the formation of a dense crosslinked network of starch-PVOH during the preparation process. Opposite results are observed when using low molecular weight PVOH. It has been reported in the literature that sufficient amounts of PVOH improved the tensile properties of films based on corn starch-PVOH-clay nanoparticles [42]; however, the addition of higher amount of PVOH in these materials resulted in poor mechanical properties due to an excessive amount of PVOH-starch interactions, which could have competed with the interactions between PVOH, starch and the surface of the clay [42]. Water vapor permeability of potato starch:PVOH composite films was modified when the proportion of PVOH increased (Table 4 ). WVP of starch:PVOH films was significantly higher and lower than that of pure PVOH (S0P1) and pure potato starch (S1P0) films, respectively. PVOH is a semicrystalline polymer posing a more ordered molecular structure than the starch, as well as with a higher number of –OH groups increasing the polarity and the crystallinity of films based on potato starch-PVOH blends. The change in composition and the structure could be reflected in a decreasing in the WVP values as the proportion of PVOH increased. An opposite effect has been reported by other authors in similar blends of both polymers [30]. In this study, WVP decreased significantly in starch films with high content of PVOH (S4P6), (p < 0.05), 5.61 to 3.87 × 10−10 g m−1s−1Pa-1 compared to pure potato starch film (S1P0). Diffusivity of water molecules in a polymeric material depends on the crystalline rons, which act as a barrier due to formation of a gel-like structure, which could obstruct the diffusion of water molecules [43]. Han, Chen [30] reported that the use of formaldehyde for the crosslinking of starch and PVOH decreased the water adsorption capability of the films and the gas permeability, by promoting the formation of inter and intramolecular interactions of the –OH groups, reducing the number of hydrophilic groups. In this study, it was not necessary to use a crosslinking agent, due to the potato starch, which naturally has phosphate groups promoting a better interaction with PVOH, besides being a starch with high binding power [5]. Strong interactions between the polymeric chains in the films decreases the permeation of gas or vapor molecules through the structural matrix, resulting in a reduction in WVP values observed in Table 4."
11,Thermo mechanical properties,"3.5 Thermo mechanical properties Tg values of films made from blends of potato starch and PVOH are shown in Table 4. Pure starch (S1P0) or PVOH (S0P1) films showed Tg values of 17.48 or 194.83 °C, respectively. Thermograms of composite films showed a first signal between 31.25 and 38.97 °C, corresponding to Tg of starch and a second signal between 134.51 and 192.60 °C corresponding to Tg of PVOH. The values for both signals were found in the range between Tg of films from pure starch and pure PVOH. Tg is a parameter associated with molecular mobility of the system and is defined as a physical change of the amorphous rons in the material promoted by heat. Polymers with Tg higher than the final temperature of packaged food possess improved barrier properties [44], which can be reflected in the reduction of WVP of the obtained films (Table 4). Incorporation of PVOH into potato starch films increased significantly the thermal properties suggesting that increasing the PVOH resulted in a material with a more ordered internal structure explaining the increase in the temperature needed for weakening the structural matrix of films made from blends of potato starch:PVOH. These results agree with those reported by Sin, Rahman [40] for films made from mixtures of PVOH and cassava starch. The S4P6 film presented a Tg of 192.6 °C, very close to that obtained for pure PVOH film suggesting that adding 40% of starch, does not affect the thermal behavior of the PVOH films. This behavior is important as it could be possible to obtain films very similar to those from pure PVOH, but significantly reducing the production cost for these packaging materials while maintaining the functional properties."
12,Conclusions,"Films prepared from different blends of potato starch and PVOH showed good mechanical, water adsorption and permeability in comparison with pure starch films. The addition of the synthetic polymer PVOH, increased significantly the mechanical properties and improving the water vapor barrier property. Biodegradable films made from blends of potato starch and PVOH had a homogeneous appearance, with no phase separation, due to the presence of phosphate groups in potato starch. Films containing 60% (w/w) of PVOH showed the best values of TS and %E, lower WVP and thermal behavior. Because PVOH is a more expensive polymer than corn starch, 60% (w/w) was set as a maximum limit for addition in order to have a material with improved mechanical properties at a low cost; however, regardless the economic issue, it would be interesting to investigate the behavior of starch films with higher PVOH content. In addition, casting was an effective, easy and economical method to prepare biodegradable films of starch-PVOH blends allowing obtaining excellent physical properties with potential applications in the food packaging area."
