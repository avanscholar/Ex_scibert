0,Introduction,"During the last years, the global market of flavors and fragrances has experienced a significant growth due to the increasing demand for cosmetics, products for personal care or pharmaceuticals associated to aging in developing countries [1,2]. Among the most demanded compounds of this market is cinnamaldehyde (CMA) and its derivatives. CMA is a natural organic compound present in cinnamon with exclusive properties that make it ideal for improving the taste of food, beverages and medicines or to be used in agricultural crops. It is an upward market that supposes more than 40 % of the market share as aromatic agent, more than 15 % as an antimicrobial agent, and supposes a benefit of more than 650 Million of dollars as flavoring. Its derivatives, which are obtained from the catalytic hydrogenation of this molecule are no less interesting. From the hydrogenation of the CC bond, which is thermodynamically favored, hydrocinamaldehyde (HCMA), an important intermediate in the preparation of pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of HIV [3], is obtained. The hydrogenation of the carbonyl group produces cinnamyl alcohol (denoted as CMO), which finds application in the synthesis of a large number of flavors and fragrances as a fixative of jasmine, lilac and pink mixtures [4]. It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry in the synthesis of the chloromycetin antibiotic. By successive hydrogenation, hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCMO) is formed. It finds use as a preservative in cosmetics due to its antimicrobial properties. Industrially, these processes are carried out under severe conditions of pressure and temperature, operating in batch mode, which results in high operating, separation and safety costs [5]. Electrochemical hydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an alternative route to catalytic hydrogenation since it is performed under more benign conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure). In this sense, attention has been paid to the coupling of water electrolysis and electrohydrogenation in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) cell reactor, since this system is advantageous compared with the classical process in terms of energy efficiency, specific production capacity, and a simplicity (pure hydrogen production at a low temperature without any external gaseous source) [6–8]. However, literature on the electrochemical hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde is still scarce [9], even more in PEM cell configuration and, in order to improve both the electrocatalytic performance and stability, and taking into account the cost and availability of the active phase of the catalyst, further studies should be carried out. Various factors such as the type of metal [10–12], particle size [13] and shape [14], additives [15–18] and supports [19–21] are found to influence the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for hydrogenation. Platinum is widely employed in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, able to reduce diverse functional groups [22], including CC [23], CC [24], CO [25], CN [26] with molecular hydrogen. It is generally observed that the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols highly depends on the morphology, size and electronic structure of Pt particles [27], parameters that cannot be easily dissociated. For instance, it is reported that metal loading has a great influence on hydrogenation reactions, due to the modification of both size and homogeneity of the distribution of active metal particles [28,29]. On the other hand, El-Sayed et al. [30–32] and Bock et al. [33–35] have reported that structure can be easily controlled by pH (i.e. modifying the NaOH concentration) during the synthesis processes using the polyol method. Therefore, the present work was focus on: i) the study of the influence of Pt loading of the cathode electrode and ii) the modifications of the electrocatalyst by means of changes of pH (variation of the NaOH concentration) during the preparation through the modified polyol method on the electrohydrogenation performance of cinnamaldehyde conducted in a PEM cell."
1,Experimental,
2,Cathode synthesis,"2.1 Cathode synthesis For this study, a series of Pt-m/C-x catalysts has been prepared where ‘m’ refers to the Pt metal loading, which was varied from 10 to 20 wt.%, and ‘x’ denotes NaOH concentration used in the modified polyol one-pot method, ranging from 0.05 M to 0.2 M. Carbon supported catalysts were synthetized using ethylene glycol as reducing agent (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) as described by Baranova et al. [33]. In an initial step, proper amounts of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) were dissolved in 50 mL of ethylene glycol (99 % Sigma Aldrich) and NaOH (99.8 %, Panreac, Spain), whose concentration was modified to the required value in order to control the pH of the solution. The mixture was then heated from ambient temperature to 190 °C for 2 h under constant stirring. Then, the support was added to the solution and cooled down to room temperature under 24 h of stirring. After that, the solution was filtered and washed several times with deionized water. Finally, the catalysts (powder form) were dried at 80 °C oven for 12 h."
3,Physicochemical characterization,"2.2 Physicochemical characterization An ICP (inductively coupled plasma spectrometer, Model Liberty Sequential, VARIAN) was used to analyze Pt content. Prior to analysis, samples were completely diluted in an equimolar HF/HCl/H2O2 solution. A Phillips PW-1700 diffractometer (using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation) were used in order to carry out XRD analyses. The samples were scanned at a rate of 0.02°step−1 in the range 5° < 2θ < 90° (scan time = 2 s step−1). Diffractograms were compared with those of JCPDS-ICDD. A Micromeritics AutoChem 2950 HP unit with TCD detection was used for the Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 pulse chemisorption experiments. For the TPR experiments, samples (ca. 0.15 g) were loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor and heated to 900 °C (at 5 °C· min−1 heating rate), under a reducing atmosphere (20 % v/v H2/Ar, 60 NmL ·min-1). On the other hand, in the H2 pulse chemisorption experiments, samples (ca. 0.05 g) were loaded in the U-shaped quartz reactor and degasified at 200 °C under He atmosphere. Then, after cooling down to 40 °C, calibrated pulses of H2 were added into the continuous He carrier flow until further consumption of H2 was not detected by the TCD system. Pt metal dispersion was calculated as described in the Supplementary Information. A Micromeritics ASAP 2010 sorptometer unit was used for the surface area/porosity measurements, with N2 at 77 K as the adsorbate. Firstly, the samples were outgassed at 180 °C under vacuum (1·10−2 torr) for 8 h. The total specific surface area was determined by the multipoint BET method and the distribution of meso- and micropores was determined by the methods proposed by Barret, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) and Horvath-Kawazoe, respectively. Relative error of the equipment was less than 5%. A SCHOTT Titroline apparatus, equipped with an automatic dosager, were used for the HCl titrations. Samples (25 mg) were immersed in 0.1 M NaCl (25 mL) and basified to pH = 11 with NaOH (0.1 M) under constant stirring. A 0.1 M HCl solution was used as the titrant and was added dropwise (0.01 mL drop−1). The starting NaCl solution served as a blank."
4,Electrochemical characterization,"2.3 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical characterization of the cathode catalysts, by means of the determination of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and degradation degree (through accelerated durability tests), was performed at room temperature using a single cell of three-electrode system coupled to a computer-controlled potentiostat Autolab PGSTAT128 N (Ecochemie, The Netherlands). The half-cell is composed of a working electrode (Glassy Carbon, GC, Metrohm® Autolab, 5 mm diameter), a counter electrode (Pt wire, Metrohm®) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, KCl 3 mol· L−1 Metrohm®). HClO4 0.1 M (Scharlab) was used as electrolyte. Prior to the addition of the catalyst ink, the working electrode was polished with an aluminum oxide slurry (grain size 0.3 μm). The catalyst ink (2 mg of the catalyst mixed with 1 mL of 2-propanol and 8 μL of Nafion®) was deposited onto the GC/RDE with a syringe and dried in air. Before each cyclic voltammetry (CV) test, solutions were purged for 20 min with N2. Then, the thin film RDE was also purified electrochemically by cycling the potential from 0.0 to 1.3 V. Note that all potentials reported in this work are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (Supplementary Information). Optical microscope (MOTIC DMW B1-223-ASC) images were obtained before and after cyclic voltammetry measurements, and thus the distribution of the catalyst material and stability of the inks were examined."
5,Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation,"2.4 Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation Anodic and cathodic inks were prepared by dispersion of proper amounts of catalysts, e.g. commercial IrO2 (99 wt. %, 2 mg· cm−2, Alfa Aesar) for the anode and as-prepared Pt-m/C-x (0.5 mg· cm−2) for the cathode, in a solution of Nafion ionomer (5 wt. %, Sigma-Aldrich) in water or 2-propanol, respectively. Both solutions were sonicated before deposition in an ultrasonic bath (110 W/50−60 Hz, Selecta). The polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion® 115 supplied by Hidrogena (180 μm)) was pretreated previously described [36]. Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared by spraying the inks directly on both sides of the membrane (2 × 2 cm2 active area), thus avoiding conventional assembly step with gas diffusion layer items."
6,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CMA in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor,"2.5 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CMA in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor Electrocatalytic hydrogenation was carried out in a proton exchange membrane cell as the one schematized in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Information), which consists of the MEA detailed above, two current collectors of 2 mm thickness made of Grade 1 Titanium and two porous titanium gas diffusion layers. The previous composition is sandwiched between two PTFE gaskets in order to seal and avoid short circuiting of the cell. In both studies, carried out at 70 °C, preheated Milli-Q water and a solution of 100 ppm of cinnamaldehyde in 2-propanol were pumped to the anode and cathode chambers, respectively (1 mL min−1 flow rate), under N2 purge. In order to avoid the cathodic solution evaporation, a cooling condensation column was installed (−4 °C). Note that the anodic chamber worked in discontinuous (recycle mode) while cathodic chamber operated in continuous. A constant current of 0.05 A was applied to the cell and monitored with a potentiostat-galvanostat Autolab PGSTAT128 N. Organic product distribution (HCMA, CMO and HCMO) from the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CMA was analyzed offline in a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (Agilent DB-624, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm) using He as carried gas. The selectivity to other products (side products such as acetals, lumped together as ‘OTHERS’) was determined from the selectivity to these model compounds to fulfil the carbon balance (see Supplementary Information). At least three replicate experiments were randomized conducted in order to avoid systematic errors. Experimental error was estimated to be ±3%."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Influence of the cathode platinum loading,"3.1 Influence of the cathode platinum loading 3.1.1 Physicochemical characterization of Pt-m/C-0.2 cathodes The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the as-prepared Pt-m/C-0.2 cathodes are studied by XRD (Fig. 1 .a). The diffraction peak shown at 25° (0 0 2) is characteristic of the carbon support while reflections at 39.5°, 46.1°, 67.5° and 80.9° correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) crystalline planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt crystallites, respectively [37,38]. It should be noted that no characteristic reflections of Pt oxides can be appreciated, suggesting the correct reduction to the active phase during the synthesis procedure (modified polyol method). Table 1 collects the main physicochemical parameters of the as-synthetized platinum-based cathodes. Note that the mean particle size was calculated by Scherrer equation from 2θ = 68°, which corresponds to the peak of Pt (2 2 0). Although the average particle size calculated by the Scherrer equation seemed to be barely affected by the platinum loading in the range of study, hydrogen chemisorption measurements allow to observe that the active particle size increased from 3 to 8.6 nm with Pt loading. As a consequence, the chemically active surface decreased to one third. In order to analyze the oxidation state of platinum particles, which are present in the synthesized catalysts, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were conducted. As displayed in Fig. 1.b none of the as-prepared cathodes presents hydrogen consumptions at temperatures below 200 °C, indicating that ethylene glycol (used for the in situ reduction procedure) was capable of reducing a large part of platinum to its metallic state, which is known to be the active phase for the electrohydrogenation reaction. Moreover, the reduction profiles presented similar characteristics with no dependence of the Pt loading, showing two main maxima of hydrogen consumption at 280−300 °C and 500−600 °C, respectively. The first maximum would correspond to the reduction of platinum complex deposited on the surface of the carbonaceous support and not located near metal particles [39,40] whereas that at high temperature is attributable to the gasification of the carbonaceous support catalyzed by the Pt particles [41–43]. This second peak shifts to lower temperatures when platinum is present due to the platinum spillover effect [44]. It can be also observed that as the metal loading increases, and therefore the crystallite size, reduction profiles move to lower temperatures. Table 1 summarizes the textural properties corresponding to each Pt-m/C-0.2 cathode, obtained after analysis of the surface area and pore volume, calculated by means of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. According to the IUPAC classification, isotherms observed on Fig. 1.c can be classified as a combination of types I and IV. The hysteresis cycle shown by type IV isotherms is due to capillary condensation at high partial pressures and is associated with the presence of mesopores [45]. The region at low partial pressure (P/Po) depicts a monolayer adsorption characteristic of microporous solids (specially at the support), which is associated to type I isotherms [46]. According to data summarized in Table 1, it can be observed that, upon diffusion of the active metal to the support, its specific surface area decreases, which indicates a partial blockage of the pores due to deposition of the metallic Pt particles on the support surface. According to the pore volume and pore diameter values, it can be seen that Pt-20/C-0.2 cathode presents higher surface area as well as lower pore volume and diameter. However, cathodes Pt-10/C-02 and Pt-15/C-02 with smaller particle size show an increase in both the pore volume and the average pore diameter. This could be explained by a possible blockage of the micropores present in the catalyst, which shifts the pore size distribution (Fig. S2.a. Supplementary Information) to higher average values [47,48]. Furthermore, in order to know the relative acid-base character of the as-prepared cathodes, acid-base titration analyses were conducted. From Fig. 1.d a slight increase in the relative basicity of the sample can be observed by increasing the Pt content, which could modify the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of CMO. 3.1.2 Electrochemical characterization of Pt-m/C-0.2 cathodes Characterization techniques using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) has been extensively used to estimate the activity of electrocatalysts in a lab scale. In this sense, cyclic voltammetry tests were performed in order to determine the electrochemically active surface (ECSA) corresponding to each of the synthesized cathodes. In addition, in order to analyze the stability of the electrodes, accelerated degradation experiments were carried out (500 cycles at 25 °C in 0.1 M HClO4 with a scan rate of 50 mVs−1.). Therefore, the influence of loading on the surface-structure of Pt nanoparticles is explored in acidic media. Fig. 2 .a–c depict cyclic voltammograms obtained for the as-prepared electrodes. All samples show i) the corresponding adsorption-desorption of hydrogen, which appears at a potential of 0 and +0.25 V vs RHE, ii) the double layer region, and iii) another two peaks associated to the oxidation and reduction of platinum, at a potential of approximately 1.25 and 0.75 V vs RHE, respectively. Regarding the electrochemical response on the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region, it is known to provide a first estimation on the presence of the different surface sites. In this sense, cathodes Pt-15/C-0.2 and Pt-20/C-0.2 present two peaks in the hydrogen adsorption region. In agreement with that reported by Vidal-Iglesias et al. [49], the first one, whose contribution seems to increase with Pt loading, is assigned to the (1 1 0) (in the range between 0.09 and 0.22 V) crystal face planes of Pt. The second peak would be attributed to (1 0 0) step sites on (1 1 1) terraces sites. For Pt-10/C-0.2 both peaks overlap generating a single one corresponding to the (1 0 0) [50,51]. Note that it is possible that this catalyst shows lower intensity peaks due to the amount of Nafion used for the ink preparation, whose interaction with Pt may affect the H2 adsorption/desorption influencing on the peak area. The presence of a more intense (1 1 0) peak may lead not only to hydrogenation towards the formation of undesirable compounds, according to Delbecq et al. [52], but also to a higher selectivity to CMO than (1 0 0) facets, as reported by Peres et al. [53] on Pt concave nanocubes. It should be also mentioned that in this electrolyte solution, the identification of (1 1 1) bidimensional ordered terraces, which are reported as the most favorable sites to allow adsorption of allyl aldehydes in the di-σCO adsorption mode, was not possible. In agreement with that reported by Vidal-Iglesias et al. [49] the contribution of these sites in the 0.06−0.35 V region was disguised by those coming from the double-layer, and that at high potential region overlapped with oxygenated species adsorption at (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) sites. From these figures and data summarized in Table 2 , it can be also observed that as the number of cycles increases (upon 500 cycles), the area of the H2 adsorption/desorption peak decreases, indicating certain degradation of the samples. The loss of active electrochemical area can be caused by agglomeration of Pt particles due to voltage cycling [54,55]. As an example, the particle size of Pt-20/C-0.2 spent cathode was found to increase from 5 nm to 8 nm after reaction (Fig. S3). However, the dissolution of small amounts of Pt from the electrode surface on the electrolyte [56], although could not be quantified, should not be discarded (see Fig. S4). In this context, the cathode with the highest Pt loading (20 wt.%) presents a suitable ECSA value, consistent with that of literature [57], whose increase with respect to that of Pt-15/C-0.2 seems to correspond to the Pt loading proportion between these two catalysts (i.e. 1.33). However, degradation degree was similar in both cases to that of commercial Pt-based catalyst. In this sense, Pt-15/C-0.2 displayed the best compromise between electrochemical surface area and degradation value and could be considered a more suitable cathode for further studies. 3.1.3 Electrochemical hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in PEM cell on Pt-m/C-0.2 cathodes In order to check the influence of the cathode Pt loading on the CMA electrohydrogenation performance a series of experiments was carried out in a PEM cell by supplying 100 ppm of CMA in 2-propanol to the cathode and water to the anodic chambers, respectively. Note that experiments were conducted at a constant applied current of 0.05 A, 70 °C under ambient pressure. Fig. 3 displays CMA conversion and products selectivity obtained per continuous single pass related to each Pt-m/C-0.2 cathode. Results from PEM cell tests indicate that the electrochemical hydrogenation reaction is sensitive to the Pt loading, which has a direct effect on crystallite size, so that a maximum of 23 % conversion per pass was obtained with the cathode synthesized with 15 wt. % Pt. CMA conversion increases with Pt loading up to 15 wt. % due to the availability of more catalytic sites. However, from this load on conversion decreases probably due to the loss of homogeneity in Pt particle distribution as reported by Fuente-Hernandez et al. [29]. Regarding product distribution, it can be modulated, among others, by controlling both the morphology and size of Pt nanoparticles, parameters that cannot be easily dissociated. In general terms, the production of the unsaturated alcohol, through the reduction of CO to COH, has been reported to decrease along the decrease of Pt nanoparticles size [22]. Besides a size effect, the steric effect induced by the particle size is similar to that induced by the lattice plane [14]. From data collected in Fig. 3 and reaction scheme depicted in Fig. 4 , it is clear that due to the presence of CC and CO conjugated groups in the cinnamaldehyde molecule, electrocatalytic hydrogenation results in a mixture of cinnamyl alcohol (CO bond hydrogenation) and hydrocinnamaldehyde (CC hydrogenation). Consecutive hydrogenation of both also forms hydrocinnamyl alcohol although in a lesser extent. It can be also observed that although the selective production of CMO is difficult because the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favored over that of the CO bond, in all cases, the proportion of CMO is higher than that of HCMA. This could be due to the use of Pt as active phase and to the catalyst synthesis method (modified polyol method), which favors a suitable particle size dispersion, geometry and basicity for this purpose. Although nanocuboctahedra with Pt (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) flat terraces facets, usually associated with large particle size, are preferred for the formation of CMO by adsorption of the allyl aldehyde in the di-σCO mode [58], the cathode loading is observed not to have a great influence on the selectivity to the desired compounds in agreement with that reported by Reyes et al. [59]. A slight increase of HCMA is associated to Pt-20/C-0.2, which may be due to the presence of stepped surfaces vicinal to Pt (1 1 1), favouring the production of the saturated aldehyde [60]. Moreover, despite this cathode showed a higher proportion of (1 1 0) facets (i.e. a (1 1 0)/(1 0 0) ratio close to 3.9), which are expected to enhance the selectivity to CMO, the improvement was not significant. Hence, the total selectivity to HCMA, CMO and HCMO was in the range from 40 to 50%, which is in good agreement to that reported under more severe conditions on conventional catalysis [60–62]. 50–62 % of undesired-by-product were also formed, with the highest proportion for 10−15 wt.% Pt, in agreement with electrochemical and physicochemical characterization. The combination of a higher proportion of Pt (1 1 0) facets, lower particle size and basicity than Pt-20/C-0.2 may assist the formation of side products. However, it is important to say that the registered selectivity to those compounds is consistent and even lower than that reported on conventional catalysis using polar solvents, such as 2-propanol [63,64]. On the basis of the above affirmations, it can be said that Pt-15/C-0.2 cathode presents a suitable crystallite size and relative basicity to establish a compromise between conversion and selectivity, comparable to certain conventional catalytic systems carried out under analogous conditions."
9,Influence of the pH in the cathode synthesis procedure,"3.2 Influence of the pH in the cathode synthesis procedure Once a suitable cathode Pt loading was selected, the following step was the analysis of the influence of the pH of the cathode synthesis solution, established during the one pot synthesis-reduction procedure, on the electrohydrogenation performance. To that aim, a series of catalysts was prepared based on 15 wt. % of platinum while pH was controlled by varying NaOH concentration from 0.05−0.2 mol L−1. As-prepared cathodes are referred as Pt-15/C-x. 3.2.1 Physicochemical characterization of Pt-15/C-x cathodes Table 3 shows the physicochemical parameters of synthetized Pt-15/C-x cathodes. From data collected in this table, in agreement with that reported before [31,35], it can be noted that the choice of a suitable pH for the synthesis procedure is another efficient method for controlling the resulting crystallite size, active area and basic character of the cathode. XRD patterns of the platinum-based catalyst prepared under pH control (by means of modifying the NaOH concentration of the synthesis media) display the characteristic diffraction peaks of carbon support at 25° (0 0 2) and Pt (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) (vertical based lines) at 2θ = 39.5°, 46.1°, 67.5° and 80.9°, which are associated to metallic Pt with face-centered cubic structure as commented before (Fig. 5 .a). From data summarized in Table 3 it can be observed that the higher concentration of sodium hydroxide in the preparation of the cathode, the smaller Pt crystallite size, which was consistent with the research carried out by Baranova et al. [33]. By reducing NaOH concentration to the half, Pt crystallite calculated from XRD (by means of Scherrer equation) was found to double its size. The increase was, however, less intense when varying NaOH concentration to 0.05 M. On the other hand, chemisorption analyses show that the active particle size remains almost constant despite lowering NaOH concentration to the half. From that point on, a decrease in NaOH concentration to 0.05 M causes an increase of the active particle size to the double and, as a consequence, the corresponding chemical active surface is reduced to the half. Regarding textural properties, Fig. 5.b shows the adsorption/desorption isotherms of the as-prepared Pt-15/C-x cathodes. It can be observed that pH variation does not modify the kind of N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, which according to the IUPAC is a combination of types I and IV, presenting the same characteristics described above for Pt-m/C-0.2 counterparts. However, it should be noted that the higher the concentration of NaOH, the lower particle size causing a higher decrease of the specific surface area. Attending to the pore size distribution (Fig. S2.b., Supplementary information), it can be seen that in the case of Pt-15/C-0.2 cathode, its pore diameter is noticeably larger compared with those of Pt-15/C-0.125 and Pt-15/C-0.05. The variation of pore volume also shows the same trend in agreement to the possible blockage of the micropores explained above for Pt-m/C-0.2 electrodes. TPR-H2 profiles of these samples also fit that commented above. As an example, Pt-15/C-0.2 and Pt-15/C-0.125 cathodes are shown in Fig. 5.c. Results show that, similar to the electrodes prepared for the previous study, no peaks are found at temperatures below 200 °C, suggesting a proper reduction of Pt particles to its metallic state. Only in the case of the cathode prepared with the highest NaOH concentration a peak between 200−300 °C can be observed, which is characteristic of weak interactions between PtOx and the support [39]. However, the peak comprised in a temperature range of 500−600 °C is common to all Pt-15/C-x cathodes, corresponding to the gasification of the carbonaceous support and the reduction of platinum complex deposited on the surface of the carbonaceous support as described previously [41–43]. It should be noted that since the pH of the synthesis solution provides controlled active particle sizes, as expected, those cathodes with smaller particles displace the maxima towards higher reduction temperatures, being more difficult to reduce than those with bigger particles, thus resulting in a lower concentration of available active species. Finally, titration tests confirmed the increase of the basic character of the cathode as a function of the pH used during the synthesis procedure (Fig. 5.d). 3.2.2 Electrochemical characterization of Pt-15/C-x cathodes Cyclic voltammograms were recorded for each of Pt-15/C-x cathodic catalysts under the same conditions detailed above and the corresponding results are show in Fig. 6 .a–c. CV profile confirms the presence of polycrystalline Pt for all samples. Moreover, although the contribution of (1 1 1) bidimensional ordered terraces was not possible to be observed, the concentration of NaOH used during the cathode synthesis seemed to modify the proportion of (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) Pt facets. It can be observed that as pH of the synthesis solution (NaOH concentration) diminishes, causing an increase of particle size, (1 1 0) face planes are favored instead of (1 0 0) step sites on (1 1 1) terraces sites. The ratio (1 1 0)/(1 0 0) was close to 2 for Pt-15/C-0.05 and 0.4 in case of Pt-15/C-0.2, respectively. Moreover, considering ECSA values summarized in Table 4 , it can be seen that, as occurs for the chemical surface, the electrochemical surface area strongly depends on particle size. As reported by Perez et al. [65] the ECSA linearly decays with increasing Pt particle size. Accordingly, the decrease in the pH of the synthesis procedure, by varying NaOH concentration from 0.2 M to 0.05 M, is found to reduce the ECSA value to the half due to the increase in the particle size. It should be mentioned that the difference between the chemical and electrochemical surface active area can be explained considering that a not negligible part of Pt atoms present on the catalyst surface are not electrochemically active, being not accessible to reactants since they are localized inside the small pores. However, despite of the difference in ECSA values, it is worth it to mention that pH seemed not to affect to the degradation of the catalysts, which was kept almost constant at 56 %. 3.2.3 Electrochemical hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in PEM cell on Pt-15/C-x cathodes From characterization results, it is clear that regulation of pH during the synthesis-reduction method allows to control Pt particle size, which is known to play a fundamental role in the electrochemical hydrogenation reaction. Since the nature of the crystalline planes on the surface of the nanoparticles changes with particle size is imperative that active nanoparticles are as widely dispersed as possible, and with less tendency to the agglomeration during the reactions on the hydrogenation [13,22,66,67]. On the other hand, according to Durndell et al., the variation in the particle size could modify the selectivity, so that an increase in the size of the Pt crystallite would favor the formation of CMO due to the increase of Pt (1 1 1) faces that could block the hydrogenation of the CC bond, thus favoring the hydrogenation of carbonyl group [66,68,69]. For this reason, it is necessary to find a suitable size that involves a compromise between conversion and selectivity to CMO. In order to verify the influence of the pH of the synthesis-reduction procedure on CMA electrohydrogenation performance, Pt-15/C-x cathodic electrodes were tested, in PEM cell configuration, under the same operating conditions detailed before (e.g. 100 ppm CMA/2-propanol to the cathode and water to the anode at 0.05 A, 70 °C and ambient pressure). Fig. 7 shows the electrocatalytic performance (in terms of CMA conversion and selectivity variation) as a function of the NaOH concentration used to synthetize Pt-15/C-x electrodes. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation led to HCMA, CMO, HCMO and acetals formation in all cases. Among them, selectivity to HCMO was lower than 8%. Also, in all cases, production of CMO was favored (23–33 %) with respect to HCMA, ranging from 8 to 22 %. In addition, significant amounts (42–62 %) of unwanted by-products (acetals) were generated by aldolic condensation in the presence of 2-propanol. However, it should be pointed out that these results are consistent and even better than those reported in the available literature on conventional hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, where between 70 and 90 % acetals are obtained under similar conditions (polar solvents and certain acidity) despite working under high pressure [63]. From PEM cell tests and according to the characterization results, it could be verified that Pt-15/C-0.05 catalyst provided the lowest conversion but the highest selectivity to CMO, which could be associated to its bigger particle size, more flat surfaces, a higher (1 1 0)/(1 0 0) Pt facet proportion and a lower ECSA value. On the other side, those catalysts synthetized using a NaOH concentration ranging from 0.125 M to 0.2 M, whose active particle size were found to be similar, despite of a different relative basicity and (1 1 0)/(1 0 0) facets proportion, resulted in a similar product distribution. However, the increase in the pH highly modified the electrochemical active surface. As a consequence, conversion was tripled after increasing NaOH concentration from 0.05 M to 0.2 M. Therefore, the catalyst synthesized with a NaOH concentration of 0.2 M and 15 wt. % Pt loading, which presents a suitable particle size and intrinsic basicity (key parameters to establish a compromise between conversion and selectivity), in addition to a better ECSA value, resulted in the highest CMO yield, despite producing a higher proportion of acetals. It should be also mentioned that, in addition to the reduction in cost resulting from a diminishing of a 5 wt. % in the metallic load, the control of the pH was beneficial for obtaining a similar deactivation degree to that of the cathode synthetized with the lowest platinum load."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, the electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance of Pt-based cathodes, synthetized by the modified polyol method, is shown to be strongly influenced by both Pt loading and pH of the synthesis media (controlled by the NaOH concentration). Results have shown that Pt loading mainly affects active particle size, Pt crystalline facets, ECSA and basicity. In this sense, although product distribution resulted to be similar, CMA conversion was strongly influenced by particle size displaying a maximum value per continuous single pass at 15 wt. % Pt loading. The choice of a suitable pH to carry out the synthesis of the cathodes seemed to have also a direct influence on the particle size and basicity but, what is more important on the electrochemical active surface. The increase of pH by augmenting NaOH concentration up to 0.2 M reduces particle size to the half, which results in double electrochemical surface area and triple CMA electrocatalytic conversion in continuous mode of operation. However, degradation seems not to be affected by NaOH concentration. Therefore, it can be concluded that Pt-15/C-0.2 (5 wt. % Pt lower than that of the commercial one) is the cathode that offers a better compromise between conversion and selectivity to the desired products in PEM cell configuration."
