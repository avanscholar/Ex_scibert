0,Introduction,"Recently, ensuring energy security is a key challenge to political and economic strength in the world. The demands of energy and global populations are increasing alarmingly, which results in a rapid increase in fossil fuel utilization, significantly damaged the ecosystem (Nagarajan et al., 2017). In current situation, about 80% of total initial energy provision and 60% electricity light generation are based on natural fossil fuels. The increasing of CO2 production due to the burning of petroleum coal cause serious threat to climate change (Baykara, 2018; Kosourov et al., 2017). Hydrogen production from phototrophic microorganisms is commercially attractive due to its prospective as an alternative, valuable and renewable energy source (Aziz and Zaini, 2017; Bolatkhan et al., 2019; Khetkorn et al., 2017). Hydrogen gas is one of the greatly adaptable, proficient, sustainable clean energy carrier that may be used as the substitute of fossil fuels because of its high energy yields as compared to conventional hydrocarbon fuels (Aziz, 2016; Hosseini and Wahid, 2016). In future hydrogen will turn into a main fuel which may resolve the local problems associated with environment. Moreover, the use of hydrogen for transport has progressed in various fields, and consumed in the automobile constructions as well as aircraft industry. Therefore, hydrogen may be considered as a major biofuel in future (Sekoai et al., 2019). The consumption of sunlight for hydrogen generation should be an ideal step for sustainable fuel production which uses renewable solar energy (Chatzitakis et al., 2013). Thus, the hydrogen production through biological route as biomass and hydrogen energy provides several advantages such as waste management, replacement of fossil fuels with sustainable biofuel and declining of CO2 emission (Schipper et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2017; Zebda et al., 2018). Bio-hydrogen production requires light source to control and biological and physiological processes (Musazade et al., 2018). Along with a variety of secondary energy resources, hydrogen can extensively be used as a clean energy in fuel cells and reciprocating combustion engines (Fig. 1 ). Electricity can be produced by fuel cell through the electro-chemical reaction of H2 gas and O2 from the atmosphere. Hydrogen-powered fuels can be utilized in various kinds of fuel cells, which produce only water and there is no accompanying pollutant release to the atmosphere (Edwards et al., 2008). Microalgae studied have been implicated for the photosynthetic creation of natural products with industrial uses. The microalgae has fast growing potential as compare to higher plants make it superior model for industrial as well as research purposes. Microalgae have complex metabolic abilities to produce different molecules. Despite their potentials, specific molecular techniques or mechanism remain functionally uncharacterized and poorly understood in microalgae compared to bacteria, fungi and higher plants. Nevertheless, modern advances in strain development, genome editing and genome sequencing technologies offering drive to improve research on microalgal species that have branched out from several focal model organisms to cover a great diversity of species (Fu et al., 2019). The bio-hydrogen production via microbial photosynthesis and microbial bioconversion of an organic feedstock can be significantly enhanced by metabolic and genetic improvement of the related microorganisms (Majidian et al., 2018). Particular biochemical pathways can be improved by modification the generation and regulation of particular enzymes and deletion of pathway which may be counterproductive. In order to achieve and enhance the desired product, the entire metabolic pathways can be heterologous over expressed in ideal host. Genetic engineering together with metabolic engineering are among core technologies for enhanced the bio-hydrogen (Majidian et al., 2018; Martien and Amador-Noguez, 2017). Like cyanobacteria, dark fermenting microorganisms as well as microalgae can be utilized to generate bio-hydrogen (Rollin et al., 2015). Frequently, bio-hydrogen naturally produced in photosynthetic microalgae as source of secondary metabolites to establish the steadiness among the redox energetics (León-Vaz et al., 2019; Philipps et al., 2011). The production of hydrogen has been explored to gain deep understanding in Scenedesmus obliquus (Papazi et al., 2012) Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Scoma et al., 2012), Chlorella fusca (Gimpel et al., 2013), Platymonas subcordiformis (Ran et al., 2006) and Chlorella vulgaris (Gimpel et al., 2013). Even if hydrogen is naturally produced in microalgae upon providing optimum culture environment as well as hydrogenase activity could be superficially induced by adding DCMU (a PSII electron chain uncoupler), but hydrogen production could not be maintained side by side with active photosynthesis because oxygen inactivates hydrogenase (Gimpel et al., 2013). Under favorable conditions, hydrogen production could be improved by directing the electron flux to the hydrogenases, as result protons are biocatalytically converted to hydrogen. To attain this purpose in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Kruse et al. blocked the cyclic electron transmission around photosystem I so that to reduce diversion of electrons away from the hydrogenases. This enhanced the hydrogen production rate by 5–13 fold as compared to control under different conditions (Lee et al., 2010). In another instance, hydrogen production enhanced by 5 fold through redirecting the electrons from the photosystem I to the hydrogenases (Rumpel et al., 2014). Expression of an exogenous ferredoxin of C. acetobutylicum in accumulation to the native ferredoxin of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, directed to increased electron flow to the hydrogenase HydA via drain off electrons from the fermentation of internal reducing equivalents (Sun et al., 2013). With such modifications hydrogen production boosted about 2-fold under light dependent anoxic condition (Sun et al., 2013). A ferreodoxin-NADP + reductase (FNR)-down regulated mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii enhanced hydrogen production by 2.5-fold higher than parent strain under sulfur deprivation (Meuser et al., 2012). A ferreodoxin-NADP + reductase (FNR)-down regulated mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii had a 2.5-fold higher hydrogen production activity relative to the parent strain under sulfur deprivation (Meuser et al., 2012). Genetic engineering has been used to produce O2-tolerant hydrogenase in order to handle with the oxygen challenges (Wu, 2018). The enzyme activity was decline due to these genetic manipulations. Another approach to down regulation of PSII lead to inhibit the production of oxygen (Dubini and Ghirardi, 2015). However, several limiting factors including high production expenditure, storage and transportation issues, poor hydrogen infrastructure challenges the economic feasibility as a fuel source (Chu and Majumdar, 2012; Oey et al., 2016; Rashid et al., 2013). Moreover, improvement of hydrogen infrastructure and storage/transportation methods are necessary for sustainable hydrogen economy (Moreno-Benito et al., 2017; Unni et al., 2017). In addition, different genetic engineering techniques, for example, targeted engineering of specific enzymes (eg. Hydrogenases and Nitrogenases) and metabolic pathways may efficiently enhance hydrogen production (Unni et al., 2017). Various strains of microalgae have been improved through advanced genetic engineering techniques to increase their potential for hydrogen generation (Baebprasert et al., 2011; Khetkorn et al., 2012a,b; Maneeruttanarungroj et al., 2012; Nyberg et al., 2015)."
1,Micro-algae chemical composition,"Micro- algae are known as one or multi-celled organisms and can adopt different environments and can be grown in marine, fresh and wastewater. The composition of micro-algae differs with respect to their species, cultivation environment and biochemical characteristic. They contain about 50% carbon by dry weight, which is usually obtained from carbon dioxide. Generation of 100 g of microbial biomass can fix approximately 183 g of carbon dioxide. Generally, microbial biomasses of microalgae chiefly consist of protein, carbohydrate and lipids. They comprise of 5–60% carbohydrate, 40–60% proteins, 5–10% nucleic acids and 8–30% lipids (Batista et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2013). The lipids, carbohydrate and proteins are used as biofuel feedstock such as hydrogen. Schizochytrium sp. that produces the fatty acids in large quantity, which can be transformed to biodiesel. The efficiency of hydrogen production from steam reforming of photosynthetic microalgal oil is 72.84% (Hao et al., 2019). The biomass of Chlorella composed of 15–70% proteins and 10–70% carbohydrates has a great potential to be used as feedstock and it produced 190.90 mL H2/g hydrogen."
2,Bio-hydrogen production,"Biological hydrogen generation is the hydrogen produced as a byproduct by microorganisms via their metabolic pathways. Bio-hydrogen is considered as a clean and sustainable with a higher energy yield (142 MJ/Kg−1). It can be used as a major fuel source opportunity in the future (Chen et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2014; Nagarajan et al., 2017). The calorific value of hydrogen gas is about 3042 cal/m3 and has the highest gravimetric energy density. Therefore, it can be widely used for the generation of electricity and as a transportation fuel. Recently, the production of bio-hydrogen takes place mostly through electrolysis of water and by steam reforming of natural gas (Saratale et al., 2015). The production of bio-hydrogen from biomass or waste has gained great interest because of its sustainable and renewable nature, with less energy need and high efficiency without competing with food or cash crops (Hallenbeck, 2005). Generally, these methods are potentially carbon neutral processes. It has advantages over electro-chemical and thermo-chemical processes (Saratale et al., 2010). The biological methods involved in hydrogen production, can be characterized as photo-fermentation, dark fermentation and electro-bio-hydrogenation such as: microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) or microbial fuel cells (MFC) (Fig. 2 ). Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages according to practicability, sustainabilty and energy efficiency (Kadier et al., 2018; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Recently, Algae are considered as 3rdgeneration renewable feedstock for a sustainable bio-hydrogen generation. Microalgae have great potential of photosynthetic efficiency and productivity with less land area needed for their growth (Shobana et al., 2017). They have high capabilities to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into a wide variety of organic compounds (Kavitha et al., 2017a,b). These organic compounds provide appropriate sources as raw material for the production of bio-hydrogen. Several microalgae such as Scenedesmus, Chlorella, Synechocystis, Anabaena, Nostoc and Tetraspora harbor hydrogenase for the production of hydrogen (Eroglu and Melis, 2011). Various strains of microalgae have the ability to fix atmospheric N2 to NH3, and use sunlight as the only source of energy to generate bio-hydrogen. Several microalgae are genetically capable of photo-biological hydrogen using sunlight as a source of electron and water as a source of energy under particular physiological conditions. In addition, hydrogen can directly be utilized in a fuel cell to produce high efficiency electrical energy (Ban et al., 2019; Eroglu and Melis, 2016; Esper et al., 2006; He et al., 2017). It is essential to develop efficient hydrogen-powered fuel cells favorable for various energy applications (Fig. 1)."
3,Mechanisms of hydrogen production,"Bio-photolysis is the most suitable method for clean hydrogen production among the different biological methods. However, water is the only essential substrate to obtain hydrogen and is not associated with carbon metabolic pathways (Hoshino et al., 2013). There are four methods to produce biological hydrogen and each method pertains to a specific group of microorganisms (Fig. 3 )."
4,Direct bio-photolysis,"4.1 Direct bio-photolysis Direct bio-photolysis is identical to the method of photosynthesis, and it takes place in algae and higher plants cells (Bharathiraja et al., 2016). Bio-hydrogen is produced directly from water by utilizing the micro-algae photosynthesis system. In this process, the transformation of solar energy into chemical energy occurs to yield molecular hydrogen (Azwar et al., 2014; da Silva Veras et al., 2017). 2 H 2 O + solar energy → 2 H 2 + O 2 The green algae (e.g.Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) generate bio-hydrogen under anaerobic conditions and it can either produce hydrogen (H2) or utilize the hydrogen as an electron donor (Das and Veziroglu, 2008). Ferredoxin (Fd) reduced to act as electron donor during bio-photolysis of water for hydrogen production through hydrogenase enzyme (Nagarajan et al., 2017). Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) are the two photosynthetic reaction centers present in the chloroplasts of microalgae. Photosystem I generates the reluctant for carbon dioxide reduction and photosystem II is involved in splitting water and evolving O2. During the process of biophotolysis, two photons can react with water due to the production of hydrogen in the presence of hydrogenase. Only CO2 reduction can occur in all green plants because they lack hydrogenase. During this process, water electrons are produced when photosystem II accepts light energy from sunlight and electrons are transferred to the Fd components using the energy from sunlight (Ni et al., 2006). Generally, direct bio-photolysis is an eye-catching process because of using solar energy to change a readily available substrate, water to oxygen and hydrogen, but in practical it is limited by others issues. Hydrogenase activity (H2ase) is highly sensitive to oxygen because it is associated during direct bio-photolysis method and as a result inhibits the hydrogen production. This limitation can be solved by increasing the respiration through exploiting the exogenous or endogenous substrates (Razu et al., 2019). The previous study indicated that sulfur-deprived culture medium of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can reduce the activity of photosystem II led to lower production rate of oxygen in respiration and provide anaerobic condition for hydrogenase enzyme (Kosourov et al., 2005). In order to maintain the hydrogen production, it is essential to sustain the oxygen contents at 0, 1% level. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii indicated a similar process that can use O2 during the oxidative breathing. The mutants clipped from microalgae and cyanobacteria have a great ability to produce oxygen molecule, ultimately led the higher production of hydrogen. Microalgae and cyanobacteria have chlorophyll and photosynthetic system(PSI&II), can use light to perform the photosynthesis process (Sharma and Arya, 2017)."
5,Indirect bio-photolysis,"4.2 Indirect bio-photolysis During indirect bio-photolysis, cyanobacteria and microalgae generate hydrogen from stored starch and glycogen. It has two steps; first, the production of carbohydrates using light energy, and second, hydrogen production by fermentation of the carbohydrates (Voloshin et al., 2016). Hydrogen generation from algae through indirect bio-photolysis could be performed if photon conversion could be enhanced for industrial applications. In crop plants, improvement of photosynthetic efficiency is not easy (Voloshin et al., 2016). The reaction of indirect bio-photolysis as following: C 6 H 12 O 16 + 6 H 2 O → 6 CO 2 + 12 H 2 Indirect bio-photolysis by green algae is advantageous due to the fixed sustained availability of carbon source through the duration of cell growth. They can also be described as dark respiration help in dark fermentation (Nagarajan et al., 2017)."
6,Dark fermentation,"4.3 Dark fermentation In dark fermentation hydrogen is produced in the absence of solar light, oxygen and water. Fermentative microorganisms convert the complex organic matter into the mixture of alcohol and organic acid along with hydrogen production. Several waste resources rich in carbon can be processed by dark fermentation producing hydrogen and other significantly by products like volatile fatty acids, acetic acid and butyric acid, as shown in the equation (Bolatkhan et al., 2019; Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). The method of bio-hydrogen production through dark fermentation is environmentally friendly and cost effective. Biological dark fermentation for hydrogen gas generation is very attractive because it is renewable and carbon neutral (Łukajtis et al., 2018). Advantage of dark fermentation process is that, because there is no need for the existence of light energy and continuous use of carbohydrate. However, various toxic compounds can significantly limit sustainable method of hydrogen production. Dark fermentation mechanism has not been broadly spread due to the low hydrogen production (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016). There is also need to separate CO2 during hydrogen production process. Light independent production of hydrogen by dark fermentation generally operates at a high rate. C 16 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 → 2 H 2 + 6 CO 2 To enhance the hydrogen production in dark fermentation method, it is need to control various parameters such as temperature, pH, organic food, solids retention time and nutrient feed rate. Among them pH is the most important parameters which affect the activities of enzyme hydrogenase during hydrogen production."
7,Photo-fermentation,"4.4 Photo-fermentation It is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate into hydrogen, which is carried out by photosynthetic bacteria that used light as an energy source to derive ATP, which in turn powers the hydrogen production. Hence, the process is very effective and is not affected by the partial pressures of hydrogen in the system (Kumar et al., 2017). Pyruvate + CoA → acetyl - CoA + formate The advantage of this method is elimination of environmental pollutants, use of industrial waste and organic acids can be used which is produced in dark fermentation. The disadvantages of photo-fermentation are needed to provide partial nitrogen condition and pretreatment of industrial waste matter as it may be toxic."
8,Genetic engineering and metabolic of microalgae for improvement of hydrogen generation,"Several green algae and cyanobacteria use light energy to extract electrons from H20 and produce strong reductant such as NAD(P)H and decreased ferredoxin. This reductant can be utilized as substrates for production of hydrogen with the involvement of two enzymes: hydrogenase and nitrogenase. However, the major obstacles in sustainable and adequate hydrogen production are the oxygen sensitivity to hydrogenase, led to lower productivity because of competition for electrons by other assimilatory pathways. As a result, the enhancement of hydrogen production by microalgal cells is a challenging concern. Mainly bio-hydrogen production has only been recognized at the laboratory scale with low yields for commercial purpose. It is very essential to improve the rate of bio-hydrogen production for commercial practicability by addressing these critical issues. Recently, many metabolic and genetic engineering techniques have been recognized for the production of hydrogen from microalgae (Baebprasert et al., 2011; Khetkorn et al., 2012a,b; Maneeruttanarungroj et al., 2012; Nyberg et al., 2015). In comparison to the control (wild type), significant results on hydrogen production have been noticed after genetic improvement in some micro-algal species (Baltz et al., 2014; Eroglu and Melis, 2016; Torzillo et al., 2015). In addition to various biotechnological approaches, photo-biological hydrogen production from green microalgae has been widely studied for sustainable bio-hydrogen production (Table 1 )."
9,Non-coding RNA regulation of microalgae bio-hydrogenation,
10,microRNAs associated with hydrogen production in microalgae,"6.1 microRNAs associated with hydrogen production in microalgae microRNAs (miRNAs) is group of small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the regulation of several biological mechanisms in eukaryotes through negative control of gene expression. Among microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an ideal model organism for the investigation of several metabolic processes, especially the response to sulfur deprivation. MiRNA negatively modulated their targets by cleavage stimulated degradation. The levels of mRNA of the target gene could be altered by over-expression of miRNAs. The differential expression pattern of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii miRNAs led to an immense alteration in gene expression and metabolism that was directly related with hydrogen photo-production. Different miRNAs targeted to genes responsible for the photosynthesis produced an anaerobic condition and stimulated the function of hydrogenase. Our research group has carried out a deep sequencing examination of miRNAs in C. reinhardtii and created a genome-wide, quantitative analysis of how sulfur-deprivation affects the expression of small RNAs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results obtained from our study verify 23 predicted miRNAs and 24 well-known miRNAs with changed expression under sulfur deprivation, and the majority of them were up-regulated. This study has provided innovative insights into the role of miRNAs concerned with sulfur deprivation and delivered a novel idea to recognize the bio-hydrogen production from the small RNA level in C. reinhardtii (Shu and Hu, 2012)."
11,Endogenous microRNA regulates hydrogen release from green algae,"6.2 Endogenous microRNA regulates hydrogen release from green algae MiRNAs are a group of endogenous non-coding small RNAs found in eukaryotes. MiRNAs comprise of about 21–22 nucleotide in length. MiRNAs control target gene expression by inhibiting protein translation or promoting mRNA degradation (Wang et al., 2018). In eukaryotic organisms, miRNA have been indicated as a significant regulator of gene expression. MiRNA functions have been investigated broadly in humans, plants and animals. But the physiological roles of endogenous miRNA in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are still under study. A number of human genes are considered to be the targets of miRNA based regulation (Lewis et al., 2005). MiRNAs are involved in cell death, pattering of the nervous system, development timing and cell proliferation in certain animals (Ambros, 2004). MiRNAs are related to the development of diseases (cancer) and regulate several physiological processes (Wang et al., 2016a). MiRNAs also play a vital role in a phase transition, post-translational gene control and regulate organ growth and stress response (Li and Zhang, 2016). The functions of miRNAs in algae are still unclear (Longfei and Zhangli, 2010). In Chlamydomonas, Cre-miR914 and Cre-miR910 were found to be associated with multiple stresses such as salinity, UV-B and heat shock (Gao et al., 2016). Our previous study showed that endogenous miRNAs (cre-miR1166.1, cre-miR1150.3 and cre-miR1158) are responsive to sulfur deprivation in microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. After heat induction, the transgenic strains produced more hydrogen as compared to the wild type. This is the first study that indicated miR1166.1 over expressing in algae, and showed its potential as the most excellent candidate for enhancing bio-hydrogen production from algae. According to findings from our previous study, miR1166.1 was highly up-regulated after sulfur deprivation. Sulfur deprivation stimulates persistent hydrogen generation in green algae, especially in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. So it is considered as hydrogen production regulating factors (Wang et al., 2018)."
12,Using artifcial m1RNA to regulate the continuous hydrogen release of green algae,"6.3 Using artifcial m1RNA to regulate the continuous hydrogen release of green algae Micro RNAs are small RNAs comprising of 21–22 nucleotides, with key regulatory roles in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Recently, our research group has found 22 new miRNAs and their targets during sulfur- deprivation treatment in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The regulation of Photo-system (PSII) associated genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by artificial miRNA (amiRNA) has been investigated. Hydrogen is being believed as the most noticeable alternative fuel and photosynthetic hydrogen generation by micro-algae is regarded as the most promising method. Nevertheless, incompatibility of the oxygen evolving photosynthesis and the oxygen sensitive anaerobic hydrogen generation from green microalgae challenged the hydrogen production industry. Difficulty of change in culture medium for sulfur deprivation treatment also adds the cost. In our lab, a recent approach on regulation of hydrogen production by a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was studied by using artificial miRNA technology, which was previously developed by (Zhao et al., 2009). A heat inducible expression vector harboring the amiRNA targeting the oxygen evolving enhancer (OEE2) gene was developed and transformed into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The expression profile of OEE2 gene showed significant reduction after sulfur deprivation (72 h). With rapid oxygen consumption, the transformed algae indicated that OEE2 gene knockdown was associated with higher hydrogen production. Without any change in culture medium, the maximum hydrogen production was about 2 folds higher as compared to control in transgenic algae. The transgenic algae provided a new approach in the regulation of hydrogen yields under normal culture conditions. These results presented a fresh approach for developing continuous hydrogen generation by green micro-algae for commercial purpose (Li et al., 2015). A blue light-inducible system in Chalamydomonas reinhardtii achieved optogenetic control of an artificial miRNA and enhanced hydrogen production. This was the first effort to develop engineering in photosynthtic microalgae through light inducible sysytem (Wang et al., 2017). It stimulated amiRNA transcription and consequently suppressed the target gene expression under blue light. Transformed algae were cultivated in red light to enhance biomass accumulation and moved to blue or white light to express the amiRNA trgeting protein and thus improve the hydrogen production. The production of hydrogen of transformed algae with the light inducible system was significantly higher as compared to the control group (Wang et al., 2017). Sulfur–deprived grown of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, called as “two stage culture” moving the algal cells from regular algal medium to sulfur- deplete one, has been widely studied to enhance photo-bio-hydrogen production in photosynthetic micro-algae. During sulfur deprivation conduct, the synthesis of a key component of photo-system II complex, D1 protein was repressed and this established continuous photobiological hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Significant improvement in photobiological hydrogen production was noticed in the transgenic Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It developed a novel strategy based on a heat-inducible artificial miRNA (amiRNA) expression system targeting D1-encoded gene, psbA. Transformed algal strain“amiRNA-D1” has been effectively achieved by transforming the expression vector harboring a heat-inducible promoter. Expression of amiRNA-D1 after heat shock was significantly increased with reduction (73%) of target gene psbA. The hydrogen production in transgenic algae increased up to 60% than the wild type (Li et al., 2018)."
13,Long-Chain non-coding RNA and hydrogen production by green algae,"6.4 Long-Chain non-coding RNA and hydrogen production by green algae Long-chain noncoding RNA (LncRNAs) play key roles in different metabolic pathways in yeast, plant and animals. Recent investigations indicated that they are closely associated with cell differentiation and development, cancer progression, immune response gene mediation, silencing gene expression and neurological diseases occurrence (Carpenter et al., 2013; Dimond and Fraser, 2013; Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014; Guttman et al., 2011; Pauli et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016b; Yang et al., 2014). In plants, LncRNAs were described to modulate the male sterility of hybrid rice and increased its yield (Ding et al., 2012). Microalgae are very important for biofuel production and metabolic engineering. Several studies were carried out to reduce the cost of biofuel production, but limited achievement was obtained. LncRNAs study and exploitation may give new insights and solution to these problems. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the model organisms to investigate hydrogen metabolism in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The previous study has confirmed that sulfur deprivation is greatly correlated to hydrogen photo-production and it leads to continuous hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Melis et al., 2000). Our previous study showed that hydrogen generation can be modulated by an artificial noncoding RNA targeting OEE2 encoded gene (Li et al., 2015). LncRNAs consist of more than 200 nucleotides without encoding proteins, but play a key role in gene regulation in a eukaryote. Recently our research group performed RNA sequencing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and obtained 3,574 putative LncRNAs. The ORF length, number of transcripts and exons for LncRNAs are much less as compared to genes in these green algae. A 367 LncRNAs were responsive to sulfur deprivation, including 36 LncRNAs which are associated with photosynthesis. In green algae, hydrogen production is closely related to photosynthesis. Electrons, which is essential for the hydrogen generation in green algae was obtained from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. LncRNAs may regulate the photosynthesis associated mRNA. This was a pioneering study regarding LncRNAs exploration in C. reinhardtii (Li et al., 2016). Sustained hydrogen production in microalgae is possible by using regulatory LncRNAs. LncRNAs might be one of the potential solutions for issues regarding sustained hydrogen production."
14,Photo-bioreactors and hydrogen production,"The commercial production of hydrogen is only feasible if high hydrogen generation efficiencies could be achieved at relatively low costs. Industrial production of bio-hydrogen by means of microalgae needs photo-bioreactors specific for microalgal cultivation (Khetkorn et al., 2017; Skjånes et al., 2016). The fundamental factors affecting PBR design are tank depth and agitation (de Jesus and Maciel Filho, 2017). Secondly, efficient supply of light energy is pivotal. Usually, the cultivation of algae at commercial scale is carried out in open ponds. Since hydrogen is a gas, open ponds cannot be employed for microalgal hydrogen production. Various kinds of closed PBRs have been designed for the cultivation of microalgae at large scale, and they provide a better process control in bio-hydrogen production (Akkerman et al., 2002; Geada et al., 2017; Skjånes et al., 2016). All photo-bioreactors need light penetration, which is generally obtained from sunlight. However, controlled light from artificial sources is also used in indoor cultivation. Generally the microalga PBRs are designed according to characteristics of the strain used. Volume ratio, deep light penetration, agitation, gas exchange, and temperature are the main factors that affect the performance of the photo-bioreactors. Various kinds of PBRs are used for the production of hydrogen. These photo-reactors are classified into the tubular, vertical column and flat panel photo-bioreactors. Flat panel photo-bioreactor made up of a stainless-steel frame and polycarbonate panels. In this photo-bioreactor temperature, optical density, pH, and hydrogen production are regulated by a particular control system (Skjånes et al., 2016). In addition, high photosynthesis activity can obtain in these photo-bioreactors. However, applications of flat panel PBRs are restricted to small factories and laboratories (Bolatkhan et al., 2019). Flat panel photo-bioreactors are considered more economical compared to other photo-bioreactors. Vertical photo-bioreactors comprise of a transparent column typically composed of glass and bounded with water covering sheets. It allows controlling temperature by circulating water and deep light penetration into the suspension. Tubular type photo-bioreactors comprise of long transparent tubes. Photosynthetic microalga cells are moved through these tubes by airlift pumps (Oncel and Kose, 2014; Slegers et al., 2013). Additionally, several photo-bioreactors have been designed for biomass and hydrogen production from microalgae (Oncel and Kose, 2014). Improvement of appropriate photo-bioreactors for microalgal hydrogen generation is still challenging (Bolatkhan et al., 2019; Kroumov et al., 2017; Sevda et al., 2017)."
15,Hydrogen synthesizing enzymes in microalgal metabolisms,"Nitrogenases and Hydrogenases are two enzymes believed to be very important cellular machinery accountable for bio-hydrogen generation in photosynthetic microalgae (Winkler et al., 2009). Hydrogenase is mostly observed in cyanobacteria and microalgae. The enzyme maturation, activity and structural variation of hydrogenase can differ in various species. Nitrogenase is found only in Cyanobacteria, it generates a significant yield of hydrogen under nitrogen deficient and anaerobic conditions, (Carrieri et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2008). Hydrogenase and Nitrogenase are involved in the condensation of proton (H+) to H2."
16,Nitrogenase (N2ase),"8.1 Nitrogenase (N2ase) The routes for bio-hydrogen generation from photosynthetic microalgae differ from cyanobacteria depending on the taxonomy. Basically, bio-hydrogen production from prokaryotic and eukaryotic depends on the activities of enzymes. In cyanobacteria, nitrogenase (N2ase) is involved in indirect bio-hydrogen production. While in green microalgae hydrogenase (H2ase) is responsible for both directed and indirect bio-photolysis. N2ase has a significant role in global N2 cycle on the earth, and provided in a diazotroph. Several cyanobacteria have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (NH3) and release hydrogen as a by-product. Nitrogenase comprising of two proteins such as the dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (MoFe and Fe). Nitrogenase is a heterotetramer α2β2 consisting α and β subunits which are encoded by nifD and nifK genes, correspondingly. The role of MoFe is to reduce of N2 bonds forming ammonia (NH3). The nitrogenase reductase is encoded by nifH gene. Nitrogenase has a significant function of moving electrons from the outer electrons donor to the dinitrogenase proteins (Bothe et al., 2010). Nitrogenase may entirely catalyze the creation of hydrogen due to the absence of substrate N2. Hydrogen generation by nitrogenase needs a significant amount of electrons, reductant, and at least 16ATP molecules from photosynthesis in the cell. The yield rate of [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases is higher than nitrogenase (Meyer, 2007; Srirangan et al., 2011)."
17,Hydrogenase (H2ase),"8.2 Hydrogenase (H2ase) There are three different types of hydrogenases found in cyanobacteria and green microalgae, known as [NiFe] hydrogenase, [FeFe] hydrogenase, and [Fe] hydrogenase (Bolatkhan et al., 2019). [Fe] hydrogenase is a new known enzyme and present only in some methanogenic archaea. Further investigation on the activity of [Fe] hydrogenase are still being. The active site of [Fe] hydrogenase consists of only one Fe atom accommodated by one cysteine sulfur, two cis-oriented CO, and a bidentate guanylyl pyridinol ligand. The [NiFe] hydrogenase produces a high amount of hydrogenase. It is found in cyanobacteria and is bifunctional functioning as an absorption hydrogenase as well. It consists of small and large subunits, 64 kDa and 34 kDa respectively."
18,Hydrogen generation by green microalgae,"Photosynthetic microalgae have enormous prospective as renewable biofuel resource. Several green algae including Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Scenedesmus obliquus and Tetraspora sp. have been widely considered for their efficient role in hydrogen production (Wang and Yin, 2018). In green algae, the production of hydrogen is related to the direct bio-photolysis system. It generally happens when microalga cells are exposed to the light subsequent to a dark period incubation and anaerobic adaptation. The expression of hydrogenase gene (HYDA) was up-regulated in Chlorella vulgaris YSL01 and YSL16 under aerobic conditions in the photoautotrophic mode of cultivation (Hwang et al., 2014). The microoxic niches inside the thylakoid stroma of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii conserve [FeFe]-hydrogenase action and assist in constant hydrogen production under entirely aerobic conditions (Liran et al., 2016). The rate of hydrogen production directly depends on microalgae species and light strength. The higher hydrogen generation rate could be achieved in the light for a short time. For example, the rate of hydrogen production was higher at 2.5 s after exposing the Chlorella vulgaris cells to about 0.03Wm2light and the kinetics is linear for at least one minute. In green microalgae, hydrogen production is a short time process. The efficiency of hydrogen conversion in green algae is higher as compared to cyanobacteria. Highest efficiency for the direct water bio-photolysis the phenomenon has been detected to be around 10%. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism for the production of hydrogen. It can be grown not only in light but also in dark conditions with acetate as a carbon source. Recently, it’s mitochondrial, nuclear and chloroplast genome has been sequenced. Additionally, both nuclear DNA and chloroplast DNA can be easily modified. By exploiting genetic engineering techniques, hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been enhanced with genetically modified H2 producing strains. The genetically modified satin Stm 6 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produced 5–13 times more hydrogen than that of wild type (Saratale et al., 2019). Additionally, the green algae including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can use organic substrates for generating hydrogen through dark respiration. The main resultant products are ethanol, formate and acetate. However, metabolite profile differs significantly among various algal stains under diverse ecological conditions. The capability of green algae to generate hydrogen on sudden exposure to light after a dark period incubation was reported about 77 years ago (Gaffron and Rubin, 1942). After this discovery, various photosynthetic microorganisms including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been reported to generate hydrogen. C. reinhardtii exploit light energy and use CO2 as a substrate to oxidize H2O and make nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and organic compounds for energy. It is contradictory for the generation of bio-hydrogen from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, because photosynthesis generates the building blocks for the production of hydrogen gas (protons and electrons), but also produce oxygen, which is an inhibitor of hydrogen gas production. [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase enzyme which is responsible for hydrogen production is inactivated by oxygen. And oxygen also controls the transcription of the gene encoding the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase (Khetkorn et al., 2017) The high levels of hydrogen production showed by modified strain cy6Nac2.49 under a dark or light environment than those of wild type suggest an important potential for its prospect application. C. reinhardtii (cy6Nac2.49) is a genetically improved microalgae strain that stimulates photosynthesis in a cyclical way, therefore photosynthesis is not dynamic constitutively in the existence of oxygen, but is started only in response to anerobiosis. The level hydrogen production in mutant strains was higher in the light period (10-h: 14-h light/dark) under photosynthesis condition as compared to wild type (Batyrova and Hallenbeck, 2017)."
19,Photosynthetic hydrogen production,"Photosynthesis is carried out in chloroplast. It occurs into two steps such as light (known as thylakoid reactions) and the carbon fixation reactions. The light collecting antennae are fixed in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast and are connected with the protein complexes known as photo-system (PSI and PSII). The reaction centers of photo-system (PSI and PSII) are accountable for transform light energy into redox potential, which moves the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain. The PET chains oxidize water in the lumen and pass the gained electrons through cytb6f complex, plastoquinone, PSII, plastocyanin and PSI to reduced ferredoxin in the stroma. The outcomes of light reaction are oxygen, ATP and NADPH by Photosystem II, ATP synthase, and ferredoxin NADP reductase (FNR) respectively.[Fe-Fe] enzyme hydrogenase is also attached to the PET chain and can receive electrons from ferredoxin for hydrogen generation (Bayro-Kaiser and Nelson, 2017)."
20,Pre-treatment of microalgal biomass as feedstock to generate fermentative bio-hydrogen,"The biomass derived from microalgae is rich in carbohydrates. It has huge prospective as a feedstock for the production of different biofuels including bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach (Sambusiti et al., 2015). Microalgae can produce bio-hydrogen as a result of photosynthetic metabolism. In addition, microalgae are also utilized as feedstock for the production of bio-hydrogen through microbial dark fermentation (Wang and Yin, 2018). In recent years, interest of bio-hydrogen production from microalgae though dark fermentation, are increasing (Rajhi et al., 2016). The pretreatment is essential for the release of the fermentable substances from microalgae. There are numerous pre-treatments technologies which were investigated and developed for treating of different waste materials that can be exploited to pre-treat microalgal biomass for bio-hydrogen production. There are four pre-treatment processes, such as biological, chemical, physical and combination treatments. Physical pre-treatment methods are heat, mechanical, and ultrasonic while chemical pre-treatments include acid, base and ozone based methods. And biological pretreatment methods include microbiological and enzymatic treatments. In order to enhance the hydrolysis of carbohydrates in microalgae, pretreatment methods including milling, microwave, ultrasonic, chemical oxidation, steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis are often used. The aim of pre-treatment is the removal of the cell wall to liberate the organic matters from the algal cells. Hence, all these methods are pertinent to bio-hydrogen production (Wang and Yin, 2018). Microalgae are considered the best sources as feedstock for the production of biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol. Several studies on different microbial species such as Scenedesmus sp. and Saccharina sp. have been done, and these are used as feedstock for bio-hydrogen production. In order to improve the bio-hydrogen production, various pre-treatment procedures were explored (Table2 ). Some microbial species such as Chlorella vulgaris is the most extensively used as a substrate for the bio-hydrogen generation without pre-treatment. The Bio-hydrogen yield achieved from microbial species ranges from 0.37 to 19 mL H2/g VS, and maximum bio-hydrogen production was obtained from Chlorella vulgaris (Wieczorek et al., 2014)."
21,Economic evaluation,"In present, global move toward greener economies has emerged considered by biomass conversion in biorefinery complexes into biofuel (Kapanji et al., 2019; Mandegari et al., 2017). Cost-effectively bio-hydrogen demands high hydrogen production at efficiency working cost and lower capital. The photosynthetic microalgae need particular bioreactors, which make up a large scale generation of bio-hydrogen. The fundamental factors influencing new bioreactors project development may be, light penetration, agitation and depth of the tank (de Jesus and Maciel Filho, 2017; Khetkorn et al., 2017). Main problems of recent bio-hydrogen development are connected with cost-effectiveness of the technologies for practical uses. The previous study represents comprehensive economic analyses of biological hydrogen generation is slightly restricted. Furthermore, intensive work on optimization of hydrogen yield requires to be conducted with respects to bio-hydrogen operation, facility, light system, land area, construction’s material cost, mixing of biomass, maintenance and durability (Show et al., 2019; Show et al., 2012). As a basic level, practical hydrogen production prices should be competitive or more promising than market prices. According to International Energy Agency report, the competitive market cost for hydrogen production was established at 0.30USD per kg. Investment for an indirect photolysis capacity consist of 1st stage 140 ha open microalgal ponds and 2nd stage 14 ha photo-reactors was described (Show et al., 2019). The capacity was intended to produce 1200 TJ/yr at 90% capacity with given entire capital investments of 43 million USD. At a yearly operating cost of USD 12 million, total production price was assessed at 10 USD per unit GJ energy. Based on 25% annual capital cost, the capital investment emanated near to 90% of the overall cost. However, open ponds were estimated at a rate of 6 USD/m2, the main capital and operating price were resultant from the photoreactors (100 USD/m2). One promising approach is to recycle metabolic products of photo-bioreactors and to decrease chemical expenditures of nutrients additions to facilitate the growth of microalgae. Moreover, dealings of the photo-bioreactors waste and buying chemical nutrients could make 80–85% of the overall cost of industrial bio-hydrogen (Show et al., 2011, 2019). An evaluation was piloted to compare energy balance for crude glycerol use in dark fermentation bio-hydrogen with that for glycerol refinement for pure glycerol (Pachapur et al., 2018). The energy balance for each of the glycerol use during media preparation stages, electricity consumed and inoculums was assessed. Generally, energy need for glycerol refinement (872 MJ) was 2.5 times more than energy inputs for transforming vegetables feedstock into crude glycerol (344 MJ). Therefore, transformation of crude glycerol to hydrogen by dark fermentation is deliberated as sustainable biofuel alternatives (Pachapur et al., 2018). Performance and economic of a scaleup pilot modular photoreactors field operation were evaluated. The major expenditure including chemical nutrients, prices of fabrication materials and field operation constitute of 84%. The cost of construction (0.75USD/m2) was much cheaper than previously reported cost (20–100 USD/m2) (Show et al., 2012). The operation cost can be significantly reduced by recycling the metabolic nutrients and construction materials (Show et al., 2019). Gasification has the prospective to transform biomass into gaseous mixtures, which can be utilized for hydrogen production (Jin et al., 2015). Supercritical water gasification and thermal gasification are usually used thermochemical approach for conversion of algal biomass to hydrogen. There is a potential for removal of capital cost-intensive drying step due to well handling of wet biomass through supercritical water gasification. Thermal gasification is promising as an alternative method for hydrogen production from microalgae. Kumar established techno-economic models for the evaluation of hydrogen production through thermal gasification and supercritical gasification processes (Kumar et al., 2019). The economic assessment of new techno-economic model indicated that 2000 dry tonnes/day plant needs total capital investment of 215.3 M$ and 277.8 M$ and for hydrogen product values of 5.66/kg and $4.59/kg respectively. The cost of hydrogen is about 4 times the cost of hydrogen from natural gas. The techno-economic estimation assist to explore options for the hydrogen production through these recent techniques (Kumar et al., 2019)."
22,Advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen production from microalgae,"The biomass composition of microalgae ensures its applications in a wide range of industries. Carbohydrates are found in microalgae in the form of glucose, starch, carrageenan and agar. It is considered a suitable feedstock for the production of different fermentation products. The lipids of microalgae consist of glycerol, sugars or bases esterified to saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. They can be used for the production of biodiesel. The associated long chain fatty acids, proteins and pigments have their own pharmaceutical applications. Microalgae are considered as new renewable source as compared to cellulose based biomass and waste activated sludge. They have numerous advantages: firstly, microalgae have a high growth rate with short life cycles and fulfill the huge demand for biofuels by using limited land resources. Microalgae can double their biomass in short periods as 3.5 h. Secondly; microalgae are capable of using inorganic carbon sources to produce cell biomass, for example I kg of dry algal biomass exploit about 1.83 kg of CO2. Thirdly, they have strong adaptation to different environments without competing with arable land. Fourthly, the cultivation of microalgae is environmental friendly without the need for herbicides and pesticides. Nitrous oxide discharge could be reduced during the utilization for biofuels production. Fifthly, the carbohydrate content of microalgae are very high to support efficient hydrogen production. Sixthly, microalgae have a simple structure and do not contain hemicelluloses and lignin, so required pre-treatments can be milder. Furthermore, there is no arable land required for the growth of microalgae, and can be grown in aqueous media. The cultivation of microalgae needs less water than terrestrial crops. Lastly, microalgae are unicellular microorganisms, which are adaptive to different environmental conditions, and can be grown in seawater, fresh water and waste water. They can obtain the nitrogen and phosphorus as nutrients from wastewater (Luque, 2010; Misra et al., 2016; Uggetti et al., 2014; Wang and Yin, 2018; Zhan et al., 2016). Besides the advantages, some constraints are found which limits bio-hydrogen production from microalgae. One of them is the low biomass concentration in the microalgal culture owing to the limit of light diffusion, which in combination with the small size of algal cells makes the harvest of algal biomass comparatively expensive. Another disadvantage is that the harvested algal biomass contains large contents of water, so, the drying process is energy consuming. Moreover, intensive care and the huge capital expenditure are needed by microalgal farming facility over agriculture farm, which is an additional issue that impedes the commercial accomplishment of the biofuels from microalgae approach (Wang and Yin, 2018). However, these issues are expected to be overcome or reduced by using recent advanced technology. To be known enormous prospective of microalgae as the most efficient prime procedure of biomass, there is little doubt that they will ultimately become one of the most important alternatives energy sources."
23,Conclusions,"Advancement in micro RNAs regulation has a great future potential for sustainable bio-hydrogen production from microalgae. Recent advancement in genetic modification and metabolic engineering of microalgae has a great future prospectus which make bio-hydrogen production cost effective, environmental friendly and sustainable. Limitation factors such as economic viability, social acceptance, scale up operation, oxygen sensitivity to hydrogenase and deep light penetration into suspension are obstacles in practical applications and sustainable bio-hydrogen production. Commercially bio-hydrogen production is only possible by overcome the most bottlenecks through modern biotechnology and revolutionized industry. More specifically, entire new pathways can be introduced into microalgae to enable production of bio-hydrogen."
