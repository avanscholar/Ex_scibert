0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels impacts the environment in several ways, including climate change and pollution. In recent years, alternative energy sources have been the focus of discussions on reducing and controlling environmental issues. A promising energy carrier, hydrogen has a high energy yield (122kJg−1), which is 2.75 times greater than the energy obtained from burning hydrocarbons, and the only by-product at the end of the process is water [1]. Hydrogen can be produced by (i) electrolysis of water, (ii) thermochemical processes, (iii) radiolytical processes and (iv) biological processes. Because it is less energy intensive, biological hydrogen production will be a feasible approach for energy generation once the process can be performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure [2]. Moreover, the use of wastewater as a feedstock could make the process more economically attractive and environmentally friendly [3]. Biological hydrogen production can be widely classified into dark and photo-driven processes [4]. The former has several advantages over the latter: (i) it is a straightforward and practical process, (ii) it is less costly, (iii) high hydrogen yields can be attained, (iv) continuous hydrogen production is possible without light, (v) a variety of substrates can be used, including waste or wastewater and (vi) high value-added metabolites such as butyric, lactic and acetic acids and solvents, such as ethanol and butanol, can be produced [1,2,4,5]. Most studies use hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) found in both natural and engineered environments as inocula, which can consist of anaerobic sludge taken from wastewater treatment plants, soil or lake sediments [6, 7]. Pure culture can also be used; however, microbial consortia result in the operation and control of the system being easier and simpler. Additionally, mixed cultures use a wide variety of carbon sources as substrates in contrast to pure cultures, which are more restrictive in this aspect [3]. However, the hydrogen produced when using microbial consortia can be consumed by hydrogen-consuming bacteria (HCB), primarily methanogens and homoacetogens, which decrease hydrogen yields. Some pretreatments of the seed sludge are used to stimulate the HPB and suppress the HCB to improve the hydrogen yield from the mixed culture [8]. The main pretreatment methods reported in literature are temperature shock, pH shock, chemical pretreatment, physics shock and combinations of the methods. However, the first two methods are generally the most used at selecting HPB populations [6–16]. Although several studies have stated that the origin and pretreatment of seed sludge affect hydrogen production from wastewater in batch assays, only a few studies have reported on the influence of these factors in continuous reactors, where the dynamics of biomass growth and washout are entirely different from those observed in discontinuous systems. Moreover, there have been few reports linking microbial communities to biohydrogen production, particularly for biofilm reactors. In response to the state of the existing literature, this paper reports on experiments designed to investigate the influence of different inocula and seed sludge pretreatment methods on biohydrogen production in up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactors. Additionally, the profiles of microbial communities are also evaluated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor,"2.1 Up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor This study used bench-scale anaerobic fixed-bed reactors made of acrylic tubes, each with an inner diameter of 80mm, outer diameter of 88mm and height of 750mm. The reactors’ working and total volumes were 2.5 and 3.5L, respectively. A schematic of the system used for the continuous biohydrogen production is illustrated in Fig. 1 [17]."
3,Support material,"2.2 Support material The support material used in this study consisted of cylindrical recycled low-density polyethylene. The surface area of this material was 7.94m2 g−1, where the average diameter and length were 4.8mm and 10mm, respectively. The bed porosity was 45%."
4,Synthetic wastewater,"2.3 Synthetic wastewater The reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater, as previously described by Fontes Lima and Zaiat [17]. NaHCO3 (500mgL−1) and HCl (0.25mlL−1 – 12N) were added to adjust the pH to 6.5."
5,Inocula and pretreatment,"2.4 Inocula and pretreatment The inocula considered in the study included autofermentation (A) obtained by natural fermentation of synthetic wastewater [18], anaerobic sludge from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (Sl) and anaerobic sludge from a UASB reactor treating swine wastewater (Sw). The concentrations of the total volatile solids (TVS) were 36.4 and 32.5gL−1 for the Sl and Sw, respectively. The heat shock (He) consisted of heating the sludge for 10min at 90°C and then cooling it to room temperature. The acid shock (Ac) was conducted by maintaining the pH of the sludge at 3.0 for 24h through the addition of 1N HCl before adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 1N NaOH. Three liters of non-pretreated or pretreated seed sludge were added to 27L of synthetic wastewater to inoculate the reactor. Thirty liters of fermented synthetic wastewater were used in the reactor inoculation for the autofermentation process. The nomenclature presented in Table 1 was adopted to facilitate the presentation of the results."
6,Reactor operation,"2.5 Reactor operation To start the reactor, the medium containing microorganisms was recycled in a closed circuit, providing a batch operation in the reactor for five days to allow for the attachment of the biomass to the support material. After, the reactor was operated in continuous mode for 60 days. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 2h, and the temperature was maintained at 25°C."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The flow rate of the biogas was recorded with a Miligascounter (Ritter®) gas meter, and its composition (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu®) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector with argon as the carrier gas and a CARBOXEN® 1010 Plot (30m, 0.53mm) column. The temperatures of the injector and detector were maintained at 220°C and 230°C, respectively. The column temperature had an initial temperature of 130°C and was heated at a rate of 46°Cmin−1 until 135°C. The organic acids and alcohols were analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Shimadzu®) equipped with a pump (LC-10ADVP), auto sampler (SIL-20A HT), column oven (CTO-20A) at 43°C, UV-diode array detector (SDP-M10 AVP), refraction index detector (RID-10A), system controller (SCL-10AVP) and an Aminex HPX-87H column (300mm, 7.8mm, BioRad®). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01N) at 0.5mlmin−1. Carbohydrate concentrations were determined using the colorimetric method proposed by Dubois et al. [19]. The total volatile solids (TVS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH were measured in accordance with the Standard Methods [20]."
8,Analysis of microbial communities,"2.7 Analysis of microbial communities Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to evaluate the microbial communities presented in different inocula. Biomass samples were collected at the beginning (day 0), in the middle (day 30) and at the end (day 60) of the operating period. The genomic DNA was extracted by lysis cell with glass beads (Sigma), phenol, chloroform and buffer using a modified procedure described by Griffths et al. [21]. The 16S rRNA fragments were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 968FGC–1401R [22]. Using denaturing gradient concentrations of 45% and 65%, the DGGE was performed at 75V and 60°C for 16h [23]. An Eagle Eye TM III (Stratagene®) at a UV wavelength of 254nm linked to a computer and Eagle Sight software was used to reveal the band profiles. To cluster the band profiles, Bionumerics version 2.5 software and the Jaccard index were used."
9,Statistical methods,"2.8 Statistical methods The experimental data (molar H2 flow rate, hydrogen yield and volumetric H2 production rate) were subjected to the D’Agostino test to check if they were parametric. Because the results indicated that most of the variables were nonparametric, the data were compared using a nonparametric hypothetical Kruskal–Wallis test. A level of statistical significance (p) greater than 0.05 would indicate that there were no significant differences between inocula and therefore, were similar, whereas a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 would indicate that the samples showed significant differences and therefore, were different [24]. Both statistical tests were performed using BioEstat® software version 5.0."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production The results indicated that the source and pretreatment method of the inocula influenced the molar H2 flow rate (MHFR), H2 yield (HY) and volumetric H2 production rate (VHPR) (Fig. 2 ). The Kruskal–Wallis test showed significant statistical differences between reactors using different seed sludges because the p-value was less than 0.05 (p <0.0001) for the MHFR, HY and VHPR [24]. The maximum HY, MHFR and VHPR values were obtained for SlHe (6.9molH2 mol−1 sucrose, 25.5mmolH2 h−1 and 195.6mLH2 h−1 L−1, respectively, as shown in Table 2 ). The highest average HY value (2.1molH2 mol−1 sucrose in Table 2) was observed in the reactor subjected to autofermentation (A), whereas the greatest average MHFR (7.6mmolH2 h−1 in Table 2) and VHPR values (61.6mLH2 h−1 L−1 in Table 2) were observed with SlAc. The pretreatment methods improved the VHPR because the values observed with SlHe (51.7mLH2 h−1 L−1), SlAc (61.6mLH2 h−1 L−1), SwHe (21.1mLH2 h−1 L−1) and SwAc (26.7mLH2 h−1 L−1) were higher than those observed in non-pretreated anaerobic seed sludge (23.2 and 15.1mLH2 h−1 L−1 for Sl and Sw, respectively). This behavior was also observed for the MHFR values. However, there was no improvement in the HY values when pretreatment methods were applied to Sw. A comparison of the three sources (A, Sl, Sw) showed that autofermentation (A) yielded the highest MHFR, HY and VHPR values (Table 2), indicating the feasibility of applying this simple inoculation procedure to hydrogen production. This performance could be due to the selection of microorganisms that were properly adapted to the substrate and the operational and environmental conditions. The average HY values were similar to those observed by Lee et al. [25], who tested acid shock seed sludge in a fixed-bed reactor filled with activated carbon and operated at an HRT of 2h (2.2–3.1molH2 mol−1 sucrose), and those observed by Fontes Lima and Zaiat [17], who tested autofermentation with the same operational condition as those in the current study (0.9–1.4molH2 mol−1 sucrose). The instability of the hydrogen production observed over the range of experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 2. The performance parameters (MHFR, HY and VHPR) peaked after approximately 15 days, then decreased to extremely low values at the end of operation (60 days). Such unstable biogas production has also been observed by Fontes Lima and Zaiat [17], who have credited the instability to the activity of anaerobic homoacetogenic microorganisms involved in the uptake of H2 and CO2. Arooj et al. [26] have estimated the percentage of acetic acid produced by homoacetogenic microorganisms using a model adjusted to the hydrogen production from sucrose examined in the currently study. Fig. 3 shows that the HY decreased and the percentage of acetic acid produced by homoacetogenesis increased in this case. In addition to homoacetogenesis, the methanogenic activity could be related to the uptake of hydrogen because methane was detected in the biogas at all experimental conditions except with A and SlHe. Therefore, homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis could have reduced the HY values by consuming H2 and CO2 to produce acetic acid and methane, respectively. These results are analogous to those observed by Calli et al. [27], who studied hydrogen production using thermophilic dark fermentation and reported a drop in HY that was inversely proportional to the increase in acetate production. Oh et al. [28] reported that although heat pretreatment prevents methanogenesis, the shock is unable to prevent hydrogen consumption via homoacetogenesis. It is worth mentioning that the SlAc resulted in a more stable production with lower standard deviations of MHFR, HY and VHPR (Table 2), indicating that acid shock was more effective at reducing hydrogen-consuming activity and selecting HPB with considerable hydrogen production activity. Because homoacetogen activity in SlAc was substantially inferior to that observed in others inocula (i.e., the HAcHomoacetogenesis/HAc ratio was less than 100%), SlAc presented the highest average MHFR and VHPR values, demonstrating that acid pretreatment was more effective than heat shock at suppressing hydrogen-consuming activity. It is unclear why HCB was more sensitive to acid shock than HPB, however, it is known that pretreatment methods cause difference in the microbial diversity which could be straight responsible for various fermentation types and hydrogen yields [13]. Furthermore, Luo et al. [29] concluded pretreatments could just have temporarily effect on ceasing microbial metabolism because of the environmental changes. However, some bacteria can adapt to the new conditions and re-establish their activities. This occurs especially for spore-forming homoacetogens that could germinate after pretreatments. Even it takes time, homoacetogenesis could be observed after long-term operation. In conclusion, the suppression of hydrogen-consuming organisms that produced methane (methanogens) and acetic acid (homoacetogens) was essential to providing higher HY, MHFR and VHPR values. The maximum theoretical HY (HY theo. max.) was 8molH2 mol−1 sucrose when acetic acid was the sole product of fermentation; however, the HY decreased to 4molH2 mol−1 sucrose when butyric acid was produced as a by-product. The ratio between the HY obtained in each experiment and the maximum theoretical HY (HYtheo. max.) varied between 8.8% and 86.3% (Table 2), implying mixed fermentation with the production of acetic, butyric and other acids. Acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol were the main by-products during biohydrogen production process, representing at least 65% of the total soluble metabolite products (SMP). Regardless, the SMP distribution was consistent with that of other studies, and the variation in concentrations was likely a consequence of the substrates, pretreatment methods, inocula, reactor design, temperature, pH and HRT under study [30–37]. However, other acids such as citric, malic, succicinic, formic, valeric, iso-valeric, and caproic acids were detected at small concentrations (data not shown). Table 3 presents an electron mass balance in terms of COD for all sludge and pretreatments studied. The missing electrons equivalents (MEE) ranged from 9 to 14%. The difference in the electron mass balances may be due the biomass growth, according to Chaganti et al. [38]."
12,Analysis of microbial communities,"3.2 Analysis of microbial communities The DGGE profiles in Fig. 4 illustrate the influence of the inocula sources and pretreatment methods on microbial communities at the beginning, middle and end of the study period (days 0, 30, and 60, respectively). Fig. 4A shows that A, Sl and Sw had only a 38% similarity coefficient, indicating the difference in bacterial populations resulting from the inocula sources. The band pattern shifts observed between the initial (day 0) and final (day 60) samples, A0 and A60 (42%), Sl0 and Sl60 (61%) and Sw0 and Sw60 (39%), were a consequence of the operational conditions. Fig. 4B and C indicate bacterial community selection when pretreatments, including heat and acid shocks, were applied. The samples collected from the reactor inoculated with Sl (Sl0, Sl30 and Sl60) formed a distinct group when compared with the pretreated samples (SlHe and SlAc) in Fig. 4B. Probably, the microbial diversity present in each inoculum was responsible for the different average HY values: 1.0molH2 mol−1 sucrose for Sl and 2.0molH2 mol−1 sucrose when SlHe and SlAc were inoculated in the reactor (Table 2). The Sw, SwHe and SwAc samples in Fig. 4C were arranged in 3 main groups according to the pretreatment method used. The first group contained samples without pretreatment (Sw0, Sw30 and Sw60) with 56% similarity. The second group displayed 60% similarity among the acid-pretreated samples (SwAc0, SwAc30 and SwAc60), and the third group displayed 52% similarity among the SwHe samples (SwHe0, SwHe30 and SwHe60). These differences in microbial community arising from each type of pretreatment sludge also affected the VHPR values: 15.1mLH2 h−1 L−1 for Sw, 21.1mLH2 h−1 L−1 for SwHe and 26.7mLH2 h−1 L−1 for SwAc (Table 2), which attested to the effectiveness of pretreatments at enhancing HPB. The operational conditions were responsible for eliminating certain microorganisms while maintaining others. The Sl samples collected at day 30 (Sl30) and day 60 (Sl60), shown in Fig. 4B, had a similarity greater than 79%. Additionally, the samples SlAc and SlHe collected at the middle and end of the experiments had higher similarity (over 80% between SlAc30 and SlAc60 and upwards of 95% between SlHe30 and SlHe60). The same trend was also observed in samples Sw30 and Sw60 (71%), SwHe30 and SwHe60 (85%) and SwAc30 and SwAc60 (87%) in Fig. 4C."
13,Conclusion,"The results of this study indicated that the source and pretreatment of inocula had an influence on the continuous hydrogen production in up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactors using sucrose as feedstock. The best inoculum was autofermentation (A) because it was not necessary to collect the sludge and the preparation process was feasible. Moreover, autofermentation did not presuppose any type of cost-intensive pretreatment. However, the H2 production was more stable when the reactor was inoculated with acid-pretreated sludge (SlAc), which could make it ideal pretreatment for scaling up the biohydrogen production process. Although the results obtained in this study were encouraging, a better understanding of conditions in which homoacetogenesis occurs and other factors that lead to unstable hydrogen production will help to further enhance biohydrogen yields."
