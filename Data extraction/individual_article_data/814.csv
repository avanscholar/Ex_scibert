0,Introduction,"The applications of semiconductor photocatalysts to water splitting [1–4], carbon dioxide reduction [5], and nitrogen fixation [6] have been studied extensively as potential solutions to convert solar energy into clean energy since 1970 [7]. Some semiconductors have been widely studied for their excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production, such as CdS [8], g-C3N4 [9] , TiO2 [10,11], AgBr [12] etc. And, constructing heterojunction [13,14] and adjusting morphology [15] are the most common methods. However, in terms of thermodynamics, SrTiO3 is more favorable to photocatalytic hydrogen production than these materials. And SrTiO3 has, as well as the better structural stability [16,17]. Researchers have constructed three-dimensional structures [18,19], adjusted the crystal face [20,21], loaded precious metals [22,23], and synthesized oxide heterojunctions [24–28] to improve the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO3. Though these methods are successful in some aspects, it is still desirable to achieve high photocatalytic activity with a simple synthesis method. In a photocatalytic process, a semiconductor material absorbs photons to create electron-hole pairs, which transfer to the active site on the sample surface before they come into contact with the reactants and trigger redox reactions. Therefore, photocatalytic performance is improved mainly in the following ways: (1) enhance the light absorption ability; (2) improve the specific surface area, which can decrease the carrier migration distance and expose more active sites; (3) enhance the separation efficiency of the electron and hole; and (4) improve the affinity between the catalyst surface and the reactants. Over the years, researchers have conducted many strategies to increase the specific surface area and reduce the carrier recombination rate to improve photocatalytic efficiency, for example, the structure design of the catalyst itself [29–31], the construction of composite materials [32,33], and loading of precious metals [34,35]. The above statements about the photocatalytic process also imply that the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers may be increased by improving the conductivity of the photocatalysts. Hydrogen production can be further promoted by increasing the affinity of the photocatalysts for water molecules. P123, which is a triblock copolymer composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) in an alternating linear manner, has been widely used as a micelle to modulate the morphology and conductivity of nanoparticles [36–38]. The template action of P123 can significantly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of these samples. The interior of the P123 micelle is usually the hydrophobic PPO block, while the corona contains the hydrophilic PEO block. This unique structure may make P123 a valid coating to improve the light-driven water-splitting performance of the photocatalyst. In this work, STO particles with high specific surface areas and surface hydrophilic layers were fabricated by a one-step solvothermal method, which showed high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The modification of STO with P123 not only effectively improved the hydrophilicity but also incorporated a high carrier separation efficiency and low surface charge transfer resistance. The addition of P123 also changed the morphology of SrTiO3 particles, which increased the specific surface area of SrTiO3 particles by 5 times. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of P123@STO is 31 times higher than that of STO. At the same time, P123@STO still showed good photocatalytic hydrogen production stability after four cycles of reaction. This study provides a new strategy for introducing hydrophilic heterojunctions into photocatalytic water splitting."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2), titanium butoxide (Ti(C4H9O)4) and polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (P123) are chemically pure. All these reagents were purchased from Sinopharm."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation SrTiO3 particles modified with carbon particles were synthesized by the solvothermal method. Ti(C4H9O)4 and Sr(NO3)2 were dissolved in 5 ml HNO3 (4 mol/L) solution, the solution was added to 18 ml ethanol containing 0.2 g P123, and 25 ml 5 mol/L NaOH solution was added to the above mixed solution. After stirring for 15 min, 15 ml ethylene glycol was added to the above solution. The mixed solution was stirred for 30 min and aged for 6 h. Then, the mixture was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After the reaction finished, the autoclave was cooled naturally. The resulting product was washed six times with distilled water and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The dried particles were named P123@STO. Pure SrTiO3 (STO) was prepared in a similar manner, where Ti(C4H9O)4 and Sr(NO3)2 were dissolved in 5 ml HNO3 (4 mol/L) solution, and then 60 ml 5 mol/L NaOH solution was added to the above mixture. Then, pure STO was obtained by the same process of heating, centrifugation, and drying."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal phase of the samples was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-TTR III) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm), and the diffraction angle ranged from 20° to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8220) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2011) were used to characterize the morphologies of the samples. The chemical states of the elements were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250). The UV–vis absorbance spectra were obtained by a UV–Vis-Infrared spectrophotometer (SOLID3700). It ranges from 200 to 800 nm. We used the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET, Tristar II 3020 M) to test the specific surface areas and pore structures of the samples. Degassing for two hours at 200 °C. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the samples was characterized by a steady-state transient fluorescence spectrometer (JY Fluorolog-3-Tou). The excitation wavelength of PL spectra is 280 nm. The hydrophilicity of the sample was tested by an optical contact angle measuring instrument (Solon Shanghai Technology Science). The Raman spectra were characterized by a laser Raman spectrometer (LabRamHR Evolution). The Raman laser has a wavelength of 532 nm. FTIR measurements were carried out on a Vector-22 FTIR instrument. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-300 NMR (300 MHz) instrument with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard in CDCl3 or DMSO‑d 6 at 25 °C."
5,Photocatalytic measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic measurement The prepared samples were tested for photocatalytic water splitting in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a scavenger. The test was carried out in a circulating batch reactor connected to an online gas chromatograph (GC-7900, TCD, Ar carrier) under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV). The diameter of the GC column is 4 mm. The light source is ten centimeters away from the reaction solution. The wavelength of the light source is 320–800 nm. The gas products are blown into the gas chromatograph by argon every hour, and the kind and content of gas products were analyzed. In this experiment, 0.01 g of sample was added to a 100 ml aqueous solution containing twenty percent of TEOA. The reactor was vacuumed for 15 min to remove air before the experiment started. During the reaction, the temperature of the reactor was controlled by circulating cooling water. During the stability test, we measured the hydrogen production every four hours. Then, we vacuum the reactor for five minutes. The hydrogen production content of each cycle was accumulated. And, the growth curve was observed to determine the stability of the sample. Finally, the solution was centrifuged to obtain the sample which was tested XRD to characterize its structural stability."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The preparation of the working electrodes for electrochemical testing is described below. We mixed the catalyst (10 mg), carbon black (5 mg), isopropyl alcohol (250 μl), membrane solution (100 μl) and water (750 μl). Then, the mixed solution was dispersed by ultrasound for one hour. Three microliters of the mixed solution was pasted on a glassy carbon electrode, and the prepared electrode was dried in air. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). The performance was tested by applying an alternating current (AC) voltage with a 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and morphology analysis,"3.1 Structure and morphology analysis Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the prepared powder. There is no impurity peak except for the diffraction peak of SrTiO3. It can be seen from the figure that the diffraction peak intensity of P123@STO is weaker than that of STO, which indicates that STO has better crystallinity. This is because the addition of P123 significantly changed the morphology and size of the samples, as shown by SEM images (Fig. 1(b-c)). The pure STO sample is nearly cubic shape and approximately 100–150 nm in size, while the size of P123@STO is calculated with the Scherrer equation [39] to be 22.4 nm. Fig. 1(d-e) shows the TEM images of STO and P123@STO, respectively. The high-resolution analysis of the red circled area in Fig. 1(e) is shown in Fig. 1(f), which shows that there is an obvious organic coating layer [40] on the surface of P123@STO. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of P123@STO and pure STO are shown in Fig. 1(g), indicating an increase in the specific area of P123@STO. The specific surface areas of STO and P123@STO are 9.36 and 48.51 m2/g, respectively. The UV–visible absorption spectrum and bandgap of the samples are shown in Fig. 1(h-i). Both STO and P123@STO have obvious absorption edges at approximately 380 nm. The band gaps of STO and P123@STO are 3.3 and 3.27 eV, respectively, which indicates that there is no significant change in the bandgap between STO and P123@STO. To directly prove the existence of P123 on the surface of P123@STO, 1H NMR was used to detect the PPO and PEO groups. 1H NMR spectra (CDCl3, DMSO‑d 6, ppm) of the P123@STO sample showed peaks at δ (ppm) = 1.5 and 3.3, which correspond to PEO and PPO, respectively (Fig. 2 a) [41,42]. The surface state of the sample was analyzed by XPS. The high-resolution C 1 s XPS spectrum shows three peaks at 284.8, 286 and 288.5 eV, which correspond to C–C, C-O, and C = O, respectively (Fig. 2(b-c)). The C 1 s spectrum of STO consists mainly of the C–C peak, which is attributed to the organic compounds adsorbed on the sample surface (Fig. 2b). Compared with the content of C–C determined from the C 1 s spectrum of STO, the content of C = O has no great change in P123@STO, but the content of C-O increased greatly (Fig. 2c), which is also reflected in the infrared spectrum (Fig. S1). The C-O may be derived from polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene (PEO-PPO-PEO, P123). The infrared spectra of STO, P123@STO, and P123 are shown in Fig. S1. A peak of P123@STO appears at 1453 cm−1, corresponding to the peak of the C-O bond in P123. In contrast, this peak does not appear in the spectrum of pure STO. The XPS survey spectrum of the samples and the high-resolution spectra of Sr, Ti, and O are shown in Fig. S2. The binding energies of Sr, Ti, and O in the XPS spectrum were decreased by 0.1, 0.05 and 0.1 eV, respectively, after organic layer modification. The Raman spectra of the two samples were further compared. P123@STO has a weak vibration peak in the range of 500–900 cm−1, and a large featureless background was observed after 900 cm−1 (Fig. S3). This background demonstrates the presence of an organic layer on the surface of the sample [43]. Fig. 2d shows the preparation process of P123@STO. The triblock copolymer P123 consists of one central hydrophobic group (PPO) and two hydrophilic groups (PEO). The hydrophilic groups are always close to the water during the synthesis process. As a result, the surface of the final sample is covered by a hydrophilic organic layer, which is the source of hydrophilicity. In the photocatalytic process, the hydrophilicity of the sample surface will lead to a better reaction rate between photon-generatedcarriers and water molecules."
9,Photocatalytic test,"3.2 Photocatalytic test The photocatalytic activities of STO and P123@STO were measured by water splitting for hydrogen production. Triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as a sacrificial agent in the reaction process. The H2 evolution activity of the samples is shown in Fig. 3 (a-b). The catalytic effect of pure STO is poor. However, the catalytic effect was greatly improved after the sample was modified by P123 on the surface of STO. Efficient hydrogen production of 402 μmol·g−1·h−1 was successfully realized by P123@STO, which was 31 times that achieved by STO. P123@STO maintained stable and efficient hydrogen production efficiency during 16 h of long-term stability test (Fig. 3b). We tested the XRD patterns of P123@STO before and after 16 h reaction, which was shown in Fig. S4. The XRD patterns showed that the structure of the samples did not change obviously. This reveals that the sample has good stability."
10,Reaction mechanism analysis,"3.3 Reaction mechanism analysis The unique surface structure of the sample, for example, the intrinsic hydrophilic property of a material [44,45], also has a very important impact on the photocatalytic performance. We pressed 0.2 g of the prepared samples into disks at 3 MPa for the surface hydrophilicity test. We photographed the wetting process of STO and P123@STO by using an optical contact angle measuring instrument. The photography speed was 15 frames per second. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4 (a-b). The images of a1 to a5 and b1 to b5 correspond to the wetting processes of STO and P123@STO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, when water is dropped on the sample, the water droplet maintains a clear contact angle with the STO sample for a long time. However, when the water drop comes into contact with the P123@STO sample, it will spread on the sample immediately (Fig. 4b) because the presence of surface hydrophilic groups makes the P123@STO sample highly hydrophilic. To understand the improvement in the photocatalytic performance after surface hydrophilic layer modification, EIS and PL spectra were measured to disclose the charge transfer process of the samples. We obtained EIS spectra by using an electrochemical method to evaluate the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. As shown in Fig. 4c, the charge transfer resistance of P123@STO is greatly reduced compared to that of STO, which is verified by the significantly reduced diameter of the Nyquist circle [46]. The PL spectrum mainly arises from carrier recombination. Thus, the PL spectroscopy is an effective method to analyze the carrier recombination rate [47,48]. The PL spectra of STO and P123@STO were compared (Fig. 4d). The excitation wavelength of PL spectra is 280 nm. The peak at 390 nm corresponds to the bandgap of STO. Compared to that of STO, the emission intensity of P123@STO decreased significantly, which indicates that the carrier recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pair is effectively reduced in the P123@STO samples. It can be seen from TEM and XRD that the crystallization of P123@STO decreases, so, more defects will appear in the P123@STO. The peak at 440 nm corresponds to the oxygen vacancy [49,50]. The excitation peak at 780 nm may come from surface organics. The pure STO can produce electron-hole pairs under light. However, instead of reacting with water molecules, most of the electrons and holes recombine on the surface of the sample, which leads to lower photocatalytic reaction kinetics. The transmission electron microscopy image of P123@STO shows that the hydrophilic organic layer uniformly covered the sample surface, which could form an organic/inorganic hydrophilic heterojunction. And, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and its copolymers have excellent affinity for carriers and contribute to carriers transfer, and the mechanism by which these amphiphilic polymers are beneficial to the conductivity of samples is studied experimentally and theoretically [51–53]. This heterojunction structure can lead to the band bending [54] and direct charger transfer from the interface to the surface, which will facilitate the spatial separation of electrons and holes [29,55]. At the same time, the improvement of surface wettability is beneficial to the dispersion of the sample in water [56] and reduces the adsorption energy of water molecules, which speeds up the frequency at which carriers react with the reactant. The photocatalytic reaction process of P123@STO is schematically shown in Fig. 5 . The inner STO absorbs photons to produce electron-hole pairs. Holes are transferred from the interface to the surface hydrophilic layer. The presence of a surface organic hydrophilic layer accelerates the reaction between holes and triethanolamine molecules, which can accelerate hole consumption. As a result, carrier recombination at the interface is inhibited, and the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is increased. The remaining electrons react with water to produce hydrogen. This method can effectively reduce the carrier recombination rate and improve the photocatalytic performance."
11,Conclusion,"In this work, we synthesized STO nanoparticles with a hydrophilic organic coating surface. Compared with pure STO, P123@STO exhibited greatly improved photocatalytic properties. There are two possible reasons for this improvement: (1) A heterojunction is formed between the conducting organic layer and the inner SrTiO3, which can facilitate carrier direct transfer from the interface to the surface; therefore, the sample has highly efficient spatial separation of carriers. (2) The surface hydrophilic group can increase the affinity between the catalyst surface and water molecules, which can accelerate carrier consumption and reduce surface charge recombination. Thus, the construction of a hydrophilic heterostructure is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic activity of samples. This strategy for the spatial separation of electrons and holes depends on the construction of hydrophilic heterostructures and provides a new method for improving photocatalytic performance."
