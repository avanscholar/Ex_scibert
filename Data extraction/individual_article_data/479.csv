0,Introduction,"Increasing concerns over global climate change, depletion of fossil fuel resources and rising crude oil prices have created a rapidly growing biofuels market. Bioethanol, the most common biofuel today, is already widely used in gasoline engines, either pure or in blends with fossil gasoline, offering higher octane numbers and fuel burning efficiency. Bioethanol is currently produced primarily by fermentation of sugars, an expensive and energy intensive process which uses edible biomass as feedstock. Gasification of biomass to synthesis gas (H2/CO), followed by catalytic conversion of syngas, could produce significant amounts of ethanol, plus higher alcohols that can also be blended in gasoline. Higher alcohols have also been receiving considerable interest recently as suitable green candidates for use in aviation fuel. However, the catalytic conversion of syngas to higher alcohols still remains challenging and no commercial process exists today, limited by the low yields and poor catalyst selectivity that has been reported so far. Today's conditions – the high oil prices and the urgent need to unlock energy from biomass for use as fuels employing current infrastructure – have renewed interest in the synthesis of higher alcohols (HAS) from syngas. A substantial amount of research work has been addressing potential catalysts for the conversion of syngas to higher alcohols. The heterogeneous catalysts employed for the synthesis of ethanol and higher alcohols can be roughly classified in modified low and high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts based on ZnO/Cr2O3 and Cu-Zn-Al respectively, modified Co and Fe Fischer–Tropsch catalysts and Mo-based materials in oxidic and sulfided form. Recent efforts in this respect are summarized in recent reviews of Herman [1], Spivey and Egbebi [2] and Subramani and Gangwal [3] and references therein. Modified Cu-based methanol synthesis catalysts (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 or Cu/ZnO/Cr2O3) are active in the formation of higher alcohols from syngas when promoted with one or more alkali, such as Li, Na, K and Cs [2–4]. Although the composition of the catalysts has not been investigated for HAS, according to Klier [5] a good methanol synthesis catalyst has the composition Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 =60/30/10. In another extensive review by Bart and Sneeden [6], the optimum composition of the catalyst is given to be Cu/Zn/Al=60/35/5. Alkalis were reported to increase the basicity of the catalyst, thus providing basic sites for the aldol-type condensation of lower alcohols to higher alcohols, while additionally titrating the surface acid sites which lead to DME production [2]. Smith and Anderson [7] reported that the addition of potassium carbonate to a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst leads to an increase in the higher alcohol selectivity, particularly for 2-methyl-1-propanol. Similar results were also reported by Ross and co-workers [8] who studied HAS over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts doped with K2CO3 and found that the optimum concentration for the productivity of higher alcohols is at 0.5–1.0wt% K2CO3. Klier et al. [9,10] studied the effect of the addition of various alkali compounds to a Cu/ZnO catalyst and found with this type of catalyst an improvement of the selectivity to higher alcohols in the following sequence: Cs>Rb>K>Na>Li. Non-alkali promoters have also been reported to act beneficially on Cu-based catalysts for higher alcohols production. Materials in this category include non-alkali-promoted Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO/Cr2O3 [11], Cu/Mn/ZrO2 [12,13] and different alkali promoted/unpromoted combinations of all or some of these components (Cu, Co, Zn, Al) [14,15]. Hofstadt et al. [16,17] investigated the addition of different dopants, such as Cr, Ce, La, Mn or Th to a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and claimed that the addition of chromium, thorium, cerium and lanthanum gives large amounts of isobutanol, whereas a catalyst promoted with both chromium and manganese is claimed to produce a large amount of ethanol. Moreover, the addition of MnO was found to favor the formation of ethanol, the addition of Cr2O3 that of propanol and the addition of ThO, that of isobutanol. The addition of Mn [18–21], Cr [18], Th [16–18], Ce [16–19] together with alkali compounds to Cu-based ZnO or Cr2O3 catalysts improved the selectivities to higher alcohols, especially to isobutanol. In this study, we report a systematic investigation of alkali promoted Cu-based modified methanol catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to higher alcohols. The effect of chemical composition in K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al is first examined in order to determine the optimum constituents’ concentration for higher alcohols production. With the intention of further improving the catalytic performance, the effect of substituting Zn and/or Al by Mn and/or Cr is investigated in Cu-Zn-Mn, Cu-Zn-Cr and Cu-Mn-Al catalysts with the optimum molar content. These results are discussed in view of catalyst characterization studies in an attempt to provide explanation on the different component functionalities and their role in the reaction of CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation In order to investigate the effect of chemical composition in K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts, three samples with Cu/Zn/Al molar content of 60/30/10, 45/45/10 and 33/33/33 were prepared via co-precipitation. An aqueous 0.1M solution of Na2CO3 (Merck) was added drop wise to an aqueous solution of the appropriate stoichiometric amounts of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Merck), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Fluka) at 70°C and pH of 6–7. During precipitation, the pH of the suspension was monitored constantly using a pH meter and Na2CO3 solution was added at a controlled rate so as to maintain the prescribed pH (6–7). The resulting precipitate was washed and dried for 24h at 100°C and calcined under air flow for 4h at 350°C. The potassium promoter (0.5wt% K) was added on the resulting solids by dry impregnation with an aqueous solution of K2CO3 (Aldrich), followed by drying and final calcination in synthetic air for 4h at 350°C. The catalysts are referred to as “K-Cu X Zn Y Al Z ” where X, Y and Z refer to the molar content of each metal. To investigate the effect of Zn and/or Al substitution by Cr and/or Mn, three Cu-Zn-Mn, Cu-Zn-Cr and Cu-Mn-Al catalysts were prepared with a constant molar content of 45/45/10 respectively. The materials were synthesized with exactly the same procedure as that described above, replacing the Zn or Al nitrate with Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Merck) or Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma–Aldrich) where appropriate. The catalysts are denoted as K-Cu45Zn45Mn10, K-Cu45Zn45Cr10 and K-Cu45Mn45Al10."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for the determination of the elemental composition of the materials, using a Plasma 400 (PerkinElmer) spectrometer, equipped with Cetac6000AT+ ultrasonic nebulizer. Surface areas of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption at 77K, using the multipoint BET analysis method, with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome flow apparatus. Prior to the measurements, the samples were dehydrated in vacuum at 250°C overnight. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Siemens D500 diffractometer, employing Cu Kα radiation. The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the crystal size of the CuO particles from the X-ray patterns. The morphology of the synthesized materials was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a JEOL 6300 microscope, coupled with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (X-ray EDS, Oxford Link ISIS-2000) for local elemental composition determination. The reduction characteristics of the catalysts were studied by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), performed on the same apparatus as the dispersion experiments. Typically, the catalyst sample (100mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pretreated in flowing He for 0.5h at 350°C, followed by cooling at room temperature. The temperature was then raised from room temperature to 800°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min in a 5%H2/He flow (50cm3/min). The main (m/z) fragments registered were: H2 =2, H2O=18 and He=4. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD-NH3) was used to determine the acid properties. Experiments were performed on the same apparatus as described above. The catalysts (100mg) were pretreated at 350°C for 0.5h and then cooled to 100°C under He flow. The pretreated samples were saturated with 5% NH3/He for 1h at 100°C, with subsequent flushing with helium at 100°C for 2h to remove the physisorbed ammonia. TPD analysis was carried out from 100°C to 700°C, at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The (m/z) fragments registered were as follows: NH3 =15; H2O=18; N2 =28; NO=30; N2O=44 and NO2 =46. Quantitative analysis of the desorbed ammonia was based on (m/z) 15."
4,Catalytic reaction tests,"2.3 Catalytic reaction tests The catalytic performance of the samples in carbon monoxide hydrogenation was measured in a high pressure small-scale test unit of CPERI, a newly constructed versatile unit for the evaluation of the activity and selectivity of solid catalytic materials in different high pressure reactions. The feed inflow system of the unit consists of three gas lines, controlled by high accuracy mass flow controllers. The unit operates with a stainless steel fixed bed reactor (ID: 9.3mm), externally heated with a three-zone furnace, while the exit stream of the reactor is cooled via a heat exchanger and is directed to a system of vessels for the separation and collection of the liquid and gaseous products. The reaction temperature is monitored with a thermocouple inserted in the catalytic bed. The test facility can operate to a temperature range up to 600°C and pressures up to 100atm. The samples were first diluted with equal amount of SiC particles of the same size to achieve isothermal operation and were then loaded in the fixed bed reactor, where they were reduced in situ under pure hydrogen at 350°C for 3h and atmospheric pressure. The higher alcohol synthesis reaction was investigated in the temperature range 300–320°C at 40bar, W/F ratio of 0.74gs/cm3 and inlet feed composition H2/CO=2. The steady-state activity measurements were taken after at least 24h on-stream. The gaseous products were analyzed on-line, while liquids were collected in a trap (−15°C) for 24h and were analyzed offline. The analysis was performed with a GC Agilent 7890A equipped with two detectors (FID and TCD) and three columns (MS, Porapak Q and DB-FFAP) in a series-bypass configuration. CO conversion was calculated as the mole percentage of carbon monoxide converted to products: (1) CO conversion ( mol % ) = CO in − CO out CO out × 100 Carbon selectivity was defined as the moles of carbon in a given product to the total moles of carbon converted in both liquid and gas streams: (2) selectivity ( C mol % ) = moles of a given product × number of carbons in product CO in − CO out Space time yield (STY) was calculated as the weight of each alcohol produced per unit mass catalyst and per unit time: (3) STY ( mg / g cat h ) = weight of produced alcohol catalyst weight × time"

6,Effect of chemical composition in K-CuZnAl catalysts,"3.1 Effect of chemical composition in K-CuZnAl catalysts 3.1.1 Catalyst characterization The main physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts with varying Cu/Zn/Al chemical composition are tabulated in Table 1 . The BET measurements show that similar surface areas are achieved for all samples, in the range of 33–46m2/g, indicating that the variation in chemical composition does not significantly affect the textural properties of the materials. ICP measurements show a good agreement between the nominal and the actual chemical composition of the solids. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases in the oxidic form of the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples. The three catalysts share similar structural characteristics, with CuO and ZnO being the dominant phases independent of the chemical composition. The samples exhibit in general poor and highly disordered crystallization, however a distinct decrease of crystallinity is evident with increasing Al content. Previous studies on Cu-Zn-Al catalysts showed that the higher the Al content the lower the CuO crystallinity [22], in accordance with our results. This observation is reflected also on the size of the CuO particles in the materials calculated using the Scherrer equation. For the catalyst with the highest Al content, K-Cu33Zn33Al33, the particle size could not even be determined as there are no well-defined peaks. For the other two samples, the catalysts contain CuO nanoparticles in the range of 6–8nm. Reducibility is a very important property in these materials, as they are active at reduced state and have to be pre-reduced prior to the CO hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, the reduction characteristics of the catalysts were explored with TPR in hydrogen. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 2 , were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadruple mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temperature. The reduction profiles of the three promoted Cu-Zn-Al samples demonstrate only one relatively narrow reduction peak, with maximum reduction temperatures in the range of 290–360°C. The calculated values of experimental to theoretical H2 consumption assuming only CuO reduction (see Table 1) are close to unity for all materials. Therefore, copper seems to be the only reducible species under these conditions. In terms of the ease of reduction, some differences are recorded upon varying the chemical composition. While the K-Cu33Zn33Al33 and K-Cu45Zn45Al10 samples both exhibit similar reduction T max (∼360°C), a 70°C shift at lower temperature is recorded for the K-Cu60Zn30Al10 catalyst. Taking into account the chemical composition, K-Cu60Zn30Al10 has a Cu/Zn atomic ratio of 2 compared to the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 sample with Cu/Zn ratio of 1. The decreased Cu/Zn ratio could explain the higher T max of reduction for K-Cu45Zn45Al10, as the higher content of Zn implies stronger interaction between Cu and Zn which could inhibit the ease of CuO reduction. The K-Cu33Zn33Al33 catalyst also presents increased reduction temperature. Besides the Cu and Zn interaction, an additional factor contributing to this could be the high aluminum content. It can be postulated that at high aluminum contents the formation of a surface amorphous CuAl2O4 spinel that could shift reduction at higher temperatures is possible, as these species are relatively harder to reduce than CuO [22]. 3.1.2 Catalytic performance in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols The performance of the K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts in the higher alcohol synthesis reaction at 300°C and 320°C, in terms of CO conversion and carbon-based selectivity to the different products, is shown in Table 2 . Concerning reactivity toward carbon monoxide, the relationship between activities with temperature is not straightforward as in all samples relatively small differences were observed in CO conversion with temperature increase. In two of the samples, the temperature increase induces a small increase in reactivity, while minor reduction is recorded for the other K-CuZnAl catalyst. Although in principle the specific activity increases with increasing reaction temperature, the insensitivity to temperature observed in this case may be associated with partial sintering of the copper metal particles under the reducing atmosphere imposed by the H2/CO reaction feed and the high pressure in the reactor, as previously reported for similar catalytic systems [23]. Sintering of copper would decrease the exposed surface copper and thus the available reaction active sites, causing a drop in activity. This drop is counteracted by the temperature increase and as a result no important differences are recorded. The main reaction products over the K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts were alcohols, with methanol being the major carbon oxygenated product, along with CO2 and small concentrations of hydrocarbons (see Table 2). On all samples, the increase of temperature brings about a sharp increase in hydrocarbons and CO2 concentration at the expense of alcohols formation. According to reviews by Forzatti et al. [24], Gupta et al. [4] and references therein, alcohol synthesis – and in particular higher alcohols synthesis – is usually favorable only in a narrow range of temperatures, 280–310°C, as higher temperatures enhance significantly the formation of hydrocarbons and CO2. Carbon dioxide is formed via the water gas shift reaction which is also catalyzed by Cu-based catalysts [24]. Fig. 3 illustrates a detailed distribution of the produced alcohols over the K-Cu60Zn30Al10 sample at 300 and 320°C. Similar behavior was observed for all K-CuZnAl catalysts with varying chemical composition. It can be observed that the synthesis yields preferentially primary alcohols with up to five carbon atoms. Among the primary alcohols 2-methyl branched alcohols, namely 2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol, are most abundant, together with ethanol and propanol – excluding of course methanol which is the dominant product. The increase of temperature from 300°C to 320°C has as expected a positive effect on higher alcohol production, which increases at the expense of methanol. According to a review by Forzatti et al. [24], this is due to the kinetics of HAS, which increases with temperature, whereas the equilibrium of the methanol synthesis implies lower concentrations of methanol, resulting in an improvement in the selectivity ratio of higher alcohols-to-methanol. Among the higher alcohols, the concentration of branched species seems to increase more with temperature. This behavior is consistent with the terminal nature of 2-methyl branched alcohols and the intermediate nature of linear primary alcohols [24]. The variation in the Cu/Zn/Al chemical composition induces somewhat limited changes in the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Before discussing these changes, it is considered useful to briefly outline the functionalities of the different components in the Cu-Zn-Al catalysts. There is a general agreement in literature that copper constitutes the active phase for CO and CO2 adsorption and activation, while Al2O3 acts as stabilizer of the catalyst structure, thereby reducing sintering [25]. Although ZnO was initially thought to just improve catalytic performance by minimizing the sintering of Cu during the aging/calcination step [26], the importance of the Cu–ZnO interface has been recognized and catalytic activity is suggested to originate from this interface [27]. ZnO stabilizes copper in a partially oxidized state, Cu δ+, by its incorporation into the ZnO lattice. It was suggested that the Cu δ+-ZnO centers, which have a higher reactivity than metallic copper, comprise the active sites for CO activation [28]. A review of the reactivity values in Table 2 shows that the K-Cu60Zn30Al10 and the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 exhibit similar CO conversion levels of around 20%, while a decrease is recorded for the K-Cu33Zn33Al33 sample. Given that copper is the active site for CO activation, the reduced reactivity of this catalyst can be attributed to the lower Cu content of the catalyst (see ICP results, Table 1). Still, even when activity is calculated on the basis of Cu content, K-Cu33Zn33Al33 is less active by approximately ∼17% compared to K-Cu45Zn45Al10. The origin of the observed decreased reactivity per copper site is unclear, as it was not possible to estimate the dispersion of Cu on the surface of this sample from the XRD results. However, in literature it has also been suggested that the high Al2O3 concentration could play a role toward the reduced activity. Gusi et al. [29] investigated the performance of Cu-Zn-Al catalysts with different Cu/Zn atomic ratios and Al contents and observed that, for all the Cu/Zn ratios studied, the activity per kilogram of copper decreases with increasing aluminum content, especially for Al concentrations higher than 10%. This inhibitive property of aluminum was attributed to an inflicted decrease in copper reactivity, but no further analysis was provided. Concerning the product distribution, we can see that the variation of the Cu/Zn atomic ratio from 2 to 1 with constant Al content in the K-Cu60Zn30Al10 and K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalysts increases higher alcohol selectivity by 30% at the expense of HC and CO2 formation, with methanol selectivity remaining constant. From the detailed distribution of the alcohol product, illustrated in Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the most abundant higher alcohol is ethanol, followed by C4+OH (methyl-propanols, butanol and pentanol) and then propanols. In the K-Cu33Zn33Al33 catalyst, the higher alcohols selectivity decreases significantly, with a simultaneous increase in methanol formation. This decrease can be probably attributed again to the high Al content. As discussed in Section 1, the formation of higher alcohols proceeds on basic sites, which promote the necessary aldol-type reactions. The acidic character of alumina possible reduces the amount of basic sites on the catalyst, thereby retarding the C1→C2 step, leading to high methanol but low higher alcohol formation. In general, the effect of the Cu/Zn ratio on the catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation is not straightforward and it was found to depend strongly on the preparation method [30], as well as the gas mixture composition [29]. The same applies for the aluminum content, with controversial reports appearing in literature and some authors [29,30] observing an inhibitive effect on alcohol formation with increasing Al content (especially above about 10%), others observing either no effect [31] or a promoting effect [5]. For the preparation method employed in the present work and the specific gas composition employed as feed, the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalyst exhibited the highest CO conversion, as well as the maximum selectivity for higher alcohols."
7,Effect of Zn and/or Al substitution by Cr and/or Mn in K/Cu-Zn-Al catalysts,"3.2 Effect of Zn and/or Al substitution by Cr and/or Mn in K/Cu-Zn-Al catalysts As shown in the previous section, the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalyst exhibited the optimum catalytic performance in terms of both selectivity to higher alcohols and activity in the reaction. After selecting the optimum elemental composition of the Cu-Zn-Al system for higher alcohols production and in an effort to further improve the catalytic performance, the effect of substituting Zn and/or Al by Mn and/or Cr was investigated. The choice of Mn was based on its reported ability to increase selectivity to higher alcohols [11,18–21], while Cr was selected as it was claimed that it greatly promotes production of ethanol [16,17]. Accordingly, three K-promoted Cu-Zn-Mn, Cu-Zn-Cr and Cu-Mn-Al catalysts with a constant molar content of 45/45/10 were prepared, characterized and tested in the CO hydrogenation reaction. 3.2.1 Catalyst characterization The main physicochemical characteristics and properties of the three catalysts, as well as those of the K-Cu-Zn-Al which are repeated here as reference, are shown in Table 3 . Similarly to the results for the catalysts with different chemical composition, the substitution by Mn and/or Cr of either Zn or Al does not seem to greatly affect the attained surface areas of the samples, which remain in the 30–48m2/g range. Likewise, ICP analysis shows that the intended chemical composition is largely achieved in all the as-synthesized materials. The crystal phases formed in the substituted catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . The reference K-Cu-Zn-Al catalyst exhibits only highly unordered crystallization of CuO and ZnO. The crystallization seems to improve with the substitution of Al by both Cr and Mn and is accompanied by the formation of new crystalline phases. In the K-Cu45Zn45Mn10 catalyst, the crystal phases of CuO and ZnO are much better defined than in the reference material. In addition, small amounts of CuMn2O4 seem to be also present, indicating that Cu might combine with Mn to form a spinel phase, as previously reported [32]. The XRD pattern of the K-Cu45Zn45Cr10 is very similar to that of K-Cu45Zn45Mn10, with good crystallization of CuO and ZnO. Again, the formation of traces of spinels, like ZnCr2O4 and/or CuCr2O4, cannot be excluded. It should be noted that it is in general very difficult to discriminate between the different spinels, as their XRD patterns share many common features. On the contrary, the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 sample exhibits a completely different crystal structure, with a single well-defined crystalline phase, attributed to the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel. Diffraction peaks of CuO are not detected, indicating the strong interaction between Cu and Mn and the incorporation of copper ions into the spinel lattice. Similar results have been reported by Du et al. [33] for doped and undoped Cu-Mn catalysts. Analysis of the XRD patterns allowed the calculation of the CuO particle size in the reference K-Cu-Zn-Al catalyst and the Mn/Cr substituted materials, presented in Table 3. In the case of the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst, the particle size refers to the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel phase that was the single crystalline structure detected on this material. As discussed previously in the manuscript, the CuO phase in the reference K-Cu45Zn45Al10 sample consists of small nano-particles in the range of 8nm. The substitution of Zn and/or Al by Cr and/or Mn affects significantly this property, as a large increase of the particle size is observed. The CuO crystals seem to almost triple in size compared to the reference, as evidenced by the strengthening of the CuO diffraction lines. The introduction of different metals (Cr or Mn) and in different positions (Zn or Al) has no additional effect, with all three other samples exhibiting similar CuO (or Cu1.5Mn1.5O4) particle sizes around 23–27nm. The surface morphology of the synthesized materials was examined by SEM. Micrographs of K-Cu45Zn45Al10, K-Cu45Zn45Mn10, K-Cu45Zn45Cr10 and K-Cu45Mn45Al10 are presented in Fig. 6(A)–(D). The reference K-Cu45Zn45Al10 sample consists of aggregates of around ∼1–2μm, with the particles exhibiting a distinct needle-like morphology. The substitution of Al by Mn and Cr induces significant changes in the morphology, as shown in Fig. 6(B) and (C) respectively. Larger aggregates of sponge-like appearance seem to be formed, while the particles are more spherical and well-defined, reflecting the higher crystallinity detected by XRD and the larger CuO particle size. In the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst, where Zn is substituted with Mn, a more homogeneous morphology with clear spherical particles in the range of 1–2μm is apparent. This could be associated with the existence of a single crystal phase in the material, identified by XRD as the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel. X-ray EDS analysis performed on all samples demonstrated that all elements are homogeneously distributed on the catalytic surface. Moreover, local elemental compositions close to nominal were measured for all the as-synthesized catalysts. Fig. 7 illustrates the TPR profiles of the Mn and Cr substituted K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts. As previously described, the reference K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalyst exhibits a single reduction peak, with a maximum at 360°C, corresponding to full reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0. When Al is substituted with Mn and Cr, a clear shift of the reduction maximum to lower temperatures is recorded, at 310°C and 290°C, respectively. In both samples, the peaks are asymmetric with a broad shoulder at the low temperature end of the curve. Moreover, quantification of the TPR curves shows that the amount of H2 consumed over both samples exceeds the theoretical stoichiometric amount necessary for full reduction of the copper contained in the materials by about 60%. Therefore, a reduction of Cr and Mn in the samples also occurs. Still, the main reducible species remains copper, whose reduction seems to be facilitated by the presence of the two transition metals. Li et al. [34], who investigated the effect of Mn doping in methanol synthesis Cu-Zn-Al catalysts, also report that Mn assists the reduction of copper particles in agreement with our observations. Finally, the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 sample exhibits a TPR profile with contributions from three different reduction steps. A first small peak is observed at 250°C, followed by a broader peak which extends up to 410°C, with two distinct maxima at 350°C and 370°C. Quantification shows that the hydrogen consumption is double of that corresponding to full reduction of copper in the sample, indicating clearly the reduction of manganese as well. The TPR profile agrees well with the results reported by Behar et al. [35] for the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel phase, of which the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst consists as shown by XRD. A precise qualitative and quantitative interpretation of each TPR peak is difficult, due to the multiple possible valences of copper and manganese oxides [35]. Acidity was determined by temperature programmed desorption, after saturation of the catalytic surface with ammonia at 100°C. The main desorption product was in all cases NH3, while traces of N2, NO and N2O were also detected. The ammonia desorption curves are compiled in Fig. 8 and the acidity of the catalysts (expressed as mol of desorbed NH3/m2) is tabulated in Table 3. A wide strength distribution of acid sites is apparent on all materials, which can be related to the contribution of the different metal oxides of Al, Cu, Zn, Mn and Cr in the final catalytic materials. In particular, the NH3 profiles exhibit desorption peaks in two different temperature ranges: 200–350°C (site I) and 450–550°C (site II). These peaks can be tentatively assigned to weak/medium and strong acid sites. In order to quantify the amount of each type of acid site, peak fitting was performed involving deconvolution with the use of mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions. The deconvoluted peaks, as well as the amount of sites per type of acid site, are also shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3 respectively. The ammonia desorption profile of the reference K-Cu45Zn45Al10 sample exhibits two well-defined desorption peaks at 280°C and 460°C. Acid sites from all three components in the catalytic formulation contribute to the detected ammonia desorption. According to Turko et al. [36,37] who studied the TPD-NH3 profiles of pure ZnO and Al2O3, both oxides exhibit acidic sites of types I and II. Type I sites can be attributed to weak interactions that can occur between the OH groups of the oxides and NH3 through H-bond formation, while type II are stronger Lewis acid sites related to Al3+ or Zn2+. Turko et al. [37] also investigated the TPD-profile of CuO and report that the acid sites in CuO are only of Lewis type, being related to coordinatively unsaturated Cu2+ ions, and appear in the 200–300°C temperature range. Therefore, in the case of the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalyst it can be postulated that both medium and strong acid sites can be primarily attributed to contributions from ZnO and Al2O3 which exist on the material, as evidenced by XRD, while CuO is responsible for weak/medium acidity. When Al is substituted by Mn in the K-Cu45Zn45Mn10 sample, the ammonia desorption peaks become broader, while an increase in the amount and strength of type II sites is apparent. Given that the amount of copper is similar to that in the reference catalyst, the decrease of type I sites could be explained by the absence of Al2O3, while the increase of the strong acid sites is ascribed to the introduction of Mn2+ ions whose acidity is stronger than that of Al3+ ions [38]. In terms however of total acidity, a reduction in the number of acid sites is recorded compared to the reference material. In K-Cu45Zn45Cr10, a substantial change in the ammonia desorption profile is recorded. Although acidic sites of type I remain largely unaffected compared to the reference catalyst, type II sites exhibit a much broader temperature desorption range, with the T max of desorption shifting considerably lower by ca. 50–80°C. Moreover, the Cr-substituted catalyst exhibits the highest total acidity among all investigated materials. Finally, in the last sample where Zn is substituted by Mn (K-Cu45Mn45Al10), two distinct peaks are again observed with type II acid sites being the dominant ones. Similarly to the K-Cu45Zn45Mn10 catalyst, the increase in the ratio of medium/weak strength acid sites can be related to the introduction of Mn2+ ions. The most significant changes in the number of acid sites are recorded for this material, as total acidity drops by almost 50% compared to the reference case (see Table 3). 3.2.2 Catalytic performance in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols The performance of the Mn and Cr substituted K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts in the higher alcohol synthesis reaction at 300°C and 320°C, in terms of CO conversion and carbon-based selectivity to the different products, is shown in Table 4 . Much like in the case of the K-Cu-Zn-Al catalysts with different chemical composition, activity is insensitive to the temperature increase on all samples, reflecting partial sintering of copper at high temperatures. Comparing the different catalysts, it can be observed that the substitution process reduces the activity by more than 50%, dropping CO conversion from around 20% for the reference K-Cu45Zn45Al10 to ∼10% for all other catalysts. The introduction of different metals (Cr or Mn) and in different positions (Zn or Al) has no additional effect, with all three other samples exhibiting similar affinity in activating carbon monoxide. This significant decrease in activity can be related to the larger CuO particles on the substituted materials, as calculated from the XRD patterns and shown in Table 3. While the reference catalyst has small CuO nano-particles, all other three substituted samples demonstrate three times larger CuO crystals in the same range (∼25nm). Although the catalysts are reduced in their active form and metallic copper is the active phase, it can be argued that the size of CuO provides a tendency on the dispersion of copper. In this light, the reduced activity of the substituted catalysts can be attributed to lower dispersion of the copper active phase because of the larger crystallites, leading to reduced active copper surface area available for the activation of carbon monoxide. In terms of products, methanol again dominates the product spectrum on all materials, with temperature increase bringing about a decrease in methanol formation and favoring the production of hydrocarbons and mainly CO2 (see Table 4). On the other hand, the higher temperature leads to alcohols with longer carbon chain at the expense of methanol, similar to what was observed also for the catalysts with different chemical composition. Comparison of the catalytic performance shows that the substitution process induces changes in the selectivity of the CO hydrogenation reaction. The substitution of Al by Mn in the K-Cu45Zn45Mn10 sample reduces the CO2 and HC formation, increasing methanol formation, while the HAS selectivity remains unaltered. The detailed distribution of the produced alcohols presented in Fig. 9 demonstrates however that the presence of Mn favors the synthesis of alcohols with carbon chain length over four, in contrast to the reference catalyst which preferentially yields ethanol. Still, overall the inflicted modifications are small. The use of Mn as promoter in Cu-Zn-Al catalysts was previously reported to increase selectivity to higher alcohols [11,18–21]. The addition of manganese in the Cu-Zn-Al catalyst was also found to enhance the hydrogen adsorption capacity and increase the amount of adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst leading to higher activity [39]. Neither higher HAS selectivity nor enhanced activity was observed in our case, indicating that the addition of small amounts of Mn as a replacement to Al does not have a prominent effect. When however Mn is added in large amounts, significant modifications are induced as discussed below for the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst. Over the K-Cu45Zn45Cr10 sample, where Al is substituted by Cr, the main changes that occur are the significant increase of alcohol selectivity at the expense of CO2. Among alcohols, the presence of Cr favors the formation of methanol and reduces the homologation of the alcohol chain. The detailed distribution of the alcohols, illustrated in Fig. 9, shows that over the Cr-containing catalyst the highest concentration of methanol is attained, followed by equal amounts of ethanol, propanol and C4+OH. The role of Cr2O3 in commercial catalysts is thought to be similar to that of Al2O3, which is to act as stabilizer of the structure of the copper catalyst, thereby reducing sintering. However, based on studies investigating the effects of chromium, zinc and cobalt additives on the properties of skeletal copper catalysts for the reactions of methanol synthesis, water gas shift and methanol steam reforming [25,40], Cr2O3 also promotes the activity of copper for the methanol synthesis reaction and increases selectivity to methanol by reducing the water gas shift reaction. This is consistent with our results since the increase of methanol selectivity is accompanied by reduced CO2 selectivity. Nevertheless, the K-Cu45Zn45Cr10 catalyst is not suitable for HAS, as it exhibits the lowest selectivity to higher products among all studied catalysts. Similar conclusions were also drawn by Nunan et al. [41] who compared product yields and selectivities over Cs/Cu/ZnO/A12O3 and Cs/Cu/ZnO/Cr2O3 catalysts. Their results also clearly showed that replacing Cr with Al results in a poorer higher alcohol synthesis catalyst. The most appreciable changes are recorded for the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst, where Mn substitutes Zn in the catalyst formulation. A significant decrease in methanol selectivity is evidenced, with concurrent increase in CO2 and hydrocarbon formation. The most striking feature is however the 50% increase in higher alcohol synthesis, compared to the base case, which renders the catalyst the most selective among the investigated materials for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. It is also noteworthy that the catalyst produces longer chain alcohols, as an inspection of Fig. 9, demonstrates that C4+OH (methyl-propanols, butanol and pentanol) are in higher concentration in the mixture of higher alcohols, followed by propanol and finally ethanol. The addition of MnO to a CuO/ZnO catalyst was also found to considerably decrease the overall activity, associated however with a decrease in the production of methanol and a substantial increase in the selectivity to higher alcohols [19], in accordance to our results. The determination of the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts can provide some insight on the beneficial influence of Zn substitution by Mn in the K-Cu45Mn45Al10. Whereas all other materials comprise of low crystallinity CuO and ZnO phases, K-Cu-Mn-Al consists of the well-defined crystalline Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel. As discussed also in the characterization section diffraction peaks of CuO were not detected, indicating a strong interaction between Cu and Mn and incorporation of copper ions into the spinel lattice. This interaction could aid in preserving copper in a partially oxidized state, providing active sites for higher alcohols formation. The effects of the Zn and/or Al substitution by Mn and/or Cr on the higher alcohol production could also be related to the acidity of the materials. As mentioned in Section 1, alkalis are necessary for HAS formation as they increase the basicity of the catalyst, thus providing basic sites for the aldol-type condensation of lower alcohols to higher alcohols [2]. One can thus infer that less acidity and more basicity is required on the catalysts for the various CC and CO bond-forming reactions to take place. In light of this, the selectivity to higher alcohols at 300°C is plotted as a function of total acidity in Fig. 10 . Although the number of data points is limited, a clear tendency of increasing higher alcohol production with decreasing acidity is apparent. This inverse correlation between acidity and selectivity is in accordance with the general notion that higher alcohol formation requires basic sites and indicates that reduced acidity is needed for the aldol-type condensation reactions. The replacement of Zn by Mn in K-Cu-Mn-Al reduces acidity and thus promotes the production of the desired higher alcohol products."
8,Conclusions,"Hydrogenation of CO over K promoted Cu-based catalysts produced alcohols, with methanol being the major carbon oxygenated product, along with little CO2 and hydrocarbons. In terms of higher alcohols, the synthesis yielded preferentially primary 2-methyl branched alcohols with up to five carbons together with ethanol and propanol. Variation of the Cu/Zn/Al chemical composition in a series of K-promoted Cu-Zn-Al catalysts induced changes in the catalytic performance. Decreasing the Cu/Zn atomic ratio from 2 to 1 with constant Al content increased higher alcohol selectivity by 30% at the expense of HC and CO2. On the other hand, increasing the Al content with a constant Cu/Zn ratio of 1 significantly reduced the formation of higher alcohols and increased methanol production. This can be attributed to the acidic character of alumina, which reduces the basic sites on the catalyst, thereby retarding the C1→C2 step. Overall, the K-Cu45Zn45Al10 catalyst exhibited the optimum performance in terms of both activity and selectivity to higher alcohols. In an effort to further improve the catalytic performance, the effect of substituting Zn and/or Al by Mn and/or Cr was investigated for the optimum Cu/Zn/Al=45/45/10 composition. The substitution reduced activity by more than 50%, probably due to the lower exposed copper surface area as indicated by the formation of larger CuO crystals. The presence of Mn favored the formation of alcohols with carbon chain length over four, in contrast to the reference catalyst which preferentially yielded ethanol. On the other hand, replacing Cr with Al resulted in a poorer higher alcohol synthesis catalyst. The most appreciable changes were recorded for the K-Cu45Mn45Al10 catalyst. A significant decrease in methanol formation was evidenced, with concurrent increase in CO2 and hydrocarbon formation. The most striking feature was however the 50% increase in higher alcohol formation, compared to the base case, which rendered the catalyst the most selective among the investigated materials. Characterization of the catalysts provided some insight on the beneficial influence of Zn substitution by Mn in K-Cu45Mn45Al10. Whereas all other materials comprise of low crystallinity CuO and ZnO phases, K-Cu-Mn-Al consists of the well-defined crystalline Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel, indicating a strong interaction between Cu and Mn and incorporation of copper ions into the spinel lattice. This interaction could aid in preserving copper in a partially oxidized state, providing active sites for higher alcohols formation. Moreover, a clear tendency of increasing higher alcohol production with decreasing acidity was evidenced. This inverse correlation between acidity and selectivity is in accordance with the general notion that higher alcohol formation requires basic sites and indicates that reduced acidity is needed for the aldol-type condensation reactions."
