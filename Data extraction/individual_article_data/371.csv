0,Introduction,"The application of the renewable clean energy has become very urgent and necessary on account of the deteriorating environmental issues caused by fossil fuel usage [1–5]. As a clean and sustainable energy source, hydrogen has drawn significant attention in recent years [6]. In industry, more than 95% of hydrogen is produced by the stream methane reforming and coal gasification, which are both greenhouse gas (CO2) emitting processes based on the finite and non-renewable fossil fuels [7]. Interest in electrochemically splitting water into hydrogen has been aroused for its environment-friendly, greenhouse-gas-free properties [8]. Nonetheless, the applicability of this splitting process is limited by the high cost and low abundance of the noble-metal electrocatalysts designed for overcoming the energy barriers of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a low overpotential [9]. Although water electrolysis has been studied for a long time, continuous technology optimization and catalysts innovation are still imminently imperative to drastically reduce the cost and break through the barrier of this process [10]. As a consequence, although the Pt-based noble metal catalysts are the most active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, developing efficient cheap materials, consisted of earth-abundant elements and non-precious metal, is of great importance to provide cost-competitive hydrogen. Pt is one of the most well-documented HER catalysts with an overpotential close to 0 mV versus RHE. However, due to Pt's high price (>$50 g−1) and rare reserves in the earth crust, researchers are investigating alternative materials including metal chalcogenides [11] (MoS2, WS2, Ni3S2 and CoSe), metal phosphides [12–14], (Ni2P, Cu3P, Co2P and FeP), metal nitrides [15] and carbides [16] (Mo2C, WC, Mo2N and NiMoNx/C) and the heteroatom-doped nanocarbons [17] (N/B/S/P-doped graphene and g-C3N4 coupled N-graphene). Among these transition-metal monoxides and metal-free materials, transition-metal carbides especially molybdenum-based carbides are prominent in light of their atoxic preparation produce, wide PH applicability, and adjustable characterizations correlated with phase and component, and the unique d-band electronic structures and Pt-like catalytic properties [16,18]. So far, there are generally two major strategies to maximize the HER activity of molybdenum carbide-based materials. The first strategy is to increase the intrinsic activity of active sites by integrating atoms with different catalytic functions. By introducing various heteroatoms such as Fe [29], Co [27], Ni [28], N and S [19] into molybdenum carbide, previous researchers have successfully reduced the unoccupied d orbitals of Mo and thus weaken the restriction of the Hads energy in HER kinetics. However, few research has been focused on multi-component molybdenum carbide based HER catalysts, especially nano-sized ones with controlled morphology. In the compound containing different phases other than molybdenum carbide, different active sites are close to each other at atomic scale and function synergistically. There are also many reports correlated with the functional inorganic nanostructures of the materials, which match with lots of simple, effective and novel methods and demonstrate excellent performance in their property-applications [20–25]. Broadly speaking, the appropriate nanostructure is conducive to the property to a certain degree [26,27]. As a consequence, the second strategy is to expose more active sites to the electrolyte by preparing molybdenum carbide with controlled structure, which not only enhances activity by enlarging electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) but also improves stability by alleviating agglomeration. In recent years, different nanostructures, such as nanowires [28,29], nanorods [30,31], nanotubes [32,33], and nanoparticles [34], successfully improve the HER performance via abundant active sites, high conductivity and flexibility deriving from the continuous charge transportation with short diffusion resistance. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose here that highly active HER performance can be achieved by combining multicomponent catalyst with morphology control, which is technically challenging especially for carbide prepared at temperature higher than 500 °C. Considering these aspects together, in conformity with the objective of developing effective non-precious electrocatalyst to replace Pt via simple, cheap and environmentally friendly synthetic pathways, the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres were prepared via a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) protected method for HER for the first time in the current work. The PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres are self-supported with uniform size and rough surface, which offers several advantages. First, the performance of hydrogen production from water can be facilitated effectively by the presence of nitrogen and carbon atoms in the vicinity of the catalytic molybdenum center, namely by the synergistic effect between Mo2C and Mo2N. Second, although the catalyst is carbonized under temperature as high as 650 °C, the PVA protection leads to an average particle size of only ∼500 nm and surface roughness, which properly balances the tradeoff between ECSA and stability. Third, since the HER is a gas-generating process, the self-supported PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres alleviate the nanoparticle loss from support materials during the reaction. Consequently, the PVA protected PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N multicomponent electrocatalysts with controlled morphology carbonized under a low temperature of 650 °C exhibit excellent HER activity in acidic (ƞ10 = 132 mV, ƞ100 = 176 mV and a low Tafel slope 51.8 mV dec−1) and alkaline (ƞ10 = 142 mV and a small Tafel slope 50.4 mV dec−1) solution, rendering it one of the best electrocatalysts among the reported catalysts towards electrocatalytic water reduction. The present strategy is a general approach, which is applicable to other electrocatalytic reactions. Nonetheless, the quick and strong reaction between the melamine and molybdate leads to the wall of the resulting spherical samples is a little thick, which reduces the utilization of the catalysts to some extent. Therefore, the shortcoming defines one of the research directions and the further work will renovate it."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were of reagent grade and used for synthesis without further purification. Ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, AHM) (99%), formaldehyde solution (HCHO) (37% in H2O), melamine (C3N3 (NH2)3, MA) (99%), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (99%) and acetic acid (CH3COOH) (99%) are purchased from Kemiou of China. Platinum on carbide (40% Pt/C) is purchased from Aladdin."
3,Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol protected molybdenum carbide nanospheres,"2.2 Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol protected molybdenum carbide nanospheres The melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin nanospheres were prepared via a modified solution phase method [35]. The synthesis scheme depends on in situ carburization reaction between the organic ligands of melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin nanospheres and the guest ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) adhering to the surface and pores of the MF nanospheres host. The pivotal element in the formation of molybdenum carbide nanospheres is the application of the polyvinyl alcohol, the soft template, which efficiently accelerates and protects the spherical structure and chains up the nitrogen adopted to the nitrogen dropping and molybdenum nitride synthesis. The single-source precursor consisting of both molybdenum source and organic carbon source enables efficient synthesis of transition metal carbides such as molybdenum and tungsten carbide. In brief, 6 mg ml−1 PVA solution and 1.2 ml acetic acid were added to the homogeneous and transparent melamine-formaldehyde solution simultaneously. After stirring for 6 min at 60 °C, a milky suspension consisting of melamine-formaldehyde nanospheres was collected by centrifugation, followed by washing several times with distilled water for subsequent application. The ammonium heptamolybdate encapsulated MF nanospheres (MF@AHM nanospheres) were prepared by rapidly dispersing the MF nanospheres in the ammonium molybdate solution [36]. Then, the as-prepared MF@AHM nanospheres were collected by sequential filtering, washing, and drying at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. After that, the MF@AHM nanospheres were carbonized in a quartz tube furnace with Ar/H2 flow. The carbothermal reduction process was conducted by elevating the temperature from room temperature to the setting points (550, 650, 750 °C) at a rate of 5 °C min−1, followed by maintaining the final temperature for 90 min. The carbonized samples were molybdenum carbide nanosphere, denoted as Mo2C-550, PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N (stand for Mo2C-650) and Mo2C-750 respectively. Similarly, the contrast molybdenum carbide catalyst, denoted as nMo2CN was prepared without adding PVA at carbonization temperature of 650 °C."
4,Physical characterization,"2.3 Physical characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/MAX 2400 X-Ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a voltage of 30 kV and a current of 10 mA. The 2θ angular regions between 5° and 90° were investigated at a scan rate of 10° min−1 with a step of 0.02°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB250 Surface Science instrument with an exciting source of Al Kα = 1486.6 eV. The binding energies obtained in the XPS spectral analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing C 1s to 284.6 eV. The morphology and structure of the product were characterized using Transmission electron nanoscopy (TEM; Philips CM200), and field-emission scanning electron nanoscopy (FEI Nova Nano SEM 450). Raman spectrum was taken under ambient conditions by using a nano-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw Raman Scope RM3000)."
5,Electrochemical characterization,"2.4 Electrochemical characterization The electrocatalytic activity for HER was evaluated with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302 N/FRA system, made in the Netherlands), which was connected to a three-electrode configuration using a rotating disk electrode (PINE Research Instrumentation, AFMSRCE 3363 Rotator, made in USA). Electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution bubbled with pure H2 (99.99%) at ambient temperature. The working electrode was prepared by depositing catalysts ink onto a glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode (5.61 mm in diameter). The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 24.9 mg of catalyst in 2.5 ml of a solution containing 0.5 ml of ethanol, 2 ml of H2O and 25 μl of 5 wt% Naﬁon solution followed by ultrasonication for 40 min. The catalyst ink was pipetted onto the GC surface with a nanopipette. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. Potentials were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.242 + 0.059 PH. In addition, all of the potentials were calibrated with internal resistance (IR) correction unless it was mentioned individually. Arising from catalysts, electrolyte and contact resistance of the setup, the resistance (R) is referred to the series resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Linear sweep voltammetry was recorded at a scan rate of 3 mV s−1 and a rotational speed of 2000 rpm in 0.5 M H2SO4. To evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA or EASA), cyclic voltammograms were obtained from 0.1 to 0.2 V (versus RHE, in 0.5 M H2SO4) with a series sweep rates of 20, 40, 60 … 200 mV s−1. The Tafel equation setting as η = a log (j) +b, where b is Tafel slope and j represents the current density, is applied to fit the Tafel plots for the convenience of elucidating the HER mechanism [7]. EIS was performed at various overpotentials with frequency from 0.1 to 100,000 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV. The impedance data were fit to a simplified Randles circuit to extract the series and charge transfer resistances. The long-term stability of the catalyst was performed by continuous linear sweep voltammetry with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and a rotational speed of 2000 rpm."
6,Results and discussion,"The synthesis scheme of the polyvinyl alcohol protected PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres as a hydrogen production electrocatalyst is presented in Fig. 1 . The Mo-MF hybrid with the three-dimensional spherical structure is fabricated using ammonium heptamolybdate as the Mo source, and the preformed melamine-formaldehyde resin nanospheres as the carbon source and a reactive self-degraded template. Thereinto, there are two pivotal factors need to emphasis, first, the strong electrostatic binding between ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) and melamine [36], which can successfully immobilize the MoO4 2− with the coordination ligand-melamine in the MF resin; secondly, the original template polyvinyl alcohol (note as PVA), which is the essential factor that can effectively influence and protect the final structure of the molybdenum carbide. As illustrated in Fig. 1, by adopting the PVA as a dispersant through the condensation process of the MF resin, the uniform solid MF resin nanospheres full of the melamine groups are firstly obtained. After the MF nanospheres dispersed into the abundant AHM solution, the molybdate groups rapidly bond on the rough surface carbon-nitride nanospheres, which consists of many melamine groups exposed on the surface or in the pores and crevices and makes for the location of the MoO4 2−. Finally, during the carbonization process, Mo2C nanospheres is generated by the reaction between the Mo-based molybdate and the MF resin that served as the carbonaceous source. As a contrast, the nMo2CN catalyst is prepared without the addition of the PVA, which provides effectively protective action of the hollow spherical structure for the as-prepared molybdenum carbide nanospheres. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared molybdenum carbides are firstly investigated by the ﬁeld-emission scanning electron nanoscopy (FESEM) and the transmission electron nanoscopy (TEM). As shown in a typical SEM images (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1), the Mo2C nanospheres samples pyrolyzed at different temperatures present the same morphology of uniform nanospheres except that the surface of the samples becomes smooth with the increasing of the carbonization temperatures, suggesting that the Mo2C nanospheres' surface is covered by carbon species gradually and the surface roughness has changed. The corresponding TEM images (Fig. S2) also confirm the formation of the surface carbon species. It can be observed that the thickness of the extra amorphous carbon layer covered on the Mo2C-750 sample's surface is 16 nm. As depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres have rough surface along with a hollow interior (Fig. 2b), which differs from the nMo2CN samples (Fig. 2e). A closed TEM characterization on the edge of the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres is implemented to acquire more details about the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanostructure. In addition, the presence of the amorphous carbon in the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N sample is further confirmed in the following Raman spectrum (Fig. 3 b). As its shown in HRTEM image (Fig. 2c), many visible lattice fringes are presented on the well-crystallized molybdenum carbide nanocrystallite. The crystallite planes of the sample (Fig. 2c) are distinguished so as to substantiate the phases of molybdenum carbides. The distance between the apparent lattice fringes on the nanoparticles is 0.230 nm corresponding to (101) crystallographic planes of hexagonal Mo2C (PDF # 35–0787), which is in accordance with the XRD results of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N. Furthermore, HRTEM image (Fig. 2c) shows the lattice plane distance of 0.205 nm which corresponds to the lattice plane (200) of Mo2N (PDF # 25–1366), which also gives the proof of the existence of N element. The presence of the N element is also verified by the XPS spectrum. As a comparison to PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N, the nMo2CN is also characterized by SEM (Fig. 2d) and TEM (Fig. 2e–f) for its morphology and detailed nanostructure information. The structure of nMo2CN is not ordered and uniform (Fig. 2d and e). And the lattice distances of nMo2CN (Fig. 2f) are 0.230 nm and 0.260 nm, which are separately unanimous with the lattice distances of (101) and (100) planes of the Mo2C (PDF# 35–0787). It is noteworthy that the catalyst activity of the transition-metal-based materials is closely associated with the chemical environment of the parent metal and the surface roughness. The crystallographic structure of the as-synthesized catalysts shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3a is investigated by the X-ray diffraction. It reveals that molybdenum carbides are obtained at a relatively low temperature (Fig. S3a). The samples pyrolyzed at 550 °C exist in the form of MoCx, which differs from the β-Mo2C phase formed at 650 °C and 750 °C. The Mo2C-550 is composed of Mo2C (PDF # 35–0787), MoC (PDF # 06546) and MoO2 (PDF # 50–0739), which are detected by the TEM (Fig. S2b). For the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and Mo2C-750 samples, the diffraction peaks at 34.3°, 37.9°, 39.4°, 52.1° and 61.5° correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) planes of pure hexagonal β-Mo2C (PDF # 35–0787) [37]. Interestingly, the additional diffraction peaks both including the broad peak of amorphous carbon at around 26° [38] and the Mo2N (25–1366) peaks stamped with the asterisks are observed in PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N. There is much difference of the diffractions of nMo2CN and PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N including the composition and the intensity of the peaks in Fig. 3a. The phase in nMo2CN prepared without PVA is β-Mo2C (PDF # 35–0787) shown with red line in Fig. 3a, which differs from the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N made with PVA for the deficiency of the peak of Mo2N. And the nMo2CN possesses much stronger and sharper peaks compared with the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N. In general, the weaker and broader the diffraction peaks are, the smaller the crystallite size of the corresponding sample will be. In contrast, the stronger and sharper diffraction peaks indicate the larger crystallite size [39]. The crystallite size of catalysts is calculated according to the Scherrer equation (Table S1). The sizes of the Mo2C-550, PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N, Mo2C-750 and nMo2CN crystallites are estimated as about 2 nm, 6.1 nm, 36.3 nm and 17.9 nm, respectively, which are in accordance with the fact that higher the temperature is, the bigger the particles will be. Similarly the Mo2C-550 has the smallest particles, which can be observed in Fig. S3a. The crystallite sizes arise with the increasing of the carbonization temperature due to the agglomeration of particles at high temperature. Considering these characterizations above, the mechanism of how the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and nMo2CN generate can be explained clearly. First, the growth process of the Mo-MF hybrid precursor is spreading through the “out-in” route, where the molydate combines with melamine in the MF resin sphere through the outside to inside. Afterwards, with the increasing of the carbonization temperature, the phase of samples transforms from mixed-phase MoCx to PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and then to Mo2C, which is accompanied by the morphology changes from solid to hollow and then to solid. PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is synthesized with the suitable temperature of 650 °C, while the lower temperature 550 °C is insufficient for the carbonization, the higher temperature 750 °C is adequate for the generation of β-Mo2C with less doping of nitrogen. In addition, the spherical structure conduces to retaining more nitrogen in the sample after carbonization, making for the generation of unstructured nMo2CN with less nitrogen. In summary, the growth of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and nMo2CN draws on the principle of the interaction between molydate and melamine, then diverges from each other by the existence of PVA, which makes a difference in their own morphology and then the composition of their phase. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization is implemented on PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N so that the surface electronic state and composition of the as-prepared catalysts can be analyzed intuitively. The electronic state of Mo and N element in PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is depicted in Fig. 3. The peaks in range of 224–240 eV correspond to 3d5/2 orbit and 3d3/2 orbit split of the Mo 3d core (Fig. 3f), while the peaks in 389–404 eV can be assigned to 2s orbit of N atom (Fig. 3e). The peak fitting of Mo 3d XPS peak for PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N suggests that there are three oxidation states of Mo existing on the sample's surface, namely Mo2+, Mo3+ and Mo6+. Since the surface oxidation will occur when the samples are exposed to air [40], it is reasonable to speculate that the Mo6+ at 232.2 eV stems from the MoO3 phase on the catalyst surface. A watchful eye needs to be kept on the Mo2+ and Mo3+ peaks at 227.3–229 eV (3d5/2) and 230.3–232 eV (3d3/2) on account of that they are main species in molybdenum carbide or nitride and are correlative with the active centers of HER [41,42]. The presence of N 1s manifests the N element originated from melamine is successfully doped in the Mo2C nanospheres. The N 1s spectrum peaks are fitted to four peaks (Fig. 3e), namely N Mo, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N peak. All of these N species have an affirmative effect towards the HER [40]. The presence of N Mo bond implies the existence of molybdenum nitride in the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N. The carbon species in the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N are identified by C 1s spectrum and Raman spectrum. There are three peaks existing in C 1s spectrum located at 283, 284.5 and 288 eV (Fig. 3c), which are attributed to CN bond, CC bond and CMo bond, respectively. Besides, the existence of amorphous carbon in PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is shown in the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2b). In contrast, there is no residual carbon in the nMo2CN except for the carbon bonded with Mo atom (Fig. S3b). The representative polarization curves (current density is based on the geometric area of the electrode) and Tafel plot of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N sample are shown in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. For comparison, nMo2CN, MF-650 and commercial Pt/C (40% Pt on carbon black) are also tested (Fig. 4a and b). The HER catalytic activity of the four catalysts follows the sequence of Pt/C > PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N > nMo2CN > MF-650. In particular, the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N requires low overpotentials of 132 mV (η 10 ) and 176 mV (η 100 ) to achieve the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 (current density for solar water-splitting device with 12.3% efficiency) respectively [7], which is superior to nMo2CN (η 10 = 280 mV) (Table 1 ). A high current density of 240 mA cm−2 can be achieved at a low overpotential of 192 mV on nMo2CN, demonstrating its remarkable performance among various molybdenum carbides, such as nanoMoC@GS produced by the ‘MOFs-assisted strategy’ [39], hierarchical β-Mo2C nanotubes originating from the xMoO3@Mo-polydopamine [43] and the PDAP-MoCNCO2 material deriving from the polydiaminopyridine (PDAP)-2H+/MoO4 + [44]. This high apparent activity can be attributed to the combination of the high intrinsic activity originated from the adjacent surface active sites of Mo2C and Mo2N (confirmed by XPS) as well as the large ECSA of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanospheres with surface roughness. The ECSA of the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and nMo2CN is compared by calculating the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is reported to be positively proportional to the ECSA [42]. As marked in Fig. 4c, the Cdl of the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N (13.1 mF cm−2) is about two magnitudes higher than that of the nMo2CN (0.18 mF cm−2), suggesting the ECSA of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is much larger than that of nMo2CN. The large ECSA can be possibly traced back to PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N's the smaller crystallite size and unique nanosphere structure. The Tafel slope of the commercial Pt/C is 30.3 mV dec−1 [34]. The PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N exhibits a small Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4b), much smaller than that of the nMo2CN (140.6 mV dec−1), suggesting the existing of the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism on PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N electrode for HER. The recombination step depicted below is the rate-determining step [45]: Step I ( adsorption ) : H 3 O + + e − → H ads + OH − Volmer Step Step II ( desorption ) : Chemical desorption: H ads + H ads → H 2 Tafel Step Electrochemical desorption: H 3 O + + H ads + e − → H 2 ( Recombination step ) Heyrovsky Step The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed to gain further insights into the electrocatalytic kinetics of HER catalyzed by PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and nMo2CN. A one-time-constant electrical equivalent circuit model has been used to describe the response of water reduction on the electrode surface. There are three geometric values of electronic elements Rs, Rct and CPE in the model (Fig. 4e), where Rs is the solution resistance, Rct stands for the charge transfer resistance, and CPE, the constant phase angle element, represents the double layer capacitance of solid electrode in the real-world situation [46,47,44]. It is worth noting that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) corresponding to the electrocatalytic kinetics at the interface between the catalyst and the electrolyte can be measured from the EIS Nyquist plots [34]. Hence, the Rct obtained from the semicircle in the low-frequency zone is compared. The Rct of nMo2CN is calculated as ∼196 Ω, much bigger than that of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N (11 Ω). The small charge transfer resistance would be related to the special nanosphere structure of the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N and the synergistic effect of these carbide and nitride [48]. Moreover, linear potential sweeps are repeatedly conducted on the electrodes for probing the durability of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N. The polarization curve (Fig. 4f) shows less than 20 mV negative shift on average after 1000 cycles in an acidic environment, indicating self-supported PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N nanosphere has acceptable stability for the gas-generating HER. To expand the application range of the catalyst, its HER performance is also evaluated in basic solution [49]. The PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N catalyst shows good activity towards HER in 1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs in the three-electrode test system and the hydrogen bubble can be observed directly during the measurement. It is observed that the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 and 60 mA cm−2 with the overpotential of 142 mV and 178 mV respectively as exhibited in Fig. 5b. The Tafel slope of PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is 50.4 mV dec−1in PH = 14 shown in Fig. 5c, suggesting the rate-determining step of Hads desorption and a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. Nonetheless, PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N still comparable with previous works (Table S4) while the performance can be further modulated by optimizing the synthesis conditions or introducing second metal [50]. With high activity, favorable HER kinetics and acceptable durability, PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N is a promising electrocatalyst for HER in the acid and alkaline solution electrolyte."
7,Conclusion,"A facile and reproducible way is demonstrated in this work for synthesizing the rough-surfaced PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N hollow nanospheres with the protection of the polyvinyl alcohol. The Mo-melamine hybrid based approach takes advantage of both the soft-template method and the single-source route, guaranteeing the combination of merit of the two methods, such as the uniform nanostructure, low synthesis temperature and homogeneous carbonization. In addition, the MoCx is generated at a low temperature of 550 °C, and the β-Mo2C which appears at 650 °C exhibits optimal HER performance as a result of its unique nanostructure and small nanocrystallites. Compared with the most of the typical noble metal-free electrocatalysts (Table S3), PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N reveals extraordinary performance in acidic and alkaline solution. Considering the sub-nanometer size of the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N catalyst, such electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the following factors. First, the Mo2C and Mo2N mixed phases have high intrinsic activity towards HER due to the synergistic effect of the two compounds adjacent each other at atomic scale. Second, the nanosphere with rough surface is deemed to expose more active sites, facilitate the diffusion and lower the transport resistance. Third, self-supported PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N ∼500 nm properly balanced the tradeoff between ECSA and stability, leading to relatively comprehensive HER performance. As a consequence, the PVA-Mo2C/Mo2N containing uniform-structured β-Mo2C and γ-Mo2N nanocrystallites exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance in both acidic and alkaline condition. The present strategy for the construction of noble metal-free catalysts will open up a new avenue to develop high-performance and low-cost catalytic materials. Further directions of improving the performance of molybdenum carbide involves but not limits to ameliorating the synthetic to prepare samples with larger surface area or introducing other heteroatoms such as Fe, Co and Ni to prepare multimetallic carbides."
