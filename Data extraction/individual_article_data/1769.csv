0,Introduction,"Amines are general intermediates and precursors in the preparation of versatile natural products [1,2], dyes, pharmaceuticals [3–5], agrochemicals [6], pigments [7], polymers [8], and catalysts [9]. Some pharmaceuticals or their precursors, and the bulk polymer Nylon-6,6 which contain amino groups were shown in Fig. 1 . For example, benzimidazoles and its derivatives are significant intermediates which were extensively used in synthesizing important pharmaceutical compounds. Among all the amines, primary amines are the most valuable intermediates because of their straightforward functionalization such as the further derivatization reaction to obtain secondary or tertiary amines [10,11]. Therefore, the syntheses of primary amines have widely attracted interest from scientific researchers [8]. There are several approaches to produce primary amines, such as the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds [12–15], the reduction of nitro compounds or amides [16,17], as well as the C-H functionalization [18] of various amino derivatives. The selective catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles into primary amines through designing a suitable catalytic system represents an atom-economical and reliable method [10,18]. However, the selective production of primary amines from nitriles is a formidable task due to the high activity of intermediate imines which cause selectivity problems [1]. Fig. 2 showed the generally accepted mechanism of the formation of imines and amines. Addition of H2 to nitrile 1 gives the primary aldimine 2, which further is reduced to desired product primary amine 3. Owing to its high reactivity, a set of parallel and consecutive reactions occur and result in many byproducts such as secondary imine 4, secondary amine 5, and tertiary amine 6. Primary amine is the complete hydrogenation product of nitriles, while secondary and tertiary amine are partially hydrogenated products [10]. On account of the subtle differences in boiling points of different reaction products, the considerable separation of primary amines is usually difficult in industry. Thus, control of the selectivity is one of the most critical issues [21], which may be related to the nature and amount of the catalysts, solvent, acid-base properties of the support, substrate structure, and additive. For instance, metals like Ni, Co, and Ru mainly hydrogenate nitriles to primary amines, while Cu, Pt, and Rh reduce nitriles to secondary amines in most cases [22]. The basic site of support is conducive to the generation of primary amines. The existence of nitro substituents often makes nitriles difficult to reduce. Meanwhile, the presence of base (such as ammonia or alkali base) always inhibits the formation of secondary/tertiary imines [10]. The group of Johnson found that LiOH was more effective than KOH and NaOH in the presence of a sponge or Raney cobalt catalysts [23]. The nature of the catalytic systems is one of the most important factors in controlling the selectivity, thus a reasonable choice of it is of great significance [10]. Suitable catalysts should be highly selective for the nitrile group, operate under green and mild reaction conditions, and without adding additives. In the last two decades, many reviews partially [10,24–28] committed to the title reaction and critical, comprehensive evaluation of catalytic methods have been disclosed. But the articles exclusively [1,18,21] dedicated to the title reaction are less reported. Besides, some only highlighted the aspects of the recent developments in the homogeneous [10,24,26] catalytic methods, while others in the heterogeneous [21,25]. Nevertheless, most of them lacked the consideration of the variables of reaction conditions for the design of future methodologies and the relationship between catalytic systems and substrate structure. Herein, taking into account of all these considerations, this review gives an overview of the recent developments and current arts achieved in the selective heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines over the past decade, and the actual effect of catalytic systems on different nitrile substrates were also evaluated. An outlook on current and future trends for selective nitrile hydrogenation is also proposed."
1,Catalytic systems for the reduction of nitriles to primary amines,"In the last decade, the technology for observing primary amines from nitriles has a rapid development. A decade ago, Ni and Co based catalysts were usually used to produce primary amines from nitriles, in which Raney catalysts showed good selectivity, but in high pressure and/or additives [23]. Noble metals were also employed under milder reaction conditions, but additives (such as acid and base) were generally required to improve the selectivity of primary amines [29]. Fortunately, due to the modification of the traditional catalytic systems and the development of advanced catalytic systems in recent years which was shown in Section 2.1-2.7 in detail, the reaction conditions become much milder, the additives can be omitted in specific environment, the substrate scopes have been greatly expanded and the stability of the catalysts has been increased dramatically. Thus, the works of the literature disclosed in the last decade for the catalytic systems about the reduction of nitriles to primary amines, including both the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts systems. In this section, seven catalytic systems and their recent development are briefly outlined. The results are then collated in the next section in the presence of other functional groups. Besides, reaction parameters of each catalytic system on benzonitrile are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1 by a critical standard proposed by the Garduño group [10]."
2,Supported Mono-Metal catalysts,"2.1 Supported Mono-Metal catalysts When using supported mono-metal catalysts (MS), we can conclude from the published reports that the reaction performance greatly depends on the type, amount and mobility of transition states and surface intermediates which are controlled by the catalysts. Moreover, solvent type, reaction conditions (such as reaction pressure, hydrogen sources and substrate structure) [30,31] and additives also play important roles [32]. The metal itself has an inherent selectivity for nitrile hydrogenation. Generally, catalysts based on Co, Ni and Ru mainly produced the primary amines. Cu and Rh catalysts preferred the formation of secondary amines, while sometimes tertiary amines can be prepared with a high selectivity on Pd and Pt catalysts [33,34]. In 2012, the Segobia group explored the active metal effect on selectivity of butyronitrile liquid-phase hydrogenation, which Ni, Co, Ru, Cu, Pd, and Pt were all included [32]. The results showed that the highest yields of n-butylamine was obtained on Co/SiO2, similarly to the highest yields reported on Raney Co catalysts. Later in 2014, this group further tested the performance of Pt/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and Ru/SiO2 in different solvents, including n-butanol, toluene, and cyclohexane [35]. The effect of active metal on selectivity was consistent with their previous study [32], and the solvent effect was related to solvent-metal interaction strength. In 2015, compared with the Ni/SiO2 and Co/SiO2 which favored the formation of saturated amines, this group described that Cu/SiO2 could selectively form unsaturated cinnamylamine from cinnamonitrile in the liquid phase [36]. In 2017, the group of Saad published the influence of various oxide supports (Al2O3, MgO, SiO2, and CeO2) on product distribution with the use of Pt active metal through gas-phase hydrogenation of acetonitrile [37]. The author claimed that the number of basic sites on the support had a positive effect on the yield of ethylamine, and the existence of Lewis acidic sites was unfavorable. Besides, Muratsugu and coworkers developed a decarbonylation-promoted Ru nanoparticle on a basic K-doped Al2O3, Ru3-CO/K-Alu C, for the hydrogenation of several nitriles without any additives or bases, since the basicity of Al2O3 could be tuned by the doping amount of K [38]. For the hydrogenation of benzonitrile into benzylamine, the Bakker group particularly investigated the influence of H2 pressure on the reactivity and selectivity of Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [29]. Vilches-Herrera and co-workers used Pd/C catalyst to screen different combinations of acids and bases as hydrogen donors, and HCOOH-NEt3 was found to be the best one [39]. This was the report that for the first time applicated HCOOH-NEt3 for nitriles transfer hydrogenation into primary amines. In order to omit the base effect in the catalytic systems, Marella’s group successfully used basic oxide MgO as support and transition metal Cu as active species for the hydrogenation of benzonitrile, whereas very high temperature (240 °C) was required [40]. Next in 2016, Cao’s group disclosed a layered double hydroxide (LDH)-coated nickel-based core–shell NPs, Ni@mSiO2@LDH, for the hydrogenation of benzonitrile [41]. Tuning the structure and acid-base character through calcination or hydration could control its selectivity. Without using a base and high temperature, the Ni@mSiO2@LDH catalyst could give moderate selectivity. In conclusion, a catalytic system of supported mono-metal usually exploits noble metal and is strictly restricted to the scope of substrates, which limits its application. Hence, it is very necessary to modify or tailor the mono-metal catalytic system, such as the introduction of dense phase CO2 [42], ligand [43], (N-doped) carbonaceous materials [44,45], phosphating [46,47] process, etc."
3,Catalytic systems using dense phase CO2,"2.2 Catalytic systems using dense phase CO2 Catalytic systems containing supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) have attracted widespread attention recently, which is a green and most promising reaction medium for selective hydrogenation [48,49]. The properties of CO2 will change when the temperature is higher than the critical temperature (31.3 °C) and the pressure is higher than the critical pressure (7.3 MPa) [50]. Its density is close to liquid, and viscosity is close to gas, as well as diffusion coefficient is 100 times than that of liquid. Thus, scCO2 has amazing dissolving power of gases [51]. Besides, CO2 molecules may react with reactants or catalysts, which could be another way to increase the selectivity of the product instead of using bases [52]. However, the relatively high pressures and low solvent power have hindered their application, which can be solved by the usage of appropriate co-solvents [53]. Furthermore, the same promotion effect of CO2 can occur at a lower pressure in co-solvent such as water. Thus, we used the term dense phase CO2 here, which represents scCO2 and CO2 at a low pressure whose promotion effect likes scCO2. In 2009 and 2010, the Chatterjee group employed Pd/MCM-41 with scCO2 to hydrogenate benzonitrile into the corresponding primary amine and investigated the Rh/Al2O3 with scCO2 for hydrogenating dinitrile to aminonitrile in succession, both of which were free from any additives and the usage of any organic solvents [48,54]. The group observed a strong effect of CO2 pressure on the conversion and selectivity. The author also claimed that when P (CO2) < 12, the formation of carbamic acid from amine was preferred, preventing the further synthesis of dibenzylamine. Subsequently, in 2013, the Yoshida group further added H2O as co-solvent to the catalytic system of Pd/Al2O3 with scCO2 for the formation of benzylamine from benzonitrile and studied its features in detail [52]. They found a synergy of water and CO2. As pointed out above, the target product amine can react with CO2 to form carbamate salt. However, carbamate salt may accumulate on the surface of catalysts, which causes the deactivation of the catalysts. On the other hand, reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) can produce CO whose adsorption on the surface of the metal can also be a reason for deactivation of the catalysts. But the author claimed that this deactivation could be avoided by adding water to some extent because the salt is soluble in water thus avoiding its deposition on the catalyst surface. Besides, the high selectivity can also be attributed to the transfer of carbamate salt from the organic phase into the H2O phase, preventing the continuing reaction of benzylamine. The author pointed out that the reactivity of the C-N bond was decreased by the presence of CO2 through the FTIR analysis. Cheng and co-workers investigated compressed CO2, ethanol-CO2, hexane-CO2, and H2O-CO2 systems using Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for the synthesis of benzylamine, and tried to reveal the functional role of CO2 and the phase behavior [55]. They claimed that the introduction of CO2 simultaneously had positive and negative effects on the reaction rate and selectivity. Sometimes the positive effect was significant than the negative effects, but in some cases, they may be counteracted each other. In addition, the negative effects may even outweigh the positive effects. The author also observed different results of these effects on reaction rate, selectivity and conversion in various phase. However, the above discussion of catalytic systems with water and CO2 focused on the benzonitrile. In 2015, Bhosale and co-workers further studied the selective hydrogenation of benzyl cyanide with Pd/Al2O3 in hexane-H2O-CO2 medium where CO2 pressure was below 3 MPa [51]. Later Bhosale explored the substrate-dependent effects from four nitriles of 2-phenylethyl cyanide, cinnamonitrile, n-hexanenitrile, and 4-cyanobiphenyl [56]. All the yields of corresponding primary amines were unsatisfactory, and it was observed that a multi-phase reaction medium had different impacts from one nitrile to another. Unfortunately, the researches mentioned above have some contradictions. Cheng [55] speculated that the acidic nature of H2O-CO2 accelerated the occurrence of side reactions due to the elimination of NH3, which was contrary to the results of Yoshida [52] and Bhosale [51,56] that the target product was more stabilized in an acidic environment. Besides, Chatterjee [48] claimed that there was a strong impact of CO2 pressure on the reactivity and selectivity, while Yoshida [52] described that P (CO2) had small effects on conversion and selectivity. This review speculated that these may be explained by the competition of negative and positive influence of CO2 as well as the different properties of the active metal and/or support. The role of dense phase CO2 at low and high pressures and solvent is summarized herein. There is a competitive relationship between the positive and negative effects of CO2. Dense phase CO2 may increase the solubility of H2 in the liquid phase and act as a temporary protecting agent. On the other hand, the addition of CO2 may cause the deactivation of the catalysts when water is absent. The existence of CO2 may decrease the reactivity of the CN bond, and the physical effect of liquid expansion may cause the dilution of reacting species, both of which can be ignored in low CO2 pressure. The addition of H2O could form the water-organic interface, accelerating the rate of reaction, avoiding deactivation of the catalysts, and modifying the selectivity. But the influence of the acidity of CO2 and H2O needs to be explored in depth. Overall, the catalytic systems using dense phase CO2 and/or solvents are effective for overcoming the mass transfer limitation, increasing the product selectivity, simplifying the reaction process, reducing the reaction temperature, and making it easy to separate and recycle the catalysts, while need to react in high pressure. More importantly, the substrate scope is highly restricted. Most of them are suitable for only one substrate. Therefore, more strategies should be under developed to solve these problems."
4,Metal complexes,"2.3 Metal complexes With respect to selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines by metal complexes (MC), Ru-compounds pioneered the field, followed by Fe-, Co–, and Mn-compounds, reporting their first examples in 2014 [57], 2015 [58], and 2016 [59], respectively. Many reviews focused on the metal complexes’ mechanistic information and development [1,10,60], thus herein just a brief outline of important progress of metal complexes for title reaction was introduced. Fig. 3 depicts the catalytic precursor structural formulae. Most of the reported systems require a basic additive to hamper the formation of secondary products, which can be a drawback in terms of functional group tolerance [61]. In 2010, Reguillo et al. first reported the catalytic system of Ru complex (MC-Ru1) incorporating two tricyclopentylphosphines without adding base or additive for hydrogenation of benzonitrile into benzylamine, but without any other nitrile substrate [62]. The group of Adam disclosed a new Ru pincer complex (MC-Ru2) with the NNP-type pincer imidazolylphosphine ligand and its applications to various nitriles [63]. Mukherjee and coworkers explored a dearomatized PNP t Bu Ru complex (MC-Ru3), irrespective of the polarity of solvents used [64]. However, all of them didn’t mention the reuse of catalysts. In 2018, Ajjou’s group used water-soluble catalyst [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (MC-Rh) for the homogeneous syntheses of corresponding primary amines derived from nitriles in aqueous ammonia. Surprisingly, the green solvent water was used and the catalyst could be recycled [65]. Rezaei’s group published an easy recovery catalyst of poly(citric acid)(PC)-functionalized magnetic carbon nanotubes-supported Pt(II) catalyst (MC-Pt), MWCNT/MA@PC/Pt(II), for the hydrogenation of nitrile groups [66]. MWCNT/MA@PC was synthesized by the modification of surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with magnetic moieties, which made the catalysts easy to separate from the reaction mixture. PC was used to increase the water’s solubility and catalyst’s loading capacity. The Pt complex was conjugated with MWCNT/MA@PC to form MWCNT/MA@PC/Pt(II). Though the noble metal complexes for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles into primary amines exhibit improved performance and operate under relatively gentle conditions, the high costs and environmental concerns hinder their developments and applications. Thus, it is significant to use cheaper, less toxic, and more abundant transition metals taking the place of noble metals [67]. The early study of Fe complexes catalysts in nitriles hydrogenation to primary amines was made by Bornschein’s group with the use of a well-defined iron PNP-pincer complex (MC-Fe1) [57]. Later in 2016, the Lange group assessed the effect of alkyl substituents at the phosphorus binding site on the catalytic performance of the complexes, and found that the sequence of reactivity was: Cy (MC-Fe2) = i Pr > Et [68]. In 2015, a novel Fe(PNP) with no ancillary CO ligand (MC-Fe3) was published by the Chakraborty group, but further research on active species and reaction mechanism is needed [69]. In 2015, Mukherjee and co-workers developed the first homogeneous cobalt-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines by using Co PNNH pincer complex (MC-Co1) under relatively hard conditions [58]. Following this work, recently a novel Co catalyst with an aliphatic PNP pincer ligand (MC-Co2) was developed through evaluating the reactivity of various substituents on the phosphorous atom, including i Pr, Cy, and Ph by the group of Schneekönig [61]. The Tokmic group described a cobalt bis(carbene) pincer system (MC-Co3) to drastically reduce the reaction H2 pressure and time [70]. But in this process, NaHBEt3 was required to act as a situ activator protecting the Co(I) active catalyst which was sensitive to moisture and air by reducing the catalyst precursor Co(III). Moreover, Lewis acid was also needed to participate in a pairwise transfer of H2 procedure via a Co(I/III) redox process. The above cobalt-based complexes used H2 as a hydrogen donor. The first contribution on catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitriles into corresponding amines via Co centered complexes appeared in 2016, pioneered by the Shao group with Co NNP pincer complex (MC-Co4) and ammonia borane (NH3BH3) [71]. They also observed a selectivity control effect of solvents. Adam and co-workers reported the first non-pincer catalyst (MC-Co5) based on Co(acac)3 in situ combinations of the tetradentate phosphine ligand [72]. Besides, Dai’s group described a “twin” catalytic system (MC-Co6), which could control the selectivity of nitrile hydrogenation via omitting or including the ligand i PrPNHP, and the amines or secondary aldimines were produced respectively [73]. When treating CoBr2 with NaHBEt3 immediately without adding the ligand, cobalt particles and NaBr were formed, which responded to the improvement of the selectivity for amines. Whereas, the recycled catalysts displayed a decreased selectivity perhaps due to the loss of NaBr. Surprisingly, in 2017 Ji and co-workers synthesized a new Zr-based MOF which provided a unique ligand environment for Co(II) (MC-Co7), providing a highly efficient single-site solid catalyst for the transformation of amines from nitriles [74]. This research indicated the great potential of the ligand platform derived from MOF nodes. Manganese ranks third in the abundant transition metal in the earth's biocompatible and crust elements. The first example of using Mn-catalyzed syntheses of primary amines from nitriles with Mn PNP-pincer complex (MC-Mn1) was published by Elangovan group [59]. Later in 2018, Weber and co-workers explored a new non-pincer bisphosphine Mn(I) complex (MC-Mn2) for the selective production of amines in high H2 pressure, and it was also the first example where three CO ligands cooperated with the metal center in a facial arrangement [75]. Following these efforts, recently Garduño successfully decreased the hydrogen pressure to 7 bar by employing a novel non-pincer Mn(I) complex (MC-Mn3) [67]. Though the metal complexes discussed above exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity on various nitriles, it is hard to separate catalysts from the reaction mixtures making the recovery and reusability challenge in most cases. The loss of expensive metal, ligands as well as the contamination of the target products by remaining metal are also major issues."
5,(N-Doped) carbonaceous catalytic materials,"2.4 (N-Doped) carbonaceous catalytic materials It has been reported that catalytic materials of transition single metal atoms or nanoparticles supported on (nitrogen-doped) modified carbonaceous materials (CCM) are greatly successful for diverse selective organic reactions [76,77]. They are different from traditional heterogeneous catalysts which are prepared by classic methods such as impregnation and precipitation. CCM catalysts are typically prepared by the pyrolysis of well-defined non-volatile organometallic complexes or metal–organic frameworks (MOF) as precursors [78]. The detailed preparation information can be seen in Fig. 4 . In 2013, Felix and co-workers developed a novel catalyst in which nano-cobalt oxide supported on a carbon–nitrogen surface by pyrolysis of well-defined organometallic complexes [79]. They found that catalyst activity could be indirectly controlled by the type of ligand. This catalyst Co/Phen@-Al2O3-800 was further used by Chen and co-workers to produce primary amines from nitriles [80]. Characterization of the catalysts showed the coexistence species of Co NP (nanoparticles) covered by several graphitic layers, CoxOy without graphene, highly dispersed cobalt species and oxygen in the carbon phase. The author proposed that Co bonded N played a crucial part in the reaction of nitriles to primary amines by XPS. Another method of preparation the active CCM catalysts might be the employment of structure-controlling templates which could bind to the metal ions strongly such as MOF [81]. Murugesan prepared a Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 catalyst by pyrolyzing MOF of Co/H2BDC(1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) and carbon powder for preparing primary amines from nitriles, which was not required nitrogen-doping for activity [82]. The existence of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) particles and metallic cobalt NPs encapsulated within graphene shells was also observed. Next in 2017, the bifunctional catalyst of Co@CN-900 was developed by the Long group with the pyrolysis of N-containing Co-MOF from the self-assembly of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, N-containing ligand of TED(triethylenediamine), and H2BDC [83]. During pyrolysis process, Co-MOF was used as self-sacrificing compounds, and no external heterogeneous supports were used. TED and H2BDC were transformed into graphitic N-doped carbon where Co NPs derived from Co ions dispersed on, and the former provided basic sites. They also provided a new idea of selectivity control via only adjusting the dosage of the solvent because the concentration of N-derived basic sites was reduced as the volume of solvent increased. However, there were no explanations about why the dosage of solvent could control the concentration of basic sites. Nevertheless, the N-containing ligands are expensive, which limits their applicability. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the syntheses of carbonaceous materials starting from sustainable resources that contain enough N elements. Ferraccioli made a breakthrough by describing B12@CeO2-8 catalyst with the utilization of the abundant, cheap, and bio-available metalliferous enzyme B12 supported on ceria, which represented a cheaper, more convenient, and time-saving preparation process [84]. The author observed the existence of carbonaceous cobalt phase and cobalt oxide nanoparticles. Recently, this group further used biocompatible nitrogen-containing precursor chitin as an N donor for synthesizing Co-N-C@MgO-700 to hydrogenate nitriles [85]. Besides, Liu and co-workers employed adenine which is also called B4 as an N donor to develop a Co@NC-700 catalyst by the pyrolysis of bio-MOF Co/adenine [86]. In short, CCM catalysts containing Co have been widely used as catalysts for selective production of primary amines from various nitriles. The Co species were covered by graphitic layers in most catalysts except B12@CeO2-8 catalyst, which could efficiently avoid the aggregation of nanoparticles and accelerate their electron transfer, therefore improving the catalytic activity and recyclability [82]. However, the preparation process is complex and multi-step, which means the rigorous abidance of high pyrolysis temperatures and respective production steps. Meanwhile, the high-boiling and toxic solvent DMF (dimethylformamide) was frequently used (Fig. 4) [87]. Accordingly, simpler, more energy-efficient, and greener strategies of mono-metal catalysts are encouraging and highly sought-after topics."
6,Phosphides,"2.5 Phosphides Co– and Ni-based sponge metals (Raney catalysts) in zero-valent state were used in industrial nitrile hydrogenation processes successfully, and the related information has been reported [23,88]. However, Raney catalysts have air instability and require harsh reaction conditions such as high pressure. A means to improve air stability is the surface modification of metal NPs/MOF by pyrolysis, as mentioned in Section 2.4. Another method is the phosphidation of Co or Ni, which show unique charged natures (positive and negative charges in metal and phosphorus, respectively) [89,90]. They have been widely used as cocatalysts in photocatalytic reactions and electrocatalysts in water splitting [91]. In 2017 and 2020, the Zen [92] and Mitsudome [90] groups reported Ni2P and Co2P catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitriles respectively by using different preparation methods and P precursors, respectively. The latter claimed that the phosphidation process increased the d-electron density of Co near the Fermi level, which thus resulted in the acceleration of the activation of both nitrile and H2. Anyway, few studies were related to transition metal phosphides for nitriles hydrogenation."
7,Bimetallic catalysts,"2.6 Bimetallic catalysts In 2018, Yoshimura and co-workers disclosed the catalyst of 25 %Pd-5 %Au/Al2O3 with acetic acid as a solvent for the quick capture of the produced primary amines as ammonium acetate species [93]. The author viewed that the support with more acidic sites on the surface was favored by the generation of primary amines, which was contrary to the findings of Saad’s research we mentioned in Section 2.1. Recently, ammonia borane (NH3•BH3, AB) has become an interesting hydrogen source in the reduction reactions on account of its nontoxicity, high solubility in water, facile transportation, and high volume/mass hydrogen density [94]. Pd has the dual role of catalyzing the AB dehydrogenation and hydrogenation nitriles, while Ni plays a role of selectively syntheses of primary amines from nitriles [95]. Thus, Göksu’s group developed a bimetallic catalyst of NiPd NPs encapsulated on graphene(G) for catalyzing the tandem AB dehydrogenation and nitriles selective hydrogenation through a new non-TOP (trioctylphosphine) route in 2014 [95]. Later in 2018, Liu further developed PdCu/Fe3O4 with AB in which Cu could activate the CN bond and then make it easier to be broken [96]. Following these works, this group further synthesized the G-CuNi-NPs catalyst for the tandem reaction using the same method, where the noble metal Pd was replaced by Cu [97]. The support G had an atomic level and flat surface as well as high adsorption capacity for organic molecules, which could be used to enrich the reactants around the NP proximity, further increasing the catalytic efficiency. However, AB is relatively expensive and hard to regenerate. In addition, HCOOH is a cheaper and more readily available hydrogen donor than AB but is seldom used in hydrogenation of nitriles [98]. Liu and co-workers used HCOOH-NEt3 as an H source and explored an Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-RhCu@mSiO2 bimetallic catalyst system, in which Ru catalyzed the decomposition of HCOOH to generate active hydrogen, and then the hydrogenation of the nitriles was facilitated by the RhCu alloy [99]. The special structure of this catalyst made it have micro tunnels ensuring the high selectivity of primary amines. In a word, bimetallic catalysts (BM) which integrate two different ratios of distinct metal atoms have attracted great interest especially in the field of metal catalysis [100–103] and have great potential in the field of selective nitrile hydrogenation. The excellent selectivity control performance may be attributed to the altered electronic properties and/or the surface structure of bimetallic alloy which provides strong and interactional active sites [104]. Furthermore, BM also reduced the level of noble metal. In general, catalytic transfer hydrogenation technology was exploited to avoid the use of high hydrogen pressure, while the hydrogen source could inhibit the side products by releasing basic species in some cases. Additional studies on transition metals replacing noble metals are needed."
8,Other catalytic systems,"2.7 Other catalytic systems In 2019, Wang and co-workers produced a metal-free catalyst that was highly stable, porous, and multi-functional for the production of primary amines from nitriles with NaBH4 as hydrogen donor [105]. Furthermore, the graphitic-N had been demonstrated to be the active specie of the catalysts."
9,Reaction parameters of benzonitrile in each catalytic system,"2.8 Reaction parameters of benzonitrile in each catalytic system This section aims to showed the current state of the arts of nitriles hydrogenation to primary amines via the intuitive presentation and analysis of relevant reaction features, namely, optimized reaction conditions including time, temperature, H2 pressure, the grades of solvent toxicity, and types as well as loadings of additives. Though catalytic loading is an important reaction parameter, it is not included due to the difficult calculation in some cases. However, it was complicated and cumbersome to analyze each data in every currently reported literature. Thus, the data and analysis described hereof was only performed on the substrate of benzonitrile, because it was often exploited as a model substrate. Exceptions mainly existed in the catalytic systems of MS and dense phase CO2, in which butylamine, benzyl cyanide, decanenitrile, or other nitriles were studied except benzonitrile. Besides, this paper choses the representative reaction conditions in each catalytic system to describe current state of the arts as accurately as possible. The first condition parameter assessed was reaction time. We calculated the percent yield of the product (benzylamine) to time (h) ratio for each of the selected reports. This ratio represented the catalytic turnovers completed per time unit to produce benzylamine and was abbreviated as TCH (turnovers completed per hour) (Fig. 5a, left axis, bars). In this case, protocols exhibiting the highest TCH values were the ones consuming the shortest time. According to Fig. 5a, G-NiPd NPs [95] was the catalyst consuming the shortest reaction time (0.17 h, TCH = 582). G-NiCu NPs [97], MC-Pt [66], and Co2P [90] were ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th with the TCH values of 194(0.5 h), 192(0.5 h), and 93(1 h), respectively. Generally, TCH values are lower than 50, in which reaction time ranged 2–82 h to produce benzylamine with yields between 76% and 99%. On the other hand, to compare the optimized reaction temperature in each selected catalyst, we calculated the percent yield to temperature (°C) ratio (YTR) (Fig. 5a, right axis, dots). In this manner, the higher the YTR value, the lower the temperature given catalytic hydrogenation took to achieve its yields reported. But if we consider energy expenditure for minimizing energy waste in the reaction system and even avoiding dissipation by a heating source, a temperature value close to room temperature (20–25 °C) is preferred. Notably, temperatures below room temperature would be unfavorable because they are also energy costs associated. Thus, the maximum value of YTR would be 5. As Fig. 5a shows, G-NiPd NPs [95], MC-Ru1 [62], Ni2P [92], and G-NiCu NPs[97] are the top four catalysts in the values of YTR in the range of 3.8–4.5, corresponding to room temperature. Most YTR values range from 0.7 to 2.5 (40–140 °C). A comparison of the reaction H2 pressure (bar) is charted in Fig. 5b (left axis, bars). For analysis, percent yield to pressure ratio (YPR), meaning that the higher the YPR, the lower the H2 pressure required. But considering that the system performs a reaction at atmospheric pressure (1 bar), the risks of handling a hazardous gas under strict conditions and the requirement for expensive and specialized equipment to ensure safety could be avoided. Therefore, the maximum YPR value would approach 100. Moreover, several reports used transfer hydrogenation instead of using H2 as a hydrogen donor. Hence, we will discuss this in additives. Fig. 5b shows that the highest YPR is obtained with Ru3-CO/K-Alu C [38] (1 bar, YPR = 93). Generally, H2 pressure ranged 20–60 bar to produce benzylamine with yields between 85% and > 99%. Consequently, more work for an advance at decreasing the pressure for the preparation of benzylamine from benzonitrile are highly recommended. The grades of solvent toxicity were also demonstrated in Fig. 5b (right axis, dots). The value of 2 represented the solvent was poisonous, such as THF, dioxane, benzene, toluene, and etc. The value of 1 represented low or non-toxic, including water and alcohols other than methanol. Besides, to prohibit the formation of byproducts, additives such as bases and CO2 were employed for catalysis. The hydrogen donors such as H3N-BH3, HCOOH-NEt3, and NaHBEt3 make the reaction systems free from high H2 pressure, while can also provide an alkaline environment. Table 1 displayed the number of additives in each selected report in the way of mol/mol, MPa, or ml/mmol. These units are used because they are hard to unify. Most studies need additives, which arises problems like environmental and economical concern as well as deactivation of the catalysts. Thus, removing the additives but keeping high selectivity for the desired amines is still a certain promising prospect for the future. Ideally, the reaction should operate in mild and green conditions without additives. However, achieving such a goal is not straightforward. The following is illustrative examples: (1) MC-Ru1 [62] showed the relatively high YTR (4.3, room temperature) as well as YPR (32, 3 bar) values and did not use any additives to produce benzylamine in 95% yield, while was used in a quite long time (24 h) and toxic solvent THF. (2) Though Ru3-CO/K-Alu C [38] exhibited no additives and the best YPR (93, 1 bar) value, its TOH (1.1, 82 h) and YTR (1.3, 70 °C) values were low. (3) Ni2P [92] could produce benzylamine in 96% yield under room temperature, however, the TOH (0.9, 5 h) was low and consumption of additive was high (AB, 5 mol/mol). (4) G-NiPd NPs [95] and G-CuNi NPs [97] showed some of the best TCH (582, 0.17 h; 194, 0.5 h) and YTR (4.5, 22 °C; 4.4, 22 °C) values, but they consumed more loading (3 mol/mol) of AB in toxic solvent methanol. The relevant reaction features of each catalytic system were summarized here. BM may be the most potential catalytic system in preparation of primary amines from nitriles due to its generally mildest conditions (TCH > 33, YTR > 2.5). But most BM systems published used NH3BH3 or HCOOH-NEt3 as H donor and base. CCM has moderate TCH and YTR values as well as a quite high YPR value (9–20, 5–10 bar). Other CCM’s H2 pressures which were not presented in Fig. 5 were also under 30 bar (YPR ∼ 3.5). Nevertheless, the base of the NH3 water solution was exploited in most reports of CCM. In the catalysts of phosphides, Ni2P [92] (TCH = 19, YTR = 3.8) used NH3BH3 as H donor in low temperature but a long time, while Co2P [90] (TCH = 93, YTR = 0.7) was in contrast with H2 as H donor and NH3 as a base. Both of them reacted in a non-toxic solvent, which is green and healthy. Catalytic systems using dense phase CO2 were carried out under moderate temperatures and H2 pressures but with a long time. However, the introduction of scCO2 (7–10 MPa) was critical and inevitable, increasing the reaction system pressures. Both MS and CM catalytic systems have big internal differences, which prevents the comparison with other systems. Surprisingly, Ru3-CO/K-Alu C [38] could catalyze benzonitrile hydrogenation reactions in 1 atm due to the doping of K, whereas, reaction time needed to be sacrificed under this circumstance. In addition, transfer hydrogenation could make the reaction condition milder when comparing Pd/C [39] with Ni@mSiO2@LDH [41]. MC consumed a highly long time (TCH < 15) except for MC-Ru2 [63], MC-Pt [66], and MC-Fe1 [57] and needed high temperature (YTR < 2) other than MC-Ru1 [62]. In general, non-noble metal required harder conditions than noble metals due to the lower TCH and YTR values. But transfer hydrogenation may to some extent make the conditions milder, such as MC-Pt [66] and MC-Co5 [72] which have higher TCH (192) and YTR (1.8) values respectively. At last, metal-free NC-800 catalyst [105] could also undergo transfer hydrogenation and demanded comparative low temperature (60 °C, YTR = 1.7) as well as long time (6 h, TCH = 17). But these values are not significant because there is only one sample of metal-free catalyst. In the end, it is worth noting that the analysis described hereof was performed on the substrate of benzonitrile. For the other substrates investigated, conditions may alter and one catalytic system can defeat another. However, this is a relatively rigorous analysis to systematically demonstrate the characteristics of each system in the aspect of reaction parameters and develop future methodologies to design catalysts."
10,Assessment of catalytic systems on nitriles containing functional groups and aliphatic nitriles,"The current research status and trends were completely shown in Section 2. Thus, this section aims to investigate the relationship between substrate structures and catalytic systems, including the substrate structure especially the steric effect on the yield, the suitable substrate scopes in each catalytic system, tolerance of partial functional group and etc. The best results of the catalytic systems on the reduction of selective nitriles group are displayed in the presence of ether groups (Scheme 1 ), halogens (Scheme 2 ), amino groups (Scheme 3 ), carbonyl groups (Scheme 4 ), hydroxyl groups (Scheme 5 ), nitro groups (Scheme 6 ), C = C and C≡C bonds (Schemes 7 ), heteroaromatic compounds (Scheme 8 ), and other nitrile groups (dinitriles; Scheme 9 ) and aliphatic nitriles (Scheme 10 )."
11,Nitriles containing ether groups,"3.1 Nitriles containing ether groups The hydrogenation of ether group-containing nitriles has widely been investigated (Scheme 1) under many catalytic systems with very high yields. Scheme 1 showed that mono- and di-substituted benzonitriles (1a-1f) with ether group were facile to be reduced under many catalytic systems, such as MC [57,64,69,71], CCM [80,82,83], BM [96], etc. The types of catalysts were affected by the position of the methoxy (1a-1c), which might be related to the spatial effect. However, cyclic ether nitriles (1 g-1i) were only hydrogenated in good yields after using CCM [82,85] or MC [57] catalysts. On the other hand, for methoxy substituted benzyl cyanide (1j, 1 k), useful catalysts were limited to MC [57–59,69] catalysts except for 3,5-dimethoxyphenylacetonitrile (1 l). We could conclude from Scheme 1 that MC and CCM were effective for the most nitriles that contained ether groups. High yields were also obtained with MS, especially Pd/C [39] for the substrates of 4-methoxybenzonitrile (1a), 2-methoxybenzonitrile (1c), 2-cyano-6-methoxynaphthalene (1d), and veratronitrile (1f). Phosphides [92] could achieve high yields towards 1a, 3-methoxybenzonitrile (1b), and 1f. Furthermore, BM [96,99] was reported for the hydrogenation of 1b, 4-methoxybenzonitrile (1a), and 1 l in good yields. All the substrates of nitriles containing ether groups could reach yields > 90% under the specific catalysts."
12,Nitriles containing halogens,"3.2 Nitriles containing halogens Catalytic systems with a consistently high selectivity towards various nitriles containing halogens are depicted in Scheme 2. It could be concluded that the chemo-selective hydrogenation of nitriles with halogens substituents had been investigated as systematically. The order of electronegativity of halogens is as follows: F > CF3 > Cl > Br > I [106,107], but we hardly see this effect on the hydrogenation of halogenated nitriles. However, the steric hindrance played a significant role in the title process. MC [63,66,72,73], CCM [80,83,85,86], MS [38,39], BM [99], and phosphides [90] were the preferred catalysts for para-nitriles containing halogens (2a-2e) which may have the lowest steric hindrance. However, for meta- (2f-2i) and ortho-position (2j-2 m) substitution or di- and tri-substitution (2n-2 t), only MC [58,59,61,63,66,68,69,75] and CCM [80,82,85,86] worked. It had to be emphasized that this was not always the case. An interesting result was reported for 2-chlorobenzonitrile (2 k) and 3,4-difluorobenzonitrile (2o) which could be hydrogenated in good yields by BM [96,99] as well. Besides, aliphatic nitrile (2u) was also hydrogenated in good yields by MC [75] and CCM [83]. To the best of our knowledge, 2-bromobenzonitrile (2 l) was seldom explored apart from Co@NC-700 [86] catalyst where 80.1% yields were reported. Compared to other mono-substituted halogenated nitriles, this reaction result was relatively low, which may be attributed to the collective effect of electron-withdrawing property and steric hindrance. The low yields of 44% for 3,5-difluorobenzonitrile (2n) may be contributed to the low activity of MC-Fe2 catalyst [68] which was the only one reported catalyst for hydrogenation as far as we know. Surprisingly, tri-substituted benzonitrile (2 t) [82] was hydrogenated in good yields of 85%. Similar to the hydrogenation of nitriles containing ether groups, MC and CCM were widely useful in the hydrogenation of nitriles containing halogens. In addition, BM [96,99] could achieve up to 90% yields for the hydrogenation of 4-chlorobenzonitrile (2b), 4-bromobenzonitrile (2c), 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (2e), 2 k, and 2o, in particular Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-RhCu@mSiO2. Phosphides [90] were efficient for the substrates of 2c and 2e."
13,Nitriles containing amino groups,"3.3 Nitriles containing amino groups As shown in Scheme 3, good results have been achieved for the para-, meta-, and ortho-aminobenzonitriles (3a-3c) whose highest yields were all up to 98% by the MC [63,66,70] or CCM [80,82,85] catalysts. Therefore, the position of amino groups seemed to have little impact on the hydrogenation results, which was contrary to the suppose of Koprivova’s group [108]. When another substituent of F was added to the 3-aminobenzonitrile, the yields of 3-cyano-4-fluoroaniline (3d) slightly reduced to 89% through Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 [82] catalyst perhaps due to the steric hindrance effect. MC was effective for all the para-, meta-, and ortho-aminobenzonitriles (3a-3c), while Co/Phen@-Al2O3-800 [80] and Co-N-C@ MgO-700 [85] were only preferred 2-aminobenzonitrile (3c, 99% yields) and 4-aminobenzonitrile (3a, 99% yields) respectively. In addition, BM catalyst of Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-RhCu@mSiO2 [99] also gave good yields for 3-aminobenzonitrile (3b, 93%) and 4-aminobenzonitrile (3a, 94%)."
14,Nitriles containing carbonyl groups,"3.4 Nitriles containing carbonyl groups In this part, the carbonyl groups contained in nitriles are ketone, aldehyde, ester, and amide. Up to now, the hydrogenation of nitrile groups could selectively take place in the presence of carbonyl groups (Scheme 4) except for ketone and aldehyde. Though in fact they were different functional groups, electronic effect was hard to discuss here because they all contained carbonyl groups. First, for keto and aldehyde groups in nitriles (4a-4c), it’s not tolerated and easy to be hydrogenated. There was none but Co2P catalyst [90] could hydrogenate 4-cyanophenyl methyl ketone (4a) into the corresponding primary amine but retain the keto group in high yields (94%). In contrast, both carbonyl and nitrile groups in 4-cyanophenyl methyl ketone (4b) and 4-cyanobenzaldehyde (4c) were simultaneously reduced by Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 [82] and MC-Co2 [61] catalysts, respectively. Regarding the nitriles containing ester groups (4d-4f), all of them produced excellent yields even lactone, and displayed excellent tolerance of ester groups. MC [69,70,75] was particularly profitable in the hydrogenation of 4-cyanobenzoic acid methyl ester (4d, >88% yields) and 4-(isopropyloxycarbonyl)benzonitrile (4e, 95% yields), while CCM [80,82,85] gave good yields to 4d (90%-92%) and 5-cyanophthalide (4f, 90–95%). Pd/C [39] and Co2P [90] were merely helpful for 4d. Concerning nitriles having amide groups (4 g-4j), 4-cyanobenzamide (4 g) and N-(4-cyanophenyl)acetamide (4 h) reached yields up to 98% [39], while the syntheses of 4i and 4j were more difficult due to the large substituent group related to the spatial effect. Their yields declined to 71% and 89% via Co-N-C@MgO-700 catalyst [85], respectively. CCM [82,85] could hydrogenate all nitriles containing amide groups in Scheme 4 in good yields. In addition, Pd/C [39] achieved 98% yields for both the hydrogenation of 4 g and 4 h, while MC-Co5 [72] and G-NiPd NPs [95] favored 4 h and gave yields of 96% and 90% respectively."
15,Nitriles containing hydroxyl groups,"3.5 Nitriles containing hydroxyl groups Few catalysts were reported to effectively hydrogenate nitriles containing hydroxyl groups into corresponding amines (Scheme 5). Pd/C [39] achieved very high selectivity for 4-cyanophenol (5a) with yields of 98%. Besides, Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-RhCu@mSiO2 [99] was effective for the reduction of 4-cyanobenzyl alcohol (5b) giving 98% yields. But the coexistence of F atom and hydroxyl groups reduced its selectivity marginally, and 3-fluoro-4-(hydroxymethyl) benzonitrile (5c) provided the desired products in 89% yields by Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 catalyst [82] without significant dehalogenations. The catalysts that worked in hydroxyl group-containing nitriles were quite different and less studied."
16,Nitriles containing nitro groups,"3.6 Nitriles containing nitro groups The research of the hydrogenation of nitriles containing nitro groups starts rather late and has been rarely reported, upon our knowledge, only three catalysts Ni2P [92], G-NiPd NPs [95], and G-CuNi NPs [97] have been reported so far (Scheme 6). Nitriles containing nitro groups are likely to pose selectivity problems because nitro groups are not tolerated to give the corresponding nitroanilines. When the nitrile group in 4-nitrobenzonitrile (6a) was hydrogenated through Ni2P, the nitro group was reduced at the same time, producing phenylenediamine in 95% yields [92]. What’s worse, for other substrates of nitriles with a nitro group (6b-6f), the nitro group was converted to primary amine while the nitrile group was intact, forming aminobenzonitrile in yields > 86% [92,95,97]. These results suggested that the activation energy barrier of the nitrile group increased by the π-donor conjuration of –NO2 and –CN, thus making it impossible to reduce –CN under the current reaction conditions [97]."
17,Nitriles containing C = C and C≡C bonds,"3.7 Nitriles containing C = C and C≡C bonds The preferential hydrogenation of a nitrile group in the presence of C = C and C≡C bonds may be probably the biggest challenge because these bonds are arguably the most reactive functional groups reduced by metal catalysts [109]. Indeed, it is possible to reduce a nitrile group but remain C = C bond to some extent by using MC-Fe [68], MC-Mn [59,75], and Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 [82] catalysts (Scheme 7). MC-Fe3 [69] catalyst gave a fully hydrogenated product of 2-butenenitrile (7a) in 85% conversion and 66% selectivity. MC-Mn1 [59] could selectively catalyze hex-5-enenitrile (7b) to amine without affecting the double bond, but the yields (78%) were unsatisfactory. The development of the MC-Mn2 catalyst [75] was beyond doubt a breakthrough, which could give desired products including cinnamonitrile (7c) and 4-chlorocinnamonitrile (7d) in 92% and 87% yields with 10% of fully hydrogenated product respectively. Besides, Co-terephthalic acid MOF@C-800 catalyst [82] could also achieve high selectivity for (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienenitrile (7e, 88%). These two catalytic systems were also two of the few catalytic systems with high selectivity towards nitriles containing C≡C bonds (7f, 7 g) currently. Moreover, the position of the additional substituent containing C≡C bonds had a great impact on the reactivity, which might be attributed to the steric effect."
18,"Nitrogen-, Sulfur-, and Oxygen- containing heteroaromatic nitriles","3.8 Nitrogen-, Sulfur-, and Oxygen- containing heteroaromatic nitriles A selection of heteroaromatic nitriles based on pyridine (8a-8f), thiophene (8 g, 8 h, 8 l), furan (8i, 8j), quinoline (8 k), and indole (8 m, 8n) were selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding primary amines in excellent yields (Scheme 8). These amine derivatives with heteroaromatic structures are particularly important for drugs because of their potent insecticidal and antimicrobial properties [95]. For cyanopyridines (8a-8c), all of them obtained satisfactory results (highest yields of 99.9%) in suitable catalytic systems [105]. The number of effective catalysts was decreasing in the order of para-, meta-, and ortho-positions substituted nitriles (8c, 8b, 8a), which was hardly explained by the electronic effect. However, when cyanopyridine had methyl (8d) or chlorine atom (8e) substituent, its conversion and selectivity sharply declined, whereas 6-methoxynicotinonitrile (8f) still achieved high yields of 98% [39,75,92]. Steric hindrance effect might be a reason for the poor hydrogenation performance of 8d and 8e. The yields of 2-furancarbonitrile (8j) and 2-thiophenecarbonitrile (8 h) were slightly higher than 3-furancarbonitrile (8i) and 3-thiophenecarbonitrile (8 g). Besides, the hydrogenation of 6-cyanoquinoline (8 k) was also studied and high yields of 86% catalyzed by the MC-Co5 catalyst was achieved [72]. Indoles (8 m, 8n) as well as 2-thienylacetonitrile (8 l) did not cause any selectivity problems and furnished desired products in good yields by MC [63] and/or CCM [80,82,85]. For nitrogen, sulfur-, and oxygen-containing heteroaromatic nitriles, only MC was widely suitable. NC-800 [105], the metal-free catalyst, was the preferred catalyst for pyridines with only one nitrile group (8a-8c). The Co2P catalyst [90] could achieve good yields for 8b (92%), 8c (92%), and 8j (95%). Besides, Ni2P catalyst [92] gave the highest conversion (61%) and selectivity (53%) for 8d that were quite unsatisfactory. CCM [80,82,85] was described to give excellent results (yields > 82%) for 8c, 3-furancarbonitrile (8i), 4-cyanoindole (8 m), and 5-cyanoindole (8n)."
19,Dinitriles,"3.9 Dinitriles Selected results for the hydrogenation of dinitriles were shown in Scheme 9. 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (1,6-HMD) is a crucial building block for the production of Nylon-6,6, and it can be obtained via hydrogenation of hexanedinitrile (9a) where MC-Fe1 [57], MC-Fe2 [68], Co/Phen@-Al2O3-800 [80], and Co-N-C@ MgO-700 [85] catalysts were the preferred catalysts. Besides, 6-aminocapronitrile (ACN), a partial hydrogenation product of hexanedinitrile (9b), is a raw material of Nylon-6 production. Rh/Al2O3 with scCO2 [54] successfully reduced only one nitrile group and selectively form aminonitrile in 96.6% yields. Rh/Al2O3 with scCO2 [54] was also applied to the hydrogenation of one nitrile group in terephthalonitrile (9c), isophthalonitrile (9d), and phthalonitrile (9e) with yields of 94.2%, 53.1%, and 32.6% respectively. The lower activity observed for the ortho- and meta-compounds could be attributed to the steric effect. Co@CN-900 catalyst [83] was also found to hydrogenate one nitrile group in 9c with 90% yields. For the complete reduction of 9f and 9 g, MC [61,67,72] and CCM [80] catalysts exhibited 79%-98% yields. Co/Phen@-Al2O3-800 [80] offered 65% and 82% selectivity for the complete hydrogenation of 2-methylglutaronitrile (9i) and 4-(cyanomethyl)benzonitrile (9 h). MC-Mn2 [75] reduced sebaconitrile (9j) in 85% yields. Considering the influence of steric hindrance, low 9i activity could be explained accordingly. Thus, we can make a conclusion that the regioselective hydrogenation of a specific nitrile group in dinitriles is still a major problem, and steric hindrance may play a significant role and be a huge challenge."
20,Aliphatic nitriles,"3.10 Aliphatic nitriles Generally, the hydrogenation of aliphatic nitriles to corresponding primary amines is more difficult and needs harsher conditions than aromatic nitriles [82]. Herein, we summarized the best yields of aliphatic nitriles without functional groups on different catalytic systems in Scheme 10. From Scheme 10, the selective hydrogenation of aliphatic nitriles is still difficult, because most of them only achieved high yields in less than two catalytic systems. Moreover, cyclopentanecarbonitrile (10 g) only obtained moderate yields of 74% [57] and 77% [85]. CCM catalysts were suitable for aliphatic nitriles with more than four carbon atoms (10c-10 h) [57,63,69,70,75]. BM catalysts only catalyzed acetonitrile (10a) and propiononitrile (10b) in good yields [95,96,99], and CCM were the preferred catalysts for aliphatic nitriles with more than five carbon atoms (10d-10 h) [80,83,85]. NC-800 [105], MS [38] and catalytic systems using high dense CO2 [48] were especially useful for a few substates. In conclusion, from Scheme 1-10, clear rules of electronic effect on nitrile hydrogenation cannot be seen, but steric hindrance no doubt has a significant effect where multiple, large, or ortho-position substituents are not conducive to nitrile hydrogenation. We can also conclude that CM and CCM catalysis systems are the most widely applicable catalysts and have an excellent performance in dinitriles as well as nitriles containing C = C and C≡C bonds. MS and phosphides catalytic systems prefer substrates that have a simple structure, and the latter is one of the few catalytic systems with high activity towards nitriles containing keto and nitro groups. The substrate scope of the BM catalytic system is smaller than CM and CCM and is easily influenced by steric hindrance resulting in the unavailability of some complex substrates. Finally, a catalytic system with dense phase CO2 is the one that has the most limited substrate scope."
21,Conclusion,"Primary amines are a vital class of chemical substances in the industry due to their straightforward functionalization. The selective hydrogenation of nitriles into primary amines is a challenging task where catalytic systems play a key role. In this perspective, this review has summarized the most recent progress and current state of the arts in nitriles hydrogenation to primary amines. Then the yields of various nitriles containing functional groups and aliphatic nitriles on catalytic systems were also discussed. Moreover, the above Schemes 1-10 could be used to evaluate the extensiveness and systematicness of the researches on the hydrogenation of nitriles containing certain functional groups and aliphatic nitriles."
22,Future research topics to consider for advancing this area,"The problems that we are most concerned about in the title process include selectivity on primary amines, the usage of additives and the tolerance of functional groups, which have been solved to a certain extent in the past ten years. Mechanistically, selectivity may rely on the nature of the catalytic systems, additives, and substrate structures. As for catalytic systems, considering the costs, environmental and reusable concerns, non-noble metal based heterogeneous catalysts without using bases have great potential in this area. Thus, for further designing BM and CCM catalysts, eliminating additives such as base is the main direction, which might be achieved by modifying the support with basic functional groups or alkali metal oxides. The usage of green and cheap dense phase CO2 is another way to tune the selectivity. Catalytic systems using dense phase CO2 in the low pressure are suitable for specific substrates, which are waiting for further development. In addition, the traditional catalysts of MS are still effective in one or two reaction variables as long as they are properly modified. Thus, in the design of the future catalytic system, we can still learn from the advantages of traditional catalytic systems. For example, phosphide is a catalytic system that takes the advantages of the high selectivity of Raney Ni and Co catalysts, but improves their stability and activity. Moreover, the tolerance of easily reduced functional groups contained in nitriles includes carbonyl groups, nitro groups, C = C and C≡C bonds and additional nitrile groups. Keto, aldehyde, nitro groups were easy to face selectivity problems because they were not tolerated and reduced simultaneously. C = C and C≡C bonds could only be retained in specific catalysts, and the yield of the latter was unsatisfactory. Hydrogenation of a specific nitrile group in dinitriles is not easy and only the Rh/Al2O3 with scCO2 catalysts showed promising results. Fortunately, ester groups and amide groups were tolerable. Selective hydrogenation of aliphatic nitriles is another issue that we concerned about, and there is great room for advances within aliphatic nitriles. All in all, there is still a need for the development of various novel strategies for designing catalytic systems to further solve these significant issues using environmentally friendlier and milder reaction conditions. Besides, the hydrogenation of nitriles is the reaction with the highest atomic economy, but depends on the availability of nitrile molecules. Therefore, future developments of nitrile synthesis would generate extra value for the title process. On the other hand, primary amines can be functionalized in many ways such as by N-formylation [110]. Thus, the one-pot reaction of nitrile synthesis and hydrogenation to produced primary amines or formation and the function of primary amine to produce value compounds containing N has great potential. This review is intended to provide a novel and complete method to design the one-pot reaction catalysts from the perspective of reaction conditions variables and substrate structure."
