0,Introduction,"In recent years, global energy crises have led to the development of renewable energies like biodiesel and hydrogen [1]. Due to abundance of water on earth, water splitting using solar light driven photocatalysts is a promising alternative for future energy production. Despite vast research in this area, still more studies are required to increase the efficiency of the photocatalysis process. One the other hand, the price of glycerol, one of the biodiesel byproducts, has decreased significantly due to overproduction [2]. Valorization of sustainable glycerol to green fuels is therefore another promising alternative for future energy production. In addition, investigation of glycerol photo-reforming can assist with clarifying the mechanisms of photocatalysis. This knowledge is also beneficial to increase insight into water photo-splitting as well as glycerol photo-conversion to valuable liquid products. TiO2 is the most common photocatalyst which benefits from advantages like very high photocatalyst activity, low cost, suitable chemical and thermal stability, and low toxicity [3,4]. These advantages make TiO2 a promising photocatalyst; however, more research is required to achieve an economically viable hydrogen production process on an industrial scale. One of the most efficient techniques to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is incorporating metals or metal oxides as co-catalysts [5]. The presence of co-catalysts could provide hydrogen reaction sites, favor the charge separation reaction, trap photo-generated electrons and extend light absorption toward the visible range [6]. Among the metals used as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic glycerol conversion to hydrogen, like Pt [7–21], Cu [16,20,22–31], Au [12,13,21,32–34], Pd [12,13,21,35], Ni [21,30,36,37], Co [21,38], Ag [21,39], Mn [21], Cr [21], and W [21], Pt is the one most commonly used. Fu et al. [40] found that Pt decorated photocatalysts exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate and the photocatalytic activity decreased in the order of Pt>Au>Pd>Rh>Ag>Ru. In another work, Pt was found to be the most active co-catalyst for hydrogen production by investigating the vast range of Pt, Pd, Ir, Au, Ru, Rh, and Ni [41]. Recently, López-Tenllado et al. [13] reported the order of Pt>Pd>Au for propan-2-ol and Pt≈Au>Pd for glycerol photocatalytic valorization to hydrogen. Although there is much research on the synthesis of photocatalyst and feasibility of hydrogen production from glycerol, this field suffers from the lack of optimization of operating parameters. On the other hand, it is very challenging to develop a consensus on the optimum value of operating parameters due to significant differences and contradictions in previous work [42]. These conflicts may be attributed to the application of a ‘one-variable-at-a-time’ approach and to a disregard for the interaction effect of the parameters [43]. To assess the interaction effect of various operating parameters, a comprehensive model is required. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are two useful modeling methods that can be applied for complex processes like photocatalytic hydrogen production because they do not require knowledge about the fundamentals of the photocatalytic process [44]. RSM is a statistical method to design experiments, develop a model, investigate effects of parameters, assess the interaction effect of the parameters, and optimize the desired responses [45,46]. ANN was inspired by biological neural networks taking advantage of some simple and non-linear models [47]. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be further employed to optimize the output of ANN models. GA utilizes a robust optimization procedure that mimics the process of natural selection, and its global optimizing capability is more powerful in comparison with other heuristic optimization methods [48]. To the best of our knowledge, a single statistical analysis on glycerol conversion to hydrogen has been reported to date. Bastos et al. [49] examined the glycerol valorization to hydrogen using a simple factorial design statistical model. The critical point which was obtained corresponded to a minimum, i.e., no optimization could be performed using this model. On the other hand, there is no publication in this field using other powerful methods such as RSM or ANN. Moreover, no statistical analysis study was found on the optimization of glycerol valorization to hydrogen using a TiO2 based photocatalyst (as the most common photocatalyst). Herein, we investigated individual and interaction effects of four key operating parameters (including catalyst loading, Pt%, glycerol%, and pH) on the photocatalytic glycerol valorization to hydrogen rate using Pt/TiO2. Two approaches of RSM and ANN were employed to model the process, and their predictive ability for photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions was compared. Moreover, GA was applied to optimize the response of the ANN model. Finally, the level of influence of each operating parameter on the amount of produced hydrogen was calculated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The commercial TiO2 Aeroxide P25 (≥99.5%) photocatalyst was provided by Evonik Industries. Hexachloroplatinic acid (IV) (H2PtCl6·6H2O, ≥37.50% Pt) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich to be used as the platinum precursor. Glycerol (≥99.5%) and ethyl alcohol (99.99%) were supplied by Caledon and Commercial Alcohols, respectively. pH adjustment was made using NaOH (≥97%) and HCl (36.5–38.0%) which were purchased from VWR. Milli-Q water was utilized in the synthesis of photocatalysts."
3,Preparation of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst Platinum deposition on TiO2 was performed based on the photo-deposition method [18]. Briefly, a suspension of 1g TiO2 and 120ml ethyl alcohol solution (10%) was sonicated for 30min using a Hielscher UP400S Ultrasonic Processor. Hexachloroplatinic acid solution in water was then added to the suspension in order to obtain Pt loadings of 0.02, 2.51, and 5wt%. The mixture was purged with nitrogen for 15min to remove the oxygen present in the mixture. A photoreactor equipped with four 20W Black-Ray® mercury tubes (365nm) was used to perform the photocatalytic experiments. The irradiation was maintained for 3h under continued nitrogen flow and constant 500rpm magnetic stirring in all experiments. Finally, the Pt/TiO2 material was filtered, washed and dried overnight at 110°C."
4,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.3 Photocatalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were obtained using a Bruker SMART APEXII X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation source (λ=1.5418Å). The patterns were measured from 2θ=10–80° at a step of 0.02° and a scan rate of 1.2min−1. The Anatase:Rutile ratio of the samples was calculated using Eq. (1) [50]: (1) % R u t i l e = 1 [ 1 + 0.8 ( I A / I B ) ] × 100 where IA and IB are, respectively, the intensities of anatase (101) and rutile (110) reflections. TEM images were collected using a JOEL JEM 1230 operated an accelerating voltage of 120kV. To prepare the samples for the analysis, they were dispersed in water and sonicated using a Hielscher UP400S Ultrasonic Processor and then placed on carbon coated copper TEM grids."
5,Hydrogen production experiments,"2.4 Hydrogen production experiments The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were carried out in gas-tight Pyrex reaction cells using the prepared photocatalysts. In each experiment, predetermined amounts of glycerol, water, and photocatalyst (Table 2) were introduced into the cells. After sonication of the suspensions for 5min to ensure proper dispersion of photocatalysts, the pH was adjusted using NaOH and HCl solutions. The volume of suspensions was ensured to be kept at 5ml. Before irradiation, the reaction cells were purged with nitrogen (20ml/min) for 15min to remove oxygen and stirred in the dark for 20min to allow the adsorption of glycerol on the catalyst surface. The cells were then irradiated with a light intensity of 1600μW/cm2 in a photoreactor equipped with four 20W Black-Ray® mercury tubes. The spectral chart of the mercury tubes is illustrated in Fig. S1. During the experiments, the mixtures were maintained at constant 500rpm magnetic stirring using Thermo-Scientific™ Cimarec™ 15-Position magnetic stirrer. The temperature of the reactor was maintained around ambient (25°C) using a cooling fan. The photocatalytic reactions were assessed after illumination of the samples for 4h. To measure the amount of produced hydrogen in the photocatalytic reactions, 0.5ml of gas headspace was sampled from the cells using a gas tight syringe with valve and injected to a Hewlett Packard HP 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with TCD detector, carboxen-1010 capillary column, and nitrogen carrier gas. Three replicate runs were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. To ensure that no hydrogen was produced in the absence of illumination, a sample was also analyzed without the use of UV irradiation."
6,Design and analysis of experiments,"2.5 Design and analysis of experiments 2.5.1 Box-Behnken experimental design The Box-Behnken experimental design was employed for the design of the experiment to evaluate the effect of four operating parameters, i.e., glycerol% (v/v%), catalyst loading (g/L), Pt% (wt%) and pH, which are respectively labeled A to D. These selected parameters were considered as the independent variables and the amount of produced hydrogen (μmol) after 4h of irradiation was selected as the dependent variable (response). The experimental ranges were obtained based on preliminary experiments, as presented in Table 1 . Accordingly, 29 sets of tests (including five center points) were defined for these four independent variables in three levels (coded as −1, 0, +1), as shown in Table 2. These data sets were then used to develop the RSM and ANN models. 2.5.2 RSM model For RSM, a second-order polynomial equation (Eq. (2)) was obtained to model the amount of produced hydrogen as a function of the four independent variables mentioned above (A–D). (2) Y = β 0 + β 1 A + β 2 B + β 3 C + β 4 D + β 12 A B + β 13 A C + β 14 A D + β 23 B C + β 24 B D + β 34 C D + β 11 A 2 + β 22 B 2 + β 33 C 2 + β 44 D 2 where Y is the amount of produced hydrogen (response), β0 represents the interception coefficient, β1 , β2 , β3, and β4 are the coefficients of the independent variables, β11 , β22 , β33 , and β44 are the quadratic terms, and β12 , β13 , β14 , β23 , β24 , and β34 are the interaction coefficients [51]. Moreover, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and optimization of produced hydrogen in the reaction were performed by Design-Expert® software (10.0.2.0 Stat-Ease, Inc. Minneapolis, USA). 2.5.3 ANN model For ANN, a three-layer feed-forward neural network was developed and trained by back-propagation gradient-descendent algorithm. The obtained experimental data were randomly classified into three sets containing 23, 3, and 3 data to be employed for train, test and validation, respectively. Training data sets were used for updating weights and biases via Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and the test data were utilized to evaluate the generalization ability of the trained network. Moreover, the error of validation data was supervised during training to avoid overfitting [52]. A hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function and two linear functions were used as transfer functions for the neurons in the hidden layer and the neurons in the input and output layers, respectively. The input and output layers had 4 and 1 neurons, respectively. To determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, different topologies were examined during which the number of neurons varied between 2 and 10. Each topology was repeated 10 times to prevent random correlation because of random initialization of the weights and biases [53]. To evaluate the performance of the networks, the coefficient of determination (R2 ), adjusted coefficient of determination (R2 adj ), root mean squared error (RMS), mean absolute error (MAE) and absolute average deviation (AAD) were calculated based on Eqs. (3)–(7). These parameters were also utilized to compare RSM and ANN models. (3) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ( ( y i , c a l − y i , exp ) 2 ( y a v e , exp − y i , exp ) 2 ) (4) R a d j 2 = 1 − [ ( 1 − R 2 ) n − 1 n − K − 1 ] (5) R M S = ∑ i = 1 n ( X i , c a l − X i , exp ) 2 n (6) M A E = ∑ i = 1 n | X i , c a l − X i , exp | n (7) A A D = { ∑ i = 1 n ( | X i , c a l − X i , exp | / X i , c a l ) n } × 100 where n represents the number of data points, K is the number of input variables, Xi,cal , X i,exp, and X ave,exp are the response of predicted, experimental and arithmetic mean of all experimental data, respectively. 2.5.4 Genetic algorithm GA optimization procedure was employed to optimize the ANN model. A primary population of 50 individuals with uniform distribution was randomly created to initialize the optimization procedure. A stochastic universal sampling was used as selection function, and the rank function was employed as fitness scaling function. In each generation, 80% and 15% of individuals were produced from crossover and mutation of the previous generation, respectively, and 5% of the population was chosen as elites and was guaranteed to survive to the next generation. Gaussian and scattered functions were used as the mutation and crossover functions respectively. 2.5.5 Garson’s method Garson’s method was employed to obtain the level of influence of variables on the response. This method is based on Eq. (8) which uses the connection weights of the neural network [54,55]: (8) I j = ∑ m = 1 m = N h ( ( | W j m i h | ∑ k = 1 k = N i | W k m i h | ) × | W m n h o | ) ∑ k = 1 k = N i { ∑ m = 1 m = N h ( ( | W k m i h | ∑ k = 1 k = N i | W k m i h | ) × | W m n h o | ) } where Ij refers to the relative importance of the j th input variable on the response, W represents the connection weights, and Ni and Nh refer to the numbers of input and hidden neurons, respectively. The superscripts ‘i’, ‘h’ and ‘o’ denote input, hidden and output layers, and the subscripts ‘k’, ‘m’ and ‘n’ are related to input, hidden and output neurons, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the prepared samples,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared samples XRD patterns of the prepared samples with different platinum loadings are presented in Fig. 1 . It demonstrates that in all TiO2 samples, the peaks related to Anatase and Rutile phases of TiO2 remained intact after platinum deposition. Pt (111) reflection at 2θ=39.84°, which is characteristic of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of platinum [56], obviously grew at 5% of Pt. Regarding the Pt (200) and Pt (220) reflections at 2θ=46.32° and 67.54°, only a slight shoulder can be observed for the sample loaded with 5% Pt [57]. Table 3 presents some characteristics for the prepared samples. The Scherrer equation [58] was employed to estimate the average Anatase (101) and Rutile (110) particle sizes which were found to be ca. 20 and 30nm for all particles, respectively. The Anatase:Rutile ratio in TiO2 was calculated based on the peak heights of Anatase (101) and Rutile (110) reflections [50], and was 1:6 for all of prepared samples. Similar particle sizes and phase ratios of TiO2 particles confirm that the Pt photo-deposition process did not affect the size and crystal structure of the TiO2 samples. The morphology of the prepared sample was studied, and the deposition of platinum particles on TiO2 was checked by TEM. Fig. 2 clearly displays deposited Pt particles on TiO2 as black dots for the 5.00% Pt/P25 sample. Based on this figure, the average size of the particles was around 25nm, and the mean metal nanoparticle size was around 2nm, which is in the range of previous studies [11,12,15]."
9,Experimental hydrogen production results,"3.2 Experimental hydrogen production results 29 sets of experiments were performed based on Box-Behnken design to study the effect of the four operating parameters mentioned above on the amount of produced hydrogen. For this purpose, the range of glycerol% (v/v%), catalyst loading (g/L), Pt% (wt%) and pH were 0.5–50%, 0.05–5g/L, 0.02–5%, and 2–12. The experimental design and obtained results are summerized in Table 2. These experimental data were utilized to implement the RSM and ANN models. The yield of produced hydrogen after 4h of experiments was calculated based on Eq. (9) and the results are presented in Table 2. As can be seen, the yield is greater at lower initial glycerol concentrations and among the designed experiments, the maximum yield (0.6169) corresponds to catalyst loading=5g/L, Pt%=2.51, glycerol%=0.5 and pH=7.

10,Modeling,"3.3 Modeling 3.3.1 ANN model Several networks with a different number of neurons in the hidden layer were evaluated to find the best configuration based on the minimum RMS. The neural network including a hidden layer with four neurons (architecture of 4-4-1) was found to be the most appropriate network structure to model the photocatalytic process. The predictions of the amount of produced hydrogen by the ANN model are listed in Table 2. The representation of predicted values versus experimental data (Fig. 3 ) shows a good predictive ability of the current ANN model. As seen in Table 4 , the R2 value of 0.9913 for the ANN model is in good agreement with the adjusted R2 adj of 0.9800. The high value of R2 denotes that the current ANN model is suitable for the prediction of this system. Furthermore, the small values of RMS (8.1706), MAE (5.9310) and AAD (8.1147) demonstrate that the developed ANN model has good approximation and generalization characteristics. 3.3.2 RSM model An empirical second-order polynomial equation was obtained based on RSM: (10) Y = − 190 + 3.34 A + 106 B + 49.0 C + 42.7 D + 0.150 A B + 0.377 A C − 0.126 A D + 2.86 B C − 2.55 B D − 1.61 C D − 0.0540 A 2 − 12.5 B 2 − 7.46 C 2 − 2.69 D 2 where Y represents the amount of produced hydrogen (μmol) and A, B, C, and D are, respectively, glycerol% (v/v%), catalyst loading (g/L), Pt% (wt%), and pH. The predicted values of produced hydrogen based on the current RSM model are presented in Table 2. The R2 , adjusted R2 adj , RMS, MAE, and AAD of the developed RSM model which are presented in Table 4, show good approximation and generalization characteristics for this model. To find the combination accuracy of the coefficients, the current model (Eq. (10)) was statistically investigated by ANOVA. This analysis showed that the p-value of the model is lower than 0.0001 which confirms that the model is adequate with more than 99% significance level. The predicted values by the developed RSM model are compared with the experimental data in Fig. 3. As can be seen, although the fitting capability of the RSM model is very good, it is not as suitable as the ANN model. 3.3.3 Comparison of ANN and RSM models The predicted values obtained from the ANN and RSM models and the corresponding accuracies and prediction capabilities of these two models (based on the values of R2 , R2 adj , RMS, AAD, and MAE) are given in Table 2 and Table 4, respectively. As it can be inferred, R2 of ANN model is closer to 1 compared to RSM model and R2 adj of ANN model is in closer agreement with the corresponding R2 . Furthermore, the value of RMS obtained for ANN is closer to zero compared to the RSM model. Moreover, AAD corresponding to ANN is around twice less compared to RSM. Table 4 suggests that both models are suitable to predict this photocatalytic system. However, the ANN model is superior for both data fitting and predictive performance. While RSM is limited by a second order polynomial, ANN is a more reliable modeling technique to represent the nonlinearities of this system. Thus, in the forthcoming subsections, the performance of the photocatalytic process is assessed based on the ANN model."
11,Effects and optimum of operating parameters,"3.4 Effects and optimum of operating parameters The response surface plots of the amount of produced hydrogen as functions of six pairs of the independent variables (i.e. glycerol%, catalyst loading, Pt%, and pH) are depicted in Fig. 4 . In all the plots, the values of the two parameters that are not varied in each graph have been fixed at the average of their ranges. Thus, these six surface plots pass through the average point of the system (catalyst loading=2.525g/L, Pt%=2.51, glycerol%=25 and pH=7), where the amount of produced hydrogen is around 251μmol. To compare the interaction of operating parameters more easily and their influence on the optimum value of other parameters, the two-dimensional representations of the response surfaces of Fig. 4 are also shown in Figs. S2–S5. Similarly to Fig. 4, the two factors which are not presented in each of these four diagrams have been considered equal to the average of their ranges. In the following subsections, the effects of the four operation parameters on the amount of produced hydrogen are discussed, as well as the effect of these parameters on the optimum value of other parameters. 3.4.1 Glycerol concentration Fig. 4a–c illustrates that the amount of produced hydrogen is slightly enhanced by increasing glycerol%, even though the enhancement is not considerable, and increasing glycerol% from 0.5 to 50% enhances the amount of produced hydrogen to only around 61%. Improvement of the amount of produced hydrogen by increasing glycerol% can be due to easier access of the photocatalyst to the glycerol molecule [26]. Enhancement of the amount of produced hydrogen by increasing glycerol% agrees with existing literature. In the case of using Pt/TiO2 for hydrogen production from glycerol, Daskalaki and Kondarides [7] reported that the amount of produced hydrogen was enhanced by increasing glycerol concentration from 0.073 to 7.93%. In another work conducted with the same photocatalyst but larger glycerol concentrations, it was found that the amount of produced hydrogen reached a plateau at high concentrations (up to 29.2%) [10]. Based on Fig. 4a–c, the optimum value of glycerol% is 50%, which can be considered in agreement with the 45% [17] and 53.6% [59] values reported as optimum glycerol% using TiO2 photocatalyst. Other than the amount of produced hydrogen, glycerol% could affect the optimum value of other parameters. According to Fig. 4a–c (and also Fig. S2), increasing glycerol% from 0.5 to 50% shifts the optimum catalyst loading from 3.75 to 3.95, the optimum Pt% from 2.75% to 4%, and the optimum pH from 4.4 to 6.4. By increasing glycerol%, the rate of oxidation half reaction increases, and further catalyst loading or Pt% provides more reaction sites for reduction half reaction. 3.4.2 Catalyst loading The effect of catalyst loading on the amount of produced hydrogen can be seen in Fig. 4a, d, and e. Analysis of these surface plots reveals that the amount of produced hydrogen could be enhanced up to 8.1 times by the optimization of catalyst loading. Moreover, these surface plots show that catalyst loading around 4g/L is optimal. Observation of an optimum value for catalyst loading may be due to the fact that, in a low amount of catalyst loading, a significant portion of radiated photons may transmit out of the photoreactor [60]. On the other hand, a high amount of catalyst loading may result in the tendency towards agglomeration of catalyst particles, thus rendering a part of the catalyst surface unavailable for photon absorption [61]. Other authors [7,38,62,63] have also reported an optimum value of catalyst loading in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions. The predictive accuracy of the developed model was compared to the experimental data given by Daskalaki and Kondarides [7], the only observed work in the literature on the investigation of hydrogen production from glycerol using Pt/TiO2 with different catalyst loading. The evaluation of this research shows that in the experimental conditions (0.0027% of glycerol, 0.5% of Pt%, and pH of 7) given in [7], the optimum value of the catalyst loading that was predicted by the current ANN model is 2.7g/L, which agrees very well with the reported optimum value of 2.7g/L (based on their experimental data). This comparison confirms the accuracy of the developed model and its predictive ability in a wide range of parameters. It also suggests that the model based on ANN is a powerful tool for optimizing this kind of complex process. Fig. 4a, d, and e, also represents the effect of catalyst loading on the optimum value of the other three independent variables (see Fig. S3 for more clarity). These figures imply that the catalyst loading has no effect on the optimum value of glycerol%, as the maximum amount of hydrogen is produced at 50% glycerol for all the catalyst loadings. However, by increasing the catalyst loading from 0.05 to 5g/L, the optimum Pt% decreases from 5% to 3.9%. The reason for this observation could be due to the fact that at high catalyst loadings sufficient platinum particles are accessible to play the role of reaction site, and excessive Pt% makes a barrier against absorption of light by semiconductor and also prevents facile access of substrates to the semiconductor surface [64]. In addition, by increasing catalyst loading from 0.05 to 5g/L, the optimum value of pH decreases from 5.7 to 3.5. This decrease could be attributed to supply of more reaction sites at higher catalyst loading, to convert higher concentration of hydronium ions (which are available at lower pH values) to hydrogen [65]. 3.4.3 Pt% It can be observed from Fig. 4b, d and f that hydrogen production hit a peak around 3–4% of platinum. The amount of produced hydrogen could increase up to 2.1 fold by the optimization of Pt%. As platinum plays the role of a photo-generated electron trap, it improves the charge separation of electron-hole and decreases the rate of recombination [66]. Thus, the amount of produced hydrogen is enhanced by increasing Pt% due to higher accessibility of platinum surface sites. Notwithstanding this, after the optimum point, addition of more platinum decreases the rate of photocatalytic reaction due to some issues such as light shielding and impeding access of substrate to semiconductor surface [64]. Observation of optimum values of co-catalyst agrees with previous research. For Pt-decorated TiO2, optimum percentages of 2 [7] and 2.1 [67] were reported. In addition, in the case of using glycerol as hydrogen source, 1 [38], 2 [37] and 2.5 [24] percent of co-catalyst were obtained as optimum. The influence of Pt% on the optimum value of the other three parameters could be discussed using Fig. 4b, d and f (see also Fig. S4). These figures suggest that Pt% has insignificant effects on the optimum values of glycerol%, catalyst loading, and pH which are around 50%, 4g/L and 5, respectively. 3.4.4 pH By analyzing Fig. 4c, d and f, it can be found that the amount of produced hydrogen could be enhanced up to 3.5 times by pH optimization. Moreover, these figures show that by changing pH from highly acidic solution to around 5, the amount of produced hydrogen increases; however, further growth of pH toward basic decreases the amount of produced hydrogen. Glycerol is adsorbed through hydrogen bonding with the surface hydroxyl groups of the photocatalyst (which are in the form of TiOH) [68]. The surface charge of the photocatalyst is neutral and glycerol could be adsorbed more conveniently around the point of zero charge (pH of 6.25 for P25 [10]). However, acidic solution causes agglomeration of P25 particles. On the other hand, in caustic solution, higher concentration of OH bonding leads to UV screening of photocatalyst [10]. Fig. 4c, d, and f, as well as Fig. S5 clarify the effect of pH on the optimum values of other operating parameters. Based on these figures, pH does not affect the optimum value of glycerol%. Conversely, decreasing pH from 12 to 5 shifts the optimum value of catalyst loading and Pt% respectively from 3.8 to 4.15g/L and 3.1–5%. Variations of optimum catalyst loading and Pt% in different pH values could be attributed to the fact that a portion of surface active sites are not accessible in catalyst particles which agglomerate due to acidic pH [69]; thus, more catalyst loading or platinum is required to provide the necessary reaction sites. Furthermore, pH affects the electrokinetic potential of platinum particles and changes its capacity to trap photo-generated electrons and its adsorption of hydronium ions [65]."
12,Overall optimization using GA,"3.5 Overall optimization using GA To find the maximum value of produced hydrogen and associated optimum operating parameters, the obtained ANN model was utilized as the fitness function in the optimization procedure based on GA. In the GA method, the population of the individual solutions was modified iteratively and the ANN model was employed to find the best generation in each iteration. Then the chosen generation was utilized to produce the next generation by reproduction, mutation and crossover (more detail about GA procedure can be found in [70]). The optimized values of hydrogen production and four operating parameters based on GA are summarized in Table 5 . The optimum values of glycerol%, catalyst loading, Pt%, and pH were found to be respectively 50%, 3.9g/L, 3.1%, and 4.5. The ANN model predicted that 311μmol of hydrogen will be produced in optimum conditions achieved by GA, which is very close to the 321μmol obtained by experiments in these conditions and consequently, it confirms the accuracy of the model (see Table 5). Moreover, experimental data of the rate of produced hydrogen during 4h in optimum conditions is represented in Fig. 5 . As can be seen, the amount of produced hydrogen increased exponentially during the experiment."
13,Relative importance of the operating parameters,"3.6 Relative importance of the operating parameters Garson’s method (which uses the neural network weights matrix) was utilized to obtain the level of influence of each input variable on the response. Table S1 shows the connection weight values (neural network weights matrix) for the developed model. The relative importance of input variables computed by Eq. (8) is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The results indicate that glycerol% and catalyst loading are, respectively, the least and most influential operating parameters with 9% and 36% effect on the amount of produced hydrogen. Moreover, the importance of Pt% and pH are approximately the same. This observation reveals that the amount of produced hydrogen is not significantly affected by the concentration of the glycerol, as this parameter does not control the reaction rate. On the other hand, the highest dependency of the amount of produced hydrogen to catalyst loading shows that the photocatalytic phenomenon is the main route for hydrogen production. This observation is in accordance with the 8.1 times enhancement of the amount of produced hydrogen by optimization of catalyst loading as represented in Fig. 4."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, we investigated the interaction effects of key operating parameters in the photocatalytic glycerol valorization to hydrogen process using Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst. Four operating parameters of glycerol%, catalyst loading, Pt%, and pH were selected as independent variables, and the value of produced hydrogen was considered as the response. The experiments were performed based on Box-Behnken experimental design. Two techniques of RSM and ANN were employed to model the process, and the obtained experimental data were utilized to train the models. Afterward, the optimization and predictive ability of these models were compared based on R2 , R2 adj , RMS, MAE and AAD. This comparison revealed that the ANN-based model is more accurate and reliable; thus it was employed for the optimization and parametric investigation. Optimization of the ANN model was performed by the GA approach and it was found that the highest amount of hydrogen could be produced at the condition of 50% glycerol (v/v), 3.9g/L catalyst loading, 3.1% Pt, and pH of 4.5. Garson’s method was employed to obtain the relative importance of each operating parameter in the response. This analysis revealed that glycerol% and catalyst loading are, respectively, the least and most influential parameters on the amount of produced hydrogen. Moreover, analysis of the effect of operating parameters showed that, in addition to affecting the amount of produced hydrogen, they could affect the optimum values of other parameters. Briefly, interaction effect analysis of the results showed that: • Increasing glycerol% shifts the optimum value of catalyst loading, Pt% and pH to higher values. • Catalyst loading has no effect on the optimum value of glycerol%; however, the optimum values of Pt% and pH decrease by increasing catalyst load. • Pt% has insignificant effects on the optimum values of glycerol%, catalyst loading, and pH. • pH does not affect the optimum value of glycerol%; however, decreasing pH shifts the optimum catalyst loading and Pt% to higher values."
