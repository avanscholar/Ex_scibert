0,Introduction,"Although the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are still not fully understood, accumulating studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a crucial role in the development of ALD. Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxemia, in conjunction with impaired gut integrity, may be one of the mechanisms for activating proinflammatory pathways leading to ALD [1]. Significantly increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were found in ALD patients at different stages [2–4] and in experimental animal models of ALD [5–7]. LPS stimulates hepatic Kupffer cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in reactive oxygen species and ultimately leading to a vicious positive feedback loop that perpetuates liver inflammation. LPS induces tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) production by hepatic Kupffer cells via pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Nine human TLRs have been identified [8]; each recognizes specific patterns of ligands in the microbial components. Among them, TLR4, which has been well defined, recognizes gram-negative bacteria-produced LPS. TLR1, 2 and 6 recognize microbial lipopeptides, while TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 bind to either single- or double-stranded RNA or bacterial or viral DNA. TLR5 is the mammalian receptor for flagellin, the structural component of flagellar filament in various bacteria. The binding of endotoxin by TLR4 and TLR5 leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB), resulting in the production of proinflammatory mediators such as TNFα. There is as yet no FDA-approved drug for ALD. Other than abstinence, liver transplantation is the only choice for end-stage ALD treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of ALD may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Clinical and experimental animal studies suggest the beneficial effects of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of ALD [6,7,9,10]. A recent report from our laboratory shows that oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) attenuates established alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and liver injury in a mouse model of ALD [7]. Indeed, probiotics change the gut microbiota profile and thereby alter the gut lumen, favoring an anti-inflammatory milieu; such changes result in decreased production of proinflammatory bacterial products and improved barrier integrity leading to a decreased endotoxin release and liver protection. Although the effects of LGG on intestine gene expression have been studied in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model [11], the protective effects of LGG in ALD are associated with mucus layer protection by up-regulation of multiple mucus layer inducers and stabilizers, such as intestinal trefoil factor, which depends on hypoxia-inducible factor activation. The aim of present study was to further explore the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of LGG against ALD. Specifically, we investigated the effects of LGG on TLR activation and hepatic inflammation in a mouse model of ALD, and the effects of LGG culture supernatant (LGG-s) on LPS and flagellin-induced TLR activation in vitro using macrophages. We showed that LGG inhibited TLR activation leading to the attenuation of proinflammatory TNFα production via p38 MAPK pathway."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Animal model,"2.1 Animal model Male C57BL/6N mice were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Mice were pair-fed liquid diets (Lieber DeCarli) containing either alcohol (alcohol-fed, AF) or isocaloric maltose–dextrin (pair-fed, PF), as described previously [7]. LGG (109 CFU/mouse/day) was added to the diet in the last 2 weeks of the experiment. Mice were maintained on the treatments for a total of 8weeks. Liver samples were collected and fixed in formalin for histology study or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°C for later use. All mice were treated according to the protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville."
3,Liver histology,2.2 Liver histology Formalin-fixed paraffin tissue sections were processed for staining with hematoxylin and eosin and then studied by light microscopy.
4,Liver TNFα levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay,"2.3 Liver TNFα levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay Liver samples were homogenized (50mg/ml) in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50mM Tris·HCl, pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 4mM Na3VO4, 40mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail). TNFα levels were measured using the Infinity Assay Kit (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For hepatic MPO activity assay, liver samples were homogenized (50mg/ml) in 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in 10mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid and centrifuged at 15,000g for 40min. The suspension was then sonicated three times, each for 30s with an interval of 30s. An aliquot of supernatant was mixed with a solution of 1.6mM tetramethylbenzidine and 1mM hydrogen peroxide. Activity was measured spectrophotometrically as the change in A 650 at 37°C with a Spectramax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Biotek). Results are expressed as milliunits of MPO activity per milligram of protein, as determined by the Bradford assay."
5,Cell culture and treatment,"2.4 Cell culture and treatment Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Monocyte-derived macrophages were generated as previously described [12,13]. In brief, peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), obtained from healthy donors as described previously [14], were washed twice with saline and suspended in RPMI 1640 buffer supplemented with 5% heat-activated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.01M HEPES and 50μg/ml gentamicin (R5). PBMCs were plated in Costar six-well plates and allowed to mature for 4days. After the maturation period, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% FBS and resuspended at 5×106/ml in R5. PBMC-derived macrophages were treated with 25mM ethanol for 3days with and without the addition of LGG-s derived from 109 CFU/ml bacteria at three concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2μl/ml. After incubation with flagellin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 100mg/ml) or LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, 100ng/ml) for 4h, the cells were harvested."
6,Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay,"2.5 Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay The mRNA levels of TNFα, Cyp2E1 and TLRs were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. In brief, the total RNA was isolated with Trizol according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed using GenAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of forward and reverse primers are listed in Table 1 . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), and SYBR green PCR Master Mix was used. The relative quantities of target transcripts were calculated from duplicate samples after normalization to β-actin. Relative mRNA expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt method."
7,Immunoblotting analysis,"2.6 Immunoblotting analysis Tissues and cultured cells were homogenized, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described [7]. Membranes were probed using antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) against Nrf2, phospho-p38 and total-p38, and Cyp2E1. β-Actin was probed as a loading control. The protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and quantified by densitometry analysis."
8,Statistics,2.7 Statistics All data are expressed as mean±S.E.M. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Newman–Keuls multiple-comparison test. Differences between groups were considered significant at P <.05.
9,Results,"Previously, we showed that LGG supplementation attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis [7]. Here, we demonstrated that LGG supplementation reduced alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation. The hepatic MPO activity was significantly higher in alcohol-fed animals compared with pair-fed controls, indicating an increased liver inflammation by alcohol exposure. The alcohol-increased MPO activity was completely abolished by LGG supplementation (Fig. 1A). Likewise, the protein level of the hepatic inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, was significantly increased by alcohol exposure, and this increase was abolished by LGG supplementation (Fig. 1B). Alcohol exposure markedly up-regulated the mRNA level of TNFα by 15-fold, and again, this effect was completely prevented by LGG supplementation (Fig. 1C). Histological measurement showed that alcohol exposure significantly increased, and LGG supplementation decreased, hepatic fat and inflammatory foci accumulation (Fig. 1D). CYP2E1 plays an important role in the alcohol-mediated oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and peroxidation in the development of ALD. Numerous studies have demonstrated that hepatic levels of CYP2E1 are significantly increased during alcohol intoxication [15–17]. Therefore, we determined CYP2E1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Alcohol feeding significantly increased CYP2E1 mRNA expression, which was normalized by LGG supplementation (Fig. 2A). Western blotting revealed a similar increase in protein level of CYP2E1 by alcohol and attenuation by LGG supplementation (Fig. 2B). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is critical in cellular antioxidative defenses. To evaluate the effects of LGG on alcohol-induced hepatic oxidative stress, Nrf2 protein expression was determined. Eight weeks of alcohol feeding caused a significant decrease in Nrf2 protein expression, and LGG supplementation increased the Nrf2 protein levels (Fig. 2C), indicating an effect of LGG on antioxidant defense. TLRs are critically involved in the activation of adapted immune response to various pathogens including alcohol. The resting liver usually expresses low levels of TLRs, possibly in order to reduce the hepatic response to the intestine-derived endotoxin [18]. Overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines due to chronic stimulation of TLRs may lead to liver disease [18]. Measurement of the TLR mRNA levels revealed that alcohol exposure induced an increase in TLR4 and TLR5, which recognize gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxin LPS and flagellin, respectively. Importantly, LGG supplementation attenuated the increase of both TLR4 and TLR5 mRNA levels, and this reduction seems more potent for TLR5 (Fig. 3 ). We also observed an up-regulation of TLR1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 mRNA levels by chronic alcohol ingestion as previously described [15] and an attenuation by LGG supplementation (data not shown). In particular, TLR4 is the most studied TLR in ALD. TLR4 knockout mice showed decreased hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and significantly reduced liver triglyceride, TNFα and interleukin-6 serum levels after chronic alcohol feeding [19,20], suggesting a key role for TLR4-mediated signals in ALD. TLR5 is another important TLR in the innate immune response, which specifically binds its ligand flagellin produced by gram-negative bacteria in the intestine. To determine the effects of alcohol and LGG on bacterial LPS and flagellin-induced inflammatory cytokine regulation, human PBMC-derived macrophages, which express both TLR4 and TLR5, were exposed to alcohol and LGG-s, and challenged by LPS and flagellin. Median levels of TNFα were measured. Ethanol exposure did not induce significant TNFα production compared to control but significantly augmented LPS and flagellin-induced TNFα expression. Pretreatment with LGG-s alone had no effect of TNFα production but significantly reduced ethanol primed and LPS- or flagellin-induced production of TNFα in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 ). Taken together, ethanol exposure primed PBMC-derived macrophages and enhanced the effects of LPS and flagellin on TNFα production, which was attenuated by LGG-s pretreatment. Endotoxin/TLR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role in the stimulation of downstream signaling leading to activation of MAP kinases and NFκB during chronic alcohol exposure. There was no significant change in the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase by 3-day ethanol or LGG-s exposure in PBMC-derived macrophages, while 4-h exposure of LPS induced a marked activation of p38 by 20-fold. Ethanol preexposure further increased LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 and decreased total p38 MAPK protein levels. Importantly, LGG-s pretreatment prevented the ethanol-primed and LPS-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5 )."
10,Discussion,"Our earlier studies demonstrated that LGG treatment attenuated chronic alcohol-induced liver steatosis and injury, which was associated with the improvement of intestinal barrier function and decreased endotoxemia [7]. ALD is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is considered to be due to elevated inflammatory activators, such as LPS derived from gram-negative bacteria in the gut. However, alcohol-mediated liver injury cannot be mimicked by chronic low-dose LPS in the absence of ethanol [21]. Numerous studies have indicated that chronic alcohol administration seems to prime the inflammatory cell activation. Our previous work [22] demonstrated that PBMCs from patients with alcoholic hepatitis produce more proinflammatory mediators, such as TNFα, in response to LPS. Hence, the effects of LGG supplementation on TNF production in response to chronic alcohol feeding in vivo and in alcohol-primed macrophages in vitro were examined in the present study. A major finding of this study was that 2 weeks of LGG supplementation attenuated chronic alcohol-induced TNFα production and hepatic inflammation. Moreover, LGG-s markedly reduced LPS-inducible TNFα expression in human PBMC-derived macrophages. Previous studies have shown that probiotics inhibit intestinal epithelial cell inflammatory signaling in experimental colitis models [23–28]. Probiotics may also directly modulate immune cell functions [29]. Normalized neutrophil function [30] and a decrease in systemic inflammation markers caused by LPS in rats [31] have been observed. Here, we showed that LGG ameliorated chronic alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation in mice and that LGG-s attenuated the alcohol-primed and endotoxin-induced TNFα production in macrophages. Increased TNFα expression in response to LPS requires the activation of a set of transcription factors binding to the promoter region of TNFα [32,33]. Activation of TNFα expression in most types of macrophages requires recruitment of NFκB and early growth response 1 [32,33]. One of the mechanisms by which pathogens sensitize cells to LPS-induced liver injury is induction of CYP2E1 [34]. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that alcohol-induced CYP2E1 expression plays an important role in ALD. Activation of CYP2E1 is associated with increased lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatotoxicity [35]. CYP2E1-overexpressing transgenic mice had higher ALT levels and greater liver injury compared with the control mice [36]. Inhibition of CYP2E1 decreased fatty liver, and genetic depletion of CYP2E1 completely inhibited alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. In the current study, we demonstrated that LGG supplementation markedly attenuated the chronic alcohol-induced significant increase of hepatic CYP2E1 expression in both mRNA and protein levels, which correlated with hepatic TNFα production and liver inflammation. On the other hand, activation of CYP2E1 generates ROS during its catalytic cycle. Our recent study has shown that LGG supplementation, indeed, reduced chronic alcohol exposure-induced hepatic superoxide formation [7], which was in agreement with previous studies in a rat model of ALD [9]. ROS-induced oxidative stress is a major contributing factor in alcoholic liver injury. Nrf2 plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant defenses through modulation of several major antioxidant responsive element-dependent antioxidative mechanisms, including NADPH dehydrogenase-quinone-1, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase. Loss of Nrf2 results in a significantly reduced ability to detoxify acetaldehyde, a toxic alcohol metabolite, and hepatic steatosis [37]. Chronic alcohol exposure induces an increase in hepatic Nrf2 expression, which is associated with CYP2E1 induction by alcohol [38]. However, our current study showed a decrease in Nrf2 protein level in the livers of alcohol-exposed mice. This is likely due to the difference in alcohol treatment period. In our study, the chronic alcohol exposure time was 8 weeks, while only 4 weeks of alcohol treatment was applied in the study described by Gong et al. [38]. Nrf2, as a stress-responsive protein, is increased by alcohol to combat alcohol-induced, CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress. However, this is likely a short-term solution. Long-term alcohol exposure may cause the loss of this adaptive ability. Nevertheless, our results, in which LGG supplementation normalized alcohol-induced decrease in Nrf2, indicate that LGG has the potential to suppress alcohol-induced oxidative stress in the liver. Initial studies in our laboratory showed that increased priming of human monocytes and Kupffer cells by alcohol led to exaggerated LPS-induced expression of TNFα [39]. Notably, the current study demonstrated that ethanol pretreatment sensitized both LPS- and flagellin-induced TNFα production in macrophages. Both LPS and flagellin are gram-negative bacterium-derived endotoxins, and are the ligands for TLR4 and TLR5, respectively. Although LPS–TLR4 is the major and well-studied mechanism in ALD, other endotoxins appear to be responsible for some of the pathological changes observed in ALD. Several specific ligands to different TLRs have been tested for the ability to increase TNFα production in alcohol-fed mice [40]. Interestingly, although there was no change in TLR5 mRNA level in response to alcohol, the mice exposed to alcohol were more sensitive to flagellin challenge compared with control mice. The significant increase of hepatic TLR5 by alcohol exposure in our study is likely due to the longer time of exposure to alcohol. Alcohol-induced TLR5 increase may be dependent not only on gut-derived endotoxin but also on the degree of oxidative stress in the liver, as demonstrated by Gustot et al. [40]. The increase in TLR5 was normalized by LGG supplementation, again indicating the potential of LGG to combat oxidative stress in alcohol treated liver. Notably, our in vivo observation was confirmed by in vitro experiments. Our initial experiments using RAW 264.7 cells showed the response only to LPS, but not to flagellin, for TNF production (data not shown). This is due to the murine macrophages expressing TLR4 but not TLR5 [41,42]. However, human PBMC-derived macrophages express both TLR4 and TLR5 [43–45] and therefore will be activated by both LPS and flagellin. This significant attenuation by LGG-s in alcohol-primed, LPS- or flagellin-induced TNFα production suggests that LGG-s may have a potential anti-inflammatory effect through activation of TLRs in response to gut bacteria-derived endotoxins. The MAPK signaling cascade plays an essential role in the initiation of many cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis and inflammation [46]. Recognition of endotoxin, such as LPS and flagellin, by TLRs activates MAPK signaling pathways, resulting in TNFα production. Chronic alcohol exposure increases p38 MAP kinase activity, which contributes to TNFα expression in Kupffer cells, possibly by stabilization of TNFα mRNA via interaction with tristetraprolin [47,48]. Inhibition of p38 activation completely abrogated alcohol exposure-mediated stabilization of TNFα mRNA. Ethanol treatment also induces ERK1/2 signaling, leading to EGR-1 and NFκB transcriptional activation which contributes to the enhanced TNFα transcription [49,50]. However, although the activity of JNK was decreased by chronic alcohol exposure in mice without any effect on TNFα mRNA level, acute alcohol exposure increased JNK phosphorylation and AP-1 binding in monocytes. While ethanol exposure did not affect p38 phosphorylation in PBMC-derived macrophages, LPS treatment increased p-p38, and ethanol pretreatment exaggerated LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38. The discrepancy in MAPK activation by alcohol in various studies may be due to the different treatment time and dose. Chen et al. [51] showed that acute alcohol exposure resulted in an activation of ERK1/2, but ethanol did not modulate agonist-induced activation of ERK1/2 unless hepatocytes were treated with ethanol for at least 16h. Nevertheless, the fact that probiotic supernatant pretreatment significantly reduced alcohol-primed LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 in macrophages implies that LGG-s inhibition of TNFα production is likely via the decrease of p38 MAPK activation. Our recent study [52] demonstrated that the LGG-s has beneficial effects in preventing binge alcohol-induced liver injury. The beneficial effects of probiotic supernatants have been demonstrated in several other pathogenic conditions [27,28,53], and it has been postulated that the secreted factors by probiotics are major contributors of the probiotic beneficial effects. Although several active ingredients have been identified in probiotic supernatant, more studies on the detailed identification of probiotic secreted factors warrant further investigation. In conclusion, this study shows the protective effects of orally administered LGG against alcohol-induced liver inflammation in a mouse model. The molecular mechanisms associated with these protective effects include prevention of alcohol-induced oxidative stress by prevention of the decreased Nrf2 responsiveness, suppression of CYP2E1 expression, inactivation of TLR4 and TLR5, and inhibition of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, leading to decreased NFκB activation and TNFα production."
