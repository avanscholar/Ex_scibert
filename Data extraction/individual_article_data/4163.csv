0,Introduction,"The ethanol content of wine is largely determined by the ripeness, and hence sugar content, of grapes. Market demand for wines containing lower ethanol concentrations (Rowley, 2013) has seen a number of studies into the feasibility of pre- and post-fermentation strategies that reduce the concentration of sugar available for fermentation into ethanol, and reduce the concentration of ethanol in finished wine (Belisario-Sanchez et al., 2009; Bindon et al., 2013; Schmidtke et al., 2012; Stoll et al., 2010; Varela et al., 2015). Ideally, these strategies should reduce ethanol levels without compromising wine flavour, quality, consumer acceptance or increasing the cost of production. Earlier harvest of grapes shows promise for moderate reductions in final ethanol concentration while not impacting on consumer acceptability (Bindon et al., 2014). Substantial decreases in ethanol concentration can be achieved by post-fermentation processes, however these can substantially alter wine volatile composition and sensory profile (Belisario-Sanchez et al., 2009; King and Heymann, 2014) and also impact on consumer preferences (King and Heymann, 2014; Meillon et al., 2010a, b). Using wine yeast to produce wine with reduced alcohol content remains one of the simplest and least expensive approaches for winemakers to employ, and could be used in combination with other strategies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the principal yeast species used in winemaking, is very efficient at producing ethanol from sugars under most environmental conditions, and although some natural variability can be found among wild isolates of this species, existing S. cerevisiae wine strains generate comparable alcohol concentrations when fermenting the same must (Ciani et al., 2016). Research has therefore focused on generating new S. cerevisiae strains that produce less alcohol than traditional wine yeast during fermentation (Ehsani et al., 2009; Kutyna et al., 2010; Tilloy et al., 2014; Varela et al., 2012); and isolating non-conventional yeasts that metabolise sugar without generating ethanol or do so with less efficiency (Ciani et al., 2016; Varela, 2016). Non-conventional yeast, which include non-Saccharomyces and non-cerevisiae yeast, are part of the natural microbiota present on grapes, and harvesting and winemaking equipment, and are present at least during the early stages of fermentation (Fleet and Heard, 1993; Renouf et al., 2006; Renouf and Lonvaud-Funel, 2007). The use of non-conventional yeast is increasingly popular particularly for their effects on wine composition, flavour, aroma and colour (Jolly et al., 2014; Varela, 2016) and for their potential to produce reduced-alcohol wines (Ciani et al., 2016; Varela, 2016). Some of the mechanisms responsible for reduced ethanol yields include altered biomass synthesis, by-product formation and/or alternative regulation of respiration. While some non-Saccharomyces yeast require moderate application of oxygen during fermentation to grow and impact on wine composition (Gonzalez et al., 2013), and indeed to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration (Contreras et al., 2015a; Quiros et al., 2014), Contreras et al. (2014) identified a Metschnikowia pulcherrima strain able to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration when sequentially inoculated with S. cerevisiae without aeration. Furthermore, when studying yeast population dynamics during Shiraz fermentations, an indigenous Saccharomyces uvarum yeast strain, which was also able to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration, was also isolated (Contreras et al., 2015b). When used in combination, these strains of M. pulcherrima and S. uvarum behaved additively, reducing final ethanol concentrations in both white and red wines to a greater extent than either strain alone (Varela et al., 2016). Preliminary data on volatile aroma composition suggested that some treatments may affect the sensory properties of wine. Here we describe the sensory profile and volatile aroma composition of pilot-scale Merlot wines produced with M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 and S. uvarum AWRI2846. While wines fermented with both yeast strains showed reduced ethanol concentration compared to S. cerevisiae wines, volatile and sensory profiles differed substantially between wines produced with non-conventional yeasts. This work shows for the first time the use of amplicon-based ITS phylotyping for validating the role of non-conventional yeasts in pilot-scale wine fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and media,"2.1 Microorganisms and media Saccharomyces cerevisiae AWRI838, Metschnikowia pulcherrima AWRI3050 and Saccharomyces uvarum AWRI2846 were obtained from the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) Wine Microorganism Culture Collection. M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 is a non-flocculant derivative obtained from M. pulcherrima AWRI1149. Briefly, a 80mL sample from the end of fermentation of sterile Shiraz (200mL) was allowed to settle at room temperature for 20min. A 1mL sample was then taken from the top of the settled culture and used to inoculate a flask containing 200mL of sterile Shiraz. After a third selection step, samples from the top of settled cultures were plated and single colonies isolated. Colonies were identified as M. pulcherrima following PCR and RFLP of the 5.8S rRNA gene as described previously (Contreras et al., 2015b). M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 showed no significant differences in wine basic composition to M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 (Table S1). Cryogenically preserved (−80°C) strains were cultured and maintained on YM plates (3g/L malt extract, 3g/L yeast extract, 5g/L peptone, 10g/L glucose, 16g/L agar) and stored at 4°C."
3,Pilot-scale fermentations,"2.2 Pilot-scale fermentations Unlike S. uvarum AWRI2846, M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 is not able to finish wine fermentation unaided and requires co- or sequential- inoculation with S. cerevisiae. Therefore, four treatments were performed to evaluate M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 in Merlot must: a control S. cerevisiae inoculation (AWRI838, 1×106 cells/mL); a M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae co-inoculated ferment (M. pulcherrima 1×106 cells/mL, S. cerevisiae 1×105 cells/mL); a S. uvarum inoculation (1×106 cells/mL); and an uninoculated control fermentation. Merlot must was prepared from grapes obtained from the Riverland region (South Australia) and contained 240g/L of sugar (equal amounts of glucose and fructose), 190mg N/L of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) and 6.2g/L titratable acidity (determined to pH8.2) with a pH of 3.2. Fermentations were performed in triplicate at 22°C in fermentation vessels containing 50kg of randomised grapes and 50mg/kg potassium metabisulfite, which were stored at 10°C overnight. Twenty-four hours before inoculation Merlot must was treated with 125mg/L dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) to reduce the population of native microorganisms. Starter cultures of all yeast strains were grown overnight in YM medium under aerobic conditions at 28°C, shaking at 120rpm. These cultures were then used to inoculate 1L of sterile Merlot, diluted 1:1 with water, in 5L Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks were incubated overnight at 22°C with shaking (120rpm) under aerobic conditions and then used to inoculate Merlot must. Ferments were incubated at 22°C and the solids cap was plunged twice daily. Samples were taken during fermentation to determine yeast populations and basic chemical composition. After sugar was completely consumed Merlot wines were inoculated for malolactic fermentation with Oenococcus oeni (Lalvin VP41, Lallemand) as recommended by the manufacturer."
4,Analytical techniques,"2.3 Analytical techniques Ethanol, glucose, fructose, glycerol and organic acids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a BioRad HPX87H column as described previously (Varela et al., 2004). Analysis of higher alcohols, acetate-, and ethyl esters was performed by Metabolomics Australia (Adelaide) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) using a stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) as previously described (Bizaj et al., 2012). Yeast-derived sulfur-containing volatiles (carbon disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, ethanethiol, ethyl thioacetate, hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol and methyl thioacetate) were determined by using headspace cool-on-column gas chromatography coupled with sulfur chemiluminescence detection (GC-SCD), with ethylmethyl sulfide and propyl thioacetate as internal standards (Siebert et al., 2010). 4-Ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol were analysed according the method of Pollnitz et al. (2000)."
5,Determination of microbial populations,"2.4 Determination of microbial populations Total DNA was isolated from each sample using the PowerFood Microbial DNA isolation kit (Mobio, California, USA). Proportions of each microbial strain were assessed using amplicon-based ITS phylotyping as described previously (Sternes et al., 2017). Briefly, 1.0ng of total DNA from each sample was subjected to a two-step PCR process that amplifies a portion of the fungal ribosomal ITS region (Bokulich and Mills, 2013) while adding both custom in-line barcodes and sequences necessary for Illumina sequencing (including compatible Illumina dual-indexes). Following sequencing, raw reads were first quality and adaptor trimmed (Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014); Cutadapt (Martin, 2011)), with paired-end reads overlapped (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011) to form a single contiguous ITS synthetic read. Reads were then assigned to samples and timepoints using a combination of both the in-line and Illumina barcodes using custom python scripts. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered de novo using Swarm v2.0 (Mahe et al., 2014) and taxonomies assigned using the “assign_taxonomy.py” functionality of QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010) in conjunction with a modified version of the QIIME UNITE fungal ITS database (Sternes et al., 2017). Sequences and lengths for all OUTs identified in this study are included in Table S2. Total DNA was isolated from each sample using the PowerFood Microbial DNA isolation kit (Mobio, California, USA).

Sequences and lengths for all OUTs identified in this study are included in Table S2."
6,Sensory descriptive analysis,"2.5 Sensory descriptive analysis A panel of nine assessors (one male, eight females) with an average age of 46years (SD=10.1) was convened to evaluate the Merlot wines. A consensus-based descriptive methodology was used as described previously (Bindon et al., 2014). Details of the attributes selected by the panel and the reference standards are listed in Table S3. Wines (30mL) were presented to panelists in 3-digit-coded, covered, ISO standard wine glasses at 22–24°C, in isolated booths under daylight-type lighting, with randomised presentation order. All samples were expectorated. Twelve wines were assessed, comprising each of the four treatments. Wines were evaluated in triplicate in three formal sessions that were held on different days. All samples were presented in a modified Williams Latin Square incomplete random block design generated by Fizz sensory acquisition software (version 2.46, Biosystemes, Couternon, France). Wines were assessed in sets of three wines and assessors were forced to have a 30s rest between samples and a minimum ten-minute rest between trays. Each presentation replicate was poured from a separate bottle. The intensity of each attribute was rated using an unstructured 15cm line scale numbered from 0 to 10, with indented anchor points of ‘low’ and ‘high’ placed at 10% and 90% respectively. Data was acquired using Fizz sensory software. Panel performance was assessed using Fizz, Senstools (OP&P, The Netherlands) and PanelCheck (Matforsk) software. Sensory attributes used by the panel and their significance are listed in Table S4."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Differences between measurements were determined using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test with the software GraphPad Prism v6.03. For sensory data ANOVA and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test were carried out using Minitab (Minitab Inc., Sydney, NSW). The effects of yeast strain, judge, fermentation replicate nested in yeast, presentation replicate nested in yeast and fermentation replicate as well as the interactions between judge and yeast, and between judge and fermentation replicate nested in yeast were assessed. Differences were considered significant when p values were lower than 0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) using Unscrambler×10.3 (CAMO ASA, Oslo, Norway) was carried out for reducing the dimensionality of data and for finding the best differentiation among samples."
8,Results,"It had previously been shown at laboratory scale that the two non-conventional yeast strains, M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846, produced wines containing less ethanol than those using with S. cerevisiae (Varela et al., 2016). However, M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 flocculates in red grape must (data not shown) making quantification of cell density difficult and potentially affecting fermentation kinetics in absence of agitation, e.g. pilot-scale or industrial scale fermentations. To avoid these issues M. pulcherrima AWRI3050, a non-flocculant derivative of AWRI1149, was isolated and used in this study. Shiraz wines fermented sequentially with M. pulcherrima AWR3050 and S. cerevisiae showed the same basic chemical composition than wines produced with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149/S. cerevisiae (Table S1). Four treatments were carried out to evaluate wine flavour profile in Merlot wines inoculated with either S. cerevisiae, M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae or S. uvarum, in addition to an uninoculated control fermentation, where the indigenous microflora is the primary driver of fermentation."
9,Sugar consumption and yeast population dynamics during wine fermentation,"3.1 Sugar consumption and yeast population dynamics during wine fermentation Fermentations inoculated with S. cerevisiae and M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae showed similar sugar consumption kinetics and completed alcoholic fermentation in 11days (Fig. 1 ). Ferments inoculated with S. uvarum showed comparable sugar utilisation kinetics to S. cerevisiae fermentations up to day 5, and after this period they slowed significantly and subsequently required an additional four days to complete fermentation. Uninoculated fermentations exhibited the slowest sugar utilisation kinetics during the first third of the fermentation, which is likely due to the reduction in total native microorganisms due to DMDC treatment of the must. However, after day 5, sugar consumption increased and all ferments completed alcoholic fermentation in 15days (Fig. 1). All ferments showed similar microbial population composition immediately after inoculation (day 0), with the genera Aureobasidium, Metschnikowia and Penicillium in high abundance and the genera Botrytis, Hanseniaspora, Cryptococcus and Davidiella in minor proportions (Fig. 2 ). However, subsequent yeast population dynamics were markedly different and displayed a clear relationship to the inoculation treatment. In addition to the genera present in all ferments, fermentations inoculated with S. cerevisiae showed high abundance for this species immediately after inoculation (Fig. 2). Two days later, S. cerevisiae dominated yeast populations in two of the three fermentation replicates and from day 3 to the end of fermentation this species dominated all fermentation replicates. Two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were observed for the genus Metschnikowia, the second of these OTUs was only found in the ferments co-inoculated with M. pulcherrima and S. cerevisiae, such that this OTU was assigned to M. pulcherrima AWRI3050. After inoculation, the M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae ferments showed high abundances for the species M. pulcherrima and S. cerevisiae in addition to the genera found in the uninoculated controls (Fig. 2). M. pulcherrima populations decreased considerably after two days with S. cerevisiae dominating all fermentation replicates from this time point to the end of fermentation. Ferments inoculated with S. uvarum contained minor proportions of this species after inoculation (Fig. 2). These proportions increased in all fermentation replicates two days later and then dominated yeast populations from day 3 to the end of fermentation. Uninoculated fermentations exhibited similar yeast population composition during the first two days in all fermentation replicates. After three days S. cerevisiae increased in proportion and then dominated fermentation from day 5 until all sugar was consumed."
10,Wine chemical and volatile composition,"3.2 Wine chemical and volatile composition All treatments resulted in reduced ethanol concentration relative to wines made with S. cerevisiae. Wines fermented with M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae had 1.0% v/v lower ethanol concentration, while wines produced with S. uvarum and uninoculated wines were 1.7% v/v and 0.7% v/v lower, respectively (Table 1 ). Although significantly different, there were minimal residual sugar concentration differences between treatments. Compared to S. cerevisiae wines all treatments had higher concentrations of glycerol and succinic acid with the highest concentrations found in wines produced with S. uvarum. The concentration of acetic acid was lowest for S. uvarum wines, while malic acid concentration was not significantly different between treatments, as a result of performing malolactic fermentation. Although titratable acidity was higher for all treatments when compared to S. cerevisiae wines, wines produced with S. uvarum had the highest concentration and the lowest pH values of the wines (Table 1). Major differences in the concentration of volatile compounds were also found among treatments. While ethyl acetate concentrations were highest in the wines produced with M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae, in addition to the uninoculated ferments, the total concentration of esters (excluding ethyl acetate) was significantly different only for M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae wines (Table 1). The latter result was mainly driven by the higher concentrations of 2-methylbutyl acetate found in M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae wines compared to the other treatments. All treatments showed increased concentrations of higher alcohols than the S. cerevisiae wines and particularly in 2-methyl propanol and 2&3-methyl butanol. Wines produced with S. uvarum had the highest total concentration of higher alcohols. Uninoculated ferments showed the highest total concentration of sulfur compounds, with total levels eighteen times higher than the control S. cerevisiae wines being recorded. Wines produced with M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae had five times higher total concentration of sulfur compounds than S. cerevisiae wines. The high total concentration of sulfur compounds observed in both the M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae and uninoculated wines was the result of increased concentrations of dimethyl sulfide, ethanethiol, hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol (Table 1). The concentrations of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol were below the detection threshold (<10μg/L) for all wines. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualise the differences in volatile composition among treatments and to identify the volatile fermentation products that provided greatest discrimination between treatments (Fig. 3 ). The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 57% of the total variation, while PC2 explained a further 23%. Wines clustered tightly according to inoculation treatment. Wines made by inoculation with S. cerevisiae had higher concentration of the ethyl esters, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate, whereas wines co-inoculated with M. pulcherrima and S. cerevisiae were higher in carbon disulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide and hexyl acetate. Uninoculated wines exhibited a relatively high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and clustered closely with M. pulcherrima wines. Wines produced with S. uvarum were markedly different from the other samples and were characterised by higher concentrations of branched chain esters (ethyl-2-methyl propanoate, ethyl-2-methyl butanoate, ethyl-3-methyl butanoate), in addition to the higher alcohols butanol and 2&3-methyl butanol."
11,Sensory analysis of reduced alcohol wines,"3.3 Sensory analysis of reduced alcohol wines In addition to possessing distinct chemical profiles, differences in appearance, aroma and flavour were also found between treatments (Fig. 4 ). The M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae and uninoculated wines were found to have similar sensory profiles, not differing significantly in any attribute, and together were characterised by relatively high scores for the sensory attributes ‘purple tint’, ‘overall fruit aroma’, ‘overall fruit flavour’, ‘red fruit aroma’, and ‘red fruit flavour’; and relatively low scores for the attributes ‘brown tint’, ‘vegetal aroma’, ‘meat aroma’ and ‘barnyard aroma’. The control wines produced with S. cerevisiae alone were similar to the M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae and uninoculated wines, but were rated significantly higher in ‘brown tint’ and significantly lower in ‘red fruit aroma’. As was observed for the chemical analyses, the wines produced using S. uvarum showed the most distinct sensory profiles, driven by high ratings for ‘cloudiness’, ‘brown tint’, ‘vegetal aroma’, ‘meat aroma’ and ‘barnyard aroma’; and low in ‘purple tint’, ‘overall fruit aroma’, ‘mint aroma’ and ‘red fruit aroma’."
12,Discussion,"The work described here extends previous research that investigated the use of non-conventional yeasts to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration (Contreras et al., 2015b; Contreras et al., 2014; Varela et al., 2016). We have previously shown that M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 produced reduced-alcohol Chardonnay and Shiraz wines at laboratory scale (Varela et al., 2016). The volatile aroma composition of those wines differed significantly from one another, suggesting that the non-Saccharomyces yeasts used may affect wine sensory properties. In fact, this has been observed in different grape varieties and with different non-Saccharomyces species (Benito et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Royo et al., 2015). In this study, we sought to determine whether a non-flocculant derivative of AWRI1149, M. pulcherrima AWRI3050, and S. uvarum AWRI2846 could produce lower-ethanol wine at pilot-scale, and to what extent the wines they produced were sensorially different from wine fermented with S. cerevisiae. Since we have previously observed some degree of inhibition of M. pulcherrima growth by other microorganisms such as H. uvarum, T. delbrueckii and/or P. kluyveri (Contreras et al., 2015b), Merlot must was treated with dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) to inhibit the native microbiota (Delfini et al., 2002). Thus, uninoculated fermentations showed the slowest sugar utilisation kinetics particularly during the first four days of fermentation, indicating a successful inhibition of native microorganisms as a result of DMDC addition. After DMDC treatment (day 0), the genera Aureobasidium, Metschnikowia, Penicillium, Botrytis, Hanseniaspora, Cryptococcus and Davidiella, which have been found associated with vines and grapes (Bokulich et al., 2014; Morrison-Whittle and Goddard, 2015; Taylor et al., 2014), and/or during wine fermentation (Fleet et al., 2002; Heard, 1999; Romano et al., 2003), dominated microbial populations. For the first time we have shown the use of amplicon-based ITS phylotyping for validating the persistence of non-conventional yeasts during pilot-scale wine fermentation. For all ferments there was a clear relationship between fermentation kinetics and yeast population dynamics, specifically the point at which Saccharomyces spp. became dominant. Thus, sugar utilisation in uninoculated ferments increased from day 5 when S. cerevisiae dominated yeast populations. S. cerevisiae and M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae ferments showed the fastest fermentation kinetics. The fast sugar utilisation kinetics observed for M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae fermentations correlated with the dominance of S. cerevisiae during fermentation. One of the two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed for the genus Metschnikowia was only found in the ferments inoculated with M. pulcherrima AWRI3050, enabling the identification of this species from the native Metschnikowia population. Thus, at inoculation M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 dominated these ferments. In contrast to other fermentations, S. uvarum ferments were dominated by this species and not by S. cerevisiae, confirming the ability of this species to complete wine fermentation as observed previously in Chardonnay and Shiraz (Varela et al., 2016), and in Riesling (Ultee et al., 2013). Wines fermented with M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 contained 1.0% v/v less ethanol than S. cerevisiae wines, whereas wines fermented with S. uvarum AWRI2846 were 1.7% v/v lower than control wines. In addition to ethanol yield and fermentation kinetics, it is fundamental to establish the effect of yeast on wine flavour and aroma to determine if a ‘low-ethanol’ wine yeast might be suitable for commercial winemaking. While non-conventional wine yeast can impart novel and desirable characters to wine they can also produce metabolites that impact negatively on wine flavour profiles (Magyar and Toth, 2011; Rojas et al., 2001; Viana et al., 2008). Wines produced with different yeast strains in the present study showed significant differences in the concentration of key volatile compounds, particularly noteworthy the increased concentrations of ethyl acetate, total esters, total higher alcohols and total sulfur compounds found in M. pulcherrima wines. This yeast species is known to produce high concentrations of esters during wine fermentation (Bisson and Kunkee, 1991; Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004; Rodriguez et al., 2010; Sadoudi et al., 2012) and it has also been described as able to release important quantities of the thiol 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH) from its precursor during Sauvignon Blanc fermentation (Zott et al., 2011). However, M. pulcherrima production of other sulfur-containing volatile compounds has not been reported previously. The distinctive volatile composition profiles observed among ferments resulted in wines clustered tightly according to inoculation treatment after principal component analysis. Interestingly, although S. cerevisiae dominated most of the fermentation for the M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae wines, these wines were most similar to uninoculated ferments, whereas wines inoculated with S. cerevisiae alone and wines produced with S. uvarum clustered separately and away from the other wines. This indicates that the different yeast population dynamics observed during fermentation generated wines with characteristic volatile compositional profiles. Consequently, sensory profiles were similar between M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae and uninoculated ferments, while wines fermented with either S. cerevisiae or S. uvarum exhibited distinctly different sensory profiles. M. pulcherrima and uninoculated wines showed high scores for sensory descriptors that most would consider positive and desirable, and low scores for negative sensory attributes, despite relatively high concentrations of ethyl acetate and total sulfur-containing compounds. Although these compounds are usually associated with negative sensory descriptors, they can impart positive attributes or add complexity to wine aroma at low concentrations (Amerine and Roessler, 1983; Escudero et al., 2007; Jackson, 2009; Siebert et al., 2009; Spedding and Raut, 1982). Uninoculated ferments are not necessarily associated with negative sensory attributes and/or off-flavours (Dillon et al., 2013), and in fact, spontaneous fermentation has been shown to increase some ‘fruity’ and ‘fresh green’ sensory attributes and enhance flavour diversity in Chardonnay wines (Medina et al., 2013). Similarly, there are several studies describing the impact of M. pulcherrima on wine quality scores and wine sensory profile. When compared to control S. cerevisiae, wines produced with M. pulcherrima have shown increased quality scores in Sauvignon blanc and Chenin blanc (Jolly et al., 2003), and in Muscat d'Alexandrie (Rodriguez et al., 2010). M. pulcherrima has also been shown to increase wine flavour and aroma in Debina wines (Parapouli et al., 2010), and/or enhance positive sensory attributes, such as ‘citrus/grape fruit’, ‘pear’ and ‘flowery’ in Riesling (Benito et al., 2015) and in base wine for sparkling wine production (Gonzalez-Royo et al., 2015). Only one report has shown a negative impact of M. pulcherrima, decreasing quality scores in a Chardonnay wine compared to control S. cerevisiae wines, the opposite found in Sauvignon blanc and Chenin blanc with the same strain (Jolly et al., 2003). This could indicate a potential influence of grape variety over M. pulcherrima metabolism and therefore, on wine sensory profile. In contrast, wines fermented with S. uvarum showed a sensory profile mostly dominated by unusual and negative sensory attributes that would conventionally be consider off-flavours. Interestingly, 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol the most common volatile compounds associated with the attribute ‘barnyard’ were not detected in any of the wines, indicating that other compounds are responsible for the high rating of this sensory attribute for S. uvarum wines. In the literature, the effect of S. uvarum on wine sensory profiles include decreasing ‘fruity’ and ‘citrus’ attributes and increasing characters such as ‘nutty’ and ‘aldehyde’ in Chardonnay wines (Eglinton et al., 2000); decreasing colour in Shiraz wines (Holt et al., 2013); and also enhancing sensory scores for desirable attributes in Malvasia delle Lipari wines (Muratore et al., 2007). Although results presented here and in literature reports suggest a negative role of S. uvarum on wine sensory profile, unusual characters can be pursued in certain wine varieties particularly for increasing wine complexity, i.e. using wine with these characters as blending material. Before evaluating strategies to improve the sensorial characteristics of S. uvarum AWRI2846 it is necessary to investigate the sensory profile of wines from different grape varieties fermented with this strain, and to acknowledge that this study comprises a single proof-of-concept trial in one Merlot must. Previous studies with white (King and Heymann, 2014) and red wines (Bindon et al., 2014; Casassa et al., 2013) have shown a correlation between ethanol concentration and the sensory attributes ‘hotness’ and ‘viscosity’. Interestingly, there was no significant differences for these attributes among wines in this study. It is possible that the increased concentration of higher alcohols found in wines produced with M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae, S. uvarum and without inoculation could influence the sensory perception of this attribute. Similarly, the increased glycerol concentrations found in the wines mentioned above could have had an effect on the perception of ‘viscosity’. In summary, the work described in this paper shows that reduced-alcohol wines produced with M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 resulted in high scores for desirable sensory descriptors and low scores for negative attributes. In contrast, reduced-alcohol wines produced with S. uvarum AWRI2846 were characterised by unusual and negative sensory attributes. This work thus demonstrates the successful application of M. pulcherrima AWRI3050 for the production of pilot-scale Merlot wines with reduced alcohol concentration and good quality sensory profile.
