0,Introduction,"The growing emergence of energy crises as well as the environmental problems have aroused the worldwide to pay attention to the development of renewable resources to replace the diminishing fossil resources [1,2]. Biomass is widely considered to be one of the most important renewable resources, which can provide value-added chemicals, fuels and materials for our society [3–5]. The production of chemicals and fuels from biomass has recently attracted much attention from scientists and engineers in recent years. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is well recognized as a key platform intermediate for upgrading renewable lignocellulosic biomass into useful chemicals and biofuels [6,7]. One of the important transformations of HMF is its oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) [8,9]. Because of the similar structure of FDCA and fossil fuel derived terephthalic acid, FDCA can serve as an alternative monomer for the generation of bio-derived polymers. For example, polyethylene furanoate (PEF), consisting of ethylene glycol and FDCA, exhibits better physical properties, and it has higher glass transition temperature and gas impermeability than the fossil fuel-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer [10,11]. Additionally, PEF is much more bio-compatible, and can be enzymatically hydrolyzed at a faster rate than that of the common PET films [12,13]. Hence, the oxidation of HMF into FDCA has been extensively studied in recent years over different catalytic systems, and some catalytic systems can produce FDCA with high yields. For example, our group has successfully realized the photocatalytic oxidation of HMF into FDCA at room temperature in the air over the non-noble cobalt catalyst [14]. Despite the significant progress in FDCA production, the oxidation of HMF into FDCA has limited its direct application in the industry because of the following reasons [15]. On the one hand, FDCA with two carboxylic groups connected with furan rings shows a limited solubility in most solvents. On the other hand, the oxidation reactions of HMF into FDCA were almost performed in the aqueous solution with the use of excessive base. Therefore, the acidic treatment of the reaction mixture as well as the product purification is cumbersome, and quantitative isolation in high purity for further polymerization has been proven difficult [16]. In contrast to FDCA, furan-2,5-dimethylcarboxylate (FDMC) is soluble in most common solvents, and it is also much easier to get high purity after reaction. Hence, FDMC would be more suitable for polymerization industry via trans-esterification reaction [15]. Typically, catalytic transformation of HMF into FDMC involves the initial oxidation of the alcohol group into aldehyde group in methanol, and followed by oxidative esterification of the two aldehydes into esters in one-pot. The oxidative esterification is one of the important and common organic transformations, and it has been well studied in the past decades [17,18]. However, the oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC has been rarely studied, because of the special structure of FDCA [19]. Generally, noble metal catalysts demonstrated higher catalytic activity than the non-noble metal catalysts for the oxidative esterification reactions. Supported Au, AuPd, and PdCoBi catalysts have been developed for the oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC [20–26]. The high cost of noble metal catalysts as well as the use of the base as the additives make these processes less economic and environmentally-friendly. For the sustainable manufacturing of chemicals from biomass, exploring high-performance non-noble metal catalysts is an important emerging goal, owing to their low cost, abundance in nature and favorableness for industrial application. Due to the intrinsic low activity of the non-noble metal catalysts, it is a great challenge to develop effective non-noble metal catalytic systems for the oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC. For example, Xu and co-workers established the use of binary catalysts for the oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC at 100 °C under 0.6 MPa O2 in methanol [27]. In their catalytic systems, α-MnO2 was first used to catalyze the oxidation of HMF into DFF, and then CoOx-N/C was used to catalyze the subsequent oxidation esterification of DFF into FDMC. Recently, our group have employed MOF-derived Co@CN catalysts and CoCu bimetallic catalysts for the efficiently oxidative esterification of HMF [28,29]. We demonstrated that O2 is absorbed and activated in N-doped carbon in these carbon-coated metal catalysts, and the reactivity of catalysts is attributed to the electron transfer between the metal and N-doped carbon. But expensive precursors, complex preparation processes or the use of base are involved in these cases. Therefore, it is highly demanded to develop novel heterogeneous non-noble metal catalysts with high activity and low cost for the selective oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC. In our previous work, a simple and sustainable two-dimensional (2D) N-doped carbon sheet supported MnO has been reported for the highly selective transfer hydrogenation of biomass aldehydes [30]. Different to the core/shell structure of MOF-derived metal@carbon materials, ultrasmall metal/metal oxide can be highly dispersed on 2D carbon sheet by this protocol. In continuation of our interests in 2D carbon sheet supported metal catalysts for sustainable chemical transformation, herein, novel Co/Co-N/CN catalysts were facilely prepared via a simple annealing strategy similar to our previous report [30], and the as-prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent catalytic performance for the base-free oxidation esterification of HMF and other biomass-derived alcohols into the corresponding esters. The structure of catalysts was detailly characterized by various technologies. Particularly, the synergistic effect between Co and Co-N in Co/N-doped carbon catalysts has been studied in combining with experiments and theoretical simulation. In addition to the favorable intrinsic activity of the catalyst, the proposed protocol is simple, economical, sustainable, and environmentally friendly."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were supplied by Aladdin Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of the Co/Co-N/CN catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of the Co/Co-N/CN catalysts In the typical procedures, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate was dissolved in 30 mL of 70% ethanol to form a clear solution, which was subsequently poured into 270 mL of 70% ethanol containing sucrose and urea. The mass ratio of Co2+: sucrose: urea is 1: 4.22: 42.2. The mixture solution was distilled at 85 °C until the solvent was completely removed. The as-obtained sol–gel mixture was dried at 100 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, the mixture was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 300 °C for 1 h, and then pyrolyzed at 700 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 atmosphere, resulting in the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst. In addition, the Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 catalysts were prepared by the identical method as the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst with different calcination temperatures."
4,Typical procedure of catalytic oxidation esterification of HMF,"2.3 Typical procedure of catalytic oxidation esterification of HMF In a typical run, HMF (0.5 mmol), the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst (100 mg), and methanol (5 mL) were added in a stainless-steel reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and then the air in the reactor was removed by flushing with O2. Then the reactor was pressured with 1 bar O2 and the reaction was started at 80 °C. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by a magnet, and a sample of the liquid mixture was subjected to GC analysis. The conversion of HMF and the yield of products were calculated by the external standard method according to the following equations: H M F c o n v e r s i o n = 1 - M o l e s o f H M F M o l e s o f H M F l o a d e d × 100 % P r o d u c t s e l e c t i v i t y = M o l e s o f p r o d u c t M o l e s o f H M F c o n v e r t e d × 100 % P r o d u c t y i e l d = M o l e s o f p r o d u c t M o l e s o f H M F l o a d e d × 100 %"
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/max X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 0.1543 nm). Raman spectra were measured on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with 633 nm laser excitation. The laser power was 10 mW, and the spot size was 2 m. The size and morphology of materials were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100), the samples were dispersed in ethanol with ultrasound and then loaded in the copper grid before TEM analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI electron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.8 eV) and the spot size of all spectra were 650 μm. The X-ray absorption spectra were collected on the beamline BL01C1 in NSRRC, and technical support for XAS was provided by Ceshigo Research Service Agency. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. XANES and EXAFS data reduction and analysis were processed by Athena software."
6,Computational section,"2.5 Computational section All theoretical calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [31,32], employing the density functional theory (DFT) and the Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) method [33]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to describe the exchange and correlation effect [34]. In all the cases, the cut-off energy was set to be 400 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack grids [35] were set to be 1 × 1 × 4 for all the surface calculations. The convergence of energy and forces were set to 1 × 10-4 eV and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. For the Co-N/CN model, a 5 × 5 graphene (parameters: a = b = 12.3 Å and γ = 120°) is employed with 3C atoms replaced by Co-N structure. The Co4 cluster was placed on Co-N/CN as a typical model of the Co/Co-N/CN catalyst. For Co/CN, the Co4 cluster was placed on pyridinic N doped graphene. At least 15 Å vacuum layer was applied in z-direction of the slab models, preventing the vertical interactions between slabs."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization As illustrated in Fig. 1 a, the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst was synthesized by annealing a sol–gel composite of sucrose, urea, and cobalt acetate in an N2 atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that metallic Co NPs with an average size of 10.5 nm were uniformly dispersed through all the nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet ( Figure S1 a, S1b, and Fig. 1 c). Additionally, Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to evaluate the thickness of the nanosheet. The height was ranging from 1 to 2 nm, (Fig. 1 b), revealing the presence of few-layer graphenes (layer number: 3 ~ 6). The high-resolution TEM image of the selected area showed the well-defined lattice fringe spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.206 nm, (Fig. 1 d, 1e), which was assigned to the (002) facet of graphitic carbon and the (111) plane of metallic Co NPs [36,37], respectively. Clearly, the metallic cobalt nanoparticles were covered by graphene layers and embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon, which can prevent the aggregation of metallic Co NPs. Additionally, the HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1 f) and the corresponding EDS mappings (Fig. 1 g-j) confirmed a highly homogeneous distribution of C, N, and Co throughout the entire nanosheet. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) line-scan profiles ( Figure S1 d) of the selected areas indicated the successful incorporation of part of the Co metal center into the carbon framework through Co-N bonds in the as-synthesized Co/Co-N/CN material. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern ( Figure S1 e) of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst indicated the coexistence of graphitic carbon (002) [38] and cubic Co (PDF#89-7093) phases, respectively, which was consistent with the TEM observations. Furthermore, the Raman spectra ( Figure S1 f) showed that the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst had both the graphitized carbon (G bond) and the disoriented carbon (D bond). To investigate the structure of Co/Co-N/CN-700 at the atomic level, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies were performed. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the XANES curves of Co/Co-N/CN-700 at the Co K-edge are different from those of the two reference samples of Co foil and CoO. The Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst has an E0 value in the pre-edges of 7711.4 eV (Table S1), which is between those of CoO (7715.8 eV) and Co foil (7709.4 eV). As the higher the oxidation state of Co has the higher E0, the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst should have an average valence state between 0 and + 2, which further confirmed that it coexisted of metallic Co0 metal and a high-valence Co-N component. This result was in good agreement with the EDS line-scanning observations. The Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum (Fig. 2 b) of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst showed two prominent peaks in the range of 1–3 Å. The first peak at 1.38 Å is assigned to the Co − N coordination, and the second peak at 2.15 Å corresponded to the Co − Co coordination. Furthermore, no peak for the Co-O coordination was found in Co/Co-N/CN, suggesting that the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst contains no CoOx species. The EXAFS fitting parameters and the corresponding fitting curves were presented in Table S2 and Fig. 2 c. The coordination numbers of Co-N and Co-Co bonds were approximately 1 and 5, respectively, and the fitted results were in line with the experimental results. The valence states of Co and N in the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Co 2p3/2 peak (Fig. 2 d, top) was resolved into two peaks with the binding energies at 778.6 and 781.3 eV, which are attributed to Co0 and Co-N, respectively. Furthermore, the O 1 s peak centered at 531.9 eV is related to absorbed oxygen ( Figure S1 g), further excluding the formation of CoOx species. ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optic Emission Spectrometer) analysis revealed Co loadings of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst was 32.0 wt%, while the surface concentration of Co determined based on XPS was approximately 6.8 wt% for the obtained Co/Co-N/CN-700. Since the oxidative esterification reaction occurs only on the surface of the catalyst, this value represents the upper limits to the real number of catalytic sites. The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 2 d, bottom) was fitted into three prominent bands with the binding energies at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV, and 401.3 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively, which are commonly regarded as coordinating sites for transition metal species. It’s worth be noting that pyridinic N, pyrrolic N can also provide basic sites due to their lone pair of electrons as evidenced by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis ( Figure S2 )."
9,Catalyst activity and stability,"3.2 Catalyst activity and stability The catalytic performance of the well-defined Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst for the oxidative esterification of HMF was investigated under base-free conditions in atmosphere O2. As shown in Table 1 , a relatively low HMF conversion was obtained for 5 h at 40 °C or 60 °C (Table 1 , entry 1–2), while a quantitative HMF conversion (96%) and FDMC selectivity (92%) was achieved when the reaction temperature was raised to 80 °C (Table 1 , entry 3). Moreover, further increasing the temperature to 100 °C has no obvious efficiency improvement (Table 1 entry 4). Of note, the reaction cannot occur in the presence of carbon only (Table 1 , entry 5), and a trace HMF conversion of 3% was achieved using nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (CN) (Table 1 , entry 6), which was prepared by the same method of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst without the addition of cobalt salt. These results indicated that cobalt nanoparticles were the active sites for the oxidative esterification of HMF into FDMC, and nitrogen atoms in the nitrogen-doped carbon supports also played some positive role in this transformation. The kinetic results (Fig. 3 a) show that 5-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-furoate (HMMF) and 5-formyl-2-methyl-furoate (FMF) were formed as intermediates, and an FDMC yield of 92% was achieved by prolonging the reaction time to 12 h. To the best of our knowledge, the resultant Co/Co-N/CN-700 represents one of the most active and stable oxidative esterification catalysts, rivalling many reported noble catalysts (Table S3). For comparison, the Co/Co-N/CN catalysts synthesized at different temperatures (600 and 800 °C) were further investigated, and they were also tested for catalytic oxidative esterification of HMF under the same conditions mentioned above. Fig. 3 b showed that Co/Co-N/CN-700 exhibited higher catalytic efficiency than Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 (product distribution was shown in Figure S3, S4 ). Under identical reaction conditions, the use of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst led to an FDMC yield of 56% within 1 h, whereas lower FDMC yields of 26% and 43% were achieved over the Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 catalysts, respectively. These results suggested that the pyrolysis temperature plays an important role on the activity of the catalysts. Besides the high intrinsic activity, excellent stability and recyclability are other principal criteria in estimating the heterogeneous catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 c and Figure S5, S6 , both HMF conversion and FDMC yield remained stable without no visible loss of at least five consecutive runs. Due to the magnetic properties of metallic cobalt, the as-prepared Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst could be easily recycled by an external magnet ( Figure S6 a). XRD, XPS and TEM analyses ( Figure S6 b-f) showed that the crystal structure, original size/morphology, and dispersion of Co/Co-N/CN-700 remained almost the same before and after the reactions, confirming the excellent stability and recyclability of the material under the investigated conditions. The excellent stability of the Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst was due to the fixation effect of nitrogen-doped 2D carbon layer that prevented the aggregation of inner metallic cobalt nanoparticles Furthermore, Co/Co-N/CN-700 can act as a general catalyst for the oxidative esterification of alcohols. As shown in Fig. 3 d (top) and Figure S7 , desired products with high yields of 92%, 96%, 98%, 99%, 96%, and 94% were also achieved within 12 h at 80 °C under the base-free condition when using HMF and other alcohols such as furfural alcohol (FA), aromatic benzyl alcohol (BA), 4-hydroxymethyl benzaldehyde, cinnamic alcohol and 4-isopropylbenzyl alcohol as the substrate, respectively. Moreover, the oxidative esterification of HMF, FA, and BA were also investigated over Co/Co-N/CN-T catalysts with different calcination temperatures. These results (Fig. 3 d, bottom) further demonstrated that Co/Co-N/CN-700 showed the highest catalytic activity, affording the highest yields of the corresponding methyl esters, and Co/Co-N/CN-800 was much higher active than Co/Co-N/CN-600."
10,Mechanism on the catalyst activity,"As shown in Fig. 4 a, the Co 2p XPS spectra of Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 were similar to the XPS spectrum of Co/C-N/CN-700, and they also exhibited two peaks with the binding energies around 781.3 and 778.6 eV, which are attributed to the Co-N and Co-Co bonds, respectively. The results of other characterizations (XRD, Raman, TEM, XPS, ICP-OES) of Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 were also shown in Figure S8, S9 , and Table S4. The characterizations revealed that the Co NPs were present the metallic states in the Co/Co-N/CN-T catalysts, while the pyrolysis temperature showed a great influence on the size of Co NPs as shown in TEM images and the nitrogen species as shown in the N 1 s XPS spectra (Fig. 4 f). The average sizes of Co NPs were 10.1, 10.5 and 18.6 nm for the Co/Co-N/CN-600, Co/Co-N/CN-700 and Co/Co-N/CN-800 catalysts, respectively. A notable size effect of Co NPs on the final catalytic activity can be excluded due to the fact that the Co/Co-N/CN-600 with the lowest Co size shows the lowest catalytic performance. Furthermore, the effect of specific surface area also could be ignored because the surface area of these catalysts (Co/Co-N/CN) is too low (<40 m2g−1). Co/Co-N/CN-800 with the highest Co content (for both total Co content and surface Co content) shows the higher and lower catalytic performance than Co/Co-N/CN-600 and Co/Co-N/CN-700, respectively, excluding the obvious effects of the cobalt content. At a lower temperature (600 °C), the ratio of Co to Co-N in the Co/Co-N/CN-600 catalyst showed an obvious decline to 0.6 (Fig. 4 b), while a higher ratio of 1.4 was observed with the temperature increase to 800 °C (Fig. 4 b). Experimental data showed that low (0.6) or high (1.4) ratios of Co to Co-N would result in lower catalytic activity ( Fig. 4 c). To further discriminate the role of the metal Co and Co-N in the oxidative esterification of HMF, SCN- was introduced to poison the Co − N sites because SCN− could form a stable chelate complex with Co cations [39–41]. As shown in Fig. 4 d, the yields of the desired products showed an obvious drop off by using HMF, FA, and BA as substrates with the introduction of SCN- (0.5 equiv), respectively. These results indicated a synergistic effect between Co and Co-N components on activity of Co/C-N/CN catalysts. To verify the superior activity of the Co/Co-N/CN catalyst for the oxidative esterification of alcohols, a series of DFT calculations were performed. An optimized model containing Co4 nanoclusters and Co-N group-doped single-layer graphite carbon ( Figure S10 a) was constructed for the Co/Co-N/CN catalyst based on its experimental characterizations. For a systematic comparison, model systems containing Co4 nanoclusters for the Co/CN catalyst, and Co-N group-doped single-layer graphite carbon for the Co-N/CN catalyst ( Figure S10 b-c) were also considered. To better understand these three models, schematic illustrations of the Co-N/CN, Co/CN, and Co/Co-N/CN catalysts were presented in Fig. 5 a. Although these proposed models were much smaller than the real structures as characterized above, these models reasonably resemble these geometries of the Co/CN and Co/Co-N/CN catalysts. As previously reported, the catalytic activity of Co/C was enhanced by the electron transfer between Co nanoparticles and N-doped carbon [42–44]. As shown in Fig. 4 e, the Co/Co-N/CN catalyst exhibited an obvious enhanced electron transfer ability compared to the Co/CN catalyst, which was in accordance with its higher catalytic activity over the Co/CN catalyst. This result was also demonstrated by the upward shift of the graphitic N 1 s XPS peaks in the lower or higher ratio of Co to Co/N (Fig. 4 f). It is known that the aerobic oxidation reaction always starts with the activation of O2 [45]. The bonding charge analysis (Fig. 5 b) clearly showed the charge transfer from the Co adatom to the adsorbed O atoms at the Co/oxide contacts. This charge can be transferred more easily from the Co/Co-N configuration, as demonstrated by the curve of planar-average change density. In addition, the Co/Co-N group exhibited the lowest oxygen adsorption energy among these three models (Fig. 5 c), indicating that O2 molecules can be much more easily activated on the metal Co sites of Co/Co-N/CN. On the other hand, alcohol and aldehyde molecules can also adsorb on the electron-poor metal Co sites, and then the activated oxygen species promote the dehydrogenation of alcohol to aldehyde and oxidative esterification of aldehydes to ester a via the β-hydride elimination as shown in Fig. 5 d. Note that H-metal species are commonly formed in the β-hydride elimination process, so the effective basic sites in Co-N species can promote the deprotonation of the H-metal species to regenerate the active metal surface. The energy profile of the rate-determining step (oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde [28,46]) on Co/Co-N/CN was 1.43 eV, which was slightly lower than that of Co/CN (1.64 eV), indicating that the reaction activity was largely determined by the O2 activation and the deprotonation of the H-metal species process. But the oxidation of alcohol was difficult on the Co-N site due to the high energy barrier to activate the substrate, further suggesting the important role of metal Co for substrates activation. Overall, these calculation results were well in agreement with the experimental observations, and validating the superior promoting effect of the Co/Co-N group."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have successfully constructed a novel, low-cost, and hybrid metal/nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (Co/Co-N/CN) containing Co/Co-N groups via a simple annealing approach. The ratio of Co to Co-N species is largely determined by the pyrolysis temperature. The Co/Co-N/CN-700 catalyst has a suitable Co/Co-N ratio (0.9) and thus exhibits excellent catalytic performance and stability for the oxidative esterification of biomass-derived HMF and other investigated alcohols under base-free conditions. Co and Co-N components have a synergistic effect on high activity of Co/C-N/CN catalysts. A DFT investigation reveals the critical role of the Co/Co-N group in reducing the electron-transfer barrier between oxygen and Co sites, optimizing the free energy of O2 adsorption and lowering the energy barrier of oxidation of alcohols. The application of this grouping effect of Co/Co-N in CN nanosheets provides an effective strategy for optimizing the electron transfer ability of metal/nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts for enhanced oxidative chemistry."
