0,Introduction,"In landfill and municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plant, a great volume of leachate will be produced [1,2]. Due to the complexity of organics constitution, landfill leachate is marked as a special kind of heavily-polluted wastewater, which include organic and nitrogen pollutants and inorganic salts [3–6]. Compared with young landfill leachate, there is a higher concentration of refractory organics in mature landfill leachate, the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) is extremely low, and total nitrogen (TN) ratio is seriously unbalanced [7–9]. In addition, mature leachate contains thousands of organic substances and many of them were highly unsaturated [10]. If the mature landfill leachate was treated poorly before discharge, the surrounding environment will be greatly affected. Many traditional treatment processes cannot effectively remove pollutants in mature landfill leachate when operated individually. A combined “pretreatment + biological treatment + advanced treatment” process is therefore widely used to eliminate pollutants from landfill leachate. As an advanced treatment process, nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membrane separation technology has attracted increasing attention because it can remove almost all of the organic matter in the effluent from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) [11–14]. However, it also produces a large volume of secondary pollutants, such as concentrated leachate, which has led to difficulties in the practical application of membrane methods in the treatment of waste leachate effluent [15–18]. The advanced oxidation process is mainly applied to oxidize or mineralize the refractory organics in wastewater by activating and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). The advanced oxidation process based on the hydroxyl radical (•OH) and sulfate radical (SO4 •-) has been widely used to eliminate various refractory or toxic pollutants [19–24]. The •OH is a non-selective oxidant with a high redox potential (E0 = 2.7 V) [25], which can react with organic pollutants rapidly, and SO4 •- also has a redox potential of 2.6 V [26,27], and is nonselective for organic pollutants [28]. There are many ways to activate oxidants to produce ROS. Under the activation of microwave (MW) irradiation, persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are the two most commonly used oxidants to produce •OH and SO4 •- [29–31]. Many studies have shown that MW-H2O2 advanced oxidation technology has the advantages of fast oxidation rate, simple operation, and no sludge production [25,32]. On the other hand, PS is easily activated by MW irradiation to produce ROS, and is also one of the most effective sources of SO4 •- [33,34]. Qi et al [30] treated endocrine disruptors by MW/PS, and found that the introduction of MW irradiation enabled the rapid degradation of endocrine disruptors. The ROS species produced by different processes will be different. It is, therefore, speculated that the degradation mechanisms of different strong oxidizing ROS on humus in MBR effluent following landfill leachate treatment will be significantly different. However, the removal rate and changes in molecular structure of refractory organic matter (i.e., humus) in landfill leachate by MW-H2O2 and MW-PS processes have not been systematically studied. This study systematically investigated the reaction mechanism of the MW-H2O2 and MW-PS processes for the treatment of landfill leachate effluent from an MBR, and evaluated the effect of important reaction parameters (oxidant dosage, initial pH, and MW power) on the removal of refractory organics in the wastewater. Through an alcohol quenching experiment, the differences in the roles of free radicals between the MW-H2O2 and MW-PS processes for the MBR treatment of landfill leachate were studied. The characteristic structure of the organic matter and the differences in the degradation of humus in the two processes were analyzed by considering ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. Finally, the energy consumption of the two processes for the treatment of the leachate effluent from the MBR were compared. The study provides a useful reference for the selection of an advanced oxidation method to remove refractory organics from landfill leachate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,MBR effluent leachate,"2.1 MBR effluent leachate The landfill leachate used for MBR treatment was obtained from a large traditional landfill in southwest China. The landfill was closed in 2017 after being operated for 26 years. The primary landfill leachate had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 5000 ± 1000 mg/L, total organic carbon (TOC) content of 2510 mg/L, ammonia nitrogen concentration of 1500 ± 500 mg/L, and a weakly alkaline pH of 7.90 ± 0.1. Landfill leachate was treated by a combined anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor and reverse osmosis (A/O + A/O + MBR + RO) process. The leachate effluent was obtained from the MBR effluent of the landfill leachate treatment station, which had a daily treatment capacity of 200 m3/d MBR tailwater. The apparent color of the MBR leachate was dark brown, with a COD of 1829.79 mg/L, UV254 of 29.85 cm−1, and a biochemical index (BOD5/COD) lower than 0.10. The wastewater was likely to be difficult to degrade due to the presence of a high humus concentration."
3,Reagents and instruments,"2.2 Reagents and instruments Potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) of analytical purity was purchased from Merck (Germany), while 30% H2O2, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) particles of analytical purity were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemicals Co. Ltd., (China), and distilled water was also used in the experimental process. The MW reactor (M1-211A) was purchased from Midea (China) and professionally modified."
4,Experimental methods,"2.3 Experimental methods 2.3.1 The MW/PS process A100 ml sample of leachate effluent from the MBR was placed into a 250 ml round bottom flask. A preset amount of K2S2O8 was added. After the K2S2O8 dissolved completely the initial pH value was adjusted and the sample was placed into a MW reactor. The power was adjusted and the reaction was timed before being immediately terminated by an ice water bath. The pH, COD, Chroma value, and PS residue of the effluent were measured after the effluent was cooled and filtered. The PS content was converted into a COD (1 g K2S2O8 changed the COD value by about 29.79 mg). 2.3.2 The MW/H2O2 process A 100 ml sample of leachate effluent from the MBR was placed into a 250 ml round bottom flask. A preset amount of H2O2 was added. The initial pH value was adjusted and the sample was placed into a MW reactor. The power was adjusted and the reaction was timed before being immediately terminated by an ice water bath. Finally, after the effluent had cooled, the pH value was determined by filtration, and then adjusted to 9.0. A trace of catalase was immediately added to the sample to remove the residual H2O2, and then the Chroma value and COD were determined. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and the data presented is the mean value. Error bar is not shown because the difference was negligible."

6,Results and discussion,
7,Comparison of the organic matter removal rate and synergistic efficiency between the two processes,"3.1 Comparison of the organic matter removal rate and synergistic efficiency between the two processes As shown in Fig. 1 when the single oxidant (PS or H2O2 alone) was applied there was no obvious effect on the COD removal and UV254 of the leachate effluent from the MBR, and its kobs were 0.0034 and 0.0061 min−1, respectively (as shown in Table 1 ). This was because under normal temperature, it was difficult for the oxidants (PS and H2O2) to decompose and produce ROS [35]. The COD removal rate from wastewater was therefore relatively low, which was also consistent with the observation of previous studies [36–38] that the organic matter removal rate by a PS treatment alone was very low when there was almost no heating. Due to the lack of an oxidant in a MW treatment without an oxidant, the kobs was only 0.0005 min−1, which represented a very low organic matter removal rate. The organic matter removal rate when using the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes to treat the landfill leachate was significantly improved compared with the individual treatments. Previous studies have shown that MW irradiation can reduce the activation energy and accelerate the decomposition rate of PS and H2O2 [31,39]; thus, greatly increasing the organic matter removal rate. Qi et al [40] also reported that when PS was activated by MW, the decomposition rate of PS could be much faster that of an conventional thermal activation. Therefore, MW irradiation could activate the oxidants (PS and H2O2) and rapidly remove the organic matter from the leachate effluent from the MBR. The reaction rate constant of the MW/PS process was 0.0528 min−1 higher than that of the MW/H2O2 process, and the synergistic coefficients of the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes were 23.67 and 11.43, respectively, which indicated that the synergistic effect of MW and PS was significantly higher than that of MW and H2O2. Although the amount of oxidant in the MW/PS process was significantly lower than in the MW/H2O2 process, the degradation of organics in the MW/PS process was not as effective as in the MW/H2O2 process in the early stage of the reaction. However, the kobs was higher and the effectiveness of degradation in the MW/PS process was better than in the MW/H2O2 process at the later stage of the reaction. Previous studies have revealed that the activation energy required for O-O fracture is 140.2 kJ/mol for PS to produce SO4 •- and 195.4 kJ/mol for H2O2 to produce •OH [41–44], while H2O2 in a high temperature environment is unstable and prone to self-decomposition. It is likely that it would be easier for PS to produce SO4 •- under the same external energy, which would then be more effective than •OH in humus degradation in landfill leachate. Based on these results, there was a certain degree of variance between the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes in the removal of organics and the initial reaction rate. At the same time, previous studies have shown that MW power, oxidant dosage, and the pH value of the process will have an important impact on the reaction process in an advanced oxidation process using MW activated peroxides [45–47]. In this study, a systematic evaluation of the important reaction parameters was conducted."
8,The impact of influencing factors on the organic matter removal rate,"3.2 The impact of influencing factors on the organic matter removal rate 3.2.1 Effect of oxidant dosage on organic matter removal The influence of oxidant dosage on the degradation of organic pollutants in the leachate effluent from the MBR was investigated and was shown in Fig. 2 . In the MW/PS process, the kobs value and COD removal rate increased as the oxidant dosage increased. When the PS dosage increased from 25 to 75 mmol/L, the initial reaction rate increased from 0.0126 to 0.0528 min−1 and the COD removal rate increased from 19.45% to 58.93%. This was because the more PS that was added, the more SO4 •- was produced by activation, and the better the removal rate. When the PS dosage was increased to 100 mmol/L, the apparent rate constant increased significantly while the COD removal rate only increased slightly. In the MW/H2O2 process, when the H2O2 dosage increased from 250 to 750 mmol/L, the initial reaction rate increased from 0.0202 to 0.0440 min−1 and the COD removal rate increased from 25.21% to 47.37%. As the dosage continued to increase there was a slight increase in the COD removal rate, while the kobs increased significantly. A similar phenomenon was observed in the MW/H2O2 and MW/PS processes with regard to organic matter removal, i.e., increasing the amount of oxidant increased the pollutant removal rate and the reaction rate, but an excessive amount of oxidant only improved the kobs of the process and resulted in the reaction rapidly reaching an equilibrium (i.e., the pollutant removal rate was not significantly improved). Therefore, the addition of excessive oxidant led to a significant reduction in the effectiveness of both processes. 3.2.2 Effect of MW power on organic matter removal Differences in MW output power will lead to differences in the heating rate and final temperature of the system, which together will impact the pollutant degradation efficiency in landfill leachate. The effect of differences in MW output power on the treatment of organic pollutants in the leachate effluent from the MBR is shown in Fig. 3 . In the MW/PS process, when the MW output power was gradually increased from 150 to 450 W, the initial reaction rate increased from 0.0315 to 0.0528 min−1 and the COD removal rate increased from 8.50% to 58.93%. This was because a higher MW energy enhanced electronic vibration, improving the heating rate of the system, and creating more free radicals by activation, ultimately resulting in a stronger degradation effect. However, when the MW output power increased above 450 W, although the reaction rate constant increased, the COD removal rate was barely improved. Similarly, in the MW/H2O2 process, with an increase of MW output power from 150 to 450 W, the initial reaction rate increased from 0.0117 to 0.0440 min−1 and the COD removal rate increased from 15.79% to 47.37%. A further increase in MW output power increased the reaction rate constant, but the COD removal rate only increased slightly. Therefore, with an increase in MW output power, the organic matter removal rates in the MW/H2O2 and MW/PS processes were similar. 3.2.3 Effect of system pH on organic matter removal As shown in Fig. 4 (a-b), in the MW/PS process, the COD removal rate tended to decrease with an increase in the initial pH, but the decrease in the removal rate was not significant. For example, when the initial pH increased from 3 to 10, the COD removal rate decreased slightly from 65.40% to 53.83%. The kobs also decreased with the increase in pH. This was because the free radicals in the MW/PS process were mainly SO4 •- but SO4 •- will react with OH– to generate •OH (Eq. (1)), resulting in an increase in the proportion of •OH among the total free radicals under alkaline conditions compared with acid conditions. The •OH redox potential under alkaline conditions was relatively small, resulting in the treatment effect and reaction rate of the process not being as strong as that under acid conditions. The MW/H2O2 process was very different than the MW/PS process, with the treatment effect being better under acid conditions than under neutral or alkaline conditions. The highest COD removal rate of 47.37% was achieved when the pH was 5. When the initial pH was 8.3, the COD removal rate was much lower at 22.21%. Under strong acidic conditions (e.g., pH = 3), the H+ concentration was high and hydrated hydrogen ions (H3O2 +) formed in the system, which would improve the stability of H2O2 and restrict the generation of •OH. At the same time, the annihilation reaction between H+ and •OH occurs more readily under low pH conditions, and therefore, the treatment effectiveness at pH = 3 was worse than at pH = 5. On the other hand, because H2O2 is weakly acidic and exists under an acid ionization equilibrium (Eq. (2)), under acidic conditions, the large number of H+ ions would inhibit its ionization reaction enabling its molecular morphology to remain relatively stable. When the pH of the system increased, the increase in the OH– concentration and neutralization of H+ accelerated the ionization of H2O2, resulting in its decomposition into HO2 –. The HO2 – will compete with the organic pollutants for •OH, and the reaction rate is greater than that of the reactions between •OH and organic pollutants, with the result that the pollutant removal rate was reduced. In conclusion, the MW/PS process was effective for the treatment of organic matters in the tail water of an MBR used to treat landfill leachate under both acidic and alkaline conditions, while the MW/H2O2 process was only effective under acid conditions. Under alkaline conditions, when the pH was 8.3, the COD removal rate of the MW/PS process was 36.72% higher than that of the MW/H2O2 process. Therefore, compared with the MW/H2O2 process, the MW/PS process was effective for the treatment of leachate effluent from an MBR over a wider range of pH conditions.

9,Comparison of the ROS produced by the two processes,"3.3 Comparison of the ROS produced by the two processes To identify the ROS in the two processes, different concentrations of tert-butanol (TBA) and ethanol (EtOH) were added to the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes and the effects were shown in Fig. 5 . Because the destruction of functional groups in landfill leachate can destroy the chromophores in organic matter in wastewater after treatment by the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes, and the quenching agent also had a certain level of absorption at UV 254 nm, the intensity of free radical and organic matter activity in the two processes was investigated using cyanide (CN) as the index material. When EtOH was used to quench SO4 •- and •OH, the initial reaction rates were 1.6–7.7 × 107 and 1.8–2.8 × 109 M−1s−1 [48], respectively, and when TBA was used to quench •OH, the initial reaction rates were in the range of 3.8–7.6 × 108 M−1s−1 [48,49]. It can be seen from Fig. 5 (a) that compared with the control group without the addition of TBA and EtOH, the CN removal rate declined after adding the quenching agent, indicating that the addition of a quenching agent reduced the amount of ROS in the system; thus, reducing the pollutant removal rate. When a certain amount of TBA was added to the MW/PS process, the removal rate decreased from 95.83% to 74.89% after a 16 min reaction, while after adding two different amounts of EtOH, the removal rate decreased from 95.83% to 62.70% and 34.78% respectively. It can be seen that SO4 •- and •OH coexisted in the MW/PS process and contributed to the degradation of organic matter, but SO4 •- played a more important role in the degradation of organic matter in the wastewater. From Fig. 5 (b), it can be seen that after adding two different amounts of TBA to the MW/H2O2 process, the Chroma value decreased significantly. The removal rate decreased from 93.71% to 79.98% and 65.90%, respectively, when the reaction time was 16 min, which shows that •OH played a major role in the degradation of organic matter in MW/H2O2 process. Therefore, the different ROS in the two oxidation processes led to a difference in the organic matter removal rate from the MBR effluent."
10,Comparison of organic matter removal between the two processes,"3.4 Comparison of organic matter removal between the two processes 3.4.1 Comparison of the removal of the characteristic structure of organic matter between the two processes There are many complex organic compounds in the leachate effluent from an MBR, with the result that the UV–Vis spectrum of MBR effluent has a strong absorbance at 200–380 nm. The UV–Vis absorption spectrum was used to characterize the effluent treated by the two processes, and the effect of the different systems on the degradation of organics in the MBR effluent was analyzed and compared. As shown in Fig. 6 and S1, there was no obvious absorption peak in the MBR effluent, indicating that there were many different kinds of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the wastewater. With an increase in reaction time, the absorption strength of the effluent in the MW, PS, and H2O2 treatments alone decreased to some extent (as shown in Fig. 6 ), although the decreases were not significant. This indicated that neither the external energy input nor the oxidant process alone could directly degrade the organic compounds in the MBR effluent effectively. However, when MW irradiation and an oxidant were combined (i.e., the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes), the absorbance of the effluent displayed a significantly decreasing trend with the increase in reaction time. This indicated that both combined processes could destroy the complex structure of organic matter and substantially reduce its concentration in wastewater. The characteristic absorbance values of the effluent from the different processes is shown in Tables 2, 3 and S1–S3. The E254 and E280 values are mainly used to indicate the degree of aromatization of organics [25]. The higher the values of E254 and E280, the higher the degree of aromatization. The E300/E400 , E240/E420 , and E250/E365 ratios are used to characterize the molecular weight and degree of polymerization of organics, the structure of humic acid, and the molecular weight of organics, respectively [50]. The higher the values of the ratios, the smaller the molecular weight, degree of polymerization, and degree of coalescence of organic compounds. Absorption at 226–400 nm is caused by a benzene ring structure with multiple conjugated systems, and therefore absorbance in the range of 226–400 nm was integrated to determine the changes of aromatic compounds in the effluent after treatment by each process. It can be seen from tables S1–S3 that compared with the untreated MBR effluent, when the reaction time was 16 min, the E254 and E280 values in the effluent treated by MW, H2O2, or PS alone were not significantly reduced, while the E300/E400 , E240/E420 , E250/E365 , and A226-400 values were not significantly changed, which shows that these three processes had no significant effect on the reduction and destruction of aromatic organics and other substances in the wastewater. However, both the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes were effective at degrading organic matter in wastewater. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, when the reaction time was 16 min, the E254 and E280 values in the effluent treated by the MW/PS process decreased from 0.6512 and 0.5269 to 0.2157 and 0.1234, respectively, while the E254 and E280 values in the effluent treated by the MW/H2O2 process decreased to 0.2808 and 0.1003, respectively. The E280 value of the effluent treated by the MW/H2O2 process after a 16 min reaction was slightly lower than that of the effluent treated by the MW/PS process. The effect of the MW/PS process on the E254 value was significantly better than that of the MW/H2O2 process. In addition, the A226-400 values of the two processes also decreased with reaction time. After a reaction time of 6 min, the A226-400 value of the effluent treated by the MW/PS process was smaller than that treated by the MW/H2O2 process, which indicated that MW/PS process could better degrade aromatic organic compounds containing a benzene ring in the wastewater. On the other hand, with an increase in reaction time, the E300/E400 , E240/E420 , and E250/E365 ratios in effluent treated by the MW/H2O2 and MW/PS processes were significantly higher than those in raw water, indicating that both processes could significantly reduce the molecular weight, degree of polymerization, and the structure of organics in wastewater. 3.4.2 Comparison of fluorescent compounds removal between the two processes A three-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (3D-EEM) was used to analyze the MBR effluent treated by the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes. As shown in Fig. S2, there were two light-emitting regions in 3D-EEM of the MBR raw water. Light-emitting region 1 (Ex/Em = 235–255 nm/410–450 nm) represented the fulvic acid-like (FAL) fluorescence in the UV region, which is mainly caused by organic compounds with low molecular weight and high fluorescence frequency (FAL) [8]. Light-emitting region 2 (Ex/Em = 310–360 nm/370–450 nm) represented FAL fluorescence in the visible region, which is mainly caused by relatively stable aromatic substances with large molecular weight (humic acid-like (HAL)) [51]. The peak values of the two light-emitting regions of MBR raw water were 1445.0 (Ex/Em = 250/455 nm) and 804.2 (Ex/Em = 325/410 nm), respectively. With an increase in reaction time, the peak intensities of the two luminescent regions in the effluent treated by the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes decreased significantly. For example, at a reaction time of 12 min, the peaks of fulvic acid fluorescence in the UV and visible regions of effluent treated by the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes decreased by 81.6 and 79.3% and 84.9 and 69.3%, respectively, which indicated that both processes could effectively degrade fulvic acid and humic acid in MBR effluent. In the middle and late stage of the reaction (i.e., 6–12 min), the removal of the two fluorescent regions in the effluent treated by the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes had different advantages. For example, at a reaction time of 8 min, the fluorescence of fulvic acid in the UV region and the fluorescence of fulvic acid in the visible region in the effluent treated by the MW/PS process were 360.1 and 248.1, respectively, while in the effluent treated by the MW/H2O2 process the corresponding values were 245.7 and 296.8 respectively. Therefore, the decrease in the fluorescence peak of fulvic acid in the visible region was more obvious in the MW/PS process, while in contrast, the decrease in the fluorescence peak of fulvic acid in the UV region was more obvious in the MW/H2O2 process. These results show that the effectiveness of organic degradation by the two free radicals (SO4 •- and •OH), as represented by these two fluorescence regions, were different. To further explore and compare the removal mechanism of refractory humus in MBR effluent by the two processes, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the effluent treated by the MW/PS process quenched with EtOH was analyzed. The results are shown in Fig. 7 . After adding EtOH to the MW/PS process, the reduction of FAL fluorescence in the UV region was found to be greater than that in the visible region, which was the opposite of the result obtained without the quenching agent. When n(PS)/n(EtOH) = 1/10 and the reaction time was 12 min, the decrease in peak intensities in the two regions were 58.1% and 34.0% respectively, which were 23.5% and 45.3% lower than those obtained using the MW/PS process without EtOH. Therefore, the reduction of FAL fluorescence in the visible region had a more obvious inhibitory effect. On the one hand, this confirms that SO4 •- and •OH activity in the MW/PS process was quenched by EtOH, which led to a reduction in the humus removal rate in the leachate effluent from the MBR. On the other hand, considering that the main free radical in the MW/PS process was SO4 •-, and the FAL fluorescence in the visible region in the MW/PS process had a more obvious inhibitory effect, this indicates that SO4 •- activity could effectively reduce the FAL fluorescence in the visible region. To summarize, both the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes could effectively remove the refractory humus in MBR effluent. At the same time, SO4 •- could more easily degrade the relatively stable and a large molecular weight HAL substances, while •OH could more easily degrade the low molecular weight FAL substances."
11,Comparison of energy consumption between the two processes,"3.5 Comparison of energy consumption between the two processes Because the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes both consume electric energy, the electrical energy per order (EEO) (see Eq. (2)) was used to evaluate the energy consumption of the two processes at different reaction times. The formula expresses the energy loss of the process through the mathematical relations of MW power, reaction time, and the ratio of initial COD to effluent COD. The smaller the EEO, the smaller the energy required to treat the wastewater per unit volume. As shown in Fig. 8 , the MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes had a similar energy consumption trend, i.e., the energy consumed by the process was inversely proportional to the reaction time at 0–8 min, and directly proportional after 8 min. This indicates that the degradation of organic matter in wastewater by the two processes mainly occurred in the early stage of the reaction. In this stage, the COD removal rate in wastewater increased significantly with the increase of reaction time, resulting in a relatively low energy loss for the degradation of a unit volume of wastewater. However, after 8 min, the organic matter degradation rate was reduced due to the limitation in the utilization rate of the reaction substrate or oxidant, and the energy consumption required for the degradation of a unit volume of wastewater increased. The energy consumption of the MW/PS process was significantly higher than that of the MW/H2O2 process before 8 min, and gradually lower than that of the MW/H2O2 process after 8 min. This shows that there were some differences between the MW/H2O2 and MW/PS processes in the period of intensive organic matter degradation. The MW/H2O2 process could effectively degrade the organic matter in the early stage of the reaction, while the MW/PS processes resulted in a stronger degradation in the middle and late stages. The energy consumption of the MW/PS process was slightly less than that of the MW/H2O2 process, with the energy saved per unit volume of wastewater treatment being about 614.2 KWh."
12,Conclusions,"The MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes benefitted from a significant synergistic effect, with the synergistic effect in the MW/PS process (synergistic coefficient F = 23.67) being significantly higher than that in the MW/H2O2 process (synergistic coefficient F = 11.43). An increase in oxidant dosage and MW output power improved the organic matter removal rate of the two processes, while an excessive oxidant dosage and high MW output power only improved the kobs of the processes, with no obvious improvement in the organic matter removal rate. The organic matter removal rate of the MW/PS process was generally higher than that of the MW/H2O2 process, with the MW/H2O2 process only having a strong organic matter removal rate under acidic conditions. The MW/PS process had a significant effect on the degradation of organic matter under both acid and alkaline conditions. An alcohol quenching experiment showed that SO4 •- and •OH existed in the MW/PS process at the same time, with SO4 •- playing the leading role in the degradation of organics, while •OH played the leading role in the degradation of organics in the MW/H2O2 process. A spectrum analysis based on the quenching experiment showed that the two processes destroyed the characteristic structure of organics and humus (i.e., HAL and FAL substances) mainly through the free radical oxidation mechanism. It was found that SO4 •- could more easily degrade HAL substances, while •OH has a better degradation effect on FAL substances; thus, the MW/PS process had a better degradation effectiveness for organics than the MW/H2O2 process with an enhancement of ROS. The MW/PS process had a lower energy consumption than the MW/H2O2 process when degrading leachate effluent from an MBR. The results of this study will provide useful reference material for the application of MW/PS and MW/H2O2 processes in the elimination of refractory organics from landfill leachate."
