0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), an excellent clean energy source, has the potential to solve the long-term lingering environmental and energy issues originating from fossil fuels [1,2]. A possible option is to store H2 in a hybrid material, which can be released for direct use in fuel cells. Formic acid (HCOOH, FA) is a suitable liquid for storage and H2 production because it under normal conditions is non-toxic, renewable sources, easy rechargeability, with high H2 content (4.4%) [3]. However, H2 generating from FA in ambient conditions remains a big challenge, which primarily depends on the catalyst used. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted towards the selective dehydrogenation of FA with noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) on solid supports, [4–8] and homogeneous systems with organometallic complexes [9,10] without the release of CO. A recent review by Xu and co-worker summarized liquid impregnation method of preparation of bimetallic AuPd NPs within MIL-101 for chemical hydrogen storage [6]. In a later study, Yamashita et al. have reported the fabrication of Pd NPs within Ti-MOFs of the MIL-125 and NH2-MIL-125 and conducted H2 generation from FA at ambient temperatures [11]. Many research groups contributed to this field of research and several Pd-based multi-metallic NPs such as Au@Pd/UiO-66(ZrxTiy) [12], PdNiAg/C [13], PdCoNi/TiO2 [14], AuPd-MnOX/ZIF-8-rGO [15], Au@Pd/N-mrGO [16], Pd/mpg-C3N4 [17], AgPd@ZIF-8 [18] for the dehydrogenation of FA. Recently, our group tremendous efforts for synthesis and encapsulated Pd NPs [19,20] and Ag nanoplates [21] have been devoted to H2 generation. Outcomes from these investigations reveal the significance of the choice of suitable catalyst supports, ligands, and cooperation of synergic issues with basic property. The development of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been intensively pursued over the past two decades, due to unique properties such as high specific surface area, defined pore size, crystalline, tunability structure [22,23]. Recently, post-synthesis modification (PSM) strategy has been employed to prepare MOFs, especially open metal site (OMS)-MOFs such as Cr-MIL-101, Cu3(BTC)2 and Cu-BDC [24,25] to achieve multi-purpose materials [26]. The functionalization of the organic linkers has mainly been used to stabilize the metal NPs [6,27], gas adsorption [28–30], while their exploitation in catalysis has not been explored. Herein, we have demonstrated the generation of H2 in FA over Pd NPs stabilized in diamine coordinated chromium-based MOFs as efficient catalysts. OMS-Cr-MIL-101 was chosen as a suitable support because of its large pore and window sizes and also high-temperature stability as well as an excellent stability in water (FA as H2 source dissolved in water) [31], which may facilitate the encapsulation of metal particles and the adsorption of the catalytic substrate FA inside the pores. By envisioning the functional nature and high surface area of Cr-MOFs, we exploited OMS/Cr-MIL-101 as excellent support for modified electron-rich group ED and PD. The good affinity between the ligands and Cr-MOF is vitally essential for the anchor and stabilizing the ultra-small palladium metal nanoparticle."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and instruments,"2.1 Materials and instruments Benzene 1,4-dicarboxylate (H2BDC), Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, ethylenediamine (H2N(CH2)2NH2, 99.9%), propylene diamine (H2N(CH2)3NH2, 99.9%), palladium chloride (PdCl2, 99.5%), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and other compounds and reagents were obtained commercially from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck (Germany) and Fluka (Switzerland). The crystalline phases of the Cr-MOF material were recognized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements (Philips-PW 1800 diffractometer). The palladium content of the MOFs was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu IR-640 spectrometer, absorbencies are reported in cm−1. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the samples were gathered by using a Zeiss-DSM 960A microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope. Ultrasonic generator was carried out on a SONICA-2200 EP, input: 50–60 Hz/305 W. The CO2 molecules generated in the reactor set-up were periodically analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and compared it by automatic CO2 gas measuring device."
3,Synthesis and activation of Cr-MIL-101 [OMS/Cr-MIL-101],"2.2 Synthesis and activation of Cr-MIL-101 [OMS/Cr-MIL-101] The procedure was adapted from the literature [6], and Cr-MIL-101 was synthesized by reaction of terephthalic acid (H2BDC, 0.664 g, 4.0 mmol) with Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (1.60 g, 4.0 mmol) in presence of aqueous HF (0.8 mL, 4.0 mmol) in 20 mL de-ionized water at 200 °C for 8 h (rate of furnace heating 1 °C/min). The obtained green precipitated was washed with DMF and DI-water three times. To remove residual unreacted terephthalic acid, the synthesis Cr-MIL-101 was purified with hot DMF and absolute EtOH several times, and finally, it was filtered and dried at 353 K. After the final isolation, the Cr-MIL-101 was activated under oven/vacuum at 423 K for 12 h to obtain an OMS-MOF structure with 68% yield."
4,Preparation of ED/Cr-MIL-101 and PD/Cr-MIL-101,"2.3 Preparation of ED/Cr-MIL-101 and PD/Cr-MIL-101 Diamine-functionalized Cr-MIL-101 was synthesized according to the following process. In a typical procedure, 500 mg of prepared dehydrated Cr-MOF of OMS/Cr-MIL-101 was stirred in 15 mL of anhydrous toluene at the 363 K for 1 h to remove the coordinated terminal water molecules on chromium(III) centers. Subsequently, 0.75 mmol of pure ED was added drop-wise to the mixture at the same temperature. To remove residual unreacted ligand, the synthesis ED/Cr-MIL-101 was purified with absolute EtOH and CH2Cl2 several times, and finally, it was filtered and dried at 353 K during 12 overnight in vacuum for 12 h. The same procedure was followed for ED by simply replacing ED with PD."
5,Preparation of colloidal palladium nanoparticles,"2.4 Preparation of colloidal palladium nanoparticles Colloidal Pd NPs were synthesized according to a method described in documented literature [32] with some minor modifications. In a typical preparation, PdCl2 (20 mg) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA monomer/PdCl2 = 9:1 M ratio) were mixed in 100 mL of DI-water and then were stirred for 60 min at 0 °C, when a yellow–brown solution ensued. After that, 20 mL of freshly prepared 0.1 M of NaBH4 was added to the mixture to generate a colloidal Pd solution. The final pH was typically 8.2–8.5."
6,Preparation of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 and Pd@PD/Cr-MIL-101,"2.5 Preparation of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 and Pd@PD/Cr-MIL-101 The as-synthesized ED-Cr-MIL-101 (500 mg) was added to the Pd colloid solution immediately after the preparation. The mixture was stirred for 4 h and then was heated at 50 °C for 30 min, then cooled to ambient condition. The formed Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 was filtered, washed with DMF, and CH2Cl2 and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. The same protocol was employed for Pd@PD/Cr-MIL-101 using MOF. Wt.% of Pd was 0.98% for Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 and 0.93% for Pd@PD/Cr-ML-101, which were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)."
7,Catalytic tests of FA dehydrogenation,"2.6 Catalytic tests of FA dehydrogenation Before starting the dehydrogenation of FA, Pd@MOFs pre-catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 oC for 12 h. Then, a modified glass reactor (78 mL) filled with a solution of FA (5% v/v, 5 mL and sodium formate 1 mmol) and the Pd@MOFs to measure the volume of the gas to be evolved dehydrogenation of FA under the ultrasonic wave. Before reaction, the glass reactor was kept to ambient condition for 30 min under N2 gas. To examine the formation of CO gas during the decomposition of FA, the headspace in the reactor was taken and analyzed by gas chromatography."
8,Results and discussion,"In the present study, we designed diamine groups grafted OMS of Cr-MIL-101 for the formation and stabilization of ultra-small Pd NPs. We demonstrate OMS/Cr-MIL-101 with unsaturated clusters of Cr3O7+ is an ideal platform for PSM reactions [33] and therefore is an excellent candidate for chelating bidentate ligands such as diamine. In our present method, the Cr-MIL-101 was fabricated using chromium nitrate and terephthalic acid as an organic linker via a solvothermal method. This Cr-MOFs reacted with various diamines moiety such as ED and PD in dried toluene to graft diamines groups on unsaturated Cr-cluster site (Scheme 1 ). Afterward, a colloid of PVA/PdCl2/NaBH4 generated, in situ, Pd nanoparticles immediately loaded on to ED/Cr-MIL-101. The same method was used for the preparation of the Pd@PD/Cr-MIL-101. Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 materials were characterized using several techniques including FT-IR, XRD, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, and AAS. FTIR analysis was utilized to explore the chemical structure of ED/Cr-MIL-101 MOFs with samples after Pd NPs loading (Fig. 1 ). As for ED/Cr-MIL-101, the absorption peaks around 1411 and 1617 cm−1 can be ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric vibration corresponds to carboxylate presence in the MOF structure. The absorption band assigned to the CH(aliphatic) stretching mode and CN (aliphatic) stretching mode are observed at 2944 and 1078 cm−1, respectively [34]. The peaks at 3196 and 3400 cm−1 confirmed the presence of NH2 of ED in frameworks [35]. It is worth noting that the observed ν(NH) stretching vibrations (3196–3400 cm−1) are shifted to larger values (3422–3575 cm−1), as observed when the ED is stabilized upon interaction with Pd NPs [32,36]. Powder XRD (PXRD) was used to characterize the modified MIL101(Cr) structures. The comparability of the related peak pattern of Cr-MIL-101 with the results of previously reported [37] demonstrates the successful synthesis of the material. Fig. 2 depicts the XRD patterns of ED/Cr-MIL-101, Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101, and simulated MIL-101; XRD of ED/Cr-MIL101 and Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 are similar to the simulated pattern of MIL-101 [31]. Interestingly, the XRD patterns of ED/Cr-MIL-101 and Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 exhibit broad Bragg reflections, establishing the presence of small nanostructures [38]. In addition, after grafting of the ethylenediamine and loading the colloid palladium metal, the original crystal lattice of modified Cr-MIL-101 maintains intact during the process. The size and shape of diamine modified Cr-MIL-101 and Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 were examined by SEM (Fig. 3 ). SEM images of Cr-MIL-101 and the modified MOFs sample with the ED-Pd complex revealed the presence of octahedral microcrystals showing uniform particles. The SEM micrograph of the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 showed a highly stable structure and morphology even after post-modifications. The collected data from EDS analysis of the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 is displayed in Fig. 3c; chromium, carbon, and oxygen atoms exist in the structure and appearance of N-atoms and Pd indicates the high purity of Cr-MOFs of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101. Finally, SEM-EDS mapping results in Fig. 3f showed that each element (Cr, O, N, C, and Pd) is well dispersed on the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 structure. It is observed indicated that Pd NPs are distributed uniformly in the channel of the ED/Cr-MIL-101. The TEM images can provide more detail information that morphology and enables to view of the Pd NPs are well-distributed on the surface of the Cr-MOF. Fig. 4 depicted of the as-synthesized Cr-MIL-101 and modified Cr-MIL-101 with ED, revealing a typical octahedral morphology with a smooth surface and regular frameworks. The SEM (Fig. 3) and TEM (Fig. 4) images of the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 confirm the stability of the structure and even morphology after post-modifications ED grafting reaction. TEM image of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 clearly indicates a uniform deposition of ultra-small Pd nanoparticles into the channels of MOF. Based on this image, the average size of nanoparticles is mainly between 1 and 2.5 nm, according to TEM images (Fig. 4c and d). The size distribution histogram for Pd NPs (Fig. 4d, inset) shows a mean diameter of 1.8 ± 0.8 nm, which confirms that nanoparticles maintain its high monodispersity profile even after immobilization on the support. The porosity properties of the ED/Cr-MIL-101 and Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm at 77 K where Pd@Cr-MOFs exhibited a similar isotherm to that of OMS/Cr-MIL-101; both of them reflected the presence of the micro-size pores in the nanocrystalline structures (Fig. 5 a). The Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 had a surface area of 112 cm2/g−1, while the surface area of OMS/Cr-MIL-101 was 213 cm2/g−1. As calculated from the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, the pore diameter for Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 was 2.7 nm (Fig. 5b). The phenomenon is due to the presence of ED-Pd complex projecting into the MOF material. Finally, after the characterization of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101, this material was evaluated in the dehydrogenation of FA in the presence of ultrasonic waves. Hydrogen saturated FA dehydrogenation produces CO2 and H2, without the formation of intermediate products or multiple reactions [18,39]. To gauge the performance of Pd@Cr-MOFs for the dehydrogenation reaction, we utilize FA as the reaction substrate. These Pd-catalysts can generate H2 stoichiometrically (i.e. 1:1 H2:CO2), as shown in Eq. (1). (1) HCOOH (l) → H2 (g) + CO2 (g) G298K = −48.4 kJ mol−1 After investigating the synthetic method and determine the effect of the diamine functional groups on the catalytic performance, dehydrogenation of FA was performed using ultrasonic waves without the use of any additives. Catalytic reactions were performed with a series of Cr-MOFs in an aqueous solution containing formic acid (5 vol%, 5 mL-saturated). The exploration of the dehydrogenation progress with different solvents, such as MeOH, EtOH, DMF, MeCN, and H2O, revealed that H2O with 119.2 mL H2 gas and turnover frequency (TOF) of 525 h−1 was more efficient than the other solvent (Fig. 6 a). Using these pre-catalysts, CO generation was negligible, while H2 generation was well correlated with literature data [18,40] demonstrating the excellent H2 selectivity for FA dehydrogenation. Next step, by increasing the amount of the Pd-MOF from 0.05 g to 0.2 g, the H2 generation from FA was also increased (Fig. 6b). In addition, when the reaction was examined at various temperatures, it was observed that the dehydrogenation of FA accelerated from ambient condition to 328 K. Despite enhance H2 production yield at higher temperatures and based on room temperature importance in chemical processes and energy issues, we continued our studies in room temperature. By using this study, the Arrhenius plot of ln TOF versus 1/T for the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 was plotted in Fig. 6d; the activation energy (Ea) from experimental results was calculated to be approximately 29.3 KJ mol−1. Apart from the benign environmental perspective, dehydrogenation performance and effect of loading palladium nanoparticles in the framework of Cr-MOFs were studied based on the amount of generated gases and TOFs during the reaction (Fig. 7 a); their dehydrogenation was strongly depended on Pd immobilization in Cr-MOFs structures while Cr-MOFs without Pd were almost catalytic inactive. Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 exhibited extremely high catalytic activity with TOF value of 583 h−1 at 328 K. Considering the promising results obtained above, we decided to explore the effect of ultrasonic wave on the amount of generated gases during the reaction. As represented in (Fig. 7b), the activity of all Cr-MOFs samples was enhanced under ultrasonic wave; the Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 produced a large amount of H2 generation in comparison with that high-speed stirrer. Consequently, we suggest that the Cr-MOFs bearing diamine ligands for supporting Pd NPs in the presence of ultrasonic waves play an vital role in the catalytic decomposition of FA. Among the various Pd-based catalysts, Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 showed a TOF of 583 h−1 at 328 K, which is superior to that of most of the reported catalysts (Table 1 ). However, the TOF of Pd@ED/Cr-MIL-101 is lower than Pd0/CeO2 and homogeneous catalysts. The results demonstrate the high effects of ED ligand in comparison with other ligands and systems for stabilizing and keeping the Pd NPs in an active state in the Cr-MOF structure. On account of the above observations and the mechanism for dehydrogenation FA previously reported with variety nanostructure [52,53], a plausible catalyst cycle is proposed in Scheme 2 . According to that mechanism, the following reaction steps would take place: firstly, OH bond in FA cleavage, providing a proton (H+), and a Pd-formate (Pd-[HCOO]−) intermediate. In after step, Pd-[HCOO]− species undergo CH bond dissociation, affording a Pd hydride (Pd-[H]−), and CO2. Finally, the generation of H2 along with the regeneration of the Pd species takes place after the recombination of Pd-[H]− with a H+. Finally, to check the activities and stabilities of the Pd@MOFs for repeated runs, reusability tests were also performed by 20 mg Pd@diamine/Cr-MIL-101 under the same reaction conditions. As revealed in Fig. 8 , the activity was almost maintained for the first three cycles, suggesting that the Pd@Cr-MOFs was stable during the decomposition of FA. TEM images depicted the integrated structure of the solid catalyst and small Pd NPs aggregation after the reuse (Fig. 8b). These results also support the idea that the catalyst does not produce carbon monoxide. Chan et al. also reported that simple drying at an elevated temperature was highly efficient to regenerate PtRuBiOX/C [47] or Pd/C [39] catalyst, respectively."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we presented an ingenious strategy to the formation and stabilization of ultra-small palladium colloid on diamine-modified Cr-MIL-101. We have deployed a synthesis of OMS/Cr-MIL-101 by a unique method and its amine grafted counterpart as supports for preparing palladium catalysts. Then, selective dehydrogenation of formic acid was separately addressed via the Pd@diamine/Cr-MIL-101 under ultrasonic irradiation. Kinetic studies showed that Pd@MOFs/NH2(CH2)nNH2 (n = 2, 3) is highly active to catalyze the reaction in high efficiency. Detailed studies on the Pd@Cr-MOF pre-catalyst indicate that the porous structure of the Cr-MOF and synergistic effect of Pd metal and amine group in Cr-MIL-101 structure play crucial roles in the catalytic activity for H2 generation."
