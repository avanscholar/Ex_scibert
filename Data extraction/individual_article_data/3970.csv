0,Introduction,"Catalytic conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the most demanding reactions in organic synthesis and is widely used in the production of fine and specialty chemicals [1]. The classic process uses stoichiometric quantities of inorganic oxidants such as K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 in environmentally undesirable chlorinated solvents, which produces large amounts of toxic wastes [2]. Late, catalytic oxidation of alcohols using molecular oxygen (or air) has been developed as a green and environmental benign route [3,4]. In this contest, a large number of homogeneous and heterogeneous metal-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen have been reported [4–6], but their large-scale applications still suffers from the low selectivity and the safety problem relative to the use of flammable solvents. Recently, transfer dehydrogenation of alcohols is reported to be a green and efficient process, in which a readily available unsaturated organic molecule instead of oxygen is used as hydrogen acceptor. However, only few heterogeneous catalytic systems are known for alcohol transfer dehydrogenation, mainly relying on the use of noble metals like Pd [7–9] and Ru [10–13]. Unfortunately, these catalytic systems showed promising activities only for secondary aliphatic, aromatic or allylic alcohols, but they are much less active for primary aliphatic alcohols. Quite recently, Cu catalysts have been found to be highly effective for dehydrogenation of alcohols. Zaccheria et al. [14,15] reported that a Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was highly active for transfer dehydrogenation of non-activated secondary alcohols, but it was still less active for primary aliphatic alcohols. When used for 1-octanol, the yield of 1-octanal was only 4%. Kaneda and co-workers [16] revealed that Cu nanoparticles supported on hydrotalcite (Cu/HT) afforded excellent catalytic performance for acceptor-free dehydrogenation of benzylic and secondary aliphatic alcohols, but quite limited activity for dehydrogenation of primary aliphatic alcohols, like 1-heptanol, was observed. Up to now, the majority known catalysts are still poorly active for dehydrogenation of primary aliphatic alcohols. Here, we report that copper nanoparticles supported on basic MgO are highly efficient for transfer dehydrogenation of primary aliphatic alcohols to aldehydes. When used for 1-octanol, the typical representative of primary aliphatic alcohols, the yield of 1-octanal was as high as 58% at 423K because of the synergistic effect between the basicity of the support and the fast hydrogen spillover of Cu nanoparticles."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The MgO support was prepared by refluxing a commercially available MgO in water for 6h, followed by drying at 393K for 12h and calcination at 773K for 5h in air [17]. The Cu/MgO catalyst was then prepared by a deposition–precipitation method [18]. 1.5g MgO support was dispersed into 200ml water containing 0.41g Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O at room temperature. 0.1M K2CO3 aqueous solution was then gradually added until the pH value of the mixture approached 8.0. The precipitate was further aged in the mother liquid for 2h. After being filtered and washed thoroughly with water, the resultant solid was dried at 393K overnight and calcined at 723K for 4h in air, giving the CuO/MgO precursor. 200mg CuO/MgO sample was then loaded in a fixed-bed reactor and reduced with pure hydrogen (40mlmin−1) at 573K for 1h, yielding the Cu/MgO catalyst."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The actual loading of copper was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a Plasma-Spec-II instrument. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 instrument at 77K. Before the measurement, the sample was degassed at 573K for 3h. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/MAX 2500/PC powder diffractometer (Rigaku), using CuKα (1.5418Å) radiation operated at 40kV and 200mA. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin microscope. The specimen was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the sample powder in ethanol and drops of the suspension were deposited on a clean carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air. The temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) was conducted in a U-shape quartz reactor equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Fifty milligrams of CuO/MgO sample was initially treated at 673K for 1h under N2 flow (30mlmin−1). After cooled to room temperature, the sample was heated to 800K at a rate of 10Kmin−1 with the flow of a 5vol% H2/N2 (30mlmin−1). The dispersion of copper in the Cu/MgO catalyst was determined by N2O chemisorption [19]. Fifty milligrams of CuO/MgO sample was treated with a 20vol% O2/N2 mixture (30mlmin−1) at 673K for 0.5h and reduced with a flowing mixture of 5vol% H2/N2 mixture (30mlmin−1) at 673K for 1h. The sample was then exposed to a 10vol% N2O/He mixture at 363K for 0.5h. Subsequently, it was heated from room temperature to 573K at a rate of 5Kmin−1 with a flowing mixture of 5vol% H2/N2 (30mlmin−1). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on an ESCALAB MK-II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The sample was pressed into thin disc and pre-reduced with pure H2 at 573K for 1h and the spectra of Cu2p, CuL3VV were recorded. Charging effect was corrected by adjusting the binding energy of C 1s to 284.6eV. The temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) was conducted in a U-shape quartz reactor connected to a mass spectrometry (OmniStar 200). One hundred milligrams of CuO/MgO sample was pre-reduced with pure H2 at 573K. The sample was then exposed to a 30vol% CO2/He mixture (20mlmin−1) at room temperature for 0.5h. Then, it was heated to 1073K at a rate of 10Kmin−1 under He flow (30mlmin−1), and the desorption of CO2 was monitored by the mass spectrometry."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The transfer dehydrogenation of alcohols was conducted with a stainless steel autoclave (50ml). In a typical run, the reaction mixture contained 2mmol alcohol, 8mmol styrene, 200mg Cu/MgO catalyst and 8ml mesitylene. The reaction was done at 423K for a certain period (1–6h) under N2 atmosphere with magnetic stirring. The products were separated by centrifuging, and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent GC-7890T) using decane as an internal standard. The turnover frequency (TOF) was defined as the moles of product formed on per mole surface Cu per hour, and the dispersion of copper was determined by N2O chemisorption measurement."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the CuO/MgO sample. It exhibited characteristic diffractions of MgO (JCPDS 45-0946) and the crystalline size of magnesia was 5.8nm estimated from the (200) line. However, there was no diffraction of CuO, indicating that the copper species are highly dispersed on the surface of MgO and they are too small to be detected [20]. The specific surface area of the CuO/MgO sample was 163m2 g−1 and ICP analyses revealed that the actual loading of Cu was 7.2wt%. Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPR profile of the CuO/MgO sample. The main reduction peak at 440K was ascribed to the reduction of finely dispersed CuO species, while the minor reduction peak at 456K represented the reduction of CuO species that are strongly interacted with MgO [20,21]. The estimated amount of H2 consumed was 1.21mmolg−1, which is very close to the stoichiometric value (1.13mmolg−1) required for the reduction of CuO to metallic copper. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the Cu/MgO catalyst. MgO particles with size of 5–15nm were uniformly distributed with the coexistence of small amounts of lamella-like layers. Cu particles with size of 3–4nm were homogeneously dispersed on the surface of MgO. N2O dissociative chemisorption measurement further revealed that the mean size of copper particle was 2.9nm, corresponding to a dispersion of about 35%. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Cu 2p and CuL3VV Auger of the Cu/MgO catalyst. The absence of satellite peaks and the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 at 931.3eV evidenced that copper was presented as Cu0 or Cu+. The kinetic energy of CuL3VV at 918.8eV further confirmed that Cu0 was the main species in the catalyst [22]. Fig. 5 shows the CO2-TPD profile of the Cu/MgO catalyst. CO2 desorption occurred at 362, 423, and 517K, indicating that there are three types of adsorption sites for CO2 with varying basic strength. Most likely, the low temperature desorption corresponded to CO2 (bicarbonate species) adsorbed on the weak basic sites (OH groups); while the desorptions at 423 and 517K represented CO2 adsorptions on the medium (Mg–O2− pairs) and strong basic (O2− ions) sites, respectively [23]. Furthermore, the relative amounts of desorbed CO2 were 13.8%, 35.6%, and 50.6%, respectively. This shows that the medium (Mg–O2− pairs) and strong basic (O2− ions) sites are more abundant on the surface of MgO. Table 1 summarizes the reaction results of transfer dehydrogenation of alcohols on the Cu/MgO catalyst and Scheme 1 illustrates the reaction route. 1-Octanol, which is a representative of primary aliphatic alcohols, was readily and selectively converted into 1-octanal with a yield of 58% at 423K and a TOF of 5.0h−1. This exceptionally high yield of 1-octanal on the current Cu/MgO catalyst is quite remarkable for transfer dehydrogenation of 1-octanol when compared with the recent results obtained on Ru/AlO(OH) (23% at 383K) [13], Cu/Al2O3 (4% at 363K) [14,15], and Ag/HT (17% at 403K) [24]. When used for 1-hexanol, the yield of 1-hexanal reached 45%, further confirming that the Cu/MgO catalyst is highly active for transfer dehydrogenation of primary aliphatic alcohols. The Cu/MgO catalyst also showed high efficiency for transfer dehydrogenation of other alcohols. Seventy-five percent yield of benzyl aldehyde was obtained by dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol with a TOF of 9.6h−1. This reaction was previously conducted using a Pd/C catalyst and only 43% yield of benzyl aldehyde was achieved at 323K in 4days [7], while a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst gave 18% yield of benzyl aldehyde at 353K for 15h [9]. In the case of 1-phenyethanol, the yield of acetophenone was 99.5% and the TOF was as high as 25.4h−1, which is much higher than those reported for Cu/Al2O3 [14,15] and Cu/HT [16] catalysts. In addition, the Cu/MgO catalyst is also highly effective for dehydrogenation of secondary aliphatic alcohols. 2-Octanol was almost quantitatively converted to 2-octanone with a TOF of 25.3h−1. However, this reaction took 15h at 383K on Ru/AlO(OH) [13], 4h at 353K with Cu/Al2O3 [14,15], and 6h at 403K over Cu/HT [16]. Alicyclic alcohols such as cycloheptanol and cyclooctanol were also successfully converted to ketones with yields of almost 100% within 1h. More importantly, the Cu/MgO catalyst can be recovered easily from the reaction media by simple centrifugation, washed with acetone and then reused for the next run. Recycle test for dehydrogenation of cyclooctanol indicated that the Cu/MgO catalyst could show rather stable performance and the yield of cyclooctanone was more than 99% for 5 runs. Blank test using the MgO support alone for 1-octanol dehydrogenation resulted in less than 1% yield of 1-octanal at 423K for 5h, implying the essential role of Cu nanoparticles. Probably, the Cu/MgO catalyst follows a bifunctional mechanism in transfer dehydrogenation of alcohols, where both the Cu nanoparticles and the basic sites on the MgO support are responsible for the high activity. The basic sites of MgO with nucleophilic reactivity extract a proton from alcohol, forming a negatively charged reactive intermediate (alkoxide). Then, the extraction of α-hydrogen from the alkoxide intermediate occurs on the Cu particle or the Cu–MgO interface, producing aldehyde or ketone. Simultaneously, the Cu nanoparticle catalyzes the hydrogenation of styrene effectively based on the fast hydrogen spillover and the facile release of hydrogen from its surface. Therefore, the basic sites of MgO are mainly responsible for proton abstraction from alcohol and the Cu patches promote the C–H dissociation in the reactive intermediate and the hydrogenation of styrene."
6,Conclusions,"The Cu/MgO catalyst is highly efficient and reusable for transfer dehydrogenation of primary aliphatic alcohols. When used for 1-octanol, the yield of 1-octanal could be as high as 58%. This catalyst can be reused without appreciable loss in activity and selectivity. The excellent catalytic property is attributed to the synergistic effect between the basicity of MgO and the hydrogen spillover effect of the Cu nanoparticles. The basic sites of MgO extract proton from alcohol and the Cu particle favors the release of α-hydrogen from the reactive intermediate and simultaneously catalyzes the hydrogenation of styrene."
