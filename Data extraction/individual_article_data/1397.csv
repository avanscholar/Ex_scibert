0,Introduction,"The rising problems of global warming and fossil fuels depletion have led to innovative technologies for producing clean energy. Bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis is a complex mixture of oxygenated hydrocarbons (acetic acid, methanol, aldehydes, ketones, cyclopentenones, furans, alkyl-phenols, alkyl-methoxy-phenols, anhydrosugars, and oligomeric sugars derived from biopolymer structures), which may contain 15–30 wt.% water [1]. As a previous step for upgrading, bio-oil can be fractionated into two phases by adding water. The oil phase is rich in organic compounds and it could be further upgraded to biofuels by a hydrothermal process. The aqueous phase has 70–80 wt.% water [2,3] with low-molecular-weight organic compounds, such as alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids. The water-rich phase is less valuable and its valorization has been sought during the last years. Due to the relative low content of the organic compounds, the cost of extraction techniques is too high. In fact, if large amounts of bio-oil aqueous phase were produced this stream might be considered as waste. However, it may be valorized by a suitable process. As a valorization alternative, hydrogen production via catalytic reforming has been explored [4–6], but this type of process is energy-intensive due to the large amount of water that must be evaporated. Supercritical water reforming (SCWR) is an emerging thermo-chemical process that can convert wet biomass and organic wastes into syngas and hydrogen without vaporizing water. This way, SCWR reduces the energy requirement with respect to other reforming processes, thus overcoming the energy barrier. SCWR involves reactions of organic compounds in water medium at supercritical state, which is highly beneficial for reaction rates [7–9]. Indeed, SCW is more and more used. Recently, the upgrading of bio-oils by the reforming in supercritical water to produce gaseous and liquid biofuels has been studied [10,11]. Additionally, we have verified that SCWR of glycerol can be successfully performed with and without catalyst, and in such a way that an energy self-sufficient process with no external fuel can be performed [12–14]. Recently, we have studied the SCWR of four model compounds (acetic acid, acetol (hydroxyacetone), 1-butanol and glucose) in the absence of a catalyst. These compounds are representative of the main oxygenate organics present in the aqueous fraction of bio-oil [15]. Although high conversions were obtained, gas yields were far from equilibrium. We hypothesized that a kinetic limitation occurred during the gasification of liquids and the subsequent methane reforming under supercritical conditions. Therefore, the use of a catalyst would allow higher gas yields, especially, an increase in the hydrogen production. The main aim and novelty of the present study is the assessment of the hydrogen production from SCWR of the above-mentioned four organic constituents of the bio-oil aqueous fraction over a Ni-based commercial catalyst. The reaction rate of the SCWR of those compounds to hydrogen expressed as turnover frequency (TOF), which is based on the number of active sites, is another objective. The kinetics results are described as rate equations and the Arrhenius parameters (normalized pre-exponential factor and apparent activation energy) are obtained. This quantitative measurement of catalyst activity is very important to compare the results with those expected from the likely rate-determining step and with others obtained in similar studies. The paper also provides the effect of temperature (500–800 °C), feed concentration (2.5–22.5 wt.%), and weight-hourly space velocity (2.5–22.5 gorg-comp h−1 gcat −1) on the hydrogen production. In addition, the experimental results are compared with those obtained without adding a catalyst and with simulation results obtained using a non-stoichiometric approach by Aspen Plus (assuming equilibrium), as well as with other findings from previous studies. The use of a catalyst allows the increase in the reaction rate and the decrease in the reforming temperature, thus reducing the energy requirement."
1,Methodology,
2,Experimental section,"2.1 Experimental section The experiments were carried out with acetic acid (>99.7% purity), hydroxyacetone (>95.0% purity), 1-butanol (>99.4% purity) and glucose (>99.5% purity), as well as with deionized water. A commercial Ni-based catalyst supported on Al2O3 and SiO2 with 66 wt.% Ni (Sigma-Aldrich 208779) was used. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of fresh Ni catalyst and Ni catalyst exposed to SCW (without reforming). Metal content was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ultima 2). The BET surface area along with the areas and volumes of micropores and mesopores were obtained by means of physisorption using nitrogen as an adsorptive agent (Micromeritics ASAP 2420 System). Structural information on an atomic scale of both crystalline and non-crystalline (amorphous) materials was acquired using XRD (Bruker D8 Advance A25 equipment). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to distinguish the different oxidation states of catalyst (ESCA Phoibos HSA3500 150 MCD-9). Regarding the analysis of liquid samples, the total organic carbon (TOC) was obtained by an analyzer Shimadzu TOC-VCSH with an auto sampler ASI-V. Concentrations of acetic acid and acetol were measured by a mass spectrometer with quadrupole analyzer Agilent 5977A and using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Agilent 7890B) for polar capillary columns (Sapiens-5MS (30 m–0.25 mm–0.25 μm), Teknokroma). Heating ramps at temperatures from 60 to 300 °C for 24 min were performed in the analysis method. The glucose was measured in the same equipment but using a non-polar column (19091 S-433U HP-5MS UI (30 m–0.25 mm–0.25 μm)), where glucose had to be previously derivatized with MBTFA and a spectral deconvolution program was applied. The analysis method was performed at temperatures from 80 to 280 °C using heating ramps for 37.5 min and the mass range (m/z) was between 30 and 475. A diagram of the experimental plant is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The aqueous solution of model compounds was pumped and heated to the operating temperature by an electrical tubular furnace housing the reactor (2.0 m length; 7.92 mm ID). The product gas leaving the reformer was cooled down to 40 °C and the condensate (mostly water) was expanded through a back-pressure valve. Next, the condensate was separated from the gas in a knockout drum. The mass flow-rate of the gas stream was measured and a sample of this stream was continuously analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A). The tests were conducted for 3–6 h. The two catalyst loads were 10 and 20 g, which occupied about 200 and 400 mm inside reactor arranged at 700 and 500 mm from the reactor outlet, respectively. Catalyst was capped with pieces of glass fiber, and it was not reduced before testing. The material of reactor (made of Inconel 625, with a high content in nickel) did not exhibit catalytic activity, because the reactor was sufficiently aged after having been operating for more than 2000 h in previous tests. All the experiments were conducted at 240 bar. The furnace temperature varied between 500 and 800 °C, and the weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV), defined as the mass flow-rate of organic model compound (‘omc’) divided by the mass of catalyst (‘cat’), ranged from 2.5 to 22.5 gomc h−1 gcat −1 by changing the feed concentration, pumping a feed flow-rate of 1.0 L/h. The feeding mixtures compositions contained acetol, 1-butanol and/or glucose (from 2.5 to 5.0 wt.%), as well as acetic acid (from 5.0 to 15.0 wt.%). The most concentrated mixture of model compounds was 22.5 wt.%, which is a representative value of bio-oil aqueous fraction. The hydrogen yield was computed as follows: (1) η H 2 = N H 2 Σ i N i , f e e d where N denotes the number of moles of the compound referred in the subscript. Likewise, the organic compound conversion is the result obtained by dividing the difference between moles of organic compound fed to the reactor and those present in the liquid by the moles of organic compound fed to the reactor. Equally, the carbon-to-gas (-liquid or -solid) efficiency is obtained by dividing the moles of gas (liquid or solid) carbon by the carbon moles fed to the reactor. Carbon balance was calculated from the carbon content in the feed, and the total carbon found in the gaseous and liquid products; the result was taken away from the solid carbon residue, and the difference was the experimental error. Most of the tests were replicated twice or three times, and those with an average error in the carbon balance less than 10% were considered as valid experiments."
3,Catalyst activity measurement,"2.2 Catalyst activity measurement The catalyst turnover frequency (TOF) was obtained by performing a selective H2-chemisorption (AutoChem II 2920 Micromeritics instrument equipped with a TCD detector) where the metal dispersion (fraction of the surface metal with respect to the total metal in the catalyst), the active surface area and the average active particle size were attained. Although the catalyst was not reduced before performing the tests, the catalyst was completely reduced after reforming, as described in Section 3.5. The reason is because hydrogen is produced during the supercritical water reforming even in the absence of catalyst, as previously verified [12,15,16]. This way, the catalyst is reduced by the hydrogen produced during the beginning of the supercritical reforming process, and a self-reducing catalytic process is achieved. Thus, the activity evaluation was performed on the fresh catalyst and the catalyst after being exposed to SCW for 2 h under reaction conditions. In these tests, the catalyst was firstly reduced in situ at the operating temperature using a stream of 10% H2 diluted in Ar (50 mL/min, ramp rate 10 °C/min, holding time of 60 min), because the catalyst was reduced over the supercritical reforming process, as above mentioned. Then, the catalyst was cleaned with Ar (50 mL/min, at 40 °C, ramp rate 20 °C/min for 30 min) to remove residual hydrogen and any other impurity, such as moisture. Lastly, the H2 pulse chemisorption was carried out at 40 °C by injection pulses of 10 vol.% H2/Ar (0.5 cm3) every 3 min until the consumption peaks became stable. The selected chemisorption stoichiometry was H/Nis = 1/1 [17]. TOF values were calculated as site-time yields for the monometallic catalyst based on the metal dispersion, and defined as the number of molecules of a specific product made (H2) per active catalytic site per unit time. The TOF (time−1) relative to the reforming reaction was specifically defined as the number of moles of H2 (mol s−1) produced per mole of accessible surface metal atoms present in the reactor during the supercritical water reforming of the organic compounds, as described by Eq. (2): (2) T O F ( H 2 ) = m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d p e r u n i t t i m e m o l e s o f s u r f a c e m e t a l i n t h e r e a c t o r where the metal mass in the catalyst and the metal dispersion on the catalyst are considered."
4,Equilibrium calculations,"2.3 Equilibrium calculations Chemical equilibrium calculations were performed by Aspen Plus™ to compare them with the experimental results. The thermodynamic method was the predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK), which is the most suitable to describe the supercritical state [15,18]. For these calculations, different mixtures of acetic acid, acetol (or hydroxyacetone), 1-butanol and glucose were used, so the conversion and the carbon-to-gas efficiency of these mixtures were always 100% at equilibrium for all the operating conditions simulated. In this way, simulations did not predict coke formation for any of the experimental conditions tested in this paper. The supercritical water reforming reactor was simulated as an R-Gibbs reactor to obtain the outlet stream composition and the heat of the overall reaction by minimizing the Gibbs free energy at equilibrium. It is a non-stoichiometric approach, where a selection of the possible set of reactions is not necessary and does not require any initial estimation of the equilibrium."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Process performance,"3.1 Process performance In the tests carried out using 20 g of catalyst, the carbon to gas efficiency was 100% in many experiments at 800 °C, and higher than 95% in almost all the tests; with 10 g, these values lowered to 90%. At 600 °C, these efficiencies were also very high, decreasing less than 5% with respect to the corresponding values at 800 °C. However, carbon-to-gas efficiencies of 85% were achieved at 500 °C, although values between 70–75% and 80% were attained in some tests. Almost all the product gas (>98 vol.%) was always H2, CO2, CO and CH4. However, in a few tests, a very small concentration of C2 was detected (<2 vol.%), which was identified as ethylene or ethane. Likewise, carbon-to-solid efficiency was less than 0.6%. The minimum practical temperature for glucose and its mixtures with other model compounds was set at 600 °C, because the reforming was not feasible at 500–550 °C [16]. Regarding the model compounds separately fed to the reactor, Fig. 2 a depicts the gas product yields at different temperatures (500–800 °C) and 240 bar, using 5 wt.% acetic acid. The two WHSV were 2.5 and 5 gac.acid h−1 gcat −1, which correspond to 20 g and 10 g of catalyst, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the same for 15 wt.% acetic acid (WHSV of 7.5 and 15 gac.acid h−1 gcat −1). The solids lines represent equilibrium values. Likewise, Fig. 3 illustrates the gas product yields for a concentration of 5 wt.% acetol (a), 1-butanol (b) and glucose (c). Similarly, Fig. 4 illustrates the gas product yields at different temperatures and 240 bar, corresponding to ternary mixtures (of three model compounds), using 2.5 wt.% for acetol, 1-butanol and glucose, and 15 wt.% for acetic acid. These case-studies involve WHSV values of 10 and 20 gomc h−1 gcat −1, for 20 g and 10 g of catalyst, respectively. Fig. 5 represents a quaternary mixture of 15 wt.% acetic acid, and 2.5 wt.% for acetol, 1-butanol and glucose, thus resulting in WHSV values of 11.25 and 22.5 gomc h−1 gcat −1. The organic substances detected in the liquid samples are, mainly, non-converted acetic acid and glucose at 500 and 600 °C. From TOC analysis, carbon-to-liquid efficiency was lower than 0.15% for tests at 800 °C, increasing to 1.0–4.3% (the latter for quaternary mixtures using 10 g catalyst) at 600 °C, and 8–12% at 500 °C. The mixture of organic compounds entering the reactor in aqueous solution undergoes a progressive thermal decomposition through reaction intermediates. In supercritical water (SCW), at lower densities and higher temperatures, free radical reactions are favored [19]. SCW can have a significant effect on the kinetics of some radical reactions, directly as a solvent and/or indirectly as a reactant in many reactions involved in the overall SCWR process. Near the reactor entrance, organic compounds are converted to some intermediates, and then, the reactions with free-radicals lead to bond cleavage (CC, OH and CH). This way, small compounds, such as acids, alcohols and aldehydes are progressively formed, and then converted into gases. Hydrogen atoms released from SCW molecules speed up the intramolecular bond rupture of reactants. Thus, glucose may follow various pathways to give CO and H2 if glycolaldehyde is mainly produced, or less H2 and more CH4 if glyceraldehyde is produced, or even CO2 and CH4 if the pathway is through pyruvaldehyde or by decomposition of acetic acid formed from acetaldehyde. Similarly, if acetic acid is fed, it may lead to equimolar formation of CO2 and CH4. Hydroxyacetone decomposes to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, which form CO, H2 and CH4, and 1-butanol may form CO, CH4 and ethylene. The latter reforms to H2, CH4 and CO [15]. Finally, once small acids, aldehydes and alcohols are converted into gas, CH4 yield is initially higher than H2 yield, which increases as CH4 is reformed by SCW. Likewise, hydrogen production increases as the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction takes place. The detected CH4 must have been formed from intermediates, but methane reforming is not fast enough to obtain high hydrogen yields in the reactor. The presence of an effective catalyst boosts the intermediates conversion to gas as well as the methane reforming, thus improving the process performance. Ni-based catalyst is a good candidate as it is used for methane steam reforming. This catalyst would promote the CH bond cleavage under SCW conditions. The very low CO concentrations might be explained if the WGS were faster than methane reforming. However, the CO yield was lower than the equilibrium values for all the tests, both with and without adding a catalyst. Therefore, the very low CO yields cannot be explained only based on a fast WGS. Thus, a further clarification is needed. In this way, as SCW becomes a strong oxidant, especially at high temperature, oxygen from hydroxyl radicals of SCW can be moved towards the carbon atoms of small feedstock intermediates that would be favorably oxidized into CO2 in an irreversible way. Thus, during conversion of small acids, aldehydes and alcohols into gas, decarboxylation must occur in a higher extent than decarbonylation, so less CO is formed. The produced CO is quickly converted into CO2 and H2 by WGS. In addition, the performance was slightly worse for mixtures because H2 yields were lower than those obtained for compounds fed to the reactor separately. This result is due to the higher number of intermediates that may be formed when feeding a mixture of several compounds, which involve more reactions or compounds harder to reform. Mixtures promote interactions through acetic acid, since it is hardly reformed and can be produced as an intermediate [16]. As a consequence, the gas production is delayed with respect to the case of feeding pure compounds. However, the effect was not as significant as for the non-catalytic SCWR [16] thanks to the high catalyst activity. 3.1.1 Effect of the temperature The gas yields from reforming of organic compounds increased with temperature, as predicted by equilibrium. In general, deviations of gas yields with respect to equilibrium are lower as the temperature increases. However, the evolution is not the same for all the model compounds. Thus, the catalyst has a very positive effect for acetic acid, so gas yields are very close to equilibrium when using 20 g (and even 10 g) of catalyst. However, the deviations are higher for 1-butanol. The performance for acetol SCWR is in the middle of that obtained for acetic acid and 1-butanol. For glucose, the process could not be performed at 500 °C, the deviation with respect to equilibrium is significant at 600 °C, but the approach to equilibrium is almost perfect at 800 °C. Thus, a high temperature is crucial for a suitable glucose SCWR. CO2 yields are very close to the corresponding equilibrium lines, and even above them, probably due to the irreversible oxidation of a fraction of carbon, as above pointed out. The deviations of H2 and CH4 yields with respect to those at equilibrium are clearly related each other, in such a way that if CH4 were reformed at maximum, H2 yield would be closer to equilibrium. It is more evident at low temperature and catalyst load, i.e., at higher WHSV. Indeed, experimental CH4 yields are usually higher than those predicted by equilibrium, due to an insufficient conversion during its reforming. It is valid if high reactant conversion is achieved, but not if conversion was not high enough because CH4 would not be totally formed during the incomplete feed decomposition under SCW conditions, which occurs at low temperature. 3.1.2 Effect of the space velocity In Figs. 2–5, gas yields increase as the WHSV decreases, becoming very close to equilibrium. Thus, the gas yields were higher using 20 g of catalyst and low total concentration of organic phase. However, the total molar flow-rate of gas increases with the WHSV for the same catalyst load, due to the higher concentration of organic feed. Similarly, if the total feed concentration is the same, the gas flow-rate is higher at lower WHSV, corresponding to a higher catalyst load. A large amount of catalyst results in a lower WHSV for the same mass flow-rate that allows a closer approach to equilibrium, thus lowering the deviations. Nevertheless, the acceptable values of space velocity for a feed concentration depend on the organic compound or mixture fed to the reactor, and low values are needed for those compounds or mixtures harder to reform. In case of acetic acid (5 and 15 wt.%), a value of up to 7.5 gac.acid h−1 gcat −1 is acceptable; the deviation from the equilibrium is greater if the WHSV is doubled. For 1-butanol, the limit for a satisfactory WHSV would be 2.5 gbutanol h−1 gcat −1, while a value of 5.0 leads to a higher deviation from the equilibrium. The latter value could be adequate for hydroxyacetone, because it is easily reformed. For glucose, values of 2.5 and 5.0 gglucose h−1 gcat −1 are equally perfect, but at 800 °C. When feeding mixtures, WHSV values of up to 10 gomc h−1 gcat −1 are acceptable, except for mixture involving 1-butanol, for which it should be lower than 10. It is because of the mixing effect, i.e., the interactions taking place due to the higher number of intermediates formed during the process. Therefore, the latter WHSV value might be suitable for a potential aqueous phase of bio-oil. Higher values of WHSV would not allow the complete methane reforming with SCW, and hydrogen yield could be far from the maximum achievable. 3.1.3 Effect of the feed concentration The decrease in gas yields and, specifically, hydrogen yield with the feed concentration follow the same trend as at equilibrium. The methane yield increases while the hydrogen yield decreases when the organic feed concentration rises, i.e., if the water-to-carbon (W/C) ratio decreases. A higher organic compound concentration lessens the shift toward the right side of overall reforming reaction due to the lower water surplus. Therefore, a low W/C molar ratio does not favor the conversion to the gas products. Likewise, the CO yield increases and the CO2 yield decreases as the feed concentration increases. The reason is due to the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, which promotes the conversion of CO to CO2 and H2 if the water amount is high, as predicted by equilibrium. Thus, a higher water proportion shifts the WGS reaction to the products. Moreover, a higher W/C ratio would also allow a more complete CH4 reforming. However, a too great W/C ratio involves a higher energy demand, which is a serious constraint for a scale-up of this process, where the energy self-sufficiency should be pursued. In addition, the effect of feed concentration is linked to space velocity and model compound or mixture, as observed for different acetic acid concentrations, when fed separately (Fig. 2). In contrast, for acetol, 1-butanol and glucose, there is no influence between feeding 2.5 or 5 wt.% at a temperature and catalyst mass, since both values involve very diluted solutions. Moreover, for diluted mixtures of 5 wt.%, the above-mentioned interactions are not significant. In general, the process performance is good at 800 °C and WHSV related to 20 g catalyst, i.e., lower than 11.25 gomc h−1 gcat −1. As aforementioned, the space velocity should be somewhat lower due to the mixing effect."
7,Comparison with the SCWR process without adding a catalyst,"3.2 Comparison with the SCWR process without adding a catalyst The process performance without and with catalyst (both using 10 and 20 g) at 240 bar 800 °C and 1.0 L/h is depicted in Fig. 6 . For the same feed concentration and composition, H2 yield is higher with 20 g catalyst than with 10 g, and much higher than that obtained without catalyst, under the same operating conditions. Thus, gas yields are closer to equilibrium (simulation results) as a larger amount of catalyst is used and, hence, at lower WHSV values. The highest differences between using 10 or 20 g are obtained at high feed concentration of ternary and quaternary mixtures, due to the combined effect of mixing, feed concentration and WHSV. Likewise, experimental H2 yields relatively close to equilibrium, although somewhat farther from it than at 800 °C, were obtained in many tests with the Ni-based catalyst at 600 °C or without catalyst but operating at 800 °C (these results are not shown in Fig. 6 to avoid enlarge the paper excessively). Consequently, the use of this catalyst makes it possible to reduce the temperature in 200 °C with respect to the non-catalytic process to achieve a similar H2 production. However, a lower temperature leads to lower H2 and higher CH4 productions, as stated by equilibrium. Therefore, the Ni-based catalyst promotes the SCW reforming of the model compounds and their mixtures. Previously [15,16], at 800 °C, we have verified that cleavage of the CC bond occurs during the decomposition of compounds under SCW conditions, even in the absence of catalyst, which, however, promotes such scission as exhibited by the low TOC values found in the tests. Moreover, the cleavage of OH bond takes place in this medium. However, the cleavage of CH bond of methane occurs slowly, and it is likely the limiting kinetic step. The Ni-based catalyst boosts this reaction, thus increasing the final H2 yield."
8,Comparison with the results of other studies,"3.3 Comparison with the results of other studies The catalytic hydrothermal conversion of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil to hydrogen or methane-rich syngas has been investigated in a few previous studies, with low concentrations, where any attempt to increase the feed concentration resulted in poor conversion and difficulties due to tar formation or reactor clogging during the continuous operation, where the maximum operating temperature was 650 °C. Moreover, tests in batch reactors have led to low carbon gasification efficiencies and the reduction in hydrogen yields [11]. In contrast, we achieved a good process performance in a continuous tubular fixed-bed reactor for ternary and quaternary mixtures of up to 20.0 and 22.5 wt.% at 600–800 °C, with high hydrogen yields. On the other hand, the valorization of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil by catalytic steam reforming has been also studied. Thus, the most favorable conditions for steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction to produce hydrogen using a Ni/Mo-sepiolite catalyst were a reaction temperature of 700–800 °C, a steam/carbon ratio of 16–18 (i.e., a very dilute concentration), a space velocity of 1.5–2.2 h−1; the maximum H2 yield was 67.5% at 800 °C [5]. Other researchers tested a feed concentration of 16 wt.% at 650 °C using a Ni/Al catalyst prepared by coprecipitation in the laboratory [6]. Reported hydrogen yields were close to equilibrium (about 80% of maximum value) taking into account a carbon-to-gas efficiency less than 83% for the minimum WHSV (12 gomc h−1 gcat −1). In addition, a large amount of carbonaceous deposits was formed over the catalyst bed because compounds did not evaporate completely before coming into contact with the catalyst, making the operation of the reactor more unstable over time and eventually leading to a complete clogging of the reactor. The production of gases and their composition were favored at 700 °C but, contrary to that expected, it decreased at 800 °C. Later, these researchers verified that the incorporation of Ce to the catalysts reduced the deactivation of Ni-based catalysts used in the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil [20]. Therefore, the steam reforming of the aqueous fraction seems to be feasible, but the energy required to evaporate the water is higher than that required by SCWR, as previously proven [14,18]. In addition, a better behavior was obtained in the SCWR process regarding the carbon-to-gas efficiency and hydrogen yields using a Ni-based commercial catalyst."
9,Activity of catalyst,"3.4 Activity of catalyst Catalyst activity was normalized per exposed surface metal atom, i.e., turnover rate or frequency (TOF), which is defined at a specific temperature, feed concentration and conversion. Table 2 shows the TOF values for hydrogen formation of experiments carried out with the four model compounds separately fed to the reactor, at different concentrations and catalyst loads, and for ternary and quaternary mixtures of those model compounds. The TOF values are calculated based on fresh catalyst. At any value of WHSV, the TOF increases when increasing the temperature, for any feed concentration and composition. Similarly, at any temperature, the TOF increases with the WHSV value when increasing the reactant(s) concentration(s), which could be explained if the methane reforming were the rate-determining step (rds). It is the step farther from equilibrium that is coupled with other steps near equilibrium rather than the slowest step (as in case of the absence of catalyst), if all steps turn over at the same rate. All the TOF values were about 0.04–0.67 s−1, somewhat higher than many of those found in commercial catalysts [21]. Besides, as they were lower than 1 s−1, there were no diffusional limitations inside or outside the catalyst grains [22]. On average, a dispersion of 2.05% was found for the catalyst, using an atomic cross-sectional area of 0.0649 nm2 for Ni (from the normal (111) plane). The active surface area was 32.98 m2/gmetal and active particle size (crystallites) was 49.49 nm. The low metal dispersion is likely due to the high metal loading in catalyst that leads to metal particle agglomeration. As the TOF values capture kinetic results, the apparent activation energy (Ea ) and the pre-exponential factor (A) values were obtained by the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)): (3) T O F ( H 2 ) = A e x p ( − E a R T ) Fig. 7 depicts the Arrhenius plots from which the values of Ea and A (extrapolated from the ordinate values at 1/RT = 0) were obtained for all the model compounds fed separately to the reactor, as well as for ternary and quaternary mixtures of model compounds. Table 3 shows the corresponding apparent activation energies and pre-exponential factors, as well as the corresponding coefficients of determination. Apparent activation energy was minimum for acetol and maximum for glucose, while that was intermediate for 1-butanol and acetic acid. It is coherent with the ease of reforming of each compound and mixtures (Figs. 2–5). Likewise, apparent activation energy is quite dependent on reactant concentration, as can be seen for acetic acid. Thus, when increasing concentration (and, hence, WHSV), the Arrhenius parameters increased, since the gas product yields were close to equilibrium under the operating window. This way, a higher concentration involves a higher number of collisions that might lead to reaction but also a higher energy barrier for reactions. In addition, based on Langmuir adsorption isotherm, at high feed concentration, more reactant molecules are adsorbed and react on catalyst surface, so the apparent activation energy either becomes the true activation energy or is closer to it. Indeed, equilibrium favors the adsorbed molecules and the barrier to be overcome is even higher that at low concentrations, where not all the molecules are adsorbed and the heat of adsorption of the reactants must be considered along with the activation energy. Besides, if the methane reforming under SCW conditions were the rds, as hypothesized, probably the rate constant obtained would be due to that step [15]. Moreover, as the dissociative adsorption of water to H and OH species takes place initially when the water achieves the supercritical state (because of its loss of hydrogen bonding), and the combination of OH or O species with C forms CO, and subsequently the WGS reaction and oxidation occur rapidly, the decomposition of CH4 on a metal surface to carbon atoms (CH bond scission) must be the real rds. In this study, activation energies were lower than those reported for CH4 steam reforming over Ni-based catalyst [21]. On the other hand, by performing the selective H2-chemisorption at ambient pressure but with the catalyst exposed to SCW (i.e., after passing supercritical water through the catalyst for about two hours at a temperature ranged from 600 to 800 °C and a pressure of 240 bar), it is possible to express the catalytic activity under more representative conditions. Thus, the dispersion values were 1.19% at 600 °C and 0.81% at 800 °C. These lower values of the fraction of exposed metal might be due to a re-dispersion caused by microstructural changes, as below explained. Nevertheless, even comprising only a small fraction of the total Ni in the catalyst, the exposed Ni particles allows a high activity. Therefore, the SCW (240 bar and 600–800 °C) affects the catalyst characteristics, and the number of ostensible active catalytic sites changes, thus varying the TOF value that would have to be multiplied by a factor of 1.7 for the tests at 600 °C or 2.5 for tests at 800 °C, which are very significant increases."
10,Catalyst characterization,"3.5 Catalyst characterization As can be seen in Table 1, the physical properties of the catalyst changed after exposing it under SCW at high temperature, taking place a redistribution of porosity and a change in the BET superficial area. Moreover, from XRD analysis (Fig. 8 ), a large increase in crystalline phase (from 78.9 to 84.5%) was obtained when exposing at SCW. However, these properties did not change for the catalyst after being used in the supercritical water reforming process, except the oxidation state of the active metal, as verified by XPS analyses. The nickel present in the catalyst was almost oxidized as NiO with minor fraction of metallic nickel, while the nickel on the catalyst after reforming was completely reduced. Thus, diffractograms present high peaks at around 2θ angles of 44.4° and 51.8° (96.3% crystalline) attributed to the metallic Ni phase (Ni(0)) [23]. The formation of Ni (nano)crystals dispersed on support is probably related to the very high activity of catalyst. Besides, the reduction of nickel increases the interaction metal-support and improves the resistance of the active phase to sintering, thus increasing the catalyst stability [24]. In addition, the reduction of the bulk Ni particles results in a lattice contraction, possibly with the generation of cracks and voids that provide Ni sites with high activity. It suggests the presence of structure sensitivity for SCW reforming over Ni when these highly active sites are present [25]."
11,Conclusions,"The reforming of four model compounds of bio-oil aqueous phase was carried out under SCW conditions over a commercial supported catalyst based on Ni. The organic constituents were entered the reactor both separately and in mixtures. The conversions were very high (complete in many tests), and the product gas yields were very close to equilibrium. The effect of different operating parameters on the hydrogen yield was obtained and discussed, so high temperatures, low space velocities and feed concentration favor the H2 yields. In addition, the catalytic activity was normalized by the number of exposed metal atoms, and relatively high turnover rates (TOF) were obtained. Based on fresh catalyst, the apparent activation energies ranged from 29.4 to 45.9 kJ/mol, corresponding to acetol (5 wt.%) and acetic acid (15 wt.%). At any temperature (500–800 °C), the TOF increases with the space velocity when increasing the reactant(s) concentration(s). Likewise, a higher apparent activation energy involves a harder reforming, and that increases with the feed concentration, which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Finally, the methane reforming is assumed as the rate-determining step."
