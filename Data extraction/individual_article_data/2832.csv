0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is widely deemed as an ideal substitute for fossil fuels because of its high energy density and clean product after combustion (Lu et al., 2012; Montpart et al., 2015). Dark (light independent) fermentation is desirable since it can convert the substrate into hydrogen at a higher rate compared with the other biological hydrogen production methods (Xiao et al., 2013). To date, the main challenges encountered with dark fermentation are its low substrate conversion efficiency and feedback inhibition induced by accumulation of soluble metabolites (i.e., volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols) in effluents (Cai and Wang, 2014; Ren et al., 2014d). The VFAs accumulation could cause a sharp drop in pH of the system which results in the cessation of fermentation and low hydrogen yield (Fang et al., 2010). From the environmental and economic aspects, the residual VFAs should be further treated and reused before discharge of fermentation effluent, which could improve the economy of biological hydrogen production process. Microalgae are considered as a promising biofuel feedstock due to their high intracellular lipid content (30–60% of dry weight) and rapid growth rate (cell doubling time of 1–10 days), and they can grow in ponds, fermentation units and even wastewater (Cheirsilp et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015). The ability of algae to remove COD, nitrogen, and phosphorus has invited much interest to cultivate algae on effluent stream (Chi et al., 2011; Sukačová et al., 2015). Further, a variety number of organic substrates (e.g., VFAs) can be used by algae as carbon and energy sources to accumulate lipids (Tian-Yuan et al., 2014). So, in this study, a novel approach was proposed, in which algae were co-cultured with anaerobic sludge (AS) to assimilate the soluble metabolites for cell growth and lipid production. Compared to single culture by using AS, this co-culture system has the potential to achieve higher substrate and energy conversion efficiencies. Starch wastewater is produced in the manufacturing process of starch and is one of the most seriously polluted wastewaters in food industry (Guo et al., 2015). Starch production plants in China generate more than 20 million tons of starch wastewater per year, which could cause serious pollution on the ecosystem (Vera et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2010). Several starch wastewater treatment methods have been developed including aerobic process, anaerobic process, hybrid process, gas floatation, chemical flocculation and biological ponding (Hinken et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). However, the purpose of conventional methods is only to reduce the pollutants in starch wastewater, while ignoring the potential of recovering added products (Mu et al., 2014). Starch wastewater acts as an effective low price feedstock for anaerobic fermentation (Su et al., 2009). In addition to high starch content, starch wastewater contains some nutrients (N, P) and minerals (Fe, Mg, Zn) which are required by anaerobic bacteria for hydrogen formation (Kargi and Pamukoglu, 2009). Hydrogen production from starch wastewater by dark fermentation was reported in a few literature references (Hasyim et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2003). However, little information is available on utilization of starch wastewater by co-culture of AS and algae for simultaneous energy production and nutrients removal. Thus, energy recovery and wastewater treatment by co-culture of AS and algae was presented in this paper. This co-culture system had the potential for not only developing a new energy source but also protecting the aquatic environments. The culture conditions of the system, including mixed ratio, starch concentration and initial pH were optimized. The hydrogen and lipid production and wastewater treatment performance by the co-culture system were compared with those by the AS alone. Moreover, the energy conversion efficiencies and microbial communities from various starch wastewaters were examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and microalgae,"2.1 Seed sludge and microalgae Anaerobic sludge (AS) was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant located in Harbin (Kong et al., 2014). Because the hydrogen producing bacteria can form protective spores under extremely strict living environment while the hydrogen-consuming bacteria cannot, the AS could be treated before cultivation to inhibit the hydrogen-consuming bacterial activity while still preserving the activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Wang and Wan, 2008; Wang et al., 2011). Heat treatment was most widely used in literature (Luo et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2008), and thus the AS was heat-treated at 100 °C for 1 h to inhibit the bioactivity of hydrogen consumers, which was used as the inoculum in the co-culture system to produce hydrogen. The microalga used in this study was isolated from soil and identified as Scenedesmus sp. (Ren et al., 2013), which cannot utilize polysaccharides but was able to use VFAs. The cultures were maintained in autoclaved BG11 medium at 25 ± 1 °C under cool white fluorescent light."
3,Co-culture of AS and microalgae,"2.2 Co-culture of AS and microalgae Four commonly used starch powers in China, including sweet potato starch (SPS), potato starch (PS), cassava starch (CAS) and corn starch (COS), were selected to simulate the starch wastewaters. All the starch powers were purchased from the market. Detailed composition of starch wastewater was shown in Supplementary Table S1. The specific heat values of SPS, PS, CAS and COS were 15.08, 14.13, 15.08 and 14.4 kJ g−1, respectively, which were provided by the manufacturers. Both purified microalgal and heat-treated AS cultures were collected and resuspended to OD680 of 2.0 ± 0.02 (for algae) and OD600 of 0.5 ± 0.04 (for AS). The AS and algae were mixed together at designated conditions and the inoculations (6 mL) of co-cultures were put into fresh starch wastewater. Batch experiments were performed in 100 mL reactors with a working volume of 60 mL. The air was removed from the headspace by argon gas before the reactors were sealed. All cultures were incubated for 120 h at 35 ± 1 °C under continuous illumination with a light intensity of 70.4 μE m−2 s−1 in a constant oscillator (0.39 g), to provide better contact between the substrate and microorganism. The effective area of light intercepted in each reactor was 3.8 × 10−3 m2. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate."
4,Microbial community analysis,"2.3 Microbial community analysis Samples were collected at the end of experiments for microbial community analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted with a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, USA) based on the manufacturer's instructions. V1–V3 region of the extracted 16S rRNA gene was amplified by the primers 8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATC CTGGCTCAG-3′) and 533R (5′-TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′). Pyrosequencing was performed on a Roche massively parallel 454 GS-FLX according to the methods described previously (Lu et al., 2012)."
5,Energy conversion analysis,"2.4 Energy conversion analysis The specific heat values of hydrogen and lipids were 142 and 36.3 kJ g−1, respectively (Ren et al., 2014c; Williams and Laurens, 2010). The energy production was calculated by summing the heat values (HVs) of hydrogen and algal lipids as shown in Eq. (1). (1) Energy production ( kJ L − 1 ) = HV of H 2 ( kJ L − 1 ) + HV of lipids ( kJ L − 1 ) The energy conversion efficiency (ECE), heat value conversion efficiency (HVCE) and total energy conversion efficiency (TECE) were calculated according to Eq. (2–4), respectively. (2) ECE ( % ) = HV of H 2 or lipids ( kJ ) HV of starch wastewater ( kJ ) × 100 % (3) HVCE ( % ) = HV of H 2 ( kJ ) + HV of lipids ( kJ ) HV of starch wastewater ( kJ ) × 100 % (4) TECE ( % ) = HV of H 2 ( kJ ) + HV of lipids ( kJ ) HV of starch wastewater ( kJ ) + input light energy ( kJ ) × 100 %"
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Biogases were sampled from the head space of reactors with a gas-tight glass syringes. Hydrogen content was measured by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 4890D, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operational temperatures of injection, oven and TCD were 120, 35, and 120 °C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrying gas at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The pH value was monitored by a digital pH meter (Mettler FE20K, Switzerland). Metabolite products in effluent were determined by another gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The liquor samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane before analysis. The operational temperatures of injection port, column and FID were 250, 300, and 300 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were measured according to the methods described previously (Cheirsilp et al., 2011; Chi et al., 2011; Sukačová et al., 2015). Lipid analysis was conducted as the procedures in the literature (Kitcha and Cheirsilp, 2014; Yen et al., 2015). The lipids were extracted from dried biomass with a solvent mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The supernatant was recovered and the same process was carried out two times for the complete extraction of lipids. The solvent phase was combined, dried and weighed. The optical densities (ODs) of AS and microalgae were measured using a spectrophotometer (Unico 7200, China). The fatty acid composition analysis was performed using the methods previously described (Kitcha and Cheirsilp, 2014; Mandotra et al., 2014; Muradov et al., 2015)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of mixed ratio on energy production of co-culture system,"3.1 Effect of mixed ratio on energy production of co-culture system For evaluating the feasibility of co-culture system, various mixed ratios of algae to AS was carried out using soluble starch as the substrate. The total hydrogen and lipid production increased with the mixed ratio from 5:1 to 30:1, and then gradually decreased with the mixed ratio from 30:1 to 100:1 (Fig. 1 A). The maximum hydrogen production of 1500 mL L−1 and total lipid concentration of 0.36 g L−1 were both obtained when the ratio of algae to AS was 30:1. This suggested that co-culture of microalgae and AS was an effective way in the hydrogen and lipid production, but the mixed ratio needed to be adjusted to an appropriate level to optimize the hydrogen and lipid production efficiencies. As shown in Fig. 1B, the hydrogen production process produced more energy compared with that of algal lipid production process. When the mixed ratio was 30:1, the energy produced by hydrogen and lipids was 19 and 13.2 kJ L−1, respectively. The maximum total energy production reached 32.2 kJ L−1 at this culture condition. In a few studies, the algal cells were mixed with pure strain of hydrogen-producing bacteria to improve the hydrogen production. It was found that the maximum hydrogen production was measured in the co-culture of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Bradyrhizobium japonicum when their mixed ratio was 40:1 (Wu et al., 2012a). Moreover, a mixed culture of Anabaena sp. and Rhodopseudomonas palustris was used and the highest cumulative hydrogen volume was obtained when the mixed ratio was 2:1 (Wu et al., 2012b). Mixed ratio might alter the energy distribution and influence the metabolic regulation or metabolic flux of microorganisms (Wu et al., 2012a, 2012b), and thus had great influence on the energy production performance."
9,Effect of starch concentration on energy production of co-culture system,"3.2 Effect of starch concentration on energy production of co-culture system Substrate concentration is a vital factor affecting the biological operation by which the bioactivity of microflora can be measured (Lin et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2014b). Microalgae and AS were cultured in the medium containing various concentrations of starch (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g L−1). The effects of starch concentration on hydrogen and lipid production were studied (Fig. 2 A). When the starch concentration increased from 2 to 6 g L−1, the produced hydrogen/lipids significantly increased from 641.7 mL L−1/0.07 g L−1 to 1508.3 mL L−1/0.36 g L−1, and the produced total energy increased from 10.7 to 32.2 kJ L−1 (Fig. 2B). This suggested that the increase in the starch concentration can favor the improvement of energy production by the co-culture system, which could be attributed to the substrate limitation at low starch concentration. However, while the starch concentration further increased to 10 g L−1, the hydrogen production, total lipid concentration and total energy decreased to 1408.3 mL L−1, 0.35 g L−1 and 30.6 kJ L−1, respectively. This indicated that excessively high starch concentration in the medium had inhibitory effect on the energy production. Previous studies reported that initial starch concentration of 1% was beneficial to the dark fermentative hydrogen production (Yang and Shen, 2006). In addition, another study used 0.5% starch concentration for energy production in combined fermentation (Argun and Kargi, 2010). In this study, lower starch concentration was favorable to energy production by the co-culture system, and thus 6 g L−1 starch was adopted in the following experiments."
10,Effect of initial pH on energy production of co-culture system,"3.3 Effect of initial pH on energy production of co-culture system The pH value plays an important role in affecting the energy production efficiency of mixed microbial consortium since pH value could influence the metabolic activity of the microorganisms and the community structure of the mixed culture (Wang et al., 2007). Thus, it was quite crucial to understand the correlation between pH and energy production performance of the co-culture system. As indicated in Fig. 3 A, the hydrogen and lipid producing activity occurred at a wide pH range of 4–11. Previous reports found that the hydrogen production process from starch using anaerobic bacteria was entirely inhibited at pH 4 (Liu and Shen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2003). However, it can be seen that 125 mL L−1 of hydrogen and 0.015 g L−1 of lipids were produced when initial pH was 4. The reason could be because the co-culture of AS and algae can enhance the acid-tolerance of the energy producers and thus led to a slight improvement in the hydrogen and lipid production. The total energy production increased with initial pH from 5 to 8, and then decreased as the pH further increased to 11 (Fig. 3B). The environment of initial pH 8 was found to be favorable for energy production. This optimal pH was in close agreement with some previous results, in which the highest energy yield occurred at pH 7–8 (Liu and Shen, 2004). The result was different from previous reports showing that the optimum pH was 6–7 (Zhang et al., 2003). According to literature, the range of optimal pH for energy production varied from 5 to 5.5 (Lin et al., 2008). The different pH dependence could be attributed to the difference in the dominant microbial population present in the mixed culture (Wang et al., 2007)."
11,Energy conversion from various starch wastewaters,"3.4 Energy conversion from various starch wastewaters Four typical starch wastewaters, namely, sweet potato starch wastewater (SPSW), potato starch wastewater (PSW), cassava starch wastewater (CASW) and corn starch wastewater (COSW) were applied to explore their energy production potential using the co-culture system. The preferable mixed ratio of 30:1, starch concentration of 6 g L−1 and initial pH of 8 were used based on the foregoing results. For comparison purpose, a control group without microalgae was operated in parallel to the supplemented ones. In the control groups, the hydrogen gas accumulation increased with high rate at the first 24 h of cultivation (Fig. 4 A). After that, the hydrogen production continued by the declined rate until about 120 h, which might be caused by the substrate limitation and product (VFA) inhibition (Argun et al., 2008). The hydrogen production from SPSW, COSW, CASW and PSW was 1116.7, 1050, 1000 and 883.3 mL L−1, respectively. On the other hand, the co-culture system can utilize all the starch wastewaters and the hydrogen obtained from the co-culture system was much higher than the control ones (Fig. 4B and C). Among above starch wastewaters, SPSW was the best substrate with the maximum hydrogen production (1466.7 mL L−1) and total lipids (0.34 g L−1). COSW and CASW were also acceptable substrates which exhibited lower hydrogen production (1244.4/1183.3 mL L−1) and total lipids (0.3/0.26 g L−1). Furthermore, PSW resulted in poor hydrogen production (1038.9 mL L−1) and total lipids (0.23 g L−1). The fatty acid composition was shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The fatty acid chain lengths were in the range of C12:0 to C20:1. The lipids were mostly composed of oleic acid (C18:1, 34.2%), followed by palmitic acid (C16:0, 30.8%) and myristic acid (C14:0, 8.9%). The fatty acid composition obtained in the present study was comparable to that of plant oil which contained mainly palmitic and oleic acids (Cheirsilp et al., 2011; Kitcha and Cheirsilp, 2014). This indicated that the lipids from the co-culture system had the potential and suitability for use as a promising feedstock for biodiesel (Cheirsilp et al., 2012; Talebi et al., 2013). The energy conversion efficiency (ECE), heat value conversion efficiency (HVCE) and total energy conversion efficiency (TECE) from various starch wastewaters were shown in Table 1 . The ECE in dark fermentation was 13.21–15.65%, while the HVCE significantly increased to 25.39–34.2% in co-culture system. Some researchers found that part of fermentable feedstock could be consumed for cell growth, and some energy was stored in the residue, which should be further recovered (Cheng et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2010). If both the HV of starch wastewater and input light energy were taken into account, the TECE of co-culture system ranged from 5.78% to 8.19%. Although this was higher compared to the TECE of some previous studies (Ren et al., 2014a; Su et al., 2009), the utilization efficiency of input light energy was still not satisfactory. It was quite critical to develop more efficient photo-bioreactor designs using natural sunlight to further improve the energy conversion efficiency. The higher energy conversion efficiencies in co-cultivation could be due to the consumption of VFAs. It was reported that high VFA concentrations could cause product inhibition on hydrogen formation (Kargi and Pamukoglu, 2009; Masset et al., 2010). The VFAs and ethanol concentrations were monitored to better understand the product inhibition effect. In the control experiment, acetate (817.2–988.8 mg L−1) and butyrate (689.5–831.7 mg L−1) were two main products of fermentation in all batches, followed by ethanol, plus a small amount of propionate and valerate (Fig. 5 A). The high butyrate fraction indicated that the hydrogen production metabolism was a butyrate-fermentation type (Lin et al., 2008), and the constant relationships between butyrate and acetate fractions showed that the change of starch wastewater type did not affect the metabolic pathway. Moreover, most acetate and butyrate were utilized in the co-culture system, with a little found in the soluble metabolites (Fig. 5B). The acetate and butyrate concentrations in metabolite products decreased to 158–169.6 and 10.7–31.9 mg L−1, respectively. The result revealed that VFAs produced by the AS could be utilized by the microalgae for lipid accumulation, which released the feedback inhibition of acidic products and further promoted the energy production performance. In a previous study, it was found that VFAs could cause great inhibition on the photosystems of the algal cells, and gross photosynthesis was sometimes less than oxygen uptake (Qiao et al., 2012). When microalgae and bacteria were co-cultured, no net photosynthetic rate could be detected, which might be due to the respiration rate of co-cultures was larger than the true photosynthetic rate, leading to no net photosynthetic oxygen evolution (Li et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012a). The rapid respiration rate resulted in a rapid oxygen consumption and kept the anaerobic condition of the system (Wu et al., 2012a)."
12,Wastewater treatment performance,"3.5 Wastewater treatment performance The wastewater treatment performance by co-culture of AS and algae was more efficient than that by AS alone (Fig. 6 ). Compared to the control group, the removal efficiencies of COD, TN and TP in co-culture system increased 176–265%, 169–200% and 154–207%, respectively. This indicated that co-cultivation allowed a marked improvement in wastewater treatment performance. Notably, the COD, TN and TP removal efficiencies in SPSW reached 80.5%, 88.7% and 80.1%, respectively. The products of anaerobic degradation can be divided into the solid, biogas and soluble, and the COD balance could be applied as a tool to check the accuracy of analysis (Chu et al., 2008; Kongjan et al., 2009). Supplementary Table S2 presented the COD balance of different starch wastewaters. The major portion of the substrate was consumed in producing biomass. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) ranged from 1190 to 1450 mg L−1. COD balance exhibited a closure of 92.2–95.6%, indicating that the experimental measurements were accurate (Abreu et al., 2010). In a previous report, mixed culture of oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula glutinis and microalga Chlorella vulgaris was performed to treat industrial wastes. The COD and nitrate removal were 79% and 33%, respectively (Cheirsilp et al., 2011). Another study found that ammonium and phosphorus concentrations in swine wastewater decreased 86% and 69% by co-culture of fungi A. fumigatus and microalga Thraustochytrid sp. (Wrede et al., 2014). Moreover, a combination of bacterium A. brasilense and microalga Chlorella sp. was superior to removal by the microalga alone, reaching removal of up to 15% nitrate, 100% ammonium and 36% phosphorus (de-Bashan et al., 2004). It was shown that the COD, TN and TP removal attained in the present study were comparable or even higher than those reported in literature. Furthermore, it was interesting to note that most reported investigations were all carried out by pure strains. Mixed AS and microalgae could be more preferable inoculum since such system was easier to control and had broader choice of feedstock (Li and Fang, 2007). In addition, another major advantage of the co-culture system was that COD, TN and TP can be efficiently removed in a single stage process, which was good for reducing the operation cost and improving the economy of wastewater treatment."
13,Comparative analysis of microbial communities,"3.6 Comparative analysis of microbial communities To further understand the co-culture system, metagenomic analysis was carried out on samples from various starch wastewaters. This approach allowed for a detailed taxonomic and functional characterization of ecosystem in different culture systems. The dominant bacteria in dark fermentation were genus Clostridium (>99%) for all the starch wastewaters (Fig. 7 A). Clostridium was known for the hydrogen producing characteristics from starch (Liu and Shen, 2004). It can produce extracellular β-amylase and cell-bound glucoamylase as major amylolytic enzymes for starch degradation (Hasyim et al., 2011). Starch was broken into small molecules and then these less complex compounds were used by the bacteria for hydrogen production (Cheng et al., 2008). In addition to hydrogen, Clostridium also produced VFAs (e.g., acetate and butyrate) as the end products (Hasyim et al., 2011). Other community members in the dark fermentative system included Succinivibrio, Serratia, Sphingomonas, Anaerobacter and Sarcina. The microbial communities in the co-culture system were shown in Fig. 7B. In co-cultivation, genus Clostridium (>98.5%) was still the dominant bacteria for all starch wastewaters, and it was notable that the microbial communities became more complex. The microalgae can utilize a variety of VFAs for biomass and lipid production, thereby alleviating the inhibitory effect of end products. This helped to improve the living environment of microorganisms, so more microbes can live in the co-culture system. The microbial community analysis indicated that co-cultivation possessed microorganisms capable of simultaneously treating starch wastewater and producing bioenergy. The co-culture of AS and microalgae showed promising to apply for bioenergy production from starch wastewater. The aforementioned results clearly indicated the feasibility of using the proposed system by co-culture of AS and microalgae for bioenergy production and wastewater treatment. This study was the first to investigate the energy conversion efficiency and nutrient removal of the co-culture system from starch wastewaters. Compared with dark fermentation alone, the co-culture system produced more hydrogen and lipids with better wastewater treatment performance. Thus, this system can be considered as an efficient and environmentally friendly process. For industrial application, scaled-up and long-term studies are essential to further investigate the stability and productivity of the co-culture system. Moreover, though the starch wastewater used in this study is available and widely distributed in the world (Su et al., 2009), it is still needed to explore more substrates (e.g., other wastewater or cellulose) to make this system more practical and cost-effective for commercial application."
14,Conclusions,"The new co-culture system developed in this work proved to be efficient for energy production and wastewater treatment. Co-culture of AS and microalgae was capable of utilizing various starch wastewaters and can significantly improve the energy recovery and nutrients removal. Compared to dark fermentation, this system could markedly reduce the soluble metabolites in effluent and was friendlier to the environment. These results showed the potential and viability of the co-culture system for application in industry. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the performance of the co-culture system in large-scale reactors and long-term operation with more waste materials as the substrates."
