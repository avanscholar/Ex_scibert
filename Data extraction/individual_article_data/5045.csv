0,Introduction,"1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important bulk chemical used for producing rubbers and polymers. Currently, BD is primarily produced as a by-product in ethylene plant through the naphtha cracking [1–3]. In recent years, the production and the supply of BD are influenced by the unstable price of crude oil as well as the increasing production of shale gas. Thus, alternative routes for producing BD are expected. The conversion of ethanol to BD, which has been attempted at the industrial scale, is the most reported alternative route to replace fossil oils and gases, and ca. 80% yield of BD could be achieved in some catalytic processes [2,3]. The recent developments on the fermentation technology for producing bio-derived ethanol further encourage the investigations for BD production from ethanol. On the other hand, butanediols such as 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 2,3-butanediol are derivable from biomass by either fermentation or catalytic conversion [4–6], and they also have potential as resources for producing biomass-derived BD [3]. Scheme 1 shows the production route of BD from butanediols. Butanediols are expected to be converted to BD by two-step dehydration via unsaturated alcohols. However, among the butanediols, 2,3-butanediol is the only one butanediol that can be directly converted into BD in the dehydration over ThO2 [7], Sc2O3 [8] Na-P/SiO2 [9], and CsH2PO4/SiO2 [10]. In addition, the dehydration of butanediols to unsaturated alcohols, as the first step, is also difficult to be selectively catalyzed by solid acid catalysts: 1,4-butanediol and 2,3-butanediol are primarily converted to tetrahydrofuran and 2-butanone, respectively, over acid catalysts such as Al2O3 [11–13]. In the case of 1,3-butanediol, solid acids such as SiO2-Al2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2 produce a wide variety of products including 3-buten-1-ol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone [14,15]. We have conducted a series of works on the vapor-phase dehydration of butanediols, and found that some rare earth metal oxides calcined at high temperatures such as 800°C were effective for the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols from butanediols [16]. In particular, CeO2 gave ca. 96% total selectivity to 3-buten-2-ol (3B2OL) and 2-buten-1-ol (2B1OL) in the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol at 325°C [17]; Yb2O3 gave 87.6% selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol (3B1OL) in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol at 375°C [18]; Sc2O3 provided ca. 90% selectivity to 3B2OL in the dehydration of 2,3-butanediol at 325°C [19]. The achievements on the production of unsaturated alcohols from butanediols provide an opportunity for producing BD from butanediols via two-step dehydration. On the other hand, although such a novel route for BD production has been paid much attention [2,3], detailed studies on the second step, which is selective dehydration of C4 unsaturated alcohols to BD, have not been reported except the preliminary reports [8,15,20,21]. In this study, vapor-phase dehydration of C4 unsaturated alcohols such as 2B1OL, 3B1OL, and 3B2OL was studied to produce BD over various solid catalysts. The suitable catalyst system for each reaction was investigated, and the studies for the inhibition of the catalytic deactivation were also conducted."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples 3B1OL and 2B1OL were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries Co., Ltd., Japan, and 2B1OL was a mixture of cis and trans isomers with a cis/trans ratio of ca. 1/17. 3B2OL was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd., Japan. 1-Hexanol, which was used as the internal standard, was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan. γ-Al2O3 (N611N, specific surface area, S BET =210m2 g−1) and SiO2-Al2O3 (N631L, S BET =440m2 g−1) with an Al2O3 content of ca. 15wt.% were purchased from Nikki Chemical Co., Ltd. Another Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-7, S BET =180m2 g−1) and anatase TiO2 (JRC-TIO-4, S BET =50m2 g−1) were supplied by Catalyst Society of Japan. Yb2O3 was purchased from Kanto Kagaku Co. Ltd., Japan. Monoclinic ZrO2 (RSC-HP, S BET =39m2 g−1) and CeO2 (HS, S BET =98m2 g−1) were supplied by Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd, Japan. Yb2O3 and CeO2 were calcined at 800°C for 3h before the use as catalysts, and the specific surface areas of Yb2O3 and CeO2 after calcination were 29 and 42m2 g−1, respectively. Tetraethyl orthosilicate, AgNO3, and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan. Self-made SiO2/Al2O3 was prepared by an adsorption method described in the related procedure elsewhere [22]. Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-7) was used as the support, and an ethanol solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate was used as the precursor of SiO2. The Al2O3 was immersed in the tetraethyl orthosilicate solution at 25°C for 168h. After the Al2O3 coated with SiO2 was filtered, the resulted catalysts were dried at 110°C for 12h, and then calcined at 500°C for 3h. The SiO2/Al2O3 with a SiO2 loading of 10wt.% (10SiO2/Al2O3) had a specific surface area of 162m2 g−1. Fig. S1 and S2 show the N2 isotherm and pore size distribution of 10SiO2/Al2O3, respectively. It is obvious that 10SiO2/Al2O3 is a mesoporous material. Metal-modified SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method using a solution with a prescribed amount of metal nitrate dissolved in distilled water. The self-made 10SiO2/Al2O3 was used as the support. AgNO3 and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were used as the precursor of the corresponding metal. After the impregnation process, the samples were dried at 110°C for 12h, and then calcined for 3h. The calcination temperature of metal-modified SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts was 500°C. Hereafter, the commercially supplied SiO2-Al2O3 (N631L) is named as SiO2-Al2O3-CS. The self-made SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts are named as xSiO2/Al2O3, where x indicates the weight percentage of SiO2. Metal-modified SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts are denominated as yM-xSiO2/Al2O3, where y indicates the weight percentage of the additive metal; M indicates the species of the additive metal. For example, 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 indicates 3wt.% Ag loaded on a self-made SiO2/Al2O3 with a SiO2 of 10wt.%."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction The dehydration of unsaturated alcohols was performed in a fixed-bed down-flow glass reactor with an inner diameter of 17mm at an ambient pressure of N2. Prior to the reaction, either 0.5 or 0.2g catalyst was preheated at the reaction temperature for 1h. After that, an unsaturated alcohol was fed to the reactor at a liquid feed rate of 1.75cm3 h−1 together with N2 flow of 30cm3 min−1. The liquid effluents collected in a trap at 0°C every hour were analyzed by a FID-GC (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) with a 30-m capillary column of TC-WAX (GL-Science, Japan). The gaseous products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Japan) with a 6-m packed column (VZ-7, GL-Science, Japan). A GC–MS (QP5050A, Shimadzu, Japan) was used for the identification of the collected liquid products. 1-Hexanol was used as an internal standard substance. The mass balance could be achieved at a range of 70–99%. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: (1) Conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − m o l e o f r e c o v e r e d r e a c t a n t m o l e o f t h e r e a c t a n t ) × 100 (2) Selectivity ( % ) = m o l e o f c a r b o n i n s p e c i f i c p r o d u c t m o l e o f c a r b o n i n c o n v e r t e d r e a c t a n t × 100"
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by the BET method using N2 isotherm at −196°C. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed NH3 was measured by neutralization titration using an electric conductivity cell immersed in an aqueous solution of H2SO4. The amount of desorbed NH3, which was bubbled into the solution, was monitored by the change in the conductivity of the solution. A cumulative amount of desorbed NH3 was obtained as a function of temperature and then differentiated to obtain a TPD profile as an acid strength distribution. The TPD was performed using self-made apparatus with a sample weight of ca. 30mg, a temperature increase of 10°Cmin−1, and a heating range from the room temperature to 850°C. The system image of the experiment for the measurement of NH3-TPD is shown in Fig. S3, and the details of TPD experiment are described in the supporting information as well as in our previous studies [23,24]. The thermogravimetry analysis (TG) was conducted using Thermoplus 8120E2 (Rigaku) under the following conditions: sample weight, ca. 10mg; the rate of the temperature increase, 5°Cmin−1; heating range, from the room temperature to 900°C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Dehydration of 2B1OL, 3B2OL, and 3B1OL over various solid catalysts","3.1 Dehydration of 2B1OL, 3B2OL, and 3B1OL over various solid catalysts Firstly, some commercial catalysts were tested in the dehydration of 2B1OL, 3B2OL, and 3B1OL. The catalysts can be divided to two groups: one group includes the ordinary solid acid catalysts such as Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3-CS, TiO2, and ZrO2; the other group includes some rare earth metal oxides such as CeO2 and Yb2O3, which show specifically high catalytic performance for the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols in the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol [17] and 1,4-butanediol [18], respectively. The rare earth metal oxides have weak basicity, which has been confirmed in our previous study [25]. Table 1 shows the reaction results in the dehydration of 2B1OL over various catalysts. The reactions were performed at different temperatures according to the different activity of the catalysts. The catalyst weight and the flow rate of N2 carrier gas were 0.5g and 30cm3 min−1, respectively. Besides BD, butenes, 1-butanol, butanal, and ethers were generated with different selectivities depending on the catalysts. Here, the butenes include 1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butene, but do not include isobutene. The ethers represent the liner unsaturated ethers, which have a formula of C8H14O, produced by the intermolecular dehydration of 2B1OL. SiO2-Al2O3-CS showed a high activity for the formation of BD, and 97.1% BD selectivity with 99.3% 2B1OL conversion was achieved at 260°C. Al2O3 gave a 2B1OL conversion of 90.3%, while the selectivity to BD was as low as 27.2% because of the formation of ethers and unidentified products. TiO2 and ZrO2 were also active for the formation of BD from 2B1OL, whereas the selectivities to BD were much lower than SiO2-Al2O3-CS. Yb2O3 showed 78.9% selectivity to BD with a relatively low conversion of 42.4%. CeO2 gave a high 2B1OL conversion of 93.4%, whereas the selectivity to BD was as low as 21.3% because of the by-production of butanal and unidentified products. Table 2 shows the reaction results in the dehydration of 3B2OL. BD, butenes, 2-butanone, and ethers were the main products. SiO2-Al2O3-CS was also effective for the dehydration of 3B2OL to BD, and provided 93.4% selectivity to BD at a 3B2OL conversion of 74.4%. The selectivities to BD were 52.1, 58.9 and 48.3% over Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2, respectively. These were much lower than SiO2-Al2O3-CS. Al2O3 gave a relatively high selectivity to ethers, and ZrO2 gave a relatively high selectivity to 2-butanone. Al2O3 has been widely used as an effective catalyst for the etherification of alcohols such as methanol to dimethyl ether [26–28], which can explain the fact that Al2O3 gave high selectivities to ethers in the dehydration of either 2B1OL or 3B2OL. In contrast to the ordinary acid catalysts, the rare earth metal oxides showed low catalytic activities for the formation of BD from 3B2OL. Yb2O3 gave a relatively high selectivity to 2-butanone, while CeO2 gave the highest selectivity to butenes. Based on the above reaction results, we found that acid catalysts were effective for the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL to BD. Compared with Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2, SiO2-Al2O3-CS was more effective for the dehydration of both 2B1OL and 3B2OL to BD. In Section 3.2, we will give a further study on the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL to BD over self-made SiO2/Al2O3-based catalysts. Table 3 shows the reaction results in the dehydration of 3B1OL, and Scheme 2 shows the main products. The formation of BD, propylene, formaldehyde, methanol, 1-butanol, butanal, 2B1OL, and ethers were confirmed by GC–MS, while formaldehyde was unable to be detected and quantified by FID-GC. The formation of propylene, methanol, and formaldehyde indicates that C-C cleavage of 3B1OL occurred in all the tested reactions, which is different from the case in the reactions of 3B2OL and 2B1OL. In a similar way, it is known that 3-methyl-1,3-butanediol decomposes to isobutene, formaldehyde and methanol via 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol [29]. The acid catalysts gave BD selectivities lower than 44% and propylene selectivities higher than 17%, indicating that C-C cleavage of 3B1OL was easily catalyzed by acid catalysts. Among the tested catalysts, SiO2-Al2O3-CS gave the lowest BD selectivity of 12.0% and the highest propylene selectivity of 53.1%. In the case of rare earth metal oxides, Yb2O3 gave a propylene selectivity of 25.9% and a BD selectivity of 33.8%, while CeO2 gave the lowest propylene selectivity of 9.3% and the highest BD selectivity of 54.5%. This result indicates that CeO2 inhibits the C-C cleavage of 3B1OL and is relatively effective for the formation of BD from 3B1OL. In the case of acid catalysts, the order of the reactivity of the unsaturated C4 alcohols under the same conditions is 2B1OL>3B2OL>3B1OL (Tables 1–3), which means 3B1OL is less reactive over the acids. However, in the case of CeO2, the reactivity of 3B1OL is similar to that of 2B1OL, and is higher than that of 3B2OL. This result suggests that the catalytic mechanism over acid catalysts and rare earth metal oxides such as CeO2 is different in the dehydration of unsaturated C4 alcohols. We propose that the different positions of the hydroxyl group and the double bond in 2B1OL, 3B2OL, and 3B1OL lead to different adsorption modes on catalyst surface, which causes the different reactivity and the product distribution. In the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol, CeO2 with a cubic fluorite structure shows specifically high activity for the formation of 2B1OL and 3B2OL [16]. The specific activity of CeO2 was supposed to be assigned to the Ce4+-Ce3+ redox nature of CeO2, which activated the H atom at position 2 of 1,3-butanediol firstly, followed by the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol over CeO2 through a radical mechanism: an H atom located at position 2 was abstracted first, followed by the elimination of an OH radical at position 1 [16,20]. The proposed mechanism was also supported by density functional theory and paired interacting orbital calculations [30,31]. Based on the previous findings, we supposed a reaction mechanism for the dehydration of 3B1OL to BD over CeO2 as shown in Scheme 3 . It is reasonable that the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol over CeO2 also undergoes a radical mechanism, which is quite similar to the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol over CeO2 as mentioned above."
7,Catalytic activity of self-made SiO2/Al2O3 modified by metals in the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL,"3.2 Catalytic activity of self-made SiO2/Al2O3 modified by metals in the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL In the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL, although SiO2-Al2O3-CS showed a relatively high activity for 1,3-butadiene formation among the acid catalysts, it deactivated rapidly under low contact time conditions. Deactivation of catalysts is a critical problem in catalytic conversion under continuous flow conditions especially in a practical industrial process. Thus, further studies were conducted in order to develop stable catalysts for the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL. Firstly, we prepared a series of SiO2/Al2O3-based catalysts to regulate the acid strength. In contrast to SiO2-Al2O3-CS with a low Al2O3 content of ca. 15wt.%, the SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with low SiO2 contents. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the catalytic activity on the SiO2 content in the dehydration of 2B1OL, and the product distribution in each reaction and the change in the catalytic activity with time on stream are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4. The conversion of 2B1OL increased with increasing the SiO2 content, and 100% conversion of 2B1OL was achieved at SiO2 contents of 5–10wt.%. The selectivity to BD increased with increasing the SiO2 content, and was maximized at 97.5% at a SiO2 content of 10wt.%. On the other hand, the selectivity to ethers was higher than 20% over the Al2O3 support without SiO2, whereas it decreased with increasing the SiO2 content and decreased to 0% at SiO2 contents higher than 5wt.%. These results demonstrate that the self-made SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts are effective for the dehydration of 2B1OL to BD, and the suitable SiO2 content in SiO2/Al2O3 is 10wt.%. In order to study the catalytic stability, the dehydration of 2B1OL was performed at a low W/F of 0.14h (Fig. 2 ), where W and F are catalyst weight and flow rate of reactant, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the changes in activity of SiO2-Al2O3-CS and 10SiO2/Al2O3 with time on stream at a W/F of 0.14h. SiO2-Al2O3-CS significantly deactivated with time on stream. In contrast, the activity of 10SiO2/Al2O3 was more stable, while slight decrease in the conversion of 2B1OL was still observed. In our group, an effective operation for stabilizing the catalytic activity of acid catalysts has been reported [24,32–35]. For example, vapor-phase aldol condensation of butanal to 2-ethyl-2-hexenal can be catalyzed by TiO2, whereas TiO2 deactivates rapidly because of the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface. We have developed an Ag-modified TiO2 catalyst, which exhibits stable catalytic activity for the formation of 2-ethyl-2-hexenal from butanal [35]. In a similar way, the loading of Ag onto SiO2-Al2O3, Cu onto Al2O3, and Ag onto Al2O3 are found to be effective for stabilizing the vapor-phase dehydration of 1,2-propanediol into propanal [24], dehydration of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol into 3,4-2H-dihydropyran [33], and cyclodehydration of diethylene glycol to 1,4-dioxane [34], respectively. In these processes, H2 carrier gas is required for inhibiting the catalytic deactivation. Before the reaction, the loaded metal oxide is reduced to metal, and it removes the product on the catalyst surface together with H2 to suppress the formation of coke. In the present study, Ag- and Cu-modified 10SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and tested in the dehydration of 2B1OL. Table 4 summarizes the reaction results in the dehydration of 2B1OL over 10SiO2/Al2O3, 3wt.% Ag- and Cu-modified 10SiO2/Al2O3 in H2 flow at a W/F of 0.34h. Compared with 10SiO2/Al2O3, both the conversion and the selectivity to BD were improved by the modification of 10SiO2/Al2O3 with 3wt.% Ag: the selectivity to BD was 94.1% at conversion of 98.5%. On the other hand, although 3Cu-10SiO2/Al2O3 gave a high conversion of 98.6%, the selectivity to BD was only 0.6%, which was attributed to the production of butenes and 1-butanol with selectivities of 51.8 and 21.3%, respectively. Since Cu is widely used as a hydrogenation catalyst [36,37], it is reasonable that the loaded Cu metal catalyzes the hydrogenation of 2B1OL to 1-butanol and the hydrogenation of the produced BD to butenes. Thus, the modification of 10SiO2/Al2O3 by Cu was not effective for the dehydration of 2B1OL to BD. The reactions over 10SiO2/Al2O3 and 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 in N2 flow were also performed in order to study the effect of the reaction atmosphere. Compared with a conversion of 92.5% and a BD selectivity of 75.0% over 10SiO2/Al2O3 in H2 atmosphere (entry 1), a low conversion of 85.9% and a high BD selectivity of 86.7% were obtained in N2 atmosphere (entry 2), indicating that H2 took part in the reaction even without the presence of a metal. On the other hand, compared with the reaction results obtained over 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 in an H2 flow (entry 4), both the conversion and the selectivity to BD were low in N2 (entry 5), indicating that H2 could efficiently promote the formation of BD in the presence of Ag. Table 5 summarizes the reaction results of the dehydration of 2B1OL over Ag-modified 10SiO2/Al2O3 with different Ag loadings. In the reactions with Ag loadings lower than 3%, the selectivity to BD trended to decrease, while the selectivity to unidentified products trended to increase. The catalysts with Ag loadings of 3 and 5wt.% gave both high conversions of 2B1OL and high selectivities to BD, indicating that the suitable loading amount of Ag for BD formation was 3–5wt.%. Fig. 2 compares the changes in 2B1OL conversion over SiO2-Al2O3-CS, 10SiO2/Al2O3 and 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3. It is obvious that the order of the catalytic stability is 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3>10SiO2/Al2O3>SiO2-Al2O3-CS, indicating that the modification of 10SiO2/Al2O3 by Ag is effective for the inhibition of catalytic deactivation in the dehydration of 2B1OL. We further performed the dehydration of 2B1OL over 10SiO2/Al2O3 and 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 with a long run of 10h. As shown in Fig. 3 , the conversion of 2B1OL over 10SiO2/Al2O3 decreased from 97.5 to 76.8% with BD selectivity decreased from 86.9 to 63.3% during 10h. In contrast, the conversion of 2B1OL over 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 slightly decreased from 99.4 to 96.2% with BD selectivity decreased from 95.0 to 87.1%. The decrease in BD selectivity with time on stream was due to the increase in the formation of unidentified products. It seems that the formation of BD favors high conversions. It is proposed that the reactant of unsaturated alcohols would take part in the formation of unidentified products especially at low conversions, while there is no evidence. The dehydration of 3B2OL was also performed over SiO2-Al2O3-CS, 10SiO2/Al2O3, and 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 at a W/F of 0.34h. Fig. 4 shows the changes in catalytic activity of these catalysts. It is clear that the increasing order of the catalytic stability is 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3>10SiO2/Al2O3>SiO2-Al2O3-CS, indicating that 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 is an effective catalyst for the dehydration of 3B2OL to BD. On the other hand, SiO2-Al2O3-CS was stable in the dehydration of 2B1OL within 5h at a W/F of 0.34h, whereas it significantly deactivated in the dehydration of 3B2OL at the same W/F (Fig. 4a), indicating that 3B2OL leaded to more severe catalyst deactivation than 2B1OL."
8,Characterization of catalyst samples,"3.3 Characterization of catalyst samples In vapor-phase reactions over either acid or base catalysts, it is generally considered that the accumulation of carbonaceous compounds on the catalyst surface results in the catalytic deactivation [35]. In order to evaluate the coke formation, TG analyses of the used SiO2-Al2O3-CS, 10SiO2/Al2O3, and 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 were performed in air. As shown in Fig. 5 , a weight loss below 200°C is considered to be attributed to the desorption of H2O, and a weight loss can be observed at a temperature range from 200 to 600°C, which is considered to be caused by the decomposition of coke [34]. The order of the amount of coke in the used catalysts was 3Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3<10SiO2/Al2O3<SiO2-Al2O3-CS, which was reverse to the order of the catalytic stability (Figs. 2–4). This indicates that the formation of coke possibly affects the catalytic deactivation, and the modification of 10SiO2/Al2O3 by Ag is effective for inhibiting the coke formation. However, because there is no significant difference in the amount of coke, different coke component may affect the deactivation behavior. In order to study the effect of the acidity on the dehydration of 3B2OL and 2B1OL, NH3-TPD analyses of fresh SiO2-Al2O3-CS, 10SiO2/Al2O3, and 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 were performed (Fig. 6 ). The number of acid sites in SiO2-Al2O3-CS, 10SiO2/Al2O3, and 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 was 0.52, 0.20, and 0.18mmolg−1, respectively. SiO2-Al2O3-CS showed two desorption peaks at 283 and 327°C. 10SiO2/Al2O3 and 5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3 showed desorption peaks at 195 and 260°C, respectively. These results indicate that the order of the averaged acid strength is SiO2-Al2O3-CS>10SiO2/Al2O3>5Ag-10SiO2/Al2O3. In the dehydration of 3B2OL, SiO2-Al2O3-CS with the strongest acid strength and the largest amount of acid sites gives both the highest initial conversion and the highest initial selectivity to BD (Fig. 4), indicating that the large amount of strong acid sites is effective for BD formation. However, it is generally considered that the catalyst with strong acidity promotes the formation of coke and easily deactivates [38]. Thus, SiO2-Al2O3-CS significantly deactivated in the dehydration of 3B2OL (Fig. 4a) and 2B1OL (Fig. 2). It is clear that the loading of Ag on 10SiO2/Al2O3 reduces the acid strength without significant effect on the total number of acid sites. Similar results have been also obtained in our previous study using different kinds of SiO2-Al2O3 [24]. We propose that the additive Ag particles were located on the surface of 10SiO2/Al2O3, and they poisoned the strong acid sites on 10SiO2/Al2O3 to form new active sites for BD formation. The reduced acid strength by the addition of Ag is supposed to contribute to the relatively stable catalytic activity of the Ag-modified 10SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts. The XRD profiles of the reduced Ag-modified 10SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. S5. The peaks assigned to Ag metal were observed at Ag loadings higher than 5%, indicating the additive Ag was reduced to metal before the reaction, and worked at a metal state during the reaction. It is possible that Ag also plays another important role for the inhibition of catalytic deactivation, as has been described in our previous studies [24,32,34,35]. It is supposed that H2 can be cleaved to produce H atoms by Ag metal, and through the spillover effect, the generated H atoms can shift from Ag to SiO2/Al2O3 surface to form H+. The H+ on SiO2/Al2O3 is proposed to be effective for suppressing the formation of coke and inhibiting the catalytic deactivation, thus, the selectivity to BD is increased. Compared with Cu, Ag has low hydrogenation ability and does not catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols to saturated alcohols as well as the further hydrogenation of BD to butenes. Therefore, the low hydrogenation ability of Ag is another important factor making the modification of Ag to be effective."
9,Future perspective of BD production,"3.4 Future perspective of BD production The production of BD from biomass-derived ethanol is a well-known process, and many research works have been reported in vapor-phase condensation of ethanol to produce BD [2,3]. Another possible route for producing BD is proposed via the dehydration of intermediate unsaturated alcohols from renewable butanediols [3]. The butanediols-to-BD process have an advantage to give high BD selectivity although the biobutanediol is currently more expensive than bioethanol. Both the two processes suffer from the catalytic deactivation, and the development of stable catalysts and technology for inhibiting the catalytic deactivation would significantly affect the industrial applications of the processes in future."
10,Conclusions,"Vapor-phase dehydration of C4 unsaturated alcohols, such as 2B1OL, 3B2OL and 3B1OL, to BD were investigated over various solid catalysts. Acid catalysts were found to be effective for the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL, to BD, and SiO2-Al2O3-CS showed a relatively high catalytic performance. In the dehydration of 3B1OL, however, acid catalysts promoted the C-C cleavage of 3B1OL to propylene, while rare earth metal oxides such as CeO2 were effective for the formation of BD from 3B1OL. Compared with the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL, the dehydration of 3B1OL undergoes different mechanism. The high performance of CeO2 in the dehydration of 3B1OL into BD is considered to be attributed to its weak basicity as well as the Ce4+-Ce3+ redox nature of CeO2. The dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL was further studied using self-made SiO2/Al2O3 catalysts. The suitable SiO2 content in SiO2/Al2O3 was found to be 10wt.%, and the 10SiO2/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better catalytic performance than SiO2-Al2O3-CS. In order to inhibit the catalytic deactivation, metal-modified SiO2/Al2O3 was prepared and tested. The SiO2/Al2O3 modified by Ag with a loading of 3–5wt.% was found to be efficient in inhibiting the catalytic deactivation and improving the conversion and the selectivity to BD in the dehydration of 2B1OL and 3B2OL. In the dehydration of 2B1OL over 5Ag-SiO2/Al2O3, the selectivity to BD was 94.6% at conversion of 99.1%."
