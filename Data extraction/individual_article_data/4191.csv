0,Introduction,"The growth of industrial processing of leather, wood, paper, and textiles has led to environmental problems caused by toxic and carcinogenic pollutants in discharged wastewater. Among the various pollutants in wastewater, intensely colored organic dyes are considered significant contaminants. Dyes and their breakdown products are highly toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic. Discharged dyes such as methylene blue and methyl orange are harmful to natural water resources, human health, and aquatic life. The estimated production of dye has reached 1.6 million tons/year while 15% of the waste from dyeing processes is discharged in wastewater [1–3]. Synthetic dyes are non-biodegradable because their structures consist of aromatic rings. Therefore, wastewater treatment of dyes is considered one of the most challenging areas of water pollution control and chemical, physical, and biological approaches have been used to treat contaminated water. Typical methods are chemical precipitation, ion exchange, coagulation, aerobic/anaerobic treatment, membrane filtration, and adsorption [1]. Adsorption, either by organic or inorganic materials such as polymers and activated carbon, is an effective, convenient, and economic technique that has been extensively utilized to remove toxic dyes [4]. A high adsorption capacity is an important property of adsorbents used for this purpose. Among these materials, hydrogels, three-dimensional crosslinked polymers, are prominent because they characteristically take up large amounts of water without dissolving. During adsorption, the pollutants accumulate on the hydrogels. However, synthetic petroleum-based hydrogels are difficult to degrade [5,6]. Consequently, additional post-processes, such as desorption, are required to treat exhausted hydrogels before incineration or disposal in landfill. If they are not treated, they will cause further environmental issues. Desorption is usually carried out by immersing exhausted hydrogels in a suitable solvent until the adsorbed dyes are extracted to the solvent. A separation process is then required, usually by filtration. Hydrogels must, therefore, be chemically and physically stable. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a synthetic yet biodegradable, non-toxic polymer [7,8], has high tensile strength and flexibility with good film forming properties [9]. The chemical structure of PVA comprises a hydroxyl group on each repeating unit, so it can form crosslinking both by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Substituting petroleum-based hydrogels with PVA-based hydrogels would bring the advantages of biodegradability to the process as well as the physical properties of the hydrogel. Photocatalytic degradation is an alternative method of wastewater treatment. Photocatalysis can oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants and toxic compounds such as methylene blue, crystal violet, brilliant green, and rhodamine B. The photocatalyst, upon exposure to UV radiation, converts toxic compounds into non-toxic molecules by generating hydroxyl radical (·OH) forms [10]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used as a photocatalyst in a variety of applications including the photodegradation of dye. ZnO shows unique properties of electrical conductivity, high photocatalytic activity, chemical stability, and robustness against photocorrosion and its production cost is low. Conventionally, photocatalysts such as ZnO and TiO2 particles are used in powder form in an aqueous suspension, necessitating a separation process to recover the photocatalyst particles from the water after the discoloring reaction. Simplification of the separation process has been attempted by depositing photocatalyst particles on support materials such as glass, aluminium, activated carbon, silica, and carbon nanotubes [11]. Several groups have reported the incorporation of photocatalyst particles in polymer hydrogels to facilitate recovery. Immobilization of ZnO in polymer matrices has also been explored [12–16]. So far, these works have mainly focused on photocatalytic activity and reusability and the final products still had to be used directly in wastewater systems [13,14]. This research aims to overcome the limitations of photocatalyst and hydrogel by the development of a two-in-one photocatalytic superadsorbent hydrogel composite based on polyacrylamide (PAM) and PVA. The hydrogel was chemically surface-functionalized with ZnO nanoparticles. The synthesis of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles with silane bridges was developed and the products characterized. The behaviors of PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO composite hydrogels toward dye adsorption and photodegradation were systematically studied. The specific advantages of the photocatalyst and superadsorbent hydrogel would complement each other. The excellent MB adsorption capacity, ease of sample handling, and effective degradation of adsorbed MB would provide a comprehensive and practical method, advance a closed loop system of wastewater treatment, prevent production of secondary waste, and eliminate the photocatalyst-separation step."
1,Experimental,

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (MW 90,000–100,000 g/mol, viscosity 29.7 MPA S, 88% hydrolyzed) was from Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co, Ltd. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.0%), n,n’-methylenebis acrylamide (MBA, 99%) and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN, 98.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25.0%) was from EMSURE®. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99%) and ethanol (EtOH, 99.0%) were from Labscan. Methylene blue (MB) was purchased from UNILAB®. All chemicals were used as received."
3,Synthesis of SiO2@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of SiO2@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles The procedure was developed from a sol-gel process previously reported [17]. In brief, 5.0 g of ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in 200 mL of EtOH under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 30 min and 5.4 mL of NH4OH were then added, followed by the dropwise addition of 5.4 mL of TEOS. The mixture was stirred continuously for 6 h at 60 °C. The particles were collected by centrifugation, washed with EtOH and dried at 60 °C overnight."
4,Synthesis of poly(vinyl alcohol)-g-polyacrylamide hydrogel,"2.3 Synthesis of poly(vinyl alcohol)-g-polyacrylamide hydrogel PVA-g-PAM hydrogel was prepared by dissolving 7.5 g of AM and 0.075 g of MBA (1.0 mol%) in 50 mL of distilled water and heating the solution to 60 °C. In a separate beaker, 7.5 g of PVA were dissolved in 150 mL of distilled water at 90 °C. Next, the two solutions were mixed together and 0.375 g of CAN was added. The mixture was transferred to a polystyrene plate (11 cm × 16 cm) and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The sample of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel was soaked in 0.5 M NaOH for 24 h and distilled water for another 24 h to remove free PVA (~6.3%)."
5,Synthesis of SiO2@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles functionalized PVA-g-PAM hydrogel composite,2.4 Synthesis of SiO2@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles functionalized PVA-g-PAM hydrogel composite A dispersion of 0.5 g of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles in 100 mL of distilled water was vigorously stirred for 30 min. PVA-g-PAM hydrogel sheet was immersed in the dispersion of nanoparticles for 24 h. The squares of hydrogel composite were collected and rinsed with water to remove unattached particles.
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Chemical functionalities of nanoparticles and hydrogel were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR, Bruker TENSOR 27). The SiO2 and SiO2@ZnO particles were prepared as a pellet with potassium bromide (KBr) and the PVA-g-PAM hydrogel was recorded in attenuated total reflectance mode. The samples were scanned 256 times in transmission mode between 4000 and 400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The morphology of nanoparticles and hydrogels was examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopes (Quanta 400, FEI and Tecnai G2 20, FEI, respectively). An energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) detector was coupled with the SEM and TEM to characterize chemical compositions. To produce cross-sectional images, the hydrogel was immersed in water to reach an equilibrium-swollen state and freeze-dried with liquid nitrogen to prevent collapse. Quantitative analysis of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of the hydrogel composite was conducted using a Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA800, PerkinElmer) in nitrogen atmosphere, from 25 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The mechanical stability of the hydrogel at fully swollen state was examined by placing a standard weight of 1500 g on top of the hydrogel. Water absorbency was determined after soaking dry samples in distilled water for 24 h at room temperature (29.5 ± 0.5 °C). The weights of the hydrogel before and after water absorption were measured and water absorbency was calculated from equation (1): (1) Water absorbency = W s − W o W o × 100 where W o and W s were the weight of dry and swollen hydrogel, respectively. The degradation of dry samples was evaluated in simulated weather conditions using a Weathering Tester (Q-Lab, QUV) for 48 h according to ASTM G154. At least three samples were tested in each experiment."
7,Dye adsorption,"2.6 Dye adsorption Dye adsorption capacity was studied using MB as a model cationic dye. For 24 h, 0.5 g of the hydrogel was immersed in 100 mL MB aqueous solution. The concentration of the solution was determined by UV–Visible spectrophotometry (LAMBDA 25, PerkinElmer) and was calculated from the absorbance at the maximum wavelength, λ max (664 nm). The adsorption capacity at equilibrium (q e) of MB (mg/g) was calculated using equation (2): (2) q e = (C o − C e) × V/W o where C o and C e (mg/L) were the initial and equilibrium concentrations of MB solution, respectively, V (L) was the volume of MB solution, and W o (g) was the dry sample weight. Initial dye concentration was varied (3–5000 mg/L) to study adsorption isotherms according to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, as presented in equations (3) and (4), respectively. Langmuir isotherm [18]: (3) C e q e = 1 K L q m + C e q m Freundlich isotherm [19]: (4) l n q e = 1 n l n C e + l n K F where q e and q m (mg/g) were the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and the maximum adsorption capacity, respectively, K L (L/mg) was the Langmuir constant, K F [(mg/g) (L/mg)1/n] was the Freundlich constant, and 1/n was the adsorption intensity. From the Langmuir isotherm model, a separation factor (R L) can be calculated as follows [20]: (5) R L = 1 1 + K L C o where C o (mg/L) was the initial concentration of MB solution. Kinetic studies were performed to determine the adsorption mechanism and the data were fitted to two kinetic models: the pseudo-first-order (PFO) model and pseudo-second-order (PSO) model. Pseudo-first-order model [21]: (6) l o g ( q e − q t ) = l o g q e − K 1 t Pseudo-second-order model [22]: (7) t q t = 1 K 2 q e 2 + 1 q e t where K 1 (1/min) and K 2 (g/mg min) are the rate constants of PFO and PSO models, respectively. At least three samples were tested for all experiments."
8,Photodegradation,"2.7 Photodegradation To study the photocatalytic degradation of MB on and within the adsorbent, hydrogel composites that had adsorbed MB at initial concentrations of 3, 5, and 10 ppm were placed under UV irradiation for specific time intervals in a box equipped with UV lamps (18 W, wavelength 315–400 nm, UV-A ≥ 39 mW/cm2) with an optical distance of 4.5 cm. The decolorization of MB in the hydrogel was monitored using UV–Visible spectrophotometry at λ max of MB. Percentage of MB degradation was calculated using equation (8): (8) MB degradation ( % ) = C i − C f C f × 100 where C i and C f (mg/L) were the initial and final concentrations of MB in hydrogel before and after UV irradiation, respectively. The kinetics of photodegradation were studied following the PFO kinetic equation (9) l n C t C o = − k a p p t where C o and C t (mg/L) were the initial concentration and concentration at time t of MB in the hydrogel composite and k app was the apparent rate constant [23]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology The FTIR spectrum of ZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 1 ) shows a characteristic peak of Zn–O stretching vibration at 538 cm−1 and a broad band at 3435 cm−1 attributed to –OH stretching vibrations of adsorbed moisture [12]. After surface coating ZnO nanoparticles with TEOS, the spectrum of the SiO2@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles presented peaks at 1176 and 1068 cm−1 that corresponded to the asymmetric stretching vibration of Si–O–Si and a peak at 490 cm−1 that corresponded to Si–O–Si bending vibration [24]. The spectrum of PVA homopolymer shows the –OH stretching vibration peak at 3287 cm−1 and C–H alkyl stretching vibration at 2910–2939 cm−1. The peaks at 1731 and 1421 cm−1 correspond to CO and C–O stretching vibrations from residual ester groups and the peaks at 1083 and 1024 cm−1 were attributed to C–O–C and C–O stretching vibrations, respectively [25]. The spectrum of PVA-g-PAM exhibits peaks at 1661 and 1618 cm−1 attributed to the CO stretching vibration of amide I and N–H bending vibration [26]. Moreover, a minor peak shift and broadening was observed at 3290 cm−1 due to the overlapping of N–H stretching vibrations from amino functional groups and the formation of hydrogen bonding between –OH of PVA and –NH2 of PAM. These results indicated the successful grafting of PAM onto the PVA backbone [25,27]. Fig. 2 (a) displays ZnO nanoparticles after surface coating with SiO2 as a mixture of rod and spherical shapes. HR-TEM micrographs (Fig. 2(b) and (c)) clearly reveals the ZnO core completely covered with a thin SiO2 shell with a thickness of 18.94 ± 1.66 nm, determined by analysis with Image J software. The surface of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles was further characterized by elemental composition mapping. TEM-EDX mapping of a single particle exhibited a dense distribution of Zn at core and a broad distribution of Si at shell of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles, respectively. Good distribution of Si can be observed in the same areas as Zn in SEM-EDX mapping. The consistency of the results of EDX, FTIR and TEM analysis confirmed the successful surface coating of ZnO nanoparticles with SiO2. The mechanism by which the SiO2 layer coated the surface of ZnO nanoparticles is proposed in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 (a) and (b) reveal the smooth external surface of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel and the interconnected porous structure of a fracture surface of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel, respectively. The high porosity of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel provided empty channels that could absorb large amounts of water [28]. The dehydrated functionalized hydrogel composite showed an irregularly wrinkled surface presenting well distributed SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 4(c)). EDS mapping (Fig. 4(d)) indicated the presence of 57.41% of C and 42.59% of Zn, confirming that the dispersion of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles on the PVA-g-PAM hydrogel surface was homogeneous."
11,Thermal behavior,"3.2 Thermal behavior Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel showed a 3-step weight loss (Fig. 5 ). The initial step occurred below 120 °C and was due to the evaporation of absorbed water. The second step occurred from 235 to 380 °C. This step produced the major weight loss due to decomposition of amide and hydroxyl side groups of the polymers. The final step, in the range from 385 to 500 °C, was related to the degradation of polymer backbones [15,26]. A similar trend was observed for the PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite. However, initial decomposition, which occurred at 281.5 °C in the case of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel, took place at 315.4 °C. This difference indicates that the SiO2@ZnO surface coating produced an improvement in thermal stability. TGA of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles in the same condition but over an extended temperature range up to 900 °C showed a very slight weight loss of surface-adsorbed water (~3%) during initial heating (25 °C–150 °C). No further weight loss was observed at high temperature and the weight remaining of the sample was 97% at 900 °C. The result indicated that the SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles were thermally stable within the study range. Therefore, the difference of 3.04% between the residual weight of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel (19.29%) and PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite (22.33%) was attributed to the content of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles in the composite."
12,Mechanical stability,"3.3 Mechanical stability Tensile strength and compressive modulus of the hydrogels in the fully swollen state could not be measured by the Universal Testing Machine because the hydrogel broke in the grip and the thickness of the swollen hydrogel was less than 20 mm which was the limit of the instrument. Therefore, the mechanical stability of the hydrogels was tested using an external load of 1500 g. Since pure PVA hydrogel showed very low water absorption and MB removal, it was not studied for comparison. The results showed that pure PAM hydrogel broke into small pieces under load and the sample was easily broken even with gentle handling whereas PVA-g-PAM hydrogel remained in shape under load and could be twisted without breaking (Fig. 6 ). This result indicated that pure PAM hydrogel had lower mechanical stability than PVA-g-PAM hydrogel."
13,Water absorbency and dye adsorption,"3.4 Water absorbency and dye adsorption The hydrogel exhibited excellent water absorbency of 7915%. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show PVA-g-PAM hydrogel before and after water absorption. The crosslinked network structure and hydrophilicity of amide and hydroxyl groups on the PAM-g-PVA produced a high osmotic pressure between the hydrogel and the solution [25,29]. The present hydrogel exhibited a much higher level of water absorption than was achieved in previous works (Table 1 ). In addition, the PVA-g-PAM hydrogel removed 96% of MB from solution within 24 h (Fig. 7(c–d)) which was slightly better than the removal efficiency of pure PAM hydrogel and much better than that of pure PVA, which also exhibited very small expansion (Fig. 8 ). Removal of MB (initial concentration: 10 ppm) by the PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite increased rapidly during the initial period of adsorption. The removal was 94% after 10 h and reached the highest value of 96% at 20 h (Fig. 9 (a)). After this point, removal was constant due to the equilibrium between adsorption via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between dye molecules and available active sites on the hydrogel composite [12,36]. When initial dye concentration was 4500 ppm the adsorption capacity continuously rose to 757 mg/g due to the greater driving force between dye and hydrogel (Fig. 9(b)). However, at an initial dye concentration of 5000 ppm, removal was less efficient because the number of free active sites was limited [37,38]. The experimental data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms (Fig. 9(c), (d)) to determine the adsorption behavior of the dye at the surface of the hydrogel composite. The Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface whereas the Freundlich isotherm explains multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface [31]. Calculation of the coefficients of correlation (R 2) between the experimental data and both isotherms revealed that the data better fitted the Langmuir isotherm with an R 2 very close to unity, indicating monolayer adsorption of MB on the hydrogel composite [38,39]. Also, the theoretical q max from the Langmuir isotherm (769 mg/g) is very close to the experimental result. The present hydrogel composite showed a very high adsorption capacity for MB compared to hydrogel adsorbents in previous reports (Table 1). Experimental and calculated data from adsorption studies are listed in Table 2 . Separation factors (R L) calculated at all initial concentrations lie within the range of 0–1, indicating that this hydrogel composite is favorable for MB adsorption [20]. The adsorption mechanism was explored using PFO and PSO models. R 2 with the PSO model was higher and the calculated q e was closer to the experimental data than those of PFO. It can be inferred that the PSO model was more appropriate to the experimental results and therefore adsorption occurred via chemisorption with the rate constant of 6.12 × 10−3 g/mg min [37]."
14,Photodegradation of methylene blue,"3.5 Photodegradation of methylene blue Photographs of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel and PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composites before and after exposure to UV irradiation (Fig. 10 ) show that the PVA-g-PAM hydrogels were the same color before and after irradiation whereas the PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composites lost color after irradiation. The loss of color in the hydrogel composites indicates degradation of adsorbed MB due to catalysis by SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles. The efficiency of photodegradation over SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles depended on the initial concentration of the dye solution. Efficiency decreased with increments of MB concentration. After the same time period (8 h), the hydrogel composite that had adsorbed MB at an initial concentration of 3 ppm became colorless while the sample that had adsorbed MB at an initial concentration of 10 ppm was still light blue (Fig. 10(d), (f)). Under UV irradiation, MB adsorbed by the hydrogel composite from MB solutions at initial concentrations from 3 ppm to 100 ppm could be degraded (Fig. 11 ). As the initial concentration of the MB solution increased, however, longer irradiation times were required to completely decolorize the hydrogel composite. The difference in efficiency occurred because the higher number of MB molecules adsorbed on the surface of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles reduced the number of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) generated by the ZnO photocatalyst per MB molecule, and photodegradation decreased [15]. The practical advantages of this hydrogel composite include excellent MB adsorption capacity, ease of sample handling, effective degradation of adsorbed MB that prevents production of secondary waste, and elimination of the photocatalyst-separation step. The mechanism of MB degradation under UV irradiation is proposed in Fig. 12 . Upon UV exposure, electrons and holes were generated in the conduction band and valence band, respectively, and transferred to the surface of ZnO nanoparticles. The excited electrons reacted with dissolved oxygen gas producing superoxide radical anions ( O 2 ⋅ − ) while the holes reacted with water molecules to form ·OH. These reactive species further decomposed MB molecules adsorbed in the hydrogel, resulting in non-toxic small molecules, water, and carbon dioxide [23,40]. The decolorization of MB (an initial concentration of 10 ppm) in the PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite was then investigated over 24 h of irradiation. As exposure time increased, the photodegradation of adsorbed MB increased, and the color of the hydrogel changed from dark blue to light blue to almost off-white at 92% degradation after 24 h (Fig. 13 (a)). The kinetics study showed that the concentration of MB gradually decreased with irradiation time and fitted well to PFO kinetics with an R 2 > 0.99. The rate of MB degradation, determined from the slope of the plot (Fig. 13(b)), was 0.1019 h−1. This rate is faster than rates reported previously using photocatalyst-hydrogel composites with higher contents of photocatalyst [13,41,42]. The excellent photocatalytic performance of the developed PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite probably derived from improved charge transfer and delayed charge recombination resulting from the direct silane bridge attachment of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles to the surface of PVA-g-PAM hydrogel [24]. The significant advantage of this hydrogel composite was the ease of handling due to its high mechanical stability. The reusability of the PVA-g-PAM/SiO2@ZnO hydrogel composite for both MB adsorption and decolorization by UV irradiation was examined. Note that the hydrogel composite sheet did not require recollecting, chemical-desorption, washing, or drying processes before the next cycle. The MB adsorption efficiency of the hydrogel composite slightly decreased but remained higher than 90% on the 5th cycle. However, MB decolorization efficiency at 24 h of UV irradiation decreased from 93% to 57% (Fig. 14 ). Although adsorption capacity remained as high as the virgin hydrogel composite, the reused hydrogel composite required longer irradiation time for MB decolorization on the second and third cycles, probably due to the loss of SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles from the surface of the hydrogel. This hydrogel composite provided good recyclability suitable for practical application and prevented production of secondary waste."
15,Degradation of hydrogel,"3.6 Degradation of hydrogel Thermal degradation and photodegradation of PAM were reported to be difficult [43]. The degradation of the developed hydrogel composite was evaluated using a weathering simulator. PAM hydrogel shrank and became discolored after QUV testing (Fig. 15 (a) and (d)). Some surface cracks were observed under SEM. The degraded PVA-g-PAM hydrogel presented several holes of various sizes (Fig. 15(e)). These morphological changes indicated greater degradation of the polymer than occurred in pure PAM, due no doubt to being grafted to degradable PVA. The surface coating with SiO2@ZnO photocatalyst accelerated degradation of the polymers. More cracks were present in the degraded composite and the surface ridges present on the composite before weathering were no longer visible on the degraded sample (Fig. 15(f)). This result indicated that surface functionalization with SiO2@ZnO photocatalyst accelerated hydrolysis and depolymerization under UV irradiation [44,45]."
16,Conclusions,"Synthesized poly(vinyl alcohol)-g-polyacrylamide hydrogel was surface-coated with SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles via silane bridges. SEM and TGA analyses confirmed the direct attachment to the surface of the hydrogel of the photocatalytic nanoparticles at 3 wt%. The PVA-g-PAM hydrogel exhibited good mechanical stability under load. The hydrogel could absorb an amount of water equivalent to 7915% of its dry weight and remove 96% of MB dye from aqueous solution with a maximum adsorption capacity of 797 mg/g. The data from adsorption and kinetics studies were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order model, indicating that adsorption of MB on the hydrogel composite was monolayer and occurred via chemisorption. Under UV irradiation, the SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles photocatalyzed degradation of adsorbed MB in the hydrogel at the rate of 0.1019 h−1. This hydrogel composite provided good recyclability both in adsorption and decolorization. The hydrogel composite was also potentially photodegradable. This material makes possible the development of a closed loop wastewater treatment system that does not produce secondary toxic waste."
