0,Introduction,"The worlds increasing population and its ever growing hunger for energy cannot keep in pace with the production of energy, thus in order to satisfy socio economic development and welfare of humans the transition from non renewable to renewable energy sources must be made quickly.[1].There are several renewable sources of energy like geothermal, hydropower, wind and solar energy[2] hydrogen fuel, another renewable source which is generated via photo catalytic process is a relatively clean and safe fuel, it has no carbon footprint. It has a wide variety of applications starting from the simple fuel cells to the hydrogen fuelled electric cars.[3] Materials such as TiO2 and its composites have been widely researched to conduct the splitting of water in presence of solar energy [4,5]. The application of TiO2 alone as catalyst under solar irradiation is limited by its wider band gap of 3.2 eV. Ti in TiO2, has a low energy valance band, because it has empty d orbitals, which is greatly influenced by 2p orbitals of oxygen [6,7,8]. Conducting polymers are now receiving significant attraction in areas such as catalysis, sensing and energy storage. Among the polymers PANI is versatile, because of its larger surface area, good electrical conductivity, flexibility and superior and controllable hydrophilic behaviour. [9] Here, we synthesized TiO2, through acid precipitation and thermal decomposition method and we incorporated this into a PANI matrix through in-situ polymerisation reaction. Both structural and optical properties of the composite were studied. The catalyst assisted splitting of water in presence of solar radiation was evaluated for their hydrogen evolution activity under various conditions that alter the catalytic performance. The purity and amount of hydrogen evolved were also confirmed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of TiO2,"2.1 Preparation of TiO2 TiO2, was prepared from titanium metal turnings using acid precipitation method, which is immediately followed by thermal decomposition process.100 mL of 6 N HCl was prepared, to this 1 g of sieved Ti turnings were added. The resulting solution was then stirred on a magnetic stirrer (750 rpm) for 4 h. The precipitate thus formed was then filtered, washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried. Drying was done in an oven at 80 0C for 1 h followed by calcination at 450 0C for 2 h. It was then cooled to room temperature and crushed to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle [10]."
3,Synthesis of TiO2/PANI composite,"2.2 Synthesis of TiO2/PANI composite TiO2/PANI composite was prepared using the as-synthesized TiO2 by in situ polymerization from aniline solution. 0.1 M Aniline solution was prepared in 200 mL of 0.1 M solution of phosphoric acid. The synthesized TiO2, powder in pre-determined quantities was added to the aniline solution with constant stirring with the help of a magnetic stirrer (750 rpm) in each preparation. The chilled solution of 0.1 M ammonium persulfate was added drop wise to the pre-cooled aniline–acid mixture for a period of 1.5 h with constant stirring. The resultant TiO2/PANI composite thus, formed was filtered and washed with distilled water to remove excess acid content. The as-prepared polymer composite was dried in an oven at about 80 °C for 2 h. The composite after cooling to room temperature was crushed to a fine powder using a pestle and mortar."
4,Characterization of composite,"2.3 Characterization of composite The crystallite structure of both TiO2 and TiO2/PANI composite was done by Philips XPERT-MPD X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and a secondary monochromator having a range 2θ = 200 to 800. The size of the crystalline composite was calculated from XRD data using Scherrer equation DXRD = 0.9λ/ β cosθ, Where λ is the wavelength, θ is the diffraction angle and β is the full width half maximum in radians. Morphological study of the photo catalyst was conducted using TEM (Transmission electron microscope). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis using nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique was also done (Auto Sorp-1-Mp surface area 2008) to analyse the specific surface area and pore size distribution of both TiO2and TiO2/PANI composite. UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the synthesized composites were recorded using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer at room temperature in the wavelength ranges from 300 nm to 800 nm. The optical band gap energy of the synthesized TiO2/PANI composite and the pure TiO2 were calculated and compared using Tauc plot obtained from Kubelka – munk equation. The e- — h+ recombination rate in the prepared composites was evaluated by Photoluminescence spectroscopy using Hitachi FL 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer."
5,Photo catalytic activity,"2.4 Photo catalytic activity The water splitting reaction in the presence of TiO2 /PANI composite was carried out in a 50 mL glass reactor (diameter: 3 cm and length: 6.2 cm) at room temperature. The composite was added to 50 mL water. Irradiation was carried out using a solar stimulator (Science Tech. Pvt. Ltd) (1000 mW/cm2). The system was under constant magnetic stirring at 750 rpm. The volume of gas evolved was noted and the purity of the evolved gas was confirmed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent technologies 7820 A). The experiment was repeated to test the stability and reusability of the composite towards photo catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterization of the composite,"3.1 Characterization of the composite 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction studies The characteristic peaks observed at 2θ = 26.30, 37.40, 45.660, 53.650, 55.310 grown along (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) crystal planes in Fig. 1 .(A) suggested that the TiO2 within the composite is presented in its active anatase form. The diffraction pattern of the composite revealed peaks at 2θ = 14.90, 20.30 and 25.80 corresponds to the occurrence of PANI nanocrystallites in its catalytically active emeraldine base form as shown in Fig. 1.(B).The low intensity of peaks in the composite compared to bare TiO2 suggested an interaction between PANI and TiO2 [11] . 3.1.2 TEM analysis The technique involves transmission of a beam of electrons through our composite which results in the formation of an image which is then magnified and focused on to a photographic film. The imaging is of high resolution and is used for obtaining atomic level information. Surface morphology of the TiO2/PANI composite was analysed using Transmission electron microscopy. The TiO2 decorated polyaniline network structure was confirmed from the TEM image shown in Fig. 2 (A) the elemental determination of TiO2/PANI composite was further carried out using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy[12]. The result of analysis was embedded in Fig. 2(B). 3.1.3 BET analysis As surface properties play a prominent role in catalysis, the surface parameters of the synthesized catalytic materials were evaluated by BET analysis. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) plots showing adsorption–desorption isotherms of pure TiO2 and TiO2/PANI composites were represented in Fig. 3 . (A) and Fig. 3. (B) Respectively. The isotherms in Fig. 3. (A) and (B) were identified as type IV [13,14].This high N2 adsorption value (p/p°> 0.44) of the composite indicated the mesoporous nature of the composite. The hysteresis loop shows that the lines plotted are almost parallel to each other and vertical. Therefore it is concluded that, the catalyst contains slit like, even shaped, mesopores that are not interconnected by channels. The BET surface area of TiO2 has increased from 92.5 m2/g to 122.1 m2/g upon composite formation with polyaniline Fig. 3. (C). the high specific surface area and mesoporous surface reiterates the improved catalytic behavior of composite."
8,Optical properties,"3.2 Optical properties 3.2.1 UV–visible studies The UV visible absorption spectrum of TiO2 and TiO2 /PANI composite was shown in Fig. 4 . (A). The TiO2 shows an absorption peak at 368 nm while the absorption maximum in TiO2/PANI composite was found at 588 nm. The red shift refers to the potential of the catalytic composite to absorb in the visible region of the spectrum. The reflectance values derived by DRS studies were converted according to kubelka–munk theory. The Tauc plots thus obtained were shown in Fig. 4. (B) and Fig. 4. (C) .The band gap of pureTiO2 has decreased from 2.94 to 2.64 eV on introducing it in to PANI matrix. The decreased band gap is due to overlapping of 2p orbitals of O and N [15,16]. The lower band gap enable the catalytic composite to absorb strongly in the visible region. 3.2.2 Photoluminescence studies The rate of recombination of electron-hole pairs is significant in photo catalysis. PL studies were used to ensure the surface availability of charge carriers. The peak intensity in PL spectrum corresponds to fluorescence emission and hence to the rate of e- - h+ recombination.TiO2 has its highest emission at about 462 nm (A), PANI revealed its utmost emission at 496 nm (B) and TiO2/PANI has its maximum emission at 475 nm (C). Fig. 5 .The lowest peak intensity of PANI/ TiO2 compared to either TiO2 or PANI referred to the lowest rate of charge recombination and hence to greater availability of surface electrons for water reduction [17,18]."
9,Evaluation of photo catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"3.3 Evaluation of photo catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction 3.3.1 Photo catalytic activity The PANI/ TiO2 composites of different ratios were made. The composites were prepared by varying polyaniline concentration and by changing quantity of TiO2 addition. Hydrogen evolution activity of all the prepared composites were studied by adding the required amount of photo catalyst to a 50 mL glass reactor filled with water. Among the composites 0.1 M PANI/0.1 g TiO2 produced maximum volume of hydrogen evolution at about 683.5 μ mol h-1. The maximum activity was shown by 0.1 g of composite in 50 mL water. The activity of catalysts prepared in various ratios was recorded in Table 1 . The volume of hydrogen delivered by various amount of 0.1 M PANI/0.1 g TiO2 was shown in Fig. 6 . The action of hole scavengers on photo catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was studied. Hole scavengers deter de excitation of electrons to holes in the valance band. Here in we evaluated the action of t-butanol, isopropanol, and methanol towards photo catalytic activity. Fig. 7 . represents volume of hydrogen evolved in the presence and absence of sensitizers. The maximum hydrogen production was observed with t-butanol due to its better electron releasing ability among the three selected alcohols. 3.3.2 Photo stability measurements The evaluation of photo catalytic stability is important as it is inevitable for industrial use. Long term catalytic activity is evaluated for a period of 4 h with 0.1 g of 0.1 M PANI/0.1 g TiO2 in 50 mL water. The catalyst revealed its highest activity within the first 1 h, thereafter volume of hydrogen evolved was decreased. The observation is plotted in Fig. 8 .(A).The observed decrease in Hydrogen production with passage of time can be due to the restructuring of the catalyst caused by the deactivation of catalytic surface. In order to study the reusability of the TiO2/PANI composite, it is recovered from the solution after 1 h, washed and dried at 80 0C for half an hour and reused for the next catalytic cycle. It was observed that the same volume of hydrogen was delivered for the second cycle also. The photo catalytic activity of the composite was retained even in the third catalytic cycle. The reusability of the proposed composite towards water splitting reaction was shown in Fig. 8.(B)"
10,Analysis of the purity of hydrogen gas evolved,3.4 Analysis of the purity of hydrogen gas evolved The purity of the hydrogen evolved by TiO2/PANI catalyst was determined by comparison against standard hydrogen by GC measurements. According to the Fig. 9 . Hydrogen produced by the TiO2/PANI catalyst had the similar characteristics as that of standard hydrogen. A peak with 98.7% area was obtained by the GC injection of hydrogen gas obtained from the catalysts with a retention time of 2.7985 min.
11,Mechanism of catalysis,"3.5 Mechanism of catalysis On irradiation, excitation of electrons happens from the valence band to conduction band of PANI which has a band gap of about 1.8 eV thus creating holes at the valence band. The electrons reaching at the conduction band of PANI will be jumping to the conduction band of TiO2. These electrons then transferred to the surface of catalyst to enhance the splitting of water to produce hydrogen. Similar type of excitation also occurs in TiO2 but at low rate due to wider band gap. Thus produced holes at the valence band of TiO2 move to the valence band of PANI .These holes then move towards the surface of PANI causing the evolution of O2. In conclusion, TiO2 has a suitable band structure to act as a catalyst for water splitting reaction but its band gap is not suitable to act under visible radiation. Whereas PANI has a suitable band gap with a poor band structure hence combined to form composite which has a suitable band structure as well as band gap of about 2.64 eV to work as efficient water splitting photo catalyst. The Fig. 10 . shows the diagrammatic representation."
12,Conclusion,Herein we successfully developed a novel Titanium dioxide decorated polyaniline nanocomposite for photo catalytic water splitting reaction. The band gap of anatase phased TiO2 is tuned successfully from 2.94 eV to 2.64 by incorporating it into PANI network. 0.1 g of 0.1 M PANI/0.1 g TiO2 in 50 mL water delivered 721.1 μ mol h-1 of hydrogen in presence of t-butanol. The action of sensitizers follows the order t-butanol ˃ isopropanol ˃ methanol .The activity of the catalytic composite revealed its maximum within a period of 1 h after that the activity found decreased. Whereas the reusability analysis confirmed that the catalyst can recover its activity after a process of activation.
