0,Introduction,"Since 1973, when Levy and Boudart [1] reported that WC displayed reactivity similar to Pt for hydrogenation reactions, there has been considerable interest in the catalytic properties of metal carbides, particularly of the group VI transition metals. As a new type of catalytic material, molybdenum carbide might be used as a cheaper substitute for catalysts of various reactions [1]. It has been shown to be promising catalysts for CO hydrogenation [2–4], hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [5], hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [5], hydrocarbon isomerization [6], etc. [7,8]. In the field of syngas chemistry, the studies of molybdenum carbides have attracted more attention. Molybdenum carbides have been reported to be active for synthesis of light hydrocarbons in the liquefied petroleum gas range from carbon monoxide and hydrogen [2,9]. Leclercq et al. [3] and Woo et al. [4] have clearly revealed that molybdenum carbides produced mainly light alkanes, whereas the formation of alcohols is related to the surface stoichiometry and to the extent of carburization [3]. Promotion of molybdenum carbide by potassium has been found to greatly enhance the selectivity to alcohols [4]. Investigations of molybdenum carbides have also been carried out in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO/H2 over cobalt or ruthenium promoted molybdenum carbides have been evidenced by Constant et al. [9] and the results reveal that molybdenum carbide give light hydrocarbons and alcohols, the addition of Ru decrease the alcohol production whereas Co increase formation of heavy hydrocarbons. Our previous studies also reveal that molybdenum carbides (both β-Mo2C and α-MoC1−X ) produce mainly light hydrocarbons, only little alcohols are obtained. For both β-Mo2C and α-MoC1−X , the additions of potassium as a promoter, result in remarkable selectivity shift from hydrocarbons to alcohols. Moreover, the potassium promoter enhances the ability of chain propagation of β-Mo2C and α-MoC1−X with higher selectivity to C 2 + OH [10]. Our results also reveal that the K/β-Mo2C catalyst is far more active and selective than K/α-MoC1−X catalyst in terms of catalytic performance of HAS, and its optimum of K/Mo molar ratio was about 1/5 [10]. It appears that molybdenum carbides could be potential catalytic materials for CO hydrogenation reactions. As reported elsewhere [11–14], the addition of 3d transition metals (such as Co, Ni, Rh and Pd) is found to be able to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of C 2 + alcohols over MoS2-based catalysts. In this regard, it can be speculated that the 3d transition metals may also have positive effect on HAS from CO hydrogenation over β-Mo2C-based catalysts, and much less information is available. According to the literature [2,4,9,10], the promotion effects of Fischer–Tropsch elements over the β-Mo2C-based catalysts for HAS are not studied systematically at present. In this work, the Fischer–Tropsch elements modified K/β-Mo2C catalysts were prepared for HAS and the characteristics of β-Mo2C-based catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis were also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation The molybdenum carbide prepared through Temperature-Programmed-Reaction (TPRe) method and it could be found elsewhere [10,15,16]. In detail, the β-Mo2C and M/β-Mo2C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) with the hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure were prepared by direct carburization of the MoO3 and MMo oxide precursors, respectively. The oxide precursors for bimetallic carbides were prepared by mechanically mixing a stoichiometric amount of the corresponding nitrate, e.g. Fe(NO3)3 ·9H2O, Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O or Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O with (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O, the mixture was then calcined at 673K for several hours. 6.0g of the oxide precursor (particle size 0.7–1.2mm) was placed in the reactor supported on a quartz wool plug. The quartz tube reactor (i.d.=0.8cm and length=40cm) was heated with an electric furnace (Lindberg, model 55031), and the reactor temperature was controlled using a programmable temperature controller (Omega, CN-2010). TPRe was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a flow of 20.0v% CH4/H2 gas mixture. The temperature was linearly increased at the rate of 60K/h from room temperature (RT) to 973K, where it was maintained for additional hours. Then the samples were quenched to RT and gradually passivated with 1.0v% O2/N2 before exposure to air. K2CO3 modification (K/Mo=1/5) was accomplished by a post-doping procedure after synthesis of the final carbide. The alkalinization was carried out by physically mixing K2CO3 with the final carbide, and then the mixture was calcined at 773K to obtain catalysts. The as-prepared catalysts all had definitive phase of the β-Mo2C [16] (2θ =34.4°, 38.0°, 39.4°, 52.1°, 61.5°, 69.6°, 74.6° and 75.6° for β-Mo2C [100], [002], [101], [102], [110], [103], [112] and [201], respectively)."
3,CO hydrogenation,"2.2 CO hydrogenation The CO hydrogenation was conducted with a fixed-bed, stainless flow reactor and the loadings of catalysts was 2.0ml (pellets, 40–60mesh). The products were analyzed by 1790-GC (Agilent), H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were analyzed by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped with a TDX-101 column. The water and methanol in liquids were also detected by TCD with a GDX-401 column, but the alcohols and hydrocarbons were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) with a Propake-Q column [10]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalytic performances of CO hydrogenation,"3.1 Catalytic performances of CO hydrogenation The results of CO hydrogenation over the samples are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . Clearly, Fe, Co, Ni had the similar ability of promoting the carbon chain growth for K/β-Mo2C catalyst, which gave rise to the higher content of C 2 + OH in liquid products compared with K/β-Mo2C catalyst. The Fischer–Tropsch elements also improved the selectivity to hydrocarbons. However, the value of CH4 was greatly reduced, especially with the promotion of Fe (see Fig. 1). Among them, Ni modified K/β-Mo2C showed both high CO conversion and alcohols selectivity. However, Fe appeared a negative influence, though it led to an increase in the content of C 2 + OH . Another feature of K/β-Mo2C-based catalyst was high carbon dioxide yields (∼50C%) instead of water as a carbon monoxide product (not present in Table 1), which represented high water-gas shift activities of molybdenum carbide as frequently reported for unpromoted catalysts at atmospheric pressure [17,18]. The change in space-time-yield (STY) of alcohol and alcohol selectivity with time on stream is shown in Fig. 2 for K/Ni/β-Mo2C as an example. It showed an induction period, initially, the STY of alcohol and selectivity for alcohol synthesis were very low, but gradually increased with time on stream and reached a steady state after about 96h, it indicated that the catalyst was thermally stable under reaction conditions. Other catalysts also showed similar trends. Generally, molybdenum-based catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis had an induction period during the CO hydrogenation. For molybdenum carbide, a part of the surface oxygen on the β-Mo2C-based catalyst probably reacted with carbidic carbon and was removed from the uppermost surface layer during this induction period [9]. It was also believed that during the induction, some surface carbon atoms of carbide and some deposited carbon species were eliminated [19]."
6,Product distribution over the catalysts,"3.2 Product distribution over the catalysts Fig. 3 shows Anderson–Schultz–Flory (A–S–F) distributions of alcohols and hydrocarbons [20]. The distribution of hydrocarbons obeyed the linear A–S–F plot for catalysts. The chain growth probability increased remarkably compared with K/β-Mo2C and followed the sequence, Fe>Ni∼Co. Contrary to the traditional linear A–S–F distribution of hydrocarbons, the alcohols showed remarkable deviation of methanol, indicating a different reaction mechanism for alcohols formation over the catalysts. However, it was worth noting that the C2–C4 alcohols still followed a linear distribution plot for modified catalysts, and their chain-growth probabilities P were much higher than K/β-Mo2C catalyst with the sequence: Ni>Fe>Co. Regarding the reaction mechanism leading to the formation of higher alcohols, the following two aspects were important. One was how the first chain growth step (C1–C2) took place and with C1 species involved, the other was to account for the deviation from the A–S–F distribution leading to the preferred formation of higher alcohols [14,21]. With the K/β-Mo2C-based catalyst, the formation of higher alcohols likely proceeded via a classical insertion of CO into the corresponding precursor alcohol, CHx [21]."
7,Apparent activation energies and separated chain propagation,"3.3 Apparent activation energies and separated chain propagation The apparent activation energies are summarized in Table 2 , which calculated from the Arrhenius plots [22]. The Co or Ni caused a decrease in apparent activation energies for C1–C4 alcohols, indicating that Co or Ni had strong ability of producing alcohols (see Tables 1 and 2). However, Fe led to a decrease in apparent activation energies for C2–C4 alcohols and a slight increase for methanol, which explained higher selectivity to C 2 + OH and the lower selectivity to total alcohols. Generally, the step of C1OH–C2OH was a bottleneck for the mixed alcohols synthesis, thus, the lower apparent activation energies for C2–C4 alcohols over K/M/β-Mo2C (M=Fe, Co and Ni) favored the higher alcohols synthesis. Compared with Cs/Cu/ZnO catalyst in Ref. [22], the K/β-Mo2C-based catalysts were more favorable to the formation of C 2 + OH in terms of apparent activation energies. The plots in Fig. 4 showed that Fischer–Tropsch elements had a great promoting effect on the carbon chain growth [23]. The ability decreased as the carbon number increased and followed the sequence: Fe>Ni>Co. Fe showed the highest ability, which was responsible for its high selectivity to hydrocarbons. As a result, Ni was more effective for higher alcohols synthesis than Fe or Co."
8,Conclusions,"For K/β-Mo2C catalyst, Fe, Co, Ni showed the similar ability of promoting the carbon chain growth, in particular, for the step of C1–C2. However, the promotion effects were different with the sequence: Ni≫Co>Fe for the activity and Ni>Co>Fe for the alcohols selectivity. The apparent activation energies for the alcohols formation decreased over the Ni or Co modified K/β-Mo2C catalysts, whereas Fe caused a slight increase for methanol and decrease for C2–C4 alcohols."
