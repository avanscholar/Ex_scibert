0,Introduction,"Nanostructured porous materials with high specific surface area are promising adsorbents for hydrogen storage [1–3], which avoid most of drawbacks of another type of hydrogen storage material − metal hydrides, such as the inherent slow kinetics and thermodynamic energy inefficiency. Among various nanostructured porous materials, porous carbon with well-ordered pore systems is particularly useful as gas storage media due to their remarkable properties [2–5], such as high specific surface areas, large pore volumes, chemical inertness, easy handling and low cost of manufacture [6]. Porous carbon materials with ordered pore channels may be obtained via the template carbonization method, which involves the introduction of suitable carbon precursors into the pores of a hard template followed by carbonization and finally removal of the template [6–10]. A variety of inorganic templates including microporous zeolites and mesoporous silicas can be used to generate porous carbons [6,7,10–14]. Zeolites have been used as template because of their versatility and attractive three-dimensional pore channels [11,12,15–23]. The wall thickness of zeolites is usually less than 1 nm [15], the periodic pore structures and well-defined internal nanospaces of zeolites therefore provide opportunities to control over the nanostructure and the morphology of microporous carbon materials at nanometre level. Depending on the synthesis conditions, carbon materials derived from the replication of the structural regularity of zeolite templates can usually exhibit high total surface area and pore volume with significant microporosity [11,12,16–24], which may benefit high hydrogen uptake. So far a variety of zeolites, such as zeolite Y, X, β, ZSM-5, LTA, modenite, silicate-I and EMC-2 [16–19,21,22,24–26]; [12,27–32] have been demonstrated as templates for the preparation of high surface area of porous carbons [11,12,16–24]. But only few zeolites can successfully transfer their structural orders to corresponding porous carbon replicas [16–18,21,22,28,29,31,32]. It is now recognised that zeolite materials which possess two- or three-dimensional large pore channel system combined with non-cubic symmetry are suitable templates to replicate their structural orders to corresponding carbon materials [18,21]. Moreover, the structural regularity and pore size of the templated porous carbon materials may be varied by choice of synthesis strategies [18,21,26]. The type of carbon precursors, the way of introducing carbon precursors, carbonisation conditions and heat treatment history are all important parameters which can affect the replication of structural order of zeolite templates [18,20,21,26,27,32–34]. In general, a high level of replication of zeolite-like structural order in templated porous carbon materials requires extensive infiltration of the carbon precursors into the pores of the zeolite templates [16–18,20,21,26], which can be realised by the introduction of carbon precursors through different methods such as the combination of impregnation method with chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method or by varying the heat treatment history [16–18,20,21,26,35]. In this report, we have systematically studied the effect of heat treatment on the structural order, textural properties and hydrogen uptake behaviour of porous carbon materials templated from zeolite EMC-2 at various CVD temperatures. The heat treatment conditions are optimized to obtain structurally well-ordered porous carbon materials. We show that a heat treatment at high temperature is a simple and general strategy to prepare structurally well-ordered microporous carbon materials from various zeolite templates with high surface area and improved hydrogen storage capacities. However, mesoporous carbons templated from mesoporous silicas do not show any benefit from the heat treatment."
1,Experimental,
2,Material synthesis,"2.1 Material synthesis Zeolite EMC-2 and β were synthesized following the literature reports [36,37]. Zeolite 13X and Y templates were purchased from Fluka. Mesoporous silicas SBA-15, MCM-48 and HMS were synthesized using established procedures [38–42]. A typical synthesis procedure for the porous carbon materials was as follows: an alumina boat with 0.6 g of zeolite EMC-2 was placed in a flow-through tube furnace. The furnace was heated to the required temperature (500–800 °C) under an argon flow and then maintained at the target temperature for 3 h under a flow of ethylene gas of 100 mL/min, followed by either directly cooled down to room temperature under an argon flow, or further heat treatment in an argon atmosphere at 900 °C for 3 h, finally cooled down to room temperature under an argon flow. The resulting carbon/zeolite composites were recovered and washed with 10% hydrofluoric (HF) acid several times, followed by refluxing at 60 °C in concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to completely remove the zeolite framework. Finally, the resulting carbon materials were dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight. (Thermogravimetric analysis of the HF-treated and HCl refluxed carbons in air indicated a residual mass typically lower than 2% at 800 °C, which confirmed that the carbon materials were virtually zeolite-free.) The carbon samples templated from zeolite EMC-2 and using ethylene as carbon precursor were denoted as CEM600, CEM650, CEM700, CEM750 and CEM800, corresponding to CVD temperatures of 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C, respectively. For those samples subjected to a further heat treatment at 900 °C for 3 h in argon, the obtained carbon samples were denoted as CEM500HT, CEM600HT, CEM650HT, CEM700HT, CEM750HT and CEM800HT, which are corresponding to CVD temperature 500, 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C, respectively. HT stands for the extra high temperature treatment at 900 °C for 3 h in Ar. Other heat treatment samples were denoted as CEM700-X/Y, where X stands for the heat treatment temperature and Y means the heat treatment duration. For example, CEM700-900/6 means the sample synthesized at CVD temperature of 700 °C, then an extra heat treatment at 900 °C in Ar for 6 h. Using ethylene as carbon precursor at the CVD temperature of 700–850 °C and zeolite X, Y or mesoporous silicas SBA-15, MCM-48 and HMS as hard template, the resulting carbon materials were denoted as CXET700, CYET700, CMK3ET, CMK1ET and CHMSET, respectively. The samples subjected to further heat treatment at 900 °C for 3 h in Ar were denoted as CXET700HT, CYET700HT, CMK3ETHT, CMK1ETHT and CHMSETHT, respectively. Acetonitrile was also used as carbon precursor and zeolite EMC-2 or β as template at CVD temperature of 800 °C for 3 h, the obtained carbon samples were labelled as CEMAN800 and CBTAN800. The heat treatment samples were designed as CEMAN800HT and CBTAN800HT, respectively. A sample named as CEMFAET was synthesized using zeolite EMC-2 as template and a two-step synthesis procedure including first impregnation with furfuryl alcohol followed by CVD with ethylene at 700 °C for 3 h. The further heat treatment sample was denoted as CEMFAETHT."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization Powder XRD analysis was performed using a Philips Advanced D8 powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 25 mA), 0.02° step size, and 2 s step time. Textural properties were determined via nitrogen sorption at −196 °C using a conventional volumetric technique on a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ sorptometer. Before analysis, the sample was evacuated for 12 h at 300 °C under vacuum. The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on adsorption data in the partial pressure (P/P o) range 0.02–0.22, and total pore volume was determined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P o) ca. 0.99. (We note that the BET method has limitations with respect to calculating the surface area of microporous materials, but is suitably used here for comparative analysis of the surface area of a set of micro-/mesoporous samples. The partial pressure range (P/P o) 0.02–0.22, for the calculation of surface area was selected taking into account previous reports that indicate that using low partial pressure range P/P o 0.01–0.05, overestimates the surface area while using the partial pressure range P/P o 0.1–0.3 can underestimate the surface area [18]). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Thermal Advantage SDT Q600 instrument with a heating rate of 2 °C/min under an air flow rate of 100 mL/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Philips XL-30 scanning electron microscope. Samples were mounted using a conductive carbon double-sided sticky tape. A thin (ca. 10 nm) coating of gold sputter was deposited onto the samples to reduce the effects of charging. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL 2000-FX electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Samples for analysis were prepared by spreading them on a holey carbon film supported on a grid."
4,Hydrogen uptake measurements,"2.3 Hydrogen uptake measurements Gravimetric analysis of hydrogen uptake capacities was performed using high-purity hydrogen (99.9999%) over the pressure range 0–20 bar with an Intelligent Gravimetric Analyser (IGA-003, Hiden), which incorporates a microbalance capable of measuring weights with a resolution of ±0.2 μg. The samples in the analysis chamber of the IGA-003 were evacuated to 10−10 bar and kept at 250 °C overnight before measurement. The hydrogen uptake measurements were carried out at −196 °C in a liquid nitrogen bath. The high-purity hydrogen (99.9999%) was additionally purified by a molecular sieve filter and a liquid nitrogen trap before used for the hydrogen uptake measurements."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Effect of heat treatment on structural order, porosities and hydrogen uptake capacities of microporous carbons templated from zeolite EMC-2","3.1 Effect of heat treatment on structural order, porosities and hydrogen uptake capacities of microporous carbons templated from zeolite EMC-2 Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the zeolite EMC-2 templated porous carbon materials prepared by CVD method at various temperatures using ethylene as carbon source. When no heat treatment was used, the XRD patterns of the resulting carbon materials in Fig. 1A (except sample CEM600 which was synthesized at CVD temperature of 600 °C) show a diffraction peak at 2θ of 6.1°. This peak is at the same position as the (100) diffraction of the zeolite ΕΜC-2 and therefore indicates that the carbon materials exhibit structural pore ordering similar to that of the zeolite template with a ‘basal spacing’ of ca. 1.4 nm, which agrees well with previous report [18]. The intensity of the ‘basal peak’ increases with CVD temperature from 650 to 800 °C. Moreover, for all the carbon materials prepared in the experimental CVD temperature range, a further peak at 2θ of 26° is observed, which is the (002) diffraction from graphitic carbon. The intensity and sharpness of this peak increase at higher CVD temperatures, suggesting greater proportions of graphitic carbon formed at higher CVD temperatures. When a heat treatment of 3 h at 900 °C in Ar was used for the carbon/zeolite composites obtained from CVD at various temperatures in ethylene, the XRD profiles of resulting carbon materials are presented in Fig. 1B. Similar to their corresponding counterparts without heat treatment, all the carbon materials derived from a further heat treatment exhibit a peak at 2θ = 6.1, implying the replication of zeolite structures into the resulting carbon materials. It is worth noting that even for the sample prepared at CVD temperature of 500 °C, after heat treatment, this basal peak is still visible. Besides the basal peak for all the carbon materials, the XRD patterns for heat treated samples prepared at CVD temperature higher than 600 °C exhibit a further peak at 2θ of 6.8°, which is at a position similar to the (101) diffraction of the zeolite ΕΜC-2 template. The second diffraction peak is consistent with a high level of replication of zeolite-type structural order in the carbon materials [18]. The intensity for the second diffraction peak increases with CVD temperature and exhibits the highest intensity at CVD temperature of 700 °C; Further increase of CVD temperature results in the decrease of intensity for this peak and virtually the (101) diffraction peak was merged with (100) diffraction peak when CVD temparture of 800 °C was used, implying the degradation of structural order of the carbon materials at higher CVD temperatures. The graphitic peak (002) at 2θ of 26° is not visible at lower CVD temperatures, but it becomes obvious at CVD temperatures higher than 700 °C. Compared Fig. 1B with Fig. 1A, it is clear that a heat treatment can result in the replication of two diffraction peaks from zeolite template EMC-2, indicating a significant improvement in the structural order of the resulting carbon materials. It is noteworthy that the CEM600 sample generated by CVD method at temperature of 600 °C does not exhibit any zeolite structural replication, possibly due to the formation of only a high molecular weight of polymer without fully carbonization. But a heat treatment the specimen synthesized at 600 °C results in a well-ordered carbon with two replication peaks from zeolite template, showing that the heat treatment plays an indispensable role in the formation of zeolite-like carbons. It is believed that during the CVD process, the high CVD temperature accelerates the carbonization of the carbon precursor on and within the surface/near surface region of the zeolite particles [22]. The accelerated carbonization process leads to the deposition of carbon particles mainly into the pore regions close to the outer surface (i.e., pore mouth) of the zeolite particle [22]. Removal of zeolite template leaves behind the formation of carbon particles with partially replication of the main diffraction peak of the zeolite template. Subject to a heat treatment in an inert atmosphere, the remaining carbon particles can further diffuse into the deep pore channels of the zeolite template under higher temperature, resulting in the formation of carbon particles dominated in the pore channel of the zeolite. Another possible explanation is that the carbon framework may be strengthened by the enhanced formation of chemical bonds after subject to the heat treatment. Removal of template from this more homogeneous distributed carbon/zeolite composite can surely bring up carbon material with higher structural order replicated from the zeolite template. The nitrogen sorption isotherms of the zeolite EMC-2 templated carbon materials prepared by CVD method at various temperatures using ethylene as carbon precursor are shown in Fig. 2 . When no heat treatment was used, the isotherms for the carbon samples exhibit some adsorption below P/P o of 0.02 (as shown in Fig. 2A), which may be ascribed to micropore filling. The isotherms also exhibit nitrogen uptake at P/P o > 0.2, which may be attributed to the adsorption into mesopores arising from interparticle voids, or may be due to the defects in the carbon pore system which probably caused by defects of the zeolite template. The textural properties of the carbons are summarized in Table 1 . The obtained carbon materials possess total surface area up to 950 m2/g and pore volume up to 0.63 cm3/g. Both total surface area and pore volume increase with CVD temperatures, and the sample obtained at CVD temperature of 700 °C displays the highest value. Further increase CVD temperatures results in the decrease of both surface area and pore volume, possibly due to the formation of more graphitic carbon particles at higher CVD temperatures, as confirmed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 1. Except sample CEM600, the other carbons possess around 62 ± 4% micropore surface area and up to 44% of micropore volume. The nitrogen sorption isotherms for carbon materials derived from a heat treatment were presented in Fig. 2B. Similar to their counterparts without heat treatment, the carbon materials generated from heat treatment exclusively exhibit typical isotherms for micorporous materials and there is little hysteresis loop between adsorption and desorption branches. As summarized in Table 1, the heat treated carbon samples have surface areas up to 2280 m2/g and pore volume up to 1.14 cm3/g. Clearly, the heat treated samples exclusively possess much higher surface areas and pore volumes, compared with their counterparts without heat treatment. The significant increase of textural properties is consistent with the remarkable improvement of zeolitic structural order of carbon materials, as demonstrated by XRD in Fig. 1. It is noteworthy that sample CEM650HT has the highest surface area while sample CEM600HT has the highest pore volume of 1.14 cm3/g. Among all the heat treated samples, CEM800HT obtained at CVD temperature of 800 °C exhibits the lowest surface area and pore volume, which are even lower than those of its untreated counterpart. This is not unexpected given the high levels of graphitisation in this high temperature synthesized carbon. It is also worth noting that among the heat treated samples, CEM700HT possesses the highest portion of microporosity, which contributes up to 81% of its total surface area and up to 65% of total pore volume. Overall, the textural data suggests that the heat treatment has remarkably improved both the total and micropore surface area and pore volume, while graphitization introduced by high CVD temperature compromised the surface area and pore volume of resulting carbon materials. To evaluate the thermal stabilities and combustion properties of the carbon materials, TGA of carbon/zeolite composites was performed in air. The TGA data also provided information on the carbon yield. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the TGA for sample CEM600 and CEM700 carbon/zeolite composites exhibits two mass loss events: the mass loss below 400 °C is due to the decomposition of high molecule hydrocarbon (polymer) that is not fully carbonized, which contributes to 15% and 5% mass loss for CEM600/zeolite and CEM700/zeolite composite, respectively; the event above 400 °C–600 °C is due to the burn off carbon. The burn-off temperature for carbon is centred at 485, 510 and 543 °C for sample CEM600, CEM700 and CEM800 respectively (see the inset in Fig. 3A). Clearly, higher CVD temperatures results in higher graphitization and higher burn-off temperature. On the other hand, the samples obtained with a heat treatment exclusively exhibit only the carbon burn off event and the burn-off temperature increases with the CVD temperature (see Fig. 3B). However, it is noteworthy that besides the burn off amorphous carbon at lower temperature of 490–520 °C, CEM700HT and CEM800HT also exhibit the carbon burn off peak above 550 °C, which is due to the burn off graphitic carbon. It is generally recognised that highly graphitic (or crystalline) carbons are thermally more stable compared to less crystalline or amorphous carbons [43–46]. The shift of combustion temperature from 480 °C to 620 °C therefore reveals a higher degree of graphitic ordering for samples prepared at higher CVD temperatures, which is in agreement with the XRD patterns in Fig. 1. The TGA of as-synthesized carbon/zeolite composites can be used to assess the carbon yield and the results are given in Table 1. The carbon yield increases from 0.16 g to 1.01 g of carbon per gram of EMC-2 zeolite template (i.e., 0.16 g of C/g of zeolite) with varying the CVD temperature from 600 to 800 °C. It is likely that at lower CVD temperature of 600 °C, the resulting material is still polymers that are not fully carbonized, which results in the high weight loss at temperature below 400 °C. The high carbon yield at CVD temperature of 800 °C can be explained that the zeolite pore channel system partially collapsed and the survived pore channel system was completely filled with carbon precursor. However, we don't rule out the possibility that the carbon deposition occurs too fast at high CVD temperature which may result in the blockage of pores of the template. Therefore carbon precursor cannot infiltrate into the pores but deposit on the outer surface of the template, which results in the formation of graphitic carbon (as shown in XRD patterns). A heat treatment of the carbon/zeolite composites at 900 °C for 3 h in Ar can obviously increase the carbon yield and the increase level of carbon yield depends on the CVD temperatures. At lower CVD temperatures, the carbon materials contain plenty of polymers that are not fully carbonized (as shown by the TGA curves for CEM600 and CEM700 in Fig. 3A), which can convert to carbon after the heat treatment. At higher CVD temperatures, however, the hydroxide groups in zeolite frameworks can go through condensation via loss of water which will result in the formation of more condensed phase for the template or even partially collapse of the zeolite pore channel system, consequently the carbon particles may deposit on the outer surface of zeolite particles and therefore the carbon yield increases. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to evaluate the particle morphology and Fig. 4 presents the representative SEM images of the carbon materials. The zeolite EMC-2 template shows sheet or disc-like particle morphology (not shown). The diameter for disc is no more than 3 μm and thickness less than 0.3 μm. Except sample CEM600, all the other carbon samples prepared at different CVD temperatures, whether they were subjected to a heat treatment or not, exclusively display disc-like or sheet-like particles, implying that the morphology of the zeolite EMC-2 template was transferred to the resulting carbon materials and the carbon materials retain the similar particle size and shape as the zeolite template. This is consistent with the templating mechanism whereby the carbon is dominative nanocast in the pore channels of the zeolite EMC-2 template. The sample CEM600, however, shows both disc-like and spheric-like particles, which may be due to the incomplete infiltration of zeolite pore channel and the formation of polymers that are not fully carbonized in this sample. Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of samples CEM700 and CEM700HT are presented in Fig. 5 . The pore channels can be observed for both samples with an estimated pore diameter of ca. 0.7–0.9 nm. The SAED patterns (inset in Fig. 5) for both samples confirm the amorphous nature of carbon materials, which is in agreement with the XRD patterns in Fig. 1. The hydrogen uptake capacities of the resulting carbon materials were measured by gravimetric method on an IGA at −196 °C over the pressure range 0–20 bar, as shown in Fig. 6 . Hydrogen adsorption in porous carbon is a physical sorption process and kinetic equilibrium can be achieved rapidly. Except sample CEM600, the hydrogen sorption isotherms for all the other samples in Fig. 6 show no hysteresis and all desorption isotherms closely matched their corresponding adsorption isotherms, implying that hydrogen uptake on these carbon materials were totally reversible. Sample CEM600, which is dominated by high molecular weight of polymer that are not fully carbonized, display a hysteresis between hydrogen adsorption and desorption branches, which may be due to the tortuosity and pore size distribution of the micropores in the polymer network, as previous reported for microporous hypercrosslinked polymer [47]. The hydrogen uptake capacities of the carbon materials, at 1 and 20 bar, are given in Table 1. It is obvious that the hydrogen uptake capacities varied in the range of 0.55–4.43 wt% and 0.11–1.37 wt% at pressure of 20 bar and 1 bar respectively, among which the heat treated sample CEM700HT can adsorb 4.43 wt% H2 at 20 bar (1.37 wt% at 1 bar), while sample CEM700 can only uptake 2.27 wt% hydrogen at 20 bar (0.87 wt% at 1 bar). Clearly, the trend in hydrogen uptake capacities is closely related to the textural properties of the carbon materials and in particular the surface area, suggesting the importance of heat treatment which improves the textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities remarkably. To determine the interaction between the adsorbed hydrogen molecules and the surface of the carbons, the isosteric heat of adsorption Q st was calculated using hydrogen sorption isotherms measured at −196 and −186 °C. The calculation of the isosteric heat of adsorption was based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and the two representative plots of the isosteric heat of adsorption Q st as a function of hydrogen uptake is shown in Fig. 7 . Q st varies from 8.5 to 9.0 kJ/mol at low hydrogen uptake to 3–4 kJ/mol at high hydrogen uptake. As expected the heat of adsorption decreases at higher hydrogen uptake. It is noteworthy that the initial isosteric heat of adsorption for both CEM700 and CEM700HT is around 8.5–9 kJ/mol, which is comparable with previous reported value [21], implying that both samples have strong interaction between adsorbed hydrogen and the carbon surface and the interaction is very close due to the similarity of carbon framework for both samples."
7,Effect of heat treatment on microporous carbons templated from other zeolites,"3.2 Effect of heat treatment on microporous carbons templated from other zeolites It is clearly that heat treatment of carbon/zeolite composites obtained from CVD method can significantly improve the structural order, textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities for the resulting microporous carbon materials. To maximize the benefit of an heat treatment for the carbon materials, the heat treatment conditions were optimized using zeolite EMC-2 as a model template and ethylene as a carbon precursor at CVD temperature of 700 °C. Combined with XRD patterns and the nitrogen sorption isotherms for heat treated samples at different temperatures (as shown in Fig. S1 and the textural properties summarized in Table S1 in ESI), it's clear that 900 °C may be the optimal heat treatment temperature. Further exploring the effect of heat treatment duration on the resulting carbon materials (as see in Fig. S2 and Table S1 in ESI), suggests that heat treatment for 3 h at 900 °C can produce material with high surface area and pore volume. Longer heat treatment time shows no benefits to resulting carbon sample due to the formation of graphitized carbon species. The synthesis of structure ordered microporous carbon materials via optimal heat treatment conditions was extended to the use of different zeolites (including EMC-2, X, Y and β) as solid templates, various carbon precursors such as ethylene, acetonitrile and and furfuryl alcohol, and diverse synthesis strategies including CVD method, impregnation method combined with CVD method. The structural order of the various zeolite templates were confirmed by their XRD patterns in Fig. S3 in ESI. As shown in Fig. 8 , while carbon material was generated by using zeolite EMC-2 as solid template and acetonitrile as carbon precursor at CVD temperature of 800 °C (sample CEMAN800), the XRD patterns for the resulting carbon material display the (100) peak of zeolite at 2θ of 6.1, and a shoulder peak at 2θ of 6.8 maybe due to (101) peak which is very weak. If carbon precursors furfuryl alcohol and ethylene were introduced into zeolite EMC-2 by impregnation method combined with CVD method, the obtained carbon material (CEMFAET) only shows the (100) diffraction peak from the zeolite template in its XRD result. Heat treatment of these two carbon/EMC-2 composites generated carbons with two well-defined XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ of 6.1 and 6.8°, assigned to (100) and (101) from zeolite replication, which is consistent with a high level of zeolite-type structural order [18]. At CVD temperature of 800 °C and acetonitrile as carbon precursor, the carbon material derived from zeolite β (sample CBTAN800) only shows the (100) diffraction peak from zeolite template at 2θ of 7°; a heat treatment (sample CBTAN800HT) results in the formation of another diffraction peak at 2θ of 15°, indicating the improvement of structural order of the resulting carbon material. This observation agrees well with previous report [21]. When zeolite X and Y were used as hard template and ethylene as carbon precursor at CVD temperature of 700 °C, the resulting carbon materials, regardless of further heat treatment or not, exclusively displayed a peak at ca. 2θ of 6°, implying that those carbons possess some level of structural ordering, similar to those of the zeolite X and Y templates [12,18–20,22,24,25]. However, the peak intensities are higher for carbons generated from the heat treatment process. The nitrogen sorption isotherms of various carbon materials are presented in Fig. 9 and the corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 2 . The isotherms of all the carbon materials exhibit some adsorption below P/P o of 0.02, which can be ascribed to micropore filling and they also exhibit nitrogen uptake at P/P o of 0.02–0.2, which suggests the presence of super-micropores and/or small mesopores in the carbon materials. Except that sample CBTAN800 and its heat treated counterpart CBTAN800HT exhibit hysteresis loops between the adsorption and desorption isotherms at P/P o > 0.2 which may be derived from adsorption into mesopores arising from interparticle voids, all the other carbon materials display almost no hysteresis loops. As shown in Table 2, compared with their untreated counterparts, the total surface area of heat treated samples, derived from ethylene as carbon precursor, increased by 50%, 112% and 64% for sample CEMFAETHT, CXET700HT and CYET700HT respectively, whilst their microporous surface area was increased by 82%, 125% and 170%, respectively. However, the heat treated samples derived from acetonitrile as carbon precursor (sample CEMAN800HT and CBTAN800HT) only show 8–12% increase of total surface area and 30% increase of microporous surface area, implying carbon precursor has an obvious effect on the level of improvement of textural properties for the resulting carbon materials. It is worth noting that microporous surface area and pore volume for all the heat treated samples exclusively increase compared with their untreated counterparts, and the increase level depends on the zeolite templates, carbon precursors and synthesis methods. Among all the obtained carbon materials, CEMAN800HT sample possesses the highest ratio of microporous surface area of 83% and 70% microporous pore volume, which may contribute to a higher hydrogen uptake. The hydrogen uptake capacities of various carbon materials were measured at −196 °C over the pressure range of 0–20 bar and the results were presented in Fig. 10 . The hydrogen sorption isotherms for all the porous carbon samples are exclusively reversible with no hysteresis loops between adsorption and desorption branches, consistent with the nature of physical sorption for hydrogen uptake on these materials. The hydrogen uptake capacities for all the carbon materials increase with increasing pressure up to 20 bar, but it is clear that the saturation is not attained at 20 bar, and therefore higher uptake capacities are possible at pressure above 20 bar. The hydrogen uptake capacities, at 1 and 20 bar, are given in Table 2. Similar to the change trend in surface area, the hydrogen uptake capacity for heat treated samples was increased by 61%, 85% and 116% for sample CEMFAETHT, CXET700HT and CYET700HT respectively, compared with their untreated counterpart. However, the carbon materials derived from acetonitrile via a heat treatment show limited increase of hydrogen uptake capacity. It is clear that the observed trend in hydrogen uptake capacity is related to the textural properties (especially the surface area) of the resulting carbon materials, implying the importance of heat treatment which affects the textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities significantly. It is also obvious that the hydrogen uptake capacities varied in the range of 2.21–5.85 wt% and 0.81–2.16 wt% at pressure of 20 bar and 1 bar respectively, among which the heat treated sample CBTAN800HT exhibited the highest hydrogen uptake which adsorbed 5.85 wt% hydrogen at 20 bar (2.16 wt% at 1 bar). It is interesting to mention that although sample CEMAN800HT has the highest total and microporous surface area, the hydrogen uptake capacity for this sample is lower than that for sample CBTAN800HT. This observation implies that although surface area is important for hydrogen uptake, other textural properties, such as pore size, may also play important roles in the hydrogen uptake capacities. In fact, sample CBTAN800HT exhibits narrow pore size distribution centred at 10.2 Å while sample CEMAN800HT shows wider pore size distribution in the range of 10–15 Å together with an additional pore size above 20 Å."
8,"Effect of heat treatment on structures, porosities and hydrogen uptake capacities of mesoporous carbons templated from mesoporous silicas","3.3 Effect of heat treatment on structures, porosities and hydrogen uptake capacities of mesoporous carbons templated from mesoporous silicas The optimal heat treatment conditions were further extended to the use of mesoporous silicas SBA-15, MCM-48 and HMS as solid templates to generate mesoporous carbons. The mesostructural orderings of various silicas were confirmed by the XRD patterns in Fig. S4 in ESI, which was agreed well with literature [38–42], implying the existence of long-range structural order for all the mesoporous silica templates. The carbon materials, prepared by using various mesoporous silica as templates at CVD temperature of 750–800 °C and ethylene as carbon precursor, have been characterized by powder XRD, nitrogen sorption and hydrogen uptake measurement at −196 °C. The XRD patterns of the resultants are shown in Fig. 11 . In all cases, regardless of heat treatment was used or not, the resulting carbon materials exclusively displayed diffraction peaks at 2θ < 3°, implying that all the carbons templated from mesoporous silicas possess mesostructural orderings. The mesostructural ordering of the carbon materials, however, depends on the nature of the silica template. The XRD patterns for samples CMK3ET and CMK3ETHT templated from mesoporous SBA-15, exhibited peaks in the low-angle region, indicating that these samples were mesostructured with a hexagonal pore arrangement replicated from the SBA-15 silica [43,48–50]. The low-angle peaks in the XRD pattern for samples CMK3ET and CMK3ETHT are typical for well-ordered CMK-3 type mesoporous carbons [48]. The low-angle XRD patterns for sample CMK1ET and CMK1ETHT templated from mesoporous MCM-48 displayed two peaks at 2θ of 2.1° and 3.0°, which is in consistent with a mesostructured CMK-1 type material [14]. On the other hand, the XRD patterns for samples CHMSET and CHMSETHT derived from mesoporous HMS showed a relatively broad diffraction peak in the low-angle region, implying that these samples possess a limited mesostructural order, which is also in agreement with previous report [51]. It is worth noting that the XRD patterns at low angle range for all the mesoporous carbon samples obtained via a heat treatment are quite similar to those obtained without heat treatment, indicating heat treatment may not improve the structural order of resulting mesoporous carbon materials. This is maybe due to the fact that the pore diameter for mesoporous silica templates is relatively large, which is big enough to accommodate the carbon precursor molecules diffusing through the whole pore network system of mesoporous silicas during the CVD process. However, the XRD patterns for the heat treated samples display increased diffraction peak at 2θ of 26°, suggesting the formation of graphitic carbon species, which may result in the reduction of the textural properties for resulting mesoporous carbon materials. This assumption is confirmed by measuring the textural properties via nitrogen sorption, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The surface area and pore volume for all the mesoporous carbons predominantly contribute from mesopores. It is clear that the surface area and pore volume for samples obtained via a heat treatment are a little bit lower than those for untreated samples, possibly due to the high temperature treatment resulting in the formation of graphitic species in the mesoporous carbons, as demonstrated by XRD patterns. The hydrogen uptake capacities for all the mesoporous carbon materials were measured at −196 °C up to 20 bar (see Fig. 12 ). As expected, all the hydrogen isotherms are reversible and closely related to their textural properties. In all case, the hydrogen uptake capacities are lower than 1 wt% at 20 bar (as seen in Table 2). The heat treated samples exhibit even lower hydrogen uptake capacities than their untreated counterparts, in good agreement with their textural properties listed in Table 2. These observations show that although heat treatment strategy is a simple and general approach to prepare microporous carbons from zeolite templates with increased structural order, textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities, the synthesis of mesoporous carbon materials from mesoporous silicas may not benefitted from this strategy."
9,Conclusions,"The effect of heat treatment on the structural order, textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities of porous carbon materials templated from various zeolites and mesoporous silicas has been studied. It is found that a significant improvement of the structural order of the replicated microporous carbons, an increase in both total and microporous surface area and pore volume, and an improvement of the hydrogen uptake capacity can be realised by a simple heat treatment method during the material synthesis process. Using zeolite EMC-2 as a model hard template and ethylene as a representative carbon precursor, it has been found that heat treatment at 900 °C in inert atmosphere for 3 h was the optimal conditions. In general, structurally well-ordered microporous carbon materials can be replicated from different zeolite templates, carbon precursors and through various synthesis routes by heat treatment method. Therefore, the heat treatment is a simple and general approach to synthesize well-ordered microporous carbon materials with high surface area and pore volume and increased microporosity, which results in the improvement of hydrogen storage capacity up to 5.85 wt% at 20 bar and −196 °C. However, such a heat treatment has no effect on the mesoporous carbon materials templated from mesoporous silicas."
