0,Introduction,"The negative consequences of the use of fossil fuels and fossil-based products have long been well known and proven, and that, in addition to the limited reserves of such energy sources, has led to the intensification of the use and research in the field of renewable energy sources. Due to the negative impacts and unsustainability of the fossil-based economy, attention is drawn to the bio-based economy which promotes the use of renewable raw materials in production of energy, biomaterials, biochemicals and various other products [1,2]. Since the production of numerous chemicals and synthetic polymers has been based on fossil fuels for decades, it is of the utmost importance to find adequate renewable sources that will substitute harmful fossil fuels. Biomass appeared as an up-and-coming alternative, a carbon neutral source that can address the mentioned problem. However, the economic conversion of biomass into added-value chemicals with high yield and good selectivity is still a great issue [3,4]. Lignocellulose is not equivalent to conventional energy sources because of its high oxygen content that can be reduced by various defunctionalisation processes, such as hydrogenation, dehydration, decarboxylation or hydrogenolysis. Hydrodeoxygenation process is an influential step in reaction pathway from biomass to added-value chemicals, where oxygen is removed from an oxygenated compound, at high temperature, under hydrogen pressure, in the presence of heterogeneous catalyst. Due to many competitive reactions that can overlap, finding the optimal pressure and temperature that would favour desired reaction is a challenge [5–7]. The mentioned processes require accurate kinetic models that take into account the solubility of various gases in the bio-based chemicals present in the process. Numerous studies on the hydrotreatment of biomass components have been performed using different catalysts and under the various conditions of pressure and temperature [8–14]. As expected, the reaction pathway and yield depend strongly on used catalyst, and, besides that, the partial pressure of hydrogen has a great influence on reaction. It was shown that high H2 pressure can increase reaction rate to some extent but can, also, be a limiting factor due to the hydrogen coverage, i.e. occupying active sites on the catalyst [11–14]. Therefore, the knowledge of gas–liquid equilibrium of hydrogen in the various chemicals that can be produced from lignocellulose is of great importance for biomass valorisation. In addition to the particular application that was of interest in this research, there are various other industrial processes that occur at high pressures and require knowledge on phase behaviour under those conditions. Some of them are chemical, petrochemical and separation processes, where the design of reactors and distillation columns, selection of an appropriate solvent, and products collection and storage, are strongly influenced by the phase-equilibrium. The mentioned data are also of the highest importance for the application of ionic liquids or supercritical fluids [15]. Supercritical fluids, such as CO2 studied here, have gained a great attention during the last few decades, as substitutes for conventional solvents and, clearly, their use creates a need for the data on their properties under extreme conditions. Besides the confirmed supremacy in the field of extraction, the supercritical fluids have shown a great potential for a wide range of application, e.g. material processing, food processing, particle formation, impregnation, polymer processes, metal degreasing, cleaning, drug coating, etc [15,16]. As mentioned above, the process design and optimization are based on the process simulations that involve thermodynamic and transport properties of the process compounds. Therefore, the significance of the accurate models for the prediction of those properties has been long recognized, and valuable results have been achieved in their development. However, the prediction of the phase behaviour without the specific parameters determined for the systems of interest, does not give reliable results in most of the cases. That is especially evident at conditions of high pressure, where the deviation from ideal behaviour is more noticeable. Therefore, despite the complexity and time consumption, there is still a great need for the experimental determination of phase-equilibrium data. The solubility of gases in the chemicals produced from lignocellulose at high temperatures and pressures has not been studied enough and those data are particularly sparse for hydrogen [17,18]. The reasons for that could be the instability of some bio-based chemicals, their price or the complexity and long-lasting solubility determination experiments. The hydrogen solubility was studied in alcohols at several temperatures and pressures [19–21] which showed that the longer the carbon chain is the greater the amount of hydrogen will be absorbed, and H2 dissolves better in monoalcohols than in diols. The ability of alkanes and other solvents to absorb hydrogen was also examined [21–26]; the solubility of H2 is higher in alkanes than in straight-chain alcohols with the same number of C atoms, and among alkanes it decreases as molar mass of alkanes rises. Further, the hydrogen solubility was measured for several deep eutectic solvents and heavy oils [27,28], and all the above mentioned systems have in common that the increase of temperature or pressure leads to better dissolution of hydrogen. On the other hand, some of systems consisting of H2 and ionic liquids [29,30] exhibit different phase-equilibrium behaviour, the solubility of H2 goes down with increase in temperature. Furfural is the promising platform compound that can be obtained from lignocellulosic waste and further converted to valuable chemicals through hydrotreatment reactions [11–14,31,32]. One of the significant compounds that are products of the mentioned reactions is furfuryl alcohol and it also can serve as a source for the further production of added value chemicals. As for furfural, the solubility of CO2 was measured at wide ranges of temperature and pressure [33–35], while the solubility of H2 in furfural was studied in two papers at pressures up to 12.5 MPa [18,35]. CO2 dissolves much better in furfural than H2, and while the hydrogen solubility in furfural increases with the temperature rise, the solubility of CO2 drops. On the other hand, no literature data on the solubility of hydrogen in furfuryl alcohol were found. The hydrogen solubility in furfural and furfuryl alcohol was measured at three temperatures (323.15–423.15) K and pressures up to 25 MPa. Prior to that, the solubility of CO2 in furfural was measured at two temperatures 303.15 K and 323.15 K and at pressures up to 7 MPa in order to evaluate the measuring procedure. The obtained data were modelled using the cubic equations of state Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson, as well as the PC-SAFT equation of state. The PC-SAFT parameters for pure compounds were determined for furfural and furfuryl alcohol."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Furfural was purchased from Sigma Aldrich with purity of 99 wt% and furfuryl alcohol of 98 wt% purity was supplied by Aldrich chemicals (Table 1 ). Furfural is very photosensitive and its colour easily changes from clear to brownish so it needed to be distilled under vacuum prior to the use. Both liquid components, furfural and furfuryl alcohol, were degassed under vacuum before the experiments. CO2 and H2 were supplied by Merck, > 99.999 wt% (Table 1)."
3,Apparatus,"2.2 Apparatus The apparatus for the phase-equilibrium measurements is presented in a previous paper [36], therefore, only a brief description will be given here. The main part of the apparatus is a view cell (I in Fig. 1 ), a cylinder made of Hastelloy C4 alloy and closed by sapphire glasses at both sides or with a sapphire glass at one and membrane bellows at the other side. The latter option enables changing the cell’s volume and is used for synthetic method measurements, while measurements by applying the analytical method can be also performed in the view cell with constant volume i.e. with the two sapphire windows. The view cell is insulated with a double jacket, and the inside temperature is controlled by Julabo Presto LH46 thermostat that provides stable temperatures in the range (223.15–523.15) K. The temperature is measured using a platinum resistance thermometer Pt-100 by SITEC that was calibrated by an accredited metrology laboratory LMK according to the international temperature standard ITS90, at the temperatures between (273.15–448.15) K and an expanded uncertainty in temperature was estimated to 0.1 K (coverage factor k = 2, confidence level 95 %). The liquid samples are inserted in the cell using a screw pump SITEC (V in Fig. 1) and a system of stainless steel tubes. The vacuum pump Vacuumbrand RC6 is used to evacuate the apparatus and the obtained vacuum is measured by a Pirani vacuum gauge VAP 5 with a relative standard uncertainty of ± 10 %. The pressure in the view cell is measured by means of a pressure transducer Omegadyne PX1004L1-5KAV that enables the measurements of pressure in the interval (0–34.5) MPa. The pressure transducer was calibrated by an accredited metrology laboratory LMT at the pressures between (0.1–30) MPa. Relative expanded uncertainties of 1 % at pressures close to 0.1 MPa and 0.08 % at pressures above 2 MPa were estimated (95 % level of confidence, k = 2). Besides that, very low pressure of gas in the collecting system (II and III in Fig. 1) is measured with a calibrated, highly accurate, Keller LEX-1 digital manometer (IV in Fig. 1) with the narrow measurement range (0–0.2 MPa) and a relative standard uncertainty of ± 0.01 %. The rupture disc, built into the apparatus, limits the pressure that can be used in the apparatus to 30 MPa. The sample mixing in the cell is achieved by means of a magnetic stirrer in the view cell, driven by four stationary electromagnets positioned equidistantly around the cell. The LabVIEW 2010 software allows the control of stirring rate. The room temperature, i.e. temperature of the gas collecting system is measured using a digital platinum resistance thermometer (Hart Scientific, model 1506) that can measure temperatures in the wide range (93.15–923.15) K. It was calibrated at temperatures (243.15–573.15) K and an expanded uncertainty of the measurement was estimated to 0.05 K (k = 2, confidence level 95 %). The masses of the cold traps, before and after sampling, are determined using a digital balance Tehtnica Exacta 3600 EB with a standard uncertainty of ± 0.01 g. The temperature and the pressure in the view cell are collected by a data acquisition system and recorded by LabVIEW 2010 service Pack 1 that automatically saves data and enables further processing. Contrary to that, the notations of temperature and pressure in collecting system, as well as cold traps masses, are done manually."
4,Measurement procedure,"2.3 Measurement procedure The apparatus given in Fig. 1 enables phase-equilibrium measurements at wide ranges of pressure and temperature. In addition to obtaining the valuable data on vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE), such as solubility, bubble point, dew point, and critical point, the more complex liquid–liquid and solid–liquid equilibrium can also be studied at the presented apparatus [37,38]. The VLE measurements can be performed by applying synthetic, both visual and non-visual (pV), or analytical method [36]. The synthetic method is based on the detection of bubble appearance in the liquid mixture of the predefined composition [15,36,37], appearance of a first liquid drop in the vapour mixture, or without the phase transition. Opposite to the synthetic method, where the goal is to define the equilibrium conditions, the pressure and the temperature, for the mixture of known composition, the analytical method is based on the determination of mixture’s composition after the equilibrium was reached at set pressure and/or temperature. The application of the measurement method depends strongly on the properties of studied compounds and desired results. The synthetic method is more time-consuming and can be insufficiently accurate in the case of poor gas solubility in the liquid component, but it is an optimal choice for determining the phase behaviour, when the coexisting phases have similar densities. Opposite to that, the analytical method is fast, which makes it suitable for studying thermolabile chemicals, but, it is not an appropriate method for the examination of the compounds with high vapour pressure. While the main issue with the application of the synthetic method is the precise preparation of the mixture, for the analytical method it is the determination of the composition of the equilibrated phases. The solubility of hydrogen in low volatile liquids was studied here and, therefore, the isothermal analytical method was chosen. Both, the composition of the liquid and of the gas phase can be defined but, since we were interested in the solubility of gases in liquid components, only the liquid phase was analysed and its composition was determined. Sampling from mixtures at high pressure was discussed in detail by Peper et al. [38] taking all sampling steps into consideration, the position of sampling, the manner of taking samples, depressurization and further sample preparation, when needed. The sampling effect on the equilibrium state in the cell was investigated on a case study, giving an outline how to reduce disturbance of the equilibrium state by minimizing the pressure drop and associated temperature change. Withdrawing small samples by using capillaries from the cell with large volume can considerably reduce sampling errors, and, on the other side, all sampling steps have to be considered with great care to avoid an impact on the results’ accuracy. The samples should be taken only from a homogeneous phase in an equilibrium, the sampling lines have to be clean and without any residues from previous sampling, without traces of any corrosion products or ongoing polymerization etc. Prior to the measurements, the volume of the collecting system (II and III in Fig. 1), i.e. the cold traps, the gas collector and the connecting tubes, should be known. The volumes of the cold traps for liquid component and the gas collector were determined by weighing water that could fit within them. For this purpose Mettler AT 261 analytical balance with an accuracy of ± 0.01 mg was used. Based on the water density at experimental conditions the volumes of the cold traps and the gas collector were calculated with a relative standard uncertainty better than 0.01 % [36]. The lengths and the inner diameters of the tubes used to connect the view cell, the cold traps, the gas collector and the pressure transducer, were measured and their volumes were calculated. This way the volume of the whole collecting system was determined. The next step was to ensure that the apparatus is clean and ready for the experimentation. After every round of measurements, the view cell was opened and the residues of the liquid sample from the previous experiment were blown out from the view cell and all the tubes that were in touch with the sample by nitrogen. Further, the view cell, the screw pump for liquid component (V in Fig. 1) and the tubes, were washed thoroughly with acetone and, after closing the view cell, dried by means of vacuum. The cleaning procedure had been repeated several times until the reference vacuum of 3 Pa was achieved within the apparatus. The Pirani vacuum gauge VAP 5 was used to measure the vacuum at the entrance of the vacuum pump hose (VI in Fig. 1) to cold trap, filled with dry ice, and placed there to prevent the liquids from entering the pump. Besides the hygiene, the high vacuum in the apparatus indicates that the view cell was closed properly and the manifold is well connected. Once the apparatus was cleaned and evacuated, the view cell was filled with a gas component up to certain pressure. In order to check the tightness of the view cell, the gas component was left inside for a few hours and the pressure stability was monitored. At this point, the desired temperature was set on the Julabo Presto LH46 thermostat and soon it was reached in the cell. If the pressure in the cell constantly decreased, the gas would be released, the cell would be opened, and seals checked, and changed if needed. In the case there was no gas leakage, i.e. no significant pressure drop in the view cell, a liquid component could be injected in the view cell. That was done by means of the manual screw pump. The liquid component was degassed under vacuum prior to the phase-equilibrium measurements and the vessel, where it was stored, was linked with the apparatus, more precisely to the screw pump (V in Fig. 1). The manual screw pump, as well as all the tubes that connect it to the liquid component container and the view cell, was evacuated, to ensure the absence of the other compounds besides the desired sample in the system. The pump was filled with the liquid component by turning its handles counter-clockwise, up to maximum volume of 15 ml and after that, the valve on the line to the liquid container was closed. The liquid component was inserted into the view cell by turning the pump handles clockwise and opening the valve at the entrance of the view cell. Due to the small volume of the screw pump, the filling procedure had to be repeated a couple of times, until the amount of liquid phase or the pressure in the cell was as desired. When all the components of the studied system were in the view cell, vigorous stirring was initiated by switching on the electromagnets around the cell that drive the magnetic stirrer inside the view cell. After all this, the system in the cell was left to equilibrate at the temperature of interest–isothermal analytical method for phase-equilibrium measurements was applied. Depending on the studied system, it took several hours for the pressure to stabilize, and during that time the part of the apparatus for collecting the liquid phase (II–IV in Fig. 1) was prepared for sampling. The cold traps used for retention of the liquid component (II in Fig. 1) were weighed and placed in the Dewar flasks, filled with a cooling medium. The cooling medium was chosen based on the melting temperature of the liquid component and the mixture of ice and NaCl was used in the presented research. The collecting part of the apparatus and the tube between the view cell and the cold traps for the liquid component, were evacuated prior to the sampling. Once the conditions in the view cell were stable for some time, i.e. phase-equilibrium was reached, a small amount of liquid sample was taken out from the cell. The collecting system was isolated from the vacuum pump and the pressure within this part of the apparatus was measured by the digital manometer (IV in Fig. 1). When the liquid sample entered the collecting system, a liquid component was caught in cold traps at very low temperature while the gas component filled the rest of the tubes and the gas collector (III in Fig. 1). Temperatures in the cold traps, as well as temperature of the whole collecting system, were measured using the platinum thermometer. The pressure in the collecting part was measured again and the difference between the pressure in the evacuated and the collecting system filled with the gas from the sample was noted. After recording the pressure of the gas that was dissolved in the liquid component in the analysed sample, the gas was released from the collecting system. The vacuum pump was used to drain off the liquid component residues from the tube connecting the view cell and the cold traps. It was assumed that after half an hour of evacuation, all the liquid component of the sample was collected in the cold traps and their masses were measured. When all the relevant data were recorded, the collecting part of the apparatus was prepared for another sampling. The cold traps for liquid component were washed with acetone, dried and weighed again in order to check the cleanliness. After the evacuation, the collecting system was ready for the next sample. Since the small amount of the mixture in the view cell was taken out, the pressure in the cell did not change significantly, so the new phase-equilibrium should be reached easily. If a lower pressure was wanted, one of the ways to reach it was to release certain amount of a gas phase from the view cell, and then, one should wait for several hours before the subsequent sampling. The sample analysis gave the mass of the liquid component and the pressure of the gas component in the collecting system. The temperature of the gas component in collecting system was measured and it, together with the pressure, enables the calculation of its molar volume. Different equations of state can be used for this purpose, and here, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state [39] was applied. The temperatures and pressures in the cold traps were measured, and the density of the liquid component under those conditions was determined based on the literature data [40]. Knowing the mass of the collected liquid, it was easy to calculate the volume of the cold trap, occupied by the liquid component. The rest of the cold trap volume was filled with the gas component, and this was also considered when calculating the amount of the gas in the system. Since the volume of the part of collecting system filled with the gas component (free volume of cold traps, gas collector and tubing) was determined, it was possible to calculate the amount of the gas component in studied sample. The amount of the liquid component could easily be calculated using the measured mass of the liquid component in the sample and its molar mass. This way, the molar portion of the gas component in the mixture, that was in the phase-equilibrium at the certain pressure and temperature, was obtained."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Experimental results,"3.1 Experimental results The solubility of hydrogen in furfural and furfuryl alcohol was measured at three temperatures in the range of (323.15–423.15) K at pressures up to 25 MPa. The phase-equilibrium for the system CO2 + furfural was measured at temperatures of 303.15 K and 323.15 K at pressures up to 7 MPa, in order to check the measurement procedure. As explained in the previous section, a molar fraction of the gas in a mixture, x, is calculated based on the measured mass of the liquid component and a pressure of the gas component in a known volume: (1) x ( G ) = V ( G ) V m ( G ) V ( G ) V m ( G ) + m ( L ) M ( L ) where G and L refer to the gas and liquid component, respectively. V is a volume occupied by the gas component and Vm is a molar volume, m stands for a mass and M denotes a molar mass. Molar volume of the gas component collected during the sampling was determined by using the Soave-Redlich-Kwong cubic equation of state [39] based on the measured temperature and pressure in the collecting part of the apparatus. The standard uncertainty in the calculated mixture composition, u(x(G)), was estimated according to error propagation law [41]: (2) u ( x ( G ) ) = - V ( G ) Vm ( G ) 2 · m ( L ) M ( L ) V ( G ) Vm ( G ) + m ( L ) M ( L ) 2 2 · u 2 ( V m ( G ) ) + - V ( G ) Vm ( G ) · 1 M ( L ) V ( G ) Vm ( G ) + m ( L ) M ( L ) 2 2 · u 2 ( m ( L ) ) 1 / 2 where u(Vm(G)) denotes a standard uncertainty of molar volume determination and u(m(L)) is a standard uncertainty of mass measurement. For the measurements of the CO2 solubility in furfural, maximum of the estimated standard uncertainties in molar fraction was ± 1·10–3, while for the H2 solubility in both furfural and furfuryl alcohol the estimated standard uncertainties were lower than ± 2·10–4. The solubility of CO2 in furfural (Table 2 ) rises when the pressure increases and it decreases with the increase in temperature, as expected [34,35]. The obtained data were compared to those from the literature [34,35] and a very good agreement was noted, average absolute deviation, AAD, in pressure at 323.15 K was AAD ≈ 4 % (0.16 MPa) (Fig. 2 ). Further, the data measured previously [35] at the apparatus used here, while applying the synthetic method, are included in Fig. 2, and apparently show the same trend as presented data obtained by applying the analytical measurement method (Fig. 2). Since there are no solubility data for the studied system measured under the same conditions by using both, analytical and synthetic, methods [35] the comparison could not be quantified. The comparison with literature data [34,35] proved the correctness of the measurement procedure and reliability of the presented data. The measurements were performed isothermally, while the pressure was changing due to the dissolution of the gas in a liquid, or intentionally, according to the experimental plan. The repeatability of the measurements could not be accurately determined because it was difficult to achieve the same pressure for different samplings. Still, it was done in the cases when the relative pressure deviation was less than 1.5 %. The repeatability of the performed measurements was good, at 303.15 K the standard deviation of the measured compositions was 0.028, while at 323.15 K and pressures of about 3 MPa, 3.8 MPa and 5.9 MPa the standard deviations were 0.004, 0.003 and 0.002, respectively (Table 2). The phase-equilibrium for the binary system H2 + furfural was determined at 323.15 K, 399.15 K and 423.15 K and for H2 + furfuryl alcohol at 323.15 K, 373.15 K and 423.15 K, both at pressures up to 25 MPa (Tables 3 and 4 ). Since the experiments were conducted at relatively high temperatures and pressures, furfural and furfuryl alcohol collected in the cold traps after the hydrogen solubility measurements, were analysed by a gas chromatography, in order to check their purity. In the case of furfural, no change in composition was detected, while the analysis of furfuryl alcohol after the measurement at 423.15 K showed presence of dimers and trimers in the sample. Still, molar fraction of furfuryl alcohol in the sample was higher than 94 % so impurities were not considered in the hydrogen solubility determination. The aging of the H2 + furfuryl alcohol sample was observed after the experiment at 423.15 K, its colour changed to brown and the sample became denser, until it turned into resin after couple of days. The major deviation of the experimental solubility data from the previously published results [35] measured at the same apparatus by applying different method, indicates that the synthetic measurement method was not the right choice for H2 + furfural system. In general, it is difficult to visually detect the first bubble in the view cell, but it is especially hard in the case of H2. Further, the problem is that the solubility of H2 is very low, so if the first bubble is missed the pressure will significantly drop by the moment the next bubble of H2 is formed and noticed. That leads to a notable inaccuracy in the experimental determination of hydrogen solubility by using synthetic visual measurement method. Even synthetic non-visual (pV) method, that was partially used [35], did not give satisfactory results. The could bebecause it is generally, time consuming approach and, additionally, H2 separates very slowly from furfural, creating a possibility for a wrong conclusion. On the other hand, the bubbles of CO2 are easily notable and the solubility of CO2 in furfural is much higher than that of H2, so the synthetic measurement method proved suitable for that system [35]. For comparison purposes with the literature data [18], the solubility measurements for H2 + furfural were performed at 399.15 K. The discrepancy between the solubility data measured at 323.15 K and the only value published by Jaatinen et al.[18], was observed (Fig. 3 ). On the other hand, very good agreement between the experimental and their data [18] is noted at 399.1 K, average absolute pressure deviation was about 4 % (0.3 MPa) (Fig. 3). Since there is only one value in the literature [18] measured at 323.1 K and the hydrogen solubility is notably low at those conditions, while there are three data points measured at 399.2 K that agree well with the values given here, the presented experimental results are considered reliable. The dissolution of hydrogen in both, furfural and furfuryl alcohol, rises with the increase in either temperature or pressure (Fig. 4 ). Obviously, the temperature influences H2 and CO2 solubility in opposite way. That is in accordance with general rule that in the case of poor solubility, as for H2, it increases when the temperature increases, and if the gas is highly soluble in a liquid, the case of CO2, the temperature rise will have negative effect on its absorption [42]. Under all studied temperatures, it was found that the H2 is more soluble in furfural than in furfuryl alcohol for about 15 % (Fig. 4). That behaviour was expected. Nonpolar H2 should dissolve better in a less polar furfural (spectroscopic polarity index, ET N = 0.426 [43]) than in furfuryl alcohol (ET N = 0.605 [43]). Solubilisation is two-stage process: first solvent–solvent interactions need to be broken to enable separation of solvent molecules, which is an endothermic process, and the next step is filling the formed cavities by solute molecules [44]. Since alcohol can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds [45], it hinders the first step of solubilisation, more energy is required to break intermolecular bonds, and that could be a reason for the lower hydrogen solubility in furfuryl alcohol than in furfural. Similar solubility ratio was noticed for CO2, as it absorbs better in furfural than in furfuryl alcohol [34,46]."
7,Calculations,"3.2 Calculations 3.2.1 Cubic equations of state – CEoS The presented equilibrium data were modelled using the different equations of state (EoS): cubic Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Peng-Robinson (PR) and perturbed chain statistic associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT). The Soave-Redlich-Kwong (Eq.(3)) [39] and the Peng-Robinson equations of state (Eq.(4)) [47] are commonly used for modelling the phase-equilibrium data: (3) p = R T υ - b - a υ ( υ + b ) (4) p = R T υ - b - a υ ( υ + b ) + b ( υ - b ) where p and T are pressure and temperature, respectively, υ stands for a molar volume, R is a universal gas constant, while a and b denote parameters of EoSs. The calculations of the parameters of the cubic equations of state (SRK and PR) require the knowledge of critical parameters (temperature and pressure), and an acentric factor for all used compounds, which were taken from the literature [17,32,34,48] (Table 5 ). In the case of mixtures, it is necessary to apply a mixing rule to calculate parameters a and b from Eqs. (3) and (4), and here, classical mixing rules were used: (5) a = ∑ i ∑ j x i x j a ij = ∑ i ∑ j x i x j a i a j ( 1 - k ij ) ; k ii = 0 ; k ij = k ji (6) b = ∑ i x i b i where a i and b i are the parameters of EoS calculated for a pure substance i using critical properties, and x i is a molar fraction of the component i in a mixture, while k ij represents a binary interaction parameter for components i and j. The calculations were first done neglecting the interaction parameter (k ij = 0), but, the agreements between experimentally determined equilibrium pressures and those calculated using EoSs were not satisfactory (Table 6 ). Therefore, the interaction parameter was determined for both systems and an objective function for optimization was the absolute average percentage deviation: (7) OF = | p exp - p cal | p exp · 100 All calculations were done in Matlab software and the interaction parameters were optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The prediction of the CO2 solubility in furfural using the SRK and PR EoSs, without including the interaction parameter, did not give acceptable results. The absolute average percentage deviation between the calculated and the experimentally determined data was about 20 % (0.8 MPa), when SRK equation was used. The disagreement was even greater, AAD = 24 % (1 MPa), for the values obtained with PR equation. The optimisation of interaction parameter made a significant change, introducing the k ij = 0.034 (95 % confidence interval, CI k ij = ± 0.004) into the SRK EoS led to AAD = 2.2 % (0.11 MPa) and for the PR equation AAD of 1.5 % (0.07 MPa) was achieved with k ij = 0.043 (CI k ij = ± 0.002). The first approach was to use all data obtained for one system to optimize the interaction parameter, which would be temperature independent. However, in the case of the H2 solubility in both examined liquids, the calculated pressures did not match the experimental data well enough when the same interaction parameter was used at all temperatures (Table 6). Therefore, the interaction parameters were optimized separately for the data sets at every temperature, which led to a better agreement between the experimental and the calculated pressures. Both used cubic equations of state, the SRK and PR, have proven equally applicable in the modelling of the hydrogen solubility. The binary interaction parameters optimized for the PR EoS are greater than for the SRK, while the agreement of the calculations with the experimental data was almost the same for both equations when k ij was included. Significant decrease of deviation between the experimental and the data calculated using the SRK and PR EoSs, as well as the narrow confidence intervals obtained for the interaction parameters, confirms the importance of knowing the binary interaction parameter. The improvement in the matching of the calculations with experimental results for the H2 solubility, achieved by optimizing k ij at each studied temperature separately, showed that the binary interaction parameter should be treated as temperature dependent. The binary interaction parameters optimized for the H2 + furfuryl alcohol system depend almost linearly on the temperature, while the influence of the temperature on the interaction parameters for H2 + furfural is not that obvious and more experimental data are needed for an accurate conclusion (for more details see Supplementary material to this paper). 3.2.2 PC-SAFT The perturbed chain statistic associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) [49] is a somewhat newer approach to data processing in comparison to the cubic equations of state. Huang and Radosz [50] in 1990. developed a practical equation of state, based on a statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) that was further modified by Gross and Sadowski [49,51] in 2001. This equation of state expresses reduced residual Helmholtz free energy, ã res, as a sum of the reduced Helmholtz energy of a hard chain, ã hc, reduced dispersion Helmholtz energy, ã disp, and reduced Helmholtz energy due to association, ã assoc: (8) a ~ res = a ~ hc + a ~ disp + a ~ assoc The PC-SAFT equation has wide application and enables the calculation of various thermodynamic properties, but, it requires knowledge of the three parameters for non-associating compounds and two more for associating ones. The parameters of the PC-SAFT EoS are the number of segments per chain, m, the temperature independent segment diameter, σ, the segment energy parameter, ε, and for associating components, additionally the associating energy, ε AiBi, and the effective association volume, κ AiBi. The parameters for CO2 and H2 used in this work (Table 7 ) are taken from the literature [49,52] and for furfural and furfuryl alcohol parameters for the PC-SAFT equation are optimized (Table 7) using the density data, published by Guerrero et al. [40]. The parameters obtained for furfural are quite similar to those given in the literature [18,53]. Furfuryl alcohol is treated first as a non-associative compound, and the three parameters were optimized. Later, the five parameters for associative components were optimized for furfuryl alcohol, but this did not significantly affect the modelling quality. The AADs between the calculated densities, and those taken from the literature [40], were almost the same in both cases. Besides, very wide 95 % confidence intervals, obtained for the optimized parameters, κ AiBi and ε AiBi/kB, indicated that the associating term did not have important role in the modelling of furfuryl alcohol’s densities, so furfuryl alcohol was treated as non-associative in the further optimization of the interaction parameters. The PC-SAFT parameters for the mixtures are calculated from the parameters for the pure components by applying mixing rules: (9) m m = ∑ i x i · m i (10) σ ij = 0.5 · σ i + σ j (11) ε ij = ε i · ε j · 1 - k ij where subscript m stands for mixture of pure components i and j. After providing the parameters for pure compounds, the modelling of hydrogen solubility could be performed. The calculation of equilibrium pressures, using PC-SAFT equation, neglecting k ij, led to insufficient agreement with the experimental data, so the determination of binary interaction parameter was indispensable. The PC-SAFT equation, with k ij = 0, overestimated CO2 solubility in furfural so the calculated equilibrium pressures were lower than the experimental for about 50 %. On the other hand, the hydrogen solubility in furfural and furfuryl alcohol was highly underestimated, the AAD of the pressures was about 140 %. In the case of H2 + furfural, the prediction of the equilibrium pressure, without the binary interaction parameter, gave the best results when the SRK EoS was applied, and for the system H2 + furfuryl alcohol, the best results were obtained by using the PR EoS. Still, the agreements between the experimental results and the calculations were unsatisfying, AAD ≈ 15 %, and it showed that the phase equilibrium predictions for the studied systems with hydrogen are poorly applicable, if the binary interaction parameter is not known. The optimized binary interaction parameters of the PC-SAFT equation, together with the quality criteria, AAD, are given in Table 8 (Fig. 5 ). Small deviations between the PC-SAFT parameters obtained at different temperatures and the one optimized for all data together, for both studied systems with H2, indicate that the parameters can be considered temperature independent. The binary interaction parameters of the PC-SAFT equation are much lower for the systems containing hydrogen than for CO2 + furfural. This trend was noted in the literature [54]. The interaction parameters for the systems with H2 have high negative values, which confirms that the solubility of hydrogen is not easy to model and it significantly depends on an accurate determination of the binary interaction parameter. 3.2.3 Henry’s law By Henry’s law, the fugacity of a solute is proportional to its molar fraction in a solution, at constant temperature [42]. That proportionality is defined by Henry’s constant, H i,solvent, which does not depend on a composition but is temperature dependent: (12) H i,solvent = lim x i → 0 f i L x i T where f denotes fugacity, i stands for the solute, and L for the liquid phase. The pressure influence on the constant is negligible at lower pressures, but at higher pressures it should be considered. Krichevsky-Kasarnovsky equation [42] can be used to describe solubility of gases at high pressures: (13) ln f i x i = ln H i,solvent ( p solvent S ) + v i ¯ ∞ ( p - p solvent S ) R T where v i ¯ ∞ is a partial molar volume of the solute in a liquid phase, at infinite dilution, p S solvent denotes a saturation pressure of the solvent, and H i,solvent ( p solvent S ) represents the Henry’s constant, evaluated at reference pressure, p S solvent, when x i = 0. Henry’s constants were determined from plots ln(f i/x i) vs. (p − p S solvent), and given in Table 9 . The Henry’s constants for hydrogen in the both studied solvents decrease as temperature rises and it is higher in the case of furfuryl alcohol than for furfural. That is in accordance with the experimental data, H2 is more soluble in furfural than in furfuryl alcohol and the solubility rises with increase in temperature. Knowing of the Henry’s constant enables the calculation of the enthalpy, Δdis H, and the entropy, Δdis S, of the hydrogen dissolution in furfural and furfuryl alcohol at specific pressure, p 0 (Table 9)[56]: (14) Δ dis H = R ∂ ln ( H ( T , p ) / p 0 ) ∂ ( 1 / T ) (15) Δ dis S = - R ∂ ln ( H ( T , p ) / p 0 ) ∂ ln ( T ) These properties were obtained by linear fitting of the Henry’s constants and temperatures as given in Eqs. (14) and (15), so, knowledge of the Henry’s constant, at minimum three temperatures, was necessary. The enthalpy provides information about the interaction between the solvent and the dissolved gas, while the entropy is related to ordering level in a mixture. Positive values of the dissolution enthalpy show that the dissolution of hydrogen in furfural and furfuryl alcohol is an endothermic process and, therefore, the increase in temperature favours solubility of H2. The enthalpy of H2 dissolution in furfuryl alcohol is higher than for furfural, which points to poorer solubility. Breaking intermolecular bonds in solvent is endothermic process while the incorporation of the gas molecules into cavities within solvent is exothermic, and the amount of released energy depends on gas-solvent interactions [44]. Hence, the higher enthalpy obtained for H2 + furfuryl alcohol system, in comparison to H2 + furfural, indicates that more energy is required to separate molecules of furfuryl alcohol, probably due to the hydrogen bonds [45], and / or the interactions between H2 and furfuryl alcohol are weaker than in the case of furfural. The positive values of entropy show that the dissolution of hydrogen causes lower ordering in solution. The dissolution entropy is expected to be positive for gases that are poorly soluble [42] and such a case was observed here."
8,Conclusions,"Defunctionalisation processes represent an important step in the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals. The understanding and the prediction of these processes require knowledge of the phase-equilibria of CO2 or H2 mixtures with various bio-based compounds. Therefore, the solubility of H2 in furfural and furfuryl alcohol was studied here. An analytical measurement method was applied to determine the solubility of CO2 and H2 in furfural and H2 in furfuryl alcohol. The solubility of CO2 in furfural was studied in the literature, under various conditions, so this was a test experiment, and good agreement between the literature and the experimental data confirmed correctness of the measurement procedure. Some phase-equilibrium data are available in the literature for H2 + furfural system at narrower range of pressure then studied here, and they agree well with the results presented in this paper. As expected, CO2 dissolves significantly better in furfural than H2, and they show the opposite solubility dependence on temperature. The solubility of both, CO2 and H2, in furfural, rises with increasing pressure. The increase in temperature leads to poorer dissolution of CO2, while the solubility of H2 increases. Hydrogen is more soluble in furfural than in furfuryl alcohol for about 15 % of the H2 molar fraction. All measured data were modelled using the SRK and PR cubic equations of state and the PC-SAFT equation of state, and satisfactory agreements between the calculated and the experimental pressures were obtained, AAD less than 4 %. Prior to the optimization of the binary interaction parameters of the PC-SAFT equation, it was necessary to determine parameters for pure components. The parameters of the PC-SAFT equation for furfural and furfuryl alcohol were optimized based on their densities found in the literature, and AAD between the published and the calculated density values was about 0.03 %. The prediction of phase-equilibrium pressures by using the SRK and PR equations without including the interaction parameter (k ij = 0) gave poor results and additionally confirmed the importance of knowing the binary interaction parameters for different systems. The first approach was to model all data of a system together, and if the results were not satisfactory, the data measured at different temperatures would be modelled separately. For CO2 + furfural system, the interaction parameters of all used equations seemed temperature-independent. In the case of the hydrogen solubility in the studied liquids, the interaction parameters of the SRK and PR EoS differed with the change in temperature, while the parameters of the PC-SAFT equation of state were similar under all studied temperatures. The binary interaction parameters obtained for the CO2 + furfural system were low and positive. In the case of the hydrogen solubility modelling, the parameters had much higher negative values, which again, emphasized the significance of an accurate determination of the interaction parameters for the systems containing hydrogen. The determination of binary interaction parameters enabled the calculation of the Henry’s constant, and the enthalpy and the entropy of hydrogen dissolution in the examined solvents. For both systems, Henry’s constants decrease as the temperature increases, and they were higher for the hydrogen solubility in furfuryl alcohol than in furfural. The calculated enthalpies of dissolution had positive values, which confirmed that the hydrogen solubility in both bio-based solvents is endothermic process. The contributions of this research are phase-equilibrium data for H2 + furfuryl alcohol system, that has not been studied before, and the enlargement of the phase-equilibrium data set for H2 + furfural. The highly valuable binary interaction parameters of the SRK, PR and PC-SAFT equations of state were determined for CO2 + furfural, H2 + furfural and H2 + furfuryl alcohol systems. Besides that, the parameters of the PC-SAFT equation for pure components were optimized for furfural and furfuryl alcohol."
