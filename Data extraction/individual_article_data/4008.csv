0,Introduction,"The catalytic conversion of syngas to higher alcohols is generally recognized as an attractive route for the production of clean fuels and valuable fuel additives. However, due to the complexity of the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) process, the targeted product yields still remain low and there is no HAS process (from syngas) available on a commercial scale to this day [1,2]. According to the well-known CO insertion mechanism, HAS essentially needs the combination of several elemental steps, including CO dissociation, carbon chain propagation, CO insertion and stepwise hydrogenation to form alcohol products [3]. These reaction steps usually occur on different active centers in parallel and/or in sequence. As a result, the HAS catalysts need dual active sites on which multiple catalysis reaction can occur, with one site active for CO dissociation and carbon chain growth and the other site facilitating the CO insertion between the metal site and alkyl groups [4,5]. Therefore, the development of catalysts containing different active centers is essential to improve the higher alcohol formation. Co is one of the most investigated elements in HAS reaction due to its strong ability for CO dissociation and carbon chain growth [6]. Due to the requirement of HAS reaction, the association of Co with a second active site that is active for CO insertion is critical for alcohol formation. To date, various combinations of Co-based dual active centers have been investigated for HAS. Pei et al. [7] reported that a Co-Co2C catalyst was responsible for higher alcohol formation. The close proximity of Co0 and Co2C species formed the dual active site for HAS, with Co2C active for non-dissociative CO adsorption and subsequent CO insertion into the adjacent CxHy species. Co2C phase was also found to be generated during the reaction process over metal organic framework (MOF)-mediated Co-based catalysts, which shifted the products distribution from hydrocarbons to higher alcohols [8]. Copper has been commonly used as the second metal for Co-based catalysts as it is known for methanol formation [9–11]. Xiao et al. [11] found that a CoCu alloy led to higher C2+OH selectivity because Cu can adsorb CO non-dissociatively, and insert CO to the adjacent hydrocarbon intermediates. Recently, Sun et al. [12] applied density functional theory (DFT) study towards CoCu catalysts and proved that the existence of CoCu bimetallic sites was more selective to C2+ oxygenates. Although the aforementioned dual active site catalysts are responsible for higher alcohol formation, the main products of the syngas conversion reaction were still hydrocarbons, and further improvement is thus necessary. Wang et al. [13] investigated the catalytic activity of CuCo based catalysts with iron promotion for HAS. The results revealed that the addition of small amounts of Fe improved the higher alcohol formation by introducing additional active sites for CO hydrogenation, carbon chain growth and CO insertion. Recently, a carbon nanotube-supported tri-metallic Co-Cu-Ce catalyst was reported to exhibit a higher C2+OH selectivity compared to that of the monometallic catalysts (Co/CNT and Cu/CNT) and bimetallic catalysts (Co-Ce/CNT, Cu-Ce/CNT, and Co-Cu/CNT) in HAS [14]. The addition of Ce promoted the reduction of CoCu catalyst and created a Co-CeO2 interface which acted as a new active site for HAS in addition to the CuCo bimetallic active sites. Therefore, it is promising to improve the higher alcohol formation via controlled tuning of the catalyst with the introduction of new active centers according to the requirements of the HAS. In our previous study, it was demonstrated that bimetal CoNi alloy in La0.9Sr0.1Co1−xNixO3 perovskite catalysts exhibited a positive effect on higher alcohol selectivity and yield, for low nickel substitution level (x = 0.1) [15]. For catalyst x = 0.1, the Co and Ni ions were uniformly distributed at the atomic level in the crystal lattice. After reduction, the perovskite structure collapsed, and a bimetallic CoNi alloy was formed, which played a crucial role in enhancing the higher alcohol distribution, with Ni0 promoting CO insertion under hydrogenation conditions. However, methane was the main product, and the higher alcohol yield remained low for industrial application. As discussed above, Cu can serve as a CO insertion site during the CO hydrogenation reaction, which promotes the higher alcohol formation. Furthermore, the addition of Cu can alter the redox and electronic properties of the catalysts [16,17]. Also, the existence of Cu could be expected to promote Co2C formation during the reaction according to Volkova et al. [18]. In this study, the perovskite structure was chosen as a catalyst precursor to take advantages of the intimate contact between the metallic ions and of the high metallic dispersion [19,20]. Cu is ideal to substitute on the B site of ABO3-type perovskite catalysts due to its similar electron negative and atom radius to Co and Ni, which is expected to favor the formation of the alloy with Co and Ni. Therefore, Cu was selected as the third component in the CoNi perovskite catalyst to act as an additional active center for HAS. The trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu catalyst derived from perovskite precursor was prepared and examined in a fixed-bed reactor. Its catalytic performance for HAS from syngas was compared with monometallic Co and bimetallic CoNi perovskite catalysts in detail. The active centers for HAS were identified and their roles in HAS were evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, no other study related to the HAS over perovskite-derived trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu catalyst has been reported to date. We believed this study will provide a valuable insight into the development of HAS over multiple active centers."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of Co-based perovskite catalysts (La0.9Sr0.1Co1−x−yNixCuyO3) were synthesized using a co-precipitation method following the procedure detailed in previous literature [21]. Briefly, the required amount of lanthanum, strontium, cobalt, nickel and copper nitrates, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, were dissolved in distilled water. Then, ammonia (35% mass fraction, Aldrich) was added to the above solution dropwise under stirring until a pH of 9 was reached. The obtained precipitate was dried at 120 °C overnight and then calcined in flowing air at 800 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalysts will hereon be denoted as LSC, LSCN and LSCNC in this study to represent La0.9Sr0.1CoO3, La0.9Sr0.1Co0.9Ni0.1O3 and La0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Ni0.1Cu0.1O3, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface areas of the catalysts were carried out by N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Micro Tristar II apparatus. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were determined on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The spectra were collected over a range of 2θ of 10–75° at a scan speed of 5°/min. The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) tests were performed on a Chem BET 3000 equipment. The catalyst (100 mg) was pre-treated at 300 °C under a nitrogen flow for 1 h and then cooled down to 50 °C. Then a 5% H2/N2 gas mixture was introduced to the system (20 ml/min), and the temperature increased from room temperature to 750 °C with a rate of 5 °C/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Zeiss NEON 40 EsB focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system with Al Kα X-ray radiation. The binding energy (BE) values were corrected for charging effects by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.6 eV."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements Catalytic activity tests were carried out in a high-flow fixed-bed reactor (Spider 3 Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) instrument, AMTech, Germany). Detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures were given elsewhere [15]. Briefly, 0.5 g catalysts in 140–270 mesh were diluted with 1.5 g alumina with the same size and then loaded into a fixed bed reactor for in-situ reduction at 450 °C, 0.1 MPa, and 20 vol% H2/N2 (100 ml/min) overnight. The reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperatures 275–325 °C, P = 3.0 MPa, gas flow 200 ml/min and H2/CO/N2 = 2:1:3. Online gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (Agilent 7890/5977 GC/MS) was used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis. A packed column (TDX-01) was connected to the TCD detector for analysis of exhaust gas. A MS HP-5 column was connected to the mass spectrometer for the analysis of all organic products. CO conversion (XCO) and the product selectivity (SX) were calculated according to the following equations: X CO = Mole CO in − Mole CO out Mole CO in × 100 % S X = C i × n i ∑ i C i × n i × 100 % where MoleCO in and MoleCO out are the moles of CO in the feed and outlet gases, respectively; Ci is the mole of the detected carbon-containing product i and n i is the number of carbons in the product. Each condition was carried out for 24 h and the data obtained from each experiment were the average of measurements over a steady-state period."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization 3.1.1 Physical properties of the catalysts The specific surface areas of the prepared perovskite catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The S BET of all the perovskite samples were rather low (below 5 m2/g) due to the high calcination temperature (800 °C). Thus the slight differences in S BET are expected to have negligible effects on the catalytic activity. 3.1.2 XRD results XRD patterns of the different Co-based catalysts at different stages are shown in Fig. 1 . In all of the fresh catalysts (Fig. 1A), the typical diffraction peaks of the LaCoO3 (JCPDS-ICDD 48-0123) at 2θ value 32–34° were observed, indicating that the main phase of the catalyst precursors was perovskite. There were no obvious differences in the XRD patterns for the fresh perovskite catalysts with different B site elements. The small difference of the atomic radii between cobalt (1.25 Å), nickel (1.24 Å) and copper (1.28 Å) only resulted in a small change in the crystalline domain sizes according to the Scherrer equation (see Table 1) [19]. After reduction at 450 °C (Fig. 1B), the perovskite diffraction peaks were only partially preserved in the LSC catalyst, although broader, suggesting a partial collapse of the structure. The perovskite structure for bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts (LSCN and LSCNC respectively) was barely observed, and the catalysts exhibited La2O3 (JCPDS-ICDD 74-2430) and La2SrOx (JCPDS-ICDD 42-0343) phases, as observed in previous studies [15,21]. The typical diffraction lines of metallic cobalt (JCPDS-ICDD 15-0806), nickel (JCPDS-ICDD 04-0850) and copper (JCPDS-ICDD 04-0836) are 44.22°, 44.51° and 43.29°, respectively. In Fig. 1B right, a diffraction peak at 44.32° was observed for the LSCN catalyst, between the pure cobalt and nickel diffraction lines. A similar diffraction peak was observed on the LSCNC catalyst, however slightly shifted to the left, closer to the cobalt diffraction peak, compared to the LSCN catalyst. The shift in 2θ values was due to the incorporation of copper to cobalt and nickel, indicating the formation of a tri-metallic alloy in the reduction process. This can be related to the results of Lua et al. [22] who reported that the reduction of Ni-Cu-Co oxalate hydrate produced a Ni-Cu-Co alloy. It should be mentioned that the shift in 2θ values between the CoNi alloy and the Co-Ni-Cu alloy is small due to the low amount of copper in the catalyst. After the reaction, the perovskite structure was completely decomposed for all samples (see Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the literature, indicating that the catalysts can further reduce to form metallic Co species and the related La2O3 and La2SrOx phases in the presence of the reductive atmosphere (H2) [21]. However, the diffraction peaks of the La2O3 and La2SrOx phases detected in the reduced catalysts were not observed here in the spent catalysts. It is believed that these phases reacted with the CO2 and H2O generated during the reaction as the equations: La2O3 + CO2 → La2O2CO3 and La2O2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 LaCO3OH [23]. Noted that LaCO3OH (JCPDS-ICDD 26-0815) is the dominated phase over the spent catalysts, suggesting the CO hydrogenation reaction is significant at higher temperatures, in line with the reaction results. In Fig. 1C, right, the much weaker diffraction peaks for Co, CoNi alloy and Co-Ni-Cu alloy were still observed. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of Co2C (JCPDS-ICDD 72-1369) can be clearly detected on the spent catalysts, meaning that part of the cobalt either in metallic or alloy form reacted with CO during the reaction. Although Pei et al. [7] reported that the Co2C is unstable and can be decomposed to metallic cobalt and polymeric carbon above 300 °C, cobalt carbide phases formed during the HAS reaction process have been observed in spent catalysts. Liu and co-workers [9,24–26] reported that for LaCoO3-based perovskite catalysts, Co2C phases which formed during the reaction process would still be reserved even after reaction at 350 °C. Furthermore, the peak intensity of the Co2C phase gradually increased from the monometallic to the bimetallic and trimetallic catalyst, suggesting that the CoNi and Co-Ni-Cu alloy favors the formation of Co2C rather than that of metallic Co, as stated by Volkova et al. [18]. The alumina (Al2O3) used for dilution and quartz wool (SiO2) used for catalyst packing inside the reactor were detected as contaminants in the catalysts after the reaction. There was no evidence demonstrated that Al2O3 and SiO2 could react with the catalyst at the reaction condition in this study. 3.1.3 H2-TPR Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the Co-based catalysts. For all the samples, there were two main peaks within the temperature range of 200–750 °C, which can be ascribed to the two-steps reduction. The reduction of Co3+ to Co2+, Ni3+ to Ni2+ and Cu2+ to Cu0 are responsible for the low temperature peaks observed at 300–480 °C (200–370 °C for the LSCNC catalyst), and the second main peak at higher temperatures corresponded to the complete reduction of cobalt and nickel. The reduction properties of perovskite catalysts are significantly affected by the catalyst composition: the reduction peaks of the LSCN and LSCNC catalysts gradually shifted to lower temperatures compared to that of the LSC catalyst. This shift indicates that the strong mutual effect of cobalt, nickel and copper was responsible for the improvement of the catalyst reducibility [27–29]. It can be noted that for the LSC and LSCN catalysts, there was a shoulder at the higher temperature of the first reduction peak (438 °C for the LSC catalyst and 410 °C for the LSCN catalyst, respectively), which can be attributed to the one-step reduction of Co3+ to Co0 in the perovskite structure [30]. Although there was no such shoulder observed for the LSCNC catalyst in the first reduction peak, it is reasonable to deduce that the reduction peak of Co3+ to Co0 was overlapping with the Co3+ to Co2+ reduction peak due to the enhanced reducibility. The existence of the one-step reduction of Co3+ to Co0 can be confirmed by the XRD spectra of the reduced catalysts, where metallic Co, CoNi alloy and Co-Ni-Cu alloy can be observed (Fig. 1B). The addition of copper improves the trimetallic catalyst reducibility by lowering the reduction temperature. As a consequence, the catalyst activity is expected to increase with Cu addition. 3.1.4 XPS The XPS analyses were carried out to study the chemical state of the surface Co species in reduced and used catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Co 2p profiles of the reduced catalysts are similar for the 3 catalysts, with the Co 2p3/2 main peak at the BE of ~779.7 eV, along with a satellite peak located at 784–788 eV [31]. Deconvolution of the Co 2p3/2 signal indicates that surface Co species were mainly composed of two components: Co0, indicated by the peak with the lower BE of 778.6 eV, and Co2+, evidenced by the peak observed at the higher BE of 780.1 eV [6,14]. This demonstrated the formation of metallic Co on the catalysts surface and the partial preserved Co2+ species after reduction, in accordance with the XRD and TPR results. It is worth noting that there was a gradual shift of the Co0 peak binding energy for the LSCN and LSCNC catalysts, by 0.2 eV and 0.4 eV, respectively. This shift indicates the existence of an interaction between Co, Ni and Cu, and it is expected that the electronic properties of Co changed considerably due to the formation of CoNi or Co-Ni-Cu alloy [32]. Furthermore, the substitution of Ni and Cu in the LSC catalyst led to the Co0 peak at 778 eV becoming more predominant, with the value of the peak area ratio of Co0/Co2+ increasing in the order LSC (0.54) < LSCN (0.95) < LSCNC (1.20), which is in agreement with the increase of catalyst reducibility from the TPR results. Similarly, both Co0 and Co2+ can be observed in the Co 2p XPS spectra of the spent catalysts in Fig. 3B. On the basis of XRD analysis, the peak at 778.6 eV was assigned to the Co0 phase. These results proposed the direct evidence that metallic Co exists after the reaction. Co2+ species (peak at 781.2 ± 0.2 eV) should be attributed to the Co2C species on the spent catalysts as no obvious peak attributed to Co oxides (528–529 eV) could be found on the O1s spectra displayed in Fig. 3C. The O 1s peaks observed at 531–533 eV were assigned to the surface adsorbed oxygen in the form of vacancies, hydroxyl and carbonate species [27,33]. In addition, the relative surface area ratio of Co2C/Co0 in the spent catalysts was found in the order LSC (0.9) < LSCN (2.69) < LSCNC (4.34). These results are in agreement with the XRD measurements of the spent catalysts and prove that the substitution of Ni and Cu elements into the LSC catalyst promoted the formation of Co2C during the reaction. 3.1.5 SEM The SEM images of the catalysts before (as-prepared, before reduction) and after reaction are shown in Fig. 4 , aiming to determine their micro-morphologies. The SEM micrographs of fresh catalysts do not show large morphological differences among the perovskite samples with different active centers: the dominant morphologies were irregular shaped grains. When compared with the single (A) and binary (C) catalysts, the ternary LSCNC catalyst (E) showed similar particle sizes. After the reaction, only a slight particle agglomeration and a rough surface were observed over all the catalysts. These results suggested that the surface morphologies of the catalysts were similar before and after reaction, so that they will not affect the catalyst activity."
7,Evaluation of Co-based perovskite catalysts activities in HAS,"3.2 Evaluation of Co-based perovskite catalysts activities in HAS For all the catalysts in this study, an induction period existed prior to achieving steady state. According to the XRD results, the catalysts underwent a transition stage to be fully active, that is, the perovskite structure completely decomposed and the Co was fully reduced to Co0 species [21]. The catalytic performance of tri-metallic LSCNC perovskite catalyst at steady state (18–24 h) was studied and compared with that of Co and CoNi based perovskite catalysts under different temperatures. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . The catalyst compositions considerably affected the catalyst activity and higher alcohol formation. As shown in Fig. 5A, the CO conversion increased with increasing temperature for all catalysts, especially from 300 to 310 °C. This observation suggests that other reactions occur on the Co-based catalysts. As H2O is formed as a side product during the reaction, it would further react with CO at higher temperatures to form CO2 through the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. The high reaction temperature helped to overcome the reaction energy barrier to form other F-T products. However, the presence of Ni in the catalyst tended to decrease the CO conversion at high temperatures (from 53.4% to 44.4% at T = 310 °C for LSC and LSCN catalysts respectively), and it consistently decreased further with the extra addition of Cu (17.1% at T = 310 °C for LSCNC catalyst). It is believed that the catalytic activity of Co-based catalysts for HAS depends on the available metallic Co sites on the catalyst surface [21]. According to the characterization results, the substitution of Co by Ni and Cu in the LSC catalyst, and the promoted formation of Co2C with Ni and Cu led to a decrease of the Co0 sites available for CO dissociation, resulting in a lower ratio of dissociated CO to non-dissociated CO on the catalyst surface. Hence, it is understandable that the drop in CO conversion with the Ni and Cu substituted catalysts is associated with the reduced quantity of Co0 active sites. The selectivity towards hydrocarbons (CxHy) increased with increasing reaction temperature over the three perovskite catalysts (Fig. 5B). This is due to the enhanced ability of the dissociative adsorption of CO at higher temperatures, which is favorable for hydrocarbon formation. On the contrary, the total alcohol selectivity decreases upon increasing the reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 5C. It is worth mentioning that the addition of Cu into the perovskite catalyst reduced the hydrocarbon selectivity. This is because copper is not favorable towards CO hydrogenation and the existence of Cu reduced the amount of Co sites available to the reaction gases. Besides, the electronic structure of cobalt and nickel sites was modified by the strong metal-metal interactions in the alloy, thus the CO dissociation ability of cobalt and nickel sites was decreased, leading to the restriction of hydrocarbon formation [16,34]. The lower selectivity of hydrocarbons would benefit the formation of alcohol products as more CO were available for the HAS process. Moreover, the formation of CO2 is unavoidable during the reaction due to the WGS reaction. The CO2 selectivity of LSCNC perovskite catalyst was higher than that of LSC and LSCN catalysts, especially at 315 °C (Fig. 5D). This is because Cu is known to be more active than Co for WGS reaction [35]. Fig. 5E shows the total alcohol space time yield (STY) changed dramatically with temperature. The alcohol STY for all catalysts was very low around 275 °C and increased with increasing reaction temperatures to 310 °C, where they reached a maximum (for the LSCNC catalyst, the maximum was reached at 315 °C). The maximal alcohol STY remained constant during the test of 24 h at this temperature. When the reaction temperature increased further, a drop of alcohol STY was detected for all catalysts. This is because at the higher reaction temperatures, the hydrocarbon formation and WGS reaction become more predominant, as shown by the high increase in CxHy and CO2 selectivity from 300 °C observed for all catalysts [36,37]. In addition, the WGS reaction would lead to a change in the H2/CO ratio and contribute to the decrease in CO insertion and carbon chain growth. The measured STY of different alcohol products over the three catalysts at 315 °C are presented in Fig. 6 . Among all the prepared catalysts, the tri-metallic LSCNC catalyst showed excellent higher alcohol formation from syngas, with a C2+OH STY of 142.1 mg·gcat. −1·h−1, which is more than two times higher than that of Co-based and Co-Ni-based perovskite catalysts. As we noted in the BET and SEM analysis, there were no obvious differences in the catalyst specific surface area and catalyst morphology between the three catalysts. Therefore the dramatically increased C2+OH yield over the LSCNC catalyst can be owned to the synergistic effect between Co, Ni and Cu species. On the basis of the XRD and XPS results, it might originate from the formation of Co-Ni-Cu alloy, which can be observed in both reduced and spent catalysts. As previously reported by the authors, Co0 was active for CO dissociation and carbon chain growth, while Ni in the CoNi alloy exhibited a strong ability for CO insertion [15]. Cu is also known as an active site for HAS as it assists the CO non-dissociative adsorption and CO insertion [17]. In the trimetallic LSCNC catalyst, the perovskite structure provided a uniform mixing of the Co, Ni and Cu ions, leading to the formation of the Co-Ni-Cu alloy after reduction, which resulted in the extremely close proximity of the active centers on the catalyst surface. Thus the ternary alloy lead to the synergistic effect between the Co, Ni and Cu active sites and enabled a higher yield of alcohols. Furthermore, the formation of Co2C species from Co during the reaction was observed in XRD and XPS analysis. According to Pei et al., bulk Co2C species were inert during the F-T reaction and only those located on the surface or subsurface of the catalyst became active for alcohol formation [38]. As shown in Fig. 6, the C2+OH yield increased with increasing Co2C/Co0 ratios, calculated from the XPS analyzes of the spent catalysts, suggesting that the surface Co2C phase formed during the reaction was active for higher alcohol formation [39]. As a result, there is considerable interface between Co and Co2C formed in this study, which could be considered as the active site for HAS, as stated by several authors [18,40]. This observation indicates that the Co0-Co2C interface could, at least in part, be responsible for the increased higher alcohol formation. Co0 was active for CO dissociation and carbon chain growth while Co2C species were responsible for CO non-dissociation and subsequent CO insertion into the surface hydrocarbon groups to form higher alcohols. Based on the above discussion, it can be proposed that the C2+OH formation with trimetallic catalysts under the test conditions was due to the combined catalytic actions of Co-Ni-Cu alloy and Co-Co2C species. For comparison with the work presented here, representative Co, Ni and Cu based catalysts with excellent catalytic performance reported in the literature are listed in Table 2 . As expected, different kinds of catalysts and reaction conditions led to different alcohol yields. Taking the higher alcohol yield and reaction conditions into consideration, the tri-metallic perovskite catalyst La0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Ni0.1Cu0.1O3 prepared in this study reached a high level of C2+OH formation, superior to the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. Co, Ni and Cu species share the same role in all catalysts during the reaction, thus the synergistic effect of the active centers play a role in HAS. Notably, the combination of Co, Ni and Cu has been effective in generating Co-Ni-Cu alloy and Co-Co2C species, and the synergism of these active sites enabled to greatly increase the C2+OH yield. Although CoCu bimetallic catalysts have been extensively investigated, only CoCu alloy and limited amount of Co2C species were formed during the reaction [24], resulting in relatively lower C2+OH formation due to lack of Ni."
8,Conclusions,"In this work, a trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu catalyst derived from perovskite precursor was obtained via co-precipitation method and compared with similar mono- and bi-metallic catalysts. With the addition of Cu, a Co-Ni-Cu alloy was identified after reduction, which facilitated the formation of Co2C species during the reaction, resulting in an increased relative Co2C/Co ratio. The trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu catalyst exhibited more than twofold the yield of higher alcohols compared to its counterparts monometallic Co and bimetallic CoNi catalysts. It is proposed that the high C2+OH formation over Co-Ni-Cu trimetallic catalyst is associated with the combined catalytic action and synergistic effect of Co-Ni-Cu alloy and Co-Co2C interface: (1) the superior intimate contact of metallic Co, Ni and Cu in the form of an alloy improved their synergistic effect, with Co0 active for CO dissociation and subsequent carbon chain growth, Ni0 catalyzing CO insertion, and Cu0 facilitating the CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion; and (2) the formation of Co2C also favored the CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion, and its interface with Co0 provided the additional efficient dual site for HAS. Higher alcohol synthesis studies of the trimetallic Co-Ni-Cu catalyst show that the active centers and their synergistic effect play an important role to enhance the C2+OH formation. This study provides a clue for the subsequent design of high-performance HAS catalysts by introducing the additional active centers."
