0,Introduction,"Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have the potential to catalyze the production of prochiral ketones with a high conversion rate [1,2]. (S)‑carbonyl reductase II (SCRII) from Candida parapsilosis CCTCC M203011 catalyzed the anti-Prelog reaction of 2-hydroxyacetophenone (2-HAP) to (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol ((S)-PED) with an absolute stereochemical selectivity over 90% yield [3]. A mutant from an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora (KpADH) are able to catalyze diary ketones, such as (4-chlorophenyl)(pyridine-2-yl)ketone with an optical purity of 99.2% [4]. An alcohol dehydrogenase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia can reduce ethyl 4-chloroaceetoacetae to (S)-CHBE, an important chiral intermediate in the synthesis of atovastation, with an e.e. value of >99.9% and a yield of 2664 g·L−1·d−1 [5]. Therefore, alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have attracted increasing attention for efficient enantioselective syntheses from both academic research and industrial applications [6,7]. However, the low solubility of many pharmaceutical substrates and intermediates [8–10] interfere with their distribution in aqueous solutions, thus disrupting their interactions with the enzymes and thus resulting in a low yield of the corresponding products. Many scientists have turned their interest to enzyme-mediated non-aqueous systems, such as organic co-solvent systems and biphasic aqueous-organic systems, to increase product yields. An early successful case was keto ester M, a significant intermediate for the synthesis of Montelukast, which is an important anti-asthma drug. By using the ratio 1:5:3 of tetrahydrofuran:isopropyl-alcohol:H2O, the substrate solubility was improved up to 1 g/L. Under these conditions, the initial product titer reached 0.1–0.2 g/L after 24 h [8,11], whereas almost no product was detected in aqueous reaction systems. Recently, Zheng et al. [12] improved the catalytic efficiency of tert-butyl (3R, 5S)-6-chloro-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate by a recombinant whole-cell system harboring carbonyl reductases. The space time yield was 1.8-fold higher in organic co-solvent systems compared with that in pure aqueous systems. However, there is a caveat in using organic-aqueous systems, as most enzymes in such systems possess low activities, which can be 104–105 times lower than those in aqueous systems as previously acknowledged by scientists [13–16]. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the tolerance of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems. To improve alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases' performance in organic-aqueous systems, their behaviors in organic-aqueous systems need to be studied. Study of structure-based mechanisms of these enzymes enables us to visualize and characterize their behaviors in different solutions. However, it is rather difficult to obtain the crystals of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in a good quality from X-ray diffraction, or to resolve their structure by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum or other techniques. In this review, we summarized the structural characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases from primary to quaternary structures, and discussed their behaviors in organic-aqueous systems at an atomic level thanks to the structures deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) during the past several years. Theoretical preparation further leads us to introduce the recent applications of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems in synthesizing chiral alcohols with improved techniques, such as enzyme immobilization and solvent engineering. By elucidating how their catalytic mechanisms differ due to the structural interactions with the reaction systems, we are hoping to pave the way for alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to well apply to organic-aqueous systems."
1,Basic principles of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in aqueous and organic solvents,"Understanding the basic principles of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems is important in analyzing their catalytic mechanisms at an atomic level [17]. Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases maintain a globular shape in water, leaving most of their polar amino acids on the surface of a protein and the non-polar residues buried inside the protein [18]. These characteristics to some extent stabilize these enzymes in organic solvents. The polar amino acids on the enzyme surface are not well extended into the organic solvents compared to those in water. Fortunately these amino acids tend to form more intramolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, suggesting their feasible applications in organic solvents [19]. Most organic-aqueous solvents can improve the solubility of organic compounds, though these organic solvents themselves have different solubility in water (Table 1 ). Some organic solvents, such as 2-propanol and acetone [20], are soluble at 25 °C in water, so they form water-miscible solvents (organic-cosolvent systems). The other organic solvents such as hexane [20] are almost insoluble (9.5E−4 g/L) at 25 °C thus to form water-immiscible solvents. In most cases, alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases exhibit lower activities in organic-aqueous systems than in aqueous systems. The decrease in enzyme activities can mainly be attributed to three reasons in water-miscible organic cosolvents: (1) The low dielectric constants of the organic solvents compared with water (~80) [21] affect the pKa value of a certain group on the enzyme, thus influencing the energy taken to protonize or deprotonize this group in the selected buffer [13,22,23]. The difference between the buffer pH and the pKa value of a certain group determines the difficulty in changing its protonation state; (2) The disruption of hydrophobic interactions among non-polar residues in the side chains by competitive interactions from hydrophobic water-miscible solvents [24]; and (3) Hydrophilic organic solvents force water molecules from the protein surface into the organic solvents, leading to lower protein flexibility in reactions mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases [25]. The process is mainly determined by the log P values of the organic solvents [26–28]. In water-immiscible solvents, the situation can be more complicated. The interactions between the organic solvents and enzymes still dominate the catalytic process. As most alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases prefer to stay in the aqueous phase, the interfacial area and the tension of the interface, as well as the substrate/product partition, between the aqueous and organic layer matter in a biphasic system [29]. Due to the advantages in extracting products into the organic phase as well as the complexity of the water-immiscible systems/biphasic systems, they are traditionally used to extract proteins and products in downstream processing operations instead of being treated as a model to study the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes in these systems [30,31]. In either of the two organic-aqueous systems, the conformational dynamics of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases can change as well as their catalytic efficiency. The alteration of enzyme behaviors in organic solvents supplies the cornerstone of solvent engineering. Water molecules account for a large proportion of the crystal structures of most alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. This proportion partially illustrates the high water activity (aw) in these enzymes. One possibility is that the water molecules assist in hydride transfer during redox reactions by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases [32]. Another possibility is that a water shell is needed in functional alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, as described by Klibanov et al. [28,33]. Therefore, the combined interaction between the water molecules and the organic solvents affects the enzyme activity in organic-aqueous systems. To better understand the interactions between alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases and solvent molecules with or without substrates at an atomic level, it is essential to study their static or dynamic structures in both aqueous and organic-aqueous systems."
2,Structure-based mechanisms of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems,"The studies of the relationships between protein structures and their behaviors in aqueous solutions have greatly increased recently due to the fast development of structure determination techniques [34–36]. Yet, the studies for the behaviors of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic solvents are still limited and only a few structures for these enzymes solved in organic-cosolvent systems have been deposited in PDB (Table 2 ) mainly due to the great challenge in crystallization in organic solvents [7,37] as well as the limitations in NMR and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) technologies. In this section, all the structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases solved in organic-cosolvent systems deposited in PDB were summarized. The influence of organic solvents on these enzymes at an atomic level was discussed, and the residues promising to influence the stability of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-cosolvent solutions are summarized in Table 3 ."
3,Primary and tertiary structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases shed light on their potential applications in organic-cosolvent systems,"3.1 Primary and tertiary structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases shed light on their potential applications in organic-cosolvent systems 3.1.1 Structure comparisons between alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases with different tolerance towards organic co-solvents Different alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have different tolerance towards the same organic solvent. The enzyme activities of ADH-A′ from Rhodococcus ruber DSM 44541 towards ketones, such as acetophenone and 2-octanone, were improved during the coupled redox reactions using isopropanol (IPA) and acetone as co-substrates [38]. Surprisingly, ADH-A′ can even tolerate 50%–80% (%v/v) of IPA and acetone without any loss of enzyme activities, while Thermoanaerobium brockii alcohol dehydrogenase (TbADH) remained about 50% enzyme activities in 40% IPA (%v/v) [39] and Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (EcDHFR) remained only about 33% enzyme activities in 20% IPA (%v/v) [40]. As can be seen in Table 1, IPA, with a low dielectric constant and high hydrophilic characteristics, may easily deplete structural waters from the surface of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. It is of great interest to understand how ADH-A′ slows down the functional damage from this denaturing process at a high concentration of IPA. The comparison of the primary structures of ADH-A′, TbADH and EcDHFR showed that the hydrophobicity of ADH-A′ is the highest among these enzymes (Fig. 1A). Further analysis for their amino acid composition demonstrated that their different hydrophobicity mainly from three nonpolar residues, i.e. Valine, Alanine and Glycine (Fig. 1B). Among them, the percentages of Gly and Ala in ADH-A′ are about 50% higher than those in EcDHFR (Fig. 1B). As reported by Duhalt et al. [41], enzyme hydrophobicity can affect its enzyme activity partially due to its higher stability in organic solvents because of its higher hydrophobicity. However, enzymes being too tight in solutions can restrain their behaviors thus leading to lower activities as demonstrated previously by Klibanov [13]. Evolutionarily, to balance between enzyme activity and stability, enzymes like ADH-A′ with decent catalytic efficiency in organic solvents should have been evolved for the distributions of hydrophobic residues in their entities, especially in their active site pockets [42–44]. As shown in Fig. 1C–F, both the active site pockets of ADH-A′ and TbADH have 7–17% more hydrophobic residues than EcDHFR. These hydrophobic residues can form hydrophobic interactions with organic compounds, which may stabilize either cofactor or substrate in the active site pockets and accelerate their protonation with the key residues. Further analysis for the diversities of these residues, Gly and Ala shows the most different. Gly is the smallest amino acids without chirality and usually play essential role in enzymes' flexibility [45]. Coincidently, several Gly just sit at the entrance to the nicotinamide ring of NAD in ADH-A′ (Fig. 1C), whereas no Gly sits next to the nicotinamide ring of NAP in TbADH (Fig. 1D). Gly at the entrance of the active site pockets for ADH-A′ may enable those enzymes to reshape its entrance in organic solvents, thus making the protonation process easier than that in TbADH. Hydrophobicity should be treated as a relative value, and the relative hydrophobicity between substrate and organic co-solvent probably matters. (R)‑carbonyl reductase (RCR) from C. parapsilosis has been well studied in our lab during the past decade [46,47]. RCR has wide substrate spectrum and can catalyze prochiral ketones to corresponding chiral alcohols. Our studies of biotransformation of RCR in 3.5% IPA organic-aqueous system improved the yield of relative product from ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate by 300-fold compared with that in aqueous systems [48]. However, the yield started decreasing when the concentration of IPA went up above 3.5%. The low tolerance of RCR towards IPA compared with ADH-A′ and TbADH is confusing. The amino acid composition analysis showed the hydrophobicity of RCR are only 1.8% lower than that of TbADH, and their active site pockets have no obvious differences in the orientation of NAD(H) (Fig. 2A–B), while their substrates are greatly different. As shown in Fig. 2C, ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate has a phenyl ring and a long carbon chain, which may decrease its competitiveness with organic solvent IPA. However, the origin of the different yields of the product when IPA is used for NADH recycling at the same time as co-solvent can be complicated, which may not only be from the different hydrophobicity between substrates and IPA, but also from the different equilibrium constants (K) of the reactions [49]. As the reaction using IPA as a cosubtrate is reversible, so the equilibrium constant (K) at a certain temperature will dominate the yield of the reaction finally if the enzyme remains active. As shown in Eq. (1), the equilibrium constant (K) will mainly be influenced by the temperature of the reaction [50]. Thus, to increase the yield of the product in that case, three factors have to be considered: 1) the relative hydrophilicity of solvent molecules and substrate; 2) enzymes' tolerance towards organic solvent; and 3) the temperature of the reaction. (1) ∆ G = − RT ln K 3.1.2 Discussion on structural changes of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-cosolvent systems Many alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have their active site pocket half-buried, not directly interacting with the organic solvents, while pushing substrate to squeeze into the active site pocket via some channels. The residues in the tunnels to the active site pockets play a significant role as illustrated in the following case of Cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP450 BM3). CYP450 BM3 identified in Bacillus megaterium is a fusion protein between a flavoprotein reductase and a P450 oxygenase (Fig. 3A) [51]. Crystals of CYP450 BM3 grown in organic-aqueous solutions (Table 3) shed light on the structural changes induced by organic solvents in the heme domain which mediates the electron transfer efficiency in enantioselective reaction coordinated with its Cys400 [52]. During the past two decades, Sevrioukova and Kuper et al. successively obtained the crystals of CYP450 BM3 grown in DMSO with different concentrations (0%, 14% and 28%) [53–55] for both wild type (WT) and the mutant of Phe87Ala. Though the backbones of the crystal structures are almost the same (r.m.s.d.: 0.641 Å), they exhibited different enzyme activities (Fig. 3B). CYP450 BM3 in DMSO generally has lower enzyme activities towards the substrate dodecanoic acid. The crystal structures of WT and mutant of F87A grown in 0, 14, and 28% DMSO generated a vivid picture for F87 and the solvent molecules coordinated to the heme domain at its sixth C-position. As shown in Fig. 3C, a DMSO molecule replaced the coordinated water molecule under different crystallization conditions, which was correlated with the dynamics of F87. The residue F87 at the entrance of the heme domain was believed to play a role in preventing DMSO from entering the active site pocket. When F87 was mutated to Ala, DMSO molecules had access to the active sites even in 14% DMSO. Besides, other residues on the flexible loops at the entrance of the active site pocket are also possible to affect solvent molecules in and out of the active site pocket. When DMSO was increased to 28%, a DMSO molecule was observed in the active site pocket coordinated with heme even for WT. This observation demonstrated that F87 was not the only residue which can regulate in-and-out of solvent/substrate molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations [56,57] demonstrated that Arg47 was significant in the substrate tunnel of CYP450 BM3. Further substrate channel analysis by Caver catalyst beta 2.0 [58] showed that R47 exists in 33% channels of CYP450 BM3 (Fig. 4 ). When the concentration of DMSO increases, more DMSO molecules will gather around access channel of the active sites. Consequently, the DMSO molecules will probably enter into the active site pocket by changing the orientation of the residues on the flexible loops, not only R47, but also Glu73 and Tyr51 (Fig. 4A). Besides, Thr268 and Ile401 can also be the engineering targets as they play important roles in proton donation and NADPH in and out of the active site pocket [59,60]. Residues influencing substrate binding in substrate channels are not limited to CY450 BM3. The enzyme activity of a rat cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP450 1A1) towards organic pollutants, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was greatly enhanced by the mutation F240 to A240 [61]. This observation well explained why F240A improved the enzyme activity as F240 just located at the mouth of the substrate tunnel [62]. By removing the large side chain of Phe240, the substrate tunnel became wide enough for big substrates, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) compared with 3,3′,4,4′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl studied in their work. Therefore, the engineering targeted on the residues in the substrate channel and the solvent molecule matters. 3.1.3 The influence of the organic co-solvents on the catalytic cycle of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases The mechanism of organic co-solvents in influencing the enzyme activities can be explained by the catalytic cycles of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases (Fig. 5A) as shown in the following case of CYP BM3 and Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. At the beginning of the catalytic cycle in aqueous systems, a water molecule is coordinated to the heme domain at its sixth C-position (Fig. 5AI) [37,55]. The water molecule will then be replaced by a substrate (Fig. 5AII) [63]. However, in organic-aqueous systems, the water molecule at the sixth C-position of the heme domain is possibly substituted by an organic solvent molecule. This replacement depends on the relative hydrophobicity of the residues in the active site pocket and the solvent molecules in addition to the enzyme tertiary structure. In this case, to initiate the catalytic cycle, the substrate has to squeeze into the active site pocket and replace the organic solvent molecule instead of the water molecule (Fig. 5AI and AII). Therefore, besides the low tolerance of these enzymes in organic-aqueous systems, the enzyme activity change may be due to the competition between the organic solvent molecule and the substrate towards the heme. This deduction can also be extended to Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases [64,65] as shown in Fig. 5B. In step II to step III, to initiate reaction, substrate has to squeeze water molecules or organic solvents out of the position coordinated with Zn, thus the relative dielectric constant of the substrate and organic solvent matters. As shown in the case of CYP450 BM3, it is of great significance to find the key residues influencing the interactions between the heme and the solvent molecule/substrate."
4,Functional assembly of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in regulating their stability in organic-cosolvent systems,"3.2 Functional assembly of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in regulating their stability in organic-cosolvent systems Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases usually form as functional assembly in solutions, most of which exist as homo-oligomers [66,67]. Recently, accumulated evidence showed that oligomerization states can regulate these enzymes functions [68,69]. The oligomerization states of different alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are different, which partially contribute to their different performance in organic solvents. Superposition of the crystal structure of ADH-A′ (PDB No. 2XAA) [70] onto that of TbADH (PDB No. 1YKF) [71] gave a Cα root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) close to 1.840 Å (Fig. 6A). Though the symmetry of their quaternary structures are similar, 10 salt bridges were found (Fig. 6B) at the dimer interface of ADH-A′ from crystals grown in two conditions (PDB Nos. 2XAA and 3JV7), whereas no such salt bridges were found in the crystal structures of TbADH. Salt bridges were known to stabilize protein structures [72,73]. ADH-A′ monomers probably were stabilized by the strengthened oligomeric interactions through salt bridges at the dimer interface in organic-aqueous systems, thus well remaining its high catalytic activity even in 80% IPA. Oligomerization states in protecting alcohol dehydrogenases from denaturing by solvents was also proposed by Ladenstein et al. [74]. Crystal structures comparison for DHFR in 20% IPA and 0% IPA also showed us the potential influence of oligomeric interactions in regulating enzyme activities in organic solvents. In 2017, Agarwal et al. [40] shared their crystal structure of EcDHFR with ligand folate grown in 20% IPA. Crystal structures of EcDHFR (PDB ID: 5EAJ and 5UJX) are dimers in an asymmetric unit. As shown in Fig. 6C, the backbones are almost the same for the crystal structures grown in 0% and 20% IPA. As EcDHFR in 20% IPA has only about 33% activity as that of in 0% IPA [40], something may be changed in its structure in 20% IPA. The Met20 loop (residues Ala9-Leu24) of EcDHFR, which is closely related to the catalytic behaviors of EcDHFR [75,76], are just at the dimer interface as a major force in stabilizing the dimer interface of EcDHFR. Water molecules cluster at the dimer interface of EcDHFR in both 0% IPA and 20% IPA (Fig. 6D–E), while an IPA molecule was detected at the dimer interface in 20% IPA too (Fig. 6E). The insertion of IPA molecules at the dimer interface can interact with key amino acids, such as Asn23 [75] on Met20 loop, thus changing of enzyme activity in 20% IPA. As the dimer interface, mainly referring to the Met20 loop, may be exposed to the organic solvents, thus we can modulate the amino acids on the Met20 loop to change the enzyme's behaviors in different organic solvents. Though the restraint of the Met20 loops to stabilize the dimer interface could conversely decrease the hydride transfer of these enzymes [77], as long as there is only a small amount of enzyme activity loss, this strategy is suitable to engineer these enzymes."
5,Solvent-slaved conformational dynamics of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in regulating their catalytic behaviors,"3.3 Solvent-slaved conformational dynamics of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in regulating their catalytic behaviors Many proteins like DHFR behave solvent-slaved motions in solutions [78]. In other words, the solvent molecules can modulate enzyme activities partially through shaping enzyme conformational mobility [79] as claiming by the results from molecular dynamics simulation recently [40]. So far, few studies have been reported for organic solvent-slaved motions of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, even for aqueous systems. Recently, Duff et al. described the conformational substates regulated by organic solvent (IPA) through Quasi-Anharmonic analysis as shown in Fig. 7A [40]. The presence of IPA molecules changed the energetic landscape of these enzymes shown as substates of I, II and III. This alteration disrupted the proper functional conformational substates as shown in 0% IPA, thus interrupting the hydride transfer [80]. This conclusion is consistent with Wright's observation in aqueous systems [75,81], which also demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of EcDHFR would be influenced by the conformational dynamics of these enzymes. In other words, with cofactor and ligands in the solution, these enzymes not only have the most populated substates but also have a low population of other substates [80,82]. The conformational fluctuations between the main population (ground state) and the low population (excited state) drive substrate and cofactor exchange. As claimed by Agarwal et al. [40], the conformational dynamics of the enzyme can be changed by organic solvents, but how does EcDHFR control the solvent accessibility? Increasing evidence points to the Met20 loop in modulating solvent accessibility for these enzymes. Sawaya's research [83], based on crystal structures, pointed out that reactants were shielded from solvents when Met20 loop was in its closed conformation. Recently, Major et al. [84] compared different sources of DHFR and found that the Met20 loop is highly conserved in different species (Fig. 7E). Based on the solvation analysis of the active sites (Fig. 7B) and the radial distribution function between N5 from the protonated folate and the water oxygen atom (Fig. 7C), the Met20 loop has the potential to control the hydration level in proximity of the substrate, which in turn could affect the pK a of the substrates in these solutions (Fig. 7D). Thus, changing the hydrophobicity of the residues on the Met20 loop is highly promising in altering the solvent accessibility of the active sites of these enzymes, which in turn influences their catalytic efficiency in different organic-aqueous systems. Amino acids, such as Ser148 [75], in stabilizing Met20 loop also should be considered as engineering targets."
6,Recent applications of biotransformation mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems,"As organic-aqueous systems can greatly increase the solubility of organic compounds, scientists have developed different techniques to apply these enzymes into these reaction systems. Though recently some groups have screened several alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases such as isopropanol dehydrogenase (IDH) [85] and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans short chain dehydrogenase (NaSDR) [86] which exist decent tolerance towards organic solvents in reducing their relative substrates (Fig. 8C-1 and C-2), most alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are not tolerant towards organic solvents. To advance the catalytic efficiency of these enzymes in organic-aqueous systems, at least two factors should be considered: 1) the protection of the enzymes from aggregation in organic solvents partially due to the depletion of structural water from their surface; and 2) the interactions among the enzymes, the substrate, and the solvent molecules. In this section, we mainly focus on the applications of solvent engineering in biotransformation by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases towards prochiral ketones (Fig. 8) during the past decade as well as the applied immobilization techniques."
7,Solvent engineering and emerging model systems to predict quantitative relationships between substrates and co-solvents,"4.1 Solvent engineering and emerging model systems to predict quantitative relationships between substrates and co-solvents Prochiral ketones have different characteristics, such as solubility and dielectric constants, and thus favor for different solvents (Table 1). Commercial ADH evo-1.1.200 showed low enzyme activities and conversion rates towards 2-butanone (Fig. 8C-3) and ethyl-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate in pure organic solvents [87–89]. The release of the hydrophilic products from the protein surface can exploit the essential water molecules, leading to low enzyme activities. Thus, Kara et al. replaced the pure organic solvents with organic-aqueous systems. The solvent screening showed that both methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and toluene gave decent conversion rates of 50%, which was about 2.5 times higher than that given by octane [87]. The advantage of MTBE over octane could be attributed to the enhanced solubility of MTBE in water (Table 1). The low solubility of octane, 10,000 times lower than that of MTBE [90], would greatly exclude water molecules in the organic-phase. Thus, the micro-aqueous environment for the enzymes in octane did not exist, resulting in low enzyme activities. The screened organic-solvent system later was applied to the production of corresponding (S)-alcohol reduced from ethyl-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate [89]. (4S)-3-[(5S)-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,5-dioxopentyl]-4-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (ET-4), a key chiral intermediate in the synthesis of a drug to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol levels [91], has multiple carbonyl and phenyl rings in its molecule structure (Fig. 8C-4), so several organic solvents, including benzene, methylbenzene, and xylenes, were used to test its solubility and adaptability with a recombinant E. coli harboring a screened carbonyl reductase during enantioselective synthesis [92]. Xylenes gave higher conversion rates of substrate ET-4 to its relative product than those given by benzene and methylbenzene. Coincidently, they all belong to benzene homologs. The authors are smart to adopt the theory of “like dissolve like” into the process of solvent screening. 1-(3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethenone (Fig. 8C-5), an important intermediate for the synthesis of NK-1 receptor antagonists [93], is insoluble in water. An optimized organic-aqueous system with 50% hexanes, 40% IPA and 10% water was applied to reduce 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethenone by immobilized ketoreductase P1B2, reaching 99% yield and optical purity for (R)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethanol [94]. Realizing that the percentages of different solvents matter in improving the performance of enzyme activities, the authors studied different combinations of organic solvents along with IPA and water to increase the yield of products. The two organic solvents in this reaction system can play different roles. Hexane mainly is responsible for dissolving the substrate, while IPA probably act as two roles: 1) the organic co-solvent to dissolve the substrate; and 2) the co-substrate to regenerate NADPH (major role). As been discussed previously, the equilibrium constant in the reaction finally dominates the yield of the product if enzyme remains active in the organic-aqueous system. Thus, the components of the reaction systems all matters which was demonstrated again in the following case. Truppo et al. found that the enzyme activity would dramatically increase to 8-fold even with only 2% water in the solvent systems compared with that in the pure organic-solvent systems. This dramatic increase of enzyme activities in about 2% water demonstrated the sensitivity of enzymes towards the change of solvent composition in reaction systems [33]. As there are so many organic solvents, solvent engineering can be a blind test sometimes. Fortunately, the existed prediction models [95,96] based on understanding and quantification of molecular interactions can be a guideline for us to rationally operating solvent screening. Previous literatures have been focused on studying the interactions between enzymes and co-solvents as mostly discussed in our third part. Until very recently, Pleiss [97] and Wangler et al. [98] brought up the idea that the interactions between substrates and co-solvents matters. Wangler et al. [99] demonstrated the effectiveness of the prediction model of the electrolyte perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (ePC-SAFR) in their experiments. To apply ePC-SAFR model, some preconditions have to be satisfied: 1) the reacting agents should be charged species; 2) co-solvents have to be polymers; 3) activity coefficients in electrolyte systems are predictable. Butanone and 2-pentanone were selected to be catalyzed by an alcohol dehydrogenase 270 (ADH270) under the reaction systems which met the requirements for ePC-SAFR model. Xexp, a parameter represents the mole fraction not bound at a certain site measured experimentally [96], was similar under pure aqueous systems, while dramatically different from 17% wt of PEG 6000 as co-solvents. Xpre, a parameter represents the mole fraction not bound at a certain site predicted by ePC-SAFR model, showed the similar results compared with Xexp. This work to some extent strengthens the importance of quantifying the interactions between substrates and co-solvents as well as providing a promising approach to high throughput screening the co-solvents for specific substrates."
8,Immobilization of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems,"4.2 Immobilization of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems The sensitivity of enzymes towards solvent composition or water percentages prompt the development of new techniques to mediate the damage from organic solvents on biocatalysts. Immobilization is a smart way to stabilize enzymes in organic-solvent systems. As the percentage of water molecules play a significant role in enzyme catalysis as discussed in above paragraph, immobilization materials, such as Superabsorbent polymer which holds a high capacity of water molecules, have been developed [100]. Recently, Groger et al. [101] applied this material to the co-immobilization of an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus sp. (RspADH) and its cofactor NAD. The water-absorbing characteristic of the material provided a micro-aqueous environment for RspADH in organic solvents. As hydrophilic organic co-solvents would extract water molecules from the superabsorbent polymers, they studied the substrate conversion rates given by different organic co-solvents with log P ranging from 0.7 to 4.5. Unsurprisingly, the hydrophobic organic co-solvent of isooctane with log P 4.5 gave the highest substrate (Fig. 8C-6) conversion rate at about 93%, 3 times higher than the conversion rate given by ethyl acetate with a log P of 0.7. Those results again suggest that enzyme activities can be regulated by manipulating the solvent composition in the reaction systems. Though immobilization methods of entrapment (Table 4 ) can regulate the micro-environment of the alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to some extent as shown in Groger et al.'s case, their specificity to the targeted enzymes are low, which may finally decrease its capacity. Immobilization materials of epoxy groups can specifically bind to targeted alcohol dehydrogenases based on its replaceable epoxy groups on the matrix (Fig. 9 ). In 2014, Paradisi et al. used metal-chelate-epoxy [102] supports to immobilize an alcohol dehydrogenase from Haloferax volcanii (HvADH). The metal on these supports increased the total capacity for the targeted enzyme due to its selective binding, such as His6 tag to Ni-NTA resin. After 72 h incubation in 30% DMSO or 30% MeOH, the remaining activities of immobilized HvADH were 17% and 19% higher than those of the free enzymes, respectively [103]. One year later, Truppo et al. applied hetero-functional amino-epoxy groups (Sepabeads EC-HFA) to immobilize ketoreductases in organic-aqueous systems [94]. In their research, different polymer-based resins (EC-EP, EC-HFA, EXE119, EXE120, and HP2MG) [104,105] were tested to immobilize ketoreductase P1B2 with EC-HFA being the best, giving the highest conversion rate of about 60%/h, reducing 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethanone to (R)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethanol [106]."
9,Conclusions and perspectives,"During the past decades, applications of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems have attracted great attention either for industrial use or for academic study, mainly due to their great potential in highly efficient chiral synthesis. In this review, we dig into structural characteristics of these enzymes in organic-aqueous systems, and summarized the techniques used to stabilize alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases or to increase the substrate solubility in organic solvents based on their structural analysis. Structurally, the balance between enzyme activities and stability in organic solvents can be attributed to three dominant reasons: protein hydrophobicity, oligomeric interactions and protein conformational dynamics. All of these three factors are closely correlated with the feature of solvent molecules. Solvent engineering is not only intended to increase the solubility of a compound, but also a strategy to change the enzyme features. Enzyme behaviors in organic-aqueous systems can be manipulated by the relative hydrophobicity of the solution and the enzyme itself too. Thus, the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic solvents in reaction systems matters. Besides, that ratio may also influence the conformational dynamics of the enzymes, which is believed to be another important reason for enzyme activity change since last decade. The quantitative relationships between substrates and co-solvents have been brought up very recently, though only being applied to polymers as co-solvents (ePC-SAFR approach). Thus, taking ePC-SAFR as an example to further study the quantitative relationships among various substrates and co-solvents, or even the quantitative relationships between water molecules and organic solvents in organic-aqueous systems, in future, strategies in screening organic solvents for a reaction system can be set up as a systematic process, which is promising due to the fast development of machine learning and data science [107]. Researchers will be able to virtually screen suitable organic solvents [108] towards substrates based on the characteristics of applied organic solvents and alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. Conversely, scientists can also do virtual screening for enzymes to adapt to a certain organic-aqueous system with a targeted substrate. Immobilization are widely used to stabilize enzymes in organic-aqueous systems as discussed in this review. However, as the slow development of the matrix and their high price, they cannot be easily applied to all the alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. In many cases, we have other ways to protect these enzymes in organic solvents, such as enzyme-mediated whole-cell systems. Recently, our group has successfully applied (S)‑carbonyl reductase II-mediated yeast spore-microencapsulation to sustainably synthesize (R)-phenylethanol in organic solvents with a yield of 70% and an optical purity of 99% [109]. This case reminds us that biotransformation mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases doesn't have to be limited to the enzymes themselves. The enzymes can be in immobilization materials, or whole cells, or even spores. What's more, the oligomeric interactions in stabilizing ADH-A′ in organic solvents strike on us that we can build up different oligomers for alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to enhance their stability in severe environments, e.g. organic solvents. Previously, our lab have created different oligomers for protein SCRII using sortase A, a short peptide, and successfully improved its catalytic performance by enhancing its quaternary structure in solutions [110]. Thus it is promising to apply these techniques to improve the catalytic efficiency of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases in organic-aqueous systems in future."
