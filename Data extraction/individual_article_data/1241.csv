0,Introduction,"Heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of organic compounds such as alkenes and alcohols in liquid phase has attracted much attention as a promising strategy for environmentally benign organic synthesis [1,2]. A wide variety of oxidants can be used for such reactions. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an ideal one because of its high content of active oxygen, availability, non-toxicity, and non-polluting property, i.e., it produces only water as a byproduct [3,4]. However, since H2O2 is generally supplied as an aqueous solution, the use of H2O2 is often a problem in cases in which substrates are immiscible in water. In such cases, addition of an amphiphilic solvent (co-solvent) and/or vigorous agitation of the reaction mixture to make an emulsion for achieving sufficient interaction of H2O2 with both catalyst(s) and substrate(s) are often required. We have proposed a new concept of a heterogeneous catalytic system for driving a reaction between a water-immiscible organic compound(s) and aqueous reagent(s) using a solid catalyst without a co-solvent or mechanical agitation [5–8]. For this system, we have prepared solid particles that could assemble at the liquid–liquid phase-boundary by partial modification of external surfaces with alkylsilyl groups. It was found that titanium oxide-loaded NaY zeolite and silica (SiO2) particles partially covered with alkylsilyl groups efficiently catalyzed epoxidation of terminal linear alkenes using aqueous H2O2 even without agitation. The reaction system is thus named ‘phase-boundary catalysis (PBC)’. We previously reported in detail phenomenological aspects of PBC for epoxidation of terminal linear alkenes [5,6], asymmetric surface structures of catalyst particles [7], and local structures of loaded titanium species [8]. Results of these studies lead to attempts to extend PBC to other organic reactions in order to obtain information on availability and limitations and to obtain mechanistic insights. In this paper, we describe the catalytic properties of a titanium oxide-loaded SiO2-based phase-boundary catalyst for oxidation of various hydrophobic alcohols using H2O2. We focus on oxidation of relatively bulky alcohols that are difficult to use for well-known titanium-containing microporous materials such as titanium silicalite, TS-1, and related materials [9–12] because of their limitations of pore size."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials A non-porous silica (Degussa Aerosil 200) was supplied from Nippon Aerosil and was used as a support. Titanium(IV) ethoxide (Ti(OEt)4, 95%) and n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODMS, 95%) were purchased from GELEST and were used without further purification. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, ca. 30%) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical. All other organic reagents were purified by standard procedures before use [13]."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Amphiphilic SiO2 particles loaded with titanium(IV) oxide particles were prepared according to a procedure reported previously [8]. Three grams of SiO2 was added to 150cm3 of 2-propanol solution containing 145mg of Ti(OEt)4 under a dry argon atmosphere. After the mixture was stirred for 3h at room temperature, the solid was collected by centrifugation, dried at 383K for 2h under vacuum, and calcined at 773K for 6h. The resulting powder is labeled w-Ti/SiO2. To 10cm3 of toluene containing 1mmol of ODMS, 0.5g of w-Ti/SiO2 thoroughly mixed with water (16.7wt.%) was added, and the suspension was shaken for 2min at room temperature. After the addition of triethylamine (1mmol), the suspension was further shaken for 10min at room temperature. Then the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 10cm3 of ethanol, and dried at 383K for 2h under vacuum. The thus-obtained white powder is labeled w/o-Ti/SiO2. By colorimetric analysis of the samples using 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron), the titanium content was determined to be 158μmol per 1g of catalyst."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was carried out using a Bruker 2000A TG-DTA instrument in air (flow rate: 100cm3 min−1). Typically, ca. 10mg of a sample was heated in a platinum crucible from room temperature to 1073K, using heating ramps of 5Kmin−1 up to 473K and 10Kmin−1 up to 1073K. BET surface area was measured at 77K using a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-1 automated gas sorption system after drying at 423K for 12h. The amount of titanium species leached after reaction was determined by using a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000-XL inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometer. The amounts of H2O2 before and after the reaction were determined by a standard titration method with 0.02moldm−3 of aqueous potassium permanganate (KMnO4, Wako)."
5,Oxidation of alcohols,"2.4 Oxidation of alcohols Typical procedures for oxidation of alcohols with aqueous H2O2 are as follows: to a cylindrical reaction vessel (2cm in diameter) with a reflux condenser, 8mmol of alcohol, 67mg of w/o-Ti/SiO2 (corresponding to 0.01mmol of titanium) and 3cm3 of toluene were successively added. After injection of 1.8cm3 of aqueous H2O2 to the mixture, reactions were performed for 16h without mechanical agitation. The reaction temperature was kept at 333K by the use of a thermostatted oil bath. When necessary, the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Amounts of products were determined using Shimadzu GC 2010 and GC-14B gas chromatographs equipped with flame ionization detectors and capillary columns of DB-5 and TC-FFAP, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural characteristics of modified particles,"3.1 Structural characteristics of modified particles Fig. 1 shows the TG and DTA curves of w-Ti/SiO2 and w/o-Ti/SiO2 samples measured in air in the temperature range of RT−1073K. The TG curve of w-Ti/SiO2 indicates a slight weight loss below 400K and no further weight loss up to 1073K. The weight loss is attributable to dehydration and desorption of water. On the other hand, w/o-Ti/SiO2 showed an additional large weight loss between ca. 500 and 773K in the TG curve. Since this weight loss was accompanied by a major exothermic event starting at ca. 500K in the DTA curve, it was ascribed to combustion of surface-grafted alkylsilyl groups on w/o-Ti/SiO2. Assuming that the remaining powder above 773K is composed of a mixture of SiO2 and a small amount of loaded titanium(IV) oxide, the amount of alkylsilyl groups on w/o-Ti/SiO2 was estimated to be 380μmol per unit weight of w/o-Ti/SiO2. From the reported cross section of an octadecylsilyl group (0.226nm2) [14], we calculate that ca. 1.4mmol of alkylsilyl groups can be attached to the surface of w/o-Ti/SiO2 having a surface area of 200m2. The maximum amount of alkylsilyl groups that can be attached to the w/o-Ti/SiO2 surface was also estimated using the density of surface hydroxyl groups of the SiO2 powders used (2.7 hydroxylsnm−2) [15]. Assuming that all of the alkylsilyl groups were attached through the reaction with surface hydroxyl, the maximum was estimated to be ca. 900μmol per unit weight of w/o-Ti/SiO2. Although there is a significant difference between these estimations, we can say qualitatively that more than half of the surface hydroxyl groups remained on each w/o-Ti/SiO2 particle. The presence of an appreciable amount of surface hydroxyl groups is also suggested by the weight loss below 400K due to desorption of H2O in the TG curve of w/o-Ti/SiO2 shown in Fig. 1(b). Such low coverage of alkylsilyl groups is thought to be due to the addition of a small amount of water just before grafting of a hydrophobic alkylsilylation agent. Since the hydrophilic w-Ti/SiO2 particles aggregated by capillary force of water and since the binding water between the particles prevents insertion of the agent into the aggregates, alkylsilyl groups can only be grafted on the outer parts of aggregates. Therefore, the surface of w/o-Ti/SiO2 was expected to be amphiphilic; one side of the surface of w/o-Ti/SiO2 was covered with alkylsilyl groups and the remainder retained its original hydrophilic surface. Indeed, through fluorescence microscopy of the modified NaY particles, the remaining surface hydroxyl groups of which were labeled with a fluorescence dye, we have confirmed the presence of both hydroxyl and alkylsilyl surfaces on each particle [7]. Upon addition of w-Ti/SiO2 samples to a dual-phase mixture of toluene and water, w-Ti/SiO2 was only dispersed in water due to its hydrophilic surface property. On the other hand, in the case of w/o-Ti/SiO2, most of the particles were assembled at the liquid–liquid phase-boundary. As reported previously [5–8,16], this is a phenomenological indication of amphiphilic character, having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces, of oxide particles. Based on these results and observations, w/o-Ti/SiO2 is thought to be assembled at the phase-boundary of the water–toluene dual-phase mixture by facing its hydrophobic octadecylsilylated side to the organic phase and its hydrophilic side to the aqueous phase. Further details of amphiphilic characters of particles prepared by the same procedure and their applications will be described elsewhere [17]."
8,Catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous H2O2,"3.2 Catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous H2O2 Table 1 summarizes catalytic properties of w-Ti/SiO2 and w/o-Ti/SiO2 for oxidation of benzyl alcohol under various conditions. Both w-Ti/SiO2 and w/o-Ti/SiO2 particles suspended and agitated in the dual-phase mixture of aqueous H2O2 and toluene containing benzyl alcohol gave benzaldehyde with production of other by-products, mainly benzoic acid (entries 1 and 2). When these particles were absent, much smaller amounts of products were obtained (entry 3), indicating that the reaction was induced by these catalysts. However, it was noted, especially for w-Ti/SiO2, that a large amount of loaded titanium was leached from the surface into the aqueous phase, as determined from the results of ICP analysis for the aqueous phase after the reaction. When aqueous H2O2 and benzyl alcohol were added to the aqueous phase that was corrected after the reaction of entry 1, upon stirring the mixture under the same reaction conditions, an appreciable amount of benzaldehyde was produced (entry 4). Thus, the observed liberation of benzaldehyde from the w-Ti/SiO2 suspension was mainly induced by such leached titanium species. Although the w/o-Ti/SiO2 suspension gave a ca. 1.5 times larger amount of benzaldehyde than did the w-Ti/SiO2 suspension and leaching of titanium was suppressed to some extent (entry 2), this may also include the influence of dissolved titanium species. On the other hand, when the reaction was performed under static conditions, i.e., PBC conditions, a relatively large amount of benzaldehyde was produced from the w/o-Ti/SiO2 suspension (entry 6). In this case, moreover, much less leaching was observed, while the w-Ti/SiO2 suspension showed the same behavior as that of the above agitation system; reaction by leached titanium might be predominant (entries 5 and 7). The remaining aqueous solution of w/o-Ti/SiO2 after the reaction under such static conditions did not give a detectable amount of benzaldehyde, as expected (entry 8). In addition, when the amount of catalyst was decreased to 3.4mg (corresponding to 0.5μmol of Ti), the turnover number (TON) of benzaldehyde based on Ti approached ca. 530 (entry 9). These results imply that, when the reaction was performed under PBC conditions, modification with alkylsilyl groups brought about sufficient stability of titanium active sites to leaching. Accordingly, it could be confirmed that the PBC using w/o-Ti/SiO2 was a heterogeneous catalytic system for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (see below)."
9,Catalytic properties for oxidation of various hydrophobic alcohols,"3.3 Catalytic properties for oxidation of various hydrophobic alcohols In order to examine the availability of the w/o-Ti/SiO2-based PBC, we oxidized various aromatic and cyclic alkyl alcohols using aqueous H2O2. The results are summarized in Table 2 . Primary benzylic alcohols were efficiently converted into corresponding aldehydes, and their reaction rates were slightly dependent on substituents (Cl, OCH3, and CH3) and on their positions (p-, m-, and o-) (entries 1–6). Similarly, secondary benzylic alcohols were also oxidized to corresponding ketones in relatively high selectivity (entries 7–8). On the other hand, poor selectivities for oxidation of allylic alcohols such as cinnamyl alcohol were obtained (entry 9), owing to the activity of loaded titanium sites for epoxidation [12,18–20]. The catalytic system could be utilized for oxidation of secondary cyclic alcohols such as cyclohexanol and cyclooctanol, which are relatively inactive toward oxidation, to corresponding ketones (entries 10–11). Oxidation of a series of aliphatic alcohols has been widely examined using microporous titanosilicalites such as TS-1 [9–11]. However, these bulky alcohols reported here were not employed as substrates in such titanium-based heterogeneous catalysts owing to the limitation of their pore sizes. Hence, although overall rates were not satisfactory, the present PBC system might enable a titanium-based catalyst to be used for oxidation of various bulky alcohols."
10,Role of alkylsilyl groups,"3.4 Role of alkylsilyl groups As previously investigated using Ti K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure (XANES) analysis [8], the loaded titanium species on w/o-Ti/SiO2 were mainly those with tetrahedral coordination (Ttet) with a small content of octahedrally coordinated ones (Toct). The former was attributable to the isolated titanium and the latter included titanium dimers, oligomers, and/or bulk (TiO2)-like microclusters [21–24]. The efficiency of H2O2 utilized for the reaction measured in some selected samples was estimated to be below 20% (data not shown). This suggests unproductive decomposition (or auto-decomposition) of H2O2 on these Toct sites under a large excess of H2O2 [8]; thereby, the active species might be ascribed to Ttet. It has also been clarified in our previous study using ultraviolet and visible-light diffuse reflectance (UV–vis-DR) spectroscopy in relation to catalytic activity [8] that there are three types of Ttet on w/o-Ti/SiO2. These are Ttet anchoring an acidic hydroxyl (Ttet(OH)) located on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces (w-Ttet(OH) and o-Ttet(OH)) and Ttet directly attached to an alkylsilyl group (Ttet(OSiR)). The latter was formed via reaction of an acidic hydroxyl of Ttet(OH) with an alkylsilane agent on the hydrophobic surface. Schematic structures of these titanium sites are shown in Fig. 2 . The results of oxidation of benzyl alcohol summarized in Table 1 suggest that w-Ttet(OH) sites do not contribute to the heterogeneous catalytic property of w/o-Ti/SiO2 because these must be present on w-Ti/SiO2 as sole Ttet sites. As described above, Ttet sites were not stable under the present reaction conditions, i.e., oxidation proceeded by mainly leached titanium species (Table 1, entries 4 and 7). Thus, two probable species located on the hydrophobic surface of w/o-Ti/SiO2, o-Ttet(OH) and Ttet(OSiR), might induce heterogeneous catalytic activity, though it is not clear at present that whether only one of them is active or whether both are active. According to these speculations, surface-grafted alkylsilyl groups were considered to give particles two beneficial effects for the use of a heterogeneous catalyst. One is to give hydrophobicity of Ttet sites, inducing effective contact with hydrophobic alcohols, and the other is to prevent leaching by covering with siloxane networks of alkylsilylation agents."
11,Conclusions,"Amphiphilic SiO2 particles loaded with titanium(IV) oxide species acted as a catalyst for the oxidation of benzylic and cyclic alkyl alcohols using aqueous H2O2 under static conditions, i.e., phase-boundary catalytic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of oxidation of bulky hydrophobic alcohols using aqueous H2O2 over a heterogeneous titanium catalyst. Such catalytic functions were probably realized by effective contact of catalyst particles with H2O2 and hydrophobic alcohols, respectively, as well as by the effect of stabilization of active titanium sites by surface-grafted alkylsilyl groups. The results should provide useful information for an alternative strategy to design catalytic materials."
