0,Introduction,"CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases that has been a global concern over the past few years. Various Carbon Dioxide Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies and strategies have been intensively researched and implemented to reduce the level of CO2 [1–5]. Methanol synthesis as a value-added product from CO2 hydrogenation emerges as an interesting strategy as a part of carbon dioxide utilization. CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction is an exothermic reaction and is usually carried out in temperature between 200 and 300 °C and high pressure of 5–10 MPa [6–8]. Methanol, as the main product, has been growing in demand over the past decade because of its wide applications [6,7,9]. Thus, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is an attractive process to pursue as it additionally provides solutions to an environmental problem, which is to reduce the level of greenhouse gases. Despite the benefits of methanol production, the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation process has few challenges such as CO2 activation, selectivity towards methanol, and catalyst stability [6,10]. CO2 is a very stable molecule; therefore, high energy is required to activate the gaseous CO2 molecule. It is not that straightforward to just increase the reaction temperature to activate CO2 since CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is an exothermic reaction. Besides, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) also occurs as the side reaction at the reaction condition especially in high temperature because of the thermodynamic property of the side reaction. Therefore, an active and selective catalyst towards CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is required to optimize the production of methanol selectively. Copper as the active metal to convert CO2 to methanol has been intensively studied for the past few decades [11,12]. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is generally used in industrial application with ZnO as a promoter and Al2O3 as a support in low-temperature reaction (200−240 °C) [11,13–16], while In2O3-based catalyst and ZnOxZrO2-based catalyst are being developed for higher temperature reaction (>300 °C) [16]. However, CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity achieved by this mixed oxides catalyst are not remarkably exceptional and still have room to improve. Besides that, Cu is easily deactivated, which is a major concern for industrial purpose [17–19]. Many attempts have been done to enhance catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol such as active metal substitution [16,20–24], promotor addition [25–30], and support substitution [17,31–34]. Besides that, some researchers have also studied different catalyst structure such as perovskite [35–38], LDH [39–42], and core-shell like structural materials [43–46]. Perovskite structure as an alternative structure is attractive due to its high oxygen mobility that may increase the CO2 activation at mild experimental conditions, which in turn helps methanol selectivity [47–49]. The perovskite structured catalysts have been studied for various reforming reactions [35,47], [50–56]. For example, partial Fe substitution over Ni at B-site in LaNiO3 (ABO3) catalyst gives better activity and stability for tar steam reforming reaction [51]. Enhanced performance of toluene steam reforming is observed by Sr modification at B-site for NiLaO3 catalyst [56]. In other work, Cu addition to La(Co,Cu)O3 perovskite shifts the selectivity towards higher alcohol production [35]. Though the Cu-containing perovskite materials were reported for various reforming applications, there are limited works were reported for CO2 hydrogenation towards methanol. Recently, the LaCuO δ catalyst has been tested for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [57]. There are some potentials to increase perovskite Cu-based catalyst performance towards methanol. Sr2+ is reported to increase the oxidation state in hexane oxidation, resulting in better activity [53]. The substitution of Sr over La on the A-site perovskite is expected to enhance catalyst performance. The present study will be focused on investigating the Sr doping effect on the LaCuO3- δ catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Thus, in this study, the catalysts with different Sr concentrations were prepared using the citric acid complexation method and investigated for their catalytic performances for CO2 hydrogenation activity with respect to CO2 conversion, methanol selectivity, and stability. Besides, the role of Sr-doping is investigated by correlating the catalytic performances with the calcined, reduced, and spent catalysts characterizations. Finally, a carbonate-assisted reaction pathway was illustrated for selective CO2 hydrogenation reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Perovskite catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Perovskite catalyst synthesis Perovskite catalysts were synthesized by a sol-gel process with citric acid as the gelling agent. The precursor solutions used to synthesize the perovskite catalysts are La(NO3)3.6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), Sr(NO3)2. (Sigma-Aldrich), and Cu(NO3)2.3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich). An equimolar amount of precursor and citric acid were added to deionized water to vary the amount of Sr substitution on La. The solution was then stirred at 80 ºC until a gel-like solution was formed. The gel-like solution then dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight. The powder from the drying process was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h and continued to 800 °C for 2 h. After calcination, perovskite powder was grounded with particle size < 125 μm. The catalysts synthesized were labeled as La1-xSrxCuO, where x represents the molar ratio. Five different catalysts were synthesized with different x values at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 1 and are named LaCuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, La0.6Sr0.4CuO, and SrCuO respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for calcined, reduced, and spent La1-xSrxCuO catalyst were investigated using Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (40 kV and 30 mA) as the radiation source and scanning range between 20° and 80°. The surface area of calcined perovskite catalyst was analyzed by Micrometrics ASAP 2020 analyzer using nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed on reduced (300 °C for 1 h). The XPS analysis was done on Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD with Al Kα (hυ = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2/O2-temperature-programmed desorption (CO2/O2-TPD), and N2O pulse chemisorption were done using Thermo Scientific TPDRO 1100 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 100 mg catalysts were used for H2-TPR and CO2/O2-TPD, while 50 mg catalysts were used for N2O pulse chemisorption. H2-TPR was performed in a glass chamber with a 5% H2/N2 mixture at 30 mL/min and a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 1000 °C. For CO2/O2-TPD, catalysts were reduced at 300 °C for 1 h prior to CO2 and O2 adsorption at 50 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The TPD analysis was performed in a He flow at 30 mL/min up to 1000 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. For N2O titration, 50 mg calcined catalysts were placed in a glass chamber. Subsequently, catalysts were reduced at 300 °C for 1 h prior to the N2O titration at 80 °C. Next, H2 was reintroduced at 300 °C for 1 h. The Cu metal surface area was calculated by the H2 consumed. The formation of carbonate species during hydrogenation reaction was analyzed using HORIBA Xplora Plus using a laser beam excitation of λ = 632.81 nm. To further determine the nature of the spent catalyst, thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) was conducted using a Shimadzu DTG-60 analyzer. Spent catalyst of about 6 mg weight was put on an alumina pan located on an electronic balance with a thermocouple installed. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed at the XAFCA beamline of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source for spent catalysts. Fixed weight of spent catalysts were mixed with boron nitrate and pressed into pellets prior to XAS scanning. The Athena software was used to analyze the XAS data. The detailed characterizations procedure is provided in the supplementary data of this manuscript."
4,Catalyst performance test,"2.3 Catalyst performance test Catalyst performance tests were done in a multi-channel fixed bed stainless steel reactor (I.D. 6 mm; length 30 cm). Each reactor was covered by a furnace connected to a temperature controller. The multi-channel reactors outlet are connected to GC and fume hood. A controller was used to choose the reactor outlet desired to be connected to GC. The reactors outlet connected to GC was covered with a heating coil to prevent liquid product condensation. Each performance test used 200 mg fresh catalyst. To support the catalyst, quartz wool was used to maintain the catalyst bed. Hydrogen gas (10 mL min−1) was flowed into the reactor to reduce the catalyst for one hour with different temperatures for different experiments at 250, 300, and 350 °C. After one hour, hydrogen gas flow was shut off and mixture gas of H2, CO2, and N2 with a ratio of 70.95, 24.82, and 4.23 respectively was flowed at 50 mL min−1. There is no need to purge the reactors with pure N2 as hydrogen is part of the mixture gas. However, the reactors were allowed to stabilize for 10 min to make sure the gas ratio inside the reactors is the same as the mixture gas. Subsequently, the reactors pressure was increased to 3.0 MPa. After the pressure reached 3.0 MPa, the system was left to stabilize for one hour. The catalyst performance test was done at three different temperatures at 250, 275, and 300 °C. Finally, gas products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) with FID and TCD detectors. The packing used was a capillary column (Shimadzu Sh-RTX-1). FID and TCD detectors gave two different chromatograms. FID detector was used for detecting methanol; while TCD detector was used for detecting H2, N2, CO, and CO2. Each peak area was calculated using a computer software connected to GC. Product peak area was compared to feed peak area that was analyzed previously. Based on the peak area difference, conversion and selectivity can be determined. CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity are calculated using the following equation: (1) X C O 2 = 1 - n C O 2 , o u t n C O 2 , i n (2) S M e O H = 1 - n C O , o u t n C O 2 , i n - n C O 2 , o u t"
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD of calcined and reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.1 XRD of calcined and reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD profiles for calcined La1-xSrxCuO catalysts synthesized using the sol-gel method. The patterns show diffractions corresponding to the presence of orthorhombic (A2BO4) and tetragonal (ABO3) perovskite phases, and CuO phase. It is also observed that the nature of perovskite structure is influenced by replacing La with Sr of La1-xSrxCuO materials [58]. The La1.0CuO catalyst has diffractions corresponding to the orthorhombic perovskite (A2BO4) structure. This orthorhombic A2BO4 perovskite structure changes to tetragonal ABO3 perovskite structure upon Sr substitution to A-site of La1-xSrxCuO materials. In all Sr-containing materials, tetragonal ABO3 perovskite structure is observed beside the orthorhombic A2BO4 perovskite structure. Tetragonal ABO3 diffraction peaks become more dominant compared to orthorhombic A2BO4 diffraction peaks as the Sr amount increases. However, the Sr1.0CuO catalyst shows a different profile compared to the La-containing perovskite catalyst. Besides the perovskite structure observed in calcined La1-xSrxCuO catalysts, the CuO phase is also observed. The formation of CuO is due to the formation of A2BO4 perovskite structure while the solution used was in an equimolar state [58,59]. Since La1.0CuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, and La0.6Sr0.4CuO show the orthorhombic A2BO4 perovskite structure, excess CuO is expected in the calcined catalysts. The XRD patterns of La1-xSrxCuO catalysts reduced at 300 °C are presented in Fig. 1B. It can be seen in the figure that the absence of diffractions corresponding to any kind of perovskite structure indicating the decomposition of the structure during reductive treatment. The La1.0CuO catalyst displays a mixed profile of metallic Cu, Cu2O, and La2O3, while La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, and La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalysts show an additional profile of SrO because of the Sr substitution. The characteristic of reduced Sr1.0CuO catalyst shows a completely different profile compared to other catalysts. It suggests that reduced Sr1.0CuO catalyst creates a mixed Sr-Cu oxide phase."
7,BET surface area for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.2 BET surface area for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts BET results for La1.0CuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, La0.6Sr0.4CuO, and Sr1.0CuO catalysts are 1.6, 2.0, 3.4, 4.2, and 2.6 m2/g respectively. These low surface areas are to be expected from a perovskite-type structure. The surface area increases from La1.0CuO to La0.6Sr0.4CuO from 1.6 m2/g which is the lowest surface area to 4.2 m2/g, which is the highest among other catalysts. Perovskite structural change from orthorhombic A2BO4 to tetragonal ABO3 by Sr addition, which was shown in XRD profiles as in Fig. 1, could contribute to the increase of BET surface area."
8,XPS for reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.3 XPS for reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts XPS analysis was performed for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts reduced at 300 °C to investigate oxygen lattice species in the catalysts after reductive treatment. O 1s binding energies (BE) of the reduced La1-xSrxCuO are presented in Fig. 2 A and the summary of peak deconvolutions are presented in Table 1 . It can be observed in Fig. 2A that all reduced catalysts except Sr1.0CuO have three BE peaks at 533.20 ± 0.2 eV, 531.50 ± 0.2 eV, and 529.90 ± 0.2 eV, which are respectively assigned to the O from water (Ow), O adsorbed (OAds) and O lattice (OL) species [50,51]. The O 1s BE curves of the Sr1.0CuO catalyst shows an absence of OL species. The absence of OL in Sr1.0CuO is possibly due to the absence of any kind of perovskite structure, which was observed from XRD analysis. Furthermore, the BE values of all the reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It shows the amount of OL species were calculated to be 8.98%, 11.99%, 10.58%, 2.92%, and 0% respectively for La1.0CuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, La0.6Sr0.4CuO, and Sr1.0CuO catalysts. It is interesting to see that a little Sr substitution in La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO significantly increases the amount of OL species. However, further addition of Sr to La0.6Sr0.4CuO and Sr1.0CuO leads to a decrease in the amount of lattice oxygens. Moreover, the oxygen mobility of a catalyst is highly influenced by the amount of lattice oxygen species. And higher oxygen mobility is preferred in methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation reaction [60]. The role of oxygen mobility in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over La1-xSrxCuO catalysts will be explained further in CO2-TPD and FTIR analysis. Besides the O 1s spectrum, the Cu 2p spectrum for reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts was analyzed and the spectrum is presented in Fig. 2B. It has been reported by others that there are two major peaks and a satellite peak in the Cu 2p3/2 spectrum [31,57]. The first major peak is at BE 932.6 eV which belongs to Cu0 and Cu+ and the other peak at BE 934.5 eV belongs to CuO. In the reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts Cu 2p XPS profile, Cu0 and Cu+ are difficult to distinguish from XPS peak since both peaks are overlapping. Cu+ has weak satellite peaks at around BE 944.0 eV; however, CuO also has strong satellite peaks at the same BE. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish Cu0 and Cu+ in La1-xSrxCuO catalysts. The amount of Cu0 and Cu+ can be distinguished by XAS analysis and will be explained further in the XAS analysis section. The clear difference from reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts in Fig. 2B is the CuO peak at 934.5 eV. La1.0CuO and La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalysts exhibit stronger CuO peak compared to La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO, and Sr1.0CuO. This result suggests that La1.0CuO and La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalysts still have copper oxide state after reduction. Besides that, it can also be concluded that La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO have a more active Cu state (Cu0 and Cu+) for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol under the reduction condition compared to La1.0CuO and La0.6Sr0.4CuO. The higher reducibility of La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO will be explained further in the H2-TPR results."
9,O2-TPD profiles for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.4 O2-TPD profiles for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts The oxygen mobility nature of the reduced catalysts was further confirmed by O2-TPD experiments. The oxygen desorption profiles for reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 A. It is to be noticed that there are two major O2 desorption peaks. The first desorption peak at 500 °C might belong to oxygen desorbed from lanthanum, while the second desorption peak at 900 °C corresponds to oxygen desorbed from strontium [52]. This theory is strongly suggested by the desorption profile of La1.0CuO and Sr1.0CuO. In the La1.0CuO profile, the peak at around 900 °C was not observed since no Sr incorporation was in the catalyst. While in the Sr1.0CuO profile, the peak at around 500 °C was not observed because there are no La species present in the catalyst. In the La0.6Sr0.4CuO desorption profile, no oxygen desorbed from strontium. Oxygen will prefer to be absorbed to the lanthanum because it requires a considerably lower energy compared to strontium due to the lower desorption temperature. Besides, the low amount of oxygen lattice in the La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalyst may have not saturated the lanthanum species. The decrease in oxygen desorbed from La0.9Sr0.1CuO to La0.8Sr0.2CuO to La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalysts despite the increase in the strontium content well supported the idea that oxygen prefers to be absorbed to the lanthanum. The peak area at around 500 °C for La0.9Sr0.1CuO seems to be the highest compared to other catalysts. This result suggests a higher oxygen mobility in the lanthanum species for the La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalyst which is well supported by O 1s BE’s as discussed in the previous section. The role of the higher oxygen mobility in CO2 hydrogenation will be explained more in CO2-TPD in the next section."
10,CO2-TPD profiles for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.5 CO2-TPD profiles for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts The surface basicity of reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts was analyzed by performing CO2 TPD experiments. Fig. 3B shows the CO2 desorption profile of the reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts. Fig. 3B shows two major desorption peaks, the first peak is at 500 °C and the second peak is at 900 °C which respectively belong to lanthanum carbonate and strontium carbonate species. In Fig. 3A, the La1.0CuO has only one major peak at 500 °C. The amount of lanthanum carbonate of reduced La1-xSrxCuO catalysts follows the trend of Sr1.0CuO < La0.6Sr0.4CuO < La1.0CuO < La0.8Sr0.2CuO < La0.9Sr0.1CuO. The same trend of lanthanum carbonate amount and O2 lattice from O 1s XPS spectrum was also observed by the similar profile of CO2 TPD and O2 TPD experiments respectively. The same trend with O2 lattice may suggest that high oxygen mobility helps to form lanthanum carbonate species. This theory follows Liu, et al. [61] work where it is observed that CO2 can adsorb on lattice oxygen site and form bidentate carbonate species. It is well known in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol that high surface basicity helps the reaction to be more selective towards methanol [30,33,62]. It also has been reported that the La-Cu interface helps in methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation [26]. As explained in the previous paragraph, La0.9Sr0.1CuO showed the highest lanthanum carbonate species. This lanthanum carbonate species may help to create more formate species. By having more formate species, methanol formation will be more preferred. Besides lanthanum carbonate species, strontium carbonate species was also present because of Sr incorporation at the A-site of the perovskite structure. Sr addition usually increases the surface basicity. The peak between 800 and 1000 °C in Fig. 3B showed the strontium carbonate species displayed by Sr1.0CuO desorption peak. The similarity of O2 and CO2 desorption profiles suggests that oxygen lattice strongly affects carbonate species formation. The preference of carbonate formation towards lanthanum carbonate species may be subjected to the lower temperature required to form lanthanum carbonate species as explained in O2-TPD section. Both lanthanum carbonate and strontium carbonate species contribute to the basic center of catalysts; however, only lanthanum carbonate helps methanol synthesis from CO2. Guo, et al. reported that La-Cu interface further improved catalyst performance compared to Cu-support interaction only [26]. Higher surface basicity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has also been reported to increase the selectivity towards methanol [30,63,64]. By having higher surface basicity, the formate route in methanol formation will be more preferred."
11,H2-TPR analysis for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.6 H2-TPR analysis for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts H2-TPR was carried out to investigate La1-xSrxCuO catalysts reducibility. Fig. 4 shows the H2 consumption profile for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts. CuO reduction happens around 250–400 °C; however, complete reduction of perovskite structure also happens, which can be seen in reduced catalyst’s XRD profile. As a result of these two reductions, complex H2-TPR profiles are to be expected. La1-xSrxCuO catalysts excluding Sr1.0CuO catalyst TPR profiles showed multiple reduction peaks due to the two reductions. Since Sr1.0CuO showed a completely different structure compared to other catalysts from calcined XRD profiles, Sr1.0CuO may show a different reduction besides Cu reduction. It can be observed in Fig. 4 that H2-TPR peaks show similar profiles with oxygen mobility where La0.9Sr0.1CuO has the lowest reduction temperature. La1.0CuO’s H2 consumption peaks are at 360 °C to 420 °C, whereas La0.9Sr0.1CuO’s H2 consumption peaks are at 200 °C–350 °C. The peaks for La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, and La0.6Sr0.4CuO catalysts are significantly shifted to lower temperature compared to La1.0CuO. This shift to lower temperature may be correlated to each catalyst’s oxygen mobility behavior. Higher oxygen mobility means more H2 is attracted and adsorbed. Therefore, the energy required for the reductions is lesser for catalyst with higher oxygen mobility. As discussed in the previous section, oxygen mobility of La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO are higher than La1.0CuO catalyst. This lower H2 consumption temperature follows the higher oxygen mobility discussed previously. The same trend of oxygen mobility and H2 consumption profiles may explain higher oxygen mobility increase the reducibility of catalyst."
12,N2O pulse for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts,"3.7 N2O pulse for La1-xSrxCuO catalysts N2O pulse was done to calculate Cu surface metal area which are the active sites of a catalyst. Cu surface area calculated from N2O pulse analysis for La1.0CuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, La0.6Sr0.4CuO, and Sr1.0CuO catalysts were 0.67, 1.15, 1.02, 0.53, and 0.23 m2/g respectively. Perovskite structure generally has a low surface area which was shown in BET results. Therefore, a low Cu surface area compared to the traditional metal on support catalyst was to be expected. The highest copper surface area of 1.15 m2/g was achieved on La0.9Sr0.1CuO. It is significantly higher compared to the La1.0CuO catalyst which had a Cu surface area of 0.67 m2/g. This increase in copper surface area can be correlated to the enhanced reducibility of the material."
13,In-situ DRIFTS analysis of reduced catalysts,"3.8 In-situ DRIFTS analysis of reduced catalysts From previous sections, it was clear that higher oxygen mobility in the catalysts contributes to higher surface basicity and higher reducibility. Two different in-situ DRIFTS analyses were performed to investigate the dominant role of the oxygen mobility. The in-situ CO-DRIFTS analysis was done to investigate the Cu+ species and carbonate species formed in the reduced catalyst, while the in-situ reaction mix gas (CO2 + H2) adsorption DRIFTS analysis was carried out to investigate the carbonate species formed from the reaction mix gas. The in-situ CO-DRIFTS spectra for reduced La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO are presented in Fig. 5 (a) and (b) respectively. The figure shows similar adsorption spectra for La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalysts. The CO gas can be observed by the mirrored peak at wavenumber 2100 nm−1 and 2150 nm−1. At 2050 nm−1, a shoulder peak can be observed for both La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO FT-IR profiles. This peak can be assigned to CO adsorbed on Cu+ species. From both profiles, the shoulder peak at 2050 nm−1 was rather similar in intensity. This similarity indicates that La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO have similar active sites in terms of Cu+ species. The difference between these two profiles can be seen at the intensity of the peaks from 1250 nm−1 to 1600 nm−1. These peaks correspond to carbonate species which correlates to surface basicity. La0.9Sr0.1CuO showed significantly higher intensity of carbonate bands compared to La1.0CuO catalyst. Higher surface basicity, as discussed in previous sections, may promote formate species formation through carbonate hydrogenation. Formate species formation recently has been generally accepted as the main pathway for methanol synthesis for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [64–67]. This formate species is hydrogenated into dioxomethylene, methoxy, and the final product methanol. Furthermore, formate hydrogenation in the formate route has been reported to be the rate-determining step [37,68]. Thus, carbonate hydrogenation into formate species may increase the rate of formate hydrogenation in the formate intermediate pathway for methanol synthesis. Besides methanol synthesis, formate species formation further contributes towards CO formation through an associative mechanism [69,70]. Higher methanol selectivity from formate hydrogenation is then affected by the higher surface basicity due to the higher basicity of methanol compared to CO. Furthermore, the role of formate species towards methanol and CO production may suppress the formation of CH4 in all catalysts. Trace amount of CH4 product in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction supports the formate species formation. To further support the carbonate species formation during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, reaction mix gas (CO2 + H2) adsorption DRIFTS was done at 0.5 MPa pressure. Reaction mix gas adsorption DRIFTS spectra for La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO are presented in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. The peak at wavenumber 1200 nm−1 to 1800 nm−1 can be de-convoluted into 3 peaks at 1587 nm−1, 1440 nm−1, and 1325 nm−1, which are belonging to asymmetric CO3, bicarbonate species (HCO3-), and symmetric CO3 species [71]. This carbonate species may belong to lanthanum carbonate species confirmed from CO2-TPD investigation. Higher lanthanum carbonate species in La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalyst will promote the formation of formate species through carbonate hydrogenation, thus increasing the methanol formation rate (Fig. 7 ). In addition, the total peak area from 1200 nm−1 to 1800 nm−1 is higher for La0.9Sr0.1CuO compared to La1.0CuO catalyst (Fig. 6). This result shows that carbonate species was formed under reaction feed gas (CO2 + H2) condition. Finally, from in situ DRIFTS experiments, the amount of surface Cu+ species is similar for both La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalysts. However, reaction mix gas DRIFTS results clearly showed that La0.9Sr0.1CuO has higher surface basicity compared to La1.0CuO. Therefore, it can be concluded that oxygen mobility in La1-xSrxCuO perovskite catalyst contributes more to increase the surface basicity to increase methanol formation rather than to increase catalyst active sites."
14,Catalysts performance,"3.9 Catalysts performance CO2 hydrogenation to methanol performance test for perovskite materials was carried out in a fixed bed reactor and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 8 . The product analysis showed that methanol and CO are the main carbon-based products and CH4 as trace (<1%) carbon-based product. La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalyst showed higher CO2 conversion (>70% higher) and selectivity (>5% higher) compared to La1.0CuO catalyst at all the reaction temperatures. Furthermore, catalysts’ CO2 conversion and selectivity shown in Fig. 8(b) follow the trend of Sr1.0CuO < La0.6Sr0.4CuO < La1.0CuO < La0.8Sr0.2CuO < La0.9Sr0.1CuO. This trend is the same trend with the catalysts oxygen mobility where La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La0.8Sr0.2CuO have higher oxygen mobility compared to La1.0CuO. It was discussed previously from CO2-TPD that surface basicity also followed the same trend with oxygen mobility which supported the idea that higher oxygen mobility leads to higher surface basicity from carbonate species. Catalysts performance test result confirmed the role of the oxygen mobility to increase carbonate formation which aids the formation of formate species as discussed in the DRIFTS study for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Different reduction temperatures were carried out to further study La1-xSrxCuO catalysts’ performance. Different reduction temperatures at 250 °C, 300 °C, and 350 °C of La1-xSrxCuO catalysts are presented on Fig. 8(a), (b), and (c) respectively. Different reduction temperatures were investigated because copper NP is easily agglomerated with a slightly higher reduction temperature. Methanol selectivity at lower hydrogenation temperature should be higher due to its exothermic nature. However, it can be seen in Fig. 8(a) that methanol selectivity at 250 °C was lower than 275 °C. From H2-TPR discussed previously, the reduction temperature of perovskite structure for all La1-xSrxCuO catalysts was observed higher than 250 °C. Therefore, incomplete reduction of the catalysts happened at a reduction temperature of 250 °C. The incomplete reduction at 250 °C might be the reason why the perovskite catalyst showed lower methanol selectivity at a lower reaction temperature. Higher catalysts performance in Fig. 8(b) with higher reduction temperature at 300 °C supports the complete reduction of the perovskite catalysts. However, Fig. 8(c) shows a slight decrease in methanol selectivity for all La1-xSrxCuO catalysts when the reduction temperature was increased to 350 °C. The nature of Cu to be easily agglomerated at high temperature may be the reason for the slight decrease in the catalyst performance. Besides different reduction temperatures, different GHSVs were investigated for the highest performing catalyst La0.9Sr0.1CuO and reference catalyst La1.0CuO. La1.0CuO catalyst performance at different GHSV is presented in Fig. 9 (a) while La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalyst is presented in Fig. 9(b). From Fig. 9, it can be concluded that GHSV increase from 8.6 L.gcat−1. h−1 to 15 L.gcat−1. h−1 reduced methanol selectivity very slightly and CO2 conversion considerably at a reaction temperature of 300 °C. La0.9Sr0.1CuO catalyst showed a CO2 conversion decrease at 300 °C from 9.18% to 7.23% while La1.0CuO showed a decrease at 300 °C from 5.43% to 3.48%. These performance decline in both catalysts are to be expected as GHSV increased while other operating condition stayed the same."
15,Catalysts stability,"3.10 Catalysts stability Best performing catalyst La0.9Sr0.1CuO and reference catalyst La1.0CuO were further investigated for their stability. Fig. 10 (a) shows stability tests result for both catalysts which were carried out at reduction temperature at 300 °C/1 h, T = 300 °C, P = 3.0 MPa, and GHSV = 10 L.gcat−1. h−1 for 18 h. La0.9Sr0.1CuO and La1.0CuO demonstrated a slight decrease in CO2 conversion from 8.71% to 7.46% and 4.81% to 4.00% respectively and stable methanol selectivity. To investigate carbon formation in the catalyst, DT/TG analysis was performed. DT and TG profiles are presented in Fig. 10(b). DT/TG analysis for both catalysts exhibited the same tendency. DT/TG profiles can be separated into two stages, the first one which is an exothermic weight gain between 180 and 400 °C and the second one which is an endothermic weight loss between 400 and 900 °C. The exothermic weight gain from 180 to 400 °C is due to the oxidation of Cu species to its oxide species. Weight gain percentages for La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO are 4.32% and 4.42% respectively. The amount of weight gain for both catalysts is similar indicating the similar amount of copper oxidized. A long reaction time of 18 h may further reduce CuO species in La1.0CuO. Thus, both catalysts were fully reduced and had a similar amount of reduced Cu species. The weight loss observed for both catalysts from 400 to 900 °C does not contain any exothermic peak; therefore, the endothermic weight loss for both catalysts was due to CO2 desorption. La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO weight loss percentages were 9.44% and 10.42% respectively. Higher weight loss of La0.9Sr0.1CuO compared to La1.0CuO indicates that La0.9Sr0.1CuO adsorbed more CO2 compared to La1.0CuO. The higher weight loss percentage in La0.9Sr0.1CuO is to be expected because La0.9Sr0.1CuO exhibited higher CO2 conversion and selectivity compared to La1.0CuO."
16,XANES and EXAFS of spent catalysts,"3.11 XANES and EXAFS of spent catalysts The chemical structure and coordination geometry of copper can be obtained from the XANES and EXAFS analysis. Herein, the XANES and EXAFS analysis of spent catalysts were performed to find the final state of Cu and correlate it with the catalyst performance. The energy profile of all the standards (Cu-foil, CuO, Cu2O) and spent catalysts La1.0CuO, La0.9Sr0.1CuO, La0.8Sr0.2CuO, La0.6Sr0.4CuO, and Sr1.0CuO are shown in Fig. 11 (b). The pre-edge energy of Cu is located at around 8982 eV, Cu+ at ∼8984 eV and Cu2+ at ∼ 8985 eV with a tail of low intensity. The quantitative fraction distribution of the different phases are also indicated in Table 2 . The La1.0CuO contains 65% Cu° followed by Cu2+ and the least amount of Cu+. For sample Sr1.0CuO containing only Sr and Cu, the majority of copper is present in Cu2+ oxidation state (95%) with the absence of Cu°. Further, by adding small fraction of (10%) Sr in the A-site to replace La, the La0.9Sr0.1CuO samples contains again higher percentage of Cu° (84.7%) followed by Cu2+ (13.7%) and small fraction of Cu+ (1.7%). These results indicate that by doping a small fraction of Sr (10%) to the A-site, an amount of highly active site Cu° is increased correlating with the higher performance of La0.9Sr0.1CuO as compared to that of La1.0CuO. With increase Sr content to (20%) in A-site, La0.8Sr0.2CuO sample contains Cu° (81.1%) with increased in the Cu+ content 2.9% and also increase in Cu2+. However, with higher Sr content of (40%) in La0.6Sr0.4CuO sample, the majority of copper is present in Cu2+ (65%) and lower amount of Cu° among all other samples. The results obtained from linear combination fitting of the energy profile of spent catalysts synchronizes well with the XPS results of reduced catalysts which also showed the similar trend related to the distribution of Cu°, Cu+ and Cu2+ phases in all the catalysts. The EXAFS fitting was performed on all the spent catalysts samples with the two main peaks for Cu-O bond (1st shell) and Cu-Cu (2nd shell). The Cu-foil was used as reference for the fitting which showed the Cu-Cu coordination number of 12 and bond length RCu-Cu =2.54 Å. The parameters obtained from the fitting results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen from Table 2 that the coordination number for the Cu-Cu bond increased after doping Sr in A-site for La0.9Sr0.1CuO sample with similar coordination number also observed by La0.8Sr0.2CuO. The coordination number further decreased to 4.71 after adding 40% Sr while that of Cu-O increased significantly. The presence of more Cu-O bond in this sample as compared to other samples which was also confirmed from the compositional analysis (LCF fitting). The Sr1.0CuO system showed exceptional case where there are only oxide phase present even in the spent catalysts, indicating the difficulty in reducing the copper in the SrO-CuO mixed oxide structure which was also evident from XRD of fresh and reduced."
17,Conclusion,"In conclusion, La1-xSrxCuO perovskite catalysts with a catalyst composition of La0.9Sr0.1CuO exhibited the highest performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol compared to other catalysts. With the exception of Sr1.0CuO catalysts, the formation of perovskite structures in all the calcined materials was confirmed from XRD analysis. Furthermore, the shift in perovskite structure from orthorhombic to tetragonal with Sr substitution to perovskite A-site is also observed. Sr substitution was also confirmed to increase oxygen mobility in reduced catalyst from O2-TPD and O 1s XPS spectrum. Subsequently, higher oxygen mobility leads to higher surface basicity and reducibility which was shown in CO2-TPD and H2-TPR experiments. FT-IR was also performed to further strengthen the idea that carbonate species which increase the surface basicity were formed in reaction gas condition and help to increase methanol production. Besides the role of oxygen mobility, catalysts’ stability was investigated for the reference and the highest performing catalysts which are La1.0CuO and La0.9Sr0.1CuO respectively. Both catalysts were relatively stable with no carbon formation based on DT/TG analysis. EXAFS and XANES fitting were in line with XPS results, thus it further supports the Cu oxidation state in the catalysts. High methanol yield and catalyst stability achieved from this perovskite catalyst were to be the proof to further investigate perovskite-based catalyst as a promising alternative for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol."
