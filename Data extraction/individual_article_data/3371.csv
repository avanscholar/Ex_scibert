0,Introduction,"Chemoselective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes to α, β-unsaturated alcohols is an important reaction in the production of fine chemicals, flavors, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals [1,2]. However, it is not easy to obtain the desired selective product because there are side reactions, that is, the hydrogenation of CC bond and further reduction resulting saturated alcohol (or potentially even full hydrogenation to propanol) as illustrated in the scheme of reaction pathways (Fig. 1 ). Cracking or aldol condensation may also occur [3,4]. Moreover, selective hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favored over hydrogenation of the CO bond of the aldehyde by ∼35kJ/mol [5]. Therefore, kinetic control is required, and the search for an active and selective catalyst presents a challenging problem. Generally, the hydrogenation of CO bond in α, β-unsaturated aldehydes can be accomplished by classical solution methods using hydride donors, such as LiAlH4 and NaBH4 [6]. Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction (aluminum catalyzed reduction of aldehydes and ketones by alcohols) is also highly specific for hydrogenation of CO bonds [7]. However, the low activities, difficulties in separation and recovery of the catalysts, and the subsequent environmental and economic issues limit the application of these homogeneous reactions on a large scale. By contrast, processes employing heterogeneous catalysts are more environmentally friendly and cost efficient. Gas-phase reactions are particularly interesting because no solvent is needed, and product separation requires less effort. Acrolein, the simplest α, β-unsaturated aldehyde, is a convenient model compound to investigate the selective hydrogenation reaction. Because there are no functional groups on the ethylenic double bond (R1, R2 in Fig. 1), no trans- or cis-products will be formed during the hydrogenation process, and analysis of the products is therefore simpler. In addition, acrolein is very volatile (b.p.=53°C), and the reaction can be studied in the gas phase. However, it has been found in many studies that bulky substituents facilitate high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [2,8–10]. These substituents not only sterically hinder the interaction between CC double bond and the surface of catalyst but also have an inductive effect that may deactivate the CC bond. Therefore, the simplicity of acrolein (which lacks these substituent groups) also makes it the most difficult of all the α, β-unsaturated aldehydes to be selectively hydrogenated. Conventional hydrogenation catalysts involving late transition metals such as Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru as active metals usually have poor performance in selective hydrogenation of acrolein. For example, Marinelli et al. [11] reported that Pt/Aerosil 200 has only 1.6% selectivity to allyl alcohol at 80°C in a fixed-bed reactor. Hoang-Van and Zegaoui [12] examined Pt/Al2O3, Pt/C and Pt/SiO2, which all displayed poor selectivity (<1%). Gyorffy and Paál [13] conducted a detailed investigation into acrolein hydrogenation on a series of unsupported PdPt powder catalysts prepared by colloid synthesis. They compared product distribution at high conversion (>80%) and at different temperatures (from 293K to 473K) and hydrogen partial pressures (varied between 10 and 400Torr), but observed no selectivity to allyl alcohol for any of these catalysts. In contrast to the poor selectivities reported above, silver and gold have been shown to exhibit much higher selectivity to desired hydrogenation product allyl alcohol [5,14–20] than other d-band transition metals. Unlike platinum on which H2 molecules dissociate readily even at temperatures as low as −173°C providing atomic hydrogen for reaction, silver and gold barely adsorb and dissociate H2 on their surfaces and are traditionally considered inert for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation [21]. Highly dispersed supported gold catalysts have garnered much interest due to their unusually high activities in many reactions [15]. One Au/ZrO2 and three Au/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by Claus’ group [14], by different methods. Co-precipitation was used for the ZrO2 supported catalyst; deposition precipitation (DP), impregnation (I), coprecipitation (F), and a sol gel technique (SG) were used to synthesize the TiO2 supported catalysts. At 180°C, Au/TiO2-DP and Au/TiO2-I showed similar selectivities to the desired unsaturated alcohol, 41% and 43%, respectively. Given the gold particle sizes of these two samples are 5.3nm for Au/TiO2-DP and 2nm for Au/TiO2-I, they claimed that the hydrogenation of acrolein on Au/TiO2 is structure-insensitive, at least for this specific range of particle size (2–5nm). However, no allyl alcohol was produced on Au/TiO2-SG or Au/ZrO2-F under the same reaction conditions. Later, a series of zirconia supported gold catalysts were studied by the same group [16] showing similar behavior. An increase in selectivity to allyl alcohol with increasing particle size was observed with a maximum selectivity of 35% at 5% conversion over Au/ZrO2-DP22 (d mean =7.7nm), while the selectivity over Au/ZrO2-DP24 (d mean =4.0nm) was 28% at the same conversion. The group investigated the influence of the gold nanoparticle structure from two aspects, the occurrence of multiply twinned particles (MTPs) and the degree of rounding. The authors concluded that higher MTPs resulted in lower selectivity to allyl alcohol and TOF, while a higher degree of rounding improved the selectivity. Silver catalysts have also been shown to be good candidates for acrolein hydrogenation. Grünert et al. [18] employed Ag/TiO2 catalysts in the gas-phase hydrogenation of acrolein. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using AgNO3 as the silver precursor on P25 TiO2 followed by calcination and reduction. Higher selectivity was achieved than over similar supported gold catalysts. For example, a Ag/TiO2 catalyst reduced at 200°C selectively converted acrolein to allyl alcohol with a 41.8% selectivity at 200°C and 2MPa pressure. The activity of this Ag/TiO2 catalyst was 85.3 μ mol g Ag - 1 s - 1 , which was almost twice of that of the gold catalyst mentioned above ( 44 μ mol g Au - 1 s - 1 [16]). Grunert and coworkers also observed an SMSI effect for these Ag/TiO2 catalysts. The samples reduced at lower temperature (200°C) had higher selectivity to allyl alcohol (41.8% vs. 27.2%) and one order of magnitude higher TOF than one reduced at higher temperature (500°C). These results suggest that Ti suboxide overlayers may have formed at higher temperature which blocked Ag sites or inhibited the growth of silver particles resulting in a decrease of both activity and selectivity. Silica-supported silver catalysts were also investigated [20]. Other silver catalysts, i.e., silver sputtered on aluminum foil (Ag/Al-S) or on silica (0.2Ag/SiO2-S), electrochemically deposited silver (Ag/Al-E) and bulk silver (single crystals and foil), were also catalytically tested for comparison with catalysts prepared via more traditional methods such as incipient wetness impregnation (IW) and deposition precipitation (DP). These catalysts were tested at 250°C and two pressure ranges: low pressure (∼1bar) and high pressure (5–20bar). No conversion was observed over single crystals or electrolytic silver. At 1bar, Ag/Al-S and 0.2Ag/SiO2-S mainly produced propanal and exhibited less than 10% selectivity to allyl alcohol. 7.5Ag/SiO2-IW showed selectivity up to 28% under the same conditions. The 0.2Ag/SiO2-S catalyst had 23% selectivity to allyl alcohol when tested at 20bar but at a conversion of less than 5%. Under the same conditions, the other two silica-supported samples prepared by IW or DP had selectivities of 42% and 39%, respectively, at conversions of ∼25%. Flat polycrystalline substrates like sputtered or electrochemically deposited silver showed poor selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. However, when supporting Ag on silica, the selectivity to allyl alcohol was increased to 42%. 7.5Ag/SiO2-IW (d mean ∼2–3nm) had the best performance as mentioned above. These authors concluded that smaller particles with more edge and kink sites favored the formation of allyl alcohol. Nonetheless, this conclusion seems insufficient to explain why Ag/SiO2-DP with a much larger mean particle size (∼15nm) had similar catalytic performance. Bron et al. also found that the presence of oxygen resulted in an increase in the activity of Ag catalysts. By pretreating the catalysts in air, the activity increased even without an apparent change in the particle size [22]. To have an effective catalyst, one must tune the process conditions appropriately. From the results of Bron et al., one can conclude that the reaction pressure is a crucial process parameter in the selective hydrogenation of acrolein in gas phase [19,20]. In their investigation into acrolein hydrogenation over silver catalysts, a detailed map of selectivity vs. reaction pressure was drawn by Schlögl and coworkers over a pressure range from ∼2mbar to 20bar, which showed that higher pressure favored the selective production of allyl alcohol. For example, no allyl alcohol was formed below 75mbar over a 7.5wt% Ag/SiO2-IW. However, the selectivity increased to 28% when the pressure reached about 1bar, continued increasing to ∼36% at 5bar, and plateaued above 10bar. It has been speculated that the increase in selectivity may be due to the change of adsorption mode of acrolein under higher pressure. Lambert et al. had previously studied acrolein adsorption on Ag(111) single crystal surfaces and found that increasing the coverage of acrolein in the presence of co-adsorbed hydrogen led to an increase in the selectivity to allyl alcohol [23]. At low coverage (0.45 ML), NEXAFS results indicate that the acrolein molecule lies parallel to the surface but at high coverage (0.80 ML) the CC bond tilts away from the surface. To further investigate this point, Ferullo et al. [24] performed density functional theory calculations examining the adsorption of acrolein on Ag(111) surface. Various structures were tested in which the acrolein was arranged in either a “head to tail” fashion where the molecules are all oriented the same way or a “head to head” configuration where the aldehyde functional groups face one another. When acrolein molecules were oriented in head-to-tail manner, acrolein adsorbed parallel to the surface and varying coverage did not alter the adsorption mode. At low coverage (2 acrolein molecules in a 5×3 cell), orienting the molecules in the head-to-head mode also resulted in the adsorption of acrolein in isolated dimers parallel to the surface. However, for the p(4×2) structure (2 acrolein molecules in 4×2 cell), a totally different picture of adsorption emerged as a molecular network involved chains of adsorbed acrolein in a zigzag pattern, where each molecule interacted with two nearest neighbors through O⋯H bonding. The resulting structure has 50% of the molecules adsorbed in a vertical arrangement such that the oxygen atoms were much closer to the surface (AgO distance is 2.72Å as compared to 3.54Å) and should react more easily with adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Since silver has been found to be one of the most promising candidates for this reaction, so far, we would like to have a deeper understanding of its mechanism in catalyzing the selective hydrogenation of acrolein and the particle size effect of the catalysts. The results of Claus and Schlögl and coworkers suggest that particle size may be a crucial factor governing the selectivity. However, the range of sizes previously examined may not have been sufficient to provide a definitive answer. Herein, we report the results of a detailed systematic study on the particle size effect of Ag/SiO2 catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Various supported silver samples were prepared using Ag(NO)3 as the silver precursor and silica as the support. Direct or modified incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) was employed in aqueous solution to synthesize silver catalyst samples. Here, modified incipient wetness impregnation is referred to a special treatment that is inspired by strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) [25]. According to the theory of SEA, controlling the pH of the impregnating liquid helps to improve the interaction between metal (or metal complex) and support surface, so that better dispersion can be obtained. In the modified IWI, all the steps are the same as normal IWI except that one needs to adjust the pH value of the solution first. We first used a 5-mL water to dissolve the Ag(NO)3 (amount varies depending on loading; for 8wt% Ag, 0.63g Ag(NO)3 is required) and then added 30% ammonia hydroxide drop by drop until precipitation disappeared. Water and ammonia hydroxide were added to make a suitable amount of solution for impregnation depending on the pore volume (typically 5–6mL) and make sure the pH is around 11. After impregnation, catalysts are dried in a vacuum oven at 100°C before different treatments were applied (calcination, reduction and/or steaming) to obtain different particle sizes of silver. The notation for naming the catalysts includes metal loading, support, preparation method, and treatment. For example, sample 8Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C250R250S250 is a 8wt% (designed loading) silica-supported silver catalyst prepared by modified incipient wetness impregnation and calcined at 250°C, reduced at 250°C, and steamed at 250°C. The calcination treatments were performed for 2h in a furnace open to the atmosphere but without flow. The reduction treatments were performed in a tube furnace with a 50mL/min flow of 3.5% H2 for 2h. The steaming treatments were performed by flowing 50mL/min of He over a stainless steel bubbler, which was preheated to 55°C, so there was about 15% water vapor in the total flow. The flow was brought to the reactor at the steaming temperature. Steaming treatments were performed for 1–3h to vary particle size."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 ICP The loading of silver was determined by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy) (PerkinElmer, OPTIMA 2000DV). A suitable amount of catalyst (e.g., 20mg for the 8wt% Ag sample) was wetted first with 2mL of DI water. 5mL of concentrated nitric acid was added, and the mixture was vigorously shaken for 3h to dissolve the silver from the support. It was then diluted to 25mL with DI water, filtered, and tested to determine the amount of Ag present. 2.2.2 EXAFS Since our target is to understand particle size effect, EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) was adopted as a powerful and efficient tool to estimate particle size. EXAFS experiments were taken at the beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-ID and 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. The samples were grounded and packed into the sample holder. The amount of samples (10–80mg) was chosen based on the sample loading to ensure appropriate total absorbance at Ag K edge (25.51keV). All the samples were reduced in 3.5% H2/He at 200°C for one hour then cooled in He and scanned at room temperature in an environmental cell in transmission mode. Ag foil was also scanned for energy calibration. The WINXAS 3.1 program was used to fit the data to obtain coordination number and bond distance between neighboring Ag atoms, using a k 2-weighted Fourier transform. The AgAg phase and amplitude functions were obtained from the first coordination shell of Ag foil (NAgAg =12 at 2.889Å). An empirical relationship between the coordination number and particle size previously extracted from a series of platinum samples was used since both silver and platinum are fcc (face centered cubic) metals [21]. However, since there is no specific rule to choose Debye–Waller factor, some error is introduced in our size estimation. Therefore, TEM results are needed to calibrate the relationship of particle size vs. coordination number. Once we have established a relationship between the observed particle sizes (TEM) and the estimated sizes (EXAFS), particle sizes can be easily achieved by interpolation, and tedious TEM data processing can be avoided. 2.2.3 XANES L3-edge (3351eV) XANES (X-ray near edge absorption spectroscopy) spectra were measured at beamline 9-BM of Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The samples were ground and packed in a specially designed sample holder where the sample pellet was positioned 45° facing the incident beam. Samples are reduced and measured in a flow cell, which is air-tight and allows heating and cooling. Samples were reduced first at 200°C. The spectra were collected in fluorescence mode without cooling down the samples to avoid reoxidation. Three spectra were taken on each sample and averaged to ensure the data quality. 2.2.4 STEM STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) images were taken at RRC (Research Resources Center), UIC on a TEM/STEM microscope equipped with HAADF (high angle annular dark field) detector (JEOL JEM-2010F). The particle sizes were analyzed using software Comptage de particule (V2). About 100–250 particles were typically counted in 10 randomly chosen fields for each catalyst."
4,Catalysis,"2.3 Catalysis Catalyst testing was performed in a 1/2in. OD stainless steel fixed-bed continuous gas-flow reactor. Mass flow controllers were used to control gas flow. In an earlier version of experiment setup, acrolein (Fluka⩾95%) was carried out by argon gas passing through a glass saturator, which was kept at 0°C by immersing in ice-water bath. However, limited by the pressure rating of the saturator and the fact that the partial pressure of acrolein at 0°C could not provide high enough concentration for high pressure reaction, a liquid pump was then used. Acrolein was delivered by a liquid pump (VICI M6), evaporated at 70°C in a heat tape traced four way cross-packed with quartz wool and carried into the system by reaction feed gas (argon and hydrogen). The quartz wool filter was also used to prevent acrolein polymerization products from plugging the reactor. The gas-phase concentration of acrolein was checked for every run by via a reactor bypass line that connects directly to the gas chromatograph. The molar ratio of H2 to acrolein is held constant at 20:1 unless otherwise noted. 30–400mg of catalyst was used for each test depending on the activity. Catalyst samples were reduced in 20% H2/Ar flow at 200°C for an hour. For the sake of comparison with previous work by the Claus’ group [20], several catalysts were tested under atmosphere pressure and at a pressure of 5atm. The other process conditions are the same as those under atmospheric pressure. The reactor effluent was analyzed by an online gas chromatography (Agilent 6890) equipped with a dual column formed by a RT-Msieve 5A and a RT-QPLOT (Restek) for lighter gaseous species and a EC-Wax (Alltech) for less volatile species such as alcohols. TCD (thermal conductive detector) and FID (flame ionization detector) were both used for detecting H2 and other organic/flammable compounds, respectively. A trap was installed at the end of the stream to collect condensed products. Product identification was later confirmed via GC/MS in a separate system. All potential products were calibrated for their retention times by the GC/MS (including impurities of acetone and acetaldehyde) using the same column setup in various trial runs involving calibrated mixtures products (acrolein, propanal, etc.). The whole system was built with stainless steel parts to handle high pressure and was heat-traced to avoid condensation of any product. The diagram of the reaction system is illustrated in Fig. S1 in the Supplemental information."
5,Results and discussion,"A series of silica-supported silver catalysts (the complete list is provided in Table S1) with various particle sizes were successfully made by using different synthesis and treatment methods. A Ag K edge EXAFS spectrum of each sample was taken to estimate the particle size. The Fourier transformation in R space of the data taken on a big particle sample (8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325) and a small particle sample (2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500R200) as well as a Ag foil are shown in Fig. 2 . For the larger sample, two peaks at 2.70Å and 2.15Å appear in the spectra with a shoulder at 1.9Å. From Fig. 2, it is apparent that the same features appear for foil, and therefore, the smaller scattering distances are not associated with atoms at different distances but rather with the scattering of the photoelectron off electrons of different energy in the Ag atom. For the smaller particle size, these peaks are shifted to slightly smaller scattering distances due to lattice contraction with decreasing particle size [26]. Both the XANES and EXAFS are consistent with metallic Ag, and there is no Ag(+1) oxide at detectable levels, typically within a few percent. STEM was used to help establish the relationship of coordination number and particle size and also confirm the results from EXAFS. The equation used to estimate mean particle sizes in angstrom is as follows: (1) d mean = 10 0.1319 × CN + 0.4237 where CN is coordination number. The relationship of AgAg bond distance vs. coordination number (Fig. S2) and the relationship of AgAg bond distance vs. estimated particle size (Fig. S3) are provided in Supplemental information. We found that it was difficult to make large particles on SiO2 when the modified IWI was employed, and the silver loading was low. In this case, steaming had to be carried out to sinter the small particles, so larger particles could be created. By increasing the concentration of silver nitrate and using direct IWI, larger particles were formed without steam treatment. Among all the catalysts, a few with representative particle sizes were chosen (shown in Table 1 ) to test their catalytic performance. The sample treatments, their coordination numbers, and corresponding particle sizes are listed in Table 1, and the relationship between coordination number and particle size is plotted in Fig. 3 . The mean particle sizes that we obtained by analyzing STEM images and by fitting EXAFS coordination numbers are very consistent, proving that EXAFS is an efficient and effective way to analyze particle size. However, there is an obvious disadvantage of using EXAFS to estimate particle size in that it gives a single number for the average particle size and does not reveal the particle size distribution. STEM images showed that the particles were fully consistent with the sizes indicated by EXAFS. For example, using STEM, the 2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500R200 was found to have an average particle size of d mean =1.1±0.3nm as shown in Fig. 4 , in agreement with the slightly smaller size reported by EXAFS (d mean =0.9nm) when considering the estimated error. Silver L3 edge XANES spectra also indicate clear changes according to increasing the particle size. When the particle size is small (sample 2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500R200 and 0.5Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C150R200), a small peak arises in the middle of edge at about 3353eV as marked by solid line in the insert of Fig. 5 . This edge peak appears in Ag+ compounds spectra and was assigned to 2p→5s transition [27]. Miyamoto et al. [27] suggested that the intensity of the peak for the 4d is a result of 5s-4d hybridization and related to the covalency between silver and its ligand. However, our K edge spectra indicate that the particles are fully metallic, so we ascribe this peak to changes in the hybridization of the AgAg bonds as the coordination decreases [26]. In our case, the peak size shrank with increasing particle size from 0.8nm (2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500R200) to 2.2nm (0.5Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C150R200). No edge peak was observed in the spectrum of the large particle size sample 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325 (8.7nm). For 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325, there are two peaks right after the edge (3363eV and 3370eV, marked by dash line in Fig. 5), while no peaks appear at the same energy position for the other two samples. We also observe that the bigger the particles are, the sharper EXAFS oscillation is, because Ag atoms have more neighboring atoms. Selectivity at 10% conversion vs. particle size is plotted in Fig. 6 a. The results indicate that the selectivity to allyl alcohol goes up with increasing the particle size from 1 to 9nm. At lower pressure (1atm), the selectivity obtained over the smallest particle sample 2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500_R200 (0.8nm) is only about 7%. It steadily increases with increasing particle size over the range that we investigated. The best selectivity achieved at 1atm is 27% on 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325. Claus and coworkers previously prepared catalysts in a similar manner with an average particle size of 2.5nm demonstrated a selectivity of 29% at 1atm [20]. It should be mentioned that the TEM analysis in Claus’ work indicated that at least some of the particles were in the size range of 12nm. At higher pressure (5atm), the selectivity shows the same trend with the smallest nanoparticles showing a selectivity of 15% and the largest showing a selectivity of 37%. In contrast to some earlier reports [18,20], our results unambiguously indicate that increasing particle size results in increasing selectivity. The selectivity results indicate that the Ag(111) sites are likely responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl. However, one might suppose that catalysts with smaller particle size may be more active because the smaller the particles possess more undercoordinated metal atoms, which could act as active sites. Therefore, we estimated a TOF for the catalysts based on a hemispherical model for particle size, whereby only surface atoms are considered. The number of surface atoms is given by the following equation, in which D is the radius of a silver particle, and d represents the diameter of Ag atom (0.289nm in bulk). The rate measurement is reproducible within an error of 4.2%. (2) n = π D 2 3 d 2 Surprisingly, the catalysts having larger particle sizes tended to have higher turnover frequencies. Examining the TOFs of samples at 5atm total pressure as an example, as illustrated in Fig. 6b marked by red dots, the TOF of the silver catalyst having smallest particle size (2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C500_R200) is 0.06×10−2 s−1, whereas the TOF improves to 0.53×10−2 s−1 for the 6.6nm particle size (2Ag/SiO2_mIWI_C250R250S500), an increase by almost a full order of magnitude. The TOF of the largest particle sample 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325 rises even more sharply to 2.6×10−2 s−1. The TOF results are slightly surprising since they indicate that the most active catalyst is also the most selective one. We have also examined the effect of pressure on the reaction kinetics. First from the results shown in Fig. 6a, one can notice that increasing the pressure results in better selectivity to allyl alcohol, consistent with the results of Claus’ group. We also find that the TOF is enhanced by raising reaction pressure. TOFs at 5atm are about one order of magnitude higher than at 1atm. We extended our study of gas-phase acrolein hydrogenation over Ag/SiO2 catalysts by performing a more in-depth analysis of the kinetics. We focus here on one particular catalyst, 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325, which we found to have the highest selectivity among the samples we measured. Measurements of reaction kinetics were made for a variety of process conditions under both low (1atm) or high (5atm) pressure. For a complete kinetics study, we assumed a simple power rate law: r = k [ Acrolein ] m [ H 2 ] n We varied the concentration/partial pressure of acrolein or H2 to attain the reaction orders of both reactants. Taking the logarithm yields: ln ( r ) = ln ( k ) + m ln [ Acrolein ] + n ln [ H 2 ] Since k is only a function of temperature here, at fixed T, the slope from plotting ln(r) against ln[acrolein] is m when keeping the concentration of H2 constant. n can be determined in an analogous manner. The reaction orders under two different pressures and other kinetic parameters are presented in Table 2 . Assuming an Arrhenius expression for the rate law, plotting ln(k) against 1/T generates a straight line, with a slope of −Eact /R. The Arrhenius plots under low and high pressures are shown in Fig. 7 . The apparent activation energy of acrolein conversion is 53kJ/mol at 1atm but is slightly lower to (42kJ/mol) at 5atm (repeating the reaction over a finely ground 8AgSiO2_IWI_R325 sample with similar results confirms that the lower activation energy is not due to mass transfer limitations as shown in Fig. S4). Higher pressure seems to lowers the reaction barrier and also lowers the reaction order for acrolein. Our results are consistent with Claus’ group’s result using Ag/TiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [28], although their use of a TiO2 support prevents us from a direct comparison. The structure sensitivity of our silver catalysts (i.e., increasing particle size increasing the selectivity towards allyl alcohol) is also similar to what they obtained on a series of gold catalysts [14]. It seems very likely that the increased selectivity and activity with particle size are related to larger portion of (111) surface on larger particles, where acrolein adsorbs especially through CO bond and its activation are favored. It is not currently clear why the presence of undercoordinated atoms on the surface is unfavorable to acrolein hydrogenation. In contrast, the effect of pressure is easier to understand when we return to previous fundamental studies. Both the experimental studies of Brandt et al. and the computational efforts of Ferullo et al. [24] support the notion that the adsorption mode of acrolein is highly sensitive to coverage. At low coverage (low pressure), the molecule may adsorb parallel to the surface but as the coverage (pressure) increases, the adsorption geometry shifts to present the CO bond to the surface. From our results of reaction order (Table 2), the reaction of order of acrolein is smaller at higher pressure, clearly indicating that raising reaction pressure leads to a higher coverage of acrolein. In addition, Rösch and coworkers have previously found that dissociation of hydrogen on Ag surfaces is a difficult process requiring both high temperature and high pressure to accomplish at high rates [29–31]. One may anticipate that continuing to increase the pressure may enhance the selectivity and activity further. To probe the reaction kinetics further, a pathway analysis has been performed for 8Ag/SiO2_IWI_R325. This method was developed by Bhore et al. [32,33] for discernment of the rank (i.e., primary, secondary, etc.) of a reaction product. We consistently observe four products: propanal, allyl alcohol, propanol, and propene. The first-rank delplot method (a plot of selectivity of a product vs. reactant conversion) allows the separation of primary products from non-primary products. By extrapolating the plot of selectivity vs. conversion to zero conversion, one finds that for primary products that the intercept is nonzero. However, if the intercept is zero, the product is non-primary. Higher rank products can be determined by a higher rank delplot. For example, secondary products can be identified by plotting (component selectivity)/(conversion) against conversion. At zero conversion, primary products have infinite intercepts, and secondary products have finite intercepts and higher-order ones have zero intercepts. Fig. 8 is the delplot for the primary and secondary product determination at atmosphere pressure. As illustrated in Fig. 8a, propanal and allyl alcohol are clearly first rank, and propanol and propene are of higher rank. In Fig. 8b, the fitting curves for propanal and allyl alcohol diverge at zero conversion confirming they are primary products. The intercept of propanol is nonzero, implying it is a secondary product, while propene may be a higher rank product due to its zero intercept. However, the selectivity to propene may be too low to make an accurate evaluation, so one must use some caution. Similar plotting was done on the same catalyst at high pressure (5atm) as shown in Fig. 9 over a smaller range of conversion. Over this range, one can clearly see that all the product ranks remain the same as at atmosphere pressure. The advantage of doing the first-rank plotting is not only to tell the primary products from the others, but also to provide a relationship between selectivity and conversion, so that the selectivity for a specific conversion can be read via the curve. Thus, a fair performance comparison of different catalysts can be conducted. Comparing the first-rank delplot under 1atm and 5atm, the selectivity at higher pressure at the initial conversion is higher but not by a large extent (37% at 5atm vs. 33% at 1atm), in agreement with Claus’ result. However, with increasing conversion, the selectivity at atmospheric pressure apparently decreases. The allyl alcohol selectivity is 27% at 35% conversion and decreases with increasing the conversion. However, at higher pressure, the selectivity remains virtually constant. The selectivity only decreased by 2–35% when the conversion is 35%. Higher pressure seems to not only improve the selectivity of the catalyst but prevents deleterious side reactions that can occur at high conversion. As mentioned earlier, for minority products, it may be difficult to precisely determine the product rank from the delplot analysis. To overcome this obstacle, additional secondary pathway analysis was performed where we used the primary products propanal and allyl alcohol as reactants in the feed instead of acrolein. When propanal is used as the feed (Fig. 10 a), propanol is the only product that we observed. This implies that propanal is stable. However, when we use allyl alcohol as the feed, three products are observed: propene, propanol, and propanal (Fig. 10b). The selectivity to propene is 5%, and the selectivity to propanol is 25%, while the primary product is propanal (70%). This experiment suggests that propene is a second-rank product produced from hydrodeoxygenation of allyl alcohol (we did not attempt to analyze water, the other likely product from the hydrodeoxygenation reaction). To our knowledge, propene has not been previously observed as a product of acrolein hydrogenation over Ag catalysts. However, propane has been previously observed in trace amounts by some researchers over Pt/SiO2 [12,34], and silver is typically used to prevent overhydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes [35–37]. In our case, propene does not appear in substantial amounts until relatively high conversion, so other researchers may not have attempted to quantify it at low conversion. In addition, allyl alcohol could be fully hydrogenated to propanol, which is not surprising. Finally, we observe that allyl alcohol is easily isomerized to propanal, but propanal cannot be isomerized to allyl alcohol on silver catalyst under our reaction condition. Additional tests of the support material in the absence of Ag show no activity for isomerization of allyl alcohol. Our result implies propanal may be produced not only from hydrogenation of acrolein but also from the isomerization reaction. Therefore, a successful catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of acrolein must not only hydrogenate CO bond, but also prevent the isomerization from allyl alcohol to propanal. However, when the isomerization has not been eliminated, one cannot obtain high selectivity at high conversion, and the reaction needs to be run at low conversion to achieve high selectivity to allyl alcohol."
6,Conclusion,"For silver nanoparticle on silica catalysts, larger particle size favors higher rate and selectivity to desired allyl alcohol product. The higher selectivity may be the result of the adsorption geometry of acrolein on larger particles, suggesting that low Miller index surfaces are important for selective hydrogenation of acrolein. As observed by Claus’ group, higher pressure yields higher selectivity. The pathway analysis shows that allyl alcohol and major part of propanal are first-rank products, and propanol and propene are second-rand products. A small part of propanal is secondary product from allyl alcohol. The isomerization from allyl alcohol to propanal lowers the yield at higher conversion. An ideal catalyst requires selective hydrogenation of CO bond without allyl alcohol isomerization to propanal."
