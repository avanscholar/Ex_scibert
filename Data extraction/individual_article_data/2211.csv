0,Introduction,"Increasing energy demand and global warming that is associated with the increasing use of fossil fuels increase the demand to produce clean, renewable energy. Hydrogen is considered as a good alternative to conventional fossil fuels because its energy content (122MJkg−1) is high (Logan et al., 2002) and because hydrogen results in a clean combustion as the only side-product is water (Zhu et al., 2008). The ability to degrade cellulosic material is important since lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant raw material in nature (Ren et al., 2009) and has low cost. Cellulose is the major constituent of plant biomass and is found in many waste streams, including agricultural and food industry wastes, brewery wastewaters, and waste sludges (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). In dark fermentation, hydrogen can be produced either by simultaneous cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen production or by separating these steps into different reactors (Saratale et al., 2008). Pure cultures, including species of the genera Enterobacter, Bacillus and Clostridium, have been widely studied for hydrogen production (Hawkes et al., 2002). Simultaneous cellulose degradation and hydrogen production with pure cultures has also been reported, for example, with Clostridium acetobutylicum (Wang et al., 2008) and Clostridium thermocellum (Levin et al., 2006). However, use of mixed cultures is preferred because they are easier to operate and control, they can treat non-sterilized feedstocks, their cellulose conversion rates are higher, and they consist of both hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms (Levin et al., 2004; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Ren et al., 2009). Hydrogen producing cellulolytic mixed cultures exist in environments such as anaerobic digester sludge and sludge compost (Ueno et al., 1995), forest soil (Ravindran et al., 2010), and hot springs (Koskinen et al., 2008a). Mixed cultures usually contain hydrogen consuming microorganisms, such as methanogens, homoacetogens or sulphate reducers, which have to be inhibited. This can be done with different pretreatments, from which the most common and effective has been heat-treating the cultures at 100°C for 15min (Li and Fang, 2007). Furthermore, the use of elevated temperatures controls some hydrogen consuming bacteria (Ren et al., 2009). In this study, fermentative hydrogen producers were enriched on cellulose at elevated temperatures (52, 60 and 70°C). Microflora for the experiments was derived from thermophilic compost. The effect of different heat treatments on hydrogen production potentials and microbial communities were delineated. To the authors knowledge the effect of heat pretreatment on microbial community composition of compost inoculum has not been studied before."
1,Methods,
2,Seed microorganisms,"2.1 Seed microorganisms Compost material from thermophilic (60–70°C) phase of pile compost obtained from a Solid Waste Management Site (Tarastenjärvi, Tampere, Finland) was used as source material for the enrichments. In the first enrichment step, the ratio of inoculum (28.1% volatile solids, VS) and substrate was set to 1:2 (w/w). Compost material was weighed prior to the addition."
3,Batch enrichment of thermophilic H2 -producing microorganisms,"2.2 Batch enrichment of thermophilic H2 -producing microorganisms The microbial enrichments were incubated at 52, 60 and 70°C. The microbial cultures were manipulated in the following ways: (i) no pretreatment (NHT), (ii) heat treatment at 80°C for 20min (HT1) and (iii) heat treatment at 100°C for 10min (HT2). Duplicate samples and two control bottles without substrate were prepared for each temperature. The first enrichments were conducted in 25mL anaerobic tubes with a working volume of 10mL. The following two enrichment phases were done in 120mL serum bottles with 50mL working volume and with 2% (v/v) inoculum. The enrichments at 52 and 60°C were incubated on a shaker (150rpm), while the enrichments at 70°C were done under static conditions. The enrichment medium was DSMZ 144 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 2008) with the following modifications: 5g-cellulose L−1 (Sigmacell Cellulose, Type 20) was used instead of glucose, no tryptone was used and yeast extract concentration was decreased to 0.3gL−1. Headspace in the serum bottles was made anaerobic with N2 and sterile cellulose, vitamins and Na 2 S · 9 H 2 O were aseptically added to the medium from stock solutions after sterilization of the medium. Cellulose was sterilized by autoclaving it at 121°C for 20min, while vitamin and Na 2 S · 9 H 2 O solutions were sterile filtered (0.2μm, Whatman FP 30). Gas production was monitored over time and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were analyzed in the end of the enrichments."
4,Chemical analyses,"2.3 Chemical analyses The overpressure from the batch bottles was analyzed according to Owen et al. (1979). The gas composition (H2, CH4 and CO2) in the headspace was analyzed with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-2014 equipped with Porapak N column (80/100mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperatures of oven, injector and detector were 80, 110 and 110°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20mLmin−1. The gas volumes were corrected to a standard pressure (760mm Hg) and temperature (0°C), and cumulative H2 production was calculated according to Logan et al. (2002). The concentrations of VFAs and alcohols were analyzed with Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column (Showa Denko K. K., Japan) and a refraction index detector (Shimadzu). Mobile phase was 5mM H2SO4 and flow rate 0.7mLmin−1. Samples for HPLC were pretreated with a solid phase extraction (SPE) method modified from Horspool and McKellar (1991). The cartridge was preconditioned with 2mL methanol and 2mL 0.01M HCl (pH 2), and the VFAs and ethanol were eluted from the sorbent with 1.75mL 0.05M PBS. Cellulose degradation was calculated based on formed COD in the end of each enrichment phase. COD was calculated as a sum of degradation products and produced hydrogen according to Eq. (1) (van Haandel and van der Lubbe, 2007). (1) COD = 8 × ( 4 x + y - 2 z ) / ( 12 x + y + 16 z ) g COD / g C x H y O z"
5,Microbial community analyses,"2.4 Microbial community analyses Bacterial communities were characterized using DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction – denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. Duplicate samples were taken at the end of each enrichment phase and stored at −20°C. DNA was extracted with a VIOGENE Blood and Tissue Genomic DNA kit (Proteogenix SA, Fegersheim, France). Partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using a primer pair GC-BacV3f and 907r as previously described by Koskinen et al. (2007), only exception being that PCR was done with T3000 Thermocycler (Biometra). DGGE was performed with INGENYphorU2×2 -system (Ingeny International BV, GP Goes, The Netherlands) as described by Koskinen et al. (2007) with following exceptions: denaturing gradient from 30% to 70% was used, gels were run with 100V for 22.5h, and dominant bands were eluted in 20μL of sterile H2O. The re-amplification of bands for sequencing was done as described by Koskinen et al. (2007). Sequence data were analyzed with Bioedit-software (version 7.0.5) and compared with sequences in GenBank (http://www.ncb.nlm.nih.gov/blast/)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Enriching compost culture for hydrogen production,"3.1 Enriching compost culture for hydrogen production The original compost culture with or without heat treatment produced negligible amounts of hydrogen when incubated at 70°C and the enrichment of hydrogen producers was unsuccessful. Hydrogen production at temperatures of 70°C or higher has rarely been reported especially with complex substrates, such as cellulose. There are, however, few exceptions; Koskinen et al. (2008a) reported H2 production at 70 and 78°C with different enrichment cultures from a hot spring and one of these enrichments utilized cellulose. In addition, Liu et al. (2008) used an inoculum from a glucose fermentation reactor to produce H2 at 70°C from a household solid waste and Yokoyama et al. (2007) reported H2 production from cow waste slurry at 60 and 75°C. Cumulative hydrogen production with compost enrichments at 52 and 60°C was studied and the results were as presented in Fig. 1 . The HT2 culture (heat-treated at 100°C for 10min) grown at 60°C produced hydrogen only in the 1st enrichment phase. In addition, at 60°C with NHT (no heat-treatment) and HT1 (heat-treated at 80°C for 20min) cultures as well as at 52°C with HT2 cultures the hydrogen production decreased considerably in the 3rd enrichment phase. The compost enrichment HT1 at 52°C was the only culture that continued increasing H2 production in the 3rd enrichment phase and resulted in the highest hydrogen yield, 1.4mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 (2.4mol-H2 mol-hexose-degraded−1), of all the enrichments. Without HT at 52°C the H2 production in replicate bottles differed considerably; the other enrichment produced no H2, while the other enrichment produced similar H2 yields as the HT1 enrichment at 52°C. Similar inconsistency in parallel enrichments was seen in all H2 producing enrichment phases, although the extent of the fluctuation was less significant. The highest H2 yield with HT1 culture (52°C) was 35% of the maximum H2 yield (4mol-H2 mol-hexose−1, Eq. (2)). However, it was in the range of 1–2mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 that has been reported during cellulose fermentation (Levin et al., 2009). The highest H2 yields from cellulose was reported by Ueno et al. (1995), 2.4mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 (10gL−1, 58.0% cellulose degradation), with a sludge compost inoculum. Heat treatment is used to increase hydrogen production by inhibiting hydrogen consuming microorganisms and to enrich spore-forming hydrogen producers, such as Clostridia. However, in this experiment the higher heat-treatment temperatures (100°C against 80°C) used for pretreatment resulted in lower H2 yield. This has also been reported in other studies. For example, Baghchehsaraee et al. (2008) reported a 15% decrease in the hydrogen production yields of activated sludge and anaerobic sludge when the heat-treatment temperature was increased from 65 to 95°C. In addition, Ravindran et al. (2010) studied hydrogen production potentials from soil with different heat-pretreatments (65–120°C) and reported the highest hydrogen yields with HT temperatures between 95 and 105°C. Methane was not produced in any of the enrichments and hydrogen production in the control bottles was negligible. The absence of methane production without HT was likely associated with the drop of pH below six during hydrogen production, since most methanogens are active at the pH range from 6.8 to 7.5 (Zhu et al., 2008). Changes in pH also affect metabolic pathways (Wang and Wan, 2009) as well as the hydrogen production potentials since low pH can inhibit iron containing hydrogenase enzymes (Dabrock et al., 1992). The pH was not adjusted during the batch experiments and thus, the decrease in pH during the incubations (from initial pH 7 to pH 5) most likely decreased the hydrogen production in the sequential enrichments. Levin et al. (2009) suggested that the pH should be maintained between 7.0 and 7.2 for continuous H2 production during cellulose fermentation."
8,Fermentation products and cellulose degradation,"3.2 Fermentation products and cellulose degradation The VFA and alcohol concentrations were higher in the first enrichment phases of compost cultures than after subsequent transfers (Tables 1 and 2 ) since the initial inoculum provided additional substrate. The main degradation products both at 52 and 60°C were acetate and ethanol, accompanied by butyrate. High hydrogen yields are associated with the production of acetate (Eq. (2)) and/or butyrate (Eq. (3)) with theoretical maximums of 4 and 2mol-H2 mol-hexose−1, respectively (Levin et al., 2004). Formation of reduced end products, such as ethanol (Eq. (4)), is usually associated with lower hydrogen yields (Levin et al., 2004). However, ethanol and acetate production can be coupled (Eq. (5)) with a theoretical maximum of 2mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 (Ren et al., 2009). Ethanol was one of the main metabolites in all of the enrichment phases resulting in lower H2 yields. On the other hand, simultaneous H2 and ethanol could also be feasible (Koskinen et al., 2008b). (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Cellulose degradation (Fig. 2 ) in the end of enrichment phases was calculated by determining the initial and final COD concentrations based on the added cellulose and produced hydrogen and degradation products. The cellulose degradations and hydrogen production potentials were consistent; the highest hydrogen yields were obtained in the enrichments with the highest cellulose degradation, 1.4mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 and 57%, respectively. Thus, the hydrogen yield in most of the enrichment phases was limited by the cellulose hydrolysis. Degradation of cellulose has been reported to slow down the hydrogen production also in other studies where cellulose is hydrolyzed and hydrogen is produced simultaneously. Liu et al. (2003) reported a hydrogen yield of 102mL-H2 g-cellulose−1 (18% of the theoretical maximum) at 55°C with cellulose (5gL−1) and concluded that the low H2 yield was likely due to partial hydrolysis of cellulose. Nutrient requirements for cellulose hydrolysis include carbon and nitrogen as well as trace metals, growth factors and essential vitamins (Ren et al., 2009) that were included in the medium used in this study. The effect of nitrogen source on cellulose degradation and H2 production was reported by Ueno et al. (2001) showing that with inorganic nitrogen source and with peptone the cellulose degradation and hydrogen yields were 72.5 and 90.4% and 1.0 and 2.0mol-H2 mol-hexose−1, respectively. Furthermore, an increase in cellulose degradation might be possible by adjusting the pH. In the experiments of Ueno et al. (2001) the cellulose decomposition increased from 49.9% to 90.4% when the pH was adjusted to 6.4 during the run. Simultaneous cellulase production, cellulose hydrolysis and H2 production i.e. consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) reported in this study is desirable since it provides lower costs, simpler processing and lower energy inputs (Carere et al., 2008) than separate hydrolysis and H2 production. However, H2 yields obtained with CBP remain low (Levin et al., 2009). Thus, cellulase production and cellulose hydrolysis has also been separated into unit processes in order to increase the hydrogen production rates in the second reactor. This could be done by growing cellulolytic microorganisms, e.g. fungi, in the first reactor, from where the effluents could be further used for hydrogen production (Lakshmidevi and Muthukumar, 2010)."
9,Microbial communities in 52 and 60°C enrichments,"3.3 Microbial communities in 52 and 60°C enrichments Microbial communities of compost enrichments at 52 and 60°C were analyzed by PCR–DGGE. The DGGE profiles of different pretreatments were as presented in Fig. 3 and the results of the sequence affiliation were as shown in Table 3 . The enrichments contained mainly bacteria from families Thermoanaerobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae. Non-heat-treated cultures contained more bands suggesting that heat-treatments enriched for spore formers and reduced species diversity. Furthermore, in most of the enrichments the number of bands decreased during enrichment phases. Microorganism closely related (100% similarity) to Thermoanaerobium thermosaccharolyticum (band 3) was present both at 52 and 60°C in almost every enrichment phase. T. thermosaccharolyticum has optimal temperature and pH at 60°C and at 5–6, respectively, and hexose fermentation products include hydrogen, acetate and butyrate (O-Thong et al., 2009). It is a thermophilic, saccharolytic microorganism that does not degrade cellulose (Ueno et al., 2001). Hydrogen yields of 2.0–2.2mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 have been obtained with T. thermosaccharolyticum dominated cultures (Ueno et al., 2001; O-Thong et al., 2009). In addition to T. thermosaccharolyticum, enrichments contained other microorganisms capable of hydrogen production. These microorganisms were closely related to Clostridium cellulosi, Clostridium stercorarium, Clostridium caenicola, and Coprothermobacter proteolyticus. From these C. cellulosi and C. stercorarium were likely the two main species responsible for cellulose degradation. C. cellulosi is thermophilic and cellulolytic microorganism that produces hydrogen, ethanol and acetate as fermentation products. It is a spore former and grows optimally at temperatures 55–60°C and at pH 7.3–7.5 (Yanling et al., 1991). C. stercorarium is a thermophilic, spore-forming, cellulolytic bacterium, its fermentation products include hydrogen, ethanol, acetate and lactate, and its optimal temperature is 65°C (Madden, 1983). Although C. stercorarium is a spore former, it was present only in non-heat-treated enrichments. The fermentation products of C. caenicola and C. proteolyticus include hydrogen, lactate, acetate and ethanol (Shiratori et al., 2009), and hydrogen and acetate (Ollivier et al., 1985), respectively. In NHT enrichment at 60°C two other hydrogen producing bacteria, Thermoanaerobacterium mathranii (Larsen et al., 1997) and Thermoanaerobacterium italicus (Kozianowski et al., 1997), were detected. Although these microorganisms were the main hydrogen producers, the enrichments also contained numerous uncultured Clostridia species that may have contributed to hydrogen production. C. stercorarium and C. cellulosi were the only cellulolytic microorganisms and they were present in almost every enrichment phase with cellulose degradation and hydrogen production. The only exception was the 3rd enrichment of HT1 culture at 52°C that had the highest H2 yield. This suggests the presence of cellulolytic microorganisms among the uncultured bacteria (for example bands 27, 33 or 35), which may have contributed cellulose degradation also during the other enrichment phases. In other enrichment phases that lacked cellulolytic microorganisms, cellulose degradation prevented hydrogen production. Previously, it was discussed that large pH drop might have decreased H2 production in sequential enrichments. This may be associated with C. cellulosi that has an optimum pH between 7.3 and 7.5 and may have been inhibited by the large decrease in pH. Heat pretreatment has been widely used to enrich hydrogen producers and to improve the hydrogen yields (Hawkes et al., 2002). However, in this study heat pretreatment did not increase the hydrogen yields considerably. There were a large number of bands in the enrichments at 52°C as well as in the NHT enrichment at 60°C. However, in the heat-treated cultures at 60°C there were considerably less bands, which suggest that fewer spore formers were present that would tolerate higher growth temperatures. Consequently, the lowest H2 yields were obtained with these enrichments."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen can be produced from cellulose with microorganisms of compost origin. The heat treatments at 100°C do not enrich for H2 producers and higher H2 yields are obtained at 52°C than at 60°C. The highest H2 yield and cellulose degradation, 1.4mol-H2 mol-hexose−1 (2.4mol-H2 mol-hexose-degraded−1) and 57%, respectively, are obtained at 52°C with 80°C 20min heat-treatment. The H2 producing compost enrichments contain mainly bacteria from families Thermoanaerobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae, from which bacterium closely related to T. thermosaccharolyticum is mainly responsible for hydrogen production and bacteria closely related to C. cellulosi and C. stercorarium were responsible for cellulose degradation."
