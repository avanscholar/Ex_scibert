0,Introduction,"The sulfonamide motif characterizes the structure of numerous biologically active compounds (Fig. 1 ), including the early sulfa antibiotics (e.g. 1) [1], the HIV antivirals amprenavir (2) and darunavir (3), as well as pre-clinical exploratory compounds, such as the antitumor agent 4 [2], and the γ-secretase inhibitor 5 [3]. One of the most frequently used methods for the synthesis of sulfonamides is the direct sulfonylation of amines with sulfonyl chlorides in the presence of a base [4]. However, this method requires the handling of chemically unstable sulfonyl chlorides. The metal-catalyzed reaction of sulfonamides with unreactive alcohols (the so-called borrowing hydrogen reaction) is an alternative approach [5]. Although this method is often described as atom economical, it usually requires the use of precious transition metals (typically Ru, Rh, Ir) and harsh reaction conditions (typically >100 °C) [6]. Asymmetric hydrogenation of N-sulfonyl imines catalyzed by Ni [7] or co-catalyzed by Pd/Zn(OTf)2 [8] have also been reported, using high-pressures of H2 gas. Transfer hydrogenations of N-sulfonyl imines using HCOOH, HCO2NH4, simple alcohols or water as the proton source, and catalyzed by transition metals, provide noteworthy advantages (Scheme 1 a-c) [9]. Despite these notable advances, the use of toxic transition metals that are found in low-abundance in Nature (Pd, Rh or Ir) is still a concern, especially when used in the production of human therapeutics. During preparation of this manuscript, the Ni-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of N-sulfonyl imines was reported (Scheme 2 a) [10]. It stands to reason that when earth-abundant metals can catalyze such transfer hydrogenations, using simple alcohols or water, such methodologies are both greener and more economical. Mindful of this, we began to explore the Cu-mediated transfer hydrogenation of N-sulfonyl imines. Examples of similar methods have been previously employed in the copper-boryl mediated transfer hydrogenations of alkenes and alkynes [11], the chemoselective reduction of conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketones [12], and the semihydrogenation of alkynes to the Z-alkenes [13]. In this report, we describe the copper-boryl mediated transfer hydrogenation of sulfonyl imines to the corresponding sulfonamides using methanol as the proton source at room temperature and in good to excellent yields (Scheme 2b)."
1,Results and discussion,"Our investigations commenced by examining the copper-boryl mediated transfer hydrogenation of (E)-N-benzylidene-4-bromobenzenesulfonamide (6a) as the model substrate under a variety of reaction conditions (Table 1 ). Initially, a trace amount of the desired sulfonamide 7a was obtained, when 6a was treated with CuCl (10 mol %) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2; 0.1 equiv.) under basic conditions at room temperature (entry 1). However, sequentially increasing the amount of B2pin2 (from 0.1 to 1.2 equiv.) results in parallel successive increase in yields of the desired product 7a from 6% to 65% (entries 1–3). Interestingly, other copper salts, including CuBr (entry 4) and Cu(acac)2 (entry 5), had a slight detrimental effect in the reaction yield, whereas, decreasing the amount of base by 10-fold or the amount of CuCl by 2-fold did not affect the outcome, leading to nearly quantitative yields (entry 3 vs entries 7 and 8, respectively). Additionally, under these same reaction conditions, Pd(OAc)2, failed to catalyze this reaction to any appreciable amount (entry 6). Screening of simple alcohols and water suggested that methanol was the best hydrogen source (entries 8–11), whereas, the reaction did not proceed at all in the absence of Cu+1, a proton source or t-BuOK (entries 12–14). Exposure of the reaction mixture to air resulted in significantly lower yield (entry 16), consistent with an air-sensitive copper species (a Cu–H or a change in oxidation state of Cu+1) that may be generated in the course of this reaction. The generation of such a species was previously reported for related Cu–H and Cu–B mediated reactions involving alkynes [11]. Subsequently, we sought to investigate the generality of this methodology and substrate scope. A range of N-sulfonyl imines 6, readily synthesized from substituted benzaldehydes or heterocyclic aldehydes and 4-bromobenzenesulfonamides (6a-6 i), were subjected to the same reaction conditions (in a parallel library mode) to give the desired products 7a-7i (Table 2 ). Both para- and meta-substituted N-benzylic moieties (7a-7d, 7f and 7g) were obtained in good to excellent yields. Lower yields were obtained with N-substituents having an ortho-fluoro moiety (7e) or a heterocyclic substituent with a strongly electronegative atom at the Cβ carbon (7h and 7i). This is likely due to the coordination effect of these heteroatoms with the copper cation to form a stable 5-membered ring intermediate that decelerates the reaction rate. N-Sulfonyl imines derived from ketones were also viable substrates in this reaction, providing the desired products 7j and 7k in fairly good yields (72% and 67%, respectively). N-Sulfonyl imines obtained from the condensation of p-toluenesulfonamide and various substituted benzaldehyde were also explored. Reactions with aldimines bearing a benzylic substituent, including electron-rich arenes (e.g. 7m and 7n), heterocycles (7o) and those having an electron-withdrawing group at the para position (e.g. 7q-7t), proceeded efficiently and in good to excellent yields. Electron withdrawing substituents would be expected to activate the imine carbon for nucleophilic attack. However, we were unsuccessful in obtaining the nitro analog 7u and a fairly modest yield was obtained of 7v, possibly due to coordination and deactivation of the copper cation by the nitro group. Strongly electron-donating substituents, such as a para-methoxy group, would be expected to decelerate nucleophilic attach on the imine carbon and consequently, act as poor substrates for this type of reaction (e.g. 7p; no conversion was observed with imine 6p even at higher temperature and prolonged reaction time). Finally, some structural diversity on the sulfur substitution was also explored; examples included a thiophene, methyl and tert-butyl moiety, all of which gave good to excellent yields of the desired product (7w, 7x and 7y, respectively). We subsequently explored the application of this methodology in the transfer hydrogenation of aliphatic aldimines and ketimines (Table 3 ). Surprisingly, when sulfonylimines 8 were treated under the above optimized conditions (Table 3), we did not observe any of the desired products 10; in most cases, unreacted starting material and some decomposition products were recovered. In a few cases, modest yields of the Cα borylated products 9 were observed from aldimine-based substrates (e.g. 9b). Similar results were also observed with ketimines-based substrates, but only at higher temperatures (e.g. 9c). It is noteworthy that even when the purified borylated products 9 were re-exposed to the same reaction conditions at 60 °C for an additional 15h, only unreacted starting material was observed. Asymmetric N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)–Cu-catalyzed or NHC-metal free synthesis of α-amino boronate esters from sulfinamide substrates were previously reported by Ellman [14] and Sun [15]. However, Ellman reported that α-amino boronate esters of aromatic aldimines were chemically unstable and protodeborylation of such analogs occurred rapidly during chromatography [14a], particularly for those analogs with electron withdrawing substituent (e.g. the corresponding sulfinamide analog of sulfonamide 6q; Table 2). Given the expected higher electron deficiency of the CN bond in sulfonamides, it is reasonable to assume that their corresponding α-amino boronate esters will be highly chemically unstable; reports of such compounds are rare in the literature [16]. To gain more insight into the mechanism of this reaction, a number of deuterium-labelling experiments were carried out (Scheme 3 ). Replacement of MeOH by MeOD (99.5% D enriched) in the reaction of 6a under standard conditions, lead to selective incorporation of deuteride to the imine-carbon of 6a, affording deuterium-labelled 7a in 90% yield and approximately 93% deuterium content (Scheme 3a). The incorporation of deuterium was confirmed by 2H NMR and the % incorporation was estimated from the 1H NMR integrations of the methylene signal. This result is be consistent with methanol acting as the hydrogen donor in this reaction. In recent years, isotope labelling has drawn significant attention as an application in deuterated drugs [17], and this methodology can efficiently provide high deuteride incorporation under mild reaction conditions. Next, we employed an equal mixture of MeOH and MeOD (99.5% D enriched) to investigate the existence of any kinetic isotope effect. Compound 6t was subjected to the same reaction conditions and 7t was obtained in 88% yield and approximately 25% deuteride incorporation on the carbon (Scheme 3b). It is estimated that the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of the reaction kH/kD is approximately 3, suggesting that the O–H bond cleavage of MeOH is the rate-determining step. To further shed light on the practical use of this method, a gram-scale reaction was performed using 6a as the substrate and only 2 mol% of CuCl to obtain 7a in 91% isolated yield (Scheme 3c). Based on the above experiments and previous reports [11a,b,12,13,18], a plausible mechanism for this copper-boryl mediated transfer hydrogenation reaction is proposed in Scheme 4 . The alkoxy copper species A is first formed by the reaction of CuCl and t-BuOK. The reaction of A with B2Pin2 produces the Cu−boron complex C, which subsequently reacts with the CN bond to give the α-borylated intermediate complex D, followed by protodeborylation with methanol. To account for the differences observed in the products formed from the aromatic (6) vs the aliphatic (8) substrates, we followed the transfer hydrogenation reaction of N-sulfonyl imine 6a in the presence of nearly stoichiometric amounts of all reagents (B2pin2, CuCl and t-BuOK) by 1H NMR at room temperature (Fig. 2 ). It should be noted that the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 6a (Fig. 2) shows two sets of peaks, the smaller set of peaks belongs to the hemiaminal, which is formed from the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the imine; however, this equilibrium does not affect the progress, nor outcome of the reaction. A transient intermediate was almost immediately observed (Fig. 2; t = 0), which disappeared after approximately 4 h leading to the formation of product 7a. This observation suggests the formation of an unstable borylated species for the aromatic substrates. Although less likely, we cannot exclude the possibility of a competing mechanism involving coordination of MeOH with the Cu-Bpin compex to generate the complex E, leading to the generation of the copper hydride species F. The nucleophilic addition of the hydride to the CN double bond of N-sulfonyl imines 6 can afford the cuprate intermediate G, which upon methanol-mediated proton decupration delivers 7, with a concomitant regeneration of the active catalyst. Analogous results have been reported by Lipshutz in the Cu–H asymmetric hydrosilylation of diphenylphosphinyl imines, where the phosphinyl moiety was specifically selected in order to weaken the Cu–N bond, prior to the transmetalation step and the regeneration of the metal catalyst [19]."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, we have developed an efficient copper-boryl mediated transfer hydrogenation protocol that can provide diverse aryl/heteroaryl sulfonamides in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the utility of an inexpensive copper catalyst and a simple alcohol as the hydrogen source represent an economical and green method for this transfer hydrogenation reaction. Further optimization of this method into an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation should be possible and will be investigated in the near future."

4,General information,"4.1 General information NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, unless otherwise indicated, and chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the deuterated solvent. HRMS were obtained on a TOF instrument by electrospray ionization positive and negative modes (ESI±). The quoted masses are accurate to ±5 ppm. Completion of all reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and LCMS. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (SDS, 60 Å C. C. 40–63 mm) as the stationary phase. TLC was performed on alumina plates precoated with silica gel (Merck silica gel, 60 F254), which was visualized by the quenching of UV fluorescence when applicable (λmax = 254 nm and/or 366 nm). All starting materials purchased from commercial suppliers were used without further purification except benzaldehyde which was distilled. 4 Å Molecular sieves, 1.6–2.5 mm of particle size, were activated by flame drying for 30 s twice."

After cooling down under Ar, aldehyde (2.1 mmol), pyrrolidine (0.17 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonamide (1.75 mmol) were added, then anhydrous DCM (3 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. The reaction was filtered through a short pad of Celite and washed with EtOAc, the solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was recrystallized with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (20:80) to obtain the desired N-sulfonylimines. Due to the chemical instability of these compounds on silica gel, most were used directly after only minimal purification."
