0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be a clean fuel and energy carrier and will play an important role in the future global economy. In particular, its production is an attractive subject of current interest for fuel cell applications. In view of growing environmental concerns such as global warming and the depletion of fossil fuel, major efforts are being dedicated to develop the utilization of renewable energy resources [1–3]. Biomass is one of the most abundant renewable resources available for hydrogen production by thermo-chemical processes (pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation) or biological processes (biophotolysis, biological water gas shift reaction and fermentation) [4–6]. In recent years, various technologies have been developed about the steam reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production [7–12]. A major advantage for this process is that bio-oil is much easier and less expensive to transport than either biomass or hydrogen. Therefore, the processing of biomass and the production of hydrogen can be performed at separate locations. This approach makes the process very well suited for both centralized and distributed hydrogen production [13]. Bio-oil can be separated into two phases, oil phase and aqueous phase. The oil-phase can be upgraded by hyrotreatment or catalytic cracking for the fuel production [14,15]. The aqueous phase contains a large amount of water and various organic compounds such as acetic acid, hydroxyacetone and phenol. Discharging it without treatment not only reduces the bio-energy utilization rate, but also pollutes the environment. Two routes that are involved in the utilization of fast pyrolysis aqueous phase are, i.e., the extraction of high value compounds and the catalytic reforming for hydrogen or syngas [6,16,17]. However, the low content of each organic compound is the main factor that makes the cost of extraction technique high. On the contrary, hydrogen production via catalytic reforming can be conducted with the whole aqueous phase, and make full use of it. The aqueous phase used in the literature [17,18] for the hydrogen production was obtained by adding water to the pyrolysis liquid product to separate into two phases. In our investigation, the aqueous phase was obtained by controlling the condenser temperature during the pyrolysis process without adding more water to the liquid products. In a previous work [19], we studied the steam reforming of bio-oil over the nickel-based catalyst nickel/magnesia (Ni/MgO) in a two-stage fixed bed reactor system to overcome the carbon deposition on the catalyst and improve the hydrogen yield. In this paper, the aqueous phase was used as feedstock to investigate the hydrogen production via catalytic steam reforming in a fluidized bed reactor. The effect of reaction temperature on the carbon deposition on catalyst was also studied."
1,Experiments and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sawdust was used to produce bio-oil using a fluidized bed unit pyrolysis. A schematic flow sheet is shown in Fig. 1 . The aqueous phase product was obtained by controlling the condensation temperature below 120°C for the second condenser. Table 1 shows physical properties and elemental analysis of the aqueous phase used in this paper. The main organics of the aqueous phase were analyzed by GC/MS. GC conditions: The Column was HP-5MS (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) hold at 80°C for 3min, ramp to 300°C at 16°C/min and hold at 300°C for 15min. The carrier gas was Helium. MS conditions: Typical operating conditions were an ionization energy of 70eV and scan per second over the range of 33–500 m/z. Quantification was based on peak area percentage."
3,Catalyst,"2.2 Catalyst In this paper, commercial catalyst NiO/MgO (7.2wt.%NiO) was used produced by Wuxi QiangYa refractory material Co., Ltd. NiO/MgO was first crushed and sieved to a particle size range of 0.15–0.3mm. The catalyst was treated in H2/N2 (5vol.% H2) gas flow at 500°C for 5h prior to use."
4,Experimental apparatus,2.3 Experimental apparatus The schematic of hydrogen production process is shown in Fig. 2 . The fluidized bed is made up of stainless steel with a length 1070mm and an inner diameter 50mm. The feeding rate of the aqueous phase was controlled by a metering pump. Nitrogen was used as internal standard and its flow rate was 0.03L/min. The gas products were condensed and sampled for quantitative analysis with GC. The liquid products were collected in the liquid receiver. The catalyst weight used was 200g. The experimental temperature was controlled between 550 and 850°C and WHSV was varied from 0.6h−1 to 1.4h−1. The reactor operated as a fluidized bed at u/umf from 1.6 to 6.4. (The u/umf ratio is velocity/minimum fluidization velocity.)
5,Analysis gas products,"2.4 Analysis gas products The gas product was analyzed by gas chromatography Agilent Technologies 6820. A temperature program started from 50°C to 230°C at a heating rate 50°C/min while Argon as carrier gas flowed at 40ml/min through a 3 meter-long column. The sample was analyzed in the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at the temperature of 230°C. The column was HP-5MS (30m×0.25m×0.25μm). The following gases were measured: H2, N2, CO, CH4 and CO2."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The basic chemical formula of the aqueous phase derived from fast-pyrolysis of biomass is assumed as C n H m O k . It could be only obtained H2 and CO2 if the aqueous phase and H2O can be totally reactive. Then the maximum stoichiometric hydrogen yield can be obtained when the steam reforming reaction of the aqueous phase goes to completion as follows: (1) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → 2 n + m 2 − k H 2 + n CO 2 Hydrogen yield can be defined as Eq. (2): (2) Y 1 = n H 2 n H 2 0 × 100 % In Eq. (2), n H 2 is moles of H2 obtained and n H 2 0 is moles of H2 in stoichiometric potential; Because the water–gas shift reaction for CO is exothermic and can be easily carried out, potential hydrogen yield can be defined as Eq. (3): (3) Y 2 = n ( H 2 + CO ) n H 2 0 × 100 % In Eq. (3), n ( ( H 2 + CO ) is the number of moles of H2 and CO obtained and n H 2 0 is the number of moles of H2 in stoichiometric potential. The mole of CO (CO2, CH4) obtained to carbon in the feed is defined as CO (CO2, CH4) yield, which can be defined as Eq. (4): (4) Y c = n c n c 0 × 100 % In Eq. (4), n c is the number of moles of CO (CO2, CH4) obtained and n c 0 is the number of moles of carbon in the aqueous phase; Y c is C-containing product yield. Weight hourly space velocity of the aqueous phase (WHSV) has been defined as Eq. (5): (5) WHSV = mass flow rate of aqueous phase mass of catalyst Steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) can be defined as Eq. (6): (6) S C = moles of water in the steam + moles of water in the aqueous phase moles of carbon in the aqueous phase Carbon deposit can be expressed by Eq. (7): (7) Carbon deposition = weight of carbon deposit on catalyst weight of catalyst × 100 %"
7,Results and discussion,"Hydrogen production via catalytic steam reforming of the aqueous phase derived from fast-pyrolysis of biomass was a complicated reaction system because the aqueous phase contains various organic compounds (shown in Table 2 ). Therefore the process of hydrogen production was affected by such factors as reaction temperature, S/C and WHSV."
8,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.1 Effect of reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature (temperature varied from 550°C to 850°C), an important factor, on the experiment results was studied, the results were listed in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows that temperature plays an important role on increasing hydrogen yield and carbon product yield. From Fig. 3(a), hydrogen yield and potential hydrogen yield gave a remarkable increase within the whole temperature range and 65.8% hydrogen yield and 74.6% potential hydrogen yields were obtained at 850°C. From Fig. 3(b), it is indicated that a high temperature favors the carbon conversion to the gas product from 26.6% to 88.3%. And with the increase of temperature, C-containing product yield of CO firstly rose and then decreased. Because a low reaction temperature favors the decomposition of the organics, large amount of CO was thus generated. However, high reaction temperature promotes the water gas shift reaction and the methanation of C contribute to the elimination of CO (Eqs. (8) and (9)). It has been concluded in our previous work [19] that nickel-based catalyst Ni/MgO is effective for CH 4 conversion via Eq. (10). With the increase of temperature, CO2 conversion increases remarkably. If reaction temperature was too high, it should not be economic. Therefore reaction temperature was preferred to be near 800°C. (8) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 (9) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O (10) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H 2"
9,Effect of S/C,"3.2 Effect of S/C S/C was ranged from 4 to 16 by adjusting the steam flow rate at the temperature of 800°C. The effect of S/C is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) shows that hydrogen yield and potential hydrogen yield both increased with the increase of S/C within the range of 4–10. However, when S/C was over 10, hydrogen yield and potential hydrogen yield become nearly constant. With the increase of S/C, mass flow of stream increased and the fluidized effect of catalyst particles in the fluidized bed was better, so that the reaction of hydrogen production was favored. An excess of steam is known to be beneficial to the suppression of coking, because it leads to partial gasification of the carbon formed [7]. However, when S/C was over 10, it may be that the reaction shifted to the thermodynamic control region from the kinetic control region. Moreover, operation cost increased when S/C was more than 10. From Fig. 4(b), with the increase of S/C, each C-containing product yield showed an uptrend. According to the above analysis, S/C was preferred to be 10. Domine et al. [20] investigated the effect of the S/C ratio on hydrogen production over Pt and Rh noble metal-based catalysts. They concluded that the effect of the S/C ratio depends on the kind of metal sites of the catalyst."
10,Effect of WHSV,"3.3 Effect of WHSV WHSV was varied from 0.6 to 1.2 under 800°C and S/C of 10. Fig. 5 indicates that the results of H2 yield and C-containing product yield are achieved by adopting different WHSV. When WHSV proceeds below 1.0h−1, the results of H2 yield and C-containing product yield increased as WHSV increased. The reason could be due to the low fluidized efficiency caused by the low steam flow rate. The heat and mass transfers were limited under a low steam feeding rate. However, when WHSV was over 1.0h−1, the results of H2 yield and C-containing product yield decreased as WHSV increased. The reason was that with the increase of WHSV, mass of catalyst became less, that is to say, flow rate of the aqueous phase was so high that it could not totally reacted. Some unconverted components were condensed in the liquid collector, and the H2 yield decreased, which is in agreement with the results of Ref. [21]. When WHSV was 1.0h−1, the results of hydrogen yield, potential hydrogen yield and C-containing product yield were 64.6%, 77.6% and 84.3% respectively."
11,Amount of carbon deposit on Ni/MgO catalyst at various temperatures,"3.4 Amount of carbon deposit on Ni/MgO catalyst at various temperatures Carbon deposit not only leads to lower hydrogen yields but also causes severe catalyst deactivation. In this experiment, amount of carbon deposit on Ni/MgO catalyst at various temperatures was investigated. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the carbon deposit. Fig. 6 shows the catalyst samples taken from the tests operated at seven reforming temperatures. When the temperature increased from 550°C to 700°C, the carbon deposition obviously decreased from 4.12% to 0.95%. However, when the temperature increased from 700°C to 850°C, the carbon deposition slowly decreased from 0.95% to 0.57%. Therefore, the effect of reaction temperature was an important factor for carbon deposition. Therefore, high temperature favors the reduction of carbon deposition on the catalyst. The carbon deposition of different components in aqueous fraction was investigated in literature [22]. The results show that the carbon deposition decreases with temperature and approaches zero at relatively high temperatures. The carbon deposition is relevant to the kink of component in the feedstocks. Coke formation rates during the long-term experiments decreased in the following orders: glucose>m-xylene>acetone>ethyl acetate>ethylene glycol>acetic acid [23]. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was done to detect the carbon deposit on the catalyst including the fresh one and the one operated at 600°C, 700°C and 800°C. The analysis results were listed in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7(b) which indicates the catalyst reacted at 600°C, the carbon nanofiber was found blocking part of catalyst surface. Fig. 7(c) shows the catalyst reacted at 700°C has less part of catalyst surface blocked by carbon nanofiber. Fig. 7(d) shows that the carbon nanofiber could still be detected even when the catalyst was used at 800°C. So the results of SEM also showed that carbon deposit amount could be decreased at high temperature."
12,Conclusions,"Steam reforming of the aqueous phase of bio-oil produced via biomass fast pyrolysis is a potentially viable route for hydrogen production. Temperature, S/C and WHSV are the operating variables which affect to a great extent of hydrogen production. With the increase of temperature, hydrogen production, potential hydrogen yield, and carbon selectivity of gas product also increased. S/C increase favors the hydrogen formation and the coke gasification. The higher WHSV may cause the feedstock cannot totally reacted, the hydrogen production decreased. The optimal conditions in our experiment include the operation temperature 800°C, S/C10 and WHSV 1.0h−1. Hydrogen yield, potential hydrogen yield and C-containing product yield were 64.6%, 77.6% and 84.3% respectively at the optimal conditions."
