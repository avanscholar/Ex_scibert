0,Introduction,"Wood has been widely used as building and furniture materials for a long time because of its excellent mechanical properties, recyclability and environmental friendliness [1–4]. However, its main compositions of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and the porous structure make it extremely flammable which brings huge fire hazards [5–8]. Recently, some specified methods have been reported to improve fire safety of wood. For example, Gan et al. proposed a strategy realizing 2.8-fold enhancement in ignition time of wood by delignification and densification [9]. Studies revealed that flame-retardant coating is an efficient way to improve the fire safety of wood without sacrificing the original structure and properties of wood [10–13]. Gan et al. reported an anisotropic thermally conductive flame-retardant coating of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheet achieving 41 °C enhancement in ignition temperature [14]. Song et al. used carbon nanomaterials coating to slow the pyrolytic reaction of wood [15]. However, the process of these coated-wood is high-cost and complex, thus developing an easy-to-process and low-cost fireproof coating is very important. Hydrogel is a potential green fireproof coating material for wood due to its high content of water and nontoxic features [16–19]. Hydrogel coating can reduce the temperature of substrate by absorbing large amounts of heat through water evaporation. Moreover, hydrogel coating does not release toxic volatiles during decomposition, exhibiting no harmful influence on people's health and environment. For example, Widusha et al. developed a new class of fire-retarding materials to protect the skin of people by laminating a polyacrylamide-alginate hybrid hydrogels hydrogel and a fabric [20]. However, as an organic polymer network material, most hydrogel coating will still be burnt completely and resulting in poor flame retardancy as water evaporates. Thus, some efforts are required to improve the fire resistance of hydrogel coating before it is used on wood substrate. However, hydrogel coating shows weak adhesion to wood surface, which will deteriorate coating durability. Thus, to improve both flame retardancy and adhesion of hydrogel coating to wood substrate simultaneously is very critical. PA is an environmental-friendly and nontoxic organic acid that is easily to obtain from many plant tissues [21,22]. An outstanding feature of PA is its rich hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl) and an important flame-retardant element (phosphorus). Hydrophilic groups may ensure PA: (I) Homogeneous dispersion in hydrogel solution to form a pre-gel solution as a gelator; (II) Increasing interaction among the polymer chains within hydrogel system. (III) Enhancing interaction between hydrogel chains and wood surface groups via the hydrogen bonding [23]. High phosphorus content of PA can help to improves flame retardancy of hydrogel through promoting char formation [24–26]. It is also worth to mention that PA exhibits antibacterial characteristic in some way [27,28]. Therefore, phytic acid (PA) may be a good candidate for improving both flame retardancy and adhesion of hydrogel coating, To address that, herein, a typical hydrogel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, was chosen as hydrogel matrix. PA was introduced into PVA hydrogel system to form PVA/PA composite hydrogel. The obtained PVA/PA hydrogel was then painted on wood surface by blade coating method. Tensile test was performed to detect the adhesion of coating on substrate and its influence on mechanical properties of wood. Open fire, UL94 and cone calorimetry tests (CCT) were conducted to explore the flame retardancy of hydrogel-coated woods. The enhanced adhesion determines better durability of hydrogel coating, and the improved flame-retardant property enhances the fire safety of hydrogel-coated wood, which makes the hydrogel-coated wood an attractive candidate in architecture or furniture application."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA-350 was obtained from Macklin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). PA solution (50 wt%, in water) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The wood samples (100 × 100 × 3 mm3) were obtained from Zhixing Flagship Store (Shanghai, China). The glass sheets (76 × 26 × 1 mm3) were purchased from Qianhui Chemical Glass Instrument Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). The materials mentioned above were used as received without further purification."
3,The preparation of hydrogel-coated wood,"2.2 The preparation of hydrogel-coated wood The wood was washed by deionized (DI) water and anhydrous ethanol for several times, then dried at 60 °C for 5 min. The treated wood was used as substrate in the following experiments. 3.0 g PVA was poured into the three-neck flask, then different amount of PA was poured into flasks and DI water was added until the weight up to 33.0 g. The PVA/PA hydrogel precursor solution was obtained by heating under 95 °C with mechanical stirring for 2 h. The gel precursor solution was then applied to the surface of the wood by blading to make a 300-μm-thickness coating. Then all samples were frozen for 12 h in refrigerator at −20 °C. The other side of the wood was treated by the same method. As a result, hydrogel-coated wood could be obtained. The composition of all samples is listed in Table 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphology of hydrogel-coated wood and uncoated wood was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, Merlin, Germany Zeiss) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) system. The functional groups of PVA/PA hydrogel were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR Spectrometer, VERTEX 70, Bruker German). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ulra DLD, Britain) was used to analyze the chemical compositions of the hydrogel samples. The thermal stability of hydrogel samples was evaluated via thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, NETZSCH STA 449F3 Germany) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 and O2 flow of 60 mL min−1 from 40 to 900 °C. The stress-strain curves were obtained by a universal electronic tensile machine with a tension speed of 50 mm min−1 (Shimadzu, Japan), the size of hydrogel samples and hydrogel-coated and uncoated wood is 30 × 5 × 3 mm3 and 100 × 20 × 3 mm3, respectively. Adhesion tests were conducted via electronic tensile testing machine (Yuqing Aidebao Instrument Co., Ltd) with the contact area of 50 × 50 mm2, according to GB/T8642-2002. The samples of stress-strain and adhesion test were performed at least five times. The stripping process between hydrogel and wood was recorded by a high-speed camera."
5,Combustion behavior and heat insulation test,"2.4 Combustion behavior and heat insulation test Open fire test was performed for hydrogel-coated wood and uncoated wood by exposing samples (50 × 50 × 3 mm3) directly to propane torch flame (≈2000 °C) for 10 s. The length of propane torch was controlled about 5 cm and the angle between the sample and flame was fixed at 90°. UL-94 (CFZ-2 Analytical Instrument Company, Jiangning, China) was used to evaluate the flame retardancy of all samples, the size is 125 × 13 × 3 mm3, according to ASTM D 3801. The hydrogel-coated samples are coated completely. The CCT test was performed on a cone calorimeter (FTT, UK) at a heat flux of 35 kW m−2 with samples dimension of 100 × 100 × 3 mm3, according to ISO 5660-1. The distance between the surface of samples and the cone was 60 mm. For the heat insulation test, the hydrogel-coated wood and uncoated wood was fixed between heat source (propane blowlamp flame) and infrared camera to test the heat insulation property of hydrogel coating."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization The fabrication process of hydrogel-coated wood is shown in Fig. 1 a, including the synthesis of hydrogel precursor solution and the wood surface coating. The chains of PVA are dissociated and extend firstly, then cross-linked by PA molecular via hydrogen bonding. PA can enhance the mechanical performance of hydrogel due to the promotional gelation degree. Then the pre-gel was coated on wood via blading and put into refrigerator for 12 h to promote crystallization of PVA chains in a freeze-thaw cycle. In Fig. 1b, FTIR spectra exhibit the typical stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group for PVA-0PA hydrogel at 3447 cm−1 and PVA-15PA hydrogel at 3437 cm−1. The characteristic elements of PVA-0PA and PVA-15PA hydrogels are detected by XPS showing in Fig. 1c, the peak of C at 282 eV and O at 530 eV of PVA-15PA are significantly higher than C at 529 eV and O at 281 eV of PVA-0PA. It is worth noting that P appeared at 151 eV in PVA-15PA, compared with PVA-0PA hydrogel. Based on above analysis, it can be confirmed that PVA/PA hydrogel was prepared successfully. From SEM images in Fig. 1d, the surface morphology of pure wood is rough and porous because of the existence of large numbers of wood fibers and strip cracks. Compared with pure wood, the surface of hydrogel-coated wood samples is smoother, and no fibers and cracks can be seen on the surface, indicating that the hydrogel formed a dense and smooth coating on the wood. From the EDX of PVA-15PA hydrogel coating (Fig. S1), the phosphorus scatters in the coating completely. The cross-sectional structure of the PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood (Fig. 1g) demonstrates that the hydrogel coating combines well with the wood with a thickness of 300 μm."
8,Mechanical properties,"3.2 Mechanical properties In order to study the influence of hydrogel coating on mechanical properties of wood, the tensile tests were performed on hydrogel-coated and uncoated wood to make a comparison (Fig. 2 a). The tensile strength of pure wood, PVA-0PA, PVA-5PA, PVA-10PA, PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood is 24.5, 24.3, 24.3, 24.8 and 25.1 MPa, respectively. From the stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 2b, the wood with hydrogel coating does not change significantly compared with pure wood, indicating that the 300-μm-coating hardly affects the mechanical properties of wood, which can ensure the normal use of coated wood in construction and furniture. In addition to the mechanical properties of hydrogel, PVA hydrogel is too weak to be tested in tensile machine, while the mechanical properties of PVA/PA hydrogel increase significantly due to the addition of PA (Fig. 2c). The tensile stress of PVA-15PA can reach to 0.96 MPa. Furthermore, the water capacity is also enhanced at the same time (Fig. S1). This is because PA molecules can decline the crystallization degree of PVA chains and enlarge the space between PVA chain to improve the mechanical properties of PVA/PA hydrogel. Appreciable adhesion strength is required of hydrogel coating for widely application. The adhesion strength of PVA-0PA, PVA-5PA, PVA-10PA and PVA-15PA hydrogel of the wood is 54.18, 66.68, 89.18, and 151.68 kPa, respectively (Fig. 2e), which increased by 23.07%, 64.60%, and 179.96% comparing with the PVA-0PA hydrogel, resulting from more hydrogen bonding between hydrogel coating and wood due to the introduction of PA, as shown in Fig. 2f. The stripping process of PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood is recorded by a high-speed camera to see the details and some photos are shown in Fig. 2g. When the sample is subjected to external forces, the hydrogel coating becomes serrated. As the external force continued, the jagged teeth become larger and larger until the two woods are separated. To assess the transparency of hydrogel coatings, PVA/PA hydrogel with different content PA was applied onto glass sheet (76 × 26 × 1 mm3) to observe the letters of “SCUT” through the coated glass sheet. The photographs in Fig. 2h show that the letters of “SCUT” can be seen clearly through the hydrogel-coated glass sheet, indicating the high transparency of PVA/PA hydrogel coating. When the thickness of coating reaches 2 mm, the PVA-15PA hydrogel coating shows great antibacterial properties. PVA-0PA and PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood with 2 mm coating are wrapped with plastic film and placed indoor at room temperature, six big and two small colonies began to appear in PVA-0PA coated wood on the third day. Two days later, about 33 big colonies appeared on most of the wood surface while the PVA-15PA coated wood kept clear (seeing in Fig. S2). The results indicate that the hydrogel is endowed with antibacterial properties after the introduction of PA."
9,Combustion behavior,"3.3 Combustion behavior The propane torch flame is used to test the fire safety of pure wood, PVA-0PA and PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood. All samples (50 × 50 × 3 mm3) were exposed to the flame for 10 s, as shown in Fig. 3 a. Fig. 3b is the process of the open flame test and the photos of the char layer after burning, where we can see that none of the samples continued to burn after the propone torch removed, but the morphology and structure of char layer formed on the surface of wood are quite different. There are obvious cracks on the surface of pure wood, which make the char layer too loose to prevent the heat and flame from being transferred to the inside. The char layer of PVA-0PA hydrogel-coated wood shows only small cracks after burning and is much denser than pure wood. As for PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood, the char layer is much denser and thicker, compared with the other two samples. This is because PA could promote wood dehydration, which is beneficial for the formation of high-quality char layer during combustion. The thicker and denser char layer means PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood could further prevent external heat and flame from attacking the underlying wood, indicating great enhancement in flame retardancy of hydrogel coating. To find the suitable coating thickness, the PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood with the thickness of 100 μm, 200 μm, 300 μm are tested (Fig. S). The UL-94 was performed to further verify the flame retardancy performance of hydrogel-coated samples and the related data are listed in Table 2 . The total combustion time of all hydrogel-coated wood is less than 50 s, indicating all hydrogel-coated wood reach V0 rating. From Fig. 3c, after the first ignition for 10 s, pure wood is ignited and then burned completely. While all the samples with hydrogel coating are not ignited within the first 10 s, and they are quickly self-extinguished when they are ignited for the second 10 s. As shown in Fig. 3(d, e), PVA-0PA hydrogel-coated sample achieves fast self-extinguished behavior within 13 s at the second ignition time, and PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated sample could not be ignited during the second time. The pictures of different samples after the UL-94 are shown in Fig. S3. Therefore, PVA-15PA hydrogel coating can endow wood with highly efficient flame retardancy. CCT was conducted to better understand the burning behavior of the pure wood and hydrogel-coated woods, the main combustion parameters of CCT are listed in Table 2, and the curves of heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR) of the samples are shown in Fig. 4 (a, b). When the surface of the pure wood exposed to the heat source, combustible gas decomposed by wood released on the surface firstly, then there was a fire on the surface and many cracks appeared (Fig. S4). The combustible gas was ignited after reaching the ignition point under the heat source, and the underlying wood started to burn with an open flame. When the hydrogel-coated samples were heated at the same occasion, the water in the hydrogel coating firstly absorbed most heat and vaporized, the water vapor expanded and foamed on the surface of the samples. As heating continued, the surface coating began to carbonize with the water volatilized. White smoke appeared until there is an open flame burning. The photos of burning process of PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood can be seen in Fig. S5. As is shown in Table 2, the time to ignition (TTI) of pure wood is 63 s, while the TTI of hydrogel-coated wood are significantly increased. The TTI of PVA-0PA, PVA-5PA, PVA-10PA and PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood reaches 127, 159, 123, and 130 s, respectively, which increases by 102%, 152%, 95% and 106% compared with pure wood. This indicates that the hydrogel coating enhances the fire safety of wood effectively as longer TTI is of great importance for fire rescue. The TTI of PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood (dry) is 78 s, still 15 s longer than that of pure wood, showing that the PVA/PA hydrogel coating still acts flame-retardant performance even in case of water lost. This is because the PA is a phosphorus-containing flame retardant, whose content of phosphorus element could reach 28 wt%, which makes a positive flame-retardant effect in the condensed phase. HRR curve shows that after the samples start to burn with an open flame, the pure wood and PVA-0PA hydrogel-coated wood show the first peak, resulting from the combustible gas released by the degradation of hydrogel coating. After the surface coating charred, the char layer on the surface was cracked and the inner volatiles still fueled the fire zone, resulting in a second peak in HRR curves. The HRR curves of the PVA-5PA, PVA-10PA, PVA-15PA and PVA-15PA (dry) hydrogel-coated wood has only one peak. This maybe because PA can promote the dehydration and carbonization of wood which makes the char layer denser and thicker to resist the flame attack and the peak was formed during the carbonization in the HRR curve. For hydrogel-coated wood, the appearance time of peak of heat release rate (pHRR) is later than that of pure wood, which proves that the hydrogel coating endows wood with better thermal insulation. Compared with pure wood, the THR of PVA-0PA, PVA-5PA, PVA-10PA, and PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood reduced by 32.26%, 60.77%, 57.08% and 55.47%, respectively. Even the control sample PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood (dry) is significantly decreases by 42.96%, which is consistent with the results of the HRR. It desires to mention that the hydrogel-coated wood has higher smoke production rate (SPR) and total smoke production (TSP) than that of pure wood (Fig. S9), which result from the effect of smoldering due to the hydrogel coating."
10,Thermal properties,"3.4 Thermal properties The heat insulation performance of hydrogel coating was evaluated by an infrared camera. The hydrogel-coated side of the samples is exposed to an open fire, while the temperature of back-side is recorded by an infrared camera and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. When exposed to an open flame, the temperature of back-side of pure wood increases significantly and reaches to 150 °C at 27 s. As for hydrogel-coated samples, the temperature rises of back-fire side is obviously delayed. It is worth noting that the back-fire side temperature of PVA-0PA hydrogel-coated wood maintains at 100 °C from 35 s to 65 s. This is because with high content of water, most heat is taken away by water evaporation as the temperature increases, so that the temperature of the backside keeps at 100 °C until all the water lost. The PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated sample shows a more obviously temperature rise (53 s to 150 °C) because of less water content, but the temperature rise speed of back-side is still apparently slower than pure wood (27 s to 150 °C). These results show that the hydrogel coating possesses good thermal insulation properties to the wood, which can gain more valuable time for people in the fire scene to escape and fire rescue when a fire occurs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal gravity (DTG) curves of PVA-0PA and PVA-15PA hydrogels are displayed in Fig. 4(d, e) to examine thermal stability and the parameters are listed in Table 3 . From the results of TGA, the first inflexion of two hydrogel samples can be seen at 156.3 °C and 167.6 °C, respectively. This weight loss is due to the dehydration caused by the composition of hydroxyl groups in PVA chains [29]. The T10% of two samples appears is 273.7 °C and 156.7 °C, respectively. After that, two inflexions are observed at 356.3 °C and 445.6 °C corresponding to two distinct decomposition steps of PVA-0PA. The first temperature (T II) can be assigned to the side chain of PVA while the second temperature (T III) can be related to a decomposition of the main chains PVA [29]. As for PVA-15PA hydrogel, the loss caused at 242.0 °C also resulted from the dehydration of hydroxyl groups, but the hydroxyl groups were from PA molecules. The reasons of mass loss at 325.1 °C and 433.3 °C are the same as PVA-0PA. The maximum mass loss rate occurs when temperature rising to 604.6 °C, this is resulting from the process of thermal deposition of phytate groups in PA [30]. When the temperature reached 900 °C, the mass of the PVA-0PA hydrogel sample is only 4.09% left, while the mass of the PVA-15PA hydrogel sample is 22.61%. The results revealed that the thermal stability of hydrogel enhanced after the introduction of PA."
11,Flame-retardant mechanism,"3.5 Flame-retardant mechanism Fig. 4f explains the multiply flame-retardant mechanisms of the PVA/PA hydrogel coating. When hydrogel-coated wood encounters a fire source, the water inside the hydrogel coating is first heated to evaporate, absorbing most of the heat and reducing the surface temperature of the wood. Meanwhile, the water vapor evaporated from hydrogel coating dilutes the O2 around the sample, which creates an unfavorable environment to flame combustion. As a phosphorus-based flame retardant, PA promotes the dehydration of wood into carbon and prolong the red-hot combustion process of wood as well, then the denser and thicker char layer is formed on the surface of wood to hinder external heat and oxygen transfer. Multiple fireproof mechanisms of hydrogel coating make wood meet the fireproof requirements to serve as structural materials and ensure it has widely application."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we propose a PVA/PA hydrogel coating with enhanced flame retardancy and adhesion for wood. This coating does not affect the mechanical properties of the wood with a controlled thickness of about 300 μm, ensuring the normal use of the wood as architecture and furniture materials. The adhesion strength of PVA-15PA hydrogel coating can reach 151.68 kPa, which is increased by 180% when compared to PVA hydrogel coating. The hydrogel-coated wood shows excellent flame retardancy owing to multiple flame-retardant mechanisms, including denser and thicker char layer after exposed to the open flame for 10 s and reaching V0 rating in UL-94 test. Moreover, compared with the PVA-0PA hydrogel-coated wood, the TTI of the PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood (130 s) is increased by 3 s, the pHRR and HRR are reduced by 42.78%, and 23.14%, respectively. The THR of the dried PVA-15PA hydrogel-coated wood is still 42.96%, lower than that of pure wood, indicating the improved flame retardancy with the introduction of PA. This work shows the enhanced adhesion and flame retardant performance of PVA/PA hydrogel with the introduction of PA, which endows wood with excellent fireproof property for widely application in construction and furniture fields."
