0,Introduction,"Rapid consumption of fossil energy makes developing sustainable and environmentally friendly energy increasingly urgent. In the last three decades, solar energy, as the largest clean, safe and sustainable energy source, has attracted much attention [1–6]. However, the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy remains to be one of the critical problems prohibiting its further large-scale applications. A promising strategy is converting solar energy into the renewable chemical energy such as hydrogen fuels by photocatalytic water splitting [7–10]. Recently, numerous reports have indicated that CdS could be a good photocatalyst candidate owing to its relatively narrow band gap of ~2.4 eV and the favorable band position with strong absorption of visible light (λ > 420 nm) [3,11,12]. Many researchers focused on its preparation and photocatalytic activities. These studies demonstrate that the main drawbacks of CdS catalysts are their sever photo corrosion and the high rate of photoexcited electron-hole pair recombination, in which photo-corrosion and the later feature could induce poor stability and migrate the photocatalytic activity. Tremendous efforts have been carried out by combining CdS with various transition metals such as W, Mo, etc. as co-catalysts in order to improve the photocatalytic activity and photostability of CdS catalysts [13,14]. Among these transition metals investigated, earth abundant molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) and tungsten sulfide (WS2) are found to be excellent co-catalyst candidates [15–19]. Both have shown the exceptional optical performance due to the exposed multiple active sites at the edge of catalyst, which acted similar as noble metals such as Pt. The similar crystal structures and chemical properties of MoS2 and WS2 bring the synergistic effect when being combined with CdS simultaneously [20–23]. Recent studies have showed the superior hydrogen production activity of such ternary photocatalysts. For instance, Chang and co-workers reported the binary co-catalyst by controlling the decoration of single-layer MoS2 onto CdS [23]. Through this method, the photocatalyst achieved a high rate H2 generation. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. developed the two-dimensional (2D) CdS/WS2 heterostructures, which exhibited a high H2 evolution rate under visible light irradiation that is 8 times larger than that of pure CdS [24]. Inspired by the superiority of these two components, some researches have begun investigating the multicomponent catalysts with the high intercalations between individual components to maximize the hydrogen evolution. Reddy and co-workers composed a ternary CdS/WS2-MoS2 photocatalyst for the water splitting, which exhibited remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution performance. These studies demonstrated the importance of the synergetic effects for the efficient water photolysis process. However, the hydrogen evolution performance, especially the photostability, of these catalysts reported in literature still cannot satisfy the large-scale applications. Therefore, developing novel multi-components photocatalysts with the high stability would provide an effective avenue to optimizing the photocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a new quaternary photocatalyst of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt prepared through a facile microwave-assisted method. With the low Pt loading, the as-prepared catalyst shows the dramatic improvement in its photocatalytic activity and stability. Further, UV–vis and XPS results shed light on the possible mechanisms of performance improvement. The synergetic effects of multiple components are also studied by comparing with the hydrogen evolution catalyzed by their subset combinations. We expect that this study will help the utilization of synergistic effect to synthesize photocatalysts of high efficiency and stability."
1,Experimental section,

Absolute alcohol (C2H6O) was purchased from Hangzhou Xiaoshan Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd). Reagents referred above were all used in the preparation of catalysts, except that L-lactic acid was applied as a sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of Mo(dedc)5 samples Mo(dedc)5 samples were prepared by a simple forward precipitation method, in which 4.00 g MoCl5 were added into 220 mL absolute alcohol and stirred for 30 mins with a magnetic stirrer. 16.00 g sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate was then dissolved in the above solution and stirred continuously for 1.5 h. Purple precipitate were collected through filtration after being undisturbed for several hours, and washed for several times with anhydrous alcohol. Then solid samples were finally dried in a vacuum drying box at 60 °C for 12 h. The collected samples were grinded into power and were stored in a desiccator for further using. 2.2.2 Synthesis of W(dedc)6 samples 5.00 g WCl6 were dissolved in 220 mL anhydrous alcohol and stirred for 30 mins. Then 16.00 g sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate was added to the above solution and stirred continuously for 1.5 h. Grayish yellow precipitates were collected through filtration after being undisturbed for several hours and were washed for several times with anhydrous alcohol. Then solid samples were subsequently dried in a vacuum drying box at 60 °C for 12 h. The collected samples were grinded into power and were stored in a desiccator for further use. 2.2.3 Synthesis of CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites The CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites were prepared by mixing 0.25 g of Mo(dedc)5, 0.25 g of W(dedc)6, 0.50 g CED, and 500 mL of ethylene glycol into a 500 mL round-bottom flask. After being well mixed, the suspension was heated to 90 °C in 5 mins by a microwave method at a power setting of 200 W, and the color is changing from dark purple to light pale purple. A Shanghai SINEOMAS-I-microwave synthesizer (2450 MHz, maximum power 1000 W) was employed here. The solution was kept light pale purple at 90 °C for another 10 mins for the completed dissolution of above precursors. The heating process was then continued to make the solution reaching 160 °C in 5 mins, and the color was rapidly turned to white and transparent at around 130 °C, followed by a slow color changing to yellow, which means the decomposition and recombination of compounds. Finally, the yellow suspension was kept at 160 °C for 10 mins for the formation of CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites, and the color was gradually changed to dark yellow. Benefit from microwave-assisted method, the aimed CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites can be obtained efficiently within 30 mins. A diagram of this synthesis process can be seen in SI (Fig. S1). The final solid products were washed with ethanol several times and collected with centrifugation at 18000 rpm for 5 mins each time. The solid products were finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. 2.2.4 Synthesis of x (w %) CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt samples CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites loaded with Pt (x w%, x = 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) were denoted as CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt. Take 1.0 w% CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt sample preparation as an example, 100 mg of CdS-MoS2-WS2 solid was added into 46.4 mL ethylene glycol solution and stirred for 5 mins. Drop adding 1.33 μL H2PtCl6 solution into (3.8616 mmol/L) the above suspension. Above suspension was kept in oil bath at 90 °C. The Pt particles are produced by using 1.94 mL NaBH4 solution (0.01 g/10 mL ethylene glycol) as the reducing reagent introduced into the above solution through drop addition. The reduction reaction took place over two hours and afterwards the solution temperature went down gradually to room temperature. The resulting powders were collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 6 min, washed with ethanol three times. The products were finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h."
4,Material characterizations,"2.3 Material characterizations SEM images of the samples were taken on a Nova Nanosem 200 system. A Bruker D8 advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in the 2θ ranging from 10° to 80° was used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with a step size of 0.02°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) both were conducted on a JEOL-2100F instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Elemental mapping was performed by using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to the TEM instrument. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method was employed to calculating the specific surface areas of the catalysts by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements (Micromeritics apparatus ASAP 2020 M). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was obtained on a spectrometer from Kratos Axis Ultradld, with an Al KαX-ray resource. The binding energies were calibrated by the C1s binding energy of 284.60 eV. Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were recorded with a Shimadzu UV2550 recording spectrophotometer using BaSO4 powders as the reference."
5,Photocatalytic activities measurements,"2.4 Photocatalytic activities measurements The photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction was investigated by mixing 35.0 mg catalysts with 80 mL solution (72 mL H2O and 8 mL lactic acid as a sacrificial agent). Reactions were performed in a 250 mL sealed Pyrex flask with a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. Before irradiation, the mixture was stirred for 30 mins while the system was kept vacuumed. The above suspension was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an optical cut off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The circulating cold water kept the temperature of the system at 8 °C. The result of the amount of H2 (during 12 h) was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC7806, Beijing Shiwei Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"SEM, BET and TEM characterization","3.1 SEM, BET and TEM characterization In general, the papered materials synthesized via a facile microwave-assisted method show the uniform microstructure and size distribution. For example, the secondary CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt particles exhibit a granular-shape with protruding burrs on the surface (Fig. 1 a). On the other hand, the CdS-MoS2-WS2 particles contain much more burrs on their surface (Fig. S2) than the quaternary catalyst. CdS compound possesses an urchin-like morphology with sharp thorns sticking out (Fig. S3). The SEM images of the binary CdS-MoS2 and CdS-WS2 materials are presented in Figs. S4 and S5. Despite that there are slight changes in their morphology, the specific surface area (around 80 m2 g−1) and pore average size (around 3.50 nm) of these as-prepared catalysts remain nearly the same, as suggested by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore-diameter distribution curves. As details are provided in Fig. S6, all the catalysts display type IV isotherms with H3 typed hysteresis loops, revealing the existence of mesoporous structure. The pore-diameter distribution curves demonstrate that the main pore-size of all catalysts is centered at around 3.50 nm, further verifying the existence of mesoporous structure [25,26]. The result that these CdS-based catalysts have nearly the same specific surface area implies that the specific surface is likely determined by their backbone that is made up by the CdS, which is calculated to be the major component in the catalysts. Commonly, the high specific surface is desired to achieve significant catalytic activities. However, in this study, the loading of ultra-active Pt photocatalysts seems to play a greater role on the enhancement of H2 production, overwhelming the effects of specific surface, which could be proved by the following experiments. TEM images in Fig. 1b and 1c further demonstrate that the granular-shaped CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt are grown through the aggregation of smaller ones. Fig. 1d presented the HRTEM analysis of the area marked with the circle in Fig. 1c. The (1 1 0), (1 1 2) plane of CdS, (0 1 8) plane of MoS2, (0 0 9) plane of WS2, and (2 0 0) plane of Pt can be clearly seen. This suggests that the prepared quaternary particles consisted of CdS, MoS2, WS2, and Pt (i.e., quaternary). Element-mapping (Fig. 1e) and EDS spectrum analysis (Fig. S7) also confirm the existence of Cd (green), Mo (orange), W (yellow), Pt (pink), and S (red). The mappings also show the uniform distribution of each element."
8,XRD and XPS analysis,"3.2 XRD and XPS analysis To confirm the compositions of the prepared catalysts, we have indexed all the diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns in Fig. 2 , which showed the dominant characteristic peaks corresponding to (0 0 3) and (0 0 6) crystal facets of MoS2 and WS2, when being compared to pure CdS. It lends positive supports on the successful formation of CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites. However, Pt crystalline phases in the CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt composites are not found, which is probably due to its low content that is below the resolution of lab X-ray diffraction technique. For the CdS sample, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049) with the space group P63mc. The diffraction peaks of MoS2 and WS2 found in the XRD patterns are corresponding to hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS no. 17-0744) and hexagonal WS2 phase (JCPDS no. 35-0651). The related peaks in XRD patterns are in good agreement with the TEM results. All the components of various binary photocatalysts can also be observed in XRD results (Fig. S8) [3,27]. XPS measurements are conducted here to determine and compare chemical compositions of Cd, S, Mo, W and Pt in different samples prepared in this study. XPS survey spectrum presented in Fig. 3 f reveals the information of the chemical states of Cd, Mo, W, S, and Pt species in the fabricated CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt composites. Moreover, the surface content of Cd, Mo, W and Pt in the CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt sample is approximately 64.24 wt%, 5.14 wt%, 13.05 wt% and 9.78 wt%, respectively, according to the analyzes on XPS survey spectra. Fig. 3a–e display the high-resolution spectra of the Cd 3d, Mo 3d, S 2p, W 4f and Pt 4f regions. In Fig. 3a, the binding energies located at 411.61 eV, 404.89 eV are considered as the characteristic peaks of Cd 3d3/2, and Cd 3d5/2 of the CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt respectively, and the splitting energy of 6.70 eV between Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 confirms the presence of Cd2+ in the catalysts [27–30]. In Fig. 3b, the binding energies of 162.57 eV and 161.34 eV correspond to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, and the splitting energy between them is indicative of the presence of of S2− [25,26,31]. In Fig. 3c, the binding energies located at 233.68 eV and 230.52 eV are considered as the characteristic peaks of Mo 3d5/2, lending the evidence to the existence of Mo4+ [32,33]. The binding energy of S 2s is displayed at 225.88 eV [34,35]. The high resolution W 4f spectrum in Fig. 3d could be fitted with three sub-peaks centered at 23.63 eV, 29.91 eV, and 38.60 eV, which are attributed to the characteristic peaks of W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2, and W 5p3/2 respectively, corresponding to W4+ [5,15,36,37]. Fig. 3e displays the high resolution spectra of the Pt 4f7/2 (72.41 eV) and Pt 4f5/2 (75.68 eV), which is varied from the metallic state of Pt [38,39]. Overall, the above XPS results demonstrate that the prepared quaternary photocatalyst consists of Cd2+, Mo4+, W4+, S2− and metallic Pt. In addition, comparing to the CdS sample, the Mo 3d and S 2p peak of ternary and quaternary catalysts shifts to higher energy (Fig. 3a and b), which may be related to the decreased electronic density. Such decreased electronic density in CdS reveals the active electron transfer from CdS to co-catalysts [40–42]. Regarding the Pt signal, we have carefully checked the theoretical value of metallic state of Pt, which is Pt 4f7/2 (71.0 eV) and Pt 4f5/2 (74.4 eV). Comparing to the theoretical value of Pt, our XPS results show the shift to higher energy, indicating the electronic interaction between the composite components."
9,UV–vis DRS and PL analysis,"3.3 UV–vis DRS and PL analysis UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) is a useful measurement in observing the optical absorption of semiconductor materials [43,44]. The UV–vis DRS results of CdS, CdS-MoS2-WS2 and CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt are shown in Fig. 4 a (CdS-MoS2, CdS-MoS2 in Fig. S9), where all the materials exhibit large absorption of visible light within the wavelength range of 400–500 nm. Comparing to pure CdS, both CdS-MoS2-WS2 and CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt samples show a red shift to higher wavelength, which are presumably originated from the change of their band gaps. CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt composites have the strongest visible-light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, which may correlate to the narrow band gap of the co-catalysts (MoS2, WS2 and Pt). The narrow band gap of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt would bring more electron-hole pairs produced by visible light excitation, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic activity. To a certain extent, the superior of the amount of hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic treatment of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt might be related to such enhanced absorption of visible light. The separation efficiency of photo-induced e− and h+ on the co-catalysts were further investigated by Photoluminescence (PL) analysis [45,46]. The spectra in Fig. 4b and S10 illustrate a strong PL emission peak of CdS at 520 nm caused by the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. The weakened PL peak intensity and red shift of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt indicate the effective charge transfer between CdS and co-catalysts, which may arise from the lower recombination probability of photo-induced electrons and holes. As it is well documented, the rate of photo-induced electron transfer plays a key role in the photocatalytic water splitting, where the higher transfer efficiency of electron-hole pairs often provides the high efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the low rate of recombination of charges and efficient charge transfer in CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt promote its photocatalytic activity."
10,Photocatalytic performance,"3.4 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic activity of all five different composites and the catalysts with various ratio of Cd/Mo/W (CdS:MoS2:WS2 = 2:1:2, 5:3:2, 2:1:1, 5:2:3, 2:2:1 w/w) had been investigated in the following. As mentioned earlier, the experimental conditions are 35.0 mg catalysts powders, 72 mL deionized water, 8 mL L-lactic acid as sacrificial agent, and 300Xe lamp as light source (λ ≥ 420 nm). The reaction temperature was maintained at 8 °C. Fig. 5 a shows that the catalyst (2:1:1) exhibit the highest hydrogen production of 2.50 mmol H2 over 12 h, which is 74 times higher than that of pure CdS. Such ternary (2:1:1) catalysts combined with a low content of Pt can further increase the hydrogen evolution activity dramatically (Fig. 5a). The amount of H2 is improved up to 25.02 mmol/(h·g) with the presence of a low Pt co-catalyst comparing to 5.95 mmol/(h·g) obtained from pure CdS. When the loading of Pt is over 3.0 w%, notebly, the hydrogen evolution starts to decrease. Specifically, the samples produced only 6.53 mmol/(h·g) H2 with the loading of 4.0 w% Pt, and the integration of 5.0 w% and 6.0 w% Pt with CdS-MoS2-WS2 resulted in the further lowered activity of H2-production, yielding 2.40 mmol/(h·g) H2 and 2.15 mmol/(h·g) H2, respectively. Such an adverse impact may be caused by the covered active sites on the catalyst surface with an excessive loading of Pt. Working out from the perspective that strong enhancement of hydrogen evolution has been achieved though low loading of 3.0 w% Pt, we also tried to load 3.0 w% Pt onto the CdS, CdS-MoS2, and CdS-WS2 in order to shed light on the vital catalytic role of micro-platinum. Experiments found that all the catalysts loaded with Pt co-catalyst exhibited the improved photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) at different ratios were also different as illustrated in the 3D histogram. The maximum of hydrogen production of 31.95 mmol/(h·g) is achieved at 6 h, which is appropriately 400 times more than that of pure CdS. Such a dramatic improvement can be attributed to the effective electronic transfer from CdS to the co-catalysts due to their lower conduction bond (CB) position (MoS2, WS2) or Fermi level (Pt). During the hydrogen evolution reaction, the electronic charge carrier transferred for hydrogen production, while the generated holes trapped in the host catalyst or consumed by the sacrificial agent (L-lactic). By this way, the electron-hole pairs in the CdS can be separated more efficiently, avoiding their further recombination over photocatalytic water splitting reaction. This explains the excellent hydrogen production and photocatalytic stability of the quaternary catalysts. To investigate the stability of the prepared CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) photocatalyst, we further extended the measurement up to 100 h under visible light illumination. The results are presented in Fig. 5c and S11. The amount of H2 evolution of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) catalysts had a slight decrease from the second circle due to the consumption of the sacrificial reagent. The amount of H2 generated had a slight increase from the forth recycling test with the replenishing of lactic acid (4 mL). With addition of another 4 mL lactic acid at the end of eighth cycle, the amount of H2 rose back from the ninth circle. It is observed that at least 93% of its original activity was maintained after every circle with each cycle lasting fourteen hours. Despite the small fluctuations in the amount of H2 evolution in the 10 circles, CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) composites overall exhibited an excellent stability in 100 h photocatalytic reaction cycle. In addition, we also give the comparative analysis of morphology and structure of CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) before and after 100 h of visible light illumination. The result shown in Fig. S11 is in accordance with what has been discussed above. In Fig. 5b, the performance of the quaternary photocatalyst in this work is compared with the recently reported CdS systems [33,36,41,47–50]."
11,Photocatalytic mechanism for the H2 evolution over CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt composites,"3.5 Photocatalytic mechanism for the H2 evolution over CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt composites To illustrate the synergistic effects among these individual components, we draw a photocatalytic water splitting mechanism in the schematic diagram (Fig. 6 ), where the three co-catalysts were distributed in the specific ordering to form the heterojunction structures. Under the irradiation, the valence band (VB) electrons were excited to form photogenerated electrons. These photogenerated electrons can transfer to CB for reducing water. For the prepared quaternary catalysts in this work, the excited photogenerated electrons from CdS trend transfer to the other three co-catalysts due to their lower CB, separating the charge carriers from the electron-hole pairs. In this way, the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers can be dramatically improved, resulting in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Moreover, the holes formed by the electronic excitation are trapped in the CdS and get consumed by sacrificial agent (L-lactic), which would effectively suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully prepared various CdS-based multiple component photocatalysts by a microwave method. Notably, experiments show that the loading of a small amounts of Pt can significantly improve the catalytic activity of CdS-MoS2-WS2 composites. CdS-MoS2-WS2-Pt (3.0 w%) catalysts synthesized in this research can produce hydrogen at 300.24 mmol/g in 12 h period, which is 400 times higher than that of CdS. The high efficiency of hydrogen evolution could be kept for at least 100 h. Such great improvement is highly correlated to the unique microstructure arising from the one-step synthesis and the synergetic effects of multiple co-catalysts. The decrease of CdS electronic density leads to the more effective separation of electron-hole pairs in CdS and consequently suppresses their recombination. The amounts of hydrogen produced are therefore increased significantly."
