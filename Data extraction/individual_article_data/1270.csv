0,Introduction,"Currently, the world’s energy consumption is mainly derived from non-renewable sources such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal [1]. In Thailand, the energy consumption matrix is distributed as 45% natural gas, 36% petroleum oil, 16% lignite and coal, and 3% as renewable energy [2]. Using a high proportion of non-renewable energy resources impacts the environment through the release of greenhouse gases, which can cause climate change [3,4]. The severe consequences of these problems make increased use of renewable energy attractive. Among the renewable energy resources, hydrogen and ethanol are of great interest as replacements for petroleum fuels. Hydrogen is clean energy and generates only water as a combustion by-product [5]. The combustion of 1 g of hydrogen yield 122 kJ of energy. The energy obtained from hydrogen combustion is 2.75 times greater than petroleum fuel [6]. Ethanol is a renewable energy source that can be used in the transportation sector. The proportion of ethanol used in this sector is still increasing [7–9]. Additionally, green production processes to replace petroleum-based chemical production are of interest due to environmental concerns. 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is a valuable chemical that has several industrial applications in the textile, cosmetic, cleaning products, fragrance, resin, and personal care industries, among others. It can be used as a monomer to produce polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), polyurethane, and polyethers [10,11]. The global market for 1,3-PD is predicted to grow from 490 million USD in 2019 to 870 million USD in 2024 [12]. The growth of the market for 1,3-PD is driven by increasing demand for PTT. In the past, 1,3-PD was produced from acrolein or ethylene oxide via chemical processes [13]. However, these methods have several drawbacks, including their high costs and the need to operate under high pressures [13]. Thus, environmentally friendly approaches, such as biological processes, are more attractive than chemical methods. Several researchers investigated the biological production of 1,3-PD using glycerol as a substrate [10,11,14]. Moscoviz et al. [10], Sittijunda et al. [11], and Laura et al. [14] achieved 1,3-PD yield of 0.64, 0.30, and 0.24 mol/mol-glycerol, respectively, when using mixed cultures, anaerobic mixed cultures, and Klebsiella pneumoniae DSMZ 2026 on glycerol fermentation. Maximal 1,3-PD yield of 0.54 and 0.48 mmol/mol glycerol was attained with a reactor pH and organic loading rate (OLR) of 5.0–5.5 and 18–20 g/L-d, respectively [15]. Sittijunda et al. [11] investigated the effects of OLRs on simultaneous hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD production using an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB). Their results indicated that maximal hydrogen and ethanol production was obtained at an OLR of 50 g/L-d using crude glycerol as a substrate under mesophilic conditions. However, the biological production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol under thermophilic conditions are still limited. Biorefining is a concept where a combination of processes convert biomass into fuels and valuable chemicals [16,17]. It is not an entirely new concept because sugar, starch, and pulp and paper industries have long used this approach. However, economic and environmental drivers, such as climate change, energy and security, and high energy costs, have led these industries to examine the use of bioprocesses [16,17]. Crude glycerol is a waste by-product of biodiesel production [18]. The production of 10 kg of biodiesel gained 1 kg of crude glycerol as a by-product [6]. An increase in global biodiesel production has caused the production of crude glycerol by-product, with impacts on the environment and glycerol economy. Fermentation of crude glycerol into fuels and biochemical products through biological processes is an attractive way to address this problem [10,11,15]. Biological processes have benefits in terms of environmental friendliness and low cost. The current study aims to valorize glycerol by converting it into hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD under thermophilic conditions using a biorefining approach. The influence of OLR on hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol production from glycerol was investigated. An examination of the microbial community producing these chemicals was conducted using polymerase chain reactions with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The information obtained paves the way for continuous production of hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD from glycerol under thermophilic conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Pure and crude glycerol were used as substrates for hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol production in a UASB reactor. Pure glycerol (analytical grade) was purchased from Ajax Finechem Pty. Ltd. Crude glycerol was obtained from the biodiesel production process of the Krungtep Produce Public Company Limited (Saraburi Province, Thailand). The company processes 202.60 tonnes/month of used oil from fried chicken and sausage production processes. On average, 44,000 L of biodiesel and 4,400 L of crude glycerol are produced monthly. The chemical compositions (all in g/L) of crude glycerol were 441.3 glycerol; 230 methanol; 10 NaCl; 17.7 soap; 0.5 total nitrogen; and 0.05 total phosphorus [11]."
3,Microorganisms and cultivation,"2.2 Microorganisms and cultivation Anaerobic granules obtained from an UASB reactor were used as the seed inoculum and support material for hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol productions. This UASB reactor was used to produce methane from the wastewater of a beer production process. The UASB granules were pretreated at 100 °C for 2 h to inactivate methanogenic bacteria [6]. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the UASB granules was 32.45 g-VSS/L. A thermophilic anaerobic mixed culture was used as inoculum. They were obtained from hot spring sediment in Songkla Province, Thailand. The inoculum was prepared by growing in a blue bottle of 1,000 mL with a production medium and 25 g/L of pure glycerol as the carbon source. The production medium consists of 0.20 mL/L of Endo–nutrient solution, 0.16 g/L of urea concentration, and 3.97 g/L of Na2HPO4 concentration. Endo-nutrient contained (all in mg/L): 5,240 NH4HCO3, 125 K2HPO4, 100 MgCl2·6H2O, 15 MnSO4·6H2O, 25 FeSO4·7H2O, 5 CuSO4·5H2O, 0.125 CoCl2·5H2O, 6,720 NaHCO3 [19]. The culture was incubated for 24 h at 55 ± 4 °C in a water bath before used as an inoculum. The VSS concentration of the thermophilic anaerobic mixed culture was 16.47 g-VSS/L."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup Simultaneous production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol by a thermophilic anaerobic mixed culture was conducted in a 500 mL UASB reactor with a working volume of 450 mL. The UASB reactor contains 150 mL (2.3 g-VSS) of heat-treated UASB granules, 300 mL of the production medium containing 3.66 g-VSS of thermophilic anaerobic mixed cultures and a 25 g/L of pure glycerol as carbon source. UASB reactor was closed using a stopper, and anaerobic conditions were created by flushing it with nitrogen gas. The UASB reactor was operated at 55 ± 4 °C by recirculating warm water from a water bath through the reactor jacket. The reactor was then operated in batch mode for 48 h to establish bacterial growth and attachment. After that, it was switched to a continuous feed mode at the lowest OLR, 25 g/L-d. After reaching a steady-state, the OLR was increased from 25 to 37.5, 50, 62.5, and finally 75 g/L-d. For each OLR, the reactor was allowed to stabilize until the production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol in the effluent, along with consumption of glycerol, was constant or showed a variation of less than 10%. The pH of the fermentation broth was controlled manually by the addition of 1N NaOH to approximately 5.5. After the optimal OLR using pure glycerol was obtained, the reactor was filled with a production medium contains 25 g/L of crude glycerol as a carbon source. The determination of the appropriate OLR for hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol from crude glycerol was carried out. The OLR, which provided a maximum hydrogen production using pure glycerol as the substrate, was used as the center value for the variation of the OLRs. Biogas volume, temperature, and pH were recorded daily during operation. The volume of biogas was measured using a method of water displacement that examined the gas from an effluent bottle [11]. Liquid samples were collected to determine the concentrations of 1,3-PD, ethanol, and glycerol, as well as the concentrations of metabolic products. At a steady-state with the optimum OLRs, as well as lower and higher OLRs, granules were collected from the reactor to analyze their microbial community using PCR-DGGE."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Biogas composition, including hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 2014, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2 m stainless column packed with Unibeads C (60/80 mesh). The conditions of operation were those of Saraphirom et al. [20]. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ethanol, glycerol, and 1,3-PD in fermentation broth were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), according to Selembo et al. [21]. Briefly, one mL of fermentation broth was applied with 0.1 mL 34% H3PO4 to precipitate the lipid residues and to centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant, 0.8 mL, was acidified with 0.2 mL of 2 mol/L oxalic acid and then filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane filter. The resulting filtrate was analyzed by HPLC with the ultraviolet (UV) (210 nm) and refractive index (RI) detectors using a 7.80 × 300 mm Vertisep™ OA 8 μm column. The COD balance was carried out, as described above by Sittijunda et al. [6]. In brief, concentrations of glycerol, hydrogen, and each fermentative product were converted to the COD concentration (g-COD/L) followed the method of Haandel et al. [22]. Fermentative products included 1,3-PD, ethanol, butanol, lactic, formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The COD distribution of hydrogen and each fermentative product was calculated by multiplying the COD concentration by 100 and then divided by the COD concentration of glycerol consumed. The COD distribution for glycerol consumption was set to −100. The COD balance was calculated as follows: COD balance (%) = COD distribution of glycerol consumption + ∑ (COD distribution of fermentative products) The total genomic DNA obtained at the optimum OLR, as well as a lower and higher levels using pure and crude glycerol substrates, was extracted as described by Sambrook et al. [23]. One mL of the sample was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellets were re-suspended at 560 μL of saline-EDTA (pH 8.0). 50 mg/mL of lysozyme, 30 μL of 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 3 μL of 2% (w/v) protease K were applied to the cell pellets and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. Nucleic acid was extracted from the top of the mixture. DNA was extracted using phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol at a ratio of 25:24:1 (v/v). The top proportion was moved to the fresh tube, and DNA was precipitated by 3 M sodium acetate and 100% ice-cold ethanol. The DNA pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was washed by adding 1 mL of 70% ice-cold ethanol and recovered by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then air-dried, and the nucleic acids were dissolved in 50 μL of sterile milliQ-purified water. The extracted DNA was then amplified by a two-step PCR amplification process. Firstly, the amplification of a 1500 bp fragment of bacterial 16S rDNA was performed using a universal primer. The universal primer package was the forward primer PA19-38 (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and the reverse primer PH1541-1561 (5′-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3′). Second, the primer package of 357f with GC clamp (5′CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCGCAG-3’) and 518r (5’-ATTACCGCGCTGCTGG-3’) were used to amplify the PCR product for DGGE analysis. PCR amplification was performed in an automated thermal cycler using denaturation, annealing, extension cycle, as reported in Sreela-or et al. [24]. DGGE analysis of PCR products was performed by electrophoresis for 20 min at 20 V and 16 h at 70 V through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a linear gradient of denaturant ranging from 40% to 70% in a 0.5x TAE buffer at a constant temperature of 60 °C. The DGGE gel was stained with SYBR-Gold (1000 ng/mL) and visualized with a UV transilluminator. Bands can be excised from the gel, re-amplified with 357f without a GC clamp and 518r primer. PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea) after re-amplification. The 16s rRNA gene sequences have been identified with GenBank database searches using BLAST [25]. The amount of hydrogen produced in biogas was determined using the modified mass balance equation. In short, the production of hydrogen was determined by multiplying the hydrogen content with the total volume of production of biogas and dividing it by 100, plus the volume of production of hydrogen from the headspace. The hydrogen production in the unit of mL-H2/L was converted to the unit of mmol-H2/L by dividing with a universal gas constant (R) and temperature (Kelvin; K). R is 0.08205784 L-atm/K-mol. Glycerol consumption was determined by minus the initial concentration of glycerol (g/L) with the final concentration of glycerol (g/L). Hydrogen yield (mol-H2/mol glycerol) was calculated by dividing the amount of hydrogen production (mmol-H2/L) by glycerol consumption (mol-glycerol/L). The yield of 1,3-PD was determined by dividing the 1,3-PD production (mol/L) by glycerol consumption (mol-glycerol/L). Ethanol yield was determined by dividing ethanol production (mol/L) by glycerol consumption (mol-glycerol/L)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production performance at various OLRs,"3.1 Hydrogen production performance at various OLRs The hydrogen content and production in the UASB reactor at various OLRs using pure glycerol is depicted in Fig. 1 . Varying OLRs impacted hydrogen content, hydrogen production, and glycerol consumption. Using pure glycerol at OLRs from 25 to 62.5 g/L-d, the hydrogen content and production increased from 22.36 to 40.42% and 150–750 mmol/L (Table 1 ), respectively. The increasing hydrogen content and production were due to the microbial conversion of glycerol into hydrogen. This was indicated by an increase in glycerol consumption from 16.81 to 23.83 g/L (Table 1). Further increases in OLRs to levels higher than 62.5 g/L-d resulted in decreased hydrogen content, hydrogen production, and glycerol consumption. These decreases were caused by microbial metabolism, shifting to favor the degradation of glycerol into other products (1,3-PD) using a reductive pathway (Fig. 2 a). The conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PD via a reductive pathway did not generate hydrogen, but consumed NADH from biomass production, causing a decrease in hydrogen production [10,11,15]. This result suggested that the changes in the OLRs caused a shift of oxidative and reductive pathways during glycerol fermentation. Using crude glycerol as a substrate, the changes in OLRs from 50 to 62.5 g/L-d increased hydrogen content and hydrogen production, mirroring reports using pure glycerol (Fig. 3 ). Maximum hydrogen production and content of 457.52 mmol/L and 24.07% were obtained at an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d. The hydrogen production and content decreased to 338.92 mol/L and 18.36% when the OLR was increased to 75 g/L-d (Table 1). Hydrogen content and production using crude glycerol were lower than with pure glycerol due to inhibitors contained in the substrate [10,11,15]. Inhibitors such as salt, methanol, and fatty acids are toxic to microbes and consequently resulted in lower hydrogen production using crude glycerol [11]. The presence of NaCl caused an imbalance of water inside and outside cell membranes (osmotic pressure). A higher concentration of salt outside the cell (hypertonic environment) caused water to flow out of the cell [26,27]. Under this condition, the cytoplasmic membrane was shrinking [26,27]. Besides, a high concentration of monovalent salt decreased van der Waals strength in the lipid membrane and caused swelling of the cell membrane [28]. Methanol at concentrations of 10 g/L and higher influenced bacterial growth and activity [6,11,14]. Long-chain fatty acids disrupted the diffusion of substrate across cell membranes and affected metabolic synthesis [6,11,14]. Soap contained in crude glycerol blocked the fermentation by reducing the transport of substrate into the microbial cells. However, this was not observed during operation at high temperatures (thermophilic conditions). Therefore, crude glycerol should be pretreated using HCl to precipitate soap and fatty acids before used as a substrate to avoid these problems. The metabolic pathway of crude glycerol was altered due to the changed OLRs. At an OLR of 50 g/L-d, a reductive pathway dominated, resulting in a high 1,3-PD concentration. Lactic acid was another product obtained at this OLR (Fig. 4 ). The production of 1,3-PD, lactic acid, and propionic acid did not increase hydrogen production (Eq. (1), Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)). With an increased OLR to 62.5 g/L-d, the metabolic flux shifted from reductive to oxidative mechanisms in which high hydrogen production was obtained. Hydrogen was produced from formate by hydrogenase, which was generated by splitting pyruvate using NAD as an oxidant. One mol of hydrogen was gained when 1 mol of formate was generated (Eq. (4)). Additionally, acetate and butyrate were also formed at levels of 1 and 2 mol, respectively, from hydrogen (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [29]. With a further increase in the OLR to 75 g/L-d, the dominant pathway was oxidative, as it was with an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d, but ethanol was the main product (Fig. 4). It is suggested that at an OLR of 75 g/L-d, glycerol was converted into ethanol using NADH as a reductant (Fig. 4). Formic acid as a by-product was obtained from bioconversion of glycerol to ethanol (Eq. (7)).

HE1 as a mesophilic inoculum (345 mmol-H2/mol-glycerol) [30]. In addition, the maximum hydrogen yield obtained in this study was higher than that obtained from pure (280 mmol-H2/mol-glycerol) and crude glycerol (310 mmol-H2/mol-glycerol) using mesophilic anaerobic mixed cultures as the inoculum, respectively [21]. Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen yield (2.05 mol-H2/mol-glycerol) obtained in this study was higher than the hydrogen yield (0.25 mol-H2/mol-glycerol) reported by Chookaew et al. [31] who produced hydrogen from 20 g/L crude glycerol by thermotolerant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain TR17. These results indicated that the thermophilic operating system could increase hydrogen production efficiency."
8,"The 1,3-PD and ethanol production profile with the variation of the OLR","3.2 The 1,3-PD and ethanol production profile with the variation of the OLR 1,3-PD and ethanol production at various OLRs is depicted in Fig. 2. Using pure glycerol, 1,3-PD production of 58.07, 73.76, 88.28, 83.72, and 98.28 mmol/L was obtained at OLRs of 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d, respectively (Table 1). A maximal 1,3-PD production, 98.28 mmol/L, was obtained at an OLR of 75 g/L-d. Results showed that the 1,3-PD production increased with OLRs from 25 to 75 g/L-d (Fig. 2) suggesting that the production of 1,3-PD was dependent on substrate concentration. With increased substrate concentration, microbes favored the conversion of glycerol into 1,3-PD via a reductive pathway [10,15]. It can be concluded that changes in the substrate concentration altered microbial metabolism. During the 1,3-PD production via the reductive pathway, ethanol was also produced through an oxidative pathway. Ethanol concentrations of 39.48, 50.77, 49.75, 50.25, and 49.77 mmol/L were obtained at OLRs of 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d (Table 1). An increase in the OLR from 25 to 37.5 g/L-d resulted in increased ethanol production. Further increases in the OLRs to rates of more than 37.5 g/L-d resulted in the same ethanol concentration. Ethanol and lactic acid are produced via an oxidative pathway and 1,3-PD is produced via a reductive pathway using NADH as a reductant [10,15]. In contrast, NADH was not used for hydrogen production when formic, and acetic acids were produced as by-products [10,15]. 1,3-PD levels of 96.68, 79.52, and 71.66 mmol/L were obtained from OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using crude glycerol as the substrate (Table 1). At these OLRs, ethanol concentrations of 43.25, 48.54, and 51.08 mmol/L were obtained. Maximal 1,3-PD production was observed at an OLR of 50 g/L-d. Increased glycerol concentration resulted in higher ethanol production. In contrast, 1,3-PD production decreased with increased glycerol concentration (Fig. 2b). It can be concluded that 1,3-PD and ethanol production from both pure and crude glycerol was influenced by the substrate concentration. The maximal 1,3-PD production found using pure glycerol as a substrate, 98.28 mmol/L, was higher than when using crude glycerol (96.68 mmol/L). However, the maximum ethanol production obtained from pure glycerol was comparable to that produced using crude glycerol. It is suggested that the impurities in crude glycerol affected 1,3-PD production in the same way they did hydrogen production. This phenomenon was confirmed through microbial community analysis. It was found that the number of 1,3-PD producing bacteria (especially Klebsiella sp.) at an OLR of 50 g/L-d was higher than with OLRs of 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using crude glycerol as a substrate."
9,Effect of OLRs on microbial community analysis,"3.3 Effect of OLRs on microbial community analysis The PCR-DGGE band and relatively close species of the microorganisms at various OLRs using pure and crude glycerol are depicted in Fig. 5 . Lanes D, E, and F depict the microorganisms at OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using pure glycerol as a substrate. Lanes J, K, and L depict the microorganisms at OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d with crude glycerol as a substrate. Using pure glycerol as a substrate, Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (Band 6) and Megasphaera elsdenii (Band 8) at an OLR of 50 g/L-d simultaneously produced hydrogen and ethanol [6,32]. Enterobacter aerogenes (Band 3), uncultured Klebsiella sp. (Band 15), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Band 16) were the dominant hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD producers found at the OLR of 50 g/L-d. At an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d, simultaneous hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD production were done by Enterobacter aerogenes (Band 3) and uncultured Klebsiella sp. (Band 15), whereas Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (Band 6) was a hydrogen-producing bacterium (Table 2 ). Simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production found at this OLRs was due to Megasphaera elsdenii (Band 8), and Megasphaera indica (Band 9). A Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (Band 6) was found at an OLR of 75 g/L-d as the hydrogen-producing bacterium [6,32], whereas, an uncultured Veillonellaceae bacterium (Band 7) was a 1,3-PD producer [33]. At an OLR of 75 g/L-d, uncultured Enterobacter sp. (Band 14), uncultured Klebsiella sp. (Band 15), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Band 16) were reported as the simultaneous hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD producers [6,11,31]. The main hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD producers found at OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using pure glycerol as the substrate were the same species but differed in their band intensities. These results suggest that changes in the OLRs influence, which microbial species is dominant. In this way, the production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol at various OLRs was different. Using crude glycerol, simultaneous hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD production at an OLR of 50 g/L-d were respectively done by Enterobacter sp. (Band 27), Klebsiella sp. (Band 28), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Band 29). A Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (Band 6), Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (Band 32) [34], and Geobacter sp. (Band 33) were hydrogen-producing bacteria [35–37] at an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d. At this OLR, Megasphaera elsdenii (Band 30) was reported as a 1,3-PD, and ethanol-producing bacterium, a Caldicoprobacter sp. (Band 31) was seen as an ethanol producer under thermophilic conditions. With an increase in the OLR to 75 g/L-d, the main hydrogen-producing bacteria was Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (Band 32). At this OLR, Klebsiella sp. (Band 28) was simultaneous hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD, producer. Here, the main ethanol producers were a Caldicoprobacter sp. (Band 31) and Caloramator fervidus (Band 34) [38,39]. The main hydrogen ethanol and 1,3-PD producing bacteria under OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using crude glycerol as a substrate were different in terms of their species. This means that variations of the hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD production seen at various OLRs might have been due to changes in the microbial community. The concentration of 1,3-PD and the number of its producers, Klebsiella sp. (Band 28) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Band 29), were higher at an OLR of 50 g/L-d than at 62.5 and 75 g/L-d. The highest hydrogen production at an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d using crude glycerol as the substrate might have been due to operational conditions that enhanced the hydrogen producers. PCR-DGGE indicates that a Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (Band 6), Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (Band 32), and a Geobacter sp. (Band 33), were responsible for hydrogen production under this condition (62.5 g/L-d). Using both pure and crude glycerol as substrates, operation at various OLRs impacted the microbial community and band intensities. The results showed that the PCR-DGGE profiles and the species of microorganisms active with pure and crude glycerol were different in terms of their numbers and band intensities. The microorganisms found at OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d using pure glycerol included 8, 10, and 8 distinct species, respectively (Table 2). Using crude glycerol at these OLRs promoted the growth of 4, 6, and 5 species, respectively (Table 2). The decrease in the total number of microbial species found using crude glycerol was due to inhibition by several impurities (methanol, fatty acids, NaCl) in crude glycerol [11]. The decreased number of microbial species also reduced the production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol when using crude glycerol as a substrate (Fig. 2)."
10,COD balance and energy recovery,"3.4 COD balance and energy recovery The COD distribution and COD balance are depicted in Fig. 6 and Tables 3 and 4 . These results show that the main metabolic products produced at various OLRs were 1,3-PD, hydrogen, and ethanol. Hydrogen accounted for 10.27, 13.56, 27.73, 36.23, and 17.34% of the COD based on the consumption of a pure glycerol substrate at OLRs of 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d (Table 3, Fig. 6a). At these OLRs, distribution of 1,3-PD was 31.81, 31.99, 32.11, 32.35, and 43.98%, respectively. This result suggested that the production of 1,3-PD using pure glycerol as the substrate was affected by the initial substrate concentration. Additionally, increased substrate concentrations caused a metabolic shift toward a reductive pathway. The production of ethanol ranged from 14.56 to 16.70% (Table 3). It can be concluded that the main product from pure glycerol fermentation was 1,3-PD with hydrogen and ethanol in lower amounts. The COD balance using pure glycerol as the substrate showed 22.62, 25.90, 13.79, 10.17, and 10.05% balance. This unaccounted COD (10%) was presumably used for biomass production [40]. The COD balance of no more than 10% indicates that the analysis was accurate. The COD balance using crude glycerol as the substrate showed 11.14, 10.05, and 11.42% balance at OLRs of 50, 62.5, and 75 g/L-d (Table 4). These results confirm that the measurements and analytical methods were accurate. The main metabolic products found using crude glycerol were 1,3-PD, hydrogen, and ethanol. The distribution pattern of major and minor metabolic products (1,3-PD, hydrogen, and ethanol) using crude glycerol as a substrate was the same as with pure glycerol. However, raising the substrate concentration by increasing the OLR did not enhance the production of 1,3-PD. Using pure glycerol as a substrate at elevated concentrations caused a metabolic shift to a reductive pathway. In contrast, the microbial metabolism shifted to an oxidative pathway with an increase in the OLR from 50 to 75 g/L-d with crude glycerol as a substrate. This result indicates that changes in substrate concentration or OLR can cause metabolic changes. In general, the glycerol fermentation pathway consisted of simultaneous oxidative and reductive paths. During microbial growth, NADH was generated as a result of the reduction of glycerol to biomass. NADH was used in a reductive pathway to produce 1,3-PD and ethanol via an oxidative pathway. Concurrently, the ATP obtained from the oxidative pathway was used by microorganisms for production of biomass [10]. Moscoviz et al. [10] reported that the biological conversion of glycerol to microbial biomass consumes ATP as an energy source. In the oxidative pathway, the hydrogen production consumed NAD. One mol of formate was used to generate 1 mol of hydrogen by splitting pyruvate using NAD as an oxidant (Eq. (4)). Additionally, the generation of 1 mol of acetate and butyrate produced 1 and 2 mol of hydrogen, respectively, as a product (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [29]. Ethanol was produced via an oxidative pathway using acetyl-CoA. The conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and further conversion to the ethanol used NADH as a reductant. In the reductive pathway, glycerol was reduced to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) and then to 1,3-PD [6,10,11,15]. The consumption of NAD and NADH during hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD production changed the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Imbalance in the NADH/NAD+ ratio reflected changes of the oxidative pathway to reductive one, which resulted in the diversity of glycerol fermentation products. According to our results, the optimal OLR caused a low NADH/NAD+ ratio favoring an oxidative pathway. A non-optimal OLR caused a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio favoring a reductive pathway. Changing the OLR significantly influences the NADH/NAD+ ratio. The energy conversion efficiency from crude glycerol was calculated using hydrogen, 1,3-PD and ethanol yields at an OLR of 62.5 g/L-d, with the heats of combustion of glycerol, hydrogen, ethanol, and 1,3-PD (1674, 285, 1377, and 1859 kJ/mol, respectively) [11]. These results showed that the energy conversion efficiency for hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol was 34.87, 39.54, 17.88%, respectively. The remaining 7.71% might account for other metabolic products such as lactic, acetic, butyric, propionic, and formic acids. The energy conversion efficiency for 1,3-PD was higher than for ethanol and comparable with hydrogen. The fermentation of glycerol into 1,3-PD and ethanol consumed NADH and generated NAD in the production pathway. The high energy conversion efficiency of 1,3-PD rather than ethanol might have been due to a more energetically favorable reduction of glycerol to 1,3-PD. In contrast, hydrogen-producing bacteria utilized NAD generated from a reductive pathway to produce hydrogen."
11,COD flux tree of crude glycerol,"3.5 COD flux tree of crude glycerol A COD flux tree is used to represent COD distribution of the crude glycerol fermentation for various fermentative processes. Fig. 7 a depicts the COD flux tree of crude glycerol fermentation using thermophilic anaerobic mixed cultures at an optimal OLR of 62.5 g/L-d (This study). Fig. 7b depicts the COD flux tree of crude glycerol fermentation using an anaerobic mixed culture at a mesophilic temperature, an optimal OLR of 50 g/L-d [11]. Fig. 7c depicting the COD flux tree of crude glycerol fermentation using Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 immobilized on heat-treated UASB granules at a mesophilic temperature at an optimal OLR of 50 g/L-d [41]. At this mesophilic temperature, the anaerobic mixed cultures and immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 favored conversion of glycerol into ethanol with a COD distribution of 26.7 and 35.9%, respectively. The 1,3-PD was produced as a secondary metabolite with a COD distribution of 25.30 and 26.80% using anaerobic mixed cultures and immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 as the inoculum, respectively (Fig. 7b and c). Hydrogen production at mesophilic temperatures was quite low, with a COD distribution of 4.60 and 4.05%, respectively. In contrast, microorganisms fermented glycerol into 1,3-PD with a COD distribution of 35.60% at a thermophilic temperature. Hydrogen was produced as a secondary metabolite with a COD distribution of 25.6%, while ethanol was observed as a third product with a COD distribution of 16.30% at a thermophilic temperature. These results indicated that the COD flux tree of crude glycerol fermentation was altered with changes in the microbial strain and temperature. Additionally, at a mesophilic temperature, the microorganisms reduced glycerol into biomass and generated NADH to further use for ethanol production. The remaining NADH was used to produce 1,3-PD. At thermophilic temperature, the microorganisms reduced glycerol to 1,3-PD and generated NAD. This NAD was used to produce hydrogen. Our results showed that the dominant metabolic mesophilic pathway was oxidative followed by a less active reductive pathway. In contrast, a reductive pathway was observed as the dominant metabolic pathway at a thermophilic temperature. Therefore, to obtain a high 1,3-PD and hydrogen production from crude glycerol, the suitable temperature should be 55 °C, whereas, operating at 37 °C results in ethanol as the major product. Additionally, operation at a thermophilic temperature is more beneficial in terms of the substrate loading rate. Based on a set operational period (a day), the utilization rate of glycerol at a thermophilic temperature was higher than at a mesophilic temperature. Thus, a thermophilic condition is a promising approach to biologically convert crude glycerol into fuel (hydrogen) and value added product (1,3-PD)."
12,Conclusions,"The current study demonstrates the efficacy of thermophilic conditions to convert crude glycerol into biofuel and biochemical products. The linkages between microbial communities and product profiles were discovered at various OLRs. Analysis of microbial communities showed that the changes in OLR induced changes in the structure of microbial community. A decrease in hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol were associated with a decrease in bacterial communities. The UASB operation using pure glycerol as the substrate promoted microbial growth and activity in which production of hydrogen, 1,3-PD, and ethanol was enhanced. Additionally, there was a shift in the metabolic pathway from an oxidative to a reductive form due to the substrate concentration. However, this phenomenon was not observed when crude glycerol was used as the substrate. This was due to inhibitors such as methanol, salt, fatty acids, and soap presence in crude glycerol inhibiting the microbial activities. The proposed pathway for the thermophilic conversion of crude glycerol into fuel and value added product was reductive followed by oxidative. The distribution of COD in the flux tree using crude glycerol as a substrate at the optimal OLRs was 1,3-PD, hydrogen, and ethanol, respectively."
