0,Introduction,"While the COVID-19 pandemic held the world at standstill for most of the year 2020 [1], it was still recorded as the hottest year ever since the data recordings began [2,3]. The greenhouse emissions and environmental pollutants, that we emit today have long term effects on the earth’s environment, which necessitates an immediate response to secure and ensure inhabitable conditions for the future generations. The transportation sector itself amounts for 29% of the global greenhouse emissions responsible for elevating atmosphere’s mean temperature [4]. The over-reliance of transportation sector on the crude oil derived fuels and the slow progress in development and implementation of alternative fuel technologies can be held responsible for such numbers and conditions [5]. Crude oil is composed of hydrocarbons, and its utilisation releases profusion of pollutants having adverse effects on humans and environmental health. Diesel, a crude oil derivative, is no exception here and its combustion in IC engine produces hazardous emissions like PM, NOx, SO2, CO, CO2 and inconvenient noise and vibrations. More importantly, but vastly neglected, the combustion of diesel also produces hazardous carcinogenic emissions like formaldehydes, acetaldehydes, and other aromatic hydrocarbons, which fugitively go unchecked from various regulatory agencies but have unpropitious effect on human health. Additionally, the crude oil resources in the world are geographically limited to few countries and regions which further adds volatility to the global pricing and availability dynamics. Crude oil is a limited resource and over-reliance may lead to its untimely depletion, which presumably is going to affect the availability of other crude oil derivatives. All this strongly advocates for the importance of studying alternative fuels for the development of sustainable transportation infrastructure for subsiding reliance on petroleum. Diesel engines have carried their unscathed legacy of reliability, durability, economy and crudeness [6,7], and have a proven in long haul transportation, heavy duty machines and various earthmovers. However, diesel engines are high polluting and efforts are required to converge these attributes to low emission-signature engines for a sustainable and cleaner transport. Researchers have continuously explored various alternative fuels like natural gas [8,9], H2 [10,11], biofuels [12,13], alcohols [14,15], electricity [16] as possible replacements for present transportation fuels with an objective to reduce overall carbon footprint of transportation. Some studies have also suggested the implementation of technologies like exhaust heat recovery [17,18], exhaust gas recirculation [19,20], retardation of fuel injection timing to control the emissions and boost the system’s efficiency [21], but even these technologies need a suitable tandem to prove their effectiveness. H2 in its gaseous form is a viable option to substantially reduce the emissions from the engines. Moreover, utilisation of H2 in IC engine provides an edge over other power systems for mobility by standing on the shoulders of the high R&D intensive and mature field of IC engines [22]. H2, itself is an ultra-clean carbon-less fuel and does not emit any carbonaceous pollutants on combustion. The combustion enhancing properties of H2 such as higher diffusivity, flame velocity and broader flammability limit improves the value of H2 as an alternative fuel. Table 1 gives the comparison of fuel properties of H2 and diesel [23]. H2 has a very high auto-ignition temperature which requires high engine’s compression ratio to ignite the charge. Moreover, the poor energy density per unit volume of H2 discourages its utilisation as a single fuel. Although the production and storage options for H2 are presently seen as a major hurdle, the ongoing advancements may soon provide a viable solution for the aforementioned concerns [24,25]. Moreover, the shortcomings of H2 are complemented well by diesel and vice-versa, thus making the combination suitable for co-combustion. H2 is usually injected through intake manifold, which then mixes homogeneously with intake air due to its high diffusion coefficient. Diesel initiates the combustion due to its low compression ratio requirement and is followed by extensive burning of H2. Therefore, the utilisation of H2 in IC engines has gained significant interest by its utilisation in dual fuel engines [26,27]. The efforts to study the H2-diesel co-combustion in dual fuel engines have been significant. While the addition of H2 is suitable for reducing carbon based emission [28], engine is susceptible to knocking at higher H2 levels [29]. The combustion properties of H2 such as wide flammability limit, low ignition energy requirement and small quenching distance leads to severe knocking [30]. Juknelevicius et al. investigated the influence of H2 co-combusting with diesel on a modified 1.8 L stationary engine and found a significant increase in peak pressure at medium and higher loads [31]. They observed a combustion knock at 35% H2 replacement level for nominal load. Dimitriou et al. studied the H2 diesel combustion using in-line, 4-cylinder compression ignition engine [32]. They reported increase in the peak pressure from 6 MPa to 8 MPa with 20% addition of H2, while the peak pressure doubled with 85% H2 addition. Yilmaz and co-workers used a 4-cylinder, CRDI engine to study the effect of H2 addition to a diesel engine and reported an increase in peak in-cylinder pressure [33]. In addition to the aforementioned studies, significant pressure rise has been reported by numerous studies in the past [34]. The abrupt pressure rise is often due to the spontaneous ignition of H2 charge leading to detonation and knocking, which may lead to severe damage to engines such as cracks in cylinder head or piston rings [29]. However, a previous study from the authors’ group highlighted an important disparity at higher and lower load conditions for the peak pressure during combustion [35]. On the other hand, although EGR is well received as a potent technology for NOx reduction in complete spectra of engines, the synergy of H2 and EGR encapsulates higher potential for overall emission reduction. A recent study reported a cumulative NOx reduction of over 38% while using EGR in a H2-diesel dual fuel engine [36]. The recirculation of cooled exhaust with the fresh air into the engine leads to the increased specific heat capacity of the charge which leads to decreased combustion temperature [37]. In addition, EGR has proven effectiveness in reducing engine knocking tendency due its dilution effect [38]. However, the effect of EGR on the overall engine integrity along with its detrimental effect on emissions, other than NOx, makes it suitable to be used with H2, which can offset some of the detrimental effects. The synergistic effect of both H2 and EGR can help in enhancing the combustion characteristics of the engine along with the reduction in unregulated emissions, which fugitively goes unchecked. Zhou et al. studied the unregulated emissions from ISUZU 4HFI 4334 cc natural aspirated inline 4-cylinder engine and reported reduction in formaldehyde and aldehyde emissions with addition of up to 40% HES at lower BMEP [39]. However, at higher loads, the emissions were invariable of the HES enhancements. Further, they even reported an increase in benzene, toluene, and xylene emissions at higher loads on the addition of H2. Sharma et al. studied the unregulated emissions from a H2-diesel dual fuel engine and observed a decreasing trend for aromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde and aldehyde by increasing the H2 addition [35]. Also, in general, the unregulated emissions reduced while increasing the load in their study. In addition to these studies, only a handful of literature is available on unregulated emissions. Further, the combined effect of EGR-H2-diesel on the unregulated emissions is a key to understand the synergy between the EGR and H2 in the combustion. Therefore, the present study aims at investigating the effect of EGR enhancement on the co-combustion of H2 diesel in a dual fuel engine. The study is primarily focussed to investigate the synergistic effect of H2 and partially cooled EGR on engine combustion characteristics and unregulated emissions. The tests were conducted at two load points: 25% and 100%, whereas the H2 share was varied up to 30% based on energy replacement and EGR was varied up to 10% based on fresh air intake. The qualitative analysis of the combustion stability is carried by studying parameters like combustion duration, ignition delay, cycle to cycle variation, combustion noise and engine vibrations. Unregulated emissions, which are extremely detrimental to human health, like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and aromatic hydrocarbons are also reported for EGR- H2-diesel combustion. The reported results will contribute in improved apprehension towards the EGR enhanced H2 diesel dual fuelled engines and will help in optimizing the H2 and EGR rates for formulating the strategies for stable operation."
1,Experimental setup and procedures,"The experimental study was carried on 4-stroke, single cylinder, water cooled, naturally aspirated compression ignition engine having rated output of 5.2 kW at 1500 rpm, tailored to operate at dual fuel mode with provision to incorporate EGR operation. Fig. 1 shows the schematic line diagram of the test setup, whereas Table 2 shows the specifications of the test engine as well as that of other equipment. The details of the engine test setup have been reported in our previous work [36]. Briefly, the test engine was mounted on a universal test bed, capable to mount engines of varied dimensions, equipped with a 3-phase asynchronous vectorial servo motor connected to a variable frequency drive (VFD) and the loading was done using a programmable logic controller (PLC). The whole test setup was built around this universal test bed. The original head of the test engine was replaced with a new engine head, which was modified to incorporate the in-cylinder pressure sensor and a single axis accelerometer. The fuel line of the engine was also replaced with a new fuel line installed with fuel line pressure sensor. The performance parameters of the engine before and after the retrofitting were within the acceptable limits. Gaseous fuel - H2 was delivered from a pressurized industrial cylinder with a maximum pressure of 140 bar. The supply pressure was reduced to 3 bar, using a double stage pressure regulator and a needle valve, and flashback arrestors were installed in the gas line to enhance fire safety. The flow of the gaseous fuel was recorded using a Coriolis mass flow meter having accuracy of ± 0.5%, which utilizes Coriolis force for the measurement of mass flow. It has a fixed vibrating tube, whose vibrations are affected whenever a fluid passes through it and causes a phase shift. Based on the phase shift, the flow output is derived [40]. The standard diesel fuel was used in the experiments. Its consumption was recorded gravimetrically using a shear-beam type load cell connected to the PLC which averaged the fuel consumption data for 60 s within total error of ± 0.03%. The fresh air intake was measured using air flow meter having accuracy of 0.2%. A single hole port fuel injector (PFI) was used for the injection of H2, and it was installed at the lower side of the intake manifold at an estimated distance of 10 cm from the intake valve, using a custom built PFI holder. A rotary incremental encoder with a resolution of 0.144 CAD was mounted on the shaft, which provides 3 output signals A, B and Z for occurrence, direction of movement and indexing of reference position. The injection parameters for H2 were controlled by an in-house developed LabView based engine control and data acquisition unit. The EGR was assimilated into the cylinder by first cooling the exhaust gases in an expansion section and then fumigating it to the inlet manifold using in-house assembled stainless-steel tubing and a manually controlled mechanical valve was installed to regulate the EGR rate. The unregulated emissions were measured using a 5 Hz Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, which obtains the infrared spectrum and measured intensity over a range of wavelength. The sampling probe of the FTIR spectrometer was installed in the custom-made isokinetic sampling section installed on the exhaust line, which passes the exhaust through a preheater which maintained the exhaust temperature above 190 °C. The details of the experiment equipment used in the study are given in Table 2. For this study, the experiments were performed for the engine load 25% and 100%, i.e. the dynamometer torque of 4.89 N-m and 20.04 N-m, respectively. These loads were specifically chosen to understand the combustion behaviour at contrasting loading conditions. Further, the EGR was varied up to 10% (0, 5% and 10%) and the hydrogen energy share (HES) was varied at the discrete values of 0%, 10% and 30%. The HES was varied by controlling the needle valve, whereas the mechanical governor controlled the diesel consumption in the engine. The EGR was controlled using a valve and its quantity was estimated using the deficit in the air flow meter. In our previous investigations at HES 0%, 10% and 20%, contrasting characteristics were observed for the low and high HES [35]. Hence, alongside studying the effect of EGR, we also aim to study the effect of higher H2 addition. A total number of 36 experimental conditions were investigated for this study. The H2 injection was initiated at 14.5° aTDC and was allowed until 75.5° bBDC. The available injection window of 90 crank angle degree (CAD) (10 ms) ensured the maximum H2 to enter the cylinder with assured reliability. Required quantity of H2 at specified engine load and HES% was controlled by controlling the needle valve placed just before the injector. The start of injection (SOI) for the diesel fuel in the test engine was constant, at 23°bTDC, throughout the experiments. Fig. 2 shows the valve timing and the fuel injection timing for the test engine and the experimental setup. EGR was controlled manually using a control valve and was measured against the deficit in the fresh intake air. The HES was calculated by: HES = m ̇ hydrogen LCV hydrogen m ̇ diesel LCV diesel + m ̇ hydrogen LCV hydrogen where m ̇ hydrogen is the mass flow rate of H2, m ̇ diesel is the mass flow rate of diesel, LCV hydrogen is the lower heating value of H2 and LCV diesel is the lower heating value of diesel. The EGR rate was calculated by: EGR = V ̇ exhaust V ̇ air + V ̇ exhaust where V ̇ exhaust is the flow rate of exhaust gas and V ̇ air is the flow rate of air. The EGR was partially cooled by expanding the exhaust gas in an expansion section and avoiding any insulations material on the EGR pipes. The temperatures measured just before mixing the EGR gas with the fresh air are given in Table 3 . It is to be noted that the temperature in Table 3 does not reflect the actual exhaust temperature which is at least 6–8 times higher. Also, slight variations in temperature with hydrogen addition were noted, which have been compensated in the displayed temperature ranges in Table 3. The repeatability of the process was quantified using coefficient of variance (CoV) of Pmax and IMEP. CoV was calculated using: CoV = ∑ i = 1 N X i - X - 2 N - 1 X - where, X i is the studied parameter (Pmax and IMEP), X - is the mean value and N is the number of sampled cycles. The measurements were taken for 2000 cycles for each test condition and were initiated after all the test parameters attained stability."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Combustion characteristics,"3.1 Combustion characteristics Fig. 3 shows the variation in the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate with H2 addition at EGR levels of 0%, 5% and 10% at 25% engine load. The increase in HES levels were observed to decrease the peak pressure at 25% load. The decrease in pressure is further accompanied with the delaying peak pressure location and increase in ignition delay. This observation indicates towards poor combustion efficiency of H2, specifically at lower loads [39]. Further, heat release rate curve in Fig. 3 indicates the slowdown of the combustion peak with HES enhancement. This is due to the formation of excessive lean mixture of the gaseous fuel with air, which may be below the lean flammability limit and may not participate in the combustion due to the lower in-cylinder temperature at low loads. The typical λ at 25% load conditions was around 7.2. Additionally, H2 combustion depends on the diesel plume size, and the mixture needs to be in the entrainment zone of diesel spray. H2 ignites only when the chamber is heated sufficiently by combustion of secondary fuel - diesel. Due to its high specific heat capacity, the H2 molecule further absorbs the local heat in the combustion chamber, which further results in longer ignition delay. The poor H2 combustion also results in some H2 escaping through the exhaust as unburned fuel [41]. Fig. 4 (a) shows the effect of both HES and EGR on peak pressure and peak pressure location at engine loading 25%. Here for x-axis, L25H0E5 means 25% load with HES 0% and EGR rate 5%. With the increase in HES, the peak pressure location is observed to shift away from the TDC location on the expansion side. This can also be linked to the with the retardation in the HRR curve shown in Fig. 3. Due to the poor participation of hydrogen at lower loads, the retardation in the combustion phase is responsible for the retardation in peak pressure location. Fig. 4(b) shows the effect of HES and EGR on combustion duration and ignition delay. Addition of HES at lower loads increases the combustion duration as well as the ignition delay. The decrease in the peak HRR, along with the increase in CA50 on the addition of H2 (Fig. 4(c)) directs towards deteriorating combustion on supplementing H2 in the engine. Hence, it is evident that H2 addition tends to degrade the combustion at lower loads. EGR also has similar effects on peak pressure and tends to deteriorate the peak cylinder pressure (Fig. 4(a)). This is because EGR substitutes some portion of fresh air available for combustion and the dilution effect comes into play. The effect is cumulative at HES 30% due to excess drop in volumetric efficiency and the higher dilution because of EGR and HES. Drop of 4.5% in peak pressure can be observed between H0E0 and H30E10 cases at 25% load. However, with EGR, the ignition delay is reduced. Reduction in ignition delay can be attributed to the charge heating. Agarwal et al. also observed that charge heating due to EGR addition, and thus reducing the ignition delay [42]. The partially elevated temperature due to the EGR addition tends to increase the cylinder pressure initially and leads to rapid start of combustion. Moreover, with EGR addition, the CA50, in general, tends to shift away from the TDC, whereas the peak HRR continues to fall with the lowest HRR for L25H30E10 case. However, at 100% load (Fig. 5 ), the combustion efficiency on adding H2 noticeably improved in comparison to part load operations. The drop in the peak pressure, as in the part load cases, has diminished for this case. This is because of increasing in-cylinder temperature and bulk compressed gas temperatures, in general, at higher operating load. The ignition delay is still evident at 100% load case, however the HRR is more spread for 30% HES. However, the combustion duration sees a reduction with addition of HES, as shown in Fig. 6 (b). This clearly points towards better participation of H2 in combustion at higher loads, as due to the higher flame velocity, the combustion duration reduces. The CA50 also advances by 4° at 30% HES substitution, as shown in Fig. 6(c). At lower load, the weak combustion participation coupled with lean compositions increases the combustion duration and CA50. An increase in peak pressure can be observed for increase in HES% at 0% EGR, as the peak pressure increases from 5.687 MPa at 0% HES to 5.718 MPa at 30% HES. However, the peak pressure tends to shift away from TDC with increasing HES. However, if we compare the peak pressure locations from 25% load (where it was near to 2° aTDC) with 100% load, the peak pressures have shifted around 2˚ bTDC with minimum being at EGR 10% and HES 0%. The effects of EGR were partially deteriorating here, with peak pressure showing a decline. At HES 0%, the peak pressure fell from 5.687 MPa to 5.672 MPa, at HES 10% from 5.692 MPa to 5.660 MPa and at HES 30% from 5.718 MPa to 5.683 MPa (Fig. 6). No anomaly was found with EGR and the trends were in partial agreement with 25% load case. The only noticeable difference was that the effect of EGR on the variation of peak pressure was less and the peak pressures for HES 0%, EGR 0% and HES 30%, EGR 10% were quite similar. Therefore, importantly, the addition of HES tends to offset the decay observed on EGR enhancement. Interestingly, the peak HRR reduces on addition of H2, but the peak broadens at 100% load case, as shown in Fig. 5."
4,Cycle to cycle variation in combustion characteristics,"3.2 Cycle to cycle variation in combustion characteristics Cycle to cycle variation is a critical parameter indicating the overall engine stability and repeatability of the operation. Moreover, for dual fuel engines, it is of high importance as it gives an overview of the interaction of the two different fuels, their stability of operation and their compatibility at different test conditions. Cycle to cycle stability is of even more importance with dual fuel and EGR combined [43]. The quality of fuel injection and air fuel mixture greatly influences the cycle to cycle variation in CI engines, supposedly more for H2 induction and EGR implementation [44]. The general observation is that combustion process has high cycle to cycle variability in lean combustion at low load due to heterogenous mixture of dual fuels and air [45]. Fig. 7 shows the variation of CoV of Pmax and IMEP on HES enhancement at different EGR rates. The addition of H2 in a stock diesel engine decreases the repeatability of the operation when added to the diesel engine, and hence increases the CoV Pmax and CoV IMEP at lower as well as higher loads. This highlights the importance of design improvements of present engines but remains beyond the scope of this study. Moreover, if compared with the CoV for 100% load, the CoV at 25% load is high. It is because of the unstable combustion process at part load due to lean combustion and heterogenous mixture. Although H2 has a wider flammability limit, its combustion efficiency at low loads is a concern which has been reported in the past too [27]. The poor combustion is possibly due to the inability to support complete combustion of H2 trapped outside the diesel spray plume [46]. Combustion is more stable near stoichiometric fuelling. The weak combustion efficiency of H2 at lower loads, as reported in previous section results in partial burning of H2. Moreover, in our study, H2 was injected via port fuel injection strategy, and there is a possibility of asymmetrical induction of H2 in-between the cycles, resulting in increased CoV. This trend is replicated similar for EGR also, where the variation in the performance of EGR assisted combustion is high and increases, cumulatively, with further EGR enhancement and H2 addition. Since EGR induction and mixing is through the pumping capacity of the engine, there may be sporadic distribution of exhaust gas in the cylinder coupled, which coupled with H2 leads to high variations [47]. At 100% load case, the near stoichiometric condition (λ ∼ 3) and high bulk temperature favours the H2 combustion. The CoV of Pmax increases with both EGR and HES up to HES 10%. However, at 30% HES substitution, the CoV of Pmax tends to decrease with EGR enhancement. The addition of H2 up to 30% at full load makes the combustion stable. It can be concluded from the results that at high HES and EGR rates, the engine tends to stabilize and the repeatability increases. This is due to the improvement in the combustion efficiency of the H2 at higher loads due to higher in-cylinder temperature."
5,Vibro-acoustic characteristics,"3.3 Vibro-acoustic characteristics 3.3.1 Combustion noise Combustion noise tends to predominate over additional noise sources like injection, oil pumps, mechanical noises, valve noise etc. [48]. In our study, in-cylinder pressure sensor data was used to calculate the combustion noise [49]. In brief, the in-cylinder data, originally in the crank angle domain was converted to the time domain, followed by its conversion to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The frequency domain data was then converted to the 3rd octave spectra and A-weighted filter was applied to emphasize frequencies where human hearing is sensitive. Fig. 8 shows the effect of EGR enhancement and HES supplementation on the combustion noise. For apprehension, combustion noise variation at 25% and 100% loads are considered here. The noise levels at 25% load decreases with both EGR and HES. Although the decrease is not very sharp (0.2 dBA), the standard deviation for the combustion noise is nearly 1dBA for every case in 25% load. This is due to high cyclic variations in the dual fuel combustion and the EGR. Due to the decrease in in-cylinder pressure on addition of both H2 and exhaust gas, the combustion noise is low. Contrastingly, at high load condition, the noise level increases with HES addition, but decreases with EGR. This reassures the role of H2 in enhancing the combustion performance at high load conditions. On the contrary, the EGR leads to the decay in combustion pressure and leads to reduced combustion noise due to its role of combustion inhibitor in tested cases. 3.3.2 Engine vibration The engine vibrations affect engine performance [50], life and commuter comfort [51]. Most of the time, travelling fatigue is associated with engine’s vibration depending on exposure time and magnitude of vibration. Combustion in the engines is the principal source of vibration. Fig. 9 shows the comparison of the conventional vibration signal for motoring (fuel supply cut) and combustion case (L100H0E0) in the test setup. It is very clear from here that the combustion case has higher vibrations at near TDC location, which leads to an increase in total vibration of the engine. The other signals present at 144.5˚ bTDC, 144.5˚ aTDC and 354.5˚ aTDC represents the vibrations produced due to inlet and outlet valves opening and closing. RMS acceleration is an important parameter to represent the total acceleration magnitude for any case. Previously, researchers have investigated the effect of various fuels on the engine vibration. Calik studied the effect of H2 addition on the vibrational characteristics of a stationary engine [52]. They found that the vibrations to be lower by at least 1.5% on addition of H2 with diesel blends. Matienzo, in their recent study reported that the engine running at lower vibrations on induction of HHO, due to its positive effect on the combustion [53]. In our study, we studied the variation of RMS value of acceleration on HES enhancement and EGR at low load and high load conditions. RMS acceleration can be given by: RMS = ∑ n = 1 N a n 2 N Where, a n is the instantaneous value of the vibration and n is the number of samples acquired. Fig. 10 shows the RMS acceleration for varying EGR and HES at 25% and 100% engine load. For the 25% load, with H2 addition, the vibrations on the engine tend to decrease. The H2 shows low combustion efficiency at low loads, which leads to the decay in the vibrations. The low peak pressure and low rate of pressure rise during the combustion process leads to overall stability in terms of vibration. The acceleration decreases from 4.11 g at 0% HES to 3.78 g at 30% HES for 25% engine load. EGR addition leads to the rise in vibrations for the engine. This can be correlated with the fact that EGR leads to higher cyclic variability in the combustion, leading to the rise in vibrations. With the EGR enhancement for 0% HES, the vibration rises by 12% from EGR 0% to EGR 10%. However, for the load of 100%, with HES enhancement, the vibrations in the engine increases. Again, having an improved combustion efficiency of H2 at higher load leads to the rapid pressure rise and higher vibrations. The two light knocking cases have abnormally high vibrations in the engine. EGR addition at higher loads result in lower rise in vibration as compared to that in 25% load. Low cycle to cycle variability at higher loads can be a reason for not a substantial rise in vibrations due to EGR."
6,Unregulated emissions,"3.4 Unregulated emissions Unregulated emissions from internal combustion engines are usually emitted in low quantities and hence, do not have any regulatory limits unlike the previously studied regulated emissions [36]. However, these compounds are known to be very toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic in nature and are known to cause respiratory issues, pregnancy complications and risk to infants [54]. For investigating the effect of HES supplementation and EGR enhancement on the engine exhaust species, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and aromatic hydrocarbons were studied. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are considered as probable human carcinogen Group B1 and B2, respectively, and their inhalation lifetime cancer risk is 1.3 × 10−5 per µg/m3 and 2.2 × 10−6 per µg/m3, respectively [55,56]. Aromatic hydrocarbons, measured in this study were benzene, toluene, and xylene. Although the toluene and xylene’s data are inadequate for assessing human carcinogen potential risk, the inhalation lifetime cancer risk for benzene is 2.2 × 10−6 per µg/m3 [57–59]. 3.4.1 Formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) Fig. 11 shows the variation of HCHO and CH3CHO at various test parameters. Both these pollutants are indexed as human carcinogens and are produced during combustion of diesel. The general trend is that H2 addition reduces HCHO. HCHO is an intermediate product formed during oxidation of diesel [60]. It is affected by H2 supplementation due to the variation in OH radical concentration. The decrease in formaldehyde emission for 100% load at 0% EGR was 3% and 21.3% for HES 10% and 30%, respectively. However, with an increase in EGR rate, the formation of formaldehyde increases due to a decrease in available OH radical concentration, thus resulting in increase of HCHO formation. In case of acetaldehyde, lower HES values do not significantly lower its formation. On H2 addition, the C–H bond ratio is decreased, which causes the decrease in paraffin content resulting in the decrease of acetaldehyde. HES 30% tends to decrease the CH3CHO by a higher extent when compared with HES 10%. For 100% load and 0% EGR, the decrease in acetaldehyde emission was 8.7% and 31.3% for HES 10% and 30%, respectively. Enhancement in EGR share tends the increase the CH3CHO emissions due to enhancement in C–H bond ratio by circulating exhaust gas [61]. 3.4.2 Aromatic hydrocarbons (AHC) Fig. 12 shows the variation of aromatic hydrocarbons with varying HES and EGR. Measured aromatic compounds consist of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). The general trend shows the reduction of aromatic compounds with H2 addition. Benzene is a product of diesel pyrolysis and further grows into PAHs. H2 addition reduces the formation of diesel pyrolysis intermediates and hampers PAH formation. However, at 100% loading condition, the formation of aromatic compounds was observed to increase. The primary reason for the increment in AHC emissions is the consumption of O2, O and OH radicals. The participation of H2 in combustion is enhanced at higher loads, which leads to the consumption of oxidizing species. Zhou et al. also suggested that the consumption of O2, O and OH radicals on H2 addition has strong impact on oxidation of unregulated compounds at higher loads [39]. This phenomenon enhances the formation of aromatic compounds at higher loading conditions. The aforementioned phenomenon also holds true for EGR enhancement, the reduction in O2, leads to higher AHC formation. Fig. 13 shows the fraction of the studied unregulated emissions, CH3CHO, HCHO and AHC as the fraction of total hydrocarbon emissions (THC). For the 25% load condition, the studied unregulated emissions constitute up to 24% of the total hydrocarbon emissions. The addition of EGR worsens the unregulated emissions. However, the addition of H2 lowers the % content of unregulated emissions. At 30% HES, the share of unregulated emissions is reduced by 10%. The EGR however, increases the net share of the unregulated emissions. At the 100% load, the percent share of unregulated emissions in the THC content is much lower. At HES 0% and EGR 0%, the unregulated emissions contribute to almost half to that at 25% load. This highlights the importance of considering unregulated emissions in the regulatory norms. Considering the unregulated emissions in undiluted form, the concentrations at 25% load and 0% HES and EGR for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are ∼ 110 mg/m3 and 81 mg/m3, which exceeds the inhalation lifetime cancer risk values recommended by the US EPA. The improvements in these quantities are highly desirable to attenuate the overall risk of these emissions to human life."
7,Conclusions,"The synergistic effect of EGR and H2 supplementation on the combustion characteristics and unregulated emissions in a CI engine modified to work on dual fuel mode is studied in this investigation. The study was carried at wide range of engine loading conditions with H2 share up to 30% and EGR rate of 5% and 10%. The significant findings are: • The increase of both, HES and EGR, at part load conditions, results in deterioration of both maximum pressure and heat release rate. However, on high load conditions, H2 actively participates in combustion leading to improvement in peak in-cylinder pressure. EGR continues to deteriorate the combustion process at high loads and HES enhancement. • EGR at lower loads tends to decrease ignition delay but increases the combustion duration, whereas HES tends to increase both ignition delay and combustion duration. However, at higher loads, the ignition delay is still increased by HES addition, but the combustion duration decreases with HES addition. This is due to the high flame speed of H2. EGR decreases both ignition delay and combustion duration at higher loads. • The cycle to cycle variability of Pmax and IMEP increases with both HES and EGR enhancement, however this increase is high in low and part load conditions when compared with higher loads. • The vibrations at higher loads in single fuel engine are lower than the dual fuel engine. EGR worsens the effect and results in increased engine vibration. • The addition of H2 leads to an overall reduction in unregulated emissions. This can be majorly attributed to two reasons: participation of H2 in intermediate reactions and replacement of carbon-based fuel due to its addition. However, EGR worsens the unregulated emissions and leads to an increase in all the measured unregulated emissions: AHC, CH3CHO and HCHO. The EGR enabled H2 diesel dual fuel engine exhibits higher stability at high load conditions due to enhanced participation of H2 in combustion process. However, there is a scope of massive gains for low load operations and the future research direction should be towards exercising different H2, EGR and diesel injection strategies to attain stable combustion in the full load spectrum."
