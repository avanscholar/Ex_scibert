0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FFA) is an important fine chemical for polymer industry. It is widely used in production of various synthetic fibres, rubbers, resins, e.g., dark thermostatic resins resistant to acids, bases and resins used for strengthening ceramics. It is also used as a solvent for furan resin, pigment, varnish and as rocket fuel. One of methods of producing FFA is hydrogenating furfural (FFR) selectively [1]. Therefore the selective hydrogenation of FFR is of important significance industrially. Recently many works, chemical and biological process, concerning with the selective hydrogenation of FFR have been reported [2–5]. The catalysts used for hydrogenation of FFR are mainly supported metals [3,6–10], amorphous alloys [11–14] and so on. The Cu–Cr oxide catalyst is a familiar one that is used in most commercial processes, though the Cr-containing catalyst may cause severe environmental problems. In order to decrease the chromium content in Cr-containing catalyst rather than lower its catalytic activity, we have studied the application of TiO2-supported Adkins catalyst in selective hydrogenation of FFA in this work. These catalysts are prepared via sonochemical process. Ultrasound, based up on its frequency, is used not only in medical imaging (υ ⩾5MHz) but also in chemistry (υ =20kHz−2MHz). Sonochemistry is a very useful process for preparing novel materials with unusual properties [15], and its utilization in the synthesis of catalysts has been reported [16,17]. The prominentest advantages of catalysts prepared by sonochemistry are their high activity and nanosized particles. The drive force for sonochemistry is acoustic cavitation that is formed in liquid. During cavitation, bubble collapse produces intense localized hot spots (∼5000K) and high pressure (∼1000atm). The microjets of liquid and shockwave created by ultrasound can make great effect on solids in liquid."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals K2Cr2O7, CuAc2 ·H2O, NH3 ·H2O (22%), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (98%), graphite and acetone are all reagent grade and used without further purification. The purity of H2 and N2 gas is above 99.995%. FFR is distilled before use. Water is used after double distillation."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are recorded at ambient temperature by using a D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, 40kV, 100mA, scanning 2θ in the range of 0–80°). Hitachi X-650 and Philips EM400ST electron microscopes are used to obtain scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of catalysts, respectively. The percentage of metal element in catalysts is determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP-9000(N+M)). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are obtained by using a Micromeritics-Gemini surface area analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature. Before taking the measurement, sample is heated at 150°C in N2 atmosphere for 40min. BET surface areas are calculated from the linear part of the BET plot (p/p o =0.1−0.2). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) are recorded on a Perkin–Elmer PHI5000C electron spectrometer equipped with a Mg Kα radiation for exciting photoelectrons. The sample mounted on a sample rod is placed in a pretreatment chamber and outgassed under vacuum prior to transfer into the analysis chamber. The residual pressure in the ion pumped analysis chamber is below 1.3×10−8 torr during data acquisition. All binding energy values are calibrated by using the value of contaminant carbon (C1s=284.6eV) as a reference. Hydrogenation of FFR is carried out in a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor. First of all, the catalyst powder is mixed with graphite (5wt.%, used as binder) and ground, and then the mixture is shaped into particles (20–40 mesh) under the pressure of 20kg/cm2. About 2g of particles are packed at the center of the reactor between two plugs of quartz wool and activated or reduced in H2 atmosphere at different temperature for 5h. After activation or reduction, the reactor is cooled down to the reaction temperature and the FFR is fed into the reactor at rate of 2ml/h by means of syringe pump. The H2 flow (30ml/min) is monitored by using a rotameter. Mixture of reactant and products is collected in an ice-cold trap and analyzed every hour. The first product sample for analysis is taken after 30min of reaction. The percentage of FFR and FFA is obtained by GC (HP6890, equipped with a capillary column and H2 flame ionization detector)."
4,Synthesis,"2.3 Synthesis S 1 : K2Cr2O7 (6g) and CuAc2 ·H2O (6g) are dissolved in NH3 ·H2O (30ml) solution. The solution is kept in a thermostatic bath (65°C) under stirring. After NH3 is removed completely, the formed precipitate is centrifuged and washed two times with water and once with acetone, and then dried at room temperature under vacuum. S 2 : K2Cr2O7 (6g) and CuAc2 ·H2O (6g) are dissolved in water (20ml), respectively. Then 1ml of NH3 ·H2O is added into the solution of K2Cr2O7. Two solutions are mixed up and the mixture is sonicated for 3h by employing a direct immersion titanium horn (Sonics and Materials model VCX-600, 20kHz, 100W/cm2). The reaction cell is cooled by water at ambient temperature during the sonication process. The mixture is centrifuged after sonication. The product is washed two times with water and once with acetone, and then dried at room temperature under vacuum. S 3 , S 4 and S 5 : Samples S3, S4 and S5 are prepared in the same way of preparing S2 besides that 10, 15 and 20ml of (Me2CHO)4Ti are injected into the mixture as soon as the sonication starts, respectively. Table 1 gives preparing conditions, activities of catalysts and their selectivities towards FFA under various conditions."
5,Results and discussion,"First of all, the reactions involved in the processes of preparing catalyst should be discussed. According to the used materials and reaction conditions in the preparing processes, copper chromate is formed by reaction (1). For the as-prepared S1, due to the temperature of thermostatic bath is 65°C, the existence of CuO is impossible even though the Cu(OH)2 may form in the preparing procedure. (1) 2 Cu 2 + + Cr 2 O 7 2 - + 2 OH - → 2 CuCrO 4 + H 2 O However, the as-prepared S2, S3, S4 and S5 might contain CuO because the temperature of hot spots created by ultrasound is high enough to decompose the Cu(OH)2 that may form in the processes. A literature has reported that the thermal decomposition of CuCrO4 take place at 500°C in accordance with reaction (2) [18]. Reactions (1) and (2) are reactions involved in preparing a well-known Adkins catalyst. After as-prepared S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 containing copper chromate are heated above 500°C, the samples turn into Adkins catalyst and supported Adkins catalyst, respectively. (2) 2 CuCrO 4 → CuO + CuCr 2 O 4 + 1.5 O 2 All calcined samples in this paper must be Adkins catalyst or supported Adkins catalyst as the calcination temperature is 500°C. The data in Table 1 indicate that the as-prepared catalysts without TiO2 (S1 and S2), whether they are prepared by sonochemistry or not, show no catalytic activity at 140°C after activation and only have low activity at 170 and 200°C, respectively. However, after calcination and activation process, these catalysts exhibit catalytic activity at 140°C and the catalyst prepared via ultrasound has higher activity. The catalytic performance of TiO2-supported catalysts (S3, S4 and S5) is great different from that of catalysts without TiO2 (S1 and S2). Compared with as-prepared S2, as-prepared S3, S4 and S5 show good activity at 140°C after activation though they are all prepared in the same way. It is well known that pure copper chromate shows no activity for hydrogenation reaction and a Ref. [19] has reported that copper chromate decompose scarcely below 200°C. That pure copper chromite is not of catalytic activity for hydrogenation of aldehyde at temperature below 250°C has also been reported [20]. On the other hand, the copper–chromite oxide, which can come from the decomposition of copper chromate, is active for hydrogenation reaction after activation and metallic copper is active species in the hydrogenation of FFR [2,21]. The results of activity tests imply that the copper exists only as copper chromate in S1 and S2; however, also as other forms besides copper chromate in as-prepared S3, S4 and S5. The Cu and Cr contents and the molar ratio of Cu/Cr in calcined catalysts are listed in Table 2 . For S1 and S2, the molar ratio of Cu/Cr (Cu/Cr<1) is less than one, which means that Cu in S1 and S2 presents as copper chromate before calcination. In the case of S3, S4 and S5, the molar ratio of Cu/Cr is greater than one (Cu/Cr>1), which means that other form of copper presents in the as prepared S3, S4 and S5 besides copper chromate (Cu/Cr=1) and it is reducible at activation temperature. The reducible copper must be responsible for the catalytic activity of as-prepared S3, S4 and S5 after activation. According to their preparing processes and activity test conditions, the reducible copper should come from copper acetate impregnated in TiO2, which decomposes into copper oxide during the activation process and then copper oxide is completely reduced into metallic copper at reduction temperature [20]. The calcined catalysts show the highest catalytic activity at 140°C. As the activation and reaction temperatures increase, the conversion of FFR decreases. It is attributed to the higher temperature resulting in agglomeration of small particles in catalysts. Compared with S1, the catalytic activity of catalysts prepared by sonochemistry is more sensitive to temperature. It is ascribed to that particles in catalysts prepared by ultrasound are smaller than that in S1 and the former are affected by temperature more sensitively. Fig. 1 shows that the catalytic activity of calcined catalysts changes with the contents of Cu and Cr at 140°C. It reveals that in the case of almost identical Cu content, the catalyst S2 prepared via ultrasound has higher activity than S1. Although the contents of Cu and Cr decrease from S1 to S5, the activity of these catalysts increases. It can be affirmed that effect of sonication is one of reasons. Ultrasound, it is well known, can not only increase the dispersion of various components in catalyst but also reduce the size of particles. Despite the amounts of Cu and Cr decrease, the TiO2-supported catalysts S3, S4 and S5 have higher activity than catalyst S2. The difference in the specific surface area (SSA) is another cause that results in different catalytic activity. The specific surface area of catalysts is listed in Table 3 . The activity and selectivity of catalysts versus SSA are shown in Fig. 2 . The SSA of calcined catalysts is smaller than that of as-prepared ones. However, the catalytic activity of calcined catalysts is higher than that of as-prepared ones. After calcination (reaction (2)) the amount of reducible copper increases and certainly the amount of metallic Cu, active species, increases after activation in H2 atmosphere at 170°C. The activity of catalyst varies directly with the presence of Cu0 site in the catalysts. The more the number of Cu0 sites on the surface of catalyst, the higher its activity for the hydrogenation of FFR. Many literatures have reported interaction between metal and support and its effect on hydrogenation of carbonyl compound [22]. That the TiO2-supported catalysts behave good catalytic performance for hydrogenation of FFR profits from two advantages. The first is that the TiO2 playing role as support increases the SSA and Cu0 sites of catalysts. The second is that the defect sites at metal–TiO2 interfacial region (particularly Ti n+ Lewis acid sites or oxygen vacancies at the metal–TiO2 interface) is helpful to coordinate the oxygen atom of the CO group via lone pair of electrons and thus activate the hydrogenation of CO group [23,24]. In order to reveal the structure difference among as-prepared and calcined catalysts, the as-prepared and calcined catalysts are analyzed by XRD. XRD patterns of as-prepared (S4) and calcined (S5) catalyst in fresh and used state are shown in Fig. 3 . It is interesting to note that the reduced as-prepared S4 (Fig. 3a) shows only the diffraction peaks of graphite crystalline (JCPDS 41-1487). However, the fresh calcined S5 (Fig. 3b) shows not only the diffraction peaks of graphite but also diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272). They all show no distinct diffraction peak of CuO, Cu0, Cr2O3, CuCrO4, CuCr2O4 and so on. On the other hand, the XRD patterns of catalysts S4 and S5 (Fig. 3(c,d)) in used states are complex compared with the fresh ones. Due to the effect of ultrasound, the CuCrO4 formed in the preparing process is highly dispersed in the titania (amorphous). When CuCrO4 decomposes and the titania turns into anatase, the TiO2 prevent the CuO and CuCr2O4 particles from agglomeration, which results in that the CuO and CuCr2O4 particles are too small to be detected by XRD. It implies that the size of Cu particles in activated catalysts is very small or metallic Cu is X-ray amorphous. Fig. 4 is the XPS patterns of fresh and used calcined catalyst S5. The calibrated values of binding energy and elemental composition of surface are listed in the Table 4 . Literatures have reported that the binding energies of Cr2p3/2 for CrO3, Cr2O3 and CuCr2O4 are 579.8 [25], 576.8 [25] and 576.1eV [26], respectively. Compared with these values, the peaks at 577.3 and 577.4eV are assigned to form of Cr3+. As observed in Fig. 4, the shapes of peaks of Ti in fresh and used catalysts are similar, and the binding energies of Ti2p3/2 are 459.0 and 459.1eV, respectively, which is in agreement with the reported value of 459.0eV in TiO2 [27]. Under the experimental condition, it is difficult to reduce compound containing Ti and Cr. For example, the reduction of CuCr2O4 takes place at about 570°C [28]. However, the CuO is reducible under the experimental condition. Both of fresh and used calcined catalyst S5 have peaks at 934.0 (fresh), 933.2eV (used) and satellite peaks at ca 943eV, which indicates the presence of Cu2+ in samples [28]. Besides, the fresh sample has a peak at 931.8eV, which means the presence of Cu in low chemical valence. Here assigning 931.8eV to Cu0 is more rational, as Cu2+ (CuO) can be reduced into Cu0 completely at 170°C in H2 atmosphere [20]. The formation of Cu0 species is the foundation of activated catalyst with activity. The peaks of Cu2+ in fresh catalyst come from unreduced CuCr2O4. During the catalytic reaction, the Cu0 species turn into Cu2+ species. Compared with the surface composition of fresh catalyst S5, the metal contents on surface of used S5 decrease. There are two possibilities for that. One is that the metals run off and another one is that the carbon deposits on the surface of catalyst during the catalytic reaction. Both of them cause catalysts losing activity. The former is of priority, as the FFR is fed into reactor in liquid and the reaction temperature is lower relatively. Morphologies of the catalysts have been observed with SEM and TEM. Fig. 5 is the SEM and TEM photographs of as-prepared S4 and calcined S5 before and after reaction. As can be seen in the photos, the size and shape of particles in the fresh S4 are not uniform and the smallest particle is about 300nm. Because the fresh as-prepared catalyst S4 is not good crystal (XRD result), the observed particles are really doped X-ray amorphous tiatinia. On the other hand, the fresh calcined catalyst S5 shows different surface morphology from S4. Its particles are uniform and smaller relatively. After reaction, the surface morphology of used catalysts is not as plentiful as fresh one. It looks as something running off from the surface. The TEM photograph shows the size of particles in calcined catalyst S5 is about 30nm."
6,Conclusion,"(1) Compared with Adkins catalyst (S1) prepared by convenient method, the Adkins catalyst (S2) prepared via ultrasound has higher catalytic activity for hydrogenation of FFR. (2) The TiO2-supported catalysts (S3, S4 and S5) display good catalytic performance and the as-prepared ones, which are X-ray amorphous, exhibit activity after activation at 170°C. (3) The catalytic performance of catalyst prepared via ultrasound is sensitive to temperature, and the results of catalytic performance tests at 140, 170 and 200°C show that it has the highest activity at 140°C. (4) The catalytic activity is related to the amount of reducible Cu2+ ions in catalyst and the metallic copper surface. Metallic copper is produced by reduction of the catalyst in H2 atmosphere. The catalysts loss their activity when carbon deposits on or metal elements escape from their surface."
