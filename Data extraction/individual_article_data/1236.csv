0,Introduction,"Given its high energy density and lack of pollution emission when combusted, hydrogen has been recognized as the ideal alternative energy to fossil fuels (Zhang et al., 2017a; Kumar et al., 2015). Biological hydrogen production, with its mild processing conditions, abundant raw material sources, and low energy consumption, has attracted the attention of various researchers (Singh and Wahid, 2015; Urbaniec and Bakker, 2015). Biological hydrogen production mainly includes photo and dark fermentation (Chandrasekhar et al., 2015). Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) utilize several small-molecule volatile acids and monosaccharides in the fermented liquid, such asacetic acid, pyruvic acid, and butyric acid, as organic substrate to produce hydrogen (Pere and Nimalakhandan, 2010; Mizuno et al., 2000). Whereas, dark-fermentation bacteria decompose macromolecular organic matter into organic acids and alcohols (Barca et al., 2015; Li et al., 2010). The decomposition process provides energy and reducing power for the growth of dark-fermentation bacteria, removal of cumulative electrons, and quick release of hydrogen. Broadly speaking, the bio-hydrogen production process is an intermediate stage of methane production by anaerobic digestion; hence, the utilization rate of substrates is low. Owing of this, a certain amount of volatile fatty acids ramains in the effluent at the end of the fermentative process, which results in low energy conversion efficiency. Direct discharge of fermentative effluents causes environmental pollution (Cheng et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2008). Ozmihic and Argun investigated bio-hydrogen production by the photo fermentation of dark-fermentation effluent from ground wheat starch. The content of volatile fatty acids in the dark-fermentation effluent decreased significantly during the photo-fermentative reaction (Ozmihci and Kargi, 2010; Argun et al., 2008). Therefore, dark-fermentation effluent can be effectively utilized as the substrate for photo fermentation bio-hydrogen production (Silva et al., 2015; Dahiya et al., 2015). The effluent can also be utilized as a carbon source for the culture of microbes (Chi et al., 2011). Combined dark- and photo-fermentation bio-hydrogen production has been demonstrated by several studies (Tawfik et al., 2014; Rai et al., 2014). Ghimire et al. (2016) used dark-fermentation effluent as the substrate to produce hydrogen from photo-fermentation, and then poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), resulting in 80% COD removal. In recent times, single-stage processes that are a hybrid of dark and photo fermentation are gaining attention. First, dark-fermentation bacteria consume complex organic substrates, and then the volatile fatty acids byproducts are utilized by PSB. Temperature, pH, and effluent rate all have significant influence on hydrogen production; the total hydrogen output under optimum conditions increase by up to four times (Zagrodnik and Laniecki, 2015; Ngoma et al., 2011). Yeshanew et al. (2016) integrated the systems of continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and anaerobic fixed bed reactor (AFBR) to evaluate the bio-hythane (bio-H2+CH4) yield from food waste; HRT and effluent recirculation rate were investigated, and optimal parameters were obtained. Short HRT was found good for bio-hydrogen yield, and recirculation of the AFBR effluent provided alkalinity to the whole system, which maintained the pH in a suitable range for the growth and metabolism of the hydrogen producing bacteria. Several factors such asa nature of substrate, microbial consortium, and reactor configuration influence the process of bio-hydrogen and subsequent bio-methane production from waste biomass by dark fermentation technology (Liu et al., 2013). Methanogenic archaea grow slowly and are a vulnerable microbial group. Given that methanogenic archaea can utilize volatile fatty acids as substrates, the methane production process can be the final stage in the anaerobic fermentation process (Aydin et al., 2015). Some scholars have conducted the bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production process from cow dung, waste water, starch-rich biomass, and etc. (Intanoo et al., 2014; Reungsang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2008). However, little research has been done using fallen leaves (Song et al., 2010). As the main street tree in China, the annual leaves production of Platanus Orientalis reaches ten-million tones. The common treatment methods of fallen leaves are landfill, burn, and compost. The energy consist in the leaves is not being fully utilized, and the combustion of leaves may cause the environmental pollution. Given that fallen leaves consist of cellulose and hemicellulose, which can be utilized for fermentation (Zhang et al., 2014, 2017b; Li et al., 2017). Hence, using fallen leaves as the raw material for fermentation helps recycle waste biomass, bringing about clear environmental benefits. When combining the diverse fermentative pathways, the organic matter in the fermented liquid can be maximally utilized, and the energy conversion efficiency can be improved greatly. Arimi et al. (2015) found the production of methane to have higher energy recovery than that of hydrogen. Hence, it can be suggested that a process that combines fermentative bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production has the potential for the highest energy recovery (Nasr et al., 2012). Moreover, the combination of dark fermentation and methanogenesis improves the energy conversion efficiency to 23.1% (Cheng et al., 2012). Hence, in this study, for the efficient utilization of biomass and maximum energy conversion efficiency, Platanus Orientalis leaves were taken as the substrate to evaluate the energy conversion efficiency of bio-methane and bio-hydrogen coproduction. We believe that understanding the energy recovery from this fermentation process will enhance the overall energy conversion efficiency of anaerobic biological treatment plants."

9,Hydrodynamic analysis,"2.8 Hydrodynamic analysis The kinetics parameters of hydrogen production of two-stage dark and photo fermentation bio-hydrogen production from Platanus Orientalis leaves were determined by using the modified Gompertz model as following formula (1): (1) P H 2 ( t ) = P max exp - exp r m e P max ( λ - t ) + 1 where, PH2 (t) is cumulative hydrogen yield (mL), Pmax is the maximum hydrogen yield potential (mL), rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is lag time (h), t is fermentation time (h), e is 2.718. The dynamics formula (2) of the gas producing rate was obtained through the differential formula (1): (2) v H 2 ( t ) = dP H 2 ( t ) dt = r m exp 2 + r m e P max ( λ - t ) - exp r m e P max ( λ - t ) + 1"

Q leaf is the heat value of the Platanus Orientalis leaves, 18636.38J/g. m is the weight of the dry biomass matter, g."
11,Results and analysis,
12,Kinetic analysis of hydrogen production,"3.1 Kinetic analysis of hydrogen production A modified Gompertz model (equation 1) was used to analyze the fermentative hydrogen production process of Platanus Orientalis leaves. A nonlinear regression equation was used to directly fit nonlinear least squares. Using a sample method, we calculated the sum of the squares of the parameter minimums and obtained the parameters Pm , Rm and λ using iterative estimation with a convergence criterion of 10−6. The fitting results and parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 , respectively. As shown in Table 1, the fitting of hydrogen production using a modified Gompertz equation achieved an R2 (correlation coefficient) value greater than 0.99, suggesting that the fitting results are good. The actual amounts of hydrogen produced by photo-fermentation and dark fermentation were 368.81mL and 312mL, respectively, and the predicted maximum hydrogen production values were 362.93mL and 295.49mL, respectively. The delay period of hydrogen production by dark fermentation is 1.65h, while the delay period of hydrogen production by light fermentation is 3.69h. This discrepancy may be because the bacteria participating in dark fermentation can more quickly adapt to the fermentation environment and begin producing hydrogen. Using the fitted parameters in formula 2, the hydrogen production rate of photo-fermentation and dark fermentation can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows that photosynthetic hydrogen production is primarily concentrated in the peak period between 0 and 48h; at this stage, hydrogen production accounts for approximately 82% of the total volume of hydrogen available. Dark hydrogen production is primarily concentrated in the peak period between 0 and 36h; at this stage, hydrogen production accounts for approximately 83% of the total volume of hydrogen available. Bacteria can adapt to a dark fermentation environment more quickly than a photo-fermentation environment and thus can quickly enter a logarithmic growth phase. Peak hydrogen production therefore occurs faster in a dark fermentation environment. During the fermentation process (48–84h), growth reaches a dynamic balance; the number of additional bacteria produced is equal to the number of dead bacteria. Although the number of species involved is relatively large, the reducing sugar content in the fermentation liquid decreases as it is consumed in earlier stages, and less hydrogen is produced in later stages."
13,Changes in reaction liquid composition during hydrogen-producing photosynthetic fermentation,"3.2 Changes in reaction liquid composition during hydrogen-producing photosynthetic fermentation Changes to the proportions of ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid components in the reaction solution during the process of photosynthetic hydrogen fermentation are shown in Fig. 4 . Before 24h, ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid concentrations increase over time. Photosynthetic bacteria self-synthesize the enzyme required for their metabolism to adapt to their environment, and enzymatic hydrolysis causes polysaccharide solutions to decompose into monosaccharides and small molecule acids during this process. Therefore, the concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid at 24h reach their highest values of 2366mg/L and 1228mg/L. From 24h to 36h, acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations are greatly reduced, which corresponds to the peak stage of hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacterial fermentation with fast photosynthetic hydrogen production and fast metabolic substrate consumption. The concentration of butyric acid reaches its highest value of 1248mg/L at 36h. After 36h, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid decrease gradually, and the concentration of ethanol increases throughout the process of hydrogen production. With the decrease in the concentration of small molecule acids and the increase in the concentration of ethanol, the hydrogen production rate gradually decreases. After 72h, almost no gas was produced. When the concentration of small molecule acids in the fermentation liquid falls below a certain level, or the lactic acid and ethanol concentrations in the fermentation liquid increase, the photosynthetic ability of hydrogen producing bacteria is greatly reduced or eliminated. At the end of the reaction, the concentrations of acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, and ethanol were 624mg/L, 422mg/L, 558mg/L, and 866mg/L, respectively. The cumulative amount of hydrogen produced was 368.8mL."
14,Liquid composition changes during dark fermentation,"3.3 Liquid composition changes during dark fermentation The anaerobic sludge used for the enzymolysis of Platanus Orientalis leaves in dark fermentation and the compositions of the liquid phase are shown in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5, during dark fermentation hydrogen production, acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, and ethanol concentrations gradually increase. In dark fermentation, bacteria obtain energy and the reducing power needed to maintain their growth through the decomposition of large organic molecules into small molecular organic acids and alcohols. This metabolic process releases hydrogen through electron accumulation. As seen in Fig. 5, the hydrogen production rate increased greatly from 5h to 12h, and the small molecule acid concentration was relatively high. As hydrogen production progresses, the concentration of small molecule acids that are unusable by bacteria participating in dark fermentation gradually increases and the fermentation environment gradually changes. In addition, as hydrogen production progresses, hydrogen inhibitors are produced and hydrogen metabolism is inhibited. Therefore, after 36h, no hydrogen production was observed. At the end of fermentation, the acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, and ethanol concentrations were 2966mg/L, 1624mg/L, 1365mg/L, and 1352mg/L, respectively, and cumulative hydrogen production was 312mL."
15,Methane production using fermentation effluents,"3.4 Methane production using fermentation effluents The total gas content, hydrogen content, and methane content produced through the methane production and hydrogen production processes by photo- and dark fermentation were analyzed. The results are shown in Table 2 . Table 2 shows that, during photo fermentation, the total amount of gas generated was 645mL. Gas phase analysis shows the composition of this gas to be 368.8mL hydrogen and 0mL methane. During dark fermentation, the total amount of gas generated was 650mL, composed of 312mL hydrogen and 0mL methane. During methane-producing fermentation using photo fermentation effluents, the total amount of gas generated was 680mL, of which methane accounted for 55.43% (377mL) and hydrogen accounted for 7.35% (50.09mL). During methane-producing fermentation using dark fermentation effluents, the total amount of gas generated was 920mL, of which methane accounted for 60.43% (556.08mL) and hydrogen gas accounted for 7.07% (64.07mL). The above data show that, in the effluents of fermentative hydrogen production, small molecular organic acids, alcohols, and organic compounds are used by methane-producing bacteria to effectively produce a large amount of methane. Methane-producing bacteria can also utilize the dead bacteria present in effluents."
16,Energy conversion efficiency analysis,"3.5 Energy conversion efficiency analysis Using formula (3) and related data, we calculated the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen production using Platanus Orientalis leaves fermentation and of methane production using effluents from fermentative hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the energy conversion efficiencies of photo-fermentation bio-hydrogen production and dark fermentation bio-hydrogen production are 5.1% and 4.3%, respectively, which is insufficient for industrial applications, and less of competitiveness. Hence, the cogeneration of hydrogen and methane is investigated to enhance the energy conversion efficiencies. The differences between the single hydrogen energy output and co-production of bio-hydrogen and methane are shown in Fig. 6. Methane production using Platanus Orientalis leaves photofermentation effluents and using dark fermentation effluents are 15.17% and 22.28%, respectively, indicating that the effluents contain unconverted energy. Therefore, hydrogen production through photo- or dark fermentation combined with methane production will greatly increase the energy conversion efficiency of Platanus Orientalis leaves fermentation. In particular, the energy conversion efficiency of the combination of photofermentation hydrogen production and methane production is 20.27%, which is 3.97 times the efficiency of simple photofermentation hydrogen production. The energy conversion efficiency of the combination of hydrogen production using dark fermentation and methane production is 26.58%, which is 6.18 times the efficiency of simple hydrogen production using dark fermentation. The obtained results are similar with the previous research (Cheng et al., 2012; Su et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2013). From the comparison of the results obtained using the experimental groups (Combination of photo fermentation hydrogen and methane production; Combination of hydrogen production using dark fermentation and methane production) and control groups (photo-fermentative hydrogen production and in the dark fermentation hydrogen production), the increasing energy conversion efficiency by cogeneration of hydrogen and methane are easily observed."
17,Conclusions,"The effluents of Platanus Orientalis leaves photo- and dark-fermentation contain large amounts of volatile organic acids and ethanol. Methane production using effluents from Platanus Orientalis leaves fermentation can greatly improve the energy conversion efficiency of the fermentation process. In particular, the energy conversion efficiencies of methane production using Platanus Orientalis leaves photo fermentation effluents and using dark fermentation effluents are 15.17% and 22.28%, respectively. These results show that the fermentation model established in this study, which combines hydrogen production and methane production, can significantly improve the energy conversion efficiency of anaerobic biological treatments."
