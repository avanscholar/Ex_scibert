0,Introduction,"So far, conventional energy supply has caused serious environmental problems, for this reason, more attention has been paid to low carbon economy which is characterized by low energy cost, reduced emission, and zero pollution [1]. These problems, such as rising price of fossil fuel and global environmental deterioration, have motivated researchers to develop an efficient and clean energy technology to substitute fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emission [2–4]. Among them, fuel cell has been widely investigated as it possess several advantages such as reliability, stability, safety, lower operating cost and reduced pollution emissions [5]. Hydrogen production from alcohols can provide an effective and clean energy source for fuel cell, which can minimize our dependence on oil and therefore enhance global economy and reduce environmental pollution [6–8]. In the power industry, hydrogen fueled gas turbine energies have been proposed as a possible replacement for conventional gas turbine energies, primary for the benefit of less formation of nitrogen oxides and less fuel expenditure. Hydrogen combustion does not produce toxic products such as hydrocarbon, oxides of sulfur, carbon monoxide or organic acids. Instead, its main product is water. Given the effect of global warming, an important advantage of hydrogen combustion is that carbon dioxide is not formed at all [9,10]. As one of the alcohols in common use, ethanol is a renewable source and it can be generated from agricultural residues and fermentation of surplus [9]. Compared to other hydrocarbons, the advantages of ethanol include broader flammability limits, higher flame speeds, higher heats of vaporization and higher compression ratio. Ethanol is an oxygenated fuel that contains 35% oxygen, which decrease particulate and NOX emissions from combustion process [11,12]. The technologies of ethanol reforming can be divided into catalytic [13–15], plasma [16,17] and plasma-catalytic method [18]. At present, various kinds of catalysts have been studied for their improvement on alcohol reforming. It has been found that some of the catalysts, such as Co/ZnO, ZnO, Rh/Al2O3, and Ni/La2O3–Al2O3, have favorable performances [2]. However, the utilization of catalytic method is limited by several problems such as low product, high metal capacity and the reactor size. And lower temperature in catalytic reaction could lead to the formation of methane, ethylene and other light hydrocarbons, which will decrease syngas yield [19,20]. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the reaction temperature to more than 700°C so as to obtain a high hydrogen yield and conversion rate. In contrast, plasma has been considered as a promising technology as it has obvious advantages over catalysts such as high energy density, high temperature effect and high product yield. According to the way how energy is deposited into the gas stream, plasma can be divided into thermal and non-thermal plasma. Some researchers employed thermal plasma or non-thermal plasma to investigate hydrogen production out of hydrocarbons or alcohols and obtained high conversion rates [21–23]. Bromberg et al. [18] combined GEM3 plasma reactor with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst to investigate the reforming performance, obtaining a higher conversion rate and hydrogen selectivity. Wang et al. [24] investigate hydrogen production by stream reforming of ethanol, achieving a hydrogen yield of 31.8% and corresponding ethanol conversion rate of 88.4% with ethanol flow rate of 0.18ml/min and water–ethanol ratio of 13.3. Roy et al. [25] employed radio frequency and catalyst to study the performance of ethanol reforming, attaining a reforming efficiency of 72–90% and major gaseous products of H2, CH4, CO and CO2. Non-thermal plasma reforming has some advantages over catalytic or thermal technology including near instantaneous start-up time, lower energy cost and high productivity. An alternative to the high power thermal arc systems is a kind of transitional non-equilibrium plasma, also known as gliding arc. Gliding arc is a kind of automatic oscillation discharges, starting as thermal arc plasma, and it is elongated by the gas flow or magnetic field and extinguished after it turn into non-thermal arc plasma. Gliding arc can be viewed as non-thermal arc plasma because the temperature of translational gas is in the scope of 2200–2500K, which is between the temperature of cold plasma (300K) and thermal plasma (⩾10,000K). At present, gliding arc discharge has been widely investigated in pollution removal, energy combustion, and surface treatment [26–28]. Nunnally et al. [29] studied H2S dissociation in a non-equilibrium gliding arc “tornado” (GAT) plasma discharge, obtaining an energy cost of 1.2eV per H2 molecule, which is particularly important for oil industry. Du et al. [30] carried out studies on the degradation of acid orange 7 by gliding arc discharge plasma in combination with advanced Fenton catalysis, observing that the rate constants for the process of GAD ZVI were increased by 30% and 19%, respectively, compared with the process of GAD and the process of GAD with ferrous. Njoyim et al. [31] employed pure-gas gliding arc discharge to purify wastewater. Kamgang-Youbi et al. [32] confirmed that gliding arc discharge plasma had considerable improvement in water sterilization. Non-thermal arc can produce effective plasma with high productivity and good selectivity. Some of the best reforming results in terms of fuel conversion and low energy cost for syngas production have been demonstrated using gliding arc discharge reactor with a vortex flow scheme [33,34]. Rueangjitt et al. [35] investigated the performance of non-oxidative reforming of methane in a mini-gliding arc discharge reactor, observing that the dominant products were C2H2 and H2. Du et al. [11] employed a plasma reactor named Laval nozzle discharge (LNDA) to investigate the ethanol reforming results with O/C ratio of 0.6–2.0, S/C ratio of 0.8–4.0 and fuel flow of 0.6–2.0 at atmospheric pressure, observing that the maximum conversion rate of ethanol could reach 90% in certain conditions. Additionally, to increase the conversion and the energy efficiency of plasma reactor, a lot of research efforts have been devoted to improve the structure of plasma reactors. In this paper, a modified reactor based on previous studies was used to improve the reaction process and the reforming performance. In general, the miniaturization of typical reactor would be a challenge for onboard reforming systems, and the formation of coke may lead to the short curt of in reactor. In our work, these two problems are effectively solved using a novel miniaturized non-thermal plasma reactor. In addition, the advantages of the device are as follows: (1) The reactor can produce non-thermal plasma with high electron density (>1014 cm3) and strong electric field (>104 V/m). The active species generated in the plasma are useful in ethanol conversion and hydrogen production. (2) The rotation of arc discharges enlarges the reaction volume and provides a non-equilibrium distribution of energy (mostly goes to electrons). (3) The special design of Laval nozzle facilitates the generation of discharges in a supersonic/subsonic gas stream, which could benefit the hydrogen production and the reduction of nitrogen oxides. (4) Little coke deposited on the inner wall of reactor because of the swirling flow, therefore discharges between the Teflon shell and the electrodes were effectively avoided. As a result, the plasma reactor displays excellent security and stability. In our work, the steam-oxidative reforming of ethanol by a novel non-thermal arc discharge was investigated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature without pre-heating. Compared to other conventional discharges, the non-thermal arc discharge in our experiments combines the advantages both 3-D cylindrical “tornado”-type and the supersonic/subsonic discharge."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup Fig. 1 shows the schematic of experimental setup for ethanol reforming. In the reforming system, the plasma reactor was powered by a high voltage AC power supply equipped with a neon transformer with a nominal voltage of 10kV and a maximum allowable current of 30mA. A voltage regulator was used to stabilize the voltage and current in the circuit. In addition, we employed an oscilloscope with a high voltage probe (Tektronnix P6035) and a current probe (Tektronix TP301A) to analyze the variation of the voltage and the current in the circuit. The structure of the minimized arc discharge reactor in the experiments was detailed in Fig. 2 , which is equipped with a Laval nozzle with a length of 95mm, 2mm-diameter throat and a flange on the top and the button, respectively. The central screw nail with a length of 95mm and a diameter of 10mm is made of copper and has a pointed tip on one end. The Laval nozzle acts as an outer electrode while the central screw nail acts as an inner electrode. The minimum distance between two electrodes is 0.54mm, and the inner diameter and the outer diameter of annular section where the reactant passed through are 2mm and 1.46mm, respectively, thus the area of the annular section is 5.87mm3. The discharge reactor is made of stainless steel. Besides, the reactor is earthed for security. The reaction chamber in the plasma reactor can be divided into three main regions: (a) the mixing region, (b) the discharge region and (c) the post discharge region. The entire process for product gas generation and collection is described as follow: the air stream was transported through four central symmetric orifices, forming a vortex gas flow. In the experiments, ethanol–water mixture entered the reaction chamber through a special gas–liquid spray nozzle embedded in one orifice for a quick evaporation and a rapid mixing with air at room temperature. The flow rates of ethanol and water were kept at constant values by peristaltic pumps. The atomized ethanol flowed into the mixing region where electrical breakdown occurred due to a high voltage applied to the two electrodes, and then entered the discharge region in the form of high-speed whirl. Due to an abrupt contraction of the narrow space in the nozzle, the mixture flow could become a subsonic stream or even a supersonic stream. A large number of plasmas and various active particles (high-energy electrons, highly reactive radicals and excited molecules) came into being in the discharge region and reacted with ethanol–water mixture, generating a variety of products such as H2, CO, C2H4, C2H6, C2H2, CO2, CH4 and so forth. Liquid products were accumulated in a collector and determined by a QP2010s GC–MS (Shimadzu) and a DB-5MS capillary column The liquid products included trace CH3COOH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3, however, unreacted ethanol and water were the major components. The exhaust gas was analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC-950, Haixin) and TESTO 350 gas analyzer. The plasma discharges can induce a variety of ionization, excitation, and dissociation reactions. For an ethanol molecule, the bond energy of C–C, C–O, C–H, and O–H are 3.606eV, 3.783eV, 4.302eV and 4.824eV, respectively. In addition to ethanol, feedstock mixture includes water, nitrogen, and oxygen. For a water molecule, its excitation energy is between 7.4 and 9.98eV, and the ionization energy and bond breakage energy is 12.6eV and 5.15eV, respectively. In addition, the dissociation energy and ionization energy of nitrogen is 9.8eV and 15.5eV, respectively, and the excitation energy is between 6.17 and 8.4eV. The excitation of an oxygen molecule requires energy between 0.997eV and 4.5eV. In conclusion, compared to water molecules and nitrogen, oxygen and ethanol molecules are easier to be decomposed. The chemical reactions between oxygen and ethanol can be expressed as below: Partial oxidation reaction of ethanol: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 1 / 2 O 2 → 2 CO + 3 H 2 Δ H = + 20 kJ / mol Complete oxidation reaction of ethanol: (2) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O Δ H = - 1280 kJ / mol Adding water to plasma-assisted ethanol reforming has great potential to achieve higher conversion and hydrogen selectivity. Wang et al. [24] observed that the addition of water was beneficial for hydrogen production and ethanol decomposition. In the presence of H2O, ethanol can be oxidized to hydrogen and carbon monoxide by steam reforming, following this pathway: (3) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → 2 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H = + 256 kJ / mol The steam reforming is strongly endothermic and requires a heat source to raise the reaction temperature to achieve high conversion [5]. The water gas shift reaction (4) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = - 40 kJ / mol has a favorable hydrogen equilibrium, which can increase H2 production and reduce CO production. The auto-thermal reforming of ethanol can be described as: (5) C 2 H 5 OH + 2 H 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 5 H 2 Δ H = - 50 kJ / mol In the case of plasma reforming of ethanol, as a result of plasma-induced electron impact excitation, hydroxyl radicals and oxygen radicals are produced during the excitation of water. The reactions are as below: (6) e - + H 2 O → H - + OH, 5.7 eV (7) e - + H 2 O → O - + H 2 , 4.9 eV where the ionized oxygen radical can reacts with water molecules to produce hydroxyl radical. (8) O - + H 2 O → HO - + HO These active species play an important role in accelerating the reforming process and reduce energy barriers. In addition, the thermal decomposition (or pyrolysis) also play a critical part in reforming reaction. The mechanism of ethanol decomposition proposed by Petitpas et al. [16] can be expressed as: (9) CH 3 CH 2 OH → CH 3 CH 2 O + 1 / 2 H 2 (10) CH 3 CH 2 O → CH 3 CHO + 1 / 2 H 2 (11) CH 3 CHO + O → CH 3 COO + 1 / 2 H 2 (12) CH 3 CH 2 O → CH 4 + CO + 1 / 2 H 2 (13) OH + CH 3 COO → CH 4 + CO + O"
3,Calculation,"2.2 Calculation In the experiments, the mixed feedstock included air, water and ethanol. These reactants participated in a series of complicated reactions and were converted into various products such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons. As a significant parameter to analyze the oxidation degree of hydrocarbons, O/C ratio is the molar ratio between oxygen atoms in the air and carbon atoms in the ethanol. Similar to O/C ratio, S/C ratio refers to the ratio of molar flow rate of H2O versus the molar flow rate of the fuel carbon. In our work, various experiments with different O/C ratios and S/C ratios were conducted to study their influence upon reforming performance. (14) O C ratio = 2 n O 2 2 n EtOH (15) S C ratio = n H 2 O 2 n EtOH To investigate the influence of experimental conditions on ethanol reforming, various experiments were carried out by varying O/C ratio, S/C ratio and ethanol flow rate. The parameters matrix is shown in Table 1 . In the case of ethanol reforming assisted by non-thermal arc discharge, the ethanol conversion can be described as: (16) χ = n EtOH input - n EtOH ouput n EtOH input × 100 % where n EtOH input refers to the mass of ethanol entered the reforming reactor; n EtOH output refers to the mass of unreacted ethanol which included unreacted ethanol in the exhaust gas and that collected by gas condenser. To make assessments on the steam-oxidative reforming performance of ethanol, H2 yield, CO yield, H2 selectivity and CO selectivity are introduced. The parameters mentioned above can be expressed as: (17) H 2 yield ( % ) = n H 2 output 3 n EtOH output (18) CO yield ( % ) = n CO output 2 n EtOH output (19) H 2 selectivity = H 2 yield × χ (20) CO selectivity = CO yield × χ"
4,Results and discussion,
5,V–I characteristic,"3.1 V–I characteristic In the experiments, the V–I characteristic of non-thermal arc discharge was measured for describing the evolution of arc discharge and corresponding ionization degree. With an oscilloscope to record the variation of voltage and current, these separate experiments were conducted at different ethanol flow rates and air flow rates. The period of the arc evolution sequence strongly depends on the gas composition, gas flow rate, and applied voltage (or input power) [36]. The variations of voltage and current play a significant part in plasmas generation and evolution, thus in the performance of ethanol reforming. The V–I characteristic during two discharge cycles was presented in Fig. 3 . Due to the convection interference in the arc burning process, the positive and negative half cycles of the V–I characteristic curve are not totally symmetrical [37]. In general, the V–I characteristic can be divided into four different phases according to ionization degree, which are described as below: (a) No ionization phase: the voltage increases greatly without significant current variation, suggesting that there is no ionization in this phase. No ionization phase is the end of the arc extinguishing, followed by the generation of a new arc and new cycle. As the voltage increases to the critical value UB , an electric breakdown occurs and arc filaments are generated. This value is also known as breakdown voltage, which is characterized by transition from no ionization phase to the next phase. (b) Full ionization phase: the generation of electric breakdown leads to a short and intense current peak, while the voltage increases slightly. At the same time, spark formation causes local heating of gas and the enhancement of local electric field. The gas stream is ionized, and energetic electrons and reactive radicals are generated. The high temperature provided by sudden rise in discharge power can lead to the gasification of ethanol–water mixture. The electrons within the background gas absorb the plasma energy from the electric field, and then induce ethanol decomposition by electron impact. (c) High ionization phase: the voltage keeps increasing while the current decreases rapidly, which can be attributed to the increasing resistance of plasma column. The arc filament provides good mixing and contact with reactants while it is being elongated and pushed downstream by the gas stream. This process induces the decline in arc temperature and leads to the arc extinguishing in the next phase. Electrons still maintain relatively high temperature due to energy input from electric field while the background gas molecules are at ambient temperature therefore enhance energy efficiency. In the case of ethanol–water mixture, high ionization phase is the major phase during the plasma generation process. (d) Weak ionization phase: In this phase, the arc filaments disappear and the degree of ionization decreases greatly. The current is closed to 0mA, and the voltage increases to the peak value at first and then decrease. The arc column is elongated to the maximum value and then quenches. Fig. 4 shows the time-resolved voltage and current of the non-thermal arc discharge. Both voltage and current show a periodic variation at a frequency of 50Hz, and the current is a sinusoidal function of time. It is worth noting that the indented voltage waveform indicates the occurrence of the restrike breakdown in non-thermal arc [38,39]. Increasing air flow rate from 0.50 to 1.0m3/h enhances the formation of multiple breakdowns [40]. At high air flow rate, the gas stream pushes the arc filaments downstream and increases both the arc length and the voltage peak. From Fig. 4(b) and (c), dynamic behavior of voltage and current with ethanol–water mixture is more stable than that with pure air stream. Adding ethanol–water mixture decreases the generation of restrike breakdown and the peak value of voltage. The reason is that the presence of ethanol–water mixture varies the effective permittivity and local electric field between electrodes [40]."
6,Ethanol reforming by non-thermal arc discharge,"3.2 Ethanol reforming by non-thermal arc discharge 3.2.1 Influence of O/C ratio on ethanol reforming Influence of O/C ratio on ethanol reforming was investigated by varying O/C ratio from 0.6g/s to 2.0g/s. Ethanol conversion rate as a function of O/C ratio at different ethanol flow rates and S/C ratios is presented in Fig. 5 . It is observed that the five curves have similar variations, which increase at first until reaching the maximum values and then decline. Among the five conditions, ethanol conversion rate reaches the maximum peak value of 90.9% at O/C=1.4 with S/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.05g/s, which is suitable for ethanol conversion in the non-thermal arc reactor. At lower O/C ratio, the lack of oxygen molecules is responsible for a week ethanol conversion. As O/C ratio increases, ethanol conversion augments rapidly, and then reaches the peak value, which may be the result of the participation of sufficient oxygen molecules. Higher O/C ratio implies a larger air flow rate and a better oxidation condition. The rise in oxygen molecules is beneficial for the generation of oxidizing radicals, such as atomic oxygen and ozone, which enhances ethanol oxidation. As a result, more heat is released by ethanol oxidation and in turn accelerates the ethanol decomposition. From the viewpoint of V–I characteristic, the rise in air flow rate produces a favorable effect on the generation of restrike breakdown [40]. When air flow rate increases, arc turbulent intensity becomes stronger and the arc filaments become longer. The turbulent air flow also provides a good mixing and contact between arc filaments and reactant. These effects contribute to the generation of active species and ethanol conversion. Ethanol conversion sharply decreases with increasing O/C ratio up to 1.4 and then shows a slow decrease. The reducing trend of conversion rate with increasing O/C ratio can be ascribed to the decreased residence time, indicating that unreacted ethanol and water leave the electric field without ionization. Also, increasing air flow rate require additional energy for gas heating and a stronger electric field for gas ionization [38]. Noting that the input power was kept at a relatively constant value, the increase of air flow rate is considered to lower energy density. The low conversion at higher O/C ratio is also a result of the combined effect of the saturation of oxidizing radicals and the dilution of ethanol. Fig. 6 (a) shows the product yields as functions of O/C ratio. Both H2 and CO yields show a rapid initial increase, followed by a decreasing variation. The variations are similar to ethanol conversion in Fig. 5. The maximum H2 yield of 40.9% and the maximum CO yields of 59.6% are obtained at O/C=1.4 with S/C=1.6 with ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s. The reduced H2 and CO yields can be attributed to the low ethanol conversion at lower O/C ratio. When O/C ratio increases, more ethanol is oxidized by oxygen molecules, resulting in the rise in H2 and CO yields. At the same time, oxygen molecules convert light hydrocarbon (e.g., CH4) into H2, CO and CO2. As O/C ratio is increased to 1.4, adequate amounts of oxygen molecules participate in the complete oxidation of ethanol, leading to maximum values of product yield. The declines in H2 and CO yields are the possible results of a low ethanol conversion at higher O/C ratio. In addition, H2 and CO are oxidized to H2O and CO2 by oxygen molecules, respectively, leading to the decreases in product yields. H2/CO ratio as a function of O/C ratio is also presented in Fig. 6(b). At S/C=1.6 and ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s, the peak value of H2/CO ratio is 1.29, which occurs at O/C=1.6. At S/C=1.6 and ethanol flow rate=0.08g/s, H2/CO ratio is maximized at O/C=1.8, which is 1.49. Noting that higher O/C ratio will lower both ethanol conversion and product yield, the maximum value of H2/CO ratio at O/C=1.6 and O/C=1.8 should be excluded. In combination with Figs. 5 and 6(a), the optimal value of O/C ratio for H2/CO ratio is between 1.2 and 1.4. In the experiments, H2/CO ratio is observed to be more than 1 at different O/C ratios, indicating that H2 yield was more than CO yield. The selectivities of H2 and CO at different O/C ratios, S/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s are listed in Table 2 . It is observed that the maximum selectivities of H2 and CO occur when O/C is in the range of 1.2–1.4. 3.2.2 Influence of S/C ratio on ethanol reforming Further experiments were performed by varying S/C ratio from 0.8 to 3.0. The conversion rate as a function of S/C ratio is shown in Fig. 7 . The maximum ethanol conversion are 86.7% at S/C=1.6, O/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s, and 71.7% at S/C=2.0, O/C=0.8 and ethanol flow rate=0.08g/s, respectively. As mentioned before, S/C ratio determines the proportion between steam and ethanol. Increasing S/C ratio indicates that more water molecules are introduced to electric field. It has been confirmed that increasing water content contributes to the generation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. The main pathways for the generation of hydroxyl are considered to be the result of the direct dissociation of water molecules by electron impact and excited oxygen atom [40]. These reactive species can deliver energy by colliding with ethanol molecules, and thus initiate ethanol decomposition. As S/C ratio increases over 2.0, ethanol conversion declines as a consequence of the decreased reaction temperature. The additional water molecules absorb some of the heat released from ethanol oxidation, resulting in a decrease in reactor temperature which suppresses the conversion of ethanol. Further increase in S/C ratio varies the conductivity of non-thermal arc and the distribution of plasma energy, and therefore produces a lower potential level, leading to the decrease in ethanol conversion [40]. The product yields as functions of S/C ratio at O/C=0.08 and ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s are plotted in Fig. 8 (a). H2 yield increases at first and then drops as S/C ratio increases. H2 and CO yields reach peak values at S/C=1.2, which are 21% and 36%, respectively. The main effect of S/C ratio in the plasma reactor is not only to change the water content, but also to change the distribution of active species and the pathways. The dissociation of water can provide active species, such as OH, H and O. These active species can boost the plasma catalysis effect by activating ethanol to produce syngas and other products. The complete process of the generation of H2 and CO is very complicated. As S/C ratio increases to over 1.2, H2 and CO yield decrease. At this time, active species are quite plentiful within the plasma region. Increasing S/C ratio cannot further enhance the generation of H2 and CO due to the dilution of ethanol [7]. From the view point of chemical reaction, the binding energy of H–O of a water molecule is 497.0kJ/mol, while the binding energy of C–O and C–H of an ethanol molecule is 391.2kJ/mol and 421.2kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that C–O and C–H bonds within the plasma discharge are easier to be broken down. As a result, compared to water, ethanol is much easier to be decomposed. In addition, the high hydrogen content in ethanol molecules is beneficial for hydrogen production within the gas sheaths around the Laval electrode and the central electrode. Besides, the plasma layer around the electrodes becomes thicker with the increase of ethanol molecules, and the turbulent gas stream can produce non-thermal plasma with a larger volume. During the whole process, the enhanced turbulence intensity and the increased plasmas species can promote ethanol conversion and hydrogen production. Fig. 6(b) shows H2/CO ratio as a function of S/C ratio at different O/C ratios and ethanol flow rates. The maximum H2/CO ratio of 1.33 was obtained at S/C=1.6, O/C=1.0 and ethanol flow rate=0.08g/s. The experiments showed that the production distribution strongly depends on H2/CO ratio. From an industrial point of view, syngas production with a constant H2/CO ratio is favorable for chemical synthesis process. In the experiments, a H2/CO ratio in the rage from 1.2 to 1.6 is suitable for ethanol reforming and hydrogen production. From Table 3 , the selectivities of H2 and CO reach maximum values at S/C=1.6, O/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.08g/s. In the experiments, H2/CO ratio is consistently over 1 under different conditions, indicating that increasing water content is beneficial for hydrogen production. The presence of large amounts of water produces a favorable effect on the water gas shift reaction, leading to an increase in hydrogen production. When the reaction temperature is lower than 1000K, the main pathway for the generation of hydrogen atoms is water dissociation by electron impact: (21) H 2 O + e → H + OH + e During the original time 10–100μs, hydrogen is produced in the following process: (22) C 2 H 5 OH + H → C 2 H 5 O + H 2 It is believed that the oxidizing character of H2O produces an enhancement of the selectivity towards H2 through the water gas shift reaction. Ideally, hydrogen generated in the water gas shift reaction and the heat from total oxidation can be effectively utilized by combining steam reforming with partial oxidation of ethanol and water gas shift reaction [5]. 3.2.3 Influence of ethanol flow rate on ethanol reforming The influence of ethanol flow rate on reforming performance was also tested while holding constant S/C and O/C ratios. In this work, ethanol flow rate varies from 0.08g/s to 0.20g/s, and O/C ratio and S/C ratio were kept at 0.6 and 1.2, respectively. Ethanol conversion rate as a function of ethanol flow rate is presented in Fig. 9 . Ethanol conversion rate shows a decline from 76.4% to 65.5% with increasing ethanol flow rate. As mentioned before, a constant O/C ratio with increasing ethanol flow rate implies a larger air flow rate and a shorter residence time. These variations lead to a poor mixing and contact between arc discharges and reactants as more water and air enter the plasma reactor. In addition, increasing ethanol flow rate at a constant S/C ratio gives rise to more heat loss as the additional water molecules absorb the heat released from ethanol oxidation and the plasma. Increasing ethanol flow rate and holding constant O/C ratio and S/C ratios lead to the decrease in energy density within the plasma region. This variation can suppress the plasma catalysis effect by decreasing average electron energy. Product yields as functions of ethanol flow rate at O/C=0.6 and S/C=1.2 are shown in Fig. 10 (a). It was found that H2 yield declines from 29.4% to 20.6% and CO yield decreases from 35.0% to 30.0%, by increasing ethanol flow rate from 0.08g/s to 0.20g/s. Fig. 10(b) also shows that H2/CO ratio decreases with increasing ethanol flow rate. These results can be ascribed to the decrease of free radical concentration. From Eqs. (1) and (3), the steam reforming and partial oxidation of ethanol can produce more hydrogen than carbon monoxide. Therefore, H2/CO ratio declines with the decrease of ethanol conversion. The selectivities of H2 and CO as functions of ethanol flow rate are listed in Table 4 . It is observed that selectivities of H2 and CO reach maximum values at the initiate ethanol flow rate of 0.08g/s, and then decrease with increasing ethanol flow rate. Burlica et al. [41] have investigated the relationship between hydrogen production rate and fuel flow rate or liquid composition, discovering that the production rate and corresponding energy efficiency increased with increasing flow rate. The reason provided by researchers is that a lower residence time allows a faster quenching and an effective suppression of radical reactions, which might destroy the product."
7,Understanding of the plasma mechanisms of ethanol reforming,"3.3 Understanding of the plasma mechanisms of ethanol reforming The direct conversion of ethanol reforming can be divided into dehydrogenation [42,43] dehydration, decomposition [11,43] and coking. Levko et al. [44] conducted researches on plasma-assisted reforming of ethanol in a modified ‘tornado’-type electrical discharge and investigated the different effects of the discharge region and the post-discharge region. The discharge region behaved like catalyst for the formation of active species, gas heating and ethanol reforming for hydrogen production, while in the post-discharge region ethanol conversion continues with the additional conversion of C x H y . Non-thermal plasmas can effectively stimulate oxidation reactions as a result of interactions between active species and ethanol molecules. It is found that atomic hydrogen can be removed from ethanol and water, and then C–C bonds in ethanol are dissociated by electron impact, producing H2 and CO. Further removal of atomic hydrogen by radicals and electron impact results in the generation of CO X and C2 species. In general, plasma can affect molecular decomposition, generating various active species which act as reducing or oxidizing agents. Plasma-generated electrons and ions behave much like catalysts by influencing the kinetics of hydrocarbon conversion, and they can participate in chain reactions to promote reaction pathways. In addition, non-thermal ignition mechanism allows plasma energy to be used selectively in the generation of these useful active species. Non-thermal plasmas like gliding arc had various applications as they have relatively low gas temperature and active species like ions and radicals which can provide control over the chemical selectivity of a process [45]."
8,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production from steam-oxidative reforming of ethanol has been investigated in a novel miniaturized non-thermal plasma reactor. The V–I characteristic investigation indicates that more breakdown and ignition occur at higher air flow rate, and the addition of ethanol–water mixture varies the effective permittivity and local electric field between electrodes. In the experiments, the gaseous products of plasma-assisted ethanol reforming include H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and C3H8. Trace liquid and solid products are also produced during the reaction process, which include HCOOH, CH3COOH, CH3COCH3 and coke. By varying several physical parameters such as O/C ratio, S/C ratio and ethanol flow rate, the improvement of hydrogen production can be achieved with non-thermal arc discharge. In our work, the maximum hydrogen yield of 40.9% was achieved at O/C=1.4, S/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.10g/s and the maximum ethanol conversion of 90.9% was achieved at O/C=1.4, S/C=1.2 and ethanol flow rate=0.05g/s. The residence time and reaction temperature are two main factors influencing ethanol reforming, which can control by varying O/C ratio, S/C ratio and ethanol flow rate. A shorter residence time can give rise to insufficient mixing or bad contact between plasma discharges and reactants, while a longer residence time are considered as a potential reason to induce more reverse reaction. Also, a higher conversion and hydrogen yield can be achieved with a proper reaction temperature. During the entire process of ethanol reforming, the concentration of nitrogen oxide in the gaseous products is less than 10ppm due to the 35% contained oxygen in ethanol [11] and the supersonic/subsonic sample introduction in the novel miniaturized non-thermal plasma reactor. In general, plasma-assisted steam reforming of ethanol has great potential to achieve high conversion and improved hydrogen yield. However, the detailed mechanisms of plasma-assisted fuel reforming still need more investigations, especially the pathways of active species for ethanol conversion. The addition of catalyst in a plasma system would be a promising way to promote greater conversion and product yields than plasma or catalyst technologies. Plasma pre-treatment can reduce coke generation and remove sulfur compound, therefore avoiding catalyst poisoning. With catalyst placed downstream to provide post-treatment, unconverted hydrocarbon can be decomposed to produce hydrogen and C2 products could be removed from gas stream, thus increasing conversion and syngas production. To further improve the reforming performance, researchers should pay more attention to the modification of the structure of plasma reactor and the selection of catalysts with favorable catalytic behavior."
