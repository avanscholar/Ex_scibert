0,Introduction,"The development of low environmental impact, low-cost production technologies is an essential element of current chemical industry [1–3]. This is particularly true for the manufacture of fine and speciality chemicals due to the large amount of waste generated and costs associated [4], but also in the light of their high commercial value [5]. Indeed, while several technically efficient processes are already available in the field of crude oil processing and bulk chemicals production, to date sustainable methods for the production of fine chemicals on a large scale are not adequately implemented [6]. Heterogeneous catalysis is acknowledged as an excellent strategy to achieve this goal because of the inherent advantages in terms of clean separation procedures, ease of reuse of precious catalysts as well as integration in existing reactor equipments [7,8]. Among heterogeneous catalysts, metal nanoparticles (MNPs) onto insoluble support materials are usually featured by high activities and robustness, thus to be suited for application in various reactions, e.g. hydrogenations, oxidations, isomerizations, couplings, and in different fields, e.g. chemicals and energy production, biomass conversion, automotive gas treatment [9–13]. Several reactors type were engineered in the past based on this kind of catalysts, including batch [14–16], flow [17,18], monolithic [19] and microreactors [20–24], often with excellent results in terms of productivity, energy consumption, safety, waste emission. Membrane-type catalytic reactors add the advantage of a catalytic layer acting as separation media between reagents and products, resulting in improved downstream processing and simpler purification procedures [25–28]. For these reasons, MNPs-based catalytic membranes were deeply investigated and a number of review covering the topic were recently published [29–34]. Compared to metallic or ceramic materials, polymeric membranes provide several benefits: (i) the sorption and permeability of reagents and products can be driven so as to improve the catalyst performance, (ii) the catalyst efficiency can be increased by co-incorporation of additives, (iii) the manufacture technology of polymeric membranes is much developed, thus allowing for a wide choice of sizes, morphologies, mechanical, chemical and thermal stability, affinity for reagents and catalysts to be available [35–37]. During our studies on solid electrolytes for electrochemical applications [38], we have recently communicated the synthesis [39] and use of hybrid inorganic/polymeric, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based membranes as support material for the immobilization of asymmetric hydrogenation molecular catalysts [40]. The studies showed that the as-prepared catalytic membranes provide the same level of enantioselection as the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, lower metal leaching compared to known polymeric membrane systems [41,42] and remarkable durability in polar solvents. Herein we report the preparation of Pd NPs embedded into hybrid inorganic (Zr, Pd)/polymeric (PVA) membranes [43,44] and the use of the resulting membranes in the liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated CC bonds under mild reaction conditions. Selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons with multiple CC and/or CC bonds, eventually bearing additional functionalities, to achieve partial hydrogenation products is a highly desired and challenging process in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and petrochemical industry [45,46]. Particularly, the stereo- and chemo selective hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes in the presence of other groups is of fundamental importance in the synthesis of food additives, flavours and fragrances [47–49]. Partial hydrogenation reactions are also crucial in industrial polymerization processes to achieve the complete elimination of alkynes and dienes from alkene feedstocks [50,51]."
1,Experimental,
2,General information,"2.1 General information All reactions and manipulations were routinely performed under nitrogen atmosphere by using standard Schlenk techniques, unless otherwise stated. The hybrid inorganic/polymeric membranes containing palladium oxide were prepared as previously described [43,44]. All the other chemicals were reagent grade, commercial products and were used as received without further purification. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy measurements (ESEM) were performed on a FEI Quanta 200 microscope operating at 25keV accelerating voltage in the low-vacuum mode (1Torr) and equipped with an EDAX Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS). Samples for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses were prepared by inclusion of the membranes into Struers EpoFix® epoxy resin, followed by lapping. The samples were then cut with a RMC MT-XL ultramicrotome to give a film thickness of 60nm. TEM measurements were carried out using a CM12 PHILIPS instrument at 120keV accelerating voltage. Statistical nanoparticle size distribution analysis was typically carried out on 300–400 particles. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded with a PANanalytical XPERT PRO powder diffractometer, employing CuKα radiation (λ =1.54187Å), a parabolic MPD-mirror and a solid state detector (PIXcel). The samples were subjected to measurement without grinding and prepared on a silicon wafer (zero background) that was rotating (0.5 rotations per second) during spectra acquisition. All XRD spectra were acquired at room temperature in a 2θ range from 4 to 95°, applying a step size of 0.0263° and a counting time of 77.5s. Reactions under a controlled pressure of hydrogen were performed using either a 100mL stainless steel PARR 4565 reactor whose inner walls were covered with Teflon® and equipped with a bottom drain valve and a pressure controller, or by a PEEK autoclave (20mL internal volume) constructed at ICCOM-CNR (Firenze, Italy) and a pressure controller. Both reactors were equipped with an inner Teflon® mechanical stirrer. GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and 30m (0.25mm i.d., 0.25μm film thickness) VF-WAXms column or a 30m (0.25mm i.d, 0.25μm f.t.) SPB-1 column. GC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu QP2010S spectrometer equipped with identical capillary columns. The metal content in the catalytic membranes was determined by EDS analysis and by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with a Varian 720ES instrument at a sensitivity of 500ppb. Each sample (ca. 100mg) was treated in a microwave-heated digestion bomb (Milestone, ETHOS LabStation with Easy Wave Software, 20min@220°C) with 8mL aqua regia and 0.5mL of H2O2 30%. The content of metal leached in the catalytic reaction solutions was determined by ICP-OES. The solutions were analyzed directly after 1:2 dilution in 1% HNO3."
3,Preparation of the catalytic membranes,"2.2 Preparation of the catalytic membranes A sample of preformed hybrid inorganic/polymeric membrane (NKZPD, 2cm2, typical composition in weight ratio to 80% saponified PVA normalized to 1: ZrO2 0.093, PdO 0.021, polyoxythylene polyglycerol ether 0.19) [43,44] was clamped between two Teflon-windows and introduced into a round bottom flask equipped with a lateral stopcock containing nitrogen-degassed water (30mL). The suspension was cooled to 0°C and an excess of NaBH4 (120mg, 3.1mmol) was added in portions under a stream of nitrogen. The solution was then stirred with an orbital-stirrer under nitrogen at 0°C for 30min, followed by at room temperature for 24h. After that time, the water solution was removed by decantation, and the membrane was carefully washed with degassed water (3×30mL) and methanol portions (3×30mL) and dried under a stream of nitrogen overnight. The catalytic membrane assembly thus obtained (Pd@NKZPD) can be stored under nitrogen and it is ready-to-use in an autoclave for subsequent catalytic hydrogenation reactions. For the purpose of evaluate the metal loading in the catalytic membrane, the membrane was removed from the Teflon holder, dried under vacuum overnight and analyzed by ICP-OES to give a typical Pd content of 0.30% (w/w)."
4,Hydrogenation reactions by catalytic membranes,"2.3 Hydrogenation reactions by catalytic membranes In a typical reaction, a hydrogen degassed solution of the substrate in methanol was transferred via a Teflon® capillary under a stream of nitrogen into the autoclave containing the catalytic membrane-Teflon assembly Pd@NKZPD described above. The assembly was plugged at the end of the inner mechanical stirrer so as to obtain a rotating membrane device. The autoclave was degassed with 3cycles vacuum/hydrogen then charged with the desired hydrogen pressure. The autoclave was stirred at the desired rate at room temperature for the appropriate time. The autoclave was then depressurized under a hydrogen flow and the reaction solution was removed from the bottom drain valve. A sample of this solution (0.5μL) was analyzed by gas chromatography for the determination of conversion and selectivity. The remaining solution aliquot was analyzed for the amount of metal leached into solution via ICP-EOS analysis. Recycling experiments were performed as follows: a hydrogen-degassed methanol solution of the substrate was transferred via a Teflon® capillary under a stream of hydrogen into the autoclave containing the catalytic membrane after use in the previous hydrogenation reaction. The autoclave was charged with the desired hydrogen pressure and the solution was stirred at room temperature for the desired time. After that, the autoclave was depressurized and the reaction solution was removed from the bottom drain valve, under a stream of hydrogen. A sample of this solution (0.5μL) was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the conversion and selectivity. The remaining solution aliquot was analyzed for the determination of the amount of metal leached into solution via ICP-EOS analysis."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic membranes preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalytic membranes preparation and characterization In the course of our studies on polymeric membranes for electrochemical applications, we recently communicated the synthesis of hybrid inorganic (zirconia)/polymeric (PVA, PEG) membranes containing inactive Pd(II) species (60±5μm thickness, abbreviated as NKZPD) [43,44]. Aimed at providing the membranes with catalytic activity, Pd NPs were conveniently embedded into the preformed membranes by a straightforward procedure, using water as solvent and sodium borohydride as reducing agent (Fig. 1 ). In order to avoid membrane folding and to facilitate the introduction of the membrane in a reactor chamber for use in subsequent hydrogenation reactions, the membranes were clamped between two Teflon-windows before reduction (Fig. 2 ). The as-prepared material (abbreviated Pd@NKZPD) showed no significant physical or morphological changes with respect to the native membranes (ESEM analyses) and could be handled with ease, provided that it was stored under nitrogen for long periods. A typical Pd loading of 0.30% (w/w) in the membrane was measured by ICP-EOS, consistently with EDS data (Fig. 3 ). TEM analysis showed the Pd@NKZPD membranes to contain evenly dispersed spheroidal Pd NPs with a mean diameter of 4.6(2) nm and with a narrow size distribution. Fig. 4 shows typical TEM images and the measured Pd particles diameter distribution. X-ray Diffraction data were in line with those obtained from TEM. The size of the supported Pd NPs was significantly lower than that reported for PVA-stabilized palladium colloids (8–50nm) [52], that can be safely attributed to the steric stabilization of the porous membrane network [53,54]."
7,Selective hydrogenations by catalytic membranes,"3.2 Selective hydrogenations by catalytic membranes 3.2.1 Catalytic membranes activity and selectivity The hybrid catalytic membranes Pd@NKZPD obtained after borohydride reduction were tested in the batch hydrogenation reactions of different substrates bearing multiple unsaturations and/or functionalities. The substrates examined are sketched in Fig. 5 , while representative results are summarized in Table 1 . All hydrogenation reactions were performed under smooth conditions (room temperature, methanol, 1–10bar H2), using inert batch reactors in which the membrane-teflon assembly containing 2cm2 of active membrane (0.30%, w/w, Pd loading, corresponding to ca. 0.06mg Pd, Fig. 2) was allowed to rotate into the reaction solution. Good catalyst activity with typical turnover frequencies in the range 100–500h−1 (TOF=molproduct/molPd ×h) were typically observed at ca. 60% substrate conversion after 2h reaction time. Complete conversions were invariably observed for longer reaction periods (see Section 3.2.2 below). Careful inspection of Table 1, in which selected data obtained under comparable experimental conditions are reported, clearly indicates that the catalyst activity roughly followed the order CC>CC>CO. This trend is justifiable in terms of greater affinity of Pd for C=C rather than for CO bonds in aliphatic compounds [55–58]. The native membranes showed no catalytic activity prior of reduction, nor significant effect of the Pd loading on the catalytic membrane activity and selectivity was observed up to 5.0% (w/w) Pd content [59]. Palladium leaching in solution was lower than 0.1ppm in any case, and often below the Pd detection limit of ICP-EOS (0.006ppm), which corresponds to a maximum of 0.5% Pd loading loss. The partial hydrogenation reaction of 1,5-cyclooctadiene 1 could be achieved with 78.4% selectivity to cyclooctene 1a at 87.7% conversion, after 5h under 5bar H2 (overall TOF 78h−1). The only other compound observed during the reaction was cyclooctane, no formation of the isomerization 1,3- or 1,4-cyclooctadiene products being detected. As graphically shown in Fig. 6 , a slight selectivity drop was observed upon reaction progress, as expected for this reaction type. Indeed, the partial hydrogenation reaction of 1 was previously reported using both polymeric and ceramic membranes containing catalytic Pd entities. Earlier studies showed that palladium NPs onto PVA membranes (5%, w/w, Pd, 5.5nm NP diameter) were able to provide 1a in an 82% selectivity at 50% conversion [60]. More recently, the hydrogenation of 1 was reported by the group of Shomäcker using a reactor operating at 50°C and 40bar H2, and built on a loop of a H2-resaturation vessel and a pore-through-flow catalytic membrane based on cross-linked polyacrylic acid in which Pd NPs were incorporated (5nm diameter, 1.0%, w/w, Pd) [61,62]. Conversions and selectivities were shown to be dependent from the membrane pores size, with selectivity decreasing upon increasing conversion. The best results in terms of selectivity to 1a, ca. 95% at 90% conversion, were obtained for the smallest pore size membrane (130nm), which was attributed to a well-defined contact time of the reactants within the catalytically active layer. Using a similar apparatus and reaction conditions, Pd@alumina pore-through-flow catalytic membranes (0.6 microns pores, 0.04%, w/w, Pd, 8.5nm NP diameter) were reported by the same research group to afford 1a with a selectivity of 95–96% under 10bar H2 and n-heptane as solvent [63]. The hydrogenation reaction of 3-hexyn-1-ol 2 was investigated in greater detail since the cis-partial hydrogenation product leaf alcohol 2a is a valuable ingredient in the fragrance industry [64,65]. Experiments were carried out at different hydrogen pressures, temperatures, reaction times and substrate/catalyst ratios. Selected results are reported in Table 2 . As expected, a decrease in the H2 pressure or in the reaction temperature resulted in slower kinetics and in higher selectivities to the partial hydrogenation product 3-hexen-1-ol (2a + 2b), while the cis/trans ratio (2a vs. 2b) was less affected. The best values in terms of selectivity were obtained at −40°C and 1bar H2 (ca. 70% ene selectivity, 84% of which 2a). In any case, selectivity showed to be only slightly dependent from the overall conversion. To the best of our knowledge, no previous examples of partial hydrogenation of 2 using catalytic membranes were reported [66,67]. The activities and/or the selectivities obtained using Pd@NKZPD compare with those previously reported for other conventional solid-supported Pd nanocatalysts, including Pd onto charcoal [68,69] and hydrotalcite [70], while being somewhat lower with respect to Pd onto gel-type ion-exchange resins [71] and supported commercial Pd colloids [72]. Selectivity issue in the liquid-phase catalytic semi-hydrogenation reaction of substituted alkynes was examined in the past and the topic was reviewed in a recent paper [73]. When metal catalysts onto commercial solid supports were used, the selectivity could be enhanced by addition of variable, often large, amounts of contaminants, either organic bases, carbon monoxide, sulfides, dimethyl sulfoxide or metal ions, whose purpose was to lower the hyperactivity of the metal, typically Pd [74,75]. Selectivity enhancement at egg-shell catalyst, where the intermediate alkene quickly leaves the active metal after formation without the possibility to react further, was also recently proposed [76]. The leaf alcohol 2a is industrially manufactured in 400 t/y with ca. 97% selectivity@99% conversion by a batch process using the Lindlar catalyst (5%Pd on CaCO3 doped with 2–3% Pb) [77,78]. Despite the higher selectivity of the industrial process, the catalyst described in the present work provides clear advantages in terms of environmental impact due to no contamination by toxic Pb nor other additives, lower noble metal loading and potential implementation into separation systems. Use of other solvents other than methanol was hampered by the low-permeability of the membranes, which invariably resulted in much lower productivity. However, viability of Pd@NKZPD catalytic membranes in water was demonstrated using the water soluble olefin 4 as substrate. Complete conversions and selectivity were observed within reasonable timeframes with no Pd leached in solution detected by ICP-OES. The hydrogenation of 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one 3 was highly selective, affording the CC hydrogenation product 3a in >99% yield, with no significant amounts of unsaturated alcohol 3b or fully hydrogenated product 3c detected at full conversion (see Fig. 9), nor traces of ketals or acetals by-products observed, unlike for other solid-supported Pd catalysts [79,80]. The Pd@NKZPD catalyst showed also to be more efficient compared to commercial Pd/C [81,82] (which requires higher temperatures and/or H2 pressures to provide similar conversions and, often worse, selectivity) and to conventional alumina [83] and silica [84] supported Pd catalysts. 3.2.2 Catalytic membranes reusability For all substrates investigated, the catalytic membranes were tested in six consecutive hydrogenation runs under identical conditions, by substitution of the reaction solution with a freshly prepared one for each run. Each recycle experiment was carried out along a sequence of 4 runs of 2h, followed by one run of 16h and one run of 2h. All cycles were check for conversion and selectivity by GC and for Pd leaching in solution by ICP-EOS. The relevant results are reported in graphical format in Fig. 7 A perusal of the experimental data showed that: - irrespective of the substrate or the reaction conditions, the catalytic membrane could be recovered intact (ESEM) after six runs and prolonged reaction periods (26h); - irrespective of the substrate or the reaction conditions, all runs stopped after 2h resulted in partial conversions (20–80%), but full conversion could be achieved through overnight runs (16h); - palladium leaching in solution was negligible in each experiment, regardless of the reaction solvent either methanol or water. Particularly, the Pd leached in solution was below the detection limit in each cycle of the hydrogenation reaction of 1 and 2, while decreased from ca. 0.06 to ca. 0.04ppm in successive reuses in the case of the hydrogenation of 3 and 4. Complementary ICP-EOS measurements showed the absence of any zirconium species leached in solution in each experiment; - in no case the reaction solution recovered after each hydrogenation cycle showed catalytic activity (Maitlis test [85]); - in some cases, the catalytic membrane activity decreased upon reuse. The activity decay was faster in the first hydrogenation cycles, but minimal subsequently. As an exception, a conversion increase was observed upon membrane reuse in the case of the hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol 2; - selectivity was not significantly affected upon membrane reuse, nor a direct relationship with conversion was observed, except for some selectivity drop for long reaction times in the case of the hydrogenation of 1 (i.e. for the overnight cycle), as already justified in Section 3.2.1. On the basis of the above findings, the activity loss of the membranes can be safely ascribed to the small leach of catalytically inactive Pd species in solution, as previously observed for other solid-supported Pd hydrogenation catalyst [80]. Indeed, activity decay was higher for the first hydrogenation cycles of 3 and 4, in which a higher metal leach was observed (Figs. 9 and 10), whereas a pretty constant activity was observed in the case of the hydrogenation of 1 and 2, in which Pd leaching is undetectable irrespective of the cycle duration (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Deactivation of polymer-supported Pd hydrogenation catalysts due to dissolution of metal crystallites was previously reported as a consequence of oxidative side-reactions [86]. Impurities or partial decomposition of the substrates may be responsible for this behaviour in the case of 3 and 4 [80]. A small poisoning contribution due to carbon deposition on the membrane active sites cannot, however, be ruled out [63]. The slight catalytic activity increase observed in the first cycles of the hydrogenation of 2 could be tentatively attributed to the incomplete reduction of the Pd(II) precursor [71]. The results obtained indicate that the catalytic membranes Pd@NKZPD are featured by a remarkable mechanical and chemical resistance which allows for their use under catalytic conditions for prolonged reaction times. The performance observed in the hydrogenation of 1 and 2 are particularly intriguing as no similar systems were described showing comparable efficiency and durability under the same conditions. An overall TON of ca. 1500 for the semi-hydrogenated product 3-hexen-1-ol can be calculated in the non-optimized hydrogenation of 2 (16h, room temperature 5bar H2). Reuse of Pd@NKZPD membranes can be easily accomplished with no need of regeneration steps nor any additional treatment. The Pd@alumina membrane reactor previously reported for use in the catalytic hydrogenation of 1 needed an harsh activation procedure to be reused (2h at 300°C in air and 2h at 250°C under hydrogen) [87]. Organic polymers are largely employed as support for catalytically active species [88–90], however they may present some drawbacks from an engineering point of view, such as volume and porosity changes with swelling, thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, shrinking phenomena, which adversely affect their overall performance [91]. In order to contrast these limitations, inorganic materials have been previously included in polymeric matrixes (e.g. raschig rings [92], glass [93], and others [94]) with clear benefits in terms of stability of the final catalyst. Rare examples are known of hybrid organic/inorganic membrane composites for use in processes in the liquid phase mediated by embedded catalytic species [95,96]. We have shown that addition of zirconia greatly improves the potential of PVA membranes for use under catalytic conditions in the long-term. Indeed, hydrogenation experiments carried out in the absence of ZrO2 in Pd@PVA membranes showed limited resistance, resulting in scarce practical reusability [43]."
8,Conclusions,"The application of catalytic membranes on the large scale is hampered by problems related to their manufacturing costs and limited durability. Key issues to be addresses is the development of sustainable methods for advanced membranes synthesis, stable in a wide range of solvents and conditions, and showing high and reproducible performance over long times [29]. We have shown that palladium nanoparticles can be easily grown within a hybrid zirconia/PVA membrane matrix, to afford contactor type catalytic membranes suitable for application to partial hydrogenation reactions in the liquid phase under smooth conditions. A Pd content as low as 0.3% weight in the membranes allowed for the complete hydrogenation of CC and CC bonds within reasonable timeframes and satisfactory selectivity. Particularly, the partial hydrogenation reaction of the challenging substrate 3-hexyn-1-ol could be for the first time carried out by a catalytic-type membrane, showing no significant loss of catalytic performance over prolonged reaction period. Compared to known similar systems, the system devised offers multiple advantages in terms of negligible Pd leaching, activity under mild reaction conditions, improved mechanical and chemical stability, high durability, possibility of use in hydrophilic solvents, no need of regeneration. The results obtained are of relevance to the development of new methods for the long-term, sustainable production of fine-chemicals, particularly in the industrially important field of hydrogenation processes in which overhydrogenation problems shall be overcome. Experiments are in progress in our labs to broaden the scope of the hybrid zirconia/PVA catalytic membrane herein described by inclusion of other metal NPs (i.e. Au, Ru) and engineer of flow-through reactors."
