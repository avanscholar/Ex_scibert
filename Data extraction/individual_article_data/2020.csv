0,Introduction,"The recovery of energy from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and domestic wastewater from treatment plants is a response to the double challenge of developing renewable sources of energy while providing sustainable methods of waste management. Energy recovery from MSW is consistent with the so-called “waste hierarchy” [1], which places energy recovery above disposal in terms of management priorities. While common methods for energy production from MSW are anaerobic digestion and incineration [2], hydrogen production is increasingly perceived as a potential pathway, due in particular to hydrogen’s high energy content (142 kJ/g) and to the absence of harmful emissions during utilisation in a hydrogen fuel cell [3]. According to Lin and Lay [4], the biological production of hydrogen can be considered as a clean process compared to conventional processes and requires a lower amount of energy than physico-chemical processes (pyrolysis, thermochemical gasification,…). Moreover, this process becomes more attractive if cheap raw materials are used as substrates, such as solid organic wastes from agricultural crops, industrial processes and domestic wastewaters [5]. The microbial production of hydrogen by fermentation can be broadly classified into two main categories (dark fermentation and photo-fermentation). During dark fermentation processes, such as classical anaerobic digestion producing primarily methane (CH4), the hydrogen production phase is very brief and occurs before the sulphate-reduction (producing H2S) and methanogenic phases take over. The strategy adopted in this study consisted in promoting the initial acidogenic and acetogenic steps by inhibiting the subsequent methanogenic step, which consumes hydrogen [6]. As shown in [7], the efficiency of these initial steps is low, due primarily to thermodynamic limitations [8]. In theory, from a stoichiometric viewpoint, only 4 mol of H2 per mole of glucose are produced if acetate is the sole end product and 2 mol of H2 per mole of glucose if butyrate is the end product [9]. Previous researchers have examined several ways of inhibiting methanogenesis: for example chemical inhibition of methanogenic bacteria [10], promotion of ferri-reducing conditions [11], pH control [12,13], thermal treatment of inocula [12,14], control of hydrogen partial pressure [15], inorganic nutrient concentrations [4], or temperature control [16]. Another means of methanogenesis inhibition was proposed by Roychowdhury [17,18] who applied a weak electric voltage (3–4.5 V) to partially decomposed organic matter, in order to produce hydrogen and CO2 instead of methane. More recent studies have focused on Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MEC) which combine the use of electrochemically active bacteria for breaking down organic matter to bicarbonate, protons and electrons, with the application of a weak voltage (ca. 0.2 V) resulting in a high yield of hydrogen gas [19–23]. Such studies have been described as a promising new technology for the production of biohydrogen from organic matter. The objective of biocatalyzed electrolysis, successfully demonstrated by [9,19], is to obtain H2 at the cathode and CO2 and H+ at the anode. For that purpose, two types of biocatalyzed electrolysis reactors are used: a two-chamber and a single-chamber reactor. While the two-chamber reactor has separate cathodic and anodic reactions, [8] show that the performance in terms of volumetric hydrogen production rate is limited by reaction inefficiencies at the cathode. Therefore [19] used a single liquid chamber with a cation or anion exchange membrane. More recently, studies were performed using single-chamber biocatalyzed electrolysis, without a proton exchange membrane [24]. In the latter study, hydrogen was produced by electrolysis of volatile fatty acids generated during anaerobic treatment of wheat powder waste and the method was found to be effective with a high energetic efficiency. Most studies have used acetate as a model compound for the biocatalyzed electrolysis experimentation, while both mixed and pure bacterial cultures have been examined for their potential as hydrogen producers. For example [25] found that Thermoanaerobacterium spp. such as T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. bryantii were dominant during biohydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent, using a thermophilic fermentative process. In this study, we explore the performance of biocatalyzed electrolysis under thermophilic conditions, in a single-chamber reactor without a proton exchange membrane but with a stimulation of MSW endogenous bacteria by application of a weak voltage. The particular focus of the study is on gaining a better understanding of underlying mechanisms during this process and on the analysis of bacterial and archaeal communities."
1,Materials and methods,"A schematic diagram of the experimental set up is presented in Fig. 1 . The reactors are double-walled water-jacketed reactors (4-L capacity) with a constant temperature set at 55 °C (by water circulation) in order to study thermophilic organic decomposition. The reactors are equipped with pH and Oxidation–Reduction Potential (ORP) electrodes (Heito, Paris, France) and two sampling ports: one for gas removal connected to a volumetric gas flowmeter (milligascounter®, Ritter, Germany) and another for liquid sampling in view of microbial and organic acid analyses. The reactors were equipped with different types of electrodes for current generation: carbon graphite electrodes for both the cathode and the anode, or else carbon graphite electrodes for the cathode and Platinum Electroplated Titanium (PET) electrodes for the anode. The PET electrodes were titanium electrodes covered with a 3 μm-thick platinum layer. All electrodes were 6 mm in diameter and 240 mm in length (67.9 cm2). The upper portions of the electrodes were connected to a power supply unit (Iso-tech, model IPS 303DD, RS component, Anderlecht, Belgium), while the lower portions were immersed in the reactor. Each reactor had 4 electrodes: two anodes (referred to conventionally as the positive electrodes, i.e., where anodic oxidation occurs) and two cathodes (the negative electrodes, i.e., where cathodic reduction occurs). Voltage and current were recorded continuously using a digital multimeter and data acquisition system (Keithley Instruments, model 2700, Cleveland, USA). The substrate used in the reactors was MSW sampled from a non-hazardous waste landfill located close to the city of Orléans (France). Samples were collected using a mechanical shovel at 3–4 m depth in an area where waste was relatively recent (less than a year old). Immediately following sampling, the waste was shredded to a particle size between 10 and 20 mm Table 1 summarizes the composition of the waste in terms of nitrogen, carbon (organic and total), phosphate, iron and sulphur. By deduction, initial mineral carbon represents 0.3% w/w (3 g/kg). The composition of the waste was found to be representative of French MSW as described in [26]. The shredded waste was mixed with reaction solutions prior to the experiments in the reactors. The composition of the mineral medium solution was: 1.35 g/L KH2PO4; 1.75 g/L K2HPO4; 2.65 g/L NH4SO4; 1.0 g/L MgSO4; 1.0 g/L CaSO4; and 1 mL/L trace metal solution. The composition of the trace metal solution was: 6.5 mL/L HCl 25% in solution; 1.5 g/L FeCl2.4H2O; 60 mg/L H3BO3; 117 mg/L MnSO4.H2O; 25 mg/L CoCl2.6H2O; 70 mg/L ZnCl2; 25 mg/L NiCl2.2H2O; 15 mg/L CuCl2.2H2O; 25 mg/L NaMoO4.2H2O. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 6 with a solution of 1M H2SO4 acid. Experiments were conducted in batch mode during 90 days for the control (no current application) and 150 days for the electro-stimulated anaerobic reactor. One kg of crushed MSW and 2 L of mineral medium were added to both reactors. Each reactor was hermetically closed and the temperature was maintained at 55 °C through the double jacket. Reactors were initially purged with nitrogen gas (99.99%, Messer, France) during 15 min in order to remove dissolved oxygen and favour anaerobiosis. Biogas sampling was performed daily in order to identify and quantify the following gases: CH4, CO2, H2, H2S and N2. The volumes of biogas produced were measured on a continuous mode using the gas flow-meters. Two mL of liquid samples were taken one or two times a week, as a function of biogas composition evolution, for Volatiles Fatty Acids (VFA) and alcohols analyses and also for bacterial and archaeal community structure analyses. The pH and Oxidation–Reduction Potential (ORP) were measured and recorded continuously with the same digital multimeter and data acquisition system (Keithley, Instruments Inc. Cleveland, USA). All potentials were reported against the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Gaseous concentrations of CH4, CO2 and O2 were measured using a portable infra-red Landfill Gas Analyser (GA2000, Geotechnical Instrument, Warwickshire, UK), and also periodically with a portable micro-gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, micro GC P200, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in order to check the infra-red analyses. Other gases such as H2, H2S and N2 were analysed using the same portable gas chromatograph equipped with two columns: a PORAPLOT U (6 m length) and a MS5-A (12 m length) using a catharometric sensor. Volatile Fatty Acids; i.e., acetic (C2), propionic (C3), isobutyric (C4iso), butyric (C4), isovaleric (C5iso), valeric (C5), isocaproic (C6iso) and heptanoic (C7) acids, were analysed by ion chromatography (DIONEX ICS3000-SP-EG-DC) equipped with an autosampler (DIONEX AS50) and a conductimetric sensor. A gradient elution with sodium hydroxide, from 10 to 100 mM, was applied at 1 mL/min and 40 °C through an anionic column (DIONEX- AG11 and AS11 HC, 4 mm ID). Certain alcohols such as methanol, propanol-2, ethanol, propanol-1, isobutanol, terbutanol and butanol-1, were analysed by Gas Chromatography (VARIAN 3800) equipped with an headspace injector (COMBIPAL), a FID detector and a Stabilwax-DA column (Restek- 30m Length, 0.32 mm ID and 0.25 μm DF). Genomic DNA was extracted from a pellet (obtained from 1.5 mL of sample) with the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (Bio 101). Molecular fingerprints of the community structure were obtained with the structural analysis technique CE-SSCP (Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism). About 200 bp of the V3 region of 16S rRNA genes were amplified with the reverse primer w34, 5′ end-labelled with the fluorescent dye VIC in combination with the forward primer w49 targeting Bacteria members or the primer w36 targeting Archaea members [27]. Twenty five cycles, hybridization at 61 °C (Bacteria) or 51 °C (Archaea) and 30 s elongation at 72 °C were used. Amplified DNA products were heat denaturated (5 min at 95 °C) in deionized formamide, and immediately cooled on ice. Single-stranded DNA were analysed (injection 15 kV, electrophoresis 12 kV, temperature 32 °C) on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyser using a 47 cm long capillary and the non-denaturating 5.6% GeneScan polymer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). The GeneScan-500 LIZ (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) was used as an internal standard. CE-SSCP profiles were assessed using the GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). An inventory of Bacteria and Archaea members present in the electro-stimulated reactor was performed at the start of the experiment. Gene libraries were constructed (TOPO-TA cloning Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen) from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, amplified using the primers 8F/1406R for Bacteria members and 1406R/Arch3Fb or 109F for Archaea members [28]. Clones carrying a correct-length insert were screened by CE-SSCP in order to group the clones according to their migration profile and to assign a clone to individual peaks detected in the population fingerprint. One clone representative of each group was purified and the carried insert was sequenced (Genome Express) with plasmid-specific primers. Consensus nucleotide sequences were submitted to a blast search (www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) for identification of closest bacterial relatives. Two reactors were implemented in parallel in order to compare MSW degradation by methanogenesis and by electrically-stimulated hydrogen production. The reactor under methanogenic conditions was considered as a control with no physico-chemical influence of the organic matter anaerobic decomposition."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Electro-stimulated hydrogen production,"3.1 Electro-stimulated hydrogen production Fig. 2 shows the evolution as a function of time of the gas composition in the electro-stimulated reactor. Current was applied 6 days after the start of the experiment, i.e., when the percentage of CH4 in the produced gas had reached 20%. Also seen in Fig. 2 are the times of electrode replacement and the effect on gas composition. The electric voltage applied, using two couples of two electrodes (two anodes and two cathodes), is shown in Fig. 3 along with the measured current. The voltage was stable at 3 mV while the current fluctuated as a function of current generation efficiency (see below). Following the application of current, the proportion of H2 in the collected gas increased steadily to above 60% but then started to decrease after ca. 37 days due to a decrease in electrode efficiency. Following the first electrode replacement (48 days; Fig. 2), H2 percentage went back up to 50% but CH4 production was not completely inhibited. The second electrode replacement (at time 86 days) was successful in increasing the H2 percentage (60%) but also decreasing CH4 production. During this period, the current generation was between 0.02 and 0.04 A (Fig. 3). It should be noted that as the proportion of oxygen in the gas was below 1% during the electro-stimulated experiment (except during changes of electrodes; Fig. 2), water electrolysis cannot have contributed to the production of H2. This observation is consistent with experiments by [24] who measured less than 0.5 mL of O2 formation during their experiments where a voltage of 3V was applied. Analysis of the bacterial community showed that the different phases identified in Fig. 2 correspond to the development of distinct bacterial species. During the initial phase, i.e. before electric voltage application, Bacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences A, B, C and D dominate the diversity profile (Fig. 8). Sequences migrating in this region of the profile were affiliated to the genus Clostridium, members of which are known to be involved in organic matter fermentative processes [29,30]. Among the Archaea community, the only archaeon that could be identified during that period was the thermophilic, acetoclastic and methanogenic Methanosarcina thermophila (sequence 2), but only in low proportions until 10 days. During the first peak H2 production period (after 26 days), methane was below 1% and the gaseous phase was composed of 60% H2 and 37.7% CO2. During this period, isocaproic and heptanoic acids were consumed by the bacteria to produce H2 and organic acids with lower carbon contents (butanoic acid, acetic acid; Fig. 4 ). Bacillus spp. sequence F became increasingly important (Fig. 8) which is consistent with the fact that some Bacillus species are hydrogenotrophs and involved in hydrogen production [31]. Archaeal sequence 1 also showed an evolution correlated to fluctuations of H2 content in the reactor, being dominant during H2 production periods (15–36 d and 65–86 d) and minor as H2 content decreased, thus suggesting that the corresponding species was involved in the H2 metabolism. After 37 days of operation, the proportion of H2 and CO2 decreased and CH4 was measured (Fig. 2). This change was related to a decrease in the current generated by the electrodes (Fig. 3) due to a loss of efficiency caused primarily by the precipitation of carbonate along the immersed portion of the anode, as shown by chemical analysis of the precipitate. This resulted in a decrease in H2 production and hence an increase in certain organic acids (e.g. caproic, heptanoic; Fig. 4). Hydrogen and acetic acid were then consumed by methanogenic bacteria to form CH4 and CO2 (Fig. 2). Organic acid concentrations (Fig. 4) were generally higher than under methanogenic conditions (see below), which is consistent with the mechanisms of anaerobic waste decomposition, since organic acids with H2 are used by hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria to produce CH4 and CO2 [6]. Concerning the Bacteria community structure, sequence F ratio decreased and sequence E prevailed, while they were almost undetected at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 8). Sequence E is distantly related to known genera but belongs to the Thermotogales family which comprises microorganisms capable of producing hydrogen from organic substrate fermentation and that are inhibited by high hydrogen concentrations [32,33]. During the period between 36 and 43 days where a rapid decrease of the electrical current led to low hydrogen partial pressures, bacteria sensitive to hydrogen may have found a suitable environment for their growth. However, although these bacteria seem to have played a primary role in the electro-stimulated reactor, they could not be identified at the species level based solely on 16S rRNA gene sequence identity and their metabolic capabilities remain largely unknown. Concerning the Archaea community, the presence of the thermophilic hydrogenotrophic and methanogenic archaeon Methanoculleus thermophilus (sequence 5; Fig. 8) was found to be correlated to CH4 production (Fig. 2). The lifetime of the electrodes used in this experiment was comprised between 30 and 33 days. The PET anode efficiency decrease was due primarily to carbonate precipitation along the submerged part of the anode. This is consistent with the products generated at the anode, where HCO3 - and CO2 are produced due to the half electrohydrolysis reaction. The integrity of the cathodes were influenced by the corrosivity of the medium. When the carbon graphite electrodes were replaced by new ones (at times 48, 86 and 119 days; Fig. 2), H2 production increased and was correlated with an increase in the ORP of the solution, a decrease in methane production and also a decrease in heptanoic acid concentration (Fig. 4). During the periods of significant H2 production (6–38 days, 86–135 days and 135–146 days), with hydrogen production around 60% and methane around 1–3% (Fig. 2), the current generation was above 0.06 A (efficient current generation by the applied voltage of 3 V; Fig. 3). During the experiment, the initial pH started around 6 and then decreased to 5.7–5.8 during the acidogenic production and remained at this value until the end of the experiment (data not shown). Such values of pH are known to favour the production of hydrogen [13]."
4,Methanogenic conditions (control reactor),"3.2 Methanogenic conditions (control reactor) Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the composition of the gas produced by the reactor operating under methanogenic conditions. This evolution can be subdivided into 5 successive phases. The first phase, from 0 to 2 days, corresponds to a stabilisation of the system with respect to CO2 production and N2 removal. Organic acids, such as acetic, butanoic and propionic acids, were detected in the liquid phase at concentrations comprised between 0.55 and 2.23 g/L (Fig. 6 ). During the second phase or acidogenic phase (from 2 to 8 days), an increase in CH4 and CO2 was observed and H2S was also detected (Fig. 5). After 8 days, the gaseous phase was composed of 18% CH4, 88% CO2 and 4.6% H2S. An increase in organic acid content was observed, with concentrations of acetic and butanoic acids up to 7 and 1.5 g/L respectively (Fig. 6). The decrease in isovaleric acid was correlated with an increase of acetic and butanoic acids. A decrease of pH from 6.5 to 5.6 was also observed (data not shown). During the third phase or sulfato-reduction phase (from 8 to 20 days), the decrease in the fraction of CH4 was correlated with an increase in H2S (Fig. 5). At the end of this phase (20 days), the gaseous phase was composed of 5–6% CH4, 72% CO2 and 10% H2S. Population analysis revealed the presence of the species Thermotogales, some of which are able to produce H2S from inorganic sulphur compounds. Acetic and butanoic acid concentrations continued to increase and reached resp. 8.9 and 1.8 g/L (Fig. 5). The fourth phase (from 20 to 36 days), showed a decrease in H2S and CO2 proportions, due to the installation of methanogenic conditions. During this phase, acetic acid concentrations reached a maximum (9.5 g/L) and then decreased rapidly to 0.6 g/L in 7 days. This consumption was related to the metabolic activity of methanogenic bacteria. A transitory accumulation of alcohols (methanol, propanol and butanol; up to 12 mg/L) was observed. During the final phase (methanogenic phase; from 36 to 87 days), there was a stabilisation of methane production, with proportions of CH4 and CO2 comprised between 56-75% and 32–42% respectively, i.e. values that are typical of MSW decomposition. During this phase, heptanoic to acetic acid concentrations decreased in 7 days to lie below detection limits. A low concentration in acetic acid remained in the reactor due to degradation of organic acids of higher carbon numbers (Fig. 6). Although the same Bacteria and Archaea 16S rRNA gene sequences as in the electro-stimulated reactor were found, major differences were observed in terms of sequence ratios and evolutions (Fig. 8). Bacillus sp. (sequence F) disappeared after 22 days while it was dominant at that time in the H2 producing reactor, which suggests that that this bacterium was involved in the production of H2. Bacteria belonging to Thermotogales (sequences E and F) appeared earlier (15 days) and could be responsible for hydrogen sulphide accumulation between 8 and 20 days in the control reactor, as most of them are able to produce H2S by reducing inorganic sulphur compounds (elementary sulphur, thiosulphate, [34]). New sequences were also found; a sequence H belonging to a Thermotogales dominated at 28 days and remained in the reactor until the end of monitoring, while an unidentified sequence I appeared after 65 days. With respect to Archaea occurrence, the main differences with the electro-stimulated reactor were (i) the increasing ratio of sequence 1 which became largely dominant at 28 days and (ii) the earlier development of M. thermophilus (sequence 5) which was dominant as early as 36 days. This species remained until the end of the monitoring. The period comprised between 36 and 86 days was a period of CH4 production, thus M. thermophilus was the main actor responsible for CH4 production in the control reactor. During the experiment, the initial pH was 6, but then decreased to 5.6 during the organic acids production and then increased gradually to reach 7.5 (typical of methanogenic conditions) at the end of the experiment (87 days). The redox potential (ORP) was comprised between −450 and −350 mV versus SHE during the experiment and was always anti-correlated with respect to pH."
5,Comparative cumulative biogas and hydrogen production,"3.3 Comparative cumulative biogas and hydrogen production Fig. 7 depicts cumulative biogas volume for both reactors. In the control reactor (methanogenic conditions) there is a first phase of gas production related to the initial CO2 production followed by a low gas production corresponding to the sulphate-reduction phase, and then gas production increases dramatically during methanogenesis with consumption of VFA (Fig. 6). For the electro-stimulated reactor, there is a strong increase of gas volumes during 41 days, i.e., during the period of optimal carbon graphite electrode efficiency, with 16 L of H2 produced and 36 L of biogas (Fig. 7a). The mean H2 production rate was between 27 and 35 mL/h during this phase. The lull in gas production observed between days 41 and 82 is due to the loss of electrode efficiency with a very weak current generation (Fig. 3). The replacement of the carbon graphite electrodes by fresh ones resulted in an increase of biogas production similar to the first phase. However, the mean H2 production rate was lower than previously and was between 16 and 17 mL/h. Finally, the switch from carbon graphite electrode to a PET electrode resulted in substantial gain in efficiency, with a H2 production of 41 mL/h (Fig. 7). Table 2 summarizes the CH4 and H2 production rates in both the control and the electro-stimulated reactors. In the electro-stimulated reactor, 5.9 mmoles of H2 were produced per mg of initial organic carbon during the first phase. At the end of the experiment, 8.4 mmoles of H2 were produced per mg of initial organic carbon, which was lower than in the CH4 control reactor (11.8 mmole CH4/mg OC)."
6,Treatment efficiency,"3.4 Treatment efficiency The performance of the biohydrogen producing reactor was evaluated in terms of H2 production rate and energy efficiency. The H2 production rate (m3/day/m2) was calculated on the basis of the measured H2 production rate, after normalization by the anode surface area [21,22]. The electrical energy supplied to the system was calculated using [24]: (1) E e = VIt where E e = electrical energy supplied to the system (J), V = voltage applied to the system (V), I = current (A) and t = duration of the applied voltage (s). The energy content of the produced H2 was calculated using: (2) E H 2 = 142 m where m = mass of cumulative hydrogen produced and 142 = hydrogen energy yield (kJ/g). Finally, energy efficiency was calculated as the EH2/Ee ratio. The overall hydrogen production rate in our study was 0.035 m3/day/m2 (Table 3 ) and was 3–4 times lower compared to values presented in [22]. These authors, who developed a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for H2 production, reported a hydrogen production rate of 0.11 m3/day/m2 with a current density of 9.3 A/m2 at pH 7 using a pure culture of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and lactic acid as a sole carbon substrate. The efficient current density in our study was 10.3 A/m2 and was close to the one determined by [22]. The lower hydrogen production rate obtained in our study is interpreted as being due primarily to the substrate source (municipal solid waste), which was heterogeneous and relatively poor in easily biodegradable organic compounds and also to the miscellaneous composition of the microbial population (Table 3). Tuna et al. [24] suggest that the rate of hydrogen production increases with increasing voltage (from 1 to 3 V) and found that the most suitable voltage for hydrogen production was 3 V. In our study, energy efficiency of the overall electrolysis process using MSW and an applied voltage of 3 V was equal to 12.4%, i.e. 3 times lower than the one determined by [22] who obtained an energy efficiency of 49% using a total volatile fatty acids concentration of 10.85 g/L at the same voltage and pH values. In our study however, the energy efficiency was 21.9% during the first phases of hydrogen production, i.e. before deterioration of the electrodes. The Maximum Coulombic Efficiency (CE) observed by [35] for domestic wastewater using a bio-electrochemically assisted microbial reactor (BEAMR) was 26% and therefore close to our result with MSW. Such values are nevertheless far from the CEs of 60–78% obtained with acetate as substrate in a Microbial Fuel Cell [7]. Such low CEs with wastewater have been attributed to a loss of substrate due to bacterial utilisation of alternative electron acceptors, substrate diffusivity, fermentation, etc. [35]. In our study, the complexity of the substrate can explain the low energy efficiency due to the variety of the degradation processes involved."
7,Conclusions,"Results presented in the study confirm that methanogenesis can be inhibited during anaerobic electro-stimulated degradation of organic waste, thus leading to hydrogen production. The application of a weak current to MSW stimulated hydrogen producing bacteria and resulted in a hydrogen production rate comprised between 16 and 41 mL/H2/h. Under thermophilic conditions, most of the species involved in the biological hydrogen production remained unidentified with the exception of Bacillus spp. Some bacterial species related to the Thermotogales family are suspected to be also involved. This study highlights important operational constraints related to electro-stimulation: the choice of the electrode material is essential due to loss of electrode efficiency. The replacement of the graphite carbon electrodes by platinum electroplated titanium electrodes resulted in an increase in hydrogen production rates. However, a major source of electrode efficiency loss was found to be the precipitation of carbonates on the anode, which reduced the electrical current generated for a given applied voltage. It is anticipated that the hydrogen production rate could be substantially improved by optimising the ratio of electrode surface area versus reactor volume and also the position and number of electrodes within the reactor chamber. Although the study illustrated the feasibility of hydrogen production from raw MSW, the hydrogen yield remains low and would be substantially enhanced with wastes of higher organic contents, such as beet sugar pulp or the degradable organic fraction of MSW. Another possibility for improving efficiency would be to use a two-stage process in order to reduce the high VFA concentrations observed at the end of the experiment; either using a second stage of dark fermentation or photo-fermentation, or else a second step of microbial electrohydrolysis of produced VFAs."
