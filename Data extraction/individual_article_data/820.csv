0,Introduction,"The increased demand for renewable energy to offset the depletion of fossil fuels and mitigate environmental concerns has required a concerted worldwide effort to produce biofuels from renewable feedstock. Hydrogen (H2) is a clean, potential energy carrier, as its combustion generates only water vapor as a reaction product with a higher energy yield (142 kJ/g) than petroleum-based fuels [1,2]. Biological H2 production methods stand out as sustainable and environmentally friendly processes in which microorganisms produce H2 from renewable biomass through dark fermentation (DF) [3,4]. It has been assumed that a considerable amount of renewable energy will be derived from agricultural waste, organic waste, and biomass, which potentially represent an abundant renewable and sustainable resource for the production of H2 energy through DF pathways [5,6]. DF is carried out by many fermentative obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria which produce molecular H2 as one of their fermentation end product [7,8]. Due to its high production rate, yield, light-independence, and efficient utilization of various types of organic waste and feedstock as substrates, DF is more suitable for biological H2 production than photo-fermentation [7,9,10]. The utilization of lignocellulosic wastes, such as forest-industrial residues, agro-industrial residues, energy crops, and other materials as a renewable feedstock for bioH2 production is particularly interesting due to the abundance, availability and the fact that the production of these biomasses does not require land use [11]. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is comprised of holocelluloses and lignin fractions that vary quantitatively and qualitatively, depending on the plant source materials. Holocelluloses consisting of hemicellulose and cellulose make up 70–80% of LCB and are intimately associated with lignin [12,13]. The holocellulose portion of LCB can be converted into bioH2 and is composed exclusively of glucose in the case of cellulose and a range of hexoses (glucose, galactose, and mannose) and pentoses (i.e., xylose and arabinose) in the case of hemicellulose. However, due to the recalcitrant nature and complex hierarchical structure of lignocellulose, the conversion of reasonable fractions of these biomasses into bioH2 by fermentative bacteria is restricted [14]. Hence, the utilization of lignocellulosic wastes for dark fermentative production of H2 requires pretreatment to disrupt the holocellulose-lignin association and remove lignin, making the holocellulose bioavailable and amenable to enzymatic and microbial hydrolysis [15]. Although the objective of pretreatment is to remove the lignin barrier, decrease the crystallinity of the holocellulose portion and improve its biodegradability, the simultaneous release of soluble inhibitory sugar byproducts such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), or byproducts derived from lignin such as vanillin, syringaldehyde, and other phenolic compounds have often been reported [11,16,17]. The buildup of these toxic byproducts results in significantly low H2 yields and productivity from pretreated lignocellulosic substrates using both microbial pure cultures [18,19] and consortia [20–22], thus limiting the utility of this abundant biomass for real-scale H2 production. Although pretreatment under specific temperature and pressure is inevitable, the generation of inhibitors may be minimized during pretreatment, and the hydrolysate may be detoxified before fermentation using various chemical, physical, and biological techniques [23,24]. Since detoxification steps would significantly increase the overall process cost, it is necessary to identify and develop cheap and efficient methods to detoxify or avoid detoxification in order to make the process economically viable [25]. Previously published reviews have focused primarily on the formation of inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysate, their effects, and the detoxification of inhibitors for alcohol fermentation [14,26,27]. Some of the reviews provided general information on the inhibition of dark fermentative H2 production and anaerobic digestion from lignocellulosic wastes [24,25,28,29]. A comprehensive review of the existing lignocellulose pretreatment strategies applied in dark fermentation leading to the formation of inhibitory byproducts, the mechanisms of inhibition, the effects of the byproducts on the dark fermentative microbial population, and specific strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of the lignocellulosic byproducts has been presented here. Individual and synergistic effects of inhibitory byproducts on H2 yields and productivity are also discussed, with a focus on the dynamics of dark fermentative microbial communities and inhibition of cellular metabolic pathways and mechanisms. Finally, desirable approaches to minimize the formation of inhibitors during pretreatment of LCB, detoxification of the hydrolysates have been reviewed along with a techno-economic assessment of bioH2 production from LCB taking pretreatment and detoxification into account."
1,Inhibitory byproducts in lignocellulosic hydrolysates,
2,Nature of inhibitory byproducts,"2.1 Nature of inhibitory byproducts The use of untreated LCB for dark fermentation can reduce the process cost and avoid the inhibitor formation; however, this generally results in a low yield and H2 productivity [30,31], implying that pretreatment of these biomasses is necessary. Among the many pretreatment regimes, thermal and thermochemical processes have been shown to improve the digestibility of lignocellulose [32,33]. In addition to solubilizing lignocellulose into soluble sugars, these processes result in the formation of various inhibitory byproducts (Fig. 1 ). Lignin is a complex polymer comprised predominantly of guaiacyl and syringyl units. Upon oxidative pretreatments, these compounds depolymerize and release phenolic compounds, including syringaldehyde and vanillin, which have inhibitory effects on microbial cells [34]. Sugar monomers can react to form pseudolignin under severe pretreatment conditions (120–210 °C, 4 wt% HCl, and up to 60 min) [35]. Although phenolics are generally thought to be generated from lignin, several studies have shown that various phenolic compounds might also form from the degradation of carbohydrate monomers [36]. Additionally, several other inhibitory by-products, including other aldehydes, and acids such as benzoic acid and cinnamic acid may also form depending upon the type of pretreatment and exhibit different inhibitory effects on microorganisms [14]. Furanic compounds such as furan-2-carbaldehyde (furfural) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde [5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF)] are the key primary derivative compounds resulting from the dehydration and degradation of pentoses (xylose, arabinose) and hexoses (glucose, mannose, galactose), respectively [25]. Xylose can follow at least three different pathways involving an acyclic (ring-opening) mechanism and two different cyclic (ring closed) mechanisms leading to the formation of furfural and subsequent products [36]. Depending on the reaction conditions, glucose can be transformed into 5-HMF at high temperatures through at least four different cyclic and acyclic pathways. In either case, glucose and other hexoses dehydrate and produce 5-HMF through multiple steps [37]. It should be noted that furfural and 5-HMF can further degrade to weak acids such as formic, and levulinic acids under severe pretreatment conditions, such as high temperature and acid concentration (190–200 °C, 1.5–3 wt.% H2SO4, and up to 20 min) (Fig. 1) [38]."
3,Pretreatment technologies for bioH2 production and their influence on the formation of lignocellulosic inhibitors,"2.2 Pretreatment technologies for bioH2 production and their influence on the formation of lignocellulosic inhibitors The goal of LCB pretreatment is to select operational conditions that effectively remove lignin and hemicellulose from the lignocellulosic matrix or modify lignin structure. The biodegradability and optimal pretreatment of LCB are governed by several factors related to the structural and compositional properties of the lignocellulose, such as its crystallinity and degree of polymerization, degree of hemicellulose acylation, surface area and the pore volume, lignin content, and composition [11,39,40]. Many of the popular LCB pretreatment regimens have been investigated and shown to eventually improve the H2 yield. Currently, large-scale pretreatment is assumed to involve particularly high temperatures (160–210 °C) and the use of acids or alkalis (Table 1 ) [36]. Steam explosion involves heating the biomass with steam at high temperature and pressure, followed by a rapid decrease in pressure and simultaneous passage of biomass through a small orifice, during which flash evaporation of the water produces a thermo-mechanical force causing the biomass to rupture [41]. Holocellulose is hydrolyzed into its monomeric sugars during the steam explosion, and lignin is transformed to some extent, making the biomass more accessible to microorganisms. Improved thermophilic H2 production was observed in the fermentation of steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse [32,42]. However, depending upon the severity and the use of acidic conditions in the steam explosion, excessive degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose may result in the formation of furfural and 5-HMF, which may restrict the effectiveness of this method (Table 1). Hydrothermal pretreatment, which involves heating biomass in water at elevated temperature and pressure (150–300 °C, initial pressure of 0–60 bar, 2–40 min) [33], is also highly effective at expanding the surface area of the biomass and reducing the crystallinity of cellulose, thus improving its bioavailability to fermentative bacteria [43]. In a recent study, hydrothermal heating of harvested algal blooms with 4% H2SO4 resulted in a 55.7% energy conversion efficiency, yielding 37.33 mL H2 and 261.93 mL CH4 per gram of total volatile solids, respectively [44]. Dilute acid pretreatment and mild hydrothermal pretreatment at 170 °C solubilizes the hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulosic sugarcane bagasse biomass, yielding 265 mL and 177 mL H2 per gram of carbohydrate from xylose and xylooligosaccharide rich hydrolysates, respectively [45]. Although the use of acids often promotes hydrolysis of lignocellulose, higher concentrations result in a lower yield of H2 due to the generation of furfural, 5-HMF, and Na+ accumulation during neutralization of the hydrolysates with NaOH [44]. Hydrothermal pretreatment, such as hot water pretreatment has been shown to release phenolic compounds from lignin degradation to some extent [46]. Pretreatment with mineral or organic acids is one of the most practiced approaches for the recovery of fermentable sugars from LCB. Acid solubilizes the holocellulose and increases the digestibility of cellulose, enhancing H2 production. While dilute acid pretreatment can solubilize almost 100% of hemicelluloses into its component pentoses (e.g., xylose and arabinose), the degree of lignin and cellulose solubilization depends on the strength, concentration of the acids and the duration of pretreatment process [47,48]. Recently, a high yield (275.75 mL g−1 total sugar) of H2 was obtained with an optimized pretreatment with sulfuric acid at high temperature [49]. Despite the higher efficacy of concentrated acid on cellulose hydrolysis, adverse effects such as inhibitor formation as well as the need to neutralize pretreated hydrolysates limit the applicability of such a simple method [50]. Oxidative pretreatment with H2O2 or alkaline H2O2 results in delignification and the breakdown of hemicellulose. Pretreatment of Agave tequilana bagasse with alkaline H2O2 indicated that up to 97% delignification and 88% recovery of cellulose and hemicellulose monomers could be possible which subsequently led to 1.5 times higher yield (215.14 ± 13 L kg−1) of H2 after fermentation [51]. However, the hydroxyl (HO·) and superoxide anion (O2·) radicals generated from H2O2 trigger oxidative cleavage of the aromatic components of lignin mostly releasing phenolic compounds, which inhibit microbial cells [52]. Among the recent approaches, microwaves [53,54], gamma-ray [55], electron beam [56], and ultrasound-assisted [57] pretreatment methods in the presence of catalytic solutions have been introduced, but their effects are considered to be similar to those of hydrothermal pretreatment methods using acid/alkali. Pretreatment using various methods is extending the digestibility of lignocellulose, although the generation of several inhibitory by-products continues to be a major limiting factor in lignocellulose conversion into bioH2."
4,Inhibition of H2 production from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass,
5,Mechanism of action of inhibitors on H2 producing microorganisms,"3.1 Mechanism of action of inhibitors on H2 producing microorganisms The inhibitory byproducts derived from the pretreatment of LCB can be categorized based on their origin, effects on microorganisms and chemical functions into: (1) short-chain carboxylates (SCCs) such as formic, acetic, levulinic acid; (2) furan derivatives mainly, furfural and 5-HMF; (3) phenolic compounds such as vanillin, syringaldehyde, benzoic acid. The individual toxic effects of the inhibitory byproducts on microbial cells depend upon their structure, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity, which determines their inherent capacity to penetrate the cell membrane and cause cellular damage [25]. (1) SCCs are produced from extensive degradation of monosaccharides (Fig. 1). At low levels, SCCs may have no effect or even a stimulatory effect on acidogenic H2 production [66]. However, the low pH resulting from the accumulation of higher levels of SCCs tends to negatively affect the activity of hydrogenase, reducing the overall H2 yield [29]. The pK a values of acetic and butyric acid are 4.75 and 4.82, respectively. At lower pH, undissociated VFAs permeate the cell membranes of fermentative bacteria and dissociate by releasing protons in the near-neutral pH inside the cells, reducing the cytosolic pH. This accumulation of protons has a net adverse effect on the growth and metabolism of the fermentative bacteria [67]. In order to restore normal cytosolic pH, ATPases pump protons outside across the membrane in an energy-demanding process that depletes the invaluable ATP reserves of the cell (Fig. 2 ) [68]. The persistence of this activity leads to the cessation of microbial growth. While the accumulation of VFA anions increases the osmolarity of the cytosol, resulting in the development of turgor pressure, which affects the integrity of the cell membrane [69]. (2) Furan derivatives exhibit more detrimental inhibitory effects on the fermentative bacteria than short-chain carboxylates and phenolic compounds. Due to their low molecular weight and hydrophobicity, these compounds readily enter the cytosol and inhibit NADH-dependent enzymes (e.g., glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase) that are key to the central metabolic pathways (Fig. 2) [70,71]. Studies have shown that glycolytic dehydrogenases are most susceptible to furfural, with the same concentrations of 5-HMF having less of an inhibitory effect in vivo [70]. Furfural and 5-HMF bind to nitrogenous bases (particularly adenine and thymine) of DNA and induce strand break, directly damaging the structure [72]. In addition, furfural has also been shown to inhibit the de novo synthesis of deoxyribothymidine triphosphate (dTTP), one of the four deoxyribonucleotide building blocks of DNA, in three different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Zymomonas mobilis) [73]. These bacteria were able to overcome the adverse effects of furfural when supplemented with thymidine or thymine (Precursors of dTTP), which clearly suggested the inhibitory role of furfural on dTTP synthesis. Inhibition of the dTMP pathway results in the deficiency of dTTP which eventually leads to the cessation of DNA replication, repair, and cell growth (Fig. 2). The additional burden of DNA damage and its repair would be expected to increase the requirement of dTTP by the cell, arresting cell growth [73]. (3) Phenolic compounds derived from the degradation of lignin, such as phenol, syringaldehyde, and vanillin, inhibit microbial growth both directly and indirectly. These inhibitors are primarily membrane-active compounds that directly damage microbial cells by selectively altering the cell membrane structure, permeability, and integrity [74]. Depending on the toxicity and concentration, these compounds can also disrupt the cell membrane causing the leakage of cellular constituents (Fig. 2) [25,75]. Moreover, phenolic compounds can inactivate several structural and functional proteins and enzymes, including those involved in central metabolism. Disruption of membrane integrity and the loss of function of several membrane proteins results in the dissipation of the ion gradient and hinders membrane transport mechanisms [74,76]. Both furanic and phenolic compounds generate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) (e.g., H2O2, ·OH, and ·O2 −), which can affect cell metabolism by inactivating enzymes, and damaging DNA and cellular proteins (Fig. 2) [77]. ROS also induce changes in fatty acid composition and inhibit the functions of the cell membrane [78]. Additionally, monomeric and oligomeric phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulose inhibit extracellular cellulase enzymes secreted by cellulose hydrolyzing bacteria by reversibly complexing with the cellulase enzymes and inactivating them [79]. This inhibition diminishes the cellulolytic activity of hydrolyzing bacteria and further reduces the substrate utilization efficiency of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Microorganisms possess the intrinsic ability to cope with the toxic effects of these inhibitory byproducts and transform them into less toxic compounds if their concentration is within their tolerance levels. However, these inhibitory byproducts differ in their capacity to tolerate, adapt, and grow in the presence of these inhibitors. It is necessary to determine the inhibitory threshold concentration of these compounds for a microbial culture to minimize the toxic effects and maintain microbial growth and optimal H2 production. Many microorganisms can mitigate the toxic effects of furfural by reducing or oxidizing it to furfuryl alcohol or 2-furoic acid, respectively, using NADH cofactor dependent reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenases [80]. This results in the depletion of NADH and consequent inhibition of dehydrogenases, leading to an increased lag phase or growth arrest [81]. Many microbial species respond to the toxic effects of these inhibitors by converting membrane cis-unsaturated fatty acids to trans-unsaturated fatty acids in order to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane [71]. While some bacteria induce SOS response (bacterial cell's global response to massive DNA damage) proteins and heat-shock proteins in order to repair the damaged DNA and enzymes and better counteract the physiological stress generated by lignocellulosic inhibitors [82], others can degrade these inhibitory byproducts and utilize them as sources of carbon and energy [25]. Apart from the physiological adaptability, microbial tolerance of lignocellulosic inhibitors depends on their intrinsic metabolic capacity to convert these inhibitors into less toxic compounds or completely utilize through central carbon metabolism, thereby providing a source of carbon and energy [83,84]. Furan derivatives undergo oxidation to 2-furoic acid in which, furfural is directly converted to 2-furoic acid in a single reaction, and 5-HMF is converted to 2-furoic acid through two-step oxidation and decarboxylation. The enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase converts 2-furoic acid to 2-furoyl-CoA. A molybdenum-dependent enzyme 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase converts 2-furoyl-CoA into 5-hydroxy-2-furoyl-CoA which, in turn, is converted to 2-oxo-glutaroyl-CoA. The enzyme 2-oxoglutaroyl-CoA hydrolase catalyzes the formation of 2-oxoglutarate which through a series of reaction culminates into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. 3 ) [85]. The byproducts of lignin degradation, syringaldehyde and vanillin undergo oxidation to syringate and vanillic acid, respectively [86,87]. Vanillic acid is further oxidized into protocatechuate which, along with syringate undergoes ring cleavage at ortho-position and follows ortho-cleavage β-ketoadipate pathway to yield succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA through a series reaction (Fig. 3) [86,88]. Succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA are the intermediates of TCA cycle and are catabolized through this pathway of central carbon metabolism. Further research for a better understanding of the impacts of lignocellulosic inhibitors and the mechanisms of tolerance adopted by the microorganisms is necessary for enhancing H2 production in the presence of these inhibitors."
6,Effects of inhibitors on H2 production efficiency,"3.2 Effects of inhibitors on H2 production efficiency The impact of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors on the growth and hydrogen production efficiency of pure and mixed microbial cultures has been investigated in the last decade (Table 2 ). Furfural, 5-HMF, syringaldehyde, and vanillin significantly inhibited the H2 production from corn stover hydrolysate by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 [19]. At 1.0 g L−1, 5-HMF showed a higher inhibition than furfural (50.2% and 17.9% decrease in relative H2 production), while syringaldehyde reduced relative H2 production by 54.3% and vanillin did not show any significant inhibition [19]. Interestingly, compared to the control, 5-HMF had a stimulatory effect on H2 production by a mixed culture at a comparatively low concentration of 0.6 g L−1 with an increase in H2 yield and production rate by 26% and 4%, respectively [89]. Haroun et al. [90] noted that the initial H2 yield (2.27 mol H2/mol glucose) from glucose and xylose (10.0 g L−1 each) by an acclimatized anaerobic sludge consortium improved by 17% and 6% when 0.25 and 0.5 g L−1 furfural was added, respectively, and declined by 21%, 29% and 62% when the furfural concentrations increased to 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 g L−1, respectively. This indicates that lower concentrations of furan derivatives have a Hormesis effect in which H2-producing microbes exhibit a biphasic response (i.e., stimulation followed by inhibition) to the increasing concentrations of furanic compounds up to 0.5–0.6 g L−1 [22,89,91]. Siqueira and Reginatto [77] assessed the individual effects of furfural (0.25–2.0 g L−1), 5-HMF (0.1–1.0 g L−1), vanillin (0.25–2.0 g L−1), syringaldehyde (0.25–2.0 g L−1) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) (0.15–1.0 g L−1) on H2 production by an anaerobic sludge mixed culture in a mineral medium with trace elements and glucose. Contrary to the common observation of hormesis, furfural and 5-HMF could inhibit H2 production even at the lower concentrations of 0.25 and 0.1 g L−1 [77]. An increase in furfural and 5-HMF concentration above 2.0–2.5 g L−1 results in a significant decrease in H2 yield down to zero [25,77]. It should be noted that the toxicity or hostile effects of the lignocellulosic inhibitors depends on their concentration, where higher the concentration, the higher will be the toxic effects [21]. The concentration of the inhibitors, in turn, depends on the type and severity of the pretreatment process such as higher temperature, acid concentration, pressure, and duration [33]. Hence, a balance should be obtained between the optimal efficacy of the pretreatment method and the generation of the inhibitor concentration that can be tolerated by the fermentative microorganisms. Although the growth of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (MJ1) was not completely inhibited by vanillin and syringaldehyde (relative maximum OD600 values were 64.7% and 78.2%, respectively) at 2.0 g L−1, relative H2 productions were severely inhibited (12.6% and 33.6% of the controls, respectively) [94]. Many studies have revealed that inhibition of hydrogen production by phenolic compounds was more severe than that of furanic compounds. According to Lin et al. [74], the inhibitory coefficients of vanillin (14.05) and syringaldehyde (11.21) were higher than those of 5-HMF (4.35) and furfural (0.64) using mixed culture as an inoculum. A significant decrease in H2 yield was observed by Sharma and colleagues [22] following the addition (2.0 g L−1) of vanillin (49.40%) and syringaldehyde (42.26%) to an Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli co-culture system. Whereas the addition of furfural and 5-HMF resulted in 27.0% and 37.2% reduction in H2 yield, respectively. It is evident that the co-cultures and mixed cultures of H2 producing microorganisms can effectively degrade furan derivatives at lower concentrations than phenolic compounds, justifying the higher toxicity of phenolic compounds compared to furan derivatives [22]. Contrary to the above observation, Siqueira and Reginatto [77] showed that furfural and 5-HMF (1.0 g L−1) diminished the H2 production potential (H max) of the system by 57% and 79%, respectively, which is slightly higher than the inhibition by syringaldehyde and vanillin (decrease in H max by 49% and 64%). In addition, the presence of inhibitory byproducts in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate substrate also leads to an increase in the lag phase of the dark fermentation, indicating that microorganisms need a longer time to adapt [25,77]. The substrate-to-biomass ratio is a significant parameter that influences H2 production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates in the presence of inhibitors. Akobi and colleagues [93] reported an optimum substrate-to-biomass ratio of 4 gCOD gVSS−1 for enhanced (19%) H2 yield by a mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge culture using synthetic lignocellulosic hydrolysate containing furfural concentration of less than 1.0 g L−1. In practice, fermentative microorganisms may deal with the mixture of all the inhibitors formed during the pretreatment of LCB. Depending upon the inhibitory byproducts present and their concentration in the biomass, exposure of the fermentative bacteria to the mixtures of inhibitory byproducts may have additive effects where inhibition by the mixture is the sum of the inhibitory effects of all the byproducts or synergistic effects where the inhibition exceeds the sum of the inhibitory effects of all the byproducts [95]. Giraldeli and colleagues [18] studied the effects of mixtures of 5-HMF (0.6 g L−1), levulinic acid (2.1 g L−1), and formic acid (0.8 g L−1) on hydrogen production by Clostridium beijerinckii Br21 and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Mixtures of levulinic acid, 5-HMF, and formic acid inhibited H2 production by C. beijerinckii Br21 by 83% and by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 by 89%. Both strains could transform and consume the 5-HMF in the mixture, though C. beijernickii Br21 possessed a better ability to transform the acids due to having formate dehydrogenase [18]. In another study by Hu et al. [94], mixtures of formic acid (2.0 g L−1), hydroxybenzoic acid (2.0 g L−1), ferulic acid (1.0 g L−1), p-coumaric acid (0.3 g L−1), furfural (2.0 g L−1), 5-HMF (2.0 g L−1), vanillin (1.0 g L−1), and syringaldehyde (2.0 g L−1) were used in different diluted concentrations of an inhibitor mixture to assess their synergistic effects on H2 production by a pure culture of T. thermosaccharolyticum MJ1. Hydrogen production could not be detected in the system with undiluted and two times diluted mixtures. At lower dilutions, considerable inhibition was observed with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6.5 dilution ratio [94]. Therefore, the additive and synergistic effects of byproducts are more toxic and inhibitory to microbial growth and H2 production than a single inhibitor. Contrary to this finding, Muñoz-Páez et al. [21] working with a mixed culture to produce H2 from xylose showed that a mixture of furfural and 5-HMF at various concentrations could also inhibit H2 production with an inhibition co-efficient of 30.2% at the highest concentration of furfural (1.0 g L−1) and 5-HMF (0.19 g L−1) evaluated. While at the same concentration, 5-HMF alone inhibited H2 production with an inhibition coefficient of 49.5%, indicating that the degradation and utilization of furfural in the furfural-HMF mixture by the bacteria resulted in a lower inhibitory coefficient (Fig. 4 a) [21]."
7,Effects of inhibitors on the dynamics of H2 producing microbiota,"3.3 Effects of inhibitors on the dynamics of H2 producing microbiota Lignocellulosic by-products affect the metabolic pathways and dynamics of H2-producing microbiota in addition to inhibiting H2 production. The growth of certain species in the H2-producing microbial consortium may be selectively inhibited by furanic and phenolic compounds, which adversely affects the overall H2 yield. There are only a handful of studies in the literature on the dynamics of microbial populations during growth inhibition by lignocellulosic by-products. According to Quéméneur and colleagues [96], the H2 producing microbiota was mainly dominated by Clostridium beijerinckii, C. acetobutylicum, C. cellulosi, C. pasteurianum, and Sporolactobacillus putidus and the abundance of non-clostridial species was significantly reduced in the presence of lignocellulosic inhibitors. Regardless of the inhibitors present in the medium C. beijerinckii accounted for 70.7% of the total population and could reach up to 85.8% in the presence of phenolic compounds, suggesting that C. beijerinckii could better tolerate the inhibitors and can be considered a suitable candidate for the production of H2 from pretreated LCB [96]. C. beijerinckii belonging to the phylum Firmicutes is a phenomenal H2 producer and is also less sensitive to furan and phenolic derivatives in pure culture [97,98]. This is because some strains of C. beijerinckii can detoxify and transform 2–3 g L−1 of furfural by overproducing a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase and an aldo/keto reductase enzyme with high specific activity for furfural and 5-HMF [99]. Depending on the concentration, the impact of the byproducts on the dynamics of microbiota may promote or inhibit H2 productivity. The addition of furan derivatives at a concentration below 1 g L−1 usually promotes H2 producing microbiota as revealed by the dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Liu et al. [100] demonstrated that the addition of 5-HMF (<1 g L−1) resulted in a higher distribution of Firmicutes with a relative abundance of 39.1%. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the dominant phyla accounting for 79.28% and 75.74% of the relative microbial abundance in 5-HMF, and furfural (<1 g L−1) supplemented fermentation, respectively [100]. However, the addition of furfural led to higher abundances of Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria and diminished relative abundance of Firmicutes (16.53%), which inhibited hydrogen production [100]. A concentration threshold is usually observed for each inhibitory byproduct below which H2 production may be unaffected or even improved. This inhibitory threshold concentration is dependent on the type of byproduct and the microbial inoculum used in the bioH2 fermentation. Below the threshold concentration, the byproducts are usually detoxified, and the generated metabolites are utilized by some members of the microbiota including the H2 producers, leading to an increase in H2 production. The presence of less than 1.0 g L−1 furfural has been shown to increase H2 yield by 45% using a mesophilic inoculum with the IC50 for furfural being 1.03 g L−1 [20]. Muñoz-Páez et al. observed considerable improvement in hydrogenogenic performance in the presence of 1 g L−1 furfural and 0.19 g L−1 5-HMF in two separate experiments (Fig. 4a) [21]. Although Clostridium beijerinckii is recognized as an inhibitor tolerant species [96], Muñoz-Páez et al. reported a decline in its abundance along with that of other H2 producing Clostridium species and enteric bacteria such as Escherichia, Enterobacter, indicating their susceptibility to furfural and 5-HMF. The abundance of Lactobacillus and some species of Clostridium, such as C. butyricum, was promoted at furfural concentrations below 1 g L−1 and 5-HMF concentrations below 0.19 g L−1, implying their decisive role in the detoxification of furfural (Fig. 4b and c) [21]. In a general, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are perceived as antagonistic in acidogenic H2 production as many studies have revealed that LAB inhibit H2 production through competition for substrates and bacteriocin production which inhibits H2 fermenters, thereby shifting H2 fermentation to lactate fermentation [101]. On the other hand, lactate produced by LAB may be used by some clostridial species as substrates for H2 production, explaining the augmented H2 production in the presence of Lactobacillus and lignocellulosic byproducts [101,102]. The presence of more than one inhibitory byproduct can have additive or synergistic inhibitory effects on H2 producing microbiota compared to the individual inhibitors. However, depending on the byproducts in the mixture and their concentrations, certain members of the microbiota may experience less inhibition than others, helping H2 producing microbiota to overcome the inhibitory effects [21]. According to Muñoz-Páez et al., the addition of a furfural and 5-HMF mixture resulted in a significant reduction in the abundance of Clostridium species, resulting in significant synergistic inhibition of H2 production (Fig. 4) [21]. Data on microbial population dynamics during inhibition by lignocellulosic byproducts are still sparse in the literature. Additional research is needed to investigate the cumulative effects of various lignocellulosic byproducts on H2 producing microbiota, which may help in establishing a microbial consortium capable of withstanding the synergistic inhibitory effects of these byproducts."
8,State of the art strategies to mitigate inhibition,
9,Process consideration for mitigation of inhibitors: reduction and detoxification,"4.1 Process consideration for mitigation of inhibitors: reduction and detoxification LCB has a heterogeneous chemical composition in which cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and other minor components are tightly bonded between the constituents [103]. Therefore, LCB should be processed to make it more homogeneous and amenable to biological breakdown and conversion, through a pretreatment step at a reasonable cost. Pretreatment is necessary to remove or reduce not only the lignin content in the substrate which interferes not only with enzymatic saccharification and/or microbial fermentation but is also structurally recalcitrant. The presence of lignin in microbial fermentation is undesirable because, although several bacteria have been reported to be able to degrade lignin (e.g., Streptomyces viridosporus T7A, Burkholderia cepacian, Citrobacter sp., Pseudomonas putida mt-2, Rhodococcus sp.), almost no bacteria have not been reported to be utilizing lignin for bioH2 production [104]. Lignin added to the dark fermentation acts as an inhibitor or is inert in the microbial conversion of biomass and increases the reactor volume and required energy cost [105,106]. Depending on the type of pretreatment reagents and reaction conditions, LCB can be totally or partially solubilized, altering the fates of three main constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin fractions) [107]. Three different process scenarios are (Fig. 5 ) [108,109]: (1) Pretreatment with acid – diluted acid results in partial biomass hydrolysis (typically, ~90% recovery of hemicellulose and 20–40% recovery of lignin) (Fig. 5a). (2) Pretreatment with an alkali–alkaline reagent results in considerable lignin solubilization (60–80%) and 20–40% hemicellulose hydrolysis (Fig. 5b). (3) Total hydrolysis using concentrated acid – strong acid (highly concentrated acid) at severe reaction conditions hydrolyzes both cellulose and hemicellulose into monomeric C6 and C5 sugars (Fig. 5c). (4) Pretreatment with low liquid input results in simple downstream processing which does not involve solid/liquid separation prior to lignin removal (Fig. 5d). The effective production process of bioH2 from LCB typically consists of pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and microbial fermentation. In addition to the three main unit processes, detoxification, catalyst recovery and recycling, and lignin separation and recovery are required depending on the type of chemical catalyst used in the pretreatment process and the pretreatment reaction conditions. Because of the inherent characteristics of biomass, hydrolysis processes should be considered to design a proper and effective pretreatment process. In addition to the lignin, as presented in the previous sections, furfural, 5-HMF, and phenolic compounds derived from lignin are often considered to be toxic to H2 fermentative microorganisms [11,16,17]. The fate of lignin in liquid or solid streams with other sugar components depends primarily on the pretreatment reagent used in the pretreatment, but the other toxic compounds derived from the degradation of carbohydrates and lignin are highly dependent on the severity of the pretreatment reaction. Severity factor was proposed as a measure of the intensity of the overall reaction conditions in pretreatment, combining reaction time and temperature into one variable. A modified/combined severity factor has also been proposed to integrate the effects of chemical concentration (pH) [110–112]. There is a trade-off between the pretreatment cost and the detoxification cost. In other words, if the severity of the pretreatment reaction is low, enzymatic hydrolysis yield and the hydrogen production yield cannot be improved; however, the formations of toxic substances can be reduced so that a detoxification process is not necessary or the product can be detoxified at a low cost. On the other hand, if the severity of the pretreatment reaction is high, it is expected to increase the enzyme hydrolysis yield and improve hydrogen production yield; however, toxic substances derived from carbohydrates and lignin are produced, and a detoxification process is necessary, and the operation cost is significantly increased. The acid hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose typically generates furfural and 5-HMF, while alkali pretreatment mainly produces phenolic compounds due to the hydrolysis of lignin [48]. Therefore, it is more difficult to prevent or control the formation of toxic substances in acid and alkali pretreatment (Fig. 5a and b) than in other pretreatments. Furthermore, in the complete hydrolysis process using concentrated acids (Fig. 5c), the formation and build-up of toxic substances cannot be avoided because the reaction severity is extremely high (Fig. 5a and b)."
10,Post-pretreatment: detoxification of hydrolysates,"4.2 Post-pretreatment: detoxification of hydrolysates The detoxification or conditioning of pretreated hydrolysates of LCB can eliminate the byproducts and minimize their inhibitory effects on H2 producing microbiota, thereby improving the utility of the substrate for dark fermentation. Approaches for detoxifying pretreated lignocellulosic slurries and hydrolysates include several conventional physical, chemical, and biological techniques such as heating and evaporation, steam stripping, electrochemical, liquid-liquid and liquid-solid extraction, treating with some chemicals, adsorption, and enzymatic and microbial removal (Table 3 ) [17,113–116]. The choice of detoxification methods is dependent on the type of LCB and the nature and concentration of inhibitory byproducts present in the pretreated hydrolysates [117]. Cheng et al. investigated the effectiveness of activated carbon adsorbent and domesticated H2 producing bacteria on detoxifying furfural (2 g L−1), 5-HMF (0.94 g L−1), and vanillin (0.5 g L−1) containing lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and found that this combination could eliminate 39.5%, 45.4%, and 84.8% of these inhibitors, respectively, and increase the H2 yield from acid pretreated water hyacinth hydrolysate by 29.7% when compared to the control (without activated carbon and domesticated bacteria) [118]. A recent analysis of bioH2 production from undetoxified (VFAs 93.4 g kg−1 and phenolic compounds 3.8 g kg−1 dry biomass) and activated carbon detoxified (VFAs 10 g kg−1 and phenolic compounds 3 g kg−1 dry biomass) acid hydrolysates of Agave tequilana bagasse found 33% higher bioH2 production with detoxification [119]. Hu et al. detoxified acid pretreated sugarcane bagasse by treating it with laccase and NaBH4 and by it washing with water, which yielded six times more H2 than treatment with laccase and NaBH4 alone [120]. However, Hu et al. proposed a co-culture strategy in which more than one strain of microorganism capable of biologically detoxifying the inhibitors are used in fermentation for enhanced H2 production from undetoxified hydrolysates. There are several detoxification approaches used in other biofuel production research; however, these methods have not been put into practice for detoxifying pretreated lignocellulose for bioH2 production. The application of these detoxification techniques might improve bioH2 production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The electrochemical method has been effective in detoxifying about 90% of phenolic inhibitors (syringaldehyde, vanillin) in lignocellulosic hydrolysates [113]. In electrochemical detoxification, the phenolic inhibitors are electrochemically converted to a radical form, polymerized, and then removed as a polymer form. On the other hand, volatile inhibitors such as aldehydes (furfural, 5-HMF) in the hydrolysates can be reduced using the evaporation technique [121]. However, this method also increases the concentrations of non-volatile inhibitors (e.g., lignin derivatives) [122]. Pyrochar prepared from the pyrolysis of anaerobic digestate could remove more than 94% of furanic inhibitors (1 g L−1) in the lignocellulosic hydrolysates when used in high amounts (40 g L−1) [115]. Activated carbon prepared from coconut shell is an excellent adsorbent of phenolic and furaldehyde inhibitors, which increased alcohol fermentation efficiency by 14-fold [123]. A continuous fixed-bed column packed with activated charcoal can be used as an effective, continuous, and reusable process with minimum loss of sugars [124]. Diananofiltration membrane separation processes, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis have also been used in xylitol and alcohol fermentation [125–127]. One of the major drawbacks of these detoxification methods are the necessity of a separate step, which increases the overall process cost. Moreover, many techniques which require addition of specific chemicals can result in the further inhibition of microorganisms (e.g., due to NH4OH, ethyl acetate). Many detoxification techniques are in preliminary stages of their development and evaluation. While others were not investigated enough to be considered as efficient. Hence, future studies should be directed towards assessing their effectiveness, optimization of process and process design, and large-scale applicability in bioH2 production from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Conventional detoxification techniques such as overliming, washing, and liquid-solid extraction can result in the loss of up to 30% of soluble carbohydrates in the hydrolysate and generate a considerable amount of wastewater [108,136]. Biological detoxification is a cost-effective alternative to the conventional process that relies on the tolerance and ability of certain microorganisms to degrade the lignocellulosic inhibitors as a part of their central carbon metabolism (Fig. 6 ) [136–138]. Several inhibitory byproducts undergo a series of oxidative, ortho-, meta-ring cleavage, decarboxylation, β-oxidation, and β-ketoadipate pathways to culminate into TCA cycle of central carbon metabolism where these byproducts are mineralized into CO2 and H2O (Figs. 3 and 6). Fungi are of special interest in biodetoxification of lignocellulosic inhibitors as it can degrade several inhibitors simultaneously [139,140]. Several bacterial species such as Bordetella sp. [132], Burkholderia cepacia [141], and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 [135] have been isolated which can specifically degrade the significant fractions of the lignocellulosic byproducts in the hydrolysate and could prove to be a useful engineering tool in the removal of these inhibitors. Although biological detoxification of lignocellulose has not been performed for the production of bioH2 extensively, these bacteria can be immobilized in carrier matrices and reused for several cycles of lignocellulosic detoxification and efficient degradation of inhibitors without affecting the sugars [131]. However, prolonged incubation times and a slow rate of detoxification limit their practical use. Elucidating the inhibitor degradation pathways in different inhibitor degrading microorganisms and the use of genetically modified bacteria can provide faster detoxification and full-scale application (Fig. 6) [136]. Of specific interest in the removal of inhibitory byproducts in the pretreated LCB has been enzymatic detoxification using free or immobilized laccase [142,143]. Laccase enzyme detoxifies various furanic and phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulose and improves biogas production in anaerobic digestion [144]. Use of laccases is advantageous because these enzymes can be used at higher temperature for efficient detoxification. Also, the crude enzyme preparations can achieve higher catalytic efficiencies and detoxification rate compared to microbial cells [145]. Its higher process cost limits the full-scale application of enzymatic detoxification using laccase. This drawback can be overcome by the reusability of laccase immobilized onto a suitable carrier. Saravanakumar et al. demonstrated the detoxification of furanic and phenolic inhibitors in pretreated LCB using laccase immobilized on bacterial cellulosic nanofibers [143]. The immobilized laccase could be reused for 16 cycles of detoxification process retaining 85% of its enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, separate detoxification requires an additional step, often involving harsh detoxification conditions that inevitably lead to the loss of fermentable sugars and make the overall process more costly. Biological detoxification is a cost-effective method; however, it requires prolonged incubation with detoxifying microbes, which also results in the loss of sugars. This could be avoided by employing in situ detoxification techniques which includes the possibility of performing detoxification and dark fermentation in the same reactor."
11,In situ detoxification strategies for cost-effective hydrogen production from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass,"4.3 In situ detoxification strategies for cost-effective hydrogen production from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass Many detoxification technologies that incorporate a separate step to the process increase the overall cost, while in situ detoxification lignocellulosic hydrolysate is cost-effective because it involves the removal of inhibitors during the fermentation process. In situ detoxification is a relatively new approach and one of the most straightforward methods for detoxifying lignocellulosic hydrolysates through the addition of chemicals, including alkali, reducing agents, polymers and/or microbial agents that can remove the inhibitory byproducts, eliminating the need for a separate detoxification step [146,147]. There are very few studies that employed in situ detoxification of inhibitors of bioH2 production by dark fermentation. Lin et al. proposed sodium borohydride as a suitable reducing agent for the simultaneous detoxification of lignocellulosic inhibitors (15 mM each of furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin, and syringaldehyde) in bioH2 production by mixed culture in dark fermentation broth containing glucose and xylose [122]. Detoxification with 30 mM NaBH4 showed higher reduction efficiencies for furfural and 5-HMF (96.7% and 91.7%, respectively) than for vanillin (77.3%) and syringaldehyde (69.3%), resulting in a 99.7% recovery of H2 yield. Reducing agents such as NaBH4 act by facilitating the reduction of toxic aldehydes, avoiding excess NADH consumption (a cofactor involved in redox reactions in cells) during dark fermentation and thereby improving biohydrogen production [122]. Hybrid immobilized beads prepared by encapsulating dried anaerobic granular seed sludge and activated carbon in calcium alginate, and chitosan carrier matrix have provided an effective means of detoxifying 5-HMF in situ in red algal (Gelidium amansii) hydrolysate [148]. Cells in immobilized seed sludge have a better 5-HMF tolerance and ability to produce H2 with a yield of 2.40 mol mol−1 of hexose, while activated carbon in the hybrid beads helps in the removal of toxic lignocellulosic inhibitors by adsorption. Genetically and metabolically engineered microorganisms have been increasingly applied to improving inhibitor tolerance in liquid biofuel productions [149]. Overexpression of aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and NADH-dependent oxidoreductase gene in Escherichia coli could promote the reduction of furanic and phenolic aldehydes [86,149]. However, dark fermentative production of H2 is mostly performed by mixed bacterial cultures; therefore, one possibility for enhancing the inhibitor tolerance of H2 producing microbiota is by bioaugmenting the consortium with these genetically modified bacteria. One of the major drawbacks of in situ biodetoxification through the employment of an inhibitor degrading microbial strain other than the fermentative strains is the possibility of sugars consumptions during the fermentation [150]. Lignocellulosic inhibitor-acclimatized H2-producing microbial consortium could be developed by culturing the microorganisms in the presence of increasing concentration of inhibitors. Increasing the tolerance of H2 producing microbiota could help avoid the detoxification step altogether making the process more economical."
12,Emerging alternative pretreatment strategies,"4.4 Emerging alternative pretreatment strategies Although conventional physico-chemical pretreatment methods (e.g., acid, alkali pretreatment, steam explosion) are more effective than other methods such as mechanical (e.g., milling, extrusion) and biological pretreatment, the use of large amounts of chemical catalysts, loss of carbohydrate and/or decomposition of sugars, and the formation of inhibitors cannot be avoided [151]. In addition, it should be noted that the critical factors that influence pretreatment performance include reaction time, reaction temperature, pH, catalyst concentration, and solid-to-liquid ratio. Conventional physicochemical pretreatment requires chemical catalyst recovery and detoxification before microbial fermentation. It, therefore, requires a lot of energy and equipment costs, which increases the cost of bioH2 production and harms the environment [152]. According to a previous cost analysis for biofuel production from LCB, pretreatment is one of the three most significant cost items in cellulosic ethanol production after enzyme and feedstock costs [153]. On the other hand, the desirable features of an economically-feasible pretreatment may include minimal loss or degradation of the carbohydrates, production of less or no toxic compounds, low capital cost, less extreme conditions to reduce operating and capital costs, and it should generate minimal wastes (Table 4) [109,154]. For this reason, various studies have been conducted to develop an economical pretreatment method. In particular, research has reported that a high enzyme saccharification rate and yield can be obtained using a small amount of enzyme during pretreatment [155–157]. After completion of pretreatment, the product stream is still composed of insoluble sugar polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and oligomers), which should be depolymerized into monomeric sugars to be utilized by H2 fermentative strains. Since enzymatic depolymerization is now accepted as a more controllable and environmentally friendly alternative to acid hydrolysis, the production of fermentable sugars requires cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolytic enzymes (cellulase and hemicellulase). Enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out using commercially available enzymes, which are expensive and, therefore, increase the total production cost of BioH2. An economic enzymatic hydrolysis process that results in a high yield using a small amount of enzyme can be achieved by the application of appropriate pretreatment methods and reaction conditions. Alternatively, considerable attention has been paid to environmental-friendly biological approaches as alternatives to mature chemical technologies since these processes do not form inhibitory compounds, and have mild operational conditions as well as low energy demands [50]. Biological pretreatment consists of the lignocellulolytic activity of several microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) on submerged biomass [158] or using solid-state [159] cultivation, causing the disintegration of their lignocellulosic structure and the saccharification of their hemicellulose-cellulose components [160]. In the last decade, several researchers have used fungal pretreatment of biomass containing higher lignin contents to improve bioH2 yield (Table 3) [161,162]. The use of white-rot fungi in the pretreatment of lignocellulose is of particular interest because of their laccase enzyme system, including laccase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase, which is very effective in degrading and depolymerizing lignin [160]. However, despite its utility, biological pretreatment suffers from a few drawbacks, such as a longer pretreatment time and consumption of fermentable sugars. These obstacles can be overcome by the selection of appropriate microbial species for specific types of LCB and optimizing the pretreatment conditions [151,163]. In addition to enzymatic or biological pretreatment, several emerging alternative pretreatment strategies have been proposed for the pretreatment of LCB, enhancing bioH2 yield (Table 3). These pretreatment strategies result in very low or no generation of inhibitory byproducts and should be investigated further to develop a cost-effective pretreatment strategy for enhancing bioH2 production [6,164]. Although various pretreatment methods have been developed to produce fermentable sugars effectively, it should be noted that there currently is no single pretreatment process that can be applied to all LCBs, leading to the conclusion that an appropriate pretreatment approach should be found for a given specific substrate."
13,Economic assessment of H2 production from lignocellulosic biomass considering pretreatment and detoxification,"Techno-economic analysis (TEA) of dark fermentative bioH2 production has been comprehensively conducted for food waste [170,171], agricultural waste [172,173], molasses [174], and others. As mentioned previously, the use of agricultural waste biomass containing lignocellulose or cellulose for bioH2 production via dark fermentation can contribute to sustainable global energy [173]. TEA for bioH2 production is generally conducted based on laboratory [173,175], pilot-scale [176], industrial-scale [170,173] data to calculate the capital/operating costs of production systems. The commercial software Aspen plus [170,172,173] and SuperPro [174,177] were used for mass/energy balance calculations and process simulation. Low-cost materials such as LCB and industrial residues generally determine the low cost of bioH2 production, and it tends to increase with pretreatment and process conditions [8]. Even though pretreatment of biomass and removal of inhibitory substances are essential in the utilization of LCB, the comprehensive cost analysis of various pretreatment techniques along with the removal of inhibitors is not addressed significantly regarding bioH2 production. Instead, few researchers have estimated the effects of pretreatment and detoxification on the cost of producing n-butanol [178] and bioethanol [179] using LCB as a substrate. Therefore, further research should focus on the contribution of both processes to unit bioH2 production costs. To introduce an economic assessment of bioH2 production from pretreated LCB, TEA for pretreatment, detoxification, and dark fermentative bioH2 production from LCB are reviewed in this section."
14,Cost of pretreatment and detoxification for lignocellulosic biomass,"5.1 Cost of pretreatment and detoxification for lignocellulosic biomass The selection of pretreatment technology for LCB is a crucial factor in their techno-economic feasibility due to their high contribution 30–32% to the overall process cost. Thermo-chemical and wet oxidation pretreatments have a high recovery rate, though these processes may yet not be feasible for large scale applications [180]. The pretreatment steps necessary for an economically viable biorefinery may constitute up to 50% of the capital cost of equipment as well as adding 20–25% to the operational costs for chemicals and steam [181]. Steam explosion, ammonium hydroxide, and dilute acid hydrolysis are suitable for lignin barrier removal on a commercial scale, and the use of a specific process depends on the type of LCB. The H2 production scenario including pretreatment reduces total energy loss, which is significantly related to total energy production costs. The cost of sugar production using biological pretreatment was $1.41 kg−1, which is higher than that from the steam explosion ($0.43 kg−1), sulfuric acid ($0.42 kg−1), or ammonia fiber explosion ($0.65 kg−1). To evaluate the economic feasibility of implementing an energy intensive (EI) pretreatment process (e.g., thermochemical processes), an energy balance analysis is critical. In EI pretreatment of LCB, achieving positive energy ratio and net energy determine the scalability of the bioH2 production process. To implement these processes at a large scale, the input energy must be balanced by the extra H2 produced as a result of pretreatment. Yukesh Kannah et al. performed energy analysis for bioH2 production from rice straw employing an EI pretreatment: dispersion thermochemical disintegration (80 °C, pH 8–12 using 1 N NaOH) [182]. A positive net energy production of about 0.39621 kWh kg−1 rice straw was recorded for such pretreatment process compared to a lesser EI process where negative net energy (−0.8594 kWh kg−1 rice straw) was achieved (Table 5 ). Energy ratio of >1 implied net energy production, indicating that EI pretreatments can be energetically efficient as these techniques result in better digestibility of LCB and higher sugar yield which are easily converted to bioH2 [182]. The economic analysis cost compensations through pretreatment to increase bioH2 yield also should be considered to conduct more realistic development. Ljunggren et al. compared the production cost of bioH2 from acid pretreated barley straw with high water-insoluble solids and low water-insoluble solids [172]. The production cost of bioH2 production was evaluated as 421.7 € GJ−1 and 422.1 € GJ−1. Sanchez et al. showed that acid pretreatment configuration with bioH2 sale was a sustainable option with a global sustainability indicator of 0.007 US$ MJout −1 [183]."
15,Cost of dark fermentative H2 production from lignocellulosic biomass,"5.2 Cost of dark fermentative H2 production from lignocellulosic biomass The substrates used in the production of bioH2 have a significant influence on the overall process cost, indicating the necessity of using an inexpensive and sustainable feedstock such as LCB. The research on lignocellulose-based bioH2 production, including its economic feasibility, is well-reviewed by Kumar et al. [184]. For realistic production of bioH2 on a commercial scale, the cost of hydrogen production must be discussed in the context of a complete life cycle, supply management, and other factors (e.g., taxation, depreciation, gross earning expenses). Ljunggren et al. [172] compared biological fermentation (dark fermentation and photo-fermentation) of barley straw, a readily available lignocellulosic feedstock. Pretreatment of biomass feedstock was performed using sulfuric acid-catalyzed steam conditioning at 0.2 wt% acid, 4–20 bar, and 95–190 °C. The adjusted production cost of bioH2 was 421.7 € GJ−1 (Table 6 ). To make bioH2 production cost-competitive, an increase in productivity, yield, and tolerance to inhibiting factors and variation in pH is crucial. Tapia-Rodríguez et al. [175] employed agave bagasse, which has a high percentage of cellulose (42%), hemicellulose (20%), and lignin (15%) as the lignocellulosic substrate for the hydrolysis assays. Experimental results show that the hydrogen production yield ranged from 20.01 L kg−1 bagasse (Zymapect) to 51.07 L kg−1 bagasse (Stonezyme). The result of preliminary cost analysis differed from the yield, and Celluclast 1.5 L was more productive with a lower cost ($2.58 L−1 H2) than the other options (Stonezyme, Cellulast 50XL, Zymapect). Han et al. [170] designed a 10-ton d−1 bioH2 production plant by food waste treatment. The process was divided into the pretreatment, solid-state fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis of food waste, seed culture, dark fermentative bioH2 production, and biogas purification. A lower unit H2 production cost ($2.3 m-3) than the commercial price ($2.7 m-3) was obtained due to the advantages of combined bioprocess with a short hydrolysis time and high starch conversion rate. Another study suggested a continuous mixed immobilized sludge reactor for DF using molasses [174] with heat pretreatment at 100 °C for 6 h. The return of investment (ROI) increased from −37.2% to 47.3% when the scale increased from 10.0 m3 to 50.0 m3 and the price of bioH2 was fixed at $2.7 m−3 . Li et al. [173] have tried to apply a TEA to dark fermentation using both beverage wastewater and mushroom farm solid waste (mainly consisting of 55.29% holocellulose and 16.54% lignin). The agricultural waste feedstock was pretreated with a two-step acid hydrolysis process suing sulfuric acid (55%) to degrade cellulose at a temperature of 40 °C for 20 min in the first step and then hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid (5.9%) for 20 min in the second step. The economic comparison between wastewater and agricultural waste at a 10 m3 of scale shows that the total equipment cost was $221,700 and $299,200, and the total production cost was $70,500 and $78,600. The complete hydrolysis of lignocelluloses by pretreatment had an additional cost of about $39,800. The cost for scale-up was also simulated about 10.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0, 300.0, and 400.0 m3 using a H2 price fixed at $2.7 m−3 and it was found that larger-scale plants can enhance the economic feasibility of bioH2 production. Recent research reported that lignocellulosic bioH2 production has the potential to be economically feasible, but, in addition to a low yield, biomass handling, pretreatment, detoxification, and reactor designs are still immature making it an uncompetitive bioconversion technology for bioH2 production [186]. Therefore, more research is required on bioH2 production from LCB at various scales considering pretreatment and detoxification."
16,Factors hindering the large-scale implementation of dark fermentative bioH2 production,"H2 is a very attractive fuel because of its higher heating value; however, bioH2 production cost has been uncompetitive compared to natural gas (0.134 US$ kg−1), H2 produced by steam reforming of methane (1.0–2.0 US$ kg−1) and electrolysis (4.0–6.0 US$ kg−1) [8]. The economic feasibility of large scale bioH2 production depends largely on the substrate used, indicating the need to use low-cost feedstock such as LCB [187]. Han et al. concluded that the cost of bioH2 production can be made feasible if the production scale is higher than 50 m3 [174]. However, many factors have been identified to limit the large-scale implementation of the dark fermentative bioH2 production from LCB. The major setback of the process is low substrates conversion due to decreased digestibility of LCB and low H2 yield [186]. These problems can be solved by using more efficient bioreactor design, pretreatment of substrates, process improvement, and potent microbial seed culture. However, most studies on dark fermentative production of bioH2 have been conducted at lab-scale and there was no promising progress towards the pilot and industrial scale [186,188]. Additional issues, such as cost parameters related to the configuration of bioreactors including design, development, construction, and operation, play a significant role and may impede the large-scale implementation of dark fermentation. Usually, continuous stirred-tank reactors, up-flow anaerobic sludge bed reactors, fixed bed anaerobic reactors, and sequencing batch reactors are widely selected configurations to produce bioH2 production [189]. Besides, operating conditions such as temperature, pH, and hydraulic retention time, H2 partial pressure are important to determine the overall cost-efficiency of bioH2 in a large-scale application [190]. These factors may cause changes in intermediate organic metabolites, microbial consortia in larger-scale plants. For example, to produce bioH2, shorter HRT is required even though it causes a lower pH level and makes it hard to maintain reactor conditions [190]. In the case of lignocellulosic hydrolysate generated by acid hydrolysis, the separation of solid and liquid hydrolysate fractions also affects the overall production cost of bioH2 and feasibility for implementation on a larger scale. In large scale applications, the commonly used techniques such as centrifugation and vacuum filters may have some problems related to the additional washing process which can increase the input energy [191]. The dark fermentation process has also required the use of membranes and compressors for the separation/purification of produced bioH2 [192]. Therefore, the reduction of capital costs associated with these facilities should also be considered to challenge large scale bioH2 production. However, the results of a handful of studies conducting bioH2 production at the pilot-scale suggest that larger-scale implementation of bioH2 production could be feasible. Lu et al. evaluated dark fermentative bioH2 production from activated sludge in a 3.0 m3 pilot-scale continuous-flow fermenter and reported a maximum H2 production rate of 100.16 mol m−3 d−1 at a yield of 3.34 mmol g−1 [193]. Balachandar et al. reported a 125.0% higher average H2 production rate and 32.79% higher H2 yield in 10.0 m3 pilot-scale fermenter compared to 0.002 m3 lab-scale fermenter both utilizing cane molasses, distillery effluent and starchy wastewater [194]. In dark fermentative bioH2 production, a major portion of the substrate is converted into VFAs and alcohols which remain unutilized by the H2-fermentative microbiota, resulting in decreased overall energy yield. Thus, the production cost of bioH2 can also be minimized by coupling it with anaerobic digestion, where the leftover substrate with VFAs and other metabolites from dark fermentation can be utilized as substrates for biomethane production in a dual stage dark fermentation-anaerobic digestion system. This dual stage bioH2-bioCH4 production will improve the overall energy recovery from LCB and other feedstock, thereby making the entire process economically feasible [186]."
17,Concluding remarks and future perspectives,"LCB can be a better feedstock for bioH2 production in that it is a sustainable and inexpensive feedstock for dark fermentation. Although bioH2 technology seems to be promising, the complex structure of lignocellulose represents a bottleneck for biomass conversion to H2, requiring intense pretreatment or a combination of pretreatment and inhibitor detoxification, making the process economically prohibitive. Alcohol fermentation generally involves the use of single microorganism; therefore, aseptic conditions must be maintained which complicates the process control. On the other hand, anaerobic digestion and acidogenic H2 production involve mixed microbial consortia, which avoids the requirements of maintaining aseptic conditions, thereby making the whole process simple and cost-effective. However, H2 producing microbiota are simpler than anaerobic digestion microbiota and are vulnerable to lignocellulosic inhibitors due to their low diversity, high sensitivity, lower inoculum-to-substrate ratio, and short substrate retention time in dark fermentation. Consequently, lignocellulosic inhibitors can suppress the acidogenic bacteria producing H2, acetate, and butyrate, and promote other bacteria to shift the metabolic pathway to ethanol, propionate, and lactate. Therefore, suitable and cost-effective detoxification methods must be developed, and their technological and economic feasibility must be assessed. Given these factors, in situ detoxification could play a crucial role in the removal of lignocellulosic inhibitors. Investigations on the possibility of bio-augmenting the H2 producing microbiota with genetically and/or metabolically engineered or naturally occurring resistant bacteria are underway, which could prove to be an effective method of in situ detoxification. However, positive outcomes on such research should be followed by their application in larger-scale bioH2 production. Metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analysis of H2 producing microbiota could be useful for elucidating the tolerance mechanism and screening target genes responsible for inhibitor tolerance. Additionally, appropriate pretreatment methods that cause minimal or no inhibitor formation should be developed and/or assessed for bioH2 production from individual types and combinations of LCB. This could eliminate the detoxification step and reduce the overall process cost. Lastly, large scale advanced studies on bioH2 production from LCB are required to overcome the technological and economic hurdles."
