0,Introduction,"Boron (B) is an essential element in solid and liquid minerals (Kistler and Helvaci, 1994). The content of boron in the earth's crust is only 10 mg/L, accounting for 0.001% of the soil elements (Mortvedt et al., 1972). Although solid boron minerals in China are low-grade ores, liquid boron minerals in groundwater and salt lakes contain plentiful boron reserves (LI et al., 2009; U.S. Geological Survey, 2020; Wolska and Bryjak, 2013). Boron and its compounds are widely used in glass and ceramic production (Ding et al., 1994; Pye et al., 2012), agriculture (Gupta, 1993), and the nuclear industry (Subramanian et al., 2010). However, the element is toxic to humans and the World Health Organization (2011) specifically stipulated that the boron concentration in drinking water should be below 0.5 mg/L. It is also a contaminant in battery-grade lithium carbonate that causes serious drawbacks. The desirable boron content in brine should be less than 30 mg/L to guarantee a better quality of Li2CO3 (Brown and Boryta, 1993; Yan et al., 2008). Therefore, it is important to separate boron from brine for mineral applications and to remove boron contaminants for the quality of lithium carbonate. Methods to separate boron from brine or wastewater include chemical precipitation (García-Soto and Camacho, 2009; Rioyo et al., 2018), adsorption (Guan et al., 2016), membrane technologies (Alharati et al., 2017; Dydo and Turek, 2014), and solvent extraction (Egneus and Uppström, 1973; Grinstead, 1972). Chemical precipitation is usually conducted in an alkaline environment, which demands numerous alkali compounds and produces extra solid waste. Adsorption materials vary from chelating resins (Darwish et al., 2015), activated carbon (Kluczka et al., 2019), oxides (Heredia et al., 2019) and hydroxides (Jiang et al., 2007). Although adsorption can achieve excellent boron removal efficiency, low adsorption capacity restricts its application and it is expensive when the initial boron concentration is over 1 g/L. Membrane technologies, such as electrodialysis and reverse osmosis, are also too expensive for boron extraction (Shi et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2010). On the contrary, organic solvents display larger boron extraction capacities and lower costs than those of adsorption materials, making solvent extraction a competitive and promising technology for boron extraction from concentrated brine (Folkestad et al., 1974). Selecting suitable agents is crucial for successful solvent extraction. Commonly, boron extraction agents are categorized as mono-hydroxy alcohols (mono alcohols) (Hejda and Jedináková, 1983; Peng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016), di-hydroxy alcohols (diols) (Karakaplan et al., 2004; Tural et al., 2007), phenols (Brooks et al., 2018) and novel ionic liquids (Joshi et al., 2012). It has been reported that aliphatic alcohols with 8–12 carbons demonstrate high boron extraction efficiency (Karakaplan et al., 2003). Alcohols, including 2-ethylhexanol, isoamyl alcohol (Vinogradov, 1962), 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol (EHD) (Lü et al., 2014), TMPD (Kumar et al., 2015), and 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol (BEPD) (Kwon et al., 2005a) have been reported for various boron extractions. Zhang et al. (2016) used 2-ethylheaxnol (50%, v/v) to extract boron from brine, obtaining high-purity boric acid products by employing water as the stripping agent. They also conducted a three-stage countercurrent extraction and stripping to reduce the boron in brine from 2.48 g/L to 10.8 mg/L. 2-Ethylhexanol was also used in macrolide production to replace butyl acetate (Li et al., 1996). According to Li et al. (2005), 2-ethylhexanol demonstrated less solvents loss in the manufacturing of erythromycin compared to butyl acetate, which has already been applied by multiple Chinese companies. Peng et al. (2018) reported a novel mono alcohol, 2-butyl-1-n-octanol, exhibiting an overall boric acid extraction efficiency of 99.35% and stripping efficiency of 99.63%. However, the price of 2-butyl-1- n-octanol was too high for feasible operation. Diols show better extraction efficiency and capacity than those of mono alcohols. Fan et al. (2018) reported that EHD (30%, v/v) successfully extracted boron from underground water that had an initial boron concentration of 5.43 g/L. Matsuo et al. (2015) calculated the extraction energy change using the B3LYP functional and the 6–31++G(d,p) basis set. The binding energy between TMPD and boric acid was much lower than that of between EHD and boric acid when eliminating boron from soluble silica. They also found that TMPD has better extraction performance than EHD owing to the greater number of neighboring carbons on its central carbon. The stripping of diols is much more difficult than that of mono alcohols. To realize the recycling of diols, it is usually alkaline materials that strip the loaded organic phase (Kwon et al., 2005a). Another crucial factor is avoiding emulsification during stripping. Kwon et al. (2005b) found that 25% ammonia caused severe emulsification that interfered with recycling, as did 5 mol/L KOH. However, studies on how alkaline concentrations and agents affect emulsification are still limited. It is necessary to consider these factors to avoid emulsification during extraction. To precisely understand the extraction process, the extraction mechanism should be studied experimentally and theoretically. Lee et al. (2017) investigated the chemical adsorption of boric acid by the hydroxyl groups on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and used frequency calculation, IR, and Raman Spectra to identify the molecular vibrations corresponding to boron chemically bonding with PVA. Déjugnat et al. (2014) used DFT calculation to report the extraction mechanisms of different inorganic acids with malonamide. Kunimoto et al. (2018) found that the energy barrier was low when water was used as the solvent in the extraction of boron from silica solution. Nevertheless, studies on how other solvents affect extraction are limited, including those regarding mono alcohols, sulfonated kerosene (SK), chloroform, and toluene. In this study, TMPD dissolved in 2-ethylhexanol was selected to remove boron from concentrated brine. The optimal parameters to achieve higher extraction efficiency were determined by varying the reaction conditions, such as the alcohol concentrations, lithium and solvents loss, pH, temperature, and phase ratios. The recycling of the loaded organic phase by scrubbing and stripping was investigated. The results indicated that this process could be a potential method for deep boron removal from lithium-rich brine."
1,Experiment,
2,Reagents and brine,"2.1 Reagents and brine All the reagents used in this study were of analytical grade. 2-Ethylhexanol (C8H18O, Mw = 130.23, purity >98%) and TMPD (C8H18O2, Mw = 146.23, purity >98%) were provided by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. SK was supplied by Shanghai Rare-Earth Chemical Co., Ltd. The rest reagents were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The water used was deionized. The brine was the outlet stream of electrodialysis and then concentrated by evaporation. The main components and physical parameters are listed in Table 1 . Organic solvents were prepared by mixing TMPD, 2-ethylhexanol, and SK with different proportions."
3,Analysis,"2.2 Analysis In the aqueous phase, low boron concentration was analyzed by the Azomethine H method and high boron concentration was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, ARCOS FHS12, Spectro, Germany). The lithium concentration was analyzed by ICP-OES, too. The boron concentration in the organic phase was measured after fully stripping into the aqueous phase and confirmed by mass balance. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was measured in the 4000- 450 cm−1 range (Magan IR550, Nicolet, United States). The loss of the organic solvents into the aqueous phase was estimated by Total Organic Carbon (vario TOC, Elementar, Germany). The viscosities were measured by MCR 702 MultiDrive rheometer (Anton Paar, Austria). The interfacial tensions were measured by automatic tensionmeter (JK99B, Powereach, China) using a platinum ring. The chloride ion was analyzed with silver nitrate titrations. The magnesium was titrated by EDTA method with indicator, Eriochrome Black T. All titrations were carried out at least twice. The extraction efficiency (E/%), distribution ratio (D), lithium loss (L/%) and solvents loss (SL/%) and stripping efficiency (SE/%) were calculated as Eq. (1) to Eq. (5), respectively.

4,Extraction,"2.3 Extraction All extraction experiments were conducted in glass reactors (150 mL) lasting 2 h with a stirring rate of 500 rpm. The extraction process is mainly controlled by mass transfer at the liquid-liquid interface (Kunimoto et al., 2018). Stirring rate was set at high value to guarantee dispersion of two phases. Then the mixture was settled in separation funnels for 30 min. The O/A phase ratios were 1 if without further statements (A and O stand for the aqueous and organic phase, respectively). All experiments were carried out at 298±1 K if without further statements. Two-stage countercurrent extraction was carried out (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary data). The direction of flow went as the arrows indicated. Addition of new aqueous phase started a new cycle. The boron concentration in the aqueous phase remained constant after 3 cycles. The experiments were repeated at least twice to assure the authenticity of the results and the standard deviations were within 2%."
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation The extraction mechanism was studied by DFT. The exchange correlation functional used in the calculation was B3LYP (Becke, 1993; Stephens et al., 1994) and the basis set was 6–31++G(d,p) (Matsuo et al., 2015). The structure of transitional state (TS) was acquired by DFT calculation. All structures showed only one imaginary frequency, which were verified by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis. Single-point energy was calculated at B2PLYPD3 (Grimme et al., 2010)/def2TZVP (Weigend and Ahlrichs, 2005) level with higher accuracy. Solvation Model based on Density, SMD (Marenich et al., 2009), was added to consider solvent effect on free energy. DFT calculation was run by the Gaussian 09 software package (Frisch et al., 2009)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Solvents selection,"3.1 Solvents selection Regular solvents that have been previously used in practice can be employed, or new solvents can be selected based on the substances being extracted (Li, 2018). The exceptional extraction efficiency of TMPD was evident in both the literature (Karakaplan et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2015; Kunimoto et al., 2018; Kwon et al., 2005b; Matsuo et al., 2015) and preliminary experiment; therefore, it was selected as the main extractant. The extraction system also requires diluents to decrease the viscosity. Common diluents vary from toluene (Matsuo et al., 2015), SK (Fortuny et al., 2012), chloroform (Kumar et al., 2015) and liquid paraffin. Mono alcohols (e.g., 2-ethylhexanol) can also be used as a diluent/solvent to reduce solvents loss (Matsumoto et al., 2006). Though toluene and chloroform have shown great performance as diluents in previous experiments, their strong volatility requires a large amount of supplementary material. Based on volatility, toxicity and environmental influence, SK was ultimately chosen as the diluent. However, a mono alcohol solvent is also required to help with the solubility of TMPD in SK, which would otherwise be less than 1 g/100 g (Flick, 1998). n-Pentanol, isoamyl alcohol and 2-ethylhexanol were the mono alcohols tested for their ability to reduce solvents and lithium loss. The concentration of TMPD was fixed of 0.68 mol/L with solvents of 30% (v/v). The extraction results of different solvents were shown in Table 2 . The extraction efficiency for all three solvents was above 98%, but among the three solvents, 2-ethylhexanol displayed the lowest lithium loss (1.73%) and solvents loss (0.16%) for a single stage. This was consistent with the higher solubility properties of n-pentanol and isoamyl alcohol. Consequently, 2-ethylhexanol was chosen as the solvent, with SK as the diluent."
8,Extraction mechanism,"3.2 Extraction mechanism 3.2.1 Experimental analysis Boric acid is the dominant existence under acidic conditions in the aqueous phase (Mesmer et al., 1972). Therefore, the chemical reaction between boric acid and alcohol is predicted as follows: (6) aR OH n + H 3 BO 3 → H 3 BO 3 ⋅ aR OH n The association constant a can be calculated using logarithm-slope method. From Eq. (6), the equation of equilibrium constant K is given as Eq. (7): (7) K = H 3 B O 3 ⋅ a R O H n o r g a n i c H 3 B O 3 a q u e o u s R O H n o r g a n i c a (8) D = C B , organic C B , aqueous = H 3 BO 3 ⋅ aR OH n organic R OH n organic By taking logarithm form of Eq. (7) and remodel of distribution ratio, lgD and lg R(OH) n has a linear relationship: (9) lgD = lgK + alg R OH n The association constants, a, were 1.736 for mono alcohol (n = 1) and 1.268 for diol (n = 2), respectively (Fig. 1 ). For feed brine with diverse compositions, the association constant is quite distinct. Zhang et al. (2016) reported a of 0.7 for 2-ethylhexanol in boron extraction from East Taijinaier Salt Lake brine. Different association constants indicated that there were two different mechanisms for mono alcohol and diol. In the part of 2-ethylhexanol, the majority of the borate esters were di-esters by reaction of a single boric acid molecule with two mono alcohol molecules. On the contrary, the a of 1.268 for diol indicated that a single TMPD molecule reacted with a single boric acid molecule during extraction. Nevertheless, the main form of borate esters could not be determined specifically. The FT-IR spectra of TMPD both before and after extraction were shown in Fig. 2 for further analysis of the extraction mechanism. It showed obvious shift and intensity for the OH stretching vibration in the 3500–3100 cm−1. Apart from that, two new absorption peaks were found in the 1465–1272 cm−1 region, both representing for an aliphatic CO bond. Besides, the absorption peak at 665 cm−1 confirmed BO bond in the organic phase. No significant shift and intensity loss were found at 2930 cm−1. Therefore, the main complex formed by TMPD and boric acid contained two C–O–B ester bonds, which is consistent with previous study of neutral complexes of boric acid and diols (Bachelier and Verchere, 1995). The FT-IR spectra of 2-ethylhexanol presented similar pattern with TMPD (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary data). All study indicated the esterification took place between boric acid and alcohols. 3.2.2 Transitional state One or several intermediates were formed during the reaction, but because there could be countless reaction paths, it is difficult to correctly predict and describe them. Transitional state (TS) theory was used to simplify the reaction path and determine the structure of the productfor further study of the TMPD extraction mechanism. In Section 3.2.1, two C–O–B bonds were found in the product, each corresponding to a transitional state. As shown in Fig. 3 (the hydrogen atom on the carbon chain was omitted for observation), two transitional states were obtained with only one imaginary frequenecy. In TS1, a water molecule and monoborate were formed from the hydroxyl on the third carbon of TMPD (3-OH) reacting with boric acid. The 3-OH oxygen and the boron vibrated toward each other while the 3-OH hydrogen attacked one of the boric acid oxygens. In TS2, the boron and the oxygen of the 1-OH of TMPD reacted, forming a second water molecule. The structures of both TSs were analyzed using IRC analysis, which showed that the intermediates obtained by both TSs were identical. The reactant and product along the reaction path are shown in Fig. S3 (see the Supplementary data). After two esterifications, two water molecules were removed and a six-membered cycloborate ester was formed. The solvent effect was analyzed by DFT calculation using the SMD model. Since n-pentanol and isoamyl alcohol are isomers, only n-pentanol was calculated. The diluent, SK, was also considered in the calculation as a solvent for comparison. The energy change and activation energy during TMPD extraction in different solvents were calculated to determine and verify the solvent selection. Since the solvent model in Gaussian 09 does not include 2-ethylhexanol and SK, they were replaced with solvents possessing similar dielectric constants. 2-Ethylhexanol was replaced by its isomer n-octanol and SK was replaced by tetralin (the dielectric constants of SK and tetralin are 2.80 and 2.77, respectively). The results were shown in Fig. 4 . The extractions through TS1 and TS2 using SK and 2-ethylhexanol both exhibited lower activation energies than that of n-pentanol, but the absolute value of the extraction binding energy (Δr G m Θ) of 2-ethylhexanol and n-pentanol was higher than that of SK. It can be concluded that extraction was easier to perform with 2-ethylhexanol or SK, but the product was more stable with 2-ethylhexanol or n-pentanol. Consequently, 2-ethylhexanol was a better solvent than n-pentanol and SK for boron extracion with TMPD, verifying the experimental results in Section 3.1."
9,Extraction parameters,"3.3 Extraction parameters 3.3.1 Effect of TMPD concentration The effect of TMPD concentration on extraction efficiency was investigated using 40% (v/v) 2-ethylhexanol as the solvent and SK as the diluent. Fig. 5 showed that both distribution ratio and the extraction efficiency had a positive correlation with TMPD concentration. And the extraction efficiency reached 92.78% at 0.34 mol/L TMPD. The average extraction efficiency was over 90% for all concentrations, which proved excellent extraction ability of TMPD. Nevertheless, there was still 29.74 mg/L boron remaining in the raffinate even when TMPD was 2.74 mol/L, implying that it would require additional stages to remove the remnant. Since the extraction efficiency was sufficient enough when TMPD was over 0.68 mol/L, the suitable TMPD concentration would be 0.68 mol/L. However, a part of lithium was lost along the process. Fig. 6 compared the lithium loss for various TMPD concentrations. Higher concentrations of diol brought more lithium loss which reached a climax of 7.73% at 2.74 mol/L TMPD. The concentrations of boron and other cations in the raffinate were shown in Fig. S4 (see the Supplementary data). The conditions were under temperature of 298.15 K for 2 h blending with a phase ratio of 1. Results of concentrations of Li, Na, K, and Mg showed little change. Only the boron concentration suffered a dramatic fall during the extraction process. Therefore, the separation of boron by solvent extraction is desirable and feasible. The concentration of TMPD was determined to be 0.68 mol/L with the extraction efficiency of 98.97% and lithium loss of 3.28% for a single stage. (TMPD was dissolved in 2-ethylhexanol of 40% v/v) 3.3.2 Effect of 2-ethylhexanol concentration as solvent for TMPD In terms of lithium and solvents loss, viscosity and interfacial tension, the optimal 2-ethylhexanol concentration was investigated. US patent, No. 5219550 (Brown and Boryta, 1993) reported 2-ethylhexanol should be lower than 40% (v/v) to avoid significant lithium loss. Pre-experiments also showed that 2-ethylhexanol over 50% (v/v) brought severe lithium loss, but little improvement on extraction efficiency. Therefore, the 2-ethylhexanol concentration ranged from 10% to 50% (v/v) for the study. Fig. 7 showed that the lithium loss increased with alcohol concentration and reached 5.07% with 50% (v/v) 2-ethylhexanol. Solvents loss could cause high TOC value in the raffinate, which requires extra cost for organic compounds treatment. As the 2-ethylhexanol concentration raised, solvents loss fell sharply to 0.08% at 30% (v/v) and continued with a slight drop. The results indicated that the solubility of solvents into the brine was conversely lower with higher 2-ethylhexanol concentration. Therefore, the optimal 2-ethylhexanol concentration was 30% (v/v) with 0.08% solvents loss and 2.28% lithium loss. Viscosity is essential to the extraction systems—low viscosity could facilitate blending and separation of two phases, while high viscosity is detrimental to flow and mass transfer. From the viscosity data in Fig. 8 , the 2-ethylhexanol concentration should be below 40% (v/v) to guarantee smaller viscosity. Furthermore, the interfacial tension between two phases was measured under different 2-ethyhexanol concentrations. Large interfacial tension could make the fine droplets coalesce for separation. Interfacial tension also plays a key role in addressing emulsification of the organic phase. Although small interfacial tension is beneficial for droplets to disperse, emulsification tends to occur along. Consequently, the ideal solvents should have high interfacial tension and low viscosity at the same time. Based on above factors, 30% (v/v) 2-ethylhexanol with relatively higher interfacial tension and suitable viscosity was selected for the extraction system. However, there are problems of 2-ethylhexanol that could not be ignored, such as 1000 mg/L solubility, flash point of 73 °C and vapor pressure of 0.048 kPa at 20 °C. It would recommend that the raffinate could be treated with resins or activated carbons to remove the organic compounds without introducing new contaminants. 3.3.3 Effect of pH and temperature Boron existence in the aqueous phase is affected by various factors including pH (Van Duin et al., 1984), concentrations (Ishihara et al., 1994) and temperature (Simonson et al., 1988; Simonson et al., 1987). It generally appears as boric acid when pH is under 7 and boric acid nearly accounts for over 99% boron at strong acid conditions. To understand how boron existence affects the extraction, the effect of pH on extraction efficiency was studied under different acidic conditions. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the extraction efficiency declined from pH = 1 to pH = 5, where it hit the bottom with only 53.41%. The result was also consistent with the content of boric acid in the aqueous phase, which decreases as pH increases (Mesmer et al., 1972). Since the extraction was mainly esterification between boric acid and alcohol, the extraction efficiency experienced a fall inevitably. The pH of feed brine was measured to be 1.55 with extraction efficiency of 92.80%. Hence, the concentrated brine could be processed by solvent extraction without any pH adjustment. Temperature had a modest effect on the extraction as shown in Fig. 9(b). The extraction efficiency remained over 90.86% when the temperature varied from 288.15 K to 328.15 K. It can be extrapolated that in this case, the thermodynamic parameters did not affect the extraction efficiency profoundly. Recent study of boron existence under various temperatures showed that forms of boric acid dominate below 328.15 K (Liu et al., 2019). Accordingly, the operation temperature was selected to be 298.15 K, avoiding extra cost of heat exchange. 3.3.4 Effect of phase ratio Fig. S5 (see the Supplementary data) compared the effect of phase ratios on extraction efficiency. As phase ratios (O/A) rose up, the extraction efficiency increased as well. However, the difference of extraction efficiency between phase ratios of 2:1 and 1 was little with each being 98.67% and 97.96%, respectively. Consequently, the phase ratio remained to be 1. The extraction equilibrium line of mixed alcohols was illustrated in Fig. 10 . By using McCable-Thiele method, it demanded two-stage countercurrent extraction to remove the boron from concentrated brine utterly. The results of two-stage extraction were shown in Table 3 . The remaining boron in the raffinate was only 2.2 mg/L with the extraction efficiency of 99.95%. Compared to 2-butyl-1-n-octanol (Peng et al., 2018) and 2-ethylhexanol (Zhang et al., 2016), the mixed alcohols demonstrated stronger ability to deeply remove boron from brine. After two-stage extraction, the lithium and solvents loss reached 2.17%, 0.12%, respectively."
10,Recover of extractants,"3.4 Recover of extractants 3.4.1 Two-stage countercurrent scrubbing Due to the partial loss of lithium, two-stage countercurrent scrubbing was conducted to recover the lithium. The aqueous phase was replaced by deionized water. Table 4 listed the detailed statistics of scrubbing. Little boron was stripped from the loaded organic phase with 11.46% stripping efficiency. The lithium in the scrubbing solution was 210.9 mg/L with a recovery rate of 16.86%. But the solvents loss of 1.05% was more serious than those of extraction (0.12%). 3.4.2 Stripping parameters The effect of stripping agents was investigated to strip the boric acid and recover the extractants. Fig. 11(a) compared different concentrations of sodium hydroxide and ammonia with a phase ratio of 1. The stripping efficiency came to the top of 99.66% at 0.4 mol/L NaOH. However, severe emulsification occurred over 0.3 mol/L NaOH which made it difficult to recycle the extractants. As for ammonia, the stripping efficiency was only 28.77% at 0.5 mol/L which was far smaller than NaOH. Further experimental results showed that for 0.3 mol/L NaOH solution, the stripping capacity for boric acid reached maximum by a single stage with an O/A phase ratio of 1. The stripping agent was determined to be 0.2 mol/L NaOH. The effect of phase ratios for stripping was shown in Fig. 11(b). The stripping efficiency was nearly over 99% with phase ratio of 1:3. It declined to 89.83% as the phase ratio increased to 1:2 and continued to drop. Emulsification was observed with phase ratios smaller than or equal to 1:2.5. As a result, the stripping O/A phase ratio was decided to be 1:2. 3.4.3 Two-stage countercurrent stripping Two-stage operation was applied to increase the stripping efficiency. Countercurrent stripping was investigated by exchanging positions of the aqueous and organic phase in Fig. S1. The results were shown in Table 5 . After two stages, it reached a stripping efficiency of 99.99% with boron below limit of detection in the organic phase. The FT-IR spectra of the organic phase after stripping (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary data) exhibited the same pattern and absorption peak with fresh extractants, proving full recovery of the extractants. In contrast with the three-stage stripping (Zhang et al., 2016) that recovered 97.8% boron of the loaded organic phase, this stripping process showed enhanced recovery performance of solvents. The final TOC value of the alkaline solutions was 5985.5 mg/L with 1.71% solvents loss. The overall solvents loss throughout the whole extraction process was estimated to be 2.88%, implying demand of fresh extractants in the continuous operation."
11,Conclusion,"Boron extraction from lithium-rich brine was systematically investigated using TMPD as the extractant, 2-ethylhexanol as the solvent and SK as the diluent. The extraction mechanism between boric acid and TMPD was analyzed by combining the logarithm-slope method with FT-IR spectra and further verified by DFT calculation. All evidence showed that a six-membered cycloborate ester was formed along the extraction. Optimal mixed alcohols' concentrations were obtained by comparing extraction efficiency, lithium and solvents loss and other parameters. The pH experiment indicated that the extraction did not demand any acid-base adjustment. Recovery of the loaded organic phase was also investigated by scrubbing and stripping to ensure recycle without emulsification. The overall extraction and stripping efficiency by two-stage countercurrent operation reached 99.95% and 99.99%, respectively. Two-stage scrubbing verified that 16.86% of lost lithium could be recovered. The results revealed a possibility of solvent extraction for deep boron removal from lithium-rich brine on industrial application."
