0,Introduction,"Achieving efficient catalytic reactions for selective synthesis of imines from readily available and inexpensive starting materials is vital to the development of sustainable chemical processes, especially since imines and their derivatives are important intermediates in the synthesis of various biologically active N-heterocyclic compounds, agricultural and pharmaceutical compounds, fine chemicals and materials [1,2]. At present, imines are predominantly produced from the condensation of primary amines and aldehydes or ketones in the presence of an acid catalyst through thermodynamic control (Scheme 1 a, Eq. I) [3,4]. Many catalytic and non-catalytic processes, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of secondary amines using O2 (Scheme 1a, Eq. II), self-condensation of amines (Scheme 1a, Eq. III) and condensation from alcohols and amines (Scheme 1a, Eq. IV), have also been widely explored to prepare imines in the more effective manner [4–11]. However, all these above-mentioned processes are inevitably associated with environmentally unfriendly reaction conditions and poor selectivity towards imines, while the relatively expensive amines are massively utilized as essential raw materials for the formation of imines. On the other hand, nitroarenes are inexpensive and abundant building blocks for the construction of various organic compounds [12,13], which can be easily reduced to amines under reductive environments [14–17]. In this regard, it would be more environmentally friendly and cost-effective to employ nitroarenes, instead of amines, as starting materials for the production of imines through a one-pot cascade reductive imination, in which water is the only by-product (Scheme 1b). Regardless, there are many significant challenges in this reductive reaction scheme due to its insufficient catalytic chemoselectivity. To be specific, as shown in Scheme 1b, two consecutive chemical transformations are usually expected for the successful production of imines from nitroarenes and aldehydes: (1) chemical reduction of nitroarenes to generate anilines and (2) subsequent condensation of amine and aldehyde. At the same time, the production of imines is often unavoidably associated with competitive hydrogenation of aldehydes as well as over-hydrogenation of targeted imines into N-alkylated amines under reductive environments, where all these would then lead to the poor chemoselectivity for reductive imination of nitroarenes. In order to avoid over-hydrogenation of imines, although carbon monoxide (CO) is hazardous and not suitable for the large-scale processing, CO or CH3OH, instead of H2, is still occasionally introduced to achieve the selective reduction of nitroarenes into imines with the minimization of hydrogenation of aldehydes and imines at an expense of the catalysts’ performance [18,19]. Reducing the catalytic activity of catalysts to suppress hydrogenation of imines is another commonly adopted approach to enhance selectivity of imines [20]. Therefore, the poor catalytic performance of associated catalysts is often resulted, in which the harsh reaction conditions (>100 °C and long reaction period) are required to drive the imination reaction. In addition, the selectivity of imines can also be improved by introducing the porthole effect associated with molecular sieves and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) when forming the frame within frame structure based catalysts [21]. Nevertheless, the catalysts’ activity as well as the scope of substrates with large steric hindrance would be greatly limited by the corresponding reactant transfer and accessibility through the micro-channel of molecular sieves/MOFs. To date, it is still a substantial challenge to develop an efficient catalyst that can realize the highly selective production of imines through a cascade hydrogen-reductive imination reaction between nitroarenes and aldehydes under mild conditions with a wide substrate scope. In principle, the ideal catalyst of the efficient imination reaction would perform a highly selective reduction of nitroarenes, but at the same time provide a relatively weak binding of aldehydes and target imines on the surface to prevent their hydrogenation. Here, we design and successfully develop a strategy to achieve this ideal goal by taking advantages of the competitive adsorption of nitroarenes, aldehydes, aromatic amines and imines on the surface of metal/support catalysts. Importantly, we emphasize and evaluate the importance of their compositions and surface physicochemical properties on the catalytic activity and selectivity. In specific, the bimetallic PtCo catalysts anchored on the hydroxyl-enriched cobalt borate nanosheets (PtCo/CoBOx) are synthesized as the showcase catalysts by a facile and scalable wet-chemistry approach. Based on the comparative experimental and density function theory (DFT) investigation, it is conclusive that the competitive molecular adsorption on the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts is the crucial factor contributing to the high catalytic selectivity towards imines in this work. These bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles with modulated electronic structures are found to evidently enhance the associated hydrogen dissociation and weaken their interaction with imines, which lead to both the enhanced activity and improved selectivity against over-hydrogenation of target imines. The competitive adsorption of aromatic amines (reduced from nitroarenes) over imines on PtCo can be employed to suppress the over-hydrogenation of imines. The competitive adsorption of nitroarenes over aldehyde on PtCo, preferential adsorption of both benzaldehyde and nitroarenes as well as hydroxyl-abundant CoBOx nanosheet surface can further induce the condensation away from PtCo, restraining the hydrogenation of both imines and aldehydes. Also, the kinetically and competitively precedent reduction of nitroarenes into aromatic amine over aldehydes are observed to immediately trigger the condensation by consuming aldehydes, which avoid the hydrogenation of aldehydes. All these findings can clearly indicate the two side reactions in Scheme 1b being effectively minimized, leading to the selective and efficient production of imines under mild conditions."

2,Synthesis of CoBOx nanosheets,"2.1 Synthesis of CoBOx nanosheets Briefly, 3 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 7.5 mmol of NaBH4 were dissolved in 285 mL and 15 mL of water, respectively. Then, the aqueous NaBH4 solution was added into the aqueous Co(NO3)2 solution under the stirring at room temperature for 1 h. After 2 h of aging, the CoBOx nanosheets were thoroughly washed by distilled water for three times and collected by centrifugation."
3,Synthesis of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts Firstly, 200 mg of CoBOx nanosheets were dispersed in 50 mL of water through ultrasonication. After adding 5 mL of 1.5 mM Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, the solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the reaction temperature was increased to 75 °C after adding 15 mL of aqueous urea solution (10 mg/mL). After another 2 h, the solution was cooled down to room temperature. Next, 10 mL of the ice-cold fresh aqueous NaBH4 solution (1 mg/mL) was added. Finally, the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts were thoroughly washed by distilled water for three times and collected by centrifugation. The Pt/C and PtCo/C catalysts with 1 wt% of metal loading were synthesized with the same process of PtCo/CoBOx. The weight ratio of Pt and Co in PtCo/C catalysts was controlled to 3:1 for the PtCo/C catalysts."
4,Synthesis of Pt/CoBOx catalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of Pt/CoBOx catalysts The Pt/CoBOx catalysts with 1 wt% of Pt loading were also prepared by the modified deposition-precipitation method. Briefly, 200 mg of CoBOx was suspended in 50 mL of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution at room temperature. Then, 5 mL of aqueous NaOH solution (2 mg/mL) was added into the above CoBOx suspension under vigorous stirring. After 5 min reaction, the ice-cold aqueous NaBH4 solution (1 mg/mL) was added for another 1 h reaction. Finally, the Pt/CoBOx catalysts were washed by distilled water for four times, collected by centrifugation and dried overnight at 60 °C."
5,Characterizations,2.4 Characterizations TEM studies were conducted with a Hitachi HT-7700 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. XPS spectra was acquired using a Thermo Electron model K-Alpha with Al Kα as the excitation source. FTIR analysis was performed by using a Bruker Vertex 80 with KBr pellet. EELS and high-resolution TEM was conducted on a Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 (FEI) aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope.
6,Catalytic reactions,"2.5 Catalytic reactions The one-pot cascade reductive imination of nitroarenes with aldehydes was carried out in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with the pressure control system. For a typical catalytic reaction, 1 mmol of benzaldehyde, 1.2 mmol of nitrobenzene and 5 mg of catalysts were mixed in 2 mL of isopropanol. The reactions were performed in the autoclave charged with 1 MPa H2 at 60 °C. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and GC with mxylene as internal standard."
7,DFT calculations,"2.6 DFT calculations Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the plane wave basis Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the electron exchange-correlation potential treated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The energy cutoff was 400 eV. For the geometry relaxation, a criterion of 0.02 eV Å−1 on forces was used. The convergence criterion for the energy was 10-5 eV. Brillouin zone integration was sampled with the 16 × 16 × 16 and 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh k-points for bulk and surface calculations, and 1 × 1 × 1 Gamma point for molecular calculation. The lattice parameters were fitted with the third-order Birch Murnaghan isothermal equation. The optimized lattice parameters of FCC Co and Pt were 2.440 Å and 2.812 Å, respectively, similar to the experimental values (2.506 Å for Co and 2.714 Å for Pt) in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). The lattice structure of CoPt3 alloy was generated by replace one of four Pt atom by a Co atom in the FCC Pt unit cell. Then the CoPt3 alloy was relaxed. The resulted Pt-Pt distance was 2.711 Å and Pt-Co distance was 2.733 Å. The slab models contained 3-layer (6 × 6) supercell, with the top layer being relaxed and the other layers being fixed. All the slabs were separated by a 20 Å vacuum layer. The initial adsorption configurations of N-benzylideneaniline were assumed in a flat adsorption mode with the aromatic ring on the bridge site of metal, which was the most stable adsorption configuration for benzene as previous report. The adsorption energy was defined as follow: E ad = E totel - E metal - E molecular where E ad is the adsorption energy; E totel is the total energy of the molecule on the surface of metal; E metal is the energy of metal slab; E molecular is the energy of molecule."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterizations of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles on CoBOx nanosheets,"3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles on CoBOx nanosheets The two-dimensional CoBOx nanosheets with smooth surface were synthesized by previous report [22], as shown in the TEM image (Fig. 1 a). Then, the bimetallic PtCo/CoBOx catalysts were successfully synthesized through the facile chemical co-precipitation model with urea as precipitator, along with the cation exchange between Co2+ and NH4 + ions. As shown in Fig. 1b, the obvious metal nanoparticles with average diameter of 6.4 ± 1.6 nm (Fig. 1c) could be observed from the dark field transmission electron microscope (TEM) image. To further confirm their bimetallic structure, the obtained catalysts were further characterized by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 1d). The measured 0.21 nm lattice spacing was obvious smaller than the 0.223 nm of the Pt(1 1 1) crystalline plane, but larger than 0.205 nm of the Co(1 1 1) plane, indicating the successful formation of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles. To further prove the bimetallic structure of PtCo nanoparticles, spatial distribution of elements in the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts was visualized by the EELS mapping with STEM analysis (Fig. 1e). Obviously, the Pt element and Co element were uniformly distribution on the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the molar ratio of Pt:Co could be also averaged as 1:1, which was equal to the mass ratio of 1:3, as shown in Figure S1. The actual Pt loading on the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts was 0.79 wt% by the ICP-OES analysis. Then, the content of Co in the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles could be also calculated as 0.26 wt%. Thus, the total metal loading was 1.05 wt% on the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts."
10,Catalytic hydrogen reductive imination of nitrobenzene with benzaldehyde,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogen reductive imination of nitrobenzene with benzaldehyde Furthermore, the catalytic performance of obtained PtCo/CoBOx catalysts was examined through the cascade hydrogen reductive imination of nitrobenzene with benzaldehyde. The reaction was optimized and conducted under the mild conditions of T = 60 °C and PH2 = 1.0 MPa. Notably, Pt/C was employed as a reference catalyst here, where Pt nanoparticles with a size of 5.3 ± 0.9 nm were anchored on the commercial activated carbon through a deposition–precipitation method (Figure S2). The Pt loading was controlled to 1 wt% that is similar to the total PtCo loading in the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts. When evaluating its catalytic performance, the Pt/C catalysts yielded a decent conversion of benzaldehyde (98.7%) after 3 h (Fig. 2 a) with a low selectivity (3.9%) of target product of N-benzylideneaniline (Fig. 2b) under the optimized conditions. Another 0.5 h of the catalytic reaction would lead to the completed conversion of N-benzylideneaniline into N-phenylbenzylamine. The final yields of benzyl alcohol, N-benzylideneaniline and N-phenylbenzylamine were determined to be 36%, 0.9% and 63.1%, respectively (Fig. 2c). As expected, there was a serious over-hydrogenation of imines and hydrogenation of benzaldehyde with the reaction carried out by Pt/C catalysts, in which all these phenomena agree well with the previous reports [21]. In contrast, the conversion of benzaldehyde catalyzed by the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts could reach 98.8% within 2 h, indicating their higher catalytic activity (Fig. 2a). More importantly, the selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline could maintain close to 100% during the entire catalytic process and reach 98.3% at the benzaldehyde conversion of 98.8% (Fig. 2b). The yields of benzyl alcohol, N-benzylideneaniline and N-phenylbenzylamine were found to be 0%, 97.8% and 1.7% at the end of the hydrogenation, respectively (Fig. 2c). Afterwards, even if the hydrogenation was performed for another 1 h at 60 °C, the selectivity of N-phenylbenzylamine was slightly decreased from 98.3% to 97.5%, suggesting the extremely slow over-hydrogenation of N-benzylideneaniline into N-phenylbenzylamine by the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts here. Also, the high 97.3% selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline at 95.3% conversion of benzaldehyde was also yielded by using PtCo/CoBOx as catalysts even at room temperature (25 °C, Figure S3), further indicating the suppressed side-reactions and subsequent high catalytic selectivity for synthesis of imines through the cascade hydrogen reductive imination of nitroarenes with aldehydes. Therefore, it is evident that the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts could yield both the significantly enhanced catalytic activity and chemoselectivity towards imines."
11,Catalytic stability,"3.3 Catalytic stability Apart from the activity, the catalytic stability of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts is also an important factor for their catalytic performance evaluation. In explicit, after the catalytic reactions, the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts can be easily separated from the reaction solution through centrifugation. Both the catalytic activity and selectivity of the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts were well preserved at least for five cycles. The conversions of benzaldehyde for 1 h could still be maintained at a range of between 64.1% and 68.5% (Fig. 2d). Impressively, the high selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline was maintained (>97.5%) for the reductive imination during five cycles, while the morphology of spent PtCo/CoBOx catalysts did not have any noticeable change as compared to the ones of as-synthesized catalysts (Figure S4). Therefore, the preserved catalytic activity and selectivity as well as the unaltered morphological features of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts can clearly demonstrate their excellent catalytic and structural stability."
12,Catalytic mechanism,"3.4 Catalytic mechanism Understanding the excellent catalytic performance of these bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles anchored on CoBOx for this selective hydrogen-reductive imination is important for the design and synthesis of novel heterogeneous catalysts with high selectivity. For the cascade reductive imination of nitroarenes with aldehydes, four chemical transformations should be considered (Scheme 1b): (1) hydrogenation of nitroarenes into aromatic amines; (2) condensation between aromatic amines and aldehydes for the formation of imines; (3) over-hydrogenation of imines and (4) hydrogenation of aldehydes into alcohols. In general, the required metal catalysts provide active sites for hydrogen activation, in which they do not only reduce nitroarenes for subsequent condensation but also hydrogenate aldehydes and imines as side reactions, leading to the low selectivity towards imines. This poor catalytic phenomenon had already been well illustrated by the Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 2a and b). On the contrary, the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts decorated with the larger size of bimetallic nanoparticles (as compared with the Pt nanoparticles) could deliver the dramatically enhanced catalytic performance towards imines, where the over-hydrogenation of N-benzylideneaniline and hydrogenation of benzaldehyde were significantly suppressed even under an extended hydrogenation period. All these results would strongly suggest the alternative catalytic pathways for PtCo/CoBOx catalysts. By examining the literatures, the adsorption behaviors of reactants, intermediates and products on the catalyst surface can significantly modulate both activity and selectivity of a catalyst [23–25]. In this case, adsorption behaviors of both reactants and product were then carefully explored to assess catalytic pathways of the above-mentioned selective reaction catalyzed by PtCo/CoBOx. To begin with, DFT calculations were performed to compute the adsorption energy of N-benzylideneaniline on the surfaces of Pt(1 1 1), Co(1 1 1) and bimetallic PtCo (1 1 1) in order to evaluate the interaction between bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles and imines. The product of N-benzylideneaniline can be adsorbed on the Pt(1 1 1) and Co(1 1 1) through two different flat configurations. One is a flat configuration a with both the N atom and aromatic ring attached with N atom on the metal surface (Figure S5a). Another one is a flat configuration b with both the N atom and aromatic ring attached with C atom on the metal surface (Figure S5b). For both configurations, part of the sp2 character of N atom would be transformed into the sp3 nature. Since the π orbital in the CN bond and aromatic ring cannot be maintained in same flat plane, one aromatic ring of N-benzylideneaniline is adsorbed on the metal surface while another ring is then flipped up. In particular, for the Pt(1 1 1) surface, the N-benzylideneaniline exhibited the stable flat configuration b with an adsorption energy of −2.13 eV as compared with the one of flat configuration a (−2.05 eV), as shown in Fig. 3 a. Similarly, the flat configuration b is slightly more stable configured on the surface of Co(1 1 1) with an adsorption energy of −2.02 eV as compared with that of flat configuration a with an adsorption energy of −1.98 eV (Fig. 3a). Notably, these two adsorption configurations of N-benzylideneaniline on the bimetallic PtCo(1 1 1) showed much smaller adsorption energies of −1.67 eV with configuration b and −1.59 eV with configuration a as compared with those on Pt(1 1 1) and Co(1 1 1). Therefore, in contrast to the respective pure Pt or Co, the bimetallic PtCo can greatly weaken the adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline to suppress the over-hydrogenation of imines. The reduced interaction between N-benzylideneaniline and PtCo can be further evidenced from the XPS analysis by comparing the electronic structures of employed metal catalysts before and after molecular adsorption. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts exhibited the similar binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 at 71.22 eV with the similar surface Pt0 fractions (∼82.4%) before and after adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline molecules. When compared with the reference catalyst of Pt/C, the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 was obviously shifted from 71.65 eV to 71.34 eV after adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline (Fig. 3b), which indicated the strong interaction between imines and Pt nanoparticles through the electron transfer from imine molecules to Pt nanoparticles, leading to the serious over-hydrogenation of imines under the operating conditions [26,27]. Evidently, both theoretical calculations and XPS results suggest that the enhanced catalytic chemoselectivity of PtCo/CoBOx could be ascribed to the weakened adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline on bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles. This minimized adsorption can efficiently suppress the over-hydrogenation of produced imines in the present catalytic system. In order to further experimentally evaluate and highlight the importance of bimetallic PtCo catalysts, Pt nanoparticles supported on the surface of CoBOx nanosheets (Pt/CoBOx, 1.0 wt% Pt loading, Figure S6) were synthesized through a facile deposition-precipitation process with NaOH, which could effectively avoid the cation exchange between NH4 + and Co2+. The size of Pt nanoparticles was controlled to be 7.4 ± 1.9 nm, being similar to that of the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles anchored on the CoBOx nanosheets. The corresponding lattice fringe spacing was measured to be 0.222 nm that was consistent with the one of Pt(1 1 1) crystal plane (Figure S6b). As revealed in Fig. 2a, the conversion of benzaldehyde was only 94.0% for the Pt/CoBOx catalysts after 3 h. When the catalyst was changed to PtCo/CoBOx, the conversion was enhanced to 98.8% after only 2 h of reaction even with a lower Pt loading under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 2a). All these results indicate the excellent capability of alloyed PtCo nanoparticles for hydrogen activation and subsequent hydrogenation of nitroarenes [28,29]. It should also be noted that for the Pt/CoBOx catalysts, the selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline at the benzaldehyde conversion (94.0%; 3 h reaction) was only 78.9%, which is much lower than that (98.3%) for the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts at the benzaldehyde conversion (98.8%; 2 h reaction). In addition, the selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline was further decreased from 78.9% to 67.8% as catalyzed by the Pt/CoBOx catalysts for another 1 h afterward (Fig. 2b). This substantially degraded selectivity of imines (11.1%) was much larger than the value of only 0.8% for the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts under the same reaction conditions. Thus, the enhanced catalytic chemoselectivity of PtCo/CoBOx can be attributed to the weakened adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline on bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles as compared with Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3a). Such the weakened adsorption of N-benzylideneaniline on PtCo might be attributed to the modulated electronic structure of alloyed nanoparticles compared to Pt alone, as shown in the XPS Pt 4f profiles of Pt/CoBOx and PtCo/CoBOx (Figure S7). In this case, the over-hydrogenation of produced imines in the present catalytic system can be effectively minimized on the bimetallic nanoparticles, demonstrating the importance of metal compositions on controlling the molecular adsorption behavior of the catalysts. Moreover, the competitive adsorption of aromatic amines on bimetallic PtCo, reduced from nitroarenes, also played a key role on the improved selectivity towards imines. Form the DFT calculation results, the adsorption energy of aniline on the surface of bimetallic PtCo(1 1 1) (Figure S8) was found to be −1.94 eV, which is more negative than that of N-benzylideneaniline on PtCo(1 1 1) (−1.67 eV, Fig. 3a). This way, the excessive aniline as well contributed to suppress the over-hydrogenation of imines through the competitive adsorption of aniline on PtCo over N-benzylideneaniline. Decreasing the initial molar ratios of nitrobenzene to benzaldehyde from 1.2 to 1.0 and then to 0.9 in the reaction system, the selectivities of N-benzylideneaniline also decreased from 98.3% to 93.5% and then to 91.7%, respectively, along with increased yields of benzyl alcohol and N-phenylbenzylamine under the same reaction conditions (Figure S9). All these results put forward the importance of excess nitrobenzene on the improved selectivity of imines. Next, the adsorption of benzaldehyde and nitroarenes on the catalysts were carefully studied. By comparing the catalytic performance of between Pt/C and Pt/CoBOx catalysts, their catalytic activity was quite similar. However, the chemoselectivity of Pt/CoBOx towards imines was much higher than that of Pt/C, suggesting that the CoBOx supports also played important roles in the catalysis. Thus, the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles supported on activated carbon (PtCo/C, Figure S10) were also synthesized through the deposition-precipitation method to further examine the effect of CoBOx supports here. The total metal loading of the nanoparticles was controlled to 1 wt%. While the Pt/Co mass ratios of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles in both PtCo/C and PtCo/CoBOx catalysts were controlled to the same values. As depicted in the TEM image, the Pt/Co nanoparticles exhibited a size distribution of 5.6 ± 1.2 nm on the surface of the activated carbon (Figure S10a). The lattice fringe spacing was measured as 0.215 nm, where this value was lied between the spacing of Pt(1 1 1) plane (0.223 nm) and Co(1 1 1) plane (0.205 nm) (Figure S10b), indicating the successful formation of bimetallic PtCo on the surface of activated carbon. The EDS elemental mapping of the metal particles could further confirm the alloyed composition of PtCo on the surface of activated carbon (Figure S10c). For catalytic reactions, both PtCo/C and PtCo/CoBOx catalysts delivered the similar catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. For instance, the conversion of benzaldehyde was 96.0% after 1.5 h of reaction catalyzed by the PtCo/C catalysts (Fig. 2a). The selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline was 58.4% for the PtCo/C catalysts that was significantly higher than that (3.9%) of using Pt/C for 3 h of reaction (Fig. 2b), which confirms again that the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles could improve the catalytic selectivity towards imines. However, the chemoselectivity of PtCo/C was still much lower than that of PtCo/CoBOx (98.3%), highlighting the critical roles of supports for the improved selectivity towards imines. Typically, surface polarities of the supports have been widely considered as an important factor in modulating the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalysts [30–34]. In this study, both control experiments and above discussions strongly indicated that the competitive adsorption behaviors of the reactants/products might happen on various catalysts. Hence, the surface properties of CoBOx nanosheets and activated carbon as well as their interaction with reactants and target product of N-benzylideneaniline were thoroughly investigated. As compared with the activated carbon, large amounts of surface hydroxyl groups were present on the surface of CoBOx supports as indicated by the O 1s peak from the XPS analysis (Figure S11). This way, the CoBOx supports would exhibit the typically polarized surface feature, benefiting the adsorption of benzaldehyde or nitrobenzene via the hydrogen bond formation between the polar aldehyde or nitro groups of reactants and the hydroxyl groups of supports. Fourier-transformed Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was also employed to study the interaction among reactants, products and supports. As shown in Fig. 3d, there were three main bands located at 1420 cm−1, 1535 cm−1 and 1568 cm−1 observed for the CoBOx nanosheet supports after adsorption of benzaldehyde, which could be attributed to the benzene skeleton vibration. At the same time, the characteristic peak of –CHO groups was found to shift to 1610 cm−1 in spectrum, suggesting the strong interaction between –CHO groups and CoBOx supports through hydrogen bond formation (Fig. 3d). The similar strong adsorption could also be observed between nitrobenzene and CoBOx nanosheets (Fig. 3d). The band located at 1425 cm−1 could be attributed to the characteristic absorption peak of benzene ring, while the bands positioned at 1552 cm−1 and 1354 cm−1 indicated the presence of nitro groups. However, when N-benzylideneaniline was adsorbed onto CoBOx, there was not any noticeable change on the FTIR spectrum, indicating the relatively weak interaction between imines and CoBOx (Fig. 3d). Also, there was not any dominant characteristic peak of reactants and products observed for the activated carbon after adsorption of benzaldehyde, nitrobenzene and N-benzylideneaniline, which suggest the very weak interaction among those chemicals and activated carbon (Fig. 3e). Therefore, the CoBOx nanosheets with large amounts of surface hydroxyl groups would benefit the adsorption of benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene through the establishment of interfacial hydrogen bonding. To further confirm the functions of the surface hydroxyl group, the carbon supports were treated by 68 wt% HNO3 to introduce the –OH on carbon surface [35]. Then, the alloyed PtCo nanoparticles supported on the treated carbon (PtCo/C-T) were prepared by the same process as that of PtCo/C and were then used for the catalytic cascade hydrogen reductive imination of nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde. As shown in Figure S12, both of catalytic activity and selectivity for the PtCo/C-T catalysts were improved compared with the catalytic performance of PtCo/C. In particular, the selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline was 86.8% at the conversion of 95.2% (Figure S12). Even at a reactant conversion of 97.3%, the selectivity was still maintained at 75.4% (Figure S12), which was much higher than the selectivity of 50.8% catalyzed by the PtCo/C catalysts at the similar conversion (Fig. 2d). Thus, these results further demonstrate the important roles of the surface hydroxyl groups of supports for the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. To shed light on the interaction between bimetallic PtCo catalysts and reactants, their interactions were as well explored by the XPS analyses on the chemical states of Pt for the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts before and after chemical adsorption. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts exhibited the similar binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 before (71.22 eV) and after (71.24 eV) adsorption of benzaldehyde molecules. This small energy difference revealed the weak interaction between benzaldehyde molecules and bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles. Similar phenomenon on Pt nanoparticles could also be derived from the XPS analysis of Pt/C catalysts before and after adsorption of benzaldehyde (Fig. 3c). Thus, the interactions between benzaldehyde and metals (Pt and PtCo) are not that intense. In contrast, there were obvious shifts in the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 for both PtCo/CoBOx and Pt/C catalysts, which designated the much stronger interaction between nitrobenzene and PtCo or Pt nanoparticles, as compared with those of the benzaldehyde molecules (Fig. 3b and c). During catalytic reactions, this competitive adsorption of nitrobenzene over benzaldehyde on the metal surfaces would result in the preferential adsorption of nitrobenzene on both Pt and PtCo nanoparticles in our catalytic system. In the case of PtCo/CoBOx, the activated hydrogen species on metals would tend to reduce nitrobenzene into aromatic amine. Meanwhile, the activated hydrogen species could also spill over to the support and possibly lead to the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde simultaneously. If this happened, benzyl alcohol would be a major byproduct for such a cascade hydrogen reductive imination process. However, for PtCo/CoBOx, the yield of benzyl alcohol was found below the detection limitation of GC, indicating that the bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles and CoBOx supports would benefit the preferential hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in catalytic kinetics. As shown in Fig. 2c, the yields of benzyl alcohol for different catalysts were observed in the following order: Pt/C > PtCo/C > Pt/CoBOx ≫ PtCo/CoBOx, indicating their kinetically different hydrogenation rates of nitroarenes and benzaldehyde. This way, the hydrogenation kinetics of various catalysts for hydrogen-reduction of nitrobenzene and aldehyde were explored under the same reaction conditions. The ratios of their hydrogenation rates of nitroarenes and benzaldehyde (rnitroarene /rbenzaldehyde ) were used as a descriptor to characterize their kinetically competitive hydrogenation behavior (Figure S13 and S14). Among various catalysts, the descriptor value of PtCo/CoBOx was extracted as 6.8, which is the highest among Pt/CoBOx (5.2), PtCo/C (4.2) and Pt/C (1.6) (Fig. 3f). This tendency is completely inverse to their yields of benzyl alcohol for various catalysts (Fig. 2c). As a result, nitroarenes would be kinetically and preferentially reduced by PtCo/CoBOx in the presence of benzaldehyde under the same reaction conditions. Based on the control experiments, DFT calculations and kinetic studies, a catalytic pathway for the highly selective reduction of imines catalyzed by PtCo/ CoBOx is proposed in Scheme 2 . Initially, the CoBOx supports with abundant surface hydroxyl groups provide large amounts of surface sites for strong adsorption of aldehyde and nitrobenzene through hydrogen bond formation. Aldehyde displays a low interaction with metal catalysts, while nitrobenzene is easily adsorbed on the surface of PtCo nanoparticles. Hydrogen molecules can then be efficiently dissociated on the surface of PtCo to generate the activated hydrogen species (I). Next, the activated hydrogen species can directly reduce the adsorbed nitrobenzene on the surface of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles (II). The activated hydrogen can also spill over the CoBOx supports and hydrogenate the adsorbed reactants (II). In catalytic kinetics, nitrobenzene is preferentially reduced into aromatic amine as compared with that of aldehyde. In this case, the produced amine will condensate with aldehyde immediately as well as consume aldehyde. Thus, the hydrogenation of aldehyde can be avoided due to the excess nitrobenzene in the catalytic system. Moreover, the condensation between aniline and aldehyde can immediately occur away from metals (III), decreasing the possibility for subsequent over-hydrogenation of imine. The last step is then the desorption of generated imines from the catalyst surface (IV). Due to the weak interaction with CoBOx as well as PtCo/CoBOx, the generated imines can be easily desorbed from the surface of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts, suppressing the over-hydrogenation of imines. In addition, the competitive adsorption of aromatic imines (reduced from nitrobenzene) over imines further prevents the adsorption of imine on the bimetallic PtCo surface, which restrains the over-hydrogenation of N-benzylideneaniline. This way, the risk of over-hydrogenation of imines and hydrogenation of benzaldehyde can be effectively minimized, resulting in the greatly enhanced yield and chemoselectivity of imines."
13,Scope,"3.5 Scope The reaction protocol could also be further extended to various substituted nitroarenes and aldehyde compounds, which includes those with various reducible groups in order to verify the scope, activity and chemoselectivity of cascade reductive imination reactions catalyzed by the PtCo/CoBOx catalysts (Table 1 ). In explicit, when the nitroarenes chemicals were substituted by –Cl and –I groups, the conversions of 93.6% and 89.6% were yielded after 1.5 h and 2 h of reaction, respectively (Entries 1 and 2). Also, the selectivities of the corresponding imine production would reach 98.3% and 99.5%, accordingly. For the substrates of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-nitrobenzonitrile and 4-nitrophenylacetylene, the conversions of 98.6%, 91.8% and 83.2% were obtained along with the selectivities of 93.5%, 99.1% and 88.6% towards imines, correspondingly (Entries 3–5). For 6 h of reaction, the selectivities of 4-, 3- and 2-benzylideneaminophenol were over 98.5% with the conversions of 83.2%, 78.6% and 75.6% for 4-, 3-, and 2-nitrophenol in that order (Entries 6–8). Meanwhile, the benzaldehyde compound could be replaced by other aldehyde compounds. For phenylacetaldehyde, the selectivity of imines was 99.1% when the conversion was 95.3% after 1.5 h of reaction (Entry 9). When trans-cinnamaldehyde was used, the CC bond was also preserved in the obtained imine products with a selectivity of 95.3%, accompanied with a conversion of 89.6% after 2 h of reaction (Entry 10). Importantly, the selectivities of target imine products could also reach 98.7% and 99.1%, when the conversions of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were 99.2% and 98.9% after 2.5 h of reaction, respectively (Entries 11–12)."
14,Conclusions,"Competitive adsorption of reactants, products and byproducts on the surface of PtCo/CoBOx catalysts enables the highly efficient and selective production of imines through a cascade reductive imination of nitroarenes with aldehydes. Complementary DFT calculations and experimental studies strongly suggest that the compositions and surface physicochemical properties of catalysts play important roles in controlling the interfacial molecular adsorption events. The weakened adsorption of imines, competitive adsorption of nitroarenes with aldehydes on hydroxyl-enriched CoBOx as well as kinetically preferential reduction of nitroarenes would effectively suppress the side-hydrogenation of aldehydes and over-hydrogenation of imines, which lead to the significantly improved selectivity towards imines. Starting from these thorough understandings, carefully modulating the adsorptive behaviors of chemicals on the catalyst surface might pave a new avenue to enable improved chemoselectivities for various catalytic reactions."
