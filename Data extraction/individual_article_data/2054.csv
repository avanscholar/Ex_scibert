0,Introduction,"The product of hydrogen combustion is water, which is the cleanest energy in the world. Therefore, the production, storage, transportation and application technology of hydrogen have become the focus of attention in the 21st century. Obviously, the storage and transportation of hydrogen in pipelines are an important part of hydrogen utilization. Experimental studies have confirmed that environmental hydrogen can be decomposed into hydrogen atoms through chemical adsorption and then enter the steel pipeline [1], and entry of hydrogen will significantly reduce the plasticity and fracture toughness of the pipeline steel and increasing the risk of hydrogen-induced failure of the pipeline [2]. In the whole pipeline, the welded joint area is the most vulnerable to failure because of the significant non-uniform microstructure and welding residual stress. The earlier research results of the author [3] indicate that hydrogen diffusion is nonuniform at the welding joint, local hydrogen enrichment phenomenon will occur, and the increase in hydrogen concentration is equivalent to the rise in hydrogen charging pressure. For the same kind of material, the material is more prone to hydrogen embrittlement when the hydrogen pressure is higher [4,5]. Therefore, the uneven diffusion of hydrogen in the welded joint area increases the possibility of crack initiation and propagation. Of course, hydrogen cracking is the result of hydrogen concentration, microstructure and mechanical factors. The material's hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity depends on the phase structure of the material and the hydrogen diffusion parameters of the corresponding structure [1]. Studying the microstructure of different subzones and the corresponding hydrogen diffusion parameters is important to explain the failure mechanism of high strength steel welded joints. The chemical composition of steel determines the type of steel, while the preparation technology and process parameters ultimately determine the microstructure and properties of steel. X80 steel, which is widely used in the construction of long-distance pipelines, has low carbon, high manganese and micro niobium. In addition, alloying elements such as Ti, Cu and Mo are added. The microstructure of X80 steel produced by rolling and cooling control is mainly acicular ferrite (AF) or granular bainite (GB). The dislocation density is relatively high, and dispersed ultrafine precipitation phases are present in the matrix [6]. X80 steel has high strength and toughness because of this microstructure. The pipe making and connection of X80 steel are completed by fusion welding, and the microstructure and properties of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) after welding are greatly changed compared with the base metal. Of course, the microstructure and properties of the joints are different with different welding methods and process parameters. Previously, the author has studied the microstructure and hydrogen permeation behavior of spiral welded pipe [7], but relevant research on girth welded joints is still lacking. The laying of long-distance pipelines is generally completed by multi-layer and multi-pass welding. A girth weld seam consists of root, hot, filling and cover passes. The microstructure of HAZ of X80 steel is different under different thermal cycles. In the process of multi-layer and multi-pass welding, the HAZ of adjacent welding passes overlaps with each other, forming the HAZ that has experienced two or more thermal cycles, with particularly complex microstructure characteristics. Deng [8] compared the microstructure and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of X80 steel after the coarse-grain HAZ (CGHAZ) experienced subsequent thermal actions of 800, 950 and 1350 °C, and the author found that chain M-A islands appeared along the grain boundary in the intercritical reheated CGHAZ, which experienced two thermal actions of 1350 and 800 °C, successively, and the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility significantly increased. The variation in hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility is determined by the microstructure and the hydrogen permeation parameters. The study of hydrogen permeation parameters and the relationship with the microstructure characteristics is important to explain the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility variation in different subzones of multilayer welded joints. At present, the electrochemical charging and electrochemical detection method is widely used to study the hydrogen permeation behavior of materials. The author proposed a hydrogen gas charging and electrochemical detection method, which greatly improves the accuracy of the test results because it eliminates the influence of the corrosion or deposited film on the hydrogen-charging side [9]. Xue and Cheng [10] studied the microstructure and electrochemical hydrogen permeation behavior of X80 pipeline steel, weld metal, and HAZ. The results showed that the hydrogen diffusion channel exists along the ferrite grain boundary, and the precipitation of Fe3C blocks the hydrogen diffusion. The base metal has the largest hydrogen diffusion coefficient (D), while the HAZ has the smallest D. Wang et al. [11] studied the hydrogen permeation behavior of submerged arc welded joint of a rolling and cooling control steel. They pointed out that grain boundaries are the major hydrogen diffusion channels whether in the base metal or HAZ, and ferrite/carbide interfaces are the hydrogen traps. The base material with a large number of equiaxial crystals has a grain boundary with a large volume fraction and many hydrogen diffusion channels. As a result, the D value of the base metal is the largest, while the apparent diffusion coefficient of the HAZ with precipitation of bainite and cementite (Fe3C) is the lowest. However, when studying hydrogen permeation of welded joint, most scholars tend to consider the HAZ as a whole, and research on hydrogen permeation behavior of different subzones is lacking. Han et al. [12] conducted hydrogen permeation tests on the coarse- and fine-grain zones of X80 steel welded joints but ignored the effect of multiple thermal cycles. In this study, hydrogen permeation parameters in different subzone of X80 steel girth welded joint were obtained by high-pressure hydrogen permeation experiments. On this basis, the influence of primary and secondary thermal cycles on hydrogen permeation parameters was analyzed. The key affecting microstructural characteristics of hydrogen permeation parameters were then determined. Relevant research can provide basic data for the study of non-uniform hydrogen diffusion in welded joints and also be helpful for the development of hydrogen embrittlement preventive measures. Notably, the hydrogen in the welded joint can be the “external hydrogen” that has physically and chemically adsorbed onto the steel and diffused to the joint area, or it can be the “internal hydrogen” that remains in the weld during the welding process. No matter whether the source of hydrogen is external, internal, or a combination of both, the hydrogen permeation parameters in subzones with different microstructures should be determined to explain the failure mechanism of hydrogen diffusion, aggregation, crack initiation and propagation until fracture in welded joints."
1,Heat treatment cycles,"Multi-layer and multi-pass welding process is adopted for X80 steel pipeline welding, and different heat-affected subzones undergo different peak welding temperature and cooling times, which leads to significant differences in microstructure. Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional morphology of six-layers and eight-pass welded joints and the HAZs together with their thermal cycle curves. The peak heating temperature (T p) in the CGHAZ is lower than the peritectic temperature of steel but sufficiently high to cause the grain growth. The T p in the fine-grain HAZ (FGHAZ) is higher than AC3, which corresponds to the temperature of complete austenitization, but its is insufficient to cause grain growth. The T p in the intercritical HAZ (ICHAZ) is between AC3 and AC1, where AC1 corresponds to the temperature at which austenitization begins. The HAZ produced by single-pass welding can be divided into CGHAZ, FGHAZ and ICHAZ, while the subsequent pass will have further thermal effect on the previous HAZ in multi-pass welding. For example, the red area (zone 3) shown in Fig. 1 undergoes CGHAZ peak temperature heat treatment and then ICHAZ peak temperature heat treatment. Measurements show that the peak temperature of the third thermal cycle cannot reach the phase transition temperature. Thus, the microstructure of the steel will be affected insignificantly. Therefore, this study ignores the influence of three or more thermal cycles and only studies the subzones formed under the influence of single and double thermal cycles. Welding thermal simulation is a special heat treatment to simulate the welding thermal process of the base material for ensuring that the microstructure and properties of the material after heat treatment are close to the studied HAZs as a whole. According to the thermal cycle curves measured under the actual welding conditions and numerical simulation results of welding process, the process parameters in thermal simulation test were formulated, as listed in Tables 1 and 2. The peak temperature(s) experienced in welding thermal simulation will be used to name these HAZs given that the thermal cycles involved in this study are complex."
2,Experimental,
3,Test specimens,"3.1 Test specimens The studied material was a high-strength steel grade API X80 used for pipeline manufacturing [1]. The specimens of 160 mm × 32 mm × 2.2 mm were directly cut from the steel. Welding thermal simulation experiments were conducted with a Gleeble 1500 thermal simulator to produce large-size HAZ specimens by using the parameters shown in Tables 1 and 2. The heat-treated specimens were cut to round disks with a thickness of 2.2 mm and a diameter of 24 mm from the approximate isothermal region by using a line cutting machine. Then, they were polished step by step to 600 grits with water and sandpaper. Finally, they were thinned to 1.9 mm. The thickness of all heat-treated specimens was kept the same. The polished specimen was rinsed with alcohol, dried with N2, and immediately prepared for the hydrogen permeation test."
4,Hydrogen permeation test,"3.2 Hydrogen permeation test The hydrogen permeation measurements were performed in a special gas charging and electrochemical detection permeation device developed by the author during a previous study [1]. During the experiment, the specimen was clamped between a hydrogen gas charging autoclave and electrochemical detection cell, and both sides of the specimen were pre-plated with nickel. The detection side was filled with 0.1 M NaOH solution and the specimen was polarized at a potential of + 300 mV (vs. Hg/HgO) to passivate the nickel plating. Simultaneously, the autoclave was flushed three times with 0.5 MPa nitrogen to remove the air inside. When the passivation current of nickel plating was less than 0.1 μA·cm−2, the autoclave was flushed three times with 0.5 MPa hydrogen to remove the nitrogen inside. Then, it was filled with 1.2 MPa H2, and the temperature was held at 40 ± 0.5 °C. Gas chemisorption in the charging side of the specimen surface converted the hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms, which were absorbed by dissolving and diffusion through the specimen to be oxidized and detected as an oxidation current at the detection side. The change in oxidation current with time was recorded, and the hydrogen permeation curve was obtained. The test was repeated twice."
5,Microstructure analysis,"3.3 Microstructure analysis The change in microstructure is the fundamental reason for the influence of welding thermal cycle on hydrogen permeation parameters of X80 steel. The microstructural factors that determine hydrogen permeation parameters were investigated. The properly sized specimens were mechanically polished to mirror finish, cleaned, degreased, and dried for further etching. The specimens etched with 4 vol% Nital solution were used for optical microscopy analysis, and those etched with Lepera were used for color metallography analysis. Lepera is an etchant consisting of a 1% aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) and 4% picric acid (C6H2(NO2)3OH) in ethyl alcohol. A Leica DM 2500 microscope was used to observe the characteristics of the phase composition in microstructure. The distribution of grain boundary orientation difference and effective grain size was obtained by electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) technique. The specimens with appropriate size were ground to 2000 mesh by water sandpaper, and then, they were electropolished to obtain the mirror surface and remove the microstrain on the surface. The electrolytic polishing fluid is composed of anhydrous ethanol and perchloric acid with the ratio of 9:1. After cleaning, degreasing and drying, EBSD analysis was performed with a JSM-7200F scanning electron microscope system. The statistical results of dislocation density in the specimen were obtained by XRD analysis. The specimens were ground to 600 meshes step by step, and after cleaning, degreasing and drying, they were analyzed with a diffraction angle range of 20–100° by a X′PERT PRO X-ray diffraction (XRD). The wavelength of X-rays is 1.54056 Å."
6,Results,
7,Changes in phase composition,"4.1 Changes in phase composition After the base metal underwent single welding thermal cycle, the HAZ was divided into three typical subzones, namely, ICHAZ, FGHAZ, and CGHAZ, corresponding to the heat-treated specimens with peak temperatures of 800, 950 and 1350 °C, respectively. The microstructure of the three subzones and the original base metal is shown in Fig. 2. The base metal is mainly composed of fine AF and polygonal ferrite (PF) in which some fine GB is embedded [Fig. 2(a)]. The ICHAZ (800 °C) is composed of fine GB, which is mixed with the grown ferrite and distributes in disorder, and the rolling texture of the base metal is retained [Fig. 2(b)]. The microstructure of FGHAZ is dominated by PF and GB [Fig. 2(c)]. In CGHAZ with a peak temperature of 1350 °C, large lath bainite (LB) is formed, and grain boundaries become straight [Fig. 2(d)]. After the specimen was etched with Lepera solution, the M-A constituent can be readily displayed. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which the granular or chain-shaped bright yellow phase is the M-A constituent. Image-J image processing software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) was used to binarize each photo for counting the content of M-A constituent in different specimens. Fig. 4 shows the binarization results of Fig. 3(a). The percentage of the white region in the whole image area is the content of M-A constituent, and the statistical results are listed in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the specimen with the peak temperature of 800 °C has the most M-A constituent, followed by the specimen with the peak temperature of 950 °C, and the base material and the specimen with the peak temperature of 1350 °C have fewer M-A constituent. The microstructure will change if the 800 °C heat-treated specimen is then subjected to a second heat treatment. When the second peak temperature T p2 is 800 °C, the specimen undergoes two incomplete austenitizing cycles, which results in an increase in GB and a decrease in ferrite content [ Fig. 5(a)], and the microstructure remains uneven. When T p2 is 950 °C, the microstructure is completely austenitized in heating. After cooling, the microstructure is dominated by PF and GB, and the grain size becomes uniform [Fig. 5(c)]. When T p2 is 1350 °C, the microstructure is completely transformed into austenite in heating, and the grains grow significantly. After cooling, the microstructure is mainly composed of LB and GB, and the grains are relatively large [Fig. 5(e)]. M-A constituents are observed in the three groups of specimens, as shown in Fig. 5(b), (d), and (f). The microstructure of 950 °C heat-treated specimen is uniformly fine and dominated by PF and GB [Fig. 2(c)]. Following the second heat treatment at 800 °C, the microstructure changes slightly, and the microstructure after cooling is mainly ferrite and bainite [ Fig. 6(a)]. When T p2 is 950 °C, the microstructure is completely austenitized in heating. As T p2 is same as T p1, the microstructure does not change much, and the cooled microstructure is more uniform [Fig. 6(c)]. When T p2 is 1350 °C, considerable grain growth occurs in heating. After cooling, the microstructure is mainly composed of GB and LB [Fig. 6(e)]. There are some M-A constituents are observed in the three groups of specimens, as shown in Fig. 6(b), (d), and (f). The microstructure and M-A constituent in the specimens when the first peak temperature is 1350 °C and the secondary peak value is different are shown in Fig. 7. With T p1 is 1350 °C, the main microstructure before the second heat treatment is coarse LB [Fig. 2(d)]. If T p2 is 800 °C, coarse chain-like M-A constituent segregates at the grain boundaries, as shown in Fig. 7(a). When T p2 is 950 °C, the grains become smaller, and the microstructure is composed of PF and GB [Fig. 7(c)]. When T p2 is 1350 °C, the microstructure changes slightly, and the grains are relatively coarse; the microstructure is mainly composed of LB; the reason is that T p1 and T p2 are the same [Fig. 7(e)]. Image-J image processing software was used to quantitatively calculate the area of M-A constituent in the color metallographic structure of Figs. 5–7. The calculation results are shown in Table 3."
8,Changes in grain boundary misorientation and grain size,"4.2 Changes in grain boundary misorientation and grain size The number of double heat-treated specimens is sufficient to analyze the influence of grain boundary misorientation and grain size. Thus, EBSD analysis was performed only for the double heat-treated specimens. Fig. 8 shows the inverse pole figure and grain boundary misorientation of the “800 + 800” specimen, while Fig. 9 shows the frequency distribution of grain size and boundary misorientation in the corresponding specimen. According to the data in Fig. 9, the cumulative fraction of boundary misorientation and average grain size of the “800 + 800” specimen can be calculated. The same method was used to analyze all specimens, and the statistical results of cumulative fraction of boundary misorientation and average grain size are shown in Table 4. Boundaries with orientation difference greater than 2° were identified as grain boundaries, in which those with orientation difference greater than 15° were considered high-angle grain boundaries, and those with orientation difference less than 15° were considered low-angle grain boundaries. As shown in Table 4, the grain size of the specimen is large, especially after two overheating treatments, when whether T p1 or T p2 is 1350 ℃. In general, the grain size is larger when more low-angle grain boundaries are considered; conversely, the grain size is smaller when more high-angle grain boundaries are regarded."
9,Changes in dislocation density,"4.3 Changes in dislocation density Here, the dislocation density was determined by XRD. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 10. Jade 6 software was applied to obtain the location (2θ) and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of diffraction peak for each reflection. Then, the modified Williamson-Hall algorithm was used to calculate the dislocation density of each specimen. The modified Williamson–Hall plot can be expressed as the following equation in a cubic crystal [13]: (1) ∆ K = 0.9 D + π M 2 b 2 2 1 2 ρ 1 2 K C ̅ 1 2 + O K 2 C ̅ , where ΔK = cosθ·Δ(2θ)/λ, K = 2sinθ/λ, and θ is the diffraction angle, Δ(2θ) is the FWHM, λ is the wavelength of X-rays; D is the average grain size, Table 4; M is a constant depending on the effective outer cut-off radius of dislocations, and M = 2 is used for steel [14]; b is the Burgers vector of dislocations, and the value for α-Fe is 2.481 Å [15]; ρ is the average dislocation density and O indicates non-interpreted higher-order terms; C ̅ is the average contrast factor of dislocations, and it is calculated according to [16]. (2) C ¯ = C ¯ h 00 ( 1 − q H 2 ) , where C ̅ h00 is the average dislocation contrast factors for the h00 reflection; here, C ̅ h00 = 0.332 and q = 2.02 [14], and H 2 = (h 2 k 2 +h 2 l 2 + k 2 l 2)/(h 2 + k 2 +l 2)2. h, k, and l are the Miller indices corresponding to diffraction vector. The three peaks in Fig. 10 correspond to the crystal faces of (110), (200), and (211) with the H 2 values of 0.25, 0, and 0.25, respectively. The relation curve between ΔK and K C ̅ 1 2 is drawn and linear fitting is conducted while ignoring the influence of the higher order terms in Eq. (1). The slope of fitting line is π M 2 b 2 2 1 2 ρ 1 2 , and then, the dislocation density (ρ) is determined. Table 5 lists the calculated dislocation density in the double heat-treated specimens. Relatively speaking, the specimen with the T p2 of 1350 °C has a higher dislocation density regardless of the T p1 value, followed by the specimen with the T p2 of 800 °C, and the T p2 of 950 °C is the lowest."
10,Hydrogen permeation parameters,"4.4 Hydrogen permeation parameters The hydrogen permeation curves of base metal and heat-treated specimens in 1.2 MPa are shown in Fig. 11. As observed, the hydrogen permeation current changes from nearly zero to a stable high value (i ∞). Parameters such as hydrogen diffusion coefficient D and adsorbed hydrogen concentration C 0 are commonly used to evaluate the hydrogen permeation behavior of materials. The first step to properly calculate the permeation parameters of hydrogen in materials is to fit the experimental results with the theoretical model for determining the appropriate mathematical equations for calculation. According to the hydrogen charging conditions of the specimen, two hydrogen permeation models with constant concentration (CC) and constant flux (CF) are obtained. For CC model, the hydrogen concentration on charging surface remains constant and that on oxidizing surface remains zero, while the initial concentration is zero at any position within the specimen. For CF model, the permeation flux on oxidizing surface remains constant with time. The theoretical permeation transients follow the dimensionless Eqs. (4) and (5) for CC and CF models, respectively [17]. (4) I t I ∞ = 2 ( π τ ) 1 / 2 ∑ n = 0 ∞ exp ⁡ [ − ( 2 n + 1 ) 2 4 τ ] (5) I t I ∞ = 1 − 4 π ∑ n = 0 ∞ ( − 1 ) n ( 2 n + 1 ) exp ⁡ [ − ( 2 n + 1 ) 2 π 2 τ 4 ] where I t is the hydrogen permeation current at instant time and I ∞ is the steady-state value of the permeation current. τ is equal to Dt/L 2 (D is the hydrogen diffusivity and L is the specimen thickness). Fig. 12 shows the fitting results of experimental data from a X80 steel specimen in 12 MPa hydrogen gas with CC and CF models. The measured data points fit well with the theoretical curve plotted under the CC model. Thus, the analysis of the hydrogen permeation results in this study follow the CC model. Based on the CC model, four calculation methods are applicable to obtain hydrogen permeation parameters, namely, the time-to-breakthrough, the time-lag, the Laplace, and the Fourier method [17]. The Fourier method, which is independent of starting monitoring time, was applied in this study. The equation for calculating hydrogen diffusion coefficient D by Fourier method is (6) ln ( 1 − i t i ∞ ) = − π 2 D t L 2 + ln 2 The slope –π2 D/L 2 can be obtained by plotting the relationship between ln(1-i t/i ∞) and time t, and then, the D value can be calculated. When the hydrogen permeation current is stable, the hydrogen concentration in the specimen also reaches a stable state. At this point, Fick’s first law can be used to calculate the adsorbed hydrogen concentration C 0 on the charging surface of a specimen. The equation is as follows: (7) C 0 = i ∞ L D F , where F is Faraday’s constant. According to Sieverts law [18], the solubility of hydrogen in the material (S) is equal to the ratio of the adsorbed hydrogen concentration C 0 on the specimen surface to the difference between the square root of hydrogen fugacity f on both sides of the specimen. (8) S = C 0 f in 1 / 2 − f out 1 / 2 , where f in and f out are the fugacity of hydrogen at the charging surface and the hydrogen detecting surface, respectively. The index “1/2” indicates that hydrogen diffuses in the form of atoms. Theoretical calculation [19] found that the value of hydrogen fugacity f is the same as that of hydrogen pressure P within 12 MPa hydrogen pressure. Therefore, hydrogen charging pressure P in is used to replace hydrogen charging fugacity f in. The H diffused to the detecting surface can be oxidized to H+ instantly. Thus, the hydrogen pressure and hydrogen fugacity are always zero. Eq. (8) can be converted into (9) S = C 0 P in 1 / 2 . Given the presence of a large number of hydrogen traps in the specimen, hydrogen traps are filled first in the hydrogen diffusion process, which makes the measured diffusion coefficient D lower than the lattice hydrogen diffusion coefficient D L. The process of the hydrogen diffusion delay has a strong relationship with hydrogen trap density N T. Therefore, determining the hydrogen trap density in the steel is important to analyze the change mechanism of hydrogen permeation behavior. The equation of calculating hydrogen trap density N T is (10) N T = C 0 3 ( D L D - 1 ) where D L is 9.78 × 10−9 m2·s−1 at 313 K (40 °C) [20]. The slope is obtained by fitting the relationship between ln(1-i t/i ∞) and time t for each hydrogen permeation curve. Then, according to Eqs. (6), (7), (9), and (10), the hydrogen permeation parameters of the base material and the specimens treated by thermal cycle(s) can be obtained, including D, C 0, S and N T in the specimen, as shown in Table 6. As shown in Table 6, the D value of the base material is higher than that of the HAZ, while the C 0, S, and N T in the specimen are smaller than that of the HAZ. In the HAZ subjected to one thermal cycle, no significant difference is observed between the hydrogen permeation parameters in ICHAZ and FGHAZ, and their D values are lower than that of CGHAZ. Meanwhile, the three other parameters (C 0, S, and N T) are obviously higher. In the HAZ subjected to double thermal cycles, the three groups of specimens show the same trends when T p1 is same and T p2 is different. Specifically, with the increase in T p2, D gradually increases, and C 0, S, and N T gradually decrease. When T p2 is same and T p1 is different, the three groups of specimens show inconsistent trends. The hydrogen permeation parameters of specimens undergoing single and double heat treatment are put together for comparison in Fig. 13 to visually display and analyze the hydrogen permeation parameters of specimens undergoing different heat treatments. As observed, the D value of each heat-affected subzone is strongly influenced by T p2. D increases gradually with increase in T p2 in general. When T p2 is 1350 °C, all the specimens show a large D no matter how high the T p1 is. If T p2 is lower than T p1, then the D value of the specimen after double heat treatment will not be greater than that of the specimen after the first heat treatment. If T p2 is same as T p1, then the D value of the specimen subjected to two thermal cycles is higher than that of the specimen subjected to single thermal cycle, such as “800 + 800,” “950 + 950,” and “1350 + 1350” compared with “800,” “950,” and “1350,” respectively. Fig. 13(b)–(d) show that the C 0, S, and N T are also greatly affected by T p2. When T p1 is constant, the C 0, S, and N T gradually decrease with the increase in T p2. At the same time, the overall behavior is contrary to D. C 0, S, and N T of the “1350 + 800” specimen are significantly higher than those undergoing other treatments."
11,Discussion,"Heat treatment does not cause the change in the overall chemical composition of steel. Thus, the fundamental reason for the influence of heat treatment on hydrogen permeation parameters is the change in the microstructure. The hydrogen permeation parameters of materials generally include D, S, and C 0. According to Eqs. (7) and (9), C 0 is inversely proportional to D, while S is directly proportional to C 0. Obviously, the factors that affect D are also the factors that affect S and C 0. Thus, the following only discusses the influence of microstructure characteristics on D. The factors that influence the diffusion behavior of hydrogen in materials are, first, phase composition and their relative quantity. The phases that may appear in X80 steel-welded joints are nothing more than AF, PF, LB, GB, and M-A constituent, while the diffusivity of hydrogen in these phases is different. The corresponding relationship between D and phase composition is summarized in Table 7 according to the previous microstructure observation and calculation results of hydrogen permeation parameters. Among all the specimens, only the base metal contains a large amount of AF, and its D value is much higher than that of other specimens. Thus, AF has the highest D. The main phase of the specimen with the second highest D is GB. Thus, the D of GB is lower than that of AF but higher than that of other phases. The specimen with the third and fourth highest D has the mixed structure of GB and LB, while the main phase of the specimen with the fifth highest D is LB, which indicates that the D of LB is lower than GB. The D of the specimens with a mixture of PF and GB are ranked in the following order. Thus, the D of PF is lower than that of LB. The specimen containing chain-like M-A component has the lowest D. As a result, the M-A constituent has the lowest D among possible phases. Therefore, Table 7 reveals that the order of D from high to low is AF, GB, LB, PF, and M-A. According to the descending order of D, the corresponding changes in M-A content, dislocation density, grain size, and grain boundary misorientation ratio in each specimen are listed, as shown in Fig. 14, and the reasons for the changes in D of each phase are analyzed. The D of hydrogen in the BCC lattice is higher than that in the FCC lattice. Ferrite (AF and PF) has BCC lattice, while bainite is a ferrite matrix with granular carbon-rich phases, and some of them are M-A constituent. The larger size of M-A constituent, which exists in chain form at grain boundary, can be considered a single phase. The M-A constituent is composed of carbon-rich martensite (M) and retained austenite [21]. The research of Qu et al. [22] showed that the D of hydrogen in AF, PF, and M decreases sequentially. The D of M is lower than that of ferrite, and the D of austenite is lower with FCC structure. Thus, the M-A constituent has a lower D overall. As shown in Fig. 14, the base metal with AF as the main phase has a high D value, which should be related to its low M-A content and low dislocation density, as shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b). As mentioned above, the D of hydrogen in the M-A constituent is low, while the dislocation, as a hydrogen trap, has a pinning effect on hydrogen. The D of the material is higher when the amount of M-A and dislocation is less. However, the M-A content and dislocation density of the “800 + 950” specimen are also low, but its D is much lower than that of the parent metal. As shown in Fig. 14(c), the grain size of the “800 + 950” specimen is fine, and the D of the specimens with fine grain is low. Grain boundaries are more when the grain size is smaller. Therefore, the grain boundaries have an impeding effect on the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. Grain boundaries are further divided into high- and low-angle grain boundaries. Fig. 14(d) shows the relationship between D and the proportions of the two grain boundaries, and the “800 + 950” specimen has a high proportion of high-angle grain boundaries and a very low proportion of low-angle grain boundaries. The high-angle grain boundaries play a major role in the process of the grain boundaries by hindering the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. The main reason is that the binding energy between the high-angle grain boundary and hydrogen atom is high, and the hydrogen atom is difficult to break free after it is adsorbed by grain boundary. The latter condition slows down the diffusion rate of hydrogen atom and reduces the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen atom. For “1350 + 1350,” “950 + 1350,” and “800 + 1350” specimens, the corresponding D decreases successively, and the corresponding microstructure is GB, GB plus a small amount of LB, and LB plus a small amount of GB, respectively. Although both types of bainite are composed of ferrite and granular M-A, the M-A is dispersed on the ferrite matrix in GB but parallel to narrow lath ferrite in LB. The orderly arrangement of M-A seems to prevent hydrogen diffusion. The grain growth of the three specimens with the T p2 of 1350 °C is relatively serious. Although the grain size decreases with the decline in the T p1, the proportion of the high-angle grain boundary has a slight difference. As a result, the grain boundary should not be the key affecting factor of the D of the two bainite. Comparing the dislocation density of the three specimens shows that the dislocation density increases significantly with the appearance of LB and the increase in LB content in GB, which indicates that the dislocation density in LB is much higher than that in GB. The regular distribution of M-A plays the role of hydrogen barrier layer, and a large number of dislocations act as hydrogen traps; both are the main reasons why the D of LB is lower than that of GB. The microstructure of specimens with a final heat treatment temperature of 950 °C is composed of PF and a small amount of GB. As shown in Fig. 14, the D of these specimens generally decreases with the increase in M-A content, the decrease in grain size, and the increase in the proportion of high-angle grain boundary. Meanwhile, the influence of dislocation changes is irregular. The 950 °C heat treatment is equivalent to normalizing treatment, which results in a uniform and fine structure. The existence of a large number of high-angle grain boundaries and the precipitation of carbon-rich phase are the main reasons for the low D of PF plus GB. Furthermore, the phase composition of “950 + 950” and “800 + 800” specimens is both PF and GB, but the former has more PF, while the latter has more GB. The latter has less M-A, but its grain size decreases and the proportion of high-angle grain boundary increases significantly. As a result, the D decreases. This finding shows that the increase in high-angle grain boundary density plays a more important role in the change in D than the decrease in M-A content. Some M-A constituents are observed in all specimens, and the difference lies in the content, size, morphology, and distribution of M-A. Some M-A constituents exist in chain form at grain boundary in the “1350 + 800” specimen, while they all exist in granular form in other specimens. As shown in Fig. 14(a), the D of specimens with a large number of M-A is generally low, such as the points on the right of “950 + 950” specimen. However, the “800” specimen has more M-A than “1350 + 800” specimen, but its D is higher than that of the latter. This result indicates that the influence of geometric features will exceed the influence of M-A content when M-A exists in chain form at grain boundary. The “1350 + 800” specimen has the lowest D among all the specimens because it has a high content of M-A that exists in chain form. The abovementioned analysis shows that the changes in lattice structure, high-angle grain boundary density, dislocation density, and the content, morphology, and distribution of M-A constituent all affect the hydrogen diffusion. Moreover, the change of these factors with the heat treatment temperature is the fundamental reason for the change in hydrogen permeation parameters in specimens with different phase compositions. The D value of the base metal is the highest, which is related to its main composition being AF. The D value of the specimens with a final heat treatment temperature of 1350 °C is generally higher. In this case, the influence of grain boundary is not great. The influencing factors are mainly the distribution of granular M-A and the dislocation density. The value of D is high when the M-A is dispersed and the dislocation density is low. When the final heat treatment temperature is 950 °C, the D value of the specimen is not high or low. The grain size of the corresponding specimens is uniform, and the phase composition is mainly PF. The density of high-angle grain boundary and the content of granular M-A constituent are the key affecting factors of the D value. The D of the specimens treated at the final heat treatment temperature of 800 °C is low because the content of M-A constituent is high. The D value of the specimen is the lowest when M-A constituent exists in the chain form at the grain boundary, and the influence of the geometrical characteristics of M-A constituent exceeds the influence of its content."
12,Conclusions,"(1) The hydrogen permeation parameters of each heat-affected subzone in the X80 steel welded joints are determined. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient D is mainly determined by the peak temperature of the final heat treatment, and the D increases with the rise in the peak temperature. (2) If T p2 is lower than the first peak temperature T p1, then the D value of the T p1 + T p2 specimen is smaller than that of the T p1 specimen; if T p2 is equal to or higher than T p1, then the D value after double heat treatments is greater than that after single heat treatment and increases with the rise in T p2. (3) The order of D from high to low is AF, GB, LB, PF, and M-A. The main reasons for this change are the changes in lattice structure, high-angle grain boundary density, dislocation density, and the content, morphology, and distribution of M-A constituents. The key influencing factors change with the change in final heat treatment temperature."
