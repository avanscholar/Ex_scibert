0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen [1–3]. The process employing pure water usually shows low efficiencies because (1) photo-generated electrons and holes can easily recombine, (2) it is a multistep reaction involving the transfer of four electrons, (3) the backward reaction (H2 + O2 = H2O) is highly likely to proceed [3–9]. As a common approach to achieve efficient hydrogen production, sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) are added into water, effectively scavenging photo-generated holes and enabling a two-electron-transfer process [10–13]. However, only a little attention has been paid to identify whether hydrogen is produced from water or the sacrificial molecules. In 2012, Guo et al. indicated that photocatalytic methanol dissociation could take place on TiO2 (110) surface whereas photocatalytic water dissociation would rarely happen due to the facile reverse reaction, which is the first work questioning the origin of hydrogen [14]. In contrast, over Pt-loaded TiO2, hydrogen mainly from water instead of sacrificial methanol has been demonstrated [15,16]. However, with formaldehyde employed as the sacrificial reagent over Pt-loaded TiO2, hydrogen was surprisingly found to originate from both formaldehyde and water [15,17,18]. Therefore, the role of sacrificial reagents in the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production is still elusive, as stated in three decent commentary articles published in recent years [12,19,20]. Namely, the semi-reaction of hydrogen production is generally assumed to be the same whether just pure water or SEDs are used [19], whereas oxidation products generated from the SEDs may compete with water in the reduction reaction [12,19,20]. For example, alcohols are the most widely used SEDs with protons as the oxidation byproduct, which can be further reduced into hydrogen. In this case, alcohol performs as both electron donor and electron acceptor, so the efficiency of hydrogen production simply reflects alcohol decomposition rather than water splitting. Therefore, in the presence of sacrificial reagents, the produced hydrogen is not always from water in a photocatalytic process. This constitutes the first hypothesis for this work. In 2011, Chen et al. made a great breakthrough for the most important photocatalyst “TiO2”, namely, nanophase white TiO2 was transformed to black TiO2 by hydrogenation treatment, extending its light absorption from ultraviolet to the visible and even infrared region [21]. However, despite the great enhancement of hydrogen production from the methanol-water mixture under simulated sunlight irradiation over Pt-loaded black TiO2, the visible-light photocatalytic efficiency was still very low [21]. Our group revealed that such a poor efficiency under visible light was due to the insufficient driving force of the oxidation reaction [22]. To solve the issue, we increased the kinetic energy of the reactant molecules by elevating the temperature, reaching sufficient oxidation driving force. As a result, a high hydrogen evolution rate and impressive apparent quantum efficiencies were obtained in the visible-light range [22]. Furthermore, we evaluated how thermal energy (kinetic energy) affected the photocatalytic mechanism, confirming the rationality of thermo-photo catalysis [23]. So far, however, the influence of photo energy on thermal catalysis was ignored in the thermo-photo catalytic process. It is well-known that light irradiation can cause some reactions such as photo-induced reduction [24]. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to propose the second hypothesis that light irradiation may modify the active sites by inducing the structure change of the catalyst surface and thus enhancing the thermal catalytic performance. Furthermore, since a temperature above 100 °C was employed in the thermo-photo process, liquid water would undergo a phase transformation to water vapor. Water molecules can dissociate into protons in liquid phase whereas such a dissociation is negligible in gas phase [25–28]. Therefore, as the third hypothesis, photo-excited electrons would directly reduce water molecules in the thermo-photo process, which is totally different from the reduction of protons in the conventional photocatalytic process. In this work, we designed and conducted experiments over Rh-loaded TiO2 catalyst to prove the above three hypotheses. Isotope labeling experiments indicated that the room-temperature photocatalytic hydrogen production with a methanol-water mixture could not be simply described as photocatalytic water splitting (with methanol as the SED) due to the significant contribution of methanol decomposition. Instead, in the thermo-photo catalytic process, the active species of water reduction turned to water molecules due to the phase transition, leading to a new reaction pathway with a high utilization rate of water and thus achieving hydrogen production mainly from water. Furthermore, in such a unique thermo-photo process, the introduction of thermal energy not only allowed a high oxidation degree but also increased the oxidation driving force, realizing 1500-fold enhancement in photohydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation. More importantly, it was demonstrated that light irradiation significantly accelerated thermal catalysis via reducing the oxidized Rh nanoparticles and enhancing the interaction between Rh and TiO2."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 1 wt % Rh-loaded TiO2 was prepared by impregnation of 1 g TiO2 (P25, Sigma Aldrich) with a 5 ml aqueous solution of RhCl3·3H2O. The mixture was stirred till dry at a hot plate at 60 °C and then calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. The obtained solid was subsequently treated under a 50 ml/min H2 gas flow at 500 °C for 5 h. 1 wt % Pt-loaded TiO2 was prepared in the same manner as Rh-loaded TiO2 but with H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6100). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field emission transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer with an aluminum anode (Al Kα, hν =1486.6 eV). UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). IR-thermographic images were taken with CEM DT-980H Infrared Thermal Imager. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement was carried out in a Bruker A300 instrument."
4,Mott-Schottky analysis,"2.3 Mott-Schottky analysis An electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode cell was used for Mott-Schottky analysis. A fluorine doped tin oxide glass electrode coated with Rh-loaded TiO2, a Pt electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical measurement was conducted at 1, 2 and 3 kHz in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution in the dark."
5,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations,2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The Vienna ab initio simulation package was used for DFT calculations to figure out the adsorption site of methanol on Rh-loaded TiO2 [29]. Anatase TiO2 (101) surface and rutile TiO2 (110) surface were used for constructing the models with a cluster composed of 6 Rh atoms. The facets were selected based on our TEM and XRD results and the reports indicating their energetically favorable natures [30–32]. One of the oxygen atoms in the anatase/rutile supercell was removed to simulate the oxygen vacancy as evidenced by the EPR spectrum. The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane wave basis sets was set as 450 eV. The remaining core electrons were described by the projector augmented-wave method. The surface Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 2 × 2 × 1 k-point sampling in the Brillouin zone were employed for the slab model. The largest remaining force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was used for all calculations [33].
6,Room-temperature photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.5 Room-temperature photocatalytic activity measurement 15 mg Rh-loaded TiO2 was dispersed on the light-diffuse-reflection-surface of a SiO2 rectangular substrate (2.5 cm × 1.6 cm). Then the substrate was immersed into a 15 ml methanol-water mixture with a molar ratio of 1:20 in a quartz reactor (Figure S1a). Before photocatalytic reaction, the reactor was evacuated by a vacuum pump to remove any impurity gases. Then Rh-loaded TiO2 was illuminated by a Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, AULIGHT) which was equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter with the light intensity kept at 100 mW/cm2. UVcut420 filter was used for the photocatalytic reaction under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Gas products were measured per hour by an online gas chromatograph (GC) with a TDX-01 packed column. Liquid products were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with a C18 column."
7,Thermo-photo catalytic activity measurement,"2.6 Thermo-photo catalytic activity measurement A SiO2 elliptic substrate (π × 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm) with 15 mg Rh-loaded TiO2 dispersed on its light-diffuse-reflection-surface was placed in a home-made quartz reactor (Figure S1b). 30 ml/min Ar gas flow was introduced into the system for 0.5 h to remove any impurity gases. Then the flowrate of Ar gas was turned down to 10 ml/min while the evaporator tube and the quartz reactor were heated to the selected temperatures by electrical furnaces. After the temperature was stabilized, a 0.005 ml/min methanol-water mixture with a molar ratio of 1:20 was pumped into the evaporator tube via a high-pressure infusion pump and then taken into the reactor by Ar gas flow. 15 min later, incident light from the same light source as mentioned above was introduced onto the surface of SiO2 substrate through a hole at the furnace wall. A UVcut420 filter was used for the visible-light photocatalytic reaction. A condenser was placed right after the reactor to collect unreacted liquids and products, which were then analyzed by HPLC. Gas products were analyzed in a time interval of 0.5 h via an online GC. The photohydrogen production rate at certain temperature is defined as the difference between the hydrogen production rates without and with light irradiation at the same temperature: [photohydrogen production rate at X °C] = [thermo-photo catalytic hydrogen production rate at X °C] – [thermal catalytic hydrogen production rate at X °C]"
8,Apparent quantum efficiency,"2.7 Apparent quantum efficiency Hydrogen production rates were measured with light irradiation at various wavelengths including 350, 420, 500, 600, and 700 nm, using a series of quartz band-pass filters which were overlaid on the AM 1.5 G filter of Xe lamp. Photohydrogen production rate is regarded as the difference between hydrogen production rates with and without light irradiation at a certain temperature. The evolution of a hydrogen molecule requires two electrons, therefore the apparent quantum efficiency at a selected wavelength can be expressed as: A p p a r e n t q u a n t u m e f f i c i e n c y = n u m b e r o f p h o t o h y d r o g e n m o l e c u l e s × 2 n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s The number of incident photons can be calculated by the following equation: N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s p e r s e c o n d = l i g h t i n t e n s i t y × i r r a d i a t i o n a r e a × l i g t h w a v e l e n g t h P l a n c k ' s c o n s t a n t × l i g h t s p e e d"
9,Isotope labeling experiments,"2.8 Isotope labeling experiments A series of isotope labeling experiments were carried out with partially deuterated methanol-water mixtures (CH3OH-D2O, CD3OD-H2O, CD3OH-H2O, and CH3OD-H2O) with a molar ratio of 1:20. For room-temperature photocatalytic test, a catalyst-dispersed SiO2 substrate was immersed into a deuterated methanol-water mixture and then illuminated by AM 1.5 G sunlight for 3 h. The gas products were analyzed by an online mass spectrometer (MS). For thermo-photo catalytic test, a deuterated methanol-water mixture was pumped into the reactor which had been heated to 260 °C. Light was turned on after 15 min stabilization. After illumination on the catalyst for 1 h, gas products were collected for 1.5 h and then analyzed by MS. The MS signals at m/z = 2, 3, and 4 were recorded, corresponding to H2, HD, and D2, respectively. The proportions of these three substances were then calculated, from which the percentages of H atoms (H2 % + 0.5 HD %) and D atoms (D2 % + 0.5 HD %) in the as-produced hydrogen could be obtained."
10,Results and discussion,
11,"Which is the main source of hydrogen produced in the photocatalytic process, water or sacrificial methanol?","3.1 Which is the main source of hydrogen produced in the photocatalytic process, water or sacrificial methanol? Rh-loaded TiO2 was prepared via impregnation, calcination, and hydrogenation. The structure and properties of the catalyst were characterized and discussed in the Supplementary Material (Figure S2-S5). The average size of Rh nanoparticles was as small as 1.7 nm (Figure S3), indicating a high proportion of Rh atoms located in the vicinity of the interface of Rh and TiO2 [34]. Moreover, Rh 3d XPS spectrum (Figure S4c) implied that Rh nanoparticle was partially covered by a layer of Rh2O3. The lower binding energies compared with those of bulk Rh and Rh2O3 further suggested that electrons could easily transfer from TiO2 to Rh [35–37]. In valence band XPS spectrum (Figure S4d), an extension of 1.84 eV toward the Fermi level was observed, indicating the existence of a mid-gap state (namely, a donor level located between the valence band and conduction band), in good agreement with the strong visible light absorption demonstrated by the UV–vis spectrum of Rh-loaded TiO2 (Figure S5b). Herein, both Rh loading and TiO2 reduction contributed to the visible light absorption [21]. The mid-gap state might be resulted by oxygen vacancies whose existence was demonstrated by the EPR spectrum (Figure S6) in which a large peak at g = 2.0028 corresponding to oxygen vacancies with trapped electrons was observed [21,22,38]. Rh-loaded TiO2 was subjected to photocatalytic hydrogen production at room temperature. As shown in Figure S1a, a SiO2 disk with Rh-loaded TiO2 dispersed on its light-diffuse-reflection-surface was immersed into a methanol-water mixture and illuminated by an AM 1.5 G sunlight simulator. The hydrogen production rate (Fig. 1 a) was measured to be 7.27 mmol/h/g with HCHO and HCOOH as the major oxidation products, whereas it dramatically decreased to 0.02 mmol/h/g under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The apparent quantum efficiencies at 350, 420, 500, 600, and 700 nm were estimated to be 0.6372 %, 0.0231 %, 0.0098 %, 0.0068 %, and 0.0041 %, respectively, which were in good agreement with the light absorption (Fig. 1b). These results demonstrated that UV light played a key role in room-temperature photocatalytic reaction while visible light contributed little to hydrogen production though it can be absorbed by the catalyst. Isotope labeling experiments with various deuterated methanol-water mixtures were carried out to evaluate the reaction pathway. The m/z signals at 2, 3 and 4 were recorded by a mass spectrometer, corresponding to H2, HD and D2, respectively. Negligible hydrogen was generated from the catalyst itself (hydrogen treated Rh-loaded TiO2) since the proportion of H atoms in the evolved hydrogen gas was as low as 0.50 % with CD3OD-D2O employed as the reactant. The proportions of H2, HD and D2 from deuterated methanol-water mixtures were shown in Fig. 2 a. When using CH3OH-D2O as the reactant, H2, HD and D2 accounted for 58.42 %, 7.31 % and 34.27 %, respectively. The proportions of hydrogen originated from methanol (the ratio of H atoms) and water (the ratio of D atoms) were then estimated to be 62.08 % and 37.92 %, respectively, in good agreement with the percentages of 59.74 % (the ratio of D atoms) and 40.26 % (the ratio of H atoms) obtained from the CD3OD-H2O mixture. Furthermore, m/z signals at 19 and 33 which correspond to HOD and CH3OD were very weak after photocatalytic reaction with CH3OH-D2O mixture, indicating the negligible H/D exchange in the process (Table S1). The finding that only ∼ 40 % of the evolved hydrogen came from water was strongly against the generally believed process of “electron donor assisted photocatalytic water splitting” and in this case methanol acted as both electron donor and electron acceptor. The stepwise reactions were proposed as shown in eqn. 1–8 with D2O substituting H2O to illustrate the source of H atoms. Firstly, Rh-loaded TiO2 absorbed light to generate photo-excited electrons and holes (eqn. 1). Photo-excited holes could react with CH3OH to produce HCHO and H+ (eqn. 2). HCHO then combined with D2O to form CH2(OD)2 (eqn. 3), [15,39] which could be further oxidized into HCOOD with H+ and D+ as the byproducts (eqn. 4). As-produced H+ and D+ as well as D+ generated from water ionization (eqn. 5) could be reduced by photo-excited electrons, leading to the generation of H2 (eqn. 6), HD (eqn. 7), and D2 (eqn. 8). The experimental observation that ∼ 60 % of the reduced protons were from methanol implied that the sites of the oxidation and reduction reactions might be very close, in favor of the reduction of H+ generated from methanol oxidation. (1) Rh‐loaded TiO 2 → hv e - + h + (2) C H 3 O H + 2 h + → H C H O + 2 H + (3) H C H O + D 2 O → C H 2 ( O D ) 2 (4) C H 2 ( O D ) 2 + 2 h + → H C O O D + H + + D + (5) D 2 O ↔ D + + O D - (6) 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 (7) H + + D + + 2 e - → H D (8) 2 D + + 2 e - → D 2 Isotope labeling experiments with CH3OD-H2O and CD3OH-H2O were conducted as well. When CH3OD-H2O was employed, the proportions of D2 and HD were as low as 2.14 % and 2.61 % (Fig. 2a), suggesting that proton produced from the hydroxy of methanol could be reduced into hydrogen whereas the possibility of its reduction was low. This was supported by DFT calculations as following. Anatase (101), as the most abundant surface of anatase TiO2 [30–32], which was also observed in the HRTEM image (Figure S3b), was selected to build the model. One of the oxygen atoms in the anatase supercell was removed to simulate the oxygen vacancy. As shown in Fig. 3 , the energies of methanol adsorption on Rh-TiO2 interface, Rh, and TiO2 were -0.58, -0.52, and -0.15 eV, respectively, indicating that methanol molecules tended to adsorb on the interface of Rh and TiO2, which might induce certain space confinement effect. Furthermore, the optimization results suggested that H atom of the hydroxy would adsorb on the bridge-bonded oxygen site of TiO2 while O atom of the hydroxy would adsorb on Rh. Similar results were also obtained by using the defective rutile TiO2 (110) model (Figure S7). Thus, H+ generated from the hydroxyl (due to the hole-induced oxidation) would stay near TiO2 with a strong interaction with O atom [21]. Since TiO2 was electron-deficient as indicated by Rh 3d XPS spectrum (Figure S4c) as well as other studies, H+ adsorbed on TiO2 was less likely to be reduced [11,40]. This can be the main reason for the limited contribution of the hydroxy to hydrogen production. In contrast, when CD3OH-H2O was employed, the proportions of D2 and HD were 50.65 % and 7.64 % respectively, thereby the percentage of hydrogen originated from the methyl was estimated to be 54.47 %. This indicated that H+ produced from the methyl was very likely to be reduced probably because it was more flexible and thus more likely to move onto the surface of Rh nanoparticles. The transfer of protons could be achieved by either liquid medium or molecularly-adsorbed water and methanol [18,41–43]. The sum of this percentage and that from the hydroxy (54.47 % + 3.45 % = 57.92 %) was almost the same as the result obtained from CD3OD-H2O (59.74 %), demonstrating the credibility of these isotope labeling experiments. Furthermore, from the intensity of H2, HD, and D2 (Figure S8), it was observed that slower reaction rates were resulted with the use of isotope-labeled reactants. Nevertheless, the intensity of D2 generated from CH3OH-D2O mixture was almost the same as that of H2 generated from CD3OD-H2O mixture (0.19 vs. 0.20), and the intensities of H2 from CH3OH-D2O and D2 from CD3OD-H2O were also nearly identical (0.32 vs. 0.31). This indicated that kinetic factors of isotope labeling showed little influence on our analysis of the origin of evolved hydrogen. Moreover, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) could be calculated by comparing the hydrogen production rates using either general reactants (CH3OH and H2O) or deuterated reactants (CH3OD, CD3OH, and D2O). The KIE for CH3OH/CH3OD was as high as 1.91 while the KIE for CH3OH/CD3OH was only 1.07, which suggested the key role of OH bond cleavage. The KIE for H2O/D2O (with CH3OH employed in both cases) was 1.64. Therefore, the cleavage of OH bond in methanol is the rate-limiting step for photocatalytic hydrogen production process. Based on the above results, the reaction process was proposed and shown in Fig. 2b. The reaction took place on the interface of Rh and TiO2 with the transfer of photo-excited electrons from TiO2 to Rh. Proton was the main active species of liquid-phase water reduction [10,44–46]. At the first stage, H+ generated from water ionization was reduced into H2 and meanwhile CH3OH was oxidized to form HCHO, HCOOH and numerous H+. As the reaction proceeded in such a limited space of the interface, the amount of H+ generated from water ionization became lower and lower while the amount of H+ obtained from methanol oxidation increased continuously. The locally high concentration of CH3OH-produced H+ and the facile transfer of methyl-derived H+ enabled their reduction by photo-excited electrons on Rh surface, so there was a little need for H+ from the outer space. Eventually, a balance of the competitive reduction would be reached, and the overall observation demonstrated that methanol contributed to hydrogen production even more than water. In other words, hydrogen was mainly produced from sacrificial methanol instead of water over Rh-loaded TiO2. This is different from the photocatalytic process of water with methanol over Pt-loaded TiO2, in which water was the main origin for produced hydrogen. This is because Pt-loaded TiO2 possessed more separate sites of oxidation and reduction reactions, [16,17,41] and therefore methanol contributed less to the reduction reaction than that over Rh-loaded TiO2."
12,How to achieve hydrogen production mainly from water?,"3.2 How to achieve hydrogen production mainly from water? Protons play a key role in hydrogen production, so the absence of protons is highly likely to lead to a different reaction pathway. Previous studies indicated that the standard-state Gibbs energy for gas-phase water dissociation is 389 kcal/mol, leading to an equilibrium constant of 1 × 10−285 mol2 L -2 which is much smaller than that of 1 × 10-14 mol2 L -2 in liquid phase [25–28]. This tiny equilibrium constant suggests that water mainly exists as its molecules with negligible dissociation into protons when test temperatures exceed the boiling point of water (100 °C) [25,26]. In this case, water molecules rather than protons would be reduced, with OH- as the byproduct (eqn. 9, shown in the deuterated form). In the limited space of the interface of Rh and TiO2, OD- could easily combine with H+ and D+ generated in methanol oxidation to form HOD (eqn. 10) and D2O (eqn. 11). This favorable combination was also demonstrated by the tiny equilibrium constant as mentioned above. Following such a reaction pathway, the contribution of water to hydrogen production might be greatly enhanced. (9) 2 D 2 O + 2 e - → D 2 + 2 O D - (10) H + + O D - → H O D (11) D + + O D - → D 2 O (12) 2 H O D + 2 e - → H 2 / H D / D 2 + 2 O D - / O H - (13) H C O O D → C O + H O D (14) H C O O D + 2 h + → C O 2 + H + + D + To verify this prediction, isotope labeling experiments were conducted in a thermo-photo catalytic system (Figure S1b). Namely, a catalyst-dispersed SiO2 disk was placed in a quartz reactor which was heated to 260 °C by an electrical furnace and light was introduced onto the catalyst through a hole in the furnace wall. The deuterated methanol-water mixture was pumped into the evaporator tube and then into the quartz reactor. Unreacted ones together with liquid products would be collected by a condenser placed right after the reactor. The employment of CD3OD-D2O led to 99.14 % of as-produced hydrogen presented in the form of D, indicating that the catalyst was not the major origin of hydrogen. When using CH3OH-D2O as the reactant, the proportions of H2, HD and D2 were 2.04 %, 20.68 % and 77.28 %, respectively, resulting in 87.62 % of hydrogen derived from water, which was in good agreement with that obtained from CD3OD-H2O (89.61 %) (Fig. 2c). Such high proportions demonstrated that the introduction of thermal energy greatly promoted water reduction and realized hydrogen production mainly from water. Herein, isotope exchange effect was not obvious since only a very small amount of deuterated methanol was detected after the thermo-photo reaction with CH3OH-D2O (Table S1). An evident m/z signal at 19 was observed in the mass spectrum, evidencing the production of HOD (eqn. 10). HOD could either desorb from the catalyst or be further reduced to generate H2 and HD as detected in the gas products (eqn. 12). H2 and HD might be obtained from the protons generated in methanol oxidation as well, because some protons are expected to have a certain mobility on the catalyst surface and be able to reach the reduction metal sites. CO and CO2 were detected as the main oxidation products at 260 °C, with scarce amounts of HCHO and HCOOH generated. In this case, the above-mentioned eqn. 1–4 could still take place, while CO was generated via the decomposition of HCOOD (eqn. 13) and CO2 was formed via the oxidation of HCOOD (eqn. 14). This reaction process was illustrated in Fig. 2d in the non-deuterated forms of the reactants and products."
13,What are the synergetic roles of thermal and photo energies?,"3.3 What are the synergetic roles of thermal and photo energies? The performance of thermo-photo catalytic hydrogen production was evaluated at 260 °C. As-measured hydrogen production rate under AM 1.5 G illumination was 91.20 mmol/h/g, about twice of that obtained in the dark. The photohydrogen production rate, which is defined as the difference between hydrogen production rates with and without light irradiation, was then estimated to be 42.22 mmol/h/g (Fig. 1c). This rate showed little change over 40 h (Figure S9), demonstrating the stability of the catalyst as well as this unique catalytic system. Under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the photohydrogen production rate could still reach 30.28 mmol/h/g, nearly 1500 times higher than that of the room-temperature reaction. Namely, the introduction of thermal energy enabled the efficient utilization of visible light for hydrogen production. Control experiments under visible light irradiation at 260 °C with pristine TiO2 and unreduced Rh-loaded TiO2 showed low hydrogen production rates of 0.13 and 2.45 mmol/h/g respectively, demonstrating the necessity of Rh loading and TiO2 reduction for efficient hydrogen production under visible light. The great enhancement in hydrogen production rate suggested that the introduction of thermal energy could greatly promote photocatalysis in the visible-light range [22,23]. The effects of thermal energy on photocatalysis were further investigated by carrying out experiments with various alcohol-water mixtures. Aldehydes and carboxylic acids were the major oxidation products at room temperature, while CO and CO2 became dominant at 260 °C. The higher oxidation degree of alcohols could lead to the larger number of electrons involved in the reaction and thus promoted the evolution of hydrogen. Besides, at room temperature, the variation of hydrogen production rates from different alcohol-water mixtures (Figure S10a) indicated that alcohol oxidation was the rate-limiting step. This is in excellent agreement with the KIE results as discussed above. To further analyze the reaction kinetics, the band structure of the catalyst was determined (details were provided in the Supplementary Material). As shown in Fig. 4 , with the absorption of UV light, electrons would be excited from the valence band to the conduction band and in this case the driving force of the electron donation of methanol (difference between the valence band potential and the redox potential of HCHO/CH3OH) is 2.15 eV. However, under visible light irradiation, electrons can only be excited from the mid-gap state due to the insufficient light energy, resulting in a much smaller oxidation driving force (difference between the mid-gap potential and the redox potential of HCHO/CH3OH) of 0.31 eV. Herein, the small driving force of methanol oxidation is the main cause of the low efficiency under visible light irradiation. Elevating the reaction temperature can increase the kinetic energy of methanol molecules and thus help to break the kinetic limitation. As a result, hydrogen production under visible light irradiation was greatly enhanced (from 0.02 mmol/h/g at room temperature to 30.28 mmol/h/g at 260 °C). The threshold value for the oxidation driving force has been reported as 1.6 eV, [47,48] so the temperature rise played a limited role to accelerate hydrogen production under UV light (with a driving force of 2.15 eV, surpassing 1.6 eV). It is also important to reveal how photo energy affects thermal catalysis in the thermo-photo catalytic process. When all enhanced hydrogen production rate at 260 °C by light irradiation was attributed to the photocatalytic process, the apparent quantum efficiencies were estimated to be 30.18 %, 11.57 %, 7.63 %, and 5.68 % at 420, 500, 600, and 700 nm, respectively (Fig. 1d), supporting the visible-light photocatalysis. Impressively, the calculated apparent quantum efficiency at 350 nm was as high as 259.77 %. However, the quantum efficiency can never exceed 100 %, namely, even though all photons were absorbed and converted into hydrogen, the maximum quantum efficiency is 100 %. In other words, the increased hydrogen due to light irradiation, all of which was considered as photohydrogen for the calculation of apparent quantum efficiency, was not only from the photocatalytic process, but also from other aspects (light-induced thermal effect or thermal catalysis). IR-thermographic images indicated that light irradiation increased the temperature on the surface of the catalyst by ∼ 6 °C (Figure S11a-b). However, a control experiment with a backside-blackened SiO2 substrate facing light revealed that such a temperature rise could not promote thermal catalysis (Figure S11c). This is because light irradiation could only cause the temperature rise on the catalyst surface while the reactant molecules were still relatively cold, which was insufficient for the acceleration of thermal catalysis. Thus, the excessive apparent quantum efficiency over 100 % here could not be attributed to light-induced thermal effect but the accelerated thermal catalysis by photo energy. By fitting the measured temperature-dependent hydrogen production rates using the Arrhenius equation (Figure S12), apparent activation energies for hydrogen production were obtained. The apparent activation energy in the thermal catalytic reaction was 65.03 kJ/mol, which dramatically decreased to 43.56 kJ/mol upon light irradiation. To identify the active site, Rh-loaded Al2O3 was prepared and tested in the thermo-photo catalytic system at 210−310 °C. Al2O3 is an insulator with a wide bandgap, so photocatalysis cannot take place on it [49]. As shown in Figure S13, the thermal catalytic hydrogen production rates over Rh-loaded Al2O3 were about ∼ 70 % of those over Rh-loaded TiO2, indicating that Rh was the main active species for thermal catalysis. Moreover, no significant difference was observed in the hydrogen production rates over Rh-loaded Al2O3 with and without light irradiation. This implied that the light absorption on TiO2 played a key role to promote thermal catalysis. Thermal catalytic performance is generally determined by the number of active sites and the activity of each site [50]. Accordingly, the introduction of photo energy might improve the thermal catalytic activity via tuning the structure of the catalyst surface [51]. To verify the above assumption, XPS were carried out on Rh-loaded TiO2 after reacting for 3 h at 260 °C under AM 1.5 G illumination. Rh 3d XPS spectrum of the reacted catalyst (Figure S14a) could be divided into two peaks located at 307.4 and 312.1 eV which were attributed to Rh 3d5/2 and Rh 3d3/2 respectively, suggesting that most Rh nanoparticles existed in the metallic form. Since the redox potential of Rh3+/Rh (0.76 V) was more positive than the potential of the conduction band minimum (-0.34 V), the Rh2O3 layer covered on the Rh nanoparticles could be reduced by photo-excited electrons in the conduction band [24]. Besides, the binding energies of Rh shifted to higher values [35,36], and the similar shift was also observed in the O 1s XPS spectrum (Figure S14b) [21], suggesting the enhanced interaction between Rh and TiO2 by light irradiation. Furthermore, the proportion of surface Ti−OH species was found to slightly increase from 8.3% to 10.1% during the reaction, while Ti-H species was not observed (Figure S14c). In contrast, after 3-hour thermal catalytic reaction (namely, without light irradiation), there was still a Rh2O3 layer covered on the Rh nanoparticle as demonstrated by the Rh 3d XPS spectrum (Figure S14d). Besides, the shifts to high binding energies were not observed in both Rh 3d and O 1s XPS spectra (Figure S14d-e). The proportion of surface Ti−OH species even decreased to 6.7 %. Therefore, light irradiation rather than thermal energy played the key role to tune the surface structure of the catalyst. The above results together indicated that while the introduction of thermal energy could enhance the oxidation driving force and thus greatly improved the photocatalytic efficiency under visible light irradiation, photo energy in turn accelerated thermal catalysis via reducing the oxidized Rh nanoparticles and enhancing the interaction between Rh and TiO2."
14,Conclusion,"In conclusion, water was not the main origin to produce hydrogen in the photocatalytic process in the presence of sacrificial methanol over Rh-loaded TiO2 at room temperature. This happened because protons derived from both methanol oxidation and water ionization could be reduced into hydrogen, leading to a surprising finding that the contribution of methanol decomposition (∼ 60 %) was even higher than that of water splitting (∼ 40 %). In contrast, the coupling of thermal and photo energies over Rh-loaded TiO2 resulted in the hydrogen production mainly from water. In the thermo-photo catalytic reaction at temperatures above the boiling point of water, water molecules instead of protons were reduced, with hydroxyl ions as the byproduct. Hydroxyl ions could combine with hydrogen ions generated from methanol oxidation, leading to a unique pathway with a high utilization rate of water. Furthermore, compared with the room-temperature photocatalysis, thermo-photo catalysis achieved 1500-fold increase in the hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation. This could be attributed to the synergic roles of thermal and photo energies. While thermal effect greatly enhanced the photocatalytic performance by increasing the oxidation driving force, photo energy in turn accelerated thermal catalysis by inducing the reduction of the oxidized layer on Rh nanoparticles and enhancing the interaction between Rh and TiO2. These findings not only indicate that thermo-photo coupling could achieve highly efficient hydrogen production via water splitting, but also, more importantly, highlight the synergetic roles of energies which might greatly promote a variety of chemical processes."
