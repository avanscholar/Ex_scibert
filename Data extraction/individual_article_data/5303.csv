0,Introduction,"Methanol is an important and increasingly in demand chemical feedstock in the bulk and fine chemical industries. Some researchers regard methanol as a candidate material in addressing the problem of oil depletion in the future [1]. It can be used as an essential intermediate for the production of formaldehyde, dimethyl terephthalate, methyl methacrylate, and acetic acid. Well-known catalytic processes such as methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) and methanol-to-olefin (MTO) can convert methanol to valuable fuels and chemicals [2–5]. For these reasons, cost-effective methanol production has become one of the hottest issues in the field of catalytic process since the development of the commercial catalytic process for producing methanol [6]. Currently, methanol is primarily produced from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen via the commercial catalytic process, which was first developed by ICI Co. Ltd in 1966. Reaction pathway for producing methanol is a CO hydrogenation reaction (see Eq. (1)) over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under a relatively high reaction temperature and pressure (523–553K and 60–80bar, respectively) [7–9]: CO + 2 H2↔ CH3OH (g), ∆H 298 =–90.97kJ/mol It is important to note here that methanol synthesis from syngas is an exothermic reaction; therefore, the significantly high reaction temperature of the ICI process results in a thermodynamic limit in the one-pass conversion (15%–25%), and inevitably requires the recycling of unreacted syngas and a considerable cooling duty cycle. In this respect, the methanol production cost of this process will be high for some setups. This drawback has triggered intensive investigations into the catalytic process for low-temperature methanol synthesis (LTMS) [10–15]. Many studies have examined the LTMS catalytic process, starting from the first attempt by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [16]. Unfortunately, to date no economically-viable LTMS process has been commercialized despite the efforts of researchers. The primary reasons for this are that various base catalysts such as NaH, Ni(CH3COO)2 and Co(Ac)2 employed in the LTMS are easily deactivated because of catalyst poisoning by CO2 and H2O in the feed gas. In this regard, most researchers agree that the catalyst is a key technology for the commercialization of LTMS [17–21]. To overcome the catalyst deactivation problem, Tsubaki et al. proposed an alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis [22], which is the objective reaction used in this study. According to the reported reaction mechanism, CO2 and H2O in the feed gas are utilized as reaction intermediates so that the additional separation process of those chemicals, which can act as catalyst poisons, is not needed. Also, this catalytic process has a significant advantage in that it can be operated under mild conditions using alcohol both as a solvent and a reaction intermediate. Conventional Cu-based catalysts (Cu/ZnO and Cu/Zn-Al-O), initially developed by ICI Co. Ltd and generally accepted as the most efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis from syngas by numerous researchers, have been investigated for this reaction [22–24]. It is obvious that Cu-based catalysts are one of the most promising catalysts for methanol production due to the notable activity of metallic copper in CO hydrogenation. However, when considering the different reaction pathways for alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis in comparison to those of conventional LTMS, the catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in this reaction might be interpreted in a rather different light. In our previous studies [25,26], we successfully demonstrated that various preparation conditions such as pH value and aging time strongly affected the activities of Cu/ZnO catalysts prepared by a co-precipitation method in this reaction. Interestingly, acidic properties of Cu/ZnO catalysts played a key role in determining their catalytic activities in this reaction unlike Cu-based catalysts for conventional methanol synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, copper content is regarded as one of the most important factors to determine the activity of Cu-based catalysts for the conventional methanol synthesis, as copper content is closely related to the dispersion of metallic copper, which is a main active site in the methanol synthesis from syngas. This idea has triggered our present research on the effect of copper content on the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts for alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. For this purpose, Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with various copper contents (X) were prepared for this reaction. The catalytic activity was studied with a focus on both metallic copper activity and acidic property of the catalyst. The close relationship between co-precipitated precursors for Cu/ZnO catalysts and their final catalytic activity in this reaction is intensively discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with a variety of copper contents were prepared via conventional co-precipitation using copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) as metal sources. The copper content in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts was marked as X, where X represents the molar ratio of Cu/Cu+Zn in the catalysts. The copper content was varied from 0.3 to 0.7 in terms of X. Typical procedures for the preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts are as follows. Known amounts of copper nitrate and zinc nitrate were dissolved in distilled water, respectively. Both solutions were added dropwise into 600mL of distilled water. A 1.5M Na2CO3 aqueous solution was simultaneously added in order to keep the pH value of the precipitated solution at 8. Then, the aging of the resulting solution was allowed to proceed for 1h at 70°C under vigorous stirring, followed by filtering to obtain a solid product. The obtained product was washed several times with distilled water to remove sodium ions, and subsequently, dried overnight at 120°C. For the calcination, the dried sample was placed in a muffle furnace under an air flow at 350°C for 1h, followed by reduction in a mixed stream of hydrogen and nitrogen in a tubular furnace for 2h. In order to avoid the rapid oxidation of metallic copper into copper oxide via exposure to air, passivation was finally conducted under a stream of 1% oxygen diluted with argon at room temperature for 1h."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The BET surface areas of the catalysts were determined via N2 adsorption and desorption measurements conducted at −196°C using a constant-volume adsorption apparatus (BEL Japan, BELSORP-mini II). The metal contents in the samples were obtained through ICP-AES (LEEMAN ABS, Prodigy) analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained with an X'pert-Pro PAN analytical diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.54056Å). XRD patterns were recorded from 2θ =10° to 80° operated at 40kV and 40mA. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was performed using a JEOL JSM-6700F instrument in order to investigate the surface morphology and simultaneously to determine the surface composition of the sample. The copper particle size and dispersion in the catalysts were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (JEM-2100F, JEOL). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Shimadzu, DTG-60H) was also carried out in a temperature range of 30–1000°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min in a nitrogen stream. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a conventional TPD instrument (BEL Japan, BELCAT B). A known amount of the sample was charged into the quartz reactor of a conventional TPD apparatus, followed by the removal of the adsorbed organic impurities on the surface of the sample with a flow of helium at 200°C for 30min. After cooling the sample to 50°C, NH3 was adsorbed on the surface sample, and subsequently, the physisorbed NH3 was removed by evacuating the sample at 100°C for 15min. The sample was then purged under helium flow until the signal of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for confirming the desorbed NH3 was stabilized. Finally, TPD experiments were carried out from 50 to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min."
4,Reaction procedure,"2.3 Reaction procedure The catalytic tests were performed in a stainless steel autoclave reactor with an inner volume of 180mL. 50mL of ethanol and 3g of catalyst were charged in the autoclave reactor. The reactor was initially pressurized to 36bar with the feed gas (CO:CO2:H2 = 30:5:65), followed by heating the reactor to the desired reaction temperature. The reaction was carried out under vigorous stirring at 150°C and 50bar for 20h. After the reaction, the liquid products were collected for quantitative and qualitative analyses. A known amount of 2-propanol was added into the liquid products as an internal standard. The products analyses were carried out using a gas chromatograph (YL-6500, Younglin) equipped with a HP-PLOT Q column (30 m×0.53mm I.D., 40μm film thickness) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Catalytic activities were reported in terms of product selectivity and yield. The product selectivity and yield were defined as: Selectivity for A ( % ) = moles of A formed total moles of products formed × 100 Yield for A ( % ) = moles of A formed moles of CO and CO 2 supplied × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Formation of catalysts,"3.1 Formation of catalysts The co-precipitation method is generally applied to prepare Cu/ZnO catalysts to obtain a highly-dispersed copper species through three steps: precipitation, calcination, and reduction. There are many parameters affecting the successful formation of Cu/ZnO catalysts during the co-precipitation step, including composition, pH value, temperature, aging time, etc. In this respect, each step should be precisely controlled to obtain an efficient catalyst for methanol synthesis, in which metallic copper is believed to be one of the main active sites by numerous researchers. According to previous studies [27,28], the synthetic parameters during the very early stages of the preparation process for Cu/ZnO catalysts crucially affect the physicochemical properties of the precursor material and, in turn, the catalytic activity of the final catalyst. This phenomenon is termed the “chemical memory” of the system. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge of the properties of the co-precipitated precursors is believed to be very important for further understanding of the Cu/ZnO catalysts. We investigated the change in structure and copper dispersion over the course of the three steps using Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with a variety of copper contents. It is worthy to note that there are three representative crystal structures in the naturally occurring Cu/Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors, including zincian malachite ((Cu1– x Zn x )2(OH)2CO3, 0< x < 0.3), rosasite ((Cu1– x Zn x )2(OH)2CO3, 0.3< x < 0.5), and aurichalcite ((Cu1– x Zn x )5(OH)6(CO3)2, x > 0.5), depending on the copper content in the sample [28]. The existence of these three mineral structures allows Cu/ZnO catalysts prepared via a co-precipitation method to maintain a high copper dispersion in spite of rather high copper content. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the co-precipitated precursors for Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. As expected, zincian malachite was formed as a main phase in the samples with high copper content (X = 0.6 and 0.7), while aurichalcite was notably observed in the samples with relatively low copper content (X = 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3). According to the reported results [28], synthetic pure rosasite is very difficult to prepare in the laboratory due to the easy formation of a mixture of zincian malachite and aurichalcite in the same range of parameters where the copper content forms rosasite. For reference, synthesizing single phase rosasite may prove to be a significant challenge in the development of an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1, all co-precipitated precursors have well-known mineral structures of Cu/Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors, especially zincian malachite and aurichalcite. These mineral structures are expected to lead to a high copper dispersion in the corresponding Cu/ZnO catalysts. We also investigated the surface morphology of the co-precipitated precursors for Cu/ZnO catalysts, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 2 . It is known that zincian malachite and rosasite retain a rod-like structure, while aurichalcite is usually obtained exhibiting a plate-like structure. Large plate-like structures were well developed in the zinc-rich Cu/ZnO_X (X = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) samples; and short rod-like structures were primarily observed in the Cu/ZnO_X (X = 0.6 and 0.7) samples. The length of the rods in our samples is rather short compared to the needle-like zincian malachite reported in literatures [27,28]. Considering the copper content in the single phase zincian malacite ((Cu1– x Zn x )2(OH)2CO3, 0< x < 0.3), the growth of the rod in length is assumed to be limited in the co-precipitation step for the Cu/ZnO_X (X = 0.6 and 0.7) samples. What is interesting is that a few needle-like structures were found in the co-precipitated precursors for the Cu/ZnO_0.5. However, no prominent characteristic peaks for zincian malachite or rosasite were observed in the XRD patterns of Cu/ZnO_0.5 (Fig. 1). We assume that a small amount of zincian malachite or rosasite was formed in the co-precipitated precursors for the Cu/ZnO_0.5. It can be also inferred that the formation of large plates was inhibited in the copper content of the co-precipitated precursors for the Cu/ZnO_0.5, as plate-like aurichalcite can be easily found in the zinc-rich samples of Cu/Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors. In the end, the mixture of needle-like and plate-like structures in the co-precipitated precursors for the Cu/ZnO_0.5 may lead to superior catalytic activity when compared with other aurichalcite samples (Cu/ZnO_0.3 and Cu/ZnO_0.4) through the abundant exposure of surface active sites to reactants. Both calcined and reduced samples were characterized via XRD and FE-SEM analyses. Although the XRD patterns and FE-SEM images of calcined samples are not shown here, we confirmed the successful formation of the reduced Cu/ZnO_X catalysts from the XRD patterns (Fig. 3 ) and the FE-SEM image (Fig. 4 ). No severe aggregation of copper particles or morphology changes was found during the calcination to give an oxide mixture or the reduction of the CuO species. This indicates that the formation of crystalline structures in the co-precipitated precursors during the co-precipitation step is a key factor in obtaining an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst for methanol synthesis. As the main active site for methanol synthesis is believed to be metallic copper, the final particle size of the copper particles in the samples was determined via the Scherrer equation (D = Kλ/βcosθ, where K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and D denotes the mean crystallite size) using the XRD peak of Cu(111) (2θ =43.2°). The calculated results are summarized in Table 1 . Understandably, the copper crystalline size increased with increasing copper content (X) in the reduce Cu/ZnO_X samples. In particular, there is a significant difference in the size of the crystalline copper between Cu/ZnO_0.5 (13.9nm) and Cu/ZnO_0.6 (18.2nm). This may be due to the starting formation of zincian malachite in the co-precipitated precursors for Cu/ZnO_X above X = 0.6, leading to a negative effect on the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO_0.6 and Cu/ZnO_0.7. We also obtained the similar results concerning the copper particle size and dispersion in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts from TEM analyses. As shown in Fig. 5 , the copper particle showed a tendency to increase with an increase in copper content in the catalysts. As with the XRD analyses, Cu/ZnO_0.7 with the highest copper content retained relatively large copper particles, and accordingly, a poor copper dispersion. In consideration of both the copper crystalline size and the amount of copper in the samples, it is expected that an optimal copper content is required to maximize the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts in this reaction. For further confirmation of the successful formation of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts in this work, constituent metal compositions in the prepared samples were confirmed via ICP-AES and SEM-EDX analyses, and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. The determined atomic ratio of Cu/Cu+Zn was in good agreement with the designed value in all samples. These results strongly support that all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with a variety of copper content were successfully prepared in this work. The BET surface area of the samples decreased reasonably with an increase in the relative heavy copper content of the samples."
7,Catalytic activity in the methanol synthesis,"3.2 Catalytic activity in the methanol synthesis The results of the catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . Prior to discussion on the catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, we need to take a note of activities of metallic Cu and ZnO catalysts in this reaction. Both metallic Cu and ZnO catalysts hardly produce methanol in this reaction, indicating that bifunctionality of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts is required for this reaction. As expected, all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts exhibit considerable catalytic activity in terms of methanol yield due to their high dispersion of copper particles. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the catalytic activity was different depending on the copper content (X) in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, and the highest methanol yield was obtained over the Cu/ZnO_0.5 catalyst. First, we need to consider the activity of metallic copper in this reaction, as metallic copper is regarded as a main active site in the synthesis of methanol from syngas. It is generally believed that a higher copper content is favorable for methanol synthesis in this reaction; however, too much copper in the catalyst can lead to large copper particles, and accordingly, low efficiency. In this respect, Cu/ZnO_0.5 was the most suitable catalyst for producing methanol from syngas under our reaction conditions. The methanol synthesis employed in this work proceeded via alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. Unlike the conventional methanol synthesis, ethanol acts as both a solvent and a reaction intermediate in this reaction. Accordingly, ethanol esterification with activated formate species, which can easily be synthesized via metallic copper from syngas, is the rate-determining step for this reaction as reported in previous work [22]. It is generally accepted that the acid site of the catalyst can easily catalyze the ethanol esterification; therefore, the acidic properties of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts are considered important factors to determine the catalytic activity in this reaction. In order to determine the acidic properties of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, NH3-TPD measurements were carried out (Fig. 6 ). The quantified acidities of the reduced Cu/ZnO catalysts are summarized in Table 1. Prior to discussion on the NH3-TPD measurements, we confirmed the TG analysis result of the Cu/ZnO_0.5. No noticeable weight loss was observed during the thermal treatment from room temperature to 1000°C, which means that the peaks in our NH3-TPD measurements were attributed to the desorbed NH3 while elevating the sample temperature. It is assumed that ZnO contributes to the acidic properties of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. In accordance with this assumption, the acid content in the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst gradually increased with a decreasing copper content (X) which represents an increasing zinc oxide content in the samples. Many researchers agree that ZnO plays an important role in stabilizing the metallic copper to achieve high copper dispersion in the Cu/ZnO catalyst system. Unlike the Cu/ZnO catalyst employed in conventional methanol synthesis, the acidic properties of ZnO with stabilization effects should be considered in the Cu/ZnO catalyst for alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. In other words, a sufficient amount of acid sites in the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst seems to be required for the efficient production of methanol by facilitating the ethanol esterification, which is considered the rate-determining step in alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis [22]. Considering the main activity of metallic copper and the acidic property of ZnO, an optimal copper content (X) is required in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts for this reaction. In our experiments, the Cu/ZnO_0.5 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance. Catalytic stability was confirmed with the goal of investigating the feasibility of applying Cu/ZnO catalysts to a CSTR reaction system for the commercialization of alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. All Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with various copper contents (X) were recovered after the reaction, and the differences in structure and chemical composition of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were examined before and after the 20h catalytic reaction. As shown in Figs. 3 and 7 , no changes were found in the XRD patterns of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts either before or after the 20h catalytic reaction. In other words, all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts maintained the initial crystalline phase after the catalytic reaction for 20h. Furthermore, the size of the crystalline copper in all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts also remained unchanged after the reaction. ICP-AES analysis also revealed that no loss of metal components took place during the catalytic reaction. From the above results, it was confirmed that all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were stable during the catalytic reaction."
8,Reaction pathway,"3.3 Reaction pathway As mentioned above, alcohol-assisted low-temperature synthesis has a slightly different reaction pathway than that of conventional methanol synthesis. Methyl formate is well-known as one of the major by-products in conventional methanol synthesis from syngas over Cu/ZnO catalysts. However, we could not find methyl formate within detectable range in the product analysis. Therefore, it is thought that the activated formate species on the catalyst surface was rapidly converted to ethyl formate via the acid-catalyzed reaction, and successively, the methanol was easily synthesized from the hydrogenation of ethyl formate by metallic copper. Although the produced methanol reacted with activated formate to form methyl formate, the successive hydrogenation of methyl formate to methanol over Cu-based catalysts can easily proceed [29]. For this reason, we assumed that we could not detect both methyl formate and ethyl formate as by-products in this reaction. In addition, it is worthy to note that a considerable amount of methyl acetate was obtained as a by-product. It is known that Cu/ZnO can catalyze the dehydrogenation of ethanol to ethyl acetate [30]. ZnO is also a representative amphoteric oxide material, and the considerable basicity of ZnO could catalyze the transesterification of methanol and ethyl acetate, which was produced via the dehydrogenation of ethanol over Cu/ZnO catalysts, to produce methyl acetate. Accordingly, methanol as a main product and methyl acetate as a by-product were finally obtained in this reaction. Based on literature and our experimental results, a proposed reaction pathway for alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis over bifunctional Cu/ZnO catalysts is illustrated in Scheme 1 . The most notable aspect of this is the inclusion of alcohol esterification, which can be catalyzed by the acid sites of the Cu/ZnO catalysts. Given this proposed reaction pathway, it is clear that not only the activity of metallic copper but also the acidic properties of the ZnO served key roles in determining the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts in alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. In other words, both active sites of the Cu/ZnO catalysts such as metallic copper and acid sites were necessary for producing methanol from syngas via this catalytic process. Therefore, it is concluded that bifunctional Cu-based catalysts with a high copper dispersion and optimal acidic properties are efficient for this reaction. Many researchers have generally focused on the catalytic activity of Cu in the Cu-based catalysts for methanol synthesis. However, this work revealed that the properties of supports can strongly affect the catalytic activity in the alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis. Therefore, we assume that further systematic investigation on the influence of acid and base properties of supports is required for the systematic design of efficient catalysts for this reaction."
9,Conclusions,"A series of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with a variety of copper contents (X) were prepared via a co-precipitation method, and were then applied in the alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis from syngas using a batch type reactor under a reaction pressure of 50bar at a temperature of 150°C. Characterization techniques performed via XRD, FE-SEM, and ICP-AES analysis strongly support that all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were successfully prepared regardless of the copper content in the sample. It was also revealed that the formation of a crystalline structure in the co-precipitated precursors for preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts was necessary to obtain the highly-dispersed metallic copper species, which is a well-known active site for methanol synthesis from syngas. In addition to the intrinsic activity of metallic copper, the acidic property obtained from ZnO in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts served an important role in determining their catalytic activity in this reaction, because the reaction pathway for alcohol-assisted low-temperature synthesis includes an ethanol esterification, which can be catalyzed by the acid sites of the Cu/ZnO catalysts. Consequently, both active sites of the Cu/ZnO catalysts such as metallic copper and acid sites were necessary for this reaction. In this regard, the copper content strongly affected the catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO catalysts, and accordingly, an optimal copper content was required to obtain an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst for this reaction. Among the tested catalysts, the Cu/ZnO_0.5 catalyst, which retained a high copper dispersion and sufficient acid sites, showed the highest methanol yield."
