0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (HA) mainly contained ethanol, propanol and butanol, which had been enormously applied as the environmentally-friendly cleaner energy in pharmaceutical, chemical and gasoline additive in recent years [1–4]. Traditionally, HA were obtained by sugar or microorganism fermentation and hydration of alkenes. Higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from syngas (CO and H2) via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) were comprehensively concerned because of economical alternative, high efficiency [5,6]. HAS generally required at least two types of active sites involving in CO dissociation and CO insertion for carbon chain growth in FTS, where the typical catalysts mainly based on four categories as Mo-based, Fe/Co-based, Rh-based and modified Cu-based catalysts [1,2,6–8]. Among of those catalysts, molybdenum sulfides promoted by alkali metal and transition metal had been considered as one of the most promising candidates due to the excellent sulfur tolerant ability, resistant carbon-deposition and lower cost. Alkali metal loaded by physical-grinding method can suppress edge sites of MoS2 to provide favorably chemical environment for CO insertion and HA formation, which also exhibited highly synergetic effects with transition metal such as Ni [9–12]. It is well known that Ni was generally considered as the potential promoter in MoS2-based catalysts for HAS, where NiSx particles after sulfidation is favorable to dominate CO dissociation and hydrogenation [9,10,13,14]. Doped molybdenum sulfides with Ni and K can also boost the synergetic NiMoS or KNiMoS active sites by electron transfer from Ni to Mo species, and more NiMoS phase can be formed under appropriate interaction between Mo and Ni which is responsible for CO inserts and CO hydrogenation in HAS [10,11,15]. However, the poor activity and strong water gas shift were usually observed in bulk MoS2-based catalysts. Up to date, supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and carbon materials, were extensively reported to improve the dispersion of metal and catalyst stability [16–20]. Due to the intrinsically basic properties and stronger alkaline sites, MgO not only facilitated CC and CO bond coupling, but also suppressed alcohol dehydration in HAS [21–23]. Nevertheless, stronger Mo-support interactions by support-O-Mo bonds were always observed under traditional impregnation method, which could suppress the synergistic effect between Mo and additives [12,16,24]. It is also worth noting that proper distribution of MoS2 layers with high dispersion and special pore structure for support play important roles in regulating more edge active sites for the production of alcohol [11]. Hence, introduction of peculiar pore structure support is desirable to regulate support-Mo interaction and provide higher surface area, and thus enhance the performance of HAS. Recently, ordered mesoporous catalysts have attracted wide attention because of the high-dispersion active sites, fast mass transfer, and excellent thermostability [25–31]. It is worth noting that the uniform pores arrangement with appropriate pore size could favor the mass transfer, and confine aggregation of active component [28–31]. Kim et al. [28] proposed that the unique pore structure and pore distribution promoted the dispersion of Rh nanoparticles, and prevented the aggregation of Rh nanoparticles under reaction condition, which in favor of higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. Cho et al. [29] unveiled that the strong interaction between Fe2O3 and ZrO2 in ordered mesoporous FeZr bimetal oxides remarkably increased the activity and C5+ selectivity of CO hydrogenation. Bae’s group [30] investigated that the regular pores in ordered mesoporous KIT-6 successfully inhibited the polymerization of Co during the reaction and reduction process, which greatly reduces carbon deposits and improves the stability during FTS reaction. Ham et al. [31] suggested that the aggregation of Cu nanoparticles was highly suppressed because of ordered mesoporous confinement and the formation of CuAl2O4, which significantly enhanced dimethyl ether synthesis from syngas. Among vast ordered mesoporous materials, three-dimensional silica KIT-6 has been developed as hard template for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials due to its bicontinuous cubic ordered mesoporous structure with large pore diameter and straight mesoporous channels [26,29,32,33]. Notably, the nanocasting replica method is general strategy for the preparation of ordered mesoporous metal oxide by multi-step filling process, which unfortunately trigger the lower filling degree of precursor solution [26,32,34]. Solid-liquid strategy with two-step routes as solvent-free synthetic method took advantage of the lower melting point of transition metal nitrate, which can turn into liquid phase before decomposition and move into the mesoporous of hard template via capillary action [29,34]. However, compared with the mesoporous monometal oxides, the synthesis of ordered mesoporous bimetal oxides and application as support for Mo-based catalysts in HAS were still quite limited. Herein, a solvent-free solid–liquid method was proposed to fabricate the ordered mesoporous NiMg mixed metal oxides, which served as support to confine synthesis of KMoS-based catalysts for HAS. The solid–liquid method can promote the formation of the agglomerated crystals of NiMg bimetal oxides with ordered mesoporous structure, which further regulate the growth of MoS2 slabs to achieve the high-dispersion MoS2 active phase, affect the textural properties, expose more active sites, and modulate the Mo-Ni2Mg1 interaction. As a result, appropriate metal-support interaction and peculiar textural properties significantly increase the proportion of NiMoS active phase and double-layer MoS2, which renders in high HAS performance with CO conversion of 9.9% and STY of C2+ alcohol of 50.9 mg g-1h−1."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 4 g polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (P123) and 38 g 2.0 M HCl were mixed into 114 mL deionized water at 35 °C to produce homogeneous solution. Then, 5.04 g butanol was dropped into the above solution under stirring, and 12.84 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added dropwise into solution under stirring for 24 h, which was shifted into Teflon-lined autoclave to hold at 100 °C for another 24 h to obtain KIT-6 after filtrating, washing, drying, and calcining at 550 °C for 6 h [27]. Ordered mesoporous NiMg bimetal oxides were obtained by solid–liquid method. Typically, 2 g nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 0.88 g magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Ni/Mg = 2.0, mole ratio) were homogeneously mixed in a mortar. Then, the nitrates and 2.88 g KIT-6 were further mixed, and sufficiently grinded in agate mortar until the color was homogenous. After calcining at 500 °C for 5 h, removing the template with 2 M NaOH under drastically stirring, the ordered mesoporous oxides (namely as Ni2Mg1) were obtained by filtrating, washing and drying. Ordered mesoporous MoO3/Ni2Mg1 were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method with 0.31 g ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 1.0 g Ni2Mg1 support in deionized water at room temperature, and further aging for 2 h, drying at 60 °C, and calcining at 500 °C to obtain MoO3/Ni2Mg1. The K2CO3 and MoO3/Ni2Mg1 was grinded for 15 min, and calcined at 450 °C for 4 h, and the as-prepared catalysts donated as K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, where the loading content of MoO3 on Ni2Mg1 was remained at 20 wt%, and the content of K loading on MoO3/Ni2Mg1 is about 6 wt% from ICP in Table S1. For comparison, Ni2Mg1-B was synthesized without the addition of KIT-6 during the synthesis, and treated with 2 M NaOH by the same procedure as Ni2Mg1, further served as support to prepare K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B by the same strategy, while K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K were also prepared by the same process as K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O except without removing KIT-6 template by alkali etching. The effect of Na+ was investigated by using Ni2Mg1-B as support without alkali etching to obtain K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B2 which exhibited the similar HAS performance with K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The composition was unveiled by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SA-XRD) on German Bruker D8 diffractometer were used to identify the crystal structure. Raman analyses were performed on a Renishaw Raman microscope with 532 nm laser. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were analyzed on Micromeritics JW-BK222. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) were obtained by a PHI5000 Versa Probe spectrometer system with C 1 s (284.6 eV) as calibration reference. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were taken on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) under voltage of 200 kV. The slab length and stack degree were calculated by using more than 100 MoS2 slabs statistics from TEM images. The slab length variance (σlength) and the fraction of edge-Mo atoms in all Mo atoms (fm ) were obtained as follows: (1) σ l e n g t h = ∑ i = 1 t ( L i - L a v e r a g e ) 2 t (2) f m = Mo edge Mo total = ∑ i = 1 t ( 6 n i - 6 ) ∑ i = 1 t ( 3 n i 2 - 3 n i + 1 ) where Li and t are the MoS2 slab length and total slab number of MoS2, respectively. ni is the number of edge-Mo atoms on MoS2 slab, where Li equals to 6.4ni –3.2. Turnover frequency (TOF) is established for intrinsic catalytic activity as follows by supposing that MoS2 on edges sites are active sites for HA formation (C2+OH). (3) TOF ( h - 1 ) = F × Y C 2 + O H m catal × Mo edge where F means the feeding rate of CO flow (mol h−1), mcatal represents the mass of the catalyst (g), Y C 2 + O H is HA yield, and Moedge is edge-Mo amount, which can be obtained by the following equation: (4) Mo edge = M o c o n t e n t o f s a m p l e m o l × s u l f i d a t i o n d e g r e e o f M o × f m where sulfidation degree of Mo was calculated by XPS characterization. Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) was performed on Autochem II 2920 (Micromeritics Company) instrument. 200 mg sample (20–40 mesh) located into a fixed bed quartz tube reactor was swept with Ar for 30 min at 500 °C, which was then heated from 100 to 900 °C with heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under 10 %H2/90 %Ar (vol.), and the offgas was detected on a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature programmed desorption with NH3 (NH3-TPD) was detected in same equipment as H2-TPR. Typically, 200 mg sample was swept with Ar at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 100 °C, the adsorption process in 10%NH3/90%Ar (vol.) with flow of 40 mL min−1, and the desorption procedure was operated in Ar atmosphere from 100 to 800 °C with heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Temperature programmed desorption with CO2 (CO2-TPD) was carried out in the same equipment and procedure as NH3-TPD except that the adsorption process was performed in 45% CO2/55% Ar (vol.). For Temperature programmed desorption with H2 (H2-TPD), the catalyst was first reduced under 10% H2/90% Ar atmosphere at 400 °C for 2 h, and then swept by Ar and cool down to 60 °C. After stabilizing base line of TCD signal for 60 min, the temperature rise process was carried out to 800 °C with 10 °C min−1."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation 600 mg sample (100–200 mesh) and 1.8 g quartz sand were mixed and placed into the fixed bed tube reactor (11 mm, internal diameter), which were presulfurized at 400 °C with the heating rate of 15 °C min−1 for 4 h under atmospheric pressure with mixed gas of 10% H2S/90% H2 (vol.), and were donated as K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O, K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B and K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K, respectively. After purging with N2 for 40 min, the sulfided catalysts were evaluated at 350 °C with the heating rate of 15 °C min−1, 5.0 MPa, and 3000 mL gcat -1h−1 with syngas of 45% CO/45% H2 /10% N2 (vol.). Alcohols were absorbed with isopentyl alcohol in cold trap, which was analyzed on gas chromatograph (SP-6890) with the flame ionization detector (FID). The effluent gas were detected on an online gas chromatograph (SP-7890) with FID and TCD. CO conversion and carbon-based selectivity were calculated by internal normalization with experimental error of within ± 2.5% as follows: (5) X CO % = molesof CO in - m o l e s o f CO out molesof CO in × 100 % (6) Carbon s e l e c t i v i t y % = moles o f a g i v e n p r o d u c t × n u m b e r o f c a r b o n s i n p r o d u c t s moles o f CO in - m o l e s o f CO out"
5,Results and discussion,
6,"XRD, Raman spectra and N2 adsorption/desorption characterization","3.1 XRD, Raman spectra and N2 adsorption/desorption characterization SA-XRD pattern for NiMg bimetal oxides (Ni2Mg1) in Fig. 1 A displays an apparent peak around 0.8–1° and a at 1.8° demonstrating the hexagonally ordered mesoporous [33]. After introduction of Mo and K by incipient wetness impregnation method, the ordered mesoporous is retained on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, but the weak peak are disappeared. The SA-XRD patterns of KIT-6 and Ni2Mg1-B are also showed in Figure S1B. The SA-XRD pattern on KIT-6 exhibits an apparent peak at around 0.8° for (211) plane, and the shoulder peak at around 1.8° for (220) plane, indicating the well-ordered mesoporous framework with the bicontinuous cubic space group [32,33]. XRD patterns of oxidic catalysts in Figure S1A show the characteristic peaks at 37.3°, 42.1°, 61.8°, 75.4°, 79.1° for NiO, the peaks at 23.6° and 25.1° for MoO3, and the peaks at 2θ = 44.0° and 64.0° for MgO, respectively. The wide-angle XRD patterns for Ni2Mg1 and Ni2Mg1-B in Figure S1C demonstrate the similar peaks position with parallel intensity to confirm the reservation ordered mesoporous structure. For sulfided samples, all samples exhibit characteristic peaks at 20.7°, 31.1°, 37.3°, 44.5°, 49.8° for Ni3S2, and 14.6°, 33.1°, 58.5° for MoS2 in Fig. 1B. No characteristic peaks for K2CO3 are observed may be due to the low loading content and formation of KMoS or KNiMoS phase by the insertion of K between S-Mo-S layers [11,35]. The particle size (5.29 nm) of Ni3S2 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O from Scherrer equation is significantly bigger than that of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B (2.33 nm), indicating the higher degree of aggregation and larger crystalline Ni3S2 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O. Raman spectrum for oxidic samples in Fig. 2 A indicate the peaks at 323, 831 and 910 cm−1 for tetrahedrally coordinated structure of NiMoO4, the peak at 323 cm−1 for terminal MoO symmetric flexural vibration, and 831 and 910 cm−1 for terminal MoO stretching vibration, respectively [35,36,38]. The peaks at 864, 940 and 950 cm−1 are ascribed to the octahedral polymolybdate structure of NiMoO4, and among them, the peaks at around 940 and 950 cm−1 are also ascribed to terminal MoO bond stretching vibration [37–39]. The wide region at about 510 cm−1 assigns to MoOMo bond asymmetric stretching of polymolybdate [36]. Notably, the peak at ~ 940 cm−1 can only be observed on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B and K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K, which is relevant with the higher content of octahedral Mo6+ species. Raman spectra for sulfided samples in Fig. 2B display the peaks at 403 and 380 cm−1 for A 1 g and E 2 g 1 vibration of MoS2 slab, respectively. The frequency distance between A 1 g and E 2 g 1 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O is narrower than that of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B, suggesting the decreases stacking degree of MoS2 layers because of ordered mesoporous confinement [40,41]. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were illustrated in Figure S2 and Table S2 as typical characteristic of mesoporous materials with type IV isotherms on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K. Notably, K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K shows H1 hysteresis loop with uniformity pore size distribution and connectivity structure feature, and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B shows H3 hysteresis loops with loose polymer flaky particles and mesoporous structure [26,34]. The pore size of Ni2Mg1 (6.52 nm) is similar with the wall thickness of KIT-6 (5–8 nm), confirming that NiMg mixed oxides successfully fill into the mesoporous of KIT-6 [42]. Compared with support, the specific surface area and pore volume significantly decrease after loading of metal phase, but those dramatically increase in K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O (from 7.1 to 38.7 m2/g and 0.0437 to 0.0902 cm3/g, respectively) than those of K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B. Notably, the specific surface area and pore volume on Ni2Mg1-B are significantly lower than those of Ni2Mg1 and KIT-6, which can dramatically decrease dispersion active phases [27,30]. The highest specific surface area in K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K may be ascribed to the small average pore size because of without removal of KIT-6. The compositions from ICP-MS in Table S1 is approximately same as the theory, except for Mg because of the rehydration of MgO in NaOH solution under alkaline-etching process [14,43]."
7,"Reduction, acidity-alkalinity, sulfidation degree, SEM images and transmission electron microscopy characterization","3.2 Reduction, acidity-alkalinity, sulfidation degree, SEM images and transmission electron microscopy characterization The reducibility and interaction between Mo atoms and NiMg mixed oxides were unveiled by H2-TPR, as shown in Fig. 2C and Table S3. Two main peaks present on oxidic catalysts, where the low-temperature peak attributes to the reduction from Mo6+ to Mo4+ on octahedral Mo species in polymolybdate Mo7O24 6-, and the high-temperature peak assigns to the reduction from Mo6+ to Mo4+ on tetrahedral Mo oxide in coordinated MoO4 2- of NiMoO4 phase, which are assigned as the precursors of NiMoS active species in HAS reaction [11,35,15,44]. The high reduction temperature for low temperature peak on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K suggest the stronger metal-support interaction under ordered mesoporous confinement. Compared with K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, the high-temperature peak on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K shift upwards to 886 °C, which may originate from the stronger Mo-Si interaction. The area ratio of high temperature and low temperature peaks (Table S3) significantly increase on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O implying the high proportion of tetrahedral coordinated MoO4 2- or NiMoO4 species. It was generally accepted that octahedrally coordinated polymolybdate are easier to be reduced than that of tetrahedral Mo species, indicating the higher reduction and sulfidation degree on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B [46–49]. NH3-TPD presents two strong desorption peaks on oxidic catalysts in Fig. 2D. The peak at low temperature stands for the weak acidic sites, while the peak at high temperature is attributed to strong acidic sites [14]. Notably, the high-temperature peak on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B significantly shifts toward higher temperature, which may result from the stronger acidity. The peak areas of NH3-TPDin Table S3 indicate the increasing amount of strong acidic sites on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B, which facilitate for higher alcohol dehydration reaction, while the total adsorption capacity increases after ordered mesoporous confinement on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O. CO2-TPD and corresponding peaks area were shown in Figure S4A and Table S4. The distinct three peaks below 800 °C are observed, where the low temperature peak is corresponding to weak basic sites, the middle temperature peak is medium basic sites, and the high temperature peak is assigned for strong basic sites. Among those, weak basic sites is mainly ascribed to surface hydroxyl adsorption, and Mg2+–O2- are respected to medium basic sites, and strong basic sites are corresponding to surface oxygen anion [14,50]. The amount of basic sites can be related to the peak area, which remarkably increases after the introduction of ordered mesoporous structure and KIT-6 template. Notably, the area of strong basicity increases on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K because more oxygen anions O2− and defects are formed on surface of KIT-6. H2-TPD were carried out on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K in Fig. S4B. The temperature of desorption can demonstrate strength of metal–H bond, and peaks area can attribute to hydrogen adsorption ability [51,52]. The broad positive desorption peaks present where the peak area of total hydrogen desorption significantly increases on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O (0.268) in comparison of K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B (0.0737) and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K (0.166). The temperature of H2 desorption slightly decreases on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B, indicating the related weaker metal–H bond on surface of MoS2. The NiMoO4 phases can produce and accept spillover hydrogen species during reduction process which possesses the active sites to dissociate hydrogen. Higher amount of area of high temperature peak can confirm stronger spillover hydrogen ability on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O, may suggesting higher contents of NiMoO4 species [51–53]. The Mo 3d XPS spectra of sulfided samples were exhibited in Fig. 3 A-C. The Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+ are located in binding energy of around 229.1 eV for MoS2, 230.5 eV for MoOxSy, and 232.8 eV for MoO3 with S 2 s satellite peak at 225 eV [11,54,55]. The sulfidation degree was generally defined as the proportion of Mo4+ to total of Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+,[35,45] as shown in Table 1 , where the sulfidation degree on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B (64.3%) is higher than those of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (51.1%) and K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K (60.8%), suggesting that the ordered mesoporous confinement decreases the sulfidation degree due to the increasing Mo-Ni2Mg1 interaction. Ni 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 3D-F suggest that Ni3S2 species, NiMoS active phase and NiO phase are assigned in binding energies of the peaks at around 853.5, 855.1 and 856.1 eV,[11,56–58] respectively. The relative proportion of surface NiMoS phase are obtained according to the proportion of the each peak vs. sum of peak area the peak area [11,51,58]. Shen et al. [15] reported that the coordinated unsaturated Ni atoms in Ni3S2 were similar with the Ni species in NiMoS structure, and Mo can accept electrons from the outermost layer of Ni atom by Ni-Mo interaction. The proportion of NiMoS phase on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (49.6%) is significantly higher than those of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B (40.8%) and K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K (40.7%) because of the facile electron transfer from Ni to Mo species under the stronger Mo-Ni2Mg1 interaction on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O [11,59]. The SEM images of oxidic and pretreated catalysts are exhibited in Figure S5, where the morphology of all samples exhibits spherical particle [34]. The representative TEM image of Ni2Mg1 suggest that the Ni2Mg1 shows the ordered mesopore on [100] direction in Fig. 4 A, and the wall thicknesses is approximately 5.5 nm, which is in agreement with the small-angle XRD and N2 adsorption/desorption characterization. The representative TEM images on sulfided catalysts present the interlamellar distance of 0.63 nm of MoS2 (002) basal planes [11,13,60]. The length variance (L average), average stacking layers number (N average) and average length (L average) were obtained according to more than 60 typical graphs by statistical analysis. Fig. 4E-F and Table 1 show the concentrated distribution of MoS2 with slab length of 6–8 nm and layer number of 2–4 layers on sulfided catalysts. The proportion of double-layer MoS2 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O is ~32%, which can expose both rim and edge active sites. Rim-Edge model suggested that alcohols formation occurs on edge sites while hydrocarbon are mainly obtained at rim sites [60–62]. It is worth noting that with the increase layers of molybdenum sulfide, the proportion of edge sites will gradually decrease, and excessive layer number is not conducive to the synthesis of alcohol [11]. The significant decrease on statistical N average and L average of MoS2 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (6.09 and 3.26 nm) indicate that ordered mesoporous can confine the growth of MoS2 slabs to achieve low degree of stacking MoS2, smaller size, and the high proportion of edge sites of Mo species on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (17.5%). The STEM element mapping demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of Ni and Mg species on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (Fig. S3)."
8,"Internal diffusion effects, mass-transfer coefficient, and CO hydrogenation performance","3.3 Internal diffusion effects, mass-transfer coefficient, and CO hydrogenation performance The effect of internal diffusion and ability of mass-transfer for three samples were investigated by Frossling correlation and Weisz-Prater criterion (CWP) in Supporting information. The internal diffusion effect can be judged by CWP data, which is summarized in Table S5. If CWP ≪1, the effects of the internal diffusion can be neglected. The values of CWP of 3.2 × 10-6, 4.4 × 10-5, and 9.1 × 10-6 are much less than 1, suggesting that internal diffusion is ignorable on as-prepared catalysts. The effective diffusion coefficient (De) and mass-transfer coefficient (k C) were also computed as Table S5, which show the order as K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O > K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-K > K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-B, indicating the excellent diffusivities by ordered mesoporous confinement. The HAS performance of CO hydrogenation were illustrated in Fig. 5 . The CO conversion of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O is 1.5 times higher than that of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B, suggesting the strong CO hydrogenation performance on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O. The lower CO conversion is observed in K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K due to the blocked pore, which originates from the high filling degree by NiMg mixed oxides. The selectivity of total alcohols in K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O (56.1%) is higher than others, indicating that ordered mesoporous confined KMoS catalyst can improve HA selectivity. The distribution of alcohols shows that ethanol and propanol are the dominant products on as-prepared catalysts. Notably, K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O exhibits significantly higher STY for C2+OH of 50.9 mg g-1h−1 than those of K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-B (33.1 mg g-1h−1) and K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-K (17.5 mg g-1h−1). The HAS performance were summarized in Table S6, which is comparable with those of most recently reported MoS2-based catalysts, illustrating the remarkable HAS performance. The GC graph of gas products and liquid phase products in absorption liquid were showed in Fig. S6 and the distinct production peaks are observed. Fig. S7 shows the deviation of alcohol products from Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution because MgO and K2CO3 in as-prepared catalysts may inhibit the alcohols dehydration and promote oxygenate coupling reaction as an typical mechanism for HAS [13]. Consistent with the CO conversion and higher alcohol selectivity, the TOF values of all catalysts were shown in Table 1, and K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O has the highest TOF value, indicating that ordered mesoporous confined KMoS catalyst can promote the formation of C2+OH. The stability is also investigated in Fig. S8, where CO conversion and total alcohols selectivity are stable around 10% and 55% after 100 h, and the selectivity of CO2 increases to around 30% owing to WGS reaction, suggesting excellent stability on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O."
9,"Structure-performance relationship on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O catalyst in HAS.","3.4 Structure-performance relationship on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O catalyst in HAS. The ordered mesoporous NiMg mixed oxides confined KMoS catalyst by solid–liquid method shows distinguished effect in HAS. The possible mechanism and schematic illustration in HAS on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O catalyst was shown in Fig. 6 . MgO exhibits intrinsically basic properties to facilitate the coupling of C–C and C-O band on basic sites, and suppresses higher alcohol dehydration activity [14,15,63,64]. According to our previous work,[11,14] highly dispersed NiSx phase endows the strong ability of dissociative CO adsorption to produce hydrocarbon. Ni3S2 with large particle size and high aggregated degree shows lower concentration of active sites for the production of hydrocarbon onthebasisof Li’s results [13]. Notably, ordered mesoporous confined KMoS catalyst with the higher crystalline and aggregated Ni species by solid–liquid route significantly improves alcohol selectivity. The confinement effects of MoS2 are confirmed by the decreasing size and stack degree of MoS2 slabs from statistical calculation on TEM images. The narrow frequency distance from Raman characterization between A 1 g and E 2 g 1 on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O further suggests the decreases stacking degree of MoS2 layers after the introduction of ordered mesopore [40,41]. Thus, the combination of TEM images and Raman characterization verify the decreasing slab length and stacking degree of MoS2 slabs, which should be ascribed to the confinement effect of MoS2 by the introduction of the ordered mesopore. The stronger interaction of Mo-Ni2Mg1 may facilitate electron transfer between Mo and Ni from TPR and XPS characterization, which also gives higher proportion of NiMoS species for chain growth and CO insertion in HAS [15]. The alkali K element is generally supposed to regulate MoS2 edge sites, to form potassium-containing phases like KMoS and KNiMoS [1,65]. Our previews work demonstrate that appropriate content of K enhances higher alcohols selectivity, but excess K can form K2SO4 phases, which covered on MoS2 active sites and suppressing CO hydrogenation [66,67]. Beyond those, K can decrease the concentration of strong acidic sites to suppress dehydration reaction of alcohols, which can enhance selectivity of higher alcohols. N2 adsorption/desorption and TEM reveals larger specific surface area, pore volume, high-dispersion MoS2 and edge-Mo sites on K,Mo/Ni2Mg1-O. HRTEM characterization also unveils the average stacking degree with narrower distribution, higher dispersion degree of MoS2, and dominant double-layer MoS2 slabs (~32%) on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O, indicating that ordered mesoporous Ni2Mg1 can confine crystal growth of MoS2 to remarkably increase the proportion of edge sites and expose more Mo active species [13,60,63]. Taborga and Luan et al. [11,60,61] proposed that the total alcohols selectivity was enhanced with increasing fraction of double-layer MoS2 due to the exposure of more edge sites, which plays a significant role for high HA selectivity according to the Rim-Edge model. The combination of higher proportion of NiMoS active sites, higher fraction of Mo edge sites, higher specific surface area and pore volume, higher dispersion of MoS2 phase and higher ratio of double stacking MoS2 slab shows highly synergetic effects on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O, which plays dominant roles in improving CO hydrogenation and HA selectivity (Fig. 7 )."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, ordered mesoporous NiMg bimetal oxides confined KMoS catalysts were synthesized by combination of solid–liquid method and incipient wetness impregnating method. Ordered mesoporous Ni2Mg1 confinement can modulate Mo-support interactions and MoS2 slabs sizes, which enhances synergism between Ni2Mg1 and Mo to form higher proportion of NiMoS active sites for HAS. As the result, higher proportion of NiMoS active phase (49.6%) and dominant double-layers MoS2 (~32%) are achieved on K,MoS/Ni2Mg1-O, which dramatically improves the HAS performance with total alcohol selectivity (56.1%), CO conversion (9.9%), TOF (11.3 h−1) and STY (50.9 mg g-1h−1) of C2+OH."
