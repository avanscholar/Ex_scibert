0,Introduction,"As a most common type of fuel, coal is an important resource in meeting our demand for energy, contributing to about 70% of total electricity generation in Australia and 40% worldwide (Saunders, 2015). However, direct combustion of thermal coals may cause environmental issues due to emission of toxic gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, heavy metals such as mercury, and particulates. A possible strategy of mitigation is to transform coal to a cleaner form of fuel as a way of balancing the energy need and environmental stress. Natural gas (mainly methane) from coal seams is such a type of coal derivative that offers high calorific value and is clean upon burning as it releases only water and carbon dioxide, with lower emission of the latter than for equivalent energy from burning coal and petroleum. Microbially-enhanced production of secondary natural gas (mainly methane) from coal has gathered tremendous interest in the past decades, and has been shown to be a primary source of coalbed methane from Walloon coals in Surat Basin, Queensland (Draper and Boreham, 2006; Hamilton et al., 2014). Numerous studies have proved the feasibility of the process through laboratory enhancement, such as nutrient stimulation, and microbial augmentation (through addition of inocula) on crushed coals with higher physical accessibility (Chen et al., 2017; Colosimo et al., 2016; Fallgren et al., 2013a; Fallgren et al., 2013b; Green et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2008; Papendick et al., 2011; Park and Liang, 2016; Ritter et al., 2015; Robbins et al., 2016; Susilawati et al., 2013). However, the majority of methane yields reported in the research area are low, ranging from <5 μmol/g (Fallgren et al., 2013a; Formolo et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008) up to about 140 μmol/g (equivalent to 3.43 m3/t, Green et al., 2008). In most experiments, methane production plateaued within 1 year with a final conversion (of coal to methane) below 1%. This elicits the needs for a potential pretreatment method that could effectively increase coal bioavailability to make the process more commercially viable. A typical strategy is to use chemicals that react with coal, breaking down cross-linked structures, converting large molecules to smaller fragments, and modifying functional groups in a way that increases bioavailability. Oxidizing agents such as nitric acid, potassium permanganate, chromic acid, and hydrogen peroxide have been commonly used for this purpose (Hayatsu et al., 1981; Huang et al., 2013a; Huang et al., 2013b; Jones et al., 2013) They are capable of introducing heteroatoms to coal hydrocarbon, forming activation sites that lower the bond dissociation energy of neighboring chemical bonds, thereby facilitating microbial cleavage (Oyeyemi et al., 2015; Oyeyemi et al., 2014a; Oyeyemi et al., 2014b). Low rank coals treated with H2O2 show increased content of water-soluble matter, particularly low-molecular-weight fatty acids and alcohols (Mae et al., 2001; Miura et al., 1996; Pietrzak and Wachowska, 2003; Yu et al., 2014). Similar compounds have also been reported in potassium permanganate oxidized lignites, such as C4 – C18 branched and unbranched carboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid, and tricarboxylic acid (Hayatsu et al., 1981), which have demonstrated high bioavailability to methanogenic consortia (Chen et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2010; Orem et al., 2010). The benefit of chemical oxidation on coal bioavailability has also been directly evidenced by Huang et al. (2013a), Huang et al. (2013b), and Jones et al. (2013), who observed significant increase in biogas production after oxidation. A common challenge with chemical pretreatment is, however, the need to condition the pretreatment product in order to make it amenable to anaerobes. This includes removal of residual oxidants, adjustment of pH and salinity, and detoxification of foreign ions such as Mn2+ if potassium permanganate is used (Altug and Balkis, 2009; Cheung et al., 1982; Gadd and Griffiths, 1977), resulting in extra cost and complexity in terms of application. On this ground, hydrogen peroxide is deemed to be a more suitable reagent since it has mild effect on pH and salinity without introducing foreign chemical species (except for the hydroxyl free radical, which is reacted away). Reaction with hydrogen peroxide takes place in two steps, starting with formation of hydroxyl free radicals in a UV-catalyzed chain reaction, followed by interaction between the radicals and coal moieties. The reduction potential (E 0 ) of hydroxyl free radical is 2.02 V, higher than that of permanganate 1.507 V (when converted to Mn2+) and nitrate 0.957 V (when converted to NO) (Haynes, 2017), suggesting a strong capacity of the oxidant. Application of chemical pretreatment is, however, only feasible for an ex-situ process as injection of oxidants underground may contaminate local aquifers, and pose safety hazards when oxidants interact with combustible gases in coal seam. It is also hard to implement a stable supply of UV light deep underground if H2O2 is used. For an ex-situ process, coal beneficiation waste or surface coal may be used as a source of substrate having low or zero mining cost. Zheng et al. (2017) reported a compatible level of biomethane production from a Jameson Cell reject with that of raw coals, confirming the biomethane potential of coal wastes. Although earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility of improving coal bioavailability by H2O2 oxidation (Huang et al., 2013a; Jones et al., 2013), knowledge on how the treatment alters coal composition, especially within the hydrophobic fraction, and how the oxidation products contribute to bioavailability is still preliminary and lacking. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of coal compounds formed after hydrogen peroxide oxidation and their biodegradability when being used as substrates for methanogenesis. The study engages the following objectives: 1) investigate the effect of peroxide oxidation on biomethane yield; 2) characterize the change in composition of coal solvent-extractable matter upon oxidation; 3) characterize the bioavailability of oxidation products; and 4) investigate the effect of coal rank on the amenability to H2O2 oxidation and biodegradation."
1,Method,
2,Sample information,"2.1 Sample information Two coal samples of different ranks were investigated in this study. The subbituminous Walloon coal: PEN9-003 was a coal core sample collected from the Juandah Coal Measure in the central-north Surat Basin, Queensland, a spot with active microbial production of coalbed methane (Draper and Boreham, 2006; Hamilton et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2014). Previous studies have found the coal has a vitrinite reflectance Rr% = 0.45, and is rich in liptinite (32.7% by volume on as-received basis, a.r.) and perhydrous vitrinite (48.8% vol. a.r.), a characteristic of high bioavailability (Chen et al., 2017). The remainder of the coal is composed of 16.2% vol. (a.r.) mineral matter and 2.4% vol. (a.r.) inertinite. The higher rank bituminous coal was taken from the Carborough Downs underground mine (abbreviated as C.D.), Rangal Coal Measures, Bowen Basin, Queensland. The sample is richer in vitrinite (55.2% vol. a.r.) and inertinite (39.6% vol. a.r.) but has a low liptinite content (4% vol. a.r.) and little mineral matter (1.2% vol. a.r.). The vitrinite reflectance of the C.D. coal is Rr% = 1.13%. After being transported to the laboratory, the coals were crushed anoxically in an anaerobic chamber into fine grains. Experiments in this study were carried out on the size portion that passed 300 μm sieve. To prepare samples for coal characterization, the coal powder was passed through a metal splitter that evenly divides the material into two subsets of homogeneous composition. The same process was repeated on one subset (randomly chosen) from each generation until roughly 20 g of sample was achieved. The samples were then sealed in a bag and sent to the ALS Laboratory, Brisbane, Australia for proximate and ultimate analysis (Table 2), following Australian Standards AS 1038.3 (for proximate composition, StandardsAustralia, 2000), AS 1038.6.4 (for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, StandardsAustralia, 2005)) and AS 1038.6.3.3 (for total sulfur, StandardsAustralia, 1997)."
3,Coal oxidation,"2.2 Coal oxidation Hydrogen peroxide has been chosen as the pretreatment reagent for the reasons that 1) it is potent oxidant and can form free radicals in the presence of UV light; 2) it does not introduce foreign ions that might be inhibitory to microorganisms; and 3) it has minor effect on the salinity and pH of culture solution. The standard concentration of H2O2 used was calculated assuming complete conversion from coal to acetate. To do so, the formula of the organic part of coal was firstly approximated using the elemental composition shown in Table 2. This gives a formula for PEN9-003: CH0.973O0.139N0.013S0.00213, and that for C.D.: CH0.664O0.0552N0.0153S0.0019. Since the contribution of N and S is relatively insignificant compared to the rest, the formula can be further simplified to: 1) PEN9-003: CH0.973O0.139 2) C.D.: CH0.664O0.0552 A chemical equation can then be written for the two samples, respectively: (1) PEN : CH 0.973 O 0.139 + 0.3475 H 2 O 2 + 0.166 H 2 O → 0.5 CH 3 COOH (2) C . D . : CH 0.664 O 0.0552 + 0.2768 H 2 O 2 + 0.3912 H 2 O → 0.5 CH 3 COOH For conversion of 1 g coal to acetate, the amount (mol) of hydrogen peroxide required is: n H 2 O 2 = 1 − ash % g MW coal g / mol × Stoichemitry H 2 O 2 Stoichiometry coal , where n stands for molar mass and MW stands for molecular weight. Oxidation experiments were conducted with three dosages of H2O2: 50%, 100%, and 200% of the above calculated theoretical standard across 4 treatment periods: 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, and 30 days. To set up, 2 g of PEN9-003 coal powder (<300 μm) was soaked in a 37 mL serum bottle containing 10% hydrogen peroxide solution (prepared from 30% stock, perhydrol®, EMSURE® ISO grade) of corresponding dosages given in Table 1 (note dosage was calculated with respects to coal not solution). All samples were set up in triplicates and pre-autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min (with only coal and water) before the H2O2 solution was added. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, which were penetrated by a needle to avoid overpressure as oxygen is released upon reacting the hydroxyl radical with water. The mini reactors were placed under a mercury vapor lamp (HPL high pressure mercury vapor standard 50 watts, Philips) that provides a constant source of UV. After the designated period of treatment, the slurries were centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 10 mins. Liquid samples were collected and diluted with Milli-Q water to 10 mL (to make volumes of liquid samples consistent for all groups), while solids were dried in an oven at 37 °C for 48 h. Triplicates of no-oxidant control with only coals and Milli-Q water were also included to highlight the net effect of oxidation. The controls were autoclaved under the same condition and placed overnight at room temperature to allow mass transfer before being prepared for water chemistry analysis (Section 2.4) and bioassays (Section 2.3). Table 1 summarizes the dosage of H2O2 in pretreatment assays added with different concentrations of H2O2."
4,Bioassay setup,"2.3 Bioassay setup Coal bioassay was conducted on the solid and liquid phases of the pretreatment reactors separately in order to study the relative contribution of the two phases to bioavailability after oxidation. Bioassays were set up in an anaerobic chamber inflated with nitrogen. Adapted Tanner media (Tanner, 2007) was used as a source of non‑carbon nutrients (containing minerals, trace metals, vitamins, NaHCO3 buffer, and Na2S·9H2O as anti-oxidant) and anaerobic digester sludge from domestic wastewater treatment plants (sourced from Luggage Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, Brisbane, Australia) was used as the inocula after a period of pre-incubation to exhaust the native carbon. The reason for using digester sludge is that it accommodates a robust microbial community with a large variety of species. Each bioassay was fed with either 0.25 g of pretreated coal powder (size range < 300 μm) or 1 mL of pretreated liquid in a 37 mL serum bottle together with 9 mL (8 mL for the liquid feed) growth media and 1 mL inocula. Parallel bioassays were set up in the same way for the ‘no oxidant’ control. The bottle was sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and crimped with an aluminum cap to keep it gas-tight. The headspace was vacuumed and refilled with nitrogen to a slight over pressure to prevent intrusion of air. Bioassays were established in quadruplicate for each coal sample along with quadruplicate of negative controls with no carbon substrates, and triplicate of desorption controls with only media and coal. The presence of control cultures allows determination of net microbial production of methane from bioassays."
5,Water chemistry analysis,"2.4 Water chemistry analysis Volatile short-chain fatty acids and alcohols (referred to VFA-As hereafter) are readily degradable compounds that can be produced from oxidation of coal hydrocarbons. To quantify VFA-As in the pretreated coals, 0.4 mL of filtered water samples (filtered with Millex GP, 0.22 μm micro-filter) was mixed in a glass vial with 0.32 mL Milli-Q water and 0.08 mL 10% formic acid solution containing an analytical standard of C2 to C6 compounds, including acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, hexanoic acid ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. The mixture was sent to the Advanced Water Management Centre (within the University of Queensland) for analysis using an Agilent 7890A GC with a flame ionization detector (FID). Also measured in parallel, was the concentration of total soluble organic carbon (TOC). There are two sources of water samples tested: liquid phase from H2O2 pretreatment, and water eluents of the H2O2 pretreated dried coal powder. The latter one aims to quantify the residual water soluble compounds and their contribution to the bioavailability in the oxidized coal powder. A blank with Milli-Q water was analyzed in parallel to set up the background level. Generation of the liquid samples is illustrated in Fig. 1 below. To characterize the biodegradation of water-soluble compounds, the contents of VFA-As and soluble TOC in bioassay residues were also measured."
6,Coal extraction,"2.5 Coal extraction Solvent extraction of coal was carried out in a Tecator Soxtec system HT2 1045, a method adapted from Soxhlet with improved efficiency (Membrado Giner et al., 1996). Extraction used a mixture of AR grade dichloromethane and HPLC grade of methanol (2:1 by volume) in order to efficiently recover both polar and non-polar compounds. For each round, 1 g of coal powder was extracted with 30 mL of mixed solvent in a two-stage process composed of 1 h boiling and 1 h rinsing (see Chen et al., 2017 for details). The resulting extract was dried under a general stream of N2 and re-dissolved in 5 mL of the same solvent for GC–MS analysis. For characterizing the effect of oxidation on composition and bioavailability of extractable matter, extracts of no-oxidant control (fraction C, Fig. 1), oxidized coal (fraction A, Fig. 1), and microbially digested residue were analyzed and compared. The wet coal samples (pretreatment assays and bioassays) were prepared by centrifuging at 3750 rpm for 10 min, followed by drying of the bottom pellet at 37 °C for 48 h prior to extraction."
7,GC–MS analysis of solvent extract,"2.6 GC–MS analysis of solvent extract Identification of compounds in organic solvent extracts was carried out in a Shimadzu GC–MS-QP2010 equipped with a CTC PAL autosampler and a Restex Rxi-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mmID × 1.0 μm d.f. (film thickness) column. For each analysis, 1 μL of sample was injected in splitless mode at an injector temperature of 250 °C, and was transported by 1.34 mL/min flow of helium gas through the column. The column temperature was programmed as 1) initially at 80 °C, hold for 4.7 min; and 2) increase to 300 °C at 8 °C/min and hold for 15 min. Mass scan started after 4.5 min of solvent delay and was run in full scan mode over m/z (mass/charge) range of 35 to 800 D. The ion source was operated at 200 °C with an interface temperature of 250 °C. All data were recorded and processed through LabSolutions GCMSsolution Version 4.20 (Shimadzu Corporation). Compound identification combined an initial automatic similarity match against the internal mass spectral databases, and a further manual verification of each peak and comparison against the NIST MS Search 2.0 database. For the significance of results, only compounds with match quality >60% were reported. Diagnostic fragments were also employed to assist the interpretation of n-alkanes (m/z = 57, 85) (Brassell et al., 1980), acyclic isoprenoids (m/z = 57, 183) (Petrov et al., 1990), and PAHs (individual M+ ) (Brassell et al., 1980). To reliably report waxy compounds with similar fragmentation patterns in MS, a commercial standard of n-alkanes of C10 to C30 was used to set up a retention time index for this group of compounds. Solvent blanks were run in parallel to account for impurities in the background. Phthalates (m/z = 149), a common plasticiser contaminant, were found in all samples, and were disregarded in data analysis. Concentrations of identified compounds were approximated by areas under peaks (intensity units, on absolute scale). Error of measurement was found to be generally within 10% by analyzing a single sample (solvent extract of the raw PEN9–003 coal) three times."
8,Methane measurement,"2.7 Methane measurement Methane concentration in the headspace of bioassays was measured by a Varian 3900 gas chromatograph equipped with an FID detector and an RT-Q-BOND column. The set temperatures for the injector, column and detector were 105 °C, 50 °C and 200 °C, respectively. A constant flow of 4 mL/min helium gas was used as a carrier, facilitating the flow of sample to the detector. For each injection, a 100 μL gas sample was drawn from the headspace of the microcosm, using an aseptic 100 μL syringe equipped with stainless steel needle and a shut-off valve. The sample was then injected into the GC with a split ratio of 5. Calibration was performed using 1% and 15% (by volume) methane standard gas (balanced with CO2) before and after each set of measurements to ensure accuracy of results. Methane concentration was monitored roughly twice a week to keep track of production."
9,Results,
10,Proximate and elemental composition of coals,"3.1 Proximate and elemental composition of coals The proximate and elemental composition of the two samples are shown in Table 2 . The subbituminous PEN9-003 coal is marked by elevated contents of volatile matter (42.2 wt% a.d.) and elemental hydrogen (6.3 wt%, d.a.f.), suggesting a likely abundance of solvent-extractable matter and aliphatic moieties. Due to a higher rank, the bituminous C.D. coal shows a significantly richer fixed carbon content (64.6 wt% a.d.). Ultimate analysis revealed a considerably lower hydrogen to carbon ratio (0.664 by molar, in contrast to 0.973 in PEN9-003) and elemental oxygen (less than half of PEN9-003), indicating a likely more homogenized coal structure."
11,Bioassay results,"3.2 Bioassay results Oxidation of PEN9-003 coal with H2O2 solution has increased methane production from both solid (fraction A, Fig. 1) and liquid (fraction B, Fig. 1) phases of the pretreatment products (Fig. 2 ). The highest methane yield (combining liquid and solid) is found to be 234 μmol/g, which is about 10 times that of the control. Bioavailability of the aqueous phase (fraction B, Fig. 1) showed a greater response than the solid (fraction A, Fig. 1) upon oxidation. Methane yield from the pretreated liquid increased by a maximum 13.1 times (in contrast to 6.72 fold in solid part) with reference to the control (Fig. 2). Contribution of the aqueous phase to overall methane production exhibits a degree of dominance in the group with low H2O2 dosage (50%), and is lessened in those of higher H2O2 dosage. The dosage of hydrogen peroxide in general, has a more significant effect on coal bioavailability than treatment length. Methane yield is found to increase evidently with strength of peroxide, whereas only the group with high H2O2 dosage (200%) shows continuous benefit of pretreatment length on methane production. In comparison, bioassays on the higher rank C.D. coal (both control and oxidized) produced only minimal methane, which yield decreases slightly with concentration of oxidant and treatment length (Fig. 3 ). This implies the coal is inherently low in bioavailability, and is rather resistant to oxidation under relatively mild conditions."
12,Water chemistry analysis,"3.3 Water chemistry analysis Volatile fatty acids and alcohols (VFA-As) detected in the liquid phase of PEN9-003 coal oxidation product are predominantly acetic acid with traces of other C3 to C6 branched and unbranched homologs. Concentration of acetate increases exponentially with strength of hydrogen peroxide, but much more slowly with treatment length after day 4 (shown in Fig. 4 ), a trend similar to that of the methane yield (in section 3.2). The highest acetate concentration is 4.86 mg/g (combining pretreated liquid sample and water eluents of solid) achieved in the group treated with a 200% standard dosage of H2O2 for a period of 30 days. This is 22 times that of the control (0.218 mg/g). Among the other VFA-As detected, propionic acid occurs at a relatively high concentration (maximum 0.12 mg/g achieved in sample treated with 200% standard dosage of H2O2 for 4 days), which is about 5 times that of valeric acid, and 10 times that of the remaining species (butyric acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid and hexanoic acid). Concentration of these compounds generally increases with the strength of oxidant and peaks at treatment length of 4 days, after which a slight decrease is observed. The amount of valeric acid was reduced by the largest extent, with concentration at day 7 being a quarter of that at day 4, suggesting further oxidation of the compound. Ethanol was only detected in the no-oxidant control to the concentration of 0.191 mg/g coal. VFA-As have been reported to be readily convertible to methane in bioassays (Chen et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017; Robbins et al., 2016). To account for the maximum possible contribution of VFA-As to the observed methane yield, VFA-As-equivalent methane was calculated assuming complete conversion by the following reactions (Eqs. (3)–(8)): (3) Acetic acid : CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 (4) Propionic acid : CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 1 / 2H 2 O → 7 / 4CH 4 + 5 / 4CO 2 (5) Butyric acid / isobutyric acid : CH 3 CH 2 2 COOH + H 2 O → 5 / 2CH 4 + 3 / 2CO 2 (6) Valeric acid / isovaleric acid : CH 3 CH 2 3 COOH + 3 / 2H 2 O → 13 / 4CH 4 + 7 / 4CO 2 (7) Hexanoic acid : CH 3 CH 2 4 COOH + 2H 2 O → 4CH 4 + 2CO 2 (8) Ethanol : CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 / 4H 2 O → 9 / 8CH 4 + 7 / 8CO 2 Fig. 4 compares the actual methane observed with VFA-As-equivalent methane, and found that VFA-As are in general responsible for <50% of methane being produced. This indicates the presence of a significant amount of other bioavailable hydrocarbons in coal. Bioavailability of pretreated liquid product is more dependent on VFA-As than that of solid. Contribution of VFA-As to methane yield generally increases with H2O2 dosage level, but increases and decreases with treatment length, inflecting around day 7. This suggests a longer treatment favors net formation of non-VFA-As bioavailable compounds. Concentration of VFA-As in the bioassay residues were below detection limit in all groups, indicating complete conversion by microorganisms. The overall enhancement in aqueous solubility of coal can be evaluated by measuring the total soluble organic carbon (TOC) in pretreatment products (shown in Fig. 5 ). Concentration of TOC appears to increase exponentially with strength of hydrogen peroxide, maximizing at 26.2 mg/g (achieved at day 30 in the sample treated with 200% standard dosage of H2O2). TOC content is found to surge at day 4 in all of the three H2O2 dosage groups, followed by a slow increase towards day 30. This indicates reasonably fast kinetics in formation of aqueous oxidation products after an initial short period of lag phase. When converting VFA-As to the equivalent organic carbon, only a small percentage (average 13 ± 5%) of TOC are derived from VFA-As. This proves the dominance of non-VFA compounds in the aqueous phase, a finding consistent with Fig. 4. Furthermore, the proportion of VFA-As in soluble organic carbon decreases with an increase in the concentration of H2O2 and pretreatment length (Fig. 5). This seems to suggest a tendency of strong and sustained peroxide exposure towards formation of non-VFA-As compounds, which continued at later stage of oxidation even when production of VFA-As reached equilibrium. Content of dissolved TOC in bioassay residues turned out to be essentially zero (indiscernible to the bioassay negative control), indicating complete consumption by the microorganisms. However, the fact that non-VFA compounds have a higher proportion in soluble TOC (Fig. 5) than their contribution to methane yield (Fig. 4) implies that not all water-soluble carbon degraded has been converted to methane. No significant change in VFA-As and TOC contents has been observed with the higher rank C.D. coal upon H2O2 treatment. The TOC readings are consistently low, and are << 0.01 mg/g in all measurements. Concentrations of TOC in the liquid phase of the no-oxidant control is 0.000896 mg/g, which is compatible to that in the final oxidized sample (200% standard dosage, 30 days): 0.00141 mg/g. Concentration of acetic acid in the two liquid samples above are 0.0004 and 0.000016 mg/g respectively. Neither TOC nor VFA-As was detectable in water eluents of the solid phase of pretreated C.D. coal."
13,GC–MS identification of solvent-extractable matter,"3.4 GC–MS identification of solvent-extractable matter 3.4.1 Organic compound distribution in solvent extractable matter Distribution of compounds in organic solvent extracts of PEN9-003 and C.D. coal (no-oxidant controls, Fig. 1, fraction C), as well as notes to compound group classification are shown in Fig. 6 and its caption. An example GC–MS total ion current (TIC) chromatograph of the PEN9-003 no-oxidant control is given in supplementary figures (Fig. S1). PEN9-003 coal is generally dominated by aliphatic compounds that account for 63% of total peak intensity (Fig. 6A), a result consistent with that in Chen et al. (2017). Polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons (23.4%), and acyclic alkanes (21.7%) are the most abundant compound groups, followed by aliphatic esters (9.8%), aliphatic alcohols (4.6%), aliphatic ketones (1.50%), aliphatic amine (1.20%) and traces of aliphatic carboxylic acids (0.6%) and monocyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons (0.1%). Particularly, the group polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons contains mainly 2–4 fused six-membered ring units, of which 27% (based on intensity) has heterogeneous functional moieties (i.e. carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups); acyclic alkanes are predominantly n-alkanes, ranging from C13 to C30 with an abundance in the longer chain homologs (i.e. C25 to C29); aliphatic esters, ranging from C12 to C28, are dominated by members with carboxylic acid backbone, esterified with methanol or ethanol; and aliphatic alcohols, ranging from C8 to C26, are composed primarily of n-alcohols with odd carbon numbers (i.e. C15, C17, C19, and C21). Aromatic compounds in PEN9-003 contain groups of (in decreasing order of abundance) monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused with benzene rings, and heterocyclic aromatics, accounting for 12.5%, 9.1%, 8% and 7.3% of total peak intensity, respectively (Fig. 6). 58.1% of intensity within the group monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is attributed to compounds with heterogeneous functional moieties including carbonyl, hydroxyl, and nitro groups, and ether and ester bonds. PAHs contain primarily 2 and 3 alkylated aromatic rings, with a dominance in the former. Cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings are made of exclusively single aromatic cores fused to 1 or 2 aliphatic rings. 36.9% of compounds in the group contain heterogeneous functional moieties. The group heterocyclics has either O or N participating in the ring structures, which are fused with either aromatic or cyclic aliphatic units. A more detailed description of the extractable compounds is given in the supplementary text. In comparison, extract of the higher rank C.D. coal (no-oxidant control, Fig. 1, fraction C) generated much less peak intensity, which is only 14.1% that of PEN9-003. This is demonstrated by both a fewer number of peaks and lower intensity of individual peaks shown in the TIC chromatogram in supplementary figures Fig. S2. A huge variation has also been found in the composition of the extractable matter. The group acyclic alkanes appeared to be the most dominant species in C.D. coal, accounting for 54.1% of total peak intensity. This is 2.4 times the proportion in PEN9-003. n-Alkanes dominate the group, ranging from C14 to C30, and are rich in longer-chain homologs, specifically C26 to C30. Aliphatic esters is the second abundant aliphatic group, accounting for 7.60% of total peak intensity. The structures are similar to those in PEN9–003, though concentrations are different (i.e. dominated by longer chain members, see supplementary text). The groups aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic ketones, and polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons that are significant in PEN9-003 turned out to be only trivial in C.D. coal, accounting for 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of total peak intensity, respectively. Only two compounds within the three groups are common to the two samples. Aromatic hydrocarbons account for 36.9% of total peak intensity of C.D. coal extract, a proportion close to that of PEN9-003. The composition however, varies tremendously. Aromatic compounds in C.D. coal is marked by a significantly higher degree of condensation. The sample is characterized by a higher proportion of PAHs (20.2%) which is twice as much as that in PEN9-003 (9.10%). This is accompanied by significantly less aliphatic moieties (i.e. the group cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings) and heterocyclics, which proportions are 42.0% and 27.4% of those in PEN9–003 coal, respectively. Specifically, polyaromatic hydrocarbons in C.D. coal are dominated by three-ring members (80.3% of group intensity), as opposed to the two-ring dominance in PEN9-003; monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dominated by biphenyls (81.2% of group intensity), in contrast to the exclusively single-ring structures in PEN9-003; and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings are made of compounds with 2 or 3 fused aromatic rings connected to a single cyclic aliphatic moiety, in contrast to those in PEN9–003 that contain a single aromatic unit connected to polycyclic aliphatic moieties. Significant difference has also been found in the individual chemical species, with only a few compounds being identified in both samples (see supplementary text). 3.4.2 Change of organic compounds in solvent extract due to hydrogen peroxide oxidation H2O2 oxidation has evidently shifted the composition of solvent extractable matter in PEN9-003 coal (see supplementary Fig. S3 for examples of some obvious shift in peak size). For the 200% standard H2O2 dosage groups, the total peak intensity decreased slowly in the first 4 days of pretreatment, and increased slightly thereafter. The magnitude of change ranges from −6.5% at day 4 to +2.6% at day 30 with reference to the total intensity of the no-oxidant control (supplementary Fig. S4). Effect of oxidation has been more significantly demonstrated among the individual compound groups (supplementary Fig. S4). In general, oxidation has increased the proportions of groups aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic ethers, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic ketones, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and monocyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons. Particularly, aliphatic carboxylic acids doubled in abundance after 7 days of pretreatment, with a new compound – octanoic acid being formed at early stage and enriched over time; aliphatic ethers boosted in concentration by 6 times at day 30, with two new compounds – udecanal dimethyl acetal and 1,1-dimethoxy-hexadecane being formed and enriched; aliphatic alcohols increased in proportion by 68% at day 30; aliphatic ketones increased in concentration by 53.8% at day 4, accompanied by formation and enrichment of 2-heptacosanone; monoaromatic hydrocarbons increased in abundance by 11% at day 30 as a result of formation and enrichment of new alkylated and hydroxylated benzaldehydes and phenols; and monocyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons surged in concentration by 5 times at day 30 due to the emergence of two cyclic carboxylic acids (see supplementary text for more details). In contrast, compound groups aliphatic esters, aliphatic amines, and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene ring have been generally consumed upon H2O2 oxidation. In particular, aliphatic esters surged in concentration at day 1, followed by a sharp decrease till day 7. The initial spike was due to the formation of a single compound – hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, which abundance boosted by 5.74 time at day 1. This is followed by a fast depletion at day 4 to just 5.5% of the concentration at day 1. The abundance of the ester increased significantly with an increase in H2O2 dosage from 50% to 100%, but slightly with increases from 0 to 50% and 100% to 200%. Groups aliphatic amines and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused with benzene rings show generally decreasing abundance over time. Individual compounds follow largely consistent trends. Groups acyclic alkanes and heterocyclics decreased and increased in abundance with treatment length. Two new compounds – 4- chromanol and benzothiazole formed after oxidation and became enriched over time. Groups polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons decreased, increased and then decreased in proportion with treatment length, inflecting around day1 and day 7. Individual compounds show largely consistent behavior within these groups (see supplementary text for more details). A list of new compounds formed after H2O2 oxidation of PEN9-003 coal is given in the supplementary table (Table S1). H2O2 oxidation has also increased the peak intensity of C.D. coal extract by a maximum 10.6% (at day 30 of 200% standard H2O2 dosage group). Pretreatment has failed to generate any new chemical species to a detectable amount, but has affected the abundance of the existing compounds. Groups polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings, heterocyclics, and polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons have seen increase in intensity by 19.7%, 17.9%, 13.8%, 25.5% and 6.67%, respectively (supplementary Fig. S5). Within the group PAHs, compounds with 2 fused ring structures increased in proportion by 4.13%, in contrast to a 3.5% decrease in the proportion of 3-ring members. Within the group monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compounds with single benzene rings increased in proportion by 3.08%. In contrast, groups acyclic alkanes and aliphatic alcohols showed a decrease in proportion by 12.6% and 37.0%, respectively. n-Alkanes, in particular, shortened in the length of carbon chain. Long chain homologs of C26 to C30 decreased in abundance by 32.3%, whereas shorter-chain homologs of C13 to C25 increased in the abundance by 14.3%. H2O2 pretreatment has barely affected the proportion of other groups (i.e. aliphatic ester and aliphatic ketones), though a slight increase in absolute intensity was generally observed. A more detailed description of compositional change after oxidation can be found in supplementary text. 3.4.3 Effect of hydrogen peroxide oxidation on coal biodegradation The average biodegradation extent of solvent-extractable compounds in the no-oxidant control and pretreated PEN9-003 is shown in Fig. 7 (PEN9-003 = solid dots, C.D. = circle). The values stand for bioconversions of compounds based on peak intensity as an average of that in the no-oxidant control and the groups with 200% standard dosage of H2O2. Each dot represents an individual compound (within a particular coal sample), which is aligned vertically with other members of the compound group coded by a same color or pattern. Overall, biodegradation has eliminated 24.1% of peak intensity in the PEN9-003 no-oxidant control, and a higher proportion of 31.2% in the oxidized sample treated with 200% standard dosage of H2O2 for 30 days. Within the latter, compounds formed after oxidation (shown in supplementary Table S1) showed an average 0.811 conversion, which is significantly higher than the overall. The results confirm that H2O2 oxidation is in favor of coal bioavailability. Groups aliphatic carboxylic acids (conversion of 0.604–0.746), aliphatic esters (conversion of 0.558–0.981), aliphatic ethers (conversion of approximately 1), aliphatic alcohols (conversion of 0.541–1), and aliphatic amine (conversion of 0.647) have been more substantially degraded in general (Fig. 7). Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons demonstrated a wide range of bioavailability. Particularly, compounds with heterogeneous functional moieties such as phenolic hydroxyl, carbonyl, and ether groups were more extensively degraded with an average conversion of 0.827. In contrast, alkylbenzenes showed a significantly lower conversion with an average of 0.0803. Oxidation product within the group showed an average conversion of 0.834, greatly contributing to the overall bioavailability of the sample. Similar patterns have been observed with the monocyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons. Oxidation products containing carboxyl groups showed an average conversion of 0.937, in contrast to an average 0.260 of those made of only carbon and hydrogen. The advantage of heterogeneous functional groups is also pronounced in group aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings. Compounds with heteroatoms showed an average conversions of 0.320, whereas those without showed 0.0913. A more detailed description of biodegraded compounds can be found in supplementary text and Table S1. Bioconversion of compounds in C.D. coal has also been displayed in Fig. 7 in the shape of circles. Conversions in C.D. appeared to be significantly lower than those in PEN9-003, particularly within groups aliphatic esters, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heterocyclics (Fig. 7). Overall, bioassay has eliminated 19.4% intensity in no-oxidant control and a lower proportion of 15.1% in the oxidized sample treated with 200% standard dosage of H2O2 for 30 days. Compounds that are present in both coal samples constantly showed lower conversions in C.D. than PEN9-003. The difference may be attributed to the level of accessibility of the hydrocarbons to microorganism that could vary significant in coals of different ranks (more discussion later). Among all groups, aliphatic alcohols showed the highest bioavailability with no significant intensity registered in bioassay residue. This is followed by aliphatic esters (conversions of 0.190–0.700), heterocyclics (0.116–0.394), and aliphatic ketones (0.296). In contrast, polycyclic hydrocarbons showed constantly low bioavailability with conversions generally below 0.1. Again, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with heterogeneous functional moieties were more substantially degraded than those made of only carbon and hydrogen. The former showed an average conversion 3.48 times higher than the latter. A more detailed description of biodegraded compounds is given in supplementary text."
14,Discussion,
15,Hydrogen peroxide oxidation of coal extractable matter,"4.1 Hydrogen peroxide oxidation of coal extractable matter Oxidation with H2O2 is initiated by formation of hydroxyl free radicals in a photolytic reaction catalyzed by UV light (Baxendale and Wilson, 1957; Lea, 1949). The free radicals have a single unpaired electrons that is highly reactive with chemical species, leading to scission of chemical bonds. This results in two free radical species, of which one will be paired with the hydroxyl free radical, and the other will repeat the cycle with a different molecule until it is bonded by another free radical, terminating the chain reaction (Motherwell and Crich, 1992). The process may give rise to hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, carboxylic groups and ether bonds (Cox and Nelson, 1984). Carboncarbon sigma bonds are in general more amenable to free radical cleavage (homolytic cleavage) due to the low homolytic dissociation energy (339 kJ/mol on average) compared to other common bonds such as -C-O- (average 351 kJ/mol) and -C-H (average 418 kJ/mol) (Lowry and Richardson, 1987). In addition, interaction between hydroxyl free radicals and water produces oxygen (Lea, 1949), which can further oxidize hydrocarbons, increasing their hydrophilicity and potentially bioavailability through formation of heterogeneous linkages (Strąpoć et al., 2011; Ishii et al., 2001). The consequences of these reactions have been demonstrated in the organic composition of PEN9–003 coal, especially within the water-soluble portion. Oxidation has boosted concentrations of acetic acid (Fig. 4) and aqueous TOC (Fig. 5) by 22.3 and 28.2 times, respectively, by the end of the 30-day period (200% standard dosage of H2O2). The source of these compounds may be solvent-extractable matter, which is believed to be more reactive due to the smaller molecular size, poorly ordered carbon, and higher degree of saturation (Fabiańska et al., 2013; Furmann et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; Romero-Sarmiento et al., 2011). This is supported by a simultaneous decrease in total peak intensity of solvent extracts (Fig. S4), and increase in aqueous TOC contents (Fig. 5) from day 1 to day 4. Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester in particular, demonstrated the greatest drop in intensity during this period. Among the water soluble compounds, VFA-As (composition give in Section 3.3; variety of compounds detected is limited to that in the analytical standard described in Section 2.4) play a significant role, accounting for an average 13% of soluble TOC (Fig. 5). Previous studies have also reported formation of other fatty acids, such as formic acid, glycolic acid, malonic acid and oxalic acid, as well as methanol in addition to acetate, in H2O2 oxidation production of low rank coal (Mae et al., 2001; Miura et al., 1996; Yu et al., 2014). They may contribute to the remaining 87% of dissolved TOC. Both concentration of H2O2 relative to coal and duration of treatment have significantly promoted the production of aqueous compounds (in Section 3.3). However, the rate of increase in dissolved TOC dropped sharply after day 4 (Fig. 5), beyond which solubilization of coal might have occurred at similar rates to further oxidation of the aqueous compounds (i.e. to CO2). The halt in net production of soluble TOC can be overcome by increasing the concentration of H2O2 relative to coal (shown in Fig. 5). However, whether the extra bioavailability justifies the cost requires further calculation. H2O2 oxidation might have also converted kerogen or larger hydrocarbons to smaller fragments that are amenable to GC/MS analysis within the set conditions. A direct evidence is the elevation of total peak intensity in PEN9-003 coal after 30 days of pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). This is consistent with the increase in bitumen content in H2O2 oxidized Powder River Basin subbituminous coal reported by Jones et al. (2013). Of the total increase in peak intensity at day 30 (200% standard dosage), 11.3% was due to formation of new compounds which are exclusively oxygenated and small in molecular size (primarily <10 carbon numbers). The rest was due to enrichment of existing compounds (Section 3.4.2), most of which also contain oxygenated functional groups, an observation largely consistent with previous studies (Clemens et al., 1991; Tian et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2012; Wang and Zhou, 2012; Yu et al., 2014). Bother kerogen or larger compounds within solvent-extractable matter could have been precursors for these molecules. The fact that the intensity of groups acyclic alkanes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings decreased during early phase of prertreatment (Fig. S4) suggests that they might have been the precursors. They were, however, gradually replenished at later phase of oxidation, indicating a possible conversion from kerogen. In particular, the drop in intensity of n-alkanes from day 0 to day 1 matches favorably with the surge in content of hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (Fig. S4), suggesting a possible relationship. However the mechanism behind such a selective conversion is unclear. Detailed mapping of precursor molecules to oxidation products is also hard to conduct purely based on change in intensity as a lot of compounds might have been both formed and consumed during oxidation, and that free radical reaction lacks specific pathways. The two samples PEN9-003 and C.D. have demonstrated remarkably different response to H2O2 pretreatment. Despite the increase in solvent-extractable matter contents, C.D. coal has failed to register any significant concentration of soluble TOC after oxidation (<<0.01 mg/g). A possible explanation is that C.D. coal might have contained far less chemically labile matter so that H2O2 was present in excess, converting water-soluble compounds to CO2 as soon as they were formed. This seems to be supported by the low abundance of solvent-extractable matter, which intensity is only 1/7 that in PEN9-003 (Section 3.4.1), and further by the fact that the concentrations of H2O2 used to treat the two coals are largely similar (Table 2). Besides the quantity, difference in the composition of solvent-extractable matter could have also affected the amenability of the coals to H2O2 treatment. C.D. coal has a significantly lower proportion of saturated organic moieties, which is reflected in both hydrogen content (Table 2) and the composition of solvent-extractable matter (Section 3.4.1). This indicates a relatively lower availability of sigma bonds and a higher degree of aromatization in C.D. coal, and therefore a greater resistance to cleavage. Similar to PEN9-003, oxidation has led to an increase in total intensity of oxygen containing compounds in C.D. extract. However, the extent of enrichment was less (Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5) and due solely to existing compounds with no new chemical species formed by detectable concentrations. In contrast to PEN9-003, oxidation of C.D. coal has also increased the intensity of groups with nearly no heteroatoms (i.e. polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons fused to benzene rings). This may be caused by a stronger attack on aliphatic linkages within kerogen matrix as a result of higher exposure to H2O2 (due to the lack of labile compounds)."
16,Effect of hydrogen peroxide oxidation on coal bioavailability,"4.2 Effect of hydrogen peroxide oxidation on coal bioavailability H2O2 oxidation of PEN9-003 coal has resulted in a maximum 10 folds of increase in methane yield from bioassays, with the aqueous phase being more affected (see in Section 3.2). The improvement in bioavailability is consistent with that reported by Jones et al. (2013). Particularly, methane yield from the liquid phase of pretreatment product increased by 13.1 times after oxidation. This is thought to be largely due to the surge in VFA-As (Fig. 4) and soluble TOC (Fig. 5) concentrations, which became undetectable in the bioassay residue. The high bioavailability of water-soluble compounds is consistent with results from Chen et al. (2017) and Robbins et al. (2016). Contribution of aqueous oxidation products to total methane yield (combining liquid and solid) can be as high as 62.2% (Fig. 2), suggesting an importance of them to bioavailability. The conversion of soluble TOC to methane is however, low (0.0668 based on carbon balance at day 30 with 200% standard dosage), which may be, in part, due to the presence of residual H2O2 that continued to oxidize aqueous compounds to CO2 in bioassays. This is evidenced by our observation that methane production from the aqueous phase of oxidation product (fraction B, Fig. 1) did not start until a second inoculation with the same culture on the 7th day of incubation. The initial lag might be a result of inhibition from the residue H2O2, which was gradually depleted and overwhelmed by the second lot of inoculum. This is further supported by the fact that the conversion of dissolved TOC to methane is higher in the no-oxidant control (0.206) than in the oxidized coal. In general, concentration of H2O2 relative to coal has a stronger effect than pretreatment length on methane yield from the aqueous oxidation product within the range investigated (Section 3.2). Nevertheless, the significance of a longer pretreatment duration increased with an increase in H2O2 dosage. This implies that high H2O2 concentration seems to favor formation of bioavailable compounds in water solution more than conversion of aqueous compounds to CO2. It can be extrapolated that further increasing the H2O2 dosage and treatment length will improve the methane yield further. However, the benefit needs to be balanced with extra chemical cost, as well as the decreased throughput due to the longer treatment time. Insubstantial removal of residual H2O2 can also compromise methane yield even after a second inoculation. This is demonstrated by the significantly larger difference in methane yield from liquid phase between day 4 and day 30 (200% standard dosage of H2O2¸ methane yield at day 4 is 44.3% that at day 30, Fig. 2) than the difference in acetic acid and TOC content (acetic acid and TOC at day 4 are 97.3% and 86.5% those at day 30, Figs. 4 and 5). The highest concentration of H2O2 used in this study is 39.6 mmol/g coal or 10% by weight with regards to the solution. This is considered reasonably high compared to those used for experiments of the same purpose (Huang et al., 2013a; Jones et al., 2013). Oxidation with H2O2 has also boosted methane production from the solid phase of oxidized PEN9-003 coal (Fig. 1, fraction A) by a maximum of 8.93 folds. Although a small portion of methane might be derived from the residual water-soluble compounds adsorbed to the surface of oxidized coal (solid portion, Fig. 1, fraction A), the fact that the proportion of methane yield from the solid in total (37.8% at day 30, 200% standard dosage, Fig. 2) is significantly higher than that of acetic acid and dissolved TOC (proportions of acetic acid and TOC in water eluents of pretreated solid are 14.8% and 4.73% of the concentration in total pretreatment product, respectively, Figs.4 and 5) indicates that non-water-soluble compounds have made a major contribution to biomethane yield from the solid phase of pretreatment product. Specifically, H2O2 oxidation has increased the extent of biodegradation in solvent-extractable matter of PEN9-003 coal by a maximum 29.5% with regards to that in the no-oxidant control (see Section 3.4.3). The improvement is, in part, due to the formation of new chemical species which have an average conversion of 0.811, significantly higher than the overall conversion (0.312 in PEN9-003 treated with 200% standard dosage of H2O2 for 30 days). This is because these compounds are rich in heterogeneous moieties such as carboxyl group, ether bond, carbonyl group, and hydroxyl group, which have been associated with high bioavailability (Chen et al., 2017; Hirschler et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2013; Scott and Jones, 2000). The enhancement in biodegradation may also be a result of an enrichment of compounds that show higher bioavailability in the no-oxidant control (see Section 3.4.2 and Section 3.4.3). These include groups aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic alcohols, and aliphatic ethers, which contain the above functional moieties. Nevertheless, the extent of solvent-extractable matter biodegradation is not always reflective of methane production (Chen et al., 2017; Furmann et al., 2013). This is demonstrated by a slight decrease in methane yield from the solid phase of oxidation product after day 4 (Fig. 2), in contrast to an increase in the abundance and bioconversion of solvent-extractable matter (Section 3.4.3 and supplementary Fig. S4). A possible explanation is that prolonged oxidation raised the average oxidation state of carbon in the extractable matter (and therefore fewer electron to be donated), therefore reducing the proportion of methane produced per mole of compounds consumed. When the influence of the decrease in molar yield of methane outweighs that of the increase in biodegradation extent, the observed methane yield will decrease. The hypothesis is supported by the fact that the weighted average oxidation state of carbon in compounds with conversions >0.5 is higher at day 30 (−1.54) than day 4 (−1.60). The difference becomes more significant when conversion is limited to >0.7: −1.54 at day 30, and −1.66 at day 4. The decrease in methane yield may also be due to change in contents of specific compounds such as 2,3,4,6-tetramethyl- phenol, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 1,1-dimethoxy-hexadecane, 3-ethyl-4-methyl-1H-pyrole-2,5-dione, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, and dodecanoic acid 1-methylethyl ester, which show conversions >0.5 and similar variation trends with treatment length to methane production. However, the advantage of these compounds over others in being converted to methane cannot be readily explained with existing knowledge. Further studies with a larger number of samples is required to confirm the results. In contrast to PEN9-003, H2O2 oxidation of the higher rank C.D. coal has reduced the bioconversion of solvent-extractable matter to roughly 3/4 of that in the no-oxidant control (Section 3.4.3). Methane yield from the pretreated samples was just marginally detectable and decreased slightly with treatment length (Fig. 3). The inability to produce biomethane has been primarily associated with the low contents of extractable matter, and further with the low proportion of the oxygenated bioavailable compounds in the extractable matter (Section 3.4.2 and Section 3.4.3). As a result, methane generation might have been outcompeted by other carbon-consuming activities that express higher priority (e.g. biosynthesis). The low methane yield is also consistent with the observation that compounds common to the two coals showed constantly lower conversions in C.D (Section 3.4.3). The discrepancy might be explained by the difference in accessibility of coal surface compounds. As coal gains thermal maturity, the abundance of macropores and mesopores decreases considerably in exchange for micropores (Crosdale et al., 1998; Gan et al., 1972; Nie et al., 2015; Rodrigues and Lemos De Sousa, 2002). Micropores have diameters <5 nm, which is too small to accommodate microorganisms that are typically 1000 to 3000 nm in diameter (Scott, 1999). As a result, the higher rank C.D. coal might have encompassed less effective surface area for microbial colonization than PEN9-003. The lack of heterogeneity in C.D. coal would have also increased the hydrophobicity of the coal surface (therefore less wettability), making leaching of hydrocarbons in water and attachment of microbes difficult. The former is believe to be a major constraint for the rate of the microbial process (Papendick et al., 2011; Scott, 1999; Strąpoć et al., 2011). The decrease in methane yield with treatment length might be attributed to the depletion of acetic acid (Section 3.3) and 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyn-4,6-diol (Section 3.4.2) in the later stage of oxidation in the aqueous and solid portions of the coal respectively. The former is highly bioavailable for methanogenesis (Section 3.3, and in Chen et al., 2017; Robbins et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017) and the latter demonstrated the highest bioconversion (close to 1) within the organic solvent-extractable portion of C.D. coal (Section 3.4.3)."
17,Effect of coal rank on amenability to H2O2 oxidation and biomethane production,"4.3 Effect of coal rank on amenability to H2O2 oxidation and biomethane production The two coal samples showed pronounced difference in response to chemical pretreatment and biodegradation. This is believed, to some degrees, to be associated with the difference in rank (Section 2.1). Transformation of subbituminous to bituminous coal is marked by condensation of phenols to diaryl ether and dibenzofuran-like structures, which are further converted to alkylbenzene-like structures, followed by condensation of the aliphatic side chains, forming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Fakoussa and Hofrichter, 1999; Hatcher and Clifford, 1997). The observation that the subbituminous PEN9-003 coal contains a significantly higher proportion of oxygenated monoaromatic compounds and less polyaromatic structures than the bituminous C.D. (Section 3.4.1) is consistent with the maturation pattern. The higher abundance of heteroatoms and a lower degree of unsaturation in the low rank PEN9-003 coal matches favorably with its high bioavailability and chemical reactivity (Foght, 2008; Strąpoć et al., 2011). In contrast, polyaromatics stabilized by resonance structures are energy-intensive to break (Foght, 2008; Holliger and Zehnder, 1996; Strąpoć et al., 2011), therefore compromising the bioavailability and chemical reactivity of the high rank C.D. coal. In addition, an increase in coal thermal maturity can also affect the content of solvent-extractable matter, which is an important indicator for coal bioavailability (Chen et al., 2017; Fallgren et al., 2013a; Jones et al., 2013). Solvent-extractable matter, also known as bitumen or oil in coal, is defined as a fraction of mobile compounds that are soluble in organic solvents and fills the voids and fractures in coals (Curiale, 1986; Jacob, 1989; Mastalerz and Glikson, 2000; Tissot and Welte, 1984). Generation of solvent-extractable matter in coal takes place mainly within liptinite and perhydrous vitrinite macerals (Clayton, 1993; Taylor et al., 1998). Nevertheless, as thermal maturity increases, liptinite loses its identity and eventually shows chemical properties homologous to vitrinite in medium-volatile bituminous rank (Mastalerz and Glikson, 2000; Strąpoć et al., 2011). The transformation is accompanied by an initial increase in oil content from subbituminous to bituminous (Taylor et al., 1998) and a subsequent thermal crack of the hydrocarbons to gas in medium-volatile bituminous rank, leading to a decrease in hydrogen and oxygen contents (Mastalerz and Glikson, 2000; Strąpoć et al., 2011). The low proportion of liptinite (Section 2.1) and a deficit in solvent-extractable matter and elemental hydrogen and oxygen (Table 2) in C.D. coal (medium-volatile bituminous) compare favorably with the description. They are believed to be disadvantages of high rank coal in terms of bioavailability. Other factors, such as the increasing hydrophobicity and microporosity of coal (Section 4.2) with an increase in rank, could also inversely affect coal bioavailability, leading to a general consensus that coal bioavailability decreases with increase in thermal maturity (Fakoussa and Hofrichter, 1999; Rice and Claypool, 1981; Robbins et al., 2016; Scott, 1999; Strąpoć et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a number of studies demonstrated evidences that contradict with the above statement (Fallgren et al., 2013a; Gallagher et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2008). Fallgren et al. (2013a) in particular, pointed out that bituminous coals with an abundance of ‘trapped volatile organics’ produced more methane than samples of lower or higher ranks. This compares favorably with the importance of solvent-extractable matter described in this study and in Chen et al. (2017) and Jones et al. (2013), suggesting a possible higher order of relationship between coal rank and bioavailability (i.e. following the trend of solvent-extractable matter which content). Chen et al. (2017) also proposed a degree of dependence of coal bioavailability on maceral composition, as well as post-depositional environment such as exposure to indigenous microorganism in coal seams. This brings in factors other than coal rank to the study of coal bioavailability. Further experiments with a greater variety of samples would therefore, be necessary to characterize the dependence of coal bioavailability on thermal maturity. Besides that, the study has also revealed a negative relationship between coal rank and chemical reactivity. While the high degree of aromatization (more PAHs) and poor surface wettability in C.D. can diminish the amenability of coal to H2O2 oxidation, the low abundance of chemically labile compounds (e.g. solvent extractable matter) might have led to over-oxidation, compromising the bioavailability of coal. Further experiments with more appropriate H2O2 dosages may be established to re-examine the effect of oxidation on bioavailability of C.D. coal."
18,Conclusions,"The study has confirmed an ability of H2O2 in improving coal bioavailability for microbially-enhanced methane production. The major findings are outlined below. 1) H2O2 oxidation has boosted methane production by a maximum 10 times in the subbituminous PEN9-003 coal treated with 39.6 mmol/g coal of H2O2 for 30 days. The highest methane yield was 223.7 umol/g (~5.68 m3/t). In contrast, the medium-volatile bituminous C.D. coal showed no improvement in methane production after oxidation, with a maximum yield of only 0.212 μmol/g. 2) H2O2 oxidation has considerably enhanced solubilization of PEN9-003 in water, with concentrations of dissolved TOC and acetic acid boosted by maximum 28.2 and 22.3 times, respectively. The pretreatment has also increased content of solvent-extractable matter, particularly oxygen-containing compounds, such as aliphatic carboxylic acids, alcohols, ethers, ketones, and oxygenated monocyclic aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The enrichment was due both to formation of new compounds and an increase in the abundance of existing compounds. C.D. coal has, likewise, seen an increase in solvent-extractable matter content after oxidation, though no net formation of new compounds or water-soluble matter was detected. 3) Improvement in methane generation from PEN9-003 was derived from both the aqueous and the solid phases of oxidation product. The former (i.e. dissolved TOC) was found to be depleted in bioassay residue, while the latter (i.e. solvent-extractable matter in solid) demonstrated a 29.5% increase in bioconversion after oxidation. Solvent-extractable matter with heterogeneous functional moieties showed a higher bioavailability in general. Oxidation appeared to inversely affect the bioavailability of C.D. coal, a possible consequence of over-oxidation due to the low abundance of chemically labile compounds. 4) Compared to the subbituminous PEN9-003 coal, the medium-volatile bituminous C.D. coal is lower in the solvent-extractable matter content, H/C ratio, contents of heteroatoms, and surface wettability. These are results of substantial thermal maturation (e.g. medium-volatile bituminous or higher), and are thought to be responsible for the low bioavailability and chemical reactivity (i.e. oxidation by H2O2) in C.D. coal. The improvement in methane yield is consistent with that reported by Jones et al. (2013) upon oxidizing subbituminous coal with H2O2. The study is one of the first comprehensive works in characterizing compositional changes of solvent-extractable matter after oxidation, as well as the effect of rank on chemical reactivity and the consequent bioavailability of oxidized coal. Application of the pretreatment is, however, only likely to be ex-situ. Coal beneficiation waste, especially rejects from fine coal washing (e.g. froth floatation) may be used as a feed to bioreactors to make the process economically plausible. These coal fines contain a decent proportion of organic carbon with proven bioavailability for methanogenesis (Zheng et al., 2017). The technical challenge is usually the high rank of coals (e.g. coking coals) from which the rejects are generated, posting a same problem as that of C.D. coal. A more carefully designed combination of oxidant dosage and pretreatment length is required for the process to be effective. A further improvement in chemical reactivity may be achieved via additional of surfactants or extraction with solvents that enhances the accessibility of aqueous radicals to organic matter. However, whether the extra methane justifies the chemical cost demands further calculation. Ex-situ process may also be plausible on lower rank coals in places where number of coal reserves far exceeds that of natural gas, and burning thermal coal has caused serious environmental issues so that conversion to a cleaner form of fuel is necessary (e.g. the surge of PM2.5 fine particulate matter in China). The experiments on the subbituminous coal (PEN9-003) in this study showed a promising potential and can be used as basis for further optimization and upscaling."
