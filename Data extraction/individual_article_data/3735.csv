0,Introduction,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for the growth of all the organisms. Nevertheless, excessive phosphorus emission into waterbodies can trigger eutrophication and disrupt ecological balance (Xiong et al., 2017). As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the maximum concentration of phosphorus in surface water should be remained below the acceptable level (0.5–1.0 mg/L) (Gu et al., 2017). Therefore, specific attention should be attached to the removal of phosphate, the only form of phosphorus that can be directly assimilated by organisms (Zhang et al., 2017). In the past few decades, multiple strategies such as biological process (Zhang et al., 2020), chemical precipitation (Qiu et al., 2017), ion exchange (Sendrowski and Boyer, 2013) and adsorption (Wang et al., 2016) have been applied for phosphate removal, therein adsorption-based technique has received increasing interest due to its flexibility of design, no treatment by-products, ease of operation, high effectiveness and reusability (An et al., 2020; Sharmin et al., 2020). However, adsorption process largely depends on the properties of adsorbents. To achieve efficient phosphate removal, different materials including clays (Gan et al., 2009), biochars (Jung et al., 2019), red mud (Ye et al., 2015), metal oxides (Kumar et al., 2019), layered double hydroxides (Kong et al., 2019) have been investigated. Nevertheless, challenge remains to separate and recover these powdered adsorbents (Wu et al., 2017), provoking the urgent development of easily separated adsorbent. As a kind of cross-linked hydrophilic biopolymers, hydrogels possess stable three-dimensional network and allow the diffusion of free molecules or ions throughout the internal structure (Sinha and Chakma, 2019). In this case, the development of adsorbents based on hydrogels could greatly facilitate the separation and recovery process (Luo et al., 2019). As a natural polysaccharide derived from brown algae, sodium alginate (SA) can cross-link with multivalent metal ions (e.g., Ca (Ⅱ)) to form hydrogels with stable three-dimensional network structure (Hui et al., 2014). Other merits like biocompatibility, biodegradability (Luo et al., 2019), non-toxicity and availability in nature (Lv et al., 2013) further contribute to its great potential as a host material for adsorption process. However, tactics are needed to modify its physicochemical property due to the fragile structure and low strength of virgin SA hydrogel (Ngah and Fatinathan, 2008; Wang et al., 2018). Among different strategies, polymer blending is noted for forming interpenetrating network structure, which can efficiently improve the mechanical strength of hydrogels (Zhou et al., 2018). PVA, a kind of synthetic polymers that possess superior chemical stability and mechanical strength (Hui et al., 2014), has received considerable interest and been blended with SA to form SA/PVA hydrogels with high toughness (Lv et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018). Apart from low mechanical strength, the low adsorption capacity and selectivity towards phosphate still restrict the practical application of hydrogel adsorbents (Chen et al., 2020). In the past several years, lanthanum (La), a member of the rare earth elements, has received considerable attention due to its excellent affinity and strong anti-interference ability towards phosphate in complex aqueous system (Dong et al., 2017; Min et al., 2019). Besides, non-toxicity and relatively cheap properties of La further contribute to its promising potential in phosphate removal (Kong et al., 2019). For instance, Zhou et al. immobilized lanthanum hydroxide into PVA/SA matrix and achieved nearly double phosphate uptake than raw PVA/SA hydrogel (Zhou et al., 2018). Recently, specific attention has been attached to composite hydrogels based on biopolymers and clays for the improvement effect of clays on the physicochemical properties of polymers (Kalantari and M. Afifi, 2018). In fact, the intrinsic defects linked with individual materials could be possibly minimized by combining them together (Benhouria et al., 2015). Moreover, composite hydrogels occasionally exhibit some distinctive features, which is worthy of specific focus. In our previous study (Wang et al., 2020), it was found that the introduction of talc contributes to superior phosphate fixation performance of hydrogel. Palygorskite is a hydrated silicate mineral abundantly existed in natural environment. It possesses physicochemical properties such as moderate cation exchange capacity, high specific surface area and abundant silanol groups on its surface (Gan et al., 2009), which make it a potential adsorbent for phosphate removal. To date, raw and modified palygorskite (Gu et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2018) have been developed for phosphate removal, while rare studies focus on phosphate removal by palygorskite composited hydrogel. Therefore, the present work intends to develop lanthanum cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol/alginate/palygorskite (LPAP) composite hydrogel for phosphate removal, which could possibly provide new perspective for the development and utilization of composite hydrogel adsorbents. The specific aims of this work are: 1) preparation and characterization of lanthanum cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol/alginate/palygorskite (LPAP) composite hydrogel beads; 2) evaluation on the effects of environmental factors on phosphate uptake by LPAP beads; 3) phosphate removal mechanism investigation of the composite beads; 4) reusability test of LPAP beads."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Palygorskite (PAL, 200 mesh) was obtained from Minerals Co., Ltd (Jiangsu, china). Lanthanum chloride hydrate (LaCl3 xH2O), sodium alginate (SA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and other reagents used in the present work were all analytical grade and obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The phosphate stock solution (1500 mg/L) was prepared by dissolving a calculated amount (based on PO4 2−) of KH2PO4 with deionized (DI) water produced by an ultrapure water system."
3,Fabrication of composite hydrogels,"2.2 Fabrication of composite hydrogels LPAP hydrogel beads were prepared by cross-linking reaction using a drop method. Typically, 50 mL PVA solution (2%, w/v) and SA solution (4%, w/v) were separately obtained under consecutive stirring. These solutions were then mixed and continuously stirred for 6 h to obtain uniform PVA/SA blend with the halved content of PVA and SA in it, which is accordant with previous literature (Zhang et al., 2018). Thereafter, 1 g of palygorskite powder was added into the above blend and stirred for 12 h to acquire homogeneous mixture. After being ultrasonic-treated for 10 min, the obtained mixture was dropped via a 5-mL syringe into 400 mL of LaCl3 solution (0.15 M) to form hydrogel through ionic interactions (Wang et al., 2020). Those newly-formed hydrogels were aged under continuous stirring for 24 h to achieve adequate gelation. Thereafter, the formed hydrogel beads were collected and soaked in DI water to remove the unreacted reagents. Lastly, the obtained composites were repeatedly rinsed, freeze-dried and stored for the following experiment. The preparation procedure of LPAP beads is summarized in Scheme 1 ."
4,Batch experiment,"2.3 Batch experiment The phosphate uptake behaviors of LPAP beads at different conditions were evaluated by batch experiments. Typically, 1.4 g/L of LPAP beads were mixed with 20 mL of phosphate solution in 25-mL glass bottle at given initial concentration and solution pH. The bottles were then shaken (180 rpm) for 24 h at different condition temperature (20–40 °C). After adsorption process, samples extracted from suspension were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane, then used for concentration analysis. NaOH or HCl solution (1 M) was used to adjust the pH value of initial phosphate solutions. Detailed information for each experiment was respectively presented in the figure caption. The effects of different environmental factors were accordingly investigated. Thereafter, the adsorption kinetic of LPAP beads was evaluated at different initial phosphate concentrations, and adsorption isotherm was investigated in the concentration range of 30–300 mg/L. Subsequently, thermodynamics analysis was performed varying ambient temperature from 20 to 40 °C. Phosphate concentration was determined by the molybdate spectrophotometric method (Hui et al., 2014). The experimental phosphate uptake at equilibrium (q e , mg/g) and removal efficiency (R%) were obtained by following equations: (1) q e = ( C 0 − C e ) × V m (2) R ( % ) = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 where C 0 and C e (mg/L) respectively represent the initial and equilibrium phosphate concentration; m is the dry mass of adsorbent (g), and V (L) is the volume of phosphate solution. The mean data derived from parallel experiments were used for results and discussion."
5,Adsorption-desorption experiments,"2.4 Adsorption-desorption experiments After equilibrium adsorption was achieved, LPAP beads were filtered and collected for adsorption-desorption experiments. Specifically, the phosphate adsorbed LPAP beads were shaken in 20 mL of HCl solution (0.1 M) to elute phosphate bound on adsorbent. Thereafter, these desorbed LPAP beads were regenerated in LaCl3 solution (0.15 M) for 12 h. Finally, these beads were filtered, rinsed and used for next adsorption experiment."
6,Characterization analysis,"2.5 Characterization analysis The characterizations of synthetized LPAP beads were performed by multiple methods like Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS, Zeiss SIGMA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer (BET, ASAP 2460), X-ray diffraction (XRD, XPert Pro), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet 5700) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). Other characterization methods such as zeta potential analysis and compressive strength study are listed in the Supporting Materials."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Adsorption studies by batch experiments,"3.1 Adsorption studies by batch experiments 3.1.1 Effects of adsorbent dosage and initial solution pH To preliminarily assess phosphate adsorptive performance of LPAP beads, the effects of adsorbent dosage and solution pH were investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 a, phosphate removal efficiency of LPAP beads raised linearly with the adsorbent dosage increasing from 0.2 g/L to 1.4 g/L, and stabilized when more adsorbent was added. Typically, the removal efficiency was up to 97.2% at the dosage of 1.4 g/L, achieving the experimental phosphate uptake of 10.0 mg/g. It was worth mentioning that the introduction of PAL into SA/PVA matrix has insignificant effect on phosphate uptake, with only slightly decreased amount (from 10.2 to 10.0 mg/g) of phosphate uptake observed (Fig. S1). Namely, PAL not only participated in the construction and reinforcement of three-dimensional network structure, but also involved in phosphate capturing, which was mainly due to the embedding of dissociative La into interlayer structure of PAL through cation exchange (Mucci et al., 2020). Herein, following experiments were conducted at the optimal adsorbent dosage of 1.4 g/L. Fig. 1b displayed the effect of initial solution pH on phosphate uptake of LPAP beads. Notably, LPAP beads exhibited relatively stable phosphate removal in the pH range of 3–6, with the amount of adsorbed phosphate fluctuating between 9.3 and 10.0 mg/g. However, deteriorated phosphate removal was detected at too low or too high solution pH, which was similar to other La-based adsorbents (Qiu et al., 2017; Thagira Banu et al., 2018). For instance, gradually decreased phosphate uptake (from 8.3 to 7.0 mg/g) by LPAP beads was obtained when solution pH increased from 7 to 10, while nearly no phosphate was removed at pH 2. The pH sensibility of adsorbents on phosphate uptake performance was related to different existing forms of phosphate and the surface charge of adsorbent depending on solution pH (Wu et al., 2017). The species of phosphate in solution could be determined by following equation: H 3 P O 4 ↔ K 1 H 2 P O 4 − + H + ↔ K 2 H P O 4 2 − + H + ↔ K 3 P O 4 3 − + H + where pK 1 = 2.12, pK 2 = 7.21 and pK 3 = 12.67, respectively (Chen et al., 2016). When solution pH was lower than 2.12, phosphate mainly existed in the form of H3PO4, which was weakly adhered to the surface of LPAP beads (Chen et al., 2020), thus poor phosphate removal was observed at pH 2. At the pH range of 2.12–7.21, H2PO4 − was the predominant species and could be efficiently adsorbed on the active sites, hence LPAP beads exhibited satisfactory phosphate removal at that pH range. Particularly, maximum phosphate uptake of 10.0 mg/g was obtained at pH 4, which is similar to previous literature (Zhou et al., 2018). At pH 7.21–12.67, HPO4 2− that possesses a higher adsorption free energy than H2PO4 − dominated, resulting in a more difficult adsorption process (Shi et al., 2019). Besides, the surface of LPAP beads was deprotonated and negatively charged (Fig. 1d) when solution pH was higher than pHPZC (pHPZC = ∼6.1). Hence the electrostatic repulsive forces between HPO4 2− and the negatively charged adsorbent surface hindered the binding process as well (Zhang et al., 2012). In addition, enhanced competitive effect of HPO4 2− and OH− towards metal active sites with the increased solution pH further contributed to poor phosphate removal (Dong et al., 2017). Above combined reasons could be the explanation of the unsatisfactory phosphate removal by LPAP beads at alkaline condition. 3.1.2 Effect of co-existing ions To evaluate the applicable potential of prepared adsorbent in complex aquatic systems, the effect of co-existing ions was investigated (Fig. 1c). It was commonly reported that the presence of anions could inhibit phosphate uptake process owing to the competitive effect between anions and phosphate (Qiu et al., 2017; Thagira Banu et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). However, the observation of this study illustrated opposite tendency, which was worthy of specific focus. Typically, slightly enhanced phosphate removal was obtained with the increased concentration of anions (Cl−, NO3 −, and SO4 2−), achieving the removal efficiency of 100% at a not very high ion concentration (3 mM). Similar enhancement trend was also reported during phosphate adsorption by Zr-loaded cation exchange fibers, which was attributable to the co-ion (sodium ion) effect (Awual et al., 2011). In the present study, the comparison between SA/PVA hydrogel with and without PAL addition indicated the main role of PAL in selective phosphate adsorption behavior (Fig. S1). Specifically, it was found that the introduction of PAL contributed to slightly enhanced phosphate removal in the presence of Cl−, NO3 − and SO4 2− (10 mM), whereas phosphate uptake of virgin PVA/SA hydrogel was obviously inhibited. Given the critical role of PAL, the enhanced phosphate removal of LPAP beads could be possibly ascribed as the partial leakage of La in the PAL interlayer through the replacement of Na+ presented in solution and the formation of secondary P-reactive phase (Mucci et al., 2020). In addition, the effect of F− on phosphate uptake by LPAP beads was also worthy-noting. As seen, the existence of F− exhibited apparent inhibition trend towards phosphate removal, which was opposite with that of Cl−, NO3 −, and SO4 2−. The strong affinity between La (Ⅲ) and F− due to the hard acid of lanthanum and hard base of fluoride (He et al., 2019) was reasonable for above observation. Actually, lanthanum based materials have been applied for fluoride removal from water (He et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2019). Moreover, the disintegration of LPAP hydrogel (data not shown here) accompanied with slightly enhanced phosphate removal was observed at F− concentration of 10 mM, resulting from the reversal of ion cross-linking reaction and the bonding process of La (Ⅲ) and F−. In summary, the observation of this study suggested that efficient phosphate removal was maintained by LPAP beads in the co-existence of anions, which to some extent indicated its remarkable advantage in practical application, especially in the treatment of saline wastewater. 3.1.3 Adsorption kinetic Kinetics of phosphate adsorption by LPAP beads were tested at fixed time intervals within different initial concentrations (15 mg/L, 60 mg/L and 150 mg/L). As seen, for each concentration, phosphate in aqueous solution was captured at a relatively fast rate (Fig. 2 a), achieving about 64%–78% of total adsorbed amount removed within the first 60 min; then progressive removal of 87%–93% was obtained in the time range of 60–240 min; thereafter equilibrium adsorption was almost achieved over 720 min. The relatively fast phosphate removal by LPAP beads was further indicated by the comparison with other similar hydrogels (Table 1 ), which was beneficial to its practical application. Typically, initial fast removal rate could be attributed to the adequate active sites for phosphate to attach as well as the driving force resulted from great concentration gradient (Zhang et al., 2018). However, as time elapsed, the removal rate decreased along with the gradually saturated adsorptive sites, and equilibrium adsorption was eventually reached. Herein, 1440 min was selected for subsequent batch experiments to reach thorough equilibrium. To analyze kinetic behavior of phosphate uptake by LPAP beads, the experimental data were fitted by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, pseudo-second-order kinetic model, intra-particle diffusion model and Boyd and Weber-Morris model (Jung et al., 2019). As seen in Fig. 2b, the better fitness of pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R 2 = 0.9686–0.9840) than pseudo-first-order kinetic model (R 2 = 0.7731–0.9121) (Table S1) indicated that the chemisorption rather than mass transfer controlled phosphate adsorption process of LPAP beads (Yan et al., 2012). Accordingly, the decreased rate constants (K 2 ) with the increase of initial concentration was observed and in accordance with previous literature (Zhang et al., 2019b). To determine the rate-limiting step of LPAP beads, intra-particle diffusion model was applied (Fig. 2c). The plots of q t vs t 1/2 for phosphate adsorption by LPAP beads exhibited multi-linear tendency and did not pass through the origin, suggesting that intra-particle diffusion was not the sole rate-determining step. Actually, three regions were observed in the plot, which respectively corresponded to external mass transfer step (step Ⅰ), internal surface diffusion step (step Ⅱ) and equilibrium stage (step Ⅲ) (Liu et al., 2015). As seen, the calculated K d1 (K d1 = 0.2515–0.8297 mg/(g·min1/2)) was much greater than K d2 (K d2 = 0.0222–0.1441 mg/(g·min1/2)), implying that the phosphate adsorption process of LPAP beads might be primarily governed by film diffusion, followed with intra-particle diffusion as the subsidiary rate-limiting step (Jung et al., 2019). As seen in Fig. 2d, Boyd and Weber-Morris model was further adopted to quantitatively explore the rate-determining steps. It is illustrated that the rate-limiting step of adsorption process is film diffusion if the plots of ln (1-q t/q e) vs t are nonlinear and do not go through the origin, otherwise the intra-particle diffusion dominates the adsorption process (Zhang et al., 2019b). Apparently, the plots at each concentration were nonlinear and did not pass through the origin. The calculated D i in the range of 8.45 × 10−6-1.17 × 10−5 further demonstrated film diffusion as the rate-limiting step of the overall adsorption process (Jung et al., 2019). 3.1.4 Adsorption isotherm To further understand the phosphate adsorption mechanism, adsorption isotherm was performed at different temperatures (20, 30 and 40 °C) with the alteration of initial concentration from 30 mg/L to 300 mg/L (Fig. 3 ). As seen in Fig. 3a, with the increase of initial concentration, the phosphate uptake of LPAP beads increased correspondingly (from 11.8 mg/g at 30 mg/L to 33.2 mg/g at 300 mg/L). Besides, a higher temperature was found to enhance phosphate uptake under the tested range. Herein, the obtained experimental data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin model and D-R isotherm models (Kumar et al., 2019). The fitted plots were presented in Fig. 3b and c, with relative parameters listed in Table S2. According to correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of different isotherm models, the order of these models for their applicability in the description of adsorption isotherm of LPAP beads could be determined as Freundlich > Temkin > Langmuir > D-R. Freundlich model was based on the assumption of heterogeneous adsorption with an exponentially decaying energies of adsorption sites (Yan et al., 2012). As seen, the R 2 value of Freundlich model (R 2 = 0.9964–0.9990) was highly close to 1, indicating the heterogeneous surface of LPAP beads and multi-layer coverage of phosphate (Shi et al., 2019). Besides, the n f of Freundlich model could reflect the favorability between adsorbents and adsorbates. Specifically, favorable adsorption over the whole range of tested concentration is affirmed if n f is within 0–1, whereas a higher n f value than 1 suggests favorable adsorption only at high concentration (Yan et al., 2012). The n f value calculated for LPAP beads (n f = 0.2493–0.3195) was in the range of 0–1, implying favorable adsorption of phosphate by LPAP beads over the whole investigated concentration range. Temkin model assumes heterogeneous adsorption and the adsorption heat distributes linearly with converge (Wang et al., 2016), and it is often applied for chemical sorption analysis. As seen, Temkin model also fitted the experimental data well (R 2 = 0.9550–0.9717), further confirmed the chemisorption of phosphate on the surface of LPAP beads. Conversely, Langmuir model and D-R model were not suitable for the description of isotherm behavior of LPAP beads due to their relatively low R 2 value (both lower than 0.9). Herein, the obtained R L (0.04918–0.4967) at different temperatures indicated favorable phosphate adsorption by LPAP beads as well. Furthermore, LPAP beads still exhibited relatively high adsorption capacity after composited with low-cost clay, as the comparison with other similar adsorbents demonstrated (Table 1). 3.1.5 Thermodynamics analysis Thermodynamics analysis was performed to investigate the effect of ambient temperature and assess the spontaneity of phosphate adsorption process by LPAP beads. The parameters such as Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) were obtained by the following equations: (3) Δ G 0 = − R T l n K 0 (4) ln K 0 = Δ S 0 R − Δ H 0 R T where K 0 (L/g) represents the constant related to the equilibrium state (K 0 = q e /C e ); and ΔH° and ΔS° can be determined by the slope and intercept of plot lnK 0 vs 1/T (Fig. S2). The obtained ΔG° value was negative and decreased from −0.2283 to −1.596 with the increase of temperature (from 293 K to 313 K), suggesting that phosphate uptake process is spontaneous in nature and more thermodynamically favorable at higher system temperature (Zhang et al., 2019b). Besides, ΔH° and ΔS° were respectively calculated as 19.86 kJ/mol and 68.69 J/(mol·K) (Table S2). Accordingly, the positive ΔH° value indicated endothermic character of phosphate uptake on LPAP beads, while that of ΔS° confirmed the affinity between phosphate and LPAP beads and the randomness at the liquid-solid interface of them (Kumar et al., 2019)."
9,Reusability analysis,"3.2 Reusability analysis The reusability performance of adsorbent is essential to evaluate its practical application potential. Given that phosphate adsorption process was entirely inhibited when solution pH was lower than 2 (Section 3.1), strong acidic condition might be conducive to the desorption process of phosphate loaded LPAP beads. In this study, LPAP beads after phosphate loading were desorbed using HCl solution (0.1 M) as the eluent. As seen in Fig. 3d, LPAP beads achieved a slightly increased phosphate uptake (from 10.7 to 11.3 mg/g) after first cycle, indicating thorough phosphate elution and successful regeneration by cross-linking with La (Ⅲ). Actually, phosphate uptake from eutrophic water in conjunction with phosphate elution for nutrients could alleviate the increasing demand of phosphorus fertilizer in agricultural production (Tan and Lagerkvist, 2011). Moreover, LPAP beads still exhibited excellent phosphate removal after five cycles, with nearly no capacity loss observed. Hence, the superior reusability along with easy elution demonstrated certain potential of LPAP beads for the sustainable development of water resources."
10,Characterization analysis,"3.3 Characterization analysis 3.3.1 SEM-EDS analysis SEM was applied to investigate the surface morphologies of LPAP beads (Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 4g, the prepared LPAP beads exhibited bead-like shape, the particle size distribution (Fig. S3) and average diameters (∼4.44 mm) were obtained by Nano measurer software. The image from the cross-section of LPAP beads (Fig. 4a) proved its rough surface with the interconnected porous structure, which was attributable to the uneven crosslinking of La3+ with -COO- of SA (Luo et al., 2019). Besides, the pore size distribution curve (Fig. S4(b)) demonstrated that LPAP beads mainly possessed mesoporous and macroporous structure. Interestingly, the highly porous structure of LPAP beads might help reduce the diffusion resistance of adsorbate and facilitate its distribution towards active sites (Sun and Fugetsu, 2014). PAL particle was found to be immobilized in the SA/PVA matrix (Fig. 4b), possibly enhancing the mechanical strength of hydrogel as a reinforcing filler. Herein, the compressive strength of PVA/SA hydrogel with or without the introduction of PAL was also compared. Specifically, the compressive strength of PVA/SA hydrogel and PVA/SA/PVA hydrogel were respectively determined as 122 ± 15 kPa and 164 ± 9 kPa, further demonstrated the enhancement of mechanical strength by PAL. In addition, the surface morphologies after phosphate capture were also detected. As seen, no obvious structure change was observed (Fig. 4d), while numerous sediments appeared in the plane surface of inner pores (Fig. 4e). The observation at larger magnification indicated that these sediments might be assigned to the crystalline LaPO4, as confirmed in XRD analysis as below. The result of EDS analysis implied successful phosphate uptake as well (Fig. 4h and i). 3.3.2 XRD analysis The crystallographic information of samples (PAL, synthetized LPAP hydrogel and phosphate adsorbed LPAP) was detected through XRD pattern (Fig. 5 ). As seen, quartz (PDF# 83–0539) and dolomite (PDF# 75–1762) were the main crystallographic phases of raw PAL (Kong et al., 2018), with the existence of other crystalline phases due to its low purity. Specifically, the characteristic peaks of dolomite were detected at 2θ = 30.9, 41.1, 44.9, 50.5 and 59.8°, respectively corresponded to the reflections from (104), (11–3), (202), (018) and (21–2) planes of dolomite. The characteristic peaks of quartz at different diffraction angles (20.8, 26.6 and 36.5°) could be respectively assigned to the reflections from (100), (011), (110) planes of quartz. However, the intensity of these peaks dropped drastically in the XRD pattern of LPAP hydrogel, mainly due to the thorough blending of PAL with polymers. Strikingly, new characteristic peaks at 2θ = 14.5, 29.0 and 48.1° that respectively corresponded to the reflection from (100), (200) and (212) planes of LaPO4·xH2O were detected after phosphate uptake (Zhang et al., 2019a). This observation demonstrated successful capture of phosphate through the chemical interaction between phosphate and La active sites (Wu et al., 2019). 3.3.3 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra of PAL, PVA, SA, synthesized LPAP and phosphate adsorbed LPAP were presented in Fig. 6 . The analysis on the spectrum of raw PAL, PVA and SA was summarized in the Supporting Materials. In comparison with these pure materials, similar functional groups were found in the spectrum of synthetized LPAP hydrogel, whereas some details were worthy to be noticed. Typically, the blending process induced peak changes in the spectrum of LPAP hydrogel due to the intense interaction among different components. For instance, the –OH vibration peak shift to low wavenumber (from 3433 to 3398 cm−1), resulting from the destruction intermolecular hydrogen bonding of SA and the formation of hydrogen bonding between PVA and SA (Xu et al., 2020a). Besides, the newly-appeared peak at 526 cm−1 could be assigned to La–O bond, suggesting the chelation of La3+ with polymeric composite (Thagira Banu et al., 2018). Accordingly, each component (PVA, SA and PAL) successfully participated in hydrogel network formation. Moreover, the spectra of LPAP hydrogel before and after phosphate uptake were also compared. As seen, the appearance of new peak at 778 cm−1 that belonged to the P–O bond of H2PO4 − or HPO4 2− (Min et al., 2019) indicated successful loading of phosphate on LPAP hydrogel. Besides, the La–O bond at 526 cm−1 shifted to 514 cm−1 after phosphate adsorption, implying its vital role in phosphate capturing (Karthikeyan et al., 2019). In addition, noticeable peak shift of hydroxyl groups (from 3398 to 3410 cm−1) after phosphate uptake was detected, suggesting the interaction between phosphate and hydroxyl groups through ligand exchange (Shi et al., 2019). 3.3.4 XPS analysis To gain detailed insight into the interaction between phosphate and LPAP beads, XPS analysis was performed (Fig. 7 ). Wide scan XPS spectra proved the existence of P element after adsorption, with the P 2p spectrum located at 133.5 eV. The comparison with standard spectrum of KH2PO4 (∼134.0 eV) demonstrated obvious peak shift (∼0.5 eV) to lower binding energy, implying strong affinity between phosphate and LPAP beads and the formation of new phosphate complex (Wu et al., 2019). The spectrum of La 3d5/2 was compared to further probe the phosphate removal route (Fig. 7c). Specifically, two representative satellite peaks located at 838.5 eV and 835.4 eV were detected in the spectrum of virgin LPAP beads, while these doublet satellite peaks apparently shifted to higher energy level after adsorption. Indeed, above phenomenon was extensively reported, which might be attributable to the electron transfer from the valence band of the ligand atom to the 4f orbital of the La atom (He et al., 2017). Therefore, the obvious peak shift of La 3d5/2 spectrum indicated the intense interaction between La and phosphate, and could be explained as the result of the formation of La–O–P inner-sphere complex via ligand exchange (He et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2017). The observation on the O 1s spectrum also confirmed above results (Fig. 7d). As seen, three overlapped peaks that respectively corresponded to M-O (∼531.4 eV), M-OH (∼532.4 eV) and H2O (∼533.2 eV) (Kong et al., 2019) were allocated based on the different existed oxygen species. After adsorption, the decreased amount of M-OH from 44.5% to 29.4% further proved the removal route of replacing hydroxyl group by phosphate (Chen et al., 2020), which was in consistent with FTIR results above."
11,Adsorption mechanism,"3.4 Adsorption mechanism The results of FTIR, XRD and XPS confirmed that multiple mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange were involved in the phosphate removal by LPAP beads, which could suitably explain the pH sensitivity of the adsorption process (Section 3.1.1). Therefore, based on the combined analysis of experiments and characterization, the possible removal mechanisms were proposed in Scheme 2 . At acidic condition (pH 3–6), the surface of LPAP bead was protonated and positively charged (pHZPC = ∼6.1), thus the electrostatic attraction between active sites and phosphate anions contributed to the formation of out-sphere complex (Wu et al., 2019). Besides, the observed positive solution pH change (ΔpH) after phosphate uptake (Fig. 1b) indicated the crucial role of ligand exchange in phosphate uptake by LPAP beads (Zhang et al., 2012), which was further confirmed through zeta potential analysis. As seen in Fig. 1d, the pHZPC of phosphate loaded LPAP was determined as ∼5.7, which is lower than that of virgin LPAP beads (∼6.1). It is reported that the formation of outer-sphere complexation could not change the pHZPC due to no chemical reaction that could change the surface charge occurred (He et al., 2017). Hence the observed shift of pHZPC could be assigned to the accumulation of negative charge on the surface, and was typically considered as inner-sphere complexation phenomena through ligand exchange (Wu et al., 2017). Indeed, the protonation of lanthanum active sites could be presented as below: LPAP-La-OH + H+ = LPAP-OH2 +. Interestingly, –OH2 + was reportedly easier to be displaced from the metal binding sites than –OH at low pH, which could facilitate the ligand exchange process (Liu et al., 2013). Furthermore, the ratio of surface hydroxyl before and after adsorption was calculated in the range of 0.5–2.0 (∼1.51), suggesting the formation of both monodentate and bidentate inner-sphere complexation (He et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Under alkaline condition, negatively charged surface of LPAP beads was identified due to the deprotonation process, thus the electrostatic repulsive force between La–O- and phosphate was operative. In this case, the phosphate removal route of ligand exchange was weakened as well, causing the decrease of ΔpH. Therefore, the remained phosphate uptake under alkaline condition could be mainly assigned to Lewis acid-base interaction mechanism that La active sites react with oxygen anion in phosphate by forming La–O coordination (Liu et al., 2013). Actually, La also exhibited specific affinity towards oxyanions in phosphate due to its Lewis acidic property (Wu et al., 2019), which rendered the relatively stable phosphate removal under alkaline condition."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, eco-friendly lanthanum cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol/alginate/palygorskite hydrogel (LPAP) was successfully prepared using La (Ⅲ) as the cross-linker. The introduction of palygorskite into polymer matrix was found to improve the mechanical strength and enhance selective phosphate capture. Batch experiments indicated that LPAP hydrogel achieved satisfactory phosphate removal at the pH range of 3–6, with the maximum phosphate uptake of ∼33.2 mg/g at pH 4. Besides, efficient phosphate removal (close to 100%) was maintained by LPAP beads in the co-existence of competing anions (Cl−, NO3 − and SO4 2−), indicating its potential application for phosphate removal from complex aqueous system. Kinetic and isotherm study demonstrated the multi-layer coverage and chemisorption of phosphate, and the reusability of LPAP beads was confirmed through sorption-desorption cyclic experiments. All evidences derived from experiments and characterization illustrated the main phosphate removal route of electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange at acidic environment, whereas Lewis acid-base interaction mechanism dominated at alkaline condition. Overall findings along with the intrinsic merits such as biocompatibility, low-cost and easy-separation highlighted the eco-friendliness and sustainability of LPAP hydrogel, and its potential applicability in the treatment of eutrophic water."
