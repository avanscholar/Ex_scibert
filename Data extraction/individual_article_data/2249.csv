0,Introduction,"The cases concerning the limitations on the harmful pollutant norms, fluctuations of the petroleum-based fuels’ prices, consuming reserves of fossil-based fuels, and increase of the environmental consciousness have mightily directed to the researchers in an effort to seek clean, sustainable, and alternative energy resources [1–3]. Regrettably, it has been predicted that the known reserves of fossil-based fuels all over the world are going to run out entirely in near future [4–6]. Nevertheless, fossil-based fuels have been intensely employed in the powering of internal combustion engines (ICEs). Moreover, more than 80% of the primary energy demand in the world has been supplied from fossil-based fuels for several decades, and this percentage has been increasing progressively [7,8]. Essentially, it has been indicated that the presence of fossil-based fuels for the intimate forthcoming is another question in humankind. For that reason, the importance and popularity of the examinations on the alternative fuel candidates for ICE applications have been ascending day by day [9]. Obviously, the expression of alternative fuel designates any fuel which possesses the potency to be assessed as a substitute for fossil-based fuels in the sector of transportation. The basic specifications desired from the feasible alternative fuels are as follows: they should have high energy content, they have to be store with ease, and they should burn smoothly releasing lesser harmful pollutants to the atmosphere. Meanwhile, there are available particular kinds of fuels that are not originated from fossil-based fuels, nonetheless, they can ensure preferable combustion behaviours than that of fossil-based fuels. They are known as gas fuels, alcohols, and synthetic liquid fuels [10–14]. Amongst the above-mentioned alternative and sustainable fuels, alcohols which are also known as bio-alcohols for ICEs have high potency for both traditional gasoline and DFs [15]. It is well-known that alcohols are of bio-based renewable energy sources and they can be utilized as oxygenated fuel additives because they have oxygen atoms in their chemical structures [16–18]. Therefore, alcohols have provided potential in an effort to decrease the pollutants emitted from the ICEs [19–21]. Besides that, the utilization of bio-alcohols as alternative and clean fuels has been appealing to ascending interest, particularly as alcohols can be synthesized from non-food feedstocks [22]. Nowadays, researchers have paid attention towards the utilization of higher-order alcohols (from three carbons to twenty carbons) in order to replace DF as they possess closer physicochemical specifications oncoming those of DF in contrast to the corresponding properties of lower-order alcohol types [23–28]. The higher-order alcohols described as long-chain alcohols having a high molecular weight and carbon atoms of more than three atoms. The higher-order alcohols cover butanol (C4H9OH), pentanol (C5H11OH), hexanol (C6H13OH), heptanol (C7H15OH), octanol (C8H17OH), decanol (C10H21OH), and up to phytol (C20H39OH) [23]. According to the previously conducted literature works, it could be clearly indicated that lower-order alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, etc., and higher-order alcohol such as butanol, pentanol, heptanol, etc. are commonly used types of alcohols in the traditional gasoline and DFs [29–32]. In addition to the aforesaid alcohols, n-octyl alcohol (also called n-octanol or 1-octanol) is becoming apparent as a considerable biofuel convenient with diesel technology having key characteristics such as boiling point, cetane number, energy content, self-ignition temperature very closer to conventional DF [33,34]. This long-chain alcohol can be biosynthesized from lingo-cellulosic biomass raw materials devoid of annoying food-based resources employing 2-keto acid-based pathways [35] and utilizing engineered microbes such as Clostridium species [36] and Escherichia coli [37]. After bio-synthetic techniques so as to derive n-octanol from lingo-cellulosic biomass has commenced, the examinations regarding the n-octanol utilization in the CI engines have gained momentum [38]. Furthermore, Machado et al. [39] indicated a high efficiency of n-octanol by lengthening the pathway in the butanol synthesis. Julis and Leitner [40] emphasized that enhanced n-octanol yield was acquired in the case of using multi-functional catalysts. Xia et al. [41] found the maximum yield of n-octanol to be at 67% from lingo-cellulosic biomass feedstock implementing a productive catalytic system. n-octanol possesses a great deal of affirmative properties in comparison with fossil DF. The fundamental combustion researches have exhibited that the usage of n-octanol in the ICEs caused generating very low soot emissions [42–44] because n-octanol has an advantage of the oxygen concentration of 12.3% by weight. Since n-octanol has an unsurpassed miscibility property with fossil DF, it demonstrates an impeccable probability of substitution with DF by a comparatively higher percentage than methanol/ethanol (by up to 36%) inside of the mixture-wall restriction of 3.5% by wt. [33]. n-octanol is largely miscible in DF whereas both methanol and ethanol are hydrophilic, namely, there is phase separation when blended with conventional DF. Besides that, n-octanol does not corrode fuel pipelines attributable to its hydrophobic property [45]. n-octanol has lower vapour pressure and higher flash point than DF, thereby eliminating the fire hazards throughout the handling of fuel. In addition, n-octanol has excellent low-temperature characteristics than biodiesel fuels [37] meanwhile better spray characteristics than traditional DF [46]. It is to be clearly noted that n-octanol was initially preferred as a surfactant with the intention of connecting the short-chain alcohols with fossil DF for preventing the phase separation [47,48]. Indeed, n-octanol as an associate of alcohol family was generally employed in the ICE applications just like numerous other kinds of alcohols. As can be monitored in the previously performed studies presented in the current literature, n-octanol as a sustainable biofuel has been usually mixed with biodiesel or biodiesel/DF blends. In other words, there are only a few investigations reported the impacts of n-octanol in prominent concentrations as a renewable oxygenated fuel additive for CI engines to date."
1,Examination of the recent literature,"Predominantly, alcohols present excellent specifications on grounds of their high oxygen concentration [17,49,50] that might remarkably enhance the qualification of the combustion process that takes place in the cylinder. In other words, high oxygen amount in the tested fuel has led to encourage more complete combustion process and hence decline the pollutant grades [9,51,52]. The effects of n-octanol infusion into the DF, biodiesel, or biodiesel/DF mixtures on the performance, harmful pollutant levels, and combustion behaviours of the diesel engines at various engine operating conditions will be reported and discussed underneath in detail. One of the first studies concerning the n-octanol usage in the diesel engine was realized by McCormick et al. [53]. The researchers indicated that contemporaneous degradations in the particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions using 2% by weight of n-octanol with traditional DF in a two-stroke diesel engine. Octanol was monitored to grant a better NOx/PM trade-off portrays than that of soybean oil methyl ester in an identical percentage with DF. Also, an augmentation in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by 4% and some decrement in the CO emissions were found when using both n-octanol and soybean oil methyl ester. Heuser et al. [54] declared that PM emission was reduced up to 20 times by using neat n-octanol in a DI CI engine. In another study, Heuser et al. [46] researched the usage of di-n-butyl ether and 1-octanol in a single-cylinder CI engine. The researchers found from the tests that a decline in the smoke emissions by the ratio of one-fifth, and the particle number descended by 80%. Zhang et al. [55] investigated n-octanol/DF blends containing alcohol of 10%, 20%, and 30% on a volume basis with cetane rating enhancer in a heavy-duty diesel engine under a European stationary cycle. Results showed that the engine presented similar BTE values to DF, however, higher BSFCs. Deep et al. [56] experimented 10–40% by volume of n-octanol with DF under stock arrangements of a DI CI engine. The researchers highlighted to have occurred low NOX, CO, and smoke emissions when the proportions of alcohol increased in the blend. Hoppe et al. [57] scrutinized the pure n-octanol in a single-cylinder CI engine and they indicated that a better soot/NOX trade-off with respect to the engine loading conditions. Furthermore, the reduction in the PM emissions by 90% at partial loads was observed while it decreased by 33% under rated load. Kumar et al. [34] reported that the infusion of n-octanol into the DF led to prolonging the ID duration and occurred higher peaks of in-cylinder gas pressures (CPs) and rates of heat release. Besides that, the performed work presented that the performance of the tested engine made better with the addition of n-octanol. The experimental findings also verified that NOX and smoke emissions can be descended simultaneously with or without an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system. A recent examination performed by Zhang et al. [58] has demonstrated that the utilization of DF treated by octanol in the multi-cylinder engine caused better cold start performance. Recently, Phoon et al. [59] accomplished that the treatment of conventional DF with 1-octanol and diethyl succinate advanced the oxygen concentration of palm oil biodiesel blend (B5) and caused to acquire lower emission levels. Kerschgens et al. [44] studied the impacts of n-octanol/DF blends on the emissions and combustion characteristics of the CI engine. The results exhibited that very low NOX and smoke emissions were noted within the limits of Euro 6. On the other hand, an augmentation of unburned HC and CO emissions was observed. It was also notified that the duration of the ID ascended with using n-octanol blends in comparison with the neat DF. Gopal et al. [33] estimated the engine performance and harmful pollutant characteristics of a CI engine operating with n-octanol/DF blends involving 10%, 20%, and 30% by volume of n-octanol applying 3 × 3 full factorial design matrix using response surface methodology. In the analyses, the composition of blend, injection timing, and EGR ratios was considered important factors. With the aim of minimizing NOX, BSFC, and smoke opacity values, 20° crank angle (CA) before the top dead centre (TDC), 10% EGR, and 17% by volume of n-octanol addition to the DF were found to be the optimum conditions taking into account the desirability approach. De Poures et al. [38] studied the influences of fuel injection timing (2°CA advance and retard) and EGR (up to 30%) of tested DI diesel engine running on the 30% by volume of n-octanol in DF (OCT30) on the performance, combustion behaviours, and exhaust gas emissions. The experimental outcomes showed that the OCT30 test fuel exhibited an improved premixed combustion stage along with higher CPs and rates of heat release in comparison with the DF. BSFC of the OCT30 was calculated to be slightly higher at overall EGR rates. In addition, unburned HC and CO emissions for OCT30 were found to be lower than those of DF at all EGR rates and fuel injection timings. Devarajan et al. [60] investigated the influences of n-octanol percentages (10%, 20%, and 30% by volume) in the mustard oil biodiesel on the performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics at different engine loads. The experimental outcomes showed that n-octanol addition to the biodiesel reduced the CO and unburned HC emissions meanwhile a considerable reduction was monitored in the NOX emissions. Besides that, the n-octanol added biodiesel decreased the fuel consumption and an increase in the BTE. Moreover, the use of n-octanol as an oxygenated additive descended the ID and helped the combustion process. Nour et al. [61] compared the performance, harmful pollutants, and combustion behaviours of a CI engine operating with several higher-order alcohols (butanol, heptanol, and octanol)/DF blends at various engine loads (from 0% to 100% in steps of 25%) and at two different speeds (900 and 1500 rpm). The researchers concluded that octanol and heptanol addition to the DF led to becoming longer ID period in comparison with neat DF and butanol/DF blends. The BTE values for octanol and heptanol blends at low engine speed was found to be closer to the pure DF at most tested engine conditions. Smoke opacity and NOX emissions were decreased for all alcohol/DF blends as compared to DF while CO and unburned HC emissions were ascended."
2,The scope of the present paper,"To put it briefly, there is a limited number of researches investigating the employability of n-octanol as a sustainable and alternative biofuel in CI engines. For that reason, n-octanol can be taken into consideration as a novel alternative fuel instead of fossil-based fuels. In this framework, the number of works concerning the usability of n-octanol in the CI engines has to be turned in up. As a result, it is of grand significance that the above-mentioned new renewable fuel has the characterizations hoped from any alternative and sustainable fuel. Essentially, these anticipated specifications can be categorized under three subclasses. These are as follows: combustion characteristics, harmful exhaust pollutants, and engine performance indicators. In this present research, a comprehensive experimental study regarding the performance, emissions, and combustion behaviours of an unmodified CI engine powered by n-octanol/DF blends were presented and discussed in the light of the available literature. In this context, totally five different fuels (diesel fuel, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20) were experimented with as test fuel samples. The trials were carried out under a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm and at four distinct engine loadings (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) considering the steady-state conditions."
3,Materials and methods,
4,Description of the test equipments,"4.1 Description of the test equipments The combustion behaviours, harmful pollutants, and engine performance for the prepared test fuel samples were performed on the multi-fuel research engine testing setup. The experiments were carried out with the Kirloskar brand, a sing-cylinder with a swept volume of 661.45 cm3. In addition, the researched engine has the specifications of water-cooled and naturally aspirated. The test engine was coupled to a Baturalp Taylan brand eddy current dynamometer having a water cooling system. This device was used to vary loads of the engine and the level of the loading was arranged thanks to a control panel. Besides that, the compression ratio of 17.5/1, fuel injection timing of 23°CA before TDC, and nozzle opening pressure of 210 bar were kept stable during the experiments since these values are the original for the tested engine and supplied from the manufacturer of the engine. It is to be noted that there is no modification made on the tested engine. The basic characteristics of the tested engine were tabulated in Table 1 . The schematic view of the experimental rig was depicted in Fig. 1 . Each engine trial was carried out at a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm and also four different engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). An encoder (Kubler brand 8.KIS40.1361.0360 model) was installed to the crankshaft on account of monitoring the variation of CA, engine speed, and TDC as well. The encoder’s resolution is provided from the manufacturer to be as 1 deg. The other technical specifications are given as follows: Clamping/Synchro flange, 6 × 12.5 mm shaft, IP64 Logic level: RS422; Supply = 5 V DC Square wave O/P: A, A’, B, B’, 0, 0′Incr/turn: 360 PPR, Termination: 2 m long axial cable, Speed 5500 RPM with TDC pulse. For measuring the exhaust gas temperature, a K-type thermocouple was placed into the tailpipe. The accuracy of the used thermocouple is 1 °C. The exhaust gas emissions such as CO, CO2, NO, O2, and smoke opacity have been metered with the help of a Bosch brand Bea 550 model exhaust gas analyser. The technical specifications and error ranges of the exhaust gas analyser were tabulated in Table 2 ."
5,Experiments,"4.2 Experiments Firstly, the pieces of equipment to be used in the tests were calibrated before the beginning of the engine tests. Then, the pre-test stage has been carried out intending to monitor the working situations for the test engine. Subsequently, the time for the stabilization of the engine was comprehended and thereby the engine was stabilized for each test fuel specimen. Before recording the experimental data, the researched engine was run for approximately 15 min and it was kept waiting for the consistent data observation. All measurements were repeated thrice during the experimentations and then the average values of the measurements arithmetically were presented in the subsections of the Results and Discussion of the paper. The actual experiments were commenced after all deficiencies coincidences throughout the pre-trials had been eliminated. During the tests, the relative humidity and ambient temperature were noted to be at 30–35% and 15–20 °C, respectively. The lubricating oil temperature was kept between 80 °C and 90 °C. On the other hand, the Lab view-based “ICEngineSoft” combustion analysis package program was operated in an effort to monitor the combustion data and to examine the process of the combustion reaction in the present work. Besides that, a PCB Piezotronics brand S111A22 model pressure transducer was mounted into the combustion chamber of the tested engine. This device has a measuring range of 5000 psi with a precision of 1.0 mV/psi thanks to a low noise cable. Depending upon the variation of the CA, the rate of the apparent heat release (HRR) was estimated between the 0-720°CA for each engine cycle using the above-mentioned combustion analysis program. The apparent HRR portrays for each test fuel at various engine loading conditions were calculated based on the 1st law of thermodynamics considering the following equations. Meanwhile, the combustion data for each situation were recorded by computing a mean of a minimum of 100 engine cycles."
6,Calculations,"4.3 Calculations There is necessary to be acknowledged some assumptions while performing the analyses of the HRR. Within the present framework, it has been taken into consideration that the thermodynamic balance was ensured inside the combustion chamber throughout the process of the burning stage. By the way, instantaneous and unexpected fluctuations in the temperature, as well as pressure, were disregarded so as to increase the correctness of the combustion analyses. On the basis of the 1st law of thermodynamics, Eqs. (1) and (2) have been disclosed as given underneath [62]. (1) ∂ Q n ∂ θ = ∂ U ∂ θ + ∂ W ∂ θ (2) ∂ Q c ∂ θ - ∂ Q h ∂ θ = ∂ U ∂ θ + ∂ W ∂ θ where ∂ U ∂ θ indicates the variation in the internal energy of the system, ∂ Q n ∂ θ denotes the net energy, and ∂ W ∂ θ refers to the rate of work acquired from the system. ∂ Q c ∂ θ states the generated heat from the fuel thanks to combustion and ∂ Q h ∂ θ describes the heat transferred from combustion chamber to the wall of the engine cylinder by the means of in-cylinder gasses. In addition, the net heat release is equal to the work accomplish on the piston by internal energy replacement. In this perspective, the exchange of the internal energy and the work can be computed by implementing the Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively [63]. (3) ∂ U ∂ θ = m c v ∂ T ∂ θ (4) ∂ W ∂ θ = P ∂ V ∂ θ where P and V show the pressure and volume of the cylinder, respectively. Also, m , c v , and T designate the instantaneous mass in the cylinder, specific heat of gases at constant volume, and instantaneous temperature, respectively. It is to be notified that the working fluid inside the combustion chamber can be accepted to be as an ideal and it has typical thermodynamic characterizations during the tests, according to the presumption. In this regard, providing that the coefficient of R is considered to be fixed in the ideal gas equation and the derivation can be arranged as presented in between Eqs. (5) and (8) [12]. (5) ∂ Q n ∂ θ = P ∂ V ∂ θ + m c v ∂ T ∂ θ State equation; (6) PV = m R T (7) ∂ T T = ∂ V V + ∂ P P By differentiating Eq. (6) considering the CA, and rearranging it, the instantaneous temperature can be obtained as given in Eq. (8). (8) ∂ T ∂ θ = 1 mR P ∂ V ∂ θ + V ∂ P ∂ θ Thereafter, Eq. (8) was put in the suitable position of Eq. (5), ∂ Q n ∂ θ may be found as a compact form as represented below. (9) ∂ Q n ∂ θ = c v R + 1 P ∂ V ∂ θ + c v R V ∂ P ∂ θ The gas constant ( R ) is calculated to be the difference between c p and c v , namely R = c p - c v . The specific heat ratio ( γ ) is calculated to be as the ratio of c p and c v , namely γ = c p / c v [63]. To conclude, when the constants were put in Eq. (9), the apparent HRR would be estimated using Eq. (10) as follows [64–66]. (10) ∂ Q n ∂ θ = γ γ - 1 P ∂ V ∂ θ + 1 γ - 1 V ∂ P ∂ θ The cumulative heat release rate for each tested fuel specimen was calculated and discussed in this paper. It can be described as the integral of heat release along with a limited interval of CA. The cumulative heat release rate figures for test fuels were found applying the following formula [67,68]. (11) Q c = ∫ Q n = ∫ P γ γ - 1 ∂ V ∂ θ + V 1 γ - 1 ∂ P ∂ θ here, γ demonstrates the polytrophic constant and it was taken by constant to be as 1.35 in the present analyses. Furthermore, in the analyses, it was assumed during the engine experiments that there is no variation eventuated in the amount of the mass in the combustion chamber originated from the gas leakage in the valves and/or segments [12]. On the other hand, the rate of the pressure rise (PRR) can be identified by considering the first derivative of the cylinder gas pressure with respect to the CA [69]. In this study, the PRR diagrams for the researched engine powered by DF and its blends with n-octanol were computed by using the following formula. (12) PRR = ∂ P ∂ θ = p i - p i - 1 θ i - θ i - 1 The start of the fuel injection (SoI) point can be defined as the CA where the injector nozzle opens [70]. Throughout the initial stage of the combustion process, a negative HRR has been monitored because of the fuel vaporization in the period of the ID. After a few degrees, the HRR has approached the positive region and it represents the beginning of the combustion (SoC) reaction [68,71,72]. In this context, the duration of the ID (ID) can be calculated using Eq. (13) to be the difference between SoI and SoC [73,74]. (13) ID = θ CS - θ IN where θ CS refers to the CA at which the combustion reaction commences and θ IN indicates the original fuel injection timing and it was taken from the specifications of the supplier. In this study, the standard fuel injection timing was applied to be 23°CA before TDC. On the other hand, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) figures for all tested fuel samples at various engine loading conditions with a stable engine speed of 1500 rpm were taken into consideration on account of evaluating the engine performance depending upon the types of the fuel operated in the present examination. In this respect, Eqs. (14)–(17) were used to determine the BSFC and BSEC values [75–77]. (14) P e = 2 π ω T 1000 (15) T = F l (16) BSFC = m ̇ f P e (17) BSEC = m ̇ f . L H V P e where P e represents the effective engine power, ω shows the angular velocity, and T is the engine torque. The engine torque was calculated taking into account the force ( F ) and length of the arm ( l ). m ̇ f refers to the mass flow rate of the tested fuel specimens, and LHV expresses the lower heating value of the used fuels. By the way, Eq. (18) was also employed in order to detect the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) values in percentage in the current work [75]. (18) BTE = P e m ̇ f . L H V The ringing index (RIN) or commonly known as the ringing intensity was adopted from Soloiu and coworkers [78,79]. In this sense, the RIN parameters of the test fuel samples used in the present experiments were estimated taking into consideration Eq. (19) in an effort to interpret the tendency of the knock occurrence for the researched CI engine [67,80]. Wei et al. [81] have appraised the RIN characterization for the DI diesel engine even though it has been greatly recognized to be the basic indicator for the purpose of monitoring the knock tendency in the homogenous charge CI engines. Accordingly, a numerical derivative method has been executed to the recorded and filtered cylinder gas pressure data intending to determine the highest PRR values. One of the most prominent advantages of the RIN formula is assigned that it could be assessed with ease so as to observe the knock in the simulation of the test engine because some models may not receive oscillations having high-frequency [82]. (19) RIN = 1 2 γ β dP dt max 2 P max γ R T max In Eq. (19), β indicates a correlation constant. It varies depending on the geometry of the engine, however frequently 0.05 ms [82] has been taken in the analyses. dP dt max shows the highest rate of the pressure rise, P max refers to the highest cylinder gas pressure, T max is the maximum gas temperature inside the cylinder, and R expresses the universal gas constant."
7,Error analysis,"4.4 Error analysis An error analysis was implemented to the recorded experimental data acquired from the experiments. Notably, this analysis is of great significance for experimental works [83]. It is to be paid attention to the experimental studies that covered uncertainties and errors that have been originated as a consequence of the adjustments, native conditions, calibration of the setup, sensation stagger, accuracies of the testing equipment, and so on [84,85]. On this basis, the error analysis gives an opinion to the readers concerning the reliance and correctness grade of the experimental findings [86]. In order to compute the uncertainty showing up from the measuring process, the accuracies for each piece of testing equipment employed in the tests have to be noted. Keeping these in mind, the square root method suggesting by Holman [87] was used to calculate the uncertainty values. In this paper, the following Eq. (20) was implemented to estimate the uncertainty. (20) w R = ∂ R ∂ x 1 w 1 2 + ∂ R ∂ x 2 w 2 2 + ⋯ + ∂ R ∂ x n w n 2 1 / 2 In the above-mentioned formula, w R is the total uncertainty of the result and R is the uncertainty function. x 1 , x 2 , …., x n are the independent variables and their uncertainty values are designated to be as w 1 , w 2 , …, w n , respectively. Table 3 presents the uncertainty for the instruments used in the tested engine."
8,Test fuels,"4.5 Test fuels In the present examination, the engine experiments were performed using both conventional DF and different n-octanol/DF blends. With this objective, n-octanol was mixed at the proportions of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% with the neat DF. So that test fuels, abbreviated as OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20, were prepared. To supply the exact blending concentrations, the percentages of the components were measured with the help of a calibrated beaker having a precision of ± 0.5 mL. By the way, n-octanol/DF blends were volumetrically mixed with each other using a thermomagnetic mixer at 1000 rpm for 15 min. The prepared test fuel samples were settled in sealed glass containers at a dark medium to avoid contact with air. The n-octanol, sustainable next-generation higher-order alcohol, utilized as an oxygenated additive into the traditional DF in the current research was procured from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The assay of the used alcohol is ≥ 99.0%. The mineral DF was procured from a local petroleum station in Samsun, Turkey. Table 4 shows the significant physicochemical properties of the n-octanol and DF used in this study. Just before commencing the experiments, the prepared fuel blends were mixed again at room temperature, and hence it was guaranteed in order to acquire homogeneous fuel blends in the experiments. To estimate the physicochemical characteristics of the fuel blends, the equations proposed in the literature were used [88]."
9,Results and discussion,"In this study, the steady-state conditions were ensured throughout the experiments. Initially, the tested CI engine was powered by conventional DF with the aim of getting the reference data for the engine in this fuel. Afterward, n-octanol/DF blends, namely OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20, were tested to observe the influence of the higher-order alcohol addition to the DF on the engine performance, harmful pollutants, and combustion characteristics. The engine was operated at four dissimilar loading conditions such as 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% corresponding to the 5.45 Nm, 10.89 Nm, 16.33 Nm, and 21.79 Nm, respectively. Besides that, the speed of the engine was kept constant to be as 1500 rpm during all tests. Typically, as with other biofuel species, n-octanol also switched the key physical and chemical characteristics of the fuel kind which they mixed. It is to be noted that the above-stated fuel properties have exceedingly affected the performance, emissions, and combustion behaviours of the tested CI engine. Additionally, the present experimental investigation has high correctness taking into account the overall uncertainty that was calculated to be 2.60%. The combustion characteristics (CP, apparent HRR, ID period, etc.) harmful pollutants (O2, CO, CO2, NO, and smoke opacity), and engine performance indicators (BSFC, BSEC, BTE, and EGT) for each test fuel sample were meticulously studied in the following subsections. It can be highlighted that the experimental outcomes, as mentioned above, have been compared with unmodified DF in a view to a better understanding regarding the influence of the infusion of n-octanol into the DF."
10,Combustion behaviours,"5.1 Combustion behaviours This subsection presents the characteristics of the combustion process for the tested CI engine running on the mineral DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 at four different engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load) with the purpose of figuring out the mechanisms and processes of the reactions event in the combustion chamber of the engine where the fuel samples were burned on account of effectuating the heat energy that depending upon the physicochemical characterizations as well as the intermolecular structures in particular. In this regard, some of the remarkable combustion parameters such as CP diagrams and their peak values, the apparent HRR diagrams and their peak values, rate of the pressure rise, cumulative heat release rate, and the duration of the ID have been attentively investigated and discussed in the light of the findings presented in the available literature. 5.1.1 In-cylinder gas pressure The CP is one of the most remarkable parameters in order to understand the combustion phenomenon in ICEs. The CP that happened in the combustion chamber of a diesel engine is controlled by the quantity of fuel associating with the uncontrolled combustion phase [91,92]. Fig. 2 plots the effects of DF and its blends with n-octanol as a novel oxygenated fuel additive on the CP at the engine load of 100%. The timing of the fuel injection is provided from the supplier to be as 23°CA before TDC that is followed by the ID period and beginning of the combustion reaction inside the cylinder where is observed by the sharp increase in the pressure line approximately 6-7°CA before TDC [93]. Subsequently, the pressure in the combustion chamber progressively turns in up because of the heat supplement in the point of the premixed combustion stage and variation in the volume, as well. As anticipated, the minimum CP figures were obtained at the engine load of 25% for the reason that the engine was fuelled with the lowest quantity of fuel under this load. In other words, augmentation of the engine load caused to increase in the amount of the fuel in the combustion chamber and hence CP values were ascended for all tested fuel samples [94]. At full load, the highest in-cylinder pressure values for DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were recorded to be at 55.55 bar, 55.89 bar, 56.25 bar, 56.43 bar, and 56.57 bar, respectively. Moreover, as can be observed from Fig. 2 and Table 5 , no considerable variations amongst the maximum CP data for the tested fuel samples were determined at each operating condition. Expressly, the highest CPs were found to be closer to each other. Actually, n-octanol is subsidiary to diminish both lower heating value and cetane number of the tested fuel blends because n-octanol has a lower cetane number and energy content than mineral DF, as seen in Table 4. For that reason, a lesser cetane rating led to becoming extended duration for ID during the experiments in the fuel blends [91]. Accordingly, the surplus quantity of fuel piled up in the chamber of the combustion by virtue of prolonged ID period influences the enhancement in the maximum point steepness in the cylinder gas pressure and correspondingly attained higher CP along with the creation of the initial flame core inside the engine cylinder. On the other hand, as a matter of fact that tested fuel blends comprising n-octanol have lesser energy contents and have higher water content than those of unmodified DF brought about mitigating the altitude of the cylinder gas pressure as well as the highest CP. Besides that, extended period of the ID and higher oxygen concentration available in the chemical structure of the alcohols caused to higher maximum CP portrays at all engine loads with using n-octanol in the blends than neat DF. However, the reaction of the combustion was enhanced by improving the ability of the atomization process due to the smaller particle dimension of the injected n-octanol constituting test fuel samples in comparison with the traditional DF [95]. 5.1.2 Apparent heat release rate It is to be noted that both CP and apparent HRR coming from the combustion analyses deliver considerable hints regarding the combustion behaviours of the CI engine running on different fuel types [12]. In this context, Fig. 3 plots the influence of mineral DF with/without n-octanol on the apparent HRR at engine loading of 100%. It is well-known that the HRR outcomes for the test fuel are affected by some basic parameters such as ID period, cetane number, and duration of the fuel injection [96]. In conclusion, the HRR values for each test fuels ascended with regards to the increase in the load of the engine. The maximum apparent HRR figures at the load of 100% for DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were estimated to be as 27.73 J/deg, 29.76 J/deg, 30.28 J/deg, 30.65 J/deg, and 31.39 J/deg, respectively. As mentioned above, the cetane rating of the n-octanol is lesser than that of conventional DF. For that reason, the ID period of n-octanol including tested fuel blends became longer than that of neat DF. That is to say that the combustion reaction of pure DF commenced earlier as compared to the n-octanol/DF blends, as seen in Fig. 3. Correspondingly, more fuel accumulation was occurred in the combustion chamber during the extended duration of the ID and further abruptly burns [97,98]. In addition, an excessive amount of oxygen content in the n-octanol incentivizes the enhancement in the quality of the combustion reaction [12]. As a consequence, it is evident from the graph that n-octanol added fuels gave higher peak figures at all engine loading conditions in a view to the apparent HRRs and CPs in contrast to the neat DF. The aforementioned event can be plainly observed in Table 5. Along with the change of energy content and cetane number of the test fuels, commencing of the combustion reaction, duration of the combustion process, ID period, highest CP, highest apparent HRR, and even the amount of injected fuel has been precisely affected. For instance, the increment in the quantity of the injected test fuel into the combustion chamber of the engine when the engine load rose. Therefore, this led to moving away from the maximum CP figure from the top dead centre. The obtained findings were compatible with the following studies performed by various researchers [17,99,100]. In addition, Table 5 presents numerical values of how to vary the above-stated parameters with respect to the fuel types and engine loads. In Table 5, ID, SOC, maximum HRR (HRRmax) and its angle (AHRRmax), maximum cumulative heat release rate (CHRRmax) and its angle (ACHRRmax), maximum in-cylinder pressure (CPmax) and its angle (ACPmax), maximum mean gas temperature (MGTmax) and its angle (AMGTmax), and maximum pressure rise rate (PRRmax) and its angle (AIPmax) were given for each test fuel at different engine loads. 5.1.3 Cumulative heat release rate Fig. 4 illustrates the change in the cumulative heat release rate values for each tested fuel sample between the CA difference of 300° and 510°CA in an engine cycle under full engine loading conditions. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the cumulative heat release rate values at full load for unmodified diesel fuel, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were calculated using Eq. (11) to be as 985 J, 1010 J, 1025 J, and 1180 J, respectively. The reduction in the cetane rating of the n-octanol containing test fuel blends, as seen in Table 4, led to occurring a higher proportion of combustion process at a fixed volume in which augmented the cumulative heat release rate. Another ground for monitoring a higher cumulative heat release rate can be the larger amount of oxygen atoms in the test fuels because n-octanol has 12.41% oxygen content in the chemical structure. This resulted in enhanced efficiency of the combustion reaction inside the cylinder, which was confirmed by Yanfeng and co-workers [101]. 5.1.4 The rate of the pressure rise In Fig. 5 , the effects of n-octanol addition into the DF on the rate of the pressure rise with respect to the CA at dissimilar engine loads with a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm were displayed separately. It is pronounced from Table 5 that the rate of the pressure rise increased appertaining to the ascending of the engine load. A similar reason was reported by Shrivastava et al. [102] who indicated that a rise in the ratio of the compression and engine load led to becoming higher outcomes in the rate of the pressure rise. The rate of the pressure rise, which is a too momentous parameter that cannot be neglected, has been used to analyse the generation of knocking in any ICE. Besides that, it implies a high level in the formation of nitrogen oxides released from the engine [103]. To conclude, in the present experimental study, the peak results in the rate of the pressure rise were achieved under the full loading condition to be at 3.73 bar/deg (33.57 bar/ms) for conventional DF, 3.82 bar/deg (34.38 bar/ms) for OCT5, 3.86 bar/deg (34.74 bar/ms) for OCT10, 3.90 bar/deg (35.10 bar/ms) for OCT15, and 3.96 bar/deg (35.64 bar/ms) for OCT20. It can be even so highlighted that there is no obvious change in the highest rate of the pressure rise values with the treatment of traditional DF with n-octanol as an oxygenated next-generation bio-alcohol. However, an excessive amount of alcohol infusion into mineral DF caused to increase the rate of the pressure rise on account of the improving the combustion characterizations thanks to higher amount of oxygen concentration in the CI engines. 5.1.5 Ringing index The ringing process accommodating a dense grade brings about taking place a higher noise in the combustion in the cylinder and therefore it can effectuate damages on some of the engine components. For that reason, the ringing index is one of the respectable parameters for the engine. In this sense, it is to be evaluated the ringing index in the combustion analyses of an engine in the name of the fact that it points out the combustion noise in the engine. In this scope, Fig. 6 portrays the influences of n-octanol addition to the mineral DF on the variation of the ringing index at several engine loads with a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. It has been addressed in the latest published paper that the level for the ringing index should be lower than 5 MW/m2, leading to happening an appropriate combustion noise accompanying knock-free operation [104]. It is to be concluded in the current experimental study that the aforesaid limit has been assumed to be an upper frontier for unfavourable combustion process in the cylinder. Additionally, it can be marked that the ringing index has pertained to the maximum rate of the pressure rise, speed of the engine, and peak CP [105]. As observed inFigure6, the increase in the engine load resulted in the growth of the ringing index values for all of the tested fuel samples. The present analysis exhibits that the highest ringing index figures were calculated to be at 2.36 MW/m2 for DF, 2.50 MW/m2 for OCT5, 2.52 MW/m2 for OCT10, 2.58 MW/m2 for OCT15, and 2.64 MW/m2 for OCT20. As would be expected, the peak ringing index values were taken shape when the tested engine was run on under the 100% loading operating assignable to the higher HRR figure formed at the higher loads [79]. To sum up, overall results were met to be lesser than the above-highlighted admissible limit value."
11,Performance characteristics,"5.2 Performance characteristics The performance indicators of the tested CI engine have been investigated thanks to the evaluation of some considerable parameters such as brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). In the following paragraphs, the aforenamed parameters have been meticulously discussed for all of the test fuels considering the latest published papers. 5.2.1 Brake specific fuel consumption The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) has been addressed to be as the quantity of the needed fuel with the aim of producing 1 kW of power in an hour interval. That is to say that it explains the output of the used fuel in ICEs [106]. In this regard, the BSFC can be computed taking into account the mass fuel consumption and effective engine power. By the way, the BSFC is inversely commensurate with the BTE for employed fuels [107]. Under these circumstances, the BSFC has a vital factor in the selection of any fuel to be assessed in the engine. The variation in the BSFC values for DF and its several blends with n-octanol with regards to the engine loads was presented in Fig. 7 . It can be reported that there are a few researchers who have examined the usage of n-octanol as a sustainable oxygenated fuel additive or direct fuel in CI engine applications. Evaluating with a view to the calorific value, alcohol-based fuels have lesser than conventional DF. Actually, the mass of the burned fuel is nearly 1.5–1.7 times higher for alcohol-based fuels so as to obtain the identical power output [108]. This case could be confirmed when Table 4 was taken into consideration, namely the lower heating values of DF and n-octanol are 43.25 MJ/kg and 37.53 MJ/kg, respectively. Depending upon the increased concentration of n-octanol in the fuel blend, the energy content reduced regularly. This is due to the linear relation concerning components of the test fuels [88]. As can be observed in Fig. 7, the BSFC figures augmented when the n-octanol was mixed with the mineral DF at increased proportion. On account of attaining the same engine loads during the experiments, over fuel has been sent into the combustion chamber because of increasing of the mixing ratio in the fuel blends. Hereby, this is the reason that the maximum BSFC was monitored when the engine fueled with OCT20 whereas the minimum BSFC was in the neat DF under the same loads. The BSFC results for all tested fuel samples displayed an identical propensity and subsequently arrived at the lowest value at full load of the engine. In comparison within view of the preferred engine loads, the peak BSFC values for all tested fuels were formed at 25% engine load. From now on, there was a slight reduction in relation to the same fuel specimen under the engine loads of 50%, 75%, and 100% in terms of other tested fuels. This is presumably owing to the generation of low brake power at the load of 25%. This event has been comprehensively clarified by most of the researchers in the literature. As stated by Sayin and Canakci [109], for instance, the basis why BSFC increased depending on the rising of the loads could be that the augmented ratio of the engine power was over than that of consumed fuel as the load increased. Besides that, similar findings with reasons were pointed out by various researchers [12,110,111]. 5.2.2 Brake specific energy consumption Fig. 8 exhibits the variation of BSEC levels with respect to the studied engine loads for all the fuels tested. As would be anticipated, the BSEC results reduced with ascend of load since similar trends were also observed in the BSFC results, as stated above. Further, the BSEC values are compatible with the opposite profile of the BTE. It is to be notified that the BSEC values for unmodified DF were calculated to be the least amongst all tested fuel samples because of its higher energy content (see Table 4). Furthermore, the BSEC was ascended with the increase in the n-octanol concentration of neat DF. This was due to the lesser energy content and hence higher BSFC figures together with the poor atomization properties, longer duration in the ID, and higher flash point [112,113]. 5.2.3 Brake thermal efficiency On the other hand Fig. 9 , shows the change in the BTE values for n-octanol/DF blends as well as neat DF across the engine load. The BTE has been generally referred to be as the conversion yield of the used fuel in the engine. Also, it is a key factor for beneficial power produced from the fuel’s chemical energy [89]. The following parameter can be counted as the major factor that influences the BTE of a diesel engine: compression ratio, fuel injection timing, injection pressure, air–fuel ratio, and most remarkably the energy content of the used fuel [114]. As mentioned above, a similar however opposite tendency with the BSFC under each engine load was obtained in the BTE results due to the same grounds. In this context, the high energy efficiency obtained from the test engine points out a preferable fuel economy along with a conversion efficiency from the test fuel. As seen, there is a common increment in the BTE figures with the enhancement of engine load from 25% to the full load. This case can be ascribed to the augmentation of engine power when the load was turned in up. Amongst the test fuels, the BTE of neat DF was found to be the highest at all engine loads meanwhile the addition of higher-order alcohol into the DF resulted in diminishing the BTE values progressively. In other words, OCT20 has the minimum BTE figures at all engine loads. This is due to the lower energy content of the n-octanol than that of DF, as presented in Table 4. Silitonga et al. [115], for instance, notified a compatible outcome in the BTE when they tested the biodiesel/DF blends with adding bioethanol. The researchers highlighted that the lower energy content of alcohol led to serving lesser BTE. 5.2.4 Exhaust gas temperature With the intention of making a better and understandable discussion, it is of great emphasis to detect the EGT since it provides an opinion concerning the generation of the harmful pollutants emitted from the engine. Along with it, the EGT is a severe indication of the temperature at the post-combustion phase for the tested fuels [12]. The EGT changes with respect to the fuel specifications (like viscosity, calorific value, cetane number, density, etc.), and engine working situations (like compression ratio, fuel injection pressure and timing, etc.) [116]. Fig. 10 presents the change on the EGT values of DF and its blends with n-octanol across the engine load. It is evident from the graph given underneath that the EGT jumped in high with the ascending load, as would anticipate. This fact is attributable to the required amount of consumed fuel rose due to reach the high loads [117]. From the graph, the highest EGT measurements were occurred to be as 229.94 °C for DF, 227.48 °C for OCT5, 223.36 °C for OCT10, 221.27 °C for OCT15, and 215.83 °C for OCT20, respectively. The corresponding minimum EGT values were found to be at 169.62 °C, 167.59 °C, 164.95 °C, 161.97 °C, and 158.44 °C, respectively. On the other hand, the EGT figures reduced with the increase of n-octanol concentration in the fuel blend caused by the higher water content and lower energy content of n-octanol than those of DF, as seen in Table 4. Plainly, the maximum EGT results were measured when the engine was operated with neat DF at all engine loads. Furthermore, the high latent heat of vaporization of higher-order alcohol-containing test fuel blends led to decreasing the combustion temperature resulting from the injected fuel into the engine cylinder by absorbing more heat and hence the EGT has been slightly declined. This event might be expressed to be as the final temperature of the combustion process when the CI engine powered by the tested fuels which possess high oxygen content in the chemical structure and low calorific value due to the alcohol-based fuel infusion. Therefore, the maximum temperatures were recorded with the highest load and the highest energy content fuel, that is, pure DF. Suhaimi et al. [1], for example, encountered that the treatment of DF with long-chain alcohol (2-ethyl 1-hexanol alcohol) resulted in mitigation on the EGT values slightly especially at lower engine loads. Li et al. [118] found that the lesser EGT values were measured when a single-cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine that was a newly developed by researchers fueled with alternating alcoholic fuel. Ağbulut et al. [12] noticed the lower EGT values when addition fusel oil (isoamyl alcohol) into the DF at all engine loads."
12,Harmful pollutant characteristics,"5.3 Harmful pollutant characteristics In the evaluation of alternative fuels that can be used in ICEs, it should be considered in recent days as a necessity to carefully examine their contribution to environmental pollutants. These pollutants are capable of posing enormous threats to both environmental pollution and living life. It is important that the fuel to be used as an alternative fuel can primarily eliminate environmental concerns. In these frameworks, the following subsections have given a comparative analysis for several harmful pollutant factors such as nitrogen monoxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke opacity. 5.3.1 CO emissions The carbon monoxide (CO) emission is an important indication delivering an opinion about the incomplete combustion reaction in the cylinder. It generates during the combustion reaction because of the shortage of oxygen molecules and the duration of the combustion process. In other words, if there is an insufficient amount of oxygen atoms in the combustion chamber, the fuel oxidation process slows down, and hence more CO is generated amongst the harmful pollutants [119–122]. On the other hand, the decreased temperature restricts the oxidation process between the carbon and oxygen molecules throughout the combustion process [123]. Fig. 11 illustrates the change in the CO emissions for tested fuels in relation to the engine loads. As can be clearly seen from the following graph, the CO emissions were declined when the CI engine was fueled with the binary blends of n-octanol and DF in contrast to the pure DF at all engine loads. Accordingly, the minimum CO emission values were recorded using the OCT20 fuel blend in each load. This event can be explained to be as the higher oxygen content of n-octanol, as presented in Table 4. For the purpose of reaching higher engine loads, the amount of injected fuel type to the combustion chamber ascended. Considering this case, the CO emissions decreased with the increase in the engine load from 25% to the full load. The maximum CO emissions were measured to be 0.139% for DF, 0.125% for OCT5, 0.121% for OCT10, 0.113% for OCT15, and 0.109% for OCT20. Nanthagopal et al. [124] pointed out that the infusion of higher-order alcohol (decanol) improved the total oxygen concentration inside the cylinder, leading to a decrease in the CO emissions. Another reason for low CO emission from the CI engine was reported by Ashok et al. [94] who indicated that the lower C/H ratio of alcohol with respect to the DF resulted in lowering the CO emission during the combustion process. 5.3.2 NO emissions The oxides of nitrogen (NOX) is a common expression for nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen dioxide (N2O2), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5). However, more than 90% of NOX emitted from a CI engine is known to be NO gas [59]. The NO has been taking into consideration as the most detrimental exhaust gas for diesel engines and therefore it can be mitigated by applying convenient techniques. As well-known, the NO generates by the reaction of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in case of the temperature reaches approximately 1800 K inside the combustion chamber. The formation of NO has been influenced by such factors as air/fuel ratio, compression ratio, temperature, fuel injection pressure, engine speed, and load [12,125,126]. Fig. 12 demonstrates the NO emission levels with regards to the engine load for DF with/without n-octanol as an oxygenated fuel additive. It is evident from the graph that the NO was dropped depending upon boosting the mixing ratio of n-octanol in the fuel blends at all engine loads. The high concentration of oxygen molecule in the n-octanol caused to improve the combustion efficiency serving more complete combustion reaction inside the cylinder and hence NO emission was affected from the above-stated case [124,127]. The maximum NO emissions for DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were found to be at 379 ppm, 582 ppm, 577 ppm, 537 ppm, and 503 ppm, respectively. On the other hand, the higher water content and lesser energy amount of n-octanol than those of conventional DF also coped with so as to diminish the generation of the NO emission during the combustion reaction. In addition, the high latent heat of vaporization characteristic of alcohol-based fuels together with the high moisture content retracts the heat from the combustion chamber and declines the post-combustion temperature [49,118]. To conclude, the aforesaid specifications retarded the reaction capability between oxygen and nitrogen molecules. Besides that, the increase in both combustion end temperature (as given in Section 3.2.4) and the NO emissions (as illustrated in Fig. 12) were happened depending on the boosted amount of sprayed fuel with the increase in the engine load [12]. By the way, NOX emissions are the most harmful pollutant. For this reason, the mitigation of it holds leading importance in engine research. Balamurugan and Nalini [128], for instance, experimented with DF containing 4% and 8% n-propanol and n-butanol having high latent heat of vaporization and less energy content in a CI engine. They concluded that the aforementioned fuel characteristics caused decreasing the operating temperature which in turn descended the NOX emissions as compared to pure DF. 5.3.3 O2 emissions One of the most remarkable factors is the content of oxygen molecules in the engine cylinder on account of occurring a more complete combustion reaction inside the combustion chamber of the engine. The O2 emissions for different n-octanol/DF blends as well as pure DF according to the engine loads were shown in Fig. 13 . As can be observed from the graph, the highest O2 emission values were measured under the minimum operating conditions for all tested fuel samples meanwhile the O2 emissions were progressively declined to depend upon the increase of the engine load. In this context, the lowest O2 emissions for traditional DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were found to be at 16.14%, 16.32%, 16.55%, 16.62%, and 16.71%, respectively. Since n-octanol has an excessive amount of oxygen atoms in their chemical bounds at a specific fraction (as presented in Table 4), the amount of the O2 emissions jumped up with the integration of n-octanol and DF at different percentages. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no previously conducted work regarding the O2 emission alteration of n-octanol treated DF. On the other hand, the former research of the first author and his co-workers [129] has pointed out that the infusion of two different long-chain alcohols (such as 1-butanol and n-pentanol) into the yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel/DF blends by 5% and 10% for creating ternary blends led to boosting the O2 emission levels. Aydin and Öğüt [130] monitored in their experimental research that the treatment of biodiesel/DF blends with bioethanol caused the formation of higher O2 emissions as compared to pure DF. Yesilyurt [131] tested different binary and ternary blends of DF, peanut oil biodiesel, and 1-heptanol in his experimental study in order to investigate the tested fuels on the combustion, emissions, and performance characteristics. As a result, the researcher observed higher O2 emission levels using 1-heptanol/DF blends at all engine loads due to the presence of the native oxygen molecules in the alcohol’s atomic structure. 5.3.4 CO2 emissions Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is linked to the complete combustion process of the test fuel in the ICEs [132]. In addition, when the fuels having carbon molecules in their atomic bonds are burned, the CO2 gas eventuates as a combustion end product. As stated above, it occurs due to the higher post-combustion temperature. This is to say that the availability of an adequate amount of oxygen atoms in the combustion chamber to achieve a more complete reaction enhances the concentration of CO2 emissions released from the exhaust to the atmosphere. In this context, with the assistance of a sufficient amount of oxygen, the hydroxyl radical OH (one of the basic oxidizing ingredients) converts the CO to the CO2 gas [24,91]. Fig. 14 illustrates the CO2 emission measurements of all tested fuel samples as a function of engine loadings. It is prominent in the graph that the increment in the load led to increasing the CO2 emission levels. These augmentations above-stated in the CO2 emission figures can be related to the ascend in the BTE with a rise in the loading. Amongst the tested fuels, OCT20 emitted the highest CO2 emissions at all engine loads meanwhile DF released the least CO2 emissions. This can be clarified to be as the higher calorific value of DF, improved BTE, and even atomization specifications of the fuel lead to a reduction in the CO2 emissions [133]. By the way, n-octanol because of its native oxygen atoms in its chemical structure reacts easily with CO and eventuates CO2 gas and thereby it has a considerable influence on the generation of CO2 gas. Besides that, the emission levels of CO2 at 100% engine load operating conditions for pure DF, OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 were measured to be at 2.71%, 2.85%, 2.87%, 2.93%, and 2.98%, respectively. It can be recommended considering the aforementioned CO2 characteristics that n-octanol doped fuel blends can be evaluated as a remarkable oxygenated and sustainable duel additive on account of combating global warming all over the world instead of pure DF. It should be remembered again that octanol can be produced from ligno-cellulosic biomass feedstocks. Ramesh et al. [112], for instance, used hexanol as oxygenated long-chain alcohol in the Calophyllum Inophyllum methyl ester/DF blends at various concentrations. As a result, because of inherent oxygen molecules of hexanol, CO gas reacted with them and hence CO2 emissions occurred. Cheung et al. [123] in their experiments on DF treated with dodecanol and ethanol in a CI engine indicated similar trends to the outcomes stated above. 5.3.5 Smoke opacity emissions The smoke opacity emission is a consequence of the uncompleted combustion process and is brought about by the deficiency of oxygen molecule along with the existence of a fuel-rich region in the burning chamber in case of the combustion reaction [94]. Fig. 15 depicted the change in the smoke opacity levels for tested fuel specimens at various engine loading conditions. It is pronounced from Fig. 15 that smoke emissions were increased with the increase of engine loading on the grounds of the boosting of the consumed fuel with the load in order to produce higher engine power output at higher loads [34]. Amongst the test fuels, the highest smoke emissions were measure when the engine was fueled with conventional DF while the addition of n-octanol into the DF caused the reduction in the smoke opacity levels at all engine loadings. The lesser amount of smoke for n-octanol/DF blends can be assignable to the higher oxygen content approaches towards the more complete combustion inside the cylinder. In other words, the oxygen atoms attached to the n-octanol’s hydroxyl group drops the generation of smoke by hindering soot pioneers and ascends the presence of oxygen even in the fuel-rich regions [134,135]. For this reason, the smoke emissions diminished by boosting the n-octanol concentration in the fuel blends. In this regard, Hoppe et al. [57] obtained PM mitigation with the pure 1-octanol experimentation by nearly one-third of reference DF. Kumar et al. [34] achieved up to 32.03% reduction in the smoke opacity values by using OCT30 in comparison with DF."
13,The comparison of outcomes coming from the experiments with other works,"Table 6 summarizes the comparison of the experimental findings acquired from the current experimental study with other formerly performed higher-order alcohol examinations published in the literature by various researchers. Due to the limited number of investigations concerning the utilization of octanol/DF blends, the papers covering the CI engine powered by binary blends of other types of long-chain alcohols with conventional DF so as to achieve a better understanding of the present objective. As can be observed from Table 6, several types of higher-order alcohols such as butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, etc. as an oxygenated fuel additive have been studied by researchers. Considering the previously conducted researches, the present paper showed that the infusion of n-octanol into the DF for obtaining reformulated test fuel samples has caused to dropping the CO, NO, and smoke emissions meanwhile augmented the CO2 emission. Additionally, the combustion behaviours were well in agreement with those of other works. It is to be clearly noted that the experimental outcomes have pointed out the relevance of n-octanol as a sustainable and oxygenated next-generation fuel additive into the DF for CI engine applications without applying any modifications to the engine. By all means, it can be marked that numerous investigations have to be carried out by the researchers before approving the n-octanol as a fractional substitution for DF through the agency of the convenient procedures. These are as follows: the production of n-octanol from renewable raw materials implementing suitable techniques, dropping the production cost, handling, preservation, and so on."
14,Conclusions,"A detailed experimental scrutinization was performed on account of discussing the engine performance, harmful pollutants, and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, DI CI engine running on the conventional DF and its blends with n-octanol blends such as OCT5, OCT10, OCT15, and OCT20 at the steady-state conditions. The tested engine was powered by the aforesaid fuels at a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm with several engine loads ranging from 25% to full load in steps of 25%. The combustion behaviours of each tested fuel sample were examined in the directions of an apparent heat release rate, CP, cumulative heat release, rate of the pressure rise, duration of the ID, and the ringing index at the above-stated engine loadings. Besides, some of the exhaust gases like CO, CO2, O2, NO, and smoke opacity were measured and discussed for each tested fuel. In the point of the engine performance indicators, BSFC, BSEC, BTE, and EGT were evaluated in order to compare them with respect to various engine loads and tested fuels. It is to be noted that EGT, CP, and HRR analyses presented some considerable opinions concerning the mechanisms of the combustion reaction that takes place inside the cylinder, which brightened the pollutants and performance. Overall, some important outcomes have been addressed in the following section based on the experimental findings acquired in the present study: • n-octanol as a sustainable oxygenated fuel additive was blended with traditional DF up to 20% by volume and the prepared test fuels were experimented with in a CI engine without any modification on the test engine. • It was to be noted that the enhancement of the n-octanol percentage in the binary blends of it with DF was not influenced most of the physicochemical characteristics, however, slightly increased the kinematic viscosity and remarkably decreased the heating value and cetane number of the reformulated test fuels. • The combustion behaviours pointed out that the tested fuel samples with n-octanol turned in up the ID period. Obviously, the utilization of n-octanol/DF blends exhibited delayed the commencement of the combustion reaction in the cylinder for all tested fuel mixtures along with both the highest apparent heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure higher than those of unmodified DF. • The infusion of n-octanol into the DF converted to the reformulated oxygenated fuel type. Coherent with previously conducted researches, the CO emission release was considerably function of the oxygen molecules available in the fuels. In this context, n-octanol has higher oxygen concentration (12.41%) than that of DF. Consequently, the aforementioned specification of n-octanol supplied an unsurpassed capability on account of declining the CO emission down to between 4.28% and 11.67% on an average by using different fuel blends. • Notably, n-octanol addition into the DF provided substantial decrements in the NO emissions with the increase of the alcohol percentage in the test fuels up to 25.08%. It can be due to the high water content and latent heat of vaporization properties of n-octanol. These properties retracted the temperature in the combustion chamber and drastically led to decreasing the NO emissions. • Due to the higher oxygen content of the n-octanol, the combustion process reaches the nearly completed reaction, resulting in higher CO2 emissions up to 8.56% with respect to the DF. • When the engine performance indicators were examined, as would be hoped, unmodified DF had the highest BTE and lowest BSFC in comparison with the binary blends of n-octanol and DF at each engine load because of the higher calorific value of DF. It can be summarized that the n-octanol could be taken into consideration as a novel promising alternating sustainable bio-alcohol. n-octanol provided a remarkable enhancement in the combustion characteristics with lower harmful pollutants when it was mixed with DF out of severely affecting the engine performance at working conditions. As a result, the present experimental study has been indicating that n-octanol can be used to be as oxygenated alternating fuel additives without any modification on the engine. In future studies, various engine working conditions for n-octanol/DF blends should be performed in order to optimize and determine the best conditions for the above-researched alternative fuels. Thermodynamic, economic, and environmental analyses should also be applied for diesel engine running on n-octanol/DF blends."
