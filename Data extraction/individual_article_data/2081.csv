0,Introduction,"The development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts demands the optimization of catalyst activity, selectivity and stability. Since catalytic performances depend on the catalyst structural characteristics, a fine control over size, shape and composition is a priority target for optimization of the catalytic performances [1]. In this respect, the ongoing progress in nanocrystal synthesis by wet chemical routes offers the opportunity to elaborate optimized heterogeneous catalytic systems [2]. Thus, nanoparticles with tailored characteristics are being studied as catalysts in a large number of catalytic reactions [3]. Wet chemistry syntheses of nanocrystals make use of stabilizing agents (ligands) in order to control their size and direct their growth along certain crystallographic directions, thus determining their shape. The ligand influence on the performances of catalysts is very diverse. Ligands can behave as poisons, blocking active sites or limiting the accessibility on the surface, or on the contrary as promoters, leading to improved yields and often unpredicted selectivity control, or even as simple spectators [4–8]. Despite the advantages of their finely controlled structural characteristics, unsupported nanoparticles cannot be easily isolated and recycled [9]. Their immobilization on a macroscopic support enables easy recovery, catalyst recycling and improved stability through interactions with the support [10]. However, the conventional methods for the elaboration of supported catalysts do not allow a fine control of the nanoparticle size and shape [11]. Examples of immobilized, shape-controlled nanocrystals are relatively rare [12–15]. Provided that the nanoparticle morphology and composition control achieved by solution approaches is reproducible on a support, the progress in nanocrystal synthesis could be of great benefit to heterogeneous catalysis [16–18]. One of the problems associated to systems comprising colloidal nanoparticles is ligand removal, which often modifies the size and/or the shape of the particles. Thus, the advantages of morphologically tailored supported catalyst can be lost [4,6,7,19]. Alternatively, ligand presence on a supported catalyst can be exploited as it is the case for non-supported nanocatalysts. In order to benefit from the advantages that shape-controlled supported catalysts may offer, immobilization methods that allow shape-control of the catalytic phase should be developed. The selective hydrogenation of compounds comprising various double bonds is an industrially relevant reaction, actively studied at the fundamental as well as at the applied level [20,21]. Among such compounds, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde (CAL) are excellent substrates for the evaluation of catalyst selectivity in the selective hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds. Platinum-based catalysts are intensively studied for this reaction. Nanoparticle size [22–24], composition [25,26], shape [27,28] and ligand coverage [29,30] have been reported as decisive parameters in the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction, affecting both activity and selectivity. Contradictory results about the impact of nanoparticle size on activity have been reported [22,23]. Recently, Durndell et al. showed that, while selectivity on Pt nanoparticles is very structure-sensitive, the activity is not [24]. Indeed, the calculations of Sautet and Delbeck on Pt and Pd surfaces, underline the better capacity of face centered cubic (fcc) {111} surfaces for promoting selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol cinnamyl alcohol (COL), by favoring the coordination of the CO instead of the CC bond [31]. Big particles exposing extended {111} facets present less edges and vertices than small ones, affording better selectivity for the unsaturated alcohols [24]. Moreover, different types of surfaces can afford different activity and selectivity [12,32–35]. In most of these studies {111} and {100} thermodynamically stable surfaces have been compared, mainly due to the fact that the catalyst preparation methods employed do not allow metastable higher energy facets to be stabilized. For example, for Pt/C catalysts, the catalytic performances showed a strong structure-sensitive character, with TOF following the trend Pt(100)/C > Pt(111)/C, and selectivity towards COL following the opposite trend Pt(111)/C > Pt(100)/C [32]. Catalytic studies on shape-controlled supported Pt-containing nanocrystals either in thermal- or electro-catalysis mainly concern convex nanoparticles exposing the most stable {100} and {111} facets [12–14,32,36], and rare are the cases where nanoparticles with more elaborated shapes have been immobilized on supports [15]. Recently, metal nanocrystals exposing high-index facets have drawn significant attention, mainly in electrocatalysis, due to their superior activity compared to that of low-index faces [15,37–41]. The reactivity of high-energy facets has been much less investigated in thermal catalysis [42]. The comparison between concave (with exposed high-index facets) and standard cubes of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles for CAL hydrogenation has proven the importance of nanoparticle shape and surface exposure, however the possible role of ligands has not been discussed [27]. The concave cubes (CCs) present better activity and selectivity towards COL in comparison with the standard ones. In this work we present the direct growth of concave nanocubes of platinum exposing {110} facets on few layer graphene (FLG), by adapting a wet chemistry method that produces free CCs in solution in the presence of octadecylamine. This has allowed the evaluation of both the unsupported and the FLG-supported CCs in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The {110} facets of metals that crystallize in the fcc structure are low index, but they are composed of a high number of atoms of low coordination number, and as such, they are expected to be more active [43]. Pt (110) model surfaces have been tested for the selective hydrogenation of prenal and it was found that, at low prenal partial pressures, C = C hydrogenation is favored, while higher prenal concentration promotes the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol. This was attributed to the coverage dependent adsorption mode of the prenal [44]. These results were also supported by theoretical calculations [31]. Surprisingly, pure Pt CCs exposing {110} type facets had not been available up to now despite the fact that bimetallic Pt-Sn CCs exposing {110} facets have been synthesized and studied in electrocatalysis [41]. The CCs discussed here are metastable objects, capped by stabilizing agents, which affect the catalytic performances. In this context, it is not the inherent reactivity of {110} facets that is evaluated, but the reactivity of {110} facets stabilized by octadecylamine. Here, we show that apart from the fact that ligands can stabilize the nanocrystal morphology under the conditions of the catalytic reaction, they can also promote high selectivity towards the most desired unsaturated alcohol without compromising the activity, which was found to be among the highest when compared to activities of Pt-based catalysts reported in the literature. The very high activity of this catalyst is most likely associated to the {110} facets. Two different configurations have been explored: (i) free concave nanocubes of two different sizes, named as CC-X (X= mean size of the cubes) and normal nanocubes of 6 nm mean size, named as NNC-6; and (ii) concave nanocubes of two different sizes supported on FLG, named as SCC-X (X= mean size of the supported cubes)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods All syntheses were performed under inert conditions in order to avoid oxygen and water during the synthesis. After synthesis, the catalysts were handled under ambient conditions. PtCl2 98% and PtCl2 99.9% were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Octadecylamine (ODA - C18H39N, 98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. These products were introduced in a glovebox and used without any further purification. Toluene (99%) was purchased from VWR Prolabo, then purified on alumina desiccant and degassed through three freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (99%), nonane (99%), isopropanol (99%), and pentane (99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. 2-2-4-triméthylpentane (99%) was purchased from Acros Organics, degassed through three freeze-pump-thaw cycles and dried on molecular sieves. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was carried out with a JEOL JEM 1400 microscope. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a Top Industry stainless steel autoclave. Gas chromatography analyses were run on a Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL equipped with a Restek Rtx 5-Amine column (30 m, 0.53 mm, 1 μm). Specific surface area measurements were performed on a QuantaChrome instrument by N2 adsorption/desorption using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at 77K. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a TGA/DSC 1 Star System from Metler Toledo. The Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis was performed by Pascher (http://www.mikrolabor.com/). The FLG support was synthesized by CVD following previous published procedure [45]."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 CC-45 The unsupported concave cube preparation followed a previously published procedure [46]. Briefly, the reactants, PtCl2 98% (16 mg, 6 10−2 mmol), ODA (400 mg, 1.5 mmol), and toluene (7 mL), were introduced in a Fischer Porter bottle in a glove box. After 10 min of homogenization of the mixture in an ultrasonic bath, the Fischer Porter bottle was charged with 3 bar of dihydrogen and then left at 20 °C for 168 h (one week) under magnetic stirring. At the end of the reaction, the bottle was depressurized and the final suspension was washed three times with a mixture of toluene and ethanol and centrifuged at 10 krpm for 10 min. Finally, 10 mL of pentane were added and, after decantation and supernatant removal, the nanoparticles were dried under vacuum. 2.2.2 CC-11 The same procedure as for CC-45 was followed, using 7 mg (2.6 10⁠−2 mmol) of PtCl⁠<sub>2</sub> 98%. 2.2.3 SCC-50 The reactants, PtCl2 98% (4 mg; 1.5 10−2 mmol), ODA (400 mg; 1.5 mmol), FLG (60 mg) and toluene (3.5 mL), were introduced in a Fischer Porter bottle inside a glove box. After 10 min of dispersion in an ultrasonic bath, the Fischer Porter bottle was charged with 3 bar of dihydrogen and then left at 25 °C for 168 h (one week) under magnetic stirring. At the end of the reaction, the bottle was depressurized and the final suspension was diluted by adding 10 mL of toluene, re-dispersed by a short ultrasound treatment(1 min), and 10 mL of ethanol were added. The mixture was centrifuged at 10 krpm for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, 10 mL of toluene and 10 mL of ethanol were added. The operation was repeated three times. Finally, 10 mL of pentane were added and, after decantation and supernatant removal, the catalyst was dried under vacuum. 2.2.4 SCC-8 PtCl2 98% (4 mg; 1.5 10−2 mmol), ODA (200 mg; 0.75 mmol), FLG (30 mg) and toluene (2 mL) were introduced in a Fischer Porter bottle inside a glove box. After 20 min of dispersion in an ultrasonic bath, the Fischer Porter bottle was charged with 3 bar of dihydrogen and then left at 20 °C for 24 h under magnetic stirring. The product work-up was performed as described for SCC-50.. 2.2.5 NCC-6 PtCl2 99.9% (16 mg, 6.10−2 mmol), ODA (400 mg, 1.5 mmol), and 2-2-4-triméthylpentane (7 mL) were introduced in a Fischer Porter bottle in a glove box. After 10 min of homogenization of the mixture in an ultrasonic bath, the Fischer Porter bottle was charged with 3 bar of dihydrogen and then left at 100 °C for 24 h under agitation. At the end of the reaction, the bottle was depressurized and the final suspension was washed three times with a mixture of toluene (7 mL) and ethanol (15 mL) and centrifuged at 20 krpm for 10 min. Finally, 7 mL of pentane and 15 mL of ethanol were added and, after decantation and supernatant removal, the nanoparticles were dried under vacuum."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalysts have been observed by TEM before and after the catalytic runs. The Pt content in all catalysts has been determined by ICP. The ligand content in the supported catalysts was determined by TGA analysis, and corresponds to the first loss of mass observed between 200 °C and 250 °C. The BET surface area of the support and the catalyst SCC-50 are 41 m2/g and 37 m2/g, respectively, indicating that there is no significant modification with respect to the pure FLG support. Chemisorption measurements being not useful on ligand-stabilized nanoparticles employed in solution, where equilibria between free and coordinated ligand exist, we have calculated the percentage of the surface atoms of the nanoparticles of each catalyst based on their mean dimensions, on geometrical considerations and considering the atomic arrangement of {100} and {110} facets in order to have an indication about their relative exposed surface areas. The estimated values are presented in Table 1 as a simple indication of the surface that would be exposed in the absence of ligands, but these values are not considered for the catalyst activity evaluation. In Table 1 we present the size and the calculated, approximate surface atom percentage of the Pt nanoparticles of each catalyst and their content in ligands and metal."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The ICP analysis of the FLG support prior to Pt growth has shown that the FLG contained residual iron and cobalt from the catalyst used for its synthesis, Co = 0.05% and Fe = 0.09%. These metals are not accessible, and blank experiments for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde have shown no activity of the FLG for this reaction. Catalyst amounts corresponding to about 10 mg (9 ± 1 mg) of Pt were precisely weighted and inserted in the autoclave. A solution of trans-cinnamaldehyde (1 g) and nonane (0.47 g) in isopropanol (50 mL) prepared in a glove-box was introduced into the autoclave. The autoclave was purged three times with 3 bar of N2, and three times with 5 bar of H2. Then, the autoclave was pressurized with 20 bar of H2 and heated to 70 °C under stirring (1000 rpm). The pressure was stable during the whole reaction by means of a gas-ballast connected to the autoclave. Samples of the reaction mixture were taken periodically and then analysed by GC. After the desired reaction time, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and depressurised. The reaction mixture was then analysed by gas chromatography. Quantitative analyses of the reaction mixtures were performed via GC techniques using calibration solutions of commercially available products. The activity was calculated based on the total Pt amount of each catalyst, using nonane as an internal standard as follows: activity (h−1) = (nt0 CAL – nt CAL)/(nPt * t(h)) where, nt0 CAL = mmol CAL introduced, nt CAL = mmol CAL remaining, and nPt = total mmol of Pt in the catalyst. The selectivity in product x was calculated as follows: % x = 100 nx / (nt0 CAL – nt CAL); nx = mmol of product x A pre-reduction step was investigated in some cases. For that, the same procedure as above was followed, however, the amount of solvent was 40 mL and no cinnamaldehyde was introduced in the autoclave. After the pre-reduction step that lasted 4 h, the autoclave was depressurised and a TEM sample was obtained in order to verify the evolution of the morphology of the nanocrystals. Then a solution prepared in a glovebox containing the cinnamaldehyde (1 g) and nonane (0.47 g) in isopropanol (10 mL) was transferred to the reactor. The autoclave was pressurized with 20 bar of H2 and heated to 70 °C under stirring (1000 rpm) for different reaction times. After the desired reaction time, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and depressurised. The reaction mixture was then analysed by gas chromatography. For the recycling experiments, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with pentane (10 mL). After drying, the catalyst was introduced into the glovebox and weighted before being re-used. The %Pt in the catalyst was considered constant during all the recycling experiments."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Unsupported platinum nanocubes,"3.1 Unsupported platinum nanocubes Platinum concave nanocubes of two different sizes CC-11 and CC-45 (11.5 ± 4.8 nm and 45.1 ± 7.7 nm, respectively) exposing {110} type facets have been synthesized at room temperature by reduction under H2 of PtCl2 in the presence of octadecylamine as stabilizing ligand (molar ratio Pt/ODA = 1/58 and 1/25, respectively) [46]. In Fig. 1 a-b we present TEM images of the two as-prepared CCs. They were tested in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (Fig. 1c) at 70 °C under 20 bar of H2. Hydrogenation of the CO group leads to cinnamyl alcohol (COL), while hydrogenation of the CC group forms hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL). Further hydrogenation of either COL or HCAL leads to the formation of hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL). Other reactions such as aromatic ring hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis are possible, but they have not been observed in this study, since they generally require harsher conditions. The catalytic performances have been evaluated at 1 h and at 24 h reaction time, and the results plotted as bar diagrams in Fig. 1d-e for the CC-11 and CC-45, respectively. The schematic representation of the products in Fig. 1c serves as a guide for the catalysis results in Fig. 1d-e. The evolution of the catalyst morphology has been examined by TEM observations of the samples after 24 h of reaction (Fig. 1f-g for the CC-11 and CC-45, respectively). We present in Table 2 the catalyst performances as measured at 1 h and 24 h reaction times for all catalysts together with their Pt/L ratios (L = stabilizing ligands). For some cases additional measurements have been performed at 4 h reaction time. In Fig. S2 we present plots of the catalyst conversion and selectivity to COL. Apart from their difference in size, the two CC-11 and CC-45 catalysts differ in the amount of stabilizing ligands on their surface (Table 1 and 2). Indeed, CC-45, in addition to exposing a smaller total surface area due to their larger size, are stabilized by a higher amount of ligands. A simple purification protocol of the nanocrystals (see experimental section) removes the stabilizing ligands only partially, and to a different degree for each catalyst. This difference has to be considered for the interpretation of the catalytic results, since the presence of ligands may impact both activity and selectivity. The activity is very often negatively impacted by the ligands due to the reduction of the catalyst surface accessibility. Additionally, the presence of ligands prevents an evaluation of the number of active sites, which in solution depends on the equilibria between free ligands and ligands adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface. Thus, catalyst activities were calculated over the total amount of Pt of each system. As far as selectivity is concerned, several reports have shown that the presence of ligands on the nanoparticle surface can significantly impact the selectivity in CAL hydrogenation both in unsupported but also supported nanocrystals [29,30,47,48]. Considering size as well as surface coverage by the ligands, the 11 nm CCs should present higher activity. This is true at 1 h of reaction. However, after 24 h, the activity of CC-45 is higher than the one of CC-11 (9 and 3 h−1, respectively). Comparison of the TEM micrographs of the catalysts before and after catalysis shows that the smaller CCs are severely impacted by the hydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the concavity of the CC-11 has been lost, and large aggregates of ill-shaped particles have been formed (Fig. 1f). The severe aggregation/coalescence of CC-11 can explain the reduced conversion at 24 h. On the other hand, the CC-45 seem to have resisted: only marginal shape and size alterations can be detected (42.1 ± 12.5 nm for the spent CC-45 versus 45.1 ± 7.7 for the fresh catalyst). However, some aggregation has also been observed for this sample after catalysis, although to a much less extent than in the case of CC-11. The shape conservation of CC-45 during catalysis could be the result from the better stability of the bigger size and/or the presence of more ligands. As far as selectivity is concerned, the CC-11 catalyst presents a better selectivity towards HCAL, which is what is expected from the thermodynamically favored CC hydrogenation versus CO hydrogenation, and from the fact that smaller nanocrystals with high number of under-coordinated atoms allow easy approach of the CC bond [24,49]. Similar selectivity was reported for aggregated Pt nanoparticles of ill-defined shape stabilized by oleic acid ligands [47]. As the CC-11 catalyst is not stable under the reaction conditions, we cannot evaluate the influence of the type of facet exposed on the catalyst performances. The higher selectivity to COL of the CC-45 catalyst could be associated to various parameters, such as the ligand coverage, the type of facets exposed, or the particle size. Indeed, the CC-45 catalyst presents a high coverage by ligands (Pt/L =6.5 w/w), which allow an easier access to the Pt of the less sterically demanding CO bond compared to the CC one. Long-chain amine ligands have been reported to improve the selectivity for COL thanks to this steric effect [29]. Steric effects could also account for the increase of the COL selectivity with time on both catalysts, which is however, less pronounced for CC-11. This phenomenon has been observed before, and has been attributed to the gradual adsorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface, which favor the approach and subsequent hydrogenation of the less sterically demanding CO bond [24,25]. The higher selectivity of CC-45 could also arise from the type of facets exposed. Indeed, as the CC-45 catalyst shape is not significantly modified during catalysis, we can envisage also an influence of the type of facets exposed on catalyst performances. To check this hypothesis, we independently prepared non-concave Pt nanocubes NCC-6 (size 6.1 ± 0.7 nm, ratio Pt/L = 7.3) exposing {100} facets, which have been reported as slightly less selective than the {111} facets [32]. The TEM micrographs of NCC-6 before and after catalysis as well as the graphs of the catalysis results are presented in Fig. S1 (Supplementary material). The nanocube size after catalysis is 5.9 ± 1.4 nm. It can be seen, that while aggregation after catalysis is observed for NCC-6, their shape is slightly rounded at the corners thus, they are much less modified as compared to the CC-11 nanocrystals of similar size. This is not surprising since these nanocubes are enclosed by more stable {100} facets and present a much higher ligand content than CC-11. The NCC-6 sample, presents a similar Pt/L ratio as CC-45, but smaller particle size. The results on its catalytic performances are also presented in Table 2 (entry 4). Although this catalyst shows a similar Pt/L ratio as the CC-45 catalyst, NCC-6 activity is very low and its selectivity towards COL is also much lower, for both reaction times. But it is also known that COL selectivity is significantly affected by Pt particle size [24], larger particles allowing higher selectivity. At this stage, it is difficult to de-correlate all these effects and attribute the performance to the size, shape or, ligand content. However, taking into account the results of Pradier et al. [44] in the case of prenal hydrogenation on Pt(100) model catalysts, which show that the selectivity of Pt(100) to the unsaturated alcohol was favored by increasing the prenal partial pressure (steric effects), it is very likely that ligand coverage plays a major role on selectivity. For the most interesting non-supported catalyst CC-45 tested, the conversion and the selectivity towards COL at 24 h both reach 78%."
8,Few layer graphene supported platinum nanocubes,"3.2 Few layer graphene supported platinum nanocubes The use of a support is essential to access to high performances and good recyclability, by dispersing the nanoparticles and preventing their agglomeration [10]. It has also been shown recently that it can promote one reaction pathway over another, giving a specific product and then affecting the selectivity of a catalytic reaction [50,51]. Few layer graphene has been chosen as support since its 2D morphology allows high accessibility of reactants [52–54], and graphitic supports have been theoretically shown to favor CO adsorption on Pt, and subsequent preferential hydrogenation [31]. In the case of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, graphene, in comparison with other kinds of carbon support, has shown an enhanced selectivity for the production of cinnamyl alcohol [52,55]. We have thus decided to support our CCs on FLG, and more precisely to grow them directly on the support. We have recently grown cobalt nanowires on metallic foams and on a silica-alumina support by modification of a wet chemistry approach, which produces free nanowires in solution. We have shown that when the support is present, in order to reproduce the same shape as in the absence of a support, it is necessary to increase the amount of the ligands [56,57]. The fact that, in the presence of the support in the reaction medium producing shape controlled nano-objects, it is not possible to reproduce the same shape of nanocrystals, indicates that part of the ligand is adsorbed on the support and is not available any more for directing the nanocrystal growth. We have thus employed the same strategy for the growth of the CCs on the FLG support. It has to be noted that the ratio Pt/ODA is important for controlling nanocrystal morphology. Thus, increasing the ODA concentration to reach a Pt/ODA mass ratio of 1/100 allows the selective growth of supported concave nanocubes (SCCs) on the FLG support. In Fig.2 a-b we present the TEM images of the as-obtained supported nanocrystals of two different sizes SCC-8 and SCC-50 (7.8 ± 3.0 nm and 50.2 ± 13.8 nm, respectively). The 8 nm CCs are not all of them very well-defined and homogeneous, and we can discern the presence of small classical non-concave nanocubes among the CCs (Fig. 2a). The 50 nm CCs grown on the FLG are well-shaped (Fig. 2b). The growth of the CCs on the FLG does not significantly change the specific area (See experimental part, catalyst characterization). Both catalysts have comparable ligand content (Pt/L ˜ 2), higher than in the case of both CC-11 and CC-45. Both catalysts have been used for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, employing the same reaction conditions as for the free nanocrystals. The SCC-50 catalyst was evaluated at 4 h also. In Fig. 2c and d we present the results on their catalytic performances (See also Table 2 entries 5 and 6, respectively, and Fig. S2). In Fig. 2e and f we present the TEM images of the two spent catalysts after 24 h reaction, which show that in both cases aggregation/sintering has been avoided thanks to the immobilization of the nanocrystals on the support. The size of the nanocubes after catalysis was unchanged (7.9 ± 4.5 nm versus 7.8 ± 3.0 nm initially for SCC-8, and 48.1 ± 13.0 nm versus 50.2 ± 13.8 for SCC-50). Concerning their shape evolution after 24 h catalytic reaction, for SCC-8 there is not a marked modification of the general sample aspect; however, the fact that the SS-8 are less well defined does not allow safe conclusions. The impact of the hydrogenation reaction for SCC-50 is small as in the case of the CC-45. The activity of the SCC-8 is higher than the one of SCC-50 both at 1 and 24 h. This is due to the smaller nanocrystal size. Since no aggregation has taken place during the reaction at 24 h, we have complete conversion for the SCC-8 catalyst, in contrast to the non-supported CC-11. We notice that initially the SCC-8 and SCC-50 selectivity for COL are very similar (43 and 38%, respectively). This is an interesting result because these two catalysts have the same exposed facets and similar Pt/L molar ratio (Pt/L ˜ 2), but very different particle size. Therefore, it seems that, at least for nanoparticles between 8 and 50 nm, the particle size is not the most important factor to control the selectivity. If we correlate this result to the one obtained by comparing the NCC-6 and CC-45, we can propose a significant influence of the type of facets on COL selectivity. Thus, it seems that the concave facets favor COL formation. On SCC-8, complete hydrogenation after 24 h produces HCOL as the major product. The SCC-50 shows the same tendency as CC-11 and CC-45, favoring the selectivity towards COL as the reaction time is increased. The selectivity evolution indicates a preferential hydrogenation of the HCAL over hydrogenation of the COL. The difference in catalyst characteristics (supported or not, different size, shape, ligand content) makes a straightforward comparison of their performances complicated. This is clearly shown in Fig. S3 in which the plots of activity at 1 h versus size and versus ligand content of our catalysts do not allow to suggest any simple correlation of activity to size or ligand content. Similarly, the selectivity to COL does not seem to directly correlate with size (Fig. S3). Nevertheless, COL selectivity can be well correlated to the Pt/L ratio in CC and SCC samples. Indeed, Fig. 3 a. shows that the higher the ligand content, the better the COL selectivity. Concerning the activity, a very good correlation, shown in the plot of Fig. 3b can be found when we consider a more complex parameter integrating both size and ligand content. Thus, activity is increased either by decreasing nanoparticle size and/or the ligand content. On these figures, the red squares, which correspond to the NCC-6 catalyst performances do not fit in any of these plots. This means that these correlations hold only when we consider similar facets. Finally, from Fig. 3c we can safely conclude that both activity and selectivity to COL are improved when the CCs are immobilized on FLG."
9,Recycling experiments,"3.3 Recycling experiments The shape homogeneity and resistance under hydrogenation conditions of the SCC-50 and the possibility to easily isolate the catalyst has incited us to test its recyclability. For these recycling experiments, we have slightly modified the reaction conditions. While the preparation of the catalysts has been performed in a glove-box, the catalysts have been stocked under ambient conditions. We have thus performed a pre-reduction step during 4 h under the same reaction conditions as during the catalytic runs, the only difference being the absence of cinnamaldehyde. This treatment, first tested on the CC-45 catalyst, was found: (i) not to impact the Pt morphology, (ii) despite its slight agglomeration, to marginally improve the activity, probably due to the more reduced state of the surface, and (iii) to substantially improve the selectivity towards COL (Table 2, entry 3 and Fig. S4). This effect is probably associated to an even greater surface crowding upon pre-saturation by H2. This interpretation was suggested by Durndell et al. who observed an improvement of the selectivity to COL upon H2 pressure increase [24]. For the recycling of the SCC-50 we have decided to perform this pre-reduction step. In order to better monitor the conversion at 24 h, in addition to the pre-reduction step, we have decreased by half the amount of catalyst used, designated as SCC-50-H2. In Fig. 4 we present the TEM micrograph of the catalyst after H2 pre-reduction (Fig. 4a), the results of the catalytic tests (Fig. 4b-f) (see also Table 2 entry 7), as well as the TEM image of the spent catalyst after the end of all recycling experiments (Fig. 4g). In Fig S5 we present the plots of the activity and selectivity to COL for the recycling experiments. From our data, we see that both activity and selectivity to COL are improved for SCC-50-H2 as compared to SCC-50. Indeed, and despite the lower catalyst amount, the conversion is almost complete after 4 h with a very good selectivity towards COL, which, as expected, is further hydrogenated to HCOL upon longer reaction time. The counterintuitive increased activity upon dilution could be explained if we consider that by reducing the catalyst amount, the ligand concentration in solution is also reduced, which could favor higher activities, albeit without penalizing the good selectivity to COL. The same tendencies are observed after two successive recycling steps; however, while selectivity to COL continues to be high, the activity drops in the third and fourth recycling steps (see also Fig. S5). Since no major morphological alterations are obvious from the TEM images of the spent catalyst, we believe that the apparent deactivation is a result of loss of catalyst during its washing after each recycling step. On the other hand, the high selectivity to COL, which is practically the same until the end, indicates that the catalyst surface remains always sufficiently covered by ligands. Considering the fact that the catalyst is washed at the end of each run, and that the catalyst concentration is divided by two, this result seems somehow contradictory to our findings that high ligand content favors COL selectivity. It is then likely that despite the fact that the amount of ligand is diminished with time, the ligand distribution between Pt and FLG could vary throughout the reaction. Thus, the FLG could act as a ligand reservoir that guarantees a minimum ligand associated to the nanoparticles re-establishing the equilibrium between FLG- and Pt-associated ligands. Thus, ligand content is found within an optimal range, which guarantees adsorption modes that favor CO hydrogenation. An independent experiment was performed in order to observe any important change in the organic content of a SCC-50 catalyst before and after 24 h catalytic reaction. TGA measurements have revealed that the organic content does not change significantly: (4.8% of organic content before catalysis and 5.5% after catalysis); however, part of the organic content after catalysis and washing could also correspond to adsorbed CAL or reaction products. This parameter of ligand distribution between the active phase and the support merits to be further studied as it is very likely also important for other reactions and with several supports and metal catalysts. “Ligand-M” interaction versus “Support-Ligand” interaction could then be tuned in order to optimize the catalytic performances. A direct comparison with other catalytic systems, most of them without organic ligands is not straightforward; however, the SCC-50-H2 catalyst presents comparable results to the ones of some of the best Pt catalysts reported in the literature (Fig. S6, Table S1). It is worth noting that the activity was calculated over the total Pt amount. Thus, if we compare the activity of the SCC-50-H2 catalyst (500 h−1) with the best activities found in the literature: 3% Pt/C (size: 1.6 nm, activity:1300 h−1) [58] and 3.6% Pt/FLG (size: 2 nm; activity: 1600 h−1) [59] and if we consider the difference in Pt nanoparticle size, the TOF of SCC-50-H2 should be much higher. We believe that this is due to the presence of high index facets."
10,Conclusions,"Unprecedented Pt concave nanocubes presenting {110} facets have been directly grown on FLG support via an in-situ process based on a wet chemistry approach. Non-supported and supported CCs of similar size have been tested as catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Despite the fact that it is a real challenge to isolate the effect of each parameter (morphology, ligands, support) on the catalytic performances of these systems in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, several conclusions can be drawn. First, the use of few layer graphene as support allowed a stabilization of the CCs against aggregation/sintering. The supported catalysts show better selectivity towards COL and better activity than the free CCs. This is mainly due to CC size and Pt/L ratio and not to a direct influence (metal-support interaction) of the support. The COL selectivity is well correlated to the Pt/L ratio for SCC and CC catalysts. An influence of the type of facets exposed is also proposed; {110} facets leading to higher selectivity as compared to {100} facets. The activity of the catalysts is well correlated to size*Pt/L for the concave nanocubes (supported or not). There also, we propose an influence of the facets exposed; the {110} facets leading to higher activity, particularly compared to literature results with conventional Pt catalysts. However, the facet-reactivity correlation is not ligand-independent, and it is not impossible that the role of ligands is facet dependent. The ligands are an important actor that allows reactivity modulation through interaction not only with the surface of the metal but also with the support. A good understanding of the performances of ligand-containing supported catalysts is very challenging due to the fact that such systems are defined by more parameters than non-supported nanocatalysts or supported catalysts that do not contain ligands. These parameters cannot be easily dissociated. Further studies should be undertaken in order to: (i) determine the ligand distribution between the metal and the support, (ii) optimize the ligand amount, and (iii) study the effect of different ligands and different supports. We finally believe that despite these inherent difficulties, in order to fully exploit the potential of wet chemistry approaches, ligands in supported catalysts should be regarded as an additional opportunity, through which catalytic performances can be finally finely tuned, just as in homogeneous catalysis."
