0,Introduction,"With the gradual depletion of fossil resources and further deterioration of the environment and its ecosystem, much effort has been devoted to explore renewable resources for the sustainable supply of chemicals and fuels. Various biomass have been identified as alternate source of energy fuels [1], among which microalgae are being considered as a promising renewable energy resource due to high cellular lipid contents (up to 60wt%) [2] and high photosynthetic rates. Dry microalgae are usually used as feedstock for biofuels production, but the energy required for the dewatering process accounted for up to 90% of the total energy consumption [3,4]. Moreover, although the conversion of lipid by transesterification with alcohols into fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) has been commercialized, biodiesel has the disadvantages such as poor chemical stability and low energy density because of its high oxygen content [5,6]. An alternative way to transform lipid is to remove oxygen via hydrodeoxygenation to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons [7,8], which are superior to biodiesel in terms of energy density and oxidation stability [9]. In the hydrodeoxygenation reaction, high pressure of molecular hydrogen is frequently required to achieve considerable feed conversions, which constrains its application for biofuels production because of its need for specialized equipment and potential safety issues. Thus, the use of in situ generated hydrogen as alternative to molecular hydrogen has been proposed in order to produce biofuels under mild reaction conditions. Hydrogen can be in situ generated by two catalytic routes, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) and aqueous phase reforming (APR). CTH is a process in which hydrogen is transferred from a hydrogen donor molecule to an acceptor. Reported hydrogen donors include formic acid [10], 2-propanol (2-PO) [11–13], methanol [13] and ethanol [12]. APR is a process in which hydrogen containing compounds (such as methanol, ethanol and glycerol) react with water to produce a hydrogen-rich gas stream. It is envisaged that a hydrodeoxygenation reaction using in situ generated hydrogen rather than molecular hydrogen generally has higher reaction rates. For example, a positive effect on the hydrodeoxygenation activity for conversion of triolein was observed over Pd/C aided by in situ hydrogen produced from glycerol reforming [14]. Similar promotional effect was also observed in conversion of stearic acid to hydrocarbons over Pt-Re/C with glycerol for in situ hydrogen production [15]. However, utilization of glycerol APR as the only source of in situ H2 required either a high reaction temperature (573K) or long reaction time (20h) for the reaction to complete and sufficient amount of H2 to form. Herein, we demonstrate that the conversion of triglycerides to hydrocarbon fuels could be efficiently catalyzed by Pd/C in the presence of water at 523K within 12h when an integrated CTH and APR process was employed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The 5wt% Pd/C was prepared by a wetness impregnation method as follows: Activated carbon was first impregnated with appropriate amount of aqueous solution of H2PdCl4. After impregnation for 2h, excess water was then removed at 298K in a rotary evaporator. The resultant solid was dried in ambient air at 383K for 4h and subsequently reduced in H2 flow at 523K for 1h in a tube furnace."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface areas of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption using Quantachrome NOVA 1000e apparatus with liquid-N2 at the temperature of 77K. The samples were outgassed at 523K for 4h prior to analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on an X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with a vertical goniometer between 2θ=10o and 80o at 2o min−1 employing a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ=0.15406nm). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were carried out using a HITACHI H600 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 120kV. Before the catalyst characterization, all catalysts were reduced in H2 flow at 523K for 1h."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation One-pot catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction was performed in a tank reactor (300mL capacity) with continuous stirring. Typically, triolein (4.25g) was diluted in the mixture of solvent-water solution with solvent/water ratio of 0:100, 10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 70:30, and 90:10 (volume ratio with total volume set at 100mL). The solvents were dodecane, toluene and decalin. The finial mixture was then charged into the reactor, together with Pd/C catalyst (1g) pre-reduced at 523K for 1h. Before the reaction, the reactor was purged three times with N2 to exchange the air inside. The reaction was performed at 523K for 12h with autogenous pressure at a stirring rate of 600rpm. After the desired reaction time, the reactor was cooled rapidly to room temperature. The products in the organic phase and water phase were analyzed by GC–MS with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5 column (30m, 0.25mm inner diameter)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of Pd/C catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of Pd/C catalysts XRD patterns of activated carbon (AC) support and reduced Pd/C catalysts before and after reaction are shown in Fig. 1 . TEM images of the reduced Pd/C catalysts before (A) and after (B) reaction are presented in Fig. 2 . For the reduced Pd/C catalyst, no characteristic peaks assignable to metal Pd can be observed, suggesting a high Pd dispersion and small Pd particle size on the AC support. The average particle size of Pd metal nanoparticles calculated from TEM is 1.7nm (Fig. 2A), which further confirms the XRD result. In addition, there is also no PdO crystalline phase, indicating that PdO was completely reduced by H2 at 523K for 1h. In contrast, for the spent catalyst, intensive peaks characteristic of Pd metals are observed (Fig. 1C). Meanwhile, TEM shows Pd metal nanoparticles with average size of 5.7nm are present over the spent catalyst (Fig. 2B). Both results indicate there was a growth of Pd metal nanoparticles during the reaction."
7,The catalytic performance of the Pd/C catalyst,"3.2 The catalytic performance of the Pd/C catalyst Hydrothermal hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides over the Pd/C catalyst was first performed with different dodecane/water ratios, and the reaction results are shown in Table 1 . When in situ hydrogen generated solely from APR of glycerol was used in reaction, as the case of dodecane/water=0/100, the major products in the organic phase were oleic acid and stearic acid while glycerol was the major product in the water phase. The presence of substantial amount of oleic acid and stearic acid at the complete conversion of triolein indicates the hydrolysis of triolein was faster than hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids. Additionally, the APR of glycerol was not completed under current reaction conditions and therefore the hydrogen generated was not sufficient for further conversion of oleic acid and stearic acid. When dodecane was introduced into the reaction system, both the conversion of fatty acids and glycerol was improved. The selectivity to diesel-like hydrocarbons (C17 +C18 products) increased with the increase in the dodecane content and reached its maximum (51.74%) when the dodecane/water ratio was 70/30. This variation of the product distribution could be ascribed to the higher reactivity of hydrogen transferred from solvent than that generated from aqueous phase reforming. In order to verify the importance of in situ generated hydrogen from CTH to the hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides, we further employed other two solvents with higher or lower capability of hydrogen donation than dodecane. When decalin was used as solvent, the selectivity to diesel-like hydrocarbons (C17 +C18 products) significantly increased to 71.91% which is 2.6 times higher than that with dodecane as solvent (Table 2 ). In contrast, using toluene as solvent, a very low yield of diesel-like hydrocarbons (2.72%) was obtained and the major product was unsaturated oleic acid, although the APR of glycerol was completed. As we know, the theoretical amount of hydrogen produced from each decalin mole is very high (up to 5mol of H2) and the final organic products can be either tetralin or naphthalene [16,17]. In fact, we detected both tetralin and naphthalene in the organic phase after reaction by GC–MS. Toluene, on the other hand, is not able to dehydrogenate and produce in situ H2. Thus, the H2 involved in the reaction all derives from the APR of glycerol. When 1mol triolein is hydrolyzed, 3mol oleic acid and 1mol glycerol is produced. The APR of 1mol glycerol gives rise to 7mol of H2, while the amount of H2 required for hydrogenation of oleic acid to the major product heptadecane via decarbonylation mechanism is 6mol H2. The amount of hydrogen supplied by the APR of glycerol is sufficient, but the hydrocarbon yield is low. Therefore, these results confirm that the in situ hydrogen generated from solvents is more reactive than that from aqueous phase reforming. For practical applications of this reaction system using decalin as solvent, the regeneration of decalin after the reaction is important. Actually, decalin as in situ hydrogen donor has been currently used in the fuel cell vehicle system [18,19]. It can easily dehydrogenate at different temperatures over Pt/C catalysts with tetralin and final naphthalene as the dehydrogenation products [20]. Moreover, hydrogenation of tetralin or naphthalene has also been investigated by several researchers. For example, Rautanen [21] found that naphthalene could be hydrogenated to decalin at 120°C, 20bar on a commercial nickel-on alumina catalyst. Also naphthalene could be hydrogenated with almost complete conversion over highly-loaded NiMo, NiW and NiMoW catalysts under moderate conditions: 3.0MPa (H2), H2/oil of 300 (v/v), 140–240°C [22]. In particular, Ni/MCM-41 catalysts exhibited the excellent catalytic performance for hydrogenation of naphthalene with 100% conversion at 55°C, which could rival the activity of commercial Raney Ni catalyst [23]. Therefore, tetralin and naphthalene can easily be hydrogenated to decalin with commercial catalysts such as Raney Ni, nickel-supported catalysts etc., suggesting decalin is a regenerative hydrogen donor and solvent."
8,Conclusion,"Hydrothermal hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides to hydrocarbon fuels could be efficiently catalyzed by Pd/C in the presence of water. Up to 71.91% yield of diesel-like hydrocarbons (C17 +C18 products) could be achieved using decalin as solvent at 523K with autogenous pressure after 12h of reaction time. The final product distribution is much more influenced by the dehydrogenation capability of solvents, because the in situ hydrogen generated from solvents is more reactive than that from aqueous phase reforming. A reaction system involving the use of solvents should take the contribution of reactivity from solvents into account, especially for hydrogenation reactions."
