0,Introduction,"Hydrogen generation through solar-driven photocatalysts is a cleaner and renewable energy process having great potential for partial fulfilment of electricity for domestic and automobile applications [1]. Though several photocatalysts have been reported with improved efficiency industrial development of solar hydrogen fuel is still limited due to: (a) efficiency of the process is much lower than the benchmark (10%) (b) photocatalyst becomes unstable for continuous usage especially in an aqueous medium. There is a necessity for improving solar-to-hydrogen fuel conversion efficiency and photocatalyst stability to overcome the above-said issues. The TiO2 is well-reported for its visible-light transparency up to 15 nm thickness, excellent charge transfer (electron and hole) characteristics and reinforce the catalyst stability for prolonged usage [2,3]. Owing to its chemical stability at a wide pH range, it is preferable to use it as a protecting layer to different photocatalysts. Among the coating routes for synthesizing nanoscale TiO2, a wet chemical approach is economical and avoids complicated synthesis steps. But controlling the particle size and thickness of the film by chemical approach is challenging to manage. An uncontrolled agglomerated TiO2 deposition might lower the optical transparency, blocking the light irradiation to host the photocatalyst surface and charge trapping, which affects the photocatalytic performance [4]. In this context, surfactant-assisted wet chemical synthesis can maintain the nanoscale materials coating on the host substrate [5]. But, keeping the compatibility of surface charge between the surfactant and guest layer precursor is an important pre-requisite. CdSe is a promising photoactive material due to its flexibility in tuning the bandgap energy concerning particle size [6]. Though CdSe exhibits effective photocatalytic hydrogen generation, a photo corrosion process under extended light irradiation and photo charge carriers trapping at surface states affect photocatalytic performance. Therefore, protecting the CdSe surface, and accelerating the charge transfer is a challenge. This work explores the advantages of surfactants assisted shell layer in protecting the CdSe surface and enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen fuel generation performance."
1,Experimental,"The synthesis protocol of 1-D CdSe nanoparticles was reported in our recent work [2]. The pre-synthesized 1-D CdSe powder (0.1 g) was dispersed into ethyl alcohol (50 mL) for 15 min. One of the surfactants, trisodium citrate dihydrate (TSC), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), N-tri butyl ammonium bromide (NTAB), and sodium oleate (SOA) was dissolved followed by slow addition of TTIB (0.8 mL, 10 mL) under magnetic stirring at 30 °C for 2 h. The resulting precipitate (after washing with water and ethyl alcohol) was dispersed in ethyl alcohol, and acetonitrile (1:3 M, 25:75 mL) and the mixture was placed in the hydrothermal reactor. The hydrothermal reactor was kept in a furnace at 160 °C for 20 h. The final product (after washing with water and ethyl alcohol) was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The experimental details of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorbance are provided in the Supplementary information. The pristine CdSe and TiO2 coated CdSe for different surfactants were tested for solar to hydrogen generation. Typically, 5 mg of powder was taken for photocatalysis experiments. The aqueous mixture consists of Na2S and Na2SO4 (300 mM) was used as a scavenger. A 300 W Xe-lamp fitted with solar simulator used as a light source, and experiments were performed under visible light with UV cut off filter (λ > 420 nm). The recyclability experiments were carried out under identical conditions."
2,Results and discussion,"The X-ray diffraction results of CdSe and CdSe/TiO2 composite prepared using different surfactants are presented in Fig. S1 (a–f) and S2 (See Supplementary information). Fig. 1 (a–f) reveals the surface morphology of the pristine CdSe and surfactant mediated TiO2 coated CdSe. It is found that the surfactants significantly influences the pre-synthesized CdSe shape and assembly of post-deposited TiO2. Among the surfactants, nonionic surfactants (PVP) assisted CdSe/TiO2 composites showed (Fig. 1b) homogenous TiO2 shell layer coating onto CdSe surface compared to uncoated CdSe (Fig. 1a). The cationic and anionic surfactants either deforms the CdSe shape or results in uncontrolled agglomeration deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles. It might be due to incompatibility between the surface charge of CdSe and surfactants. For instance, CdSe possesses a negative surface charge which electrostatically attracts cationic surfactants CTAB (Fig. 1c) and NTAB (Fig. 1d) and repels the anionic surfactants TSC (Fig. 1e) and SOA (Fig. 1f). As a result, the anionic surfactant electrostatically repelled by CdSe tends to form aggregation (micelle), which is favorable for TiO2 particles growth randomly on the CdSe surface. Based on the TEM images, we propose a possible mechanism (Fig. 1g) illustrating surfactants’ role (chemical structure of surfactants presented in Fig. S3) on TiO2 post-deposition layer on CdSe. Briefly, nonionic surfactant balances to attach their hydrophilic head with CdSe and hydrophobic tail with TTIB. As a result, the TTIB has homogenously covered CdSe in the presence of nonionic surfactant (PVP) resulting in a thin layer on TiO2 coating onto CdSe capsules. This is the reason for CdSe/TiO2 core-shell formation (Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the TTIB species have CH3 nonpolar groups with a strong affinity towards the surfactant's hydrophobic tails, which implies that irrespective of the surfactant's surface charge TTIB likes to attach with surfactant's tail, but without TTIB CdSe allows only cationic and nonionic surfactants. The quantity of hydrogen gas evolution per hour per gram catalyst using pristine CdSe and CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposite powders was measured under visible light illumination. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 (a), and corresponding solar to hydrogen generation (STH) is estimated and presented in Fig. 2(b). The mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen generation is explained in the Supplementary information (Fig. S4). Among the various surfactants, the nonionic surfactant PVP mediated CdSe/TiO2 core-shell type nanocapsule results in higher photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation activity 23.1 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat, which is approximately eight times higher than that of pristine CdSe (3.07 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat). This enhanced photocatalytic performance due to the conformally coated TiO2 layer by PVP surfactant which protects the CdSe layer from the photo corrosion issue and facilitate the photo charge carrier (electron and holes) transfer from CdSe to electrolyte. A sufficient thickness of the TiO2 layer on CdSe is necessary to protect against the photo corrosion issue. However, overloading or thicker TiO2 layer hinders the light penetration to the CdSe layer. The anionic surfactants TSC and SOA mediated TiO2 have non-homogenous and inadequate coverage on CdSe which results in low STH efficiency. The optical absorbance estimated from Kubelka-Munk studies (Fig. 2c) showed PVP mediated TiO2 samples balancing the optical transmittance at the visible light region. In other surfactants, the uncontrolled TiO2 growth reduces the light transmittance to CdSe and lower the absorbance at visible wavelength region. Further, the surfactant mediated TiO2 layer's recyclability to protect the CdSe surface was tested for the optimized photocatalyst (PVP) for four cycles under simulated solar light irradiation (Fig. 2d). Each process consists of 6 h continuous light irradiation, and it is noticed that the PVP mediated photocatalyst showed almost constant hydrogen evolution for the first and second cycles, which was slightly decreased after the third and fourth cycles, this may be due to the decrease in sacrificial ions in the reaction solution. Owing to high light absorbance, and protecting the photo corrosion issue PVP mediated CdSe/TiO2 composite exhibits STH = 14.0% (See Supplementary information). The adequate bonding of the TiO2 shell layer on the CdSe surface was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The core spectra of Cd3d3d, Se3d, Ti2p and O1s presented in Fig. 3 (a)–(d), respectively ensure the presence of CdSe and TiO2 and effective interaction between them. More detailed explanation can be found in the Supplementary information."
3,Conclusion,"In summary, the role of surfactant on post-deposition of metal oxide (TiO2) on host CdSe surface was demonstrated. A nonionic surfactant PVP balances both Ti precursor and CdSe surface charge and results in good growth of the TiO2 seed layer, which further forms the conformal shell around CdSe host. Anionic surfactants produce uncontrollable agglomerated TiO2 growth on CdSe and infers that surface charge of the host layer is a crucial parameter for making core-shell composites in surfactant mediated synthesis routes. Also, more optimization (pH and concentration) is required for cationic based surfactants. This protocol can be adopted for similar negative surface charge based host, and any types of polar groups attached metal oxide precursors. Overall, this work emphasizes that a simple chemical route derived metal oxide coatings enhances solar to hydrogen generation eight times than pristine CdSe photocatalyst."
