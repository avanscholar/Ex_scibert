0,Introduction,"In view of the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the deterioration of the global climate, much effort has been devoted to the exploration and development of renewable and non-fossil carbon energy sources [1]. Biomass is expected to be an increasingly important feedstock for producing alternative liquid fuels and a wide range of valuable chemicals [2]. Among them, sugar-derived furfural (FUR) is a key precursor to furan-based chemicals (e.g., tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol) and fuel additives [3], which can also be used for the synthesis of various commercial products such as vitamin C, lysine, resins, synthetic fibers, pesticides, and adhesives [4,5]. For the hydrogenation of FUR, different kinds of catalysts including both precious (e.g., Au, Pd and Ru) [6–8], and non-precious (e.g., Fe, Cu and Co) [9–12] metals have been investigated. However, they are either expensive or complex to prepare, and generally afford relatively lower selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol (FFA). It is worth mentioning that H2 is the most common hydrogen source, but typically suffers high hydrogen pressure (e.g., 80bar) and the undesired saturation of the furan-ring [13]. In particular, a series of pressure-tolerant instruments are required when gas-phase hydrogenation is involved [6,7,10–14]. For the safety and low-costing purpose, much attention has been paid to liquid-phase transfer hydrogenation by using formic acid or alcohols (e.g., 2-propanol) as liquid H-donor [8,9,15]. Nevertheless, the use of acidic H-donor formic acid puts forward high requirements for the corrosion resistance of the equipment, while alcoholic solvents may further react with FFA via etherification to lower its selectivity under the employed harsh conditions. Polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), as a byproduct in the silicon industry, is stable in an atmosphere of water and air, and nontoxic and inexpensive (Table S1) [16]. PMHS has been reported as H-donor for hydrogenation of aldehydes by using Pd/C as catalyst [17]. In the present study, KF was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aldehydes to corresponding alcohols in the presence of liquid H-donor PMHS. Particularly, FUR could be quantitatively converted to FFA at room temperature in several minutes. Moreover, almost no decrease in catalytic activity was observed for reusing at least three consecutive cycles."

3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface areas of the porous materials were determined from nitrogen physisorption measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument (Tristar II 3020, Norcross, GA). XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were recorded using a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe (Physical Electronics Inc., PHI, MN) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα anode. STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) test was measured by JEOL 2100 TEM/STEM. Moisture determination of reaction system was calculated by Karl Fischer titration method with WS-2000 Karl Fischer Moisture Titrator."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The liquid-phase hydrogenation of FUR and other aldehydes were carried out in a 10mL plastic sealed tube equipped with a magnetic stirring at 500rpm. In general, to a solution of 0.5mmol FUR dissolved in 2mL of DMF, certain amounts of catalyst and hydrosilane were added into the tube. As the tube was put into an oil bath that was preheated to a desired temperature, the reaction time was recorded. Besides, 1H and 19F NMR (JEOL-ECX 500 NMR) spectra of the reaction mixtures were used for the study of catalytic mechanism."
5,Sample analysis,"2.4 Sample analysis Liquid products were identified with GC–MS (Agilent 6890N GC/5973 MS, Santa Clara, CA), and quantitatively analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890B) with a HP-5 column (30m×0.320mm×0.25μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Naphthalene was employed as internal standard for quantitative calculation, which is referenced by standard curves (R2 >0.99). The calculation equations are shown as follows: Substrate conversion (%)=[1−(mole of substrate after reaction)/(mole of initial substrate)]×100%. Product yield (%)=(mole of obtained product)/(mole of initial substrate)×100%"
6,Catalyst recycling study,"2.5 Catalyst recycling study After each cycle of reactions, the remaining catalyst in the mixture was separated by centrifugation, and then successively washed with DMF and ethanol for 3 times, dried at 80°C in N2 for 12h, and directly used for the next run."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Screening of different catalysts for the hydrogenation of FUR to FFA,"3.1 Screening of different catalysts for the hydrogenation of FUR to FFA Initially, catalytic hydrogenation of FUR to FFA was selected as the model reaction in the presence of different catalysts. It was found that KF was most active as compared with LiF, NaF, CsF, KCl, and KBr in a short reaction time (Table 1 ). In detail, LiF, NaF, KCl, and KBr had no effect on the FUR-to-FFA conversion. It shows fluorion is the key of hydrogenation, besides, different cations may influent the activity of fluorion to catalyze the reaction because of different atomic radius. The atomic radius of Li and Na is too small to release/dissociate F- for catalysis [18]. While KF afforded 79% FUR conversion and 76% FFA yield with TOF value of 18.3h−1 in 5min, indicating that the higher nucleophilicity of fluoride was more favorable for the synthesis of FFA from FUR. Although CsF was also active for the hydrogenation reaction [19], its high hygroscopicity possibly suppressed the reactivity in this study (Table 1). More importantly, KF was not soluble into the liquid mixture even after a long and continuous reaction period (e.g., 5h). Given these findings, KF was the best catalyst for the hydrogenation of FUR to FFA."
9,Effect of the silane type,"3.2 Effect of the silane type In the presence of KF, the effect of different silanes on the conversion of FUR to FFA was further investigated (Table 2 ). Among the employed simple hydrosilanes, phenylsilane and diphenylsilane showed relatively higher yields of FFA, possibly due to their relatively lower stabilization possibility of silicon atoms [20], but they are generally expensive and too wasteful for large-scale use [16]. Interestingly, the readily available PMHS H-donor exhibited comparable activity regarding FFA yield, although the conversion rate of FUR was slightly lower which might be ascribed to the in situ formation of more stable intermediate (i.e., the siloxane) than others. In addition, the polymeric PMHS is more prone to generate insoluble resins to encapsulate the active species [21], which would be helpful to separate the catalyst out for recycles. Therefore, PMHS is the best H-donor, in view of its high efficiency, low-cost and environmental-friendly feature."
10,"Effect of solvent type, and catalyst/PMHS dosage","3.3 Effect of solvent type, and catalyst/PMHS dosage The type of solvents was found to significantly affect the catalytic activity of KF. The high polarity aprotic solvent such as DMSO and DMF showed satisfactory FUR conversion of 99%, and the latter gave a higher FFA yield of 97% (Fig. S1). In contrast, the protonic solvents (e.g., methanol and n-butanol) displayed inferior performance with FFA yield of 80% and 20%, respectively, most likely due to the negative effect of H-bonding that significantly decreased the nucleophilicity of fluoride ion. In addition, the nonpolar n-hexane lack of polarizability performed the minimum outcome (Fig. S1). These results indicated that the high polar and aprotic solvent were capable of enhancing the reactivity of KF. Fig. S2 shows that the use of 15mg KF is the optimal catalyst dosage for FFA production (94% yield), while the high catalyst dosages (>15mg) show comparable performance or even lower selectivity toward FFA. This is possibly attributed to the physical adsorption of water, where the liberation of the product by hydrolysis is hindered, which could be supported by the recovered FFA selectivity after adding a certain amount of water (ca. 1–2wt%) into the solvent. From a practical and economical point of view, the 15mg catalyst dosage was chosen for later studies. Also, the effect of PMHS dosage on the synthesis of FFA was investigated, wherein a low amount of PMHS (0.5g) could not enough for complete hydrogenation of FUR (84% conversion) to FFA in 82% yield (Fig. S3). This could be ascribed to the release of hydride out of the reaction mixture via the formation of H2, as confirmed by GC–MS. However, the use of more PMHS inhibited the efficiency of KF in the conversion of FUR to FFA with the yield decreasing to 88%, which was most likely to be the encapsulation of KF by PMHS-derived resins [21] that greatly lowered the access of FUR to the active sites (i.e., fluoride ion) inside pores."
11,Catalyst recycling study,"3.4 Catalyst recycling study Catalyst recycling is important for practical applications. In this study, the encapsulation of KF with the PMHS-based resin was found after the first cycle of the reaction, as proven by the XPS spectra of both fresh and recovered KF catalysts (Fig. 1 ). STEM and elemental mappings clearly illustrated the even dispersion of both Si and F species in the recovered catalyst (Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, the recovered catalyst had a larger surface area and pore diameter than the fresh counterparts (Figs.S4–S5), which further verified the formation of PMHS-resin to encapsulate and disperse KF, and increased surface area and pore diameter are the main reasons for good catalytic activity. The KF catalyst recycling results with reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . It was observed that the yield of FFA was only slightly decreased from 93% to 87% in three consecutive cycles. It could be concluded that the active species (e.g., F−) encapsulated by the resin mainly contributed to the almost constant activity of the catalyst."
12,Possible reaction pathway and hydrogenation of other aldehydes,"3.5 Possible reaction pathway and hydrogenation of other aldehydes Prior to discuss the reaction pathway, the adsorption mode of fluoride ion with PMHS was elucidated by 1H and 19F NMR spectra (Fig. 4 ). In detail, the mixture of phenylsilane and DMSO-d 6 were used as control group, while the experimental group was designed by further adding 15mg KF. After stirring for 10min, both samples were sent for NMR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, an addition chemical shift value of 4.7ppm was observed in 1H NMR after the introduction of KF, implying the formation of covalent bond between fluoride and Si species of phenylsilane, which could be further confirmed by 19F NMR (Fig. S6). Therefore, the possible reaction routes for the hydrogenation of FUR to FFA could be elaborated as: fluorine ion as nucleophile first attacks the Si center in PMHS to activate its hydride (H−), followed by transferring the activated hydride to the aldehyde group of FUR via hydrosilylation, and FFA was finally yielded by hydrolysis of the formed siloxane with water that is marginally exist in the solvent (Fig. 5 ) [22]. In view of the high performance of this catalytic system for hydrogenation of FUR to FFA, the substrate scope was also extended in this study. Table S2 shows that all the employed aldehydes can be selectively hydrogenated to corresponding alcohols with high yields 69–97% under mild reaction conditions."
13,Conclusions,"The noble-metal-free and low-cost KF catalyst was highly active for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FFA at room temperature by using industrial byproduct PMHS as liquid H-donor. A high FFA yield of 97% was obtained in 30min, and could be recycled for several consecutive cycles with no distinct loss of activity. This catalytic system was also suitable for the hydrogenation of different types of aldehydes to alcohols. Based on the 1H and 19F NMR spectra, the possible reaction pathway was proposed."
