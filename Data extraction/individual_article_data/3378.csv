0,Introduction,"At present, there is a growing interest in the use of hydrogen as a clean energy vector, especially for power generation in fuel cells. In this respect，hydrogen production from renewable biomass is particularly suitable for sustainable development concerns [1]. The methods of hydrogen production from biomass energy at home and abroad are mainly thermochemical conversion, microbial conversion and chemical reforming. Biomass thermochemical conversion for hydrogen production includes gasification, supercritical conversion, high temperature decomposition and methane, methanol, ethanol conversion and so on [2,3]; the microbial conversion includes direct biological photolysis, indirect biological photolysis, light fermentation, dark fermentation, and microbial fuel cell technology; and the chemical reforming process can also convert methane, methanol, ethanol and other simple compounds into hydrogen [4–7]. To obtain hydrogen from biomass, pyrolysis and gasification are two main effective thermo-chemical conversion methods. In the process of traditional pyrolysis, with air introduced in the overall process, the energy density of gas product is decreased due to the appearance of N2 and CO2 dilution, resulting in increased difficulty in gas separation [8]. More important, large content of tar is a serious threat to the downstream fuel cell system, both for the electrodes and for the pipelines in the traditional gas producing process [9–13]. In the paper, the method of continued pyrolysis was adopted in order to avoid air being introduced, and to improve the purity of hydrogen. Moreover, bio-oil, mixed with the pyrolysis gas, was further decomposed into snygas through the second catalytic cracking. The steam–-iron reaction has been reported as a possible method for H2 production [14–16]: Fe x O y - 1 + H 2 O → Fe x O y + H 2 Furthermore, lattice oxygen in metal oxides can be utilized to reform hydrocarbons [17]. In the case of iron oxide, the stoichiometric equation can be expressed as following: ( 2 n + m ) Fe x O y + C n H 2 m → ( 2 n + m ) Fe x O y - 1 + nCO 2 + mH 2 O Matsuoka et al. [18] found that the cracking of the coke on the iron-oxide particles was the main pathway to increase H2 yield due to iron oxide loading at lower temperatures. Aupretre et al. [19] tested metal Fe supported on Al2O3 was to obtain a catalyst both (i) highly active in the SRR（steam reform reaction: CH4+2H2O = CO2 + 4H2）to maximize the ethanol conversion to hydrogen, that is a high yield in H2 and (ii) highly selective towards the formation of CO2(low CO outlet concentration) both in the SRR and in the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR):CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. On the basis of these literature reports, it is expected that porous alumina impregnated with iron oxide was used to promote material for the steam reforming of rice husk crude gas. And bio-oil could be captured on the alumina and then reformed to produce H2 by a combination of the reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and instruments,"2.1 Reagents and instruments The rice husk in the experiment was purchased from a rice processing plant in Zengcheng, Guangzhou. The distribution of rice husk particle size and approximate analysis result were shown in Table 1 . The compositions of volatile matters are some small molecular gases (such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and etc.) and some organic substances (such as acids, phenols and etc.). Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98.50% in purity) was purchased from Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. in Tianjin. And γ-Al2O3 carrier was purchased from Xinyu Chemical Packing Co., Ltd, whose composition is as follows: SiO2+Al2O3 ≤ 5%, Fe2O3 ≤ 1%, γ-Al2O3 ≥ 93%, D = 3.6–4.7 mm. The H2 (≥99.99% in purity) and N2(≥99.99% in purity) are from Wugang Gas Co., Ltd in Shanghai. The water used in the experiment is deionized. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of catalyst was carried out on the AutoChemII-2920 instrument from Micromeritics Co., Ltd. The 0.05 g of catalyst sample was pretreated by heating in Argon flow to a temperature of 600 °C and keeping the temperature for 2 h in order to remove the adsorbed water and other contaminants and then cooling to 40 °C. Subsequently, the sample was heated up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min while the 10%H2/N2 mixture flowed over it at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The effluent gas passed through a cold trap for removing the water content before the amount of hydrogen consumed during the reduction process being measured by the TCD detector. The scanning electron microscopic analysis on the catalyst was performed by FEI-XL30 environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM) with the accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The X-ray powder diffractograms were recorded following the step-scanning procedure (step size = 0.028, two theta degree scanning from 0 to 80) by using a computerised D/max-Ra diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation, l = 0.15418 nm). At a heating rate of 10 °C/min and a nitrogen flow rate of 50 cm3/min, the thermal analysis (TG and DSC) on the catalyst was carried out on a STA449CJupiter® Simultaneous produced in NETZSCH Co., Ltd of German. A Pt crucible was used to contain about 0.89 mg of sample for the thermal analysis. The Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the catalyst powders (as pellets in KBr) were recorded by using a Fourier transmission infrared spectrometer (Spectrum One FT-IR Spectrometer, Brucker VERTEX70, Germany) within the range of 4000-400 cm−1. For the pyrolysis producer gas, the GC analysis was performed by Agilent 6820 Gas Chromatograph (for H2, CO, CH4, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6) with N2 as carrier gas. The GC is equipped with an HP-PLOT-Q column which is 30 m in length and 30 °C in temperature. The thermal conductivity detector（TCD）temperature was 250 °C."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating γ-Al2O3 with Fe(NO3)3·9H2O aqueous solutions of different concentrations, and stirring for 2 h at room temperature, followed by drying at 70 °C overnight. The material was then calcined in air for 8 h at a desired value among 500 °C and 700 °C. By changing the concentration of Fe (NO3)3·9H2O solution, the Fe dosages in the catalyst were controlled according to the ratios of Fe to Al, which are 0.02, 0.05 and 0.07 respectively."
4,Testing and analysis on the catalytic activity,"2.3 Testing and analysis on the catalytic activity Catalytic tests were conducted by using the biomass continuous pyrolysis system, which was made by us and shown in Fig. 1 . The screw conveyer is made of mild steel, which length and diameter were 1000 mm and 26 mm, respectively. Rice husk was continuously transported to the pyrolysis reactor from the hopper by the screw feeder. The feeding rate was controlled by the rotary speed of the screw. The rice husk feeding rate was 390–410 g/h. The temperature in the pyrolysis reactor was set at 500 °C. The volatile pyrolysis constituents were piped into the catalytic cracking furnace through heat-insulated pipelines. Around 200 g of catalyst was placed in the catalyst bed in a quartz tube reactor fixed by two quartz brackets in the cracking furnace. The catalyst bed temperature was monitored by the central thermocouple in catalytic cracking furnace. For the catalytic test, all the catalysts had been reduced in H2/N2 (10/90 in vol.%) mixture at 800 °C for 120 min with the heating rate of 10 °C/min. After reduction of the catalyst, the catalytic cracking experiment was conducted. The charcoal yielded from rice husk pyrolysis, which is 32–35% of the total weight of rice husk, was pushed into the char box by the screw. The gas flow rate was measured by a gas flowmeter. The pyrolysis gas, which was collected every 5 min with collecting bag, was analyzed by GC (Agilent GC6820). The concentration of H2, CO, CH4, CO2, C2 (C2H4 and C2H6) were determined on the composition of syngas basis. For example, the concentration of H2 was calculated by following equations, WH2 = VH2/(VH2+VCO2+VCO+VCH4+VC2)，WC2 = VC2/(VH2 +VCO2+VCO+VCH4+VC2) T 0: Calcinations temperature，T 1: Pyrolysis temperature，T 2: Secondary catalyst cracking temperature，Fe/Al: Fe/Al mass ratio，WH2: Concentration of H2, WH2 = VH2/Vgases. WHSV: weight hourly space velocity, WHSV = rice husk feeding rate/the mass of catalyst."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The effect of Fe/Al and secondary catalyst cracking temperature on the gas product distribution,"3.1 The effect of Fe/Al and secondary catalyst cracking temperature on the gas product distribution Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 compare the results collected in 60 min on stream, which shows significant differences in the gaseous products distribution depending on the catalysts used and reaction conditions. The most active catalyst is prepared under the condition (Fe/Al = 0.07:1, calcinations temperature: 550 °C) and used at 700 °C with an outlet H2 concentration of 31.19%. When secondary catalyst cracking proceeds at 600 °C and 800 °C respectively, which give similar H2 concentration values of around 27% but the WC2 is larger for the latter (3.52%) than the former (1.72%). Fig. 2 also indicates the influence of Fe loading on the performance of catalysts. The H2 production is promoted when Fe/Al increases from 0.02 wt% to 0.07 wt%, but it does not change so much with further increase in the metal loading. It is interesting thatγ-Al2O3 support is also active and it gives an H2 concentration of 12.31%. Blank experiments were carried out in the absence of catalyst in order to evaluate the part of thermal reactions in the cracking process. With the absence of catalyst, the husk rice is decomposed into H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as the main gaseous products. C2 (C2H4 and C2H6) is also present in low amount. Comparing the gaseous products streams obtained during a thermal cracking with catalyst absence and most active catalyst, we found that the latter one produces a reformat which is more concentrated in H2 and CO2, slightly more in CH4, and significant less in CO than the one without catalyst."
7,The effect of catalyst on bio-oil pyrolysis,"3.2 The effect of catalyst on bio-oil pyrolysis On the condition that the pyrolysis temperature is 500 °C, the secondary cracking temperature is 600 °C, and with the absence of the catalyst, the composition of the bio-oil production was shown in Table 2 , the bio-oil production rate on this condition was 113.65–120.58 g/h. At the same pyrolysis temperature and the same secondary cracking temperature, with the addition of the catalyst(Fe/Al: 0.07:1) that was calcined at the mere temperature of 500 °C, the bio-oil production rate could be 81.71–84.42 g/h, meanwhile, the composition of the bio-oil production had been changed to some extent as shown in Table 2. It is found that the relative content of acetic acid has been significantly decreased compared with the component of remainder. Meanwhile, the content of 2-propanone increased evidently in the remainder. It concluded that the reaction of ketonization of acetic acid: 2CH3COOH → (CH3)2CO + H2O + CO2 had occurred. This is consistent with the results of Rajadurai [20] who had reported that, under the catalyst of transition metal oxide, the process of carboxylic acid pyrolysis will form with acetone. Besides, acetic acid would further reformed onto the catalyst by the steam contained in husk rich or forming by pyrolysis. Nobuhiro et al. [21] who studied hydrogen production by steam catalyst reforming of acetic acid, summed up some possible reaction pathways as follows: Steam reforming of acetic acid: CH3COOH + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 4H2, Decomposition of acetic acid:CH3COOH → CO2 + CH4, CH3COOH → CO + H2. It was also emphasized that production distribution in the steam reforming of acetic acid varied with catalysts used in the paper [21]. It also was reported that the selectivity was changed by reaction temperature [22,23]. All that would partly explained why the concentration of H2, CO etc is significantly different,when the mass rate of actively material and secondary catalyst cracking temperature were changed as showed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3."
8,The activity and deactivation of catalyst,"3.3 The activity and deactivation of catalyst Fig. 4 showed X-ray diffraction patterns for Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts which were calcined at 500 °C and 700 °C，respectively. The special peaks as sign of γ-Al2O3 and Fe2O3 were observed for both samples. Meanwhile, the diffraction peak intensity of crystal Fe2O3 would be decreased with the calcination temperature increasing, which attributed to the small particle that can not be detected and more extensive dispersion of Fe2O3 crystal. The crystallite diameters of Fe2O3 calculated from Fe2O3 diffraction line (PDF No.089-0599, 2θ = 33.19, h k l:104) by using the Scherer equation are 26 nm and 28 nm when the catalyst is calcined at 500 °C and 700 °C, respectively. After several cracking, the diameters of Fe2O3 got to 31 nm (calcined at 500 °C). Being calcined at 700 °C, the special peaks of crystalline FeAl2O4 appeared. It was concluded that some Fe2O3 crystal melted with the γ-Al2O3 forming FeAl2O4 (iron spinel) solid-melt. This is consistent with Zhang [24] who found: around 800 °C, some NiOx crystal melted with the γ-Al2O 3 divorced from support, forming NiAl2O4 (nickel spine) solid-melt material which is more stable than NiOx crystal, but can not be reduced easily, even at the temperature 1000 °C [25]. However, it was reported in a patent [26] that by the action of hydrogen flooding, composite metal catalyst can be reduced easily when active constituent and spine coexisted in catalyst with appropriate mass rate. So it is very important to control the content of active constituent and calcination temperature in order to gain the catalyst with good stability and high activity. In the XRD pattern of regeneration catalyst, diffraction peak intensity of FeAl2O4 further increased. Because NiOx crystal melted with the γ-Al2O3 further, as the catalyst was used and regenerated at high temperature. The result of the TPR-H2 of the calcinated Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was presented in Fig. 5 . It showed a reduction peak centered at 247.5 °C, which was attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. And the reduction head peaks centered at 468.7 °C and 523.6°Ccorresponded to the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and FeO to metallic Fe0 [25], respectively. In the investigation of Swierczynski.D [27], he had pointed out that at a high calcination, Fe3+ divorced from silicate frame in the olivine, was reduced into Fe2+or Fe0, which serve as the active centre, but not Fe3+ itself [28]. None more than the action of oxidation and reduction of Fe caused the bio-oil being catalytic converted by olivine. In the paper, the catalyst was reduced at 800 °C in order to gain the active centre Fe2+ and Fe0 Fig. 6. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) studies performed on the monoliths before and after reaction. Fig. 6 (B) reveals the presence of a thick carbon film at the channels inlet on catalyst. In addition, the catalyst also presents small accumulations of carbon filaments, detected in the monolith channels after cracking. In Fig. 7 , the curve of TG shows that catalyst decreased about 10% from 287 °C to 512 °C, which is just the mass of the thick carbon film. Some organic with –OH, CC or cyclic bond (analyst by FT-IR) accumulated on the surface of catalyst, which forms carbon film. The rate of coke formation on Fe, like Ni, strongly depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon, among which olefins and aromatics lead to rapid coke deposition [29,30]. Bio-oil is first decomposed into soot [1], containing many unsaturated compounds, which then reacts with the Fe phase depending on its structure，the soot can be catalytically transformed into whiskers, Whatever the catalyst, the total amount of coke deposits depends only on the primary decomposition of bio-oils into soot. On the Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, where rather large Fe particles are present after several cracking, carbon whiskers form during the cracking of bio-oil."
9,Overall pathways scheme,"3.4 Overall pathways scheme Biomass → CO , H 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O , CH 4 + hydrocarbons bio - oil + char + ash (1) H 2 S + HCN + NH 3 + HCl + sulfur species (2) CnHm + nH 2 O → nCO + ( n + m / 2 ) H 2 ( steam reforming ) (3) CnHm + nCO 2 → ( 2 n ) CO + ( m / 2 ) H 2 ( dry reforming ) (4) Fe 3 O 4 + CO → 3 FeO + CO 2 (5) 3 FeO + H 2 O → Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 (6) CH 4 + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + CO (7) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 (8) C + H 2 O → H 2 + CO (9) CnHmOk → CxHyOz + carbon + gases ( H 2 ;CO;CO 2 ;CH 4 ; … C x H x + 2 ) In the processes of biomass catalyst cracking [31], both thermal cracking and catalytic reformation are coexisting. However, the catalyst has a marked impact on product distribution. Generally, solid biomass thermochemically convert into a gas-phase mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), organic vapors, tars (benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons), water vapor, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), residual solids, and other trace species (HCN, NH3, and HCl), depending upon process conditions. The general reaction of biomass gasification is shown in Eq. (1) Important catalytic reactions in the conversion of biomass to fuels that influence the gaseous products composition (steam reforming, dry reforming, and water-gas shift) are listed in Eqs. (2) and (3) [31]. As pointed out by Wang et al. [32], oxygenated compounds are thermally unstable at the high temperatures reached in a reformer. There is always a significant competition between thermal decomposition and catalytic reforming reactions. The thermal decomposition of bio-oil in the empty reactor leads to the formation of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as main gaseous products, and to significant amounts of soot-like deposits along the reactor walls and downstream the reacting zone. These results are consistent with high thermal instability of bio-oils [1]. As shown in Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3, the first effect of the catalyst is to reduce the CO formation at the benefit of H2 and CO2. This is consistent with the investigation of Matsuoka et al. [18], who had found that the action of oxidation and reduction of Fe,testified that Fe/A12O3 catalyst promoted gaseous products catalytic reform by the reaction pathways (Eqs. (4)–(5)). Since water is one of the main productions by biomass catalyst cracking. The Fe-based catalysts are expected to catalyst the steam reforming of methane issued from the thermal decomposition (Eq.(6)). In the same way, CO is also expected to react with steam according to the WGS reaction (Eq.(7)). Note that methane dry reforming (with CO2 instead of H2O) might also play some role in this process [33]. Another major effect of the catalyst is to increase significantly the proportion of bio-oil gasification versus. Coke/soot deposition. Considering the soot as simply consisting in carbon, though it probably also contains adsorbed O and H compounds, it can also be steam reformed according to Eq.(8). An additional feature of the catalyst effect is reflected by the reactions about acetic acid which has been interpreted in the preceding part of the paper. Moreover, the thermal decomposition (Eq.(9)) has also to be considered for most of the oxygenated organic compounds [33]."
10,Conclusion,"The Fe/γ-Al2O3 exhibited good performances for H2 production from biomass. The gaseous products stream consisted in 30–35% H2. Comparison of the pyrolysis of biomass (empty reactor) with the catalytic cracking revealed that processes of thermal decomposition and catalytic reformation were co-existent. The key roles of the catalyst are therefore (i) to improve the overall biomass pyrolysis into gaseous products or bio-oil (ii) to promote bio-oil decomposed into gaseous products and increase hydrogen production by steam (contained in biomass) reactions, steam reforming and WGS and (iii) to control and determine the nature of the coke formed during the cracking/reforming step. In addition, the activity centre of Fe/γ-Al2O3 is Fe2+ and Fe0. Redox reactions may occur on the iron oxide with gaseous products, which will be study at next step."
