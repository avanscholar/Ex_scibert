0,Introduction,"Due to the shortage of fossil fuels and the increasingly serious environmental problems that have severely impacted the sustainable development of human beings, developing alternative energy, especially clean and renewable energy has become a primary task [1–3]. Since the discovery of photodecomposition of water with TiO2 into H2 and O2 by Fujishima and Honda [4], photocatalytic water splitting has attracted much attention because it has been proved to be a simple and environmentally friendly way to convert solar energy into the chemical energy of hydrogen, which is thought to be an ideal fuel in the future [5–7]. According to Domen, an efficiency of 10% was necessary to realize the industrial application of such approach of energy conversion [8]. Thus stable photocatalysts, usually semiconductors with high activity, play the most significant role in the whole photocatalytic water splitting process. For an ideal photocatalyst, a suitable band gap is essential, which should be wide enough to decompose water and narrow enough to utilize as many photons as possible in the solar irradiation [9]. The most suitable band gap should be between 1.23eV and 3.0eV. Sacrifice agents are often used as photo-induced hole consumer when O2 evolution is not required, which gives more choices in catalysts since the position of the top of the valence band is not necessary to be more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23eV). In recent years, a variety of materials have been found to be capable of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Among them, some Dion–Jacobson phase niobates formulated as AB2Nb3O10 (A=H, K, Rb, Cs; B=Ca, Sr, Pb) have attracted broad attention because of their unique layered structure and excellent photocatalytic performance [10–14]. AB2Nb3O10 are constructed by perovskite nanosheets that are formed by corner shared NbO6 octahedrons. These nanosheets are stacked along the c axis with a dislocation of a/2 along the a axis between adjacent layers. The nanosheets are electronegative and the alkaline cations are located in the interlayer space to keep electron neutral. This unique structure which is beneficial to charge separation has been proven to be responsible for the superior performance of AB2Nb3O10. The alkaline ions in the interlayer space can be replaced by H+ ions. The proton exchanged form is able to be hydrated and in this case the reactants such as water or methanol molecules can migrate into the interlayer place and participate in photocatalytic reaction, which leads to a reduced migration distance of the photo-induced carriers. As a consequence, the recombination of electrons and holes are effectively suppressed and higher activity is to be expected [10]. Some modification methods, such as pillaring, exfoliation or loading cocatalysts, can adjust the structure of AB2Nb3O10 or bring in new active sites, promoting the activity [15–18]. However, with a wide band gap (usually larger than 3.0eV), AB2Nb3O10 often shows high activity under UV light and rather low activity under visible light. The modifications mentioned above fail to improve the visible-light activity because the band gap energy hasn’t been changed. To better use the solar irradiation, more than 40% of which is composed by visible light, a narrower band gap is necessary [9]. Doping is known as a common strategy to adjust the band gap of semiconductors in order to expand their light response and promote the separation of holes and electrons. Our previous work has proved that the activity of KSr2Nb3O10 can be improved by doping a suitable amount of Cr, because the d3 configuration of Cr3+ splits into t2g and eg orbits in the MO6 octahedron, forming new acceptor levels between the conduction band and the valence band of KSr2Nb3O10 [19]. Among all the AB2Nb3O10 type niobates, only HPb2Nb3O10 shows activity under visible light because of its relatively narrow band gap (2.58eV) [20]. In this paper, we expected to adjust its band gap structure by doping Cr element into the crystal lattice of HPb2Nb3O10 so that more visible light could be utilized. Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10 were synthesized by a solid-state reaction followed by H+ exchange. The Cr3+ replaced the Nb5+ in the crystal lattice of HPb2Nb3O10 because they have a similar ion radius. Different means of characterizations revealed the structural and optical change after doping. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was tested under visible-light irradiation. The results showed a remarkable enhancement of the activity after doping a suitable amount of Cr, which was twice as high as that of undoped HPb2Nb3O10. The relationship between structure adjustments and the enhanced activity was specifically discussed in this paper."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10,"2.1 Preparation of Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10 A series of Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10 (designated as H1−2x Pb2Nb3−x Cr x O10) was prepared by a solid state reaction followed by a proton exchange reaction. Rb2CO3 (AR), PbO (AR), Nb2O5 (AR) and Cr2O3 (AR) were mixed with a stoichiometric ratio of 1+2x:4:3− x:x (x =0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4). About 20% excess Rb2CO3 was added to the mixture to compensate for the loss due to volatilization during the following calcination. The mixture was ground for 1h in alcohol and then calcined in air at 1073K for 2h using a corundum crucible and a muffle furnace. The preheated mixtures were reground and then calcined at 1273K for 48h with a grinding after 24h of calcination. The reaction equation is described as follows: (1+2x)Rb2CO3 +4PbO+(3− x)Nb2O5 + x Cr2O3 →2Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3−x Cr x O10 +(1+2x)CO2↑ After cooled to room temperature, the products were washed with distilled water to remove the unreacted Rb2CO3, and then air dried at room temperature. H1−2x Pb2Nb3−x Cr x O10 was prepared by stirring Rb1−2x Pb2Nb3−x Cr x O10 (5g) in 6M HCl (200mL) at room temperature for 3 days, with daily centrifugation and renewal of the acid solution. As has been determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum, more than 96% of the Rb+ were replaced by H+ after 3 days of proton exchange. The solids were centrifugally separated, washed with distilled water to remove residual acid and dried at room temperature."
3,Pt loaded onto Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10,"2.2 Pt loaded onto Cr-doped HPb2Nb3O10 An amount of 0.5g H1−2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 was added into 200mL 20vol% methanol aqueous solution, which contained 1.05mg of H2PtCl6, corresponding to 0.1wt% Pt with respect to H1−2x Pb2Nb3−x Cr x O10. The solution was stirred in a Pyrex reaction cell under irradiation from a 300W Xe lamp for 60min in a N2 atmosphere to photo deposit Pt particles onto the samples. The prepared samples were designated as H1−2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal structures of the samples were studied by X-ray diffraction using a PANalytical X’pert MPD diffractometer. Cu Kα radiation was used with an operating condition of 40kV and 40mA. The wide angle XRD patterns of the samples were obtained with a rate of 2°/min in 2θ range from 10° to 80° while low angle XRD patterns were obtained in a similar method but with a scanning speed of 1°/min in 2θ range from 0.5° to 10° [21]. The optical absorption property and band gap structure were studied by UV–vis absorption spectrum between 300nm and 700nm with a scan rate of 5nm/s using a HITA-CHI U-4100 spectrometer. BaSO4 was used as reference. The energy gap was estimated by K–M method [21,22]. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM: JSM-6701F, JEOL, Japan) with accelerating voltage of 15kV was used to reveal the morphologies of the samples [23]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to measure the surface elements with a Kratos spectrometer (AXIS Ultra DLD). Monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν =1486.69eV) and a concentric hemispherical analyzer (15kV and 8mA) were used and the sample analysis chamber was under high vacuum (<3×10−9 Torr). High-resolution (pass energy 40eV, step size 50meV) spectra was obtained with an analysis area of 300×700μm and with charge corrected according to C 1s peak of adsorption carbon which was set to 284.5eV. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the samples were detected with a PTI fluorescence spectrophotometer and excitation wavelength of 320nm [24]."
5,Photocatalytic tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic tests Photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a 250mL Pyrex reactor, which was externally placed a 300W xenon lamp. The system temperature was maintained at 303K by circulating cooling water [25]. AB2Nb3O10 type niobates have been proved to be incapable of overall water splitting [10]. That is because H2O tend to decompose into H2 and O2 under alkaline condition, which is detrimental to the hydration of AB2Nb3O10. Therefore methanol is frequently used as a sacrificial agent to consume holes and to realize H2 evolution. In this work, the catalyst (0.5g) was dispersed in a methanol aqueous solution (200mL, 20vol%) by drastic stirring and the whole system was purged by nitrogen for 30min before the irradiation. A 400nm filter was used to filter out the UV light from the Xenon lamp irradiation. The amount of evolved H2 was detected and calculated by chromatography with a NaX zeolite column and an online thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The nitrogen was used as carrier gas."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical properties of catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of catalysts Fig. 1 shows powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10. The XRD patterns of RbPb2Nb3O10 are also displayed as comparisons. All the H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 samples exhibit single phase diffraction patterns assigned to tetragonal unit cells with a =0.393nm, c =1.53nm, which match well with the literature [26]. An obvious alteration was observed in the diffraction pattern of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 when compared to RbPb2Nb3O10. As a typical Dion–Jacobson perovskite, RbPb2Nb3O10 is constituted by negative [Pb2Nb3O10]− nanosheets and interlayer dispersive Rb+. These nanosheets are stacked with a dislocation of a/2 along the a axis and bonded by static force [20,27–29]. HPb2Nb3O10 was derived from RbPb2Nb3O10 by H+ replacing Rb+. Such dislocation of adjacent layers was then eliminated because of the spontaneous hydration of hydrogenous derivant and the enlarged interlayer distance [30]. A halved lattice period at the c axis was expected, which was confirmed by the large shift of diffraction peaks such as those assigned to (004), (006), (106) planes [31]. The diffraction patterns of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 almost remained unchanged with the increased Cr content indicating an unchanged crystal form. No characteristic peaks ascribed to chromium oxides were observed. However, this was not a rigorous evidence in support of that the Cr3+ ions have been doped into the HPb2Nb3O10 lattice, as H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 was prepared by H+ exchange with HCl solution. Remaining Cr2O3 on the surface of Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10, if there was any, would dissolve in acid. However, as can be seen from the amplified XRD patterns (Fig. 1b), the peaks ascribed to the (110) planes slightly shift to higher angles with an increasing amount of Cr, certifying successful doping of Cr3+. The shift was due to the substitution of ions with different ionic radius. The ionic radius of Cr3+, Pb2+ and Nb5+ is 0.062, 0.12 and 0.065nm, respectively. A great lattice distortion would be introduced if Pb2+ were replaced by Cr3+ because of the huge gaps between their ionic radiuses. In this case, a dramatic change in diffraction patterns would be witnessed. In fact, the small shift observed in Fig. 1 b strongly proved that Cr3+ replaced Nb5+ which possess a similar ionic radius. Additionally, a prominent decrease in the degree of crystallinity was observed with the highest doping content, indicative of the maximum limit of doping amount. Fig. 1c shows low angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10, and the positions of the diffraction peaks reflect the expansion of the c-parameter. Contrary to the (110) plane diffraction peak, the peak ascribed to (001) plane moved to lower angles with an increasing amount of Cr, representing an enlarged c-parameter, even though the ionic radius of Cr3+ is smaller than that of Nb5+. This was because when increased number of Cr3+ were doped, the amount of Rb+ held in the interlayer space of Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 increased in order to maintain the electric neutrality. In this case, more H+ ions migrated into the interlayer space upon exchange for Rb+, which resulted in an enhanced intercalation of guest molecules such as water and methanol by spontaneous hydration and the expansion of the interlayer space [32]. Fig. 2 displays the SEM photographs of the H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 samples. The inserted figures refer to the SEM photographs of the corresponding Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10. All the samples were crystalline and the basic lamellar morphologies remained unchanged upon H+ exchange [11,19,33]. For the parent material Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10, the layered morphology maintained after Cr3+ doping and the particle size remained in the same level. The sizes of lamellas of each sample ranged between 1μm and 10μm, and the variety was related to the uneven synthesis because of the non-uniform mixing [34]. The shape of the lamella changed dramatically. RbPb2Nb3O10 showed an irregular lamella morphology while the shape of these lamellas shifted to roundness when x =0.01. Then, with the increase of doping amount, the lamella shape gradually transformed to square with increasingly sharper edges and corners. The reason for this shape transformation is still under investigation. It is assumed that Cr3+ ions prevented sintering of RbPb2Nb3O10, leading to formation of finer crystalline particles and promoted anisotropic crystal growth as well [35]. For H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 samples, a large amount of lamella fragments were generated during the H+ exchange process because of severe stirring as well as the expansion of interlayer space, making the shape change less obvious. The enlarged adjacent layer distance also resulted in a book like morphology. Each lamella was stacked by several slices. Each slice was about 50nm thick and consisted of several [Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10](1 + 2x)− nanosheets. We also analyzed the surface elements by XPS spectra. For H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 samples, the yellowish green color suggested that chromium existed as trivalent chromium [36]. However, as can be seen from Fig. 3a, no peaks assigned to the Cr species in the XPS spectra were found even from H1.8Pb2Nb2.6Cr0.4O10, which was with the highest doping content, while two peaks were observed at 585.8eV and 576.1eV (corresponding to 588.4eV and 578.7eV, respectively, after correction according to C 1s base peak) which were assigned to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Cr3+ species, respectively, corresponding with Cr2O3, at the XPS spectra of its parent form, Rb1.8Pb2Nb2.6Cr0.4O10 [36]. The intensity of Cr XPS peaks in the Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x C x O10 samples decreased with the reduction of x value and vanished when x <0.05. These results indicated that the increasing doping content led to the gradually increased unreacted Cr2O3 clusters on the surface of Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x C x O10 [37]. These Cr2O3 clusters were removed by HCl during proton exchange process [36]. That is why no peaks assigned to the Cr species were detected from H1+2x Pb2Nb3−x C x O10 samples. Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. 3 b,c, with the increase of Cr3+ content in H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10, the binding energies of Nb 3d and O 1s moves to higher regions, indicating that part of the Cr3+ were successfully doped and the doped Cr3+ were not removed by acid solution. However, the XPS peaks of Cr species couldn’t be observed because the Cr content in the surface phase of H1.8Pb2Nb2.6Cr0.4O10 was relatively low. The Cr3+ ions were slightly smaller than Nb5+, thus the introducing of Cr3+ and the formation of Cr–O bond gave rise to lattice distortion. The changed chemical environment of H1+2 x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 surface resulted in the movement of Nb 3d and O 1s XPS peaks [38]. Fig. 4 shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10. Instead of bringing additional absorption peaks in the visible light region, the presence of the Cr3+ ions caused significant red shift of the whole absorption bands, indicating that doped Cr3+ adjusted the energy band by orbital hybridization rather than introducing discontinuous impurity band [39]. The Cr 3d orbital is supposed to decompose into two parts in NbO6 octahedron: t2g state in the lower energy region and eg state in the higher energy region [40]. For the lead-containing niobates, the empty Nb 4d contributes to form the conduction band, and the occupied Pb 6s and O 2p contribute to form the valence band [41]. The additional hybridization of occupied t2g orbitals of Cr 3d with O 2p pushes up the valence band, and leads to a narrower band gap of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 [19,42]. After Cr3+ were introduced, the hybridized band of Pb 6s orbital and O 2p orbitals located below the top of the valence band. Band gap energies of the samples were calculated by the K–M method [27] using the following function: a h υ = A ( h υ − E g ) 2 where a, h and υ are the absorption coefficient, Plank constant and light frequency, respectively. Since the A is a constant in a certain condition, the energy gap (E g) is obtained by plotting (ahυ)1/2 with respect to hυ, followed by extending the linear portion of the curve to the abscissa axis. The as obtained intercept is equal to the value of E g. It was calculated that the band gap energy of HPb2Nb3O10 decreased from 2.58eV to 2.29eV. Another phenomenon that can be seen from Fig. 4 is that there is an increased absorption in the visible light region in the range of 500–600nm. Recent researches certified that absorption in this region was due to colored centers generated from oxygen vacancies [43]. The increased oxygen vacancies demonstrated that the loss of positive charge caused by Cr3+ substituting for Nb5+ was not completely compensated for by increased interlayer cations. The lattice defects were inevitably introduced by a high content of Cr3+."
8,Photocatalytic performances of catalysts,"3.2 Photocatalytic performances of catalysts In this paper, the activity of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 was tested in two conditions. The only difference of these two conditions was whether a 400nm filter was used. Different amounts of doped chromium led to big changes in the activity of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 as can be seen in Fig. 5. When no filter was used, the activity was increased with Cr content up to x =0.05, thereafter it was decreased with increasing Cr content. When x =0.05, the rate of hydrogen evolution reached 110μmol/h/gcat, which was almost twice as much as that of HPb2Nb3O10 without doping. But the activity became lower than the undoped sample when x ≥0.2. When the filter was used, similar changing trends have been observed but with an even more remarkable enhancement of activity. The activity of Rb1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 was also tested. However, none of these samples showed H2 evolution activity under full-arc or visible-light irradiation, confirming the importance of H+ exchange in adsorption of reactants in the interlayer space [10,32]. Several factors contribute to the change of activity. First of all, a decrease of the band gap means more photons were harvested. Photocatalytic process is started with light absorption and the transition of induced electrons from VB to CB. The excitation of electrons can only be initiated by absorption of photons with energy equal to or higher than the band gap of the catalyst. Therefore, under same light irradiation, more electrons can be excited in semiconductors with narrower band gaps to participate in the reduction reaction of H+. In this sense, Cr3+ doping is beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Second, as the content of doped Cr was increased, more H+ were exchanged into the interlayer space, which results in enhanced intercalation of reactants into the interlayer space such as water and methanol, enhancing the activity. Furthermore, discrete lattice defects caused by a small amount of Cr3+ replacing Nb5+ inhibited the recombination and prolonged the lifetime of the charge carriers. The photo-induced charge carriers can recombine on the surface or in the bulk of the semiconductors [44]. Once such recombination was restrained, more induced electrons can be used to reduce water into H2 [5]. As can be seen from the photoluminescence spectra of H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 (Fig. 6), the PL signals at about 450nm were due to the band–band transition of excited electrons, and directly reflected the recombination of photo-induced carriers in the bulk [44]. On the whole, this PL signal reduced with the increased Cr, indicating reduced recombination of photoinduced carriers [42]. Upon irradiation, electron transited from the doping level introduced by Cr3+ to the CB to reduce water, leaving behind Cr4+ with d2 electron configuration. The high state Cr4+ generated a stronger electrostatic field and hence an electron was easily trapped. Meanwhile, because of the John–Teller effect, lattice distortion was introduced and the donor level was lowered so that it was able to partly overlap with O 2p orbital to form a hybrid orbital, facilitating the migration of generated holes to react with methanol. Therefore the modicum Cr3+ worked as shallow traps for holes as well as active sites, resulting in extended life time of carriers [30]. However, as can be seen from Fig. 6 , when x ≥0.2, the PL signals increased with the increasing Cr content instead. That was because when excessive Cr3+ ions were introduced, the proliferation of lattice defects resulted in their aggregation and formation of shipshape defect clusters, which were considered to be the recombination centers of electrons and holes in the bulk [19,45]. In addition, the more low state Cr3+ were doped to substitute for high state Nb5+, the more surface defects caused by oxygen vacancies were introduced [46]. These surface defects were thought to be surface recombination centers and were detrimental to H2 generation [47,48]. In such recombination process excited electrons transited from the sub-bands (or surface states) to the VB and such transition has little contribution to the band–band PL signals [44]. That is why H1.1Pb2Nb2.95Cr0.05O10 (x =0.05) showed a higher activity but with a higher band–band PL signals when compared with H1.2Pb2Nb2.9Cr0.1O10 (x =0.1). Fig. 5 also demonstrates that a more remarkable enhancement of activity with Cr doping occurred when the 400nm filter was used. This is because when the irradiation light was limited to visible light, the band gap of photocatalysts played a much more important role, especially when the onset of the absorption curve was not far from 400nm. The slight red shift to the absorption edges resulted in a huge increase in the number of photons that the catalysts harvested. Hence, doping Cr3+ enhanced the activity dramatically. H1.1Pb2Nb2.95Cr0.05O10 showed the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate among all the samples. To evaluate its stability under visible-light irradiation, time course of H2 evolution is depicted in Fig. 5 c where the amounts of evolved H2 are plotted against reaction time. The reaction was continued for 30h and the gas phase was evacuated at every 10h of reaction. The sample displayed stable activity which remained unchanged throughout, indicating its well stability."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, a series of layered H1+2x Pb2Nb3− x Cr x O10 were synthesized by a solid-state reaction followed by a proton exchange reaction. It was proved that Cr3+ ions were doped into the crystal lattice and replaced Nb5+ ions. Because of the hybridization of occupied t2g orbitals of Cr 3d with O 2p orbitals, the bandgap energy decreased from 2.58eV to 2.29eV. The highest photocatalytic activity was obtained from H1.1Pb2Nb2.95Cr0.05O10. The enhancement of activity was mainly due to a narrower band gap and the restrained recombination of photoinduced carriers in the bulk caused by doping appropriate amount of Cr3+."
