0,Introduction,"Esters represent one of the most important chemicals widely used in pharmaceutical, material, and other fine chemical fields. In practice, esters are generally prepared by the reaction of carboxylic acid and their derivatives with alcohols (Scheme S1) [1]. The oxidative esterification of aldehydes also proved to be an effective methodology [2], but this strategy was heavily restricted by the requirement of environmentally detrimental heavy metal salts as oxidants or catalysts [3]. As the fermentation product of renewable plant-derived materials, the direct transformation of alcohols into esters has attracted remarkable attention. The approach could avoid the use of hazardous acid derivatives and eliminate the generation of undesirable products, leading to significantly improved process efficiencies [4]. Among the various alcohol conversion strategies, the direct oxidation of alcohols into esters using molecular oxygen is undoubtedly attractive [5]. Although most of the reported studies rely on homogeneous catalytic systems (Scheme S2a), heterogeneous systems based on cobalt, gold, and palladium salts, with the advantage of high stability and ease of separation and recovery, have also been investigated for this transformation (Scheme S2b) [6–13]. These processes reported so far are associated with precious or rare metals, and additional acid/base/additive is usually required to activate the substrate and drive the equilibrium toward product formation. Consequently, the development of an efficient metal-free catalytic system for the oxidative esterification of alcohols under mild conditions is very attractive but is still challenging. As a clean and renewable energy source, sunlight can provide sufficient energy to drive challenging chemical reactions in an eco-friendly fashion and may play a decisive role in the future global raw material supply [14–19]. Heterogeneous photocatalyzed selective oxidation of alcohols is a critical synthetic transformation in the chemical, materials, fragrance, and pharmaceutical industry, as it could provide a direct approach for the preparation of various chemicals such as aldehydes, ketones, diols, acetals, and esters [20–24]. As an important metal-free photocatalyst, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has been widely used in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation due to its unique physicochemical properties, high-stability, non-toxicity, adjustable electronic structure as well as energy band positions [25,26]. Notwithstanding enormous efforts have been dedicated to developing PCN photocatalyzed oxidation of alcohols in the past decades, pristine PCN and its derivatives seem to possess poor efficiency for ester generation thus far [27]. Aldehyde formation typically prevails in these reactions, i.e. oxidation stops at the intermediate product [28]. Very few systems for the conversion of alcohols to the corresponding esters are known, but necessitate the use of metals or metal oxides, relatively harsh reaction conditions, or the employment of peroxides, rendering their industrial application rather difficult (Scheme S2b) [29,30]. The catalytic and selective oxidative esterification of alcohols with molecular oxygen is apparently very difficult, especially at neutral pH and when employing metal-free catalytic systems. Given these high goals, promoting the catalytic activity of polymeric carbon nitride represents a promising, direct approach to meet the requirements of green chemistry (Scheme S2c). Theoretically, ideal photocatalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to esters must possess the desired properties for the common photocatalytic processes, i.e., an appropriate bandgap that can harvest visible light, suitable locations of conduction, and valance bands that provide sufficient reducing and oxidizing potentials for the specific target reactions, and an efficient charge separation/transfer. Most of all, the photocatalysts must exhibit a high affinity for the educts and intermediates, which is here providing sufficient aldehyde adsorption/activation sites. We assume that the adsorption and activation of the intermediate aldehyde by photocatalysts is of great significance as it is the key step to promote the oxidative esterification process as well as to suppress the competitive reactions, particularly acid generation [31]. On the basis of the fact that catalytic acids have been frequently used as an additive in esterification processes to activate the carbonyl group and increase the condensation conversion, we anticipate that a photocatalyst coupled with engineered surface acid sites could boost the condensation step of the intermediate aldehyde with alcohol, thus improving overall the photocatalytic performance [32]. In this regard, an integrated photocatalyst design that relies on the synergy of the visible-light response and surface acid sites should in principle be particularly effective toward this goal. Up to now, protonation is considered as a facile and effective method to provide PCN with specific properties such as solubility, ferromagnetism, positive surface charge, and improved photocatalytic H2 or O2 evolution efficiency [33–37]. Herein, we demonstrate that a carbon nitride with engineered surface acidic sites is indeed a promising visible-light photocatalyst for performing metal- and additive-free oxidative esterification of alcohols under ambient conditions. The protonation of carbon nitride enables the imparted surface acidic sites to adsorb and activate the carbonyl group of the aldehyde/acetal intermediate but also up-shifts the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the photo-catalyst to improve its oxygen reduction potential. An optimized PCN with surface acidic sites thus exhibits significantly enhanced efficiency in promoting the catalytic oxidation and the subsequent cross-esterification of alcohols to esters. The observed activity was even higher than the state-of-the-art transition-metal catalysts (like Ru- and Ir- complexes), further demonstrating the advantage of light-driven reactions using the surface engineered polymeric carbon nitride materials."

11,Computational details,"2.10 Computational details All the spin-polarized calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Packages (VASP), the projected-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were utilized to describe the core electrons while a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used to treat the valence electrons. The exchange–correlation potential was treated by the Perdew − Burke − Ernzerhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).

13,Results and discussion,
14,Catalyst synthesis and Characterization.,"3.1 Catalyst synthesis and Characterization. The present catalytic system derives from polymeric carbon nitride after molten salt treatment (MCN), showing good performance in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes [38]. MCN was then treated with hydrochloric acid (HCl), generating an HMCN-species (Scheme S3). A series of HMCN samples were obtained by treating MCN with different concentrations of hydrochloric acid, where the obtained samples were denoted as HMCN-x (where x refers to the concentrations of HCl). Considering the fact that the surface of carbon nitride has many basic sites, it is nearby to assume that treatment with acid would lead to the protonation of base functionalities [39]. More information about the materials synthesis can be found in the experimental section ( Supporting Information ). To show the difference between HMCN-x samples and MCN, we choose in the following series of characterization experiments HMCN-2 as the representative. The morphology of the carbon nitride samples is characterized by irregular dense and stacked particles and sheets, as revealed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation ( Fig. S1 and 1 a), and does not change too much after treatment with acid. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of HMCN-2 and MCN showed approximately identical patterns (Fig. 1 b), indicating no significant change in the bulk structure of the samples after protonation. Additionally, like MCN, HMCN-2 has around 20 wt% water included, based on its thermogravimetric analysis ( Fig. S2 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis ( Fig. S3 a and S3b) showed that both MCN and HMCN-2 are mainly composed of C and N. High-resolution XPS analysis supports that MCN and HMCN-2 both displayed the analogous heptazine structure, which is consistent with FTIR results [40]. Notably, signals corresponding to the element K were observed with MCN (broad signal at 293.6 eV, potassium associated with the unreacted cyanamide anion), but not in HMCN-2, confirming the replacement of surface K ions by protons after treatment with HCl ( Fig. S3 c) [41]. On the basis of elemental analysis results (Table S1), obviously, the K ions were removed throughout the material and replaced by protons. The local structure of HMCN-2 has been characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and the sample exhibits identical diffraction peaks as the MCN sample (Fig. 1 c). Compared to MCN, protonated HMCN-2 exhibited sharper XRD diffraction peaks, which is due to the removal of the irregularly placed K ions in the framework by X-ray invisible protons, resulting in a clearer view on the framework order of the samples. In addition, the XRD patterns of the HMCN-2 sample prepared by the solvent evaporation method contains obvious diffraction peaks of potassium chloride (KCl) ( Fig. S4 ), further proving that the potassium in the samples is replaced by hydrogen. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations (Fig. 1 d) indicate that HMCN-2 consists of several stacked layers of nanosheets. Furthermore, the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1 e and f) of HMCN-2 revealed two different lattice fringes of 1.1 and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the in-plane repeat unit of (100) plane and interlayer distance of (002) plane of carbon nitride. Similarly, the treatment with acid did not obviously change the structure of the layered material. In line with the above results, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of MCN ( Fig. S5 a) showed a uniform distribution of C, N, and K throughout the whole selected area, whereas only the distribution of C, N was observed after acid treatment, again reflecting the replacement of K with the proton of the protonated samples ( Fig. S5 b). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Fig. 2 a) indicate that the optical band gap and thereby the semiconductor properties are maintained but gradually blue-shifted from 460 to 440 nm after protonation. The color of the sample changed correspondingly from yellow-green to off-white after acid treatment. The bandgaps from the Tauc plots are 2.85 eV for the HMCN-2 and 2.69 eV for MCN ( Fig. S6 ). The conduction band potentials of HMCN-2 and MCN are examined to be −0.74 V and −0.45 V (vs. RHE) by electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots ( Fig. S7 ). Together with the calculated band gap values, the band position of the obtained HMCN samples could be schemed in Fig. 2 b. It is clear that both conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions were shifted to more negative potentials, and there is especially an increased driving force for reductive dioxygen activation."
15,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over HMCN-x Catalysts.,"3.2 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over HMCN-x Catalysts. Direct esterification of benzyl alcohol (BA) under metal-free photocatalytic conditions as a green and sustainable process requires an efficient catalyst to activate both oxygen and organic molecule under mild and base-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 a, aerobic esterification of BA and methanol did not proceed in the absence of photocatalyst. Only a trace amount of methyl benzoate (MB) was observed over MCN and the vast majority of products were benzaldehyde and benzoic acid (Table S2, entry 2). The alkali-enhanced MCN (noted as KMCN) also shows no significant increase in the yield of MB (Table S2, entry 3). In comparison, carbon nitride treated with 0.1% acid (noted as HMCN-0.1) afforded improved yield of MB under identical conditions. These results reveal that pristine carbon nitride catalysts could not promote the aerobic esterification, whereas protonated HMCN could considerably prompt the formation of MB under mild photocatalytic conditions. The samples treated with different concentrations of HCl are used in the photocatalytic oxidative esterification reactions, and the yield of MB shows a tendency to increase first and then decrease (Fig. 3 a). All these studies evidence that the catalytic activity of HMCN can be adjusted via tuning the concentration of acidic site in the catalyst surface. Excellent BA conversion (>99%) and selectivity to MB (94%) are achieved over HMCN-2 under 420 nm light irradiation. HMCN-5 exhibited a pronounced decrease in catalyst activity possibly due to structural changes at a higher concentration of acid ( Fig. S8 ). Therefore, HMCN-2 was utilized as the best-in-class catalyst for the activation of oxygen and organic molecules in all subsequent experiments. When the reactions were conducted at 5 °C (Table S2, entry 11), the production of MB was relatively low, and the main product was benzaldehyde. No reaction took place in the absence of O2 or light (Table S2, entry 12 and 13). Removing the acidic site from the catalyst via KOH treatment, namely KHMCN-2 (XRD analysis is shown in Fig. S9 ), significantly lowered its catalytic activity, forming only a trace amount of MB within 24 h (Fig. 3 b). After that, the effects of acid variation was also investigated (Fig. 4 ). All reactions proceed smoothly over samples treated with HCl, HNO3, or H2SO4 to deliver the desired esterification product, whereas HMCN-2 demonstrated the best performance. Alternatively, samples treated with HCOOH, CH3COOH, or water (i.e weaker organic acids) display very low selectivity for MB (XRD analysis is shown in Fig. S10 ), similar to the untreated MCN sample, and benzoic acid is obtained as the main product. Compared with the well-known homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts, HMCN-2 showed the best performance for the production of esters from readily-available alcohols (Table S2, entries 14–19). In the process of the catalytic reaction, a significant amount of benzaldehyde and benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal were observed as intermediates over HMCN photocatalyst (Table S2, entries 4–11). As shown in Fig. 3 c and Table S3, the use of benzaldehyde as substrate leads to a full conversion to benzoic acid over MCN. In contrast, MB was formed in high yield with HMCN-2 as the catalyst (Fig. 3 c). Moreover, removing oxygen or performing the reaction in the dark leads from benzaldehyde to the production of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal in almost quantitative yield. Similarly, HMCN-2 can catalyze the reaction of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal with methanol to form methyl benzoate under oxygen and light (Table S4, entry 4). In this reaction, MCN could only promote the formation of benzoic acid (Table S4, entry 2). Finally, the reaction process was monitored with BA as the substrate (Fig. 3 d). The experimental results demonstrate that an obvious amount of benzaldehyde or benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal was formed at the early stage of the reaction. With the proceeding of the reaction, benzaldehyde and acetal could be further oxidized to MB, resulting in the production of MB in high yield and selectivity. All the above results indicate that with the assistance of the surface acidic site, the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde was activated over HMCN, which could finally transform to MB after subsequent oxidations. To gain mechanistic insight into the photocatalytic oxidation process, an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping experiment was performed, using DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) as the spin trap [42]. As shown in Fig. S11 , there are no obvious ESR signals for DMPO-•O2– adduct in the MCN system under visible light irradiation, but a gradual evolution of clear EPR signals for DMPO-•O2– adducts was observed by using HMCN-2. Furthermore, when the radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added into the reaction mixture under standard reaction conditions, the formation of MB over HMCN-2 largely decreased ( Fig. S12 ). Such a suppressed conversion suggests that the superoxide radical anion (·O2−) might be involved in the photocatalytic reaction. In light of these results, as depicted in Scheme 1 and S4, the oxidation of BA first afforded benzaldehyde over protonated carbon nitride photocatalyst (HMCN-2) under oxygen and illumination conditions. With the adsorption and activation of the carbonyl group by the surface acidic site of the photocatalyst, benzaldehyde could further react with methanol to form acetal or hemiacetal. As trace amounts of water are present in the reaction mixtures (as impurities, but also as a reaction product), an equilibrium among benzaldehyde, hemiacetal, and acetal is established, and the second oxidation probably proceeds via the hemiacetal. The active oxygen species, the superoxide radical anion, is in-situ generated on the surface of HMCN, presumably as a surface exciton radical pair. This localization ensures high efficiency and selectivity for the production of MB via a tandem catalytic process, the cross-dehydrogenative-coupling of the benzaldehyde with methanol [43]. In contrast with the pristine MCN or alkaline-treated KMCN, the desorption of benzaldehyde takes place, due to the lack of surface acidic sites, and oxidation of benzaldehyde in the solvent by free superoxide radicals leads to the formation of benzoic acid."
16,Surface acidic sites to activate the carbonyl group and promote the catalytic performance,"3.3 Surface acidic sites to activate the carbonyl group and promote the catalytic performance Further analysis of the structure of the HMCN catalyst was conducted to collect additional evidence on the surface acidic sites to activate the carbonyl group for the selective oxidation of BA. The similar texture of HMCN-2 and MCN excludes the obvious effects of the particle size and nanostructure of the materials on the final activity (Fig. 1 a and b). A higher specific surface area to effect (Table S5) the final catalytic activity can also be excluded here as the specific surface area of the protonated samples does not change much. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Fig. S13 ) analysis exhibited obvious peaks near 2150 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1 in the MCN sample which could be attributed to the cyano group and symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of metal-NC2 bonds [44,45]. The intensity of these peaks decreases with HMCN samples, suggesting the hydrolysis of the cyano group and the exchange of K+ with protons under acidic conditions. The CO2-TPD measurements demonstrate that MCN exhibits a strong CO2 desorption peak at around 75 °C (Fig. 5 a), whereas no significant CO2 desorption peak was observed with HMCN-2. The above results confirmed the presence of abundant basic sites on the surface of the MCN catalyst, while these surface basic sites are generally neutralized with acid treatment. Besides, HMCN-2 has the highest NH3 desorption peak (Fig. 5 b), centered at a temperature of approximately 150 °C, quantifying the high acid strength and density on this protonated material. Notably, the strength and density of acidic sites show a positive correlation relation with the selectivity of the overall transformation (Fig. 5 b), well illustrating the determinative role of surface acidic sites for the superb performance of the oxidative esterification process. Moreover, according to the O2-TPD spectrum as shown in Fig. 5 c, the O2 desorption peak of HMCN-2 shifts to a higher temperature in comparison with MCN, suggesting enhanced chemisorption and activation of oxygen after protonation. Along with protonation of the catalyst and C-NHx bonding, the surface charge, as measured by zeta potential of HMCN-2 dispersion in water (Fig. 5 d) was shifted after contact with HCl from −55 to −40 mV, again proving a positively charged, acidic surface. Furthermore, the propagation of acidic sites on the catalyst surface could effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction, further reducing the side reaction and improving the overall reaction selectivity. All the above-mentioned results suggest that the introduction of engineered surface acidic sites could both realize the activation of the substrate compounds and reduction of the undesirable side reactions, leading to remarkably enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for the oxidative esterification reactions. In addition, DFT calculations were carried out to further investigate the key role of surface acidic sites on the activation of the carbonyl group of intermediate benzaldehyde. It can be seen from Fig. 6 a and 6b that the benzaldehyde molecule can adsorb both on the MCN and HMCN via forming hydrogen bonds. On MCN, the adsorbed benzaldehyde is almost vertical to the catalyst plane and the calculated distance of the hydrogen bond is about 1.87 Å, generating binding energy of −0.87 eV. While on HMCN, the adsorbed benzaldehyde is parallel to the catalyst surface and two hydrogen bonds with distances of 2.01 and 1.72 Å are formed. This configuration is more stable than that on MCN due to a calculated higher binding energy of −1.08 eV for benzaldehyde. To obtain a deeper understanding of the interaction between benzaldehyde and the catalyst, charge density difference analysis is performed, and the diagrams are plotted in Fig. 6 c and d. It is clear to see that the electron transfer mainly takes place between the carbonyl and the edge hydrogen atoms on the surface N atoms of both catalysts. For HMCN, the electron transfer between the benzaldehyde molecule and the catalyst is more significant, compared to that for MCN, due to more hydrogen bonds. The electrons of oxygen are mainly localized at the side that interacts with the N-H species and enhancement of the electron-withdrawing ability of carbonyl carbon relative to the case on MCN. Based on this, the hydrogen bound to the carbonyl carbon loses more electron in comparison to the hydrogen in the MCN case (Table S6). Moreover, we carried out the density of state analysis to verify the electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon. As shown in Fig. 6 e, only a single occupied state exists near the Fermi level (E F) for the C1 in the isolated benzaldehyde. After adsorption onto the MCN surface, the p states of C1 move towards the lower energy region relative to the E F, causing the E F to locate in the energy gap between the highest occupied state and the lowest unoccupied state. More interestingly, when the benzaldehyde forms two hydrogen bonds with HMCN, the p states further shift to a deeper energy region, causing the E F quite close to the lowest unoccupied state, suggesting that the lowest unoccupied p states of C1 are facile to interact with electron-rich species. This also suggests that benzaldehyde adsorbed on HMCN is more likely to be attacked by nucleophiles relative to the case on MCN. This trend well agrees with our experimental observation that benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal was readily formed over HMCN, which is probably initiated via a nucleophilic attack of methanol on the activated carbonyl group of benzaldehyde As water is generated during the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation process, the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface may have a certain effect on the catalytic process. The untreated MCN exhibits good hydrophilicity, and the hydrophilicity of alkali-treated KMCN-2 is further improved. However, the hydrophobicity of HMCN-2 ( Fig. S14 ) is most improved in comparison with MCN and KMCN-2, which then can take up the water generated during the oxidative esterification from the rection site, thereby improving the catalytic efficiency."
17,"Photocatalytic cross-esterification of different benzylic alcohols with methanol, scaling-up reaction, and reusability of catalyst","3.4 Photocatalytic cross-esterification of different benzylic alcohols with methanol, scaling-up reaction, and reusability of catalyst The HMCN-2 photocatalyst can be used to drive a series of photocatalytic oxidative esterification of alcohols under metal-free conditions (Table 1 ). In general, the reaction exhibits great photocatalytic performance with electron-rich benzylic alcohols, forming the corresponding esters in excellent yield. With electron-donating methyl, methoxy, and ethyl group on the para-positions, the benzyl alcohol reacted smoothly to give the corresponding ester derivatives with high selectivity (Table 1, entries 1–4). The reaction scope could also be extended to benzylic alcohols substituted with electron-withdrawing Cl and Br groups, which gives the desired esters in high conversion and selectivity (Table 1, entries 5–6). Additionally, heterocyclic substituted alcohol such as thiophene-2-methanol can also be used as a suitable substrate in the photocatalytic oxidative esterification reaction, and the heterocyclic carboxylic acid ester could be afforded in complete conversion and 88% selectivity (Table 1, entry 7). The advantages of HMCN over noble-metal-based catalysts with respect to being more resistant against poisoning by N or S atoms are demonstrated. It is worth noting that when 1,4-benzenedimethanol is used as the substrate, dimethyl terephthalate is obtained in lower yield under the standard experimental conditions (Table 1, entry 8). The conversion and selectivity of dimethyl terephthalate can however be significantly improved with the extension of reaction time to 72 h (Table 1, entry 9). All these results indicate the high chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance of HMCN for metal-free aerobic esterification of alcohols using molecular oxygen. The photocatalytic oxidative esterification process employing the HMCN-2 photocatalyst shows favorable potential for scaling-up in terms of the starting concentration of the reactants, the reaction volume, and the stability, as representatively demonstrated by the photocatalytic synthesis of MB. As shown in Fig. S15 a and S15b, a gram-grade reaction was conducted at the identical conditions in a batch and continuous-flow reactor system. The experiments demonstrated that while a 56% yield of MB could be obtained after 48 h under batch photochemical reaction conditions, the reaction outcome could be greatly improved to 87% yield within the continuous-flow protocol. We also examined the stability and reusability of the HMCN-2 catalyst by recovering the used catalyst for further characterizations and catalytic reactions. The HMCN-2 catalyst could be reused at least five times ( Fig. S16 ) with only a slight attenuation of activity, which could mainly be attributed to the reduction of acid sites on the catalyst surface ( Fig. S17 ). The crystal structure of the sample does not change much after 5 cycles, as demonstrated by the XRD characterization results ( Fig. S18 ). Moreover, a protonation process, in which the used HMCN-2 catalyst was washed with 2 M HCl solution, was carried out to ensure its activity, again suggesting the protonation process is the key step in the whole aerobic esterification reaction of BA over the HMCN heterogeneous catalyst (Fig. 7 ). All the above results unambiguously confirmed the necessity of acidic sites on the catalyst surface for the performance of the photocatalytic oxidative esterification process."
18,Summary,"A metal-free, visible light-responsive HMCN photocatalyst with surface acidic sites is presented to drive a photocatalytic aerobic oxidative esterification reaction under additive-free, mild conditions. The surface acidification promotes the adsorption and activation of the carbonyl group of the intermediate aldehyde, thus giving rise to high efficiency and selectivity for the direct photoredox catalytic oxidation of alcohols to esters. It is anticipated that the favorable performance and high stability also shown in a scaled-up flow reactor makes the simple, metal-free, cost-effective, and sustainable HMCN a promising candidate in streamlining and diversifying industrial applications of photochemistry."
