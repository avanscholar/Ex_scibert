0,Introduction,"Being a sustainable energy source, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels, as it is a clean and environmental friendly fuel, which produces water instead of greenhouse gases after combustion. Hydrogen has a high energy yield of 122 KJ/g which is 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuel. Hydrogen can be generated mainly from fossil fuels, biomass and water by chemical or biological process [1,2]. Biologically, hydrogen can be produced by the photosynthetic and fermentative routes which are more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive compared to thermo-chemical and electro-chemical processes [3]. In comparison to photosynthetic microorganisms, fermentative hydrogen-producing microorganisms are advantageous in that hydrogen can be evolved in a reactor continuously without light [4]. Among the fermentative hydrogen producers, the organisms of genus Clostridium such as Clostridium butyricum [5,6], Clostridium acetobutylicum [7] Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum [8], Clostridium pasteurianum [9,10] are often used to produce hydrogen [11]. Clostridium sp. the spore forming anaerobic bacteria, is one of those organisms capable of converting sucrose to hydrogen with the yield ranged between 2.0 and 4.8 mol of hydrogen/mol sucrose [5,6,10] which is higher than that of the other fermentative bacteria such as Enterobacter sp. (1 mol hydrogen/mol hexose) [3]. When pure culture is used for hydrogen fermentation, the reactors are mostly started up and operated under sterile condition which requires high cost for hydrogen production in industrial scale. To overcome this problem, the addition of pure culture to the reactor under non-sterile condition has drawn our attention. During hydrogen production under non-sterile condition, the relationship of competitive and cooperative of microbial populations could be found. For the competitive relationship, some isolates augmented into the reactors cannot become dominant due to their inability to grow in the communities depending on the environmental condition [12]. In contrast, for the cooperative relationship, the mixed indigenous microorganisms in the substrate could consume volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced during hydrogen production, which in turn facilitate hydrogen production of bioaugmented producer by reducing the product inhibitory effect [12]. According to these previous reports, the microbial community in the hydrogen production system under non-sterile condition should be investigated for the dominate species responsible for hydrogen production. Therefore, in this study the microbial community in the hydrogen fermentation system after adding C. butyricum under non-sterile condition was explored in order to verify the relationship between the augmented microorganism and normal flora in the substrate i.e. sugarcane juice. Sugarcane is one of the important industrial crops in Thailand. It can be cultivated in all parts of Thailand, except in the Southern of Thailand, with the cultivation area of more than 960,000 ha. Approximately 48 million tons of sugarcane is produced per year [13]. Sugarcane juice is mainly used to produce sugar. However, from the report of Office of the Cane and Sugar Board (Thailand), sugar production from sugarcane every year is greater than sugar consumption [13]. Therefore, this research was designed to investigate an alternative way to value-added sugarcane by producing a clean and renewable energy i.e. hydrogen. The main sugar found in sugarcane juice is sucrose, which can be used as substrate for hydrogen production by various microorganisms such as C. pasteurianum [10] and C. butyricum CGS5 [6] with yields of 4.80 and 2.78 mol-H2/mol-sucrose, respectively. Therefore, sugarcane juice has a potential to be used as substrate for hydrogen production. In the present study, sugarcane juice was used as a substrate to produce hydrogen continuously by C. butyricum in the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The relationship of the augmented microorganism i.e. C. butyricum and normal flora in the fermentation system under non-sterile condition were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Fermentative medium preparation,"2.1 Fermentative medium preparation Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum Linn.) used in this study was harvested from sugarcane field, Lopburi Province, Thailand. Sugarcane juice was prepared by crushing the sugarcane stalk using squeezer and filtrating through a thin layer cloth and then boiled to concentrate in order to obtain the sugarcane syrup. The sugarcane syrup has a final concentration of 2000 g/L (2245 g-COD sucrose/L) of total sugar and was kept at −20 °C until the usage. Frozen sugarcane syrup was thawed by placing at room temperature prior to use as substrate for hydrogen production. For medium preparation, the sugarcane syrup was diluted with distilled water to a concentration of 25 g-COD sucrose/L and supplemented with sufficient inorganic nutrients for bacterial growth including (mg/L); NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2.6H2O 15, FeSO4.7H2O 25, CuSO4.5H2O 5, CoCl2.5H2O 0.125, NaHCO3 6720 [14]."
3,Seed inoculum preparation,"2.2 Seed inoculum preparation C. butyricum TISTR 1032 was obtained from Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Thailand. This microorganism is able to produce hydrogen as previously been reported by Pattra et al. [15]. It was grown in cooked meat medium (CMM) (Himedia, India) at 37 °C under the anaerobic condition for 10 h and kept at 4 °C as a stock culture. Prior to cultivation, C. butyricum was activated by transferring 1 mL of the stock culture at a cell concentration of 107 cells/mL into 10 mL of fresh Tryptone Sucrose Yeast Extract (TSY) medium, incubated at 37 °C for 10 h at 150 rpm using an orbital shaker under the anaerobic condition. The culture was further enriched by inoculating 10% v/v, cell concentration of 106 cells/mL, of the culture into 60 mL fresh TSY medium and incubated at the given conditions before using as inoculum [16]. Each liter of TSY containing 5.0 g of tryptone; 3.0 g of sucrose; 5.0 g of yeast extract; 1.0 g of K2HPO4 [17]."
4,CSTR operation and monitoring,"2.3 CSTR operation and monitoring A 1-L CSTR with a working volume of 900 mL was used to produce hydrogen from sugarcane juice. The schematic diagram of the bioreactor was depicted in Fig. 1 . The reactor was fed with 810 mL of fermentative medium and 90 mL of C. butyricum (10% (v/v), final cell density of 106 cell/mL) as seed inoculum under anaerobic condition and operated at a controlled temperature of 37 °C with a constant stirring at 150 rpm using impeller. A pH of fermented broth was maintained at 6 using a pH controller and 1N NaOH. The oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) was measured using ORP meter (MV7615, B&C Electronic, Italy) to ensure the anaerobic condition. After 12 h of reactor operation, the fermentative medium was continuously fed from medium tank to the feed-in port at the bottom of the reactor using peristaltic pump. The effluent overflowed from the reactor at the feed-out port. Samples were taken at the sampling port. The starting hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 36 h and the HRT was further shortened to 24, 12, 6 and 4 after a steady state was reached. Steady-state conditions reached when the product concentration including hydrogen gas content, biogas volume and metabolite concentration (i.e. VFAs and ethanol) were stable (less than 10% variation) for 5–7 days. During reactor operation, the amount of biogas produced was recorded daily using a wet-gas meter (Ritter Inc, Germany, Type: TG 1/5). The biogas contents were analyzed by using Gas Chromatography (GC). The measured hydrogen volume was adjusted to the volume at standard temperature (0 °C) and pressure (760 mmHg, STP). The effluent was sampled every day to determine the sucrose residues and the concentrations of biomass, VFAs and ethanol produced. The optimum HRT was justified by the greatest hydrogen production rate and yield."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The composition of biogas was measured by using a GC (China 8700T, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, Water crop, USA). Oven, injector and detector temperatures were 40, 40 and 40 °C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The concentrations of VFAs and ethanol were determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a glass column packed with FON (Shimadzu, Japan). The oven, injector and detector temperatures were 145, 175 and 175 °C, respectively, and nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. Volatile suspended solids (VSS) represented as the biomass concentration and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were measured according to Standard Methods [18]. The sugar concentration in fermentative medium was determined according to the phenol–sulfuric acid method using sucrose as a standard [19]. Hydrogen yield (HY) (mol H2/mol hexose) and hydrogen production rate (HPR) (mmol H2/L/h) were calculated by using equations (1) and (2), respectively. (1) HY = volume hydrogen produced per day ( L ) / 22.4 ( L / mol ) hexose consumed per day ( g ) / 180 ( g / mol ) (2) HPR = [ volume hydrogen produced ( L / d ) / 22.4 ( L / mol ) Working volume of reactor ( L ) ]"
6,DNA isolation and PCR-DGGE analysis,"2.5 DNA isolation and PCR-DGGE analysis Total genomic DNA of samples (bacterial from the CSTR) was collected at steady state of each HRT, extracted and purified by using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer set of EUB968F (5′-AACGCGAAGAACCTTAC-3′) plus GC-clamp (5′-CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCG GGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3′) and UNIV1392R (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTG TRC-3′) were used for amplifying the target universal-consensus of 16S rDNA fragment [20]. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) mixtures (50 μL) contained 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mM of primers, 0.2 μM of MgCl2, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA), and the PCR buffer supplied with the enzyme. The amplification consisted of a DNA denaturing step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 54 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The cycling included a final extension step at 72 °C for 3 min to ensure full extension of the product. All PCR operations were performed with an automatic thermal cycler iCyclerTM (BioRad, U.S.A.). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis at 100 V for 30 min through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. The amplified products were visualized under UV light after being stained with ethidium bromide. Before PCR-amplifying the extracted rDNA fragments, the sequence variations were assessed by DGGE. The PCR-DGGE profile of the PCR-amplified DNA was obtained following the method of Muyzer et al. [21] using a DCodeTM Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, U.S.A.). The 6% (w/v) acrylamide solution was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 30 to 65%. Electrophoresis was conducted in a 1X TAE (Tris/acetic acid/EDTA) buffer solution at 180 V and 60 °C for 5 h. The gels were stained for 10 min with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV radiation. The number of operational taxonomic units in each sample was defined as the number of PCR-DGGE bands. Quantitative PCR was not conducted, however, as the same loading quantity of PCR product for each lane was applied, different densities of each band in different lanes revealed by DGGE should, therefore, indicate the relative difference of predominant microbial community."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of HRT on hydrogen production and microbial community in the CSTR,"3.1 Effect of HRT on hydrogen production and microbial community in the CSTR The effect of HRT on continuous hydrogen production from sugarcane juice under non-sterile condition in the CSTR augmented with C. butyricum was investigated. The time courses profile of continuous biogas and hydrogen production in the CSTR are shown in Fig. 2 . The summarized operating parameters at steady state for each HRT are shown in Table 1 . Results indicated that variation of HRT led to the variation in operating parameters such as total sugar consumption, biogas production, hydrogen content, HPR and HY (Fig. 2). The biogas produced in this study consisted of mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen without the detection of methane. The result implied that a slightly acidic condition at pH 6.0, which was maintained by controlling pH of the fermented broth, was favorable for hydrogen production. At the long HRT of 36–12 h, the hydrogen production was observed to be stable with the HY and HPR of 0.05–0.10 mol H2/mol hexose and 0.25–0.49 mmol H2/L/h, respectively. The HY and HPR values increased when the HRT was shortened from 12 h to 6 and 4 h, respectively. The maximum HY and HPR of 1.00 mol H2/mol hexose and 3.38 mmol H2/L/h, respectively, were obtained at the HRT of 4 h which indicated that the HRT of 4 h was suitable for hydrogen production from sugarcane juice in the CSTR augmented with C. butyricum. The HY of 1.00 mol H2/mol hexose is in the average range of previous reports (Table 2 ). Our findings were similar to Wu et al. [22] who reported that HPR from glucose by anaerobic sludge increased from 0.19 to 0.6 L H2/L/h when the HRT was shortened from 12 to 6 h. Lin et al. [23] reported that a decrease in HRT led to an increase in organic loading rate and long HRT favored the degradation of substrate. In our study, as the sugar concentration in sugarcane juice was fixed at 25 g-COD/L, a decrease in HRT represented an increase in substrate loading rate. Therefore, if H2-producing bacterial population can be stably maintained in the bioreactor against an increase in hydraulic dilution arising from a decrease in HRT, the HPR would increase with decreasing HRT. Approximately 24.5 g-COD/L of sugar consumed at steady state was observed at the HRT of 36–16 h. The total sugar consumed decreased to 18.15 and 16.37 g-COD/L when the HRTs were shortened to 6 and 4 h, respectively. Hydrogen content was considered as HRT-dependent parameter. At the start up, the hydrogen content increased continuously and peaked at 45% after 3 d of reactor operation then decreased continuously to be stable at 6.3% at 36-h HRT. The further decrease in HRT to 24 h resulted in an increase in hydrogen content of 24.2%. At HRT in the range of 12–4 h, the hydrogen content in the biogas produced was observed to be relatively low at approximately 17% (Fig. 2, Table 1). The volume of produced biogas peaked at the HRT of 4 with the relatively low H2 content of 19.1%. The microbial determination in a DGGE analysis for the biomass sample at steady state at each HRT indicated that microbial population was HRT-dependent with C. butyricum, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Lactobacillus harbinensis (Fig. 3 ) are dominant species. Clostridia species have been reported to be responsible for hydrogen production via butyrate type fermentation [24–26]. Hydrogen fermentation by Clostridia species is accompanied with VFAs and/or solvent production [24]. Klebsiella sp. is known as the solvent production strains. They can utilize various kind of substrates and produce alcohol such as 2,3 butanediol, isopropanol and ethanol and hydrogen and carbon dioxide as soluble and gases metabolites [22,27]. Lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus sp. had been reported to decrease hydrogen content in biogas production due to its inhibitory effect caused by the excreted bacteriocins which have an adverse effect on hydrogen-producing bacteria [28]."
9,Metabolites and biomass production,"3.2 Metabolites and biomass production The performance of the CSTR at different HRT on hydrogen production could be well described by the metabolite products. The metabolite concentration and fraction data under steady-state condition in continuous hydrogen fermentation at each HRT was summarized in Table 2. The daily variation of biomass and liquid products at different HRT were shown in Fig. 3. VFAs including acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu) and lactic acid (HLa) and ethanol (EtOH) were the main metabolites detected in the effluent. HBu production is related to hydrogen production when mixed-cultures were used as inoculum [29] while HAc, HBu and EtOH production are related to hydrogen production when C. butyricum was used [30]. Ethanol could be detected at the concentration ranged from 2059–4096 mg-COD/L indicated that ethanol was simultaneously produced at the same time of hydrogen production. HBu was the main metabolite from hydrogen production at the start up with the highest concentration of approximately 9500 mg-COD/L at 3 days of reactor operation in which at the same time, hydrogen content peaked at 45%. The hydrogen content seemed to be directly related with the type of dominant species. In this study, L. harbinensis was dominant at every HRT (Fig. 3, Table 2). This could be responsible for a reduction of hydrogen production efficiency resulting in a low hydrogen content at steady state at every HRT (lesser than 25%) as compared to the published report in which the hydrogen content was higher than 40% [12,23,31]. K. pneumoniae was dominant microorganism at the HRT of 36 h and 4, while C. butyricum could be detected at every HRT except at a 36-h HRT (Fig. 3). When there was only the presence of K. pneumoniae, low hydrogen content was observed at the HRT of 36 h (Fig. 2, Table 1). At the HRT of 24 h, C. butyricum and K. pneumoniae were dominant and the hydrogen content was approximately 3.8 times greater than that of 36-h HRT (Fig. 2, Table 1). At the HRT of 12 and 6 h, C. butyricum was dominant without the detection of K. pneumoniae, the hydrogen content was found to decrease slightly (1.5 times) as compared to the 24-h HRT (Table 1). When K. pneumoniae reappeared as a dominant species together with C. butyricum at the HRT of 4 h, a slightly increase in hydrogen content of 1.2 times in comparison to that at the HRT of 12 and 6 could be observed (Fig. 2, Table 1). According to these results, the augmented C. butyricum could compete with contaminated microorganisms during non-sterile operation at low HRT with the support of K. pneumoniae. Report by Gottschalk [32] indicated that Klebsiella sp is active in hydrogen production. In addition, it should be noted that there are some unknown species present in the DGGE analysis results (Fig. 3). These unknown species might be dark fermentative bacteria which can grow well at mesothermal condition such as the other Clostridia sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. [33]. The concentration of HPr at steady state increased from 1741 to 2914 mg-COD/L when the HRT was shortened from 36 h to 12 h, but a drastically decrease in HPr concentration to 318 mg-COD/L was observed when the HRT was decreased to 4 h (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The decrease in HPr production was correlated to the increase in HY in which the maximum HY and minimum HPr could be obtained at the HRT of 4 h (Table 1). Propionate production involves consumption of both organic substrate and hydrogen which is produced according to the equation (3): (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O A reduction in retention time could prevent the combination of organic matter and hydrogen leading to a reduction in HPr production in anaerobic hydrogen production system [34,35]. Hussy et al. [35] reported that immediate reduction of HPr production was observed in continuous hydrogen fermentation from wheat starch when HRT was shortened to 12 h. Lin and Chang [34] also reported that the HPr level decreased significantly when the HRT was shortened to 6 h. A greater concentration of HLa than normally found in biohydrogen production was detected at every HRT operation (Fig. 4, Table 1). This might be a result from the lactic acid producing bacteria, L. harbinensis, existed in the hydrogen fermentation system (Fig. 3). The production of biomass at steady state obviously increased from 1074 to 2019 mg VSS/L with the decrease in HRT from 36 to 12 h (Fig. 4 and Table 1). This might be due to the fact that a shorter HRT attributed to a higher organic loading rate could provide a greater amount of substrate for cell growth. Further decrease of HRT to 6 and 4 h resulted in a decrease in biomass concentration to 1574 and 1301 mg VSS/L, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 1). This implied that the biomass growth in the CSTR operated at this HRT apparently cannot compete with the dilution effect due to the faster volumetric feeding rate, resulting in the washout of cells [23]. The hydrogen production at the HRT of shorter than 4 h was not operated in order to maintain the biomass concentration in the system and to avoid the worst washout condition. The average ORP data range was −300 to −490 mV ensured that the CSTR system was maintained under the anaerobic condition."
10,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the performance analysis of hydrogen production and population analysis of bacterial community from sugarcane juice in a non-sterile CSTR augmented with C. butyricum. The maximum HPR and HY of 3.38 mmol H2/L/h and 1.0 mol H2/mol hexose consumed, respectively, were achieved at HRT 4 h. At HRT 36 h, other species related to L. harbinensis and K. pneumoniae were present as a major group in the reactor. When HRT was decreased to 12, 6 and 4 h, C. butyricum was present with a competition between L. harbinensis and K. pneumoniae. Results indicated that augmented C. butyricum could compete with contaminated microorganisms during non-sterile operation at low HRT (12–4 h) with the support of normal flora (K. pneumoniae)."
