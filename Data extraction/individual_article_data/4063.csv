0,Introduction,"Curdlan is an extracellular microbial polysaccharide with a linear β-1,3-D-glucan structure, which can be isolated from Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes (Cai et al., 2020; Maeda, Saito, Masada, Misaki, & Harada, 1967). Notably, curdlan can form two kinds of gel depending on the heating temperature from a cold aqueous suspension (Cai et al., 2020). A low-heat reversible gel is formed when the curdlan dispersion is heated to 55°C–60 °C and then cooled below 40 °C, whereas a highly thermally irreversible gel is obtained when the dispersion is heated to 80 °C or above (Hirashima, Takaya, & Nishinari, 1997). Curdlan assumes a triple-helical structure in which one β-1,3-glucan chain forms inter-strand hydrogen bonds with two other strands perpendicular to the axis of the triple helix (Qin et al., 2017; Yu, Zhou, & Yang, 2019). The primary structure of curdlan can be changed to a rigid coil-like conformation in aqueous NaOH and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (Xiao et al., 2017). While the strong peaks obtained by circular dichroism indicate curdlan remains helical structures in mild alkaline solutions (Yu et al., 2019). This gelation property is attributed to helical structure transformation at different temperatures from a mixture of single helices and loose intertwined triple helices, connected by hydrogen bonds at room temperature, to more condensed triple helices at higher temperatures (Ruoran & Kevin, 2014). However, other researchers raised different options. Bundles of curdlan triple-stranded helixes were driven to separate from each other at 50 °C, then would dissociate into partially opened triple-helical chains and single-helical chains at 60 and 70 °C, and finally large amounts of the dissociated single-helical chain were presented at 80 and 90 °C (Li, Wang, Miao, Zhang, & Zheng, 2019; Verma et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2017). The changes of crystallinity of curdlan measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the molecular structure changes of the curdlan gels at different temperatures (Chen & Liang, 2017; Wu et al., 2012). The gelation mechanism of curdlan and the fine network structures along with conformation are still not well understood. Texture parameters are highly important characteristics for the production and development of food gels (Cai et al., 2020; Wudan et al., 2019), and there is considerable interest focused on the role of the addition of sugars on the formation of gels. Sugars have been approved to promote the gelation of the thermally reversible gels like κ-carrageenan gels, and the thermally irreversible gels such as konjac (Akesowan, 2015; Khemakhem, Attia, & Ayadi, 2019; Yang, Yang, & Yang, 2018). Sucrose addition promoted the gelation of κ-carrageenan by facilitating the formation of denser and thicker fibril helical junctions, which was clarified as the coil-helix transition and subsequent aggregation of double helices (Stenner, Matubayasi, & Shimizu, 2016; Yang et al., 2018). Differential scanning calorimetry also showed the increase of melting temperature is linearly related to the increase of sugars, which indicated the direct interaction between OH-groups of sugar and κ-carrageenan (Hirashima et al., 1997). The synergistic effect of sucrose and erythritol on the konjac hydrogel could be attributed to adhere or to retain water, which would favor the interaction between the konjac molecules (Akesowan, 2015). The addition of sucrose may stabilize curdlan gel by enhancing the overall hydrogen bonding structure, thus preventing water separation (Verma et al., 2020); however, the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes worldwide has been partially attributed to the overconsumption of added sugars, such as sucrose (Stenner et al., 2016). Polyols are a reduced form of sugars that have an attached alcohol group in substitution to the aldehyde, which could also help to achieve enhanced gel characteristics (Karaca, Erdem, & Ak, 2018; Madadlou, Saint-Jalmes, Guyomarc'h, Floury, & Dupont, 2019). Compared with sugars, polyols are poorly absorbed and provide fewer calories and lower glycemic responses (Edwards, Rossi, Corpe, Butterworth, & Ellis, 2016) and thus are especially beneficial for use as alternatives in a diabetic and low-calorie food. Few studies have investigated the effect of polyols on the formation of curdlan gel. It naturally finds the polyol erythritol in some fruits, mushrooms, and fermented foods, such as wine, sherry, and soy sauce (Munro et al., 1998). The glycemic index and caloric value of erythritol are 0 and 0.2 kcal/g, respectively, compared with 100 and 3.9 kcal/g, respectively, for sucrose. Erythritol is excreted intact into urine and does not enter the blood circulation. In addition, erythritol is rapidly and well absorbed (60%–90%) in the small intestine, thus helping to avoid the laxative side effects associated with excessive consumption of other polyols (Madadlou et al., 2019; Moriano & Alamprese, 2017). Research has indicated that erythritol can act as an antioxidant to scavenge the hydroxyl radicals in vivo (Hartog et al., 2010; Wölnerhanssen, Meyer-Gerspach, Beglinger, & Islam, 2020). Furthermore, erythritol is reported to be effective for controlling postprandial hyperglycemia in the alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus mouse model and likely mediates this effect by acting as a competitive inhibitor of α-glucosidase (Wen et al., 2018). Both curdlan and erythritol could be obtained by fermentation without any toxicities and side effects. Currently, there are no published reports concerning the synergistic effect of erythritol on the gelation mechanism of curdlan gel. Our study aims to investigate the effects of erythritol on the textural properties of curdlan gel with texture profile analysis (TPA). Furthermore, we used the freeze-thawing test, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and molecular docking to investigate the addition of erythritol on the formation of curdlan gel. This study provides beneficial information to explain possible mechanisms for enhanced gelation behavior induced by erythritol addition, which is helpful for the production and development of low calorie functional food gels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Curdlan powder was a gift from Guoli Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Jinan, Shandong, China). Erythritol was obtained from Baolingbao Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Dezhou, Shandong, China). Potassium bromide (FTIR grade) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) was purified using a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Unless otherwise noted, the chemicals and reagents used in this experiment were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"2.2 Preparation of curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels The curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels were prepared by described methods (Jiang et al., 2020) with some modifications. The curdlan gel could not form at a very low concentration. It showed the strength of curdlan gel will increase dramatically at the concentration of 3% (Maeda et al., 1967). So the total curdlan powder content was set at 3% (w/w). Curdlan powder (3 g) was slowly added to a series of glass beakers each containing 100 mL deionized water at room temperature. Erythritol (0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9%, w/w) was then separately added to individual beakers, which were stirred with an IKA mechanical mixer (RW 20 digital, IKA Works, Inc., Guangzhou, China) at 1500 rpm for 5 min to obtain a suspension, stirring was maintained in a water bath at 100 °C for 30 min. Finally, the mixed solutions were incubated at 25 °C to form gels and then kept at this temperature for 2 h before testing."
4,Texture profile analysis,"2.3 Texture profile analysis Textural parameters of curdlan gel containing different concentrations of erythritol were determined by a Texture Analyzer (TAXTplus/30, Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK), as previously described (Yuan, Xu, Cui, & Wang, 2019) with slight modifications. Samples were penetrated with a cylinder probe (5 mm diameter, model P/0.5). The samples were tested at pretest speed 2.0 mm/s, test speed 2.0 mm/s, posttest speed 2.0 mm/s, compression distance 1.5 mm, trigger force 5.0 g, and compression depth of 50%. Five parameters, i.e., hardness, springiness, gumminess, cohesiveness, and chewiness, were recorded for texture measurements."
5,Freeze-thawing stability analysis,"2.4 Freeze-thawing stability analysis Freeze-thawing stability was determined by the percentage of syneresis according to the previous method (Yuan et al., 2019) with some modifications. All curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels were frozen at −18 °C for 24 h and then thawed at 25 °C for 6 h. After thawing, samples were centrifuged at 1700 g for 15 min, and the separated water removed and weighed. Divided the weight of the water separated by the total weight of the gel before centrifugation, the percentage of syneresis was obtained."
6,FTIR spectra measurements,"2.5 FTIR spectra measurements Curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels were freeze-dried (LGJ-10, Beijing Songyuan Huaxin Ltd., China) and were ground to a powder and screened by a 100 mesh sieve. The FTIR spectra were operated, as previously reported (Wang et al., 2019). FTIR spectra of all samples were obtained using an IRAffinity-1S spectrometer equipped with a single-reflection attenuated total reflectance accessory (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The sample (1 mg) was ground with 100 mg potassium bromide powder and then scanned between 400 and 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1."
7,XRD analysis,"2.6 XRD analysis The freeze-dried gel powder was characterized by a Bruker D8-Advance XRD instrument (Bruker AXS Inc., Germany), according to the previous method (Chen et al., 2017) with some modifications. The parameters were assessed in reflection mode at 40 kV, 40 mA with graphite-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. Measurements were taken between 4 and 80° (2θ) with a step size of 0.03°."
8,SEM of curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"2.7 SEM of curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels The microstructures of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels were observed using SEM, as previously described (Yuan et al., 2019). The prepared gels were rapidly quenched with liquid nitrogen, cut into cubes of 5 mm, placed in an ultralow-temperature refrigerator at −80 °C for 2 h, and then freeze-dried to obtain the SEM samples. Prior to observation, the gels were coated with gold under argon atmosphere using a gold sputter module in a high vacuum evaporator. Images with magnification of 400 × and 2500 × were recorded."
9,Molecular docking of curdlan and erythritol,"2.8 Molecular docking of curdlan and erythritol Due to the simple non-branching linear polysaccharide consisting of glucose residues linked by β-1,3-D-glycosidic bonds (Xiao et al., 2017), the single and triple helical forms of a β-1,3-D-glucan (eleven glucose residues) were defined as the receptors, which were kindly offered by Dr. Qin (Qin et al., 2017). Molecular docking was performed with BIOVIA Discovery Studio V16 software to get the CDOCKER scores. The structure of erythritol was prepared with the Small Molecules Module before docking. The pose cluster radius was 0.5 Å. Models were analyzed by the CDOCKER energy and CDOCKER interaction energy to select the best conformation."
10,Statistical analysis,2.9 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results were presented as the mean and standard deviation. Statistical comparisons were carried out using a least significant difference test of variance (ANOVA) to identify where differences occurred. A significant difference was defined by a value of p < 0.01. The analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.2) and GraphPad Prism (version 5.01).
11,Results and discussion,
12,Effects of erythritol on the texture of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"3.1 Effects of erythritol on the texture of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels TPA is considered as an effective description of the characteristics of polysaccharide hydrocolloids (Yuan et al., 2019). To investigate the influence of erythritol on the curdlan gel texture, five mechanical parameters of TPA, i.e., hardness, springiness, gumminess, cohesiveness, and chewiness, were selected as study parameters according to the properties of gel system. Hardness refers to the force required for compressing material between the teeth or between the tongue and palate (Yuan et al., 2019), which is defined as the force required to attain a given deformation or as the maximum peak force (Cevher, Taha, Orlu, & Araman, 2008). The effect of erythritol on the hardness of curdlan gel is shown in Fig. 1 a. The hardness of curdlan gel gradually increased as the erythritol concentration increased from 0% to 5% (w/w). After 5% (w/w) erythritol, gel hardness exhibited a downward trend. Two driving forces in the formation of gels have been reported: (i) the exclusion of sugars and polyols from gel surfaces in the sol state and (ii) the binding of sugars and polyols in the gel (Stenner et al., 2016). At low concentrations (0%–5%, w/w), the exclusion of erythritol reduced the proportion of water present and weakened curdlan–water interactions to induce the curdlan strands to gather together and thereby form a denser network structure with a higher gel strength. However, excessive erythritol may cause difficulty in clustering of curdlan strands and hinder the formation of the curdlan network; thus, gel hardness dropped with further increases in erythritol concentration (Stenner et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2019). Springiness is the ability of food to be stretched and then to return to the original length. The addition of erythritol gradually increased the springiness of curdlan gel, as shown in Fig. 1b. The lowest springiness value was 0.964 without the addition of erythritol, whereas the highest springiness value was 0.977 at an erythritol concentration of 5% (w/w). Cohesiveness is defined as the degree of compression between the teeth before the food breaks. The impact of erythritol on the cohesiveness of the curdlan gels is shown in Fig. 1c. Cohesiveness displayed an upward trend as erythritol concentrations increased from 0% to 5% (w/w). The erythritol concentration resulted in a cohesiveness value of 0.47, which was significantly higher than that of other concentrations (p < 0.01). Gel cohesiveness can be affected by the skeleton structure of curdlan gel (Yuan et al., 2019). The addition of erythritol strengthened the curdlan strands that were gathered together, resulting in the increased cohesiveness. Similar to hardness, excessive erythritol could hinder the formation of the curdlan network, and thus the cohesiveness decreased with the further increases of erythritol concentration. Gumminess and chewiness are secondary TPA parameters that are obtained by multiplying hardness by cohesiveness and gumminess by springiness, respectively. The gumminess increased for erythritol concentrations of 0%–5% (w/w) and then decreased from 5% to 9% (w/w) (Fig. 1d). A similar phenomenon was observed with the chewiness values following the addition of erythritol to (Fig. 1e). The decreased values of gumminess and chewiness after 5% (w/w) could also be due to excessive erythritol, hindering the gathering of the curdlan strands and blocking the extension of the network wall."
13,Freeze-thawing stability of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"3.2 Freeze-thawing stability of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels Curdlan can also form a flexible gel that has strong biological activity and stability at both high and low (freezing) temperatures (Verma et al., 2020). During cold storage, the quality of frozen foods is closely related to thermal fluctuation and water phase change, which can be assessed by the freeze-thawing stability test. There is no standard test for freeze-thawing stability, and the method employed in this study was determined by the concentration of curdlan and erythritol, freezing temperature, and centrifugal force used (Yuan, Du, Zhang, Jin, & Liu, 2016). The freeze-thawing stabilities of curdlan gel with or without erythritol additions were evaluated by determining the percentage of residual curdlan gel following freezing-thawing and centrifugation. The freeze-thawing stabilities increased with increasing erythritol concentration from 0% to 9% (w/w) (Fig. 2 ). The highest stability (84.3%) was determined at the concentration of 9% (w/w), which was significantly higher than other concentrations (p < 0.01), indicating that addition of erythritol could increase the freeze-thawing stability of the curdlan gel. Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2016) investigated the addition of cyclodextrins on the freeze-thawing stability of kappa-carrageenan gel and determined that the highest stability was 76.4%. Evidence has shown that gelation could be enhanced by the addition of sugars and polyols (Stenner et al., 2016). The addition of sucrose to the gel has been suggested to be effective in improving the quality of frozen gels (Fuchigami, Teramoto, & Jibu, 2006). Sugars and polyols interact with water to an extent that depends on their molecular structure (Kuan, Nafchi, Huda, Ariffin, & Karim, 2016). The formation of intermolecular, crosslinking hydrogen bonds between the OH groups of curdlan and erythritol could enhance this stabilization (Stenner et al., 2016). Curdlan gel added with erythritol increased the percentage of syneresis in the freeze-thawing process. However, excessive erythritol may cause difficulty in clustering of curdlan strands and hinder the formation of the curdlan network, resulting in the decrease of hardness. Similar result was reported that gels turned to be mushy with a higher amount of starch added after freeze-thawing (Tuankriangkrai & Benjakul, 2010). We will observe the breaking force and deformation in the freeze-thawing process, which has a terrible impact on the textural characteristics (Tuankriangkrai et al., 2010). The formation of ice crystals during frozen storage disrupted the gel structure, and the breaking force and deformation also increase with the freeze-thawing cycles. So, the reason for the high freeze-thawing stability may be the high water holding capacity of erythritol and the binding between curdlan and erythritol. The addition of erythritol could increase the freeze-thawing stability of the curdlan gel with good appearance and overall liking."
14,FTIR spectra measurements,"3.3 FTIR spectra measurements The spectra of curdlan exhibited a broad, intense hydroxyl group stretching band at 3419 cm−1 and a weak C–H stretching vibration and symmetrical deformation vibration at around 2916 cm−1 and 1425 cm−1, respectively. These bands are typical characteristics of saccharides (Wang et al., 2019). The band in the region of 1640 cm−1 was due to the associated water (Zhang et al., 2018). Absorption at 1041 cm−1 could be attributed to the stretching vibrations of C–OH side groups and the band vibration of C–O–C glycosides (Yan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018). Absorption at 881 cm−1 indicated the presence of a beta configuration (Chen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), which was consistent with the linear β-1,3-D-glucan structure of curdlan. The spectra for erythritol shows that the absorptions of O–H (3255 cm−1) and C–H (2913 cm−1 and 1418 cm−1) were also present (Fig. 3 ). The very strong absorptions at 1083 cm−1 and 1049 cm−1 may be the stretching vibrations of C–O group, while the strong absorption at 966 was due to the rocking vibration of C–H2 (Jesus & Redinha, 2009). Compared with the spectra of curdlan or erythritol, there was no new absorption peak in the curdlan gel with 5% (w/w) erythritol, which indicated that there was no new substance formation. The peak of O–H vibration at 3268 cm−1 displayed the red shifts of curdlan and blue shifts of erythritol, suggesting hydrogen bonding between curdlan and erythritol (Yang et al., 2018). Both curdlan and erythritol contain hydroxyl groups, and their mixing and subsequent gelation did not lead to generation or disappearance of functional groups, but may easily have formed intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Yang et al., 2018)."
15,X-ray diffraction of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"3.4 X-ray diffraction of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels XRD measurements were performed to investigate the change of the crystallinity of the curdlan gel. The XRD patterns of curdlan, erythritol, and curdlan/erythritol gels are shown in Fig. 4 . The pure curdlan gel displays broad crystalline peaks at approximately 2θ = 20°, indicating a low crystallinity (Yan et al., 2020). Additional crystalline peaks at 2θ = 6° and 2θ = 12° have also been reported (Chen et al., 2017; Wudan et al., 2019). The very low crystalline peaks around 2θ = 6.5° may be associated with the assumed triple helical structure of curdlan (Yan et al., 2020). The characteristic diffraction peaks of erythritol were present at approximately 14.7°, 19.6°, 20.2°, 24.5°, 27.8°, 28.3°, 29.6°, and 31.2°, indicating that erythritol possessed a highly crystalline structure. The XRD data of the curdlan/erythritol gel showed that introduction of erythritol to curdlan gel clearly increased the crystallinity of the mixed gel (Fig. 4). The favorable crystallinity of erythritol may provide many protons after blending with curdlan gel. Aside from the high crystallinity of erythritol, we also noticed that the crystalline peaks of curdlan/erythritol gel near 2θ = 19° were coincident with the peaks in curdlan gel and erythritol, indicating that curdlan could still form complete crystals (Chen et al., 2017). The materials with a good compatibility could mess up each other's crystallization, results in the transformation of each component (Wu et al., 2012). The narrow peak near 2θ = 19° indicated the large crystal or crystalline region of the curdlan/erythritol gels, which shows that the good compatibility between curdlan and erythritol. After the addition of erythritol, this aspect of the gel structure may be due to the hydrogen bonding from erythritol penetrating into the network of curdlan."
16,Microstructures of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels,"3.5 Microstructures of the curdlan and curdlan/erythritol gels The microstructures of curdlan gel (Fig. 5 a and b) and curdlan gel with 5% (w/w) erythritol (Fig. 5c and d) were observed with SEM. Curdlan showed a uniform and compact network structure by the hydrogen bonds (Li et al., 2019; Verma et al., 2020). The pure curdlan gel was observed as a sheet with a porous structure (Li et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2015). Different sheets of the gel network connected by the thin and the weak bonds, which may be responsible for the low hardness, springiness, and cohesiveness of the curdlan gel. The highly ordered helical structure of curdlan was stabilized by the inter and intra strand hydrogen bonds (Qin et al., 2017). A compact structure was evident in the curdlan gel following the addition of erythritol. The addition of erythritol strengthened the connection bond, creating a much denser network. The strengthened bond could be attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding generated by hydroxyls between curdlan and erythritol. The improved textural characteristics observed could be explained by the addition of erythritol strengthening the curdlan gel network. The changes of gel structure were consistent with results of the above textural properties. In addition to the improved textural characteristics, the strengthened dense structure may also provide an improved combination with food or pharmaceutical ingredients for target delivery."
17,Molecular docking of curdlan and erythritol,"3.6 Molecular docking of curdlan and erythritol The molecular docking of erythritol with single strand curdlan is shown in Fig. 6 a using the Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) and stick models. The interaction between curdlan and erythritol was predicted by Discovery Studio with CDOCKER. The potential binding mode was calculated by a CHARMM-based molecular dynamics scheme to dock ligands into the curdlan binding site pocket. The best conformation of erythritol with single strand curdlan shows a CDOCKER energy of −0.04 kcal/mol and the CDOCKER interaction energy of 10.57 kcal/mol (Table 1 ). Compared with β-1,6-glucans, the less flexibility of curdlan with β-1,3-glucans linear structure could offer multiple binding sites. The glucose unit translational movement along the axis of the helices and exhibited a better binding region (Yu et al., 2019). Furthermore, the main driving forces for the binding of erythritol and curdlan were Van Der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. As shown in supplementary Fig. 1, the single helical conformation played a major role in the combination with erythritol for the dissociation of curdlan in hot water (Xiao et al., 2017; Yiannikouris et al., 2004). The hydrogen bond donor and acceptor of curdlan forms four hydrogen bonds with erythritol (Fig. 6a and supplementary Table 1). The single strand curdlan combines with H18 of erythritol (distance 2.51 and 2.41 Å), and the erythritol acts as the H acceptor (distance 1.96 and 2.76 Å). The β-1,3-glucans chain could favor a very stable intra-helical association with erythritol, which could be stabilized by β-1,6-glucans side chains (Yiannikouris et al., 2004). In the structure of triple helical curdlan (See Fig. 6b), each chain is stabilized via inter-strand hydrogen bonds between the (OH)2 groups, whereas the (OH)4 and (OH)6 groups are exposed on the surface of the structure (Qin et al., 2017). Among the binding sites, the best conformation of erythritol with triple helix curdlan has a CDOCKER energy of 6.75 kcal/mol and the CDOCKER interaction energy of 20.73 kcal/mol (Table 1 and supplementary Table 2). It shows seven hydrogen bonds forming between erythritol and the glucose residues of curdlan. The triple helix curdlan works as the H acceptor forming five hydrogen bonds with erythritol (distance 2.75, 2.97, 2.09, 2.87 and 2.66 Å) in A chain, and acts as H donor forming two hydrogen bonds (distance 2.40 and 2.87 Å) in C chain. These results confirm that erythritol can bind to curdlan and form hydrogen bonds. The addition of erythritol improving the textural characteristics could be explained by the interaction Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) models shown in the perspective view (see Fig. 6c). The erythritol binding to curdlan makes a strengthened skeleton (Fig. 5d), which could effectively improve the textural characteristics as pressed by the textural probe (supplementary Fig. 2). This could explain the reason the textural characteristics improved with the addition of erythritol."
18,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates that the addition of erythritol can improve the texture characteristics of curdlan gel. The TPA showed that increased concentrations of erythritol improved the textural characteristics of curdlan gels, although these decreased at higher erythritol concentrations. The optimum level of erythritol was found to be 5% (w/w). Moreover, the mixed curdlan and erythritol gel showed a gradual increase in freeze-thawing stability for the high water holding capacity of erythritol. The structures of curdlan/erythritol gels were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, and molecular docking. There was no new absorption peak in FITR spectra for the mixed gel of curdlan and erythritol, which indicated that there was no new substance formation. The peak of O–H vibration at 3268 cm−1 showed red shifts for curdlan and blue shifts for erythritol, indicative of hydrogen bonding between curdlan and erythritol. The XRD data showed that the favorable crystallinity of erythritol could make a beneficial increase in the crystallinity of the mixed gel. SEM additionally demonstrated that the addition of erythritol strengthened the connection bond to create a much denser network. Finally, molecular docking analysis showed that hydrogen bonds formed between curdlan and erythritol. Our results agree that large amounts of the dissociated single-helical chain were presented at 100 °C. The strengthened bond could be attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding generated by hydroxyls between erythritol and single-helical curdlan. Besides erythritol, other polyols or polysaccharides, such as konjac glucomannan (KGM), could be added to form the KGM-Curdlan-Erythritol gels. Other polyols or polysaccharides could wound around curdlan chains to form a more uniform and stable structure. Here, our study shows the addition of erythritol could enhance the textural characteristics of irreversible curdlan gel. Further study could investigate the effects of the addition of erythritol on the reversible gel, which will fully illustrate the formation of the curdlan gel."
