0,Introduction,"It is well known that our modern society is increasingly relying on the supply and consumption of energy. Fossil fuels were constantly considered as the main source of energy and feedstocks for chemical industry. With depletion of fossil fuel resources, more research focuses on alternative routes for a sustainable production of novel fuels (BP Energy Outlook, 2014). Lignocellulosic biomass presents a promising carbon source for the production of biofuels and chemicals (Alonso et al., 2010; Tompsett et al., 2011). Among numerous compounds that can be derived from biomass, γ-valerolactone (γ-VL) shows a high potential since it has numerous industrial applications. For instance, γ-VL can be used directly as green solvent in the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic materials or as fuel additive to enhance the fuel combustion process (Horvath et al., 2008; Fegyverneki et al., 2010). Moreover, γ-VL has been applied as starting material in the production of long chain alkanes and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran which could serve as biofuels and solvents (Geilen et al., 2010; Al-Shaal et al., 2014a; Elliott and Frye, 1999). γ-VL can be produced via hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA), a platform molecule derived from lignocellulosic materials (Wright and Palkovits, 2012; Wettstein et al., 2012). This reaction has been intensively studied using homogeneousand heterogeneous catalysts under different conditions. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that the hydrogenation of LA to γ-VL is possible under very mild conditions (Al-Shaal et al., 2012). Full conversion and selectivity toward γ-VL were achievable under room temperature and solvent-free conditions over Ru/C as a catalyst. A recent study has shown that γ-VL can be also produced from α-angelica lactone (α-AL), a dehydration product of LA (Al-Shaal et al., 2014b). Similar to LA hydrogenation, a direct hydrogenation of α-AL under mild conditions gives both high yield and selectivity toward γ-VL over Ru/C. In addition to LA and α-AL, Alkyl levulinates (AL) were identified as interesting starting material for the production of γ-VL (Démolis et al., 2014; Hengne et al., 2013; Geboers et al., 2014). AL can be obtained from biomass-based sugars, furfural, and furfuryl alcohol. Additionally, AL can be produced through the esterification of LA or the addition of alcohols to α-AL ( Scheme 1) (Melero et al., 2013; Jing et al., 2010; Van and Lange, 2007). In recent studies, an efficient reactive extraction of LA using butene esterification to butyl levulinate showed the direct access to such alkyl levulinates based on glucose and even cellulose (Murat Sen et al., 2012; Bond et al., 2010). Consequently, AL are promising starting materials for a subsequent transformation into γ-VL. The hydrogenation of AL is very similar to the hydrogenation of LA (Al-Shaal et al., 2012). In a previous study, we found that under relatively mild conditions in presence of alcoholic solvents over Ru/C as a catalyst LA is converted to GVL through γ-hydroxy valeric acid as an intermediate (Al-Shaal et al., 2012). Similarly, hydrogenation of AL first leads to the formation of esters of γ-hydroxy valeric acid. Next, the produced esters undergo lactonization to yield γ-VL and the related alcohols as byproducts ( Scheme 2). In line, water formation in the course of hydrogenation is avoided potentially facilitating a further hydrogenation to e.g. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (Al-Shaal et al., 2014a). Additionally, a hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates with short alkyl chains facilitates down-stream processing, as separation of an alcohol in the final step will be economically preferred compared to water (Bond et al., 2010). Although many studies have intensively discussed the production of alkyl levulinates and their conversion to γ-VL, only few studies focused on the kinetics of hydrogenation of LA and its ester to γ-VL (Murat Sen et al., 2012). Herein, we present a kinetic investigation of the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate (ML), ethyl levulinate (EL), and butyl levulinates (BL) to γ-VL using a supported ruthenium catalyst (Ru(5wt%)/C). The object of this work is to obtain kinetic information of the catalytic transformation of AL into γ-VL. Consequently, the rate-determining step in the reaction sequence can be identified as basis of future catalyst optimization and a potential process development will be enabled. In the presented kinetic study, effects of mass transfer on the reaction are evaluated. Furthermore, the influence of reaction parameters such as initial concentration, temperature, H2 pressure, and the substrate on the conversion of alkyl levulinates and the selectivity toward γ-VL are studied. The reactions were carried out at different temperatures in order to estimate the kinetic parameters."
1,Materials and methods,"Methyl levulinate (≥98%), ethyl levulinate (99%), butyl levulinate (98%), γ-valerolactone (99%), 1-hexanol (99.5%), and ruthenium (5wt%) on carbon were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol (99.8%) was purchased from Chemsolute. All chemicals were used without further purification or drying. The physical properties of Ru/C can be found in the Supporting Information. The experiments were carried out in a 50ML high pressure autoclave (Schlesinger B18rb250-01) equipped with a sampling valve. The autoclave was charged with the ester of levulinic acid (17.2mmol), methanol (10 g), 25mg Ru(5wt%)/C. The autoclave was flushed four times before applying the desired pressure. The autoclave was then preheated under hydrogen pressure to the desired temperature and operated at a pressure range of 3–10MPa, a temperature range of 333−393 K, and a stirring speed of 500–1000rpm (500rpm if not stated differently) and for 5h. The first sample was collected after placing the autoclave and reaching the desired temperature and the time was started (t0). Samples with volumes between 150 and 200µL were collected at different time intervals. After the reaction period, the autoclave was cooled down and depressurized. The collected samples were centrifuged to separate the catalyst and the liquid samples were diluted with methanol prior to analysis. The samples were analyzed with an Agilent HP6890 gas chromatograph (GC) using a CP-Wax-52 column with dimensions of 60m×250µm ×0.25µm and a flame ionization detector (FID). The carrier gas was nitrogen with a flow rate of 1.5mL/min, an inlet temperature of 250°C and a splitflow of 50mL/min. The following temperature program was used in the analysis of a liquid volume of 1µL: 70°C (5min) – 8°C/min – 200°C (15min). 1-hexanol was used as internal standard. The presence of γ -hydroxyvalerate in the reaction mixture was confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The qualitative analysis was performed by a Trace GC chromatograph 1310 equipped with a Restek Rxi-1 MS column (60m×250µm ×0.5µm) and a Thermo Scientific ISQ mass spectrometer (EI+, 70eV, 250°C)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Kinetic study,"3.1 Kinetic study The conversion of AL to γ-VL proceeds through two consecutive reactions. In presence of Ru/C (5wt%), AL convert firstly to the related intermediates, alkyl-γ-hydroxyvalerates (AHV). Subsequently, the intermediates undergo lactonization to form γ-VL and the corresponding alcohol (Scheme 2). In this kinetic study, methanol was the solvent of choice. Methanol minimizes any possible transesterification of the studied substrates thus increasing the selectivity of γ-VL. Since the reaction takes place in a three-phase system, mass transfer may cause limitations on the overall reaction rates. Therefore, prior to kinetic analysis the absence of transport limitation was verified (Kapteijn et al., 1999). The effect of external mass transfer was examined by varying the stirring speed between 500 and 1000rpm. Fig. 1 shows the effect of stirrer speed on the conversion of EL to γ-VL. The difference of the conversion is less than 5%, indicating the absence of external mass transfer limitations. For small catalyst particle of Ru/C (19µm), an intra-particle mass transfer resistance can be excluded. Additionally, criteria based on the observed reaction rate can be applied to verify the absence of mass transport limitations. The Carberry number was used to verify the absence of external mass transfer limitation and the Wheeler–Weisz criterion was applied to evaluate the absence of internal diffusion limitations (Dittmeyer and Emig, 2008; Satterfield, 1970). A detailed study of the impact of transport limitations on the kinetics is presented in the Supporting Information. Under the applied reaction conditions, mass transfer limitations can be neglected and the reaction is carried out in the intrinsic regime."
4,Effect of initial substrate concentration,"3.2 Effect of initial substrate concentration The dependency of the initial reaction rate on the initial substrate concentration can provide insight into the order of the reaction. The dependency of the initial reaction rate on different initial concentrations of EL (10, 20, 40 and 60wt%) at a reaction temperature of 333 K and 3MPaH2 pressure is presented in Fig. 2. The effect of the initial substrate concentration on the initial reaction rate can be described by classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. At lower concentrations, an apparent first order dependency is observed. At higher concentrations, saturation of catalyst surface takes place and an apparent zero order behavior occurs. In the selected concentration range (0.03–0.15M), the reaction rate follows the apparent first order dependency. Nevertheless, at higher concentrations above 1M, hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts exhibits apparent zero order kinetics with respect to the substrate (Crezee et al., 2003; Farbe et al., 2002; Singh and Vannice, 2000)."
5,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature Time resolved studies at different reaction temperatures were performed to investigate the effect of the temperature on the yield of the intermediate and the product. Fig. 3 shows time courses at different reaction temperatures for the conversion of ML to γ-hydroxy methylvalerate (MHV) and ultimately to γ-VL. At a low reaction temperature of 333K, the intermediate, MHV, is the major product and can be produced with a high yield of 90% after 5h. Lactonization of the intermediate to γ-VL occurs at rather low reaction rate at such low temperatures. By increasing the reaction temperature, the yield of MHV decreases along with an increase of the yield of γ-VL to a maximum of 82% at 393 K. This finding suggests that lactonization of MHV to form γ-VL is favorable at higher reaction temperatures."
6,Effect of hydrogen concentration,"3.4 Effect of hydrogen concentration The influence of hydrogen pressure on the conversion of AL was investigated by varying the hydrogen pressure between 3 and 10MPa at a temperature of 333K. The solubility of hydrogen inside the solvent increases with increasing pressure causing a positive effect on the conversion of AL to γ-VL. Fig. 4 depicts the effect of H2 pressure on the initial rate BL. The initial reaction rate increases linearly with increasing the H2 pressure. This observation indicates the first order dependency with respect to hydrogen, especially at lower pressure."
7,Effect of the nature of the substrate on the transformation to γ-VL,"3.5 Effect of the nature of the substrate on the transformation to γ-VL To study whether the used esters of levulinic acid influence the transformation to γ-VL, experiments with ML, EL, and, BL were performed. At an optimum temperature of 393K, γ-VL formation is facilitated for substrates with shorter alkyl residue ( Fig. 5). This is in agreement with a recent thermodynamic investigation of the alkyl levulinate hydrogenation in the presence of Raney Ni reported by Geboers et al. ( Geboers et al. 2014). In general, the observation can be explained by a higher stability of the intermediate formed based on substrates with longer alkyl residue. A maximum selectivity of γ-VL of 85% was achieved when ML was used as a substrate. Moreover, similar results were observed concerning the effect of the substrate on the conversion of AL (Fig. S1)."
8,Reaction kinetic modeling,"3.6 Reaction kinetic modeling Scheme 3 illustrates the reaction pathways of the catalytic conversion of AL to γ-VL. As the hydrogenation takes place on the surface of the catalyst, the lactonization step may occur in the alcoholic solution. This was reported before by Abdelrahman et. al. where they stated that γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, the intermediate of levulinic acid hydrogenation, is converted to γ-VL in the reaction solution rather on the surface of Ru/C (Abdelrahman et al., 2014). However, future work will focus on identifying the phase where the lactonization step is taking place and possible effects of the used solvent on this system. For developing kinetic models, it was assumed that no catalyst deactivation takes place during reaction. For hydrogenation, a kinetic model was developed by using rate expressions of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type under the following assumption: i) the reaction proceeds on active catalytic sites via a competitive adsorption of the reactants and a bimolecular surface reaction; ii) hydrogen adsorbs dissociatively; iii) adsorption of reactants and formation of half-hydrogenated species are in quasi equilibrium; iv) the rate-determining step (RDS) for each reaction is the addition of the second hydrogen atom to half-hydrogenated species (Horiuti and Polanyi, 1934; Boudart and Djega-Mariadassou, 1984; Harriott, 2002). The elementary reaction steps can be schematically represented as follows: (1) AL + s ↔ K AL AL s (2) H 2 + 2 s ↔ K H 2 ( H s ) (3) AL s + H s ↔ K A L s ( AL − H ) s + s (4) ( AL − H ) s + H s ↔ K 1 AHV s + s:RDS (5) AHV s ↔ 1 / K A H V AHV + s where s denotes a vacant active site. The following expressions are obtained for the surface coverage (θ) of AL, hydrogen, the half hydrogenation state and AHV: (6) θ AL = K AL C AL θ s (7) θ H = K H 1 / 2 C H 2 1 / 2 θ s (8) θ AL − H = K AL − H θ AL θ H / θ s (9) θ AHV = K AHV C AHV θ s Mass balance for surface coverage with assuming low coverage of half hydrogenation species will be: (10) θ AL = K AL C AL θ s (11) θ H = K H 1 / 2 C H 2 1 / 2 θ s The rate determining step (RDS) will be as follows: (12) r 1 = k 1 θ AL − H θ H = k 1 K AL − H K AL C AL K H C H 2 θ s 2 (13) r 1 = k 1 K AL C AL K H C H 2 ( 1 + K AL C AL + K H 1 / 2 C H 2 1 / 2 + K AHV C AHV ) 2 From experimental condition some simplification can be made. With low concentration of AL (0.045M) and low hydrogen bulk concentration (0.1–0.2M) (ESI), the Eq. (13) will be further simplified to be pseudo first order with respect to AL and H2 concentration (Eq. (14)). The adsorption of product (AHV) was assumed to be negligible. (14) r 1 = k 1 C AL C H 2 Lactonization was assumed to follow a first order behavior (Abdelrahman et al., 2014). Based on the reaction pathways illustrated in Scheme 3, the following ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be proposed for the individual components as a function of time: (15) d C AL dt = - ρ cat k 1 C AL C H 2 (16) d C AHV dt = ρ cat k 1 C AL C H 2 − k 2 C AHV (17) d C GVL dt = k 2 C AHV where C i represents the concentration of the component, k 1 is lumped parameter which includes adsorption constants (K AL and K H ) and ρ cat is the catalyst bulk density. Reaction parameters are estimated by minimizing the least-squares (LS) objective function, defined as the sum of squares of the residuals. Matlab was used for the numerical integration of the ODE. Fig. 6 shows the curve fitting for the experimental data of the conversion of ML, EL, and BL to γ-VL at temperatures of 373 and 393K. Table 1 summarizes the apparent reaction rate constants and the corresponding activation energies. For all substrates, the rate constants of lactonization are smaller compared to the rate constants of hydrogenation indicating that lactonization is the rate-determining step and controls the overall reaction rate. At the same time, activation energies of the hydrogenation and the lactonization steps increase in the following order: ML< EL< BL. Obviously, substrates with shorter alkyl residue exhibit a lower energy barrier for their transformation. This is in agreement with our experimantal results that longer alkyl residue complicate the formation of γ-VL. Nevertheless, the estimated activation energies for hydrogenation in the range of 41–58kJmol−1 and for lactonization between 50 and 63kJmol−1 are comparable with the reported values of the aqueous hydrogenation of LA to γ-VL over Ru/C (Abdelrahman et al., 2014). AL are available via different valorization routes e.g. starting from sugars, furfural, and furfuryl alcohol or via esterification of LA to facilitate separation (Murat Sen et al., 2012; Bond et al., 2010). Future studies will focus on the influence of the selected AL on subsequent transformations including catalyst stability for a hydrogenation to form γ-VL under continuous operation conditions and the energy demand for down-stream processing. Overall, AL enable a promising alternative pathway for a further valorization of LA and a potentially water-free hydrogenation to yield γ-VL."
9,Conclusions,"We have demonstrated the efficient transformation of methyl, ethyl and butyl levulinate into γ-valerolactone. Conducting a kinetic investigation with Ru supported on activated carbon as hydrogenation catalyst, a reaction sequence via hydrogenation of the substrate to the intermediate γ-hydroxyvalerate followed by lactonization to form γ-valerolactone could be identified. For hydrogenation, Langmuir Hinshelwood model was assumed and it was further simplified from experimental observation. Kinetic analysis indicates that for all reaction temperatures, lactonization occurred slower than hydrogenation establishing lactonization as rate-determining step. Alkyl levulinates with shorter alkyl residue facilitated an accelerated γ-valerolactone formation. The activation energies for the hydrogenation and lactonization steps of the studied alkyl levulinates are in the range of 41–58kJmol−1 and 50–63kJmol−1. Considering similar values for a transformation of levulinic acid, alkyl levulinates present promising intermediates for γ-valerolactone formation, especially, if water formation during hydrogenation has to be avoided for enhanced catalyst stability or if water hampers subsequent down-stream processing."
