0,Introduction,"With the predicted global increase in biodiesel production, it is anticipated that a market oversupply of glycerol, the major byproduct (approximately 10wt%) of biodiesel manufacture, will occur [1,2]. It is thus desirable to produce value-added species from waste glycerol. One commercially attractive product is glycidol (2,3-epoxy-1-propanol), a stabiliser used in the manufacture of vinyl polymers, oil additive and a precursor to novel energetic polymeric compounds. In principle, glycerol may be dehydrated to glycidol and computational chemistry experiments show that the reaction could occur at relatively high temperatures [3,4]. Hydride transfer and substitution mechanisms have been proposed [4] for the conversion of protonated glycerol under acidic conditions, having energy barriers between 21 and 25kcalmol−1. These reactions may become commercially important in the near future. Glycerol can also be converted to glycidol through allyl alcohol (prop-2-en-1-ol) via either a single step or two step process using alumina-supported iron oxide catalysts [5,6]. The unsaturated alcohol may then be epoxidised to glycidol using organic hydroperoxides (Fig. 1 ) in an aprotic organic solvent such as benzene over a range of supported transition metal catalysts, most significantly silica-supported titania [7,8]. Other supported metal catalysts, in particular silica-supported molybdena (MoO3), have been shown to effectively catalyse the epoxidation, however that activity has been attributed to rapid leaching of the molybdenum from the catalyst surface to yield a soluble molybdenum catalyst (MoO3-insoluble and Mo(CO)6-soluble, are also catalysts [9]). Other silica-supported metal oxides (e.g. V2O5, WO3, TiO2) in this system work via a similar mechanism. The silica-supported titania catalyst developed by Shell [10] was found to be truly heterogeneous, as it was both highly active and not subject to metal leaching. All of the silica-supported metal oxide catalysts were found to be severely hindered by the presence of water, due to competition with peroxides for the active catalyst sites. This limited the use of oxidising agents for the reaction to ecologically harmful organic peroxides, particularly tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Titanium silicate MFI (TS-1) was first produced in 1983 by Taramasso et al. [11] and was found to be substantially less adversely affected by water [12–14], meaning that hydrogen peroxide (normally supplied in a 30wt% aqueous solution) could then be used as a more environmentally benign oxidising agent. More recently, other titanium-containing zeolite topologies such as Ti-MWW or Ti-SBA-15 have been prepared in response to the limitation of TS-1 accommodating only smaller substrates such as linear olefins. Ti-MWW has been shown to be superior to TS-1 and Ti-BEA as an epoxidation catalyst under most conditions [15,16], however has gained less traction commercially. This study focuses primarily on catalytic systems in large-scale applications and hence TS-1 was used. Future studies are intended to explore Ti-MWW as an epoxidation catalyst. Allyl alcohol in particular presents certain obstacles to epoxidation. The hydroxyl group draws electron density away from the carbon double bond, rendering it less susceptible to attack by an electrophilic oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide [17]. Furthermore, under certain reaction conditions the epoxide moiety is susceptible to ring-opening reactions followed by nucleophilic attack to yield either glycerol by hydrolysis or diols by solvolysis. The primary focus of this study is to investigate the influence of the purity of the allyl alcohol reactant mixture, in particular, the effect of varying concentrations of impurities likely to be encountered in the production of allyl alcohol from waste glycerol derived from biodiesel manufacture."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The TS-1 used in all experiments was prepared as per Taramasso et al. [11], where 37.99g (0.182mol) of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Merck) and 0.61g (0.003mol) tetratethylorthotitanate (TEOT, Merck) were mixed at 35°C. The mixture was then cooled in an ice bath and 39.54g (0.194mol) of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) template (40wt% in water, Merck) was added dropwise using a burette. Following addition of the template, the mixture was heated to 80°C in order to evaporate ethanol produced by hydrolysis of TEOS. Distilled water was added to return the mixture to its initial volume. The pH was found to be 12.7, close to the published value of 12.2 [11]. The mixture was then transferred to a PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave fitted with a thermocouple, pressure gauge and pressure relief valve, and heated to 175°C for two days. The solid product was collected by centrifuging three times for 30min each at 4000rpm, washing with distilled water between extractions. The centrifuged product was dried for 5h at 120°C, yielding 11.47g of fine white solid which was heated first in nitrogen at 450°C for 2h, left to cool to ambient temperature and subsequently calcined in air at 550°C for 20h. The temperature ramp rate for both heat treatments was 2°Cmin−1. X-ray diffraction using a Phillips X’pert Pro diffractometer with Cu K α incident radiation (λ =1.5406Å) was used to characterise the catalyst and compare it to samples synthesised elsewhere [18]. The surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption and found using Langmuir isotherm to be 563m2 g−1."
3,Epoxidation of allyl alcohol,"2.2 Epoxidation of allyl alcohol In a typical experiment, 0.25g of TS-1, 2.90g (0.05mol) of allyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 22.5mL of solvent were added to a 100mL round bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, thermocouple and septum. The reactants were then heated to the required temperature and 5.67g of hydrogen peroxide (0.05mol, 30wt% aqueous) were added. In particular, the effects of solvent type, reaction temperature and the influence of impurities such as acrolein (propenal) likely to be encountered when conducting the reaction on a large scale were investigated. Molecular properties of the added impurities, in particular atomic charges and dipole moment, were calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set in density functional calculations in Spartan “10 [19]. A mixture containing allyl alcohol produced in a fixed bed reactor from the conversion of a 30wt% solution of glycerol using Fe2O3 coated alumina catalyst [5] was also produced in order to examine the use of a product which would be highly characteristic of one produced in an industrial process."
4,Analysis of reaction mixture,"2.3 Analysis of reaction mixture The composition of the reaction mixture was monitored by extracting aliquots of reactant material (∼0.03g) through the septum with a syringe which was then analysed by gas chromatography. Quantification of species concentrations in the reaction mixture was primarily obtained using an Agilent HP 5890 gas chromatograph fitted with a Restek Stabilwax column and flame ionisation detector. Gas flows were carrier gas (N2): 30mLmin−1, H2: 40mLmin−1, air: 400mLmin−1 and split ratio of 100:1. The injector temperature was 130°C, detector temperature 270°C and the temperature profile was to hold the oven at 35°C for 5min, ramping to 245°C over 10min and holding at 245°C for 25min. Identification of any unknown species was performed using an Agilent HP 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with a Restek CarboWax silica capillary column and 5973 mass-selective detector. Carrier gas used was helium, at a rate of 130mLmin−1 with a split ratio of 5:1. The injector temperature was 130°C, detector temperature was 235°C and the temperature profile was to hold the oven at 35°C for 5min, ramping to 220°C over 10min and holding at 245°C for 30min. The MSD filament was turned off during elution of the solvent peak in order to protect the equipment. The data obtained from these instruments was then used to calculate the conversion and selectivity of reactant species. The fractional conversion of allyl alcohol, X AA , and selectivity to glycidol, S glc/AA (mol percent) were calculated according to the following: (1) X A A = A A 0 − A A t A A 0 (2) S g l c / A A = g l c t M W A A X A A A A 0 M W g l c × 100 where [AA] is the concentration of allyl alcohol in the reaction mixture (ppm) at times corresponding to the subscripts 0 (initially) and t (at the time specified) and [glc] is the concentration of glycidol in the reaction mixture (ppm). MW AA and MW glc corresponds to the molecular mass of allyl alcohol (AA, 58.08gmol−1) and glycidol (glc, 74.08gmol−1), respectively. The selectivity of allyl alcohol to its associated by-products was obtained in the same way as for glycidol. In the case of by-products resulting from the oxidation of an impurity, the conversion of that impurity was first calculated as outlined in Eq. (1) and selectivity was calculated according to Eq. (2). Allyl alcohol or glycidol concentration in Eq. (1) and (2) were replaced with concentrations of impurity and oxidised impurity, respectively."
5,Results,
6,Catalyst synthesis,3.1 Catalyst synthesis The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2 ) shows that the zeolite synthesised is highly crystalline with a peak distribution corresponding to the MFI zeolite structure and an average crystallite size of ca. 62nm. No significant quantity of amorphous material was detected as indicated by the absence of a broad absorption at approximately 2Θ =10°–20°.
7,Effect of solvent type,"3.2 Effect of solvent type Ally alcohol was reacted with hydrogen peroxide at 60°C using three different solvents; methanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate. The results shown in Table 1 indicate that the highest conversion and selectivity to glycidol was obtained using ethyl acetate. For alcohol solvents there was little difference in allyl alcohol conversion, however selectivity to glycidol was lower for ethanol and more of the solvolysis by-products were formed. This suggests that the aprotonicity of the solvent is a significant contributor to the selectivity of the reaction, perhaps moreso than contributions due to steric effects. 3.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature At 60°C the fractional conversion of allyl alcohol reaches 0.45. Raising the temperature to 70°C increases the fractional conversion to 0.58. Using data derived from Fig. 3 the initial conversion rate constants (r 0) were found to be 8.79×10−5 s−1 and 1.22×10−4 s−1 at 60 and 70°C, respectively. Selectivity to glycidol however, decreased significantly at elevated temperature due to increased hydrolysis of glycidol to glycerol (Table 2 ). 3.2.2 The effect of added impurities Examining the relative initial rate data (α) in Table 3 , the added species which most inhibited the reaction was acrolein. It was initially thought that this may be due to the more highly reactive carbonyl functionality oxidising preferentially to the carbon–carbon pi bond in allyl alcohol, however no aldehyde oxidation products were observed. The addition of saturated aldehydes (acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde) however, appeared to have little effect on the conversion of allyl alcohol and in the case of acetaldehyde, promoted conversion and initial rate. Plotting the carbonyl oxygen atomic charge and dipole moment against relative conversion rate (Figs. 4 and 5 ) for the added impurities, it is clear that reaction promoters are those compounds with both high partial charge on the carbonyl oxygen and low dipole moment. When acrylic acid was introduced to the reaction, no oxirane-carboxylates were seen to be produced and further, the conversion of allyl alcohol increased. The addition of acetic acid further enhanced the initial reaction rate. Acrolein, like the other aldehydes tested, may bond with the peroxy proton in the transition state, however the highly reactive pi bond in acrolein does not appear to readily undergo epoxidation in this reaction, as evidenced by the high selectivity to glycidol as opposed to oxirane carbaldehydes and/or acrylic acid which would arise from the oxidation of acrolein. Further, iodometric titration showed that roughly twice as much peroxide remained in the reaction mixture containing acrolein than in the control reaction, evidence for inhibition of the reaction rather than depletion of oxidant. Thus the inhibition or promotion of the allyl alcohol epoxidation on TS-1 subtly depends on the structure and chemistry of the functionalities which interact with the peroxo moiety coordinated with the reactive titanium centre of the catalyst. 3.2.3 Reactions using product of catalytic glycerol conversion The product obtained from glycerol conversion contained 2.3wt% allyl alcohol, with approximately 3.5wt% each of glycerol, hydroxyacetone, acetic acid and propanoic acid, 2.5wt% acrolein and acetaldehyde, the remainder being water. Based on the findings outlined in Section 2.3 it was deemed necessary to distill the mixture in order to eliminate acrolein (because it poisoned the sites) and to concentrate the allyl alcohol so that the reaction would not be impeded due to excessive dilution of reactants. This was done using a reflux distillation unit with 4L boiling flask and 1.2m reflux column filled with 5mm dia. glass raschig rings. A reflux ratio of 5:1 was used and the fractions of highest allyl alcohol concentration were collected between 75 and 85°C. The resulting distillate contained 69wt% allyl alcohol, close to the allyl alcohol–water azeotrope of 72.3wt% [20]. It was found that milder reaction conditions (50°C) afforded higher glycidol yields (55%) whereas hydrolysis was promoted at the reaction temperature of 60°C. The importance of the solvent was also shown by reactions in which no solvent was used. In these cases allyl alcohol conversion remained relatively high (approximately 55%), however after about 60min reaction time the glycidol produced hydrolysed rapidly to glycerol and the maximum yield of glycidol was reduced to 15%. The glycidol produced from converted glycerol was further concentrated using vacuum distillation at 6.3kPa (abs). Similarly to the epoxidation reaction using genuine glycerol conversion products, hydrolysis of glycidol to glycerol was observed at temperatures greater than 45°C. The distillate produced by this method consisted of 12wt% glycidol (concentrated from 8.1wt%) and 7wt% allyl alcohol, the remainder being water with a small amount of glycerol (Figs. 6 and 7 )."
8,Discussion,"Allyl alcohol is a particularly unreactive candidate for epoxidation by an electrophilic oxidising agent due to the electron withdrawing nature of the hydroxyl group reducing electron density in the pi bond, thereby reducing susceptibility of the pi bond to epoxidation [13]. By the same token, the epoxy alcohol formed under the conditions required for the reaction is more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by solvent (solvolysis, resulting in ether diols) or water (hydrolysis, resulting in glycerol). Traditionally, low molecular weight alcohols (in particular methanol and ethanol) have been used as the solvent for this reaction. It is believed that hydrogen bonding interactions occur between the protic hydrogen in the solvent and an oxygen atom in the peroxide whilst coordinated with the tetrahedral titanium sites stabilise the 5-membered intermediate (Fig. 8 ), promoting reactivity [21]. In the case of aprotic solvents a water molecule occupies the alcohol (R–OH) position in the intermediate. TS-1 possesses relatively high hydrophobicity in comparison to other catalysts used to promote similar reactions e.g. Ti-beta or TS-1 prepared by the polystyrene bead method [21,22] and as such it might be expected that aprotic solvents would be less effective in forming and stabilising the intermediate. In this study however, an aprotic solvent compared favourably to protic solvents, in particular in terms of allyl alcohol conversion. Using aprotic solvents was also shown to inhibit solvolysis of glycidol and this may be attributed to aprotic solvents not readily engaging in nucleophilic substitution reactions. Significant amounts of the diols in approximately their anticipated ratios were observed when using protic solvents. As expected, the initial reaction rate for allyl alcohol conversion increased significantly as the temperature was increased from 60 to 70°C, however overall selectivity to glycidol decreased. This can be attributed to harsher reaction conditions increasing the rate of solvolysis and/or hydrolysis with glycidol formed during the catalytic reaction. Reducing the temperature to 50°C saw a reduction in hydrolysis of glycidol to glycerol and in fact this reaction is carried out at 40–45°C on an industrial scale [23]. In the absence of a catalyst, the hydrolysis is relatively slow, the kinetic rate of hydrolysis being reported as 2.8×10−7 s−1 to 1.9×10−6 s−1 at 20 and 37°C, respectively [24,25]. Of the impurities examined, acrolein, was found to be by far the most detrimental to glycidol yield. No acrolein oxidation products (acrylic acid or oxirane carbaldehyde) were detected in the reaction mixture at any stage. Further, acrolein does not oxidise under the reaction conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide with or without TS-1 catalyst, ruling out the likelihood of competitive oxidation as being the reason for the inhibition of the allyl alcohol epoxidation reaction. Propionaldehyde and benzaldehyde appear to have little effect on the conversion and selectivity of allyl alcohol to glycidol, suggesting that steric factors and/or the acidity of the impurity may contribute to rate enhancement. It has been shown that reaction promoters, particularly carboxylic acids are those species possessing low dipole moment and high partial charge on the carbonyl oxygen. As such, it is suggested that hydrogen bonding occurs between reaction promoters and the peroxy proton in the transition state which typically features a coordinated allyl alcohol, increasing the interaction between the adjacent peroxy oxygen atom and the allyl pi bond (Fig. 8). Significant enhancement of the rate in the presence of carboxylic acids, which offers more sites for strengthening of the hydrogen bonding in the transition state, supports this concept. Computational and experimental studies show that transition state stabilisation by hydrogen bonding occurs in similar systems [26,27]. In situ FTIR experiments are currently underway to investigate this hypothesis further. A product representative of the feed mixture likely to be encountered on an industrial scale was obtained and subsequently distilled in order to remove acrolein. This was based on the findings in Section 2.3 to produce feed for the epoxidation reaction of, at best, 69wt% allyl alcohol, the remainder being primarily water with a small amount of acrolein and acrolein dimers. The increased yield of glycidol at a lower reaction temperature (50°C, as opposed to 60°C) can be attributed to kinetic effects, given the glycidol hydrolysis rates mentioned previously. The overall yield of glycidol obtained from this reaction mixture was equal or better than that obtained for the neat reaction mixture, at 55%. The subsequent concentration of glycidol by distillation has proved problematic in particular with respect to preventing hydrolysis, even at relatively low temperatures, under vacuum. Efforts at this time are focussing on the development of practical techniques for separating glycidol, whilst minimising hydrolysis."
9,Conclusions,"Highly selective epoxidation of allyl alcohol to glycidol by hydrogen peroxide over TS-1 has been shown to be achievable under a strict set of reaction conditions. The feed mixture for the reaction obtained by other catalytic processes is highly likely to contain certain impurities which inhibit the yield of the epoxidation reaction. A relationship between the partial charge on the carbonyl oxygen and the rate was observed. Of the species examined, acrolein was found to be the most detrimental to the success of the reaction and the mechanism of this is the topic of current studies. Acrolein and other low-boiling impurities can be removed from the feed mixture by fractional distillation to produce a solution representative of the allyl alcohol–water azeotrope, with a small amount of impurities such as acrolein and acrolein dimers. The yield obtained from the epoxidation of this feed mixture is equivalent to that obtained using simulated reaction mixtures. The subsequent refinement of the glycidol produced is the subject of further research."
