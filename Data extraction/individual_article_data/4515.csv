0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (HA, typically referring to alcohols with 2–6 carbon atoms), have broad commercial applications: they can be used as clean gasoline additives, as high-quality fuels or as raw materials for chemical production [1,2]. HA are mainly synthesized by biomass fermentation or hydration of olefins, while a promising alternative way can be the direct conversion from syngas [3,4]. Syngas has been considered as an important platform compound, which has a wide range of sources and mature conversion processes to lots of value-added products [5]. Direct conversion of syngas to HA is not only an effective way for the clean use of fossil energy, but also can utilize renewable resources (e.g. biomass), which has attractive application prospects and great economic value. In recent years, higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) direct from syngas has received extensive attention, and the development of high-performance catalysts becomes the key research point. The CoCu based catalysts for HAS can date back to 1978, when first reported by Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) with great HA selectivity and low cost [6]. It was believed that in CoCu catalysts, the metallic Co site is active for CO dissociation and the subsequent carbon chain growth, while metallic Cu can catalyze the CO non-dissociative adsorption and its following insertion to form alcohols. The efficient combination of Co and Cu components is crucial for the improved synergistic catalysis, leading to excellent catalytic performances in HAS [5]. Using specific bimetallic catalyst precursors to confine Co and Cu species in the same structures has been a common strategy to synthesize close contacted CoCu catalyst [7–10]. However, due to the low solubility between Co and Cu phases as well as the high surface energy of Cu, the aggregation of Cu species is of frequent occurrence, leading to the separation of bimetallic phase during preparation process. As a result, not only the synergistic catalysis of Co and Cu would be inhibited, but also the exposed surface active sites would decrease, causing the catalyst deactivation [11]. To avoid these drawbacks, in our previous research, a highly dispersed CoCu bimetallic catalyst encapsulated inside KIT-6 was prepared by introducing CoCu glyoxylate complex into the mesoporous channels of KIT-6, which showed great catalytic performance in HAS [12]. However, there still exist some separated Cu particles in addition to CoCu alloy species. Therefore, finding a suitable catalyst precursor that can keep the bimetallic phase in close contact, uniform distribution and superior stability remains to be the key for HAS. Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have been widely used as self-sacrificing supports or precursors in heterogeneous catalysis [13]. As catalyst precursors, the MOF structures possess adjustable chemical composition as well as the periodically and orderly arranged hybrid metal nodes in the scaffolds, which can be further converted to uniformly distributed and close interacted mixed-metal species [14,15]. It has been reported that direct heat treatment of Cu substituted Co-MOF can obtain CuCo2O4 which not only inherited the ordered structures of the parent MOF precursors but also realized the synergetic effect of close contacted Co and Cu species [16,17]. However, after further reduction of MOF-derived oxides into active metal catalysts, the structural collapse often occurs, causing particle agglomeration and unsatisfied catalytic performance [18]. To improve the dispersion and stability, encapsulation of metal particles in porous materials could be an effective strategy [12,19]. Here, a highly dispersed CoCu catalyst encapsulated in mesopores derived from in-situ grown Cu substituted Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67, a typical MOF material created from assembly of Co ions with 2-methylimidazole ligands) inside KIT-6 was proposed. Compared to the catalyst using amorphous CoCu-glyoxylate complex as precursor, the Co and Cu species derived from Cu-ZIF-67 exhibit more homogeneous arrangement, higher dispersion, and absence of aggregated Cu particles, which probably benefits from the inherit of the ordered MOF structures. With optimized Co/Cu ratio, the CO conversion and space time yield (STY) towards C2+ alcohols were both promoted as well as the lifespan achieved over 160 h. Moreover, it is demonstrated that owing to the periodically and orderly arranged metal structure of Cu-ZIF-67 precursors, not only the CO dissociation step was promoted but also the coordination of CO insertion and dissociation was facilitated. This fabrication method and understanding of the structure-performance relationship are expected to provide guidance for the design and synthesis of high-performance CoCu catalysts for HAS."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Cu-ZIF-67-x@KIT-6 precursor and the CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts were prepared by following procedures [17,18], where × (x = 2, 4, 8) refers to the molar ratio of Co/Cu, and Z refers to the Cu modified ZIF precursors. The Cu modified ZIF precursors were first in situ grown inside KIT-6, and then decomposed to bimetallic CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts. Typically, the required amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 1 g KIT-6 were dissolved in 80 mL ethanol to form mixture A, in which the total metal loading maintained about 5.5 wt%. Then the 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in another 80 mL ethanol to form solution B. The molar ratio of 2-methylimidazole to total metals was 4. The solution A and B were mixed under intense stirring with reflux in 353 K for 6 h and followed by standing for 3 days at room temperature. The collected precipitation was washed by ethanol and dried overnight at 333 K to obtain Cu-ZIF-67-x@KIT-6. The CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts were obtained after pyrolysis at 823 K for 4 h under N2 atmosphere first and then calcined at 673 K for 2 h under air. For comparison, we further prepared the Cu-ZIF-67-x following the same procedures as Cu-ZIF-67-x@KIT-6, but without adding KIT-6 support. In order to investigate the effect of the structure of precursors, Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst derived from CoCu-glyoxylate complex was synthesized. According to the typical process reported in our previous study,12 0.409 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.085 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 2 g KIT-6 were mixed with 10 mL EG to form an uniform solution, which was kept stirring for 12 h before drying in vacuum at 393 K. After that, the sample was first pyrolyzed at 823 K for 4 h under N2 atmosphere and then calcined at 673 K for 2 h under air to obtain the final Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst, which was in consistent with the pyrolysis process as CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area and pore size distribution were measured using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms by a Micromeritics Tristar II 3000 apparatus at 77 K. The sample was first degassed at 573 K under N2 atmosphere before characterization. The copper and cobalt loading in the catalysts were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian Vista-MPX). The digestion procedures were as follows: about 20 mg of the catalyst was dissolved in a mixed acid solution consisted of 7 mL 37 wt% nitric acid, 1 mL 36 wt% hydrochloric acid and 1 mL 49 wt% hydrofluoric acid, and then 20 mL saturated boric acid solution was added in to the above solution to form the test sample. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded by a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer equipped with graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at room temperature. The particle sizes of the certain phase were calculated by the Scherer equation. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data was detected by the Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. 1 mg catalyst sample was mixed with 100 mg KBr and then compressed. The scanning range was 4000–400 cm−1, the resolution was 4 cm−1, and the frequency was 32 times. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 employed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After pretreatment in Ar flow at 473 K for 2 h, the sample was heated in 10% H2-Ar to 973 K. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) were tested on a JEM-2100 F electron microscope. The sample was dissolved in ethanol and dropped onto an ultrathin carbon film. The particle size distributions were counted based on over 200 particles in different sections. The in situ FTIR spectra for CO adsorption were collected by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector. The samples were grounded and pressed at 10 MPa to form self-supporting disks. The sample disk was reduced in-situ at 673 K under H2 for 1 h and cooled down to 303 K under He. Later, the background was collected under He-flow and the CO was switched in and kept for half an hour. Then He gas was re-injected and purged for 1 h to remove the residual CO, meanwhile the spectra were scanned and recorded until the signal no longer changed. After mass normalization, the final spectrum was deconvoluted and the peak areas were integrated to estimate the content of each phase."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation The catalytic performance was evaluated using a fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst was tableted to 40–60 mesh and mixed with quartz sand before packed into the reactor. After the in-situ reduction under H2 at 673 K for 4 h, the catalyst was evaluated under 543 K, 3 MPa, GHSV = 4800 mL‧gcat −1‧h−1 and H2/CO/N2 = 4/4/1, where the N2 was used as the internal standard. The reaction product first passed through a hot trap and a cold trap, and then divided into two parts, a gas phase and a liquid phase. The outlet gas was analyzed online by an Agilent GC 7890 instrument connected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a TDX-1 column and a flame ionization detector (FID) connected with a HP-Plot Q capillary column. CO, CO2, CH4, H2, N2 were analyzed by TCD while hydrocarbons were analyzed by FID, and the peak of CH4 was used to normalized the signals from different detectors. The column temperature was first kept at 323 K for 7 min, and then increased to 423 K at a rate of 10 K/min and further kept for 5 min. The liquid products were analyzed by an Agilent GC 4890 instrument with FID connecting a DB-FFAP column, using 2-butanol as internal standard. And the temperature was first increased to 473 K at a rate of 10 K/min and then retained for 10 min. The data were collected after 30 h on-stream when the reaction was in steady state. The stability test of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst was evaluated under the same conditions, and also use the N2 as internal standard for online analysis of outlet gas products. The space–time yield (STY) of higher alcohols for each catalyst was based on the obtained higher alcohols in per unit time by unit mass of catalyst. The Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) plots for alcohols and hydrocarbons were obtained by the following equation (Eq. (1), [20]), and the corresponding carbon chain growth probability was estimated by the slope of the ASF plot. (1) ln w n n = n ln α + c o n s t a n t"

6,Synthesize the CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts via in-situ grown Cu-ZIF-67 in the mesopores of KIT-6,"3.1 Synthesize the CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts via in-situ grown Cu-ZIF-67 in the mesopores of KIT-6 The CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts were synthesized by a facile route as displayed in Scheme 1 , in which ‘Z’ represents Cu modified ZIF-67 precursor and × refers to the ratio of Co/Cu. First, the 2-methylimidazole was mixed with Co2+, Cu2+ and KIT-6 to obtain the in-situ grown Cu modified ZIF-67 crystal inside mesopores of KIT-6, donated as Cu-ZIF-67-x@KIT-6 (x also refers to the Co/Cu ratio), in which the Co and Cu species had close distance in the same ordered MOF structure. Then the precursor was pyrolyzed in N2 and turned into amorphous carbon to confine the metal particles within the mesopores and prevent the particle from aggregation. Finally, after calcination in air, the carbon was removed and the highly dispersed mixed CoCu oxides encapsulated in KIT-6 were obtained, named as CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6. To identify whether the crystalline structure of Cu-ZIF-67-x was successfully in-situ synthesized inside the mesopores of KIT-6, FTIR and wide-angle XRD characterizations of Cu-ZIF-67-4@KIT-6 were conducted, with bulk Cu-ZIF-67-4 material as a comparison. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), it is obvious that FTIR spectra of bulk Cu-ZIF-67-4 exhibits characteristic bands of C = N, Co-N at 1580 cm−1 and 425 cm−1, respectively, and has several bands at 600–1500 cm−1 which can be attributed to C–H stretching vibration [21]. For Cu-ZIF-67-4@KIT-6, in addition to above peaks, there also existed the bands at 1050 cm−1 and 809 cm−1, which are corresponding to Si-O-Si species, indicating the co-existence of Cu-ZIF-67-4 and silica support in Cu-ZIF-67-4@KIT-6 [22]. The 425 cm−1 peak slightly shifted to higher positions, which could be owing to the existence of shoulder peaks attributable to the Si-O species [23]. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 1(b), the appearance of the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.6° and 26.7° in the Cu-ZIF-67-4@KIT-6 sample indicate the crystalline structures of Cu modified ZIF-67 [24]. The relatively weak intensity of those peaks could be explained by the small size of the MOF crystals and the encapsulated structures [18]. The CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts with different Co/Cu ratio were then synthesized, characterized and compared with Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst derived from CoCu-glyoxylate complex. The Co and Cu loading in each catalyst was characterized by ICP-OES and the molar ratio of Co/Cu was varied from 1.8 to 7.5 as listed in Table S1. In order to further characterize the textural structure of CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts, the low-angle XRD and N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. S1(a), in the low-angle XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (2 1 1), (2 2 0) and (4 2 0) planes of typical KIT-6 material are also visible in Cu-ZIF-67-4@KIT-6, indicating the characteristic cubic mesopores with Ia3d symmetry still maintained after the encapsulation of Cu-ZIF-67 crystal inside mesopores of KIT-6 [25]. Fig. S1(b) displays the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of as-prepared catalysts and parent KIT-6 support, in which the type IV isotherms with H1 type hysteresis loops are present in all samples, suggesting the existence of cylindrical ordered mesopores.[26] The pore size distribution curves in Fig. S1(c) and the average pore diameter listed in Table S1 all show the pore sizes of CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 and CoxCu1-G@KIT-6 samples are slightly smaller than that of KIT-6, implying the Co and Cu species were encapsulated within mesopores of KIT-6 in above samples, which is consistent with the XRD results. Thus, both Cu-ZIF-67-4 and CoCu-glyoxylate derived catalysts have been successfully encapsulated within the mesopores of KIT-6 without destroying the ordered mesoporous structure."
7,Catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts in HAS,"3.2 Catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts in HAS The CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts have been evaluated in HAS under 543 K, 3 MPa, H2/CO = 1, and GHSV = 4800 mL∙gcat −1∙h−1, and the results were listed in Table 1 . For CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts, with increasing the ratio of Co/Cu from 1.8 to 7.5, the CO conversion gradually increased from 29.1% to 44.9%, while the selectivity of alcohols increased first and then decreased, which peaked at Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 with 35.6%. In addition, the C2+OH distribution of each CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst was more than 72 wt%, while the STY of C2+OH increased first and then decreased as the ratio of Co/Cu increased, and achieved the highest of 11.1 mmol‧gcat −1‧h−1 in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6. According to our previous research and literature reports, the suitable ratio of Co/Cu in the CoCu-based catalysts will facilitate the synergistic catalysis between dual active sites, which was also considered to account for the best catalytic performance of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 [27–29]. Table S2 summarized the catalytic performance of some representative catalysts in higher alcohol synthesis. It should be noted the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst achieved superior catalytic performance compared to these reports, on the condition that the total metal loading was only 5.5 wt% in this work. In order to further investigate the role of ordered structure of catalyst precursor, the Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst, which has the same Co/Cu ratio and derived from amorphous CoCu-glyoxylate, was compared with the optimal Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst, and the evaluation results under the same reaction conditions were listed in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . The Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 performed a CO conversion of only 18.5%, a selectivity towards alcohols of 27.2% and a C2+OH distribution of 66.6 wt%, which were all inferior compared to Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6. The STY towards HA of the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 and Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalysts were also calculated. The Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst derived from the ordered MOF precursor has a STY of HA with 11.1 mmol‧gcat −1‧h−1 which is 3 times as high as that of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6. The chain growth probabilities for alcohols (αROH) and hydrocarbons (αHC) of each catalyst were calculated according to the ASF plots as shown in Fig. 3 . With increasing the Co/Cu ratio, the αHC increased from 0.49 to 0.53, which may result from the enhanced CO dissociation and chain growth. Meanwhile, the αROH from Co2Cu1-Z@KIT-6 to Co8Cu1-Z@KIT-6 also increased, but it decreased with the further increasing Co/Cu ratio. It is indicated that the lack of Cu sites adjacent to Co species in Co8Cu1-Z@KIT-6 would inhibit the CO insertion to form higher alcohols. The Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst derived from the CoCu-glyoxylate show similar αHC (0.52) but obvious decreased αROH (0.47) compared to Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, indicating the Co and Cu sites possess closer intimacy in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6. Moreover, it is worth noting that the αROH was higher than αHC in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, meaning the CHX*–CO* coupling become the major pathway for carbon chain growth, which may be attributed to the excellent cooperation between Cu and Co sites. The differences in catalytic performance of each catalyst may be related to the surface structure, for example, the distribution of bimetallic sites or the dispersion of active species, which we will discuss in the following section [30]."
8,Characterization of active species in CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 and Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalysts,"3.3 Characterization of active species in CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 and Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalysts The structures of calcined CoxCu1-Z@KIT-6 catalysts were investigated by XRD and H2-TPR characterizations as displayed in Fig. S2. The samples all show the characteristic diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 31.2°, 36.8°, 44.8°, 59.3° and 65.2°, which could be indexed to Co3O4 or CuxCo3-xO4 phase (JCPDS#42–1467 or #25–0270). There are two separate reduction peaks in the H2-TPR profile of Co2Cu1-Z@KIT-6 at 473 K and 533 K. Combined with XRD analysis, the above peaks can be attributed to the H2 consumption of CuxCo3-xO4 and Co3O4 species, respectively, because the CoCu spinel oxide is considered to be more reducible compared with Co3O4 [7,8,31]. Moreover, a single H2-consumed peak can be seen at 533 K in the Co8Cu1-Z@KIT-6, implying that with low content of Cu, the dominant phase is Co3O4 in this sample. As for Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, there appears a main peak at 473 K, indicating this sample mainly exists as CuxCo3-xO4. Therefore, when the ratio of Co/Cu is appropriate, the bimetallic CoCu phases can be formed without separate Cu or Co species, which may also be the key to the superior catalytic performance of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst. As contrast, the phase structure of calcined Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst was also characterized. As exhibited in Fig. 4 (a), it is shown that the diffraction peaks can all be assigned to Co3O4 or CuxCo3-xO4 species. The H2-TPR profiles of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 was displayed in Fig. 4(b), in which there are a main peak at 523 K with a shoulder peak around 473 K, indicating that compared to Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, the major phase became Co3O4 and with small amount of CuxCo3-xO4. The segregation of Co3O4 phase implied the insufficient interaction and low intimacy of Cu and Co species derived from the amorphous CoCu glyoxylate precursor, which could weaken the synergetic catalysis between them, leading to inferior HAS catalytic performance of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6. Because the catalysts were in-situ reduced before catalyst evaluation in HAS reactions, the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 and Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalysts after reduction were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the XRD pattern of the reduced Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst displays weak and wide diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 43.6°, which can be assigned to Co0.52Cu0.48 species (JCPDS #50-1452), indicating the formation of highly dispersed CoCu bimetallic species. For the reduced Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 sample, apart from the diffraction peak of Co0.52Cu0.48, there also existed a diffraction peak located at 2θ = 36.5° attributable to CoO phase (JCPDS #48-1719). In CoCu based catalysts, Cu is usually believed to promote the reduction of Co species [32,33]. Thus, it could be deduced that the insufficient reduction of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 derived from the amorphous CoCu glyoxylate precursor suggested the limited interactions between Cu and Co species in Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6, which was in accordance with the H2-TPR results. To visually demonstrate the morphology, crystalline structure and particle distributions of the reduced catalysts, the TEM and HRTEM were conducted as shown in Fig. 5 . The highly dispersed particles encapsulated in mesopores of KIT-6 was shown in the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst. No visible particle aggregation at the edge of mesoporous channels and particles are quite uniformly distributed with the average particle size around 2.5 nm. In the corresponding HRTEM images shown in Fig. 5 (e–f), the lattice fringes with the d-spacing of 0.207 nm can be ascribed to the (1 1 1) plane of Cu0.52Co0.48 phase, indicating the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 mainly existed as well-dispersed CoCu alloy [34]. As for the reduced Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 sample, there are not only highly dispersed particles confined in mesopores but also some aggregated ones outside the KIT-6 channels. Moreover, apart from fringes of Cu0.52Co0.48, there also exist lattice spacings of 0.246 nm in Fig. 5 (g) and 0.210 nm in Fig. 5 (h), which can be assigned to CoO (1 1 1) plane and Cu (1 1 1) plane, respectively [35,36]. This indicates that not only the phase separation of CoCu bimetallic sites occurred, but also the Cu particles was agglomerated outside the mesopores, leading to the uneven distribution of Co and Cu sites as well as the increased mean particle size of 5.5 nm in Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst. According to the XRD and TEM results of reduced catalysts, compare with the Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 prepared from amorphous CoCu-glyoxylate complex precursor, the higher dispersion degree, more uniform distribution and closer interaction of Co and Cu active sites can be obtained in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 derived from the ordered MOF precursor. As a result, a better synergistic catalysis between Co and Cu was achieved by Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, which further obtained a CO conversion and a STY towards C2+OH about 2 and 3 times as high as those of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6, respectively."
9,The effect of the order degree of catalyst precursor on CO adsorption,"3.4 The effect of the order degree of catalyst precursor on CO adsorption To further investigate the effect of the structural differences derived from catalyst precursors of varied order degree, in-situ FTIR of CO adsorption was conducted and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 6 . According to literatures, the adsorption bands at 1630 and 1850 cm−1 can be assigned to CO adsorbed on Co0 in bridging geometries, while the bands at 2030 cm−1 is due to the CO linearly bonded with Co0 species [37,38]. Moreover, it has been reported the bands at the range of 2050 cm−1 to 2140 cm−1 can be attributed to CO linearly adsorbed on Coδ+ species and the bands at around 2120–2150 cm−1 are usually assigned to CO bonded on Cu species in linear type [39–42]. After in combination with the XRD analysis, the band at 2105 and 2125 cm−1 can be ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed on CoO and Cu species, respectively. Due to the weak CO adsorption capacity of Cu0, here the Cu species should be Cu+ species [43,44]. Therefore, in Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst, there exist CoO, Cu+ and diverse Co0 species, while Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 possesses Cu + and single type of Co0 species favoring CO bridge adsorption, as exhibited in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the peak intensity of 2125 cm−1 of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 is quite stronger than that of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6, which may be due to the higher dispersion of the former sample, as coincided with TEM results. In addition, the absence of the band at 2105 cm−1 in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 indicated that owing to the close interaction of Co and Cu sites in this sample, the reduction of Co species was promoted and no segregation of CoO phase, which was also in agreement of the XRD results. It is believed that the lower stretching frequency of CO adsorption suggests higher binding strength between metal-carbon bond, which weakens the bond of C* and O* and facilitates CO dissociation [30,45]. Notably, all Co sites in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 can strongly absorbed CO, while in Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6, there exist some Co0 species with lower CO adsorption strength, which can be contributed from corner or step Co sites [30,46]. Thus, it can be deduced that the Co species in the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 derived from the ordered MOF precursors possess higher capability in CO dissociation and more uniform distribution, in agreement of the XRD and TEM results. As a result, the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 possessing more highly active Co species obtained higher conversion of CO in HAS. In order to better illustrate the differences in CO adsorption behavior between above two catalysts, the IR spectra were deconvoluted and the peak-fitting results were shown in Fig. S3. As mentioned above, the bridge-type adsorbed CO in lower frequency tend to dissociate while the linearly absorbed CO prefers direct insertion on the catalyst surface [30,45]. Therefore, the CO adsorption bands at 1630 and 1850 cm−1 could represent CO dissociation sites while the bands at 2030, 2105 and 2125 cm−1 are considered as CO insertion sites in HAS. According to peak analysis results shown in Fig. S3, for Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst, the ratio between CO dissociative adsorption sites and the CO associative adsorption sites is around 1:1, while that becomes 3:1 in Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 sample, indicating the amount of two different types of active sites is more balanced in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6. Accordingly, a better synergy between the CO dissociation and CO insertion processes can be achieved in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 derived from ordered MOF precursors, leading to promoted STY of HA. Based on the above discussions, it was found that the Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 catalyst inherited the structural advantages of the ordered in-situ grown Cu-ZIF-67-4 precursor encapsulated inside KIT-6, leading to highly dispersed and homogeneous distributed Co and Cu dual active sites without phase separation or aggregation, which was the key to high catalytic performance in HAS."
10,Stability test of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst in HAS,"3.5 Stability test of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst in HAS To further test the stability of Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst, the sample was evaluated in HAS under T = 543 K, P = 3 MPa, GHSV = 4800 mL‧gcat −1‧h−1 and H2 /CO = 1 for over 160 h, and the results are exhibited in Fig. 7 . The CO conversion and the selectivity to alcohols maintain stable with 39.7% and 35.6%, respectively, and no visible deactivation within 160 h reaction. The excellent catalyst stability may come from highly dispersed and uniform distributed Co and Cu sites confined in ordered mesopores in used Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 as shown in Fig. 8 . Compared to the reduced catalyst, the used sample showed a weak and wide peak of overlapped signals corresponding to CoCu alloy and Co species. Consistently, the TEM results verified the highly dispersed morphology of metal particles encapsulated in KIT-6 and the preservation of CoCu bimetallic phase. Notably, the presence of the individual Co phase under reaction conditions did not increase the selectivity of hydrocarbons, possibly owing to it close interaction with CoCu species. Similarly, the mixed Cu–Co alloy with Co-enriched surfaces was reported as ideal sites for the HAS [11]."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a highly dispersed bimetallic CoCu catalyst encapsulated in mesopores was proposed for HAS derived from the ordered Cu-ZIF-67 precursor in-situ grown inside KIT-6. Compared with the Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6 derived from amorphous CoCu-glyoxylate complex precursor, the higher dispersion, more homogeneous arrangement and closer interaction of Co and Cu active sites was found in the as-prepared Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6, which is believed to be benefited from the inheritance of ordered MOF structures. The Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance with a CO conversion of 39.7% and a STY of C2+ alcohols of 11.1 mmol‧gcat −1‧h−1 which was 2 and 3 times as high as those of Co4Cu1-G@KIT-6, respectively. And no visible deactivation was detected over 160 h reaction. Moreover, it was proved by FTIR that the order degree of catalyst precursor had great impact on CO adsorption. All cobalt species in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 catalyst was demonstrated to possess high CO dissociation capacity favoring CO bridge-type adsorption. In addition, the peak-fitting of IR profiles illustrated that the promoted synergy of CO dissociation and CO insertion can be achieved in Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6. Consequently, the Co4Cu1-Z@KIT-6 obtained greatly enhanced catalytic performance in HAS. This work provides new insights for the influence of catalyst precursor in preparation of high-performance CoCu based catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas."
