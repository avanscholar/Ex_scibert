0,Introduction,"Porous carbon nanomaterials such as ordered mesoporous carbon [1–3], porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) [4–6], and activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs) [7,8] have attracted a lot of attention because of their unique crystalline structure as well as excellent physical and chemical properties. These porous carbon nanomaterials can be used in a wide range of promising applications such as adsorbents [2,7], catalyst supports [9], electrode materials [10,11], sensors [12], and hydrogen storage devices [13]. Hydrogen storage has been extensively studied due to global warming caused by the increase of CO2 concentration. Due to the environmental pollution and the energy crisis, hydrogen has become a promising energy substitute for fossil fuels in automotive applications. In the past few years, several methods including liquefaction, compression, and solid-state adsorption have been developed for hydrogen storage. The drawback of compressed gas storage at a high pressure is the safety while liquid storage of hydrogen requires a low temperature and efficient insulation. Compared to the gas and liquid phase storages of hydrogen, the solidification of hydrogen by adsorption using intermetallic or carbon adsorbents is expected to be a promising method. Intermetallic materials such as LaNi5 can react with hydrogen to form metal hydrides for hydrogen storage [14]. However, the production of these alloys is complex and the materials are heavy and have slow adsorption/desorption rates and a high decomposition temperature. Therefore, it is essential to find novel adsorbent materials that are lightweight and have fast adsorption/desorption rates and a large hydrogen storage capacity. Since Dillon et al. [15] reported a 5–10wt% hydrogen storage capacity in single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), hydrogen storage in various carbon nanomaterials has been widely investigated experimentally and theoretically. This include multi-walled CNTs [16], graphite nanofibers (GNFs, also named CNFs) [17–19], carbon nanohorns [20–22], metal doping carbon nanomaterials [23–25], mechanically milled graphite [26–28], activated carbon [29,30], and porous carbon [31,32]. Among these materials, GNFs are a candidate for hydrogen storage because they exhibit a large amount of open edges and an interlayer spacing between the graphene sheets (≧3.35Å), acting like a slit-shaped pore to become an ideal configuration for hydrogen storage [18]. According to the literature reported [18,19,33–35], GNFs with graphene layers oriented perpendicularly or angularly to the fiber axis are most efficient for the adsorption of hydrogen. Chambers et al. [18] reported that GNFs can store hydrogen up to 67wt% at 300K and 120atm. Park et al. [19] reported that adequate pretreatment of the materials is a critical step in obtaining high storage capacity (up to 40wt%). However, several other laboratories have not been able to duplicate these results [17,36]. Nonetheless, reports on the hydrogen storage capacity of GNFs continue to be published. Storage capacities of GNFs raging from less than 1wt% to up to 15wt% have been reported [37], and numerous factors have been used to describe the variability and inconsistency of these results, including experimental approaches, sample preparation, and processing conditions. The mechanism of hydrogen storage in GNFs and the interaction between the graphene surface and hydrogen are not clear yet. Theoretically, hydrogen can be adsorbed onto the surface and then incorporated/intercalated between the graphene layers or dissociated onto graphite edge sites [33,39]. Browing et al. [33] reported that the graphite edge sites in GNFs may play a role in the dissociation of hydrogen leading to high hydrogen capacity. Recently, Chen and Huang [40] reported that the defect structure of CNTs formed by KOH activation can enhance hydrogen storage capacity (4.47wt%). Danilov et al. [41] also reported that the activation of CNFs with KOH results in a considerable improvement of the electrochemical characteristics of the hydrogen adsorbing electrode. As a result, increasing the defects in GNFs can be an efficient method for increasing hydrogen storage capacity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a new carbon material for hydrogen storage application. The turbostratic CNFs were synthesized in a vertical chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. A graphite exfoliation technique was employed to expand the graphene layers of the as-produced turbostratic CNFs. The hydrogen storage capacity of the turbostratic CNFs before and after exfoliation was investigated. We think that the rough surfaces of the turbostratic CNFs might create the activated sites for hydrogen dissociation and that the expansion of the graphene layers can provide efficient pathways for hydrogen atom intercalation into the graphene layers."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of turbostratic CNFs,"2.1 Synthesis of turbostratic CNFs A vertical CVD apparatus was used for the synthesis of turbostratic CNFs. The reactor was reported previously for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes [42,43]. The apparatus consisted of gas piping, mass flow controllers (Brooks, 5850E), a stainless steel product collector, a three-zone furnace (heating zone=900mm) equipped with a quartz tube (O.D.=75mm), and a syringe pump (KD Scientific, KDS100) for feeding. The materials used for CNF synthesis were a carbon source (alcohol), a catalyst (ferrocene), and a promoter (thiophene). Ferrocene and thiophene (molar ratio Fe/S=1/5) were dissolved in alcohol and loaded into the syringe pump. The CVD experiments started with the passing of nitrogen (100sccm) through the vertical tube when the furnace reached the desired reaction temperature. The reactant solution was then injected (20ml/h) into the vertical furnace reactor from the top while nitrogen (500sccm) and hydrogen (200sccm) were admitted into the reactor at the temperature of 1100°C for 30min. The product was collected in the stainless steel collector mounted at the bottom of the reactor. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled down naturally to room temperature with nitrogen gas purging (500sccm). The morphology and crystal structure of the collected carbon materials were observed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010), respectively. A Raman scattering spectrometer (Raman, RFS 100/S, Nd:YAG laser 1064nm) was employed to analyse the graphitization degree of the turbostratic CNFs. The thermal stability of the turbostratic CNFs was examined by a thermalgravimetry analyzer (TGA, TA instrument TGA 2050). The microporosity of all samples was characterized by nitrogen adsorption using an ASAP 2020 system at 77K. The sample was degassed in a vacuum at 473K for 4h prior to the measurements. The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation [44]."
3,Exfoliation of turbostratic CNFs,"2.2 Exfoliation of turbostratic CNFs The exfoliation method used in this study was based on a well-developed method for graphite exfoliation, in which a concentrated acid intercalant was used in the vaporization process for expanding the graphite along its c-axis [45–47]. The turbostratic CNFs (100mg) were immersed in 50/50 mixtures of sulfuric/nitric acid for 5h at room temperature. After the mixture was filtered, it was transferred to a crucible and placed in the center of the furnace. The furnace was rapidly heated to 800°C (20°C/min) with argon purging (100sccm) for 5min. A high-temperature treatment for removing oxygen-containing functional groups from the CNF samples was employed at 1000°C for 12h in an argon atmosphere. Finally, turbostratic CNFs with an expandable graphitic structure were obtained."
4,Hydrogen storage experiment,"2.3 Hydrogen storage experiment The hydrogen storage capacity was measured using a pressure composition isothermal system (Micromeritics, ASAP 2050 Pressure Sorption Analyzer). The analysis manifold was equipped with a pressure transducer capable of operating from vacuum to 1MPa. In order to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results, the apparatus was checked for leakage, calibrated with an empty manifold and tested using a commercial LaNi5 alloy (given an uptake of 1.4wt%) before the measurements were taken. For all isotherms, cold and warm free space correction measurements were performed using high purity He gas (99.999%). High purity hydrogen (99.999%) was used in this study. For a typical experiment, approximately 100mg of carbon materials was loaded into the manifold and then the samples were degassed by heat treatment at 473K under vacuum for 2h, removing any adsorbed water and gases. The test started with the dosing of hydrogen into the manifold (up to 1MPa) at 77K for interaction with the samples. The volumetric method was used to calculate the hydrogen storage capacity. The amount of hydrogen adsorbed onto the carbon samples is presented in weight percentage (wt%)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and exfoliation of turbostratic CNFs,"3.1 Synthesis and exfoliation of turbostratic CNFs Fig. 1a shows the SEM images of the products after the synthesis. It can be clearly observed that high quality turbostratic CNFs, 90–150nm in diameter and several μm in length, were produced. The high-resolution SEM (HR-SEM) image in Fig. 1b reveals that the surfaces of the turbostratic CNFs were very rough and that the texture was like wrinkled skin which had a large number of pores. This is different from the ACNFs made using activation processes [8,48]. ACNFs are usually fabricated by the physical or chemical activation (KOH and NaOH) of CNFs. ACNFs formed by activation are usually in the form of an amorphous carbon structure, not a graphitic structure. A TEM image (Fig. 1c) shows that the turbostratic CNFs had a solid-core structure and were composed of disordered graphene layers. The disordered graphene layers on the surface created many defects which formed open pore walls. It has been reported that the morphology of CNFs has a direct relationship with the shape of catalysts during the synthesis [49,50]. It is notable that many studies reported that the presence of sulfur-containing gases promotes CNF formation [51,52]. In our study, the sulfur concentration in the reactant solution played an important role in forming the CNFs with a rough surface structure. In order to increase the defects and to expand the interlayer spacing between the graphene layers, we employed a graphite exfoliation technique in a furnace at 800°C. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images and the corresponding TEM images of the turbostratic CNFs before and after exfoliation. Compared to the SEM images, the surfaces of the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs (Fig. 2c) are rougher than those of the as-produced turbostratic CNFs (Fig. 2a). This indicates that some of the turbostratic CNFs were destroyed after the exfoliation process resulting in the creation of pores on the surface. Yoshida et al. [53] reported that the exfoliation of carbon microfibers caused the formation of a nonuniform structure, as evidenced by SEM images. Fig. 2b and d is the corresponding TEM images of Fig. 2a and c, respectively. As can be seen, the as-produced turbostratic CNFs have a solid-core structure (Fig. 2b) while the turbostratic CNFs after exfoliation exhibit a dark and light contrast along the fiber axis (Fig. 2d), which reveals a significant modification of the microstructure. This suggests that the different contrast is a result of the high and low mass density of the graphene layers. In general, the fractional expansion of graphite depends on the graphitic order and crystallite orientation as well as good alignment of the carbon layers [54]. Fig. 3 shows the HR-TEM image of the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs. It can be clearly observed that the graphene layers of turbostratic CNFs were partially expanded, which caused the dark and light contrast in the HR-TEM image. The dark regions were confirmed to be graphene layers. The spacing between the dense graphene layers was in the range of 5–20nm. The light regions were composed of disordered graphene layers and amorphous carbon. Accordingly, we think that the exfoliation process was conducted by the intercalation of concentrated acid into the graphene layers of the CNFs through the defects and pores prior to the thermal treatment. The graphitization degree and thermal stability of the turbostratic CNFs were analyzed by a Raman spectrometer and TGA, respectively. Fig. 4a shows the Raman spectra of the CNF samples. The main peaks at about 1330 and 1590cm−1 corresponded to the D-band and the G-band, respectively. The G-band indicates an ordered graphitic structure while the D-band represents the defects, curved graphite sheets, dislocations, and lattice distortions in carbon structures [55]. The G-band to D-band intensity ratio (I G/I D) of the as-produced turbostratic CNFs was about 0.83, indicating the faulty nature of the long-range ordered crystalline and the existence of a disordered carbon structure. The peak intensity ratio decreased (I G/I D ≈0.75) for the turbostratic CNFs after the exfoliation process, which implies that the sample possessed more defective features than those of the as-produced turbostratic CNFs. The exfoliation process created defects and many open pore walls on the surface of the disordered graphitic structure, which caused the decrease of the I G/I D ratio. Fig. 4b shows the TGA results of the as-produced and exfoliated CNF samples. The weight of the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs decreased dramatically at a temperature of about 500°C, which is lower than that for the as-produced turbostratic CNFs (600°C). As expected, the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs were less thermally stable due to their defect structure which accelerated the accession of oxygen to the graphene layers. The as-produced turbostratic CNFs and exfoliated CNFs were burned off completely at 650 and 600°C, respectively. Fig. 5a shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the as-produced and exfoliated turbostratic CNFs at 77K. In general, the adsorption isotherm at lowest pressure can be assigned to the monolayer coverage of mesopores; the adsorption at medium pressure is mainly contributed to the capillary condensation of N2 in mesopores. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, both samples represent the Type-IV adsorption/desorption isotherm with an H3 hysteresis loop starting from the medium relative pressure (P/P 0 =0.45) and closing near P/P 0 =1, which is the characteristic of flat particle aggregates or slit-shaped pores [56]. For the case of the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs, a larger hysteresis loop is present, which implies that the pore structure was changed from open pore walls to slit-shaped pores after exfoliation process. The results agree well with the SEM and TEM observation. The surface area was obtained using the BET equation; it was found that the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs have a larger specific surface area (226.6m2/g) than that of as-produced turbostratic CNFs (103.06m2/g). In Fig. 5b, the cumulative pore volume suggests the predominance of mesopores. As expected, the total pore volume of the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs was increased. It was also found that the average pore width was decreased due to the creation of micropores during the exfoliation process. The pore characteristics of the CNF samples are summarized in Table 1 ."
7,Hydrogen storage of turbostratic CNFs,"3.2 Hydrogen storage of turbostratic CNFs Hydrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured using a pressure composition isothermal system (ASAP 2050) with a pressure of up to 1MPa at 77K. Most studies carried out experiments at high pressure (usually up to 10MPa) and low temperature (77K) in order to store molecular hydrogen by physisorption. However, under high pressure conditions, the hydrogen uptake can be enhanced but the safety risk rises, especially for transportation applications. The hydrogen storage capacity in an adsorption system is determined by the nature of the adsorption material and the operating conditions of the storage system. Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen storage capacity of the as-produced and exfoliated turbostratic CNFs. The results show that the as-produced turbostratic CNFs possess a 1.5wt% hydrogen storage capacity at a pressure of 1MPa. Some investigations reported that the hydrogen uptake of various carbon nanostructures at 77K is correlated to their specific surface area. Zuttel et al. [57] reported that the theoretical value of potential hydrogen adsorbed was 2.28×10−3 wt% uptake for each square meter of surface area for the adsorption of a monolayer of hydrogen at the surface. This analysis requires a flat graphene sheet and ignores the microporosity contribution. Accordingly, in our study, hydrogen storage capacity was only 0.23wt% when the as-produced turbostratic CNFs surface was covered with an atomic layer. However, surface areas accessible to nitrogen (kinetic diameter is 3.64Å) may not necessarily be accessible to the hydrogen molecule (kinetic diameter is 2.89Å) [33,35,58]. Thus hydrogen uptake does not always correlate to BET surface area, particularly for nanocarbons [33,35]. The difference between 1.5 and 0.23wt% might be considered to be evidence of hydrogen intercalation within the graphene layers. The intercalant must initially find exposed graphene edges, which provide pathways for the intercalant to move inward and fill the space between the basal planes [39]. The hydrogen uptake of exfoliated turbostratic CNFs (about 5wt%, as shown in Fig. 6) was higher than that of as-produced samples. As expected, the capacity of hydrogen storage was improved after exfoliation. Hydrogen uptake of the exfoliated carbon samples was reported in the literatures. Lueking et al. [35] developed the hydrogen storage capacity of 1.2wt% using the exfoliated herringbone GNFs under 20 bar at 77K. Gupta and Srivastava [59] reported that a simple high-pressure exposure was suspected to expand the graphite lattice, leading to a hydrogen storage capacity of 15wt% at 120atm. Poirier et al. [60] reported that exfoliated carbon showed a 2.5 fold increase in hydrogen uptake at 295K after exfoliation, which agree with our study. In addition, the storage capacity of Li-doped exfoliated carbons was measured, which absorbs 3.4wt% hydrogen molecules reversibly [61]. The exfoliation of turbostratic CNFs provided the entry of hydrogen spreading (or dissociation) into the interlayer spacing [62] and increased the surface area and pore volume for storing hydrogen. As listed in Table 1, exfoliated turbostratic CNFs showed a relatively high specific surface area and micropore volume. Panella et al. [38] reported that the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon materials was proportional to their volume of micropores. In this study, we believed that the defect structure of turbostratic CNFs is a key factor to enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity. Based on our results, hydrogen physisorption onto the surface (or pores) and hydrogen dissociative adsorption into the interlayer spacing must be involved. However, further work is needed to clearly identify the actual mechanism of storage in the turbostratic CNFs."
8,Conclusions,"In the study, we demonstrated the continuous synthesis of turbostratic CNFs using a vertical CVD reactor. High purity turbostratic CNFs with a large number of pores can be formed with the presence of Fe/S catalyst at 1100°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Characterizations reveal that the turbostratic CNFs consisted of disordered graphene layers that form open pore walls and defects on the surface. Hydrogen adsorption measured using the volumetric method shows that as-produced turbostratic CNFs possess a 1.5wt% capacity of hydrogen storage with a pressure of up to 1MPa at 77K. Further improvements can be obtained by graphite exfoliation via the intercalation of concentrated acid followed by thermal shock, which increase the specific surface area and micropore volume. A hydrogen uptake of 5wt% was achieved for the exfoliated turbostratic CNFs due to the effect of hydrogen physisorption and hydrogen dissociative adsorption."
