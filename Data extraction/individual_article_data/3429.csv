0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil carbon resources and growing concerns about global warming are factors that raise the need to change radically the way we produce, consume and use natural resources. Among them, lignocellulosic biomass acquires increasing relevance to obtain chemical products, energy compounds and biofuels, being in this case raw materials of the future chemical industry, the so-called biorefineries. There is a wide variety of chemical building blocks obtained from lignocellulosic biomass, being the derived from C6 sugars 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) one of the most promising and versatile platform molecules with significant market potential [1–3]. HMF is a heteroaromatic molecule containing different functional groups, including CO, C–O, CC and the furan ring, which allow several chemical transformations yielding interesting added-value products (see Scheme 1 ). The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond gives rise to the diol 2,5-di-hydroxymethylfuran (DHMF), a six-carbon monomer used in the synthesis of polymers such as polyurethane foams and resins [4]. Moreover, DHMF finds applications as intermediate in drugs synthesis and crown ethers [5]. The main side reaction involved when performing this hydrogenation reaction yields the over-reduction product, 2,5-di-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF), which is also valuable as solvent and building block for the synthesis of polyesters and high-value chemicals such as 1,6-hexanediol [6]. As introduced above, the reduction reaction of HMF into DHMF is a selective hydrogenation reaction of the aldehyde group, where side reactions involving hydrogenation of the furan ring and/or hydrogenolysis of the C–O group must be inhibited. Previous studies on the selective hydrogenation of HMF to DHMF has been mainly performed on noble metal catalysts [7] such as Pd [8,9], Ru [10,11] or Pt [12] under mild conditions. However, the obtained poor selectivity, scarce availability and high price critically hinder the practical applications of these precious metals typically employed. Nonetheless, non-precious metals from the first row transition metals are more abundant and cheaper. Among them, Ni catalysts have great potential for the hydrogenation reaction of HMF. According to literature findings, at relatively low temperatures (T = 60–100 °C), Ni-based catalysts [6,13–16] generally promote the hydrogenation of the furan ring due to the strong CC hydrogenation ability, lowering the selectivity towards DHMF in favor of DHMTHF. The flat adsorption mode of HMF on Ni makes it feasible the activation of both the aldehyde group and the furan ring [4] as with noble metals such as Pd or Pt occurs. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of metal catalysts on hydrogenation reactions of aromatic furfurals can be greatly affected by the type of solvent and the inherent physicochemical properties of the carrier material [17]. The latter may modify the electronic properties of the metal and may also influence on the adsorption behaviour of furanic compounds [2]. The most common support materials employed are metal oxides such as Al2O3 [14,16] and SiO2 [18] as well as carbon-based materials [19,20]. The latter are well known for their excellent chemical and thermal stability along with their versatility as refers to their physicochemical properties. Although reports on this reaction using non-noble metals are increasingly frequent in last years with satisfactory results, most of them have been conducted in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran [21], dioxane [15,16,22], methanol [6,16] or ethanol [23]. Given the production of furanic products from biomass is mainly performed in water media [24,25], the use of this greener solvent is quite relevant. Water is non-toxic, non-flammable, accessible and cheap; hence, its use as solvent renders a catalytic system both competent and more environmentally friendly [26]. Furthermore, carrying out the catalytic reactions in aqueous media proposes a novel challenge to the stability of heterogeneous catalysts that have been traditionally designed to operate in organic solvents or in the gas phase. In the present work, we study the role of diverse carbonaceous supports, with different graphitic and porous structure, in the catalytic properties (intrinsic activity, selectivity) of Ni catalysts applied in the aqueous HMF hydrogenation reaction performed at 60 °C. The catalytic performance of our lab-made Ni/carbon catalysts is compared with those exhibited by Ni supported on a commercial silica and Raney Ni. We also analyze the reasons behind the large differences found in the catalytic behavior among the Ni supported catalysts. Finally, we found that an increase in temperature from 60 to 180 °C conducted to the synthesis of a cyclopentanone derivative through the hydrogenative ring rearrangement of HMF."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis 2.1.1 Supports A series of carbon materials of different nature and physicochemical characteristics were studied as catalysts supports: activated carbon (AC) with a non-graphitizable and highly microporous and turbostratic structure, a high surface area graphite (HSAG) with a highly ordered structure and non-porous open surface morphologies, and two types of commercial carbon nanofibers (CNFs), with different graphitic structure. The commercial AC was produced from olive stones by Oleicola el Tejar, Córdoba (Spain). This raw material was subjected to a treatment with hydrochloric acid solution 10% (v/v) at 100 °C for 24 h, in order to remove residual inorganic components; thereafter it was filtered and washed with distilled water until complete removal of detectable chloride ions. The HSAG (SBET = 396 m2/g) was supplied by TIMREX S.A. The two CNFs, provided by Applied Sciences Inc, were thermally processed at different severity degrees [27]: 3000 °C for PR24-HHT (denoted in this work as HHT) and 700 °C in the case of PR24-PS (labelled PS). For reference purposes, SiO2 provided by Fluka (SBET = 433 m2/g) was also used to support Ni nanoparticles. Prior to the impregnation process, the silica gel was calcined for 2 h at 500 °C. 2.1.2 Ni catalysts Ni catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation technique using a H2O:Ethanol (1:1) solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar), with the adequate concentration to incorporate a metal loading of 10 wt%. After the impregnation, the samples were dried at 100 °C overnight. Previously to the characterization and the catalytic tests, the samples were reduced in a quartz tube under pure hydrogen for 2 h at 450 °C (rate 5 °C/min). Prior to the catalytic tests, the catalyst was protected by water and transferred to the autoclave. Raney Ni (Sigma Aldrich) was also studied for comparison reasons."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The BET surface area of the supports was measured from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K determined on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Before the measurement, the catalysts were outgassed in vacuum at 423 K for 12 h. The Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface areas. The internal and external surface of the AC was determined by applying t-plot method. The average pore diameter (dBJH) was obtained by the BJH method (desorption branch) and the pore volume (V0.95) was determined at P/P0 = 0.95. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the reduced and spent catalysts were carried out in a SDT Q 600 apparatus, under air atmosphere (100 mL/min). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Polycristal X'Pert Pro PANalytical diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu/Kα radiation (λ = 0.1544 nm) operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. For each sample, Bragg's angles between 4° and 90° were scanned at a rate of 0.04°/sec. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts were measured using a JEOL JEM-2100 field-emission gun electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The samples were ground and ultrasonically suspended in ethanol before TEM images were generated. The mean diameter of the Ni particles (dTEM) was calculated, based on a minimum of 400 particles, using the following formula: dTEM = ∑nidi 3/∑nidi 2, being ni the number of particles with a diameter of di. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected with an SPECS GmbH with UHV system, energy analyzer PHOIBOS 150 9MCD under non-monochromatic X-ray source of Al (200 W, 1486.71 eV). Prior to the analysis, each sample was pressed into a small pellet of 10 mm diameter, placed in the sample holder and degassed in the chamber for 24 h to achieve a dynamic vacuum below 10−10 mbar. The spectral data for each sample were analyzed using CASA XPS software. The binding energy (BE) was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The equipment error in the energy determinations is less than 0.01 eV. The resulting spectra were deconvoluted and fitted to a mix of Gaussian and Lorentzian curves. Temperature programed reduction (TPR) was carried out to study the reduction behavior of the catalysts and the interaction between the metal phases and the support. The experiments were performed in a U-shaped quartz reactor under 35 mL/min of a mixture of 5 vol% hydrogen in argon (Air Liquide 99.999% purity). For each TPR experiment, 0.15 g of catalyst was heated from room temperature up to 700 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a stainless steel autoclave (Parr 5524 instruments Co.) with capacity of 150 mL, fitted with a magnetic driven stirrer. For a typical procedure, a certain amount of the reduced catalyst (particle size< 0.25 mm) was suspended in 97.5 mL of distilled water and transferred into the autoclave vessel. The sealed reactor was purged several times with high purity helium to remove air, then H2 was admitted and the autoclave heated up to 60 °C or 180 °C at 5 °C/min. After stabilisation of the temperature, 2.5 mL of aqueous solution of the reactant, (0.04 M), previously introduced in the liquid charging pipette, was dosed into reactor vessel. The low concentration of HMF in water was selected to ensure the solubility of all the possible intermediate and reaction products. Thereafter the reactor vessel was pressurized with 30 bar of H2, which remained constant during the experiment, and the stirring rate was fixed at 1000 rpm. Aliquots of the reactor liquids were collected periodically, filtered and analyzed by gas chromatography in a Varian 3800 equipment, provided with a FID detector and a Supelco SPB-5, Fused Silica Capillary Column, non-polar, with dimensions of 30 m × 0.53 mm (i.d) x 0.5 μm (df). The samples for analysis were prepared by dilution of 500 μL of the reaction products with 500 μL of a 0.01 M methanol solution of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as internal standard. Calibration curves for the observed products were determined by injecting known concentrations of reference commercial products and THF as internal standard. For unidentified furan compounds, FID sensitivity of HMF was used to calculate concentrations. The conversion of HMF (XHMF) was calculated as: X H M F ( % ) = C H M F 0 − C H M F F C H M F 0 · 100 where CHMF0 represents the initial HMF concentration and CHMFF the final molar concentration. The selectivity of each product was calculated as: S i ( % ) = n i C i Σ i n i C i · 100 where C i is molar concentration of the product i and ni the number of carbon atoms of the product i. The catalytic activity (A) at time t was defined as: A ( m i n − 1 ) = X H M F ( % ) 100 · m o l H M F 0 m o l N i · t ( min ) where molHMF0 is the initial feeding of the reactant. The activity was then normalized per mole of surface metal species, to obtain the turn over frequency (TOF). TOF was calculated from initial catalytic activity (t = 0 min) once the rate law for a first-order reaction has been determined. The number of active sites exposed to reactants at the surface of the catalyst was calculated from the dispersion (D) obtained using the average particle size measured from TEM (dTEM). Assuming the spherical shape of particles, the dispersion of Ni is calculated as: D = 1.01/d [28]. All the catalytic tests were replicated at least twice to confirm the reproducibility."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization The H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts and the interaction between metal precursors and the support. Fig. 1 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the Ni/carbon catalysts along with the reference Ni/SiO2. It is important to note that these profiles correspond to the just-impregnated and dried catalysts, not subjected to a previous thermal treatment as calcination. Hence, the reduction of some products derived from the metal precursor decomposition is also included in these profiles. Ni/HSAG exhibits two reduction peaks, the first one sharper at 272 °C and the second one (or broad multiple reduction peak) with a maximum in the range 313–375 °C. The sample Ni/AC exhibits also two reduction peaks; the first one sharper at 265 °C and the second and broad one in the range ∼287–490 °C, with a maximum at 321 °C. These TPR profiles are consistent with others studies carried out in our group for Ni supported on HSAG [29], where the first sharp peak is attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed Ni2+ or NiO particles located where there is a higher concentration of defects and, consequently, the reduction can take place at lower temperature. The second broad peak is assigned to the reduction of remaining bulk Ni species in addition to gasification of carbon atoms near the nickel particles, which catalyze this reaction producing methane. As observed in Fig. 1, Ni/HHT and Ni/PS also exhibit two reduction intervals but are reduced at higher temperatures, which could be due to the presence of large particles that are more difficult to reduce due to absence of interaction with the graphite support. As far as the Ni/SiO2 catalyst is concerned, its corresponding temperature reduction profile displays a clear peak at 323 °C, but also very broad and diffuse multiple reduction peaks at higher temperatures are appreciated. These broad peaks have been observed in other Ni supported catalysts, and are attributed to the presence of mixed NiOx species, resulting of distinct interaction of NiO with the support [21]. Interestingly, when Ni is supported on SiO2, the main reduction temperature is remarkably higher than when supported on HSAG, despite the lower Ni particle size on the former (as will be seen below). This evidences that Ni-support interactions influence on the reduction temperature. Graphitic carbon materials, especially HSAG, promote the reduction of Ni, due to the electron donor nature of the graphitic layers constituents of this support [30]. The graphitic layers are enriched in ᴨ-electrons and would behave as Lewis base donating electrons. The detailed structural parameters of the carbon supports and the corresponding reduced catalysts are listed in Table 1 while the nitrogen adsorption isotherms are presented in Fig. S1. As observed, the adsorption isotherms of both the carbon supports and the resulting Ni/carbon catalysts, are quite similar. The isotherm of AC is type I according to the IUPAC classification, characteristic of microporous materials. However, there is also a slight contribution of type IVa corresponding to mesoporous materials, as the presence of a hysteresis cycle confirms. As for the HSAG, its isotherm shows the characteristic shape of mesoporous materials and is classified as IVa. The isotherms corresponding to HHT and PS are very similar because both supports are carbon nanofibers. Its shape resembles in both cases a Type II isotherm characteristic of non-porous or macroporous samples. As observed in Table 1, the surface area of AC (1025 m2g-1) is much higher than that of the other graphitic supports, but the contribution of mesopores in the surface area is 313 m2g-1. Interestingly, after coating with Ni nanoparticles and reduction at 450 °C, the internal surface diminished from 712 to 440 m2g-1, while the total surface remained. This indicates a loss of microporosity originating more mesopores after Ni loading. This could be due to opening of pores as a consequence of gasification that may occur during the reduction process under H2 at 450 °C. Conversely, the specific surface area of HSAG (396 m2g-1) is comprised mainly of its external surface area, which is characteristic of a material of plate-like particle. The average pore diameter, originated mostly by the interparticle spaces, is 5.7 nm. After incorporation of Ni nanoparticles, the BET surface area drops to 268 m2g-1 and the pore diameter slightly increases, indicating a loss of porosity. Both carbon nanofibers, HHT and PS, exhibit quite similar surface area, while is quite lower in comparison with the other two carbon supports, which may be due the higher level of structuring of these type of carbon nanomaterials. Fig. S2 displays the thermogravimetric profile in air atmosphere of all prepared catalysts after the reduction process at 450 °C. The profiles confirm that the precursor salt is totally decomposed after the reduction process. Furthermore, the remaining residual mass present in all the thermograms after burning away the carbon support corresponds to the nickel oxide. The metallic Ni content was estimated from this value and is summarized in Table 1 for each catalyst, resulting in quite similar results. XRD technique was used to determine the metallic crystalline phases on the supports. Fig. 2 represents the X-ray diffractograms of the Ni catalysts reduced at 450 °C while the corresponding to the supports are depicted in Fig. S3. XRD patterns of supports are represented in increasing order of graphitic nature (HSAG ∼ HHT > PS≫>AC), with the exception of SiO2, which is included as catalyst reference. The main reflections characteristic of graphite structures are detected at 2ϴ = 26.2 and 43.9° for all carbon materials, being the intensity of the peak at 2ϴ∼ 26°, corresponding to the (002) planes of graphene layers, clearly higher in the graphitic supports. As observed in Fig. 2, no changes in the graphitic crystalline structure are detected in any catalyst after the incorporation of the metallic phases. Unfortunately, the XRD analysis of nickel involves some uncertainty for the HSAG, HHT and PS supports since the graphitic broad peak that appears at 2ϴ = 43.9° overlaps the principal distinctive diffraction lines of metallic nickel (44.4°, fcc structure). For these catalysts, the secondary reflection of Ni(0) at 2Ɵ∼ 51.9° is perceptible and its line broadening was used to apply Scherrer equation for the average particle size calculation. The estimated values for each catalyst are collected in Table 1. As observed, Ni/HSAG exhibits a considerable lower Ni particle size than the CNFs, HHT and PS. This could be related to the lower surface areas of the CNFs, which lead to lower metallic dispersions. Also comparing these two latter catalysts, the Ni particles size of HHT is clearly larger than that of Ni/PS. This difference could be due to the higher number of defects on the latter that results in nucleation points, in the same manner than that for Pd nanoparticles [27,31], limiting the particle sintering on PS in comparison with HHT. As for the diffraction pattern of the Ni catalyst over the turbostratic AC, a weak and broad peak at 2ϴ = 37.0° is perceptible to some extent, indicative of the crystalline structure of NiO (JCPDJS 78–0643). The average particle size obtained by Scherrer equation is not collected in Table 1 since it resulted below the detection limit of this technique (d < 4 nm). The presence of oxidized nickel particles could be due to air exposure since small particles are easy to oxidize. Concerning the diffraction pattern of the reference catalyst, Ni/SiO2, the broad and diffuse peak around 2Ɵ∼ 22° corresponds to amorphous SiO2, while the characteristic diffraction peak of Ni(0) at 2ϴ = 44.5° is intuited. However, its line broadening is not narrow enough to apply Scherrer formula (d < 4 nm), which points to a high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles over this catalyst. Fig. 3 shows some representative HRTEM micrographs of the Ni/carbon catalysts, and their corresponding histograms that represent the particle sizes distribution are depicted in Fig. 4 . TEM images and particle size distribution of the reference Ni/SiO2 can be seen in Fig. S4. Average particles sizes were obtained after counting at least 400 particles for each sample and are summarized in Table 1. The results show that, in general, Ni particles are well-distributed throughout the supports without apparent aggregation behavior. TEM images of Ni/AC reveal the homogeneous loading of the Ni nanoparticles onto the carbon support with an average size of 3.9 nm. Ni/AC exhibits the smallest average particle size among all the carbon-supported catalysts, which was expected considering its higher specific surface area. In addition, it displays the narrowest particle size distribution, centered around 3.5 nm (Fig. 4a). As for Ni supported on HSAG, the mean crystallite size determined by TEM (6.3 nm) resulted to be slightly higher than that estimated by XRD. TEM images of Ni/HHT and Ni/PS permit to appreciate the dual wall structure of both CNFs supports. Nevertheless, while in HHT the graphitic domains connect and form large wrinkled graphene layers, PS presents an external wall layer highly disordered that wraps the core fishbone-like structure. As represented in Fig. 4c and d, the particle size distribution is similar and quite wide in both cases, although shifted towards lower sizes in Ni/PS. Certainly, the mean size of Ni/PS resulted to be 10 nm, which is slightly smaller than that of Ni/HHT (12 nm). Note this average particle size is considerably lower than that estimated by Scherrer equation, particularly in the case of Ni/HHT, probably due to an over-contribution of larger particles that, although present, are not representative of the real distribution, as confirmed by TEM images. XPS analysis was conducted to investigate the chemical state and surface composition on the reduced catalyst Ni/HSAG, as a representative carbon-supported catalyst, as well as on the reference Ni/SiO2. The respective XPS survey spectrum (represented in Fig. S5) confirms the presence of mainly Ni, C, and O in Ni/HSAG and Ni, Si and O in the case of Ni/SiO2. The Ni 2p3/2 orbital (Fig. 5 ) in both samples exhibits a broad multicontribution envelope containing the core level peaks and shake-up satellite peaks characteristic of Ni species in oxidation states. No peak ascribed to Ni0 is detected in any sample (BE of Ni0 2p3/2 is assigned at 852.6 eV [32]). In the case of Ni/HSAG, the two peaks are identified at 856.4 and 873.5 eV, corresponding to Ni2+ (2p3/2) and Ni2+ (2p1/2), respectively. In addition, two satellite peaks of Ni2+, which are located at 880.3 and 862.2 eV, are observed. It should be noted that the presence of Ni2+ in the ex-situ reduced samples is presumably attributed to a partial re-oxidation of surface metal Ni species. This is frequently observed when the sample has been exposed to air before XPS analysis [20,33]. A positive shift of 0.7 eV in the Ni2p BE is observed in the Ni/SiO2 sample; the two peaks are identified at 856.4 and 874.2 eV, corresponding to Ni2+ (2p3/2) and Ni2+ (2p1/2), respectively. They are attributed to nickel oxide in agreement with other studies for Ni/SiO2 [34–36]. The higher electron deficiency of nickel in Ni/SiO2 in comparison with Ni/HSAG may be inherent to the smaller Ni particle size of the former, as well as to metal-support interactions due to the higher electron donor nature of the graphitic support in comparison with SiO2. This disparity in the metal's core Ni 2p electrons is expected to cause an impact on the catalytic performance."
7,Catalytic performance in the HMF hydrogenation reaction,"3.2 Catalytic performance in the HMF hydrogenation reaction 3.2.1 Hydrogenation of the carbonyl and furan functionalities. Kinetic aspects Reaction conditions were chosen to avoid mass transfer limitations. The stirring speed and particle tests were conducted for the Ni/HSAG catalyst (Fig. S6) to verify the absence of mass-transfer resistance of the reactants from the gas to the liquid phase (H2 in our case), from the bulk liquid to the catalyst surface (HMF and H2) and internal diffusion resistance. Furthermore, the stoichiometric ratio of H2 to HMF is above 50 (at 30 bar and 60 °C [H2]≈ 0.486 cm3/g [37]). In order to guaranty H2 excess during the course of the reaction, hydrogen was continuously supplied to preserve the pressure constant at 30 bar. As reported in the experimental section, a low concentration of HMF was used (0.01 M) in order to minimize water solubility problems of the intermediates and reaction products. With the aim to explore the carbon supports effect on activity and products distributions, Ni was dispersed on various carbon supports and compared with a Ni supported on commercial silica. Ni Raney was also tested as reference as well. Prior to the catalytic tests, the absence of reaction without catalyst (blank test) and employing the supports was verified. The products distributions obtained with the studied Ni catalysts are represented in Fig. 6 . The selectivities values are obtained at isoconversion (85 ± 5%) except for Ni/PS, for which the maximum achieved conversion was 6.1% after 6 h of reaction time. In general, the hydrogenation of HMF in aqueous media at 60 °C under 30 bar H2 gave placed a mixture of DHMF and DHMTHF along with trace amounts of 5-MF and the unknown product over all the series of Ni supported catalysts (Fig. 6). However, the relative proportion of each product is clearly different depending on the support, confirming its key role on the hydrogenation reaction of HMF. The hydrogenation of the carbonyl group yields DHMF, which is then further reduced to the saturated DHMTHF (detected as a mixture of cis and trans isomers) via hydrogenation of the furan ring. It has been reported the bond energy of CO and CC are 715 and 615 kJ/mol, respectively, so the hydrogenation of CC is more feasible from a thermodynamic point of view. However, the presence of the conjugated furan ring makes the hydrogenation of the CO bond relatively easier than the CC bonds. DHMF was detected along with the corresponding over-hydrogenated product, DHMTHF over all the Ni/carbon catalysts, with the exception of Ni/PS. As observed in Fig. 7 , the selectivity of both, DHMF and the unknown product, follows the expected time-dependence for reaction intermediates. At the same time, the selectivity towards DHMTHF increases as the reaction proceeds, especially at higher conversion levels (>80%). Bearing this in mind, along with the reaction network depicted in Scheme 1, the unidentified product may be 2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (HMTHF, detected as a mixture of cis and trans isomers), as it would be consumed with time to give DHMTHF as well. Some previous studies have also reported the presence of this hydrogenation product when the hydrogenation reaction of HMF was performed over palladium-based catalysts in water [18,38]. As for the relative amount of 5-MF, the hydrogenolysis product, it persists very low (below 5%) at all conversion levels. An overview of the product distribution represented in Fig. 6 highlights that carbonaceous materials tend to inhibit the capacity of Ni for the hydrogenation of the furan ring to a greater extent than when Ni/SiO2 or Raney Ni are used. To our knowledge, this effect triggered by carbon supports on Ni catalysts’ selectivity is the first time reported for this reaction. Over the non-carbon supported catalysts, Ni/SiO2 and Raney Ni, a higher proportion of the ring-saturated DHMTHF product is found regardless the conversion level (selectivity values to DHMTHF maintained within the range 60–90%). This confirm the strong CC hydrogenation ability of Ni, which is detrimental to DHMF synthesis, usually reported in literature [6,15,22]. Selectivity variations over our Ni/carbon catalysts in comparison with the Ni references, may be interpreted by means of differences in the electron density of the Ni active sites as XPS analysis suggested. The pathway followed during the HMF reductive transformation (DHMF/DHMTHF) has been reported to be dependent on the nature of the metal because it determines the adsorption mode of the furanic compound [2]. As theorical calculations suggest [39,40], over Ni, as well as Pt or Pd, the furan ring tend to a flat adsorption mode because of the strong interaction between the metal and the π bonds in the molecule, leading to the hydrogenation of both CO and CC functionalities. However, it has been reported that to produce DHMF selectively, weaker interactions between the furan ring and the surface of active metal species is desired, as with Cu catalysts occur [39,40]. According to our XPS study, Ni would become more electron rich when supported over carbon than over SiO2. Consequently, this higher electron density may cause the preferential vertical adsorption mode, explaining this unexpected selectivity to the carbonyl hydrogenation product over Ni/C catalysts. Among the series of carbon materials, moderate changes in product distribution are detected as well. The selectivity towards the partial hydrogenated product DHMF is 70% and 77% over Ni/AC and Ni/HSAG, respectively. However, even a higher proportion of DHMF was identified in the reaction mixture when Ni was supported on the carbon nanofibers, Ni/HHT and Ni/PS, achieving a DHMF selectivity of 88% and 98%, respectively. These slight differences in the products distributions among our carbon-supported catalysts may be ascribed to different physicochemical and particle size effects. It has been reported that large Ni particles favor the selective hydrogenation of HMF into DHMF [20]. Indeed, the higher the average particle size, the greater the selectivity towards the partial hydrogenation product (Ni/HHT > Ni/HSAG > Ni/AC), with the exception of Ni/PS, which will be discussed below. The effect of particle size has been widely documented for the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. For example, Pt larger particles favor the hydrogenation of the CO group against that of the CC bond, forming crotyl alcohol from crotonaldehyde. This was explained by the increased proportion of close-packed Pt (111) surfaces and the preferential adsorption mode of crotonaldehyde on this facet via a di-σ-CO bond [41]. Fig. 6 also collects the catalytic activity per gram of Ni per minute, obtained after 15 min. Conversion vs time profiles are represented in Fig. S7. As observed, HMF was practically consumed after 45 min of reaction time over Ni/HSAG. Catalytic activity per mol of Ni of Ni/SiO2 (20.2 min−1) was in the range of those of Ni/AC (14.6 min−1) and Ni/HSAG (19.0 min−1). However, the catalytic activity was 4.0 min−1 and 0.22 min−1 over Ni/HHT and Ni/PS, respectively, being the lowest values obtained among the Ni-supported catalysts. This can be explained bearing in mind the higher Ni particle sizes on these catalysts, which means a lower quantity of exposed active sites. The slightly greater catalytic activity per mol of Ni obtained with Ni/HSAG in comparison with Ni/AC, despite the higher Ni particle size in the former, could be due to internal diffusional limitations. It should be noted that the analysis of textural properties (Table 1) and the particle size distribution determined by TEM (Fig. 4a) suggested that the smallest Ni nanoparticles could be occupying part of the smallest mesoporous of AC. Nonetheless, in order to track intrinsic changes in Ni reactivity, normalized catalytic activity was calculated as TOF, obtained from the initial catalytic activity at t = 0 min, which was calculated after the kinetic constant determination. These results are collected in Table 2 . The apparent rate constant, k, was obtained from the linear correlation between Ln (Ct/C0) and reaction time (Fig. S8), suggesting that HMF hydrogenation reaction is pseudo-first-order reaction, in agreement with previous studies [14]. When intrinsic catalytic activity is normalized taking into account the particle size, noticeable changes were detected among our series of carbon-catalysts. TOF over Ni/PS is considerably lower than that of Ni/HHT. This may be due to the effect of the presence of surface sulfur on the PS CNFs, which could inhibit the catalytic activity of Ni to dissociate H2 as we exposed in a former work for Pd/CNFs [27], resulting in a catalyst much less active than its Ni/HHT counterpart. The TOF value calculated for Ni/HSAG is much higher than that obtained over Ni/HHT. This was expected as the HMF hydrogenation towards DHMF reaction has been reported to be structure-sensitive: lower particle sizes are intrinsically more active because of the preferential adsorption of the aldehyde function [42]. Nonetheless, the opposite effect of particle size on reaction rate has been described for Ni [14]. The initial TOF achieved with the catalyst exhibiting the lowest particle size, Ni/AC, is lower than that calculated for Ni/HSAG, and may be due to internal mass transfer limitations, as discussed before. Given that Ni/HSAG is the catyst providing the highest catalytic activity and selectivity towards DHMF (77%), further catalytic tests were conducted using this catalyst. 3.2.2 Influence of the catalyst amount (HMF/Ni ratio) Fig. 8 shows the influence of the Ni/HSAG catalyst amount (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 g) on the hydrogenation reaction performance. Under the given conditions (60 °C, 30 bar), 0,15 g of Ni/HSAG catalyst (HMF/Ni molar ratio = 4) converts 91% of HMF after 30 min, while the HMF conversion achieved with 0.05 g (HMF/Ni molar ratio = 12) is 40% after the same reaction time. Concerning product distribution, decreasing the catalyst amount from 0.15 to 0.05 g diminished the selectivity towards DHMTHF from 14% to 4% at maximum HMF conversion. Additionally, side reactions such as hydrodeoxygenation reaction (yielding 5-MF) are favored as the catalyst amount increased, making the selectivity towards the target product DHMF decrease. Hence, diminishing the catalyst amount enhances the selectivity towards DHMF. This effect of the catalyst's amount on the diols' distribution is in good agreement with previous reported data [19]. With 0.05 g of Ni/HSAG almost full conversion of HMF (96%) is achieved after 5h with a 90% of selectivity towards DHMF. Therefore, 0.05 g of catalyst amount (HMF/Ni molar ratio = 12) is employed in the following hydrogenation reactions and tests for recyclability. 3.2.3 Stability tests The catalyst recycling was investigated by performing 3 consecutive runs. After each run, the catalyst was recovered, washed with deionized water and dried at 100 °C overnight. Thereafter it was reduced at the same conditions as the freshly synthesized catalyst. To track the slight changes in catalyst activity over time, a conversion below 100% (90%, after 2h) of HMF was chosen to evaluate the stability. As shown in Fig. 9 , the catalyst showed similar hydrogenation activity in the second run but a mild drop in conversion (ca 10%) occurred after three cycles. In addition, a slight descent in DHMTHF selectivity (from 6 to 4%) in favor of the partial hydrogenation product DHMF occurred after three consecutive runs. It should be mentioned that in the third catalytic cycle, full HMF conversion is not achieved even after 5 h of reaction time (conversion was maintained close to 83% from the 4th hour). In order to investigate the possible reasons behind the soft catalyst deactivation, we performed characterization of the catalyst after reaction by XRD, and the diffractograms are represented in Fig. S9. The measured XRD spectrum of the spent catalyst shows comparable intensity reflections with the fresh catalyst, indicating no change in the mean crystallite size, which suggests sintering is not the cause for the reduced activity displayed by the recycled catalyst. Furthermore, the standard leaching test (stopping the reaction after 1h, catalyst filtered off from the reaction mixture, progressing filtrate for another 1h) also revealed no change in the HMF concentration after catalyst removal. This indicates that Ni did not leach into the liquid phase, which has been reported as a common cause of catalyst deactivation when this reaction is performed in water [18]. According to literature findings, catalyst deactivation in this reaction is often due to fouling, caused by organic species adsorbed during the reaction and polymerized on the catalyst surface [14]. The TGA in air of the spent catalyst (Fig. S10) confirmed that this was the cause of the slight activity loss, due to the presence of coke. Nonetheless, Ni/HSAG resulted to be much more stable than other Ni reported catalysts in the HMF hydrogenation reaction performed in aqueous medium [14]. 3.2.4 Comparison with other reported Ni-based catalysts for the CO/CC hydrogenation of HMF Table 3 presents some catalytic parameters obtained with other Ni-based catalysts applied in the HMF hydrogenation, reported in the literature. In agreement with literature reports [6,23], Raney Ni was less active than our supported Ni catalysts (with the exception of Ni/PS). Literature findings indicate Ni Raney is highly selective towards the full hydrogenated DHMTHF derivative when the HMF hydrogenation is conducted in organic solvents [6,15,16,23]. However, when we performed the reaction in aqueous media the selectivity achieved was only 68%. Hence, the solvent plays a critical role in the product distribution from HMF. Liu et al. [47] found that the addition of 5 wt% water to the reaction media (THF) drastically altered the reaction rates and product distribution from HMF hydrogenation reaction over a Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. While at 175 °C HMF was mainly converted in the hydrogenolysis products 2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylfuran (MFA) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in pure THF solvent, the presence of water inhibited the HMF hydrogenolysis and led to the selective synthesis of the partially hydrogenated product, DHMF. They attributed this effect to the inhibition of the active sites on Cu/Al2O3 by adsorption of water. Surprisingly, there are only a few published works reporting the use of Ni-based catalyst in water. Our Ni/HSAG is the Ni-based catalyst most selective to DHMF reported to date. 3.2.5 Rearrangement of the furan ring When HMF is hydrogenated at elevated temperatures (typically higher than 140 °C) in aqueous media, the rearrangement of the furan ring may occur. In a similar fashion, ring rearrangement of furfural towards cyclopentanone has been recently contemplated as an innovative transformation of biomass derived materials to valuable chemicals [23,48–51], especially over platinum group metals, exhibiting carbon supported Pt the highest yield of cyclopentanone [48,50]. The ring rearrangement of HMF gives rise to 3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone (HCPN), which is also an important chemical intermediate for the production of medicines, insecticides and rubber chemicals. Despite the attractiveness of this HMF valorization route, the literature reporting this reaction to date is scarce. It is said that HMF rearrangement requires more severe conditions, such as complex acidic catalysts catalytic systems and extended reaction times [52]. Synthesis of HCPN from HMF has been described over Au [53], Pd [54], Ni-based catalysts [14,55] and Cu [55], with selectivities ca 70–90%. The HMF hydrogenation reaction performed over Ni/HSAG at 180 °C showed a shift of the selectivity towards the ring rearrangement yielding HCPN (Scheme 2 ). A similar reaction mechanism for furfural transformation into cyclopentanone [48] has been proposed for the ring rearrangement of HMF. First, HMF is reduced to DHMF. The subsequent conversion of DHMF may proceed through hydrogenation of the furan ring (DHMTHF, see Scheme 1) or rehydration followed by the ring opening and hydrogenation yields HHD. Subsequently, HHD may undergo intramolecular aldol condensation followed by hydrogenation, producing HCPN (Scheme 2) [14,48,53,55]. The temporal dependence of conversion and selectivity for the hydrogenation of HMF (180 °C, 30 bar) over Ni/HSAG is shown in Fig. 10 . The kinetic curve shows a progressive consumption of HMF (conversion is 98% after 3 h) yielding DHMF as the first intermediate, which is rapidly converted into products. The presence of certain unidentified product (labelled unknown 2) is observed. This unknown product follows the expected time-dependence for reaction intermediates: its selectivity increases with time at the beginning (0–15 min) and then it is consumed as the reaction proceeds to form HCPN. For this reason, unknown 2 is supposed to be 1-hydroxyl-2,5-hexanedione (HHD, not commercially available, Scheme 2). This time course of the selectivities is consistent with those reported in literature [53,55]. The selectivity to the target product HCPN is 87% after 3h of reaction time. Our results obtained with our Ni/HSAG catalyst prove that the rearrangement of the furan ring of HMF is feasible without the presence of an acidic support."
8,Conclusions,"The selective hydrogenation reaction of HMF has been ascribed to the synergistic actions of Ni and the support. When working at 60 °C under 30 bar H2 in water, the carbonyl hydrogenated compound DHMF was the major product over Ni/C catalysts. However, the hydrogenation of the furan ring of DHMF towards DHMTHF became predominant over Ni/SiO2 and Raney Ni. Hence, Ni supported on silica and Raney Ni are active catalysts for both the aldehyde group and furan ring hydrogenation reactions as literature findings confirmed. Conversely, we have shown that carbon supports inhibit in some degree the reactivity of Ni towards CC hydrogenation, showing higher selectivity to CO hydrogenation, without limiting the inherent activity of Ni. This has been rationalized in terms of electronic effects occurring at the metal-support interface as the XPS analysis suggested, which may have an impact on the adsorption mode of the HMF molecule on the catalyst's surface. Furthermore, noticeable changes in the catalytic performance among our Ni/carbon catalysts were also found, which were ascribed to the particular physicochemical properties of the specific carbon support. These variations have been explained by means of: (i) internal mass transfer limitations (Ni/AC), which diminished the calculated inherent Ni catalytic activity; (ii) higher Ni particle size (Ni/HHT and Ni/PS), which further increased the selectivity towards the partial hydrogenation product and diminished the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni; and (iii) surface sulfur impurities (Ni/PS), which had a detrimental impact in both activity and selectivity towards CC hydrogenation. All in all, 0.05 g of Ni/HSAG (HMF/Ni molar ratio = 12) can efficiently catalyze the selective conversion of HMF into the partial hydrogenation product DHMF with a 90% selectivity, at 60 °C under 30 bar H2 in water. An increase of reaction temperature up to 180 °C favored the synthesis of the HCPN (87% selectivity), through the hydrogenative rearrangement of the furan ring. This work also highlights the importance of metal-support interactions in modulating CO/CC hydrogenation reactions. In summary, by selecting the adequate support, our results demonstrate the feasibility of Ni catalysts for selective hydrogenation of CO/CC bonds, which have valuable prospective for biomass valorization."
