0,Introduction,"As fossil feedstocks as well as the crude oil reserve are decreasing rapidly, the search for alternative pathways for the production of fine chemicals and fuels has become inevitably significant [1]. Alcohols are inexpensive precursors and easily accessible by conversion of biomass or fermentation process [2,3]. Hence, development of efficient and sustainable methodologies for the transformation of alcohols to fine chemicals is highly desirable. Among various nitrogen containing heteroaromatics, quinolines, acridines and naphthyridines have substantial importance, owing to their higher abundance in various natural products and pharmacologically important drugs [4–6]. Commonly quinoline and naphthyridine scaffolds were synthesized following the Friedländer synthesis, but owing to its high susceptibility towards self-condensation, later on several metal/base catalyzed oxidative cyclization reactions were developed using 2-aminobenzyl alcohol [7–10]. However, most of these procedures required either large excess of ketones/alcohols or sacrificial hydrogen acceptors [11–14]. In recent years, transition metal catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative condensation approach has received much attention for environmentally benign CN bond formation reactions [15–20]. Following this protocol, Milstein, Beller, Kempe and others reported formation of various N-heterocyclic compounds [21–24]. Similar transformations using the dehydrogenative aldol condensation strategy were also well known in literature for the sustainable CC bond formation [25–32]. The catalytic synthesis of quinolines and naphthyridines via cyclization of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol with either ketones or alcohols was achieved using Ru, Ir, Pd and other metals [23,33–36]. Notably, most of these methodologies inevitably required organic solvents. Although, organic solvents have many advantages, they are toxic, flammable and relatively expensive [37]. On the other hand, water as a solvent has many potential benefits over organic solvents as it is environmentally friendly, safe, cheap, and easy to separate from organic products. In the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in utilization of water as a solvent [38]. For that purpose numerous water soluble metal complexes were synthesized and their catalytic activity explored [39–43]. Lately, based on the alcohol dehydrogenation strategy, CC and CN bond formation reactions in water were reported by Williams, Fujita, Yamaguchi, Li, and others [44–55]. For the synthesis of nitrogen containing heteroaromatics, the coupling reaction of 2-aminoaryl alcohol with sustainable and readily available alcohols following the double dehydrogenation strategy is challenging in aqueous medium and to the best of our knowledge has not yet been reported. For the designing of an efficient catalytic system, metal-ligand cooperativity emerged as a powerful tool which received much attention in last few decades [56–58]. In this regard, 2-hydroxypyridine containing ligands represent an important class of cooperative ligands. Various transition metal complexes bearing 2-hydroxypyridine fragment containing ligands were synthesized and successfully explored in several transformations such as transfer hydrogenation, CO2 hydrogenation, dehydrogenation of alcohols, dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of heterocycles, water oxidation, etc. [41,59–63]. Herein, we report the synthesis and catalytic activity of a new phosphine-free water soluble Ir-complex bearing 2-(2-benzimidazolyl)-6-hydroxypyridine ligand. Remarkably, a variety of quinolines, acridines and naphthyridines were synthesized in water under air utilizing this Ir-complex (Scheme 1 ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for oxidative cyclization of 2-aminoaryl alcohols or 2-nitroaryl alcohols with alcohols in water."
1,Results and discussion,"Inspired by the high catalytic activities of bidentate N-containing Ir-complexes [40,41,64], several substituted 2-(2-benzimidazolyl) pyridine ligand containing Ir(III) complexes were synthesized in good yields and complex 1 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ). The catalytic activity of the newly synthesized complexes was investigated for the dehydrogenative coupling between 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol in water (Table 1 ). Preliminary results showed that the reaction was facilitated in air compared to argon (Table 1, entry 2) [65]. Several Ir-catalysts were screened and among them cat. 1 displayed superior activity (Table 1). Notably, cat. 1 and cat. 6 containing the easily deprotonated hydroxyl-pyridine group, showed significantly higher reactivity compared to their OMe (cat. 2 and 7) and Me (cat. 3 and 8) analogue respectively. Optimization of catalyst amount, base and amino alcohol/alcohol ratio suggested that 1.5 mol% of catalyst 1 was sufficient to achieve the 97% yield of 2-phenylquinoline (2a) within 24 h in presence of 1.5 equiv. of KOH (Table 1, entries 3–19). In contrast, using acetophenone, this catalytic system delivered quantitative yield of 2a within 6 h (Table 1, entry 22) [13]. This result demonstrated that, compared to ketones, the dehydrogenative coupling of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol was more challenging with easily accessible alcohols. Using the optimized reaction conditions, this protocol was applied for the coupling of various secondary alcohols with 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Different substituted secondary alcohols bearing both electron donating and withdrawing groups in para and meta position afforded good to excellent yields (78–98%) of quinoline derivatives (2a-2g). Substitution in the ortho position of secondary alcohol delivered poor yield and considerable amount of dehalogenated quinoline was observed as by-product (2h). Moreover, 1-(2-naphthalenyl)ethanol and heteroatom substituted alcohols were converted successfully (77–92%) under the reaction conditions (2i-2k). Acyclic aliphatic alcohols also reacted well and delivered the desired products (2l-2n). The scope of the reaction was further explored towards the coupling of substituted 2-aminobenzyl alcohols with various alcohols (Table 3 ). Reaction of electron withdrawing as well as electron donating group substituted 2-aminobenzyl alcohols afforded the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (3a-3g). Notably, naphthyl substituted 2-aminobenzyl alcohol also delivered good yield (3h). In the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reaction using alcohols, the liberated hydrogen could be used in transfer hydrogenation of nitro functionality in situ without using any external reducing agents [66,67]. As 2-aminoaryl alcohols can be easily accessed from 2-nitroaryl alcohols, we were interested to explore this strategy for the synthesis of quinolines directly from 2-nitroaryl alcohols. Using this protocol various substituted aryl alcohols, heteronuclei containing alcohols and aliphatic alcohols furnished the desired products in good to excellent yields ((Table 4 ; 4a-4g; 74–94%). Acridine derivatives are highly important N-heterocyclic moiety which has potential applications as antiparasitic drugs [5,68]. Owing to the widespread applicability of the acridine derivatives, we were fascinated to synthesize them by using the dehydrogenative condensation strategy. Several fused quinolines and acridines were smoothly synthesized from 2-aminobenzyl alcohols and cyclic alcohols employing the standard reaction conditions (Table 5 ; 5a-5h). Interestingly, with decreasing ring size of the cyclic alcohols, the yield of fused quinoline derivatives increases (5a-5c) [5]. 1,8-Naphthyridine derivatives have significant importance in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Inspired by their multidirectional biological properties we next explored viable synthesis of 1,8-naphthyridines in water. Notably, this protocol efficiently delivered a variety of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives (Table 6 , 6a–6g). Notably, 1-(2-pyridinyl) ethanol with strong chelation site and also heteroatom containing 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) ethanol were efficiently converted to the expected products (6d-6e). Additionally, aliphatic cyclic and acyclic alcohols like cyclopentanol and 1-phenyl-1-propanol were found to be efficient coupling partners for the synthesis of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives (Table 6, entries 6f-6g)."
2,Practical applicability of the methodology,"Next, we checked the reusability of this catalytic system for the synthesis of 2-phenylquinoline in water by simple phase separation technique. The recovered aqueous solution containing the catalyst could be utilized for the synthesis of 2-phenylquinoline up to the fourth run although yields reduced significantly after the second run (Table S2). To demonstrate the synthetic applicability of this methodology, biologically active natural product (±)-galipinine was synthesized [69,70]. Following the optimized conditions, 2l was smoothly prepared from 2-aminobenzyl alcohol. Applying the same catalytic system, hydrogenation of 2l in water followed by methylation using HCHO yielded (±)-galipinine (2lb) in excellent yield (Scheme 2 ). This protocol was extended towards the gram scale synthesis of a variety of quinolines, acridines and naphthyridines in water under air (Table 7 ). The green chemistry metrics [71] for the synthesis of 2-(2-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethyl)quinoline (2l) was estimated on a preparative scale with an E factor of 2.1, 87% atom economy, 94% atom efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency, and 55% reaction mass efficiency (Table 8 ), which provides a clear overview of technical and environmental benefits and also indicates that this methodology is highly sustainable."
3,Mechanistic insights,"To understand the mechanism of this dehydrogenative coupling reaction, several kinetic experiments and theoretical calculations were carried out. The progress of the catalytic cyclization of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol was monitored by GC-analysis. From the plot it is evident that several intermediates were involved in the course of the reaction (Fig. 2 ). Also it is noteworthy that the concentration of in situ generated 2-aminobenzaldehyde is much smaller than acetophenone, thus retarding the self-condensation of 2-aminobenzaldehyde. Synthesis of 2a from 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and acetophenone in presence of cat. 1 required only 4 h, while in absence of cat. 1, from 2-amino benzaldehyde and acetophenone it took only 30 min (Scheme 3 A–B). Additionally, formation of quinoline was not detected from both coupling of alcohol-alcohol or alcohol-ketone in the absence of cat. 1 (Scheme 3C–D). These results suggested that cat. 1 facilitated the dehydrogenation of the alcohols, and 2-amino benzaldehyde and acetophenone were intermediates in this process. As Ir-H species is considered as one of the intermediates in this catalytic cycle [48], we independently synthesized the corresponding Ir-H species by treating cat. 1 with 10 equiv. of KO t Bu in i PrOH at 82 °C for 1 h (Scheme 3E). A sharp singlet at δ = −11.97 ppm in 1H NMR spectra confirmed the formation of Ir-H species [40]. This complex under the standard reaction conditions yielded 81% of 2a (Scheme 3F), which suggested that the proposed Ir-H complex was the active intermediate in this reaction. To understand the reaction mechanism more clearly, DFT calculations for the dehydrogenation of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol were performed (Fig. 3 ). In the DFT study we focused on two major steps: (a) dehydrogenation of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and (b) ligand assisted hydrogen liberation. Initially, in presence of base the precatalyst 1 would be converted to species I1 having pyridonate ligand fragment [41,72]. Now, I1 could follow two pathways for the alcohol dehydrogenation (i) outer sphere pathway or (ii) inner sphere pathway (I2) [73]. In the concerted outer sphere pathway, 2-aminobenzyl alcohol was dehydrogenated through an eight membered transition state TS1out (ΔGǂ = 18.5 kcal/mol) where the hydroxyl hydrogen of the 2-aminobenzyl alcohol was transferred to the pyridonate oxygen and CH was transferred to the Ir center, resulting in the formation of Ir-H intermediate I3 [74,75]. However, for the dehydrogenation of alcohol the stepwise outer-sphere pathway could not be ruled out [76]. Afterwards, hydrogen molecule was eliminated from the metal hydride and ligand pendent hydroxyl proton with an activation barrier of 30.3 kcal/mol, generating the active species (I1) [41]. On the other hand, in the inner sphere route, first the metal-alkoxy complex (I2) was generated from I1. Afterward, this alkoxy-complex underwent β-hydride elimination through a four-membered transition-state (TS1in ) with an activation barrier of 48.6 kcal/mol and formed Ir-H species I3 [74]. Finally, hydrogen elimination from I3 regenerated the active species I1. Catalyst 2–4 may follow inner sphere pathway for the dehydrogenation of alcohol, as there is no hydroxyl group present in the ligand. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol via the concerted pathway was much lower (ΔGǂ = 21.7 kcal/mol) compared to the inner sphere route (ΔGǂ = 48.6 kcal/mol). This clearly indicates that the outer sphere pathway is more favoured over the inner sphere route (Fig. 2 and SI, Fig. S3)."
4,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a new class of water soluble Ir-complexes was synthesized and characterized. Among them 2-hydroxypyridine based cat. 1 presented excellent catalytic activity and offered a greener methodology for the synthesis of quinoline, 1,8-naphthyridine and acridine derivatives from 2-aminoaryl alcohols and substituted secondary alcohols in water under air. Interestingly, combination of transfer hydrogenation and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling was demonstrated in a single process for synthesis of quinolines starting from 2-nitrobenzyl alcohols. This sustainable protocol was successfully applied for the synthesis of biologically active natural product (±)-galipinine and gram scale synthesis of important N-heterocycles. The green chemistry metrics were evaluated for the synthesis of 2-(2-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethyl)quinoline, which showed the technical benefits and sustainability of the present methodology. The proposed reaction mechanism was supported by several control experiments, kinetic studies and DFT calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example for the synthesis of quinolines, acridines and 1,8-naphthyridines in water using 2-aminobenzyl alcohol and substituted secondary alcohols."
