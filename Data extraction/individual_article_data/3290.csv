0,Introduction,"Energy demand in developing countries rises by about 65 percent from 2010 to 2040 [1]. There is an increasing interest in higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) in both academic and industry, largely as the result of the depletion of fossil energy reverser, fluctuations in oil price, environmental concerns and demand for clean transportation [2,3]. A solution that potentially addresses these issues could be an increased use of higher alcohols in the transportation sector. Alcohols have high oxygen to carbon molar ratio and octane number, so this fact makes alcohol as a gasoline octane enhancer and replacement [4,5]. In recent three decades, several catalysts have been used to synthesize alcohol from syngas [6–12]. The most used heterogeneous catalysts categories for higher alcohols synthesis are noble metal-based catalysts due to their high ethanol selectivity in syngas conversion. However, limited availability and high cost are the most challenge for noble metal-based catalysts in commercial application [13]. The other most attractive catalyst's category is a molybdenum-based catalyst due to its excellent resistance to sulfur and reducing feed gas desulfurization cost. Several molybdenum-based catalytic systems have been investigated for higher alcohols synthesis, such as molybdenum sulfide catalysts, molybdenum oxide catalysts and molybdenum carbide catalysts [14–19]. MoS2-based catalysts exhibit good activity and selectivity to higher alcohols, but traces of organic sulfur can be entered to alcohol product which is undesirable for product applications [14,20]. Molybdenum carbides are known as materials with high hardness, high melting point, and good thermal stability highly active for water-gas shift reactions, so promised catalysts with platinum-like behaviors [21–23]. For several catalytic systems developed for alcohol synthesis, alkali-promoted molybdenum carbide catalysts are more attractive because of their similarity to noble metals such as platinum [24,25]. Promotion of molybdenum carbide by alkali particularly potassium has been found to greatly enhance the selectivity to alcohols [20]. For K/β-Mo2C catalyst, cobalt showed the ability of promoting the carbon chain growth [26]. In the present work, the influences of Mo/Co and K/Co molar ratios of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-supported Co-Mo-K carbide-based catalyst in higher alcohols synthesis from syngas were assessed. The catalysts were characterized by ICP, BET, TEM, TPR, XRD, XPS and the catalysts performances for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) were investigated in a fixed-bed micro-reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,CNTs synthesis,"2.1 CNTs synthesis CNTs was synthesized through methane decomposition at 900 °C over cobalt-molybdenum nanoparticles supported on nanoporous magnesium oxide (Co-Mo/MgO) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The reaction of methane decomposition was conducted at atmospheric pressure with a holding time of 30 min. The fresh CNTs often contained impurities, such as amorphous carbon, catalyst metals and fullerene or graphite particles. Thus these impurities in CNTs are one of the factors preventing the access to its significant features and need to be eliminated before the experiments. The purification procedure was done as follows: the pristine CNTs sample was added into an 18% HCl solution and mixed for about 16 h at ambient temperature. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed several times with distilled water until the pH value of the filtrate was neutral. In order to achieve to extra-purification, the prepared materials were dispersed in 6 mol/L nitric acid for 3 h at 70 °C. After that, the washing step was repeated as mentioned above for the HNO3 treatment process. Nitric acid treatment disassembled the nanotubes aggregates effectively [27]. The resulting cake was dried at 120 °C for 8 h, and in order to eliminate the amorphous carbons, the temperature was increased to 400 °C in air with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for 20 min. The purity of the CNTs was about 95%, with their diameters and lengths ranging between 10–20 nm and 5–15 μm, respectively."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation On the unpromoted Co-Mo catalyst, the conversion of CO toward alcohol was very low, and the predominant products were hydrocarbons. When the potassium was incorporated, the hydrocarbons products were suppressed to some extent and alcohol formation was enhanced. Therefore, unprompted catalysts with variable Mo/Co molar ratio of 1, 1.25, 1.66 and 4 were prepared through impregnation method. A typical procedure was as follows: the cobalt nitrate hexa hydrate (Merck, >99%) aqueous solution was placed in a 100 mL reaction vessel and CNTs were added as a support. Then appropriate amount of ammonium heptamolybdate tetra hydrate (Merck, >99%) was added dropwise to the above mention solution. The reaction was performed at 80 °C for 1 h with vigorous stirring. The pH value was kept constant of 5 by the addition of ammonia and nitric acid solution. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered and the precipitate was dried in air at 210 °C for 2 h, calcined at 500 °C for 4 h under 50 mL/min argon flow. So for investigating the effects of potassium loading on the catalytic performance for mixed alcohol synthesis, potassium carbonate (Merck, purity>99.5%) was firstly impregnated on the catalyst with K/Co molar ratio of 0.2 and again dried and calcined at the same condition that mention above. Optimal catalyst with molar ratio of 1.66 (determined after catalysts reaction tests) was selected and molar ratio of potassium to cobalt was altered from 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8."
4,Catalyst carburization,"2.3 Catalyst carburization All the catalysts (1.5 g) were transferred to a quartz reactor inside a tubular resistance furnace controlled by temperature programmer in 50 mL/min hydrogen flow. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 320 °C in 80 min, then from 320 °C to 680 °C in 6 h. The sample was held at 680 °C for 1 h before being cooled down to room temperature in hydrogen flow [18]."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized by ICP, BET, TEM, TPR, XRD and XPS according to the procedure described in our previous work [28]."
6,Catalytic tests,"2.5 Catalytic tests The catalytic tests were carried out in a single-pass tubular down flow, fixed-bed stainless steel micro-reactor of 450 mm length and 9 mm inside diameter, as shown in Figure 1 . All the gas lines to the reactor bed were made from 1/4” stainless steel tubing. The reactor tube was constructed from stainless steel too. Two mass flow controllers (Brooks, Model5850E) were used to automatically adjust the flow rate of inlet gasses (CO and H2 with a purity of 99.999%). The reaction temperature was controlled by a K-type thermocouple inserted into the catalyst bed and visually monitored by a PID temperature controller. The reactor was packed with 1.5 g carbide catalyst diluted with 90 mesh size silicon carbide and vertically settled in a melting salt bath. The HAS reaction was carried out at T = 330 °C, P = 3 MPa, H2/CO = 2/1 and GHSV = 3.36 m3 (STP)/(kgcat·h) over a period of 36 h. Gas product was cooled to 0 °C and separated into gas and liquid phases. Both gaseous and liquid products were analyzed offline by gas chromatography. The gaseous products and CO were monitored with time interval of one hour by means of a Varian CP 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a chromosorb column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The liquid products were collected at the end of the reaction and analyzed with a Varian 3800 with a protocol Tm DH100 fused silica capillary column and a FID."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization The elemental compositions of calcined K/Co/β-Mo2C catalysts on CNTs measured by ICP-MS are given in Table 1 . The measured element's contents of the prepared catalysts were found to be slightly lower compared with the targeted values. The little difference may be attributed to the incomplete precipitation and the impregnation of elements on the support. BET surface areas of the catalysts are shown in Table 2 . It could be seen that after acid-washed procedure of the fresh CNTs, the surface area, total pore volume and average size of the purified nanotubes increased which will result in better dispersion of metal as well as enhancement of the catalyst activity. Application of washing procedure removes part of residual metallic impurities and amorphous carbon [27]. Also the data indicate that via increasing K/Co and Mo/Co molar ratios, the BET surface areas and total pore volumes of catalysts decreased remarkably which is likely due to pore blockage of the support. The TEM images of CNTs-supported Mo catalysts are shown in Figure 2 . Most of the Mo particles were well distributed inside the tubes and remaining on the outside of the tube-walls. The particles inside the tubes were fairly uniform and the most abundant ones were 6–10 nm in size in accordance with the average inner diameter of the CNTs, whereas those on the outer surface had larger size (about 10–30 nm). As shown in this figure, addition of K species increased Mo dispersion, which leads to smaller particles. The stabilized catalysts were characterized by TPR in order to obtain the reduction behavior of the oxidized phases. Figure 3 shows the H2 consumption profiles of CNTs-supported catalysts with varying loadings of K as a function of temperature. The TPR profiles showed typical patterns for the reduction of Mo species from Mo6+ to Mo4+ in the first step (in the temperature range of 450–650 °C) and Mo4+ to lower oxidation state (Mo°) in the second step (>700 °C), as explained in the literatures [29–31]. With the increase of K loading, the maximum temperature for the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ was found to shift to lower temperature. This is due to the fact that the increased K loading promoted the formation of Mo species that are reducible at lower temperatures. That indicates that the increased K loading leads to ease reduction of Mo in the catalyst to Mo species with intermediate valence value by preventing further reduction of Mo. This reduction behavior with the increased loading of K catalyst may be due to the change of the interaction between active Mo components and support [32]. The crystallization and phase composition of the samples with variety of Mo/Co and K/Co molar ratios are shown in Figures 4 and 5 , respectively. In all the cases, the formation of hexagonal close packing (hcp) β-Mo2C related phase was indicated by peaks at 2θ = 34.4°, 38.0°, 39.4°, 52.1°, 61.5°, 69.6° and 74.6° for [100], [002], [101], [102], [110], [103] and [200], respectively [33]. The metal cobalt species were indicated by peaks at 44.2° and 51.6°. As shown in Figure 4, at a fixed K/Co molar ratio (0.2), the intensities of peaks for β-Mo2C increased as Mo/Co molar ratio increased. In addition, in these XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 43.08°, 40.50°, 47.10°, 73.72°, 35.84°, 65.74°, 32.80° matched quite well with the standard data of the face-centered cubic Co3Mo3C. It was found that addition of cobalt element promoted the growth and the formation of β-Mo2C and Co-Mo bimetallic carbide (Co3Mo3C). The diffraction peak for Co-Mo bimetallic carbide became sharper and sharper with the increasing Co/Mo molar ratio till Co/Mo = 1.66, further suggesting that Co-Mo bimetallic carbide with ν-type structure was formed by carbothermal hydrogen reduction at 680 °C which is agreement with a simulated XRD pattern for Co3Mo3C by other researchers [34]. Further investigation also revealed the formation of Co3Mo3C, which can be attributed to the strong synergy effect of Co and Mo [35]. Therefore, at a fixed K/Co molar ratio the intensities of peaks for Co3Mo3C increased when Mo/Co molar ratio increased from 1 to 1.66 and then decreased for large Mo/Co molar ratio. This matter can be attributed to the decreasing probability of forming this strong synergy effect because of low population of Co atoms. With the increase of Mo/Co molar ratio, the β-Mo2C peak became more prominent and the particles size increased. The Mo 3d and Co 2p XPS spectra are presented in Figure 5. It showed the presence of Mo 3d in several oxidation states located at 228.4 eV, 232.5 eV and 235.5 eV. According to the literature, the peak at 228.4 eV was unambiguously attributed to Mo atoms in carbide form, no metallic molybdenum being detected [33]. The peak at 235.5 eV was attributed to Mo6+, which was characteristic of oxidized phases, resulting from the passivation step [36], and the peak at 232.5 eV was probably attributed to Mo4+ and Mo5+ species. Upon adding cobalt to K/β-Mo2C catalysts, the Mo 3d spectra shifted to lower binding energy, however, the peaks became weaker and the position shifted to higher binding energy again as Mo/Co molar ratio increased. Such a shift indicated that cobalt might have a strong effect on the chemical environment of Mo. From Co 2p spectra, it could be seen that the peaks shifted to lower binding energy, however, it shifted to higher binding energy again as the cobalt loading increased. The chemical shift of the observed binding energy would be due to a change in the interaction of charge transfer. As an electronic promoter, the electron density released by cobalt was transferred to Mo, and the increased proportion of Mo in an oxidative environment might favor alcohols synthesis. XRD patterns of K/Co/β-Mo2C catalysts with different K/Co molar ratios at a fixed optimum Mo/Co molar ratio (1.66) are shown in Figure 6 . The function of alkali is to reduce the hydrogenation ability of alkyl species to form alkanes, and increase the active sites for the formation of alcohols [37]. Also the increase of alkali metal loading increased the dispersion of metal active phase (Mo) and consequently decreased the active phase particles size. As shown in Figure 6, at a fixed Mo and Co loading, the intensities of peaks for Co3Mo3C were constant but the intensities of β-Mo2C peaks decreased up to K/Co molar ratio of 0.8. This indicates the fact that addition of K species increased Mo dispersion, which leads to smaller particles and a decrease in intensity of XRD peaks for β-Mo2C species. However, during modification by K2CO3, there were new diffraction peaks and the surface of β-Mo2C has appeared to be decorated by small clusters [20]. This decoration might be related to K2CO3 and/or “K-Mo-C” phase, which was proposed to be the active sites for alcohols synthesis. For β-Mo2C promoted by K2CO3, the carbon monoxide conversion was sharply reduced, yet the product shifted remarkably from hydrocarbons to alcohols. The influence of K2CO3 loading on the performance of catalyst revealed that the maxima yield of alcohol and selectivity to alcohols were obtained at K/Co molar ratio of 0.6. According to XRD results, further addition of K2CO3 prevented the formation of “K-Mo-C” phase and decreased the selectivity to alcohols and increased the selectivity to hydrocarbon."
9,Activity and product selectivity results,"3.2 Activity and product selectivity results The catalyst activity studies toward higher alcohols synthesis were carried out under the following conditions: T = 330 °C, P = 33 bar, GHSV = 3.36 m3(STP)/(kgcat·h) and H2 to CO molar ratio of 2. The liquid and gas products were calculated and summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The results showed the influences of different Mo/Co and K/Co molar ratios on the catalytic performances of Co-Mo-K/CNTs samples for the synthesis of higher alcohols after 36 h. In the case of catalysts with fixed K/Co molar ratio (0.2), CO conversion increased from 37.0% to 63.0% with the addition of Mo/Co molar ratio of 1 to 4. Increasing of Mo loading would create more active sites for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. It was represented high water gas shift activities of molybdenum carbide. As shown in Table 3 for Co-K/Mo2C carbide catalysts, the optimum Mo/Co molar ratio was 1.66 and the maximum selectivity to alcohol (51.4%) and minimum selectivity to hydrocarbons (49.7%) were obtained. At the same time under this condition, the lowest selectivity to methanol (19.9%) and highest selectivities to ethanol (32.8%), propanol (36.7%) and C3+OH (10.6%) were observed. According to the data of XRD, with the increase of the ratio of molybdenum to 1.66, Co3Mo3C phase became broader. This new phase formed due to the synergistic effect of molybdenum and cobalt metal, was much less active in the production of hydrocarbon instead, it accelerated the rate of producing alcohol. But with the increasing Mo/Co molar ratio, β-Mo2C peak became more prominent and the particles size increased, and the formation of Co3Mo3C phase which is more active in producing alcohol became weaker, so alcohol production rate decreased [36]. It can be attributed to the low population of cobalt atoms and the decreasing synergistic effect of molybdenum and cobalt metal. The results of higher alcohols synthesis over K-Co/Mo2C based catalysts in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 K/Co molar ratios at a fixed Mo/Co molar ratio (1.66) are summarized in Table 4 . As seen from Table 4, non-alkali promoted Co/Mo2C catalyst showed high hydrocarbon selectivity (95.2%) and low alcohol selectivity (4.8%). Also, it was found that CO conversion decreased with the increasing K/Co molar ratio (0.2–0.8) from 47.1% to 40.9%. The optimum K/Co molar ratio was 0.6, under this condition, the maximum selectivity to alcohol and minimum selectivity to hydrocarbon, the lowest selectivity to methanol (20.4%) and the highest selectivities to ethanol (39.9%), propanol (30.6%) and C3+OH (9.2%) were obtained. Additional increase of potassium content, not only suppressed CO conversion and alcohol selectivity but also increased hydrocarbon and methanol selectivities. According to XRD results, further addition of K2CO3 prevented the formation of “K-Mo-C” phase and decreased the selectivity to alcohols and increased the selectivity to hydrocarbon."
10,Conclusions,"In the present study, the effect of Mo/Co and K/Co molar ratios on the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas has been studied. It was found that the performances of CNTs-supported Co-Mo-K catalysts are affected by Mo/Co and K/Co molar ratios. Following conclusion can be drawn from the detailed product analysis. On the unpromoted Co-Mo catalyst, the conversion of CO toward alcohol was very low, and the predominant products were hydrocarbons. When the potassium was incorporated, the hydrocarbons products were suppressed to some extent and alcohol formation was enhanced. Furthermore, the alcohols with large carbon number, C2+OH, other than methanol, became the predominant products. Addition of Co at fixed potassium content increased the average particle diameter from 17.9 to 33.2 nm and increased CO conversion from 37.0% to 63.0%. The best Mo/Co molar ratio was obtained of 1.66 at which not only the selectivities to ethanol and higher alcohols reached the maximum but also cobalt showed the highest chain growth propagation effect. It can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Mo and maximum formation of Co3Mo3C phase at 1.66 Mo/Co molar ratios. Addition of Co with K/Co molar ratio range between 0.2 to 0.6 at fixed Mo content suppressed CO conversion, improved alcohol formation and increased the selectivity to higher alcohols, after this limit all the above parameters showed an inverse trend. The influence of Co and K loadings on the performances of CNTs-supported Co-Mo-K catalysts revealed that the increase of selectivity to higher alcohols might be attributed to the formation of “K-Mo-C” and “Co3Mo3C” phases, which were proposed to be active for alcohols synthesis."
