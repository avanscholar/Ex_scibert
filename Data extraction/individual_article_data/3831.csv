0,Introduction,"CO2 conversion to hydrocarbons has received enormous attention in the past decade for the possibilities of exploiting CO2 as feedstock in the storage of sustainable energy and of closing the carbon cycle. Metal oxides-supported transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Ru have been studied as effective catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The main products of the reaction over the above-mentioned catalysts at atmospheric pressure are CH4 and CO [1–5]. In general, CO2 hydrogenation catalysts are prepared in the form of supported metal particles. The metal site is considered as the reactive center while the support is used for dispersing and stabilizing the metal nanoparticles [6,7]. However, recent studies showed that the support could also have an important role in the heterogeneous catalysis of carbon-related reactions. In methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 on Cu-based supported catalysts, the ZrO2 support facilitates the moderate bindings of the key reaction intermediates at the interface of Cu and ZrO2 [8,9]. Moreover, different supports lead to different key intermediates of methanol production, e.g., TiO2 and ZnO2 support surfaces produce formate intermediate, while ZrO2 support surface forms CO*, HCO*, and H2CO* intermediates. The formate intermediate is less active for methanol formation compared to the other intermediates, resulting in a less active catalyst with TiO2 support [10–12]. In higher alcohol synthesis from syngas over Co/CeO2 catalyst, the CeO2 support functions for dispersing the Co nanoparticles. However, the Co is partially oxidized into CoO x due to the strong metal-support interactions. This results in an active Co-CoO x pair for the higher alcohol synthesis where the Co site accounts for CO dissociation to form CH x species and the CoO x site accounts for CO undissociated activation to form CH x O* species. These CH x and CH x O* species combine to form higher alcohol at the interface of Co and CoO x [13]. In CO2 and CO hydrogenation reaction, the partially cobalt nanoparticles on TiO2 supports, Co/CoO/TiO2, exhibit higher CO2 and CO conversion rate than the metallic Co/TiO2, indicating CoO improves reactivity of the catalyst either by the component itself or by forming active interface with the metal or with the support. However, changing the TiO2 support to SiO2 support reversed the activity, implying that different support varies the activity of the catalyst [14]. An early work from Somorjai and co-workers claimed a promotion effect of oxide on Rh metal surface for the CO and CO2 hydrogenation [15]. The promotion effect was attributed to the high Lewis acidity of the metal cations of the oxide by the possible function of cleavage of the C–O bond at the interface of Rh/oxide for CH4 formation. Therefore, they suggested the support participated in the catalytic reaction via cleaving chemical bonds, but this was still disputable. Recent work using supports from Lewis acidic to basic properties to study the support effects in Fischer-Tropsch reaction demonstrated a volcano relation between the reaction rate and Lewis acid-base nature of the support, where the supports was not considered to be catalytic active [16]. The above-mentioned arguments on the role of the support motivate us to clarify the role of the support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, and the relation between the combinations of metal and support and their catalytic reactivity, as these are important for the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. In our previous study on a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, we found that CO2 adsorbed initially on the Al2O3 surface and on the interface of Al2O3 and Ru. Then the adsorbed CO2 and its derivative species migrate to the Ru atoms for the subsequent hydrogenation steps. The support itself did not provide a site for the CO2 hydrogenation steps [17,18]. Herein, we hypothesized that there might be an optimized metal to metal oxide ratio for the highest reactivity toward CO2 hydrogenation. To explore this hypothesis we would like to synthesize catalysts with varying fractions of metal and support for CO2 hydrogenation. However, a “foreign” support could create multiple interfaces, i.e. metal/metal oxide interface, metal/support interface, metal oxide/support interface due to strong metal-support interaction, and this would make it difficult to explore cleanly the effect of the metal/metal oxide ratio [19–22]. To avoid this complexity and to vary only the metal/oxide ratio, we designed a “self-supported” cobalt catalyst with different ratios of the metallic Co and the CoO, i.e., Co x (CoO)1– x with 0 < x < 1. Herein, we developed an in operando reduction method to synthesize the Co x (CoO)1– x samples and to analyze the CO2 hydrogenation reaction in continuous experiments on one platform: a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy-gas chromatograph (DRIFTS-MS-GC) instrument, previously described [23]. The molar concentrations of Co were quantified using the H2 consumption from the MS data. To verify this in situ quantification, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to analyze the compositions and the ratios of Co content in the catalysts. Subsequently, the reactivity of these Co x (CoO)1– x samples in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction was investigated in the DRIFTS-MS-GC instrument. The gas phase and catalyst surface were observed simultaneously to unravel the reaction mechanisms. To understand the origins of the different reactivities, we analyzed the gas–surface interaction using temperature-programmed desorption–mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS). Additionally, surface electronic structures of these samples were measured using near ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to check whether the oxide creates special electronic states for the catalysis. The specific purpose of this work is to answer three key scientific questions: (1) What is the optimal ratio of metal/metal oxide to achieve the highest reactivity in CO2 hydrogenation? (2) Is the role of the support simply to disperse the metal nanoparticles or does it have a direct role in the reaction? (3) If there is a direct role, is it only to provide adsorption sites for CO2 and the associated adsorbed species, or also to provide electronically active sites that reduce those adsorbed species to hydrocarbons? We found that the reactivity of the samples depended strongly on the Co/(Co + CoO) molar ratio. Importantly, we produced a catalyst that is highly active at low reaction temperature. The catalyst with a higher concentration of CoO has a lower onset reaction temperature, a lower activation energy of CH4 formation, and a higher CO2 conversion. We demonstrate that the improved activity of the catalyst stems solely from the role of CoO in providing sites for CO2 adsorption and lowering the CO2 binding energy, but not in providing active sites for the hydrogenation reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation The samples were prepared by starting with Co3O4 and then reducing this material in H2 at various temperature/time profiles to produce several self-supported catalysts with controlled ratios of Co and CoO, Co x (CoO)1– x (0 < x < 1). Co3O4 was obtained by calcination of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) at 300 °C for 12 h followed by a temperature ramp of 2 °C min−1 to 400 °C and then continued calcination for 2 h at 400 °C. To determine the temperature required for reducing Co3O4, the reduction process was tracked with a microbalance (Rubotherm, Germany). Typically, 160 mg of Co3O4 was loaded in the microbalance and a gas flow mixture of 30 mL min−1 H2 and 45 mL min−1 He at 1 bar was supplied 3 h before the reduction to remove the air. A heating ramp of 2 °C min−1 from 25 °C to 400 °C was then applied and the mass loss due to reduction was monitored with an accuracy of 1 μg. Co x (CoO) 1–x (0 < x < 1) catalyst synthesis. The actual catalyst samples used in this study were prepared by reduction of Co3O4 in the reaction chamber (HVC, Harrick Scientific) of a DRIFTS instrument (Bruker Tensor 27) in a mixture of H2/He (flow rate 6 mL min−1/4 mL min−1). Control of the reduction temperature and time allowed us to obtain samples with different Co ratios in a reproducible manner. During reduction, the pressure in the chamber was kept constant at 1 bar by a back pressure valve installed at the exhaust side of the reaction chamber. A quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS, Pfeiffer OmniStar 320) was connected with the DRIFTS reaction chamber to analyze the composition of reactant and product gases using a Faraday detector."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization MS meaurements. The amount of H2 consumed during the reduction was determined by MS analysis. This allowed us to quantify the removal of O atoms from Co3O4 during the reduction process and thus obtain the bulk composition of the catalyst. XPS core level measurements. To quantify the fraction of metallic cobalt on the surface of the Co x (CoO)1− x catalysts, samples were transferred to the XPS through a glovebox to avoid surface oxidation by the air. The XPS is equipped with a dual anode X-ray source and a Phoibos 100 (SPECS GmbH) hemispherical energy analyzer. The Mg K α (1253.6 eV) source was used for this study. The survey scan and narrow scan were collected at 90 eV and 20 eV pass energy, respectively. The oxidation states of partially oxidized Co samples were deconvoluted using CasaXPS software. Separate measurements of Co, CoO and Co3O4 were used to provide the standard peaks used for the deconvolution. NAP-XPS valence band measurements. In addition to the core level XPS spectra, we performed measurements of the valence band to probe which components of our samples are catalytically active. The above XPS instrument did not have sufficient resolution for this purpose. Instead, we used a NAP-XPS (SPECS GmbH) instrument. An Al K α (1486.6 eV) monochromatic X-ray source and a Phoibos 150 NAP hemispherical energy analyzer were used. Survey scans were taken with 50 eV pass energy and narrow scans with 10 eV pass energy. Unfortunately, we could not transfer the samples to this system without exposure to air. To overcome this difficulty we reduced air exposed sample in-situ in the NAP-XPS using H2. This allowed us to study partially reduced samples and measure the valence band of the Co and CoO components. The details of this procedure are given in Section 3.6. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The specific surface areas were evaluated using a BELSORP mini system (MicrotracBEL Corp., Japan) by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K, and was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method from the built-in software. The empty tube was measured at the same time of the measurements of the samples in order to eliminate the dead volume. The results were listed in Table 1 . As we obtained small values of BET surface areas, we measured the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm again in another instrument, Micromeritics Tristar 3000, to be sure of the obtained values. The CO2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was measured as well at room temperature using Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument for evaluating the CO2 adsorption amount. The BET surface areas and CO2 adsorption amounts from the Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument were listed in Table S1. As the samples were transferred through a glovebox, no activation was applied before the measurements. The accuracies of the measurements were 0.01 cm2 mg−1. TEM. The morphology of the samples was visualized in TEM (FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope) operating at 120 kV. The ultrasonic dispersion in ethanol was applied for the sample preparation. The dispersed samples with ethanol were dropped onto the TEM carbon/copper grids and dried in air."
4,CO2 hydrogenation,"2.3 CO2 hydrogenation CO2 hydrogenation reaction on Co x (CoO)1– x samples was carried out in an operando surface–gas analysis system. The reactor is a DRIFTS reaction chamber, which at the inlet is connected to a mass flow controller system, and at the outlet is connected to an MS and GC (SRI 8610C). The GC was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). This setup allows gathering surface information by DRIFTS while quantifying the gases by MS and GC. For CO2 hydrogenation reaction, typically, a Co x (CoO)1– x sample (160 mg) was compressed into a pellet with 4 mm high and 6 mm diameter. In general, the inlet gas was a mixture of CO2/H2/He with flow rates of 1.5 mL min−1/6 mL min−1/4 mL min−1, respectively, at 1 bar. The reaction temperature was programmed from 20 to 350 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. The background of the infrared spectra was taken on the as-reduced sample surface (or 3 h of H2/He flushed surface for Co3O4) in H2/He flow at room temperature. The infrared spectra were collected every 10 min with spectroscopic resolution of 2 cm−1. The MS determined the mass range of 0–50 amu with a rate of 0.5 s per mass unit. The GC took 9 min for each spectrum, with a cooling interval of 4 min between each scan."
5,CO2 + H2 adsorption,"2.4 CO2 + H2 adsorption CO2 + H2 co-adsorption on the samples at room temperature was measured with TPD-MS in a flow gas condition where He was used as the carrier gas. The experimental steps include: (1) Co3O4 sample was loaded in a quartz tube in air and reduced in H2/He flow (6 mL min−1/4 mL min−1) in TPD-MS to obtain the fresh Co x (CoO)1– x sample; (2) the as-prepared Co x (CoO)1– x sample was flushed by He for one hour; (3) 10 mL min−1 CO2 and 10 mL min−1 H2 gases were applied for 20 min; (4) He flush for at least 40 min to remove the gas phase CO2 and H2; (5) heating started to trigger the desorption. The working pressure on the sample was 1 bar. The spectra were taken using a Faraday detector at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, 25, and 40 °C min−1."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Sample synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Sample synthesis and characterization It is generally accepted that the reduction of Co3O4 proceeds in a two-step process: Co3O4 to CoO, and CoO to Co. However, the reduction temperature of each step is strongly influenced by the properties of Co3O4 [13,24–27]. To determine the reduction process of our Co3O4 sample, a microbalance was used to monitor the weight loss during the reduction. As shown in Fig. 1 , the mass loss shows that Co3O4 starts to be reduced at around 200 °C. Until 300 °C, approximately 7% mass loss can be observed, indicating the removal of one oxygen atom per Co3O4 molecule to form CoO. Above 300 °C, the slope of the mass loss curve increases and finally the mass loss reaches a plateau of 27% at 370 °C, which can be ascribed to the complete reduction of Co3O4 to metallic cobalt. This analysis demonstrates that through controlling the reduction temperature and the reduction time, we can obtain samples with different extents of partially reduced Co. Using the microbalance results as a guidance to find the temperature to use for reduction, we prepared the catalyst samples in situ in the DRIFTS reaction chamber. This avoided exposing the samples to air before running reactions. We produced three Co x (CoO)1– x samples at different conditions. The amount of reduced Co in each sample was determined by quantifying the H2 consumed during the reduction. Details on the experimental procedures are given in Section S1 and Fig. S1. The method of preparation was very reproducible as shown in Fig. S2. Table 1 summarizes the results of the sample preparation for three sets of temperature-time processing conditions. The table gives the Co/(Co + CoO) ratios as determined by hydrogen consumption from the MS analysis as well as data on this ratio obtained by XPS and surface area determined by BET. It is clear that higher reduction temperatures lead to a higher fraction of reduced Co. The reduction time at a given temperature was chosen to obtain a stable ratio of Co/(Co + CoO). XRD patterns of Co x (CoO)1– x also confirm the reduction of Co3O4 to metallic cobalt and CoO (Fig. S3). Further verification of the oxidation states of Co x (CoO)1– x was given by XPS measurements via air-free transfer of the samples from the DRIFTS chamber to a glovebox attached to the XPS. As shown in Fig. 2 , the as-prepared Co3O4 sample shows typical nonsymmetric 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks at 780.0 and 795.1 eV, respectively, with additional weak satellite peaks, confirming that the surface composition is Co3O4. The Co x (CoO)1– x samples were deconvoluted with standard Co and CoO spectra, where the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks of metallic cobalt located at 778.7 and 793.7 eV, respectively, and those of CoO located at 781.1 and 796.8 eV. The ratios of the peak areas showed that the fractions of Co were 19%, 51%, and 75% for the three Co x (CoO)1– x samples. The slight difference in the value of Co fraction compared to the results calculated from H2 consumption is likely due to that XPS is surface sensitive while H2 consumption is bulk sensitive. Referring to the quantifications from both XPS and H2 consumption, we name the samples as Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8. The morphology of the samples was visualized using TEM. As shown in Fig. 3 , all four samples show elongated particle shape and the particle width increases from 20 to 100 nm along with increasing metallic cobalt concentration. The increased particle size originates from the sintering of metallic cobalt through high temperature reduction treatment. BET measurements were used for evaluating the specific surface area (Table 1). In agreement with the TEM image, the specific surface area decreases with the increased ratio of metallic cobalt."
8,Activity in the CO2 conversion,"3.2 Activity in the CO2 conversion The activities of the Co x (CoO)1– x samples for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction were evaluated in the DRIFTS chamber under a CO2/H2/He gas flow with a programmed temperature ramp. To check the reactivity of the samples in a wide temperature range, we heated the reaction chamber from room temperature up to a high temperature of 350 °C. Fig. 4 (a) shows the CO2 conversion, as measured by the consumption of CO2, as a function of reaction temperature. The trend of CO2 conversion over the different samples is in the order Co0.2 > Co0.5 > Co0.8 > Co3O4 at any given temperature below 280 °C. For instance, 63%, 53%, and 23% CO2 are converted at 250 °C on Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8 samples, respectively. The CO2 conversion reaches highest value with 98%, 99%, and 93% at 350 °C on Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8 samples, respectively. The reason of the similar high conversion at this high temperature could be that the reaction approaches the thermodynamic limit. The same trend was found in the yield of the main product CH4 (Fig. S4). The yields are commensurate as the CO2 conversion. For comparison, the conversions obtained here are higher than the conversions on the commercial 0.5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at the same applied pressure at 1 bar and space velocity at 5300 h−1 as in this work [3]. The maximum conversion of CO2 on that Ru/Al2O3 is reported to be 75% and at 380 °C, where 75% conversion is found at 260 °C on our Co0.2 sample. These conversions are also much higher than the reported <60% CO2 conversion on the 3% Ru/Al2O3 and 20% Ni/Al2O3 samples at the temperature of 350 °C and space velocity of 55000 h−1 [28]. The details of CO2 conversion, CH4 yield, CH4 selectivity, and CH4 production rate per surface area via normalizing with BET surface area at 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, and 350 °C are showed in Section S3 Fig. S5. The CO2 conversion and CH4 yield and selectivity have similar trends as the CO2 conversion profile shown in Fig. 4(a). The CH4 production rate per surface area inverts this trend, plausibly indicating that the Co is the location where the hydrogenation step takes place. In addition, we tested the reactivity of the Co0.2 sample for long-time CO2 hydrogenation reaction (Fig. S6). We found that the CO2 conversion to CH4 remains stable above 80% after 3 days in stream, demonstrating the sample is long-time active. Therefore, the Co x (CoO)1– x samples are highly active and efficient for the Sabatier reaction. The differences in the reactivity of these partially reduced samples imply a dependence on the initial state of the catalysts, although the samples could have been further reduced at the high reaction temperature. We believe the reactivity of the Co3O4 sample at high temperature is due to some limited partial reduction of this sample in the CO2/H2/He gas flow. Strikingly, these partially reduced samples are quite active at low temperatures. The onset temperatures of CO2 conversion (2% conversion) increase in the order Co0.2 < Co0.5 < Co0.8 < Co3O4, at temperatures of 160, 178, 202, and 275 °C, respectively (Fig. 4(b)). We compared the CO2 conversion extent at temperatures of 180, 200, and 220 °C on these samples. As shown in Fig. 4(c), Co0.2 sample shows activity at 180 °C while the other samples are not active at this low temperature. Co0.2 sample converts 16% and 31% CO2 at 200 and 220 °C, respectively at the applied space velocity of 5300 h−1. Note that decreasing the space velocity will increase the conversion. These conversions are higher than those on all the rest of the samples at the same temperatures. These results verify our hypothesis that there is an optimal ratio of metal/metal oxide to obtain the highest reactivity toward CO2 hydrogenation. The rate constants of CH4 production were calculated with the assumption of an overall first-order reaction of CO2 to CH4 [28–32]. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the highest rate constant occurs on Co0.2 sample at the given temperatures, and decreases gradually when the metallic cobalt concentration increases (excluding the Co3O4 sample). Small amounts of CO and C2H6 were also detected by MS and GC, and GC data were used to quantify the yield (Fig. S7). The maximum yield of C2H6 increases for samples with increasing Co/(Co + CoO) ratio, opposite to CH4 yield (Fig. S8). C2H6 yield is around five-fold larger than CO yield on Co x (CoO)1– x samples, but threefold lower than CO yield on Co3O4 (Fig. S7). These results suggest that C2H6, generated through carbon chain growth, is preferably produced on the samples with high Co concentration. Hence, the metallic site, instead of the oxide site, is responsible for the carbon-carbon coupling. This is in agreement with results for the Fischer–Tropsch reaction where metallic cobalt is the active site for carbon chain growth [33]. On the other hand, pure Co3O4 surface produces more CO than C2H6, suggesting that a reversed-water-gas-shift reaction is more favorable than the carbon-carbon coupling on the pure oxide surface. The activation energy of CH4 production, E a f CH 4 , was determined using the Arrhenius equation. Details of the calculations based on the measured MS data are given elsewhere [23]. Fig. 5 shows the Arrhenius plot and the values of E a f C H 4 . The E a f C H 4 over the samples increases in the order of Co0.2 < Co0.5 < Co0.8 < Co3O4. Thus, we see that samples with lower activation energies have lower onset reaction temperatures and higher CO2 conversions before approaching to the thermodynamic limit."
9,Sample stability during hydrogenation,"3.3 Sample stability during hydrogenation As the CO2 hydrogenation environment is highly reductive, there is an issue of the stability of the samples during the hydrogenation reaction. For temperatures well below those used to prepare the samples, we are confident that the composition is stable, since the preparation reaction was run long time enough for the composition to reach a constant value as confirmed by the ceasing in hydrogen consumption (Fig. S1). Hence, the measurements of onset temperatures for the reaction (Fig. 4(a, b)) and reaction rate at low temperatures (Fig. 4(c, d)) should correspond to the initial compositions of the samples. To check the sample stability after high temperature reaction, the oxidation states of the samples after CO2 hydrogenation were further investigated using XPS. We found that the Co fraction in the Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8 samples increased to 25%, 74%, and 86%, respectively (Fig. S9). Thus, the samples maintained the partial oxidation states and the Co fraction followed the same order as that of the fresh samples."
10,Surface reaction mechanisms,"3.4 Surface reaction mechanisms To understand the reason why the samples with higher CoO concentration have lower activation energy of CO2 to CH4 conversion, we analyzed the surface species recorded by DRIFTS in the operando experiment. The adsorbed species were identified according to our previous work on IR peak assignments and intermediates identification [17,18]. The assigned vibrations of the main IR peaks are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 6 (a), after CO2 + H2 co-adsorption, on the Co0.2 surface we found formate located at the metal–oxide interface (HCOO−*–MOI) and carbonate located on the oxide surface (CO3 2−*–CoO); on the Co0.5 surface, HCOO−*–MOI was the main adsorption product; on the Co0.8 surface, no visible adsorbed species was found; on Co3O4 surface, oxide-bound formate (HCOO−*–Co3O4) was observed. The peaks with wavenumbers below 1500 cm−1 were not listed specifically, but they are the corresponding O–C–O symmetric and C–H bending modes according to our previous assignment [18]. The peak positions are very similar as those observed on Ru/Al2O3 in our previous work [18]. The formation of formate could originate from CO2 interaction with the adsorbed H2 on the under-coordinated cobalt atom on the interfacial CoO and/or on the metallic site of Co [34,35]; and the carbonate could be formed from CO2 adsorption on the metal oxide surfaces [36,37]. The peak intensities of the adsorption species are the strongest on Co0.2 sample, implying an enhanced amount of the adsorbed species on this sample. Moreover, while the formate species formed on all the sample surfaces, CO3 2−*–CoO formed exclusively on the Co0.2 surface. This suggests that Co0.2 sample might promote additional CO2 adsorption via forming an additional chemisorption product on the CoO site. To confirm the observations in IR, CO2-TPD was performed. Fig. 6(b) shows the CO2 desorption spectra (m/z = 44) of the three Co x (CoO)1– x samples. The Co0.2 TPD shows two peaks ~110 °C and 200 °C and a weak peak at ~320 °C; Co0.5 shows three clear peaks at ~100 °C, 180 °C, and 260 °C respectively; Co0.8 is different showing only two desorption peaks at ~160 °C, and 270 °C respectively. It is common that CO2 desorbs at room temperature on metal oxide surfaces [38–42], while below 0 °C zero on metal surfaces [43–46]. Thus, these desorption peaks are ascribed to the CO2 adsorbed on the CoO. With the increase of metallic cobalt fraction, the peak intensity of CO2 desorption becomes weaker, indicating a decreasing amount of adsorbed CO2. Note that the desorption peak intensity on the Co0.2 sample is more than ten-fold higher than that for the other samples. The intensity trend of the TPD measurements is consistent with the DRIFTS result of the CO2 adsorption. However, the differences in the amount of CO2 adsorbed on the three samples are much larger than the differences of their BET surface areas. While BET was measured using N2 isotherm and reflects physisorption properties, CO2 adsorption embodies chemisorption properties of the reactive surface, as CO2 adsorption is used as an indicator of Lewis basicity of the surface [42,47,48]. Higher CO2 adsorption capacity implies more adsorption sites, and stronger CO2 binding implies more basic property of the surface. Therefore, the sample with more CoO component adsorbing more CO2 further confirms that CoO acts as active sites for CO2 adsorption. This also explains the exclusive existence of CO3 2−*–CoO on the Co0.2 sample observed in DRIFTS: more chemisorbed CO2 increased the concentration of CO3 2−* species on CoO sites via a CO2-surface O combination. We also checked the signals of H2 and CH4 from the TPD-MS measurement. As shown in Fig. S10, only very weak signals of H2 were found and no observable CH4 was produced. These phenomena hint that very limited amount of H2 adsorbed on all these sample surfaces, and the hydrogenation of CO2 either could not take place at this very low concentration of reactant gases or produced scanty products that below the detection limit. The CO2 binding energies were evaluated using the activation energies of CO2 desorption, E a d CO 2 determined from TPD data at various heating rates (Table 2, Fig. S11) [49,50], ln T p 2 κ = ln E a d R - ln k 0 + E a d R · T p in which E a d is the activation energy of desorption, T p is the maximal temperature of desorption, κ is the heating rate, R is the gas constant, and k 0 is a constant. From the first desorption peak, we find E a d 1 C O 2 = 38 and 44 kJ mol−1 on Co0.2 and Co0.51 surfaces, respectively. E a d2 CO 2 , from the second desorption peak, = 76 and 129 kJ mol−1 on Co0.2 and Co0.5 surfaces, respectively. E a d C O 2 is not reported for the Co0.8 sample due to the very weak desorption peaks and associated large uncertainty. The values of E a d1 CO 2 and E a d2 CO 2 are comparable to the reported CO2 binding energies on pristine and defective metal oxide surfaces, respectively [51,52]. Therefore, we ascribe the low temperature desorption as originated from CO2 adsorbed on the pristine CoO surface, which leads to similarly low activation energy of desorption on both Co0.2 and Co0.5 surfaces; the high temperature desorption as from CO2 adsorbed on defective CoO surface, which leads to much stronger activation energy of desorption. The E a d2 CO 2 on Co0.2 sample is nearly twofold lower than that on Co0.5 sample, suggesting a moderate adsorption of CO2 on Co0.2 surface compared to strong adsorption of CO2 on Co0.5 surface. As explained above, the stronger CO2 binding indicates a stronger Lewis basic surface. Hence, the Co0.5 surface is more basic than the Co0.2 surface, probably due to a higher concentration of metallic cobalt of the Co0.5 sample. It is interesting that more CO2 adsorbs on the Co0.2 surface than on the Co0.5 surface although the binding energy is actually larger for the Co0.5 surface. We can understand this by noting that if we are below the desorption temperature, the capacity of the surface to adsorb CO2 is related to the number of binding sites. Since Co0.2 has more CoO sites, it can bind more CO2. The observation of enhanced adsorption of CO2 on the Co0.2 sample is sufficient to explain the improved catalytic performance of Co0.2 because the adsorbed species might be byproducts rather than reaction intermediates. To check the reactivity of the adsorbed species, we analyzed the evolution of these adsorbed species using our previously developed method [18]. As shown in Fig. 7 (a, b), HCOO−*–MOI was reduced almost linearly upon heating on both Co0.2 and Co0.5 samples, indicating this species is a reaction intermediate. CO3 2−*–CoO on Co0.2 surface (Fig. 7(b)) and HCOO−*–Co3O4 on Co3O4 surface (Fig. 7(c)) increased while heating, but started to decrease when CH4 started to be formed. Thus, these two species were also reaction intermediates. Unfortunately, water produced in the reaction condensed on the windows and gave strong IR interference. We were only able to track the surface species up to 200 °C for Co0.2 and Co0.5 samples, and 320 °C for Co3O4 sample. However, Liu and the co-authors have proved using theoretical calculations that the wet surfaces favored the protonation of carbonate through interacting with the neighboring hydroxyl groups to form bicarbonate [36,37]. The bicarbonate is an intermediate of CH4 formation from CO2 hydrogenation reaction according to our previous work and the other report [17,53]. These results affirm that the adsorption of CO2 has a positive effect on the CO2 methanation reaction because all the adsorbed species are consumed. Better adsorption of CO2 is related to an improved catalytic performance of the sample. This could also be the reason for the differences in the activation energies of CH4 formation, where E a f CH 4 is the lowest on Co0.2 sample. This further indicates that CO2 adsorption step is the rate determining step of the overall hydrogenation reaction. It is interesting to compare these results with our previous results for CO2 methanation on Ru/Al2O3 [17,18]. There, CO3 2−* and HCOO−* on the oxide site are byproducts, not reaction intermediates as they are here. This confirms our previous supposition of surface-structure sensitive reactivity of the adsorbed species."
11,Surface electronic structure,"3.5 Surface electronic structure A further mechanistic investigation should reveal whether the CoO component of our catalysts participated the catalytic reaction. Considering that heterogeneous catalysis proceeds by electron transfer between the adsorbates and the surface atoms, we can get this information on the activity of CoO by measuring the valence band maximum (VBM) of the surface electronic states. For this measurement, we used a higher resolution XPS which did not allow us to transfer samples without air exposure. Thus, we transferred a Co0.8 sample to the NAP-XPS system through air. This sample was then reduced at 350 °C with 0.4 mbar H2 flow in the NAP-XPS sample preparation chamber. We used XPS core level spectra to determine the composition of the sample after transfer and after 1 h and 2 h of H2 reduction (Fig. S12). After 2 h, the sample was fully reduced and we used this to provide standard core level and valence band spectra for Co for deconvolution with the CasaXPS software [26,54]. After 1 h, the sample was partially reduced with composition of 58% Co and 42% CoO. The core level spectrum of this partially reduced sample is shown in Fig. 8 (a). A deconvoluted valence band spectrum is shown in Fig. 8(b). The fraction of Co from the valence band deconvolution is 47%, as compared to 58% from the core level deconvolution. The difference is not completely understood and may be related to differing surface sensitivity and/or to deconvolution error. The onset of the edge of the valence band for CoO is 1.15 eV below the Fermi level, as indicated by the line in Fig. 8(b). This value is so large that at the temperatures used in this work, it is not possible to thermally excite a sufficient number of electron hole pairs to produce catalytic activity. Although there is a “tail” extended to Fermi level, the population is very small compared to the abundantly electronic states of Co. Therefore, we conclude that the CoO component does not contribute to the hydrogenation process. In contrast, the Co component has high electron density near the Fermi level, suggesting that the excited electrons for the hydrogenation steps are offered by Co. This is in line with the indication from CH4 production rate per surface area discussed in Section 3.2 that the rate per surface area increased with the increasing concentration of Co. Species which are adsorbed on the CoO sites contribute to the catalysis through migration from CoO to the interfacial Co atoms. This is the same as that found on the on Ru/Al2O3 [17]. Here we envision that, when Co concentration decreased to a critical point, the hydrogenation will be suppressed because of the lack of electronically active center. We speculate this critical point is below 5 wt% (~6% molar concentration) referring to the research on Ru/Al2O3 catalysts where increasing Ru loading from 0.1 wt% to 5 wt% on Al2O3 facilitates the CH4 yield and selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation reaction [55]. However, the in situ phase change method here used would be improper to synthesize such low concentration of Co. Different synthetic method, such as chemical or physical deposition, could be applied for extending this investigation. In addition, we noticed that the differences in the overall kinetics of CO2 conversion (Fig. 4(d)) are smaller than those in the intensities of CO2 adsorption/desorption (Fig. 6) on these samples. This could be understood that the samples with higher Co concentration could reduce the migration distance of the adsorbed species, and reserve more available electrons for the hydrogenation steps. These effects compensated partially the drawbacks of less CO2 adsorption and reduced the differences in the overall kinetics of CO2 conversion."
12,Conclusions,"We have shown a facile method to synthesize “self-supported” cobalt nanoparticles composed of Co x (CoO)1– x with different ratios of x= Co/(Co + CoO) via reduction of precursor Co3O4 nanoparticles in H2 gas flow to investigate the relation between the metal/metal oxide fractions and their catalytic properties. Samples with the metal ratios of x= 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were obtained. The samples show very high activity in the Sabatier reaction. Super high conversions of CO2 reach 98%, 99%, and 93% on Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8 samples, respectively at 350 °C, where the reaction meets the reaction thermodynamic limit. Below 280 °C, the activity varies with the sample in the order Co0.2 > Co0.5 > Co0.8 > Co3O4 at all temperatures. For instance, 63%, 53%, and 23% CO2 are converted at 250 °C on Co0.2, Co0.5, and Co0.8 samples, respectively. The Co0.2 sample even shows low-temperature activities from 160 to 180 °C, at which temperatures the rest samples do not have activities. The overall activation energy of CH4 formation increases with the sample in the sequence of Co0.2 < Co0.5 < Co0.8 < Co3O4. Therefore, there is an optimal composition of metal and metal oxide in the catalyst to achieve the highest reactivity. The differences in reactivity among the samples originate from the different functions of the metal and the metal oxide. CoO provides active sites of CO2 adsorption but not electron-transfer sites for the hydrogenation reaction. Co acts as an electronically active center for the hydrogenation reaction. The derivative adsorbed products are observed as formate and carbonate, and these are found to be intermediates of CH4 formation. Of the partially reduced samples, the Co0.2 sample has highest CoO concentration; consequently it adsorbs the largest amount of CO2. Moreover, the low fraction of Co/(Co + CoO) facilitates moderate binding of CO2. The CO2 adsorption step could be the rate-determining step of the overall methanation reaction. Therefore, the Co0.2 sample shows the highest reactivity: the lowest onset temperature and activation energy of CH4 formation, and the highest conversion of CO2 below thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the Co0.5 sample with its higher fraction of Co/(Co + CoO) has a higher binding energy for CO2 due to its stronger Lewis basicity; but it adsorbs less CO2 because there are less CoO sites. As a result, the Co0.5 sample converts less CO2 than the Co0.2 sample. Co0.8 sample does not have the advantage of abundant CoO concentration, therefore not show significant CO2 adsorption amount. This leads to the lowest reactivity of Co0.8 compared to Co0.2 and Co0.5 samples. These results of this work elucidate the optimal composition of metal and metal oxide for achieving the highest catalytic reactivity in the Sabatier reaction. Furthermore, they clarified the different active functions of the metal and metal oxide in the whole CO2 hydrogenation reaction. These two main attainments open the way for the design of efficient catalysts with the optimal ratio of metal over metal oxide."
