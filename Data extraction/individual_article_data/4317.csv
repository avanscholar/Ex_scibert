0,Introduction,"Furfural (FAL) is a kind of biomass-derived promising platform which can not only be obtained from the dehydration of pentose but also is a major component in bio-oil [1,2]. Due to its high reactivity and versatility, it was selected as one of the top 30 building block chemicals from biorefinery by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [3,4]. Thereafter, a number of researches have been conducted for converting it to further chemicals such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL), furan, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), cyclopentanone (CPON) etc., as shown in Scheme 1 [5–8]. Among them, 2-methylfuran has wide applications for pesticides, perfumes, antimalarial drugs, and particularly for fuel additives with the virtue of high octane number (103>97 of gasoline) and adequate energy density (28.5MJ/L<31.9MJ/L of gasoline) [6]. Therefore, the formation of 2-methylfuran, which is derived from the fully hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of furfural gains great interest [5,9,10]. Dong achieved a 95.5mol% yield of 2-methylfuran from vaporous furfural over Cu/SiO2 catalyst with a high H2 to furfural ratio of 17:1, which could be the best result we found from literature survey [11]. In Srivastava et al.’s work, 84mol% yield of 2-methylfuran was obtained over Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst under 4MPa initial hydrogen pressure, and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic catalyst was discussed [12]. Currently, the formation of 2-MF faces a great challenge that a high conversion rate of furfural, a high selectivity for 2-MF, a low catalyst price, and a mild reaction system can be hardly achieved simultaneously. And the general conversion process usually requires the addition of a large amount of hydrogen gas, causing challenges for operation, safety, economy and utilization efficiency, as well as more dependence on fossil fuels [2,13]. Therefore, the in-situ hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) method was put forward, through which the hydrogen source was offered by aqueous reformation of liquid hydrogen donors, such as formic acid, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, etc. [13–16]. Rogers et al. [17] highly appreciated the advantages and feasibilities of the in-situ HDO method in reducing the dependence on fossil-fuel-derived H2 and improving the hydrogen utilization efficiency. Wang et al. studied the in-situ HDO of furfural in dilute solution (1wt%) over noble metal catalyst of Ru/NiFe2O4, and 83% yield of 2-methylfuran was obtained, using 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor [18]. To decrease the process cost, a non-noble metal catalyst has to be developed, and it is known that reduced Cu and Ni metals possess relatively high hydrogenation activities [19–21]. We have investigated the conversions of furfural over Ni-Cu/C catalyst with formic acid as hydrogen donor, and a high yield of 2-methylfuran up to 91mol% was obtained [22]. The results verified the availability of the Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst for producing biofuels from furan derivatives. However, considering that the catalyst with carbon support can hardly be refreshed by combustion after usage, the catalyst with non-combustible support is worthy of investigation. In this work, the conversion of furfural for efficient preparation of 2-MF under mild conditions over Cu/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated, using formic acid as the hydrogen donor which could be obtained from biomass as well [23]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method [24]. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm, ≥98.0%) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sinopharm, ≥98.0%) were used as the metal sources, and Al2O3 (55–65μm) (Alfa Aesar, 99%) was the support material. A certain amount of each salt or the mixture of the two salts was dissolved into deionized water (1.1mL H2O/1.0g Al2O3) according to the loading amount (it was defined that the loading amount was the weight percentage of metal mass divided by the total mass of catalyst). Then, the solution was dropped on Al2O3, aging for 10h at room temperature with intermittent stirring. It was then dried at 80°C for 10h and calcined at 500°C for 5h (heating ramp: 5°C/min). Thereafter, the sample was reduced for 2h at 400°C (heating ramp: 10°C/min) for Cu/Al2O3 and at 550°C (heating ramp: 10°C/min) for Ni/Al2O3 or Ni-Cu/Al2O3 respectively, in the reduction atmosphere of 50 vol% H2 and 50 vol% Ar (300mL/min)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The reduction temperature of the catalyst precursor was determined by H2 temperature programmed reduction analysis (Micromeritics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyzer 2920). Around 20–50mg sample was loaded in a U-type quartz tube and pre-treated at 200°C for 1h under He atmosphere and then cooled to 50°C and kept for 30min in the 10vol% H2 and 90vol% Ar reduction atmosphere. After that, the temperature was raised from 50°C to 800°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. NH3-TPD analysis was performed in the same type of Chemisorption Analyzer to measure the acidity of the catalysts. Around 20–50mg sample was loaded into the U-type quartz tube. The sample was firstly heated to 200°C with a 10°C/min heating ramp and kept for 1h under He atmosphere. Then, it was cooled to 50°C and got adsorption for 1h under the mixed 10vol% NH3 and 90vol% He atmosphere. After that the sample was flushed with He at 100°C for 1h and subsequently heated to 700°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. Finally, the sample was cooled to room temperature. The metal dispersion of the catalyst was measured by CO pulse chemisorption (Micromeritics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyzer 2920) at 40°C and when five successive peaks showed the same areas, it meant the CO adsorption was completed. A CO/metal moles stoichiometry of 1 was used for the calculation of metal dispersion. X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean) analysis was conducted scanning from 5° to 90° at a scan rate of 3°/min with Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 30mA. The surface area and pore size were measured by N2 adsorption/desorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88) after evacuation at 350°C for 5h. Morphological characterization was conducted by transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Before analysis, a small amount of samples were dispersed in isopropanol along with sonicate for 10min and then two drops of the suspension liquid were deposited on a Cu grid followed by drying at room temperature. The metal content of the fresh and spent catalyst was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, ICAP 6300, Thermo Scientific)."
4,Procedure of experiment,"2.3 Procedure of experiment The experiment was conducted in a 100mL autoclave (C276 Hastelloy, CJF-0.1L). The feedstock composed of 1g furfural, 10g solvent (isopropanol, or dimethylsulfoxide, or toluene, or tetrahydrofuran, or H2O), 2g formic acid as hydrogen donor (2 times of the required amount of hydrogen for total reduction of furfural carbonyl, assuming that formic acid was entirely converted to H2 and CO2) and 0.15g catalyst were loaded. Prior to being heated, the reactor was flushed by N2 three times and then 1MPaN2 was remained in the autoclave as initial pressure. The system was then heated to 170–250°C and kept for 1–7h, with ∼700rpm agitation. After reaction, the reactor was put into a water tank for fast cooling. The liquid product was then analyzed by GC–MS (Varian 320GC/300MS) and quantified by internal standard method using ethylene glycol as the standard material. VF-FFAP capillary column with dimension of 25m×0.25mm×0.2μm was used. The mathematical components involved in this article including conversion rate, and product yield were defined as follows: (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = ( 1 − n f u r f u r a l , o u t n f u r f u r a l , i n ) × 100 (2) Yield ( i , % ) = n i , o u t n f u r f u r a l , i n × 100 where, n furfural,in means initial mole of furfural; nfurfural,out mole of furfural after reaction; ni,out mole of component i after reaction."
5,Results,"A triple repetitive experiment was conducted over 10%Ni/Al2O3 at 210°C in isopropanol solvent and the corresponding results showed that the relative standard deviation of furfural conversion was lower than 6%. The deviations of mass and carbon balances for all experiments were less than 10wt%, indicating a qualified data reliability of the experiment system."
6,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results The H2-TPR characterization results for the calcined Cu and Ni catalysts were shown in Fig. 1 . It showed that for Cu/Al2O3, only one symmetric reduction peak appeared in the range of 200–350°C with a peak centered at 220°C. It should be attributed to the reduction of CuO to Cu [25]. For Ni/Al2O3, there were two distinguishing reduction stages: 100°C to 380°C (weak) with the peak center at 250°C and 380°C to 680°C (strong) with the peak center at 525°C. They should be respectively ascribed to the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni, weakly or strongly interacted with Al2O3 [26,27]. Therefore, to ensure the complete reduction of catalysts, 400°C was employed for the reduction of Cu catalyst, and 550°C could be used for the reduction of Ni catalyst or Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst [12,28]. XRD patterns for the catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 . For monometallic catalysts Cu/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3, there were three characteristic peaks observed: Cu(111) at 2θ=43.3°, Cu(200) at 2θ=50.4°, Cu(220) at 2θ=74.1°; Ni(111) at 2θ=44.5°, Ni(200) at 2θ=51.6°, Ni(220) at 2θ=76.4° [28,29]. For the bimetallic catalysts, the Ni characteristic peaks of Ni(200) at 51.6° and the Ni(220) at 76.4° disappeared, while the peak intensities of Cu(200) at 50.4° and Cu(220) at 74.1° were continuously strengthened with increasing loading amount of Ni. Additionally, when the Ni loading amount increased to above 8%, a clear shoulder peak appeared at 44.0° on the right side of the peak of Cu(111), indicating the formation of Ni-Cu alloy [30]. There could be two reasons for the disappearance of Ni peaks. On the one hand, the diffraction peaks of Ni was in an amorphous form or was too weak to be detected by XRD, when the amount of Ni in Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 was too low [12,29]. When Ni amount was increased, the 10%Cu as the metal base in the bimetallic catalysts could induce the shift of Ni peaks to smaller angles, reflected by the formation Ni-Cu phase [9,30]. As a result, the unalloyed Ni could merely present in insignificant amounts, which could hardly be identified by XRD. On the other hand, the positions of diffraction peaks of Cu(200) and Cu(220) were very close to these of Ni-Cu alloy and more Ni loading amount would increase the crystallite size of particles, as what was observed for Ni-Sn catalyst [31]. Therefore, under the influence of the two factors, the Cu peak intensities were strengthened while Ni signals were weakened. Fig. 3 provided the TEM images of 10%Cu/Al2O3 and 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3. For 10%Cu/Al2O3, clear Cu particles were detected covering on the surface of Al2O3, while for 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3, the eutectic phase was observed instead of particles [32]. The average crystallite sizes were calculated from the XRD data using Scherrer equation [24]; the dispersions of metal particles were estimated by CO-adsorption analysis (assuming CO:active metal=1:1) [33]; the BET surface areas and pore sizes were obtained by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis; the acidity of catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD. The corresponding data were listed in Table 1 . It could be seen that the crystallite sizes and the metal dispersions of the bimetallic catalysts were between the corresponding values of 10%Cu/Al2O3 and 10%Ni/Al2O3. The gradually decreased surface area with increasing the Ni loading weight could be attributed to the more occupation of the support surface area by the effectively loaded Ni. While the pore size did not change a lot, meaning the loading mainly occurred on the external surface of Al2O3. The quantity of the catalyst acidity varied with the loading amount of metals. For the monometallic catalysts, 10%Cu/Al2O3 owned a little more acidity than 10%Ni/Al2O3. As the dispersion of 10%Cu/Al2O3 was lower than that of 10%Ni/Al2O3, meaning more support surface was exposed, it could explain the difference of the acidity amount between the two catalysts. With the increasing loading of Ni in bimetallic catalysts, the acidity of catalysts gradually decreased, which could be caused by more metal particles covering on the support surface."
7,Conversion of furfural over monometallic Ni and Cu catalysts,"3.2 Conversion of furfural over monometallic Ni and Cu catalysts Under the catalysis of 10%Ni/Al2O3, the influence of reaction temperature on conversion of furfural in isopropanol solvent was investigated and the results were shown in Fig. 4 . It could be seen that firstly the furfural conversion rate increased rapidly with the increase of temperature and then became stable at around 93% after 210°C. For the product distribution, it created a complex system mainly composed of furan, 2-methylfuran, tetrahydrofuran, butanol and furfuryl alcohol, which indicated that Ni/Al2O3 could simultaneously catalyze the decarbonylation of furfural, and the hydrogenation of both carbonyl group and furan ring [21,26]. The yield of furan monotonously increased with the rise of temperature. Similarly, the formation of tetrahydrofuran from hydrogenation of furan ring and the formation of butanol from ring-open reaction were continuously promoted by increasing temperatures as well. Contrarily, the yield of furfuryl alcohol from hydrogenation of carbonyl reached to a maximum value at 190°C, since it may further convert to 2-MF via the hydrogenolysis of hydroxyl at higher temperatures. Similarly, the yield of 2-MF appeared a maximum value of 39% at 210°C, and then declined soon, attributed to the prevalence of decarbonylation of furfural at even higher temperatures. Under the catalysis of 10%Cu/Al2O3, the conversion of furfural increased with rising temperature as well, but the increasing trend was remarkably different from that under the catalysis of 10%Ni/Al2O3, as showed in Fig. 5 . Additionally, when the temperature reached to 250°C, severe coking happened with the color of liquor turned from initial light yellow to brown black and some coke solid covering on catalysts. The coke formation was harmful to the catalyst activity and to the whole reaction system. However, the product composition over 10%Cu/Al2O3 was much simpler, with only three major components of furan, 2-methylfuran, and furfuryl alcohol in the product system. The yield of furfuryl alcohol appeared a maximum value with increasing temperature, because of the further hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran at higher temperatures. Compared with the high activity of 10%Ni/Al2O3 in hydrogenation of furan ring or decarbonylation of furfural, the 10%Cu/Al2O3 catalyst could more preferentially promote the conversion of carbonyl to hydroxyl with the formation of furfuryl alcohol, followed by hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran. It was in agreement with the literature results that Cu was more selective to the hydrogenation of CO bond rather than CC, with a low activity in decarbonylation [3,34,35]."
8,Conversion of furfural over bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts,"3.3 Conversion of furfural over bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts By virtue of the distinctive catalytic performance of Ni and Cu catalysts, the bimetallic catalysts of Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 were prepared and investigated to increase the yield of 2-MF. From the perspective of temperature effect and energy saving, 210°C was selected as the reaction temperature. The conversions of furfural and the product yields varied with the loading amount of Ni in the bimetallic catalysts were shown in Table 2 . It could be seen that the conversion of furfural as well as the yield of 2-MF increased by elevating Ni loading amount. When the Ni content reached to 10% in the Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts, the conversion of furfural increased to 97.4mol% with the highest 2-MF yield of 75.6mol%. Under the catalysis of 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3, the hydrogenation of carbonyl to FOL, followed by hydrogenolysis of FOL to 2-MF was the predominant conversion route, as what happened under the catalysis of monometallic Cu catalyst. It could be speculated that for the Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst, the addition of Ni promoted the conversion of furfural due to its high intrinsic activity, and the existence of Cu played the roles in inhibiting the reactions occurring on furan ring and the decarbonylation of furfural. Additionally, the Ni-Cu alloy phase could change the adsorption configuration of furfural. The metal of Cu may repel the adsorption of furan ring on catalyst surface and strengthened the interaction with carbonyl O atom for further hydrogenation, and thus suppressed the decarbonylation [28,30]. The turnover frequency (TOF) for furfural conversion at 210°C was calculated and compared among different catalysts, as showed in Table 2 (herein, the TOF was measured in the initial 10min reaction with low furfural conversion). It could be seen that Ni based catalyst (TOF=1099h−1) was more active than Cu based catalyst (TOF=643h−1), and generally the TOF value increased with increasing the loading amount of Ni in the bimetallic catalyst. The highest value (TOF=1408h−1) obtained from 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 was higher than the value of monometallic Ni or Cu catalyst but lower than the sum."
9,Effect of different solvents on furfural conversion,"3.4 Effect of different solvents on furfural conversion The effect of reaction solvent on furfural conversion and on product distribution was studied over 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3. Five solvents were tested and the corresponding results were shown in Table 3 . It could be seen that the highest conversion of furfural coupled with the highest yield of 2-methylfuran was obtained when using the isopropanol solvent. The performances of tetrahydrofuran and toluene were just mediocre, with moderate yields of 2-MF. By contrast, the solvents of DMSO and H2O showed the poorest performances on the yield of 2-MF, though the corresponding furfural conversions were not very low. The so call solvents in fact were not absolutely inert during the reaction process. They may not only work as media with various influences to the mass transfer of reactants or products, but also proton donors for catalysis or even involved in the hydrogenation reaction. H2O was the strongest proton donor among them and could generate a certain amount of H+ ions at high temperatures acting as acid catalyst [36]. In H2O system, the liquid color turned from initial light yellow to dark brown after reaction and severe coking problem was encountered, which would deteriorate the reaction system. The coke was generated from the polymerization or condensation of furfural, which would convert to more active intermediates with carbon–carbon double bonds or carbonyl bonds if the hydrogenation could not substantially defeat degradation in water solvent [37]. Isopropanol was also a proton donor with moderate proton donating ability, compared with water and the other three organic solvents, and favored the hydrogenation of furfural without the coking problem. This solvent effect was also detected by other researchers with methanol and water as the main comparison objects and it was consistent with the conclusion that alcohols were the more favored solvents for the upgrading of furfural [37]. It explained the best performance of isopropanol in the reaction system. Additionally, though water solvent would cause serious coking problem for the conversion of furfural, the reaction water formed from hydrogenation played weak effect in alcohol solvents due to its extremely low content in the system."
10,Effect of feed ratio on furfural conversion,"3.5 Effect of feed ratio on furfural conversion The effect of the feed ratio of furfural to formic acid on furfural conversion and product distribution was investigated over 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 catalyst in the isopropanol solvent. The results were shown in Table 4 . It could be seen that if no formic acid was added into the system, the furfural conversion was decreased to 85.0%, and the product of FOL was predominantly generated with a high selectivity up to 95.6%. It could be attributed to the donation of proton from isopropanol for furfural conversion through the transfer hydrogenation process, with cogenerated acetone from isopropanol detected by GC–MS [10]. Whereas, the low yield of 2-MF under no addition of formic acid in the feed, indicated that the proton donating ability of isopropanol was insufficient for deep hydrogenolysis of furfural. With increasing amount of formic acid, the conversion of furfural was improved first, and then became stable when the mass fraction of formic acid was higher than that of furfural. Particularly, the yield of 2-MF increased tremendously with a severe deceasing yield of FOL. It indicated that 2-MF was generated from deep hydrogenolysis of FOL under the effect of formic acid. When the amount of formic acid was increased to 2 times higher than that of furfural, the product distribution changed very little. This phenomenon was consistent with other reported results on the influence of hydrogen pressure to the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [38,39]. Therefore, the ratio of furfural to formic acid of 1:2 was selected as the proper value for the formation of 2-MF."
11,The furfural conversion and product yield over reaction time,"3.6 The furfural conversion and product yield over reaction time The effect of reaction time on furfural conversion and product distribution over 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 at 210°C in isopropanol solvent was investigated as showed in Fig. 6 . It could be seen that the conversion of furfural increased rapidly in early 2h, and then increased slower and tended to reach to 100% after 5h. In regard to product yields, it could be seen that in the first one hour, FOL was the most abundant product, and then 2-MF was gradually more generated with proceeding of the reaction, and its yield even reached up to 92mol% after 7h. The yield changing trend of 2-MF was clearly opposite to that of FOL, which was regarded as the intermediate. Moreover, just a little furan product from decarbonylation was generated in the whole process, and no ring-hydrogenation or ring-open products was generated. Additionally, the change of pressure in the reactor with reaction time was shown in Fig. 7 , which could reflect the conversion rate of formic acid. Formic acid was mainly decomposed to H2 and CO2 [24]. Combined Figs. 6 and 7, it could be seen that the decomposition rate of formic acid and the conversion rate of furfural shared the similar changing trend. In the first 2.5h, the decomposition rate was must faster than that in the late 4.5h. This kind of decomposition behavior of formic acid could effectively promote the reduction of furfural as it could supply the H2 timely. Finally, the yield of 2-methylfuran was more satisfactory than the ones reported by other literatures, and thus it was expected to be contributive to the development of 2-MF production [2,10,30]. Based on the above results, it can be generalized that the bimetallic catalyst 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 had a higher catalytic activity than pure 10%Cu/Al2O3, and a higher selectivity towards 2-methylfuran than pure 10%Ni/Al2O3."
12,Catalyst recyclability,"3.7 Catalyst recyclability The stability of the 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was also studied for hydrogenation of furfural. The catalyst was recycled for 5 times. Every time after reaction, the catalyst was separated and dried in a vacuum oven at 100°C for 10h without other treatment. Fig. 8 showed the change of furfural conversion and the change of product yields with different recycle runs. It could be seen that with the increase of recycle runs, the conversion of furfural decreased slightly. After 5 runs, the conversion rate decreased from initial 97mol% to 88mol%. It meant that the catalytic ability of the catalyst dropped slightly with the increase of recycles. Meanwhile, the yield of 2-methylfuran decreased gently as well from 74mol% in the first run to 61mol% in the fifth run, while the yield of furfuryl alcohol got increased from 16mol% to 22mol%. It indicated that the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran was restricted in a slight degree. These phenomena could be caused by the changes of the catalyst surface and the leaching of metals. The comparison between the fresh catalyst and the catalyst after fifth recycle was conducted through XRD analysis as showed in Fig. 9 . It could be seen that the 5th recycled catalyst illustrated similar characteristic features with the fresh catalyst and no new peaks were observed, which indicated that no metallic oxides were generated. The intensity of the peak at 44.0° decreased slightly, indicating a weak degradation of Ni-Cu alloy phase, while the intensities at 43.3°, 50.4°, 74.1° were firm, indicating the stable interaction of Cu with Al2O3. Meanwhile, the crystallite size increased from 30.6nm to 36.8nm, indicating a slight aggregation of the catalyst. Additionally, through the ICP-OES analysis of the fresh and spent catalyst, the Ni and Cu content in bimetallic catalyst decreased from 9.3% and 9.7% to 8.1% and 9.0% respectively. The metal leaching could be caused by the moderate interaction between metal and support, and the acidic solution would also aggravate this phenomenon. In summary, the stability of the catalyst was in an acceptable level, though the catalytic performance did slightly worsen in 5 cycles of usage with no regeneration treatment. The change of metal phase and the loss of metal content should be responsible for the slightly weakened catalyst activity on furfural conversion and 2-MF yield after 5 runs. More work would be conducted in this aspect in the future."
13,Discussion,"Under the catalysis of monometallic Cu catalyst, the favorable reduction of carbonyl to furfuryl alcohol could be attributed to the repulse of the adsorption of carbonyl C atom on Cu atom, which decreased the opportunity for decarbonylation [35,40]. As shown in Scheme 2 , the furfural adsorbed on Cu(111) through carbonyl O in a η1(O)-aldehyde configuration due to its oxophilic nature, followed by H attack at C atom or O atom for reduction of carbonyl, then furfural alcohol and 2-MF were high selectively generated [5,21,40]. But compared with some other results over Cu based catalysts, the corresponding yield of either furfural alcohol or 2-MF was not high, which may be caused by the absence of a large amount of external H2 and the relative low metal loadings [21,25,41,42]. Under the catalysis of monometallic Ni catalyst, the carbonyl C atom and carbonyl O atom could both be activated simultaneously shown in Scheme 2. Furfural could adsorb on Ni(111) through η2(C,O)-aldehyde configuration [43], which would lead to the formation of FOL and 2-MF. On another hand, more stable acyl species could be generated simultaneously, and therefore the formation of furan was promoted through decarbonylation process, especially at high temperatures [44]. Additionally, due to the strong interaction between furan ring and Ni metal sites, ring-hydrogenation or ring-open reactions may happen too [45], which would generate the products of tetrahydrofuran and butanol. It explained the higher complexity of product composition under the catalysis of mono Ni catalyst. Sitthisa et al. [21] had investigated the hydrogenation of vaporized furfural over 5%Ni/SiO2 and indicated its multiple catalytic abilities as what this report showed. But the yield of 2-MF in their work was not as high as in this work. It was speculated that the more metal loading of catalyst and the transfer hydrogenation effect of isopropanol were responsible for this improvement. While Srivastava et al. [12] achieved a higher selectivity for the reduction of carbonyl but a lower selectivity for decarbonylation over 10wt% Ni/Al2O3, which was different from the results in this report. Possibly, the used high hydrogen pressure (4MPa) could inhibit the decarbonylation reaction. As for the Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst, it exhibited a strong synergistic effect with the mutual advantages of the two mono metal catalysts shown in Scheme 2. It was clearly showed that with the increase of Ni amount, the furfural conversion was remarkably improved, due to the high intrinsic activity of Ni; whereas the decrabonylation, ring-hydrogenation, and ring-open reactions were suppressed simultaneously. It could be attributed to the change of the adsorption configuration of furfural on catalyst surface. The atom of Cu adjacent to the atom of Ni could reduce the transformation of η2(C,O)-aldehyde configuration on Ni metal sites to acyl species, and meanwhile enhanced and promoted the η1(O)-aldehyde configuration of carbonyl O atom on Cu metal sites and on Ni metal sites [30]. Therefore, it promoted the formation of 2-MF high efficiently with high selectivity. Compared with other bimetallic catalyst such as Ni-Fe [30], Ni-Pt or Cu-Pt [5], the yield of 2-MF was higher, indicating the combination of Ni-Cu could be a good choice for the formation of 2-MF. Besides, the product from furan ring hydrogenation e.g. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran was not detected in this work, different from other researches [12,46]. One of the reasons could be the diverse intrinsic affinities for furan ring showed by different metals during the furfural conversion process. Another reason could be the high hydrogen pressure used in other researches, unlike the moderate hydrogenation process by means of hydrogen donors in this research. Another interesting point of this work was the particular role of isopropanol coupled with formic acid. As illustrated in Scheme 3 , it could be speculated that the reaction between furfural and isopropanol gave the major product of furfuryl alcohol with cogenerated acetone from isopropanol, and the addition of formic acid could decompose to H2 [24], significantly promoting the further hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran. If there was no isopropanol in the system, the use of formic acid combined with other solvents could of course produce furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran, but with lower yield or coking problem, as shown in Table 3. For the first problem, it could be caused by the absence of transfer hydrogenation process. The transfer hydrogenation process could significantly accelerate the first hydrogenation step of carbonyl and thus promote the whole process [47]. Villaverde et al. [42] investigated the preparation of furfuryl alcohol from furfural, and it verified the better ability of a secondary alcohol like 2-propanol, 2-butanol than a primary alcohol like ethanol and 1-propanol. For the second problem, the coking problem appeared in the furfural aqueous solution. A large amount of H+ ionized from water and formic acid directly catalyzed the condensation or thermal degradation of furfural, causing the formation of coke [48]."
14,Conclusions,"To achieve a high efficient conversion of furfural to 2-methylfuran over an inexpensive catalyst under moderate conditions, the performances of two monometallic catalysts of Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3, and the bimetallic Ni-Cu/Al2O3 were investigated with formic acid as a hydrogen donor. It was found that mono Ni catalyst had a catalytic activity both in decarbonylation and hydrogenation, making the product system complex. Contrarily, a mono Cu catalyst showed a moderate catalytic activity but a high selectivity for the hydrogenation of carbonyl. The Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibited an integrated performance of the both mono metal catalysts. With the increase of Ni content in Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3, the catalyst turned more active and more inclined to the formation of 2-methylfuran. The reaction solvent and the addition amount of formic acid were influential for the reduction process as well. The isopropanol solvent could provide 96% selectivity for the formation of furfuryl alcohol without formic acid. Under the catalysis of 10%Ni-10%Cu/Al2O3 at 210°C in isopropanol in 7h, a high yield of 2-methylfuran up to 92mol% was obtained, which may benefit from the synergic effect of Ni-Cu alloy, with increased affinity for carbonyl and repulsion for furan ring."
