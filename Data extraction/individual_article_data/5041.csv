0,Introduction,"On the verge of a global energy crisis and pollution due to vast ingestion of fossil fuels in the variety of coal, petroleum and natural gas, a continuous search for an environment-friendly, abundant and sustainable energy source had appealed a tremendous attention in the past years [1]. Hydrogen, as a clean fuel, had been considered as a probable substitute due to its high energy capacity and regenerative capabilities [2]. Catalytic hydrolysis of boron-hydrides is considered one of the most promising hydrogen sources; some of these candidates are ammonia borane, hydrazine, lithium borohydride and sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Among these hydrides, NaBH4 has been competitively favored for hydrogen energy production because of its high hydrogen density (10.8 wt%), stability and non-toxic byproducts. Rapid hydrogen production from NaBH4 has been attained through catalytic hydrolysis by applying a noble metal (e.g. Ru, Au, Pd and Pt) heterogeneous catalyst [3–5]. However, its high price and limited sources hinders its implementation onto large scale hydrogen production, this drives the attention towards affordable transition metal-based catalysts. Particularly cobalt and nickel had been commended because of its low price, abundance and excellent catalytic ability [6,7]. Regardless of the well-known industrial application of powder nanostructure catalyst for homogeneous hydrolysis, some processing problems are not yet resolve such as aggregation, tedious separation and inapplicability on continuous process system. These difficulties are attended by the development of monolithic catalyst that is stable, active, efficient and economical [8–11]. Additionally another influential factor that affects the catalyst capabilities are size, shape and morphology [12]. Morphological upgrade has received a great attention in various field of application such as biomedicine, catalysts, fuel cells and sensors. Morphological structure can be classified as isotropic (0D) and anisotropic forms (1D, 2D, 3D). These gives avenue for catalytic improvement due to active sites exposure and diffusibility of gas evolved in relation to mass transfer elevation [13–15]. Thus, emerging infusion of active materials such as transition metals and non-metals (borides, phosphides and oxides) had been explored to boost catalytic performance. Combinations of different metallic sources (e.g. Ni, Fe, Co and Mn) to form a bi-metallic integrated catalyst are cited to possess a better performance having its electronic and chemical characteristics from its singular precursors [16,17]. In previous reports on supported catalyst for hydrolysis of NaBH4 several combinations of transition metal catalyst had been investigated such as FeCoB [18], Co, CoP [19] CoMnB [20], CoWB [21], CoPB [22], CoWP [23], CoNiP [24,25] on various support and most of it was showcased using electro deposition and electroless deposition to deposit particles and form thin films on the various supports. However, this methodology limits the morphological architecture improvement due to electrically driven aggregation of the metal precursors and mostly suffers from weak particle substrate attachment [24,25]. On the other hand, 3D nanoparticles with various structural configurations had also been investigated, efforts had also been made to adapt these nanoparticles on a substrate with the aid of epoxy, but this aid tend to reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst due to active sites blocking. With the aims to design a highly active monolithic catalyst for hydrolysis of NaBH4 addressing operational limitations of powdered catalyst for industrial application by morphologically enhancing the nanoparticles on a porous support. Considering the ability to modify morphological structure in a simple processing method, facile hydrothermal method followed by phosphidation method was chosen with such consideration on its low production cost for economic advantage [18,26–29]. Herein, tailored the ternary three elemental component system of phosphidized nickel-cobalt bimetallic alloy as the supported ternary NiCoP urchin like 3D nanostructure directly grown on a nickel foam (NiCoP/NF) serves as a monolithic catalyst for high demand hydrogen production. With relative consideration on the advantages of 3D nanostructures and aggregation elimination denoting its direct impact to the materials active sites exposure and mass transfer speed in proportion with the catalyst capability [30–32]. Nickel foam was chosen as a support due to its micro porous architecture [27,33]. Additionally, with the assumption that synergistic effect of ternary system will provide enhancement on catalytic performance in line with the aim to design a highly active monolithic catalyst [34], different supported Ni2-xCoxP (Ni2-xCoxP/NF) (x = 0, 1, 1.2, 1.35, 2) were prepared by varying salts precursor ratio to further understand its mechanism."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel (II) Nitrate Hexahydrate (99%, Ni(NO3)2 6H2O), Urea (98%, CH4N2O), Sodium Hypophosphite (NaH2PO2 6H2O), NaBH4 were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Cobalt (II) Nitrate Hexahydrate (98%, Co(NO3)2 6H2O) Acros Organics. All reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of NiCo hydroxide precursor,"2.2 Synthesis of NiCo hydroxide precursor In typical hydrothermal preparation route, 2.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2 6H2O, 4 mmol Co(NO3)2 6H2O and 12 mmol Urea were stirred with 30 mL deionized water until the solution is homogeneous. The resulting solution was moved into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Pre-treated nickel foam, 2 cm × 2 cm, (Consecutive sonication in the solutions of 2 M HCl, deionized water and ethanol) was submerged in the prepared NiCo solution for hydrothermal metal deposition. The autoclave was maintained at 120 °C in an electric oven for 8 h. The resulting NiCo hydroxide precursor was cooled to room temperature, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol alcohol, and then dried in the oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Hydroxides of Ni2-xCox (x = 0, 1, 1.2, 1.35, 2) were prepared using the same procedure through variations on the metal salts precursor ratio using the same molecular amount."
4,Synthesis of NiCoP,"2.3 Synthesis of NiCoP The fabrication of NiCoP/NF was done by following the usual phosphidation method. The NiCo hydroxide precursor and 2 g of NaH2PO2 H2O were placed separately in a porcelain boat 4 cm apart from each other, having NaH2PO2 H2O at the lower stream part of the tubular furnace and treated at 300 °C for 3 h under N2 atmosphere. The N2 stream flow was maintained throughout the whole process. Lastly, the furnace was allowed to cool down to atmospheric temperature. Co, Ni and NiCo (of different Ni and Co molecular ratio) were phosphidized using the same procedure. The mass loading of urchin like NiCoP onto the nickel foam surface was determined to be 6.0 mg cm−2."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The thermal stability of the material was evaluated by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) using TGA N-100 instrument, under N2 atmosphere (50 mL min−1) from 30 to 800 °C at heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Monolithic structure of the catalyst was investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) using X’pert MPD diffract meter with Bragg angle ranging from 10 to 90° to record the XRD patterns (Cu-K radiation = 1.540 Å). Functional groups of the heterogeneous catalysts were observed using a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (Varian 2000), with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and a scanning number of 32 in the 4000–400 cm−1 range. The morphology of monolithic catalyst was studied using field emission-scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM), enabled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer and EDX (Hitachi, S-3500 N) 5B to 92U."
6,Catalytic performance testing,"2.5 Catalytic performance testing Catalytic hydrogen generation rate of the Ni2-xCoxP/NF (x = 0, 1, 1.2, 1.35, 2) was measured by a conventional water displacement setup (Scheme 1 ), in which mass of water displaced was directly measured through computer aided electronic balance. Usually a jacketed reactor is used for the hydrolysis experiments to control the temperature of the exothermic nature of the system. The supported catalyst (1 cm × 1 cm) was attached in a wire then submerged in the alkaline NaBH4 solution. NaOH concentration was maintained at 1% on all hydrolysis reaction based on the previous reports to stabilize the solution [35]. The temperature was kept at desired condition to determine the temperature dependency correlation onto the catalytic activity of the supported catalyst. Activation energy was determined with different temperature settings in which the correlation was converted to Arrhenius plot. Recyclability of NiCoP/NF test was done by repeating the catalyzed hydrolysis 5 times. The catalyst was collected, washed and dried prior hydrolysis application."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of supported NiCoP catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of supported NiCoP catalyst Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of NiCoP/NF through a simple two-step fabrication procedure using hydrothermal followed by phosphidation method. NiCo hydroxide precursor was in situ grown on the Ni foam (2 cm × 2 cm) via hydrothermal treatment of the Ni2+and Co2+ salts with urea at 120 °C for 8 h. NiCo hydroxide precursor was topotactically converted to NiCoP/NF through solid state phosphidation reaction. The TGA curve is projected in Fig. 1 . The relative thermal curves of Ni2-xCox hydroxide (x = 1, 1.2, 1.35) follow the same decomposition trend for the temperature and residue characteristic response during thermal decay. Two decomposition steps are observed: evaporation of the water content (3–5%) at the temperature range of 50–130 °C and degradation of NiCo hydroxide at 290–350 °C (10–11%), the elimination of the hydroxides favored the phosphidation of the surface of the sample. Meanwhile, Ni hydroxide also follows a two-step decay but with a rapid rate of deterioration on its first step that is correlated to a lower inflection temperature. While Co hydroxide precursor demonstrates a single step degradation with a slow initial residual decay but follows the temperature deterioration of the Ni2-xCox hydroxide (x = 1, 1.2, 1.35). Nevertheless, these determine the impurity removal and pureness of the different yielded catalysts after the phosphidation process at 300 °C operating condition. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction configurations of the prepared Ni2P, Co2P and Ni2-xCoxP (x = 1, 1.2, 1.35) catalysts variety directly grown on nickel foam. Upon increase on the Co content, the XRD diffraction peaks move to higher angle of diffraction which can be indexed to hexagonal crystal structure of NiCoP (JCPDS card no. 71–2336) for Ni2-xCoxP catalyst variations (x = 1, 1.2, 1.35). The major diffraction peaks located at 2ϴ of 41°, 47.6° and 54.5° are indexed to (1 1 1), (2 1 0) and (3 0 0) crystal planes, respectively [32,36]. It should be noted that reports published regarding Ni2-xCoxP having x greater than 1.0 imply that XRD diffraction profiles projects the same profiles due to similarity in their crystal structure and lattice framework [28,32]. This can be constituted on the respective place of Ni and Co in the periodic table, the atomic number of Ni and Co are 28 and 27 which means that they are located adjacent in the periodic table, and therefor suggested that their atomic radius have close values. So, the variation in the Co and Ni metal precursor gives small impact onto the crystal architecture [37]. XRD analysis for Ni2P indexed with JCPDS card no. 01-074-1385 [38] and Co2P indexed with JCPDS card no. 032-0306 [39]. Additionally, three strong peaks for all the samples are observed at 2ϴ of 44.2°, 52° and 76.4° which are indexed to cubic Ni foam substrate (JCPDS card no. 04-0850) [27,33]. The XRD patterns of Ni2P is more defined than the Co2P in which upon comparing the XRD patterns even though with different variation on Co and Ni content, lower Co contents typically have a mixture of Ni2-xCoxP and N2P. However, the increase in the Co amount tent to form a mixture phase composed of Ni2-xCoxP and CoP. This result shows that free Co atom cannot enter the Ni2-xCoxP crystallite rather to forms a separate CoP phase [34]. Spectra are shown in Fig. 3 . Stretching bands observed between 3400 and 3600 cm−1 spectrum are related to the interlayer water content stretching vibration. Other peaks that are attributed to water molecules are bands between 1600 and 1650 cm−1 [40,41]. Vibration frequency above 1200 cm−1 signifies the presence of anion phosphate onto the catalysts surface. Spectra readings suggest that bands from 1000 to 1150 cm−1 wave number range belong to PO4 category corresponding to P-O band frequency. Respectively, multiple bands in the region between 500 and 750 cm−1 signifying the presence of PO2, C-O and Ni-O band stretching vibration [42]. The FTIR spectra clearly conveyed a closer view of the prepared catalysts and verified the successful configuration of Ni2P, Co2P and Ni2-xCoxP catalysts assortment. Moreover, field emission-scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM) images confirm the successful direct growth of polydisperse catalyst onto the porous surface of the nickel foam. Fig. 4 (a–f) indicates the formation of identical urchin like 3D nanostructure for Ni2-xCoxP/NF (x = 1, 1.2 and 1.5) uniformly attached on the surface of Ni foam. While singular metal phosphides exhibit different morphological characteristics shown in Fig. 4(g–j), Ni2P demonstrated a coral-like structure. On the other hand, Co2P projected a flower-like configuration. It is demonstrated that upon incorporation of Co2+, formation of nanowire in radial form originated on the spherical center of the particle was formed in which appears to be the urchin like morphology. This is due to the increase in growth ability and decrease on self-aggregation with the incorporation of Co2+ that constitutes the NiCo hydroxide crystal growth formation in nanowire radial form [29]. Particle size on the other hand appears to be diverse in size due to rate of nuclei formation. Particularly in the hydrothermal method were in the Ni2+ and Co2+ cations react with hydroxide to produce NiCo hydroxide and deposited onto the surface of the nickel foam to form a pronounced structure. The different rate of nuclei formation that forms the aggregation core for its nanowire radial structure formation is deviated due to random dispersion of the of the primary particles [21]. The morphological architecture of the resulting supported catalyst in Fig. 5 (a-d) displays the structural morphology characteristics before and after phosphidation. It was also observed that the structural configuration are maintained after phosphidation process with slight surface changes which can be correlated to the gases released upon exposure to phosphidation temperature [43]. Lastly, elemental dispersal on Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF was confirmed with the aid of energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Fig. 6 indicates the atomic ratio for different metal precursor ratio of Ni and Co, on Table 1 which proves the uniform adherence of Ni, Co and P onto the 3D catalyst surface. The corresponding approximation with respect the metal content precursor and the actual concentration approach a linear correlation"
9,Catalytic activity performance,"3.2 Catalytic activity performance 3.2.1 Effect of metal ratio variation The catalytic activity of Ni2P, Co2P and Ni2-xCoxP/NF (x = 1, 1.2 and 1.5) of different Cobalt elemental concentration was investigated. As per preliminary experiments, Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF demonstrated the highest hydrogen production from NaBH4 among the catalysts prepared as shown in Fig. 7 (a and b). The high hydrogen production can be associated with occurrence of synergistic mechanism of nickel and cobalt and its resulting particle size [32]. Crystallite size and strain of the supported polydispersed catalysts were calculated from XRD data using Scherer equation (Dp = 0.94λ β0.5Cosϴ−1; in which ϴ is the bragg angle, Dp is the mean crystalline size and λ is the x-ray wavelength and β is the line extending in radians) onto the most intense peak around 41° indexed to (1 1 1) [44,45]. Calculated crystallite size is shown in Table 2 . The crystallite size ranges from 12 nm to 30 nm with no corresponding trend relationship between metal compositions and particle size relative on previous reports [46]. It was observed that Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF attained the smallest crystal structure among the catalysts prepared of which is correlated to its catalytic performance. 3.2.2 Effect of NaBH4 amount In contrast with the NaBH4 concentration variability (0.25%, 1.0%, 3.0% and 5.0%) and keeping both NaOH concentration and supported catalyst amount constant, it was determined that the highest turnover frequency yielded from 1.0 wt% NaBH4 concentration, as shown in Fig. 9 . The increase in hydrogen yield may be ascribed to the fact that increasing the concentration of NaBH4 would promote catalyst reactant contact [43,47]. However, this is only true on a specific concentration since it is determined from previous studies that increase in NaBH4 correspondingly increase the viscosity of the solution which hinders effective mass transfer or catalyst and reactant interaction [23,25,43]. It may also be correlated to the increase on the pH values on a concentrated NaBH4 solutions that may increase its stability [47] and decrease its solubility [35] on top of the already alkaline system due to the presence of NaOH that acts as a self-hydrolysis inhibitor. Observation imparts that the kinetics of the supported catalyst reaction utilization follows zero order with reference to NaBH4 concentration. This mechanism can be expounded by Langniur-hinshelwood model for the adoption impact process into the catalyst surface [11]. 3.2.3 Effect of temperature Investigation of temperature influence onto the catalytic reaction was done by ranging the reaction temperature from 318 K to 388 K spectrum using 1 wt% NaBH4, 1 wt% NaOH solution and 6 mg supported catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. It can be easily interpreted that the increase in temperature is directly proportional to the increase in hydrogen generation as projected in Fig. 10 . The corresponding Arrhenius relation is interpreted by plotting the reciprocal of different temperature condition against the logarithmic of the turn over frequency. The calculated NaBH4 hydrolysis activation energy is 38.3 kJ mol−1, which is favorably similar to some supported metal catalysts shown on Table 3 . 3.2.4 Effect of catalysts amount The hydrolysis performance of Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF in association with variable catalyst amount and alkaline NaBH4 solution concentration was expounded to interpret its reaction kinetics. By varying the application size of supported catalyst directly grown on Ni foam (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg, respectively) and keeping both NaOH and NaBH4 concentration constant at 1.0 wt% and 1.0 wt% hydrogen generation volume versus hydrolysis time was plotted with different catalysts amount application, it was determined that the rate of hydrogen production is directly proportional to the catalyst content as shown in Fig. 8. The linearity relation response was further confirmed by plotting the logarithmic scale of both turnover frequency and catalyst loading amount. The rate dependency towards the catalyst content exhibiting the kinetics of the reaction is of first order. 3.2.5 Recyclability performance Recyclability is one of the superior concern for the large-scale utilization feasibility of supported heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, catalytic experiments were done accordingly under atmospheric condition at 298 K using 1.0 wt% NaBH4 and 1.0 wt% NaOH with the presence of Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF catalysts. As displayed in Fig. 11 (a), Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF had a decrease in the activity upon the 5th cycle but denoted a reasonable catalytic effectiveness with fairly uniform initial rate increments upon each cycle. XRD patterns are perceived after the recyclability test shown on Fig. 11(b). There are no degradation and by product formation and adherence that may alter its catalytic effectiveness. Performance reduction may be attributed to the slight catalyst material lost upon each recyclability application. Mass loss was discerned from 6 mg to 5.28 mg upon the 5th cycle utilization. Mass decrease may be due to leaching of some catalyst particles due to evolution of massive amount of hydrogen on the supported catalyst surface during hydrolysis. 3.2.6 Performance comparability Ni0.8Co1.2P/NF 3D urchin-like supported catalyst demonstrated an outstanding TOF performance (Table 3) compared to various singular and bimetallic phosphidized supported catalyst conceived in different synthesis route such as electrodeposition and electroless plating on various support media. The high performance can be attributed based on the following rationale: (1) 3D nanostructure arrangement expedited the diffusion of the catalyst and hydrogen; (2) direct growth of the urchin-like catalyst onto the substrate eliminate agglomeration in the hydrogen generation system and promotes robust catalysts adhesion; (3) prominent exposure of active sites."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we successfully obtained a monolithic ternary 3D NiCoP urchin like nanostructure in which nickel foam serves as a porous support following a facile step of hydrothermal and phosphidation synthesis strategy. Variation on the mole concentration of the salt precursor ratio, NiCoP gives the excellent catalysts performance for alkaline NaBH4 hydrolysis yielding an initial turn over frequency of 3986 mL min−1 g−1 (with 1 wt% NaBH4 and 1 wt% NaOH solution) and low activation energy of 38.3 kJ/mol on ambient environment. High catalytic performance is affirmed on the advantage of ternary system, rational metal synergistic effect, morphological structure and discourage catalyst aggregation."
