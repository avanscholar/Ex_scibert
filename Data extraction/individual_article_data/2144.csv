0,Introduction,"Regarding the dwindling resources of fossil fuels, the exploitation of alternative fuels and chemicals from abundant and renewable biomass is attracting more and more attentions [1]. Alkyl levulinates (ALs), which have been identified as one of top ten biorefinery candidates, are a kind of promising renewable fuel additives and platform chemicals for the synthesis of angelica lactone, GVL, valerates, as well as good building blocks [2,3]. Generally, ALs were produced by direct esterification of levulinic acid (LA) over acidic catalysts or enzymatic methods [4,5], however, in the production of LA, its separation and purification are costly, which made it unsuitable for as the raw material for this purpose [6]. Recently, great efforts were devoted to develop new methods to produce ALs from various feedstocks, such as raw biomass [7], carbohydrates [8–16], 5-hydroxymethyl furfural or furfural [17–20], and furfuryl alcohol (FA) [3,21–28]. Among them, FA is a promising starting material due to its easy accessibility from furfural by reduction of its aldehyde function. Besides, each year around 62% of furfural was used for FA production, however, it’s not fully utilized and is oversupplied in the chemical market [6,29]. Thus, the development of a feasible and competitive pathway for FA upgrading is strongly demanded. It has been reported that acidic catalysts are crucial to the alcoholysis of FA to ALs. Based on this point of view, various homogeneous catalysts such as mineral acids [7,23], salts [21,22,30], ionic liquids [6,8,11], and also heterogeneous catalysts, such as ion-exchanged resins [23,31], oxides [32,33] and zeolites [23,32,34,35], have been concretely investigated. Due to the advantages of less corrosion, easy handle and separation, the exploration of heterogeneous catalysts is progressing satisfactorily in recent years. For example, Song et al. have synthesised a series of arylsulfonic acid functionalized hollow mesoporous carbon spheres catalysts, and successfully applied them into the ethanolysis of FA, which gave the best EL yield of ca.80% at 120 °C for 2 h [36]. Furthermore, they fabricated some ethane-bridged organosilica nanotubes functionalized catalysts (labelled as ArSO3H-Si(Et)Si-Ph-NTs), which furnished a good EL yield of 84% and reusability [37]. Rao et al. developed a series of zinc exchanged tungstophosphoric acid supported on niobia catalysts. It was found that the acidity of the catalysts depended on the amount of Zn ions exchanged, which played a key role on the activity of the catalysts [26]. More recently, Kong et al. reported Fe modified zeolite USY as an efficient catalyst for the ethanolysis of FA to EL (ca. 91% yield). Different from Zn exchanged catalysts, the strong acidic sites of USY were sharply reduced after Fe modification, but concomitant large amount of weak acidic sites generated [38]. They suggested that the decrease of strong acidic sites suppressed side reactions, and the enhanced weak acidic sites guaranteed the activity of the catalyst. However, despite of these promising results, several defects of these above-mentioned catalysts, such as the complex preparation process, the cost, environmental concerns, limited their applications to some extent. Additionally, microwave-irradiations have been recognized as an efficient and green method to facilitate chemical reactions to achieve higher yield and selectivity in shorter reaction times [39–43]. Recent study has shown that microwave heating could improve the reaction rate of FA methanolysis to methyl levulinate (ML) 6 times when compared to conventional heating method [30]. Combining these two aspects, it’s appealing to explore some cheaper, greener, more efficient and accessible catalysts for upgrading FA to ALs under microwave irradiations. In the present paper, we report an efficient catalytic approach for the conversion of FA to AL over commercial available activated carbon under the assistance of microwave irradiation. The catalyst loading and reaction temperature have great influence on ML yield and the formation rate. Control experiments and different spectroscopic techniques were also conducted to better understand the catalyst performance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfuryl alchohol (≥ 98%), methanol (≥ 99.9%), ethanol (≥ 99.5%), n-propanol (≥ 99.5%), iso-propanol (≥ 99.5%), n-butanol (≥ 99.5%), methyl levulinate (99%), n-decane (≥ 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and further used without purification. The catalysts HY5.2, HY60, HZSM-5-30 and HZSM-5-50 were purchased from Zeolytes International (USA). The zeolite materials were calcined at 600 °C during 24 h prior to use. Activated carbon (Charcoal activated power, technical grade) was purchased from Panreac (Spain), and sulfonated carbon was prepared according to literature [44]."
3,General procedure for the microwave-assisted synthesis of alkyl levulinate,"2.2 General procedure for the microwave-assisted synthesis of alkyl levulinate FA (0.2 M, 3 mL) feedstock solution and activated carbon (100 mg) were introduced in a 10 mL vial closed with a septum. 2 min ramping time was settled to reach desired reaction temperature. All of the experiments were performed in a microwave reactor (CEM discover) and stirred under magnetic stirring (600 rpm) for the desired time. The reaction temperature was measured by means of IR sensor. At the end of the reaction, the solution was filtered prior to analysis through a syringe filter (PTFE, 0.22 μm, VWR)."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis GC-FID analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph (HP, 14009 Arcade, New York, United States) coupled with a FID detector equipped with a Supelco 2-8047-U capillary column (15 m x0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 μm film thickness, Alltech Part No.31163-01). H2 was used as carrier gas at 1 mL min−1 flow rate. The samples were injected directly onto the column using septum-equipped programmable injector (SPI) system. The temperature of the injector was set 250 °C and the oven started at 80 °C, held for 5 min, raised to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C min-1, held for 5 min and then raised to 120 °C at a rate of 10 °C min-1 and held for 10 min at 120 °C. The ionization mode was FID (70 eV, 300 μA, 250 °C). The identification of the compounds was performed by comparison of the retention times with pure standards and by GC/MS analysis. First, calibration curves for FA and ML were determined in the 0–100 mg mL−1 range, using n-decane (5.0 mg mL−1) as the internal standard (see ESI Fig. S1). The yield and conversion in continuous flow were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) Y i e l d % = C P P r o d u c t C M L F e e d × 100 (2) C o n v e r s i o n % = C M L I n i t i a l - C M L F i n a l C M L I n i t i a l × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst activity screening experiments,"3.1 Catalyst activity screening experiments Firstly, the effect of different kinds of acidic catalysts on the alcoholysis of FA was studied at 150 °C for 5 min in methanol while keeping the same amount of catalyst (50 mg) under microwave irradiation. Conversion of FA without catalyst was very low (18%), and no desired product ML was formed, however, FA achieved fully conversion with other catalysts, even with commercial AC (Fig. 1 ). Surprisingly, AC gave a comparable ML yield (36%) with zeolite catalysts HY5.2 (41%) and HY60 (30%). More interestingly, lots of methoxymethyl furan (MmF), which was considered as the intermediate from FA to ALs, has been produced (Scheme 1 ). This means a higher ML yield could be reached with AC as the catalyst by optimizing the reaction conditions appropriately. Pleasingly, 55% of ML was obtained with AC (100 mg), while MmF yield relatively decreased to 22% from 39%. In this case, ML yield is even higher than HZSM-5-30 (50 mg) and slightly lower than HZSM-5-50 (50 mg) which gave 54% and 60% ML yield respectively. It should be noted that HZSM catalysts gave quite amount of α-angelica lactone as the major side-product, which has been identified by GC–MS. In spite of the home-made sulfonated carbon (SC) presented the best catalytic performance on ML production (77% yield), the results with commercial AC seems more attractive as its commercial accessible. Therefore, these results highlight that commercial ACs could replace common acid catalysts for AL production, which convinced us to further optimize reaction parameters."
7,Influence of catalyst loading variation,"3.2 Influence of catalyst loading variation The influence of catalyst dosage on the alcoholysis of FA in dependence of time was also investigated (Table 1 ). In all cases, FA reached more than 98% conversion in 2.5 min. In the meantime, MmF was the major product, which is in line with literature, which reported that the formation rate of alkoxymethylfuran was much higher than that of alkyl levulinate [3]. The increase of reaction time and catalyst loading facilitate the conversion of methoxymethylfuran (MmF) to ML, and the best 72% ML was yielded with AC (100 mg) for 20 min (Table 1, line 17). Experiments were also carried out at 150 °C for 5 min to study the effect of water addition on ML formation. The results showed that ML yield gradually decreased from 36% to 24% with the water loading increasing to 2 eq (Table 1, lines 8–10). This effect was out of accord with the results from Zhang et al. [3], who proved that the addition of water has a positive effect on furfuryl alcohol and 2-butoxymethylfuran conversions to butyl levulinate. Our results seem more agree with the findings from Maldonado et al. [45], who demonstrated that water does not participate in the mechanism for conversion of FA to ethyl EL, as EL yield decreased with the addition of water."
8,Influence of the temperature,"3.3 Influence of the temperature The influence of temperature on the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol was studied in a range from 130 to 170 °C under batch microwave irradiations with AC (100 mg) and FA (0.2 M, 3 mL) feedstock loading (Fig. 2 ). Almost complete conversion was achieved as the temperature increased from 130 °C to 170 °C at time 0, which means FA was fully consumed when heating process finished. This could be attributed to the effect of microwave irradiations that significantly accelerate the reaction rate [30]. When compared the results obtained at 150 °C (Table 1), we can conclude that higher reaction temperature benefits to higher ML yield, and simultaneously shortened reaction time. For example, a relative stable ML yield of 78% was achieved in 5 min at 170 °C, which is higher than that of 67% at 150 °C for 10 min (Table 1, entry 16) and 36% at 130 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2). Moreover, lower reaction temperature would limit the consumption rate of MmF to ML. Therefore, in order to diminish the reaction time the temperature was fixed at 170 °C for further investigation."
9,Influence of FA loading variation,"3.4 Influence of FA loading variation The concentration of the starting material, FA, is a key factor with great influence on most of chemical reactions. Actually, FA polymerization or polycondensation could be easily occurred in acidic environment [46,47]. Thus, the effect of FA concentration at 0.1 M and 0.4 M were investigated within various reaction time periods (0–10 min) (Fig. 3 ). With a lower concentration of FA (0.1 M), the yield of ML increased to 83% in 7.5 min. It’s notable that better ML yield was obtained is a short reaction time when a higher concentration of FA was used (0.4 M vs 0.1 M at t = 0 min and 2.5 min). MmF yield was higher in lower concentration of FA whatever the reaction time used. It seems that higher FA loading did a favour to convert MmF to ML more rapidly, but gave lower ML yield when prolonged reaction time to 10 min. Generally, the polymerization of FA to oligomeric compounds at a high concentration should response to the decrease of ML yield [48]."
10,Scope of the reaction,"3.5 Scope of the reaction Under optimized conditions (FA (0.2 M, 3 mL), AC (100 mg), MW, 170 °C, 5 min), the alcoholysis of FA using different alkyl alcohols was studied. With the increase of the alcohol chain length, the yield of ALs slightly decreased from 78% to 64% with methanol and n-butanol, respectively (Fig. 4 ). With branch alcohol iso-propanol, 39% of iso-propyl levulinate yield was relatively lower than that with linear alcohol n-propanol (66%). One can notice that more intermediate was left with iso-propanol. In our hands, conversion to iso-propyl levulinate is more difficult, which was probably caused by steric effects and the nature of the hydroxyl group(OHII) [22]. The tendency is consistent with the literatures [22,25,49], and these results suggest that AC has a universal catalytic ability for the alcoholysis of FA, and the high activity is comparable with Al2(SO4)3 which gave 65% butyl levulinate yield in 40 min when heated to 150 °C by microwave [30]."
11,Catalyst reusability,"3.6 Catalyst reusability Recycling of the catalyst is an important step for a sustainable and economically feasible catalytic system. Therefore, the recycle experiments for AC catalyst were also carried out at 170 °C for 5 min in ethanol. After each reaction the catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with ethanol for three times and dried at 100 °C for the next catalytic reaction. Evidently, the catalyst activity severely decreased at the second run, as FA conversion decreased from 99% to 62% and EL yield dropped to 12% from 74% (Fig. 5 ). To understand the deactivation of the catalyst, two control experiments were performed (control test 1 and control test 2). One experiment was conducted without FA as starting material under optimized conditions. After 5 min under microwave irradiation and then centrifugation and filtration furnished two separated phases: a liquid solution and a solid. The liquid solution was recharged with FA (0.6 mmol) and decane (0.015 g), and then the mixture was heated under MW at 170 °C for 5 min (control test 1). The control test 2 was performed using the optimized conditions with the recovered solid (after 3 times washing and dry) instead of the pure AC. Control test 1 indicated that some active species of AC were extracted into ethanol phase since EL was obtained in 61% yield. Consequently, the recovered solid (control test 2) gave poor EL and EmF yields due to leaching. Furthermore, the comparison between control test 2 and run 2 probably implied that some other factors may attribute to the catalyst decay, for example, oligomeric compounds formed by FA polymerization covered some acidic groups etc. From this point of view, the AC seems more like homogeneous catalyst. To better understand the catalytic activity of this kind of commercial activated carbon, BET, EDS, ICP-MS and acid-base properties of the AC and spent ACs were measured (Table 2 ). No big changes in the porosity and surface area of the carbons were observed by BET. However, EDS gave us a clear clue that species containing ‘sulphur’ possibly attribute to the activity, and ca. 42% of average atomic was leached after first run. This phenomenon consisted with the study of Zhu et al. who identified the surface SO3H groups on graphene oxide were the primary active sites, and the surface carboxyl groups worked synergistically during the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol [50]. More concretely, these kinds of carbon materials contain a variety of oxygen-containing functionalities, such as −OH, −COOH, and −SO3H etc. Among them, hydroxyl groups were considered no contribution to the catalyst activity, but carboxyl groups could help the absorption of FA on the catalyst surface via hydrogen bonding, which will do a favour for the conversion of FA to ALs. Similarly, Antunes et al. also proved that oxygen-containing groups on carbon materials played a role in the catalytic conversion of HMF to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural, 5-(ethoxymethyl)furfural diethylacetal and ethyl levulinate [17]. Rigorously, EDS analysis couldn’t give a very accurate result, therefore, we also titrated the acidic and basic groups on these samples following the literature [51]. The results are in line well with EDS analysis as ˜ 0.7 mmol/g acidic groups were lost after first run. Besides, no apparently basic groups leaching were observed. Further treating AC with ethanol and water in presence of 0.2 M furfuryl alcohol at 170 °C for 1 h without MW offered 0.6 mmol g−1 and 0.9 mmol g−1 acidic groups leaching respectively, which agreed with our results with microwave. Simultaneously, when treating AC (1.5 g) with water (20 mL) at 170 °C for 1 h, ICP-MS analysis of the filtrate showed that no significant amounts of metals leached to water, only Ni content is at about 300 ppm. Thus, we speculate that the ‘active species’ is possibly the acidic organosulfates on the activated carbon, and the deactivation of the catalyst was due to the poor thermal stability of these organosulfates groups."
12,Reaction pathway and plausible mechanism,"3.7 Reaction pathway and plausible mechanism According to literatures, multiple pathways have been proposed for the formation of AL from FA, including some key intermediates, such as MmF and 4,5,5-trimethoxypentan-2-one (TMP). Besides, one possible mechanism was regarding to aldehydration of FA to α-angelica lactone, which was in turn readily attacked by alcohols to form AL [52]. However, in our case, we proposed a plausible mechanism concerning MmF as the key intermediate (Scheme 2 ). Because one can obviously notice that MmF is the major intermediate (identified by GC–MS, see ESI Figure S1), which token 77% yield at 0 min with AC (100 mg) (Table 1, line 13), and this routes seems more reasonable as lower energy was needed for the formation of alkoxymethylfuran [53]. After elimination in acidic conditions, intermediate A could form compound B0 using two different pathways: way 1 in the presence of aqueous methanol and way 2 in methanol without water. These two ways are in accordance with the mechanism reported by Maldonado et al. [45]. The reaction barrier with water (from A to B0) was higher than that without water (from A to B). This could explain why the yield of ML decreased and MmF yield increased when additional water was introduced (Table 1). Then, B0 was formed from B by releasing a molecule methoxymethane, and after the addition with 3 eq. methanol in one or two steps, the most important intermediate TMP could be produced. However, no peak of TMP was found in GC or GC–MS in the present work, but some species (C and D) with similar structure to TMP were identified by GC–MS (see ESI Fig. S1 × 2 and X3). However, the species X1 and X4 (see ESI Fig. S1) may suggest that complex multiple pathways of FA alcoholysis are possible."
13,Conclusion,"Commercial non-metal activated carbon was proved as an efficient catalyst for the production of ALs by alcoholysis of FA under microwave irradiations. Upon the optimization, 78% of ML yield was obtained in 5 min, which is comparable to the results of most literatures. The study of catalyst reusability indicated that acidic groups containing ‘sulphur’ on AC could be easily extracted. Regardless of its poor stability, this method is environmentally benign and economical for the conversion of biomass-based derivatives into fine chemicals, because the catalyst is quite cheap and commercially available."
