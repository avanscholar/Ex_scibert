0,Introduction,"Conventional energy sources have sustained the world energy demand over the decades. Concerning the current situations such as depletion of traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources, development of various alternative energy sources is required [1,2]. In this respect, hydrogen is considered as a competitive and novel energy source. Hydrogen not only exhibits reliability as an energy resource but also shows notable efficiency [3,4]. In particular, hydrogen serves as a fuel for various energy-converting systems such as fuel cells [5,6]. Hydrogen production processes can vary from electrochemical methods (H2O electrolysis) to photo-biological routes, but the primary source of industrial-scale hydrogen production comes from conversion of various hydrocarbons and oxygenates via steam reforming process [7–9]. Steam reforming process uses a wide range of feeds such as natural gas, alcohols, and other heavier compounds like gasoline. Although steam reforming of natural gas comprises the highest portion of worldwide hydrogen production procedures, natural gas steam reforming process has drawbacks in terms of sustainability and eco-friendliness because it exploits fossil-fuel based non-renewable sources [1,7]. On the other hand, the use of ethanol feed for steam reforming process is beneficial because ethanol is more eco-friendly, relatively less severe in hazardousness, and much easier to handle than conventional fossil fuels [10–12]. Due to these advantages, ethanol steam reforming has attracted much attention as an alternative method for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production. In order to maximize efficiency and stability of hydrogen production in the ethanol steam reforming, numerous catalytic systems have been studied [13–16]. Supported metal catalysts have been mainly used in the steam reforming of ethanol, where noble metals such as Rh, Pt, and Au are proven to be the most promising catalysts. However, these noble metals are economically unfeasible and are prone to suffer from sintering at elevated temperatures [12]. Therefore, transition metal-based steam reforming catalysts such as nickel and cobalt have been widely studied [17,18]. In particular, nickel catalysts supported on alumina (Ni/Al2O3) have been extensively investigated, because nickel is reasonable in catalytic activity and price while alumina is a stable material where active nickel can be well dispersed on [19,20]. However, these catalysts still face challenges of suffering from deactivation caused by coke formation and metal sintering [21,22]. Catalytic activity can be modified by introducing an additional element or by modifying catalyst preparation method. One of the major methods attempted to enhance the performance of nickel-based steam reforming catalysts is the formation of bimetallic catalysts by introducing a second active metal. Studies concerning the beneficial effect of adding a second metal such as Fe and Cu have been reported, where iron enhanced nickel dispersion and coke resistance while copper enhanced hydrogen yield by facilitating water-gas shift reaction [23,24]. Various Ni-Co-based catalytic systems have been studied as well, where hydrogen yield and stability of the catalysts were enhanced with low selectivity for CH4 by-product [25,26]. Another approach for the improvement of catalytic activity includes the modification of alumina support. The addition of various elements ranging from alkaline earth metal to rare earth metal has been investigated to see the effect of such modification on the catalytic activity and stability. These metal oxides are known to have basic characteristics, and thus, they are used as modifiers to neutralize the acid sites of alumina support [27]. When Ni/Al2O3 was stabilized with ZrO2, for example, the capacity for water adsorption and dissociation was enhanced on the steam reforming catalyst, leading to a more promising result [28]. Nickel catalysts supported on calcium-modified alumina resulted in attenuated acidity and coke deposition [29]. CeO2, an oxide known for its high oxygen conductivity, was also studied as a support material for steam reforming catalysts [30,31]. Ceria was proven to be beneficial in improving redox properties of active metal species, facilitating water-gas shift reaction and coke removal. Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) with a basic property has been applied as a modifier to the catalytic systems for steam reforming process [32,33]. The distinctive property of lanthanum oxide is anticipated to neutralize the acidic sites and to enhance the stability of alumina support. In addition, La2O3 is expected to contribute in surface carbon removal by forming lanthanum oxycarbonate (La2O2CO3) species [34,35]. La2O3 reacts with CO2 by-product, which is formed during the steam reforming process, to produce La2O2CO3. The so-formed La2O2CO3 subsequently reacts with surface coke (C) to yield La2O3 and CO. The introduction of lanthanum species is also reported to result in smaller-sized active metal particles, boosting the catalytic activity for hydrogen production [36]. However, lanthanum oxide has a hygroscopic nature, making it recommendable for applications in a mixed oxide form with other stable materials like alumina [34]. In this work, a series of Ni/Al2O3-La2O3 xerogel catalysts with different La/Al molar ratio was prepared and characterized. The effect of lanthanum modification of alumina support on the characteristics and catalytic activities of Ni/Al2O3-La2O3 xerogel catalysts in the hydrogen production by steam reforming of ethanol was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Ni/Al2O3-La2O3 xerogel catalysts were prepared by the following methods. A series of Al2O3-La2O3 mixed oxide supports with different La/Al molar ratio were preliminarily prepared via an epoxide-initiated sol-gel method. 6g of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and a known amount of lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were dissolved in an absolute ethanol solvent (30ml). After obtaining the transparent solution with Al and La precursors, propylene oxide (15ml, Samchun, 99%) which acts as a proton scavenger and a gelation agent was introduced into the solution. A translucent composite gel was obtained within a few minutes. The gel was then aged at room temperature for 2 days. The aged gel was placed in a convection oven at 80°C for solvent evaporation for 5 days. The resultant was grinded into powder. It was then calcined by elevating furnace temperature to 550°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min, and it was kept for 5h under oxidizing conditions to yield Al2O3-La2O3 mixed oxide xerogel support. The prepared supports were denoted as Al-xLa (x=0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2), where x represented the molar ratio of La/Al. For nickel impregnation, a known amount of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was dissolved in 20ml of deionized water. Al-xLa supports were introduced into the aqueous solution containing nickel precursor at 80°C for wetness impregnation. The resultant was calcined with the same procedures used for the support (5h and 550°C). The obtained catalysts were denoted as Ni/Al-xLa (x=0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2), where the amount of nickel was fixed at 15wt%. For comparison and reference, a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with no lanthanum was also prepared via the same procedures mentioned above (denoted as Ni/Al-0La)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained with a BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) device. Prior to the nitrogen adsorption, catalyst samples were evacuated at 150°C for 4h to eliminate any impurities on the catalyst surface. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) methods were applied to the isotherm plots to calculate specific surface areas of the catalysts. Chemical compositions of the catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy) analyses with an ICPS-100IV (Shimadzu) device. The molar ratio of La/Al and nickel loading were calculated from the so-obtained results. 27Al MAS NMR (magicangle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were obtained with an AVANCE 400 WB spectrometer. Operating resonance frequency was 104MHz, while MAS frequency was fixed at 10kHz. XRD (X-ray diffraction) profiles were obtained with a D-Max2500-PC (Rigaku) device. Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.541Å) was used as X-ray source, and the apparatus was maintained on 50kV and 100mA operating conditions. The range of 2θ was changed from 20° to 80° during the measurements. TPR (temperature-programmed reduction) profiles were acquired with a gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin). For the measurement, 50mg of each calcined catalyst was purged under a mixed flow of hydrogen (2ml/min) and nitrogen (20ml/min). Furnace temperature was raised to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 10°C/min, while the signal for hydrogen consumption was obtained with an attached thermal conductivity detector (TCD). TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images of reduced and used catalysts were taken with a JEM-2000EXII (Jeol) device. The samples were dispersed in an ethanol media, and it was then supported on copper grids for the analysis. H2-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) was carried out with a BELCAT-B (BEL Japan) apparatus, and desorption profiles were obtained with a TCD. For the measurement, 50mg of each calcined catalyst was reduced with a mixed flow of 5% hydrogen/argon (50ml/min) at 700°C for 1h. Hydrogen was adsorbed on the catalyst surface by flowing 5% hydrogen/argon flow (50ml/min) at 50°C for 1h until the catalyst was saturated. Furnace temperature was then increased to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min under an argon flow (30ml/min). NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and EtOH-TPD profiles were acquired using a mass spectrometric detector (6890N GC-5975MSD, Agilent). Prior to the adsorption, 50mg of each calcined catalyst was reduced at 700°C for 1h with a hydrogen flow (3ml/min) diluted with a helium flow (30ml/min). Then the adsorption of chemical species was done at room temperature by injecting 20ml of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and vaporized ethanol into the reactor for 10 repetitive times for saturation, respectively. Physisorbed chemical species on the catalyst surface were removed by degassing the samples at 100°C for 1h using a vacuum pump. Desorption took place as the furnace temperature was increased from room temperature to 700°C at a ramping rate of 10°C/min under a flow of helium (10ml/min). The following m/z values were attributed to respective desorbed species; 16, 17, 28, 29, 31, and 44 for CH4, NH3, CO, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, and CO2. The amount of carbon deposition on the used catalyst was quantified with CHNS elemental analyses, where a CHNS 932 (Leco) apparatus was used. TPO (temperature-programmed oxidation) analyses were conducted with the identical apparatus used for TPR analyses. For the measurement, 20mg of each used catalyst was purged under a mixed flow of oxygen (2ml/min) and helium (20ml/min). TPO signals were collected using a TCD by increasing furnace temperature from room temperature to 700°C with a ramping rate of 10°C/min."
4,Steam reforming of ethanol,"2.3 Steam reforming of ethanol The prepared Ni/Al-xLa (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) catalysts were applied to the hydrogen production by steam reforming of ethanol using a packed-bed reactor. The reaction was carried out at 450°C for 15h under atmospheric pressure. 100mg of each calcined catalyst was reduced in-situ at 700°C for 1h prior to the reaction under a mixed flow of hydrogen (3ml/min) and nitrogen (30ml/min). Deionized water and ethanol was mixed in a molar ratio of 6: 1 (S/C ratio=3), and the mixture was continuously injected using a syringe pump. During the reaction, 30ml/min of nitrogen was also supplied into the reactor as a carrier gas. GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) was maintained at 23,140ml/hgcat. The inlet and outlet lines of the reactor were heated to 220°C for complete vaporization of reactant species. The reaction products were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) attached with a TCD. Molecular Sieve 5A and Porapak N columns were connected in a series for product separation. The following equations represent the methods used to calculate ethanol conversion, hydrogen yield, and product selectivity, where ni represents the stoichiometric factor of various carbon-containing by-products in Eq.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of calcined catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of calcined catalysts According to the results of nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts, it was obvious that all the calcined catalysts showed type-IV isotherms and type-H2 hysteresis loops as shown in Fig. 1 . This indicates that all the catalysts retained well-developed mesopores, where the adsorbed species went through capillary condensation within the mesoporous structure [37]. Hysteresis loops of type-H2 are the characteristics of ‘ink-bottle’ shape pores, which are anticipated to originate from the conventional drying method used in this work. Evaporation of ethanol solvent causes interfacial tension between liquid and vapor, resulting in a partial rearrangement of preliminarily formed mesoporous structure to form so-called ‘bottle-shape’ pores [38]. As the content of lanthanum increased, the height of limiting nitrogen uptake decreased, indicating that pore volume within the catalyst structure shifted to smaller value. Considering that the steepness of isotherm during the capillary condensation process indicates uniformity of mesopores, it is believed that Ni/Al-0.2La, whose isotherm exhibits the most gradual form, retains a relatively non-uniform mesoporous structure [39]. Table 1 shows the surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of calcined Ni/Al-xLa catalysts. Chemical compositions of Ni, Al, and La within the catalysts were determined by ICP-AES analyses. It was confirmed that actual molar ratio of La/Al and Ni content of the catalysts were close to the designed values. All Ni/Al-xLa catalysts within the series showed high surface area (>90m2/g) and large pore volume (>0.17cm3/g). Average pore diameters were within the mesoporous range for all catalysts. Surface area of the catalysts decreased with increasing La/Al molar ratio from 193m2/g (Ni/Al-0La) to 90m2/g (Ni/Al-0.2La). It is reported that La exists in atomically dispersed form over alumina under concentration of 8.5μmol/m2 [40]. In this respect, Ni/Al-xLa catalysts with large amount of lanthanum were found to be disadvantageous in terms of physicochemical properties. Lanthanum, which has relatively large atomic radius, may act as a hindrance to mesoporous structure of the catalyst when substantial amount of lanthanum is introduced [41,42]. Pore volume and average pore diameter showed a similar trend with surface area. These values also decreased with increasing La/Al molar ratio of the catalysts. Chemical states of aluminum species in the calcined Ni/Al-xLa catalysts were examined by 27Al MAS NMR. Fig. 2 shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of calcined catalysts, where three dominant domains can be observed in all the samples. Coordination state of Al species exists in three forms in transition alumina; tetra-coordinated (AlIV), penta-coordinated (AlV), and octa-coordinated (AlVI) aluminum which shows resonance at around 67ppm, 50ppm, and 8.5ppm, respectively [43]. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were separated into these three separate domains, and the relative distribution of respective aluminum species with various coordination states was calculated as listed in Table 2 . As the content of lanthanum increased, the portion of octa-coordinated Al species decreased while that of tetra- and penta-coordinated Al species increased. It is known that tetra- and penta-coordinated Al sites are ‘coordinately unsaturated’, and they originate from the cross-linking of octa-coordinated species, leading to a more defective and a vacant structure [44,45]. Thus, it is inferred that the formation of Al-O-La links, which had originated during the oxolation process of sol-gel method, led to the formation of more coordinately unsaturated Al species (tetra- and penta-coordinated Al) with increasing La content [42,45]. It is also reported that the existence of AlIV species at around 60ppm hints the formation of amorphous lanthanum aluminate in the Al2O3-La2O3 binary oxides, suggesting partial incorporation of La into the alumina lattice [46]. H2-TPR profiles of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . All the catalysts showed a major reduction band around 650–670°C. In addition, Ni/Al-0La, Ni/Al-0.05La, and Ni/Al-0.1La catalysts exhibited a shoulder peak at higher temperature above 700°C. On the other hand, Ni/Al-0.15La and Ni/Al-0.2La samples showed an additional shoulder peak at lower temperature. The major reduction band was attributed to the reduction of surface NiO bonded to Al-xLa support [47]. Shoulder peaks occurring at high temperature region were anticipated to originate from the reduction of nickel aluminate species [48]. Reduction peaks with low peak temperature observed for Ni/Al-0.15La and Ni/Al-0.2La catalysts were attributed to bulk NiO [49]. It can be deduced that a portion of NiO, which was excluded from Al-xLa support, formed a bulk phase in the catalysts containing substantial amount of La within the alumina lattice. Any peaks related to the direct reduction of lanthanum species were not observed."
7,Characterization of reduced catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of reduced catalysts After reducing Ni/Al-xLa catalysts at 700°C for 1h, XRD profiles were obtained to investigate the crystalline phases of the samples as shown in Fig. 4 . Diffraction peaks ascribed to metallic nickel could be observed after reduction. The reduced Ni/Al-0La sample still retained γ-Al2O3 diffraction peaks. It should be noted that the peak intensity for metallic nickel decreased with increasing La/Al molar ratio. That is, nickel particle size became smaller when more lanthanum was introduced onto alumina. To quantitatively analyze the crystalline size of nickel particles, the Scherrer equation was applied to the Ni (1 1 1) diffraction peak in Fig. 4 as presented in Table 3 . The particle size of metallic nickel gradually decreased from 8.1nm (Ni/Al-0La) to 5.7nm (Ni/Al-0.2La), indicating that nickel was more finely dispersed on the sample with higher La content. These results were complemented with TEM images as shown in Fig. 5 . Nickel particles were well dispersed on the AL-xLa support, but particle size distributions revealed that more than half of nickel particles on Ni/Al-0La retained diameters larger than 15nm. On the other hand, nickel particles of Ni/Al-0.1La shifted to smaller diameters. No nickel crystallites on Ni/Al-0.2La were larger than 15nm, and Ni/Al-0.2La showed the most narrow particle size distribution. Similar results involving the enhancement of nickel dispersion with lanthanum addition were previously reported [50,51]. This might originate from the strain caused by lanthanum species in the alumina lattice, leading to smaller-sized nickel. Basicity and acidity of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts were determined by CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD analyses, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 . It was observed that basicity (peak area) of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts increased with increasing lanthanum content (Fig. 6(a)). All the samples exhibited a large peak at around 200–250°C, and this peak temperature shifted to higher temperature with increasing lanthanum content. Another shoulder/satellite peaks were observed at higher temperature. Thus, it can be inferred that the addition of La enhanced basic property and CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalysts. CO2, which is desorbed at low temperatures, might originate from basic sites with relatively weak strength such as surface hydroxyl groups [52]. Desorption band occurring at high temperature might be due to the existence of strong basic sites such as carbonates in the unidentate form [53]. On the other hand, peak area of NH3-TPD profiles decreased in the order of Ni/Al-0La>Ni/Al-0.1La>Ni/Al-0.2La (Fig. 6(b)). This indicates that acidic property of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts was weakened with increasing lanthanum content. The profiles showed a broad desorption band reaching temperature higher than 600°C, indicating the existence of diverse acidic sites with different strength. In the case of Ni/Al-0.2La, an additional desorption peak was observed at high temperature region. La2O3 is known as an oxide with basic nature due to its lattice oxygen sites [54]. The decrease of catalyst acidity with increasing lanthanum content may be due to the result of titration process between original acid sites and introduced La2O3 [55]. However, introduction of La species may cause another effect on catalyst acidity. As shown in 27Al MAS NMR results (Fig. 2), the formation of binary aluminum-lanthanum oxide leads to the increase of coordinately unsaturated Al species within the defective structure. These under-coordinated aluminum serves as a Lewis acid site of alumina, which can act as an enhancing factor for catalyst acidity [55,56]. The reduction of exposed surface area of the catalysts with La addition (Table 1) may also contribute to the eventually weakened acidic property. It was revealed that dispersion of nickel was enhanced when it was supported on binary aluminum-lanthanum support with high La content, as shown in XRD patterns (Fig. 4) and TEM images (Fig. 5). To quantify nickel surface area of the catalysts, H2-TPD profiles were obtained as shown in Fig. 7 . All the catalysts showed several desorption peaks over diverse temperature regions. Before conducting quantitative analysis of H2-TPD profiles, it should be noted that hydrogen desorption peak occurring at sufficiently high temperatures (>700°C) originates from the support or the subsurface layers within the catalyst [57,58]. For quantitative analysis, H2-TPD profiles were separated into four separate domains. These four domains were successively notated as I–IV in the order of increasing peak temperature. Domain IV (the desorption band occurring at temperature above 700°C) with the highest peak temperature was ascribed to H2 species that desorbed from the support and the subsurface layer caused by spillover. On the other hand, the other remaining domains which occurred at lower temperatures (I, II, and III) were considered to come from H2 species that was initially adsorbed on metallic nickel sites. Therefore, only these three domains were taken into account when calculating the nickel surface area as presented in Table 4 . The total amount of hydrogen desorbed and nickel surface area increased with increasing lanthanum content from 15.4m2/g-Ni (Ni/Al-0La) to 23.2m2/g-Ni (Ni/Al-0.2La). This result was in good agreement with XRD (Fig. 4) and TEM (Fig. 5) results, because the enhanced nickel dispersion led to smaller nickel particle size and higher nickel surface area."
8,EtOH-TPD analyses on the reduced catalysts,"3.3 EtOH-TPD analyses on the reduced catalysts The traits of ethanol desorption on the reduced Ni/Al-xLa are presented in Fig. 8 . Ethanol adsorbed on the catalyst surface at room temperature can take diverse forms during temperature-programmed desorption due to multiple side reactions. The desorption profiles shown in this figure indicate the total signal for various reaction intermediates, such as C2H5OH, CH3CHO, CH4, CO, and CO2. EtOH-TPD profiles of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts showed an approximatively similar trend in terms of overall shape. A dominant initial peak was observed at around 200–300°C, followed by an additional broad peak reaching up to 600°C. When ethanol is adsorbed on the surface of metallic nickel, it is converted into an ethoxide form (Eq. (4)). Sequential dehydrogenation (cleavage of CH bond, Eq. (5)) and decarbonylation (cleavage of CC bond, Eq. (6)) also occur [59]. (4) CH3CH2OH→CH3CH2O* (5) CH3CH2O* →CH3CHO* →CH3CO* (6) CH3CO* →CH3 * +CO* Taking these reaction pathways into account, it can be inferred that the initial desorption peak occurring at lower temperature region is attributed to the chemical species such as ethanol (m/z=31) and acetaldehyde (m/z=29). The adsorbed ethoxide species may be desorbed in its initial form (ethanol) or go through successive CH bond cleavage to be desorbed as an acetaldehyde. Meanwhile, the broad additional peak at higher temperature is ascribed to methane (m/z=16), carbon monoxide (m/z=28), and carbon dioxide (m/z=44). When decarbonylation occurs after several dehydrogenations, methyl groups and carbon oxide species are formed as a result (Eq. (6)). Methyl groups tend to be desorbed from the catalyst surface as methane, while carbon monoxide/dioxide may also be formed due to the reaction between residual carbon and oxygen species on the catalyst surface [60]. From the fact that all Ni/Al-xLa samples showed EtOH-TPD profiles of similar form, it is believed that adsorbed ethanol on the Ni/Al-xLa catalysts goes through reaction pathways with analogous sequence. Table 5 summarizes the total amount of ethanol which initially existed on the catalyst surface before temperature elevation. For each sample, areas of TPD profiles for various reaction intermediates (C2H5OH, CH3CHO, CH4, CO, and CO2) were extracted from Fig. 8, and then they were summed up to yield the values in Table 5. Ni/Al-0La and Ni/Al-0.05La samples showed almost similar value in the amount of adsorbed ethanol, but this value gradually decreased with increasing lanthanum content from 0.62 mmol-EtOH/g-catalyst (Ni/Al-0.05La) to 0.44 mmol-EtOH/g-catalyst (Ni/Al-0.2La). When compared to H2-TPD results, the trends in nickel surface area (Table 4) and ethanol adsorption capacity (Table 5) of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts showed an opposite behavior. Ethanol is known to be capable of adsorbing onto not only active nickel sites but also alumina [61]. The catalysts with high content of La retained lower surface area of alumina support exposed, leading to the decreased amount of adsorbed ethanol. Although the addition of lanthanum into alumina benefits nickel dispersion, lanthanum can also act as a hindrance by partial coverage of nickel species [32]. Ethanol molecule is much larger in size than hydrogen, making it more vulnerable to worsened proximity for nickel sites blocked by large-sized La atoms. Small pore volume and pore diameter of the catalysts with high La content may also cause this discrepancy by hampering the adsorption/desorption process of ethanol molecules within the catalyst structure. Thus, it is concluded that affinity for ethanol in the Ni/Al-xLa catalysts was worsened with increasing La content."
9,Ethanol steam reforming activities of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts,"3.4 Ethanol steam reforming activities of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts Fig. 9 (a) shows the catalytic activity of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts in the ethanol steam reforming reaction at 450°C. Catalytic activity test was conducted for 15h. It was found that Ni/Al-0La, Ni/Al-0.05La, Ni/Al-0.1La, and Ni/Al-0.15La catalysts maintained initial catalytic performance without significant deactivation. However, Ni/Al-0.2La catalyst, which showed a considerable initial hydrogen yield, exhibited rapid deactivation after a 3 h-reaction. Comparison of catalytic performance showed that Ni/Al-0.05La, Ni/Al-0.1La, and Ni/Al-0.15La catalysts exhibited higher hydrogen yield than Ni/Al-0La catalyst. Among the catalysts, Ni/Al-0.1La catalyst showed the best performance for hydrogen yield. When hydrogen yield of the catalysts after a 15 h-reaction was plotted against the molar ratio of La/Al, a volcano-shaped curve was obtained (Fig. 9(b)). Thus, it can be inferred that an optimal value of La/Al ratio was required to maximize the catalytic activity for ethanol steam reforming. Hydrogen yield, ethanol conversion, and by-product selectivity after a 15 h-reaction are listed in Table 6 . Ethanol went through complete conversion over Ni/Al-xLa catalysts except for Ni/Al-0.2La (98.9% conversion). On the other hand, ethylene by-product was only produced on the Ni/Al-0La (11.1% selectivity). During the ethanol steam reforming reaction, it is well known that C2H4 by-product is mainly formed by dehydration of ethanol which is catalyzed on the acid sites of Al2O3 [62]. Considering that nickel catalysts supported on binary Al2O3-La2O3 supports retained a reduced acidic property when compared to La-free Ni/Al-0La catalyst, the titration process caused by the introduction of La suppressed ethanol dehydration, and thus, led to the reduced formation of C2H4. CH4 and CO2 were formed as a major carbon-containing by-products during the reaction. Selectivity for CO was gradually increased with increasing lanthanum content. Among the catalysts, Ni/Al-0.1La showed the lowest selectivity for CH4 and the highest selectivity for CO2. The volcano-shaped curve of hydrogen yield shown in Fig. 9(b) is due to the offset of two opposite trends of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts between nickel surface area and ethanol adsorption capacity. In Fig. 10 , these two factors are plotted with regard to La/Al molar ratio of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts. Catalysts containing relatively high amount of La (Ni/Al-0.15La and Ni/Al-0.2La) retained high nickel surface area which served as active sites during the reforming reaction. However, these catalysts suffer from unfavorable physicochemical properties, causing suppressed diffusion and adsorption of ethanol. This led to the failure of achieving 100% conversion of ethanol in the Ni/Al-0.2La catalyst. It is also reported that ethanol dehydrogenation is affected by active sites consisting both acid and base sites [63]. The decrease of acidity by La introduction may be beneficial to a certain point because ethylene by-product formation is reduced, but the over-suppression of acidic property may lead to deficient dehydrogenation, producing less hydrogen. On the other hand, Ni/Al-0La and Ni/Al-0.05La catalysts are unfavorable in terms of nickel dispersion. Smaller nickel surface area means less active sites where steam reforming of ethanol can take place. The formation of ethylene by-product (coke precursor) on the Ni/Al-0La catalyst will also have a detrimental effect in achieving high hydrogen yield. In this sense, Ni/Al-0.1La catalyst with an intermediate content of La is expected to retain appropriate amount of surface nickel sites and moderate affinity for ethanol reactant, leading to the most promising catalytic activity."
10,Characterization of used catalysts,"3.5 Characterization of used catalysts The spent Ni/Al-xLa catalysts obtained after a 15 h-reaction were characterized by XRD, TEM, CHNS, and TPO analyses. XRD patterns of used catalysts (Fig. 11 ) exhibited a diffraction peak indicative of carbon due to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface. This peak was most prominent in the Ni/Al-0La, and the peak intensity diminished with increasing La content. A tenuous peak related to γ-Al2O3 was still observed in the used Ni/Al-0La catalyst as observed for freshly reduced Ni/Al-0La (Fig. 4). Metallic nickel peaks were also observed in all the used catalysts. The intensities of metallic nickel peaks of Ni/Al-0La, Ni/Al-0.05La, Ni/Al-0.1La, and Ni/Al-0.15La in Fig. 11 remained almost similar when compared to those in Fig. 4. However, Ni0-related peaks in the used Ni/Al-0.2La catalyst exhibited strong intensity when compared to the freshly reduced Ni/Al-0.2La catalyst. The crystalline nickel size was calculated from Ni(1 1 1) peak of Ni/Al-0.2La in Fig. 11. It was found that nickel size was increased from 5.7nm (Table 3) to 6.9nm after the reaction. This implies that Ni/Al-0.2La catalyst suffered from metal sintering during the 15h-reaction, and this may be responsible for rapid deactivation of the catalyst during the reforming reaction (Fig. 9(a)). Any XRD peaks associated with NiO or NiAl2O4 were not observed, suggesting that re-oxidation of metallic nickel did not occur during the reaction. The amount of carbon on the surface of used catalysts was measured by CHNS analysis (Table 7 ). The used Ni/Al-0La showed the largest amount of carbon deposition of 56.9%, and this value decreased with increasing La/Al molar ratio (13.5% of carbon on the Ni/Al-0.2La). Several traits of lanthanum addition can be considered to explain this phenomenon. Previous studies have asserted that Ni particles with small size show weakened activity for coke generation, because such process requires a cluster of adjacent metallic Ni sites [64,65]. The presence of La2O3 phase on the catalyst surface is also beneficial in carbon removal by forming La2O2CO3 as mentioned earlier. Diminished acidity also contributes to the reduced amount of coke, when considering that C2H4 produced on the acid sites is known to be a main coke precursor. Such results were complemented with TEM images of spent Ni/Al-xLa catalysts as presented in Fig. 12 . It was observed that considerable amount of filamentous carbon was formed in the used Ni/Al-0La catalyst (Fig. 12(a)) unlike the used Ni/Al-0.1La (Fig. 12(b)) and Ni/Al-0.2La (Fig. 12(c)) catalysts. TPO profiles of used Ni/Al-0La, Ni/Al-0.1La, and Ni/Al-0.2La catalysts are presented in Fig. 13 . The three catalysts showed a similar asymmetric profile with peak temperature at around 600°C. Total peak area decreased in the order of Ni/Al-0La > Ni/Al-0.1La > Ni/Al-0.2La, in accordance with CHNS results. The peak temperature shifted to lower temperature with increasing La content, indicating that gasification of coke became more feasible with increasing La content. Carbon deposition during the steam reforming reaction occurs via diverse routes. Coke produced from condensation of C2H4 species leads to amorphous carbon, while decomposition of methane (CH4 →C+2H2) and Boudouard reaction (2CO→CO2 +C) lead to filamentous coke [64]. The oxidation trait of these two kinds of carbon differs as well. Filamentous coke tends to be oxidized at relatively high temperature. This is because filamentous carbon needs to be diffused back onto the active sites located on the catalyst surface to be gasified, while amorphous carbon remains on the catalyst surface in an encapsulating form [50]. In this sense, TPO profiles in Fig. 13 were separated into two regions using 550°C as a demarcation line on the basis of the criterion used in a previous work [66]. Peak areas of TPO curves under 550°C were considered as amorphous coke, while peaks areas over 550°C were regarded as coke with filamentous nature. The portion of amorphous carbon was reduced from 30.9% (Ni/Al-0La) to 25.1% (Ni/Al-0.2La). It is believed that the portion of amorphous coke is reduced, because small amount of C2H4 is formed in the Ni/Al-xLa catalysts with high La content and weakened acidity. It is known that filamentous coke is not so severe in hindering the steam reforming process when compared to amorphous coke which encapsulates surface active sites [67,68]. Thus, nickel catalysts supported on binary aluminum-lanthanum oxide supports resulted in small quantity of carbon formation and low portion of amorphous carbon when compared to the conventional Ni/Al2O3."
11,Conclusions,"Al2O3-La2O3 binary xerogel supports with different La/Al molar ratio (denoted as Al-xLa, x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) were prepared by a sol-gel method. A series of Ni/Al2O3-La2O3 xerogel catalysts (denoted as Ni/Al-xLa, x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) were then obtained by a wetness impregnation method. All the prepared catalysts retained a mesoporous structure. Surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter decreased with increasing La content. Al species became more ‘coordinately unsaturated’ with the introduction of La, inducing the formation of lattice structure with higher degree of defect and vacancy. TPD analyses with probe molecules (CO2 and NH3) revealed that the addition of La caused the suppressed acidity and the enhanced basicity. Although metallic nickel are known to be the main anchoring sites for EtOH during the steam reforming reaction, there was a discrepancy between the trends in H2-TPD and EtOH-TPD results of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts. Metallic nickel particles became smaller and nickel dispersion increased with increasing La content, leading to higher nickel surface area. On the contrary, the catalysts with large amount of La showed weak affinity towards ethanol in spite of their high nickel dispersion. This was attributed to the diminished physicochemical properties of the catalysts along with partial surface coverage caused by large-sized La atoms. As a result, hydrogen yield showed a volcano-shaped curve with regard to La/Al molar ratio of the catalysts. The maximum hydrogen yield at an intermediate La/Al molar ratio was due to the offset of two opposite trends between nickel surface area and ethanol adsorption capacity of Ni/Al-xLa catalysts."
