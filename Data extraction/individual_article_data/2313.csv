0,Introduction,"Blending biodiesel with diesel has been conducted to limit the diesel drawbacks such as mitigating emissions of hazardous pollutants including sulphur oxide (SOx), hydrocarbons (HC) containing aromatics like pyrene, toluene, and benzene, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM). However, nitrogen oxides (NOx) increase slightly due to higher flame temperature during lean combustion (air > fuel) in a diesel engine (Yilmaz et al., 2018). At the elevated temperature and high pressure of fuel combustion, N2 from the ambient atmosphere and excess O2 dissociates and react to form the anthropogenic NOx emissions which contain the sum of NO and NO2. The oxidation of NOx in high-temperature combustion is called thermal NOx. The thermal NOx emits about 500 to 5500 ppm concentration, as shown in Fig. 1 . Thermal NOx can increase rapidly as the temperature, residence time, and oxygen content increased (Rajesh Kumar et al., 2017). NOx emissions are the most harmful regulated toxic air pollutant and greenhouse gases (GHG). Urban NOx emissions by road transport are contributing 30–40% of nitric oxide (NO) (Almaraz et al., 2018) to ambient air quality degradation as tabulated in the pie chart in Fig. 2 (Almaraz et al., 2018). Beyond that, heavy-duty diesel vehicles are a major source of NOx emissions. NOx is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels (such as petrol, diesel, natural gas, and sulphur-coal) are burned at a high temperature of more than 2300 K and high pressure for a long time (He et al., 2015). NOx is predominantly composed of 90% of NO, 5% of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and 5% of nitric oxides. The NOx emissions are decisive for the environmentally detrimental such as ecosystem acidification (HNO3; acid rain), the formation of tropospheric ozone (O3) in the lower atmosphere, and photochemical smog (smoke and fog) that emerged most prominently in an urban area. Research on NOx mitigation technologies has been extensive in recent years due to growing environmental awareness. There are numerous technologies to reduce NOx formation and emissions from combustion processes. NOx control technologies can extensively be classified into three groups as pre-treatment techniques, combustion control techniques, and post-treatment techniques as elucidated in Fig. 3 . The NOx reduction is dependent on both fuel physicochemical property and engine characteristics. Fuel properties such as cetane number and viscosity, ignition quality, thermal NOx formation, and engine operating conditions have a great influence on NOx emission (Chen et al., 2018). To meet the increasingly stringent vehicular exhaust emissions and fuel quality global standards, several NOx control technologies have been employed in modern compression ignition (CI) diesel engines. Many of the aforementioned multifaceted NOx control technologies have multi-segment efficacy based on fuel quality and combustion characteristics (Jiaqiang et al., 2017). Most researchers recommend post-treatment techniques as the most widely commercialised NOx control technology such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) (Van Caneghem et al., 2016), NOx adsorber catalysts (NACs) (Theis and Lambert, 2015), lean NOx trap (LNT) (Kang et al., 2018), wet scrubbing (Zwolińska et al., 2020), and many more. However, most of them are complicated due to significantly higher capital and operation cost plus reductant cost (Cheng and Bi, 2014), catalyst deactivation (Jilvero et al., 2015), and resulting in undesirable ammonia slip emission (Palash et al., 2013). For all post-treatment technologies, cost, size, and service interval are also strong arguments for reducing exhaust emissions (Praveena and Martin, 2018). Fuel blending with oxygenates becomes beneficial in reducing this complexity. NOx emissions have been the most challenging regulated toxic air pollutants emitted from Compression Ignition (CI) diesel engines owing to strict exhaust emissions standards. Fig. 4 depicts the statistical regression analysis correlation of the trade-off between PM and NOx emissions used in CI diesel engines, which highlights trends with increasing biodiesel content B0 to B100 can significantly reduce HC, CO, and PM emissions significantly but increase NOx emissions (Thangaraja et al., 2016) slightly. PM and NOx are certainly indirectly proportional where there is a 10% increase in NOx for B100, while 50%–70% decrease for PM, CO, and HC emissions. For example, Uyumaz (2018) claimed that high blends of 30% mustard oil biodiesel fuel had increased NOx up to 23% while CO and PM emissions decreased. How et al. (2018) concluded that the anthropogenic NOx emissions increased with the increase in the biodiesel blending ratio. Karavalakis et al. (2017) also reported that a low-level blend below B20 (20% biodiesel) is highly recommended to curb NOx effectively. B20 also performs similar horsepower, torque, and mileage as diesel (Alptekin et al., 2015) and will operate like diesel in any diesel engine without the need for modifications. NOx emissions reduction without deteriorating the engine performance can be attained substantially by the incorporation of fuel blending. Alcohol acts as an oxygenate and is blended with diesel/biodiesel. Fuel blend, which is interpreted as a diesel blends with oxygenated biofuel/bio-chemical (bio-ester, bio-ether, and bio-alcohol), is inferred by various biodiesel researchers, efficiently can reduce harmful pollutant exhaust emission while optimising the engine performance with acceptable cost. Biofuel/bio-chemical acts as an oxygenate, or additive to diesel aids complete combustion and lower hazardous and carcinogenic exhaust emissions pollutant like PM, HC, and CO. However, blending diesel with bio-ester like biodiesel has some shortcoming such as higher viscosity (Tesfa et al., 2010) and higher density (Gülüm and Bilgin, 2017) which leads to lower volatility and poor atomisation (Alptekin and Canakci, 2008) and lubricity (Han et al., 2020) which finally deriving into poor combustion with more pollutant emissions and the worst scenario is a significant increase of NOx emission (Atmanli, 2016a). This work emphasises the effect of alcohol oxygenates on diesel/biodiesel blends for mitigating the NOx of a CI diesel engine. Fuel properties such as fuel density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number (CN), calorific value (CV) were examined using model-based product design. Alcohol oxygenates blended with diesel/biodiesel are imminent to achieve the goals. Attention focuses on straight-chain alcohols like methanol (C1), ethanol (C2), propanol (C3), and butanol (C4) as oxygenates due to their advantages such as higher oxygen content cause more complete combustion (Emiroğlu and Şen, 2018), and higher latent heat of evaporation and lower calorific value reduces the combustion temperature when the alcohol vaporises and suppresses thermal NOx formation (Ghadikolaei et al., 2018). Biodiesel is not only an amphiphile or surfactant agent but also a stabiliser preventing the phase separation between the diesel and alcohol resulting uniformly homogeneous single-phase liquid system due to incomplete miscibility with catastrophic consequences (Tongroon et al., 2019). Corral-Gómez et al. (2019) concluded that fuel blends stability is better when the biodiesel ratio is greater than the alcohol ratio in diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends. One of the most attractive solutions for cleaner combustion in diesel engines without any modification is the fuel blending with oxygenates. Oxygenates are the most effective additive to enhance the fuel quality and combustion characteristics simultaneously. The alcohol oxygenates can effectively improve the hindrance of diesel/biodiesel blends such as improves flow resistance due to lower viscosity of the fuel blends and reducing NOx emissions effectively due to the stronger cooling effect caused by the higher heat of vaporisation of alcohol. In combustion performance, it will promote better economic engine performance by optimising thermal efficiency (Sivasubramanian et al., 2017). The design of a fuel blend is challenging in different ways. The challenge is to determine a set of feasible diesel/biodiesel/alcohol ternary blends that satisfy the desired diesel fuel physicochemical properties which complying with the fuel regulation: American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D975 (ASTM International, 2020), and European EN590 standards (European Committee for Standardization, 2014). Most studies concentrate on the traditional trial-and-error experimental-based method only. The experimental-based method can significantly extend the design and development time and increases the cost. The traditional method is time-consuming and not environmentally friendly, as numerous attempts are required and demolish more resources (Chen et al., 2019). The best strategy to reduce this complexity is to adapt and adopt a computer-aided model-based product design while the expensive experimental-based method with abundant numerous candidates and alternatives is reserved only for verification of the most promising candidates (Chai et al., 2020). Table 1 lists the technical and economic advantages of model-based over experimental-based methods (Zhang et al., 2020). The main pros and cons are also highlighted. The model-based design is a technological advancement that keeps quality up, costs down (Wynn and Clarkson, 2018). A computer-aided model-based product design optimisation is the best strategy in forecasting, designing, and executing experimental investigation of fuel blends on engine performance, exhaust pollutants, and combustion characteristics. Computer-aided product design is a rapid method of analysis that could control a process or predict a more desirable outcome. Fuel blending optimisation is now gained increasing scientific attention because of its potential to predict engine performance and exhaust emissions. This research work highlights a predicted and prescriptive analysis, a model-based fuel blending as is one of the best NOx control technology compared to the trial-and-error experimental works. The developed product design optimisation model can predict the NOx pollutant emissions by considering the fuel properties such as cetane number and oxygen content as modelling constraints. A model-based fuel blending has more advantages, such as can analyse the effects of the constraints, study the behavior of a system without running engine performance tests, zero risks, and easily performing a What-If analysis. Similar prediction methodology adapted by Gopal et al. (2018) in their work in the prediction of emissions and performance of a diesel engine fuelled with n-octanol/diesel blends using response surface methodology. An et al. (2015) adopted a similar prediction methodology for diesel/biodiesel/ethanol blends. They concluded that fuel properties such as cetane number (CN), carbon-hydrogen ratio, and oxygen content (OC) of fuel blend with ethanol oxygenates significant factors in the emissions prediction. Fuel blending in a specific term, fuel enhancement as a pre-treatment technique has enormous potential when used with validated mathematical models for the estimation of fuel target physicochemical properties."
1,Study objective,"1.1 Study objective The objective of this present study is to develop a model-based product design optimisation of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends incorporated with an accurate NOx prediction model as the model's predictive accuracy. The aim here is to obtain the optimal fuel blends that match the diesel properties, ASTM D975 and EN590. The design of blends is made by adding additives (alcohol oxygenates) to diesel/biodiesel blends. The design of the diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blend is determined by formulating and solving the resulting Linear Programming (LP) models. The compositions for each fuel blend are deliberately formulated to characterise the alcohol oxygenates with different oxygen content so that the effects of oxygen contents (OC), cetane number (CN), and heat of vaporisation (HOV) can be extensively evaluated by investigating their impacts on NOx emissions."
2,Methods and tools,"In this present work, a systematic methodology for model-based optimisation of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blends design algorithms has been developed. This model-based optimisation is envisioned: i. To identify the optimal fuel blends which exhibit the desired fuel efficiency specified a priori to produce the same performance as the target fuel. ii. To rank and select the optimal fuel blend associated with maximum performance, minimal cost and emissions. iii. To predict NOx formation by using a mathematical algorithm depending on fuel blend properties; CN, and OC. Systematic methodology in the design of the proposed fuel blend for this study had been adopted by (Yunus et al., 2014) for gasoline blending (Kalakul et al., 2018) for lubricant blending (Zhang et al., 2018) for mixing surrogate fuels, and (Hashim et al., 2017) for ether-alcohol biofuel blending. Their proposed model-based product design with the target to reduce the diesel exhaust emissions such as NOx pollutant emissions generally have been verified experimentally. However, this research work focuses to numerically develop the NOx emissions prediction model as the model's predictive accuracy. The model-based product design has been enhanced by accommodating NOx pollutant emissions prediction models by employing fuel properties. The methodology is categorised into five dominant tasks: i. The problem definition and specifying the target properties and their values (problem formulation). ii. The property model identification to predict fuel blend properties. The required target property models for both pure components and fuel blends are retrieved from the property model library. In this step, the product attributes are converted to physical and chemical properties and their upper and lower bounds. iii. The blending problem is solved using a blend design algorithm to find the blends that best match the design targets. iv. To rank and select the optimal fuel blends from the feasible blends obtained in the third step. v. The prediction NOx formation by using a mathematical algorithm depending on fuel blend properties; CN and OC. A comprehensive discussion on the effects of cetane number, oxygen content, fuel density, and viscosity of fuel blends on NOx emissions has been included. These five systematic steps are cordially outlined in Fig. 5 . The effect of considering different alcohol in fuel blends and/or other hypotheses regarding fuel performance is investigated in the case study section. Fuel blends consisting of diesel as a base fuel, biodiesel, and alcohol as oxygenates are highlighted here. The fuel blends design problem is simplified and formulated as a mathematical model-based product design optimisation, which results in an LP problem. In general, product design quality attributes focus on economic viability, environmental friendliness, fuel efficiency, and safety concerns."
3,Case study - design of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blends,"A case study is dedicated to the identification of promising diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blends that has similar performance to diesel which complying the diesel regulation; ASTM D975, and EN590 standards. The proposed model is tested for four different types of alcohol in which different fuel physicochemical properties are imposed as constraints. Adding alcohol oxygenates, should be possible to reduce the fuel dependency and environmental impacts of diesel. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model-based product design for the optimal diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blends."
4,Step-1: problem definition,"3.1 Step-1: problem definition 3.1.1 Defining attributes of interest In this case study, the indispensable of fuel blends of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol is to reduce the harmful pollutants, especially on NOx exerted by diesel/biodiesel as demonstrated in Fig. 6 . Fuel blends are obtained by blending diesel/biodiesel/alcohol to best match the desired diesel standard (target properties). The base fuel is diesel, and the oxygenates are biodiesel and alcohol. Four core attributes, such as economic viability, environmental friendliness, fuel efficiency, and safety concern, are then translated into target properties and target values. A knowledge-base, a thorough literature search, and legislation details are used to determine the product needs in this work. Table 2 shows the physicochemical properties and feedstock costs of these fuel blend constituents. 3.1.2 Defining target properties Compared to diesel, biodiesel is a renewable, biodegradable, oxygenated, and eco-friendly clean alternative to diesel that can be employed in existing diesel engines with minor or no modifications. Biodiesel with 11% oxygen content has gained attention in recent years could promote cleaner-burning, as compared with diesel reduction in HC, CO, SO2, and PM most effectively; however, greater NOx has ratcheted up (Hoekman and Robbins, 2012). Another shortcoming is a high viscosity, and the large molecular weight of biodiesel leads to lower volatility and poor atomisation and lubricity which finally leads to poor combustion (Han et al., 2020). The worst scenario is a significant increase in NOx emission (Atmanli, 2016a). The evaluation should be based on appropriate environmental footprints (Čuček et al., 2012a) assessment, specifically on GHG (Čuček et al., 2015) and nitrogen footprints (Čuček et al., 2012b). To address these shortcomings and to meet stringent emission norms, it is highly recommended to blend alcohol oxygenates with diesel/biodiesel. Alcohol oxygenates could affect the imperative properties of the fuel blends, such as viscosity and density, flash point, cetane number, oxygen content, fuel sulphur, and calorific value (CV). The higher OC in alcohol helps in improving the quality of biodiesel by promoting complete combustion and mitigating harmful exhaust emissions, especially on NOx emissions. Table 3 summarises the target properties based on attributes and their significance for the fuel blends model-based product design problem. 3.1.3 Defining constraints The target property column indicates a few types of physicochemical fuel desired properties. “Linear” means the property of fuel blends is calculated using the linear mixing rules. Linear property models give good predictions of blend properties for chemical systems that have negligible excess properties of mixing (Ng et al., 2015). The target property of the fuel blends is calculated according to the related volume shares of diesel, biodiesel, and alcohol. The constraints were set in the form of lower and upper limits for every target property. Euro5 diesel specifications are the values limit and target fuel properties. ASTM D975 fuel standards for diesel have been accredited for diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends."
5,Step-2: property model identification,"3.2 Step-2: property model identification Property model identification is retrieved mostly from the literature database. In contrast to pure component properties, the prediction of target properties of the fuel blends, particularly for biofuels (biodiesel and alcohol) blended with diesel is highly complex (Amin et al., 2016). Data from experimental tests do not cover the numerous fuel blends ratio at different test parameters. Identification of optimal diesel/biodiesel/alcohol fuel blends is required because it possesses a significant influence on engine performance and emission profile. The prediction of blend properties will have to count on blend rules and their correlations. Blend property verification is unnecessary as linear mixing rules give a reliable property prediction (Ng et al., 2015). Two types of blend property models are involved in this work, linear and nonlinear models. The linear model consists of simple Linear Kay's and Arrhenius Mixing Rules, represented by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). (1) ζ m i x = ∑ i n x i ζ i where ζ m i x is a property of the blends, ζ i is the corresponding property of pure i component and x i is the fraction in volume or mass based on the properties unit. (2) ln μ m i x = ∑ i n x i ln μ i where μ i is the kinematic viscosity (kg/m.s) of pure i component and μ m i x is the dynamic viscosity of the fuel blends mixture (kg/m.s) while x i is the fraction in volume or mass based on the properties unit. Nonlinear models are identified for the prediction of viscosity, density, and flash point. Those have been linearised to apply the simple linear mixing rules. Linearisation of viscosity and density with the relative error at 5% (Gülüm and Bilgin, 2017) while 10% relative error for flash point (El-araby et al., 2018). The differences show that these three properties linear models are not substantial, and linearisation was used. The Linear Kay's and Arrhenius Mixing Rules, the simple mixing rules for predicting the basic properties of diesel/biodiesel blends (Chatrou et al., 2019). Both rules are very important in designing the fuel blends as they satisfy the thermodynamic properties of combustible fluids. Kay's mixing rule is used for predicting density (Amin et al., 2016), calorific value (Amin et al., 2016), derived cetane number (Kalakul et al., 2018), flash point (El-araby et al., 2018), oxygen content (Zhang et al., 2018), the heat of vaporisation (Yesilyurt et al., 2020), fuel sulphur content (Hashim et al., 2017), and cost (Hashim et al., 2017) while an Arrhenius mixing rule is used for kinematic viscosity (Hoang, 2018)."
6,Step-3: generation of feasible blends candidates,"3.3 Step-3: generation of feasible blends candidates The biofuel blends design problem is formulated for Linear Programming via a model-based design optimisation approach. In this study, the fuel blends design is solved using MATLAB, modelled in a linear programming (linprog) solver with linear objective function and linear constraints (Yunus et al., 2014). The optimisation problem is to maximise the linear objective function, subject to all the other expressions as linear constraints. The continuous constraints were set in the form of lower and upper limits for every target property, as depicted in Table 4 . All inequalities of lower and upper limits were defined as equality continuous constraints for this linprog problem. The fuel blends target property models, constraints, and target values that were coded into MATLAB. 3.3.1 Declaring and defining data The subscript i represents individual fuel constituents and the subscript mix represents the fuel blend mixture. Low blending ratio at 20% of biodiesel on the fuel blends is considered since this ratio has been approved compatible to the previous design of the existing engine and has been approved as fuel with the diesel/biodiesel binary blends standard, ASTM D7467, a specification for biodiesel blends from B6 to B20 (ASTM International, 2020). Moreover, biodiesel can be easily and safely blended with diesel up to 20% at any of the load and speed to obtain almost the same performance as diesel (Imdadul et al., 2017). The higher ratio is not recommended to be blended with diesel due to biodiesel disadvantages over diesel. Biodiesel is limited to 20% due to higher viscosity and lower energy content which can lead to degrading the engine power (Ali et al., 2015). Subramani et al. (2020) deduced that 20% of biodiesel in the fuel blends minimises heat energy and reduces the power output. A similar observation was found in (Reza Miri et al., 2017). Biodiesel blends up to 20% is potential to reduce the dependency significantly on non-renewable and toxic diesel as well as the exhaust emissions of the engine. The higher blends of biodiesel resulted in higher viscosity and density, the lower heating value which can cause poor atomisation, fuel flow, and ignition problem and lead to incomplete combustion (Chen et al., 2018). Despite decreasing pollutants from exhaust emissions such as HC, CO, and PM (Rashed et al., 2016), biodiesel increases higher NOx emissions (Chen et al., 2018). For alcohol, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% by volume were preferred for the fuel blends. Higher than 20% by volume of alcohol in the fuel blend is not recommended. This is because increasing the alcohol oxygenates beyond 20% resulted in increased PM (Rashedul et al., 2014) and aromatics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) precursors such as the hazardous aromatics benzene and toluene (Guan et al., 2017). The higher alcohol concentration in diesel/biodiesel blends is corrosive to metallic engine components due to the higher presence of water and organic acids which in turn degrades the properties of the fuel (Pradelle et al., 2019). 3.3.2 Solving model-based design problem The linear objective function for the model-based product design optimisation is set to maximise the cetane number of fuel blends, CN mix as shown in Eq. (3) . (3) F o b j = max ∑ i n C N m i x where F o b j is the objective function and C N m i x represents the cetane number of the fuel blend mixture. Table 4 tabularises the continuous linear constraints as portrayed in Eq. (4) to (15). The shortlisted feasible fuel blends that satisfy the imposed constraints in the fuel blends are then subjected to a ranking and selection process. The screening criteria are based on attributes of interest (product target) for the model-based product design."
7,Step-4: rank and select the optimal fuel blend,"3.4 Step-4: rank and select the optimal fuel blend Four optimal blends shortlisted. The optimal fuel blends that satisfied all the linear constraints are then ranked according to the minimum difference cetane number, Δ CN mix in the fuel blends over the CN of diesel. 3.4.1 Ranking and selection the candidates The optimal fuel blends should consist of at least 1% by volume of alcohol oxygenates. Meanwhile, the total alternative fuel (biodiesel) and additive (alcohol oxygenates) content should not exceed 40% by volume to ensure the fuel blends are compatible with the existing diesel engine. Alcohol oxygenates should not beyond 20% which results in increased PM (Rashedul et al., 2014) and aromatics toxic PAHs precursors such as benzene and toluene (Altun et al., 2011). The tabulated results clearly show butanol as the more favoured alcohol blends candidate for blending with diesel and biodiesel. 3.4.2 Determining optimal blends Favourable physiochemical properties of butanol in Blend 4 (D70B20B10) are inferred as the best optimal fuel blends as shown in Table 5 portrays the results of the optimal fuel blends. Blend 4 pinpoints these three product targets: i. Minimum CN loss; the lower the magnitude of CN difference ( Δ CN mix ) indicating the minimal difference of diesel/biodiesel/butanol fuel quality compared to diesel. This minimal difference advantageously concludes that butanol has physical properties close to diesel fuels. Compared to lower alcohol, 10% of butanol exhibits better results even in lower blending concentrations. Also, the higher CN of Blend 4 concluded that only a minimal volume of butanol is needed in attributing more powerful engine performance and improving the combustion efficiency and cleaner emissions simultaneously, especially for NOx emissions. ii. Minimum fuel sulphur; the lower the sulphur in the fuel, the lower the toxic sulphate emitted from the exhaust and further decreasing the PM emissions. iii. The minimum feedstock cost of every fuel in blends; the lower the feedstock cost, the more preferred the fuel by the fuel provider. Feedstock cost mainly affects economic feasibility (Rashedul et al., 2014). Four optimal fuel blends were ranked and selected based on Δ CN mix , sulphur content and feedstock cost as they are significant factors affecting the combustion quality, emission controversial issues, and economic downturn. A similar decision has been found in this reference (Phoon et al., 2016) The optimal solutions of fuel blends obtained was ranked according to their Δ CN mix . The correlation between the feedstock cost, OC mix and Δ CN mix is illustrated in Fig. 7 . According to Fig. 7, Blend 4 comprising diesel/biodiesel/butanol (D70B20Bu10) is the most promising optimal fuel blends in this case study. Blend 4 accommodates the lowest magnitude of Δ CN mix (2% of difference) associated with the lowest cost (MYR4.9/L). Blend 3 consisting diesel/biodiesel/propanol (D65B20P15), Blend 2 consisting diesel/biodiesel/ethanol (D67B20E13), and Blend 1 comprising diesel/biodiesel/methanol (D70B20M10). Despite the higher feedstock cost of butanol compared to the MYR2.18/L diesel (retail price in January 2020), Blend 4 resulted in the lowest feedstock cost (MYR4.9/L) among the candidates. Blend 4 denotes the lowest OC mix (4.36 mg/kg) compared to other lower alcohols. Interestingly, the minimal OC mix of Blend 4 depicts a smaller volume of butanol is required for the same diesel engine power output due to its higher CV (CV = 33.1 MJ/kg), higher CN (CN = 17) compared to lower alcohols blends in Blend 1, Blend 2, and Blend 3. Miscibility of butanol with biodiesel was excellent compared to lower alcohol like ethanol. Hydrophilic nature of ethanol reduces the stability in blending with diesel especially at low temperatures and cold flow (Lapuerta et al., 2018) and this concludes that butanol is the excellent oxygenates to blend with diesel and biodiesel."
8,Step 5 – product analysis,"3.5 Step 5 – product analysis Product analysis is a post-model-based design step. In product analysis, the output is calculated based on known input and a given product (Fung et al., 2016). This analysis adopted for the best optimal blend (Blend 4 for D70B20Bu10) which some properties and/or performance need to be tested and/or verified. The objective function of this model-based design is to maximise the CN mix of the fuel blends. Product analysis tailored to the maximum cetane number (performance) and minimum oxygen content (emissions) of the fuel blends. The properties such as CN mix and OC mix of the most promising fuel blend (Blend 4) are verified through rigorous models. The best alcohol oxygenates for Blend 4 is butanol. The interest in higher alcohol such as butanol has invigorated many efforts regarding biodiesel NOx abatement initiatives due to its superior properties, in comparison to methanol, ethanol, and propanol. Butanol is now attracting global attention as an oxygenate, and alternative fuels due to advantages: i. Produced from locally available renewable resources, ii. Lower NOx pollutant emissions, iii. Biodegradable nature (Emiroğlu and Şen, 2018). Compared to the lower alcohols, the physicochemical properties of higher alcohol are found to greatly improve and compensate for diesel/biodiesel blends while obtaining better results even in lower ratio blending concentrations (Mirhashemi and Sadrnia, 2020). Rajesh Kumar and Saravanan (2016) inferred that butanol has a higher miscibility factor due to its hydrophobic nature provides good solubility with diesel without phase separation. Butanol is less corrosive and can be stored in standard tanks for a longer duration (Chen et al., 2013). Moreover, the lower flash point of butanol (FP = 35 °C) guarantees safe transportation, safe handling, and safe storage. Fig. 8 illustrates the effect of CN mix on butanol composition in the blends. As the higher the concentration of butanol blended to diesel/biodiesel, the lower the CN mix . The CN of Blend 4, consisting of 70% diesel, 20% biodiesel, and 10% butanol is (CN = 48.69), is approaching CN of Diesel (CN = 49). This concluded that with minimal 10% butanol can perform the same power output as diesel fuel for the diesel engine (Imtenan et al., 2015). The carbon chain length, molecule weight, and a varying number of double bonds influence the CN. All the constraints of the property model are satisfied. Only property values in the limit range were selected. Based on ASTM D975, the allowable limit for CN is 45–55 in Table 4. A similar CN prediction was reported in (Knothe, 2012). The OC mix increases as the butanol composition increased as seen in Fig. 9 . The OC assists complete combustion and reduces NOx and PM emissions significantly. The OC of Blend 4 consisting of 70% diesel, 20% biodiesel, and 10% butanol is (OCmix = 4.36 mg/kg). This concluded that only minimal 10% butanol is required to perform the same power output as diesel fuel (Imdadul et al., 2017). Compared to the lower alcohols, the higher alcohol properties are found similar to diesel and exhibiting better results even in lower blending concentrations. A similar OC prediction was reported in (Phoon et al., 2017). All the constraints of the property model are satisfied. Only property values in the limit range were selected. Big challenges in this final step are the availability of property models that can predict the PM and NOx emissions of diesel exhaust emissions (Subramani et al., 2020). Let consider a simple NOx prediction for this fuel blend design problem. Note that the PM prediction is not considered since the lower change of the PM formation was observed. The next step is the NOx formation prediction by leveraging rigorous models from the literature database. These models were then analysed, evaluated, and optimised for the desired objective, which is to minimise NOx emissions. Two combustion characteristics influence the NOx formation significantly; ignition quality (govern by CN) and oxygen concentration (refer to OC) (Nabi et al., 2019). Consequently, the final models developed can be a precursor to implementing the physical system in a dynamic testing phase (experiment). As seen in Fig. 10 , NOx increases as the CN mix increased. This correlation is shown in Eq. 16 (Singh et al., 2016). Note that CN for diesel is 49 and CN for biodiesel 61. Butanol addition to diesel/biodiesel depicts the minimal NOx formation as lower as 4% increment than the NOx emissions increment of the lower alcohol oxygenates; methanol at 5%, ethanol at 6%, and propanol at 7%. The butanol slightly decreases the CNmix from 49 (CN diesel) to 48.69 while increasing the OCmix. However, this positive inverse reaction is benefited in reducing NOx formation significantly by providing a stronger cooling effect (HOV) and retarded ignition delay which causes constant air/fuel volume combustion due to better fuel accumulation during the premixed burning phase. The higher HOV of butanol (HOV = 581.4 kJ/kg) compared to diesel (HOV = 274 kJ/kg) and biodiesel (HOV = 353 kJ/kg) reduces the peak flame temperature and suppresses NOx emissions. Similar observations are obtained in the literature with diesel/biodiesel/butanol blends, as mentioned in (Yilmaz et al., 2014). (4) N O x = 0.3573 C N m i x − 11.75 where N O x represents NOx emissions in mg/kg and the C N m i x is the cetane number of the fuel blend. Fig. 11 shows the effect of oxygen content on NOx emission. This correlation is shown in Eq. 17 (Singh et al., 2016). Butanol addition to diesel/biodiesel decreases NOx formation significantly about 7%–15%, Concurrently, the higher OC of diesel/biodiesel/butanol promotes complete combustion, reducing PM emissions significantly. The higher HOV of butanol (HOV = 581.4 kJ/kg) than diesel (HOV = 274 kJ/kg) and biodiesel (HOV = 353 kJ/kg) reduces the combustion temperature and decreases NOx emissions. Similar observations are obtained in the literature with diesel/biodiesel/butanol blends, as mentioned in (Çelebi and Aydın, 2018). Compared to lower alcohol, butanol has lower OC but higher HOV, which helps to reduce NOx emissions. Butanol exhibits superior properties almost similar to diesel properties even in low concentrations.

The higher CN of biodiesel causes shorter ignition delay and advances the combustion timing, which leads to higher combustion temperatures and higher NOx emissions. However, this NOx emissions problem could be eliminated by adding higher alcohol as oxygenates. The higher CN associated with, the higher heat of vaporisation (HOV) of butanol as compared to lower alcohol promotes better fuel ignition and causes more air/fuel accumulations (Nanthagopal et al., 2018b) and lowered cylinder pressure. Suppressing PM and NOx emissions concurrently due to reduced peak combustion temperature (Mirhashemi and Sadrnia, 2020). Yang et al. (2015) proved that diesel/biodiesel/butanol enhances the HOV, which leads to a stronger cooling effect in the combustion chamber, thus reducing NOx formation. The higher self-ignition temperature (SIT) of butanol (SIT = 345 °C) compared to diesel (SIT = 254 °C) also contributes to retarding ignition delay. The retarding ignition delay enables sufficient time for air/fuel blends homogeneous combustion and enhances the premixed combustion phase. This improves engine thermal efficiency and combustion characteristics without significantly reducing the engine power output (Erdiwansyah et al., 2019). The lower PM and NOx simultaneously can be achieved in lower combustion temperatures (Mwangi et al., 2015). According to Hernández et al. (2019), the lower temperature combustion can be accomplished with a combination of higher alcohol oxygenates such as butanol, higher exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates, and advanced injection strategies. On the combustion efficiency front, butanol (HOV = 581.4 kJ/kg) has a higher HOV than diesel (HOV = 274 kJ/kg) and biodiesel (HOV = 353 kJ/kg), lower CV, and higher volatility can reduce the compression work and combustion temperature due to a better evaporative cooling effect. This advantage of higher alcohol also leads to higher engine thermal efficiency and combustion efficiency. As alcohol blends composition increases, the cooling effect of alcohol becomes more dominant, leading to lower combustion temperature and a reduction of NOx emissions significantly. The higher HOV of alcohols also resulted in the flame quenching effect and caused peak flame temperature combustion to decrease, which in turn reduce the NOx emission (Balamurugan et al., 2014). The higher HOV of butanol in diesel/biodiesel/alcohol has an important crucial role during the combustion process that resulted in low combustion temperature and thereby low NOx formation. The mechanism of HOV of alcohol oxygenates affecting the NOx reduction can be explained in three simple steps: i. The higher OC in alcohol increases the premixed combustion pressure. ii. The higher HOV of alcohol will lower the flame combustion temperature which in turn reducing the NOx formation. iii. The higher SIT of alcohol prolongs ignition delay resulting in more fuel burned homogeneously and enhance the premixed combustion and finally reducing NOx and PM. 3.5.2 Effects of OC on NOx PM emissions are governed by the OC of the fuel (Fayad et al., 2017). The higher OC of butanol (OC = 21.58 mg/kg) and the lower carbon content compared to biodiesel (OC = 11 mg/kg) can be attributed to the PM reduction significantly. Another reason is the hydroxyl group (-OH) in alcohol is also reported in (Cheng et al., 2002) can suppress the soot and PM formation more effectively. PM and the 26% aromatic hydrocarbon (includes PAHs) in diesel can be further decreased by adding alcohol oxygenates and biodiesel to diesel (Barrientos et al., 2013). With the increase of OC, diesel/biodiesel/butanol blends can simultaneously decrease PM and NOx. The total OC of biodiesel and butanol decreased the PM formation while the higher HOV of butanol reduced the NOx formation. The trade-off between PM and NOx emission can be improved successfully by blending butanol with diesel/biodiesel in the optimal composition. This trend is similar to the results obtained by Rakopoulos et al. (2011). Although butanol depicts lower OC (OC = 21.58 mg/kg) than ethanol (OC = 49.93 mg/kg), it exhibits superior properties compared to lower alcohol. Butanol is more preferable for blending with conventional diesel. Butanol has better miscibility due to the longer carbon chain and lower polarity which can prevent filter clogging problems (Lapuerta et al., 2018). The increase of the carbon content and chain length of Butanol provides higher HOV (stronger cooling effect to reduce NOx formation), CV (higher power output), CN (reduces ignition delay), density, and viscosity (better fuel flow for better atomisation), flash point (for safer storage and handling) and higher miscibility factor in diesel/biodiesel fuel blends. 3.5.3 Effect of viscosity and density on NOx Higher viscosity and density are the major disadvantages of biodiesel. The diesel fuel injection system is based on the volumetric principle. With the higher volumetric density and viscosity of biodiesel, a longer ignition delay will increase the peak pressure during the premixed combustion phase due to poor atomisation and spray characteristics. The peak temperature increased, which in turn increases the NOx formation. This high viscosity and density of biodiesel are due to higher molecular weight, and the chemical structure of vegetable oils causes the difficulty of fuel atomisation, vaporisation, and homogeneous air/fuel mixture as well as incomplete combustion (Hoang, 2018). The higher viscosity of biodiesel also affects injectors and fuel pump lubrication (Barabás and Todoruţ, 2011). The addition of alcohol oxygenates can reduce the viscosity and density of fuel blend effectively and improves engine performance, combustion efficiency as well as exhaust emission (Nanthagopal et al., 2018a). Adding alcohol oxygenates to the diesel/biodiesel blend reduces the viscosity and density of the fuel blends but increases the OC of the blend. As compared to diesel/biodiesel blend, the lower density, viscosity, and better volatility of butanol can intensify the atomisation quality, spray characteristics towards the accelerated vaporisation of the blends, and consequently permits the better combustion efficiency (Pandey et al., 2012). Further, alcohol oxygenates blend in diesel/biodiesel reduces PM, CO, and HC emissions due to excess OC. These characteristics inferred that the oxygenates additive is the best option to improve ignition quality and reduced PM and NOx emissions concurrently."
9,Conclusions,"Model-based product design is the best predicted and prescriptive analysis strategy in predicting, designing, and executing the investigation of fuel blends on engine performance, exhaust pollutants, and combustion characteristics. The results indicated that higher alcohol (butanol) addition to diesel/biodiesel reduces NOx emissions from 7% up to 15%. The NOx reduction increased as the butanol has higher OC, higher HOV, and lower CV than diesel provides a stronger cooling effect during combustion. The optimal blend comprising 70% diesel, 20% biodiesel, and 10% Butanol (D70B20Bu10) indicates the highest performance (CN)associated with lower cost and lower NOx emissions. Only 10% butanol is required to perform the same power output as diesel fuel. Higher alcohol (butanol) offer superior characteristics such as higher HOV (stronger cooling effect to reduce NOx formation), CV (higher power output), CN (reduces ignition delay), density and viscosity (better fuel flow for better atomisation), and flash point (for safer storage and handling) as compared to lower alcohol like ethanol."
