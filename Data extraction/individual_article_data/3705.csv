0,Introduction,"The presence of hydrogen sulfide in the hydrocarbon fluids is a well known problem in many oil and gas fields. Hydrogen sulfide is an undesirable contaminant which presents many environmental and safety hazards. It is corrosive and toxic. Consequently, the industry should be removed from hydrocarbons or reduce its concentration to an accepted value in the production, to satisfy the product specification requirements and safety. Hydrogen sulfide scavenging is one of the preferred methods to minimize the operational risks and corrosion in crude oil production facilities. Hydrogen sulfide is a colourless gas, with bad odour and soluble in water, alcohol, oils, and many other solvents. It is considered a weak acid and extremely toxic to human and even animal as well as extremely corrosive to most metals. It causes cracking of drill pipe and tubular goods, and destruction of testing tools and wire lines. The hydrogen sulfide content of fluids in the permeable formations of oil wells has an important impact on the economic value of the produced hydrocarbons and production operations [1,2]. Typically, the sulphur content of crude oils is in the range of 0.3–0.8 wt% and the hydrogen sulfide content of natural gas is in the range of 0.01–0.4 wt%, although concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas of up to 30 wt% have been reported. Several recent reports have claimed a systematic increase in the sulphur content of crude oils over the past 10–20 years and anticipate further significant increases in the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in both oil and natural gas [3,4]. The correlation between the hydrogen sulfide concentration of produced hydrocarbons from the Norwegian continental shelf and the reservoir temperature; above about 110 °C indicates that the hydrogen sulfide content of produced hydrocarbons increases exponentially with temperature, while below this temperature the hydrogen sulfide concentration is negligible [5–7]. The souring of petroleum reservoirs caused mainly by sulfate-reducing bacteria which can increase the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in produced fluids to the point of making it necessary to inject expensive chemical scavengers in production pipelines so that the corrosion and operational risks can be minimized [8–10]. In-line scavenging of hydrogen sulfide is the preferred method for production of crude oil containing low hydrogen sulfide levels from subsea wells, especially where the well is tied back via a flowline to a host facility at which there is no provision for H2S scavenging and/or where H2S removal the facility is too expensive and/or impractical to install [11–15]. As a result of this method, the hydrogen sulfide content of the crude oil that is delivered to the platform is reduced to a safe and commercially acceptable level while reaction by-product formation is manageable. The formation water provides a carrier phase for some of the reaction products and enhances the dispersion of some insoluble reaction products in the co produced aqueous phase [16–23]. This study focuses on the estimation of optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time according to the available wells field data obtained from an existing oil well in the Petrobel Company in Egypt as in Table 1 ."
1,Objective function and constraints,"The following empirical equation was derived from [15,16,17,25] and used as the objective function to obtain the optimum H2S scavenger retention time at a temperature within the range 40–55 °C using the software program LINGO [24]. The regression coefficients C1, C2, C3, and C4 had the same values as in [25]. t = 3.78541 ∗ 24 ∗ l n Y in yout ( C 1 ∗ G V C 2 ∗ D C 4 ∗ P ∗ Y out ) ∗ ( G V / ( R J C 3 ∗ V ) ) Where t = Retention time, min RJ = H2S Scavenger dose injection rate, liter/day. yin = Inlet H2S concentration, ppmv. yout = Outlet H2S concentration, ppmv. GV = Gas molar mass velocity, lb mol/(hr ft2). D = Pipe diameter, inch. P = Pressure, psig. V = Crud e oil velocity, m/sec C1, C2, C3, and C4 are regression coefficient constants. Constraints 80 ≤ P ≤ 600 100 ≤ yin ≤ 25,000 1800 ≤ Gv ≤ 33,000 20 ≤ V ≤ 100 2 ≤ D ≤ 12 300 ≤ RJ ≤ 1700."
2,Results and discussion,"The optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time as the objective function is affected by the parameters, injection dose rate, pipe length, pipe diameter, gas molar mass velocity, inlet concentration of H2S and pressure. The optimization results are obtained for different values of these parameters using the software program LINGO. The results of the effective parameters on the optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time are studied in the following section."
3,Optimum H2S scavenger retention time at different pipe diameter,"3.1 Optimum H2S scavenger retention time at different pipe diameter Fig. 1 shows the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different values of pipe diameter. At pipe diameters equal to 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 10 and 12 in., the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time are equal to 15, 21.42. 27.6, 39.45, 50.8. 61.8 and 72.65 min, respectively. At these pipe diameters the optimum values of pressure, H2S inlet, pipe lengths ft, H2S outlet and gas molar mass velocity, (lb mol/(hr ft2)) are 500 psig, 5000 ppmv, 1200 ft, 10 ppmv and 33000 lb mol/(hr ft2), respectively. The estimated results show that, increasing the pipe diameter caused an increase of the optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time due to the reduction of gas velocity and turbulence and hence, absence of good mixing between the scavenger and the crude."
4,Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different velocities of crude oil.,"3.2 Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different velocities of crude oil. Fig. 2 shows the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different crude oil velocities. At velocities equal to 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 m/sec the output results of optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time are equal to 60, 40, 30, 24, 20, 17.12, 15, 13.32, 12 min, respectively. These values are obtained at pressure 600 psig, H2S inlet concentration 6000 ppmv, pipe diameter 2 in., H2S outlet 10 ppmv and gas molar mass velocity 33000 lb mol/(hr ft2). Consequently, by increasing the crude oil velocity, the values of retention time of H2S scavenger will be decreased due to good mixing between the scavenger and the crude oil."
5,Optimum H2S scavenger retention time at different inlet concentrations of H2S,"3.3 Optimum H2S scavenger retention time at different inlet concentrations of H2S Fig. 3 shows the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different values of inlet concentrations of H2S in crude oil ppmv. At inlet H2S concentration equal to 100, 1000, 3000, 6000, 9000, 12000, 15000, 18000, 21,000 and 25,000 ppmv the output results of optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time are equal to 12.65, 15.55, 17.57, 18.68, 19.47, 20.1, 20.6, 21, 21.04 and 21.06 min, respectively. These values are obtained at pressure 600 psig, crude velocity 80 m/sec, pipe diameter 2 in., H2S outlet 10 ppmv and gas molar mass velocity 33000 lb mol/(hr ft2). The estimated results show that the effect of inlet concentrations of H2S in crude oil had a marked effect on the optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time, increasing the inlet H2S concentration caused an increase in the optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time because it is desired to reduce it to a minimum value below 10 ppmv before processing."
6,Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different pressures,"3.4 Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different pressures Fig. 4 shows the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different pressures. The effect of different pressures on the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time is estimated. When the pressures are 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 psig, the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time are 27, 24, 21.5, 14.34, 10.74, 7.16, 5.4, 4.3, 3.6 min. respectively. These values are obtained at inlet concentrations of H2S in crude oil 6000 ppmv, crude velocity 80 m/sec, pipe diameter 2 in., H2S outlet 10 ppmv and gas molar mass velocity 33000 lb mol/(hr ft2). In general by increasing pressure will cause scavenger molecules to come closer to H2S molecules thus providing better contact"
7,Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different injection dose rates.,"3.5 Optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different injection dose rates. Fig. 5 shows the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time at different injection dose rates. The effect of different injection dose rates on the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time is estimated. When the injection dose rates are 300, 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1600 and 1700 L /day, the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time are 73, 40, 27, 25, 21.37, 18.6, 17.52, 16.55, 15.68 min, respectively. In general by increasing the injection dose rates of the optimum values of H2S scavenger, the retention time will be decreased due to complete reaction between H2S scavenger and H2S in the crude oil."
8,Conclusions,"The optimum value of H2S scavenger retention time for scavenging hydrogen sulfide gas from the multiphase fluid produced at the available wells field data in one of the petroleum companies in Egypt at different conditions was studied using the software program LINGO. The following points can be estimated from the previous results: • By increasing the crude oil velocity, the values of retention time of H2S scavenger will be decreased due to a good mixing between the scavenger and the crude oil. • Increasing the pipe diameter caused an increase of the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time due to the reduction of gas velocity and turbulence and hence, the absence of good mixing between the scavenger and the crude. • By increasing the injection dose rates of H2S scavenger, the retention time will be decreased due to the complete reaction between H2S scavenger and H2S in the crude oil. • By increasing the pressure the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time will be decreased because increased pressure will cause scavenger molecules to come closer to H2S molecules thus providing better contact • By increasing the inlet concentrations of H2S in crude oil, the optimum values of H2S scavenger retention time will be increased, as it is desired to reduce it to a minimum value below or equal to 10 ppmv before processing."
