0,Introduction,"Potable water in several domestic areas not only contains organic toxins, but also significant amounts of nitrate, which both have adverse effects on human health [1,2]. To mitigate these issues, photocatalysis is a promising technology, in particular if oxidation of organic toxins to CO2 [3,4], could be combined with the in situ generation of hydrogen [5,6], needed for reductive elimination of nitrate by heterogeneous catalysis [7]. Both reactions (generation of hydrogen, and reductive elimination of nitrates) could e.g. be performed sequentially in domestic appliances, designed on the basis of microreactor technology [7]. The photocatalytic process of oxidative decomposition of organics and hydrogen formation by reduction of protons, involves photo-excited states, i.e. electrons and holes (see for a schematic illustration Fig. 1 ) [8,9]. Photogenerated holes when reaching the semiconductor surface induce the formation of radical species, such as hydroxyl radicals, or organic radicals by reaction with surface adsorbed organic compounds (Fig. 1). Usually conversion of the radical species and organic contaminants subsequently leads to formation of CO2 and H2O [4,8]. Several reports demonstrate that such decomposition of contaminants is feasible in anaerobic conditions, with simultaneous formation of hydrogen (Fig. 1) [10,11]. The catalyst most commonly used to induce the above illustrated reactions, is TiO2 (and specifically P25) [12,13], with a bandgap of 3.2eV and a conduction band (E CB) energy lower than the standard redox potential of hydrogen (E (H+/H2) 0V at pH 0), which makes hydrogen production thermodynamically feasible [14]. Unfortunately, hydrogen evolution is usually associated with low apparent quantum efficiency [8]. The reason is a high recombination rate between the photogenerated holes and electrons, before achieving the desired redox processes on the semiconductor surface [8]. This problem can be overcome by loading TiO2 with noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Au, Cu, or Rh [8,9,14,15]. These metals create effective surface sites for proton reduction, thus diminishing recombination of electrons and holes [14]. Decomposition of several organic compounds has been studied in anaerobic conditions, leading to production of hydrogen [16,17], such as alcohols [16,18], sugars [19], organic acids [16,20], and others [5,21]. Alcohols are the organic compounds that induced the highest rates in hydrogen evolution, likely due to their high susceptibility towards adsorption on oxidic surfaces and subsequent oxidation [22]. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the effectivity of Platinized TiO2 (P25) in the decomposition of methyl orange (MO), a dye that is often used as model compound in studies involving decontamination of wastewater, and the simultaneous production of hydrogen in the presence of excess MeOH. MeOH is known to induce hydrogen evolution very efficiently [9]. Both anaerobic, and oxygen lean conditions will be discussed, the latter condition representing water to be purified in domestic appliances."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. Those include chloroplatinic acid, methanol and methyl orange. The photocatalyst material, P25 TiO2, was obtained from Evonik Industries. The solvents (water and acetonitrile) used in the HPLC analysis were purchased from Biosolve."
3,Preparation of Pt-TiO2,"2.2 Preparation of Pt-TiO2 Deposition of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 P25 with an estimated weight loading of 0.5wt-% was performed using a photodeposition procedure [23,24]. To this end, an aqueous suspension of TiO2 P25 (0.5gl−1) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 0.5gl−1) was stirred for 30min in the dark and then MeOH was added (1M, 3ml). The suspension was illuminated (radiation intensity 3.21mWcm−2 at 375nm) for 5h. The powder was collected by centrifugation, and washed three times consecutively with ethanol (20ml), and finally with distilled water (20ml). The powder was dried overnight at 90°C."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments The equipment used for photocatalytic reactivity evaluation consists of three parts: a reactor, a gas chromatograph and a LabView interphase to control gas flow rates induced by mass flow controllers. A cylindrical batch reactor was used with an internal volume of 50ml. In the lid of the reactor a small window (fused silica of 0.5cm diameter, which allows 90% transmission of radiation) was incorporated, to allow illumination of the solution from the top. The light source used was a 120W high pressure mercury lamp from Dr. Gröbel UC-Elektronik GmbH, with a spectral range from 280 to 650nm, from which the light was introduced in the reactor through an optical fiber at a light intensity of 82mWcm−2 (measured from 300 to 400nm, at a distance from the window of 1cm). A micro gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a Parabond Q column (10m) and a TCD detector was used for the determination of H2, O2 and N2 concentrations [25]. The working volume of the aqueous photocatalytic suspension was 15ml, which was continuously agitated by magnetic stirring at 300rpm. In this study several aqueous solutions were prepared to compare photocatalytic activity, including MeOH (2.48M, or otherwise as stated) or mixtures of MeOH (2.48M) and methyl orange (MO), (0.06mM, or otherwise as stated). All reactions were performed at neutral pH (∼7). Two photocatalysts were tested with a concentration of 1gl−1, being TiO2 and 0.5% Pt–TiO2. Before initiating the photocatalytic reaction, the aqueous solution was purged with argon, or argon containing 20% O2 (5mlmin−1, to saturate the aqueous solution with O2), for 30min in the dark. The total time of illumination was 60min during which an argon (Ar) flow of 5mlmin−1 was continuously purged through the reactor."
5,Analysis of MO decomposition,"2.4 Analysis of MO decomposition From the same reactor used for determination of hydrogen production, samples were taken out periodically and centrifuged at 7000rpm for 5min to remove catalyst particles. Subsequently the samples were analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy and liquid HPLC (Agilent 1100 Series). The HPLC method involved the separation of the organic compounds in the sample using a mixture of water and acetonitrile (75:25) as eluent, and applying a flow rate of 0.3mlmin−1. The sample volume injected into the reverse phase column (All Chromolith Merk C18 column 100mm×3mm i.d.) was 10μL at room temperature (21°C), using an autosampler. Detection was performed using mass spectrometry (Bruker MS Esquire 3000+). The separated products were ionized using positive Electrospray Ionization (+ESI). The MS ionization conditions were: a flow rate of 0.5mlmin−1, a nebulizer gas pressure of 30psi, a dry gas flow of 0.3lmin−1 , and a dry gas temperature of 325°C."
6,Results,
7,Characterization of 0.5% Pt–TiO2,"3.1 Characterization of 0.5% Pt–TiO2 The Pt–TiO2 sample was analyzed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF, Bruker S4 Pioneer) in order to quantify the platinum loading. The loading determined by XRF amounted to 0.44wt%. The particle size of Pt was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM300ST-FEG) and the composition of the presumably Pt particles confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Noran System Six). The results of the TEM and EDX analyses are shown in Fig. 2 . From the TEM micrograph a Pt particle size variable between 3 and 5nm could be determined (Fig. 2a)."
8,Effect of Pt deposition on hydrogen production activity of TiO2,"3.2 Effect of Pt deposition on hydrogen production activity of TiO2 Fig. 3 shows the results obtained from the illumination of aqueous suspensions with and without methanol in the presence of two photocatalysts (TiO2 and 0.5% Pt/TiO2). In the absence of methanol, hydrogen production was not observed for both catalyst compositions. From the aqueous solution with MeOH (2.48M) hydrogen evolved in measureable quantities significantly higher for the Pt/TiO2 catalyst than for the TiO2 catalyst (see insert for the trend in activity). The initial rise in concentration is due to non-steady state behavior (flush out) of the continuously stirred tank reactor, (CSTR), which requires approximately 10min. Then a steady state in hydrogen rate of approximately 0.1μmol H2 g−1 cat min−1 is reached for TiO2, although initially the rate is somewhat higher. The initial rate induced by 0.5% Pt/TiO2 amounts to 7.5μmol H2 g−1 cat min−1, which slowly decays to a steady state rate of 5.5μmol H2 min−1 g−1 cat (Fig. 3). The Apparent Quantum Efficiency (AQE), taking into account a flux of photons of about 3.25×10−5 molmin−1(calculated on the basis of 82mWcm−2light intensity, 0.5cm window diameter, and an average wavelength of 365nm (the dominant mercury emission line in the UV), and an average rate of hydrogen production of 8.25×10−8 molmin−1(based on 15mg of catalyst), amounts to approximately 5.5% (assuming 2 photons are required per mole of H2)."
9,Effect of process parameters on H2 production in anaerobic conditions,"3.3 Effect of process parameters on H2 production in anaerobic conditions 3.3.1 Effect of the initial MeOH concentration Different initial concentrations of MeOH were used in order to determine the optimum for hydrogen production (Fig. 4 ). For all MeOH concentrations tested, an initial maximum in hydrogen production rate can be observed (after about 10min), followed by a significant decrease in rate until steady state is reached, variable in quantity for each initial MeOH concentration. Fig. 4b shows that the hydrogen formation rate initially strongly depends on the MeOH concentration, which dependency exponentially decays to close to zero order at MeOH concentrations above approximately 1M. These phenomena are similar to those reported by Patsoura et al. [17]. In view of the constant rates observed in the CSTR, we do not expect significant deactivation of the catalyst. Fig. 4 also indicates the experiments are fairly reproducible at high methanol concentrations, since for every different methanol concentration a fresh amount of catalyst was used. 3.3.2 Effect of MO on MeOH induced hydrogen formation The effect of MO on the MeOH induced hydrogen production rate was determined for various MO concentrations, at a fixed concentration of MeOH of 2.48M. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 5 . First, in the absence of MeOH, hydrogen production was below the detection limit of the TCD detector. Apparently MO is not able to stimulate hydrogen formation over Pt/TiO2 to a significant degree at the concentration levels tested (0.09M). Further, at a low concentration of 0.06M, the presence of MO had very little effect on the MeOH induced hydrogen production. However, increasing MO concentration, some remarkable changes were observed. First, the hydrogen formation appears to be delayed and the delay time increases as a function of MO concentration. The maximum hydrogen concentration peak is observed at minute 8 for 0.06 and 0.09mM, and shifts to minute 23 at the highest concentration of methyl orange (0.31mM). Second, the maximum in amount of hydrogen produced is higher in the presence of MO, while the transient reaching steady state levels also requires somewhat longer times. The peak in hydrogen production rate obtained in the presence of MO equals to about 9μmol H2 g−1 cat min−1. In order to determine the photocatalytic decomposition of MO, samples were collected after certain illumination intervals and analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy and LC–MS. The results of MO mineralization in the absence or presence of MeOH are shown in Fig. 6 a. After 10min of illumination full dis-colorization of MO was achieved, while in the presence of MeOH this required even less time. To identify potential compounds formed from MO in the applied anaerobic conditions, LC–MS analysis was performed. A species with m/z of 172 (Fig. 6b) was obtained after 10min of illumination, which we could assign to the formation of a hydrogenated fragment of MO, to be discussed later."
10,Quantification of H2 production in oxygen lean conditions,"3.4 Quantification of H2 production in oxygen lean conditions As stated in the introduction, photocatalytic hydrogen production is likely very much dependent on the presence or absence of oxygen in the water feed. In purification devices to be applied in practice, the water feed will likely contain oxygen (air). It is therefore relevant to study the effect of solved oxygen on the transients described in Fig. 5. To introduce oxygen in the solution, argon with 20% volume of O2 was purged for 30min prior to starting illumination. During illumination the purge consisted again of pure Ar. Fig. 7 shows the effect of dissolved oxygen on the MeOH induced hydrogen production transients, in the absence or presence of MO. Clearly, in the absence of MO, the presence of oxygen (□) induces a delay of about 10min before the hydrogen concentration maximizes and decays to steady state. In the simultaneous presence of MO ( ) and oxygen, the delay in hydrogen production is significantly longer than with MO alone (compare Fig. 5), and the attainable steady state hydrogen concentration lower. In order to further understand the importance of oxygen in MO decomposition, the photocatalytic decomposition of MO in the absence or presence of MeOH was again followed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. 8 a) and LC–MS (Fig. 8b) analysis. Fig. 8a shows that the presence of oxygen significantly prolongs the illumination time needed to achieve full dis-colorization (90min, compare Fig. 6), while again the presence of MeOH accelerates this, reducing the time needed for full color elimination to 30min. LC–MS analysis revealed that the intermediate with m/z of 172 was not formed in significant quantities in aerobic conditions after 10 or 30min of reaction, 30min being the time at which full dis-colorization was obtained."
11,Discussion,
12,The necessity of Pt for H2 evolution from MeOH solutions,"4.1 The necessity of Pt for H2 evolution from MeOH solutions In the present study, hydrogen production was not observed, when MO was reacted in anaerobic conditions (in the absence of MeOH), see Fig. 3. While the absence of hydrogen formation for TiO2 P25 is in agreement with literature [26], several studies have reported formation of hydrogen with simultaneous decomposition of contaminant molecules for Pt containing catalysts [5,15,21]. The absence of hydrogen production with 0.5% Pt–TiO2 in the present study is probably related to the adsorption and azo-bond cleavage of MO, which likely progresses over Pt sites preferably as compared to proton reduction, inducing reduction of color intensity and the formation of the mass fragment 172 m/z (Fig. 6). We assume that oxidation of water to H2O2 is the hole consuming reaction. Contrary to MO, MeOH was efficient in inducing hydrogen formation, small over TiO2 (maximum at ∼0.15μmol H2 min−1 g−1 cat), but significant (∼7.5μmol H2 g−1 cat min−1) over 0.5% Pt–TiO2 (Fig. 3). The mechanism of MeOH induced hydrogen formation over 0.5% Pt–TiO2 will be discussed in the following."
13,MeOH assisted hydrogen formation,"4.2 MeOH assisted hydrogen formation In anaerobic conditions, two reactions of MeOH in aiding the production of hydrogen can be proposed. In the first Reaction (1), MeOH will help to increase the efficiency of proton reduction over Pt by reacting with photogenerated holes, and producing CO [24]. (1) CH 3 OH ( 1 ) +4h + ↔ λ = 375 nm Pt/TiO 2 4 H + + CO ( g ) The four protons react over the Pt sites with photo-excited electrons to produce hydrogen. The other light induced reaction is oxidation of MeOH to formaldehyde, occurring over the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles, again followed by formation of hydrogen by reduction of protons over the Pt sites. The overall process is represented by Reaction (2) [9,15,22]. (2) CH 3 OH ( 1 ) ↔ λ = 375 nm Pt/TiO 2 H 2 CO ( 1 ) + H 2 ( g ) Finally, consecutive reactions of formaldehyde to formic acid (3), and formic acid to CO2 (4) have also been proposed to contribute to hydrogen formation in anaerobic (reductive) conditions. (3) H 2 CO ( g ) +H 2 O ( 1 ) ↔ λ = 375 nm Pt/TiO 2 HCO 2 H ( 1 ) +H 2 ( g ) (4) HCO 2 H ( 1 ) ↔ λ = 375nm Pt/TiO 2 CO 2 ( g ) +H 2 ( g ) From the catalytic data reported in the present study, we cannot discriminate which of the products of methanol conversion is most important. However, we anticipate Reaction (1) is relevant, based on the initial transient in hydrogen production rate. We speculate this initially decreasing rate is related to poisoning of Pt sites by CO formed in the (partial) oxidation mechanism by Reaction (1). CO is a well-known poison for Pt anodes in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) and in fact is reported to prevent the commercial application thereof [27,28]. At some point the extent of poisoning, and competing hydrogenation reactions are apparently in equilibrium, and the hydrogen formation rate reaches steady state."
14,Explaining H2 formation transients from MeOH and MO mixtures in anaerobic conditions,"4.3 Explaining H2 formation transients from MeOH and MO mixtures in anaerobic conditions Some remarkable observations regarding the MeOH induced hydrogen formation in the presence of MO at anaerobic conditions can be made (Fig. 5): (i) hydrogen formation is delayed by the presence of MO at concentrations larger than 0.06mM, (ii) the maximum in hydrogen formation is enhanced in quantity and shows a slower transient to steady state, and (iii) MO dis-colorization is faster in the presence, than in the absence of MeOH. These observations confirm that the Pt catalyst is substrate selective with favorable affinity for MO as compared to protons, as previously indicated in Section 4.1. The reductive discolorization reaction is illustrated in Fig. 9 . Since no other intermediates were observed which could be assigned to possible MeOH–MO reactions, we assume the explanation for acceleration of NN hydrogenation induced by MeOH is similar to the explanation for hydrogen formation, and due to favorable hole scavenging and occurrence of Reaction (1). Once MO has fragmented, the Pt surface is available for proton reduction to produce hydrogen, explaining the concurrent rise in hydrogen production with the decreasing color intensity of MO. What is obvious is that MO fragments (Fig. 9) enhance the maximum attainable hydrogen production in the presence of MeOH. We speculate this might be related to sulfate formation on the TiO2 surface by consecutive oxidation of e.g. mass fragment m/z 172. Sulfate formation has been previously reported to promote activity and photonic efficiency. Sulfates can efficiently react with holes generating sulfate radicals, thus improving the apparent quantum efficiency by avoiding electron–hole recombination, and likely enhancing methanol oxidation rates [29–31]."
15,Explaining H2 formation transients from MeOH and MO mixtures in oxygen lean conditions,"4.4 Explaining H2 formation transients from MeOH and MO mixtures in oxygen lean conditions Dissolved oxygen delays MO dis-colorization, as well as hydrogen evolution observed in Figs. 7 and 8. The significant delay by the presence of oxygen in the dis-colorization of MO is in agreement with the hypothesis that dis-colorization needs photogenerated electrons and occurs reductively over Pt sites (Fig. 10 ). We anticipate that oxygen competes for these electrons. The fate of the superoxide and hydroperoxyl radicals formed by reduction of oxygen [13], is likely to react with MeOH, rather than MO, given the significantly higher concentration of MeOH. After the delay, oxygen in solution is mostly converted and the reactions follow the processes discussed for anaerobic conditions. We assume that the acceleration of MO dis-colorization induced by MeOH is again due to favorable hole scavenging, enhancing apparent quantum efficiency. This lowers the concentration of MeOH, on which hydrogen formation was demonstrated to be dependent in Fig. 4, and thus explains the lower steady state hydrogen production rates."
16,Conclusions,"The data reported in this study demonstrate that photon–electron stimulated Pt nanoparticles have multiple catalytic functions. The following order in reactant selective reduction activity was observed experimentally: O2 >MO>H+. This order in reactivity is based on: (i) MeOH induced hydrogen formation is inhibited by the presence of MO, and (ii) MO dis-colorization and hydrogen formation (by H+ reduction) are negatively affected by the presence of oxygen. We demonstrate that MeOH is oxidatively converted by reaction with holes, diminishing probability of electron–hole pair recombination, and explaining the promotion in the dye dis-colorization reaction (both in the absence or presence of oxygen). CO is likely a dominant product of MeOH oxidation in anaerobic conditions, in agreement with CO poisoning of Pt being at the origin of the frequently observed maximum in hydrogen production. For practical application of concomitant methanol induced hydrogen formation and dye degradation, Pt/TiO2 induced photocatalysis is not practically feasible, due to the strong reactant selective activity of the Pt nanoparticles. Moderation of the Pt particles, e.g. by alloying, allowing simultaneous, rather than consecutive processing of oxygen reduction, dye conversion, and production of hydrogen, might lead to improvements. At the same time, the photonic efficiency of dye degradation might be improved by combining TiO2 with favorable semiconductor substrates, such as silicon, commonly used in construction of photocatalytic microreactors."
