0,Introduction,"Ionomers have enabled numerous technologies such as transdermal drug patches, oxygen barrier films to prevent food spoilage, water electrolysis for H2 and O2 production, sensors, antibacterial coatings, flow batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells [1–9]. A proton-exchange membrane (PEM) and anion-exchange membrane (AEM) or quaternary ammonium (QA) ionomer serve a critical role in selectively transporting ions [10–14]. These technologies are dependent upon the spatial arrangement and connectivity between ion-rich and ion-poor domains, which impacts material strength, durability, and transport of ions and molecules. Ionomer research efforts have predominantly focused upon PEMs [9]. The state-of-the-art PEM is DuPont's Nafion, which is based upon a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). This material has excellent conductivity, electrochemical stability, and long-term durability [15–22]. It's high conductivity has been attributed to ion-transport channels created by microphase separation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains [15–22]. Multi-block PEM copolymers with localized hydrophilic blocks containing sulfonic acid groups have been found to be effective at producing ionomer performance equivalent or better than Nafion. This is partly due to a phase-separated morphology with enhanced interconnected ion domains [23–25]. Their transport properties are strongly correlated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic block length [26–29]. These PEM studies provide structure-property insights that are needed to design ionomers with high ion conductivity, dimensional stability, and selective transport. Similar synthetic strategies are being developed for QA ionomers using sequential hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks to improve hydroxyl conductivity and physical properties [30–36]. Most commercially available AEMs are based upon poly(styrene) or poly(vinylbenzyl chloride), which are cross-linked with divinylbenzene and blended with other nonionic polymers or fabric supports [30–32]. A variety of AEMs such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) [37,38], poly(ether imide) [39,40], poly(vinyl alcohol) [41,42], poly(olefin) [43], poly(phenylene) [44,45], poly(arylene ether) [11,46,47], poly(sulfone) [36,48], and poly(arylene ether ketone) [49] have been studied. These efforts have been devoted to improving membrane ion conductivity, durability, and chemical stability. However, unlike PEM ionomers, there are still no commercially available AEMs that serve as a standard or benchmark, and structure-property relationships are still needed for it. QA functional groups must create an effective pathway for ion transport. Increasing their density decreases the ideal distance (l) between conductive groups, which leads to the development of a continuous network that facilitates ion transport [50–52]. Percolation theory has successfully described ionomer transport or conductivity (σ) based upon water fraction (c), a critical water fraction (c o ); an universal constant (β), and an apparent conductivity (σ o ) that is given as σ = ( c − c o ) β σ o [53]. The β term only depends on the spatial dimensions of the conductive phase that is independent of material composition, structure, statistical properties, and morphology. This model has been successfully used to describe random to ordered ionomers and inorganic materials, which is not limited to composition, morphology, and conductive domain size and spatial arrangement [54,55]. The ionomer's σ o can be estimated using the Nernst-Einstein using an effective diffusion coefficient (D eff ), ion-group concentration density (C i ), temperature (T), and Faraday's constant (F) [56]. A generalized Stefan-Maxwell membrane model can be used to account for diffusional resistance to transport due to structure using the expression D eff = D i / τ where τ relates to the ion's normalized diffusional path-length and D i is its apparent diffusivity. The value C i can be described by the number of water molecules per functional group (λ), and the individual molar volumes of water (V W ) and polymer (V m ) to give C i = 1 / ( V m + λ V w ) . The general relationship assumes dissociated ions are at equilibrium and is given by σ = D e f f F 2 / ( R T ) C i . Cornelius and co-workers used this relationship to model ion transport behavior within a sulfonated poly(phenylene) and poly(arylene ether) blend, and an anionic poly(t-butylstyrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene-b-sulfonatedstyrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene-b-t-butylstyrene) with a morphology ranging from random to non-random [7,55]. Oosawa-Manning counterion condensation theory ideally describes a rigid-rod linear polyelectrolyte within a salt solution with dissociated functional groups interacting with numerous counterions [57–59]. This theory does not consider ionomer composition, morphology, chain flexibility, ion group and domain size, extent of ion group dissociation, spatial arrangement of functional groups, and interaction between adjacent polyelectrolyte chains. However, it does describe a critical linear separation distance (λ b ) between a functional group's electron-charge (e) of a rigid polyelectrolyte in a solution. This separation distance is defined by the dielectric constant (ε) of the solution evaluated at an energy k b T. This charge to charge distance is the Bjerrum length ( λ b = e 2 / ( ε k b T ) ), which is 7.135 Å for a polyelectrolyte in water (ε = 78.5) at 25 °C. The ratio λ b /l is the Manning parameter (q o = λ b /l), which predicts the onset of counterion condensation when q o is greater than unity. For example, 100% sulfonated poly(styrene sulfonate) used to create a polyelectrolyte solution with a q o = 3.0 underwent a fractional amount of counterion condensation [59]. Wohlfarth et al. used a commercial disodium-3-3′-disulfoante-4,4′-difluorodiphenylsulfone monomer (sMSO2-207) with number average molecular weight (Mn) of 414 g/mol with an ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of 4.83, a monosulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) oligomer (sPSO2-142) with a Mn of 5400 g/mol and IEC 7.04, and hypersulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPSO2-220) with a Mn of 44,000 g/mol and IEC 4.55 to study this effect [60]. sPSO2-220 had an ion-mobility (μ) at infinite-dilution of 9.35e-5 cm2/V-s in liquid water at 25 °C. The sPSO2-220 pellet's μ versus water volume fraction (ϕ w) had increasing ion-mobility that was proportional to proton conductivity (σ). Its approximate μ ranged from μ = 7.04e-4 cm2/V-s at ϕ w = 0.32 (D H+ = 1.69e-7 cm2/s, q o = 1.04, and σ ∼ 10.3 mS/cm) to μ = 2.53e-2 cm2/V-s at ϕ w = 0.52 (D H+ = 6.07e-6 cm2/s, q o = 0.93, and σ ∼ 76.7 mS/cm). The lower μ values as compared to its infinite-dilution value (9.35e-5 cm2/V-s) were attributed to incomplete ion-dissociation due to counterion condensation. This effect was demonstrated using sPSO2-220 at 120 °C and 50% relative-humidity (RH) with all functional groups not fully ionized and less than six waters per sulfonated group. Sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) conductivity continually increased with IEC until a maximum σ of 148 mS/cm was reached at an IEC of 4.55 with an approximate q o = 1.20 (sPSO2-220). Ionomer conductivity decreased beyond this IEC that was attributed to counterion condensation [60]. Their work revealed a maximum conductivity existed with these hypersulfonated and water soluble poly(phenylene sulfone) ionomers indicating functionalization limitations. In this study, a multi-block poly(arylene ether sulfone)-based copolymer series containing quaternary ammonium (QA) groups were systematically synthesized using different hydrophilic and hydrophobic block lengths. Random copolymers with a similar ion-exchange capacity (IEC) or mmol of –N+(CH3)4 groups per gram of dry polymer (meq/g) were synthesized, and their properties compared to non-random ionomers. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic block length relationships were studied relative to swelling and transport. AEM composition was characterized using FT-IR and 1H NMR. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic block size relationships were probed by measuring membrane hydroxide conductivity; water and alcohol uptake, dimensional swelling, and alcohol transport."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetramethyl bisphenol A (TMBPA), 4,4′-difluorodiphenyl sulfone (PSF), and bisphenol A (BPA) were obtained from TCI America. N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), toluene, potassium carbonate (K2CO3), 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE), trimethyl amine (TMA) aqueous solution (7.3 M, 50 wt %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and methanol (MeOH) were obtained from Fischer Scientific. NMR analysis was done using dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO‑d 6) and d-chloroform obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. All chemicals were used without further purification unless otherwise specified. 4,4′-Difluorodiphenyl sulfone was recrystallized in toluene and dried at 75 °C under vacuum. BPA and TMBPA were recrystallized from ethanol and dried at 75 °C under vacuum. K2CO3 was dried at 100 °C for 24 h under vacuum."
3,Random copolymer synthesis,"2.2 Random copolymer synthesis A random copolymer series was prepared in a one-pot polycondensation reaction using TMBPA, PSF, and BPA in the presence of K2CO3 (Scheme 1 ). The monomer stoichiometry was controlled to create a TPBP-[Z] where Z represents the TMBPA mole fraction within it. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic repeat unit mole fractions are c and (0.5-c). An example polymer synthesis condition is the following: TMBPA (0.6399 g, 2.25 mmol), BPA (0.4283 g, 2.25 mmol), and PSF (1.1441 g, 4.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMAc (110 mL), toluene (35 mL), and K2CO3 (1.5894 g, 11.5 mmol) were added. The reaction medium was reacted at 157 °C for 17 h using an argon purge. At the end of the polymerization reaction, the polymer solution was cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, and precipitated in 200 mL of MeOH. A fibrous solid was collected, washed with MeOH, and the solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h. The random copolymer's number average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity (PDI) was determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). GPC was performed with a PSS SECurity system equipped with an isocratic pump, autosampler, and a refractive index detector. The system was operated at 25 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Tetrahydrofuran was used as the mobile phase (effluent). Molecular weights were determined by calibration with polystyrene standards."
4,Multiblock copolymer synthesis,"2.3 Multiblock copolymer synthesis Hydrophilic (TP-[X]) and hydrophobic (BP-[Y]) oligomers were synthesized with a block length X and Y in kg/mol that are represented as TP-[X] and BP-[Y]. Oligomer number average molecular weight (Mn) was controlled using monomer molar ratio during synthesis. An example TP-[X] and BP-[Y] oligomer synthesis with an 18 kg/mol and 8 kg/mol molar mass is the following: TP-[18k] was synthesized within a flame dried 300 mL three-neck round-bottom flask containing TMBPA (3.5549 g, 12.5 mmol), PSF (3.4537 g, 13.6 mmol), and K2CO3 (2.5914 g, 18.8 mmol). The polymerization reaction was carried out in 60 mL of DMAc, and 25 mL of toluene using an argon atmosphere. The flask was equipped with Dean-Stark trap, condenser, mechanical stirrer, and gas inlet and outlet. The temperature was maintained at 137 °C for 5 h before the toluene and residual water were removed as an azeotrope using distillation. After residual water removal, the temperature was raised to 157 °C and the reaction proceeded for 17 h with vigorous stirring with an argon purge. BP-[8k] was synthesized using a stoichiometric amount of PSF (1.7517 g, 94 mmol) and BPA (2.1164 g, 83 mmol) in a clean and flame dried 250 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask. K2CO3 (1.9503 g, 14.1 mmol), 35 mL DMAc, and 15 mL toluene were added to the round-bottomed flask and refluxed at 137 °C under argon flow for 5 h. Residual water was removed as an azeotrope and the reaction temperature was increased to 157 °C for 17 h using an argon atmosphere. TP-[X] and BP-[Y] oligomer block length were determined using GPC. A TP:BP-[X:Y] multi-block copolymer was polymerized using two distinct blocks (TP-[X] and BP-[Y]) shown in Scheme 2 . An example synthesis using TP[12k] and BP[7k] oligomers involves their reaction at 157 °C for 17 h under argon using appropriate amounts of K2CO3, DMAc, and toluene within a flame dried 250 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer mixture was centrifuged and then poured into 200 mL of MeOH to precipitate it. A fibrous solid was collected using filtration, washed in methanol, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h. This yielded a multi-block copolymer referred to as TP:BP[12k:7k]. The copolymer's molecular weight (Mn = 32 kg/mol) was measured using GPC. Oligomer, random, and multi-block copolymer Mn and PDI are summarized in Table 1 ."
5,Synthesizing random and multi-block ionomer copolymers,"2.4 Synthesizing random and multi-block ionomer copolymers TP:BP-[X:Y] and (R)-TPBP-[Z] copolymers were brominated by dissolving it in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (C2H2Cl4), and reacting it with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the bromination agent, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the radical initiator. Brominated TP:BP-[12k:7k] and (R)-TPBP-[4] were prepared using the following procedure: 1.0 g of the parent polymer, N-bromosuccinimide (1.3349 g, 7.5 mmol) and benzoyl peroxide (0.0454 g, 1.9 mmol) were completely dissolved in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (15 mL), which was contained within a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser. The reaction media was slowly heated to 80 °C under argon flow in order to prevent gel formation. When the mixture reached 80 °C, C2H2Cl4 began to reflux and the solution turned blood red. After 3 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature, and precipitated using excess ethanol. A yellow-fibrous solid was collected that was washed with water, and dried in a vacuum at 35 °C to yield a tan-brown solid (1.21 g). The degree of functionalization (DF) of the brominated polymers was measured by taking the ratio of the integrals in the 1H NMR spectra for the protons in the bromobenzylmethyl group to the protons adjacent to the sulfone group (Scheme 3 ). Ionomer membrane IEC was determined from the ratio of the 1H NMR peaks from the benzylic protons that are adjacent to the quaternary ammonium (QA) group, and the aromatic proton's integral sum from the adjacent sulfone group. The ionomers IEC, DF, and % functionalization is summarized in Table 2 ."
6,AEM membrane formation,"2.5 AEM membrane formation AEM materials are usually prepared from brominated copolymers by two separate methods. The first technique uses solid-sate quaternization that is done by soaking a brominated polymer in a TMA solution to yield a heterogeneous membrane. The second technique converts a brominated polymer solution into a quaternary functionalized ionomer that is solution-cast into a homogenous material. In this study, a brominated polymer was dissolved in CH2Cl2 to create a 5–10% w/w solution, which was solution-cast on a flat glass substrate, and CH2Cl2 was controllably evaporated from the solution at room temperature over a 24 h period. Brominated polymer membranes were removed from the substrate by immersing in water and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h to remove residual solvent and water. A heterogeneous AEM was created by immersing a brominated polymer membrane into a 50% w/w trimethylamine/water solution. The bromomethylbenzyl group conversion to benzyltrimethylammonium occurred within a sealed container for 48 h at room temperature. The final AEM was soaked in 1 M NaOH for 48 h at room temperature in a closed container to replace bromide ions by hydroxide ones. Finally, the membranes were washed with deionized (DI) water several times to completely remove excess NaOH, and stored in DI water for further analysis."
7,Characterization and measurements,"2.6 Characterization and measurements 2.6.1 1H NMR and FT-IR 1H NMR spectra of all synthesized polymers were recorded for structural characterization and validation of functionalization. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer using 5 mm tubes. The solvent for neutral polymers was CDCl3 and DMSO‑d 6 was used for quaternary ammonium-bearing polymers with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. FT-IR absorption spectra of the copolymers in the membrane form were recorded using a Thermo-Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer with an ATR accessory containing a diamond crystal. FTIR spectra were recorded on membrane samples of thickness 30–50 μm with a resolution of 0.4 cm−1. 2.6.2 Thermal stability The thermal stability of the HCO 3 − form AEMs was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a Q50 TGA analyzer (TA Instruments Corp., USA). The temperature was increased from room temperature to 150 °C and held for 20 min to remove residual moisture from the sample. Samples were then heated from 50 °C to 650 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. 2.6.3 Small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) were performed using a Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.542 Å) operating at 40 kV and 44 mA. SAXS sample-to-detector distance was 30 cm, and the scattering vector (q) varied between 0.042 and 1.42 nm−1. The value q is related to its scattering angle (θ), and x-ray wavelength (λ) using q ≡ 4 π / λ s i n [ θ / 2 ] . Average sulfonated inter-domain spacing (d) within a film was estimated based upon its maximum primary scattering peak (q max ) using the relationship d = 2 π / q . The 2θ range for WAXS was 2–50° with the incident angle (θ) covering a q range from 0.14 to 3.51 Å−1. The apparent d-space was calculated using Bragg's equation: nλ = 2d sin(θ). 2.6.4 Ionomer membrane WU, AU, SR x , SR z , λ, σ, and ϕ w Anion exchange membrane water uptake (WU) was measured after immersing the membranes in deionized water at room temperature for 48 h. The fully hydrated membranes were taken out of water, swabbed quickly to remove surface water and weighed immediately its wet mass (W wet ). The membranes were then dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h to obtain its dry mass (W dry ). Membrane WU was calculated using Equation (1) and data summarized in Table 3 . (1) W U = W w e t − W d r y W d r y × 100 % Membrane alcohol uptake (AU) was measured after immersion for 48 h at room temperature using vacuum dried materials. Alcohol swollen materials were removed from the solvent, quickly swabbed to remove excess surface solvent, and immediately weighed to determine W wet . Its W dry was evaluated after drying at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h. Membrane AU using MeOH, ethanol (EtOH), propanol (PrOH), and isopropanol (iPrOH) was determined using Equation (2) and summarized in Table 3 using three different samples. A sample variability of less than 8% was calculated indicating statistically significant changes between ionomer based upon composition and block size. (2) A U = W A − W d r y W d r y × 100 % Membrane dimensional changes in the x-axis (length), y-axis (width), and z-axis (thickness) were measured dry and wet. Its initial dry-length (L dry ) and dry-thickness (t dry ) were compared to its wet-length (L wet ) and wet-thickness (t wet ). A swelling ratio in the x-axis (SR x ) was calculated using L dry and L wet given by Equation (3). The y-axis membrane swelling ratio (SR y ) was found to be equal to SR x . This measurement was based membrane's dry-width (W dry ) and wet-width (W wet ) shown in Equation (3). A swelling ratio in the z-axis (SR z ) was determined from t dry and t wet based on membrane thickness changes given by Equation (4). A Vernier scale was used to measure L dry and t dry after drying at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove any residual water. All wet membrane L wet and t wet measurements were determined after equilibrating in DI water for 48 h at room temperature. The membrane's SR x and SR z ratios were determined using three different samples with a variability of less than 10% indicating statistically significant results based upon composition, IEC, and processing technique. The calculated SR x and SR z ratios are summarized in Table 3. (3) S R x = L w e t − L d r y L d r y = S R y (4) S R z = t w e t − t d r y t d r y The average number of water molecules per quaternary ammonium group called the hydration number (λ), was calculated from the IEC of the membrane, the dry mass of the sample, the mass of water absorbed ( m H 2 O ), and molecular weight of water ( M W H 2 O ) as given in Equation (5). The λ variability between ionomer samples was less than 5% based upon three membranes that indicate statistically significant results. (5) λ = m H 2 O / M W H 2 O I E C × m d r y × 1000 Material density (ρ A1) measurements were collected using a Mettler Toledo XS205 analytical balance fitted with a Mettler density kit. The measurement is based upon Archimedes' principle that relates a sample's dry mass (m A1 ) measured in air with its buoyant mass (m A2 ) evaluated within an auxiliary liquid. These changes are related to the densities of the auxiliary liquid (ρ aux ) and air density (ρ air = 0.0012 g/cm3). The ρ A1 relationship between air, liquid, and sample mass is given by Equation (6). Prior to a density measurement, all materials were dried in a vacuum oven at least one day at 200 °C. Heptane was used as the auxiliary liquid because no film was soluble in it. The solution and film were allowed to come to equilibrium at 25 °C before measuring the buoyant mass. The experimental error was approximately 0.008 g/cm3 (1.2%), which was attributed to surface wetting characteristics. These results are summarized in Table 3. (6) ρ A 1 = m A 1 m A 1 − m A 2 ( ρ a u x − ρ a i r ) + ρ a u x The volume fraction of water (ϕ w ) within each sample was evaluated using the water volume (V w ) that is directed related to the water's mass (m w ) and density (ρ w ) at 25 °C. The total swollen volume was related to sample volume (V A2 ) and V w . The ϕ w values were predicted using Equation (7) that are summarized in Table 3. (7) ϕ w = V w V w + V A 1 = m w / ρ w m w / ρ w + m A 1 / ρ A 1 Membrane conductivity (σ) was measured using an Autolab PGSTAT302 N over a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz under fully hydrated conditions. All membrane measurements were done at 30 °C in a thermally-controlled chamber in degassed DI water to minimize its exposure to air and CO2. Membrane thickness (t) and width (w) was measured in its swollen state prior to an impedance test. Temperature was controlled using an isothermal water bath (Thermo Scientific Inc.). A two-probe method was used to measure its in-plane resistance (R) with a BekkTech LLC test cell (Teflon cell). The distance between the Pt reference electrodes (L) was 0.5 cm, and the membrane's cross-sectional area (A = t*w). The membrane's bulk electrical resistance (R) was obtained from a Nyquist impedance plot by interpolating the high-frequency arc to the x-axis obtained from AC impedance data (Z′, the real part of the impedance at high frequency, i.e. intercept of the impedance semicircle with Z’’- axis on the complex plane) [5,7]. Through-plane membrane measurements were done using a 0.526 cm diameter stainless steel disks coated with Pt to clamp it. Membrane σ was calculated using five samples based upon Equation (8). The through-plane and in-plane membrane hydroxide conductivity (σ┴ and σII) measurements were estimated using the ion mobility differences between hydroxide and bicarbonate previously validated by Varcoe et al. [61] The technique involves multiplying bicarbonate conductivities by a factor of 3.8 that has been shown to be valid in several studies [11,36,61–63]. A σ variability of less than 2% indicated statistically significant changes between samples. (8) σ = L R A A multiblock poly(arylene ether sulfone) was developed by the McGrath group using a bisphenol sulfone monomer (BPS) that was stoichiometrically reacted with a 100% sulfonated bisphenol sulfone monomer (BPSH-100) [24]. A BPSH-BPS ionomer series was synthesized using phenoxide terminated BPSH-100 and BPS end-capped with hexaflurobenzene (HFB), which is ideally shown in Scheme 4 . BPSH-100 oligomer block length is X and BPS is Y that is designated as BPSH-BPS [X:Y]. The multiblock ionomer block lengths in this study were 15k, 10k, and 5k. The ionomer's WU, AU, SR x , SR z , λ, σ, and ϕ w are summarized in Table 4 [12,24]. 2.6.5 Alcohol permeability Membrane alcohol permeability (P) was measured at 25 °C using a PermGear Side-Bi-Side diffusion cell equipped with a refractive index detector for monitoring the change in alcohol concentration versus time using 1.0 M alcohol. An ionomer membrane was used to separate the solute and permeate chambers. A given test temperature was controlled by flowing a liquid through a diffusion cell with a double-walled jacket. Individual cell and internal membrane concentration is assumed to rapidly reach steady-state; and liquid mass transfer resistance and water flux are negligible. These boundary conditions leads to the following mathematical solution shown in Equation (9) [44,64–66]. The solute concentration change with time (t) within the solute-rich (cSR) and water-rich (cWR) compartments of the molecule of interest in the membrane), and these initial concentrations are C S R o and C W R o at time zero. The membrane's active transport area (A), thickness (l), solute-rich cell volume (V L ), and water-rich volume (V R ) are given by Equation (9). V L and V R are assumed to remain constant throughout the course of the experiment. The membrane thickness was determined after immersion in 16 MΩ water at 25 °C before a permeability experiment. (9) P = l At ( 1 / V L + 1 / V R ) ln ( C S R o − C W R o C S R − C W R ) 2.6.6 Percolation Ionomer amination percolation experiments were carried out by immersing a brominated membrane in aqueous TMA solution (50 wt%) at room temperature. This was followed by collecting sample hydroxide conductivity at 30 °C as a function of conversion time. All the samples were fully converted into their hydroxide forms by treating a membrane with 1.0 M NaOH for 48 h. Membrane percolation was determined based upon four samples that had a variability of less than 5% indicting statistically significant results."
8,RESULTS and DISCUSSION,
9,1H NMR,"3.1 1H NMR TP:BP-[12k:7k] chemical structures were investigated using 1H NMR with CDCl3 and TMS as the solvent and internal reference (Fig. 1 ). Comparative 1H NMR spectra in Fig. 1 revealed a new peak l’ at 4.35 ppm that appeared to correspond with bromobenzyl protons (Ar-CH2Br), and the characteristic signal of benzylmethyl protons at 2.1 ppm. The peaks at 1.75 were attributed to the protons of gem dimethyl groups and proton signals of the aromatic ring ranging from 6.7 to 8.0 ppm. The degree of functionalization (DF) was calculated from the integral ratio of the peaks from bromobenzyl groups (l’) to the sum of benzylmethyl and bromobenzyl groups (l’ + b’). Copolymer DF ranged from 1.09 to 3.02 that was readily controlled using NBS molar ratios (Table 2). TP:BP-[12k:7k] and Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k] were characterized using 1H NMR with CDCl3 as the solvent, and Q:N-[12k:7k] was characterized using DMSO‑d 6 as the solvent due to limited solubility in CDCl3 after quaternization. A new peak at 3.12 ppm (k’’) corresponds to the methyl protons in the quaternary ammonium groups (-N-CH3). The peaks at 7.28 ppm (s) and 7.30 ppm (s’) in TP:BP-[12k:7k] and Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k] spectra were assigned to CDCl3 and DMSO‑d 6 peak appeared at 2.52 ppm (s’’) in Q:N-[12k:7k] spectrum. The peaks between 7.0 and 7.2 ppm in TP:BP-[12k:7k] spectrum arise from the phenyl ring protons in TP unit, and become increasingly difficult to analyze after bromination and quaternization due to peak splitting and overlapping which call for further investigation. The peak at 3.37 ppm (l’’) was assigned to the methylene protons adjacent to the quaternary ammonium groups (Ar-CH2-N). The appearance of k’’ at 3.12 ppm and the complete disappearance of bromobenzyl peak at 4.35 ppm (l’) verified successful quaternization of Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k] into Q:N-[12k:7k]."
10,QA ionomer FT-IR,"3.2 QA ionomer FT-IR TP:BP-[12k:7k], Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[12k:7k] FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 . A C–Br group wavenumber at 556 cm−1 is observed for Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k] not present with TP:BP-[12k:7k], which confirms that bromine was successfully introduced into the multi-block (Fig. 2A). Shakila et al. calculated this C–Br stretching vibration at 560 cm−1 [67]. A characteristic C–Cl and C–F peaks have been observed at 802 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1 wavenumbers [68–70]. The C–Br wavenumber appears at the lower end of the carbon-halogen (C-X) absorption fingerprint region due to reduced mass (μ) and absorption frequency (υ), bond force constant (k), and speed of light (c). The value μ = (m 1 *m 2 )/(m 1 + m 2 ) where m 1 and m 2 are the individual atom's molar mass (Mw) divided by Avogadro's Number (N A ). A single bond has a k = 5e5 dyne/cm that is used to model the C-X bond strength that separates m 1 and m 2 . Hook's law can be used to ideally predict ν that is given by Equation (10). (10) υ = 1 2 π c k μ The following C-X absorption bands have been reported in order of increasing μ: C–H (2850-3000 cm−1) > C–C (1000 cm−1) > C–F (800-1000 cm−1) > C–Cl (700-800 cm−1) > C–Br (500-700 cm−1) > C–I (500-600 cm−1) [70]. The ideally predicted C–H, C–C, C–F, C–Br, and C–N frequencies are: 3021 cm−1, 1189 cm−1, 1074 cm−1, 973 cm−1, 902 cm−1, and 1146 cm−1. These are much higher above equation reflects the change in absorption frequency as the atom's mass and bond strength changes based upon Hook's law [69]. In Fig. 2B, a new absorption peak at 1642 cm−1 is assignable to the vibration of C–N bond on the QA group within Q:N-[12k:7k]. This suggests the successful introduction of C–N group into Br-TP:BP-[12k:7k]. A similar peak was also observed by Chen et al. at 1646 cm−1 [70]. The peaks at 1580 and 1482 cm−1 were ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of C=C bond on phenyl rings. These peaks are the characteristic of phenyl backbone that has been reported by Zhang et al., Chen et al.; at 1597 cm−1 and 1488 cm−1 [70,71]. Both 1H NMR and FT-IR results confirm that parent polymers were converted into QA based ionomers."
11,Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] thermal stability,"3.3 Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] thermal stability TGA traces for random (R)-QN-[Z] and multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] films with different block lengths are shown in Fig. 3 . All ionomers displayed excellent thermal stability between 60 °C and 120 °C. The initial weight loss (less than 5 wt%) is observed between 170 and 190 °C, which was due to residual solvent evaporation. The TP:BP-[12k:12k] material with no functional groups displayed a single-step degradation at 425 °C due to polymer aromatic backbone decomposition. However, Q:N-[12k:12k] exhibits a two-step degradation pattern: decomposition of QA functional groups between 200 and 360 °C, and polymer backbone degradation above 400 °C. Such two-step degradation pattern results from the functionalization of polymer backbone with QA groups that was observed by Mohanty et al. and Zhu et al. in other QA functionalized block copolymer AEMs [72,73]. Identical degradation behavior is observed between random (R)-QN-[3] and multi-block Q:N-[12k:12k] films, which have equivalent composition and similar IEC (1.91 and 1.87 meq/g). This result suggests that AEM thermal stability and degradation are dependent on backbone composition that is independent of random or block architecture. The TP:BP-[12k:12K] conversion into Q:N-[12k:12K] decreases its polymer backbone degradation onset temperature from 422 °C to 405 °C, which further decreased to 377 °C for Q:N-[6k:3K] shown in Fig. 3. This indicates that functionalization with QA groups, and hydrophilic and hydrophobic block composition affects the onset temperature of backbone degradation."
12,"Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane WU, λ, and SR","3.4 Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane WU, λ, and SR Multi-block and random copolymer ionomer's WU versus IEC is shown in Fig. 4 with N117 added as a reference material. Multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membrane WU had the following trend: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[6k:Y]. At an IEC below 1.25 meq/g, both Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes had similar WU that were lower than N117 (WU 35 wt% and IEC = 0.91). This WU change with IEC is typically indicative of enhanced hydrophilic domain connectivity. A percolation threshold is observed near an IEC of 1.25 that precedes a rapid rise in water absorption. Below this threshold the multi-block and random copolymer ionomers exhibit similar WU that is independent of block size and functionality. The maximum WU of the multi-blocks is Q:N-[24k:14k] is 172 wt%, Q:N-[12k:7k] is 112 wt%, and Q:N-[6k:3k] is 78.6 wt% at an IEC near 2.75. The trend is attributed to bigger ion domains possessing improved connectivity due to a larger reaction area with TMA. At the multi-block ionomers highest IEC, Q:N-[12k:7k] and Q:N-[24k:14k] differ in their WU behavior than Q:N-[6k:3k], which is attributed to block size. The decreased WU rate of change versus IEC may be due to improved integration of the non-functionalized block within the ionomer. This may be attributed to a balance between changes in its total free energy and chemical potential due to swelling by a solvent molecule warranting additional studies. The (R)-QN-[Z] membranes exhibit a WU that surpasses any multi-block membrane. Its WU increases from 7.16 wt% at an IEC = 0.52 meq/g to a staggering 223 wt% at an IEC = 2.74. This elevated WU causes the membrane's physical stability to degrade with storage-time in water. These changes are assumed to be generated by swelling pressures that accelerate material creep causing additional brittleness. The random and multi-block ionomer's λ versus IEC is shown in Fig. 5 . Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] have fewer water molecules per QA group (4−10) at an IEC below 1.5 meq/g. These are lower than N117 that has a λ = 21.4 at an IEC of 0.91. At an IEC greater than 2.5 meq/g the hydration numbers are significantly larger with (R)-QN-[4] possessing a λ = 45.2. In general, λ for (R)-QN-[Z] increased slowly until its percolation threshold was exceeded that appears near an IEC of 1.25 meq/g. This random material tended to have λ values that were strongly dependent upon the concentration of QA groups within it. The multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] ionomer's λ was equivalently dependent upon IEC and hydrophobic block length. The approximate trend with these all QA ionomer materials was that λ increases with IEC, and that it decreases with longer hydrophobic block length. The Q:N-[24k:Y] series had a λ = 33.4 at an IEC = 2.86, which was the largest of the multi-block series that was followed by Q:N-[12k:Y] (λ = 26.8 and IEC = 2.84) and Q:N-[6k:Y] (λ = 16.0 and IEC = 2.72). It is notable that Q:N-[6k:Y], Q:N-[12k:Y], and Q:N-[24k:Y] membranes have a lower λ than (R)-QN at an equivalent IEC. This observation merits further investigation that must be related to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic block size, block concentration functionalized by QA groups, and film processing technique. The Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane's SR X and SR Z increase with WU is shown in Fig. 6 A and summarized in Table 3. These swelling results are similar to WU and λ changes versus IEC with a distinct difference between SR X and SR Z that is attributed to processing technique. The (R)-QN-[Z] membrane series preferentially swelled in the SR X direction versus SR z with WU ranging between 5.65 wt% to 223 wt%. A maximum SR X = 1.043 with a WU = 223 wt% occurred with (R)-QN-[4] at an IEC of 2.74 that was the largest of any ionomer. Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes at an IEC lower than 1.0 had a SR X ratio ranging from 0.044 for (R)-QN-[1] to 0.087 with Q:N-[24k:40k] that corresponded to a WU of 7.16 wt% and 9.80 wt%. Their SR Z ratios varied between 0.096 and 0.000, which may be associated with its smaller ion-domain cluster density and ionomer solution-processing. For example, at an IEC∼0.5 meq/g Q:N-[6k:17k] and (R)-QN-[1] have a SR x ranging between 0.087 and 0.044, and their SR Z varies between 0.000 and 0.096 with a WU less than 10 wt%. In general, multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes had a higher in-plane SR X swelling than through-plane SR Z until an IEC of approximately 1.25 meq/g. Above this value, a percolation threshold is characterized by an increase in SR X with a WU exceeding 50 wt%. The maximum SR x (1.043), SR z (0.444), and WU (223 wt%) is associated with (R)-QN-[4] that surpassed all multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membranes. The next largest swelling films In general, the multiblock ionomers had increasing swelling anisotropy in the SR Z with block size in the following order: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Yk] > Q:N-[6k:Yk]. This trend corresponded to SR Z ratios 1.044 (Q:N-[24k:14k]), 0.938 (Q:N-[12k:7k]), and 0.196 (Q:N-[6k:3k]); and SR X ratios of 0.475, 0.338, and 0.291 for Q:N-[24k:14k], Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k]. As comparisons to these results, a commercial N117 film had a WU of 35 wt% with a SR X and SR Z ratio of 0.142 and 0.161 due to membrane anisotropy occurring in its thickness direction. A multiblock BPSH-BPS-[X:Y] with [5k:5k], [10k:10k], and [15k:15k] blocks had a very large anisotropy in the film's thickness versus in-plane swelling. The membrane had a SR Z varying between 0.220 and 0.781 as compared to SR X of 0.111 to 0.104 for BPSH-BPS-[5k:5k] to BPSH-BPS-[15k:15k] at a WU of 36 wt% and 79 wt%. The Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane's swelling anisotropy was evaluated by comparing SR X versus SR Z differences summarized in Fig. 6B. A few distinct features were noted with its film swelling thickness (SR Z ) and in-plane direction (SR X ). First, multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membranes tended to have insignificant swelling in the SR Z direction at an IEC less than 1.0 that was independent of block-size. This swelling behavior in the film's thickness is offset by greater polymer chain expansion in the x-direction and y-direction ranging from 0.070 (Q:N-[24k:40k]) to 0.087 (Q:N-[6k:17k]) for SR X . Beyond this IEC the majority of Q:N-[24k:Y] and Q:N-[12k:Y] ionomers appeared to expand anisotropically with regard to its thickness versus length. For example, Q:N-[24k:24k] (IEC 1.90, SR Z 0.769, and SR X 0.200) and Q:N-[12k:12k] (IEC 1.87, SR Z 0.406, and SR X 0.204) had greater swelling in the SR Z direction as compared to SR X occurring at nearly identical IEC's. The Q:N-[6k:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes tended to swell more in the plane of the film (SR X ) versus their thickness (SR Z ). Anisotropic swelling behavior was observed by Roy and McGrath, and Fan and Cornelius using a poly(arylene ether sulfone) multiblock ionomer series possessing a lamella-like morphology. These ionomers contained a sulfonated BPSH block (X) and unsulfonated BPS block (Y) that were used to create BPSH:BPS[5k:5k], BPSH:BPS[10k:10k], and BPSH:BPS[15k:15] multi-blocks (Scheme 4) [12,24]. The BPSH:BPS[X:Y] multiblock ionomer shown in Fig. 6B had an IEC ranging between 1.30 and 1.40 and properties summarized in Table 4. Relatively uniform SR X and SR Z swelling is associated with BPSH:BPS[5k:5k], but BPSH:BPS[10k:10k] and BPSH:BPS[15k:15k] have much larger swelling in the SR Z direction as compared to SR X . This preferential SR Z swelling is similar behavior to Q:N-[24k:Y] to 0.087 (Q:N-[12k:Y]. The BPSH-BPS[X:Y] membrane anisotropic swelling behavior was attributed to its solution processing technique and lamella-like morphology [12,24]. As previously noted regarding N117, it had greater swelling in the SR Z direction. Finally, the R-QN-[Y] films appeared to change more in the SR X direction than SR Z at high IEC, and more in the SR Z dimension at low IEC. The R-QN-[4] had a SR Z = 0.444 and SR X = 1.043; and R-QN-[1] had a SR Z = 0.096 and SR X = 0.044 that may be due to processing and random composition. R-QN-[2] possessed isotropic swelling (SR Z = 0.106 and SR X = 0.100), and R-QN-[3] changed more in the plane of the film (SR Z = 0.141 and SR X = 0.163). The preliminary Q:N-[X:Y] swelling results suggest that hydrophilic-hydrophobic block size can be used to help reduce SR X anisotropic swelling noted with random ionomers. However, these preliminary results require additional efforts with a greater spectrum of material systems to understand QA ionomer membrane solid-state to solution processing."
13,Ionomer conversion and percolation,"3.5 Ionomer conversion and percolation Flory described small molecules reacting together to create a larger interconnected macromolecule using percolation theory in 1941 [74]. This theory can be used to describe charge carrier transport (conductivity) through a polymer matrix corresponding to a minimum ion-group concentration [54]. Its salient features are illustrated using Q:N-[6k:3k], Q:N-[12k:7k], Q:N-[24k:14k], and (R)-QN-[4] with an identical 28.5 mol% TMBPA concentration. Membrane in-plane hydroxide conductivity ( σ O H II ) changes versus immersion time in a TMA/H2O solution at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 7 A. At t = 0 all membrane σ O H II is non-existent because no ion-conductive pathway exists for transport that is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7B(I). As membrane immersion time increases (t > 0), bromobenyzlmethyl groups are converted into benzyltrimethylamine from the outer part to its middle (Fig. 7B). Its conductivity is zero during the first 30 min of TMA conversion referred to as Region A. Increasing WU is noted during this stage, which does not equate to an increase in conductivity. It is assumed that surface functionalization is occurring, which is not continuous through the membrane's thickness as illustrated in Fig. 7B(II). At this initial stage, ion-domains are separated and crucial connections are still missing, which is a barrier to ion transport. At longer immersion times, these “islands” grow in size and begin to interconnect to form a continuous channel referred to as “percolation” that is schematically represented in Fig. 7B(III). The membrane's ion-conductivity percolation behavior was similar with all ionomers noted between Regions A and B (Fig. 7A). At short conversion times (30–140 min), QA ionomer conductivity changes were similar in Region B that continued to increase at a constant rate. A rate change was noted by Region C that was characterized by a slow rise in conductivity with reaction time until it reached a maximum (σmax) after 4.5 days. The solid-state conversion process led to a benzyltrimethylamine mixture of “percolated” and “isolated” domains that directly impacted its conductivity. The ionomer membrane σmax conductivity had the following trend: Q:N-[24k:14k] (62.1 mS/cm) > Q:N-[12k:7k] (55.0 mS/cm) > (R)-QN-[4] (48.7 mS/cm) > Q:N-[6k:3k] (39.3 mS/cm). This ionomer σmax trend was dependent upon random versus multiblock composition, hydrophilic versus hydrophobic block-size, and conversion time. The excessive conversion time (4.5 days) required to reach σmax may provide a partial explanation for the large variation in AEM conductivity data noted throughout literature. Obtaining heterogeneously quaternized AEM morphological information using SAXS is historically notorious, and such efforts have usually been unsuccessful [11,75,76]. These ionomers are typically created from a polymer with a random distribution of benzylmethyl moieties. When this random material is converted into an ionomer its ion-domains are typically not detected using SAXS. This led Yan et al. to assume that quaternary ammonium functional group aggregation is implausible using a heterogeneously converted polymer [76]. Their heterogeneous and homogeneous ionomer processing efforts did not reveal discernible ion-clusters using SAXS. The heterogeneous membrane's indiscernible SAXS result was duplicated using a highly aminated random R-QN-[3] and multiblock Q:N-[12k:12k], which had no obvious ion-domain peaks shown in Fig. 8 . These negative SAXS results may be associated with electron density and molar mass similarities between carbon and nitrogen that require additional studies. However, Zhang et al. recently used SAXS to reveal interconnected ion-conducting clusters within a heterogeneously quaternized poly(arylene ether ketone) [49]. Furthermore, Wayz and Cornelius proved that a homogeneous functionalized AEM had enhanced ion transport and ionomer durability versus a heterogeneous processed one, which was attributed to improved ion-domain clustering during processing [11]. The improved transport may be similar to the perfluorosulfonated ionomer (Nafion) structural evolution from its dry to water-swollen state investigated by Gebel [77]. Their work used SAXS to reveal considerable local ion-domain reorganization occurs as water concentration increases during its swelling impacting ion-cluster size and percolation. Average ion-domain sizes were reported to range from 8.98 nm to 3.14 nm from ionomer solution to swollen membrane [12,55,77]. These observations suggest that an ionomer must undergo some degree of local ion-domain reorganization during swelling to eventually develop into interconnected networks as schematically represented in Fig. 7B(III). The size and characteristics of these percolating channels can be probed with small molecules that will indirectly assess the effects of block size and functionalization within a multi-block ionomer. The swelling and WU differences shown in Fig. 6 revealed these are anisotropic properties that were attributed to membrane composition and processing. These swelling changes lead to chain dilation to accommodate the solvent. This typically would be observed using SAXS to show variations in the inter-domain spacing between functionalized and non-functional regions. In order to test this concept, Q:N-[X:Y] was swollen in ethylene glycol (EG) at 25 °C for several days. The swollen QA ionomer membrane through plane WAXS was examined to examine how the average spacing between chains (d-spacing) varied due to block size and functionality (Fig. 9 ). Initial results revealed an average d-spacing between chains increasing for Q:N-[X:Y] in the following order: Q:N-[12k:20k] (18.1 nm, WU = 13.4) > Q:N-[12k:12k] (15.3 nm, WU = 90.3) > Q:N-[12k:7k] (13.8 nm, WU = 112) ∼ Q:N-[12:36k] (13.5 nm, WU = 8.45). These WAXS results reveal an inverse dependence upon WU with decreasing average d-spacing associated with smaller hydrophobic (non-functionalized) block size. The outlier for this trend is Q:N-[12k:36k] that has a small WU, SR, and IEC that is close to Q:N-[12k:7k]. These results require additional studies outside the scope of this present work."
14,Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane conductivity,"3.6 Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membrane conductivity Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] in-plane hydroxide ion conductivity ( σ O H II ) versus WU is shown in Fig. 10 . The general σ O H II trend for Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] was increasing conductivity with IEC that ranged from 3.10 mS/cm ((R)-QN-[1]) to 62.1 mS/cm (Q:N-[24k:14k]) at 30 °C in DI water. The σ O H II at low IEC (below 1.18 meq/g) is rather small and increased gradually, which is attributed to limited connections between hydrophilic (ionic) domains. Ionic domains become increasingly connected with a larger IEC leading to greater conductivity and WU as noted by Wang and Zhao using an aminated multi-block poly(arylene ether sulfone) and poly(ether-imide) [36,39]. Interestingly, (R)-QN-[Z] with an IEC greater than 2.03 meq/g exhibited a higher conductivity than Q:N-[6k:Y], but still lower than both Q:N-[12k:Y] and Q:N-[24k:Y]. This is associated with hydrophilic Q6k blocks inability to form improved connections between conductive domains. Lee et al. reported similar results using a multi-block BPSH copolymer that required a minimum block length of 10k in order to significantly increase ion conduction and morphology [78]. The Q:N multi-block series in this study require a hydrophilic block length greater than 12 kg/mol to noticeably improve conductivity versus (R)-QN. The Q:N-[X:Y] membranes with an IEC above 1.75 meq/g have conductivities greater than 10 mS/cm at 30 °C with swelling and WU values exceeding what is required for an AEM based fuel cell [62,79]. Q:N-[X:Y] membranes with similar IEC and different hydrophilic block lengths had the following conductivity trend: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[Q6k:Y]. Q:N-[24k:14k] had a maximum conductivity (σmax) that was the highest for the series at 62.1 mS/cm. A σmax was observed at 54.2 mS/cm for Q:N-[12k:7k], 48.7 mS/cm for (R)-QN-[4], and 39.3 mS/cm for Q:N-[6k:3k]. The random (R)-QN-[4] (IEC = 2.74) copolymer had a lower conductivity than Q:N-[24k:14k] (IEC = 2.86) and Q:N-[12k:7k] (IEC = 2.84) at approximately the same IEC, and absorbed 1.3 to 2.0 times more water (172 wt% and 112 wt% versus 223 wt% shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3). These efforts revealed that a longer hydrophilic block improves the formation of a more continuous hydrophilic/hydrophobic network than a random copolymer. This result is consistent with Park et al. multi-block QA aromatic copolymers; and Khan and Cornelius QA poly(arylene ether) sulfone multi-block copolymers, which suggested improved ion-domain connections facilitates more efficient ion-transport than random copolymers [11,34] N117, BPSH-BPS-[X:Y], Q:N-[X:Y], and (R)-QN-[Z] film conductivities versus λ and ϕ w are shown in Fig. 11 A and B that are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. N117 proton conductivity versus λ data published by Zawodzinski et al., and Motellah and Cornelius et al., and BPSH-BPS-[X:Y] is plotted to compare with these QA ionomers (Fig. 11A) [7,80]. N117 membrane's conductivity increased with λ until a maximum was reached at 112 mS/cm and λ = 39. However, its conductivity decreased beyond this maximum due to sulfonic acid group dilution within its matrix. BPSH-BPS-[X:Y] multi-block [5k:5k], [10k:10k], and [15k:15k] ionomers λ ranged between 15.4 and 31.3 that seemed to follow N117 versus its water content and conductivity. This BPSH-BPS[X:Y] and N117 trend is speculated to be associated with common conductive moieties (sulfonic acid group). The Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] film's σ versus λ revealed increasing conductivity is clearly linked to its IEC, WU, and swelling (SR) shown in Fig. 11A. Water molecules per aminated group varied between λ = 7.65 for R-QN-[1] to λ = 45.2 with R-QN-[4]. The R-QN-[4] results are the greatest WU than any multi-block QA ionomer. In general, λ changes versus composition had the following trend: R-QN-(Z) > Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[6k:Y]. The compositional differences between aminated and sulfonated ionomers had a different conductivity versus λ trend, which is believed to be associated with functional group dissociation characteristics (sulfonate versus quaternary amine), hydroxyl versus hydronium ion diffusion rates, film processing differences, and perhaps morphology. Ionomer conductivity versus water volume fraction ϕ w within it was fit using the percolation model σ = ( c − c o ) β σ o [53–55]. N117 membrane σ versus ϕ w data was modeled using β = 1.30, c o = 0.022, and σ o = 323 mS/cm that failed beyond ϕ w where the sample was irreversibly altered due to excessive swelling [7,80]. BPSH-BPS-[X:Y] multi-block [5k:5k], [10k:10k], and [15k:15k] ionomers λ ranged between 15.4 and 31.3 that seemed to follow N117 versus its water content and conductivity. This limited BPSH-BPS-[X:Y] compositional result is believed to be primarily due to the sulfonic acid group moiety. The Q:N-[X:Y] hydroxyl conductivity data was fit with β = 1.20, c o = 0.047, and σ o = 108 mS/cm. As previously noted, the term β only depends on the spatial dimensions of the conductive phase and it has been used to model ion conductivity of random to ordered ionomers [54,55]. The apparent conductivity (σ o ) of N117 is 2.99 times larger than these AEM ionomers that is partially attributed to the hydroxyl ion-size being nearly three times bigger. A β value ranging between 1.2 and 1.3 is consistent with ionomer percolation behavior in other systems [54,55]. It is generally accepted that N117 morphology has randomly connected ion-clusters that form a bicontinuous network [19]. Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes having β similar to N117 seems consistent with ion transport through interconnected ion-domains. N117 post-treatment and processing led to a wide σ range at a fixed IEC = 0.91, which is attributed to sulfonic acid group and domain spatial arrangement changes (Fig. 11B). Q:N-[X:Y] and R-QN-[Z] processing and post-treatment relationships linked to composition, WU, SR, λ, and σ requires additional studies beyond this work. The Manning parameter q o was plotted versus H2SO4, NaOH, and NH4OH based upon the average distance between two ion groups using varying solution concentrations versus conductivity (Fig. 12 A). A maximum solution conductivity occurred with NH4OH at q o = 0.851 (λ = 17.5 and ϕ w = 0.88), q o = 0.919 based upon H2SO4 (λ = 12.7 and ϕ w = 0.81), and q o = 1.07 using NaOH (λ = 8.9, ϕ w = 0.90). Beyond this maximum σ the solution conductivity continually declined with decreasing ϕ w and λ, which is associated with incomplete ion-dissociation and counterion condensation. These ion-conductive solutions reveal that counterion condensation is dependent upon ion-type, ion-composition, and water molecules hydrating it with λ ranging from 8.9 (NaOH) to 17.5 (NH4OH). It is notable that predicted counterion condensation occurring when q o is greater than unity was not universal for these solutions. Furthermore, N117's predicted Manning parameter of q o = 0.735 does not describe its processing-dependent membrane conductivity shown Fig. 12A. Its varying conductivity is not described by q o because the Oosawa-Manning Counterion Condensation Theory was not derived to account for adjacent functional groups between chains, and changes in their spatial arrangement when swollen in water. However, N117's conductivity versus ϕ w behavior is ideally described using the percolation model σ = ( c − c o ) β σ o shown in Fig. 11B. In order to partially account for ionomer swelling and adjacent functional groups, an adjusted Manning parameter (q o,adj.) was calculated using its functional group density (IEC) that varies with its swelling properties. This adjusted q o,adj. was plotted versus in-plane conductivity for N117, Q:N-[X:Y], and (R)-QN-[Z] shown in Fig. 12B. N117 swollen membranes had a maximum conductivity of 112 mS/cm at q o,adj. = 0.56 and ϕ w = 0.56. Its conductivity decreases either because of functional group dilution by water during swelling or insufficient water hydrating sulfonate groups (Fig. 12B). The random (R)-QN-[Z] material had similar behavior as N117 with a maximum conductivity that decreased due to functional group dilution or low ion-conductive group density. All Q:N-[X:Y] ionomers displayed increasing σ with IEC and q o,adj. with the following block-size trend: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[6k:Y]. In general, Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] did not display any counterion condensation occurring near an IEC equal to 2.17 and q o = 1, which was observed by Wohlfarth et al. using hypersulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPSO2-220) [60]. Their sPSO2-220 results are attributed to its complete functionalization, which gives it the unique ability to completely dissolve in water that occurs with H2SO4, NaOH, and NH4OH. This hyperfunctionalized characteristic is not present with the majority of ionomers being designed to balance physical properties with transport and device function. As previously discussed, the challenges with this theory is that it does not account for collective interactions between adjacent polyelectrolyte chains, composition, morphology, spatial arrangement of functional groups, ion-group type, ion-domain size, chain flexibility, and extent of ion-group dissociation. Finally, these experimental efforts should be investigated in concert with the role of “salt” induced counterion condensation that defines this theory. Q:N-[X:Y] and R-QN-[Z] membrane through-plane hydroxide conductivity ( σ O H ⊥ ) versus WU is shown in Fig. 13 A. The (R)-QN-[Z] membrane's σ O H ⊥ ranges from 17.1 mS/cm (IEC = 0.52) to 2.30 mS/cm at an IEC = 2.74 that is attributed to its excessive swelling. QN-[6k:Y] and QN-[12k:Y] conductivity decreased 44% and 41% with maximum conductivities of 24.1 mS/cm (IEC = 0.58) and 29.1 mS/cm (IEC = 0.63). QN-[24k-Y] membrane conductivity decreased from 39.0 mS/cm (IEC = 0.71) to 29.8 mS/cm (IEC = 2.86) that is the least of this ionomer series (24%). A clear σ O H ⊥ versus WU trend is the following: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[6k:Y] > (R)-QN-[Z]. Interestingly, increasing IEC leads to a decreasing through-plane conductivity in Q:N-[X:Y] and (R)-QN-[Z] membranes that differ from σ O H ll . This σ O H ⊥ conductivity decrease with swelling is attributed to QA group and domain spatial distances being highly sensitive in this direction. QN membrane SR Z swelling versus σ O H ⊥ is shown in Fig. 13B. QN membrane's with the largest σ O H ⊥ and smallest SR Z changes had the following behavior: Q:N-[24k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[6k:Y] > (R)-QN-[Z]. These trends reveal that increasing hydrophilic block length and IEC governs its overall conductivity for any given QN ionomer. Its anisotropic properties were observed with their directionally-dependent swelling being attributed to its solid-state processing, and film-forming techniques (Fig. 6). Overall, QN membrane conductivity dependent IEC, WU, and SR Z implies that it is strongly correlated with bulk water concentration and transport orientation. Anisotropic σ O H ⊥ and σ O H ll membrane conductivity versus ϕ w behavior for Q:N-[X:Y], (R)-QN-[Z], and Nafion (N117 and N112) is assumed to be due to functional group spatial arrangement, material composition, IEC, and film processing techniques. R-QN-[Z] had the largest σ ll / σ ⊥ ratios of the QN series ranging from 0.36 (ϕ w = 0.084) for R-QN-[1] up to 21.1 (ϕ w = 0.74) with R-QN-[4] shown in Fig. 13C. Similar anisotropic ionomer conductivity behavior was observed by Soboleva and Holdcroft et al. using a series of commercially processed Nafion membranes (N112, N1135, N115, N117, and N211) [81]. Their efforts revealed that Nafion processing produced σ ll / σ ⊥ ratios ranging from 1.4 for N112 and N117 to 1.0 for N211. Their work included studying sulfonated poly([vinylidene difluoride -co- hexafluoropropylene] -b- styrene) (PVDF-sPS) multi-block copolymer ionomers, which were used to explore relationships between morphology and anisotropic proton conductivity. The PVDF-sPS multi-block ionomer morphology transitioned from disordered to perforated lamellae (PVDF-sPS (perf.)) into exclusively lamellae (PVDF-sPS-(lamella)). The PVDF-sPS-(perf.) and PVDF-sPS-(lamella) membrane's σ ll / σ ⊥ conductivity ratios were 2.4 and 5.4. These highly anistropic ionomers are attributed to composition, morphology, and solution-casting technique [81]. N117, N112, PVDF-sPS (perf.), and PVDF-sPS (lamella) membrane σ ll / σ ⊥ conductivity ratios versus ϕ w (Fig. 13C). The QA ionomer σ ll / σ ⊥ conductivity anisotropy increased in the following manner: (R)-QN-[Z] > Q:N-[6k:Y] > Q:N-[12k:Y] > Q:N-[24k:Y]. The σ ll / σ ⊥ changes for Q:N-[24k:24k] and Q:N-[24k:14k] were 0.47 (ϕ w = 0.11) to 2.08 (ϕ w = 0.69) that is the smallest of this series. Q:N-[12k:36k] and Q:N-[12k:7k] had a σ ll / σ ⊥ ratio ranging between were 0.11 (ϕ w = 0.099) to 3.15 (ϕ w = 0.63). The σ ll / σ ⊥ changes for Q:N-[6k:17k] and Q:N-[6k:3k] were 0.15 (ϕ w = 0.066) to 2.90 (ϕ w = 0.51). The main σ ll / σ ⊥ differences between Q:N-[X:Y] and R-QN-[Z] appears to be greater anisotropy associated with smaller block sizes and a random composition."
15,Multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membrane AU,"3.7 Multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membrane AU Q:N-[24k:14k], Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k] membrane alcohol uptake (AU) is shown in Fig. 14 using 1 M MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and iPrOH solutions. The relative polarity of these alcohols is: MeOH (0.762) > EtOH (0.654) > PrOH (0.617) > iPrOH (0.546). A decrease in hydrophilic block size from 24k to 12k (Q:N-[12k:7k]) produced membranes that absorbed between 93.0 wt% (MeOH) to 117 wt% (iPrOH). The lowest absorbing Q:N-[6k:3k] membrane had an AU ranging from 66.0 wt% (MeOH) to 87.1 wt% (iPrOH). The iPrOH absorption into these multi-block ionomers was 87.1%, 117.3%, and 129.6%, and is greater than MeOH for Q:N-[24k:14k], Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k]. The AU within these membranes had the following trend: Q:N-[24k:14k] (IEC = 2.86 meq/g) > Q:N-[12k:7k] (IEC = 2.84 meq/g) > Q:N-[6k:3k] (IEC = 2.72 meq/g). This trend is expected because a Q:N ionomer with a larger ion domain can absorb more alcohol. The ionomer's AU gradually increased with decreasing alcohol polarity that led improved solubility. Overall, the alcohol amount absorbed in the ionomer is dependent upon its Flory-Huggins chi parameter (χ) between polymer and alcohol."
16,Alcohol permeability through multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membranes,"3.8 Alcohol permeability through multi-block Q:N-[X:Y] membranes Alcohol permeability (P) through Q:N-[24k:14k], Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k] membranes were evaluated using 1 M MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and iPrOH solutions (Fig. 15 ). This Q:N[X:Y] series was chosen because the remaining ionomers were either too brittle to be tested (Q:N-[6k:5k], Q:N-[12k:12k], Q:N-[24k:24k], or alcohol impermeable (Q:N-[6k:17k], Q:N-[6k:9k], Q:N-[12k:36k], Q:N-[12k:20k], Q:N-[24k:40k]). Their permeability was found to be directly proportional to AU. Alcohol transport through a multi-block ionomer can provide insight regarding the hydrophilic block size due its size or molar volume (MeOH: 40.5 cm3/mol, EtOH: 58.4 cm3/mol, PrOH: 74.8 cm3/mol, iPrOH: 76.5 cm3/mol). In general, alcohol permeability through a Q:N-[X:Y] membrane had the following behavior: MeOH > EtOH > PrOH > iPrOH shown in Fig. 15. This result demonstrated that membrane alcohol permeability was dependent upon alcohol type and hydrophilic block domain size. In general, Q:N-[24k:14k] was more permeable than Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k] had the lowest alcohol transport. MeOH permeability (P MeOH) was 1.85 × 10−6 cm [2]/s, 1.71 × 10−6 cm [2]/s, and 1.33 × 10−6 cm [2]/s for Q:N-[24k:14k], Q:N-[12k:7k], and Q:N-[6k:3k]. Q:N-[6k:3k] and Q:N-[12k:6k] membranes had a P MeOH decrease of 28.1% and 7.6%. The iPrOH permeabilities (P iPrOH) through Q:N-[24k:14k] (P iPrOH = 6.92 × 10−7 cm [2]/s), Q:N-[12k:7k] (P iPrOH = 6.30 × 10−7 cm [2]/s), and Q:N-[6k:3k] (P iPrOH = 4.79 × 10−7 cm [2]/s) were the lowest of the entire alcohol series. This difference seems counter intuitive given the larger ionomer swelling associated with iPrOH than MeOH. Ethanol and Propanol permeability (P EtOH and P PrOH) within these ionomers was between P MeOH and P iPrOH. An increase in hydrophilic domain size led to greater AU, swelling, and alcohol permeability with the following trend: P MeOH > P EtOH > P PrOH > P iPrOH. This result implies that smaller hydrophilic domains do not allow bulkier alcohol molecules to easily diffuse through it. The Q:N-[24k:14k] > Q:N-[12k:7k] > Q:N-[6k:3k] permeability trend is attributed to hydrophilic or ion domain size, and ion group concentration along its backbone. Copolymer hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains were shown to be associated with its IEC and hydrophilic block domain size. Q:N-[24k:14k] and Q:N-[12k:7k] membranes have higher alcohol permeability than Q:N-[6k:3k] even though they have similar IECs. This is attributed to longer hydrophilic blocks that are capable of forming larger hydrophilic domains with greater inter-domain connectivity. Ion domains that are bigger and more continuous led to greater alcohol permeability within a given membrane. As noted earlier, Q:N-[6k:17k], Q:N-[6k:9k], Q:N-[12k:36k], Q:N-[12k:20k], and Q:N-[24k:40k] membranes were impermeable to all alcohols used in this study. This result suggests that a critical IEC and hydrophilic/hydrophobic domain size are needed to promote alcohol transport, which is greater than hydroxyl transport due to molecule size. These results show that alcohol transport through a Q:N-[X:Y] membrane primarily occurs through water-filled hydrophilic domains, and its hydrophobic domain has very little effect upon alcohol permeability."
17,Conclusion,"A quaternary ammonium poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymer series was designed to contain controlled hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecular weight blocks. Block length impacted WU, AU, SR, σ, and alcohol permeability that are attributed to ion clustering differences that altered these properties. Hydroxyl transport, WU, and AU were dependent upon block length. At fully hydrated conditions, AEM multi-blocks with longer hydrophilic blocks had better hydroxyl conductivity as a function of IEC as compared to its random counter-part. This was attributed to greater connectivity between ionic domains due to larger hydrophilic blocks. WU and AU generally increased with increasing block length, but at similar IECs, hydrophobic block length also played a crucial role. Ionomer membrane WU and in-plane SR reduced if the hydrophobic block length was longer than the hydrophilic block. Ion domain improved with increasing the IEC that led to enhanced OH‾ conductivity. Brominated polymer to AEM conversion and its OH‾ conductivity evolution versus time was evaluated revealing ion-domain percolation that is linked to charge carrier transport. These research efforts suggest that local ion domain reorganization occurs in the swollen state during multi-block polymer conversion, which is responsible for ion cluster formation in heterogeneous AEMs. The random copolymer morphology exhibited lower WU and OH‾ conductivity. Multi-block materials with smaller ionic blocks (Q:N-[6k:Y]) exhibited properties similar to a random copolymer at comparable IECs. However, both σ and WU increased significantly with increasing block length noted with Q:N-[12k:Y] and Q:N-[24k:Y]. The multi-block ionomer observed transition strongly suggests formation of a more continuous hydrophilic-hydrophobic morphology that increases with block length based upon WU, swelling, and conductivity studies. In contrast, random copolymers had distinctly different behavior that must be associated with benzyltrimehtylamine group distribution within the AEM. These results may suggest the presence of an organizational structure and corresponding morphology in the quaternized multi-block AEMs that may be favorable for electrochemical and transport dependent applications."
