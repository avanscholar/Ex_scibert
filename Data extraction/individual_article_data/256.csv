0,Introduction,"Fossil fuel sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, regarded as non-renewable energy, have caused irreversible environmental problems including greenhouse effects and pollution emissions. To deal with environmental pollution and the energy crisis, it is more necessary and imperative to find a renewable and environmentally friendly resource to replace traditional fossil fuels. Biodiesel from animal fats and vegetable oils has been regarded as one of the prospective renewable resources to resolve energy depletion and environmental pollution, due to its characteristics of carbon–neutral [1]. Considering the large-scale production of biodiesel at present, the treatment of by-product glycerol from the biodiesel production process should not be ignored [2]. It seems a great opportunity for H2 generation using biodiesel byproduct glycerol [3]. Aqueous phase reforming (APR) as a promising method to produce inexpensive renewable H2 from biodiesel byproduct glycerol, has been studied due to low temperature and unnecessary to vaporize glycerol and water. In addition, low temperature is favorable for the reaction of water–gas shift (WGS), which means lower CO concentration in gaseous products [4]. Technical and economic comparison of hydrogen production from aqueous and gas phase reforming of glycerol is reported by Khodabandehloo et al. [5]. They concluded that the aqueous phase reforming process is the best choice. The catalysts developed and experimental conditions optimized are still challenging issues. The process of APR of glycerol includes the C–C, C–H, and O–H bonds scission to form CO (Eq. (2)). Then CO reacts with H2O to form H2 and CO2 by the WGS reaction (Eq. (3)), and the methanation reaction will also occur in this process (Eq. (4–6)). Aqueous phase reforming (APR) of glycerol can be represented: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 3 C O 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H = + 214.5 k J / m o l (2) C 3 H 8 O 3 → 3 C O + 4 H 2 Δ H = + 338.0 k J / m o l WGS reaction (3) H 2 O + C O ⇌ H 2 + C O 2 Δ H = - 41.2 k J / m o l Methanation reaction (4) 4 H 2 + C O 2 ⇌ C H 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H = - 164.9 k J / m o l (5) 3 H 2 + C O ⇌ C H 4 + H 2 O Δ H = - 206.1 k J / m o l (6) 2 H 2 + 2 C O ⇌ C H 4 + C O 2 Δ H = - 170.8 k J / m o l According to the reaction mechanisms of APR of glycerol, the ideal gas productions are CO2 and H2, so an excellent catalyst for APR can be used to present the ability in the cleavage of C–C, C–H, O–H bonds and can promote WGS, but also has to inhibit C-O bond breaking and methanation reactions. For APR, the different noble and non-noble metals including Pt, Pd, Ag, Au, La, Sn, Ni, Fe, Cu, Ce, Co, Cu, etc. catalysts have been tested for hydrogen production [4,6–13], and high activity and stability were observed by using noble metals catalysts, but the high price makes it difficult to mass-produce and apply. The low-cost Ni-based catalyst has good C–C fracture ability [14–16], but the inhibition ability to methane reaction is weak [3,17–19]. By using some metals and supports, Ni-based catalysts can be enhanced and stabilized to obtain a high yield of hydrogen in APR, and deactivate the catalysts due to coking can also be inhibited [20]. Dumesic et al. [21] reported that the addition of Sn to Ni catalyst can reduce the formation of methane by reducing the C–O fracture, and increase the production of hydrogen by increasing the C–C fracture. Manfro et al. [22] studied Ni-based catalysts supported on CeO2 by three different synthetic methods in APR of glycerol in a batch reactor at 250 °C and 270 °C. The proportion of H2 in these CeO2-supported catalysts is higher than 70%, and the fraction of CH4 is very low (<1%). Previous studies have indicated that the addition of Cu into Ni-based catalyst was inactive for C–C scission, but presents a high activity of WGS, thus increasing the hydrogen selectivity [23,24]. Rahman [25] investigated the APR of glycerol over a series of Ni and Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts supported on MWNT in a fixed bed reactor (240 °C). The presence of Cu in the catalyst inhibited the methanation reaction, which leads to enhance in glycerol conversion and H2 selectivity. Tuza et al. [26] showed that hydrotalcite-derived Ni-Cu catalysts have high catalytic activity in APR of glycerol. Ni5Cu catalyst presented the highest H2 selectivity (>80 %) at 250 °C, with the smallest amount of CO (<3 %) and CH4 (<1 %). The presence of Cu in catalysts resulted in suppression of undesirable methanation reaction to decrease methane formation and enhancement of WGS reaction to increasing hydrogen yield. In our previous studies, CeO2 was used in the formulations of Ni-based catalysts to hydrogen production from steam reforming and chemical looping reforming due to its unique redox properties of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and high concentration of active oxygen to carbon removal from the metallic Ni surface [27]. Mesoporous CeO2 with a high surface area is an excellent support to produce highly dispersed catalysts [28–33], which has been applied in many aspects, such as reverse water gas shift reaction [34], CO oxidation [28,32], CO2 methanation [29]. A crystalline uniform mesoporous CeO2 catalyst with a large surface area (0.6 mL/g pore volume) was synthesized by the colloidal solution combustion method [35]. In this work, mesoporous CeO2 supported Ni-Cu bimetallic were prepared by colloidal solution combustion method and evaluated for catalytic performance for APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. Otherwise, CaO added with catalysts can promote in-situ CO2 removal to enhance the reactions of the reaction process [36–38], so the effect of APR process with and without in-situ CO2 removal on gas products was studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The mesoporous CeO2 material was synthesized by colloidal solution combustion [34,35]. Firstly, 0.8 g CH2NH2COOH and 4 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in deionized water (10 mL). 1.0 mL of colloidal SiO2 was put into the above solution by drop and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then the solution was dried at 150 °C covernight. After the resulting powders were calcined in the muffle at 600 °C for 3 h, they were immersed in 2 M NaOH solution with stirring at 80 °C for 4 h to etch the silica. Then powder was subsequently washed three times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and dried in the oven at 110 °C to obtain pure mesoporous CeO2. Ni-based catalysts supported on mesoporous CeO2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. 0.991 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.523 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were mixed with 1 g CeO2 support in 100 mL deionized water. After stirring for 4 h, the solution was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and the dried powder was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h. Before the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol, the catalyst was reduced in flowing H2 for 2 h (60 mL/min) at 300 °C (heating at 5 °C/min) regarded as 1Ni2Cu/CeO2. Other catalysts prepared at different loading ratios and reduction temperatures were listed in Table 1 . The prepared catalysts were collected for further test and use."
3,Characterization,2.2 Characterization Textural characteristics of catalysts were measured by the Quantachrome Autosorb sorption system. The multi-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to determine specific surface areas of catalysts. N2 desorption data were calculated pore volume and average pore diameter by Barrett–Joyner–Halender (BJH) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts to identify different phases were determined by X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE). The scan speed was 6°/min over the range 50–90° in steps of 0.02°. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H2) of the catalyst was carried out on belcata II. Loading amount of metal in catalysts was measured using a plasma emission spectrometer (Thermo Fisher (ICAP 6000)). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken on ThermoFisher FEI Talos 200x. The catalyst was dispersed in an ethanol solution and deposited on an ultrathin carbon film. Chemical bond and functional group characterization of catalysts were performed using Fourier Infrared Reflectance (FTIR) (Spectrum Two). The used catalyst was dried at 110 °C before Infrared Reflectance testing. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of catalysts before and after use were performed by STA 200 under an N2 atmosphere. The weight loss of catalysts during TG experiments was recorded from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C /min.
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The APR experiments were taken in a high-pressure autoclave from HTLAB Instrument Company, with a volume of 300 mL. 0.4 g catalyst was added into an aqueous solution of 30 wt% biodiesel byproduct glycerol (150 mL) in a batch reactor. The biodiesel byproduct glycerol obtained from Dalian Chemicals Ltd mainly consisted of 92.30 wt% glycerol, 3.26 wt% soaps, 4.32 wt% methanol, 0.08 wt% esters, and 0.04 wt% others. The elemental analysis of the crude glycerol included the content of C, H, N, and S of 40.0 wt%, 9.2 wt%, 0.2 wt%, and 0.1 wt%, respectively, which indicated a higher H/C molar ratio compared to glycerol and also indicates few amounts of the fatty acid methyl esters impurities. The calorific value of 21.6 MJ/kg measured was also close to 19.9 MJ/kg for glycerol (99.0 wt%). After filling the reactor, N2 is used to exhaust the air in the reactor, and then pressurize to the initial reaction pressure (6 bar). The APR tests were performed at 225 °C for 2 h in autogenous pressure (except for the temperature change experiment), and the magnetic stirring speed was set at 600 rpm/min. After the reactor was naturally cooled to room temperature, gaseous products of H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 were collected and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GS-101, Dalian, China) equipped with TCD. The liquid products were analyzed using a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC installed with a MetaCarb 67H column, SPD-20A Dual Channel Photodiode Array UV–vis detector, and a RID-10 A refractive index detector."
5,Calculation,"2.4 Calculation The catalytic performance of the catalysts in APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol can be evaluated from hydrogen conversion, H2 yield, H2 selectivity, and CH4 selectivity.

6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of the Ni-based catalysts prepared under different conditions are showed in Fig. 1 . For unreduced catalysts of 0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2, the diffraction peaks of NiO and CuO were found in the spectrum. The peaks of the CuO phase were detected at 35.5° (−111), 38.7° (111), and 48.7° (−202), and the peak of the NiO phase appeared at 37.2° (111). However, for the reduced Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts, the corresponding peaks of Ni, Cu, and CeO2 were detected in the XRD spectra, while the diffraction peaks of NiO and CuO disappeared. The diffraction peaks of CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394) were at 2θ values of 28.5° (111), 33.0° (200), 47.4° (220), 56.3° (311), 59.1° (222), 69.4° (400), 76.7° (331), 79.1° (420) and 88.4° (422). The Ni phase peaks were detected at 2θ values of 44.5° (111), 51.8° (200), and 76.4° (220). The Cu peaks were found at 43.3° (111) and 50.4° (200). In addition, the diffraction peaks of Ni and CeO2 were found in Ni/CeO2 catalyst. The XRD pattern of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst in the range of 40° to 60° is amplified in Fig. 1(B). The increase of Cu loading on the catalyst increased the peak intensity of Cu in the spectrum. And comparing the XRD spectrum of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 catalysts at different reduction temperatures, it was found that the Ni peaks at 44.5° and 51.8° were enhanced with the increase of reduction temperature, indicating that higher reduction temperature reduced more Ni2+ to Ni. Fig. 2 exhibits the TPR-H2 profiles of Ni-based catalysts. The reduction peak of Ni/CeO2 at 270 °C was mainly caused by the reduction of free NiO species on the surface of the CeO2 [23]. The reduction peaks range from 320 °C to 470 °C were attributed to the reduction of NiO species strongly interacting with the CeO2 and partial reduction of the CeO2 [22]. Three reduction peaks of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst exhibited from 150 °C and 300 °C. The reduction peaks below 200 °C were considered to be the reduction of amorphous CuO on CeO2 [39]. The reduction peak appeared at about 200 °C, which represents the reduction of bulk CuO [40,41]. And the reduction peak at 270 °C was attributed to the reduction of free NiO [22]. The structural characteristics of the catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . CeO2 prepared by colloidal calcination had the highest SBET (93.21 m2/g) and the total pore volume (0.52 cm3/g). The addition of Ni reduced the specific surface area and porosity of the catalyst. The SBET of Ni/CeO2 was 76.45 m2/g and the total pore volume was 0.33 cm3/g. After impregnation of Cu, the SBET and total pore volume of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts was reduced to 53.99 m2/g and 0.21 cm3/g (1Ni4Cu/CeO2), respectively. But the SBET of unreduced catalyst (0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2) increased to 82.03 m2/g and the total pore volume increased to 0.37 m2/g. With the increase of reduction temperature, the SBET of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 was reduced from 58.77 m2/g to 39.31 m2/g (700-1Ni2Cu/CeO2), and total pore volume was also reduced. The average pore size of Ni-based catalysts range from 14.68 nm to 16.78 nm was lower than CeO2, which means the loading of Ni and Cu element into CeO2 reduces the average pore size of the catalyst. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms can be used to characterize the specific surface area and pore structure of the catalysts. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The isotherm of catalysts corresponds to the type IV isotherm with hysteresis loop and the diameter in the mesoporous range [35]. Fig. 4 exhibits the TEM images and the element distribution of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2. It can be seen from the element distribution diagram (Fig. (B)–(E)) that Ni and Cu elements are completely covered on the surface of CeO2 for the 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 catalyst. From the HRTEM images, the Cu, Ni, and CeO2 crystalline phases coexist in the studied Ni-Cu/CeO2 catalysts, which indicates that the Cu and Ni species existing on the prepared Ni-Cu/CeO2 catalysts can be effectively reduced to metallic Cu and Ni species by H2."
8,APR experiment,"3.2 APR experiment 3.2.1 Hydrogen conversion and H2 yield Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen conversion and H2 yield for APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. Comparing with Ni/CeO2, hydrogen conversion of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts increased to 0.21 % (1Ni1Cu/CeO2), and with the increase of Cu content, hydrogen conversion increased to 0.24 % (1Ni4Cu/CeO2). The addition of Cu effectively improved the hydrogen conversion in APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol, which was maybe due to the Cu increasing the WGS reaction. As Ajay Jha [23] reported that the highest CO conversion (85 %) was achieved by Ni-Cu/CeO2 catalyst in WGS reaction. The reduction temperatures of Ni-Cu/CeO2 affected hydrogen conversion. The hydrogen conversion decreased from 0.21% (1Ni2Cu/CeO2) to 0.12 % (700-1Ni2Cu/CeO2). And the hydrogen conversion of the unreduced catalyst (0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2) after the reaction was lower than 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2. So suitable reduction temperature was beneficial to the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. 3.2.2 Gas composition The gas composition after APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol was mainly composed of H2, CO2, CO, CH4, and N2. However, due to a certain amount of N2 introduced before each reaction and the low gas production after APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol, the content of N2 was removed to better understand the composition of gaseous products. Fig. 6 shows the main components of the gaseous products including H2, CO2, CO, and CH4. Adding Cu into the Ni/CeO2 catalyst decreased the CH4 proportion of gas production [24]. Cu element also reduced the proportion of CO from 6.05 % (Ni/CeO2) to 2.00 % (1Ni4Cu/CeO2) and increased the H2 fraction from 75.64 % to 83.52 %. The H2 fraction (75.65 %) of unreduced catalyst (0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2) was much lower than 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 (82.72 %), which means the unreduced catalyst consumes H+ in APR reaction. Thus, the H2 fraction of 0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2 was lower (67.86%), which was consistent with the lower hydrogen conversion. Otherwise, a higher reduction temperature was not conducive to the proportion of H2 in gaseous products. The H2 fraction (80.00 %) of 700-1Ni2Cu/CeO2 reduced at 700 °C was lower than that (82.27 %) of catalyst reduced at 300 °C. Gas production, H2 production, and H2 production rate are summarized in Table 3 . The ideal stoichiometric ratio of H2/CO2 for glycerol aqueous phase reforming is 2.33. However, in Table 3, the H2/CO2 ratio between 2.73 and 6.01 is higher than 2.33, which indicates that there are other reactions besides reforming reaction, as reported by Manfro et al. [13]. This shows that the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol is not only glycerol reforming but also other reactions, such as dehydration or dehydrogenation, to produce intermediate liquid products [42–44]. The addition of the Cu element into Ni-based catalyst enhanced the H2 production rate. The increase of Cu content in catalyst leads to H2 production rate increased from 125.08 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1 (Ni/CeO2) to 195.57 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1 (1Ni4Cu/CeO2). Appropriate reduction temperature of catalyst could increase H2 production rate, but with the increase of reduction temperature, H2 production rate decreased. At the reduction temperature of 700 °C, the H2 production rate (95.42 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1) was much lower than 168.97 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1 (1Ni2Cu/CeO2). Combined with SBET data, the catalyst had a smaller specific surface area at higher reduction temperature, which reduced the reaction area between catalyst surface and solution. 3.2.3 CH4 and H2 selectivity Fig. 7 describes the CH4 and H2 selectivity of Ni-based catalysts after APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. Compared with CH4 selectivity (5.89 %) of Ni/CeO2 catalyst, CH4 selectivity of other catalysts containing the Cu element was much lower. CH4 selectivity of 1Ni1Cu/CeO2, 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 and 1Ni4Cu/CeO2 were <1.1 %. H2 selectivity of all Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts was more than 98.0 %. The reduction temperature of catalyst at 500 °C and 700 °C were favorable for the formation of methane and increases the selectivity of methane in the gas production, comparing to the reduction temperature of 300 °C. 3.2.4 Effect of CaO addition on APR To further improve the yield of hydrogen and reduce the CH4 selectivity, CaO was added to the solution as an adsorbent for CO2 to enhance the WGS reaction (Eq. (3)) and inhibit methanation reactions (Eqs. ((4)–(6))) [37]. In Fig. 5, the addition of 0.2 g CaO to the reaction increased hydrogen conversion from 0.21% to 0.37% and changes the gas composition. As described in Fig. 6, the H2 fraction increased from 82.72 % to 85.08 %, but the CO fraction reduced from 2.75 % to 0.61 %. Furthermore, CaO reduced CH4 fraction from 0.11 % to 0.06 %, and CH4 selectivity declined from 0.67 % to 0.38 % over 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 catalyst. He et al. [37] have reported that the addition of CaO into 5Pt1.5Ni/CNT can enhance the fraction and selectivity of H2 and reduce the fraction of CH4 to a negligible level. Furthermore, the addition of 0.2 g CaO into 0.4 g 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 improved the H2 production rate from 168.97 to 301.92 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1 in Table 3. CaO plays a positive role in promoting the production of hydrogen and the inhibition of methane."
9,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature The reaction temperature has a great influence on the conversion [45,46]. To study the effect of temperature on the gas products, four temperatures were researched in the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. Fig. 8 describes the gas phase composition of the catalyst at four temperatures. In the experimental temperature range of 180 °C to 240 °C, the percentage of methane was very low, which indicated that the Ni-based catalyst supported on CeO2 had a good ability to inhibit methane. The percentages of CO, CO2, and H2 were relatively stable between 200 °C and 225 °C. At the temperature of 240 °C, the proportion of H2 decreased, CO2 increased, and CO decreased, which implied that high temperature was more conducive to the transformation of carbon from liquid products to gas products, as was detected by Manfro et al. [22]. Comparing Fig. 8(C) with Fig. 8(F), CaO increased the proportion of H2 and reduced the content of CO and CO2 at experimental temperature. The H2 selectivity and H2 production rate vary with temperature are exhibited in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9A, the H2 selectivity decreased with the increase of temperature for all catalysts, except for Ni/CeO2. When the reaction temperature was between 180 °C and 200 °C, the H2 selectivity was almost stable and tended to 100%. But when the temperature continues to rise to 225 °C or 240 °C, H2 selectivity was decreased significantly, especially for the catalyst of 500-1Ni2Cu/CeO2. The increase of temperature had little effect on 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 + 0.2gCaO, followed by 1Ni4Cu/CeO2 and 1Ni2Cu/CeO2, and the decrease of 1Ni1Cu/CeO2 and 500-1Ni2Cu/CeO2 was the most significant. The H2 selectivity of Ni/CeO2 (96–98%) was lower than those of catalysts containing Cu. In Fig. 9B, higher temperature favored the H2 production rate for all catalysts, which was due to the conversion of biodiesel byproduct glycerol at higher temperatures [45]. For 500-1Ni2Cu/CeO2, the H2 production rate was lower than 1Ni2Cu/CeO2, which was close to Ni/CeO2 with the change of temperature. The higher temperature is beneficial to hydrogen production, but not to H2 selectivity. The optimum reaction temperature is 225 °C, which has higher H2 selectivity and H2 production rate."
10,Kinetics analysis,"3.4 Kinetics analysis The power-law type of the general equation [47] for examining the kinetics of glycerol aqueous phase reforming is as follow: - r A = k P c glycerol n c H 2 O m where k is the apparent reaction rate; P is the reaction pressure; n and m represent the reactant orders for glycerol and water, respectively. Since the ratio of H2O/glycerol is much higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 3.0, the effect of H2O concentration in the reaction rate equation is ignored. Thus, the rate equation can be expressed as a pseudo-nth order concerning reaction pressure and glycerol concentration: - r A = k ' P c glycerol n The equivalent relationship between glycerol conversion and reaction rate in a fully mixed reactor is as follow: - r A w = F 0 x glycerol where w is the mass of the catalyst; rA represents the reaction rate of glycerol; F0 is the mass of glycerol and xglycerol is the conversion of glycerol. The aqueous phase reforming can be assumed to be a first-order reaction rate equation and ignores the effect of pressure. And the rate constant of glycerol aqueous phase reforming can be converted by using apparent first-order. k ' = F 0 l P c glycerol w × H 2 p r o d u c t i o n r a t e where l is the conversion coefficient of xglycerol and H2 production rate. The reaction rate constant, k', is expressed according to the Arrhenius equation: k ' = k 0 e x p ( - E a RT ) An Arrhenius type expression of hydrogen production rate and its variation with temperatures: H 2 p r o d u c t i o n r a t e = A e x p ( - E a RT ) Fig. 10 describes the Arrhenius plots based on the H2 production rate and temperatures. The linear relationship between ln(H2 production rate) and 1000/T of the Ni-based catalysts was obtained, which indicated that the reaction model can successfully describe the whole process of APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. The kinetics parameters for APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol over Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts show in Table 4 . The apparent activation energy (Ea) of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts was lower than Ni/CeO2 (except 500-1Ni2Cu/CeO2). The lowest Ea of 29.86 kJ⋅mol−1 indicated 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 + 0.2gCaO had a good catalytic performance."
11,Stability of catalysts,"3.5 Stability of catalysts Fig. 11 depicts the XRD patterns of used catalysts after the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol at 225 °C. It can be seen that the patterns of Ni/CeO2 and Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts have no obvious change after use. But for the catalyst of 0-1Ni2Cu/CeO2, the diffraction peaks of NiO and CuO converted to the peaks of Ni and Cu. Fig. 12 shows the FTIR spectrum of the Ni-based catalysts after reduction and use. After the catalysts used in APR, the peak of infrared spectrum appeared at 1054 cm−1, 1232 cm−1, 1378 cm−1, 1457 cm−1, 2897 cm−1 and 2981 cm−1. The wavelength at 1054 cm−1 and 1232 cm−1 is associated with –C–O stretching vibration [48]. 1378 cm−1 is associated with symmetrical –C–H bending vibration of –CH3 and 2981 cm−1 is associated with asymmetrical –C–H stretching vibration of –CH3 [49]. 1457 cm−1 and 2897 cm−1 are associated with scissor –C–H bending vibration and symmetrical –C–H stretching vibration of –CH2 [50], respectively. The infrared peaks on the used catalyst are the characteristic of glycerol [48]. TG curves of fresh 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 and used 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 are described in Fig. 13 . The weight loss of the used catalyst was 6.7% at the temperature range from 50 °C to 300 °C, which was 3.83 % greater than fresh 1Ni2Cu/CeO2. It may be caused by the decomposition of glycerol and the volatilization of crystal water in the catalyst. 3.5.1 Regeneration of catalyst and stability of the recycled catalyst To study the stability of the catalyst, the used 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 was filtered with deionized water and dried at 110 °C, and then the catalyst was calcinated at 300 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. The 50 cycle experiments of catalyst 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 are shown in Fig. 14 . The first two cycles had higher hydrogen production, and then hydrogen production tended to decrease gently, which was due to the shedding of active metals with weak adsorption on the support surface. With the increase of cycles, the production of hydrogen gradually decreased, while the production of CO2, CO, and methane slightly increased. This may be due to the deactivation of the active components of the catalyst. But even after 50 cycles, the catalyst still had high catalytic activity."
12,Analysis of solution and reaction path,"3.6 Analysis of solution and reaction path The FTIR spectra of the mixed solution after APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol are depicted in Fig. 15 . For the analyzed solution, the peak position in the spectrum was the same. The bands at 1643 cm−1 and 3000–3600 cm−1 can be assigned to the –OH bending and stretching vibrations, which is typical for alcohols [51]. The intense band at 1040 cm−1 can be associated with the C–O stretching vibration that is characteristic of glycerol [48]. Other liquid products (aldehydes, acids, alcohols) could not be detected, which was due to the lower concentration. The main reaction path of APR of Glycerol is shown in Fig. 16 [43,44]. In path I, glycerol is dehydrogenated to glyceraldehyde, decarboxylated to ethylene glycol, and dehydrated and hydrogenated to ethanol. In addition, methanol is generated by decarbonylation and dehydrogenation of ethylene glycol. In path Ⅱ, glycerol is dehydrated into hydroxyacetone, and 1,2-propanediol is formed after hydrogenation. Then ethanol is formed by the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-propanediol. It is worth noting that the reaction t path I can make glycerol produce more H2. Liquid production after APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol over different catalysts is depicted in Fig. 17 . From the reaction path, it can be seen that the formation of methanol is conducive to the production of H2. With the increase of Cu loading in the catalyst, the methanol concentration was increased from 13.13 to 32.04 g/L in the liquid phase. The catalyst 500-1Ni2Cu/CeO2 was reduced at 500 °C was not conducive to the formation of methanol. The addition of CaO further improved the yield of methanol, which was more conducive to the reforming of glycerol towards reaction path I. The intermediate products of glyceraldehyde, hydroxyacetone, and ethylene glycol had a low concentration in the liquid phase. The change of catalyst had little effect on the concentration of 1,2-Propanediol, except the addition of CaO. It may be due to the high concentration of glycerol in the solution, and only a part of glycerol is converted in the reforming reaction. The remaining glycerol in the solution was in equilibrium with 1,2-Propanediol. The addition of CaO improves the glycerol conversion, and the reaction tends to path I, which reduces the concentration of 1,2-Propanediol. Compared with other catalysts, the higher glycerol conversion is shown in Fig. 18 by using the catalyst of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 + 0.2gCaO. The reaction mechanism of increasing glycerol conversion and hydrogen production by adding Cu and CaO in the catalyst is shown in Fig. 19 . Ni is beneficial to the C–C fracture of glycerol, while Cu can enhance the WGS reaction. The surface of metal Cu is easy to adsorb carbonyl radical after decarbonylation of glycerol and hydroxyl free radical in solution, which makes the reaction easier. Therefore, the proportion of H2 and CO2 in the total gas increased with the addition of the Cu element. In addition, the addition of CaO absorbed CO2 in the gas, which enhanced the reaction process. Therefore, the production of H2 increased with the addition of Cu and CaO."
13,Conclusions,"Mesoporous CeO2 supported Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts have been investigated in the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. It is found that hydrogen conversion is enhanced with the increase of Cu content in the catalyst. The catalyst of 1Ni4Cu/CeO2 shows the highest hydrogen conversion (0.24 %) and H2 production rate (195.57 µmol⋅min−1⋅g cat−1). In addition, the Cu element also can reduce the proportion of CO from 6.05% (Ni/CeO2) to 2.00 % (1Ni4Cu/CeO2) in the gas composition. The reduction temperature of the catalyst has a great influence on the APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. High reduction temperature will reduce the activity of the catalyst. H2 production rate (95.42 µmol⋅min−1⋅g cat−1) of 700-1Ni2Cu/CeO2 is much lower than 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 (168.97 µmol⋅min−1⋅g cat−1). The addition of CaO can promote WGS reaction and inhibit methanation reaction by removal in situ CO2. The catalyst of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 + 0.2gCaO decreases CH4 fraction selectivity from 0.11 % to 0.06 %, and decreases CO fraction from 2.75 % to 0.61 %. It also can improve the H2 production rate from 168.97 to 301.92 µmol⋅min−1⋅gcat−1. The reaction temperature of APR of biodiesel byproduct glycerol has a great influence on the composition of gas production. The H2 production rate increases with the increase of temperature, but H2 selectivity is stable at the temperature range from 200 °C to 225 °C and decreases at 240 °C. Kinetics analysis indicates that catalyst of 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 + 0.2gCaO has the lowest apparent activation energy (29.86 kJ⋅mol−1), which means it has good catalytic performance. Recycle experiments indicate that 1Ni2Cu/CeO2 had excellent catalytic activity even after 50 cycles. The results of liquid-phase products indicate that the addition of the Cu element or CaO into the catalyst can make the liquid phase reaction path develop in the orientation conducive to the formation of H2."
