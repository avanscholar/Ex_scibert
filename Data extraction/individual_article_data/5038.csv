0,Introduction,"Cellulose ethanol was selected to be the candidate hydrogen fuel for its properties well fit with the requirements of safe handling, cheap, and easy transport, low toxicity and biodegradability. During cellulose ethanol to hydrogen production processes, the reactions between CO2 and biomass show a renewable energy cycle: C6H12O6 →2C2H5OH+2CO2 →10H2 →20e−. Photosynthesis first converts CO2 and H2O into carbohydrates and sugars, represented here as glucose, C6H12O6. In the reaction sequence through ethanol, fermentation converts glucose into ethanol and CO2. Furthermore, the cost of production of aqueous ethanol, as required in the hydrogen production process, is significantly lower than the cost of anhydrous ethanol which is required in internal combustion engines [1,2]. Many reactions of ethanol over metals and metal oxides have been investigated in recent years. Reactions of ethanol dehydrogenation over noble metal membrane [3–5], and reactions of ethanol over M/CeO2 catalysts [6–8] have been studied. The catalytic properties of the supported transition metal catalysts to one of the steam reforming reactions (reaction (2)) show that the selectivity of H2 for the reforming reaction is in the order: Co much greater than Ni>Rh>Pt, Ru, Cu [9–12]. The studies of ethanol steam reforming in a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) utilized the catalysts from the noble metals (Pt, Rh, etc.) to CuO/ZnO/Al2O3, NiO/CuO/SiO2, Ni/MgO and Co/MgO, they got good results: the selectivity of hydrogen of 5%Rh/Al2O3 can reach to 30.1vol.% [13–16]. The steam reforming of ethanol at about 300°C over catalyst of Cu/Ni/K/γ-Al2O3 was also studied [17,18]. In recent researches, nickel catalysts were widely studied for their good activity in ethanol steam reforming and low cost [1,19–23]. Ni/Al2O3 catalysts had been reported to be the most effective catalysts for reforming of methane with carbon dioxide, but they suffer a serious problem of carbon deposition, nickel sintering and phase transformation [24–26]. It was well known that rare earth metal oxides were of high alkalinity and were favorable for dehydrogenation of alcohols. Ni/La2O3 catalyst had been previously found to exhibit good performance under conditions (800°C) of reforming of methane with carbon dioxide, and to be very active and stable for the steam reforming of ethanol under certain operating conditions (above 300°C) [19,27], while Y2O3 was more active for dehydrogenation than oxides of other elements in La system. The reactions of ethanol steam reforming include 3 major reactions of the production of H2, CO2, CO and CH4. (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 6 H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = + 174 kJ mo l − 1 (2) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → 2 CO + 4 H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = + 256 kJ mo l − 1 (3) C 2 H 5 OH + 2 H 2 → 2 C H 4 + H 2 O , Δ H 298 0 = − 157 kJ mo l − 1 From the thermodynamics, higher temperature favored to form CO while lower temperature favored to CH4 [20]. The equilibrium yield rate of H2 ( Y H 2 ) could be possibly affected by 3 major parameters, equilibrium temperature (T), total pressure (P), and initial molal ratio of H2O/ethanol (R). Y H 2 increased with the increasing of T and R, while decreased with the increasing of P. For example, when P =1bar and R =3, Y H 2 could reach the maximum at 700°C. But sometime suitable increase in pressure was necessary, the work pressure needed to be 8–15bar for Pd–Ag membrane reactor. Another 5 reactions also happened in ethanol steam reforming process: (4) C 2 H 5 OH → C H 3 CHO + H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = + 68 kJ mo l − 1 (5) C 2 H 5 OH → C 2 H 4 + H 2 O , Δ H 298 0 = + 45 kJ mo l − 1 (6) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 4 H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = + 166 kJ mo l − 1 (7) C 2 H 5 OH → CO + C H 4 + H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = + 49 kJ mo l − 1 (8) CO + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = − 41 kJ mo l − 1 Many researches indicated that acetaldehyde and ethylene would be formed before the formation of H2 and CO X in reactions (1) and (2) under relative low temperature. The dehydrogenation and dehydration of ethanol were much faster than the steam reforming of ethanol. So, acetaldehyde and ethylene were thought as important intermediate products in the steam reforming reactions [20,22,28]. Then, the support of catalyst would be a key role. (i) It should favor H2O molecules break to OH groups, and accelerate these active particles to transfer to metal particles and form final products of CO X and H2 [29–31]; (ii) it could catalyze reactions (4) and (5), and affected selectivity of final product [18,20,23,32–34]; (iii) it could contribute to the stability of metal particles under high temperature [35–41]. Thermodynamics claimed when T >200°C, reaction (7) will be favored. At higher temperatures, the methane yield is reduced via the CH4 steam reforming reaction (6). But the high temperature will cause the sinter of catalysts and coke formation. There were a couple of contradictions. Reaction (8) could decrease CO and increase H2, it was favored at temperature range 200–400°C. So, we hope to combine the WGS reaction and the reforming reaction at an appropriate temperature to eliminate CO. In most of our works, the choice of supports was focused on the rare earth metal oxides for their high alkalinity and favor of dehydrogenation of alcohols. We, however, used nickel with supports (yttria, lanthanum oxide, ceria, zirconia, low-area alumina, etc.) [21,22,42,43] as catalysts for ethanol steam reforming reactions. In this work, Ni/Y2O3 was modified through heat treatment to eliminate CO and increase H2 selectivity, considering its good low temperature activity for ethanol steam reforming [21,22,42]."
1,Experimental,"The catalysts of nickel with yttria for ethanol steam reforming reaction were deposited from salt solutions [22]. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Rigaku X-ray diffraction equipment, using the Cu Kα radiation, at 40kV and 20mA. The heat treatment was carried out in a programmed oven from 450°C (sample T1) to 900°C (sample T10), the heat rate was 10°Cmin−1, and the sample was kept at the aim temperature for 4h after the aim temperature was reached. The precursor for all the samples was NiC2O4/Y2O3. For example, for sample T1, the precursor NiC2O4/Y2O3 was heated from room temperature to 450°C, heat rate 10°Cmin−1, when temperature reached 450°C the sample was kept at 450°C for 4h, then cooled down to room temperature naturally, then sample T1 was formed. Before the steam reforming test, catalyst was deoxidized in H2 at 450°C for 2h and then cool down to room temperature. Steam reforming test was carried out on a self-built system. Ethanol–water mixtures were injected into a tube through an electronically controlled sprayer-slide that sprayed small droplets onto the walls of the tube, heated to 200°C. This produced rapid vaporization, so that reactants went from liquids at room temperature to products exiting the catalyst in less than 46ms. Products were analyzed by a gas chromatography Angilent 7890A with 2 TCDs, with mass balances closing to within 0.1%. All experiments were run for up to 60h on a given catalyst, and most experiments were repeated on several catalysts. No significant deactivation or variations between catalysts were noted in these experiments. Kinetic analysis was conducted with a fixed-bed reactor with inner diameter of 6mm fitted in a programmable oven, with an operating range up to 700°C and linked to a gas chromatograph (GC-14C) via a six-way valve. Ethanol in a saturator at 0°C was introduced via a continuous flow of nitrogen. The GC was equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) coupled to a PC. A packed column (Porapak, 80–100 mesh, 1.5m long) was used for the separation of organic compounds (such as C2H5OH, H2O and CH3CHO) at 100°C with H2 as carrier gas. The gas, containing ethanol, was allowed to flow over the catalyst for 10min at room temperature before samples were injected into the GC via the six-way valve. Several runs were done in order to obtain a consistent result for ethanol peak area. Several runs were then performed with varying flow rates and reaction temperatures. For Arrhenius plots, ethanol conversion was kept at <20%. Water, ethanol and acetaldehyde were the only observed products below 150°C. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) test was carried out on a Quantachrom Instruments Autosorb-1. An OmniStar™ Qms-2000 mass spectrometer coupled to a PC with software for acquisition of mass peak data was used to analyze the effluent. Prior to adsorption, the catalyst sample was dried at 100°C for 1h then cooled down to room temperature and then was put into the sample cell of a sorption instrument to adsorb ethanol for 1h at room temperature. Then the sample was taken out from the sample cell of sorption instrument and put in the capillary of the Autosorb-1 to carry out TPD test. The vacuum was up to10−6 Torr, the catalyst temperature was raised from 50 to 650°C at a rate of 15°Cmin−1. The mass spectrometer used in this study was limited to monitor 50masses/cycles. To identify a product from mass spectral data, knowledge of the fragmentation pattern is required. Such patterns can be easily obtained by scanning the mass range of interest while leaking the desired gas into the vacuum system. However, lists of fragmentation patterns for numerous compounds are readily available. The relative yields of the desorption products were determined following the techniques used by other researchers [6–8]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,XRD and heat treatments,"3.1 XRD and heat treatments Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of catalysts Ni/Y2O3 samples with different heat-treated temperatures from 350 to 800°C at scan rate of 8°min−1. The strength of peaks increased with the increase of heat-treated temperature, and the diffraction peaks of NiO transfer to high degree direction regularly. The diffraction peaks of Y2O3 also transfer to high degree. The peaks labeled with the symbol “*”are corresponding to the diffraction of NiO. There are no new peaks appearing in the XRD patterns of Ni/Y2O3, means that the catalysts were just the mixture of nickel and its supports and no new phase was formed. From the diffraction peaks of NiO (220), as shown in Fig. 2 , at low scan rate of 1°min−1 from 60–65°, the diffraction peaks of Y2O3 (822), as shown in Fig. 3 , at low scan rate of 1°min−1 from 77–82°, the crystal grain sizes of NiO, Y2O3 in sample T4–T9, calculated with Scherrer formula were shown in Fig. 4 . The grain sizes of NiO increased with heat-treated temperature, and the increasing rate was much larger when the temperature was above 650°C. The grain sizes of Y2O3 did not change obviously below 750°C because finished product of Y2O3 was used as support precursor which has a melting point much higher than 2000°C. So, the Tamman temperature of Ni/Y2O3 catalyst should be closed to 650°C. If the heat-treated temperature is above 650°C, the grain sizes of catalyst Ni/Y2O3 would increase quickly, and the micropores of the catalysts would be sintered or semi-melted, which leads to the decrease of the activity of catalysts directly."
4,Catalysts activity and selectivity,"3.2 Catalysts activity and selectivity We defined ethanol conversion (C E) and product selectivity (S P) as: (9) S P = mo l p mo l sp × 100 % (10) C EtOH = C in − C out C in × 100 % Because the H atoms from H2O can also be converted into H2, Y H 2 was defined as the fraction of H in the ethanol and water molecules converted into H2. So, complete conversion of the ethanol and water from the steam reforming reaction (1) could generate 6 H2 per C2H5OH, which gives a maximum H2 yield of 100%. Three H2 molecules from C2H5OH represent 50% Y H 2 only. Typical results of ethanol reforming on Ni–yttria are shown in Fig. 5 , in which the selectivity of each product and the conversion of ethanol are shown as a function of reaction temperature in the low-temperature range of 250–350°C. These experiments were done at a total flow rate of 6.8standardlmin−1 [gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) ∼7.8×104 h−1], with preheating to 200°C. Fig. 5 shows that at a temperature of 250°C, steam reforming of ethanol occurred obviously over the catalyst Ni/Y2O3, the ethanol conversion reached 81.9%, and the selectivity of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide was 43.1%, 20.9%, 9.7% and 26.3%, respectively. A small amount of acetaldehyde was also detected with a selectivity of 0.7%. When the temperature increased from 250 to 320°C, the conversion of ethanol increased to 95.3%, the selectivity of hydrogen increased to the maximal value 53.6%, indicating that the water-gas shift reaction of carbon monoxide has occurred. In the temperature range of 320–350°C, the selectivity of acetaldehyde reached 0.2%, the selectivity of hydrogen decreased to 48.9%, while the selectivity of methane and carbon dioxide increased to 25.8% and 19.7%. The conversion of ethanol has reached to 95.3% at 320°C. This high result means very good activity of the Ni/Y2O3 catalyst, which is much better than Ni/Al2O3 in this temperature domain [21]. The stability of catalysts Ni/Y2O3 with time-on-stream was examined for 60h at a temperature of 320°C. The relationships of selectivity of each product and conversion of ethanol with time-on-stream were shown in Fig. 6 . For catalyst Ni/Y2O3, under the experimental conditions, the conversion of ethanol was about 93%. The selectivity of hydrogen obviously increased during the first 15h from 45.3% to 53.2% and kept stable during the 15–50h, then decreased lightly during the last 10h. The activity, product selectivities and stability with time-on-stream of modified catalyst Ni/Y2O3 sample T2, T3 and T5 were shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 . The low temperature activity and CO elimination ability of Ni/Y2O3 catalyst were improved more through sample T2. The selectivity of hydrogen still kept 64.9vol.% after 79h reforming test. But the H2 selectivity and stability at low temperature of sample T3 and T5 was much lower than T2. At 350°C, the highest H2 selectivity of sample T3 and T5 was 54.1 and 50.7vol.%, respectively, while the mean value of H2 selectivity of sample T2 was about 64.4vol.% during the 79h test. The highest H2 selectivity of sample T3 and T5 at 500°C was 63.1 and 55.0vol.%, respectively, which was still lower than the mean value of H2 selectivity (64.4vol.%) of sample T2 at 350°C. So, the test results showed obviously that sample T2 treated at 500°C with NiO grain size of 13.3nm and Y2O3 of 76nm is the best for ethanol reforming. The results of sample T2 for ethanol reforming were also better than Ni/La2O3 in same temperature domain [21] and some rare metal supported catalysts [16]. Through controlling of reforming temperature range to match the WGS reaction temperature range, the CO selectivity was decreased evidently, as shown in Table 1. The catalyst was very stable during a 79h steam reforming test at 350°C, with high H2 selectivity, 68.7vol.% and high Y H 2 (67.6%, consider of total H atoms in C2H5OH and H2O molecules, 119.8%, consider of H atoms in C2H5OH molecules only). And in the first 49h, no CO detected. The results indicated that heat treatment at 500°C had active effects on catalyst. In the process of heat treatment on catalyst Ni/Y2O3, the grain sizes changed, the pore structure of the catalysts was reconstructed, which led to the change of surface area finally. Heat stability of aperture structure of the support follows: micropore of 0–10nm stable below 500°C, transition pore of 10–200nm stable between 500 and 800°C. So, micropore and transition pore of sample T2 (heat treated at 500°C) could be kept. However, micropore of sample T3 (heat treated at 550°C) and T5 (heat treated at 650°C) had been sintered. The heat-treatment temperature was higher, the sintering was more seriously. So, the H2 selectivity and stability of the catalysts followed the order: T2 >unmodified Ni/Y2O3 >T3 >T5. Why sample T2 had the best characteristic? Catalytic reaction under constant pressure needs pores structure with double pore sizes distributing: aperture of micropore is between λ and λ/10, aperture of macropore ≥10λ. Here, λ is molecular mean free path, (11) λ = k T 2 π σ 2 P T, temperature; k, Boltzmann constant (1.3806×10−23 JK−1); σ, effective diameter of molecule; and P, pressure. In the reaction system of ethanol reforming: σCO2 =0.3941nm, σCO=0.3690nm, σCH4 =0.3758nm, σC2H5OH=0.4530nm, σH2 =0.2827nm, σO2 =0.3467nm, in which σCO2 is the largest in products while σC2H5OH is largest in reactants. So, molecular CO2 and C2H5OH could be only considered in ethanol reforming system to calculate the λ. The mean free path (λ) of molecular CO2 and C2H5OH were calculated and shown in Table 4 . The results showed that at 350°C, the λ of ethanol is 93.2nm, the λ of CO2 is 123.0nm, so catalysts’ aperture size range of 12.3–93.2nm were needed. T2 sample with NiO grain size of 13.3nm and Y2O3 of 76nm was easy to form the pore at this range. And, at 350°C, the WGS reaction can happen easily, so T2 sample combined the WGS and reforming reaction very well, realizing no CO and high H2 selectivity at last. At 500°C of reforming reaction, the λ of ethanol is115.6nm, the λ of CO2 is 152.7nm, all of them are larger than at 350°C, so the diffuse coefficient will turn large, the whole velocity of reaction will be higher, the conversion of ethanol will be increased. However, when the heat-treated temperature is higher than 500°C, the micropore of support will be sintered, only transition pore and macropore will be left, which leads to the decrease of catalyst selectivity. From crystal grain sizes change, Tamman temperature of NiO is much lower than Y2O3, which claimed that during the reforming process Y2O3 was more stable than Ni(O). That was why the conversion of ethanol increased with the temperature, increasing obviously, but the selectivity of H2 was not in high temperature steam reforming, which also proved that Ni(O) which favored for the break of bond C–C and C–H had been unstable at high temperature but Y2O3 which can promote O–H break were still stable."
5,Steady state reaction,"3.3 Steady state reaction Fig. 7 shows the effect of changing the flow rate on ethanol conversion over Ni/Y2O3 (a) and modified Ni/Y2O3 catalysts sample T2 (b) in the absence of water vapor at 130°C, as illustrated by the equation: (12) ln 1 1 − x = k w F , where x is the degree of ethanol conversion (C EtOH), w is the catalyst weight (150mg), and F the flow rate (mlmin−1). For the catalysts a linear relationship can be observed between the degree of ethanol conversion and contact time, indicating a first-order reaction with respect to ethanol. The slope of each line denotes the rate constant k, which is found to be 2.95 (a), 4.27 (b) mlg−1 s−1 in the absence of water vapor, respectively. By the equation (13) ln k 2 k 1 = E a R 1 T 1 − 1 T 2 , where k is the rate constant (mlg−1 s−1), R the gas constant (JK−1 mol−1) and T the reaction temperature (K), the apparent activation energy of reaction E a, can be computed, to be 7.04kJmol−1 (a) and 5.91kJmol−1 (b). This order is consistent with the order of constant k, which can also explain why sample T2 had better activity in reforming reaction. Thus, from the above results one can write the rate of reaction for ethanol over Ni/Y2O3 as (14) r = k [ ethanol ] [ H 2 O ] n where n needs to be determined. For all runs ethanol conversion was kept below 20% to assure operation in differential reactor conditions."
6,TPD test,"3.4 TPD test Fig. 8 presented t desorption profiles over T2 sample Ni/Y2O3 catalyst, and showed the existence of three distinct temperature domains. Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO, m/e =29, 44, and 43) desorbed at three temperature domains of 120, 310, 650°C with shoulder at 430°C. Ethanol (C2H5OH, m/e =31, 45, 29) desorbed in 120°C, 650°C. Methane (CH4, m/e =16, 15, 14) desorbed at 120, 320, 650°C, carbon dioxide (CO2, m/e =44, 28) desorbed at same temperature domains with methane carbon monoxide (CO, m/e =28, 14) desorbed at 120 and 650°C. So, the initial mechanism of desorption of ethanol over modified catalyst Ni/Y2O3 could be ratiocinated and written as [6–8]: C H 3 C H 2 OH ⟶ − H C H 3 C H 2 O ( a ) T p = 120 , 310 , 650 ° C C H 3 C H 2 O ⟶ − H C H 3 CH O ( a ) T p = 120 , 310, 650 ° C C H 3 CH O ( a ) → C H 4 + C O ( a ) T p = 120 , 320, 650 ° C C O ( a ) ⟶ + H 2 O C O 2 + H 2 T p = 120 , 320, 650 ° C The subscript (a) in the equation means active particles."
7,Conclusions,"Modification of heat treatment at 500°C had a novel activation on catalyst Ni/Y2O3 to catalyze ethanol steam reforming with high H2 yield 67.6% and no CO selectivity at 350°C. Heat treatment had obvious effects on the grain size of active metal Ni(O) and aperture structure of catalyst Ni/Y2O3. The effects of sizes and aperture structure are important factors influencing the characteristics of catalysts. The low temperature (350°C) activity, H2 selectivity, CO elimination ability and stability of the catalysts followed the order: T2 >unmodified Ni/Y2O3 >T3 >T5. The catalysts of Ni/Y2O3 are good choices to be used in ethanol steam reforming processors for fuel cell applications. These simple experiments also demonstrate that ethanol can be converted into H2 simply and with high efficiency. Fast and efficient renewable fuel reforming is one of the critical steps in producing H2 for fuel cells and the “hydrogen economy”, and ethanol is now the most available and economical renewable fuel. This process just realizes the ideal of “Energy from nature, make the usage of energy more concordant with nature”."
