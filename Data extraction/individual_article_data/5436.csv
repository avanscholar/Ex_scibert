0,Introduction,"Finite supply of fossil fuel cannot meet the rapidly increasing energy demand of the future. To search for a potential solution to replace fossil fuels, biological production of fuels is one of the most promising approaches. The conventional raw material for bio-based production is sugar and starch, from which ethanol and various other fuels and chemicals can be synthesized. Among the non-ethanol products, of particular interest are compounds that can serve as both fuel and chemical feedstock and are compatible with current infrastructure. n-Butanol, isobutanol, and other higher alcohols are some examples. n-Butanol and isobutanol are regarded as potential surrogates for gasoline. These compounds have a energy density (27MJ/L) close to that of gasoline (32MJ/L) and lower hygroscopicity compared to ethanol. n-Butanol is naturally produced by selected species of Clostridia (Jang et al., 2012; Tracy et al., 2012). Indeed, n-butanol production from sugar using Clostridia has been commercialized almost a century ago. After a long quiescent period, the interest in bio-production of n-butanol and related compounds has re-emerged in recent years. Initially, sugar is still the most common raw material, and efforts have focused on developing more efficient pathways for synthesizing these specific products from glucose. As the bioproduction technology matures, alternative resources such as lignocellulose, macroalgae biomass, waste proteins, syngas, and CO2, have been explored as renewable raw material to produce these compounds. To utilize these non-conventional resources for fuel production, the production organism must first convert the raw materials to central metabolites such as pyruvate and acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA), which are then diverted to fuel synthesis through engineered pathways. Thus, strain engineering efforts must address problems in both resource utilization and fuel synthesis. To do so, one can construct the resource utilization pathways into an organism that already produces the desired product, or construct the biofuel production pathways into a host organism capable of metabolizing the desired resource. The choice of the strategies depends on the complexity of the two types of pathways and difficulties in expressing the proteins involved. The lack of well-developed genetic tools and complex physiology in non-traditional host organisms often limit the speed of strain development. Nevertheless, both approaches have demonstrated successful production of biofuel from non-conventional feedstock, lignocellulosic materials, syngas, waste protein, macroalgae biomass, and CO2. In this review, we summarize the current state of bioproduction of n-butanol, isobutanol and other higher alcohols, with particular interest in the pathway design for higher alcohol production and strain development for utilization of alternative resources for biofuel production."
1,Pathways for carbon and energy intake,"To tap into various raw materials, it is important to understand how microorganisms utilize them. Different microorganisms have different requirements to obtain carbon and energy, thus defining their primary nutritional group. Typically, organisms can be classified as autotrophs or heterotrophs. Autotrophs are organisms capable of growth and producing organic compounds from carbon dioxide, whereas heterotrophs require organic carbon as their carbon source as well as energy sources. Resources for heterotrophs include sugar, glycerol, soluble and insoluble polysaccharides, alginates, proteins, and other organic carbons. These organic compounds serve as both carbon and energy source for the heterotrophs, which partially oxidize these organic compounds and to various metabolites and generate reducing equivalents (NAD(P)H) and energy (ATP) in the process. Alternatively, the organic compounds can be completely oxidized to CO2 for generation of even larger amounts of energy (e.g. via TCA cycle and respiration) and reducing equivalents. A comprehensive diagram connecting various pathways is shown in Fig. 1 as a reference to demonstrate the interconnection between different pathways and metabolites. This diagram shows how external resources (CO2, syngas, proteins, cellulose, hemicellulose, and alginates) are converted to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, which are then used for biofuel synthesis. Details of these resource utilization pathways can be found elsewhere (Caspi et al., 2012; Wargacki et al., 2012)."
2,Pathways for higher chain alcohol synthesis,"Biosynthetic pathways for producing higher alchols elongate and reduce central metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and pyruvate into more electron-rich compounds, higher carbon acyl-CoA and 2-keto acids. These reduced metabolites are then further reduced into higher alcohols and secreted from the microorganism into the solution."
3,Isobutanol and other 2-keto acid-based higher alcohols,"3.1 Isobutanol and other 2-keto acid-based higher alcohols 2-Keto acids are common intermediates for amino acid biosynthesis as they are the immediate precursors of amino acids. In particular, the precursor 2-keto acids of the aliphatic amino acids such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine can be diverted to synthesize higher alcohols (Fig. 2 ). The synthetic pathway for isobutanol production (Fig. 2 following steps E1–E2–E3–E4–E5) diverts the carbon fluxes from valine biosynthetic pathway into synthesis of isobutanol (Atsumi et al., 2008b) by overexpression of 2-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (KivD) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhA). With further overexpression of valine biosynthetic pathway, Escherichia coli was engineered to produce 22g/L of isobutanol, a value exceeding the n-butanol produced by most of its native producers, and comparable to the best result (Qureshi and Blaschek, 2001). Further optimization of isobutanol production in lab scale fermentors with in situ product removal was able to increase the effective production titer of isobutanol to 50g/L (Baez et al., 2011). Using valine analog norvaline, a mutant strain of E. coli was selected for improved isobutanol productivity (Smith and Liao, 2011). Furthermore, to increase isobutanol yield under anaerobic condition, typically NADPH-dependent ketol-acid reductoisomerase (IlvC), second step of the pathway, was engineered to utilize NADH and enabled production of isobutanol at 100% theoretical yield anaerobically (Bastian et al., 2011). Table 1 summarizes the strain development for the heterologous production of isobutanol and n-butanol using diverse resources. Isobutanol production has also been implemented in other heterotrophs (Table 1) such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.14–0.18g/L; (Chen et al., 2011; Kondo et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012)), Corynebacterium glutamicum (4.9–12.6g/L; (Blombach et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2010)), and Bascillus subtilis (2.62g/L; (Li et al., 2011)) using glucose as the substrate. In addition to isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol (Cann and Liao, 2008) and 3-methyl-1-butanol (Connor and Liao, 2008) are also produced from naturally occurring 2-keto acids, 2-Keto-3-methylvalerate and 2-keto-4-methylvalerate, respectively. Synthesis of alcohols longer than 2-methyl-butanol and 3-methyl-buanol requires longer 2-keto acid precursors (Fig. 3 ; for review on carbon chain elongation see (Felnagle et al., 2012; Shen and Liao, 2011)). To do so, 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS; LeuA), which is the key enzyme responsible for carbon elongation of 2-keto acid with acetyl-CoA, and KivD were engineered to accept larger substrates (Marcheschi et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2008). As a result, longer chain alcohol such as heptanol and octanol were produced. Fig. 3 illustrates the diversity of aliphatic higher alcohols that are produced via 2-keto acid-based pathways. The 2-keto acid based pathway can also produce n-butanol by decarboxylating and reducing 2-ketovalerate, which is a precursor to an unnatural amino acid norvaline. 2-Ketovalerate is naturally produced by IPMS chain elongation (Fig. 2 following steps C1–C2–C3–C4) of 2-ketobutyrate. 2-Ketobutyrate, on the other hand, can be synthesized via two mechanisms. The first mechanism is by deamination of threonine (threonine pathway; Fig. 2 following steps A1–A2–A3–A4–A5–A6–A7) and the other mechanism (citramalate pathway; Fig. 2 following steps B2–B3–B4–B5), found in Methanococcus jannaschii, extend pyruvate to 2-ketobutyrate by IPMS chain elongation. Both the threonine and citramalate pathway were used to produce 0.5–1g/L of n-butanol in E. coli using glucose (Atsumi and Liao, 2008; Shen and Liao, 2008)."
4,n-Butanol and the Coenzyme A-dependent pathway,"3.2 n-Butanol and the Coenzyme A-dependent pathway The natural n-butanol biosynthetic pathway from Clostridia is mediated by Coenzyme A (CoA). As illustrated in Fig. 2, Clostridium pathway (Fig. 2 following steps D2b–D3a–D4a–D5a–D6–D7) proceeds first by condensation of two acetyl-CoA, followed by reduction and dehydration into n-butanol. As an alternative to using Clostridia for n-butanol production, the Clostridium n-butanol production pathway was transferred to other heterotrophs (Table 1). These heterotrophs including E. coli (Atsumi et al., 2008a; Inui et al., 2008), S. cerevisiae (Steen et al., 2008), Lactobacillus brevis (Berezina et al., 2010), Pseudomonas putida (Nielsen et al., 2009) and B. subtilis (Nielsen et al., 2009) were able to produce n-butanol from sugars or glycerol. However, the n-butanol titers produced from these recombinant heterotrophs are much lower than that of the native Clostridium producers by one to two orders of magnitude. One hypothesis that explain this deficiency was that butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase electron transferring flavoprotein (Bcd/Etf) complex (Fig. 2; step D5a) was poorly expressed in recombinant organisms due to its potential oxygen sensitivity and requirement of ferredoxin as an additional redox partner (Li et al., 2008). The difficulty of functionally expressing Bcd/Etf complex was overcome by recruiting trans-2-enyol-CoA reductase (Ter) for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA (Bond-Watts et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2011). Ter is readily expressed in E. coli and directly reduces crotonyl-CoA using NADH without requirement of additional ferredoxin partners. This strategy efficiently avoids expression of foreign ferredoxins and couples the production of n-butanol to the consumption of glucose as glycolysis generates NADH. Further characterization reveals that reduction of crotonyl-CoA with NADH is an irreversible reaction as opposed to the potentially reversible reaction catalyzed by the FAD mediated Bcd/Etf complex (Bond-Watts et al., 2011). This strategy effectively increased productivity of n-butanol in E. coli to 800–1600mg/L/d, exceeding the productivity (150mg/L/d) of the pathway utilizing Bcd/Etf. While the use of Ter in the CoA-dependent pathway in E. coli outperformed the original Clostridium pathway, the production titer remains inferior to the native n-butanol producers. To increase the productivity of n-butanol in heterologous hosts, additional host engineering was required. The successful productions of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol (Hanai et al., 2007; Soma et al., 2012), and isobutanol (Atsumi et al., 2008b; Baez et al., 2011) have decarboxylation towards the end of the pathway as a common feature. Decarboxylation effectively drives the reaction equilibrium towards the product as gaseous CO2 leaves the solution. The lack of a natural driving force possibly explains the low production of n-butanol in E. coli. Therefore, to engineer driving forces for n-butanol production, synthetic accumulation of the precursor acetyl-CoA and cofactor NADH was achieved by knocking out mixed acid fermentation (Δldh, ΔadhE, and Δfrd) and acetate formation (Δpta) (Shen et al., 2011). Furthermore, formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) was overexpressed to convert formate, product of anaerobic synthesis of acetyl-CoA, into NADH. Together, the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and NADH drives the reaction towards product formation, enabling production up to 15g/L in titer of fed batch fermentation under anaerobic condition (Shen et al., 2011). This engineered strain of E. coli produced n-butanol to a titer comparable to that demonstrated by Clostridium producers. To further strengthen the driving force of n-butanol production and minimize product toxicity, this engineered strain was tested for a scale up experiment using 1L chemostat with continuous product removal by gas stripping. The effective titer reached 30g/L in 7days with a yield of 70% maximum theoretical (Shen et al., 2011). This work demonstrates the importance of driving forces in metabolite production. Utilizing the acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation driving force constructed in E. coli, the CoA-dependent pathway was constructed to increase carbon chain length of butyryl-CoA by condensation with another acetyl-CoA (Dekishima et al., 2011). This condensation is catalyzed by 3-keto-thiolase (BktB) from Ralstonia eutropha. Upon expression of BktB with the CoA-dependent pathway for n-butanol synthesis, n-hexanol production was observed, demonstrating the feasibility of higher chain alcohol production by extension of the CoA-dependent pathway. By designing a selection platform (Machado et al., 2012) to enhance higher alcohol production using the CoA-dependent pathway, 469mg/L of n-hexanol and 65mg/L of n-octanol was produced from E. coli."
5,Higher alcohols via reversed β-oxidation pathway,"3.3 Higher alcohols via reversed β-oxidation pathway The CoA-dependent pathway resembles the sequence of reactions in β-oxidation in reverse (Fig. 4 ). This reversed β-oxidation is naturally used by Clostridium kluyveri to produce hexanoic acid from ethanol. However, the enzymes responsible for the recursive chain elongation are not clearly defined. Reversed β-oxidation (Fig. 4) using native enzymes was investigated in E. coli (Dellomonaco et al., 2011). To operate the native β-oxidation in reverse, the fad and ato regulons, encoding the β-oxidation enzymes, must be active without requiring the presence of their natural fatty acid inducers. This phenotype was achieved by creating mutations in transcriptional regulators fadR, atoC, crp and knock out of arcA. Upon further knock out of its fermentation pathways (ΔadhE, ΔfrdA, Δpta) (Dellomonaco et al., 2011) and overexpression of native thiolase (YqeF) and alcohol dehydrogenase (FucO), production of n-butanol at 1.9g/L was achieved. Further scale up of n-butanol production in lab scale fermentor resulted in a titer of 14g/L (Dellomonaco et al., 2011). Instead of using acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (FadE) of the native β-oxidation pathway, this reversed β-oxidation sequence requires an uncharacterized enzyme YdiO, a predicted acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and its associated proteins YdiQRST for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. YdiQRS are putative flavoproteins, and YdiT is a ferredoxin-like protein, suggesting that the reduction of crotonyl-CoA may be associated with ferredoxin similar to that of the Clostridium Bcd/Etf complex. Further overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase favoring long chain acyl-CoA reduction resulted in the production of long chain alcohols such as octanol (100mg/L) and decanol (170mg/L), within the same order of magnitude of fatty alcohol (598.6mg/L) produced via fatty acid synthesis (Zheng et al., 2012). Another study utilizing reversed β-oxidation for n-butanol production in E. coli resulted in minimal titer of 1mg/L n-butanol produced (Gulevich et al., 2012). In this study, FadE was used for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA instead of YdiO, and native bifunctional aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) was used instead of FucO. Furthermore, mixed acid fermentation pathways were not deleted."
6,Butanol production from diverse resources,"As the designs for efficient higher alcohol production pathways mature, alternative resources such as lignocellulose, waste proteins, syngas, and CO2, have been assessed as renewable raw material to produce these compounds. In this section, we review the current status of strain engineering for utilization of alternative resources for the production of higher alcohols."
7,Photosynthesis-based isobutanol production from CO2,"4.1 Photosynthesis-based isobutanol production from CO2 Production of biofuel directly from CO2 using autotrophs is attractive because it bypasses the difficulty of feedstock recalcitrance. To meet this goal, recombinant cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 has been engineered to synthesize isobutanol (Atsumi et al., 2009) by using the valine biosynthetic pathway coupled with KivD and an alcohol dehydrogenase YqhD. The B. subtilis acetolactate synthase (AlsS) and E. coli valine biosynthetic enzymes IlvC and IlvD were overexpressed in S. elongatus PCC 7942 to direct carbon flux towards isobutanol production. This engineered strain of S. elongatus produced 450mg/L of isobutanol in 6days, representing a productivity of higher than 3000μg/L/h (Atsumi et al., 2009), exceeding current the productivity of hydrogen and ethanol from cyanobacteria and comparable to that of algal diesel productivity (Sheehan, 2009). It was also demonstrated in the same study that overexpression of RuBisCo was able to increase the isobutyraldehyde, intermediate one step before isobutanol, production up to two fold reaching a final titer of 1.1g/L of isobutyraldehyde produced at a productivity of 6230μg/L/h, demonstrating improvement of photosynthetic rate. Numerous efforts have also been made to construct recombinant cyanobacteria for the production of other fuel and chemical targets (Machado and Atsumi, 2012)."
8,Photosynthesis-based n-butanol production from CO2,"4.2 Photosynthesis-based n-butanol production from CO2 n-Butanol production in cyanobacteria using the CoA-dependent pathway is a more challenging task as this pathway comes from strict anaerobes. To produce n-butanol in cyanobacteria, the modified CoA-dependent pathway consisting of AtoB (thiolase), Hbd (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), Crt (crotonase), Ter, and AdhE2 (aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase) was recombined into S. elongatus PCC 7942 (Lan and Liao, 2011). The activities of these enzymes were verified by in vitro assay using crude extract. However, even with functional expression of all enzymes in the pathway, n-butanol production was barely detected (Lan and Liao, 2011). Only upon anoxic incubation of grown culture, 14.5mg/L of n-butanol was observed in culture broth after 7days. To overcome the challenge of producing n-butanol in cyanobacteria under photosynthetic condition, additional driving force is needed. Thiolase mediated synthesis of acetoacetyl-CoA is thermodynamically unfavorable with a calculated ΔG′ of 27.4kJ/mol (calculated using eQuilibrator (Flamholz et al., 2012) with substrate concentrations of 1mM, pH 7, and ionic strength of 0.1M). To overcome this large energy barrier, acetyl-CoA concentration must be much greater than the concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA. This issue was overcome in E. coli (Shen et al., 2011) by constructing the accumulation of intracellular acetyl-CoA and NADH. Accumulation of NADH drives the downstream reactions to synthesis of n-butanol, therefore lowering the concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA. The net effect of this engineering is the increased concentration ratio of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, which effectively drives the synthesis of n-butanol. However, this scenario is difficult to recreate in cyanobacteria because accumulation of acetyl-CoA and NADH is challenging. To circumvent the difficulty of accumulating acetyl-CoA and NADH as a driving force for n-butanol synthesis, energy from ATP was used to drive the thermodynamically unfavorable condensation of two acetyl-CoA (Lan and Liao, 2012). Acetyl-CoA is activated by ATP and bicarbonate to form malonyl-CoA, which can undergo a decarboxylative condensation with acetyl-CoA to synthesize acetoacetyl-CoA. This ATP mediated condensation of two acetyl-CoA has an overall ΔG′ of −13.8 with −9.2kJ/mol from activation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by ATP and −4.6kJ/mol from decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA synthesis is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc), which is present in cyanobacteria. However, there is no native enzyme for condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Therefore, acetoacetyl-CoA synthase was expressed with the enzymes of the modified CoA-dependent pathway (Fig. 2 following steps D2a–D2a′–D3b–D4b–D5b–D6–D7). As a result, 30mg/L of n-butanol was produced under photosynthetic condition."
9,Electricity-based isobutanol production from CO2,"4.3 Electricity-based isobutanol production from CO2 Although photosynthetic CO2 fixation is a natural process, the energy conversion efficiency is limited by the natural photosynthetic apparatus (Zhu et al., 2008). In addition, biofuel production by photoautotrophs requires photobioreactors. The 2-dimensional light-exposing surface is much more costly than the 3-dimensional fermentors that are used to cultivate microbes in the bulk. As an alternative, the light reactions can be separated from the dark reactions (CO2 fixation and biofuel production). The light reactions can be realized by using man-made photovoltaic cells that are reasonably efficient in converting sunlight into electricity, which can then be used to drive CO2 fixation in the dark either directly (Nevin et al., 2011) or via an electron mediator (Li et al., 2012). Using such a strategy, CO2 can be reduced to fuels and chemicals without direct photosynthesis. This strategy also serves as an effective way to store electricity as liquid fuel (Hawkins et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012). In this case, electric energy is converted to chemical energy in the form of biofuel. The use of a diffusible electron mediator is scalable using conventional technologies. To do so, electrical energy first has to be converted into simple electron carrier such as H2. Chemoautotroph can then utilize the energy stored in H2 and fix CO2 and produce biofuel. However, H2 is not an ideal electron source for microbes because of its low solubility in H2O and safety concerns. Formate on the other hand is highly soluble in water and can be produced by electrolysis of CO2 and H2O (Kang et al., 2012). Furthermore, formate can also be metabolized by some microorganism to produce NADH and CO2 by formate dehydrogenase. To convert electricity into biofuel, R. eutropha, a chemoautotroph capable of CO2 fixation with formate as an energy source, has been engineered to produce isobutanol and 3-methylbutanol in an integrated process of electricity driven biofuel production (Li et al., 2012). Isobutanol production genes (alsS, ilvCD, kivD, and yqhD) were introduced into R. eutropha. The polyhydroxybutyrate, natural carbon storage of R. eutropha, biosynthesis pathway was knocked out to redirect the carbon flux to isobutanol. As a result, the isobutanol production pathway served as the new metabolic sink for carbon and reducing equivalent. In order to construct an integrated system with electricity as the energy input, bioreactor design was necessary to remove reactive oxygen species O2 − and NO, which were identified as by-products of formate electrolysis in that particular medium and inhibit cell growth. As a result, this integrated process was able to produce about 100mg/L of isobutanol and 50mg/L of 3-methylbutanol directly from electricity and CO2 (Li et al., 2012). By directly feeding formate, this engineered strain of R. eutropha produced 846mg/L of isobutanol and 570mg/L of 3-methylbutanol in 130h using pH-coupled formic acid feeding fermentor (Li et al., 2012)."
10,Syngas-based n-butanol production,"4.4 Syngas-based n-butanol production Syngas is a mixture of CO and H2 and is used as an energy source for CO2 fixation by acetogens such as Clostridium ljungdahlii (Kopke et al., 2010) and Clostridium carboxidivorans (Bruant et al., 2010). Syngas can be produced from renewable resources such as biomass and municipal waste (Goransson et al., 2011). Syngas production and utilization by microorganisms have been previously reviewed (Munasinghe and Khanal, 2010) and will not be discussed extensively here. C. carboxidivorans naturally produces n-butanol, ethanol, butyrate and acetate from syngas (Bruant et al., 2010). However, the major product produced by wild type C. carboxidivorans is acetate (56mmol per mol of CO consumed), and n-butanol is a minor product (8.9mmol per mol of CO consumed; (Bruant et al., 2010)). On the other hand, C. ljungdahlii, first isolated for its ability to produce ethanol from syngas (Tanner et al., 1993), does not naturally produce n-butanol. Upon engineering the CoA-dependent n-butanol synthesis pathway from C. acetobutylicum into C. ljungdahlii, the resulting strain produced about 0.5mM of n-butanol (Kopke et al., 2010) from syngas. However, it was observed that n-butanol was metabolized into butyrate."
11,Cellulose-based butanol production,"4.5 Cellulose-based butanol production Lignocellulose has long been considered to be an attractive source of biological feedstock (Higashide et al., 2011). It commonly exists in plants as cell wall and structural support. Lignocellulosic materials are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. In particular, cellulose and hemicellulose represent the majority of fermentable carbon composite in these materials (Sun and Cheng, 2002). Therefore, enzymes and microorganisms capable of degrading cellulose and hemicellulose are of particular interest for biofuel applications. However, the major problem of lignocellulose utilization is the deconstruction of this complex or recalcitrant material. The breakdown of lignocellulose and the strain development for production of chemical and fuel have been reviewed extensively (Adsul et al., 2011; Alvira et al., 2010; Chundawat et al., 2011) and are not covered here. More cost-efficient methods for the preparation (Survase et al., 2011) and the fermentation (Lu et al., 2012) of inexpensive cellulosic substrates have been developed to enhanced the efficiency of the overall process. Furthermore, recent Improvements in the fermentation process such as reduction of operation energy (Mariano et al., 2012) and reuse of wastewater (Chen et al., 2012) increase the overall efficiency of fermentative butanol production. To utilize cellulose and hemicellulose, cellulase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase were expressed in E. coli for utilization and degradation of cellulose and xylan, components of plant biomass (Bokinsky et al., 2011). In order for E. coli to excrete cellulose and xylanase, these enzymes were expressed as protein fusions with OsmY, a protein induced by hyperosmotic stress. The resulting strain cleaves cellulose and xylan into their shorter oligosaccharides cellodextrin and xylodextrins, respectively. To further hydrolyze these oligosaccharides, β-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase were overexpressed. As a result, engineered E. coli expressing cellulase (Cel) from Bacillus sp. D04 and β-glucosidase (cel3A) from Cellvibrio japonicus was able to grow on phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (Bokinsky et al., 2011). Engineered E. coli expressing xylanase (Xyn10B) and xylobiosidase (Gly43F) from Clostridium stercorarium was able to grow beechwood xylan, a model substrate for hemicellulose. Upon further expression of Clostridium CoA-dependent n-butanol synthetic operon, n-butanol (28mg/L) was produced from Ionic liquid treated switch grass (Bokinsky et al., 2011). In the same study, fatty acid ethyl ester and pinene were also produced. Alternatively, Clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic Clostridium with natural cellulose and hemicellulose utilization ability, was engineered to produce isobutanol from crystalline cellulose (Higashide et al., 2011). Isobutanol production pathway (Fig. 2; (Atsumi et al., 2008b)) was introduced into C. cellulolyticum via borad-host-range plasmid transformation. The resulting strain produced 364mg/L in 4days and 660mg/L in 7days of isobutanol from cellobiose and cellulose, respectively."
12,Protein-based higher alcohol production,"4.6 Protein-based higher alcohol production Protein from animal waste such as cattle and poultry litter and manure is often an overlooked resource for potential biofuel production. Amount of animal litter and manure are increasing as the world human population increases. Animal litter and manure are commonly used as fertilizer for crop land because of their richness in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. However, due to accumulation of phosphorus and potassium in crop land (Edwards and Daniel, 1992), there is a limit as to how much animal litter and manure can be used as fertilizer. Excess of animal litter and manure accumulates, and disposal becomes a challenge. Recycling these wastes into biofuel is an attractive solution to this environmental problem. Utilization of protein as a resource for biofuel production also increases the efficiency of biofuel production because it recycles reduced nitrogen (Huo et al., 2012). Reduced nitrogen is necessary for the successful development of biofuel as both plant-based and algae-based biofuel productions require reduced nitrogen as fertilizer. Industrially, ammonia is chemically produced via the Haber–Bosch process, an energy intensive process, representing a large energy debt for biofuel production. Furthermore, high-protein containing residuals are commonly used as animal feeds, resulting in increased production of N2O, a green house gas 300 times worse than CO2 (Crutzen et al., 2008). Therefore the incentive for protein-based biofuel production is potentially substantial. To utilize protein as the carbon source for biofuel production, an efficient microbe capable of metabolizing protein and its amino acid residues is required. To generate such microbe, an E. coli strain was engineered by directed evolution to more efficiently utilize amino acids (Huo et al., 2011). The resulting strain was able to grow on 13 individual amino acids, as opposed to only 4 amino acids utilized by the wild type, as the sole carbon source. This engineered strain produced 406mg/L of higher alcohols including isobutanol, 2-methyl butanol, and 3-methyl butanol from yeast extract. Furthermore, the cell’s ammonia assimilation pathways (gdhA and glnA) were knocked out and genes responsible for transamination (leuDH, avtA, ilvE, ilvA, and sdaB) were overexpressed. The net effect of this engineering is the evolution of NH3, which is excreted from the cell, providing a driving force for amino acid consumption. With further knockouts of quorum-sensing genes, the final engineered strain produced 4g/L of higher alcohols from amino acids, representing a yield of 55.7% maximum theoretical (Huo et al., 2011). Huo et al. also demonstrated that up to 3g/L of higher alcohol were produced from pretreated algal and bacterial biomass as feedstocks."
13,Systematic approach for strain development,"Strain development for the production of chemicals from engineered organisms can be organized into different levels (Fig. 5 ). The First level focuses on the expression of necessary enzymes. Recombinant protein expression techniques such as modification of gene copy number, codon optimization, and choice of proper strength for promoter and ribosomal bind site (RBS) are some important considerations for functional expression of heterologous pathway. Computational tools such as RBS calculator (Salis et al., 2009) are useful for designing and controlling expression strength. Next, pathway optimization is achieved by reducing pathway toxicity (Dueber et al., 2009), knocking out obvious competing pathways, enhancing substrate and cofactor availability (Shen et al., 2011). In Addition, to enhance the performance of heterologous pathways, a driving force is usually necessary. Driving force such as decarboxylation, product phase separation, and reaction irreversibility effectively favors the formation of the product. These rational design strategies require careful biochemical consideration and detailed knowledge for the specific pathway and organism in study, and would give sufficient results for proof of principle. Further optimization of pathway expression requires high-throughput technologies with systems analysis. The “omics” technology and in silico models are useful to identify non-obvious competing pathways and additional beneficial enzymes for overexpression. These systematic approaches have been reviewed previously (Feist et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) and will not be discussed in detail here. Genomic reconstruction models have been developed for many industrially relevant microorganisms such as butanol-producing Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 (Milne et al., 2011) and cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Yoshikawa et al., 2011). The systems level of optimization is a fast growing area of research and can offer opportunities that previous design strategies cannot."
14,Conclusion,"Enhanced utilization of non-food-based resources for biofuel production will to continue as a main focus of biofuel research. Utilization of resources including CO2, waste protein, lignocellulosic material, and syngas, addresses energy and environmental problems, and waste management. Except for lignocellulose, utilization of other resources has not been investigated extensively. The development of advanced biofuel production from these alternative resources is still a young field. While microbes designed to utilize such alternative resources for producing higher alcohols have shown success, further strain optimizations, especially at the systems level, are needed to improve yield and productivity."
