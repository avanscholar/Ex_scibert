0,Introduction,"The importance of urea in commerce is indicated by the fact that annual production is approaching 200million tons. The majority of urea is utilized as a fertilizer, but other uses include the manufacture of resins and in the production of products for use in dermatology. Urea has numerous other uses in biochemical and medical applications such as the denaturation of proteins. As a result of its wide ranging applications, the solution behavior of urea in both aqueous and nonaqueous solvents has been the subject of considerable practical importance. Accordingly, the results of numerous experimental and theoretical studies on such solutions have been reported [1–6]. Moreover, because it has very low toxicity and is environmentally safe, urea has been used as the basis for laboratory experiments in chemical education involving measurements of enthalpy of dissolution [7,8]. Urea has a dipole moment of 4.20D in water and 6.25D in a mixture containing 20wt% water/acetone [9]. As a result, one of the interesting aspects of urea is the fact that it forms molecular aggregates in solution [10–12]. The urea molecule has unshared pairs of electrons on both nitrogen atoms as well as on the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group. As a result, there are multiple possible sites by means of which urea can form hydrogen bonds to other urea molecules or to solvent molecules. Therefore, association of urea itself is possible with the greatest extent of association expected to occur in solvents that consist of larger, less polar molecules or in those that do not form strong hydrogen bonds. Although the solubility of urea and the properties of such solutions have been studied in some detail, there does not seem to have been a coherent analysis of solubility data that involved water and alcohols as mixed solvents. However, the necessary solubility data have been reported by Lee and Lahti [6]. In that report, the solubility data for urea in water, methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol alone and mixtures containing certain specific combinations of these solvents were reported. The data were correlated by means of an equation of the form (1) ln S = A + Bt where S is the solubility and A and B are constants, and t is the temperature (°C). However, thermodynamic quantities were not derived from the data [6]. Although other data dealing with solubility of urea in mixed solvents have been published, the data of Lee and Lahti provide a coherent body of information that is based on consistent experiments [6]. Because urea is soluble in alcohols and some of its uses involve solubility in mixed solvents, an analysis of the data has been conducted to determine useful thermodynamics information as well as to interpret the results to provide insight into the nature of the solutions and possible aggregation of urea."
1,Results and discussion,"The results of a rather complete study dealing with the solubility of urea in water, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and mixtures of these solvents have been reported by Lee and Lahti [6]. Such data provide a basis for the determination of thermodynamics of dissolution of urea in water, alcohols, and mixtures of these solvents [6]. The data were reported as grams of urea that dissolved in 100g of water or the mixed solvents over a range of temperatures in °C. Conversion of the data to solubility in terms of moles of urea per 100g of solvent for the saturated solutions was accomplished by making use of the molecular weight of urea. When the enthalpy change for a dissolution process is assumed to be constant over the temperature range studied, solubility data obey a relationship such that a graph of ln C vs.1/T is linear. In this case, C is the solubility and T is the temperature (K) with the slope of the line being −∆H/R. The data presented by Lee and Lahti [6] have been analyzed in this way to determine the value for ΔH of dissolution of urea in water, alcohols, and in mixed solvents comprised of these solvents, and Figs. 1–3 show the graphs obtained for the pure solvents and mixtures of the alcohols with water. Although not shown, the graphs depicting the ln(solubility) vs. 1/T for mixtures of the three 50:50 mixtures of alcohols yielded linear relationships that gave high correlation coefficients. With the ΔH of dissolution of urea in several solvents and solvent mixtures having been determined, those values can be utilized to determine other thermodynamic parameters. It is usually assumed that the concentration of a solute in solution can be represented as C and that the effective activity of the solid solute is unity so that the logarithm of the equilibrium constant, K, can be represented simply as ln C. Making use of the relationship between thermodynamic quantities and solubility, which is valid at constant temperature, yields (2) ∆ G = − RT ln K = ∆ H − T ∆ S in which K is replaced by C, the concentration of solute that has dissolved. By assuming that ∆H and ∆S are constant, the value ΔG can then be obtained at a specific temperature by making use of Eq. (2) and the value for ΔH obtained from the graph of ln C vs. 1/T. These analyses have been performed by analysis of the data of Lee and Lahti [6] to obtain the thermodynamic values shown in Table 1 . From Fig. 1, it can be seen that there is considerable uncertainty in some data points for solubility of urea in methanol. If all of the data points are fitted to a linear relationship, the resulting thermodynamic parameters are as shown in Table 1. Omitting some of the data points results in different values for ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG, but this issue will be addressed later. The decision to exclude three of the data points for methanol solubility was based on the fact that a very high value (26.91kJmol−1) is obtained for ∆H if all data are included. Clearly this value is not in line with either the values for water or the other alcohols. Moreover, when the ∆H values are compared for the alcohol mixtures, the values are very close to those expected when a value of 19.21kJmol−1 for the heat of dissolution in methanol is combined with the values obtained for the other alcohols. As discussed later, the values for the entropy of dissolution of urea in the mixed alcohols indicate that the value of 57.08Jmol−1 K−1 that results with the three points deleted is much more in line with the expected role of the solvents in solvating urea than is a value of 82.00Jmol−1 K−1 that would result from inclusion of all the data. Several conclusions can be drawn from the data shown in Table 1. The dissolution of urea in water, alcohols, and their mixtures is endothermic in all cases. However, as would be expected from the fact that the urea molecule is small and polar, dissolution is least endothermic when the solvent is water. Except for the cases of water and the perhaps erroneous ΔH value for methanol, there is little difference in the ΔH values when the mixed solvent contains 33.3, 50, or 66.7% water. It is also apparent that for those mixtures that contain water there is almost no variation in the value for ΔS, which has values ranging from 64.14Jmol−1 K−1 to 65.33Jmol−1 K−1. For mixtures of water and the alcohols, the dissolution process involves ΔG values that vary only from −1.16kJmol−1 to 0.53kJmol−1. In order for a solute molecule to be placed in a solvent, it is necessary for a cavity to exist. The generation of such a cavity requires energy, and various approaches have been taken to rationalize the energy required when the solvent is water [13]. Interestingly, the energy necessary to create a cavity of 3.2Å diameter is approximately 18kJmol−1 [13], which is approximately equal to the enthalpy of dissolution of urea in water. Owing to the limited number of alcohols utilized in the Lee and Lahti study [6], an exhaustive analysis of the data is not appropriate. However, in a very simplistic way, the ease of formation of a cavity in a liquid is related to the cohesion energy and that is reflected by the solubility parameter, δ [14,15]. This parameter is the square root of the cohesion energy of the liquid divided by the molar volume. The values for methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol are 14.5, 12.9, and 11.6cal1/2 mol−3/2. With the solute being urea in each case, the ease of cavity formation should be related to the free energy change for the dissolution process. Fig. 4 shows the relationship obtained. Although the relationship shown in Fig. 4 must be regarded as tentative, it nonetheless shows that a correlation exists between the free energy of dissolution and the ease of creating a cavity in the solvent for the systems studied. Interpretations of solvent effects on reaction rates, spectra, and other properties have constituted an active area of research for many years [16]. In efforts to provide quantitative measures of the effects, numerous numerical scales have been developed, but they need not be reviewed here. One of the scales that was developed by Reichardt makes use of spectral shifts caused by different solvents (solvatochromism) and values known as ET(30) are obtained [16,17]. Another index of solvent influence is the normalized ET N values in which water is assigned a value of 1.00 and tetramethylsilane is assigned a value of 0 [18]. The relative polarity index results in values of 1.00, 0.762, 0.654, and 0.546 for water, methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol, respectively. With solubility being determined by the free energy change for dissolution, it is interesting to see if a relationship exists between that thermodynamic parameter and the relative polarity index. Fig. 5 shows this relationship for the four solvents listed. It is readily apparent that a linear relationship exists between ∆G for dissolution and the relative polarity of the solvents. There may be other parameters that correlate with ∆G of dissolution, but the relative polarity of the solvent is sufficient in this case. The relatively constant thermodynamic quantities that are obtained for all five of the mixtures that contain water and an alcohol (see Table 1) presents an interesting situation. An explanation of this phenomenon lies in the fact that on a molar basis, a mixture that contains 66.7% water and 33.3% 2-propanol (v/v) has a mole ratio of 6.77:1 water:2-propanol. This value is obtained by considering the mole fractions of the components, which can be calculated from the v/v composition by making use of the densities of the solvents (at 25°C) and their molar masses. Therefore, there is a large excess of water, and water preferentially solvates the urea molecules. Carthy et al. [19] have discussed the difference in solvation of urea that occurs in mixtures that contain water and alcohols. The solute disrupts the structure of the solvent, but apparently the urea molecules are solvated preferentially by water, which is in large excess. This is true even for the mixture that contains 33.3% water and 66.7% 2-propanol for which the molar ratio is 1.67:1. The result would be that such a mixture would behave much like water in its effect on dissolved urea. With water molecules being polar and capable of hydrogen bonding to urea molecules, solvation is assured even when the water content is relatively low on a v/v basis but relatively high on the basis of mole fraction. Other studies in mixed solvents containing acetonitrile or ethanol in water have shown that a rather large fraction of water molecules (up to approximately one-fourth) can be replaced without a great change in the mole fraction of urea that dissolves [19]. When the thermodynamic data for solutions of urea in pure alcohols are considered, it is seen (after correcting the values for methanol) that there is very little variation in the values for ∆H, but the values for ∆S show a clear trend. The values for ∆S of dissolution decrease in the order methanol>ethanol>2-propanol for which the ∆ S values are 57.08, 48.78, and 37.10Jmol−1 K−1, respectively. This could be a manifestation of the fact that methanol is a more structured solvent than are the other alcohols and that solvation of urea results in a more dramatic alteration of that structure [3]. When measured by direct calorimetry, the enthalpy of dissociation of urea in water has been reported to be 15.39kJmol−1 [20]. These authors also cited other values that range from 15.28 to 15.49kJmol−1. However, those values were determined by direct calorimetry on relatively dilute solutions and at a specific temperature. The value of 16.91kJmol−1 represents dissolution over a wide range of temperatures with saturated solutions resulting in each case. Therefore, the value obtained in this work is quite reasonable in view of the greatly different experimental procedures. It is the values for ∆G and ∆S that provide additional information about the nature of the interaction between urea and the solvents. The picture that emerges in analyzing thermodynamic data for the dissolution of urea in water, alcohols, and mixtures of these solvents is that aggregation of urea may be an important factor in some cases. Formation of dimers or aggregates of polar molecules in solution depends greatly on the nature of the solvent. In inert, nonpolar solvents, aggregation is extensive as a result of the polar molecules interacting more strongly with themselves than with the solvent. If a polar solvent is employed, there is interaction between molecules of the solvent with themselves in addition to their interaction with the solute. Insight into the nature of these interactions with urea as the solute can be inferred from the data shown in Table 1. For example, the enthalpy of dissolution is lowest (least endothermic) when the solvent is water, but the entropy change is rather large. This most likely results from small, polar water molecules interacting well with urea molecules, which results in less aggregation of urea in water but significant disruption of clusters of water molecules. Although much is known regarding the nature of solutions of urea in aqueous solutions and mixed solvents, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. For example, theoretical studies have shown that urea may be as much as 20% associated in concentrated aqueous solutions [11]. This conclusion was based on the difference in hydrogen bond energies and the results of calculations that showed that urea is able to fit into the structure of hydrogen bonded water. It was concluded that hydrogen bonds between urea and water are weaker than those between water molecules so that bulk solvent molecules preferentially form hydrogen bonds between themselves rather than to urea. However, Chitra and Smith [10] concluded on the basis of molecular dynamics studies that there appear to be no long-lived structures and that hydrogen bonds between urea and water appear to be of similar strength to those between water molecules. From the results of density functional theory (DFT) studies, Lee et al. [21] concluded that, due to the hydrogen bonding between urea and water, dimers of urea would be unstable and would dissociate when the fraction of water is large. However, it was concluded that no large clusters of urea molecules are stable [22]. A DFT quantum mechanical study of urea dimers has also been reported [23]. Although the dimers exist, results of molecular dynamics calculations indicate that they dissociate very rapidly and the molecules become linked by formation of water bridges [23]. It has been proposed that planar urea molecules can be incorporated into the three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds between water molecules [2]. The endothermic nature when the solvent is an alcohol results from the increase in the size of the alcohol molecules that results in steric hindrance and decrease in the ability of the larger alcohol molecules to function as proton donors [2]. This conclusion is in accord with the values obtained in this work for the free energies of dissolution of urea in the alcohols. Idrissi et al. have shown that the volume of a urea molecule is approximately 56.5Å3, which corresponds to a spherical cavity of approximately 2.4Å [22]. However, the solvent shell can be assigned based on different dimensions between atoms in the respective molecules [22]. The work necessary to create such cavities is of similar magnitude to the ΔH values for dissolution of urea [13]. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4, the solubility parameter correlates well with the free energy of dissolution. This is not to say that the dissolution process is as simple as cavity formation in water, but nonetheless the simple model leads to a realistic value. In the three pure alcohols, the value for ΔS decreases in the order methanol>ethanol>2-propanol. Such a trend can be explained as being the result of the degree of aggregation of urea being in the reverse order, which would be expected on the basis of polarity and molecular size of the solvents. In comparison, the value for ΔH of dissolution of urea in water is somewhat lower, but the larger value for ΔS is a reflection of the degree of aggregation of urea being lower in water as a result of the stronger solvating tendency of water. When the values for ΔG of dissolution of urea in the four pure solvents are considered, the results are as expected on the basis of polarity and solvating ability of alcohols for polar solutes with water being the best solvent and 2-propanol being the worst. Although there is considerable disagreement regarding the nature of urea in solutions, it appears that the major differences result from the different methodologies used in the studies. In general, the thermodynamic data obtained in this work support the major conclusions regarding molecular association in solution and differences in hydrogen bonding."
2,Conclusions,"From existing data in the literature [6], the thermodynamic quantities associated with the dissolution of urea in water, alcohols, and their mixtures have been obtained. Although the values for ΔH and ΔS vary, the values for ΔG increase in order for the solvents water, methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol. Such a trend agrees with the increasing size and organic nature of the solvents, and the solubility of urea becomes less favorable in higher alcohols. The values for ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG are virtually identical for mixtures that contain either 33.3 or 66.7% water mixed with 66.7 or 33.3% of either ethanol or 2-propanol, apparently as a result of preferential solvation by water. Moreover, dissolution of urea in a solvent mixture that contains 50% water and 50% methanol (v/v) yields thermodynamic quantities that are virtually identical to those of the other mixed solvents that contain water. However, in solvent mixtures that contain methanol/ethanol, ethanol/2-propanol, or methanol/2-propanol with 50% (v/v) of each component, the values of ΔS decrease in the order of solvent mixtures listed, probably as a result of less favorable solvation by higher alcohols. The value for ΔH is approximately the same for the mixtures that contain methanol/ethanol and ethanol/2-propanol, but the value is higher than for the mixture containing methanol and 2-propanol. All of the trends in the values of thermodynamic quantities are explained in terms of the differences in degree of aggregation of urea in the solvent systems."
