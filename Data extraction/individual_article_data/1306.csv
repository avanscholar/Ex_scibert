0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid increase in population growth and industrial activities, Natural nonrenewable resources such as petroleum and fossil fuels as a major source of energy are nearly depleted (Ahmad et al., 2015). Furthermore, extensive use of the nonrenewable source of energy leads to an increase in CO2 emission, which is responsible for the greenhouse effects and climate changes. Such argent circumstances pose the need for renewable resources such as solar energy to produce efficient, safe hydrogen energy to fulfill potential energy needs. Hydrogen as a renewable, zero-emission fuel, and environmentally friendly can be considered as an alternative to fossil fuel (Veziroglu et al., 2008; Balat et al., 2008). Hydrogen contains higher energy compared to natural gasoline and can be obtained from different sources (Kapdan et al., 2006), besides its non-toxic and can be easily chemically or physiochemically stored (Shakya et al., 2005). Nowadays, around 500 billion Nm3 hydrogen is industrially produced annually (Demirbas et al., 2009). Nevertheless, fossil fuel stills the major source of hydrogen production (Hosseini et al., 2016). Currently, green and inexpensive techniques for H2 generation are gained attractive interest for photocatalyst chemists (Pinaud et al., 2013; Chen and Mao, 2017), Naseri et al summarized different methods for hydrogen production in comparison to photocatalytic water splitting (Naseri et al., 2017). Thanks to its natural resource usage and zero CO2 emissions, photocatalytic hydrogen processing is among those technologies the greenest process. Nowadays, most of the industrial hydrogen production is used in the production of ammonia and methanol (Konieczny et al., 2008), and a very small amount was used for energy purposes. Moreover, their special properties make hydrogen suitable for transportation fuel (Balat et al., 2007). Fig. 1 (Nocera, 2012) represents hydrogen production and storage in the photocatalytic hydrogen system. Moreover, Balat et al summarized the hydrogen production from biomass and different production technologies (Balat et al., 2010)."
1,TiO2 as photocatalyst,"1.1 TiO2 as photocatalyst Being the popular photocatalyst, TiO2 or titania has gained more popularity and the most studied photocatalyst due to various advantages, such as high thermal and chemical stability, low-cost, high photocatalytic efficiency, high refractive index, and non-toxicity (Fujishima et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010). As displayed in Fig. 2 a (Lana et al., 2013), the number of publications based on TiO2-based photocatalysts increases annually. For instance, an overview of the understanding and development of photocatalytic water treatment technology, from fundamentals of photocatalyst (mainly TiO2) and photoreactor development, to process optimization and kinetics modeling, and eventually the water parameters that affect the process efficiency was reviewed by Chong et al. (Chong et al., 2010). In another review, Schneider et al., summarized some issues of TiO2 photocatalysis including charge carrier transfer kinetics, novel mechanistic aspects, and unusual doping strategies to enhance photocatalytic activities and to broaden the accessible wavelength range (Schneider et al., 2014). The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and other semiconductors toward CO2 reduction to methane and methanol including the detailed mechanism and the electrochemical potentials of CO2 is reviewed in detail by Habisreutinger et al. (2013). The modification techniques as well as the chemical additives used for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward hydrogen production were highlighted by Ni et al. (2007). However, its photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is limited due to the wide bandgap energy and fast charge carrier recombination rate (Li et al., 2019; Tong et al., 2008). Thus, many attempts have been developed not only to reduce its bandgap energy but also diminish charge carriers recombination such as doping with metal (Xu et al., 2009) or nonmetal (Chen et al., 2004) to reduce the bandgap energy and coupling with other semiconductors (Poznyak., 2001; Liu et al., 2010a,b) or cocatalyst loading (John et al., 1983; Kim and Choi, 2002) for charge separation enhancement. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) exists in three types of crystals; anatase, rutile, and brookite. Fig. 2b–d (Zhang et al., 2014) shows three different crystal structures of TiO2. Anatase with the bandgap energy of 3.2 eV is the most active photocatalytic polymorph of titania owing to the higher kinetic stability (Etacheri et al., 2011). Compared to brookite, anatase can be easily obtained in pure form (Lee and Yang, 2005). Rutile with the lowest bandgap energy of around 2.96 eV is the most stable form of titania and is commonly used as a white pigment (Paola et al., 2008). On the other hand, the brookite phase is not commonly used in photocatalysis because it cannot be obtained in the pure form as anatase or rutile phase (Chi-Hung et al., 2012)."
2,Photocatalytic water splitting,"1.2 Photocatalytic water splitting Since the pioneering work for photodecomposition of water in the presence of Pt and TiO2 electrodes under UV light done by Japanese scientists Fujishima and Honda in 1972 (Fig. 3 (a)) (Chi-Hung et al., 2012), many efforts have been demonstrated on various semiconductors such as metal oxides (Ismael et al., 2017; Ismael & Wark, 2019), (oxy)nitride (Maeda et al., 2005; Edalati et al., 2020), (oxy)sulfide (Tsuji et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010) and polymers (Yamasita et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2011) to produce hydrogen under visible light irradiation. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation is a thermodynamically uphill reaction accompanied by positive Gibbs free energy (237 kJ/mol or 1.23 eV). Therefore, the bandgap energy (Eg), which can be described as the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band of the photocatalytic semiconductor should be 3.0 eV > Eg > 1.23 eV, to use visible light it should be >400 nm and <1000 nm. In general, this process has three main steps: light absorption or harvesting from the illuminated light source, charge carriers generation (positive holes in the valence band (VB) and negative electrons in the conduction band (CB)), charge immigration, transfer, and separation, and initiation of the redox reaction on the photocatalyst surface (electrons act as a reducing agent to reduce water to hydrogen, on the other hand, holes acts as an oxidizing agent to oxidize water to oxygen) (Fig. 3(b)) (Abe, 2010). For overall water splitting, the band position (VB & CB) of the photocatalyst should locate an inappropriate position to accomplish the overall water splitting reaction. For that, the lowest energy level of the CB should be more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential (EH2/H2O, 0 V vs. NHE). On the other hand, the highest energy level of the VB should be more positive than the oxygen evolution potential (EO2/H2O, 1.23 V vs. NHE) (Marepall et al., 2019). Fig. 3(c) (Acharya et al., 2018) presents the VB and the CB of the most common semiconductors. Other factors such as pH, charge transfer and separation, charge recombination, light intensity have a great influence on the efficiency of hydrogen production via water splitting. Most of the review articles reported in photocatalysis so far concentrate primarily on illustrating the applications of TiO2 for environmental remediation and environmental protection (Likodimos, 2018; Xing et al., 2017a,b; Banerjee et al., 2015a,b; Zhang et al., 2017; Mamaghani et al., 2017; Shayegan et al., 2017; Ganguly et al., 2017, Etacheri et al., 2015). On the other hand, some insightful review articles have been published for photocatalytic water splitting concerning several factors affecting the process including, the nature and the composite of photocatalyst, and the role of sacrificial reagent and cocatalyst in enhancing the photocatalytic performance (Nguyen-Phan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2014; Shimura & Yoshida, 2011; Leung et al., 2010). There are no comprehensive review articles that are mainly focused on metal/non-metal doped TiO2 for H2 production. The key aim of this article is to examine the recent advancement of the synthesis, classifications, characterization, and photocatalytic activity of different metal/non-metal dopants TiO2 for H2 production."
3,Synthesis of TiO2 doped materials,
4,Sol-gel method,"2.1 Sol-gel method The sol-gel method is a simple low-temperature method that is commonly used in nanoparticle preparation. It has many advantages, such as good homogeneity, fast method, low calcination temperature, and time. Thus the nanoparticles obtained are of good crystallinity and high surface area. According to this method, the precursors of the obtained materials were dissolved in a solvent (water or alcohol) and the pH was controlled until the sol is formed. Then, the gel was obtained by heating the solution containing precursors; oxide or hydroxide nanoparticles were produced by hydroxylation and polycondensation reactions. Finally, the gel was calcined to form nanoparticles at optimum calcination temperature. For instance, Dholam et al., successfully synthesized Fe and Cr doped TiO2 thin film employing combined RT and sol-gel methods. The activities of as-prepared doped TiO2 photocatalysts were tested for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Results showed that the doped materials have higher activities than undoped TiO2 that attributed to the role of Cr and Fe that act as electrons trapping agents (Dholam et al., 2009). In another study, Li et al., used the sol-gel method to prepare N-doped TiO2 using ethylenediamine as a nitrogen source for hydrogen evolution and degradation of methyl orange. (1:1) the ratio of EDTA to TiO2 (TON-1) calcined at 500 °C shows the highest photocatalytic performance (Fig. 4 (a–d)) (Li et al., 2015a,b). Reduced bandgap energy and improved light absorption were assumed to be responsible for improving the activity of N-doped titania. Zhu et al., prepared Pt doped TiO2 hollow spheres using the sol-gel method for hydrogen production activity (Zhu et al., 2016). The optimum amount of Pt was 1.0 wt% showed the highest hydrogen production activity. Importantly, after 30 h Pt doped, the hollow sphere of TiO2 demonstrated apparent stability. The highest activity can be due to the effective charge separation given by surface deposited Pt nanoparticles. Wang et al., used combined sol-gel and hydrothermal methods to synthesize gold-embedded boron-doped TiO2 which demonstrated a well-enhanced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity (Wang et al., 2014a,b). Among differently prepared photocatalysts, Au0.5/B-TiO2 showed the highest activity (Fig. 5 a and b), which was attributed to the enhanced light absorption and the influence of the plasmon resonance effect of Au in enhancing the charge separation (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the presence of Au and B could facilitate the charge separation and transfer as shown in Fig. 5d. Huang et al., have effectively co-doped TiO2 nanorods (Rh, Nb) with a combined sol-gel/hydrothermal approaches and used this (Rh, Nb) co-doped TiO2 nanorods in UV and visible-light photocatalytic H2 production in an aqueous solution containing methanol as a sacrificial reagent. (Huang et al., 2018). Ti0.996Nb0.002Rh0.002O2 presented an obvious photocatalytic hydrogen production activity compared to other co-doped photocatalysts and bare TiO2. Interestingly, efficient charge separation and the role of Rh in creation an impurity level above the VB of TiO2 for bandgap narrowing were believed to be responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. In the end, the sol-gel method has been commonly used as an attractive and promising method in the preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles or thin film. Furthermore, the sol-gel method does not require high temperature as in solid-state reaction or complex equipment as in the microwave assistant method."
5,Hydrothermal/solvothermal method,"2.2 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method A hydrothermal or solvothermal method is commonly used in inorganic chemistry for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials with various morphologies for different applications. The difference between these two methods is that the formerly used water as a solvent. This process conducts a chemical reaction under regulated temperature and pressure in solvents found in autoclave vessels constructed of sealed steel autoclave. This requires two stages; the nucleation and development of crystals. Furthermore, this system carefully regulates many parameters that affect the synthesis such as pH, temperature, additives, and others. Thereafter, nanomaterials with high crystallinity and appropriate particle size and morphology could be obtained. For instance, Sun et al., successfully deposited Ag and Fe over anatase TiO2 using the solvothermal method (Sun et al., 2013). The photocatalytic activity of the double-doped metals was assisted for hydrogen production. Among different doped materials, 4.5% Fe-4.5% Ag/TiO2 displayed the highest hydrogen production activity that ascribed to the improvement of light absorption and enhancement of the charge separation efficiency. In another study with different dopants, Sun et al., successfully fabricated N-doped TiO2 nanobelts with Coexposed (001) and (101) facets via the hydrothermal method (Sun et al., 2013). Results showed that these surface heterojunction Coexposed (001) and (101) facets of N-doped TiO2 Nanobelts presented the highest activity for hydrogen evolution. Special charge separation of the charge carriers providing by this structure was believed to be the reason for the highest activity. Inspired by Wu’s work, bismuth-doped titanium dioxide (Bi-doped TiO2) was hydrothermally synthesized and applied for hydrogen production (Wu et al., 2014). 0.5% mol Bi over TiO2 showed the highest activity under UV-A and UV-B irradiation (Fig. 6 a and b). The higher activity was assigned to the enhanced light absorption (Fig. 6c) and reduced the bandgap energy (Fig. 6d) Significantly, Wang et al., hydrothermally synthesized F− selective etching and doping on {001} facets of anatase TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts was tested for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (Wang et al., 2018). Doped TiO2 nanosheet containing 6.9 wt% F- (DE3) revealed the highest activity (Fig. 7 a) that was mainly attributed to the enhanced light absorption (Fig. 7b) and efficient charge separation (Fig. 7c and d). The hydrothermal process often commonly used for the preparation of various metal oxides of specific morphologies due to many advantages such as the enhancement of chemical activity as it performs in an aqueous environment, improved regulation of nanoparticles size and shape, and induced crystallization. Nevertheless, the high cost of the sealed autoclave, impossible to observe the reaction process and some safety issues limit its application in the synthesis of nanomaterials."
6,Precipitation method,"2.3 Precipitation method Besides the sol-gel method and hydrothermal/solvothermal method, the precipitation method serves as one of the attractive methods for the synthesis of nano-catalysts. It is a very simple method and very active photocatalyst with high surface area and small particle size can be easily obtained by this method (Demirci et al., 2018). In the precipitation method, precursors of the metals dissolved in an appropriate solvent in a glass beaker. Then, the mixture was stirred with gentle heating. After that, the pH was carefully controlled. Finally, the oxide photocatalyst can be obtained by centrifugation, filtration, and washing several times with water and alcohol. Recently, Ismael et al., synthesized Fe (III) doped TiO2 via precipitation method using TiCl4 and iron nitrate as the precursors for titania and iron, respectively (Ismael, 2020). The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts was tested for the hydrogen production and degradation of organic pollutants. 0.1% wt Fe doped TiO2 showed the highest activity. Importantly, by increasing the amount of iron, the activity is decreased that attributed to iron acts as a recombination center at high concentration. In another study, Yoong et al used a combination of precipitation and impregnation methods to synthesize different concentrations of Cu doped TiO2 for hydrogen production activity (Yoong et al., 2009). It found that 10% wt Cu sintered at 300 °C showed the highest activity. Light absorption enhancement and the reduction of the bandgap energy play major roles in photocatalytic activity enhancement. Gold deposited on the surface of TiO2 and their activity enhancement for hydrogen production was studied by Ruiz et al., Photocatalysts were prepared by precipitation-deposition method at different calcination temperatures (Ruiz et al., 2013). The optimal gold loading on the TiO2 surface was 0.5% wt presented the highest activity. The highest activity of the doped TiO2 compared to the bare was ascribed to the role of Au that acts as electron traps and hydrogen evolution site. Visible light absorption was enhanced in the presence of Au nanoparticles. In addition, the photocatalysts were activated at different temperatures and showed that at 500 °C presented the broadest spectrum and redshift absorption. Parida et al., developed a new precipitation method for the synthesis of meso-macroporous N-doped TiO2 with special morphology (Parida et al., 2013). The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was assessed for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Catalyst calcined at 400 °C exhibited the highest activity (Fig. 8 a), which is attributed to the special mesoporous structure and morphology that facilitate the charge transfer and separation (Fig. 8b&c) and also to the narrowing of the bandgap energy (Fig. 8d). Recently, the work of Ismael et al., for example, demonstrated that Ru doped TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully achieved by a simple precipitation method, showing highly effective visible-light performance toward hydrogen production via water splitting with respect to bare TiO2 nanoparticles (Ismael et al., 2019a,b). The surprisingly strongly improved efficiency of 0.1% wt Ru was mainly due to the role of ruthenium ion in improving the separation of charges. While this process has some disadvantages such as severe agglomeration, and difficulty in regulating the size and poor morphology are still commonly used in nanoparticle synthesis."
7,Microwave-assisted method,"2.4 Microwave-assisted method The microwave-assisted method is gaining popularity in the synthesis of nanoparticles due to its high rate of reaction, simple and fast technique, green method, and efficiency in energy transfer. According to this method, materials were heated by irradiation instead of thermal heating used for conventional methods. Diploe moment in the reaction mixture was achieved by the interaction of microwave irradiation with the polar molecule. The activity may influence the molecule's rotation. This orientation contributes to an improvement in the probability of collision between molecules and a decrease in energy activation and heat output, resulting in increased reaction and the formation of the nanoparticle. Therefore, applying this method for the synthesis of nanoparticles has more advantages over the conventional synthesis method (Seola et al., 2011; Komarneni et al., 2002). A series of different metal ions over N-doped TiO2 was synthesized using benign microwave-assisted method documents by Lin et al., All of the metal ions co-doped N-TiO2 photocatalysts demonstrated higher photocatalytic hydrogen production performance than the N-TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 (Lin and Shih, 2016). Among different metal dopants, copper exhibited the highest activity (Fig. 9 a–d). The surprisingly highly improved efficiency of Cu/N-TiO2 was primarily due to the synergistic effects of copper and nitrogen generating impurity energy level, decreasing bandgap energy, as well as their role in enhancing the charge separation, resulting in the highest possible photocatalytic activity. Fan et al., prepared anatase nanotubes Ag-Ce/TiO2 by microwave-assisted chemical reduction, which showed improved photocatalytic efficiency under UV and Vis light irradiation on hydrogen evolution (Fan et al., 2015). 0.2 mMAg-0.3 mMCe/TiO2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen activity, which was attributed to the role of surface plasmon resonance of Ag in enhancing charge transfer and separation and the influence of Ce ion in narrowing the bandgap energy. Furthermore, enhance charge separation and light absorption are also confirmed by the photoluminescence spectra and UV–Vis absorption curve, respectively. Microwave-assisted synthesis is known as a central branch of green chemistry. It has received a lot of popularity as it is a simple and environmentally sustainable process that better utilizes energy relative to traditional forms like the oil or sand bath method. Nonetheless, high-cost equipment, unsuitable scale-up production together with the difficulty in monitoring the reaction process limits its application in nanoparticle synthesis."
8,Solid-state reactions method,"2.5 Solid-state reactions method The solid-state chemical reaction for nanomaterials production is a promising method and widely used in photocatalysis (Ismael et al., 2019a,b; Ismael et al., 2018; Ismael et al., 2019a,b). Comparing to other methods such as microwave or hydrothermal, the solid-state reaction is very cheap and does not need special equipment or solvent to perform. During this process, the powders of the nanomaterials obtained by the precursor were carefully mixed, after which the powder mixture was transferred to clean crucible alumina and calcined at high temperature. This process can also produce a large-scale production of the high crystallinity nanoparticles and can be used primarily in the photodegradation of organic contaminants. For instance, Ghorbanpour et al., recently used a solid-state reaction for the synthesis of Fe doped TiO2 using TiO2 and FeCl3 powder (Ghorbanpour and Feizi, 2019). The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was investigated for the degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation. The Fe doping content of 0.5 wt% presents the highest activity that is attributed to the improvement of light absorbance and reduction of the bandgap energy. In another study, Liu et al., successfully obtained Zn doped TiO2 by a combined sol-gel and solid-state methods for photodegradation of RhB (Liu et al., 2005). It was observed that TiO2 doped with 0.5 wt% Zn and calcined at 500 °C prepared by a solid-state reaction exhibited the highest activity relative to that prepared by the sol-gel process, which allocated the small particle size and improved diffusion of Zn into the lattice of TiO2. Fluorine is another nonmetal that can be used to dope with TiO2. For instance, Umadevi et al., obtained environmentally benign F doped TiO2 nanoflakes photocatalysts via a facile solid-state reaction procedure (Fig. 10 ), which showed a superb performance in methyl orange (MO) degradation (Umadevi et al., 2014). You et al., obtained S/Cr doped mesoporous TiO2 photocatalysts by a facile solid-state reaction approach, accompanied by a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic capability in the degradation of bromocresol green (BCG) under visible light irradiation (You et al., 2011). Results showed that 5S-5Cr exhibited the highest photocatalytic degradation activity. Enlarge surface area together with a narrow pore size distribution were responsible for the photocatalytic activity enhancement compared to S-TiO2, Cr-TiO2, and bare TiO2. Bouaine et al., used a solid-state reaction to synthesize Co-doped TiO2 by combining CoCO3·H2O with commercial TiO2 with enhanced structural, optical, and magnetic properties (Bouaine et al., 2012). This process used for the synthesis of nanoparticles due to its facile, easiness, and low-cost. Nevertheless, this method used very high calcination temperatures which lead to nanoparticles with limited surface area and broad particle size which decrease their photocatalytic activity."
9,Other methods,"2.6 Other methods Besides, the most common methods used for the synthesis of doped-TiO2 that are mentioned above, less common methods are also available such as impregnation, polyol, spin coating, flame spray pyrolysis, and many others. For instance, Yang et al., tested different noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Rh) doped TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen production in the presence of different alcohols (Yang et al., 2006a,b). Both photocatalysts were prepared using the impregnation method using chloride as precursors of noble metals. Our results found that Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 displayed greater activity than Rh/TiO2. Rh/TiO2 exhibited lower activity was due to the weak interaction between the metal sample and the accompanying titanium oxide. Additionally, as sacrificial reagents, ethanol and methanol show the highest activity than other alcohols used in the study. In another interesting study using the same synthesis method, Chen et al., studied the mechanistic of the photocatalytic reaction of methanol for hydrogen production on Pt/TiO2 by in situ Fourier Transform IR (Chen et al., 2007). Results indicated the Pt nanoparticles can control the adsorption capacity of methanol on TiO2. Furthermore, Pt nanoparticles play a key role in enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production by acting as a trap for excited electrons, which are important for improving the yield of long-lived electrons. Lalitha et al., successfully produced a Cu-doped TiO2 with varying amounts of Cu photocatalyst with a visible-light response by impregnation method that demonstrated improved photocatalytic efficiency in aqueous solutions containing glycerol for hydrogen production (Lalitha et al., 2010). Maximum hydrogen production was obtained for the doped TiO2 containing 2 wt% Cu in pure water and an aqueous solution containing glycerol. The higher activity for 2 wt% Cu/TiO2 was mainly ascribed to the reduced bandgap energy. Chiarello et al., prepared a series of fluorinated Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts by on step flame spray pyrolysis method (Fig. 11 a), which showed well-improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with visible light (Chiarello et al., 2014). Among different fluorinated Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts tested, 5% wt F showed the highest activity (Fig. 11b), which attributed to the efficient charge separation. Importantly, a XANES spectrum shows no change in the oxidation state of Pt in the absence of irradiation as shown in Fig. 11c. In the same group, Chiarello et al., employed the same synthesis method to prepare a set of Au modified TiO2 (Chiarello et al., 2008). The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized photocatalyst was tested for hydrogen production in pure water and an aqueous solution containing methanol. Improved photocatalytic behavior of Au-doped TiO2 was primarily due to the higher surface area and improved crystallinity compared with commercial titania. Since their outstanding properties such as low-cost, mechanical consistency, environmentally sustainable, and large surface region, Mesoporous TiO2 materials have received a great deal of interest, which has a great influence on enhancing its photocatalytic performance. In that matter, Zhou et al., successfully prepared ordered mesoporous black TiO2 photocatalysts via the evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method, which exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances (Fig. 12 a) (Zhou et al., 2014). Results indicated that ordered mesoporous black TiO2 exhibited higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity than the pristine ordered mesoporous TiO2 materials (Fig. 12b) that were assigned to the efficient charge separation as displayed in Fig. 12c and d. Rahul et al., successfully in situ loaded gold- platinum bimetallic nanoparticle over titania photocatalysts (Rahul et al., 2018). Gold- platinum bimetallic exhibited higher photocatalytic hydrogen production compared to gold or platinum doped TiO2 that ascribed to the role of bimetallic in enhancing charge separation. Further studies were reported on the doped-TiO2 by different metals or nonmetals synthesized by different methods for photocatalytic hydrogen production were summarized in Table 1 ."
10,Characterization of doped TiO2,"To investigate the presence of the dopant elements and their influences on the charge separation performance and the origin of activity of the doped TiO2 materials, several characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET), and several electrochemical techniques should be applied (Hussain et al., 2014). For instance, XRD was used for determining the nature of the phase and the degree of crystallinity of the synthesized materials. Sun et al., hydrothermally synthesized N-doped TiO2 nanobelts with a surface heterojunction composed of both (101) and (001) facets, which demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production (Sun et al., 2016). XRD results showed that N-doped TiO2 nanobelts contain only the anatase phase of titania. Importantly, XRD patterns show no peaks related to nitride, confirming that nitrogen atoms are well inserted into the TiO2 matrix (Fig. 13 (a)). Ironically, the size of the lattice decreases by replacing the oxygen atom with a large nitrogen atom in the TiO2 matrix contribute to the shift of the crystal plane (101) towards lower diffraction peaks (Fig. 13(b)). The presence of the dopant elements on the surface of the TiO2 can be performed using XPS, as shown in Fig. 13(c), the two peaks at 464.5 and 458.7 eV correspond to the octahedral Ti4+ state in bare TiO2 (Asahi et al., 2011). The binding energy of 529.9 and 531.6 eV can be assigned to the lattice oxygen and surface oxygen, respectively (Zhu et al., 2004). Fig. 13(d) showed the peaks shifting of both Ti 2p and O 1s for the N-doped TiO2 that inconsistent with the XRD results. In another study, Xu et al., studied the mechanism of the photo-thermochemical cycle for water splitting over TiO2 and Fe-doped TiO2 synthesized via a facile sol-gel method (Xu et al., 2017). UV-DRS were used to estimate the bandgap energy of the bare and Fe-doped TiO2 (Ashok et al., 2018). Their results showed that the Fe-doped TiO2 (3.15 eV) has lower bandgap energy and better light absorption than that of TiO2 (3.26 eV) (Fig. 14 (a)). Besides, the key peaks identified for the two materials in the region of 300–400 nm were due in titanium to the transformation from O-2p to Ti-3d. The EDXS technique was used to evaluate the coexistence of different bare and doped TiO2 components. As shown in Fig. 14(b), the bare titania contains only Ti and O elements, while in Fig. 14(c) iron was observed in the Fe-doped TiO2. Also, the presence of iron was confirmed by the peak shifting in the XRD that attributed to the lattice expansion due to the formation of Fe-O-Ti bonds (Fig. 14(d)). Fe and Ni co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using the alcohol-thermal method accompanied by wonderful hydrogen production visible-light-activity, documented by Sun et al., Their investigations reported that all the photocatalysts with Fe and Ni co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles displayed better photocatalytic efficiency than the pristine TiO2 (Sun et al., 2012). Moreover, SEM and TEM were used to determine the morphology and fine structure and particle size, respectively. SEM image showed that doped materials (Fig. 15 (a)) have a smaller particle size than bare TiO2 (Fig. 15(b)). TEM image presented that 5.0% Fe-4.0% Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles (the most active) has a particle size of 14 nm (Fig. 15(c)), which agrees with the XRD results (Fig. 15(d)). Furthermore, the specific surface area plays a crucial role in the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts; photocatalyst with high surface possess higher activity, which ascribed to the enhancement of light absorption and inhibition of charge recombination (Fujishima et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2010). Pany et al., obtained easy precipitation and deposition methods for hierarchical meso-macroporous S, N-modified TiO2 photocatalysts, accompanied by a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity of the hydrogen production under visible light irradiation (Pany & Parida, 2014). 4SNTP-400 showed the highest activity that was attributed to the high surface area and narrow pore size distribution (Fig. 16 (a)). Also, the existence of different functional groups in 4SNTP-400 was performed by using FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the main peak at around 1385 cm−1, confirming the presence of hyponitrite groups. Characteristic peaks at 1220, 1130, 1054, and 985 cm−1 are attributed to the bidentate C2v SO4 2− coordinate to Ti4+ (Pany et al., 2013; Naik et al., 2010; Parida et al., 2008). Baran et al., successfully fabricated Ag-doped TiO2-NTs using an electrodeposition method with decent photocatalytic performance which was utilized in the hydrgen production (Baran & Yazici, 2016). Interestingly, flat band potential and charge density were estimated using the Mott-Schottky relation (Lee et al., 2015; Sang et al., 2011). As shown in Fig. 16(c), compared to undoped TiO2-NTs electrodes, the Ag-doped TiO2-NTs electrodes show a positive shift in the flat band potential, which can be assigned to a shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band with increasing carrier density (Yang et al., 2014; Whitman and Raja, 2014; Baran and Yazıcı, 2017), which increase with increasing Ag doping concentration. The increase in the charge density value facilitates the charge transport in photocatalyst, leading to improved hydrogen evolution performance of the Ag-doped TiO2-NTs (Lacnjevac et al., 2015). Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry provides information on the electron transport properties and was measured for Ag-doped TiO2-NTs and un-doped TiO2-NTs at various deposition times in 1 M KOH. As seen in Fig. 16(d), for undoped photocatalyst, the peak recorded at −1.6 V can be assigned to the reduction of titanium and to hydrogen production (Liao et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014), while the anodic (I and II) and cathodic (III and IV) peaks that observed in case of doped electrodes are attributed to the oxidation of silver and reduction of silver oxide, respectively. Furthermore, 1800s-Ag/TiO2-NTs presented the highest hydrogen production activity due to the increase in the cathodic current. In addition to the influence of the surface area, particle size, charge density, and flat band potential, charge transfer and separation also have great effects on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Thus, transition photocurrent (PC), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photoluminescence (PL) should be performed to determine the charge separation efficiency performance in the photocatalyst. PC is widely accepted as an efficient and attractive method to demonstrate the charge separation efficiency in the photocatalysts (Thomas et al., 2014; Tonda et al., 2016). Furthermore, PL emission results from the charge recombination. The stronger PL peak usually indicates the higher recombination of the photogenerated carriers and the lower photocatalytic activity (Zhao et al., 2015; Nikhil et al., 2014. EIS is also effective in examining the migration and interface reaction ability of electrons in a semiconductor. A small EIS arc size usually represents a low interface resistance of the photoelectrode (Pérez et al., 2017; Qu et al., 2018). The work of Qiang et al., for example, demonstrated that black Ni-doped TiO2 photoanodes were successfully achieved by anodization reduction method, showing highly effective visible-light photoelectrochemical water-splitting with respect to bare TiO2 (Qiang et al., 2015). Mott-Schottky plot revealed adverse changes in the onset potential of the Ni-doped TiO2. This change is very advantageous for improved charge separation and higher output of hydrogen (Fig. 17 (a)). Moreover, the higher activity of the black Ni-doped TiO2 compared to undoped TiO2 was attributed to the efficient charge separation providing by the presence of nickel and revealed by the PC and EIS measurements (Fig. 17(b and c)). In another study, Fan et al., successfully synthesized Ag–Fe/TiO2 NTs (NT: nanotubes) via the microwave-assisted method (Fan et al., 2014). The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples exhibited high photocatalytic hydrogen production compared to the pure TiO2 that was mainly ascribed to the reduced charge recombination rate, which was performed using PL measurements (Fig. 17(d)). Raman spectroscopy has been used to conduct the phase structure of the nanoparticles and to prove the doping mechanism. For this, Babu et al., used sol-gel and electrospinning methods to prepare the (N-TiO2) with particular nanostructure morphology (Babu et al., 2012) for determining the hydrogen production activity. Raman spectroscopy results showed that all peaks at A1g (518.7 cm−1), B1g (399.2, 519 cm−1), and Eg (144.5, 197, 640 cm−1) are assigned to the anatase phase of titania (Berger et al., 1993). Furthermore, peaks intensity and width were broadened and positively shifted, which lead to enhance the crystallinity and decrease the particle size (Fig. 18 (a)). 5% N-TiO2 presented the highest activity that ascribed to the reduced in bandgap energy confirmed by UV–Vis DRS measurement (Fig. 18(b)) and to the enhanced charge transfer and separation revealed by the photocurrent analysis (Fig. 18(c and d)) (Babu et al., 2012)."
11,Doping method for photocatalytic activity enhancement of TiO2,"Recently, Titania (TiO2) (Zhang et al., 2018a,b; Hainer et al., 2018), cadmium sulfide (CdS) (Vaquero et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2017), and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) (Ismael et al., 2019a,b) are the most studied photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. Among them, TiO2 as the best-known photocatalysts has gained great attention due to its exceptional physicochemical characteristics (Haselmann & Eder, 2017; Tiwari et al., 2017). However, it’s wide bandgap energy; only activated under UV-light irradiation (λ ≤ 390 nm), which occupied around 4% of the total solar energy (Murakami et al., 2010; Nakamura et al., 2013). The fast charge carrier recombination rate at the surface or within the bulk is another limitation of this semiconductor (Samokhvalov, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a,b). All these limitations restrict its wide practical applications. To this end, many methods have been established recently to boost the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 either by reducing its bandgap energy by metal ion doping (Song et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2012), nonmetal doping (Marschall & Wang, 2014; Li et al., 2015a,b) and self-doping (Zuo et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2014) or by improving charge separation by coupling with other semiconductors that have appropriate band position (Mulewa et al., 2017; Xing et al., 2017a,b) or by metal or noble metal loading (Guayaquil-Sosa et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2007). Among these different modification methods of TiO2, the doping method is the most promising approach. Doping is defined as the incorporation of the foreign elements (metal or nonmetal) in the forbidden band of the host semiconductor without altering its crystallinity. Usually, in the bandgap of the host semiconductor (TiO2), dopant metal or nonmetal produces an impurity energy level that specifically affects the electronic and optical properties of TiO2 by reducing the bandgap energy, thereby allowing for more noticeable charging absorption. Furthermore, dopants can act as an electron trap, facilitate charge separation, and diminish their recombination. Furthermore, they provide a new site for hydrogen production (Umezawa & Ye, 2012). All these factors together increase the photocatalytic activity performance of the photocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution. Recently, Kumaravel et al., reviewed the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of different dopants (Cu, Pt, and Au) over TiO2 (Kumaravel et al., 2019). Their study mainly concentrated on designing photocatalytic reactors, kinetics, and the mechanism of metal-doped TiO2. In another review, Khaki et al., summarized the recent development of different metal/nonmetal/halogens/ and co-doping doped TiO2 for photocatalytic degradation reaction (Khaki et al., 2017). In addition, this review showed several parameters that affect the degradation reaction."
12,Metal ions doping,"4.1 Metal ions doping As mentioned earlier, metal ions dopants have a great influence on the photocatalytic enhancement of the photocatalyst toward hydrogen production. In this process, the photocatalytic activity of the host semiconductor increased by reducing the bandgap energy. Metal ion creates either acceptor energy level below the conduction or donor energy level above the original valence band; makes it visible light active (Fig. 19 (a and b)) (Martha et al., 2015). Copper (Cu), as a kind of transition metal, is also found to be an effective dopant for TiO2 to enhance the photocatalytic activity. For instance, Bashiri et al., successfully synthesized a series of Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts in different H2O: alkoxide molar ratios via combined sol-gel/hydrothermal methods (Bashiri et al., 2015). The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was tested for hydrogen evolution in NaOH/glycerol solution. Photocatalyst with water: alkoxide ratios of 32 exhibited the highest activity that ascribed to the presence of NaOH/glycerol, enhanced visible light absorption, and reduce bandgap energy, better crystallinity, and the role of Cu1+ and Cu2+ for facilitating charge transfer and separation at the interface. Furthermore, reduced intensity and broadening in the XRD patterns corresponding to the reduced particle size. In another study, Wu et al., tested Bi-doped-TiO2 for hydrogen production activity and degradation of RhB. 1.0 wt% Bi presented the highest hydrogen production and photocurrent activity which attributed to the charge separation enhancement (Wu et al., 2009a,b). Interestingly, Sadanandam et al., obtained various weights of Co-doped TiO2 in the presence of glycerol through the simple impregnation method for evaluating hydrogen development activity under solar light (Sadanandam et al., 2013). 2 wt% Co displayed the maximum activity in pure water (Fig. 20 (a)). Furthermore, 1 wt% Co showed the highest activity in the presence of glycerol (5%) (Fig. 20(b and c)), the highest activity of the doped TiO2 compared to the bare TiO2 was attributed to the reduced bandgap energy (Fig. 20(d)). Peng et al., synthesized Be-doped TiO2 using impregnation and coprecipitation methods. Importantly, Be-doped TiO2 showed higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity compared to the bare TiO2. This study demonstrated that the surface interstitial sites are beneficial than that in the deep bulk (Peng et al., 2004) Silver (Ag) is another metal ion that can dope TiO2 to increase its performance in photocatalysis. The Ag/TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) were fabricated utilizing a microwave-assisted chemical reduction process inspired by Wu's work (Wu et al., 2013). The photocatalytic activity of the Ag-doped TiO2 photocatalysts has been measured for hydrogen production and MB degradation. Ag-doped TiO2 displayed a higher hydrogen evolution rate than bare TiO2 (Fig. 21 (a)), which was due to the enhancement of visible light absorption (Fig. 21(b)), and the efficient charge due to the surface plasmon resonance providing by the presence of the silver ion (Fig. 21(c and d)). Further metal ions are listed in Table 2 for their ability to generate hydrogen"
13,Nonmetal doping,"4.2 Nonmetal doping Nonmetal elements with strong ionizing energies and large electronegativity atoms such as N, S, C, F, B, and Cl have been commonly used as an effective tool for decreasing the recombination of the charging carrier in TiO2. This technique further raising the bandgap energy by moving the valence band of the host semiconductor upwards (Fig. 22 (a)) (Martha et al., 2015) that results from the interaction between the VB of the semiconductor and the O2p orbitals of the nonmetal atoms. Thus, according to this method, the optical absorption edge was extended, which lead to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the visible region. Among different nonmetal dopants, the nitrogen (N) element has been attracted more attention for enhancing the visible light activity of TiO2 by extending its absorption edge toward the visible region. For instance, Zhang et al., synthesized a sequence of N-doped TiO2 nanostructured photocatalysts using titanium nitride calcined at various calcination temperatures (Zhang et al., 2013). The as-prepared photocatalysts were assessed for hydrogen production under UV–Vis irradiation. N-TiO4 calcined at 450 °C exhibited the highest activity (Fig. 22(b)). The highest activity of the doped photocatalyst was attributed to the shifting of the bandgap energy toward the visible region (Fig. 22(c)). In addition, the presence of the nitrogen dopant is confirmed by the XRD measurement is shown in Fig. 22(d). In another study, Xiang et al., prepared nitrogen self-doped TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets by the solvothermal method, which demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic activity performance on hydrogen evolution reaction (Xiang et al., 2011). Interestingly, TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets exhibited higher activity than nitrogen-doped TiO2 microcrystalline with exposed {001} facets. Moreover, carbon (C) doping has also been proposed as one of the best candidates (Lin et al., 2013). It can increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by narrowing the bandgap energy for more visible light absorption. Parayil et al., hydrothermally synthesized C-doped TiO2 photocatalysts (Parayil et al., 2012). The photocatalytic activity of these materials was evaluated for hydrogen production under sunlight irradiation. 3.62% C showed the highest activity that ascribed to the efficient light absorption due to the decreased bandgap energy and to the better charge separation providing by the presence of carbon confirmed using PL spectra. Sulfur (S) can also be used as a dopant in TiO2 photocatalyst; it can increase the photocatalytic activity of titania by narrowing its bandgap energy (Liu et al., 2010a,b). The sulfur anion is barely absorbed into the crystalline lattice of TiO2 owing to its large ionic radius. Yang et al., have successfully synthesized the S‐doped (R)-TiO2 (R: rutile) core-shell structure using a two-step process (Yang et al., 2013). The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized core-shell structure was assessed for hydrogen production via water splitting under solar light irradiation. Compared to the bare TiO2 and S-doped (A)-TiO2 (A: anatase), S‐doped (R)-TiO2 exhibited excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. 23 (a)) due to the reduction in the bandgap energy (Fig. 23(b)) and efficient charge separation (Fig. 23(c and d)). In another interesting study, Luo et al., used the hydrothermal method to synthesize Br and Cl co-doped nanocrystalline TiO2 for the determination of hydrogen and oxygen evolution under UV light irradiation (Luo et al., 2004). The results show that Br and Cl-doped 70% anatase and 30% rutile have the highest activity that is attributed to the role of halide anions in decreasing the bandgap energy of TiO2. Many non-metal elements which may be deemed a suitable candidate for TiO2 doping are listed in Table 3"
14,Noble metal doping,"4.3 Noble metal doping Noble metal like Ag, Rh, Au, Pd, and Pt may also be seen as a successful candidate for TiO2 doping. Such noble metals can be conveniently accumulated on the titania surface using either impregnation or photodeposition method. TiO2 as a commonly used photocatalyst suffers from the recombination rate of large charge carriers, and its surface is not an appropriate site for the absorption of hydrogen ions. For that, loaded of these noble metal will be beneficial for charge separation enhancement as well as they can act as a hydrogen evolution site. In principle, these noble metals have higher work functions than TiO2 (Gupta et al., 2016), and because the Fermi energy level is lower than TiO2; once the noble metal loaded to the surface of TiO2, electrons are transferred through the Schottky barriers from the CB of TiO2 and trapped by these noble metals. Thus, hindering charge recombination and improving photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. For instance, Yu et al., hydrothermally synthesized Pt/TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets using Ti(OC4H9)4 and H2PtCl6 as precursors for titania and Pt, respectively (Yu et al., 2010). The photocatalytic activity of the Pt-doped TiO2 was investigated for hydrogen production. 2 wt% exhibited the highest activity compared to that P25 can be attributed to efficient charge separation of the Pt-doped TiO2. In another study, Sosa et al., used a soft template-assisted sol-gel method for the synthesis of a series of mesoporous TiO2. Then Pt-doped mesoporous titania photocatalysts were prepared by loading different amounts of Pt (1.0–5.0 wt%) and then calcined under different calcination temperatures (Guayaquil-Sosa et al., 2017). Among different prepared mesoporous Pt-doped TiO2, 2.50 wt% calcined at 550 °C exhibited the highest hydrogen production activity that ascribed to the role of Pt in narrowing the bandgap energy of TiO2. Because of the quantized charging property of gold (Au) nanoparticles, the Fermi level can be shifted to the more negative potential, which is very beneficial for enhancing the charging separation and improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (Subramanian et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2004). For instance, Liu et al., designed W-TiO2/Au photocatalysts using the facile multi-steps method (Liu et al., 2017). The results showed that W was successfully inserted into the TiO2 without changing the crystal structure of anatase TiO2. Importantly, Au loading increases the photocatalytic hydrogen activity of W-TiO2 which can be attributed to the reduction of the bandgap energy and enhanced charge separation efficiency. Wang et al., have effectively synthesized Au utilizing different sizes of Au nanoparticles, utilizing organic binders to sustain Pt/TiO2 using a seed-assisted method. Throughout the presence of methanol as a sacrificial reagent and Pt as a cocatalyst, Au nanoparticles with 20 nm show the highest photocatalytic hydrogen (Wang et al., 2017a,b) (Fig. 24 (a)) that attributed to the efficient charge separation providing by the two noble metal ions (Fig. 24(b–d)). Ruthenium (Ru) as a noble metal ion has a great influence on enhancing the charge separation efficiency of TiO2 due to the formation of Schottky barriers and localized surface plasmon resonance (Dahl et al., 2014; Ohno et al., 1999; Over, 2012). Recently, Ismael et al., prepared Ru-doped TiO2 photocatalysts via a simple precipitation method (Ismael et al., 2019a,b). Ru-doped TiO2 photocatalyst had a remarkably enhanced hydrogen production activity than pure TiO2 under visible light irradiation. 0.1 wt% Ru-doped TiO2 (S2) presented the highest hydrogen production activity (Fig. 25 (a)). The highest activity was attributed to the highest surface area (Fig. 25(b)) and the efficient charge separation confirmed by the photocurrent and electrochemical impedance measurement (Fig. 25(c nd d)). In another study, in the presence of methanol, Carceller et al., obtained a sequence of Pt-doped P25 for the determination of hydrogen production (Fontelles-Carceller et al., 2017). 5.0 wt% Pt showed the maximum activity, which contributed to the synergistic interaction between the Pt and TiO2. More studies utilizing different noble metal ions and their hydrogen production activities are summed up in Table 4 ."
15,Self-doped TiO2,"4.4 Self-doped TiO2 From the above discussion, it has been established that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been greatly restricted due to the rapid recombination of electron/holes and wide bandgap energy. Therefore, the key aim for the synthesis of highly active TiO2 is to find crucial approaches to improve the separation of charges and reduce the bandgap energy (Xu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018a,b). Recently, both experimental findings and theoretical projections have shown that interstitial Ti can cause impurity energy levels below the CB, while vacant Ti only causes impurity energy levels above the VB, which can contribute to extra shoulder absorption, thereby improving photocatalytic efficiency. (Justicia et al., 2002; Zuo et al., 2010a,b). Furthermore, the interaction of the charge carriers with these two defects has also a great influence on the electrical and band structure of TiO2 (Eslami et al., 2016). Cai et al., prepared TiO2(B) nanobelts to in situ generate TiO2(B)-anatase heterophase junction by the facile hydrogenation process, which demonstrated apparently enhanced conductivity and electrocatalytic performance on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under simulated sunlight irradiation (Cai et al., 2015). Results indicated that the atomically well-matched heterophase junction and disorder surface shell are responsible for enhancing charge separation, resulting in enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Significantly, Kang et al., obtained partially reduced TiO2 nanotube with a facile one-step chemical method in the presence of NaBH4. Formation of surface oxygen vacancy as well as in the interior of TiO2 could extend the absorption edge of TiO2 and restrain the charge carrier’s recombination (Kang et al., 2013). The work of Pei et al., for example, demonstrated that a defect and {111}-{110}facet mediated rutile TiO2 was successfully achieved by a simple oxidation reaction, showing highly hydrogen production activity with respect to commercial rutile TiO2 under simulated sunlight (Pei et al., 2016). Tests showed that the synergistic effect between the defects and facet is responsible for improving the separation of charge and light absorption, resulting in better photocatalytic activity. In another study, Chen et al., created subsurface/bulk TiO2-{001} nanocrystals using hydrogenation treatment (Chen et al., 2016). Their results showed that F1+ color centers and Ti3+ species are the dominant defects and responsible for enhancing the charge separation and improving light absorption. Yan et al., obtained In-situ C-N-S-tridoped single-crystal black TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets using a combined hydrothermal and solid-state chemical reduction methods (Yan et al., 2017). The synergetic effect of surface heterojunction between {001} and {101} facets is the main factor not only for enhancing light absorption but also for facilitating charge separation and transfer. Ji et al., developed ultrathin TiO2 nanosheet with large surface area and enhanced surface Ti3+ accumulation via a facile solution method (Ji et al., 2015). Moreover, they enhance the charge separation efficiency by coupling TiO2 nanosheets with CdSe QDs for hydrogen generation. Their findings revealed that the surface Ti3+ greatly promotes H free radical production as well as the construction of TiO2 nanosheets/CdSe QDs heterojunction improving the charge separation. Wang et al., designed anatase TiO2 microspheres with (101) facets using the solvothermal method and exhibited higher hydrogen production activity compared to anatase TiO2 (Fig. 26 a) (Wang et al., 2017a,b). Enhanced hydrogen production activity of anatase TiO2 microspheres with (101) facets was ascribed to enhance light absorption confirmed by UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 26b) and facilitate interfacial charge separation (Fig. 26&d). Mesoporous TiO2 has gained increasing interest because of its outstanding properties and promising applications in a wide range of fields. In that scenario, Hu et al., synthesized stable mesoporous black TiO2 using a facile solvothermal template-free method for determination the photocatalytic hydrogen activity (Hu et al., 2016). Large pore size and pore volume, highly crystalline pore-walls, Ti3+ in frameworks, and surface disorders, which obtained under high-temperature hydrogenation condition cause extending the photoresponse and enhanced the photocatalytic performance. Equally significant, Cao et al., manufactured black Ti3+/N-TiO2 mesoporous spheres with high crystallinity and surface area utilizing simple self-assembly induced evaporation (EISA) (Cao et al., 2017a,b). The photocatalytic activity of the mesoporous materials was tested for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Results revealed that the mesoporous black Ti3+/N-TiO2 spheres showed higher activity (Fig. 27 a) that was assigned to the enlarged specific surface area (Fig. 27b), enhanced light absorption (Fig. 27c), and efficient charge separation (Fig. 27d). Similarly, Cao et al., used the same synthesis method in the fabrication mesoporous black N-TiO2−x hollow spheres as efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts (Cao et al., 2017a,b). High crystallinity, large surface area, large pore size, and volume, narrow bandgap energy is responsible for efficient mesoporous black N-TiO2−x hollow spheres photocatalyst. In another study, Sun et al., fabricated a hierarchical hollow black TiO2/MoS2/CdS tandem heterojunction photocatalyst with enhanced hydrogen evolution performance (Sun et al., 2018). The key reason for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity is effective to charge separation as well as the expansion of light absorption."
16,Rare-earth metal doping,"4.5 Rare-earth metal doping Rare-earth metals with 4f, 5d, and 6s2 orbitals may also change the crystal structure and optical properties relative to transition metals and are considered a potential candidate to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (Wang et al., 2019; Boulbar et al., 2014). Mandarin et al., synthesized Gd3+ co-doped N-TiO2 via the sol-gel method (Mandari et al., 2018). The 2 wt% Gd3+ and N co-doped TiO2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen production in an aqueous solution containing methanol as a sacrificial reagent (Fig. 28 (a)), which assigned to the efficient charge separation (Fig. 28(b and c)) and increased visible light absorption (Fig. 28(d)). In another research, Khalid et al., used hybrid sol-gel and hydrothermal approaches to prepare Eu-TiO2/graphene composites under visible light irradiation to assess the hydrogen evolution rate (Khalid et al., 2018). Eu-TiO2/graphene displayed the maximum behavior relative to TiO2/graphene, Eu-TiO2/graphene, and mere TiO2. Improved charge separations, as well as enhanced light absorption caused by the synergistic effects of Eu and graphene, were believed to be responsible for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Asal et al., modified Ln3+/TiO2 by (Ln3+: Eu3+ or Sm3+ using the sol-gel method. The photocatalytic activities of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated for hydrogen and hydrocarbon production in the presence of acetic acid (Asal et al., 2011). Ln3+/TiO2 containing 0.05 mol % of Sm and Eu presented the highest activity due to the synergistic effects of both ions in enhancing charge separation of TiO2."
17,Conclusion and outlook,"In this review, we summarize the recent publications of photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2-based photocatalysts. Doping is an attractive method to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 either by narrowing the bandgap energy or enhancing the charge separation. Metal like Cu, noble metals like Au and Pt are the most commonly researched dopants for TiO2 owing to their superior work function. Nitrogen was also widely studied as a nonmetal dopant owing to its ability to reduce the bandgap energy of TiO2 and force the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Synthesis methods used to prepare several doped-TiO2 were also explained in more detail; several studies showed that the sol-gel method remains the most common methods used in the synthesis of doped-TiO2 due to several advantages including high surface area and low particle size of the prepared nanoparticles, and recorded at low calcination temperature. The characterization section revealed that UV–Vis-DRS, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are applied to determine the influence of dopant on the optical properties and charge separation efficiency of TiO2, respectively. However, several key points should be taken into consideration for the future research of doped-TiO2: Researchers should search for the optimum methods for the synthesis of the doped-TiO2, some methods need toxic and expensive chemicals and special high-cost equipment should be avoided. In addition, reaching the optimum amount of the dopant over TiO2 to achieve the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production activity is a critical point; otherwise, the highest dopant concentration can act as a recombination center. Furthermore, more studies should be focused on finding a cheap dopant to replace the high expensive noble metal dopants such as Pt or Au. In addition to all that, photocatalytic chemists should also be concentrated in finding a suitable sacrificial reagent that is used as a holes scavenger in the hydrogen production reaction. In the end, photoreactor designs for the lab-scale and piolet scale for H2 production should be discussed. To conclude, the doping method is still a promising method for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Nevertheless, studies should connect the theoretical kinetics and computational studies with the experimental one to give a clearer picture of the photocatalytic activity of these materials."
