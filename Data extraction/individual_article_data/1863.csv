0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), which has the highest energy density of all clean fuels at 122kJ per kg, about 2.75-fold greater than other hydrocarbon fuels (Balat and Kirtay, 2010) is considered to be an encouraging energy source for the future (Wang and Wan, 2009; Yildiz et al., 2009). Sugarcane leaves, a waste from sugarcane harvesting, are produced at up to 65 million tons per year in Thailand, representing an abundant carbon (C)- and hydrogen (H)-containing resource and are regarded as a promising renewable source for H2 production (Tock and Marechal, 2012). Gasification, as a high efficiency thermochemical conversion process, is one of the most intensively explored approaches for converting biomass to H2 (Chen et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the H2 concentration obtained from biomass gasification is mostly low (Ryu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2006). Therefore, steam has been introduced as the gasifying agent into the process to produce extra H2, where a large amount of H is displaced from the steam by the water-gas shift reaction (WGS) (Acharya et al., 2010). However, the H2 production from conventional biomass gasification with steam is still limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the chemical reaction (Wang et al., 2011), and the maximum H2 concentration obtained from biomass gasification is generally lower than 55% (Widyawati et al., 2011). The advanced sorption-enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP) process has been intensively investigated for a few decades in the fields of methane (CH4) reforming and coal gasification (Hufton et al., 1999; Satrio et al., 2007). The concept of the SEHP process for biomass gasification is explained as shown in Eqs. (1)–(3) below: (1) WGS reaction: CO(g)+H2O(g)⇌CO2(g)+H2(g) (2) CO2 adsorption (carbonation reaction): CaO(s)+CO2(g)⇌CaCO3(s) (3) SEHP: CO(g)+CaO(s)+H2O(g)⇌H2(g)+CaCO3(s) The WGS reaction, shown in Eq. (1), is the main reaction for controlling the H2 concentration but is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium. The SEHP reaction can shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the WGS reaction by adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2), as shown in Eq. (2), resulting in a higher yield and concentration of H2 in the produced gas (Eq. (3)) (Fujimoto et al., 2006; Hanoaka et al., 2005). Calcium oxide (CaO), known as a tar reforming agent, is also an effective and commonly used solid sorbent due to its low cost and abundance(Guan et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014). Increasing the CaO loading level was found to increase the steam gasification rate of Yallourn brown coal, and the reaction was completed within 25min at 700°C, some 150°C lower than steam gasification without any CaO (Ohtsuka and Tomita, 1986). The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of H2 production from biomass gasification has been studied with in situ CO2 capture (Florin and Harris, 2008; Constantinou et al., 2009), while the effect of various operation conditions, including the molar ratio of CaO to C, temperature and mass ratio of steam to biomass, on the characteristics of H2 production have been evaluated (Koppatz et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2005) and a significant increase in the H2 concentration and yield obtained. This improvement was attributed to the shift in the reaction equilibrium by the CO2 adsorption of CaO. The main problem of the CaO sorbent is that the CO2 adsorption capacity of CaO is easily reduced by 80% after several cycles (Silaban et al., 1996; Abanades., 2002; Corella et al., 2006), due to the sintering and agglomeration of the CaO particles, resulting in a reduced surface area (Lopez and Harrison, 2001). Magnesium oxide (MgO) can work as a skeleton and hinder the sintering and agglomeration of CaO-based sorbents during the carbonation and calcination cycles, and so is considered to be a good support additive (Park and Yi, 2012). Indeed, a wet-mixed CaO-MgO sorbent showed a porous microstructure and relatively high CO2 capture capacity (Luo et al., 2015). However, the relevant previous woks which studied about CaO-MgO mixing sorbent were only reported in the term of CO2 adsorption capacity. In this work, CaO/MgO mixing sorbents were introduced to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium in the WGS reaction by capturing CO2 for enhancing H2 production in steam reforming biomass-derived tar, called pyrolysis-gasification system. The CaO/MgO sorbents were prepared by a physical mixing method and characterized by means of Brunauer-Emmitt-Teller (BET), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and their CO2 adsorption capacity. Their influence in the steam pyrolysis-gasification of biomass was evaluated using a two-stage fixed bed reactor. However, the volatile components, which are released from different pyrolysis (devolatilization) temperatures, have a greater effect on the SEHP system. Therefore, the effects of the CaO/MgO molar ratio, sorbent preparation method, pyrolysis temperature and gasification temperature on the pyrolysis-gasification of biomass were all studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Biomass preparation and characterization,"2.1 Biomass preparation and characterization Sugarcane leaves, which are a widespread agricultural waste in Thailand, with particle sizes ranging from 250 to 300μm were employed as the biomass feedstock in this study. The feedstock was dried at 110°C for 24h. The proximate and ultimate analyses, in terms of the C, H and nitrogen (N) elemental compositions, of the biomass were performed following standard D3172-3175 using a CHN 2000 elemental analyzer. The oxygen (O) element was computed by the mass difference. The low heating value was analyzed using a bomb calorimeter. The results are summarized in Table 1 ."
3,Sorbent preparation and characterization,"2.2 Sorbent preparation and characterization Commercial CaO and MgO (Sigma-Aldrich, Co.) were calcined at 850°C for 3h. The CaO/MgO mixed sorbents were then physically mixed by either dry or wet mixing. For the dry mixing, CaO and MgO were mixed together at the desired molar ratio, and are designated as “DM X:Y”, where X and Y are the molar ratios of CaO and MgO, respectively. For the wet mixed sorbents, the desired molar ratios of CaO and MgO were mixed in deionized water and stirred well using a magnetic bar. The mixed solution was dried at 105°C for 24h, and then calcined at 850°C for 3h and designated as “WM X:Y”, with the same designations for X and Y as above. For instance, WM 1:1 stands for the CaO/MgO sorbent prepared by wet mixing at a CaO: MgO molar ratio of 1:1. The fresh and used CaO/MgO sorbents were analyzed by XRD using a Philips X’pert diffraction-meter with Cu Kα (λ=0.154nm) generated at 40kV and 20mA. The surface area of each catalyst was measured by nitrogen (N2) adsorption at −196°C using the BET method (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, ASAP 2020). The CO2 capture (adsorption) capacity was examined in a fixed bed reactor. For this, 1g of CaO/MgO sorbent was placed inside the reactor. Argon (Ar) and CO2 (Praxair, Co.) were fed through it at a flow rate of 100mL/min and 0.05mL/min, respectively. The electric furnace (Nabertherm RS 8013001M) was heated up to a desired temperature (similar to in the gasification zone). The outlet gas was collected periodically by a gas bag and analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using Unileads C column (3.00 mmID×2000nm length). The breakthrough curved was obtained from the CO2 outlet concentration and the amount of CO2 capture capacity was determined by integrating the area under the curve."
4,Experimental setup and methods,"2.3 Experimental setup and methods The experiment was performed in a two-stage fixed bed pyrolysis-gasification reactor, schematically shown in Fig. 1 . In the first stage, the reaction tube, with an inner diameter (ID) of 9mm and an effective length of 600mm, was loaded with the biomass materials and used for the pyrolysis process. In the second stages, the reaction tube had an ID of 19mm and an effective heating length of 890mm. The CaO/MgO sorbent was placed on quartz wool, which was used for sorption-enhanced gasification of the pyrolytic volatiles. A quartz tube (Lianyungang Inpu Quartz, Co.) of high temperature resistance was used for both stages. The pyrolysis (first stage) temperature was varied at 400, 600 and 800°C, and the gasification (second stage) temperature was varied at 600, 700 and 800°C, where 1g of CaO/MgO sorbent was loaded on quartz wool in the second stage. The two electric furnaces with temperature controller (Nabertherm RS 8013001M) were heated to the desired temperature, and Ar was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 100mL/min. After the reaction temperature in the pyrolysis and gasification zones became stable, the water was fed into the gasification zone by a high-performance liquid chromatography pump (Davis Instruments F05SFD01) into the steam generator (Indiamart, Co.) at a flow rate of 0.14mL/min. After 10min, as the steam fully filled the latter area, around 0.12g of the dried biomass (sugarcane leaves) was immediately dropped into the pyrolysis zone. The volatiles passed down through the CaO/MgO bed and reacted with H2O at the gasification zone. The tar component was trapped with 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Co.) and the condensable tar was analyzed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) (a Varian Model Saturn 220 equipped with a capillary column, 0.25 mm-OD×0.25 mm-fil thickness×30m length, DB–5ms, J&W Scientific). The column was held at 50°C for 3min, and then the temperature was raised to 220°C at rate of 20°C/min and held for 40min. The product gas was collected by a gas bag and analyzed by GC-TCD (Similar model with Section 2.2) to determine the gas composition."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of the CaO:MgO molar ratio on the gas yield,"3.1 Effect of the CaO:MgO molar ratio on the gas yield The gas yield from the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves with CaO/MgO sorbents of different CaO: MgO molar ratios was examined at 600°C for both the pyrolysis and gasification zones, with the results shown in Fig. 2 a. Pure CaO provided a H2 yield (7.4mmol/gbiomass, 54.4%) that was about four-fold higher than that without a sorbent (1.9mmol/gbiomass, 8.7%), while the CO2 yield was about three-fold lower. These results were attributed to the role that CaO plays as an effective CO2 sorbent. It had high potential to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of WGS reaction and enhanced H2 production (Guan et al., 2007). In contrast, pure MgO gave a 1.5-fold lower H2 concentration than pure CaO (but still higher than that with no sorbent), reflecting its weaker CO2 adsorption capacity (Li et al., 2010). However, the mixing of MgO and CaO rendered a positive effect on the H2 production, where the highest H2 yield (16.8mmol/gbiomass, 75.1%) and lowest CO2 yield (1.7mmol/gbiomass, 7.7%) were observed with the DM 2:1 sorbent. Increasing the molar ratio of MgO in the mixed CaO/MgO sorbent above 0.33–0.5 and 0.67 (DM 1:1 and DM 1:2) decreased the obtained H2 yield (1.4-fold) and increased that of CO2 yield (1.4-fold). For the synergistic study, the experimental yields have to compare with the predicted yield. The predicted yield (Ypredicted ) was obtained by following Eq. (4) to compare with the experimentally derived value. (4) Y p r e d i c t e d = X CaO × Y CaO + ( 1 − X CaO ) × Y MgO where, X CaO is the mass fraction of CaO in the mixing sorbent, and Y CaO and Y MgO stand for the individual yield of CaO and MgO, respectively. The Fig. 2b shows a comparison of the experimentally derived and the theoretically predicted values of the H2 and CO2 yields with different MgO to CaO molar ratios. All three CaO: MgO ratios exhibited higher experimental H2 yields and lower CO2 yields compared with the predicted values. This finding supports the synergy of the mixed CaO/MgO sorbents during the SEHP in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves (Krerkkaiwan et al., 2013a). The gas yield results were related with the CO2 adsorption capacity results which was deduced from the breakthrough curves at a reaction temperature of 600°C (Fig. 3 ). For the pure MgO, the amount of CO2 released increased rapidly from an adsorption time between 0 and 8min, which can be attributed to the fact that the MgO provided the lowest CO2 adsorption capacity. Although MgO can promote CO2 adsorption, the suitable temperature range for this is typically low (70–350°C) (Blamey et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010). Pure CaO and the mixed CaO/MgO sorbents showed no detectable CO2 release from an adsorption time between 0 and 4min and then rapidly increased from 8 to 10min with all the sorbents reaching equilibrium at around 12–14min. The highest CO2 adsorption capacity (12.6mmol/gsorbent) was observed with the DM 2:1 sorbent and increasing the molar MgO fraction above 0.33 (DM 2:1) reduced the CO2 adsorption capacity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the mixed CaO/MgO sorbent is positively correlated to the amount of CaO in the mixed sorbent (Luo et al., 2015). The presence of MgO in place of CaO in the mixed DM 2:1 sorbent provided a higher CO2 adsorption capacity than the pure CaO sorbent, indicating that there is a synergistic effect between CaO and MgO in the mixed sorbent. Although the MgO does not play a major role in CO2 adsorption itself at the reaction temperature over 500°C, it could prevent sintering of CaO during the carbonation and calcination cycles in the gasification process (Lopez and Harrison, 2001). However, increasing the MgO proportion in the mixed sorbent above a 0.33 molar ratio (DM 2:1) reduced the yield and concentration of H2 due to the reduced amount of CaO available for CO2 adsorption to promote the SEHP (Luo et al., 2015)."
7,Effect of the sorbent preparation method on the gas yield,"3.2 Effect of the sorbent preparation method on the gas yield Fig. 4 shows the gas yield obtained with the dry- and wet- mixed CaO/MgO sorbents in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves at a pyrolysis and gasification zone temperature of 600°C. The wet-mixed sorbents provided a higher H2 and lower CO2 yield than the dry-mixed sorbents at the same CaO: MgO ratio for both evaluated ratios (2:1 and 1:1). The WM 2:1 sorbent showed the highest H2 yield (21.3mmol/gbiomass, 79.8%) and lowest CO2 yield (1.1mmol/gbiomass, 4.3%). These finding are relevant results with CO2 adsorption capacity for the fresh CaO/MgO sorbents at 600°C as shown in Table 2 . The highest CO2 adsorption capacity was observed with the WM 2:1 sorbent (15.1mmol/gsorbent) and both WM sorbents showed a higher CO2 adsorption capacity than the corresponding DM ones. The main reason that could explain the difference between the wet- and dry- mixing methods comes from the phase analysis. Fig. 5 a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared fresh WM and DM mixed sorbents before being used in the pyrolysis-gasification reaction. All the fresh CaO/MgO sorbents showed both CaO and MgO peaks, but at different intensities. The intensity of the CaO and MgO peaks depended on the CaO: MgO molar ratio. However, all the samples produced by wet mixing were found to display peaks for the Ca(OH)2 phase, which has a higher reactivity in the gas-solid carbonation of Ca(OH)2 for CO2 adsorption, shown in Eq. (4), than the carbonation reaction of CaO at a high temperature (400–800°C). (4) Ca ( OH ) 2 ( s ) + C O 2 ( g ) ⇔ CaC O 3 ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) This is because the simultaneous expelling of the produced water during the gas-solid carbonation of Ca(OH)2 significantly enhanced the CO2 transfer from the gas phases towards the unreacted Ca(OH)2 surface. The wet mixed CaO/MgO sorbents consisted of both CaO and Ca(OH)2, which then promoted CO2 adsorption and SEHP (Montes-Hernandez et al., 2010). Table 3 shows the textural properties of the CaO, MgO and the different CaO/MgO mixed sorbents. The mixed sorbents showed a higher BET surface area than either the pure CaO or MgO ones. The highest BET surface area (30.6m2/g), as well as the largest pore volume and size, was observed in the WM 2:1 sorbent. Increasing the molar fraction of MgO up to 0.5 (WM 1:1) reduced the BET surface area (1.18-fold) and pore volume (1.08-fold). The large surface area and pore volume of WM 2:1 compared with other prepared sorbent may be attributed to high Ca(OH)2 content where pores are generated during the calcination of sorbents (Chen et al., 2018; Blamey et al., 2011). These results correlate to the CO2 adsorption of the sorbents as well as to the H2 production in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves. Thus, the BET surface area is likely to be an important factor in the SEHP."
8,Effect of the devolatilization temperature on the gas yield,"3.3 Effect of the devolatilization temperature on the gas yield The devolatilization temperature (the first stage of pyrolysis) has an important effect on the production of volatile components from the raw biomass (Li et al., 2014) Fig. 6 a shows the gas composition and H2 yield obtained from the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves with the WM 2:1 sorbent at devolatilization temperatures of 400, 600 and 800°C. Increasing the devolatilization temperature from 400°C to 600°C provided a higher H2 and lower CO2 yield. However, the H2 yield was then reduced when increasing the devolatilization temperature from 600°C to 800°C. This can be explained by the product distribution from the pyrolysis of sugarcane leaves with no sorbent (Fig. 6b). At a pyrolysis temperature of 400°C, the condensable volatile and gas products were the lowest, which might be the main factor that decreased the gas product in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves with a sorbent. Although a devolatilization temperature of 800°C showed a higher gas product level than at 600°C, the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves with the WM 2:1 sorbent showed the best result at a devolatilization temperature of 600°C. While there was no significant difference in the condensable volatile content obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C and 800°C, the compositions of these volatiles were examined since it was reported that the condensable component is one of the most effective factors in the catalytic pyrolysis-gasification process (Krerkkaiwan et al., 2013b). Fig. 7 shows the GC–MS analysis of the condensable volatiles from the pyrolysis of sugarcane leaves at different devolatilization temperatures of 600°C and 800°C. At 600°C (Fig. 7a), the condensable volatiles mainly consisted of oxygenated compounds (ketones), alcohols and phenols. These compounds are the major volatile components derived from the decomposition of cellulose and hemicelluloses at 600°C (Shi et al., 2012). Increasing the devolatilization temperature to 800°C (Fig. 7b) provided higher heavy aromatic compounds, such as naphthalene. Likewise, the tar derived from pine wood pyrolysis at devolatilization temperatures above 700°C was also reported to mostly contain heavy aromatic compounds (anthracene and fluorine) (Sun et al., 2011). The heavy aromatic hydrocarbons are poorly decomposed and less preferentially reacted with the steam over the WM 2:1 sorbent than the oxygenated compounds because of the high energy bond of the resonance CC in their aromatic rings, resulting the higher H2 yield at the devolatilization temperatures of 600°C (Jones et al., 2005; Suelves et al., 2002)"
9,Effect of the gasification temperature on the H2 yield and gas concentration,"3.4 Effect of the gasification temperature on the H2 yield and gas concentration Fig. 8 a shows the H2 yield and gas concentration from the SEHP in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves at different gasification temperatures with the WM 2:1 sorbent. When the gasification temperature was increased from 600°C to 800°C, the yield of H2 increased. However, the highest H2 concentration and the lowest CO2 concentration were observed at a gasification temperature of 600°C. Different trends were observed without a sorbent (Fig. 8b.), where both the H2 yield and H2 concentration were increased with increased gasification temperatures above 600°C. This is because almost all the reactions which produced H2 (Eqs. (5) and (6)) are endothermic. (5) C ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) ⇌ CO ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) (6) C H 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ⇌ C O ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) Accordingly, the higher H2 concentration and lower CO2 concentration obtained with WM 2:1 at the low gasification temperature (600°C) might be because the SEHP that exhibited a more dominant effect than the thermodynamic equilibrium at a low gasification temperature (Wei et al., 2014). Comparison of the XRD patterns between the fresh and used WM 2:1 sorbent is shown in Fig. 5b, where CaCO3 peaks were found in all the used samples. This confirmed that the CaO carbonation reaction took place during the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves, and so was likely to contribute to the SEHP effect on the pyrolysis-gasification via shifting the WGS equilibrium. Increasing the gasification temperature reduced the CaCO3 intensity peaks, supporting that the SEHP was mainly effective at a low temperature (600°C) because of its exothermic nature."
10,Conclusions,"Mixed CaO/MgO sorbents prepared by dry- and wet- physical mixing at different CaO: MgO molar ratios were studied in the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves for H2-rich gas production. A synergistic effect between CaO and MgO was observed at all molar ratios of the CaO/MgO mixed sorbents, and the highest H2 concentration (75.1%) and yield (21.3mmol/gbiomass), and the lowest CO2 concentration (7.73%), was found with the DM 2:1 sorbent. That the wet mixing method showed a higher H2 production yield (21.3mmol/gbiomass, 79.8%; WM 2:1) than the dry mixing method was because the Ca(OH)2 phases in the wet-mixed sorbents induced the SEHP. Moreover, it was found the different compositions in volatiles obviously influenced the SEHP. The devolatilization temperature of 600°C that produced the volatiles consisting mainly of oxygenated compounds gave the highest H2 yield. In addition, increasing the gasification temperature over 600°C was not preferable in terms of product H2 concentration although the H2 yield becomes higher."
