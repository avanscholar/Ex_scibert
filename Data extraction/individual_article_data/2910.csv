0,Introduction,"Depletion of non-renewable natural resources causes rapidly growing interest to their near-complete conversion with low-waste production that complies with green chemistry principles of material conversion and energy efficiency. According to knowledge of fossil fuels, coals and some heavy oil fractions mainly consist of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [1,2]. Many PAHs are known to possess a pronounced mutagenic and carcinogenic effect [3–5], as well as apparent geno- and embryotoxicity [6–8]. Since the reactivity of PAHs are significantly low due to a large number of conjugated and condensed aromatic rings [9–11], simple, cheap and convenient methods of their chemical conversion and detoxification are highly required. One of the effective chemical modifications can be partial or total PAHs hydrogenation, which allows liquefying fossil fuels [12,13], increasing the cetane number [14], enhancing the viscosity [15] or giving other benefits [11,16,17]. Thus, development of new effective synthetic methods of PAHs hydrogenation has a great commercial and ecological importance. In fact, catalyzed hydrogenation is a mostly used type of chemical modifications of PAHs and related compounds, these processes were studied in detail many times [18–20]. Among others, heterogeneous nickel-based catalysts have clear advantages because of enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity [21–23] together with moderate cost and high availability. Moreover, high catalytic activity of metal nickel nanoparticles in conventional hydrogenation of aromatic compounds is well-documented [24–27]. So, metal nickel particles supported on ZSM-5 catalyzed total hydrogenation of naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene at 180 °C [25]. Carbon-supported nickel was active enough in anthracene hydrogenation at 300 °C [26]. Raney® nickel is also used in conventional hydrogenation [24,28–30]. So, total hydrogenation of both naphthalene [24] and phenols of lignin [27] were successfully catalyzed. Moreover, Raney® nickel demonstrated high catalytic activity in transfer hydrogenation (TH) reaction intensively studied last few years [31–34]. The TH methodology is considered to be a real “green” alternative for canonic hydrogenation [35–38]. The catalyst was used in TH of multiple bonds CC [39,40], CO [34,39,40] and CN [41]. Isolated aromatic ring can also be successfully hydrogenated under the same catalytic conditions [31,39,42]. The reaction rate for hydrogenation of monoaromatic compounds increases at higher temperature. A structure–activity relationship study revealed a strong negative effect of electron-donating alkyl substituents. For example, 23 % and 92 % of benzene were hydrogenated to cyclohexane at 80 °C and 120 °C, respectively. At the same time, the conversion of toluene (methylbenzene) at 80 °C was two times lower than that of benzene and achieved only 12 % [39]. At the same time, the TH reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel can occur in a different way compared with the conventional hydrogenation catalyzed by the same catalyst [43]. Lower aliphatic alcohols are quite popular H-donors in TH [31,45–47] and considered to be a type of ""Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers"" [48], which are an interesting and very attractive class of clean energy sources (see, for example [49,50]). In contrast to other widespread H-donors (formic acid and its derivatives, hydrazine hydrate), alcohols do not change pH of reaction solution. Therefore, they can be used together with catalysts, which are sensitive to pH, in particular, Raney® nickel. Moreover, varying the alcohols can improves the final result of TH, even in non-catalytic reaction [45]. Secondary 2-PrOH usually demonstrates the better result as a H-donor than the primary alcohols [45], that was the reason to use 2-PrOH as a H-donor in this study. One of the earliest TH reaction of PAHs was published in 1944 by M. Orchin [51]. The reaction of anthracene was conducted in refluxing ethanol and catalyzed by Raney Ni resulted in 71 % yield of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroanthracene. Less-hydrogenated 9,10-dihydroanthracene was obtained by TH reaction in the presence of alkali (sole catalyst) either in 2-PrOH at 335 °C [52] or in MeOH at 400 °C [53], as well as by non-catalytic reaction in 2-PrOH at 410 °C [54]. Both SbCl3 [55] and tetraphenylporphyrin metal complexes [56] can also catalyzed the partial transfer hydrogenation of anthracene with moderate conversion and selectivity. Additionally, some TH reactions of phenanthrene and pyrene were studied earlier, in which BF3/SiO2 (or Al2O3) [57], superbasic K/MgO [58] or Ni-Mo/γ-Al2O3 [59] were used as catalysts. However, a very low yield of hydrogenated products was only achieved. Here, we report the catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bi- and trinuclear aromatic compounds (naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene) using 2-PrOH as a H-donor. Since the TH reaction of such condensed aromatic compounds catalyzed by Raney® nickel was poorly studied, especially in alcohols as an H-donor, the objective of this study is to verify that the combination “Raney® Ni – 2-PrOH” can be active and efficient for regioselective transfer hydrogenation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons into partially hydrogenated derivatives. The obtained results of TH are compared with the reaction of mononuclear benzene and biphenyl to evaluate the synthetic potential of the method."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and solvents,"2.1 Chemicals and solvents All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received: 2-propanol (≥ 99.5 %, Sigma–Aldrich), benzene (≥ 99 %, Sigma–Aldrich), biphenyl (≥ 99 %, Sigma–Aldrich), naphthalene (99 %, Sigma–Aldrich), anthracene (≥ 99 %, Sigma–Aldrich), phenanthrene (98 %, Sigma–Aldrich), sulfolane (99 %, Aldrich), decane (≥ 95 %, Aldrich), aluminum–nickel alloy (Al–Ni 50:50 wt %, Sigma–Aldrich), NaOH (≥ 97 %, Sigma–Aldrich)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Raney® nickel was prepared according to well-known leaching method from aluminum–nickel alloy [60]. The alloy (0.450 g) was added portion-wise to 5.6 mL 20 % aq. NaOH (a solution of 16.30 g of NaOH in 58.0 mL of distilled water) under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The temperature was kept at about 50 °C. After adding the total amount of the alloy (10–15 min), the mixture was stirred for 50–55 min at 50 °C until the H2 evolution stopped. The skeletal nickel obtained was washed out with distilled water (4 × 50 mL) till neutral pH and then additionally stirred with extra portion of distilled water (15 mL) for 2.5 h. Water was decanted away and 2-PrOH was added portion-wise (4 × 50 mL) to remote residual water from prepared Raney® nickel. The prepared leached nickel was pyrophoric enough and usually used immediately after preparation. The catalyst was characterized by BET, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses. The properties of the prepared Raney® nickel were very similar to literature data (see Supplementary Materials)."

After adding the catalyst prepared from 0.45 g of aluminum–nickel alloy, the reactor was purged with argon under stirring then closed, and heated up with the rate of ∼7 °C/min to reach the reaction temperature of 150 ± 1 °C. The reaction was carried out at constant temperature of 150 °C during 5 h with permanent stirring at 800 rpm. During the reaction, probes of the reaction mixture were collected hourly to the sampler. The final reaction mixture and all other probes were analyzed by GC–MS method."

After adding the catalyst prepared from 0.45 g of aluminum–nickel alloy, the reactor was purged with argon under stirring and heated under reflux for 5 h (82 °C).

6,GC–MS analysis,"2.5 GC–MS analysis The identification of the products was performed by GC–MS method on a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010-SE (Japan) equipped with autosampler. A 30 m-long quartz capillary column VF-5 ms with 0.25 mm i.d. was used for the analysis; the film thickness of the stationary phase (5% diphenylsiloxane – 95 % dimethylsiloxane copolymer) was 0.25 μm; helium was as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1; a split ratio was 1:25; the injector temperature was 270 °C; the temperature program was 1 min at 50 °C, 50–270 °C (10 °C min−1), and 270 °C (20 min). The qualitative analysis was carried out by comparing the retention time of the components and their experimental mass spectra with the corresponding data for the pure compounds or with the data from the NIST11 and Wiley9 mass spectral libraries. Sulfolane or decane was used as an internal standard for the quantitative assessment of the products."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Raney® nickel was prepared according to well-known leaching method [60]. The freshly prepared catalyst and the initial Ni–Al alloy were characterized by BET, XRD, XPS, XRF and TEM methods. According to XRD data, the initial alloy mostly contains Al3Ni and Al3Ni2 phases (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials), which transform to metallic Ni phase during the catalyst preparation. The alloy has low specific surface area equal to ∼ 1–5 m2/g, which significantly increased to 60–80 m2/g for freshly prepared Raney® nickel. TEM shows sponge-like structure of the freshly prepared catalyst with many branched mesoporous channels (Fig. 1 ). This information correlates with data published earlier [61,62]. The prepared Raney® nickel contains 86.5 % of Ni and 10.3 % of residual Al. The last 3.2 % is obviously oxygen (XRF). Raney® nickel is known to be quite pyrophoric and highly sensitive to oxygen-presence condition that produce many difficulties to handle [63]. Therefore, the metal surface of Raney® nickel prepared under air atmosphere is partially covered by oxygen atoms. It is confirmed by XPS analysis: Al0/Al3+ and Ni0/Ni2+ ratios in our Raney® nickel catalyst are about 0.25 and 5.0, correspondingly (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials). Thus, measured physicochemical properties of the catalyst used are rather canonic and highly correlated with literature data [60,62,63]."
9,Hydrogenative dearomatization under TH conditions,"3.2 Hydrogenative dearomatization under TH conditions Five model aromatic hydrocarbons are studied in transfer hydrogenation by 2-propanol as a H-donor: mononuclear benzene and biphenyl, binuclear naphthalene, as well as three-nuclear anthracene and phenanthrene. Two variations of the reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel are used: i) in autoclave stainless steel reactor at 150 °C and 11 atm (self-pressure of 2-propanol); and ii) in glass reactor at 82 °C and ambient atmosphere (boiling point of 2-propanol). The reactivity of aromatic cores under TH conditions is known to be rather low [39,43,64]. For this reason, elevated 150 °C is chosen for the reaction. Further increasing the reaction temperature is undesirable and even ""harmful"" because of rapidly decreasing the activity of the catalyst due to structural changes in crystallite size, lattice distortion, pore structure, and specific surface area [63]. But carrying out the PAHs reduction in standard laboratory glassware would be highly desirable, convenient and useful. Thus, boiling 2-propanol under atmospheric pressure is used as an alternative reaction medium. All reactions were carried out in the same manner to each other under oxygen-free conditions to avoid the oxidative deactivation of the pyrophoric catalyst and repeated twice. Probes of each reaction mixture were collected hourly (sometimes half-hourly) starting from zero reaction time at which the reaction mixture reached the reaction temperature after heating. The molar catalyst-to-substrate ratio was always ∼ 1.2/1 in the reaction mixtures and not optimized. All observed transformations are shown in Scheme 1 . 3.2.1 Benzene and biphenyl hydrogenation After 5 h of the reaction at 150 °C, benzene achieves ∼ 100 % conversion (dashed black line, Fig. 2 ) and cyclohexane is the only product. This result is in good accordance with known TH data for 3 h of the reaction at 120 °C [39] and used as a reference point in our study. As expected, the reactivity of benzene at 82 °C is significantly lower: only 22 % of benzene are transformed into cyclohexane for 5 h of the reaction. Unfortunately, these results of TH reaction are hard to compare with conventional hydrogenation, in which H2 pressure is known to influence strongly the benzene conversion. In particular, > 99 % conversion for 2 h at 120 °C is achieved in canonic hydrogenation catalyzed by Raney nickel foam, if H2 pressure is 59.2 atm [65]. But two-fold decrease of the pressure to 27.6 atm gives only 84 % of benzene conversion for 8 h at 150 °C [66]. So, our results of the TH reaction are comparable to these ones. The hydrogenation of biphenyl is also sensitive to the reaction temperature. The dearomatization and total reduction of the first aromatic ring proceeds faster compared with the second one: at 82 °C, 91 % conversion with 100 % selectivity on cyclohexylbenzene is reached for 5 h of the reaction (solid red line, Fig. 3 ). Increasing the reaction time to 6 h gives almost quantitative yield of cyclohexylbenzene – 97 % conversion at 100 % selectivity (this point is absent in Fig. 3). Interestingly, the second aromatic ring of byphenyl molecule was unreactive at 82 °C and dicyclohexyl was not found in any reaction mixtures. In contrast, 100 % conversion at 150 °C is already achieved for 1 h of the reaction. The same 91 % yield of cyclohexylbenzene is observed for 0.5 h and then decreased to 58 % for 5 h of the reaction (dashed red line, Fig. 3). At the same time, the concentration of fully hydrogenated dicyclohexyl (dashed blue line, Fig. 3) is continuously increasing up to 42 % at the end of the reaction tending towards higher level. Thus, the binary system “Raney® nickel/2-PrOH” demonstrates high enough activity and regioselectivity on the partial reduction of biphenyl which is known to be an important structural moiety of a wide range of biologically active compounds [67,68] as well as a high reactive intermediate in fine organic chemistry [69,70]. 3.2.2 Naphthalene hydrogenation The reaction of naphthalene at 150 °C results in high-selective tetralin formation (dashed green line, Fig. 4 ): 96 % at 100 % conversion of naphthalene for 1 h of the reaction. Then the tetralin concentration is weakly decreasing to 92 % at the end of the reaction due to its further hydrogenation into fully hydrogenated cis-/trans-decalins (dashed blue lines, Fig. 4). The only octahydronaphthalene ocNa as an intermediate is detected in trace amount (dashed red line, Fig. 4) and there are no other partially or fully hydrogenated products in the reaction mixture. Decreasing the reaction temperature to 82 °C expectedly provides lower naphthalene conversion, but with excellent selectivity: for 3 h of the reaction, 100 % selectivity (solid green line, Fig. 4) was achieved at 100 % naphthalene conversion without any other products formation. Interestingly, tetralin itself has many practically important applications as a good hydrogen-rich (or H-donor) solvent in TH processes [71–76] as well as in the fuel cells [77]. Conventional hydrogenation of naphthalene into tetralin catalyzed by Raney nickel can give good result too, for example 75 % yield for 5 min at 150 °C, 49.3 atm of H2 pressure and 10 mol.% of catalyst load [78]. Increasing the catalyst loading to 340 mol.% provides excellent yield of tetralin (99.5 %) for 2.5 h of the hydrogenation, at 45 °C and 29.6 atm of H2 pressure [79]. In our opinion, the result of TH observed at 82 °C and 120 mol.% of Raney nickel loading and without H2 is more attractive bearing in mind known shortcomings and drawbacks of molecular H2. Taking into account both the equal concentration of each of the model compounds in 2-propanol and the equal amount of Raney nickel used, the rate of their conversion at 82 °C may be presented as naphthalene > biphenyl > benzene. At first glance, possible anthracene or phenanthrene reactivity under the same reaction conditions seems to be good predictable within the dependence. 3.2.3 Anthracene hydrogenation In fact, the selective reduction of anthracene under chosen TH conditions is more complicated due to similar reactivity of its partially hydrogenated intermediates towards further hydrogenation. At 150 °C, 100 % conversion is already achieved for 1 h of the reaction and this result is in good accordance with the above-mentioned prediction. The main product is octahydrogenated ocAn-1 (dashed red line, Fig. 5 ), not dihydrogenated diAn (dashed violet line) or tetrahydrogenated tetAn (dashed green line), which formation as intermediates were also observed in the reaction mixtures. The yield of ocAn-1 is 75 % for 1 h of the reaction, which is weakly increasing to 85 % after 5 h due to further hydrogenation of the di- or tetrahydrogenated intermediates as well as parallel prototropic isomerization (tautomerization) of ocAn-2 (dashed blue line, Fig. 5). The last compound is one more isomer of octahydroanthracene formed during the anthracene hydrogenation. This kind of isomerization catalyzed by Raney nickel is known for some heteroaromatic hydrocarbons [80]. It is known that partial hydrogenation of edible fatty oils catalyzed by Raney nickel is always accompanied by cis-/trans-isomerization of polyunsaturated fatty acids [81] and the isomerization process involves a reverse transfer of allylic hydrogen atom from the acid molecule to the catalyst surface and back to the isomerized fatty acid. Thus, under the TH conditions with Raney nickel catalyst, all octahydroanthracenes have to undergo the mutual isomerization resulted in predominant formation of ocAn-1 as a thermodynamically favorable isomer. A good yield of both dihydrogenated diAn (solid violet line, Fig. 5) and tetrahydrogenated tetAn (solid green line, Fig. 5) can be obtained by decreasing the reaction temperature. So, at 82 °C, ∼ 100 % conversion is only achieved at the end of the process (for 5 h). Max concentration of diAn is 57 % (for 1 h) at 60 % product selectivity. Then diAn is further reduced into tetAn (main “beneficiary”) and more hydrogenated products. The yield of tetAn increased to 77 % at the end of the reaction (solid green line, Fig. 5), while the total concentration of all isomeric octahydroanthracenes does not exceed 20 %. Thus, upon lowering the temperature from 150 °C to 82 °C, significant increase of both diAn and tetAn yields as well as the products selectivity can be achieved. Our results demonstrate that the last aromatic ring of octahydroanthracenes is quite stable under chosen reaction conditions: no products of the total dearomatization are observed in the reaction mixtures after 5 h at 150 °C. Moreover, the additional TH reaction of anthracene for 24 h at 150 °C results in only 3% yield of perhydroanthracenes (these data are absent in Fig. 6 ). The isomerization rate of octahydroanthracenes is low too under these TH conditions: after 24 h of the reaction, the ratio “ocAn-1/(ocAn-2 + ocAn-3)” is quite the same than that after 5 h (86/10 and 84/16, respectively). Thus, there is no reason to increase the reaction time to obtain perhydroanthracenes because of low catalytic activity of Raney® nickel in both total hydrogenation and prototropic isomerization of octahydroanthracenes. To compare our results with literature data on TH reaction of anthracene in refluxing EtOH [51] and to evaluate different H-donor, we carried out the same reaction in EtOH (78 °C instead of 82 °C in refluxing 2-PrOH). But amount of Raney nickel used in our study was 32-fold decreased as compared with original paper [51] (experimental details can be found in Supplementary Materials). The substitution of H-donor and the decrease of ratio “metal Ni/anthracene” had crucial effect: only ∼ 1 % conversion was observed under the reaction conditions. We confirmed that 2-PrOH as a H-donor is much better than EtOH. 3.2.4 Phenanthrene hydrogenation The phenanthrene conversion at 82 °C (black solid line, Fig. 6) is quite similar to that of biphenyl (cf. Fig. 3): 88 % vs. 91 %, correspondingly, at the end of the reaction. The main products are di- and tetrahydrogenated phenanthrenes, which yields are very close to each other during all 5 h of the reaction and achieve 34 % vs. 39 %, correspondingly, at the end. If the reaction temperature is elevated up to 150 °C, the 100 % conversion is expected to achieve rapidly – for 1 h of the reaction. At this point, the main product is octahydrogenated ocPhe-1 (78 %), which concentration is weakly increasing to 85 % at the end of the reaction. Interestingly, the total yield of octahydrophenanthrenes after 5 h of the reaction at 150 °C (99.8 %) is quite similar to that of octahydroanthracenes. The ratio “ocPhe-1/(ocPhe-2 + ocPhe-3)” is also the same (85.3/14.5). Thus, the last aromatic ring of octahydro derivatives of both anthracene and phenanthrene is stable under chosen TH conditions at 150 °C. The last conclusion does not cancel out the experimental fact that anthracene is more active under the TH conditions – 77 % conversion vs. 20 % of the phenanthrene conversion for zero time point, respectively. Similar results are observed in conventional hydrogenation of anthracene and phenanthrene catalyzed by Ni/ZSM-5 [25] or other catalysts [82], which can be interpreted in terms of superdelocalizability and resonance energy [82]. To summarize, compare and contrast our main results to known literature data, Table 1 is presented. In the table, one can see the crucial reaction conditions of conventional hydrogenation and TH reaction of aromatics studied. The yield of main product obtained under these conditions is given too. Runs ##1, 3, 8, 13, and 15 are conventional hydrogenation, the other ones are TH reactions. The crucial parameters are the molar ratio “metal Ni/substrate” and the reaction temperature: the higher the ratio and/or the temperature, the higher the yield of target product. For example, runs #10 and #11 are focused on the effect of the catalyst amount. Runs #11 and #12 emphasize the different donor ability of alcohols (2-PrOH is much better than EtOH). In general, the combination “Raney® Ni – 2-PrOH” demonstrates a high and reliable efficiency in course of partial and high-selective hydrogenation of condensed aromatics as compared with conventional hydrogenation."
10,Conclusions,"The binary reaction system “Raney® Ni – 2-PrOH” has a high synthetic potential for the TH reaction of mono-, di- and trinuclear aromatic compounds. The reactivity of tested aromatics can be listed as follows: At 82 °C: An > Na > Phe ≈ biPhe > benzene At 150 °C: An > biPhe > Na ≈ Phe ≈ benzene The main products formed from di- and trinuclear aromatics at both 82 °C and 150 °C were partially hydrogenated derivatives – tetralin and octahydro-anthracenes/-phenanthrenes. Very high selectivity of TH (≥ 98 %) was achieved for 5 h of the reaction of naphthalene and biphenyl at 82 °C. The above-mentioned partially hydrogenated aromatics are quite stable under chosen reaction conditions and not subjected to further hydrogenation during 5 h of TH process. To achieve the total hydrogenation of the PAHs, more active catalyst/H-donor and/or severe reaction conditions are required. The main advantages of the synthetic process considered are the highly selective partial hydrogenation/dearomatization of aromatics, good reproducibility and repeatability, safe and easy-to-handle procedure, mild reaction conditions those provide a high synthetic potential of TH methodology in laboratory practice and industrial application."
