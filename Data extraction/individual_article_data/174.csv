0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the most common water-soluble polymers hydrolyzed from polyvinyl acetate. Due to its good water solubility, it is widely used in the chemical industry, papermaking and textile industry for thickening, emulsification, paper coating and warp sizing [1]. About 750000-tons PVA is produced annually throughout the world. Nevertheless, most microorganisms are difficult to degrade a large number of PVA molecules. So, a large amount of PVA discharged from industrial wastewater could be found in the natural environment, which increases the viscosity of water [2]. Moreover, PVA can also lead to the release of harmful heavy metals from sediments [3]. Hence, proposing a convenient and cheap degradation method for PVA fabric wastewater has an important practical significance. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as ozone catalytic oxidation [4], photocatalytic oxidation [5,6], ultrasonic [7] and Fenton reaction [8], have attracted wide attention in the field of organic matter degradation [9]. Among these AOPs technologies, the Fenton reaction has always attracted people's interest due to its low cost, high efficiency and mildness [10,11]. The Heterogeneous Fenton reaction uses a solid catalyst to replace Fe2+ in the Fenton reagent to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 into highly active and non-selective OH ∙ , thereby degrading organic pollutants [12–14]. Generally, iron-based materials, such as nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI), Cu-Fe oxide, modified steel converter slag and Fe-Mn oxide, have been considered as heterogeneous catalysts [15–18]. Recently, manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4), as a familiar soft magnetic iron-containing material, has shown excellent chemical stability and catalytic performance in the catalytic ozone oxidation and persulfate oxidation treatment of wastewater [14,19,20]. Nevertheless, nano-MnFe2O4 is very easy to agglomerate, so that its specific surface area and active sites are significantly reduced [21]. Thus, in order to prevent the agglomeration of MnFe2O4 nanoparticles, the methods of preparing the porous catalyst and anchoring nanoparticles on the substrate were studied. For example, Qin et al. used glucose and ammonia as carbon source and nitrogen source to fabricate amino-modified MnFe2O4@C composites for H2O2 activation [9]. Huang et al. doped Mn into magnetic biochar (MMBC) to activate persulfate for the tetracycline (TC) degradation [22]. Yue et al. immobilized MnFe2O4 on g-C3N4 and used for peroxymonosulfate to degrade triclosan (TCS) [23]. However, the large consumption and high cost of supporting materials limited its development in industrialization. Therefore, it is particularly important for preparing cheap and highly dispersed MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Natural clays have been widely used due to their easy recycling, rich resources, low cost, large adsorption capacity, good thermal stability and chemical stability [24]. Kaolinite is a kind of natural clay with a two-dimensional layered structure, abundant aluminum hydroxyl groups and a permanent negative charge (Fig. 1 (a)) [25,26]. The two-dimensional layered structure is an appropriate platform to graft the Fe-Mn bimetal oxide nanoparticles [21]. A large number of aluminum hydroxyl groups and permanent negative charges inhibited the crystallization of Fe-Mn bimetal oxide nanoparticles on the kaolinite surface to prevent their self-aggregation [27]. Taking these factors into consideration, anchoring Fe-Mn bimetal oxide nanoparticles on the kaolinite surface may become a cost-effective H2O2 catalyst to degrade organic pollutants. In this study, IM@K was prepared by anchoring Fe-Mn bimetal oxide nanoparticles on natural kaolinite, and the performance of its catalytic degradation of PVA solution by H2O2 was evaluated. The morphology, specific surface area, pore structure and surface chemical states of kaolinite, bare MnFe2O4 and IM@k were comprehensively compared. The main impact of temperature, initial pH, catalyst dosage, H2O2 dosage, and the effects of cation ions and anion ions on PVA degradation were discussed. Moreover, based on the results of quenching experiments, EPR and XPS, the potential reaction mechanism of IM@k catalyst activation H2O2 was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Natural kaolinite was produced in Tangshan, China. PVA knitted fabric was supplied by Yongan Baohualin Industrial Development Co., Ltd. Manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O), Anhydrous iron sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3), Ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), Manganous nitrate Mn(NO3)2, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), Methanol (MeOH), odine (I, 99.9%), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), potassium iodide (KI, 99.5%), and sodium azide (NaN3) were from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of metal doped kaolinite,"2.2 Preparation of metal doped kaolinite The catalyst of nanosized mesoporous iron-manganese bimetal oxides anchored on natural kaolinite (Nanosized-IM@k) was produced. 0.25 mol/L MnSO4·H2O and 0.125 mol/L Fe2(SO4)3 were added into 250 mL DI water. After dissolution, 5 g of kaolinite was added, and magnetic stirring was conducted for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained solid substances were then filtered with 0.45 μm membrane and washed repeatedly with ultrapure water. Then it was dried at 90 °C for 12 h. In the end, the dry powders were calcined at 450 °C for 3 h. The 4.04 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and the 1.16 mL Mn(NO3)2 solution were dissolved in a beaker with as little water as possible, followed by adding 2.3536 g of citric acid (CA). CA-nitrate solution was obtained after complete dissolution of CA. Then 0.8766 g of NaCl (the ratio of NaCl to metal ion substance is 1:1) was added into the CA-nitrate solution. After complete dissolution, the solution pH was adjusted to 7.0 with ammonia water to obtain the precursor solution. The precursor solution was placed in a muff furnace preheated to 300 °C for 1 h, and the fluffy product MnFe2O4 was obtained after complete combustion. The product was grinded and washed at least 3 times with ultrapure water, and then dried in 80 °C for 8 h. Finally, the required MnFe2O4 powder was grinded and recovered after complete drying."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure 1 g of the PVA knitted fabric was dissolved in 100 mL of ultrapure water and stirred at 95 °C for 1 h. And the pH value was controlled by hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. During degradation experiment, a certain dose of nanosized-IM@k catalyst was firstly added into the 100 mL PVA solution. The whole mixture was mixed with 30 min till the desorption/adsorption equilibrium was reached between the PVA and catalyst. Then, a certain amount of H2O2 added into mixture. The whole experiment was conducted at 80 °C. The main impacts of H2O2 dosage, catalyst dosage, initial pH and temperature of the degradation efficiency was studied. Then, the superiority of the IM@k/H2O2 system was tested. All degradation experiments were repeated three times."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The microstructure was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (su1510, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan). The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken by Tecnai G2 F20 FE-TEM (200 kV). XRD (Bruker, D2 PHASER) was utilized to study the crystal structure. Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) method was used to compute the surface area, pore distribution and volume. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos analysis, UK) was applied to determine the chemical states of elements surface. The concentration and molecular weight of the degraded PVA fabric solution were measured by the UV–VIS spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-630) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. The PVA degradation efficiency (E) was calculated by the following equation: (1) E % = C 0 - C C 0 × 100 % where C0 and C are the concentrations of PVA initially and at time t. The PVA degradation kinetics complies with a pseudo-first-order rate law, as follows. (2) I n C 0 C ) = k t where the k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant and t is the time of reaction."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization From Fig. 1(b), the crystalline phases of kaolinite, bare MnFe2O4, fresh IM@K and used IM@K catalyst were compared by XRD. The diffraction peaks of kaolinite were at 12.45°, 23.76°, 38.51° and 62.36° [28]. The diffraction peaks of bare MnFe2O4 are 17.94°, 29.30°, 35.20°, 42.86°, 56.64° and 62.12°, which are well matched with MnFe2O4 without impurity peaks, indicating that the bare MnFe2O4 has great crystallinity [29,30]. For IM@K, both typical characteristic peaks of kaolinite and MnFe2O4 were observed, manifesting that MnFe2O4 was successfully anchored on natural kaolinite. However, compared with MnFe2O4, the peak of IM@K was weaker and narrower, illustrating that the crystallinity of IM@K is not as good as that of bare MnFe2O4. Moreover, there was no obvious change in the IM@K catalyst before and after the reaction. The pore structure of heterogeneous catalysts is an important factor that affects the number of active sites and adsorption capacity, and played a critical role in the pollutants degradation [21]. As shown in Fig. 1(c–d), the porous structure of kaolinite, bare MnFe2O4 and IM@K catalysts was determined by using the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. The isotherms of MnFe2O4, kaolinite and IM@K exhibit type IV isotherm with a type H2 hysteresis loop, which indicated that the samples are typical mesoporous materials [31]. Compared with kaolinite and bare MnFe2O4, IM@K catalyst has the largest specific surface area, largest pore volume, and smallest pore size. It is because MnFe2O4 was uniformly distributed on the kaolinite microchips with a smaller particle size and a larger exposed area, which is conducive to generating more active sites. The results of SEM and TEM can also be proved. The morphologies and microstructures of kaolinite, bare MnFe2O4, fresh IM@K and used IM@K were characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 (a–b), the superimposed kaolinite flakes with smooth and clear edges can be seen. This layered structure is beneficial for MnFe2O4 nanoparticles to be uniformly and stably anchored on kaolinite during the preparation process. It can be seen from Fig. 2(c–d) that the bare MnFe2O4 particles produced by the sol–gel combustion process had severe agglomeration. Different from the kaolinite, the TEM and SEM images of IM@K showed obvious rough surface, which is formed by the ordered MnFe2O4 grafted on the kaolinite (Fig. 2e and f). Moreover, the grain size of MnFe2O4 in IM@K was much smaller than that of bare MnFe2O4, revealing that kaolinite containing a large amount of hydrophilic aluminum hydroxyl groups can hinder the long-range ordered unidirectional crystallization of MnFe2O4. Besides, from Fig. 1(i–n)), the EDS mapping showed the uniform distribution of Al, Fe, Mn, O, and Si elements, indicating that MnFe2O4 was evenly anchored on kaolinite. The morphology of used IM@K kept stable as indicated in Fig. 2(g–h). SEM and TEM images of used IM@K was very similar to that of fresh IM@K, further demonstrating that the strong stability of kaolinite in activating H2O2. XPS was used to study the element composites and chemical state of bare MnFe2O4 and IM@k. The XPS spectrum and the fitting results are displayed in Fig. 3 (a–d). Fig. 3(a) displayed the full-scale XPS spectrum of Mn2FeO4 and IM@k. In the O1 s spectrum of bare MnFe2O4, the peaks at 529.8 eV and 531.2 eV are assigned to lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl groups, respectively (Fig. 3b) [32]. For the O1s of IM@k, the slight shift of the lattice oxygen peak may be owing to the formation of new bonds between Fe-Mn bimetal oxide and kaolinite. And, the higher peak intensity of the hydroxyl group of IM@k is due to the introduction of hydroxyl-rich kaolinite. A large number of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface can accelerate the uniform dispersion of the catalyst in the aqueous solution, and further increase the number of reaction sites, thereby improving the degradation efficiency of PVA. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl on the kaolinite surface can also activate H2O2 to produce radical as shown in previous research [25]. The peaks of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 for pure MnFe2O4 were at 642.4 eV and 654.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 3c). In addition, for Mn 2p spectrum of IM@k, there were two peaks at binding energies of 642.5 eV for Mn 2p3/2 and 654.4 eV for Mn 2p1/2, proving the presence of Mn (II) on catalyst surface [33]. It can be seen from Fig. 3(d) that as MnFe2O4 nanoparticles are anchored on kaolinite, a slight shift to higher binding energy could be seen in the Fe 2p spectrum. The results showed that the formation of Fe-O-Al bond was beneficial to the reusability and stability of MnFe2O4."
8,Radicals analysis in IM@K/H2O2 system,"3.2 Radicals analysis in IM@K/H2O2 system Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the H2O2 based AOPs generally include OH ∙ , superoxide radical ( O 2 ∙ - ) and singlet oxygen (1O2) [34]. In order to reveal its activation mechanism, we conducted a series of quenching experiments to identify the dominant ROS in the IM@k/H2O2 system. In this research, TBA was conducted as OH ∙ scavenger, BQ was served as O 2 ∙ - scavenger and NaN3 was chosen as 1O2 scavenger [34–36]. Fig. 4 (a) showed that the PVA degradation rate could reach 94.4%% in 480 min when no quenching agents are added. Meanwhile, the addition of BQ reduced the degradation rate of PVA slightly, indicating that O 2 ∙ - played a secondary role in the PVA degradation. The effect of NaN3 (10 mm) as a 1O2 quenching agent was also evaluated. The PVA degradation rate was deeply inhibited from 94.4% to 21.3% in the existence of NaN3 and the corresponding value k dropped to 0.0032 min−1, demonstrating that 1O2 played more important role than O 2 ∙ - in the IM@k/H2O2 system. On the other hand, TBA had a significant inactivation effect on IM@k/H2O2 system. The degradation rate declined from 94.4% to 17.6% in the presence of 10 mM of TBA and the corresponding value k decreased to 0.0004 min−1, which demonstrated the crucial role of OH ∙ in the catalytic degradation process. It is speculated that if radicals can be directly detected, it will further consolidate OH ∙ , O 2 ∙ - and 1O2 as ROS in the IM@k/H2O2 process. The EPR/DMPO and EPR/TEMP experiments further confirmed the existence and contribution of these radicals in the degradation process. It can be seen from Fig. 4(c) that no peak was found in the H2O2/DMPO system, indicating that without a catalyst, H2O2 cannot generate radicals alone. The peaks of DMPO- OH ∙ adducts could be inferred that OH ∙ was generated by H2O2 through strong hydrolysis reactions. From Fig. 6 (d–e), the special spectrum of the quadruple signal with an intensity ratio of 1:1:1:1 could be clearly observed, which was attributed to the characteristics of the DMPO- O 2 ∙ - adduct [1]. Furthermore, a 1:1:1 triplet signal characteristic of TEMP-1O2 was detected [37], indicating that 1O2 also contributed to the PVA degradation."
9,Control experiment,"3.3 Control experiment Fig. 5 showed the degradation of PVA under different reaction systems. For systems in presence of only catalyst or H2O2, almost no PVA was removed during the reactions. The results indicated that the catalyst was ineffective to adsorb macromolecular PVA, and non-activated H2O2 has a low oxidation capacity. When kaolinite was used to activate H2O2, the molecular weight of degraded PVA was 24528. Adding bare MnFe2O4 to catalyze H2O2, PVA was degraded rapidly, and in the kaolinite/MnFe2O4/H2O2 system, the degradation efficiency of PVA was slightly improved and the difference was not significant. Interestingly, in the case of IM@K, the even faster degradation rate was observed. In addition, the pseudo-first-order dynamics model shown in Fig. 5(b) could fit the degradation of the PVA data of various systems. The reaction rate constants (k) of kaolinite, bare MnFe2O4, kaolinite/MnFe2O4 and IM@K were 0.00094, 0.0032, 0.0035 and 0.006 min−1, respectively, implying that iron manganese bimetal oxides in IM@K played a leading role in the H2O2 activation. In order to further prove that the IM@K/H2O2 system was superior to the other systems, the mineralization rate of PVA under each system was tested (Fig. 5(d)). Under the IM@K/H2O2 system, the PVA mineralization rate can reach about 84.1% at 480 min. On the contrary, the PVA mineralization rates were low or negligible in other systems at 480 min. These results prove that the effectiveness of IM@K/H2O2 system in PVA degradation. The reasons why IM@K had better catalytic efficiency for H2O2 activation than MnFe2O4 and kaolinite/MnFe2O4 are as follows: (a) the higher specific surface area and larger pore volume of IM@K increased the number of active sites; (b) the abundant hydroxyl in kaolinite not only help the decomposition of H2O2, but also accelerated the dispersion of the catalyst in the PVA solution to increase the probability of contact between the catalyst and PVA; (c) the uniform immobilization of Fe-Mn bimetal oxide nanoparticles on the kaolinite surface increased the active sites."
10,"Influence of temperature, H2O2 dosage, catalyst dosage and pH","3.4 Influence of temperature, H2O2 dosage, catalyst dosage and pH 3.4.1 Influence of temperature Fig. 6(a–c) showed that the decomposition rate of PVA changed with the environmental temperature. The degradation efficiency of PVA reached the highest point at 50 °C because the decomposition efficiency of PVA reached 94.4% and the corresponding molecular weight was minimized in 480 min. Interestingly, the degradation rate of PVA showed positive dependence before and after 50°reaction. In the range of 20–40 °C, the PVA degradation efficiency had a significant positive correlation with temperature. At 20 °C, the concentration of degraded PVA solution was 62.8% in 480 min, and under the condition of 30°C, it only takes 160 min. When the temperature increased to 40 °C, the PVA solution could be removed by 51.5% within 480 min only. And, the increasing degradation rate constant (k) is 0.00097 min-1 at 20 °C, 0.00125 min−1 at 30 °C, and 0.0015 min−1 at 40 °C. This is because high temperature caused the decomposition rate of H2O2 to accelerate, and producing more radicals, thus improving the degradation efficiency [38]. Meanwhile, as the temperature increased, the overall degradation efficiency increased between 60 and 90 °C. Generally, the like-Fenton reaction speeds up with the increase of temperature, the increase of temperature will accelerate the formation rate of OH ∙ , which is conducive to the reaction of OH ∙ with organic matter and improved the oxidation effect [39]. Nevertheless, for such a complex reaction system as IM@K/H2O2 system, temperature rise would accelerate both the forward reaction and the side reaction [40]. At temperatures above 50 °C, the chemical reaction rate of self-consuming reaction between oxidants was also improved when the reaction temperature was increased, which could accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O (Eqs. (3)–(6)). In addition, the Fe2+ on IM@K catalysts surface would be oxidized to Fe3+ at the higher temperature, which could cause the lower OH ∙ production. Therefore, the value k is bigger at 50°than high and low temperatures [39–41]. (3) OH . + OH . → H 2 O 2 (4) OH . + H 2 O 2 → HO 2 . + H 2 O (5) OH . + HO 2 . → O 2 + H 2 O (6) 2 H 2 O 2 → O 2 + 2 H 2 O 3.4.2 Influence of H2O2 concentration As shown in Fig. 6(d–f), the influence of H2O2 concentrations from 20 to 300 mM were explored in IM@K/H2O2 system. As the concentration of H2O2 increased from 20 to 150 mM, the concentration of PVA quickly dropped from 34.6% to 5.6%. Higher H2O2 concentration can produced more active free radicals, which was more conducive to the degradation of PVA. However, when the concentration of added H2O2 increased from 150 to 300 mM, the PVA concentration increased from 5.6% to 19.2%. This is because excessive H2O2 has a strong scavenging effect on radicals and Fe3+ on the catalyst surface (Eq. (7)–(9)) [42]. The oxidation potential of the generated H O 2 ∙ and O 2 ∙ - is much lower than that of the OH ∙ , thereby inhibiting the removal of PVA [43]. (7) Fe 3 + + H 2 O 2 → Fe 2 + + H O 2 ∙ (8) OH ∙ + H 2 O 2 → H O 2 ∙ + H 2 O (9) H O 2 ∙ ↔ O 2 - + H + 3.4.3 Influence of IM@K dosage In order to select the optimum IM@K dosage, the effect of different initial IM@K dosage on the PVA degradation efficiency was studied. As seen in Fig. 6(g–i), as the catalyst dosage increased from 0.5 g/L to 4 g/L, the concentration of PVA increased from 5.6% to 45.4% within 480 min. Meanwhile, the molecular weight of degraded PVA was also the lowest when the IM@K dosage was 0.5 g/L. When the catalyst dosage was increased continuously, the PVA degradation efficiency was not significantly improved. The reason may be that excessive IM@K decreased the density of adsorbed H2O2 on the surface, and reduced the concentration of OH ∙ on the inter-surface between solid and liquid [18]. When IM@K dosage increased to 2.5 g/L, OH ∙ showed a scavenging effect because the catalyst was too much (Eqs. (10)–(11)). In addition, some studies have shown that the iron surface can lead to the undesirable consumption of free radicals (such as H O 2 ∙ and OH ∙ ) through the Eqs. (10) and (12). Hence, 0.5 g/L was the optimal IM@K dosage. (10) Fe 2 + + OH ∙ → Fe 3 + + OH - (11) Mn 2 + + OH ∙ → Mn 3 + + OH - (12) Fe 3 + + H O 2 ∙ → Fe 2 + + H O 2 - 3.4.4 Influence of initial pH In the IM@K/H2O2 system, the pH value of the solution played an important role in the PVA removal because it affected the generation of radicals. As seen from Fig. 6(j–i), the PVA concentrations were degraded to 21.4%, 5.6%, 16.1% and 17.1% and the corresponding value K were 0.0032, 0.006, 0.0038 and 0.0036 under the initial pH of 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Meanwhile, when the initial pH value was 3, the molecular weight of degraded PVA was the lowest. The experimental results showed that the solution with a pH of 3 had the lowest efficiency, which was different from the idea of former research [44]. In order to further explain the relatively low degradation efficiency of PVA under acidic conditions, the change of the pH value of the solution during the reaction under different initial pH conditions was studied. It can be seen from Fig. 6(m) that when the initial pH was 3, 5, 7 and 9, the pH of the solution decreased rapidly after the degradation of the IM@K/H2O2 system, which was 2.26, 3.35, 3.44, and 7.24, respectively, and then just changed slightly. The decrease in pH of the solution may be related to the acidic intermediates produced during the PVA degradation process. In a lower acidic environment, the formation of Fe ( H 2 O ) 3 6 + inhibited the reaction of H2O2 with the catalyst, causing the less production of OH ∙ , which may be the reason for the low PVA efficiency at initial pH of 3 [45]. When the initial pH value was 9, the PVA degradation rate was slower because the ability of H2O2 to generate OH ∙ was gradually restricted, and as the pH value increased, the oxidation potential of OH ∙ also decreased."
11,Influence of water quality components,"3.5 Influence of water quality components The composition of natural water is quite complex. The effects of cation ions and anion ions on PVA degradation were investigated. As shown in Fig. 7 a, in the case of cationic ions, the influence of the existence of Na+, Zn2+ and K+ on the PVA degradation was negligible compared with the blank. This indicated that Na+, Zn2+ and K+ may not compete with PVA for active sites. However, both Ca2+ and Mg2+ had inhibitory influences on that, and the degradation rate of PVA was close to 80.3 and 84.8%, respectively. This may be due to the co-precipitation of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which reduced the effective active sites of the PVA reaction [46,47]. Nevertheless, the existence of Cu2+ and Ni2+ had a promoting effect on PVA degradation. Actually, Cu2+ and Ni2+ could also activate H2O2 to generate OH ∙ [48], thereby increasing the PVA degradation rate. For the anion case, there was no significant difference in the degradation of PVA by SO4 2−, SiO3 2−, NO3 – and Cl− compared with the blank case [49,50], because they also might not compete with PVA for reactive sites. On the contrary, F− and HCO3 – had a deeply inhibitory effect on PVA degradation, from about 94.4% of the blank sample to 77.3% and 84.2%, respectively. Actually, F− may be a weak scavenger of OH ∙ , causing inhibition of PVA degradation. Moreover, it has been reported in the literature that HCO3 – can react with OH ∙ [51], leading to the scavenging process of OH ∙ . Also, H+ could be scavenged when HCO3 – was added, resulting in the increase of pH value."
12,The reusability and stability of IM@K,"3.6 The reusability and stability of IM@K The reusability and stability of heterogeneous catalysts is a key issue in the catalytic application. From Fig. 8 , the IM@K catalyst could continuously activate H2O2 to efficiently degrade PVA throughout the five cycles without general recycling steps, like drying, cleaning, and filtration. After five successive runs, the degradation of PVA still reached more than 85% within 480 min. The above results proved that IM@K catalyst presented good stability and reusability to activate H2O2 to degrade PVA. Besides, the leaching of iron ion was further studied during the oxidation process and results are shown in Table 1 (Conditions: [PVA]0 = 10 g/L, temperature = 50 °C, [IM@K]0 = 0.5 g/L, [H2O2]0 = 150 mM and initial pH = 5.0.). In IM@K/H2O2 system, the concentration of leached iron ion was around 0.02 mg/L, which was far below the recommended limits for iron ion. Compared to bare MnFe2O4, IM@K had lower leaching of iron ion in the catalyst/H2O2 system, which might be the generation of Fe-O-Al bond between MnFe2O4 and kaolinite."
13,Possible activation mechanisms of H2O2,"3.7 Possible activation mechanisms of H2O2 As shown in Fig. 9 , a possible activation mechanism of radical generation in the IM@K/H2O2 system was proposed. On IM@K surface, Fe(II) can activate H2O2 to decompose to generate OH ∙ , and Fe(III) can reduce H2O2 to generate peroxide radicals (HO2 .) and Fe(II) (Eqs. (13)–(14)) [52]. Similar to Fe(II), Mn(II) can also activate the decomposition of H2O2 to generate OH ∙ and Mn(III) can react with H2O2 to generate HO2 . and Mn(II) (Eqs. (15)–(16)) [53]. Once H2O2 was added into solution, OH ∙ radicals were generated by active sites including Fe(II) and Mn(II) on the catalyst surface. Then the generated OH ∙ reacted with PVA, leading degradation and further mineralization. Subsequently, Mn(IV) on the IM@K surface can react with H2O2 to form Mn(III) and HO2 . (Eq. (17)) [54], and the generated Mn(III) can react with H2O2 to generate Mn(IV) and OH ∙ (Eq. (18)) [55]. Since the reduction of Fe(III) by Mn(III) was thermodynamically favorable, Fe(III) in IM@K surface can react with Mn(III) to produce Fe(II) and Mn(IV) (Eq. (19)), which may promote the cycling of Fe(III)/Fe(II) and Mn(IV)/Mn(III) in IM@K [54,56]. The radical chain reactions could also be carried out according to Eqs. (20)–(24). The generated HO2 . can react with H2O2 and decompose to produce ∙O2– (Eqs. (21)–(22)) [57]. Furthermore, the electron transfer from O2 to Mn(IV) or Mn(III) can produce 1O2 as displayed in Eqs. (23)–(24) [58]. (13) Fe(II) + H2O2 → Fe(III) + + OH– (14) Fe(III) + H2O2 → Fe(II) + HO2 · + H+ (15) Mn(II) + H2O2 → Mn(III) + OH. + OH– (16) Mn(III) + H2O2 → Mn(II) + HO2 · + H+ (17) Mn(IV) + H2O2 → Mn(III) + HO2 · + H+ (18) Mn(III) + H2O2 → Mn(IV) + + OH– (19) Mn(III) + Fe(III) → Mn(IV) + Fe(II) (20) + H2O2 → HO2 · + H2O (21) HO2 ·+ H2O2 → O2 – + H2O + OH– (22) HO2 · → H+ + O2 – (23) Mn(IV) + O2 → Mn(III) + 1O2 (24) Mn(III) + O2 → Mn(II) + 1O2"
14,Conclusion,"In summary, the IM@K was successfully synthesized via hydrothermal method and its degradation efficiency is better than that of bare MnFe2O4 for PVA degradation. This is because IM@K has larger specific surface area, larger pore volume and more hydroxyl groups. PVA can be quickly degraded under the optimal conditions (i.e., temperature = 50 °C, [IM@K]0 = 0.5 g/L, [H2O2]0 = 150 mM and initial pH = 5.0). In addition, the degradation rate of PVA could reach 94.4%. Moreover, the results of EPR and radical quenching experiments showed that OH ∙ is mainly produced from Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Mn(IV)/Mn(III)/Mn(II) oxidation–reduction reactions, which played a leading role for the degradation of PVA. The existence of Na+, K+, Zn2+, Cl−, NO3 –, SiO3 2− and SO4 2− had negligible influence on PVA degradation. Nevertheless, HCO3 – and F− exhibited a significant inhibitory effect, while Cu2+ and Ni2+ had a positive effect. This work provided an avenue to develop a highly-efficient natural minerals-based catalyst for activating H2O2 to degrade PVA fabric wastewater."
