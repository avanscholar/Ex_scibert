0,Introduction,"The solar energy is one of the most abundant energy source on earth and its inexhaustible supply make it a focus of investigation aiming to found technologies capable of capturing, converting and storing efficiently this energy. Among these technologies, photocatalytic hydrogen generation seems to be a potential alternative for this process. Hydrogen is an energy carrier, is highly efficient, stocks three times more energy than the same amount of natural gas, easy to convert to other kind of energies and also, hydrogen is an environmentally friendly energy carrier because its combustion produces only water [1–3]. Since 1972, when Fujishima and Honda found out the water could be split into hydrogen and oxygen on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrode irradiated under ultraviolet light (UV) [4], photocatalytic hydrogen generation seems to have become a promising solution to fuel and environmental pollution problems. However, to use solar energy to produce hydrogen, it is necessary to satisfy at least two requirements: (i) materials capable of absorbing in the widest range of the solar electromagnetic spectra need to be developed, and (ii) that these materials have the capacity to mainly produce hydrogen. Hydrogen production on semiconductor materials is mainly affected by the quantity of photogenerated electrons in relation to the incident photons. Therefore, any process related to the consumption or generation of electrons influences directly low hydrogen efficiencies [5]. There are three general causes for these low efficiencies towards hydrogen in photocatalytic processes: (i) a reverse reaction between H2 and O2; (ii) photogenerated electron-hole recombination (e−-h+), and (iii) a limited capacity in light absorption. With regards to the reverse reaction between H2 and O2, these gases are produced during photocatalytic water splitting, which occurs when water molecules react with the photogenerated holes in the valence band, and thus, oxygen (½O2) and hydrogen ions (H+) are produced [6,7]. Then, the hydrogen ions (H+), instead of reacting with photogenerated electrons in the conduction band, react backwards with the oxygen to produce water molecules again. To overcome this reverse reaction, it has been proposed to use electron donors, which can be co-catalysts or sacrificial agents [7,8], to trap the photogenerated holes and increase the probability of a reaction between H+ and the conduction band electrons of the semiconductor material. However, the yields of co-catalysts like IrO2 (RuOx) [7], Au [9], Rh [10] and CuO [11] are still low. On the other hand, organic compounds are excellent sacrificial agents because most of the organic functional groups have an oxidation potential that is less positive than the valence band edges of the most common semiconductor materials [8]. This means that not only hydrogen can be obtained with photocatalytic processes, but also organic compounds can be oxidized. In terms of the electron-hole recombination, when a photon with an energy higher than the band-gap of the semiconductor material interacts on the photocatalyst surface, it transfers energy to the electrons in the valence band. The electrons “jump” to the conduction band where it can react subconsequently with molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface. This last reaction should happen in less than (10–100) nano-seconds [12,13]. However, when the recombination takes place, energy in light or heat form is released [14]. Accordingly, to increase the lifetime of the photogenerated electron-hole pair, it has been proposed to incorporate doping and/or load co-catalysts into the bare photocatalyst. The incorporation of doping or loading co-catalysts to reduce the recombination probabilities can also improve the limited capacity in solar light absorption (visible range 390–780 nm). With this objective, different materials have been incorporated into the bare TiO2: non-metal doping (N, F, C and S) [12,15], noble metal loading (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt and Au) [10,16,17], transition metal oxides (V-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, Zn-, Zr-, Nb-, Mo-, Ta-, W-oxides) [12,18], metal oxides (Ga-, Ge-, In-, Sn- and Sb-oxides) [12] and metal sulphides (CdS, ZnS, Bi2S3) [12,19,20–22]. Under visible light, the quantum yields of the photocatalysts towards hydrogen hardly reaches 10%. Most of these catalysts include transition noble metals (Au, Pt, Rh and Pd) as co-catalysts of TiO2 [1,10,16,20,23]. Therefore, for hydrogen production under visible irradiation using sacrificial agents it is necessary to progress in the study of photocatalytic materials with a narrower band-gap, valence and conduction band levels that are more positive than TiO2 to oxidize the highest amount of organic compound possible, pumping the photogenerated electrons out of the TiO2 conduction band. In this sense, tungsten trioxide (WO3) seems to be a good co-catalyst because of its light absorption properties in wavelengths up to 480 nm, its relatively narrow band-gap (around 2,8 eV) and stability and harmlessness in acidic and oxidative conditions [2,24,25]. Nevertheless, WO3/TiO2 without being doped has low photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen formation [2,26]. In this paper, hydrogen production from water-methanol mixtures is studied in a series of catalysts based on Pd/TiO2-WO3 under visible and UVA light, where palladium is added in very small amounts (around 0.01 wt%) in order to produce cheaper catalysts for industrial purposes. Palladium (Pd) was selected as co-catalyst as supported Pd has been demonstrated to be a good promoter of photocatalytic activity, which can work as an electron trapper [10,26,27], and also because Pd is the most reactive noble metal and has a remarkable capacity for hydrogen absorption [28]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Supports of P25-WO3 and nanotubes of titania (NT) containing WO3 (NT-WO3) were synthesized according to a previous work [24]. Briefly, NTs were prepared from Aeroxide TiO2 P25 following this procedure: 1 g of P25 plus 70 ml of NaOH (10 M) was stirred for 30 min. Then, the mixture was treated at 130 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The obtained powders were washed several times with diluted HCl, and dried at 100 °C overnight. Then the samples were calcined in air atmosphere (350 °C) for 3 h. WO3 nanoparticles were deposited over P25 and NT by precipitation of H2WO4 solution with ammonia. In addition, Titanium (IV) oxide, Aeroxide P25 (Acros Organics) (XRD analysis: 87.6% anatase and 12.4% rutile; 16.9–30 nm primary particle size) and Titanium dioxide, TiO2-anatase (Probus) (XRD analysis: 88.3% anatase and 11.6% rutile; 53.4–85 nm primary particle size) were used as support for the Pd/P25 and Pd/TiO2-anatase catalysts, respectively. Tungstic acid (H2WO4) (Aldrich, 99%) was used as the starting material for WO3 synthesis. Palladium (II) Chloride (PdCl2, Johnson Matthey, metal purity 59.66%) diluted in hydrocloric acid (HCl) 37% (Analytical reagent from Fisher) was used for Pd incorporation on these supports. Two kinds of water were used for the water-methanol mixtures: tap water and milliQ water. Methanol was supplied by Sigma Aldrich (99.8% purity)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Pd was incorporated in all the catalysts by photodeposition. A water solution of PdCl2 in HCl was added to a glass flask and stirred for some minutes. Then, the catalytic supports (P25-WO3, NT-WO3, TiO2-anatase, P25 or WO3) were added under continuous stirring. Afterward, the system, still under continuous stirring, was deaerated with argon (50 ml/min) for 50 min and then irradiated with a UV lamp (λmax ∼ 365 nm, 6 W) overnight (around 14 h). After irradiation, the solid particles were recovered by filtration, washed several times with distilled water and dried at room temperature under vacuum. In the text the abbreviation 2w and 4w refers to 2000 and 4000 ppm of catalytic support in the photodeposition solution."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization NT-WO3 and P25-WO3 supports were characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), BET surface area (SBET) and pore volume (VPORE) using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C. Their structural characterization (morphology and the amount of anatase and rutile TiO2 phases in the two supports) was performed employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The band-gap was determined by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. More details about the characterization of the NT-WO3 and P25-WO3 supports can be found in the references [24]. The palladium content of the catalysts was analysed by ICP-OES: inductively coupled plasma with an optical emission spectrophotometer (ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos FHS-16). The BET surface area and pore volume of the photocatalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms obtained at −196 °C using a Quadrasorb SI Models 4.0 with the QuadraWin Software (v. 5.0 + newer). Before the sample analysis, the photocatalysts were outgassed at 150 °C for 18 h under vacuum (6 mTorr) in the instrument pre-chamber to eliminate chemisorbed volatile species. XRD measurements were made using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Bragg-Brentano parafocusing geometry and vertical θ-θ goniometer) fitted with a curved graphite diffracted-beam monochromator, incident and diffracted-beam Soller slits, a 0.06° receiving slit and scintillation counter as a detector. The angular 2θ diffraction range was between 5 and 70°. The data were collected with an angular step of 0.05° at 3 s per step and sample rotation. Cukα radiation was obtained from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The samples were also analysed from 35 to 52° 2θ, using an angular step of 0.03° at 12 s per step in order to enhance the signal/noise ratio. High resolution – transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses were carried out with a JEOL 2010F instrument equipped with a field emission source. The point-to-point resolution was 0.19 nm and the resolution between lines was 0.14 nm. The XPS spectra were acquired in a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser, operating in a constant pass energy mode, and a non-monochromatic Mg-Kα (hv = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.603 × 10–19 J). The X-ray source was operated at 10 mA and 1.2 kV. The angle of the incident photon beam was 45° with respect to the normal angle of the sample. The background pressure in the analysis chamber was kept below 7 × 10−9 mbar during data acquisition. The binding energy (BE C1s = 284.9 eV) of adventitious C1 was used as reference. A Shirley background subtraction was applied and Gaussian–Lorentzian product functions were used to approximate the line shapes of the fitting components. Band gap values were determined by diffuse reflectance UV–Vis (DR-UV–Vis) of the solids, measured by a UV-2410 PC spectrometer with integrating Sphere attachment: SHIMADZU ISR-240, converting it into absorbance using the Kubelka-Munk function [Photon energy * Absorbance]1/2 versus the Photon energy and extrapolation to y = 0 of the linear regression."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests were carried out in two different reaction systems with continuous stirring (see Fig. 1 ). One of the systems consisted in a borosilicate reactor (750 ml) with a wider shape inside a solar simulator chamber (SUNTEST CPS+) with a Xe lamp at the top of the chamber (300–800 nm; 250 W/m2, I250–450nm: 6.5 × 10−4 Einstein/min). The second system consisted in a vertical glass reactor (300 ml) placed inside a white methacrylate chamber equipped with four UVA lamps arranged in each of the inner walls of the chamber in a vertical position (300–400 nm; 15 W/lamp, I250–450nm: 8.3 × 10−5 Einstein/min). A mass flow controller (Alicat Scientific MC-50SCCM-D/5M) was used to introduce argon as the carrier gas through the reactor and to introduce the hydrogen produced in an online gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-14B, with a TCD detector and Carbosieve SII 100/120, 3 m 1/8″ SS column). The hydrogen production reaction was performed without adjusting the pH and without temperature control (25–35 °C). In a typical photocatalytic experiment, either under visible or UVA light, the reactor was loaded with an aqueous solution of methanol (5, 10, 25 or 50 vol%) and different amounts of catalyst (500, 333, 167 or 83 ppm). Then, the reactor was placed inside the solar box or the UVA box, and the solution was bubbled with argon (50 ml/min) for around 60 min to remove the air inside the reactor and the gas line. The reactor remained under irradiation for 185 min and every 15 min the gas sample was automatically injected to the chromatograph."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the photocatalysts Some of the features of the characterization of photocatalytic materials used in this article are shown in Table 1 . The objective was to introduce a very low amount of Pd (around 0.01 wt%) in order to determine the effect of small Pd particles on the hydrogen generation. The NT, P25, pure anatase phase and the incorporation of WO3 in these supports were studied. Table 1 shows the amount of Pd determined by ICP-OES of the different samples. SBET, VPORE and band gap energy (Eg) with the corresponding wavelength are also included in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25 supports. From the results, porous materials with type IV isotherms were observed, containing an H2 type of hysteresis loop for the NT-WO3 and an H3 type of hysteresis loop for the P25-WO3 and P25 supports according to IUPAC [29]. The narrow hysteresis loops of P25-WO3 and P25 may indicate that the pores have a slot shape. However, the hysteresis loop for the NT-WO3 sample is wider. This means that the pores of NT-WO3 probably have a shape with more narrow necks and wide bodies (ink bottle shape). Fig. 3 shows N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25 after the Pd was deposited. There are no important changes in the pore structure of these materials with respect to the supports. SBET and VPORE were determined with a physisorption analysis (Table 1). For NT-WO3 (104.6 m2/g and 0.4541 cm3/g), when Pd is photodeposited, the values of SBET (94.13 m2/g) and VPORE (0.3691 m3/g) were slightly reduced. The Pd nanoparticles could close some pores and fill others; therefore, the specific area is reduced as well as their pore volume. Looking at the hysteresis loop (Fig. 3(a)), Pd/NT-WO3 has the same pore structure as NT-WO3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Pd nanoparticles could partially occlude the entrance of the pores without producing the plugging. Consequently, the pore structure is conserved but the pore volume and surface area are decreased. Similar behaviour was observed for all the catalysts. In the case of P25, a similar SBET is obtained for the support as well as after Pd deposition. This is probably due to the presence of larger Pd nanoparticles (5–7 nm) that are probably located outside the pores. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns for the NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25 supports and after the deposition of Pd. All three supports exhibited similar diffraction lines referable to the anatase phases (A). Only P25 and P25-WO3 exhibited the rutile phase (R). The absence of the rutile phase in NT-WO3 is due to the synthesis protocol performed to obtain NT [24]. Rey and collaborators [24] explain that the absence of peaks referable to WO3 could be due to the low amount of WO3 (around 5 wt%). Therefore, the incorporation of WO3 species has no significant effect on the TiO2 structure. No effect of the Pd photodeposition method on the crystalline phases of the supports (see Fig. 5 ) was observed. Furthermore, due to the low amount of Pd in the sample, no diffraction line corresponding to Pd was detected. This is also in concordance with the TEM results, which indicate the presence of smaller Pd nanoparticles, which can even be at the atomic size level. In Fig. 6 (a) it is possible to see that the sample containing Pd deposited on P25 is constituted by titania crystallites and some Pd nanoparticles of 5–7 nm in size. For the samples that contain WO3 on NT (sample Pd/NT-WO3, Fig. 6(b) or on P25 (sample Pd/P25-WO3. Fig. 6(c), Pd particles were not identified by STEM or HRTEM, which means that they are probably very small in size (<2 nm in size) so they escape detection by STEM with the microscope used. This indicates that the addition of WO3 produces a very high dispersion of the Pd. In the TEM images we can see that the samples are constituted by well-dispersed TiO2 particles of about 15–40 nm in size, which are mostly covered by other small (<10 nm) WO3 crystallites. Fig. 7 shows the surface chemical composition analysed by XPS for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25 catalysts. From the complete spectra for all the catalysts of Pd/P25 illustrated in Fig. 7(a) and (c) we can verify the presence of O, Ti and C with the O 1s, Ti 2p, C1 s and Ti 3p peaks at 531 eV, 460 eV, 285 eV and 38 eV, respectively. The Pd 3d XPS analyses for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25 are shown in Fig. 7(b) and (d). For both samples, it is difficult to see very clear Pd peaks due to the low Pd content. However, it is possible to see two small prominences at around 336.7 eV and 341.9 eV, which are characteristic for metallic Pd (Pd5/2 and Pd3/2 transitions, respectively) and correspond to Pd (II) species, which are probably PdO or Pd(OH)2 [30]. The optical band gap was determined by means of Tauc's plot for indirect semiconductors ([Photon energy * Absorbance]1/2 versus the Photon energy) obtained from diffuse reflectance spectra. Barium sulphate (BaSO4) was used as standard. The diffuse reflectance spectrum was converted into absorbance using the Kubelka-Munk function. The band gap results are summarized in Table 1 together with the wavelength and absorption edge. The band gap values (Eg) for P25, NT-WO3 and P25-WO3 are 3.10, 2.97 and 3.08 eV, respectively. The DR-UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 8 ) showed a higher optical absorbance near 400 nm for all the catalysts when Pd is incorporated. Table 1 shows that the incorporation of Pd produces a slight decrease in the band gap and higher wavelength (nm) for all the catalysts. Pd/NT-WO3 showed the lowest band gap energy and highest wavelength (2.94 Eg, 393 nm). Nevertheless, the band gap values are comparable to the literature for similar materials [24]. Some authors indicate that incorporating noble metals in semiconductor materials enhances light absorption towards the visible region, which can be attributed to a characteristic absorption of surface excitation due to plasmons of the metal nanoparticles [31,32]."
8,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production Hydrogen tests were carried out in the two systems: UVA and solar light. The experiments were carried out under different catalyst concentrations and different amounts of methanol. The objective was to determine the optimal set of conditions under which hydrogen generation is at its maximum. Other parameters, such as the Pd amount deposited, type of water and light source, were also studied to understand their effect on the hydrogen evolution. 3.2.1 Effect of the amount of catalyst and the catalyst nature Fig. 9 shows the hydrogen evolution for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 under solar light for different catalyst concentration: 86.3, 166.7, 333.3 and 500 ppm. A blank test without catalyst addition was also performed and no hydrogen generation was observed. For both catalysts, the highest hydrogen evolution was observed for a catalyst concentration of 166.7 ppm. This indicates that there is an optimal catalyst concentration for hydrogen generation. Under these experimental conditions, a lower amount of catalyst probably implies that there are not enough active sites to produce higher amounts of hydrogen. Higher amounts of catalyst involves higher light dispersion, which also leads to a lower hydrogen generation. Furthermore, the Pd/NT-WO3 catalyst produced a higher hydrogen evolution than the Pd/P25-WO3 catalyst (around 30% more) Fig. 10 shows the hydrogen production for different catalysts based on Pd, TiO2 and WO3 under solar light. In this experimental set the highest hydrogen production was achieved by Pd/NT-WO3 (1.57 ml/min gCat) followed by Pd/P25-WO3 (1.06 ml/min gCat) and Pd/P25 (0.73 ml/min gCat). The NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25 supports scarcely reached 0.499, 0.30 and 0.030 ml/min gCat, respectively. These results indicate that the incorporation of this very low amount of Pd improves the efficiency of the NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25 catalysts towards hydrogen production by around three times for both NT-WO3 and P25-WO3, and up to 25 times for P25. Furthermore, the incorporation of WO3 on the bare TiO2 also increases the hydrogen production. In Fig. 10 it can also be observed that at the beginning of the irradiation there is an increase in hydrogen evolution before a plateau is reached. This induction period may correspond to the formation of active sites for hydrogen. Some authors explain that this period can correspond to a photocatalytic reduction of an oxidized form of a metallic-co-catalyst [18,36,37] (M+ → M0, M: metallic element). Konta et al [36] indicate that these induction periods suggest that some reduction processes occur on the catalyst at the beginning of the irradiation. Based on these ideas, it is possible to understand that before irradiation, the Pd on the catalyst could be in an oxidized form (in agreement with the XPS results), then, after irradiation has started, the Pd is reduced by the electrons that are photogenerated. Hence, when the irradiation time is increased, more electrons are photogenerated; then, more metallic Pd is formed (Pd0) and more hydrogen ions are adsorbed on the Pd surface. The effect of the nature of the catalyst was also studied using tap water in the water-methanol solution, but in this case, because tap water decreases the hydrogen evolution substantially, the catalyst concentrations were increased (500 ppm) in this test in order to counteract these hydrogen decreases (see Fig. 11 ). Similar to the results presented in Fig. 12 , the Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 catalysts showed higher hydrogen generation compared with the rest of the catalysts. Concerning the different hydrogen evolution profiles, the catalysts containing Pd have a clear profile with an induction period at the beginning of the reaction followed by a plateau at the end of the experiment. Wan-Ting et al. [18] suggested that this can be explained by some part of the metal being in an oxidized form that can be reduced during the irradiation. Furthermore, for the tap water, the content of salts or chlorine can also have some influence on the reduction of Pd nanoparticles by irradiation and this process is not completed as it can be observed for most of the catalysts shown in Fig. 13 . 3.2.2 Effect of the methanol concentration In order to understand the effect of different concentrations of the sacrificial agent on the hydrogen production, different amounts of methanol (0, 5, 10 and 50 vol%) were studied. Fig. 12 shows the hydrogen production on Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 at different methanol concentrations. It can be seen that under our experimental conditions, in the absence of methanol, water splitting did not take place (line corresponding to 0 vol%), and the Gibbs free energy is 238 kJ/mol [28,35]. When the sacrificial agent was added, hydrogen was detected and its evolution increased with the increase of the amount of methanol. This outcome might be explained by the fact that methanol molecules act as a hole scavenger on the surface of the catalytic support; therefore, the more methanol added, the higher the probability of photogenerated holes being trapped by the organic compounds. As a result, photoexcited electrons are easily trapped by Pd, increasing the lifetime of the electron-hole pair and increasing the hydrogen generation. In the literature, it is not still clear what role the water and organic compound molecules play. Some authors have suggested that photogenerated holes may be reduced when they are transferred directly towards the methanol or by intermediary species, such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) or oxide ions (O2−), formed from the oxidation of water molecules or the reduction of the remaining oxygen molecules (O2) (even after deaeration) that are adsorbed on the photocatalytic surface, or both simultaneously [34]. Other authors have proposed that the dissociation of the organic compounds can be complete and arrive to CO2 and H2O, or partial, where the reaction proceeds into the dissociation of next intermediary products [38,39]. Patsoura et al. [16] also explained that adding organic compounds in photocatalytic reactions helps to clean up the catalyst surface from “poisons”, which results in a higher hydrogen evolution. 3.2.3 Effect of the type of water and light source Fig. 13 compares the Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 catalysts for the systems under UVA and solar light. Under UVA light, the hydrogen evolution for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 was 1.171 and 1.033 ml/min gCat, respectively. Under solar light, the hydrogen evolution was 1.122 and 0.723 ml/min gCat, respectively. Under solar light, the significant difference between Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 could be due to the different structure of the NT, whose band-gap is narrower, which makes it easier to capture more photons from the near visible range, increasing the hydrogen production. As for the effect of the water matrix, both figures (Fig. 13(a) and (b)) clearly show the negative effect on hydrogen evolution of the presence of salts in tap water. Under UVA light, the hydrogen evolution using Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3, using a milliQ-water-methanol solution, is around 7 and 9 times higher than those experiments carried out with a tap water-methanol solution, respectively. In this case, the quantum efficiency for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 decreased from 7.7 to 1.6% and from 6.2 to 0.9%, respectively. Under solar light, the difference between the hydrogen evolution using milliQ and tap water for the water-methanol solution is around 6 times higher for both catalysts. In this case, the quantum efficiency for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3 decreased from 2.3 to 0.4% and from 1.5 to 0.2%, respectively. These results give us a first overview of the challenges to overcome for generating hydrogen from wastewater from treatment plants. Wastewater from a real wastewater treatment plant is still loaded with impurities and other compounds, which can compete with the generation of hydrogen or deactivate the catalyst. 3.2.4 Effect of the amount of photodeposited Pd In order to understand the effect of the amount of photodeposited Pd on the hydrogen evolution, Pd photodeposition was performed varying the amount of Pd in the catalyst from a concentration of 0 to 0.03 wt%. Fig. 14 shows the effect of the amount of Pd photodeposited on the hydrogen evolution for three Pd/P25-WO3 catalysts. The amounts of Pd photodeposited were 0.0075, 0.011 and 0.0297 wt%. Concerning the effect of the amount of Pd on the hydrogen generation, Fig. 14 suggests that the optimal amount of photodeposited Pd is 0.011 wt%. For Pd/P25-WO3, the supports without Pd had very low hydrogen evolutions (0.004 ml/min gCat). When 0.0075 wt% of Pd is added to the catalyst, the hydrogen evolution increases up to a plateau of 0.359 ml/min gCat. Once the Pd is increased until 0.011 wt%, a large increase in the hydrogen evolution was observed (1.125 ml/min gCat). However, when the Pd added to the photodeposition solution increased to 0.0297 wt%, a decrease was observed in the hydrogen production (0.519 ml/min gCat). Some authors explain that the high metal content in catalytic supports could create a shadow effect, and therefore light absorption decreases [38,9]."
9,Literature comparison,"Table 2 shows a comparison of quantum yield values (%) for hydrogen production obtained by several catalysts mostly based on TiO2. The determination of Quantum yield (QE or φ) [10] and Apparent Quantum efficiency (AQE) [39,36] is found in the literature as follow: (1) ϕ = n ( H 2 molecules formed ) unit time n ( p h otons exposed ) unit time . 100 (2) AQE = 2 n ( H 2 ) n ( incident p h otons ) . 100 From Eq. (1), H2 molecules formed are calculated from the H2 rate (mol/min gCat), taking into account the amount of catalyst used in a typical photocatalytic experiment and the Avogrado number (6.022 × 1023 molecules/mol). The photons exposed are determined considering actinometry data, either by Einstein/unit time or Photon/unit time, where one Einstein corresponds to the energy in one mol of photons; therefore, 6.022 × 1023 photons. It is significant to mention that the quantum yield parameter is only an indicative value of the hydrogen evolution per unit of photons coming into the photocatalytic system; therefore, the comparison based on this parameter does not take into account the experimental conditions, such as the amount of catalyst, the metal content or the reaction volume. Table 2 shows different catalysts based on noble metals (Pd or Pt) supported on TiO2. The first four catalysts are those studied in this paper. The results of the quantum yield (ϕ) under UVA light show that the catalysts studied in this paper seem to be good enough, 7.7 and 6.2% for Pd/NT-WO3 and Pd/P25-WO3, respectively, compared to the literature. However, under solar light, the efficiencies are still low, 2.3 and 1.5%. However, it is important to highlight that in the literature, the amount of metal deposited on most of the supports is between 0.5 and 1 wt%. Nevertheless, the metal loading of our catalysts is around 0.01 wt%. This factor might become our competitive point if we consider the high price of palladium."
10,Conclusions,"This study presents the results for hydrogen generation from water-methanol mixtures on a series of Pd/TiO2-WO3 and Pd/P25 catalysts containing a very low amount of Pd (around 0.01 wt%) prepared by photodeposition. Introducing Pd in all the supports produced a large increase in the hydrogen evolution rate, despite the small amounts of photodeposited Pd. Regarding the absence/presence and the role played by sacrificial agents in photocatalytic hydrogen production, under our experimental conditions, this study concludes that hydrogen generation by water splitting is practically null. However, when methanol is added, a considerable improvement in hydrogen generation was obtained. The amount of hydrogen generated increases with the increase in methanol concentration. This reveals the importance of sacrificial agents in the efficiency of hydrogen generation. Sacrificial agents probably act as hole scavengers, so the recombination probability is reduced. When Pd was incorporated in different amounts (0.0075, 0.011 and 0.0297 wt%) the hydrogen generation was affected significantly, and it is possible to see an optimum value of Pd (around 0.01 wt%). These results might be related to the way Pd is deposited on the support, which affects the size, dispersion, morphology, etc. of the catalysts. This evidences that it is essential to research further the effect of the Pd photodeposition method on the different catalytic supports (NT-WO3, P25-WO3 and P25) using high resolution techniques that can provide valuable information about smaller Pd particles (lower than 2 nm). The best supports for hydrogen generation under both solar and UVA light were NT-WO3 and P25-WO3, whose hydrogen productions under solar light were 1.18 (ϕ: 2.3%) and 0.7389 ml/min gCat (ϕ: 1.5%), respectively, and under UVA light were 1.19 (ϕ: 7.7%) and 1.03 ml/min gCat (ϕ: 6.16%), respectively. In view of the visible light response of the NT-WO3 and P25-WO3 catalysts with Pd incorporated, it is very necessary to continue the study to improve the Pd deposition method and the quantum efficiencies. This study demonstrates that incorporating a very low amount of Pd by photodeposition can improve the hydrogen generation with results comparable to other catalysts already presented in the literature that contained a higher amount of Pd (higher than 0.5 wt%). This is of special interest for a real application considering the high price of Pd."
