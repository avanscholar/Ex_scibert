0,Introduction,"Considering the merits regarding the application of hydrogen including high energy content, water vapor as the only by-product of combustion, and negative entropy production, hydrogen as a fuel has always been the focus of attention and the technologies related to hydrogen energy are developing rapidly [1]. Bio-hydrogen production through dark fermentation provides researchers with a unique opportunity for sustainable use of carbohydrate-rich wastes in bioenergy recovery [2]. Vinasse is a highly recalcitrant wastewater produced in high volume (10–14 L per liter of produced alcohol) from ethanol distillation [3] causing many environmental problems. The viable use of Vinasse for producing cost-effective products as well as green energy creates a challenge to researchers [4–8]. In this regard, bio-degradation of vinasse to bio-hydrogen production has been assessed in many researches [9–15]. Vinasse can be used as a potential substrate for microbial cultures, which are able to produce bio-hydrogen. Needless to say, pretreatment of an anaerobic inoculum is indispensable for bio-hydrogen production from vinasse by mixed culture [16]. Potential source of microbes used as inoculum should be augmented to provide a desired microbial culture. Anaerobic Sludge (AS) obtained from anaerobic digesters is one of the best examples of seed sludge source used for bio-hydrogen production [17,18]. Pre-treatment methods for enriching hydrogen-producing bacteria mainly include heat-shock treatment, chemical treatment (the acid and base treatment by adjusting pH or 2-bromoethanesulfonic (BESA) and iodopropane dosing treatment), repeated aeration, freezing and thawing whereby the activity of hydrogen-consuming methanogens is suppressed while the activity of the hydrogen-producing bacteria is preserved [19,20]. Not only anaerobic sludge has a wide variety of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria, but it also contains of acetogenic bacteria and methanogens (Syntrophic acetogenic and methanogenic organisms [21]), which are involved jointly and eventually convert organic matter into methane (70%) and carbon dioxide (30%). Aforementioned pre-treatment methods inhibit non-spore forming methanogens through thermal, chemical or physical shocks leading the anaerobic fermentation to the production of Volatile Fatty Acids (VFAs), hydrogen, and CO2. Among the pre-treatment methods, heat-shock has been widely used in many previous studies [16,19]. Bacteria being capable of hydrogen production are mainly Clostridium which can form spores when they are in harsh condition; therefore, methanogens are suppressed and the hydrogen-producing bacteria can survive [18]. Studying the influence of the different pre-treatment methods on hydrogen-producing bacteria revealed that although most of the researchers have used heat shock treatment to prepare hydrogen-producing bacteria, this method has some remarkable limitations. As previously mentioned, only spore-forming bacteria can survive under heat-shock while non-spore hydrogen-producers are destroyed, resulting in microbial community reduction [19]. Investigating the production of bio-hydrogen using heat-treated and non-heat-treated anaerobic sludge in different pH values demonstrated that low pH without heat-treatment was sufficient to disable methanogens, and amount of hydrogen production was independent of the pre-treatment of seed sludge [16,22,23]. Activity of methanogens can be limited by either low pH or short Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of operation or both of them. Consequently, controlling methanogens by heat-shock treatment in a mixed culture is not regarded as a crucial factor [1,17,19,24]. The growth rate of the acidogenic bacteria is 10–20 fold higher than the methanogens [25], so short HRT makes methanogens washout. Bio-hydrogen production from vinasse using heat-treated sludge has been widely studied [9–15]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the enrichment of the hydrogen-producing bacteria in a mixed culture through only interfering in operational parameters (i.e. pH, HRT) as a certain pretreatment method and comparing it with other pretreatment methods. So investigation of different pre-treatment methods in the process of bio-hydrogen production from vinasse will highlight the contrast among different procedures for enrichment of seed sludge. Substrate concentration is also as important as the inoculum source in bio-hydrogen production and has to be studied sufficiently [9]. At high substrate concentrations, the fermentation process is influenced by the intermediary products (butyrate) [1] as well as the toxicity problems of vinasse associating with potassium, sulfate, phenolic compounds, and melanoidins may lead to inhibition [3,9,26]. Effect of substrate inhibition on bio-hydrogen production from sugarcane vinasse has not been studied at concentrations more than 12 g COD/L [9]. For kinetic analysis, the Andrew model and Han-Levenspiel model with substrate inhibition were used to determine the effect of glucose concentration on hydrogen production rate (R, mL/h) by Ref. [27]. However, these models were not used for kinetic analysis of the effect of sugarcane vinasse concentration on bio-hydrogen production. For these reasons, this study was designed to investigate two goals: first, hydrogen production by the mixed culture enriched from anaerobic sludge through controlling operational parameters in AnSBR mode (without applying any chemical or physical treatments) was compared with that produced by the anaerobic sludge through common pre-treatment methods. Second, a thorough kinetic analysis determining the inhibition effect of substrate concentration (up to 50 g COD/L) on hydrogen production potential (P) and R was carried out using modified Gompertz, Andrew, and Han-Levenspiel models."
1,Material and methods,
2,Sugarcane vinasse,"2.1 Sugarcane vinasse Sugarcane vinasse prepared from a local distillery (as a substrate) was kept at 4 °C until use. The characteristics of the vinasse are shown in Table 1 . Since BOD/COD ratio was equal to 0.52, the biodegradability of organic matter would increase in vinasse. In order to determine the effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production, the vinasse was diluted by tap water to obtain various feed COD values of 49.80 down to 1.70 g COD/L. Also, freshly prepared vinasse (around 10 g COD/L) was used without any additional nutrient as the substrate in the enrichment experiments."
3,Inoculum,"2.2 Inoculum Anaerobic sludge originating from a wastewater treatment unit at a dairy-industries company was used as seed sludge after enrichment in this study. The initial pH, Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) were equal to 6.65, 16 g/L and 25.50 g/L, respectively. The sludge was stored at 4 °C prior to use in the experiments."
4,Enrichment of consortia using sugarcane Vinasse as the substrate,"2.3 Enrichment of consortia using sugarcane Vinasse as the substrate 2.3.1 Controlling operational parameters in AnSBR Elimination of methanogens is necessary for bio-hydrogen production by the mixed culture. A 400 mL bioreactor, with a working volume of 300 mL was used to conduct experiments for enrichment of hydrogen-producing bacteria. The schematic diagram of the AnSBR set-up is shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was completely mixed at 200 rpm by a magnetic stirrer. A pH controller equipped with a peristaltic pump connected to 0.1 M NaOH solution was used to maintain a constant pH of 5.5 according to prior studies [11]. The temperature was controlled at 36 ± 1 °C by a water bath. The reactor operating as an AnSBR fed using vinasse (with the concentration of 10 g COD/L). The enrichment was conducted in two sets of experiments. The first set of the experiments was carried out using AnSBR with following parameters: feeding time: 5 min; reaction time: 15.75 h; settle time: 0 min; discharge time: 10 min and HRT: 24 h. Zero time for settlement has been performed for 4 full cycles in order to obtain hydrogen-producing bacteria and eliminate methanogens. After completion of zero time settlement experiments for SBR cycles (end of first set), second set of settle time was applied for 15 min when no significant variation was observed in both hydrogen content and COD of effluent, and no methane production was detected (feeding time: 5 min; reaction time: 15.5 h; discharge time: 10 min; 24-h HRT and 11-h Sludge Retention Time (SRT) were kept unchanged). 2.3.2 Heat-shock treatment The anaerobic sludge was heat-treated according to the methods used in the previous studies [9]. Heat-treated anaerobic was used for hydrogen production from vinasse at COD concentration of 10 g/L in AnSBR with the following parameter: feeding time: 5 min; reaction time: 15. 5 h; settle time: 15 min; discharge time: 10 min and HRT: 24 h. 2.3.3 Acid-treatment The acid-treatment was conducted by the method proposed in the prior studies [28]. Hydrogen production from vinasse (at the concentration of 10 g COD/L) using acid-treated anaerobic sludge in AnSBR (the operational sequence for the AnSBR was as same as previous experiments) was evaluated. VHPR was calculated after above-mentioned pre-treatments were carried out, and the prepared sludge was used for hydrogen production from vinasse in AnSBR and then, the results were compared."
5,Batch mode experiments,"2.4 Batch mode experiments After the preparation of inoculum, batch tests were performed to study the effect of 8 different initial concentrations of vinasse (approximately 2, 5, 8, 12, 17, 25, 34 and 50 g COD/L). The suspended growth batch bioreactor was filled by 30 mL of prepared inoculum and 270 mL of diluted vinasse as substrate (concentration of inoculum at 10% v/v) according to the prior studies [14]. Pure nitrogen was initially purged into the reactor for 10 min to generate an anaerobic environment in the reactor. PH and temperature were controlled as described in enrichment procedure. Gas samples were periodically taken from the top of the reactor for analysis. Liquid samples were taken at the beginning and the end of each batch to determine total carbohydrate concentration. Batch experiments were run under each condition in triplicate and reported data included the average of all three results."
6,Gas and liquid measurement and analytical methods,"2.5 Gas and liquid measurement and analytical methods In this study, the term ""Biogas"" usually known as bio-methane, refers to the gaseous product which mostly contains of hydrogen. Biogas production was measured using the water displacement method, and the composition of biogas was determined by gas chromatography (Agilent GC, 7890A) equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD), Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and HP PLOT Q column (30m × 0.53 mm × 40 μm). The temperature of the injection port, column and detector were equal to 120, 40 and 210 °C, respectively. Argon, by the flow rate of 20 mL/min, was used as the carrier gas. TSS and VSS were measured according to the Standard Methods [29]. Influent and effluent COD concentration was carried out in accordance with Standard Methods [29], based on the COD-5220 D. protocol. The total carbohydrate concentration was determined using a colorimetric method [30]."
7,Kinetic analysis,"2.6 Kinetic analysis The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) was used to describe the cumulative hydrogen production in response to initial substrate concentration in the batch study [31]: (1) H ( t ) = P . e x p { - exp e . R m P λ - t + 1 } Where, H (t) is the cumulative hydrogen production at culture time t (h), P is hydrogen production potential (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is lag phase time (h) and e is the Euler constant (2.718282). In this study, cumulative hydrogen production was obtained first from the hydrogen production in batch experiments; then the parameters (P, R m, λ) of Eq. (1) were estimated by minimizing the Sum Square of Errors (SSE) between experimental data and estimations from the model. This estimation was carried out using the ‘Solver’ function in Microsoft Excel software 2010. Once the three parameters were obtained, R was calculated in each batch test by Eq. (2) [27]: (2) R = P ( λ + P / R m ) Where R (mL/h) is hydrogen production rate; P (mL) is the hydrogen production potential; R m (mL/h) is the maximum hydrogen production rate; λ (h) is the lag phase time. In order to describe the dependence of R on COD concentrations, Andrew’s inhibition model (Eq. (3)) [27] and Han-Levenspiel model (Eq. (4)) were used [32], then their fitting results were compared. (3) R = ( k × S ) ( K S + S + S 2 / K i ) Where R is hydrogen production rate (mL/h), k is hydrogen production rate constant (mL/h), K s is the half saturation constant (g/L), K i is the inhibition constant (g/L), and S is COD concentration of substrate (g/L). (4) R = k × ( 1 - S S m ) n × S S + K S × 1 - S / S m m Where R is hydrogen production rate (mL/h), k is hydrogen production rate constant (mL/h), S is COD concentration of substrate (g/L), S m is the maximum COD concentration of substrate (g/L), which is tolerable for hydrogen-producing bacteria, K s is the half saturation constant (g/L), K i is the inhibition constant (g/L), n is exponent constant and m is another exponent constant. The Least Squares method was used to determine parameters of Eqs. (3) and (4) similar to those obtained using Eq. (1)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Inoculum enrichment,"3.1 Inoculum enrichment Methanogens have a very low growth rate compared to hydrogen-producing bacteria which leads to a doubling time of several days or even more [25]. Moreover, optimal pH for hydrogen production has been reported to be at 5.5 [33–35]. In this regard, HRT (taken 24 h) less than doubling time of methanogens as well as pH set on 5.5 are the sustainable conditions for selection of hydrogen-producing bacteria in an AnSBR. In order to prepare the enriched hydrogen-producing seed, the AnSBR was operated for seven days (10 cycles lasting for 16 h). Enrichment stage was accomplished after almost 7 days with respect to constant biogas production and substrate removal. The effects of three types of treating methods along with several studies are summarized in Table 2 , and their results were compared. Low efficiencies observed for COD removal were consistent with the results of various researchers [12,26]. This result is resulted from the production of VFAs and alcohols during anaerobic fermentation and does not represent an environmental problem since; the effluent of hydrogen-production reactor could be used as the feed of methane production reactor [37]. However, total carbohydrate removal efficiency was equal to 92%, 85% and 78% for samples enriched by controlling operational parameters, heat-shock treatment, and acid-treatment methods, respectively. The high efficiency of carbohydrate removal is clear in this process because carbohydrates are the best sources of organic carbon for H2 production by anaerobic fermentation [24]. 28.1 mL of H2 per 1 L in a single hour (Table 2) represents an outstanding volume of H2 produced in enrichment stage indicating that the enrichment was successful; whereas, the bio-hydrogen production using heat-treated and acid-treated AS was found to be relatively lower. Meanwhile, the high performance of the inoculum enrichment by controlling operational parameters can be proved by the carbohydrate removal efficiency (92%), which was higher than the values obtained in case of using heat-treated and acid-treated AS. These results may be related to the microbial community decreasing under the harsh living environment (heat-shock and acid-treatment) [19]. Different values of VHPR have been found in other studies (ranging from 9.4 to 57.4 mL H2/L h) (Table 2), and this could be attributed to the operating condition (HRT, temperature) and initial concentration of the applied substrate. Considering all these factors, in this study, the peak for VHPR was found to be a bit more than those studies applied heat-treated sludge at the same operating conditions. It is worthy to note that, AnSBR is the best alternative to the prevention of hydrogen-producers wash-out as well as the removal of methane producers, since controlling SRT and HRT is easier in this type of reactor."
10,Batch experiments,"3.2 Batch experiments 3.2.1 Effect of applying various vinasse concentrations on hydrogen production 8 different concentrations of sugarcane vinasse were used to study its effect on bio-hydrogen production using the pre-adapted enriched biomass. The cumulative hydrogen production curves obtained from the experimental results are shown in Fig. 2 . Points show the obtained experimental data (the values were resulted from the average of three experiments done for each test) and lines represent the fitness to the Gompertz model. The model was found to be in good agreement with experimental data since the correlation coefficients (r2) were superior to 0.99 for all batches. The results showed that hydrogen was produced under all conditions and no methane was detected; however, substrate concentration had a significant effect on the hydrogen production. There were a lag period and an exponential phase in all batch reactors. The duration of exponential phase increased at high concentrations of substrate and, this result is in close agreement with the results of the previous studies [38]. The main kinetic parameters such as λ, P and R m values estimated by fitting the experimental data with Eq. (1) are presented in Table 3 . In order to compare the results obtained in different concentrations of substrate, HY was calculated through dividing P by the added substrate (Table 3). Both P and R m increased when the substrate concentration increased up to 11.60 g COD/L. The maximum P and R m were observed at the substrate concentration of 11.60 g COD/L; however, R m values obtained at the substrate concentrations of 7.70, and 11.60 g COD/L were almost the same (7.25 and 7.47 mL H2/h, respectively) (Table 3). In the case of substrate concentration of 11.60 g COD/L, the reactor showed maximum Specific Hydrogen Production Rate (SHPR) in terms of VSS (biomass concentration) of 20.75 mL H2/g VSS.h and the maximum amount of HY was also obtained at the same concentration of vinasse (58.41 mL H2/g CODi); whereas, a drop was observed in batch tests at substrate concentrations higher than 11.60 g COD/L (from 58.41 to 1.28 mL H2/g CODi) (Table 3). An increase in hydrogen production potential following the increase in the substrate concentration (up to 11.60 g COD/L) is possibly attributed to the relatively high content of carbohydrate in the concentrated feed. Lower hydrogen production at higher concentrations of substrate can be due to the inherent toxicity of the vinasse. This result can also be attributed to the onset of the inhibition of the hydrogen-producing bacteria resulting from over-acidification of bacterial cultures. In addition, high substrate concentrations lead to the sharp increase in total bio-hydrogen production, and consequently the partial pressure of hydrogen would increase in the headspace. This inhibits the fermentation reactions, resulting in dramatic fall in specific hydrogen yield [14,38]. In the current study, pre-adapted enriched biomass made it possible to achieve the maximum hydrogen production at higher concentrations of sugarcane vinasse compared to previous studies [9,15]. Results of studies used sugarcane vinasse for hydrogen production are listed in Table 4 . Regarding the various type of operations, HY obtained in this study is comparable with those of studies investigated the hydrogen production in batch tests (Table 4). The maximum HY observed in this study was higher than those obtained in the prior studies [13,15] and was close to HY reported in the previous studies [9]. Meanwhile, HY presented in the literature [12] is almost 10 fold higher than the others. Considering that HY is calculated through dividing P by the added substrate in terms of COD, it would be important to note that, COD concentration is the initial COD content or removed COD [9], since smaller digit as the denominator of the fraction line leads to the larger digit obtained by the division and vice versa. So the kind of COD content should be determined explicitly in this calculation in order to make a fair comparison. In all aforementioned studies, sugarcane vinasse was used as the substrate; however, the HYs reported in the literature [10,11,15] are comparatively high, where vinasse from tequila production was used as the substrate and these results are attributed to the nature of this type of vinasse. Although the seed sludge used in this study was enriched without heat-treating, HYs are comparable to those studies used heat- treated sludge as an inoculum. Additionally, pre-enriched biomass through controlling operational parameters was able to utilize high concentrations of vinasse up to 49.80 g COD/L, due to the sufficient adaptation of pre-enriched biomass to the sugarcane vinasse. 3.2.2 Effect of various vinasse concentrations on hydrogen production rate R in each batch test was calculated by Eq. (2). The effect of the substrate concentration on R is shown in Fig. 3 . Circular points show the obtained experimental data, and curves represent the fitness to the Andrew (Eq. (3)) and Han-Levenspiel’s (Eq. (4)) models. In order to improve hydrogen production, it is very important to evaluate the effect of COD concentration on R [38]. The kinetic analysis of the effects of COD concentration on hydrogen production rate indicated that, R in batch tests increased at the substrate concentrations ranging from 1.70 to 11.60 g COD/L, however, it decreased with the increase in the substrate concentration ranging from 11.60 to 49.80 g COD/L (Fig. 3). The Andrews (Eq. (3)) and Han-Levenspiel models (Eq. (4)) were used to demonstrate the inhibition of hydrogen production at high COD concentrations. The fitting results were obtained as follows: Han-Levenspiel model: R = 11.49 × 1 − S 76.34 2.09 × S S + 6.28 × 1 − S / 76.34 6.01 ; r 2 = 0.995. Andrews model: R = 33.33 × S 18.20 + S + S 2 / 4.61 ; r 2 = 0.997 Since the correlation coefficient of the fitting using Han-Levenspiel model was higher than that of Andrews’s model, Han-Levenspiel model could be considered as a better model to describe the inhibitory effect of COD concentration. According to Figs. 1 and 2, hydrogen-production decreased with the increase in the substrate concentration ranging from 11.60 g COD/L to higher amounts, so inhibition of hydrogen-producing bacteria at such a high concentration of COD, which is equal to 76.34 g COD/L (S m) would be regarded as the predictable effect of COD concentration. 3.2.3 Variation of carbohydrate at different substrate concentrations The removed carbohydrate concentrations and carbohydrate removal efficiency at the end of each batch test at different concentrations of the substrate are shown in Fig. 4 . Removed carbohydrate concentration increased with the increase in the substrate concentration ranging from 1.70 to 11.60 g COD/L and the values obtained at the substrate concentration ranging from 11.60 to 25.20 g COD/L, were almost the same. Whereas, the carbohydrate removal decreased at the substrate concentrations higher than 25.20 g COD/L (Fig. 4). In terms of carbohydrate removal efficiency, over 90% of carbohydrate was removed at the substrate concentrations less than 11.60 g COD/L (Fig. 4), and the reduction of removal efficiency was gradual. The amounts of carbohydrate removal concentration were constant at the substrate concentrations ranging from 11.60 to 25.20 g COD/L; whereas, the removal efficiency decreased. There is a consensus about the effect of substrate concentration on carbohydrate removal efficiency among researchers [40]. The descending trend of removal efficiency at the substrate concentration higher than 16.80 g COD/L clearly shows that the metabolic activity of microbes has strongly been influenced by the substrate concentration. These results were in close agreement with those obtained from the investigation of the effect of substrate concentration on cumulative hydrogen production (Fig. 2) and hydrogen production rate (Fig. 3)."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, by controlling operational parameters including pH and HRT in an AnSBR, an enriched seed sludge was produced which was more augmented and resistant compared to heat-shocked and acid treated seed sludge. The pre-enriched inoculum used in batch tests allowed the process to have a shorter lag phase time. The resistance of microorganisms to the higher initial concentration of sugarcane vinasse (up to 49.8 g COD/L) was also observed compared to those obtained using heat-shocked and acid treated sludge. It was found that, the hydrogen production potential and the hydrogen production rate have strongly been influenced by vinasse concentration. Maximum HY and R were achieved at COD concentration of 11.60 g COD/L. Kinetic analysis for substrate inhibition showed that the Han-Levenspiel model could be considered as the sufficient model to describe the inhibitory effect of COD concentration."
