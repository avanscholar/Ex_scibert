0,Introduction,"Biofuels are gaining attention as promising sustainable sources to replace conventional fuels while legislation restrictions have been made on the usage of fossil fuels to diminish greenhouse gas effects and preserve natural resources. Although, it is well known that biofuels can be alternative for the petroleum-based fuels, the use of conventional fuels has been rising every year. It was reported that more than 84% of carbon emissions have been released to the atmosphere from fossil based fuels since the 1980’s [1]. Biofuels meet a considerable part of energy demand while making a remarkable reduction impact on greenhouse gases, air pollution and cost of energy [2,3]. The renewable fuels can be benefited as pure or blend with fossil fuels to satisfy many of the energy needs for transport systems, heating and industrial processes [4,5]. Diesel engines are commonly used in various areas like industry, agriculture and transportation owing to their convenient properties such as high thermal efficiency, reliability, adaptability and low costs. Meanwhile, it is thought that diesel vehicles are among environmental pollutants and play a major role in development of energy shortage. So as to abate energy shortage and meet the new emission regulations, alternative fuels are among the most effective solutions [6,7]. Alternative fuels such as alcohols have been widely used as additives in CI engines. Although alcohols have economic benefits in diesel engines in comparison with conventional diesel and can directly be used as a single-fuel or additive in diesel engine without any engine modifications [8], there are some difficulties needed to be eliminated regarding utilization of alcohols, blending with diesel fuel, low lubricity, difficulty of vaporization and high auto-ignition temperature. These difficulties can be overcome by several methods such as using additives or increasing intake air temperature [9,10]. Mixing alcohols with diesel fuels is another approach of removing lubricity and vaporization problems. But alcohols and diesel fuel are not miscible and require co-solvents or emulsifiers in order to blend these liquids. However, these methods are expensive and the mixing process could become troublesome due to blending, separation, splashing, heating or other steps [11]. Even though alcohols are immiscible with diesel fuel, they are miscible with biodiesel. In certain limitation of alcohols, diesel/biodiesel/alcohols can be used in the same mixture without any miscibility problems [12]. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and methanol (methyl alcohol) are two types of light alcohols [13]. Methanol (CH3OH) fuel is being considered as one of the optimal fuels for internal combustion (IC) engines [14,15]. Furthermore, ethanol (C2H5OH) is considered to be one of the most important components of biodiesel fuel and promising alternative fuel in IC engines [16–19]. Oxygenates such as methanol and ethanol have been widely used in IC engines because of their improved volatility and higher latent heating properties [20]. Many researchers have been concentrated on improving the blends of diesel fuel, biodiesel and alcohols as an alternative fuel in CI engines. But there are some complications such as lowered heating value, phase separation, pour point and unsafety conditions for storage and transportation of the ternary blends [21]. Biofuels can directly or indirectly be obtained from biomass sources. Biomass resources can be any form of solid, liquid or gaseous [22]. Liquid biofuels from biomass can be produced both from edible and inedible oils [23]. Fuels from bio-origin (directly from vegetable oils) are renewable and sustainable which also have similar properties to conventional diesel fuel and considered as a solution of the IC engine-based problems. On the other hand, the fuels obtained from vegetable oils have high viscosity and lower boiling point, cetane number and volatility values which are very important features for compression ignition (CI) engines. These drawbacks result in engine oil contamination, incomplete combustion, engine deposits and higher exhaust emissions which make these fuels unfavorable for direct use in diesel engines [24,25]. More studies have so far been made on the developing of ethanol and gasoline blends in SI engines in the literature. However, ethanol can be blended with diesel fuel up to 95% of ethanol in CI engines. High concentration of ethanol in CI engines can be used with several changes like increasing compression ratio and additives in order to improve cetane number [26]. Generally, alcohols are used as additives in CI engines and described as to be very helpful for reducing viscosity and density of pure biodiesel fuels because they have lower viscosity and density values in comparison to conventional diesel fuel. Moreover, these additive fuels increase the combustion efficiency of engine and emit lower smoke emissions to the earth atmosphere when blended with diesel duel. In addition, ethanol and methanol have approximately 35% and 30% more oxygen molecules in their molecular structure, respectively, which led more complete combustion and produce lesser exhaust gas emissions [27–29]. There are several applications on the use of alcohols in diesel engines such as direct injection, blending, emulsification and port injection (fumigation) [6,30]. The limit of alcohol in the direct injection method cannot be over 20% due to poor properties of alcohols such as miscibility, heat value and high auto ignition temperature. Therefore, it is difficult to apply direct injection method on the engine. There are many studies that investigated the effect of alcohol usage in IC engines with port injection method as fumigated additive. In the port injection method, diesel is directly injected while alcohol is injected into the intake ports. The blend method is applied as additives to satisfy homogeneity of the mixture. Emulsion method is based on using emulsifier to mix the fuel blend to prevent phase separation which is able to displace up to 25% diesel fuel [30–33]. But the port injection method is allowed to use higher concentration of alcohols in diesel engine in comparison with other methods [34]. As oil price are increased along with the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions and strict emission legislative regulations, it is necessary to put forward some new, renewable and environmentally friendly fuels instead of conventional fuels to solve these issues. Because of their abundant resources, relatively lower emissions and improved mixing and burning characteristics, the light alcohols, namely methanol and ethanol, have the potential to bring about some solutions to the addressed issues. This paper aimed to deliver comprehensive information including the productions, economic benefits, applications, demand and supply, environmental and human impacts of light alcohols and the emissions and performance effects of these alcohols in diesel engines to lead and contribute researchers in their investigations hereafter."
1,Production of light alcohols,"Thermochemical and biochemical (fermentative) productions are two main methods for the production of biofuels [35]. Production methods of methanol have undergone changes for over a century [36]. Nowadays, there are several ways to obtain methanol from various feedstocks as an alternative fuel. These resources are biomass, natural gas, coke oven gas and CO2 [36–40]. On the other hand, ethanol is mainly produced from two feedstocks which are starch-based feedstock including corn, grain, barley and grain sorghum and sugar-based feedstock including sugarcane fruits, citrus molasses, cane sorghum and sugar beets by fermentation [22]. Moreover, there are many commercial studies to produce ethanol from cellulosic materials such as wood or paper wastes [41]. Apart from these feedstocks, ethanol is made through the hydration of ethylene as a petrochemical [42]."
2,Ethanol production,"2.1 Ethanol production Ethanol can be produced by direct fermenting of sugars with yeast, form lignocellulosic materials and catalytic hydration of ethylene [43]. These methods are briefly presented in Fig. 1 . Carbohydrate resources are divided into three main categories: simple sugars including sugarcane, sugar beet, sorghum, whey and molasses; starches including grains and wheat root crops; lignocellulosic biomass including woody materials, straws, agricultural waste, and crop residues [44]. The processes required for bioethanol production from various raw materials are given in Table 1 [45,46]. 2.1.1 Ethylene hydration This method is commonly used for industrial productions. Ethanol can be manufactured by indirect and direct hydration of ethylene. Ethylene is reacted with water in the presence of steam, using chemicals such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid which is adsorbed on the surface of a solid (silica) as a catalyst to produce ethanol [42]. The diagram of the petrochemical pathways for ethanol production is given in Fig. 2 . Shell company was first introduced and used the method of the direct hydration of ethylene in 1947 [48]. The reaction consists of three steps which are termed as reaction, recovery and purification. The manufacture carries out by reversible exothermic reactions. The equations of ethanol production are given in Eqs. (1)–(3). In reality, the reaction condition is at the temperature of 300 °C, a steam/ethylene ratio of 0.6:1 and pressures between 60 and 70 bar [44,49–52]. Then ethylene transfers to acidic-based catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. Phosphoric acid is generally selected as catalyst and is adsorbed onto a porous material. However, some other metals such as Titanium, Tin, Germanium and Zirconium were studied as well and showed a slight increase of conversion efficiency in comparison with phosphoric acid. The application was first seen for industrial purpose in 1930 by Union Carbide. However, this method is not in usage anymore due to longer regeneration time [43]. The reaction starts with indirect hydration of ethene with sulfuric acid in order to obtain ethyl sulfate. This component then hydrolyzes to manufacture ethanol and reproduce sulfuric acid [47]. (1) CH 2 = CH 2 g e t h y l e n e + H 2 O g ↔ CH 3 CH 2 O H ( g ) (2) C 2 H 2 + H 2 O → CH 3 C H O ( a c e t a l d e h y d e ) (3) H 2 O + ( C H 3 CH 2 ) 2 O ↔ 2 C 2 H 2 O H ( e t h a n o l ) The ethylene and water reagent are used for the reaction which is suggested to be pure [53]. With enhancing the pressure, more product is gained in the reaction. Meanwhile, this process causes polymerization of the ethene. Additionally, higher pressures cause capital and operating costs. According to Le Chartelier’s Principle, the ratio of ethene conversation can be enhanced with excessive water vapor. The phosphoric (V) acid is used in the process as a catalyst which is coated onto a solid silicon dioxide [54]. At this stage, water/ethylene mole ratio is selected less than one in order to block the losses of catalyst. The operation is carried out at 0.6 M ratio of H2O/C2H2. When temperature is between 250 and 300 °C and pressure is 60–70 atm, the ethylene hydration process is successfully done. Then, ethylene and hot water vapor are mixed. After mixing, acidic catalyst is added to the reaction. The last operation is cooling process which gases wait for cooling and ethanol turns to be liquid form [51,55]. Fig. 3 shows the flow scheme for direct hydration of ethylene. Moreover, this method for manufacturing ethanol is nonrenewable when ethylene is manufactured via hydrocracking petroleum resources [43]. 2.1.2 Fermentation Generally, fermentation is used for the purification of ethanol production. This application is consisted of three steps. During the first step, prerunnings are eliminated, in the second step is run and the the final step is, high boilers are removed [56]. In case of high purity of ethanol production by distillation, one more rectification is required [57]. Normally, ethanol is produced in batch fermentation with yeast strain which is unable to endure high concentration of ethanol. Usually, polymeric carbohydrates are hydrolyzed with convenient enzymes before the process and the hydrolysate is used for fermentation in batch and sustains cultures for the reaction [58]. Enzymes for various process of alcoholic fermentation can be simplified like 0.51 kg of ethanol can be produced in return for consumption of each kilogram of glucose. The various pathways for industrial ethanol production are shown in Fig. 4 . Fermentation is made of complex series of reactions. By fermentation, carbohydrates are converted into sugars and starches and then into ethanol and dioxide. These reactions are catalyzed by some enzymes such as zymase in yeasts. Yeast is a vital organism which is the products of anaerobic respiration. Yeast runs best between 25 and 37 °C in the absent of any oxygen content and can be contributed to produce more ethanol up to 14% [49]. Ethanol production using enzymes is simplified in Eq. (4). (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 g l u c o s e → 2 C 2 H 5 O H e t h a n o l + 2 CO 2 + E n e r g y In order to produce alcohol by culturing yeast under certain conditions are defined. This method is able to manufacture dilute concentration of ethanol in water. Ethanol as a toxic chemical, at high concentration of ethanol, enzymes is destroyed and it results in yeast cell death. The most durable yeasts are able to survive up to 15% of ethanol. During the fermentation process, ethanol should be keep away from oxygen molecules. Otherwise the ethanol would be oxidized and then converted to acetic acid which is named as vinegar. Additionally, the yeast could be exposed aerobic respiration to manufacture only CO2 and H2O without manufacturing bioethanol in the presence of oxygen. Firstly, the starch is needed to be broken down into sugars so as to manufacture ethanol from the starchy materials like cereal grains. For ethanol fuel, by the treatment diluted sulfuric acid, fungal amylase enzymes or any of them, the hydrolysis process of starch to glucose can be done so fast [50]."
3,Methanol production,"2.2 Methanol production Methanol or methyl alcohol is the simplest alcohol which its chemical formula is CH3OH and often written as MeOH. Methanol is also known as wood alcohol, wood spirits, spirit of wood and wood naphtha owing to its former production method via pyrolysis of wood. Now, methanol is extensively used as a commodity chemical. It is directly used and a feedstock for the manufacture of many alcohols, liquid fuels, chemical and plastics but primarily used for the production stages of other chemicals [59]. It is possible to obtain methanol from renewable and nonrenewable fossil fuels including: natural gas, coal and biomass; CO2 from the atmosphere and industrial sources such as flue-gases released from fossil-fueled power plants or cement or aluminum plants [60,61]. Apart from these methods, methanol can also be manufactured from C-based wastes thanks to its main source of carbon atoms in its structure [62]. Methanol uses CO2 for its synthesis processes and CO2 can be obtained from various sources. Methanol synthesis efficiency from materials differs but natural gas is the most effective CO2 provider for methanol synthesis which its energy conversion efficiency is above 70%. The conversion efficiency rate for methanol synthesis is given Fig. 5 . 2.2.1 Natural gas-to-methanol At the present time, above 75% of total methanol production is provided from natural gas feedstock [64]. This production consists of three main steps where natural gas is reformed: synthesis gas (syngas) production: producing syngas from natural gas; methanol synthesis: converting synthesis gas into crude methanol and methanol purification: distilling crude methanol to produce the required purity [64–67]. The simplified flowchart of methanol production process from natural gas is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The catalytic methanol production from natural gas involves a high-temperature, high-pressure, exothermic, equilibrium conditions and the overall conversion efficiency is above 99% [68]. For higher conversion, sulfur must be removed because it has a poisoning effect on catalyst. The reaction starts with desulphurization of feedstock in order to diminish sulfur content. Then, the feedstock is compressed and delivered to the steam where it is reformed for syngas production. Syngas is mainly a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in various ratios [69]. In the reforming process, methane is the mean component of natural gas which is converted to H2, CO and CO2 via the several reactions. In some cases, CO2 is added to the reaction to increase efficiency of production. In addition, syngas generation is the most expensive step of the production which accounts for 60% of total cost [70]. After the reforming process, synthesis gases are obtained and then delivered to the methanol synthesis reactor to manufacture crude methanol. The occurred chemical reactions are simplified in Eq. (5–7)). (5) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 O H (6) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 (7) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 O H ( m e t h a n o l ) + H 2 O Crude methanol has a low purity. Therefore, the crude methanol is distilled for the production of a high purity of methanol [71]. 2.2.2 Coal-to-methanol The similar process steps which natural gas involves are made for production of methanol from coal sources. The steps of these processes are syngas production by gasification of coal, crude methanol synthesis and purification process [73–75]. The gasification is made in the presence of H2O/O2 [76]. The same reactor which is used in the process of natural gas feedstock can be employed for these processes. However, synthesis gas derived from coal has lower hydrogen concentration but the process of the liquid-phase methanol is able to fix this [75]. 2.2.3 Biomass-to-methanol It is possible to manufacture methanol almost from all organic materials [40]. Biomass has been enriched with carbon-containing molecules that enable it to be converted into synfuels which contain carbons [66]. The same steps can be done to produce methanol from biomass feedstock as the steps that coal and natural gas feedstocks are undergone. These can be defined as syngas generation, crude methanol synthesis and purification [38,40,66,77,78]. However, it is always not guaranteed to produce the required quality of the needed syngas for methanol synthesis from biomass by conventional gasification processes. While biomass gasification process for electricity generation has normally a considerable amount of inert gas component, the synthesis gas for methanol is needed to involve only a small proportion. When the air is used as an agent, it leads to high nitrogen content in syngas. The ideal molar ratio of H2/CO2 should be over 2:1 in the syngas for methanol synthesis [40]. During the gasification processes of biomass, a gas is always generated with a sharp reduction of the ratio of H2/CO2. Fig. 7 shows the pathways for the manufacture of methanol from renewable resources. 2.2.4 CO2-to-methanol It is possible to obtain methanol through the hydrogenation of pure carbon dioxide using the homogeneous catalysts [38,42]. The chemical reaction is simplified in Eq. (8). (8) CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 O H ( m e t h a n o l ) + H 2 O The manufacturing of methanol from CO2 molecules is only made by input of hydrogen which is produced from renewable resource. The flowchart diagram of methanol production from CO2 is illustrated in Fig. 8 . The component of CO2 has been found on various resources such as flue gases of fossil-fueled power plant, cement, water purification and aluminum plants, fermentation processes and atmosphere [38,79–81]."
4,Worlds light alcohol supplies and demands,"Methanol is produced the most commonly from natural gas all around the world. 85% of installed global capacity is located in Europe and North America. But other regions such as the Middle East, Africa and South America have been increasing the share of methanol production owing to the access to low cost natural gas. In Chine, with the growing demand for methanol and the existence of rich coal sources have been provided a sharp rise in coal-based methanol production in the beginning of 21th century. Nowadays, nearly 35% of installed global production for methanol is provided from coal-based resource [82]. As it can be seen in Table 2 , the total global demand for methanol has been increasing because there is an increment demand in methanol production as a fuel and it is predicted that it will be increased in future as well. Methanol supply and demand balance is presented in Table 2. Fig. 9 gives an overview of methanol demand by end-use. The largest consumer of methanol is formaldehyde with 29% of world methanol demand in 2015. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), gasoline blends, dimethyl ether and methanol-to-propylene (MTP)/methanol-to-olefins (MTO) have each share 10% of methanol in the market. Biodiesel consumption is only accounted for 9% of total world methanol demand. Many biomass sources can be the primary material of ethanol production which these sources have considerable amount of sugar content or components in its structure that enables to convert these into sugar content such as starch or cellulose. The commonly used materials are sucrose-based such as sugarcane, sugar beet and sweet sorghum or starchy-based such as corn, cassava, wheat and rye. Besides, Corn, sugar beet and sugarcane are the most productive crops in the world in terms of yield and productivity. Corn also as known maize, is one of most widely grown crop which covers also the second largest extent among all crops in the world [84,85]. However, sugarcane and sugar beet have the highest crop yields within all feedstocks. On the other hand, they are easily influenced from climate conditions which sugarcane requires warmth temperatures and sugar beet needs cooler temperatures all the year round [86,87]. As it can be observed in the Table 3 , Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer with a few subsides. The USA is the top producer on the world ethanol market with nearly 15.3 billion gallons a year in 2016. After legal restriction by the EU on bioethanol imports, it has been created the opportunity to expand and support domestic producer for ethanol production in the Europe, since that time, the capacity has risen to from 55% to 62% [88]. The world ethanol fuel production by country and region is presented in Table 3. The main reasons which keep the USA and EU among the top ethanol producer are to be the subsidies and policies support by the OECD countries. The regional distribution of world ethanol production is shown in Fig. 10 . As it can be observed in Fig. 10, while Brazil is still on the way to recover from the crises, Brazil is now having 27% of ethanol production in the world, just after the USA with the share of 58%. The EU counties contribute with 5% of world ethanol production."
5,Economic benefits of light alcohols,"Currently, ethanol and methanol have been drawn attention mostly because of their presence into market and their potential to improve security and decrease the adverse effect of climate change. Biofuel usage has been mandated around the world. According to these legislations, biofuel usage will be obliged to consume 10% by 2020 in the EU and 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022 in the USA [90,91]. Lin et al. [92] created a model to evaluate the ternary blend fuels consisting of ethanol, diesel and biodiesel fuel and revealed economic effect of additive for the ternary blends. The ethanol from food wastes was used in the blends in order to increase the profit. Ethanol, biodiesel and diesel were 9.1%, 26.2% and 64.7% or 4.3%, 20.2% and 75.5% in volume basis, respectively. It was calculated zero cost of waste feedstock and as a result of using a combination of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel, the profit could be as high as $13.42 million. Light alcohols also have been discussed for their addition storage in the literature. Turner and Person [35] compared diesel with other vehicles to reveal the economic impacts. The biomass based fuels are easily stored in conventional storage and work without any changes in engine despite only minor adjustment is needed. It is suggested to solve powertrains and fuel systems in developing economies to dispel transportation problems while these countries face sharp growth in transport. Contrarily, there are additional costs for batteries, hydrogen storage and fuel cells for other vehicles such electric vehicle and fuel cell electric vehicle. With the aim of comparing the cost of a battery electric vehicle (BEV), a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) and conventional vehicle are presented in Fig. 11 . Various power rangers are selected for the electric vehicle which these are 15, 50 and 100 kWh and a 50-liter fuel tank is selected for diesel vehicle. The cost differences for battery ($ 250–$ 800/kWh) and fuel cell ($50–$200/kW) are selected. As it can be seen from the figure, diesel and gasoline vehicles are more economical compared to other vehicles [35]."
6,Impacts of light alcohols on the environment and human health,"Ethanol is widely known as ethyl alcohol and colorless liquid with an odor. It is commonly used as a raw synthesis material for production of ethylene, ethyl acrylate, ethylamine, glycol ethers, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, ether oxides as a solvent for extraction processes in laboratories and the production of inks, perfumes, varnishes, plastics, pharmaceuticals, adhesives, explosives cosmetics, paints) and as alternative fuel and additive in internal combustion engines [93,94]. However, ethanol is widely used as beverage. There are rare samples that extensive ethanol consumption has resulted in death of adult [95]. However, ethanol consumption at extent level is become a state of intoxication in the human body. At concentrations above 400 mg/100 ml, it is commonly resulted in death due to respiratory failure or inhalation of vomit [96]. The effects of ethanol on behavior is depicted in Fig. 12 . After Absorption of ethanol into body, it is initially converted to acetaldehyde which is a toxic chemical and then to acetate which is harmless chemical by aldehyde dehydrogenase. In the end, water and carbon dioxide are formed from acetate and circulate in the body [95]. Fig. 13 illustrates the metabolic pathway of ethanol in the human. Ethanol degrades rapidly in the natural environment. Biodegradation of ethanol is fast in soil, groundwater and surface water in which can be recovered within 10 days at maximum. Therefore, it has low risk to environment and living organisms. However, there are some rare cases that it has been caused the death of fishes in surface water in the extensive presence of ethanol due to the depletion of oxygen in water. But ethanol is not absorbed in soil particles [99,100]. Also, it is stated ethanol actually improves air quality by contributing ozone formation [101]. On the other hand, methanol is a toxic, colorless and flammable watery liquid that is used as solvent, alternative fuel source for engines or baseline fuel for picnic stoves, antifreeze (deceasing freezing point of water) for automotive radiator and pesticide [102,103]. Chemicals like alcohols can influence human with five different ways [104]: Indoor air and outdoor air (methanol is taken by air), water (which is contaminated by methanol), soil and agriculture product (which is contaminated by methanol). Methanol can be taken into the human body by several ways (ingestion, inhalation, eye or skin contact). Methanol poses various health risks such as blindness, movement disorders and death [103]. While methanol causes permanent blindness with ingestion of 10 ml, the death results in methanol consumption as low as 30 ml as a result of drinking. Metabolic pathway of methanol in the human body is shown in Fig. 14 . Methanol has a relatively low tocixity but it is converted high toxic chemical like formate (formic acid) [98]. Methanol is converted to formaldehyde and then to formate salts in the liver [99]. These have poisoning effects to central nervous system. Methanol is released into the atmosphere from various resources including volcanoes, microbes, insects, animals and decomposition of organic materials. In addition, methanol can be released into the atmosphere by human effect that is mostly due to its solvent use through evaporation. Methanol presence in the water and soil is less important because methanol is found in natural organism like in fresh and salt water, groundwater, sediments and soil which the source is bioaccumulation, possibly from other sources. It can be concluded that methanol is less harmful to terrestrial and aquatic organism. It can be clearly stated that methanol is much safer and less toxic compared to petroleum-based fuels [105]. In the U.S., permissible alcohol exposure limits for general industry in air (40 h/week) is 1900 mg/m3 for ethanol, 900 mg/m3 for gasoline, and 260 mg/m3 for methanol. Ethanol has a typical smell as methanol has no smell, as a result, it makes difficult to identify methanol above 2,000 ppm (about 1500 mg/m3) in air. Therefore, it is needed to take additional measures for refueling system and fuel station [106]. So as to define a fuel as renewable, the fuel must be biogenetically recycled by combining of carbon dioxide and water in photosynthesis. While H2O and CO2 is required for methanol synthesis, a route can be made to provide CO2 from the atmosphere or flue gases that requiring for methanol synthesis process. H2 is needed for the start of synthesis so water electrolysis is made in order to start the renewable cycle. The renewable cycle for production and use of methanol is illustrated in Fig. 15 . As for the methanol production from various feedstocks including natural gas, coal, biomass, flue gas, the large amount of the CO2 is needed. Natural gas and coal need less quantity of CO2 in order to produce methanol [107]."
7,Light alcohol applications as a fuel,"Alcohol use was widespread even when the refined petroleum fuels were first developed. The usage of light alcohols in internal combustion engines as a fuel goes back to Nikolaus Otto who found the spark ignition engine in 1860. It is known Otto used and recommended alcohols and biodiesel fuels in his invention [108]. Since that time, the alcohols have been attempted to be integrated to internal combustion engines as an alternative fuel throughout history. With facing the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s, several programs made to covert conventional vehicles to methanol-fueled vehicles in the USA and Canada [109]."
8,As diesel fuel,"6.1 As diesel fuel Many reports have been declared light alcohols as one of the most promising blendstock for diesel fuel. Besides, light alcohols have the reduction effect on emission of carbon dioxide, smoke and hydrocarbon components in ignition compression engine by the reason of high oxygen content in its structure. In the literature, many studies have been used light alcohol in CI engine as mostly additive but some of them has tested high concentration of light alcohol up to 95%. [110–117]. More knowledge will be given in the following sections."
9,As gasoline blend,"6.2 As gasoline blend Light alcohols are directly used as a blendstock with gasoline in many countries such as Brazil, Europa and the USA [118] because of its attractive properties as a blend component which it has a high octane value, combustion efficiency, lower cost and harmful emission compared to gasoline [82]. Ethanol is the most commonly used fuel in addition to blending with gasoline [119,120]. Light alcohols are being widely used in SI engines as vehicle fuel and both alcohols were first used as a SI fuel in 1930s in the aim of replacing conventional fuel for better engine performance [41,121,122]. Contrary to the usage of pure ethanol and methanol in SI engines, ethanol/methanol usage with gasoline in small quantities requires no engine alteration for the engine [123]. Light alcohols have a significant amount of oxygen in their molecular compounds which can improve the combustion efficiency and lead the higher combustion temperature of the blends thanks to more oxygen supplied to the combustion chamber during the combustion phase. In the light of this knowledge, exhaust gas emissions can be reduced owing to more burnt fuel in the cylinder. Many experimental researches have also been made in the literature to reveal the effects of ethanol and methanol in SI engines. Wani [124] examined the effect of methanol in SI engine using a single cylinder engine. He discovered the methanol blend was consumed more fuel than base gasoline fuel and CO and HC emissions were increased per unit of energy output. However, NOx emission was decreased. Balki et al. [125] made experimental study using methanol and ethanol as a fuel with pure gasoline to determine the optimal operating parameters for SI engine. The engine tested under different compression ratio, engine speed and ignition timing and operated according to Taguchi’s principle. The authors obtained that the best operating conditions are compression ratio of 9.0 and engine speed of 2400 rpm for the test fuels. Moreover, the best ignition time is 20 °CA for alcohol blended fuels and 20 °CA for gasoline. The authors stated that the engine performance and regular brake specific exhaust emission results obtained from optimized engines generally advanced in comparison with those of the baseline engine. Turkcan et al. [126] used methanol and ethanol in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion engine. He expressed that alcohols addition on gasoline resulting in a reduction of NOx. Zaharin et al. [127] compared the ethanol and methanol addition on engine performance and exhaust emissions in a SI engine and reported that BSFC were deteriorated while BTE was improved for light alcohols-included blends. BTE was the highest for the methanol blend. CO and HC gases were reduced as well. On the contrary, NOx was increased for both of alcohol blends. Li et al. [128] studied the effect of methanol and ethanol on performance and exhaust emissions in a SI engine. They observed that methanol-gasoline blends were showed the lowest NOx gas emissions while ethanol-gasoline blends were produced the lowest HC gas emissions. On the other hand, CO gases were increased and BTE was reduced for alcohol included blends. Doğan [129] used ethanol as a fuel in SI engine and compared its characteristics with neat gasoline. They found that, despite BSFC and HC gases of ethanol were higher, CO and NOx emissions were lower than gasoline. Alexandru et al. [130] evaluated performance and emission parameters of methanol in a SI engine. They found that CO, CO2 and HC exhaust gas emissions were reduced in comparison with base gasoline. Kak et al. [131] examined the engine performance and emission figures using methanol and ethanol in a SI engine. They found that, both ethanol and methanol caused an increase of NOx compared to standard gasoline while HC gas were decreased."
10,As bunker fuel for ships,"6.3 As bunker fuel for ships The shipping industry is expected to review their current technology in the mix of bunker fuels due to strict regulations for the emissions releasing in Emission Control Areas. In order to reduce the released emissions to environment, light alcohols can be directly employed as a ship fuel. Fuels used in marine diesel engines are in two forms; liquid fuels such as methyl alcohol, biodiesel, bioliquid fuels and ethyl alcohol; gaseous based fuels such as natural gas, propane and hydrogen [132,133]. Although it has been seen some projects that using methanol on ship, any work has not been identified as fuel for ship engines [134]. Nevertheless, it is stated that up to 10% ethanol (E10) can be used for marine engine [135]."
11,Conversation to various ethers,"6.4 Conversation to various ethers Light alcohols can be converted into several ethers like methanol into methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), dimethyl ether (DME), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), dimethoxymethane (DMM) and ethanol into diethyl ether (DEE), dibutyl ether (DBE), tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) [136]. The MTBE and ETBE are utilized in SI engines to increase the octane number of gasoline fuel. Besides, the MTBE can be used as a gasoline blend to reduce emissions and pollution that [137,138]. Conventionally, the DME is manufactured in two steps where firstly syngas is converted to methanol, then by dehydration of methanol to DME [139,140]. It is possible to blend the DME with the LPG, replacing in heating and cooking applications of the LPG fuel, using in modified diesel engines and for power generation as an alternative fuel [137]. While Methanol-to-Gasoline (MTG) is not an ether, methanol is used in the process to produce Gasoline [82]. In addition, there are some works that the ethers have mostly been used as additives in diesel engines including the DME, MTBE, DMM, DMC, ETBE, TAEE and DEE [141–146]."
12,With biodiesel,"6.5 With biodiesel Biodiesel is known as a compound of fatty acid alkyl esters (FAME) which is obtained through the chemical reactions in the presence of alcohol and vegetable oil or animal fats. Despite, traditionally, methanol is employed for biodiesel production which is the product termed the FAME. Ethanol can be used as well [82,147]. In addition, other alcohols like butanol and propanol can be employed in the transesterification process to manufacture biodiesel as well but methanol and ethanol is the most widely used alcohol for the processes of biodiesel production [148–150]."
13,Other fuel applications,"6.6 Other fuel applications Light alcohols can also be employed as a fuel in power generation plants and in alcohol fuel cells [82,151–153]. Light alcohols are used in fuel cells because of favorable properties such as high efficiency, low toxicity and cost [153–155]."
14,Light alcohols in CI engines,"Light alcohols including methanol and ethanol have been considered as promising oxygenated additives in reduction of CO and NOx emissions [156,157]. In addition, many esters converted from methanol and ethanol have been used as additives with blending with diesel fuel in CI engine [141–146]. Physical and chemical properties give clues regarding behaviors of fuel in the combustion. Furthermore, all the parameters including engine performance, combustion quality and emission level are obtained as resulted of each feature. Light alcohol properties are different in comparison to diesel fuel in terms of cetane number, vaporization characteristics, boiling point, heating value and self-ignition temperature. The biggest difference between diesel and light alcohols is the oxygen level. Diesel has no oxygen atoms whereas methanol has 10% and ethanol has 50% of oxygen content by mass. Furthermore, lower heating value of vaporization of alcohols are considerably higher than conventional diesel fuel. higher heating value of vaporization is to cause lower the temperature of intake manifold and lead to a reduction of volumetric efficiency. As it can be also seen from the Table 4 , the cetane number of light alcohols are under 6 which does not meet the minimum requirement of cetane number. Therefore, it is not possible to use light alcohols as a single fuel in CI engine [158]. Apart from that, many works have been proposed light alcohols blending with conventional diesel as binary blend, with blending diesel-biodiesel mixture as ternary blend. The properties of diesel, methanol and ethanol are presented in Table 4."
15,Light alcohols/diesel blends,"7.1 Light alcohols/diesel blends 7.1.1 Studies on light alcohols and diesel blends Emiroğlu and Şen [165] used methanol, ethanol and butanol to diesel fuel to examine the effect of alcohol additions on combustion behavior, engine performance and exhaust emissions under varied engine loads and fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm. Alcohol addition was limited in 10 wt% for the blends. BSFC, NOx was increased with alcohol addition in the blend as BTE and CO was decreased. However, smoke formation was considerably reduced with alcohol addition. The peak values of CR and HRR were increased with alcohol addition compared to neat diesel fuel. Jia and Denbratt [166] examined combustion and emission parameters in a heavy duty diesel engine using three different methanol injection configurations (port injection during the intake manifold, direct injection during the intake stroke (DI_E) and direct injection during the compression stroke (DI_L)). The latter two methanol direct injection configurations were used in RCCI mode. The engine speed was fixed at 1500 rpm and the engine loads were varied. Due to operational difficulties, the tests were unable to operate for the methanol DI_E configuration. Authors stated that engine configurations were not showed any advantage over base diesel fuel in terms of BTE, HC and CO. However, it showed a reduction of CO2 and soot emissions when methanol was used by port injection and DI_L. The port configuration was lowered NOx emission at 12 bar IMEP whereas DI_L had no improvement. In addition, both the peak cylinder pressure (CP) and heat release rate (HRR) values were decreased with methanol for both of the configurations. Lee et al. [167] made an experimental investigation to reveal the effect of ethanol energy fraction on the combustion and emission characteristics under four different load conditions on dual-fuel operation using ethanol with conventional diesel fuel. The energy faction of ethanol in the blend was varied from to zero to nearly 50%. The engine speed was fixed at 1000 rpm and the engine load was varied from the IMEP of 0.2 up to 0.8 MPa. The author stated that increasing the ethanol fraction led to simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM emissions. On contrary, CO and HC emission were increased but this trend was decreased with increasing the ethanol fraction in the blended fuel. On the other hand, thermal efficiency was decreased when increased the ethanol fraction. The peak CP was decreased with increasing ethanol fraction at IMEP of 0.4 while the peak value was increased at IMEP of 0.8. The peak HRR was varied for IMEP 0.4 bar just as the peak value was increased for IMEP 0.8 bar. Taghizadeh-Alisaraei and Rezaei-Asl [168] added ethanol to standard diesel fuel and revealed the influences of the blends on engine performance, combustion, vibration and knocking on a 4-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engine with rotational speeds of 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, and 2000 rpm under full load modes. Ethanol was blended with diesel fuel in concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12% in volume and seven fuel blends were provided for the test. According to the results obtained from the test, increasing ethanol percentage more than %8 in volume is resulted in a prolonged ignition delay and irregularity of engine operation which means the cylinder pressure was risen so then results in a diesel engine knocking. Sayin [169] investigated the effects of the binary fuel blends consisting of ethanol-diesel and methanol-diesel on engine performance and emissions on a DI single cylinder, 4-stroke, aspirated diesel engine. The experimental tests were carried out under the two-different engine speed of 1000 rpm and 1800 rpm and the constant engine torque of 30 Nm. A decrement was observed on brake thermal efficiency, smoke opacity, CO and total hydrocarbon emissions of ethanol addition to diesel fuel despite it caused an increase in the formation of NOx emissions and in the brake specific fuel consumption. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) values were increased for both of the alcohols when engine fueled with alcohols/diesel mixtures. Hansdah and Murugan [170] performed an experimental investigation to reveal the impact of bioethanol fumigation on engine performance, combustion and emissions on a single cylinder, four strokes, fully loaded, air cooled, DI, diesel engine. Bioethanol was obtained by the fermentation of maduca indica flower. The bioethanol was injected at four different flow rates of 0.24, 0.48, 0.96 and 1.22 kg/h to the engine. The results of experimental tests indicated a reduction of smoke emission and brake specific of NOx. However, it led to a prolonged ignition delay of 2–3 °CA. The peak CP and HRR values were increased when alcohol quantities were increased. The highest CP was obtained when bioethanol was fumigated at the rate of 1.22 kg/h. Similarly, the highest HRR was found for the bioethanol fumigation of 1.22 kg/h. Ren et al. [171] conducted an experimental study to analyze the impacts of diesel-oxygenate blends on engine combustion and emissions in a DI diesel engine. Diesel fuel was selected as the base fuel while ethanol, diethyl carbonate, dimethoxymethane, diethyl adipate, dimethyl carbonate and diglyme and were used as the oxygenated additives. The results showed a reduction on the smoke concentration regardless of the types of oxygenate additives without a significant change on the NOx emission and exhaust gas temperatures when increasing the oxygen mass fraction in the blends. On the other hand, thermal efficiency was decreased for diesel/ethanol mixture. Abu-Qudais et al. [30] examined the effect of the fumigation and blend methods on engine performance and exhaust gas emissions using ethanol-diesel fuel on a single cylinder diesel engine. It was stated by the authors that the optimum ethanol concentration for the fumigation method is 20% in vol. which led to an increase of 7.5% in brake thermal efficiency and a reduction of 51% in soot mass concentration while it caused an increase of 55% in CO emission, 36% in HC emission. In addition, the author declared that the optimal blend percentage for ethanol-diesel fuel is 15% which resulted in an increase of 3.6% in brake thermal efficiency, 43.3% in CO emission and 34% in HC while it was a reduction of 32% in soot mass concentration. Putrasari et al. [172] performed a study on the application of diesel and ethanol blends at engine loads of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 Nm and ethanol concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% on a DI, two-cylinder, diesel engine. The authors stated that it was an increase on the engine power and the indicated mean effective pressure and a reduction on HC, smoke and CO emissions with increasing of ethanol percentage while a decrement was found on brake specific fuel consumption. Besides, the lubricating oil temperature was risen with increasing ethanol. Finally, exhaust gas temperature values were decreased with increasing ethanol fraction in the blend. Júnior and Martins [173] evaluated the influence of port injection on a diesel engine. The test used fuels were diesel as direct injection and ethanol as port injection and the experiment was carried out at compression ratios of 14:1, 16:1 and 17:1 in dual-fuel mode. It was reported that NOx emissions were decreased up to 60%. Exhaust gas temperature was decreased for ethanol included blends. In similar way, the peak CP was increased for ethanol/diesel test blend. Najafi and Yusaf [174] analyzed the effects of engine performance using the blends of methanol-diesel in a diesel engine. The fuels were provided with 10%, 20% and 30% of methanol in volume. The lowest exhaust temperature was observed with methanol usage of 10% and brake thermal efficiency was improved for all the blends. In the meantime, effective brake power and torque for the binary blends were also increased. On the other hand, EGT values were decreased compared to pure diesel. An experiment performed by Wei et al. [6] to reveal the effects of premixed methanol-diesel blends on engine combustion and exhaust gas emission characteristics of a 6-cylinder turbocharged, inter-cooling diesel engine. The fumigation method was used to inject methanol to the cylinder. The maximum premixed ratio was tested over 70% of methanol. It was reported that it was a significant increase in HC, CO, NO2 and formaldehyde emissions with increasing premixed ratio of methanol while dry soot emissions and NOx were considerably decreased. Furthermore, the compression pressures and heat release rate values were lower than base diesel and decreased with increasing methanol quantity. Lastly, exhaust gas temperatures were lower and in decreasing trend with high methanol proportion. Gnanamoorthi and Devaradjane [175] studied the impact of five different ethanol-diesel blends on engine performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of a naturally aspirated single cylinder, 4-stroke, DI, diesel engine at different engine loads and compression ratios of 17.5:1, 18.5:1 and 19.5:1. However, 1% of ethyl acetate and 1% diethyl carbonate were added to the blend. The results of the experimental tests indicated that the brake thermal efficiency was risen with high percentage of ethanol in the test blends at full load. Likewise, the combustion and performance of engine were enhanced with the increase in compression ratio and ethanol percentage. Furthermore, HC, CO and smoke emissions were decreased considerably while there was an increase in NOx emissions. Even if ethanol had a fluctuating compression pressure figure, the peak value was almost met at the same pressure. However, the peak HRR was higher than that of diesel fuel. Sayin et al. [176] analyzed the influences of different injection pressure and timing on engine performance and exhaust emissions on a direct injection diesel engine using methanol (5, 10 and 15%v/v) blended-diesel fuels. The experiments were performed on three different injection pressures of 180, 200 and 220 bar and timings of 15, 20 and 25 °CA BTDC and engine load and speed of 20 Nm and 2200 rpm. BSFC and NOx were increased as BTE, smoke opacity, CO and THC emissions were reduced with the increased amount of methanol in the fuel blend. Jamrozik et al. [177] evaluated the effect of addition of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol to diesel fuel in the percentage of 15, 30, 45, 55 and 70% of total energy supplied on a stationary single-cylinder compression ignition dual-fuel engine to compare the combustion process, performance and emission results. Experimental results obtained from the engine showed that thermal efficiency was increased for methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel blends blend compared to standard diesel fuel. On the contrary, NOx, CO and CO2 emissions were increased for alcohol included blends and alcohol addition to the test fuel was led no significant changes of HC emissions. However, the peak CP, HRR and EGT values were obtained higher than that of diesel when alcohol was added to the blend until alcohol proportion was 55%. Above that proportion, the increase was turned into a reduction. Bayraktar [178] investigated the impacts of diesel-methanol blends with using dodecanol on a CI engine under compression ratios of 19, 21, 23 and 25 and the engine speed ranges of 1000 and 1600 rpm. The methanol was blended with diesel fuel in percentages of 2.5 to 15% with the increments of 2.5%, and 1% dodecanol addition to avoid phase separation. The author stated that the blend including 10% of methanol was the most effective fuel among all the test blends and methanol improved the engine effective power. Also, the BSFC was declined with increasing of methanol at low engine speeds and the BTE was improved at high engine speed conditions in comparison with neat diesel fuel. Cheng et al. [179] made an investigation using methanol up to 30% in the blends on a 4-cylinder, DI, diesel engine with fumigation methanol injected into the intake air of each cylinder running at speed of 1800 rev/min and BMEP of 0.08 MPa, 0.19 MPa, 0.38 MPa, 0.56 MPa and 0.67 MPa. A considerable increase in HC, CO, and NO2 emissions were observed while NOx, PM and smoke emissions were declined at nearly full loads. The BTE was diminished corresponding to the increase in the methanol percentage at low load conditions while the BTE was increased at high loads. Zhang et al. [180] used the fumigation method for methanol-diesel test fuels on a naturally-aspirated, water-cooled, four-cylinder, DI, diesel engine to reveal the influences on combustion and emissions at the engine speed of 1920 rpm, and BMEP of 0.13, 0.27, 0.40, 0.53 and 0.63 MPa. Methanol was used in proportions of 10, 20 and 30% in volume with standard diesel fuel. Fuel consumption was declined for the blends as particulate mass was reduced at medium and high engine load. The peak cylinder pressures were almost at the same value with diesel fuel at low engine load while it was higher at high engine loads. Additionally, the peak HRR was increased for methanol included blends. Yao et al. [181] performed an investigation to reveal the impacts of diesel/methanol compound combustion system using oxidation catalytic converter under different engine loads and running at the engine speeds of 2200 and 3200 rpm. Diesel/methanol compound combustion system (DMCC) is a method to burn pure diesel fuel alone or a combination of diesel and methanol in a diesel engine. However, it is similar to fumigation method but injection system is different. Methanol was injected into the cylinder by the intake port in order to make a homogeneous mixture with air while the main fuel injections were retained [161]. The tests indicate that, the DMCC was caused to a reduction of smoke and NOx emissions but HC and CO emission were increased. With using oxidation catalytic converter, NOx, CO, HC and smoke emissions were declined simultaneously. The peak CR and HRR were increased compared to base diesel fuel while EGT values were decreased with methanol addition. Liu et al. [182] conducted a study on effects of a methanol/diesel dual-fuel system on engine performance and emissions in a single cylinder, DI, diesel engine using diesel fuel as pilot fuel. Methanol mass fraction was from 20% to 85% of the blends. The experimental test results indicated that reductions in NOx and smoke emissions were observed while HC and CO emissions were increased. Moreover, the BTE were lowered at low load conditions while this effect was contrary at high loads. The main conclusions of studies that the view the performance and emissions variations for light alcohols and diesel are presented in Table 5 . 7.1.2 Summary The above literature on the usage of light alcohols and diesel blends revealed the following points: • The blends of light alcohols and diesel can be used in CI engines without any changes at low concentrations. • Light alcohols decrease fuel-air ratio as increasing its content in the blend. • As the studies summarized in Table 5, the SSP (smoke, soot or particulate matter) decreases for all the studies regardless of alcohol quantity in the mixture. It is due to the presence of oxygen content derived from alcohols prevent to happen the rich combustion zone and contribute the soot oxidation in the combustion. • Overall, exhaust gas temperature increases with light alcohol addition to diesel fuel. • Increased alcohol proportion in the mixture causes a reduction of cetane number which causes to a longer ignition delay and this increases knocking tendency. • Generally, as with increasing alcohols content up to 40% in the blends, CO emission is reduced for ethanol and methanol while higher proportions caused higher CO emission for methanol. • BSFC increases for light alcohols. Alcohols have around 2 times lower energy value than diesel fuel. Therefore, the engine consumes more fuel to meet the energy from the blends. • Using esters have a reduction effect on smoke concentration. • The ignition delay prolonged by 2–3 °CA with ethanol fumigation into engine at full load. • EGT increases for light alcohols and diesel blends in general. Higher exhaust gas temperature influences the formation of the emission parameters. Especially, NOx gases form on the condition of the higher temperature in combustion chamber. Higher exhaust temperatures result in more formation of NOx. • Using additive like dodecanol prevents the phase separation. • Higher injection pressure improves the fuel-air mixture and leads to more complete combustion. • There is no clear trend on NOx, CO, HC, CP and HRR and both increases and decreases for above the parameters mentioned being reported for the usage of light alcohols in diesel engines. • Advancing ignition time results in an earlier start of combustion. • At high premixed ratios of methanol, ignition delay is prolonged but the combustion duration is shortened. • The BTE decreases for high ethanol content while it leads an increase in the BSFC. Besides, as the compression ratio is increased for methanol, the BTE is improved and the BTE is increased with fumigation of methanol or ethanol. But as comprehensively summarized, the BTE decreases for the most of studies listed in Table 5. Generally, alcohols have a direct impact on combustion behavior due to its considerable amount of oxygen content and higher latent heat of vaporization. Thanks to more oxygen supplied to the combustion by alcohols that inherently have in the its structure, alcohols lead to more combustion."
16,Light alcohol/biodiesel blends,"7.2 Light alcohol/biodiesel blends The physical and chemical properties of conventional diesel, methanol and ethanol are given in Table 6 . 7.2.1 Studies on light alcohols and biodiesel blends Anand et al. [184] made an experimental investigation to find out the impact of methanol on engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics of neat karanji biodiesel in a diesel engine. The tests were conducted at full load on a DI turbocharged, multi-cylinder truck diesel engine. 10% of methanol was blended with biodiesel. HC and CO emissions were slightly higher than those of diesel at low loads. CO emission had a significant reduction at high load condition for the methanol blend. Similarly, significant reductions were observed for NOx and smoke emissions for the methanol included blend. However, EGT and the peak CR values of methanol/diesel mixture were decreased compared to diesel fuel while the peak HRR was increased. A study made by Lu et al. [185] and they revealed that ignition timing of overall combustion start was significantly delayed with ethanol addition to cylinder by port injection while maximum heat release rate was increased slightly. The experimental tests were conducted on a DI single-cylinder, 4-stroke, natural aspirated diesel engine and running at a constant engine speed of 1800 rpm and different premixed ratios. The authors stated that efficiency was declined with increasing of ethanol addition in the leaner blends while the thermal efficiency was improved in the rich blends. Furthermore, NOx and smoke emissions were remarkably diminished under overall engine operations while CO and HC emissions were increased compared to neat biodiesel fuel. Finally, they stated that peak values of CR and the maximum EGT were decreased while the peak value of HRR was increased with increasing ethanol ratio in the blend. Zheng et al. [183] studied to compare biodiesel/n-butanol, biodiesel/ethanol and biodiesel/2,5-dimethylfuran blends with neat biodiesel and diesel fuel on a modified single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. The investigations were performed at three exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates (0, 30% and 50%), three engine loads (20, 40 and 60 mg/cycle diesel fuel) and two blending ratios (20% and 50%). According to the authors, reductions were observed in smoke emissions for pure biodiesel and other three binary blends in comparison to neat diesel fuel and it was stated that ethanol has more ability to reduce smoke emissions. Ethanol included blends exhibited less NOx emissions compared to diesel fuel while pure biodiesel, Bu20 and DMF20 released more NOx emissions. HC and CO emissions of the binary fuels were higher than those of diesel fuel at low load, but lower than diesel at higher loads. Thermal efficiency was decreased for E20 at low and medium loads and all the EGR rates while it was increased at high loads and all the EGR rates. The peak CR value of E20 was almost equal with diesel fuel and the HRR trace was almost observed the same for E20 (20% ethanol and 80% diesel) at low and EGR conditions while the peak values were increased at high EGR conditions. Subbaiah and Godal [186] made an investigation to display the effects of biodiesel and ethanol on engine performance and emission characteristics of a DI single cylinder diesel engine. The tests were performed at different engine loads of 0–100% and at ethanol ratios of 2.5, 5 and 7.5% v/v. The experimental test results indicated that, the BTE was improved while the BSFC was deteriorated when the ethanol percentage and engine load were increased. CO emissions were deceased at ratios of 2.5 and 5% of ethanol. HC and NOx emissions were reduced under all engine load modes while smoke emissions were slightly increased. Additionally, the maximum values of EGT for ethanol blends were increased. Li et al. [187] performed a study using methanol and biodiesel fuels in a diesel engine to evaluate the effects on performance and emissions. The tests were conducted on a 4-cylinder, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine and at engine speed of 1800 rpm and 3000 rpm with 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% engine loads. Besides, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, 2-methoxyethyl ether and cyclohexyl nitrate were added to the blends to improve the cetane number and biodiesel was mixed with methanol by 10%. Especially, at high engine speeds, NOx and smoke emissions were reduced for all the blends while it was observed that the increment in HC and CO emissions. Meanwhile, there were not significant changes for brake thermal efficiency. Maximum EGT and the peak CP and HRR values were increased with addition of cetane improver. Cheng et al. [188] revealed the influences of biodiesel and methanol blends using emulsification and fumigation methods on a 4-cylinder naturally aspirated, DI, diesel engine. 10% of methanol was blended with biodiesel under operating at the engine speed of 1800 rpm and 5 different BMEP. The results of the experiments showed the reductions in CO2, NOx and PM emissions for both methods. However, it was observed a considerable increment of CO and HC emissions when using fumigation method as there were no significant changes in CO and HC emissions on emulsion method. The BTE was slightly increased for both methods but the fumigation method was remarkably increased the BTE at medium and high loads. Table 7 shows the summarized results of engine performance and exhaust gas emission characteristics of light alcohols and biodiesel blends. 7.2.2 Summary The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: • Ignition delay was slightly retarded in a limited value of 1 °CA with usage of low fraction of ethanol. • The assessment of cylinder pressure, heat release rate and combustion temperature provides the basic knowledge regarding the combustion process. The maximum cylinder pressure is variable but the maximum heat release rate increases with the addition of light alcohols. Ignition time and duration are highly depended on fuel characteristic which affects the peak cylinder pressure, heat release rate and temperature. Higher auto ignition temperature and low cetane number of light alcohols prolongs the ignition duration and results in a significant impact on combustion behavior in the chamber. • Remarkable reductions in the SSP were observed for light alcohol-biodiesel blends even with methanol under the EGR rates of 0, 30 and 50%. • The brake thermal efficiency was improved corresponding to increasing engine load for methanol-biodiesel blends. The BTE was increased for ethanol blends at high loads. overall, the thermal efficiency increases for light alcohols along with biodiesel blends. • At EGR rates of 0, 30 and 50%, and at low loads, methanol led to a significant decline in the BTE for methanol-containing blends while at all EGR rates and medium and high loads, there was an increase. • NOx and the SSO emissions decreases for alcohol addition in regardless of its quantity in the blends. On the other hand, such a clear trend is not the case for CO and HC gases. DEE has a fluctuating effect on these gases. • Using methanol/biodiesel blends at low ratios caused a slight delay in the start of dynamic injection and the onset of combustion. • NOx and CO levels were decreased with EGR increasing for methanol-biodiesel blends • The CO, NOx and SSP were declined with biodiesel usage with light alcohols. Oxygenated fuels such as methanol and ethanol have lower stoichiometric air/fuel ratios. Thus, Increasing alcohol fraction in the blend results in leaner combustion condition due to partially oxidized nature of alcohols to hydrocarbons. The usage of light alcohols along with biodiesel enables a higher oxygen zone in combustion chamber and lead to form less exhaust emission gases in the combustion process. • Combustion was completed earlier in the leaner blends of ethanol/biodiesel whereas the start of combustion was delayed for the leaner blends of ethanol/biodiesel. • With addition of cetane number improvers such as 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, 2-methoxyethyl ether and cyclohexyl nitrate, ignition delay was shortened for 1–3 °CA and the combustion duration was retarded for 1–6 °CA."
17,Light alcohol/diesel/biodiesel/DEE blends,"7.3 Light alcohol/diesel/biodiesel/DEE blends Table 8 shows the physical and chemical properties of light alcohols, biodiesel, diesel and diethyl ether. 7.3.1 Studies on light alcohols, diesel, biodiesel and DEE blends Venu and Madhavan [189] compared the ternary fuel blends (light alcohols-biodiesel-diesel) by adding diethyl ether (DEE) as ignition enhancer on a single cylinder diesel engine at a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm. The test blends were made of 5 and 10% of DEE in ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends (EBD) and methanol-biodiesel-diesel blend (MBD) with the ratios of 20/40/40 (% v/v). MBD-10DEE was properly unable to run at high loads due to high viscosity. The DEE in the EBD blends increased the BSFC and prolonged the combustion duration while reductions in PM, NOx and smoke emissions were observed. Besides, the DEE addition to MBD resulted in increases in the PM, CO, CO2 and smoke emissions while BSFC and combustion duration were lowered. The EBD-10DEE blend caused increases in cylinder pressure, heat release rate and exhaust gas temperature. The peak values of CR were higher for ethanol/diesel mixture with high DEE addition while the peak values of alcohol/diesel blends were decreased with low DEE addition in comparison with diesel test fuel. The peak HRR values of ethanol/diesel mixture were increased with 5% DEE addition while the peak values were almost the same value for 10% DEE addition of ethanol/diesel mixture. Maximum EGT values were decreased for all the blends expect only for methanol included blend at high load. Table 9 shows the comparison of engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics of light alcohols and biodiesel blends. 7.3.2 Summary Based on the studies mentioned above, major findings were summarized below: • It is possible to use both ethanol-diesel-biodiesel-DEE up to 10% of DEE and methanol-diesel-biodiesel-DEE blends up to 5% of DEE in CI engines without any modification with a better engine performance and minimal emissions. • A methanol-diesel-biodiesel-DEE (20:40:40% v/v with 10% DEE) fuel was unable to run in engine owing to its high viscous structure. • The BSFC was minimum for MBD-5DEE despite a slight increase for both of the EBD-DEE fuels. • It can be clearly seen that using DEE in the blend among with light alcohols, diesel and biodiesel deteriorates CO, CO2 and HC emissions for all the blends. Contrarily, it reduces NOx emission and these is no clear trend with DEE addition for CP, HRR, SSP and BSFC. • A considerable reduction on in-cylinder pressure was obtained for MBD-5DEE at engine load ranges of 25 to 75%, even as EBD-10DEE fuel at all loads. • The EGT increases with the blend of light alcohols, diesel, biodiesel and DEE for the all the conditions. Lower temperature in the cylinder drops the probability of oxygen to react with exhaust gases. Also, lower temperature deteriorates the combustion and results in more incomplete combustion and hence contribute formation of more exhaust emissions."
18,Light alcohols/diesel/biodiesel blends,"7.4 Light alcohols/diesel/biodiesel blends Table 10 shows the physical and chemical properties of the test fuels consisting of light alcohols (methanol, ethanol), biodiesel and diesel fuel. 7.4.1 Studies on light alcohols, diesel and biodiesel blends Alptekin [190] used ethanol and isopropanol as an additive to display the impact of alcohols in a turbocharged, intercooled, four stroke, water cooled, common rail direct injection engine. The tests were operated at three engine speeds of 1500, 2000 and 2500 rpm and four partial engine load of BMEP: 3.3, 5.0, 6.6 and 8.3 bar. Alcohols were blended with pure diesel fuel in the percentage of 15 in volume basis. According to the test results, the BSFC, HC, NOx and CO emissions were increased compared to pure diesel fuel. maximum cylinder pressure was obtained for alcohol included blends and maximum HRR values were close for each fuel. Yilmaz [20] conducted an investigation using biodiesel-alcohol-diesel blends of 45:10:45 and 40:20:40 ratios in volume on a single cylinder diesel engine. The test results indicated that the brake specific fuel consumption, HC and CO emissions were deteriorated compared to conventional diesel fuel while NOx levels were lowered. Methanol was found more effective compared to ethanol for reducing of HC and CO emissions whereas NOx emissions were reduced in the presence of ethanol. The maximum EGT values were obtained for ethanol/biodiesel/diesel blend. Guarieiro et al. [191] investigated the emission characteristics of ternary fuels containing the blends of biodiesel, ethanol and diesel in a diesel engine. The blends were diesel/ethanol (90/10 %v/v), diesel/ethanol/soybean biodiesel (80/15/5 %v/v), diesel/ethanol/castor biodiesel (80/15/5 %v/v), diesel/ethanol/residual biodiesel (80/15/5 %v/v), diesel/ethanol/castor oil (90/7/3 %v/v) and diesel/ethanol/soybean oil (90/7/3 %v/v). The tests were carried out at constant engine speed of 1800 and 2000 rpm and at engine loads of 2, 4, 6, and 8 kW. For all the ternary test blend fuels, a decline was observed in CO2 emissions in the ranges of 5–24% and 4–6% and no significant change was occurred in CO emissions. Except from the diesel/ethanol blends, NOx emissions were decreased. Randazzo and Sodre [192] used diesel-soybean biodiesel and ethanol to reveal the impact of the cold starting fuel consumption on a four cylinders, 63 kW power, diesel engine. it was reported that the cold start time was increased with increasing of ethanol content in the blend. However, specific fuel consumption had an increase effect with increasing of ethanol content while biodiesel containing fuels had no changes. Fang et al. [193] made an investigation to find out the effect of ethanol–diesel–biodiesel blends on engine combustion and emission parameters in premixed low temperature combustion condition on a four-cylinder diesel engine. As a result of the tests, ethanol–diesel–biodiesel blends had lower NOx emission compared to diesel fuel because of lower combustion temperature (LCT). Meanwhile, the LCT was also caused an increment of HC and CO emissions. In addition, smoke emissions were decreased for ethanol blends. The maximum CR value of ethanol included blends were lower than those of neat diesel fuel and the maximum HRR was occurred further away from top dead center and increased with increasing ethanol content in the blend. Kwanchareon et al. [11] studied the solubility and emission characteristics of a diesel–biodiesel–ethanol blend in a diesel engine at four engine loads of 0, 30, 60, and 100%. Authors stated that, phase separation was crucial below 20 °C and inter solubility of the blend was decreased when the temperature was increased. They observed significant reductions in HC and CO emissions at high engine load while NOx emissions were increased in comparison to those of diesel fuel. The optimal fuel properties and emission values were obtained for the blend of diesel (80%)-biodiesel (15%)-ethanol (5%). Pang et al. [194] examined the characteristics of carbonyl emissions on a diesel engine using ethanol–biodiesel–diesel (5:20:75 in vol.) blends. The ternary blend was produced lower formaldehyde emission as compared to diesel fuel owing to low aliphatic hydrocarbons in the mixture fuel. However, ethanol addition caused more acetaldehyde emissions. In addition, the ternary blend was slightly caused more NOx emissions whereas considerably released less PM and THC emissions as compared to conventional diesel fuel. The maximum EGT of ethanol–biodiesel–diesel blend was lower than that of pure diesel test fuel. Randazzo and Sodré [195] experimented the influences of soybean biodiesel-diesel blends with ethanol addition in proportion of 2% and 5% in a diesel powered passenger vehicle. The result showed that with increasing of biodiesel percentage, CO2 and NOx emissions were increased, whereas HC, CO and PM emissions were lower compared to diesel fuel. Ethanol addition to the binary fuels could be kept in reduction of NOx while along with reducing CO2 emission concentration. However, more comprehensive researches are required due to increasing of CO, HC and PM emissions. Botero et al. [196] made a test using biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blends in a well-characterized droplet, high temperature combustion chamber. Results showed that adding ethanol to biodiesel-diesel blends was led the extent of soot formation and increased the overall fuel consumption. Barabás et al. [197] experimented the diesel–biodiesel–bioethanol blends to indicate the engine performance and emission parameters in a diesel engine at the 1400 rpm engine speed and at engine loads of low, medium and high rate. Brake specific fuel consumption was increased by 31.4% at low loads and the brake thermal efficiency was deteriorated up to 21.7%. CO emission was reduced up to 59% at high loads. NOx emissions were slightly increased at partial and high loads as HC and smoke emissions were deceased at all the engine loads. Fernando et al. [198] compared the emission characteristics of the ternary fuel blends containing biodiesel–ethanol–diesel in ratios of 70:25:5, 70:20:10, and 70:15:15 in vol. in various diesel engines including old and new engines. Experimental results showed that a reduction in NOx emission with ethanol percentage in the new engine as an increment in the old engine. However, with increasing ethanol percentage in the blends, CO emission were risen both in the old and new engines. Chhenkachorn and Fungtammasan [199] made an experimental study on engine performance and emission characteristics in a light-duty truck with a 2.5L inter-cooled, DI, diesel engine using 84.00% percentage of diesel, 0.25% hydrous percentage of ethanol, 4.75% percentage of anhydrous ethanol, and 11.00% percentage of biodiesel. The blend fuel had no significant changes in NOx and CO2 emissions and BSFC. Besides, it was released lower PM and CO emissions in comparison to regular diesel. Yilmaz et al. [200] mixed biodiesel–diesel blends with addition 3%, 5%, 15% and 25% of ethanol to analyze the effect of alcohol blended fuel concentration on diesel emissions. Overall, ethanol addition was increased CO emission for all operation conditions, whereas ethanol was both caused a reduction in NO emissions and unburned HC emissions depending on the ethanol concentrations and operating conditions. Overall, high ethanol percentage was caused increases in HC emissions. Ethanol blended fuels were showed a slightly higher exhaust gas temperature. Hulwan and Joshi [28] conducted a test on performance, emission and combustion characteristic of ternary blends in presence of high amount of ethanol on a multi-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. The fuels were prepared with different diesel–ethanol–biodiesel ratios of 70/20/10, 50/30/20, 50/40/10 in vol. and standard diesel fuel. The BSFC was deteriorated while the BTE was improved in the presence of high amount of ethanol. Smoke emission was remarkably reduced at high loads and CO emissions were increased at low loads. Additionally, the peak CP value was lower than that of base diesel fuel at low loads while the peak values were almost the same. The peak HRR was obtained for ethanol blended fuels and that trend was increased with increasing ethanol percentage in the mixture. Qi et al. [201] used biodiesel-methanol-diesel blends to examine the impacts on engine performance, combustion and emissions of a diesel engine under variable engine speeds and loads. The blend was prepared with 50% of biodiesel and 50% of diesel fuel. Then 5% and 10% of methanol were added to the biodiesel-diesel blend. The authors found that there was a remarkable reduction in smoke emission while CO emission was slightly reduced. Besides, the trend of HC and NOx emissions were obtained similar to the biodiesel-diesel blends. In addition, combustion start was delayed for methanol additive fuels at low engine loads but was nearly the same at high loads. The torque and power were lower than that of the binary blend. The maximum values of CP of methanol blended fuels were lower than that of biodiesel/diesel mixture and the maximum value of HRR was obtained for the blend of low ratio of methanol blend. Žaglinskis et al. [202] performed an investigation using biodiesel-diesel blends with addition methanol (10%v/v) on a commercial 1.9 TDI 1Z compression ignition (diesel) engine loaded in wide range BMEP of 0.236–1.203 MPa and four speed regimes in range of 2000–3500 min−1. The experimental test results indicated that, the BSFC was deteriorated while the BTE was improved. However, CO, HC and soot emissions were decreased by 8%, 32% and 22%, respectively for the blend without addition of methanol whereas the reductions for methanol blended fuel were 13%, 18% and 45%, respectively. The maximum cylinder pressure and exhaust gas temperature of methanol blended fuel was lower than that of diesel test fuel and the maximum HRR value was obtained for methanol/diesel/biodiesel mixture. Yasin et al. [203] conducted a study using the ternary blends of biodiesel-methanol-diesel with ratios of 20:5:75 and 20:10:70 as the ternary blends and 20:80 for biodiesel-diesel in vol. The tests were carried out in a multi-cylinder diesel engine under the steady operating conditions at 20%, 40% and 60% of engine loads to analyze performance and emissions of the experimental blends. As increasing the concentration of methanol in the ternary blends, NO emission was risen whereas CO emission was reduced. Additionally, it was declared that %5 of methanol was more effective for reduction of CO emission. Moreover, exhaust gas temperatures of methanol blended fuels were slightly higher than that of base diesel fuel. Cheung et al. [204] carried out a study on a diesel engine using biodiesel, diesel fuel and biodiesel fuels blended with methanol of 5, 10 and 15% in vol. under different engine loads of 0.08 MPa, 0.2 MPa, 0.38 MPa, 0.55 MPa, and 0.70 MPa at a steady speed of 1800 rpm to investigate the engine performance and emissions of the blended fuels. The results indicated that the BSFC was worsened while the BTE was improved for the blends as compared to standard diesel. Also, NOx and PM emissions were decreased while CO and HC emissions were increased. Finally, the maximum EGT values of methanol included fuels were slightly lower than that of diesel fuel. Zhu et al. [32] tested diesel-biodiesel blends with 5%, 10% and 15% of light alcohols at five engine loads and at a steady speed of 1800 rpm on a 4-cylinder naturally-aspirated, DI, diesel engine. It was concluded that the methanol blends reduced PM and NOx emissions despite releasing more HC and CO emissions compared to the blends included ethanol. As a result, increasing the percentage of alcohols in the blends reduced NOx and PM concentrations. Guarieiro et al. [205] compared the various oxygenated fuels like ethanol (%5) with conventional diesel fuel to reveal the emission characteristics of those test blends on a two-cylinder DI diesel engine at steady load condition of 70% and at speed rate of 1800 rpm. Ethanol presence was 6% in the ternary mixture and it was also added 5% of soybean oil biodiesel and %89 of diesel fuel to the mixture. CO, CO2 and NOx emissions were decreased for the ternary blend while HC emission was increased compared to other test fuels. Geo et al. [206] performed an experimental investigation on a single cylinder diesel engine using rubber seed oil and its biodiesel along with ethanol as injected fuel at a fixed speed of 1500 rev/min and at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of full load. As increasing the amount of the injected ethanol, the BTE was improved while smoke emission was reduced along with an increase in HC, CO and NOx emissions in comparison to conventional diesel fuel. An increase in ethanol energy share was reduced the exhaust gas temperature. Keskin and Yaşar [207] conducted an investigation using ternary blends of diesel, methanol and biodiesel ratios of 50:47:3 and 50:44:6 in vol. on a single cylinder, DI, diesel engine at full load conditions. The BSFC was increased for the two ternary blends and high concentration of methanol was much effective for declining of NOx and CO emissions as compared to low concentration of methanol blend while NOx emissions were increased compared to neat diesel. The summary of the results of the studies on performance and emissions for biodiesel/diesel/light alcohol blends is presented in Table 11 . 7.4.2 Summary Based on the studies mentioned above, the following information can be inferred: • Light alcohols with blends of biodiesel and diesel can be used in CI engines without any changes. • The addition of 2% of ethanol in the biodiesel/diesel mixture led no significant changes on the BSFC. Moreover, the BSFC was increased almost for all the tests. The maximum lower heating value of diesel (42.6 Mj/kg) is 2.17 times higher than methanol (19.6 Mj/kg) and 1.59 times higher than ethanol (26.79 Mj/kg). Even if the lower heating value of biodiesel is slightly higher compared to pure diesel fuel, the engine consumes more fuels to meet the same power output when fueled with light alcohols/biodiesel/diesel blends. Because the average heating of ternary blends remains low. • Increasing ethanol concentration in the blend caused increased cold start timing. • Generally, the BTE was improved with the increasing usage of light alcohols. Both biodiesel and light alcohols have a significant amount of oxygen content. As for the combustion efficiency, both of the high oxygen content of biodiesel and light alcohols that chemically inherited in their molecular structure is to promote the combustion efficiency. • The ternary blends emitted lower exhaust gas emissions and the BTE was progressed in LTC mode in the presence of ethanol up to 20%. • Additionally, due to the high oxygen content of the ethanol, reductions were observed on smoke emission which enabled more exhaust gas circulation tolerances in rich conditions. • The acetaldehyde emissions were increased due to the presence of ethanol in the blends. • The hydrated ethanol caused to the phase separation caused by water content that exits in its molecular compounds. • The SSP was lowered nearly for all the test fuels containing light alcohols regardless of the concentration in the blends. As mentioned earlier, the oxygenated fuels (biodiesel and alcohols) have been found responsible for reductions on the SSP. Furthermore, the mixing and burning rate of light alcohol are higher in comparison with diesel fuel. In the presence of abundant amount of oxygen mass concentration (both from light alcohols and biodiesel), the SSP emissions decrease owing to oxidation of soot nuclei during the combustion. • Oleic acid could be added to prevent the phase separation for high methanol fraction of the ternary blends. • Increasing methanol concentration in the mixture caused a delayed combustion start at low loads. • Ignition delay was prolonged in the presence of ethanol and methanol in the blend due to low cetane number of light alcohols."
19,Conclusions and recommendations,"Light alcohols (methanol, ethanol) are among the most promising alternative resources in terms of their low emissions and low costs to replace the conventional fuels. The production of light alcohols is mostly made through renewable sources so it makes more valuable and easier to meet the demand in case of its excessive usage. In the current paper, a comprehensive overview was made to display favorable and adverse outcomes of light alcohols. Overall, conclusions are summarized as follows: • Light alcohols can be used in CI engines as the single, dual or trio fuel without any engine modifications but the ideal proportion of alcohol in the blend varies, depending on combustion mode, engine load and blending method. • Overall, at high engine loads, combustion efficiency is higher in the presence of alcohol in the mixture. On the other hand, efficiency diminishes at low loads. • The fumigation method gives better combustion results than the other blending methods. • Knocking tendency increases when the engine is fueled with high proportion of alcohols due to lower cetane number of alcohols. • Engine consumes more fuel in the presence of light alcohols in the mixture owing to low heat value of alcohols to meet the demand energy in comparison with diesel fuel. • High content of methanol and ethanol with diesel results in an improvement of the SSP and HC emissions while brake specific fuel consumption is negatively affected and sometimes brake thermal efficiency. • Alcohols/Biodiesel blends generally results in a decline of CO, NOx and SSP emissions and improved combustion efficiency. • Ternary fuels gave better thermal efficiency compared to neat diesel fuel while the SSP was lowered almost for every test. The authors suggest that a third additive such as dodecanol and oleic acid which can be used in the blends of light alcohols-included blends to boost the properties of the mixture in the combustion chamber and lower the pollutant emissions. Besides, different combustion modes such as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), low temperature combustion (LTC), homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) are necessary to be done with these fuels in CI engines in order to extent the wide of their usage. However, further developments are necessary to be made for design of engine fueled with light alcohols and the storage of vehicle and a decision has to be made regarding how many (single, dual or trio) fuels will be used in the vehicle and also which type of the fuel can be used by certain vehicle types is needed to be addressed for their future use. As the environmental effects seem quite well, economic aspect of light alcohols need to be done to demonstrate its accurate potential as well."
