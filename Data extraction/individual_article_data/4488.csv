0,Introduction,"Functional aromatic amines are one of the most important intermediates and are widely used in dyes, agrochemicals and pharmaceutical synthesis [1,2]. They can be prepared by reductive amination [3], reduction of nitriles [4,5] and direct amination of alcohols [6,7]. The challenge for these methods is the selectivity of nitroarene reduction due to the influence of the multiple unsaturated functional groups of accessible nitroarenes, which presents a serious obstacle to realizing the specific selective hydrogenation of nitro groups. Although various catalysts have been designed and synthesized for achieving highly efficient and selective hydrogenation of nitro groups [8,9], some of them still face considerable difficulties and challenges in practical production, including limited substrate scope, depletion of conventional energy and the danger of handling high-pressure hydrogen gas as a hydrogen source. In recent years, simulating enzymes in nature and using clean energy to realize chemical transformations under mild environmental conditions have been widely researched [10–13]. To attain the high efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic systems, chemists have used metal-organic hosts with defined hydrophobic cavities to mimic the remarkable properties of enzyme pockets for catalysing unique chemical transformations [14–19]. On the other hand, nature has developed untold millions of redox systems, in which redox processes are catalysed by numerous species of enzymes in the presence of the corresponding cofactors [20–23]. Among these cofactors, as a coenzyme, quinhydrone (QHQ) can effectively transfer electrons and protons through redox cycling between its oxidation state and reduced state [24]. Recently, we constructed an artificial charge-transfer complex system by encapsulating a QHQ cofactor for the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen in combination with the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene [25]. This previous study discussed that the formation of host-guest systems and changes in the overpotential of the metal sites influenced the efficiency of the light-driven hydrogen production and the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. The results indicated that the cobalt-based metal-organic triangular prism with CH2 centres has prominent advantages for the formation of host-guest systems and catalytic performance. In this work, the intrinsic redox potential of the cobalt-based metal-organic triangular prism, the electron transfer of QHQ outside the cavity and the reduction selectivity of nitro compounds were considered. By introducing four strong ONP chelators on the CH2-centred ligand to replace the previously reported ONN chelators, we assembled herein a new redox-active cobalt-based metal-organic triangular prism host with a suitable redox potential, and the catalytic performance was evaluated (Fig. 1 ). We envisioned that the introduction of coordinated phosphorus atoms would help shift the redox potentials of the coordinated metal sites to more negative potentials, and these donor atoms could be engineered into this new complex to accelerate the photocatalytic hydrogen generation in combination with the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to anilines. The experimental results indicated that the special redox-modulated environment of the host and the proximity effects of the host-guest interaction could promote the formation of the charge-transfer complex to decrease the overpotential and that the cofactor QHQ could accelerate the electron transfer outside the cavity to further improve the efficiency of selective nitroarene hydrogenation."
1,Results and discussion,"Ligand H4 L 1 (5,5′-methylenebis(N1,N3-bis(2-(diphenylpho-sphanyl)benzylidene)isophthalo hydrazide)) was obtained by Schiff base reaction of 5,5′-methylenedi(isophthalohydrazide) with 2-(diphenylphosphanyl)benzaldehyde in an ethanol solution and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods. The solution-phase stability of compound Co–L 1 and the host-guest behaviour of binding QHQ were characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Three intense, sharp peaks at m/z = 801.6560, 974.3839, and 1233.4789 (Fig. 2a) are assigned to [Co6(L 1 )3]6+, [Co6(L 1 )3·NO3 −]5+ and [Co6(L 1 )3·2NO3 −]4+, respectively, indicating the formation of the M6L3 species in solution. Co–L 1 was shielded by a total of forty-two benzene rings to form a spherical cavity, providing a hydrophilic environment for the encapsulation of the bio-inspired QHQ cofactor in the host. When five equiv. of QHQ was added into the acetonitrile solution of Co–L 1 , a new intense, sharp peak at m/z = 1275.7515 was observed, which could reasonably be attributed to a [Co6(L 1 )3·(QHQ-2H)·CH3CN·2H2O]4+ species. A comparison of the experimentally obtained peak with that from the simulated natural isotopic abundances conforms to the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric host-guest complex species Co–L 1 ⊃ QHQ in solution (Fig. 2b). The cyclic voltammogram of Co–L 1 suggested that the reduction processes of CoII/CoI and CoIII/CoII occurred at approximately −1.41 and −0.69 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively (Fig. 3a). Compared with the previously reported ONN chelators, the CoII/CoI potential shifted 0.24 V towards more negative potential, which indicated that the compound Co–L 1 has higher reduction activity for hydrogen production [26]. This effect could be attributed to the introduction of “P” coordination sites in the Co–L 1 structure. The CoII/CoI potential falls well within the potential range of proton reduction in aqueous media. After the addition of p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.8 mM) to the Co–L 1 solution, the voltammogram showed the appearance of a new peak at −1.57 V. Moreover, the intensity of the new wave increased with increasing concentrations of p-toluenesulfonic acid (Fig. 3a) [27]. The new wave was reasonably assigned to typical proton reduction, suggesting that Co–L 1 is capable of directly reducing protons in a catalytic reaction [28,29]. The appearance of these redox peaks proves that Co–L 1 can achieve proton reduction with high efficiency [30–32]. The Co–L 1 was firstly investigated as a catalyst for light-driven hydrogen production in a 20 mL flask. Under the optimized conditions, hydrogen was directly generated under continuous irradiation with a CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v) solution containing Ru(bpy)3 2+ (0.5 mM), Co–L 1 (2.5 μM), and ascorbic acid (H2A, 0.1 M) at a pH of 4.75 with light from a 500 W Xe lamp (Figs. S8–S10). The maximum volume of hydrogen produced reached 0.29 mL after 12 h (Fig. 3b) and was three times that of the previous similar system, except for the redox potential of the catalyst [25], indicating that the ONP chelators could regulate the potential of metal centres to facilitate proton reduction. Control experiments demonstrated that host Co–L 1 , photosensitizer Ru(bpy)3 2+ and electron donor H2A are three indispensable elements for hydrogen generation. Of course, these proton reduction systems could not work well without light. Under the optimized conditions, the addition of QHQ (15 mM) to the aforementioned reaction solution increased the hydrogen production to 0.62 mL (Fig. 3b) with an approximately 2200 of turnover number (TON), indicating that the formation of host-guest complex promotes occurrence of the hydrogen production (Fig. S11). Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) was used to ensure the quantitative accuracy of the relationship between the compound Co–L 1 and the cofactor QHQ as well as provide insight into the thermodynamics for host-guest complexation [33–35]. A typical titration curve is shown in Fig. 3c with the observed inclusion number 1 between Co–L 1 and QHQ. Curve fitting by the computer simulation using an “independent” model reveals an association constant of 2.92 × 104 M−1 with an activation enthalpy (ΔH) of 0.27 kJ·mol−1, activation entropy (ΔS) of 86.43 J·mol−1 and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of −25.50 kJ·mol−1 for Co–L 1 ⊃ QHQ (Fig. S6). And the formation of host-guest charge-transfer complex was further demonstrated by UV/Vis differential absorption spectra, with a new absorption peak at 590 nm (Fig. 3d) [36]. The titration data result in the association constant of 3.20 × 104 M−1 for a 1:1 complex, which is in good consistent with the results in the ESI-MS and ITC spectra. Notably, Co–L 1 and QHQ have no absorption peak at this region, which suggests the formation of host-guest charge-transfer complexes. The results of the ESI-MS spectra, ITC, and UV/Vis spectra were mutually confirmed, indicating that a 1:1 mol ratio host-guest Co–L 1 ⊃ QHQ coclathration supramolecular system was formed stably in solution. Moreover, the addition of QHQ (0.2 mM) to a solution containing Co–L 1 (0.1 mM) resulted in a new irreversible peak at approximately −1.56 V (Fig. S13). This modified potential shifted 0.15 V towards more negative potential compared to the intrinsic potential (−1.41 V) of the compound Co–L 1 and may be attributable to the host-guest charge-transfer supramolecular system, which facilitates proton reduction more easily. Under saturated reaction conditions, QHQ in high concentration (K ass[QHQ] > 100) exhibited pseudo-zero-order kinetics of hydrogen production. The initial turnover frequency (TOF) of hydrogen production was no longer increased by further adding QHQ. When the concentration of QHQ was fixed at 15 mM, the TOF exhibited a linear relationship with the concentration of Co–L 1 in the range of 1.0 μM to 2.5 μM (Fig. 4a). However, the increase of multiples in TOF was more than that of the concentration of Co–L 1 . This result indicated that the TOF depends on the concentration of complex Co–L 1 ⊃ QHQ and that excess QHQ could also accelerate the electron transfer to increase the TOF of hydrogen evolution outside the cavity. To further explore this type of system, the ligand HL 2 (N′-(2-(diphenylphosphanyl)benzylidene)benzohydrazide) was synthesized by benzhydrazide and 2-(diphenylphosphanyl)benzaldehyde and self-assembled with cobalt ions to generate a mononuclear cobalt complex Co–L 2 (Fig. S1). Then, control experiments of light-driven hydrogen generation were performed with Co–L 2 containing the same coordination configuration under the same conditions. The volumes of hydrogen generation were 0.23 and 0.27 mL for Co–L 2 instead of Co–L 1 in the absence and presence of the QHQ cofactor, respectively (Fig. 3b). An increase of 20% was observed, which was attributed to the ability of the QHQ cofactor to facilitate electron transfer in normal homogeneous systems. The superior hydrogen-evolving performance of the Co–L 1 /QHQ system over that of the Co–L 2 /QHQ system is postulated to result from the well-defined host-guest interactions and the proximity effects created by the host architecture. To further investigate the influence of the formation of host-guest charge-transfer complexes in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, p-difluorobenzene (DFB), a redox-inactive species, was selected as an inhibitor for our enzymatic system. ITC curves of Co–L 1 after adding DFB revealed the formation of a host-guest system with an association constant of 3.93 × 104 (Figs. 3c and S7). The higher binding constant than that of the Co–L 1 /QHQ system indicates that DFB could replace QHQ and be encapsulated in the pocket of the capsule. As expected, hydrogen production sustained only an increase of 10% in the presence of QHQ (15 mM) and DFB (0.15 M) (Fig. 4b). However, when DFB was added to the Co–L 2 /QHQ reaction system, there was no significant influence on hydrogen production (Fig. 3b). The continual catalysis of similar molecules is unique to enzyme systems, and the results indicated that the catalytic effect of the system is inhibited due to the presence of host-guest complexes. The introduction of the ONP chelators endows these metal-organic supramolecular systems with an appropriate redox potential to allow photocatalytic reduction of protons to form active H-atoms that can selectively reduce reaction intermediates or substrates [37,38]. In a typical model reaction, p-nitroacetophenone with bifunctional groups was used as the substrate for the selective reduction of the nitro group. The addition of 40 mM p-nitroacetophenone to a solution containing Co–L 1 (2.5 μM), H2A (0.1 M), and Ru(bpy)3 2+ (0.5 mM) resulted in a 33% yield, and the selectivity of the product p-aminoacetophenone reached 99%. Under the same conditions, with the addition of QHQ (15 mM) to the aforementioned reaction solution, a yield of 48% with a turnover number (TON) of 7700 per mole of catalyst was obtained, and the TOF was as high as 650 per mole of catalyst per hour. After 12 h of irradiation, only a trace amount of p-nitrophenylmethanol was detected, and the hydrogen evolution was stopped, which suggested that this supramolecular system was highly efficient and stable. Interestingly, when the concentration of Co–L 1 was fixed at 2.5 μM, the TOF of the photocatalytic reduction of p-nitroacetophenone increased with increasing QHQ concentration, and the TON reached a maximum of 11,600 at 30 mM. However, the TOF as high as 970 per mole of catalyst per hour remained unchanged when the QHQ concentration continued to increase (50 mM) (Fig. 4c). We speculated that a high concentration of substrate could inhibit the formation of the Co–L 1 ⊃ QHQ host-guest complexes to influence the reaction efficiency (Fig. S5). To demonstrate the general applicability of our catalyst system, various nitroarenes were tested (Table 1 ). The results showed that the carbonyl group cannot be reduced due to the insufficient reduction potential of both the photosensitizer and the host-guest complex. The selectivity of all corresponding amino products reached 99% with high TON values. For a time-course experiment, an excess of p-nitroacetophenone (0.1 M) was added, and H2A was added into the reaction system halfway through the experiment to ensure that the H2A concentration remained at 0.1 M. After 60 h, the TON value reached 18,000. Most importantly, when QHQ (30 mM) was added to the system, the TON value reached 36,000 through 6 superimposed experiments (Fig. 4d)."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, a new strategy for the construction of a host-guest charge-transfer system was further developed to accelerate photocatalytic hydrogen generation and the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes. The approach included the self-assembly of the well-designed redox-active metal-organic prism host, which has a suitable pocket size and a special redox-modulated environment to encapsulate the QHQ cofactor, benefitting the formation of a charge-transfer complex. The enhanced electron transfer efficiency due to the proximity effects of the host-guest systems, the well-localized redox events and the electron transfer effect of QHQ outside the metal-organic prism cavity allow the tandem reductions to proceed to efficiently reduce the nitro group using active H-sources from photo-activated water. The excellent activity and improved stability suggest that the novel approach for the construction of supramolecular systems as efficient homogeneous catalysts is promising and could be extended to other hydrogenation transformations using light as a clean energy source."
