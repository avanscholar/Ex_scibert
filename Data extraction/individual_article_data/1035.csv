0,Introduction,"The present fossil fuel-based production of energy has led to large-scale industrial expansion. However, the dependence on fossil fuels trains to the gradual depletion of natural resources and to an increase of greenhouse gases emissions with negative effects on the global climate. It is then essential to develop innovative processes to produce renewable energy sources. Biohydrogen is a promising alternative clean energy carrier with a high energy content (142MJ/kg), twice that of natural gas (Singhania et al., 2012). Upon the combustion of H2, H2O is the only major by-product. In the coming years, their use will be generalized with development of fuel cell in many domain, mainly in automotive industry but also in aerospace, multimedia and civil engineering (Dayhim et al., 2014; Santoro et al., 2017). In recent decades, several biological routes to produce H2 were investigated for the attractive and renewable characteristics of this energy carrier. Dark fermentation (DF) with mixed culture represents an interesting way for hydrogen production and allows the recycling of many types of waste. The main advantage of performing DF with mixed culture is the ability of anaerobic bacteria to degrade many complex substrates such as agricultural residues, lignocellulosic biomass, wastes, industrial and domestic effluents (Eker and Sarp, 2017; Slezak et al., 2017; Urbaniec and Bakker, 2015; Yun et al., 2017; Gonzales et al., 2016). Moreover, the VFAs (Volatiles Fatty acids) co-produced during the culture correspond to high added value building blocks that have many industrial applications (Béligon et al., 2016; Singhania et al., 2012). Food waste represents an important resource for hydrogen production by dark fermentation with 1.3billion of tons of food waste generated annually (Uçkun Kiran et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2007). Currently, one quarter of food waste is lost in the food supply chain (Kummu et al., 2012). This substrate has high energy content with 85–95% of volatile solids. Biological hydrogen potential (BHP) of this substrate presents large variations between 3 and 290mLH2⋅gvs −1 depending of nature of the food wastes. The average BHP is 60mLH2⋅gvs −1 twice the one reported for agricultural wastes (Guo et al., 2010). In European Union, food wastes were estimated at 89.3million of tons in 2005. This value will reach 93million in 2020 (European commission 2011). An European study estimated that 173kg of food waste are produced by person and by year in food chain (Stenmarck et al., 2016). The European directive 2008/98/CE encourages the various European players to recycle food wastes (Redlingshöfer et al., 2017). In France since 2016, Grenelle law 2 (article L. 541-21-1 du code de l’environnement 2012) forces food producers to recycle their wastes if they generate more than 120tons/years. Several studies have already been carried out on the ability to produce hydrogen from food waste. The authors generally determined an average composition of food waste and worked from a model mix. The originality of this work is to study a particular fraction of food waste i.e. depackaging waste obtained after removing the packaging from food residues in deconditioning units. The resulting product is a liquid soup containing organic matter with a high energy potential which represents a promising carbon source for dark fermentative and hydrogen production. However, depackaging wastes (DWs) are carbohydrate-rich and are rapidly fermented during storage and transport. Potential inhibitors of hydrogen production can then be produced, in particular lactic or acetic acids. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of perform dark fermentation from this industrial pre-fermented substrate. The depackaging wastes were first analysed to determine if potential inhibitors were present. Then, an experimental design was conducted in various conditions to determine the hydrogen potential of this substrate. The best conditions obtained were then used to realize a batch culture on bioreactor and to explore the metabolic pathways used for acids conversion to H2."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The microbial consortium was derived from sewage treatment plant sludge. The collected sample was incubated in complete medium (Béligon et al., 2016) with addition of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (10mM) (Bulock and Kristiansen, 1987) to remove methane producing Archeae. Five subcultures (10% v/v) were carried out to stabilize the consortium until a same hydrogen production is achieved in 16h. The analysis of the consortium was previously described in detail (Noblecourt et al., 2017)."
3,Depackaging wastes,"2.2 Depackaging wastes Depackaging wastes (DWs) were supplied by Methelec Company, a methanisation unit (Ennezat, France). Three samples were taken at different times during delivery on the methanisation unit to analyse the variability of substrate. The substrate was sieved at 0.5mm to eliminate the largest particles in suspension."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Optimization conditions were designed according to a fractional factorial design. The results were fitted by a linear model with software JMP 9.0 (JMP® SAS). The responses were i) hydrogen and VFAs yields which were expected to be as high as possible, ii) propionate yield which was expected to be as low as possible because its synthesis is made through a competitive pathway of hydrogen production and iii) the monitoring of the ratio Butyrate/Acetate to determine a potential correlation with the hydrogen production. To optimize these responses, six factors were tested. The nine tested conditions were shown in Table 1 . Each condition was performed in duplicate with a standard deviation less than 5%."
5,Bioreactor culture,"2.4 Bioreactor culture 2.4.1 DWs batch culture The culture was carried out in a 2.5L bioreactor (GPC-Bio, Périgny, France) with 2L of working volume. 200mL of inoculum was added in bioreactor (10%v/v) after 30h of incubation at 37°C. In bioreactor, the other parameters were temperature 35°C, stirring rate 200rpm, pH regulated at 7 by KOH (5mol·L−1) and/or H2SO4 (4mol·L−1) addition. 2.4.2 Glucose batch culture The glucose batch culture was performed with the same bioreactor and inoculum than DWs batch culture with complete medium ∗∗∗(part 2.1). The culture parameters were glucose initial concentration of 60g·L−1, 35°C, stirring rate 200rpm, pH regulated at 6 by KOH (5mol·L−1) and/or H2SO4 (4mol·L−1) addition."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods 2.5.1 Gas phase analysis Biogas volume and flow rate were measured with a drum-type gas meter (Ritter TG05). RIGAMO® software was used for analysis and real-time monitoring. Biogas composition analysis was carried out with a micro-GC (Agilent 3000) equipped by two channels and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The composition in hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and methane was determined from the first channel with a molecular sieve column (5Å). Argon was used as a vector gas at a pressure of 30 psi, the injector and oven temperatures were respectively 80 and 90°C. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfur were determined by the other channel with a Pora plot U (PPU) column. Hydrogen was the vector gas at a pressure of 30 psi, the temperatures of the injector and of the column were 80 and 60°C, respectively. The software SOPRANE® provided to SRA instruments was used to set parameters of gas chromatograph and analyse results of gas composition. The hydrogen production curves were modelled by the modified Gompertz model designed for pure batch cultures (Han et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2017). The model was described by the following equation: (1) H ( t ) = P exp { - exp [ ( R m e / P ) ( λ - t ) + 1 ] } where H represented the cumulated hydrogen production (L), P the potential hydrogen production (L), Rm the maximal flow rate of hydrogen production (L·h−1), λ the lag phase duration (h) and t the time (h). The parameters P, Rm and λ were estimated by the solver function of Microsoft Office Excel 2007 software. This function used the Newton algorithm calibrated with 100 iterations, 10−6 precision, 10−4 convergence and 5% tolerance to fit with experimental values. 2.5.2 Liquid phase analysis 2.5.2.1 Chemical Oxygen Demand The Chemical Oxygen Demand was measured in HACH digestion tube (0–1500ppm). Sample was incubated in HACH DRB 200 and analysed with HACH DR/890 colorimeter (Hach Lange GmbH, Germany). 2.5.2.2 Total carbon and nitrogen content Total carbon composition was measured with TOC-V CSN (Shimadzu Corporation) and total nitrogen content with the Total Nitrogen Measuring Unit (TNM-1). Parameters and analyses were carried out with TOC-V software. Samples were prepared in ultrapure water to obtain a concentration included 0–100ppm. Sample received catalytic combustion in oven heated at 850°C and CLD detector (Chemiluminescence detector) to measured total azote concentration. 2.5.2.3 Organic acids composition The glucose, VFAs concentrations and lactic acid concentration were determined in filtered aliquots of the culture by HPLC. The HPLC equipment (Agilent 100, Agilent Technology) was composed of two columns (Rezex ROA 300×7.8nm, Phenomenex, USA) mounted in serial in an oven (50°C), and coupled to a refractometer as detector. The mobile phase consisted of 2mM sulfuric acid in ultra-pure water pumped at 0.7mL·min−1 and 70 bars (7000kPa). For the analysis, 2mL of sample were mixed with 250µL of Ba(OH)2, 8H2O (0.3M) and 250µL of ZnSO4, 7H2O (5% w/v). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000g for 5min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2µm cellulose acetate filter and injected in the HPLC. 2.5.2.4 Minerals composition Minerals composition was determined by ionic chromatography 882 Compact IC+ (Metrohm®). Chloride, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate composition were obtained with anionic chromatography and sodium, ammonium, potassium and calcium by cationic chromatography. Anionic chromatography was equipped by a positive resin Metrosep A Supp 5 (Metrohm®) and injection loop of 20μL. Mobile phase contained sodium bicarbonate (0.084g·L−1) and sodium carbonate (0.339g·L−1). Cationic chromatography was equipped by negative resin Metrosep C450 (Metrohm®) and injection loop of 100μL. Mobile phase contained nitric acid 65% with final concentration of 117.5mL·L−1 eluent and dipicolinic acid at final concentration of 0.117g·L−1. Determination of eluted compounds was realized by conductivity. Samples were prepared with same method that HPLC samples described previously."
7,Results and discussion,
8,DWs composition,"3.1 DWs composition Depackaging wastes (DWs) were supplied by Methelec Company, a Methanation unit. Three samples were taken at different times during delivery on the methanation unit to analyse the variability of the substrate. Average composition is presented in Table 2 and compared with the composition of the complete medium usually used in our laboratory. Few variations were observed between the composition of the three DWs collected. No significant variations were observed in organic acids composition. The main organic acid was lactic acid (23–29g·L−1) indicating that endogenous lactic flora was active during transportation. Impact of lactate on hydrogen production remained unclear since according several authors lactate could improve H2 production (Wu et al., 2012; Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009) or decrease hydrogen production rate (Wang and Zhao, 2009; Wu et al., 2012). The others organic acids were acetate with a concentration closed to 4g·L−1 while the concentrations of butyrate, propionate and isovalerate were less than 1g·L−1. It was established that VFAs have a significant impact on hydrogen production (Zhang et al., 2012; Zheng and Yu, 2005) but this concentration was lower than the toxicity threshold (Noblecourt et al., 2017). The presence of these organic acids decreased pH of DWs close to pH4 while hydrogen production is possible in a range of 5.2–7 (Li et al., 2008). Ethanol concentration was around 6g·L−1 and could also induce inhibition of hydrogen production even if its impact is less significant than for VFAs (Wang et al., 2008). An excessive concentration of ethanol could also modify metabolic pathway and induce propionate production (Tang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008). The comparison between the average composition of the DWs and the complete medium composition showed that all the essential elements (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) were present in sufficient amount (Argun and Onaran, 2017; Carosia et al., 2017). Mineral salts composition was closed to complete medium except for sulphates. Iron concentration was not determined but represents an essential element for hydrogen production (Boni et al., 2014; Engliman et al., 2017) DWs could also contain heavy metals. In excess, compounds like zinc, nickel or cooper could inhibit hydrogen production (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016). Finally, complex endogenous flora contained in DWs could compete or inhibit hydrogen production by promoting competing or consuming metabolic pathways. To confirm the ability of DWs to produce hydrogen, an experimental fractional design was carried out."
9,Study of DWs degradation with experimental fractional design,"3.2 Study of DWs degradation with experimental fractional design For the experimental fractional design six factors were tested. Because acids and alcohol were present in significant amount in DWs, pure and diluted (1/2; 3/4) substrates were tested to observe a potential inhibitory effect of these compounds on hydrogen production (X6). To determine the influence of endogenous flora, inoculation (or not) with a specific consortium was chosen as factor (X3). Heat treatment (70°C, one hour) corresponding to the mandatory heat treatment for biogas plant to eliminate potential pathogens from food wastes (Nomenclature of Installations Classées Pour l’Environnement 2781-2) was also included in the experimental plan (X2). Based on the DW composition (part 3.1), some mineral elements may be missing for an optimal hydrogen production. Mineral salts addition was then selected as a factor (X4). Cysteine addition, allowing to decrease the redox potential below −350mV (anaerobic conditions), was also considered as a determinant factor (X5). Finally influence of pH was also determined (X1). To achieve this experimental design, 9 experiments were done in duplicate. At this stage, a standard deviation less than 5% was obtained which did not require further replication. All the results were filled in a matrix to determine the most significant factors by a linear model using the least square method (Table 3 ). Estimated coefficient represented the effect of the tested parameters and the probability (p-value) was an estimation of impact factors. When the probability obtained was less than 0.05, the factor was considered as significant. The linear model showed a high determination coefficient for hydrogen and propionate yield with linear correlation coefficient close to 1 (respectively R2 =1 and 0.97) which indicates a statistically significant model. In contrast, coefficient was less significant for VFA yield and butyrate/acetate ratio (0.77 and 0.80). The estimated coefficient and the probability showed that two factors i.e. medium reduction by cysteine addition and substrate dilution had no significant impact on the H2, VFAs or propionate yields nor on the B/A ratio. Medium reduction seems useless since initial redox of DWs was measured between 0 and 100mV and decreased rapidly until −500mV mainly due to the presence of facultative anaerobic bacteria in the consortium. Based on the results, the dilution of the substrate did not affect hydrogen performance indicating that the consortium seems highly tolerant to important lactate concentration (25g·L−1). In literature, several authors have described the ability of some bacteria to transform lactic acid to pyruvate for metabolic energy production. Duncan et al. (2004) demonstrated also that isometry of lactate influenced lactate assimilation. For example, Clostridium indolis was only able to consume d-lactate due to the lack of l-lactate dehydrogenase to produce pyruvate. Experiments performed in our laboratory with the consortium used in this study showed that l-lactate was not consumed and interfered with hydrogen production. A concentration of 4g·L−1 led to a 35% decrease of H2 production (data not shown). The results indicated that lactate in depackaging wastes was mostly present in the d-lactate form. Initial VFAs and ethanol concentration did not seem to affect the hydrogen production. The high ethanol concentration in the substrate could however induce metabolic shift pathway and explained the production of propionate which was not observed with the same consortium using glucose as substrate (Béligon et al., 2016). The “complete medium” factor had no significant impact on the yields of H2 or propionate and on the ration B/A but had a significant impact on the VFAs yield. When mineral salts were added to the substrate, no improvement of hydrogen production was observed, which means that mineral salts present in depackaging wastes were sufficient to produce hydrogen in optimal conditions. Inoculation of the system significantly improved hydrogen production. However, a hydrogen production was observed without inoculation at pH 7, indicating that hydrogen producers were present in depackaging wastes. In the same way, heat treatment of DWs favoured hydrogen production by decreasing the endogenous flora and by limiting the competing metabolic pathways of H2 production. pH was the main factor which impact the hydrogen production. Without adjustment, DWs pH was between 3.8 and 4.2 and no hydrogen production was observed. Only VFAs were produced after 50h. With a regulated pH of 7, hydrogen production was rapidly observed after 10h. These results were in accordance with the optimal pH range (5.2–7) reported in the literature (Li et al., 2008). It was observed that pH regulation modifies the composition of VFAs produced. At pH 7, the main VFA produced was butyrate (ratio B/A=4–5), the others metabolites reported at the end of culture were respectively acetate, propionate, isovalerate and valerate while at pH 4, only acetate and isovalerate were produced. These results indicated that the butyrate pathway was favoured when pH was controlled (Moon et al., 2015). According to the results obtained (Fig. 1 ), the probability of the 6 factors tested and the experimental design, the conditions retained to perform a batch culture in bioreactor were pure substrate (X6) with heat treatment (X2), inoculation (X3) and pH regulation to 7 (X1), with no addition (X4) nor reduction of medium (X5). The potential performances which could be obtained with the selected parameters were described in the Fig. 1. These parameters were determined in function of desirability curves defined by the responses of the factorial fractional design."
10,Batch cultures performed in bioreactor,"3.3 Batch cultures performed in bioreactor Based on the conditions defined with the experimental plan, a batch culture was carried out in a 2L Bioreactor. A comparison with a simple substrate (glucose) was also performed to analyse the variation in the metabolic behaviour of the consortium. Results obtained with DWs and glucose were compared in Fig. 2 . On DWs (Fig.2a), after five hours, hydrogen flow rate started to increase until 0.45L·h−1 at 13h. At its maximal production rate, H2 content in biogas was 65% while the maximum observed with glucose substrate was 55%. Hydrogen flow rate dropped after 13h when the cumulate VFAs concentration was upper than 12g·L−1. Finally, the hydrogen production stopped after 33h when lactate was completely exhausted. The global H2 production yield reported to lactate consumed was 0.4molH2·mollactate −1. A comparison with the culture on glucose (Fig.2c) indicated that, in both cases, likenesses in the evolution of hydrogen production were observed. In each culture, the hydrogen production increased rapidly after few hours then dropped before the carbon source was completely exhausted. This phenomenon was explained by the important accumulation of VFAs in the medium inducing high toxicity for hydrogen producers. Similar toxicity was previously reported in literature (Zhang et al., 2012; Zheng and Yu, 2005). These results were also in accordance with previous works (Noblecourt et al., 2017) demonstrating the influence of VFAs on hydrogen production with a toxicity threshold comprised between 10 and 12g·L−1 of cumulate VFAs. These experiments clearly demonstrated the ability of this consortium to preferentially use lactate as a carbon source. Indeed, total carbohydrate concentration in DW was estimated around 4g·L−1 and only 30% were consumed at the end of the experiment. These results indicated that the remaining carbohydrates contained in depackaging food wastes were complex and difficult to assimilate. A large part of the initial sugars of DWs was fermented into lactate by endogenous lactic flora during process and transport. To our knowledge, lactic acid was rarely studied as substrate for hydrogen production and only few significant hydrogen production was reported when lactate was used as the sole substrate (Wu et al., 2012; Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009). In most of these studies the genus Clostridium was identified in particular Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium tyrobutyricum, or Clostridium beijerinckii, (Balows et al., 1992; Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995; Hashsham et al., 2000; Jo et al., 2008a,b). The analysis of our consortium (Noblecourt et al., 2017) indicated that Clostridium butyricum was mostly present in the consortium and may be a performant candidate for hydrogen production from lactate. The hydrogen production in the presence of lactic acid was generally accompanied by formation of higher amounts of butyric acid as the predominant aqueous metabolite (Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009). In our case, butyrate was the major acid produced indicating that this pathway was preferentially used with our consortium. These results are in accordance with those obtained in the experimental plan. Even if, on a stoichiometrically point, acetate pathway was more efficient for hydrogen production, our results were mainly correlated to butyrate production. A similar conclusion was recently described by Guo et al. (2014) and remains to be clarified in function of the microorganisms and from the substrate used. The main data of the two experiments was synthesized in Table 4 . The maximal hydrogen production rate in DWs was 0.45L·h−1 and remained lower compared to 0.88L·h−1 on glucose for the same number of moles of carbon consumed. Even if the H2 yield was more than three time less than with glucose it remained close to the one reported by Wu et al. (2012) on synthetic medium containing lactate (0.42molH2·mollactate −1). The comparison with glucose culture indicated that the global metabolism on real substrate was mainly directed towards AGV-producing pathways as indicate by higher yields for each acid. The initial concentration of acids in the DWs could have several drawbacks. The toxicity threshold was more rapidly reached than with a synthetic medium and could impact the maximum hydrogen flow rate. The increase of the VFAs production yield could also indicate that carbon source was preferentially used for energy production to prevent acidification in bacteria. A biomass production less significant could explain the differences observed. This hypothesis could be validated by molecular determination of the biomass concentration. Nevertheless, the values obtained with DWs are close to other organic substrate like food waste or industrial effluents (Yun et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2016; Dhar et al., 2015). This study demonstrated the ability of the consortium tested to convert different carbon sources (carbohydrates or lactate) with good efficiency. These data represent an important parameter in the prospect of using an industrial substrate whose composition is liable to vary according to the conditions of storage and transport. DWs could then be considered as an interesting substrate for H2 production at an industrial scale."
11,Conclusion,"Depackaging wastes (DWs) represent in Europe an important organic source for energy production. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of performing dark fermentation from this pre-fermented substrate. The best experimental conditions were determined thanks to the design of an experimental plan. Results obtained with batch culture on bioreactor indicated that DWs could be considered as an interesting substrate for H2 production at an industrial scale. The initial presence and the accumulation of VFAs in the medium remains a critical parameter that could be limited using continuous culture mode.
