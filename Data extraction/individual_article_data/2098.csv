0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production has attracted worldwide attention due to its potential as an inexhaustible, low-cost and renewable source of clean energy [1]. Among various biological hydrogen production routes, anaerobic hydrogen fermentation seems to be favorable, since it can yield at a high rate with a concomitant reduction in environmental organic pollutants [2]. Although the rate of fermentative hydrogen production is faster than photosynthetic, it still required further improvement for commercial exploitation. The immobilization of whole cell is currently a subject of an increasing practical and academic interest as an alternative to enhance the activity of microorganisms involved in fermentation systems. Hydrogen production using immobilized cells has been reported by several researchers [3–11]. The carriers used for the immobilization were mostly synthetic polymers or inorganic materials, such as activated carbon, agar gel, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, urethane foam and so on. These carriers have their own advantages, but they also have some problems such as high cost, low substrate conversion efficiency and toxic to microorganisms. There are also some deficiencies in stability and mechanical properties. In order to obtain a higher cell density and biological activity in immobilization process, it is necessary to develop a new type of immobilized carrier. Mycelia pellet is a kind of bio-granule formed spontaneously in the process of Aspergillus niger Y3 fermentation [12]. An important advantage of the mycelia pellet morphology is the filamentous in porous and large surface area, resulting in improved mixing and mass transfer properties. It is also beneficial to the adhesion of the bacteria. In addition, it has a short generation time, rapid propagating, and low production costs. So take mycelia pellets as an immobilized biological carrier will have a very broad application prospect. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, no study has demonstrated that mycelia pellets can be used as carrier to improve hydrogen production. Therefore, in the present paper, the feasibility of using mycelia pellets as biological carrier for enhancing hydrogen production by Clostridium sp. T2 was studied. Batch culture was carried out to opitimize the best immobilization parameters on hydrogen production using the mycelia pellets. Finally, the performance of hydrogen production by Clostridium sp. T2 immobilized on mycelia pellet and sodium alginate, a widely used matrix, which is known of its preferable immobilization performance, were investigated in a continuous process to compare the quality between the new biological carrier and the conventional one."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms,"2.1 Microorganisms The strain for hydrogen producing was Clostridium sp. T2. It was routinely grown at 37 °C in a modified ATTC medium [13] containing (L−1): 1.5 g KH2PO4, 4.2 g Na2HPO4, 0.5 g NH4Cl, 0.18 g MgCl2, 0.5 g cysteine-HCl, 2.0 g yeast extract, 10 g xylose, 5 ml trace element solution, l ml vitamin solution [14]. The strain at its exponential-growth phase was used as the inoculum. The biological carrier used in this study was A. niger Y3, obtained from Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory of HIT. A spore suspension [15] was used for the inoculation, which was carried out by spores obtained from a densely conidia ting culture grown on solid Czapek–Dox medium [16]. For the formation of the mycelia pellet, the strain was maintained in a liquid medium at 30 °C in a gyratory incubator-shaker at a rotational speed of 140 rpm/min. The composition of the medium for culturing the mycelia pellet was determined as (L−1): 10.0 g sucrose, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g KH2PO4·3H2O, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O [17]."
3,Hydrogen production with immobilized cells on mycelia pellets in batch culture,"2.2 Hydrogen production with immobilized cells on mycelia pellets in batch culture After the appropriate size of the pellet formed, it was washed with sterile water to prevent agar debris and conidiophores in the spore suspension. Then the immobilized biological carriers were poured into the 250 ml glass serum bottles with 150 ml basal medium for Clostridium sp. T2 aforementioned, at the same time, the gas phase was replaced with nitrogen gas. Then, with the addition of 4% v/v inoculums during the exponential-growth phase, hydrogen production of Clostridium sp. T2 was carried on. In the subsequent tests, the effects of different mycelia pellets dosage (0.175–1.05 g L−1) and mycelia pellets size (0.5–3.5 mm) on hydrogen production potential were determined. In batch tests, pH, residual carbon substrate concentration, and quantity and compositions of produced biogas were determined, and all treatments were carried out in triplicate to check data reproducibility."
4,Immobilization of cells in sodium alginate,"2.3 Immobilization of cells in sodium alginate Clostridium sp. T2 cells were immobilized by entrapment into calcium alginate beads. Sodium alginate was dissolved in distilled water, then autoclaved for 15 min. Sterilized sodium alginate solution, when cooled, was mixed with 20 ml inoculums of the exponential-growth phase to obtain a final concentration of 2% alginate. The alginate/cell mixture was pumped through a sterilized syringe into a presterilized cold 0.2 M CaCl2 solution to form beads of approximately 2.5–3.0 mm in diameter. After at least 2 h, the CaCl2 alginate beads were washed using presterilized physiological saline solution [18,19]. All the operations above were carried out under the anaerobic condition."
5,Continuous-flow culture,"2.4 Continuous-flow culture Under the optimum immobilized conditions of the biological carrier, the bio-hydrogen production was carried out in a 1 L continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) with a working volume of 0.5 L. The mycelia pellets and calcium alginate beads formed before were poured respectively into the reactors with basal medium under anaerobic conditions. Seed culture before the end of logarithmic growth phase was transferred into the bioreactor at 4% v/v except the one immobilized in sodium alginate. The fermentation was performed with substrate concentration of 10 g L−1 at agitation speed of 200rpm, temperature 37 °C and pH 7.0. Simultaneously bio-hydrogen reactor without any matrices was performed as a control. The reactors were operated in batch mode for 12 h in order to provide the bacteria time to start growing and attach to the mycelia pellets, subsequently continuous cultivation was initiated by feeding medium at the lowest HRT of 12 h for 7 days to establish good growth conditions in reactors. After reaching steady-state operation, the HRT was decreased progressively from 12 h to 8 h."
6,Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation,"2.5 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation The mycelia pellets samples with immobilized cells at different stages of their growth were transferred into 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 1 h at 4 °C mainly for fixing the cells on the solid matrix. The materials were then washed three times with the same buffer. The samples were dehydrated by successive transfer in a series of 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and dehydrated ethanol solution by keeping in each solution for 15 min. The dehydrated samples were frozen and transferred into a freeze dryer. The dried samples were mounted on SEM stubs coated with gold. Different sections of the solid matrices were examined and photographed by SEM (JEOL JSM 5800) using 5 kV accelerating voltage and 10 mm distance. Digital images were captured using 1280 × 960 resolutions and 160 s dwell time."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The residual xylose was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Thermo Electron Corporation, Boston, MA, USA). Gases were determined by GC (GC-SC2, Shanghai Analytical Apparatus, Shanghai, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2.0 m stainless steel column packed with TDS-01 (60/80 mesh) and N2 at a flow rate of 70 ml/min as carrier gas. Volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by GC (HP 4800, Agilent Technologies, USA) using a flame ionization detector (FID)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effects of mycelia pellets on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effects of mycelia pellets on hydrogen production Table 1 shows the hydrogen production at different dosages and size of mycelia pellets addition. As a result, the cumulative hydrogen yield and xylose consumption were improved significantly when the mycelia pellets dosage increased from 0.175 to 0.350 g 150 ml−1. However, the levels of hydrogen yield and xylose consumption were negatively impacted when mycelia pellets dosage further increased from 0.350 to 1.05 g 150 ml−1. At mycelia pellets dosage of 0.350 g 150 ml−1, the hydrogen production yield and xylose consumption rate reached maximum, 1666 ml L−1 and 85% respectively, which were 13.8% and 11% higher than free cells of Clostridium sp. T2. Keeping the mycelia pellets dosage (0.350 g 150 ml−1) constant, tests were conducted to determine the optimal mycelia pellets size for immobilized Clostridium sp. T2. As shown in Table 1, the cumulative hydrogen yield and xylose consumption rate increased first with the increasing size of mycelia pellets and reached maximum with values of 1726 ml L−1 and 87% when average size of pellets were supplied at 1.5 mm and then decreased as the average mycelia pellets size exceeded 1.5 mm. This may be because too smaller mycelia pellets had relative weaker mechanical properties, which resulted in decreasing in adsorption activity. However, larger size mycelia pellets lessened the chances of cell population adsorption and thus leads to decrease in immobilized efficiency [20]. The end pH of the culture paralleled with the performance of immobilized hydrogen fermentation, at conditions of 0.350 g 150 ml−1 mycelia pellets dosage and 1.5 mm mycelia pellets size, the pH dropped to the lowest values of 4.20."
10,Continuous-flow fermentation,"3.2 Continuous-flow fermentation The fermentation of xylose in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) was carried out according to the optimal conditions obtained in batch culture to further investigate the operational stability of the immobilized Clostridium sp. T2 on mycelia pellets and suitability for continuous process. Simultaneously, the hydrogen-producing properties of free cells and cells immobilized in sodium alginate were also studied for comparison with the performance of cells immobilized on mycelia pellets. The H2-producing profiles in different CSTR systems with HRT ranging from 10 h to 12 h are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . At each HRT, the bioreactors were operated at least for ten cycles until steady conditions were achieved. As depicted in Fig. 1, the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) was 2.76 mmol H2 L−1 h−1 at 10 h HRT in the case of cells immobilized on mycelia pellets, which was 40.8% increased compared with carrier-free process. In contrast to HPR, the H2 content in the biogas and xylose conversion efficiency did not vary significantly with changes in HRT, but still reached highest level of 59.6% and 83.4% when the reactor was operated at HRT of 10 h and 12 h, respectively, which were 6.6% and 10.2% higher than carrier-free process. The carrier sodium alginate showed a little better performance of HPR (3.15 mmol H2 L−1 h−1) than mycelia pellets. However, the levels of xylose conversion efficiency (83.1%) and H2 content (61.5%) were equal to that of mycelia pellets (Fig. 1). Table 2 shows metabolites compositions in the effluent of the three reactors mainly composed of acetate and butyrate, with smaller quantities of propionate, butanol and ethanol coupled with inconspicuous change of pH. Scanning electron microscopy of cells immobilized on mycelia pellets was investigated to analysis the extent of the immobilized Clostridium sp. T2 (Fig. 2 ). As expected, a great many of cells are closely adhered to mycelia pellets (Fig. 2b). It is supposed that the interstice and rough surface of mycelia pellets make it be a good support matrix that allows the cells attached on mycelia pellets. Results obtained from continuous fermentation and SEM observation suggests that mycelia pellet is a nice biological carrier, which offers a new method and technique for biomass retention. It can substantially enhanced hydrogen production and the microbial activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria was not suppressed when the microorganisms were adhesion to mycelia pellets. From practical point of view it is particularly promising that mycelia pellets can efficiently immobilize Clostridium sp. T2 for bio-hydrogen production. The immobilized cells maintained stable and efficient H2 production during 31 repeated cycles, indicating excellent durability and stability of the immobilized-cell system and making this process an excellent candidate for use in large scale operations as well. Therefore, it is obvious that this process may be both practically and economically attractive."
11,Conclusions,"This work evaluated the hydrogen production by immobilized Clostridium sp. T2 on mycelia pellets. Immobilization parameters of mycelia pellets showed that the optimum conditions for hydrogen production was 0.350 g 150 ml−1 medium mycelia pellets dosage and 1.5 mm mycelia pellets size. Then, the performance of hydrogen production by Clostridium sp. T2 immobilized on mycelia pellets and traditional carrier sodium alginate were investigated in continuous processes. It obtained that the maximum rate of hydrogen production immobilized on mycelia pellets reached 2.76 mmol H2 L−1 h−1 at the HRT of 10 h, which was obviously improved compared with cells free system of 1.13 mmol H2 L−1 h−1, though slightly lower than the one immobilized in sodium alginate. SEM observation further demonstrated that a great many of cells are closely adhered to mycelia pellets. This study indicates that mycelia pellets can be used as an alternative carrier for improving hydrogen production."
