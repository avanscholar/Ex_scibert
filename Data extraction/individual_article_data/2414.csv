0,Introduction,"The importance of sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis is increasing these days, so one way to achieve this goal is to use reusable heterogeneous bionanocatalysts. Therefore, the demand for the design and manufacture of heterogeneous nanocatalysts in line with the principles of green chemistry is increasing [1]. The benefits of bionanocatalysts synthesis are simpleness, safe protocol, nontoxicity, cost-effectiveness, easy workup, and an eco-friendly nature that suitable for chemical reactions [2]. Green nanomaterials are now an essential purpose of research in nanotechnology as a current trend in today's nanoscience, the biosynthesis of nanomaterials using plants is now hopeful as a source for producing and designing bionanocatalysts [3]. One of the biological materials that can be used in the synthesis of bionanocatalysts is tannic acid. Tannic acid is a plant polyphenol composed from a central glucose molecule and possesses a large number of reactive functional groups, such as hydroxyl and phenolic hydroxyl which can be extracted from green tea, black tea, coffee and also many foodstuffs such as pears, grapes, bananas, lentils and black-eyed peas [4,5]. Despite all the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts, there are some drawbacks to using them, which are raised from their separation and recovery by filtering or centrifuging them while they are mixed in a liquid reaction. Hence, during the separation process, some amounts of the heterogeneous catalysts are lost, and that is the main cause of its limit usage on the industrial scale. Magnetic nanoparticles can resolve the separation and filtration problem of heterogeneous nanocatalyst. They can be easily and quickly separated from the reaction mixture, so eliminating the purification processes [6]. Magnetic nanoparticles are one of the main topics in industrial and academic researches, such as biotechnology, biomedical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), catalysts, etc. Some reasons that why magnetic nanoparticles are ideal for applying them in catalysis are to be inert, reusing potential, available, and easily separated by an external magnetic bar, thereby omitting the requirements of catalysis purification after completion of the reaction, high surface area that causes the high activity of the bionanocatalyst. So magnetic nanoparticles enabled scientists to design proper procedures to a great achievement of green chemistry [7–10]. However, magnetic nanoparticles also have their own problems, including their instability over time, as well as because of their magnetic dipole-dipole attraction; they have the aggregation properties. Similarly, the design and preparation of nanocomposite is a great strategy to protect and stabilize magnetic nanoparticles. Polymers, natural compounds, carbon, and silica are good options to produce a composite with magnetic nanoparticles; also, they can reduce the ability of magnetic nanoparticles to accumulate and increase their chemical stability [11]. On the other hand, one of the elements that can be used as a protecting cover for modifying and ameliorating tannic acid properties is copper. Copper has exceptional features, such as propounded electrical conductivity and antibacterial activities [12]. From a chemical point of view, selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds plays a momentous role in organic synthesis and the chemical industry. Because such aldehydes and ketones and their derivatives are essential building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, and aldehydes are valuable in the perfume industry [13–18]. Previous methods suffer from some disadvantages such as using corrosive stoichiometric oxidants; also, the process has been produced a large amount of waste, harsh reaction conditions, high pressure, and temperature and using toxic reagent and also limited to benzylic alcohols [19,20]. Therefore, the necessity of designing new protocols for a cost-effective and green selective oxidation of alcohol to corresponding aldehydes and ketones under moderate reaction conditions has special significance. Some possible substitutes for the methods mentioned above are the application of molecular oxygen (O2) [21], air [22], aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [23], sodium hypochlorite [24], etc. Some of the effectual methods for the oxidation of alcohol are the catalytic oxidation of alcohols with Pd [25], RuO2-supported materials [26,27], Pt [28], Mn [29], Au [30], Cu [31], Al [32], Mo [33], Fe [34], Vanadium oxide [35], covalent triazine framework [36], Choline peroxydisulfat [37]. Recently, the development and design of magnetic nanocomposites based on natural and biodegradable materials have received much attention from researchers. The reason for this special consideration is their preponderance, including biodegradability, ability to reuse, cost-effectiveness, thermal and chemical stability, and their easy production [38–40]. The design and preparation of magnetic nanocomposites can have a variety of applications, including their use as environmentally friendly biocatalyst for biodiesel production [41]. Also, other applications of magnetic nanocomposites that are in line with sustainable and green development include the use of sulfonated ionic liquid on core-shell structured Fe3O4@SiO2 composite as a heterogeneous catalyst with high activity and recyclability several times to prepare biodiesel from low-cost oil which is a green and economically viable method [42]. It is shown that geopolymer/Fe3O4 nanocomposite is effectively used to remove heavy metals such as copper, lead, nickel, cadmium, and mercury ions from industrial wastewater [43]. In this regard, targeted drug delivery systems, which send it precisely to the target tissue and the drug, use much less than before and also make the medication more effective [44]. From this point of view, magnetic nanocomposite can be used as a nanocatalyst in various reactions to produce heterocyclic compounds. Accordingly, in continuation of our interest in the preparation and application of green magnetic nanocatalysts in organic reactions [45–52], here, we wish to report the synthesis and characterization of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite. Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite were studied for the first time, and its properties were evaluated as a novel nanocatalyst for selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones in acetonitrile as a solvent in short reaction times and also good to excellent yields and green reaction conditions (Scheme 1 ). The use of tannic acid due to its hydroxyl and phenolic groups makes it a very active and useful catalyst for selective oxidation of alcohols and the catalytic circulation works effectively. Besides, copper coated with hydroxyl groups of tannic acids increases noteworthy in the catalytic activity of bionanocomposite. The nanocatalyst was separated from the reaction mixture easily without producing waste and reusing several times with no considerable decrease in catalytic activity. High values of calculated TONs and TOFs, show superior effectiveness and efficiency of the nanocatalyst to selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehyde and ketones."

Then 1.5 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was added into dispersed Fe3O4@tannic acid and was stirred 12 h at room temperature. The resulting precipitate was collected by an external magnet and was washed several times with distilled water. Eventually, the obtained bionanocomposite was placed in a vacuum oven for 5 h at 70 °C."

After completion of the reaction monitored with thin layer chromatography, Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu was removed from the reaction mixture with an external magnetic bar, and the pure product was achieved by a filtration method."
6,Optimization of reaction condition for the synthesis of aldehydes and ketone via selective oxidation of alcohols with Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite,"2.5 Optimization of reaction condition for the synthesis of aldehydes and ketone via selective oxidation of alcohols with Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite In order to optimize the selective oxidation of various alcohols with Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu as heterogeneous nanocatalyst, oxidation of 4-Chlorobenzyl alcohol under different reaction conditions applied. Multiple parameters such as solvent, temperature, and varied amount of catalyst were investigated. As can be seen in (Table 1), acetonitrile is the best solvent for reaction media at 80 °C. The best amount of nanocatalyst to catalyzed the oxidation with good to excellent yields is about 8 mg of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu. After optimization of the reaction conditions in order to develop this new methodology, the optimized reaction condition was applied for selective oxidation of different alcohols, as summarized in (Table 2 ). After completion of the reaction, the heterogeneous nanocatalyst was easily separated from the reaction mixture by using an external magnet and reused several times in subsequent reaction without a substantial decrease in its catalytic activity. As can be seen in the table data, aryl alcohols with both electron-withdrawing groups and electron-donating groups oxidized well in the presence of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu as a magnetically green nanocatalyst. High yields and short reaction times for oxidation show the excellent capability of nanocatalyst. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the nanocatalyst separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnetic bar, and the pure product was obtained."
7,Catalyst reusability,"2.6 Catalyst reusability One of the most crucial advantages of nanocatalyst as a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and active heterogeneous nanocatalyst is the ability to recycle and reuse of the nanocatalyst. For this purpose, the recyclability of the catalyst in the model reaction to produce product 2c was evaluated. After completion of the reaction, nanocatalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnetic bar. Then nanocatalyst was washed with ethanol and was dried at room temperature. The recovered nanocatalyst reused 10 times in further reactions without a considerable decrement in catalytic activity (Fig. 1 )."

To investigate the structure of the synthesized nanocomposites, various analyzes including Fourier-transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer measurements have been obtained."
10,Investigation of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite characteristics,"3.1 Investigation of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite characteristics 3.1.1 The FT-IR analysis of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite The comparative FT-IR of synthesized Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu and recycled Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu are shown in (Fig. 2 ). As can be seen, recycled Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu represented similar peaks to the primary Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu. This unchanged FT-IR spectrum of recycled nanocatalyst shows the high stability and efficiency of the nanocatalyst. The peaks between about 3200 and 3700 cm−1 were corresponding to the OH stretching vibrations in tannic acid. At the wavelength of 1622 cm−1 conjugated CO stretching vibration observed. The peak in 1350 cm−1 is related to aromatic CC stretching vibration. Peaks appearing at 1066 and 1211 cm−1 are related to C–O stretching vibrations. The characteristic bands of Cu–O and Fe–O at 474 and 617 cm−1 bands represented the metal-oxygen groups. 3.1.2 Energy‐dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite To identify the elemental composition of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was gained. As can be seen in (Fig. 3 a), the EDX pattern approves that Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu is composed of iron, copper, carbon, and oxygen elements. The table demonstrated the weight and atomic percentage of the elements in nanocatalyst. Oxygen has the maximum weight percentage in view of the fact that the presence in both organic and inorganic parts of bionanocomposite. These results are entirely consistent with EDX mapping images (Fig. 3b). EDX mapping shows the abundance distribution of available elements in nanocatalyst. Besides, EDX mapping images demonstrate that Fe and Cu are well dispersed. 3.1.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) are the fingerprint of all crystalline substances. X-ray diffraction was also used to characterize the crystal structure of bionanocomposite. The crystal structure of nanocatalyst has a specific diffraction pattern in XRD that is in accordance with the database. The sharp peaks in the region of 30–65° are relevant to Fe3O4 and Cu nanoparticles (Fig. 4 ). 3.1.4 Field-emission electron microscopy techniques (FE-SEM) of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite FE-SEM analysis determines the morphology and size details of the prepared Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , the SEM image shows that the bionanocomposite has almost spherical structures and well diffused on the surface of tannic acid that supply more excessive active area sites for the tannic acid surface to increase catalytic activity. Also, the uniform structure of Cu has been combined with the composite network to increase excess catalytic activity. The mean particle size of nanoparticles investigated by Digimizer software is in the range of 55 ± 10 nm (Fig. 6 ). 3.1.5 Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite VSM analysis is used to indicate the magnetic feature of synthesized bionanocomposite. The magnetic hysteresis loop can be seen in (Fig. 7 ). The saturation magnetization value (Ms.) of uncoated Fe3O4 was found to be 56 emu g−1 [53]. It is evident that a synthetic nanocomposite renders magnetic behavior, but magnetic behavior decreased considerably because loading Fe3O4 nanoparticles on tannic acid at the same field, in the following when copper loaded on Fe3O4@tannic acid magnetic behavior decreased. However, the obtained magnetic property was sufficient for bionanocomposite to separate easily from reaction media by an external magnet. 3.1.6 Thermogravimetric analysis of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve exhibit the relation between temperature and weight loss of bionanocomposite (Fig. 8 ). The decomposition of the nanocomposite was obtained while heating at a rate of 10 °C/min in the air atmosphere between 50 °C and 800 °C. The weight loss in the temperature range from 50 to 150 °C is related to the removal of the surface adsorbed water. Then the weight loss between 150 and 680 °C is about the organic structure of bionanocomposite. After that, the last decrease in the diagram between 680 and 800 °C shows the weight loss of residue of organic structure. Due to the thermogravimetric analysis, the bionanocomposite has good thermal stability to use it in organic reactions. 3.1.7 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite The TEM image of Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu represented that bionanocomposite has uniform spherical morphology with a crystalline structure. As can be seen in Fig. 9 , Fe3O4, and Cu nanoparticles distributed on the surface of tannic acid successfully. The figure has been proved the core-shell structure of Fe3O4@tannic acid that the dark site in the TEM image is related to the core (Fe3O4), and the light area described the shell (tannic acid). The presence of Cu is also displayed in the TEM image in which darkest spots. 3.1.8 Proposed mechanism for selective oxidation of alcohols with Fe3O4@tannic acid-Cu bionanocomposite Proposed mechanism for selective oxidation of alcohols is represented in (Scheme 2 ). As can be seen from the proposed mechanism, Cu is the outstanding active site of bionanocomposite for the oxidation process in the presence of H2O2. Firstly, copper coordinated to the oxygen of hydrogen peroxide, then alcohol reacted with the intermediate A and cause to create intermediate B, after that by removing two molecules of water consecutively desired product resulted."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, magnetic bionanocomposite was made based on tannic acid and modified with copper. In the beginning, Fe3O4@tannic acid was prepared and then modified with copper. After fabrication of the bionanocomposite, its structural aspects were investigated by various techniques such as FT-IR, EDX, XRD, FE-SEM, VSM, TGA, and TEM to consider structural characteristics and the surface area and morphology of the bionanocomposite. The FT-IR analysis was shown the composition and also stability of recycled nanocatalyst. The EDX pattern was demonstrated the elemental composition of bionanocomposite. The crystal structure of bionanocomposite was studied with an X-ray diffraction pattern. The morphology and the size of particles were investigated with the FE-SEM imaging method. The magnetic feature of bionanocomposite was checked with VSM analysis. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was determined the thermal stability of the bionanocomposite. Morphology and crystalline information of bionanocomposite Characterized by TEM image. There are many reasons to using this synthetic bionanocomposite for selective oxidation of alcohol, including the biodegradability and efficiency of the bionanocomposite, synthesized bionanocomposite from inexpensive and available materials, as well as a simple manufacturing method. This unique bionanocomposite has an average particle size of 55 nm, which makes the bionanocomposite as an efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds. The performance of this bionanocomposite is so high that very small amounts can be used for selective oxidation of alcohols in short reaction time and high yields. One of the main properties of synthesized catalysts is its easy separation from the reaction mixture by an external magnetic bar, which makes simple work-up and time-consuming. The ability to reuse the catalyst multiple times without further decrease in catalytic activity is another advantage of the synthesized nanocatalyst."
