0,Introduction,"About 80% of the world’s energy demand is met by fossil fuels [1] such as oil, coal and natural gas. This situation is causing both a fuel shortage and many of the environmental problems that our planet is experiencing today. These problems are primarily due to carbon dioxide emissions [2]. For these reasons, new energy sources should be developed. Hydrogen (H2) is the most promising compound among potential fuels, and it has several technical, socio-economic and environmental benefits. In fact, H2 is a clean energy vector that presents the highest energy content per unit weight of any known fuel (142 kJ/g) [3]. There are several methods to obtain H2 including steam reforming, thermal cracking, coal gasification cracking of fossil fuels, electrolysis or biotreatments [4]. Biological H2 production is the most environmental friendly because hydrogen can be produced from raw materials, as organic wastes, at ambient temperatures and pressure. Two biological methods can be used to produce H2. These are the photosynthetic and the fermentative processes. Both biological processes can be performed using either mixed or pure culture. However, from an industrial biotechnology point of view, mixed culture possesses specific advantages including no sterilization requirements, the adaptive capacity due to microbial diversity, the capacity to use mixed substrates and the possibility of continuous processing [5]. Fermentative H2 production (or dark fermentation) can be combined with the photosynthetic process to oxidize anaerobically fermentation products to carbon dioxide and H2. Herewith full anaerobic oxidation of carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and hydrogen can be established. Many factors, such as inoculum, substrate, reactor type, nitrogen and phosphate content, metal ions, temperature and/or pH, can influence the H2 production process [6,7]. For this reason, studying the effects of operating conditions on H2 production is of crucial importance, primarily because such studies can be used to optimize the performance and cost of the process. Hydrogen production is coupled to the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol. The most common fermentation products are ethanol, formate, acetate, propionate, lactate and butyrate. VFAs and solvent production depend on the catabolic pathways involved in the fermentation process. In literature, several authors proposed a scheme of catabolic pathways that can operate simultaneously [8,9]. For these reasons, it is interesting to study H2 production coupled to the generation of VFAs and solvents. In this context, the aim of this work was to use a response surface methodology to investigate the short-term influence of pH and temperature on fermentative H2 production. In the same way, VFA production was studied and related to H2 production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed microorganisms and wastewater,"2.1 Seed microorganisms and wastewater The mixed culture, for bio-hydrogen production, used in this work was enriched by biokinetic control [10]. This mixed culture was mainly composed of microorganisms of the clostridium strain. The initial inoculum was an aerobic activated sludge taken from a previously described municipal wastewater treatment plant [11,12]. This culture was acclimated in a sequential batch reactor (SBR) for 6 months. In order to enrich the concentration of H2-producing microorganisms in the mixed culture, the acclimatization process was performed at 35 °C, pH 5 and under anaerobic conditions. A synthetic wastewater was used during the acclimatization process and the batch experiments described herein. More information regarding to the wastewater can be found elsewhere [13]."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Dark acidogenic fermentation was conducted in a batch reactor with a 2.5 l working volume. The reactor was sparged with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 120 ml/min to ensure anaerobic conditions. The pH was controlled (pH±0.1) by automatic titration (ADI 1030 Biocontroller) with 3 N NaOH and HCl solutions. The temperature was controlled by the jacket layer of a glass reactor connected to the Biocontroller. Mixing was carried out using mechanical stirrer rotating at 60 rpm. Each experiment was conducted by adding 1.54 l of synthetic wastewater to 0.96 l of adapted H2-producing culture. Therefore, the total volume was 2.50 l, and the final concentration of glucose was 9 g/l. Before starting the experiments, the pH was adjusted using 3 N NaOH or HCl. To prevent excessive foaming during fermentation, a 2.5% solution of antifoam silicone 426 R (Prolabo) was added to the reactor at a rate of 1.55 ml h−1."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods A variety of analyses were performed to determine the composition of liquid and gas phases. To obtain the total suspended solids (TSS), the final solution was filtered using a Millipore 0.7-μm membrane and dried overnight at 105 °C. The same sample was subsequently burned for 2 h at 550 °C to determine the amount of dry biomass that represented the volatile suspended solids (VSS). To measure the glucose and fermentation products, samples were immediately centrifuged at 3500 g, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and frozen at −4 °C until they were analyzed. Substrate concentration was measured using an HPLC (Agilent) with a refractive index detector (series 1200). A Zorbax Carbohydrate column (4.6 × 150 mm 5-micron) was used to separate the components at 35 °C using a mobile phase composed of 75 vol. % acetonitrile and 25 vol. % water with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) were determined from centrifuged and filtered samples by gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer) with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a Crossbond Carbowax column (15 m × 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 mm df). The oven temperature was set at 140 °C for 1.5 min and subsequently increased at a rate of 25 °C/min until the temperature reached 190 °C, where it was maintained for 2 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 230 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas. Lactic acid concentration was measured in samples that had been centrifuged and filtered. Analysis was performed using an HPLC (Agilent) equipped with an ultraviolet diode array detection (UV-DAD) detector and a Zorbax SB-Aq column (4.6 × 150 mm 5 μm). The mobile phase was a buffer of pH 2 (0.05 M phosphate) composed of 99% water and 1% acetonitrile. The pH was measured and controlled using BioXpert software and a Biocontroller ADI 1030 (Applikon). The composition of the gas was analyzed using a multi-component gas analyzer (Emerson)."
5,Experimental design,"2.4 Experimental design A Centered Factorial Design (CFD) with two center points was used to determine the optimal conditions and to improve the H2 production process. Working in this way, it was possible to study the effect of each factor on the response variable, the hydrogen production, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the response variable. The CFD is an extension of the two-level full factorial designs. It enables a model to be fitted by including new levels, in addition to the lower and upper levels. Because of that, this variety requires 3 levels of each factor. In the CFD the star points are at the center of each face of the factorial space. The pH and temperature values selected as independent variables were 4, 5 and 6 units for pH and 26, 33 and 40 °C for temperature. In this study, nine different batch experiments were conducted by combining the pH and temperature conditions indicated above. Also a replication of the central point, corresponding to a pH 5 and 33 °C, was conducted. These experiments were performed in a random order to avoid undesirable effects on the experimental results. Finally, the optimization of hydrogen production was achieved via statistical analysis using the commercial software Statgraphic V5.1."
6,Response surface of hydrogen production,"2.5 Response surface of hydrogen production The experimental results were analyzed by using a response surface methodology [14]. This method was based on Eq. (1) as proposed in literature [15]. (1) β = a + a x X + a y Y + a x y X Y + a x x X 2 + a y y Y 2 where “β” is the predicted response (dependent), “X” and “Y” are factors or input variables (independent) that influence the response variable, “a” is an offset term, “ai ” is the ith linear coefficient, “aii ” is the ith quadratic coefficient and “aij ” is the ij th interaction coefficient. The fit of these parameters to the experimental results was performed using the commercial software OriginPro 8."
7,Hydrogen production kinetic model,"2.6 Hydrogen production kinetic model The modified Gompertz equation [16] (Eq. (2)) was used to fit the obtained cumulative H2 production data. (2) H ( t ) = H max · exp ( − exp ( Q · e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ) ) where H max is the H2 production potential (or total amount of H2 produced per ml), Q is the H2 production rate (ml H2 produced/h), λ is the lag phase (or the time to exponential H2 production in h) and e is the Eulers’ number."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of pH and temperature on the glucose fermentation process,"3.1 Effect of pH and temperature on the glucose fermentation process Acidogenic fermentation was carried out under different pH and T conditions, and very different results were obtained. It is worthy to remark that the pH measurements were carried out by using a pH probe with temperature compensation in order to avoid the effect of the temperature on pH measurements. The glucose fermentation efficiency was 100% at pH 5 and 6 for all of the temperatures studied (26, 33 and 40 °C). However, at pH 4, glucose was fully consumed only when the temperature was set to 26 °C (Fig. 1 ). As can be seen in Fig. 1, the glucose was fully consumed in all the tests except for two series at pH 4. When working at pH 4, the amount of substrate that was degraded decreased from 100% at 26 °C to 85% and to 45% when the temperature was increased to 33 °C and to 40 °C, respectively. Comparing the effect caused by the pH, it was observed that the higher the pH the higher the fermentation rate and therefore the shorter the test. These effects on fermentation rate and efficiency can be related to inhibition effects caused by the permeability of non-dissociated acids through the cellular membrane. Once inside the cell, these non-dissociated acids would be dissociated, releasing a proton, due to the higher intracellular pH. In this situation, and with the aim to maintain the intracellular pH, the cells must spend metabolic energy to excrete these protons against a concentration gradient. This active transport consumes energy, limiting the cells’ metabolism [9]. Regarding to the temperature, it was observed that at pH 5 and 6 the higher the temperature the higher the fermentation rates. This can be explained by the enhancement of the microbial metabolisms caused by the increase in the temperature. Something similar happened at the beginning of the test performed at pH 4, increasing the fermentation rates with the temperature. However, after several hours this relationship shifted to the opposite, and even the fermentation test performed at 40 and 33 °C stopped without fully consumption of the substrates. This effect can be explained by combining the temperature and pH effects on the fermentation process. On one hand, the low pH allowed to accumulate higher concentrations of non-dissociated acids coming from the fermentation of the substrate. On the other hand, the temperature caused two opposite effects, increased the microbial metabolism but also increased the membrane permeability [17,18], which subsequently increased the energy required for maintenance purposes. The net effect of both aspects was a higher inhibition, because the energy required for maintenance increased more than the microbial metabolisms. Therefore, at low pH, the degradation efficiency would not be favored by an increase of temperature (as usually occurs) because the cell membrane is more permeable at high temperatures. This inhibition was confirmed by measuring the biomass yield at pH 4. The yield was lower because some of the energy obtained from catabolic pathways was expended in maintaining the intracellular pH, and this energy could not be used for the synthesis of biomass."
10,Hydrogen production model,"3.2 Hydrogen production model The cumulative H2 production and rate represent the ability of the microbial culture to produce H2 from a defined substrate under certain operating conditions. The influence of pH and temperature on H2 production from glucose is shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows that the results obtained at 26 °C always exhibited the highest cumulative H2 production, independent of the pH. This result confirms that the hydrogen yield of the fermentation process is higher at low temperatures. However, the highest rates were obtained when working at 40 °C. The H2 production rate at pH 4 could not be compared due to the product inhibition described above. These opposite results can be explained because the cumulative H2 production represents the overall amount of H2 produced over the course of the experiment and it is related to the stoichiometry of the fermentation process, whereas the fermentation rate is related to the kinetic. To obtain the kinetic parameters of the H2 production, the experimental data were fitted to the modified Gompertz equation. Good fits were obtained for the data obtained at pH 5 and 6 (see lines in Fig. 2) but not for pH 4. This could be explained because of inhibition caused by the non-dissociated acids. Using the fitting of experimental results to the modified Gompertz equation, it was possible to determine the main kinetic parameters (Table 1 ) of the hydrogen production. The correlation coefficients for these data were greater than 0.991. The significance of correlation was calculated, and their values indicated that the variables were positively related at p ± 0.05. As seen in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the kinetic parameters were greatly affected by the operating conditions. As can be seen in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the kinetic parameters were greatly affected by the operating conditions. The highest H2 production was obtained at pH 5 and 26 °C, which could be explained because the cultured used in the test was adapted to pH 5 for six months. The length of the lag phase decreased as temperatures increased, due to the enhancement of the microbial metabolisms, being null at pH 4 and 26 °C. The pH did not shown a significant effect on the lag phase. Regarding to the kinetic of the fermentation process it was observed an increase in the H2 production rate as pH and temperature increased, being the highest production rate 265.2 ml/h for the culture operated at pH 6 and 40 °C. Because of this temperature dependency, the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)) was used to determine the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy. (3) L n ( Q ) = ln ( A ) − E a R ( 1 T ) where A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the universal gas constant, Ea is the activation energy and Q is the H2 production rate (ml H2/h) from the modified Gompertz equation. This relationship was examined for pH 5 and 6, corresponding to the experiments without inhibition. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The correlation coefficients confirmed the goodness-of-fit to the Arrhenius equation. As can be seen in Table 2, both constants (A and Ea ) increased as the pH increased."
11,Response surface of hydrogen production,"3.3 Response surface of hydrogen production The hydrogen production results were fitted to the equation proposed by Cuetos et al. (2007) [15], and the values shown in Eq. (4) were obtained. (4) β = − 18333.2 + 8983.4 X − 161.6 Y − 829.9 X 2 + 1.26 Y 2 + 0.95 X Y where β is the corresponding H2 production (ml), X and Y are the actual values of the pH and temperature (°C), respectively. The goodness-of-fit was evaluated by an analysis of variance tests, the results were used to determine whether the model was able to explain the experimental data. This was confirmed because the p-values obtained were higher than 0.05, indicating that the equation proposed (Eq. (4)) adequately reproduced the experimental results with a 95% confidence level. This was also confirmed by the correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.965), indicating that the model explains 96.5% of the variability in the response variable. Additionally, the adjusted-R (0.922) showed that 92.2% of the sample variation for H2 production could be attributed to independent variables. From the fitting, it was observed that middle values of pH (i.e., around 5.5) were the best values to produce H2 at all temperatures. This could be related to the fact that the acclimatization was carried out a very similar pH. The amount of H2 produced drastically decreased when the pH decreased to 4, and it slightly decreased when pH was increased to 6. On the other hand, the effect of temperature showed that cumulative H2 production increased as temperature decreased in the investigated range (26–40 °C). Compared with temperature, pH had a more significant effect on the H2 production via acidogenic fermentation. In order to determine the maximum H2 production, partial derivatives of Eq. (4) with respect to the corresponding variables (pH and temperature) were set to zero. The estimated optimum operating conditions was found to be at pH of 5.4 and 26 °C. Under these conditions, the expected H2 production and yield were 2760 ml and 1 mol/mol, respectively. Moreover, the expected hydrogen concentration should be around 50% hydrogen in the gas phase, a value similar to that obtained at the experiment performed at pH 5 and 26 °C. In terms of pH, these results are very similar to those reported in literature [19,20]. In terms of temperature, they are very similar to those obtained by Gadhamshetty et al. (2009) [21]. However, most literature reports report best results at higher temperatures. These results are summarized in Bartacek et al. (2007) [22], which describes the results of some studies focused on glucose fermentation. A possible reason for this disagreement could be the operational pH and the VFA concentration in the bulk liquid, which controls the non-dissociated acids concentrations and the energy required for maintenance of the microorganisms."
12,Hydrogen production as a function of VFAs and pH,"3.4 Hydrogen production as a function of VFAs and pH Hydrogen production by acidogenic microorganisms is always accompanied by the production of VFA. Therefore, changes in VFA production reflect changes in the metabolism of the microorganisms. Moreover, pH has been confirmed as an important factor influencing the activities of hydrogen producing bacteria because it may affect the hydrogenase activity as well as metabolic pathways [7]. Therefore, bio-hydrogen production could be estimated as a function of pH and VFA production. The theoretical yield of hydrogen production when fermenting glucose to produce acetate is 4 mol hydrogen per mole of glucose fermented and 2 hydrogen per mole of glucose fermented when the fermentation end product is butyrate. However, other acids or solvents such as propionate, lactate, formate, etc. can be produced during the fermentation processes entailing either the production or consumption of hydrogen [13,23,24]. Even acetate could be produced by the activity of homoacetogens consuming therefore H2 [25]. Therefore, the hydrogen production from a mixed culture is be very different depending on the catabolic products formed and the pathways used. Table 3 summarizes the experimental results of VFA and hydrogen production in each test. These experimental data shown that acetic acid production decreased when the pH was high and the temperature was low. The general trend of butyric acid was to increase when pH values were high, similar to that reported by Wang et al. (2006) [24]. Also, the temperature value was important, and butyric production increased at low temperatures. The production of lactic acid increased when the pH was low and the temperature was high, although production of this acid fell drastically at pH 5, similar to results obtained by Zoetemeyer et al. (1982) [18]. Propionic and formic acids were only produced in a significant concentration under some specific operational conditions. The experimental data showed an important increase in propionic concentration at pH 5 and 6 and 40 °C. Ren et al. (1997) [26] found that the pH must be maintained at about 4.5 units to avoid onset of propionic fermentation, which is in accordance with the results obtained in this research. Formic acid concentration was near zero when the pH was 4 and 5, and it was only produced when the culture was operated at pH 6, similar results have been previously reported in literature [13]. To estimate hydrogen released from the acid production, the amount of each acid was multiplied by a theoretical stoichiometric factor, which was constant for each pH. These factors are shown in Table 4 , and they correspond to the amount of hydrogen obtained from each unit of acid produced. The sum of the hydrogen estimated from every acid was the total estimated hydrogen, which was very similar to experimental data for hydrogen production (Table 3). The values of hydrogen production per unit of acid produced (Table 4) were approximately constant and were near the stoichiometric values. Only the hydrogen value obtained from acetate was significantly different from the stoichiometric data and shifted as a function of pH. This value increased from −0.03 to 0.53 when the pH was increased from 4 to 6. These results again demonstrate the major importance of pH as factor influencing hydrogen production. This is because by shifting the hydrogen produced per unit of VFA, as a function of pH, it was possible to obtain a good approximation of the hydrogen produced."
13,Conclusions,"The main purpose of this work was to study the influence of pH and temperature on the acidogenesis and hydrogen production from glucose fermentation. Acidogenic fermentation was inhibited at pH 4 and temperatures above 26 °C resulting in incomplete substrate conversion at higher temperatures. This inhibition was related to the effect of accumulating amounts of non-dissociated acids during the batch experiments. Hydrogen production was modeled by using a modified Gompertz equation. The most significant results from this approach were the increase in hydrogen production rate as the pH and temperature increased. Moreover, the experimental data for hydrogen production were fitted to an equation model (response surface) that explained 96.5% of the variability in the response variable. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production were pH 5.4 and 26 °C. Hydrogen production per mole of each acid produced was also evaluated. The hydrogen produced per unit of each acid produced was constant under different operating conditions and was near the theoretical values for all the acids except for acetate. The values for acetate increased as pH increased. These facts indicate that pH has a more significant effect than temperature on acidogenesis."
