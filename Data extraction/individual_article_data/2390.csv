0,Introduction,"The demand for energy is continuously increasing with population growth, industrialization and urbanization. Approximately 30% of world energy consumption is used for transportation, which predominantly includes internal combustion engines fuelled by fossil-based gasoline and diesel. The demand for diesel is expected to increase at a higher rate than that of gasoline due to the increasing fraction of heavy-duty vehicles in the vehicular count. In contrast, the growth in gasoline demand will be slower due to significant improvements in engine efficiency from engine downsizing and turbocharging and lighter vehicular weights [1]. Recent trends in internal combustion engine research and development have significantly involved multi-fuel engine operation [2–6]. This approach seeks to match different vehicle power requirements, stricter emissions regulations and fuel economy expectations while not sacrificing the driving quality expected by vehicle operators. One of the fundamental concerns in transportation engines is to minimize the use of depleting fossil fuels [7]. Crude oil deposits will not last forever. Some statistics suggest that with the current crude oil extraction rate, there will be no more oil within 50 years. Therefore, it is highly important to look for alternative sources of energy that are renewable, clean, cheap and abundantly available, with calorific values comparable to those of gasoline and diesel. Alcohol fuels such as methanol and ethanol, as well as plant-based biofuels, are being actively researched and utilized as alternative liquid fuels [8–10]. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is a very promising gaseous alternative fuel with good adaptability to both spark-ignition (SI) and compression–ignition (CI) engines [11–13]. Electric-powered vehicles in the form of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have made significant impacts in the automotive market, capturing 0.2% of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2017, an increase of 60% from the previous year [14]. The use of alternative fuels is not optimized because most engines are designed for conventional gasoline and diesel. Optimizing the benefit of alternative fuels requires an engine architecture matching the intrinsic properties of different fuels. Therefore, utilizing these alternative fuels as blends with gasoline and diesel is more practical [15]. However, when alternative fuels are mixed with gasoline or diesel, emission reductions occur with some trade-off in brake power [16,17]. Methane and hydrogen are considered the two cleanest fuels with respect to emissions of oxides of carbon. Some key combustion parameters of these two gaseous fuels are shown in Table 1. Methane has a slower flame speed, wider flammability limits and a higher auto-ignition temperature (537 °C) than gasoline (246–280 °C) and diesel (257 °C). Therefore, the tendency to ignite in the case of accidental leakage is less than that of gasoline or diesel [18]. CNG and methane have been widely used in diesel engines, and the advantages of reduced CO2 and particulate emissions has been noted in many works, but high HC and CO emissions remain a challenge [19–21]. It was found that the in-cylinder distribution of methane during combustion contributed to HC emissions [22]. Unfortunately, when methane (CNG in its practical form) is used with gasoline or diesel, a lower output power is reported, mainly due to the lower molar energy content and slower flame speed [23–25]. When hydrogen reacts with air, the emissions of CO, CO2, soot and HC are significantly low, but high amounts of NOx are released as a result of the high combustion temperature (above 1600 °C and sufficient residence time) [27,28]. Hydrogen possesses a high specific energy content, burns at a high flame speed and requires a low ignition energy. It displays wide flammability limits of 4%–75% by volume in air, which enables hydrogen engines to operate with very lean mixtures for increased brake thermal efficiency [29]. However, the high rate of pressure rise and heat release rate (HRR) can make hydrogen-enriched engine operation unstable, especially at high hydrogen fractions. The flame speed advantage can significantly reduce negative work with a minimal spark advancing requirement. The use of hydrogen in diesel engines significantly decreases CO and particulate emissions, particularly at higher hydrogen fractions, but with the penalty of increased total hydrocarbons and NOx [30,31]. The advantage of hydrogen–diesel​ use in terms of reduced emissions and increased brake thermal efficiencies depends largely on the injection timing, diesel injection pressure and optimal use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) [3]. The tri-fuel operation of hydrogen and methane/CNG in diesel engines extends the engine improvement obtained with bi-fuel operation (H2-diesel or CNG-diesel) because the fuels complement each other to reduce problems in combustion stability and emission. Such tri-fuel operation in a DICI engine was previously investigated both experimentally and computationally with 40%, 50% and 60% diesel mass percentages while the remaining contents were a mix of hydrogen and methane at various ratios. The results showed a significant combustion improvement and emission reduction at an optimized mixture ratio of 70% hydrogen and 30% methane, regardless of diesel content [32–35]. While the blend ratio aspect has been investigated and understood, other engine operating parameters such as temperature can impact this tri-fuel mixture formation because a high fraction of the blend is in the gas phase. In this paper, a further investigation of this tri-fuel operation with respect to both the blend ratio and intake air temperature (Ti) was carried out computationally to understand the effects of changing the cylinder initial conditions for various ambient temperature regimes: near standard (303 K), high ambient (318 K) and extremely high ambient (338 K). A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was used to analyse the combustion characteristics and emissions produced by a tri-fuel direct-fuel-injection compression ignition (DICI) engine. Diesel at a 60% mass ratio was blended with a 40% blend of CH4 and H2 with various mass ratios: 40% CH4, 28% CH4/12% H2, 20% CH4/20% H2, 12% CH4/28% H2 and 40% H2. The emissions of CO and NOx, in-cylinder pressure, HRR and in-cylinder temperature were measured and analysed."
1,Methodology,
2,Simulations procedure,"2.1 Simulations procedure A numerical study is selected as the most efficient and cost effective approach to investigate the combustion characteristics and emission of a direct injection compression ignition (DICI) engine fuelled with hydrogen, methane and diesel fuel. A single-cylinder Yanmar-L100AE-D diesel engine was modelled and simulated using ANSYS FLUENT Workbench 14.5. Details on these simulation steps and the employed chemical reactions can be found in a previous work [33]. ANSYS-Design Modular was used to construct the geometry of the combustion chamber. The simulation covered only the period between the intake valve closed (IVC) and exhaust valve open (EVO) events (from a crank angle (CA) of 53°CA ABDC to 53°CA BBDC). The exclusions of the intake and exhaust process is to only focus on the combustion process and shortened the simulation time consumption. The fuel injector inclination was 85° from vertical. A dynamic mesh was used to simulate the combustion of the direct injection of six different blends of diesel with hydrogen and methane, as illustrated in Table 1. A hybrid finite-rate/eddy-dissipation model was employed to simulate the turbulent species transport combustion process. As shown in Table 2, six blends of 60% diesel (C12H23) by mass with various H2 and CH4 mass percentages as homogeneous mixtures were studied with respect to different T i values: 30 °C (303 K), 45 °C (318 K) and 65 °C (338 K). Adding higher methane and hydrogen percentage leads to leaner mixture and increase the energy contents of the mixture. Hydrogen with the dominants energy contents (80 MJ/kg) can increase the energy contents significantly and boost up the combustion. Chemical species mixing and transport were solved using conservation equations involving the diffusion, convection and reaction of each species in multi-chemical reactions. The turbulent species transport combustion was solved using the finite-rate/eddy-dissipation model [36]. The equations included 1-step and 4-step chemical reactions. The 1-step reaction refers to the Westbrook and Dryer global chemical kinetics scheme, which involves 5 species (CH4, CO2, H2O, O2 and N2). The 4-step reaction refers to the Jones and Lindstedt reduced chemical kinetics scheme, which involves 7 species (CH4, CO2, H2O, O2, CO, H2 and N2) [37]. To simulate dual and tri fuels, modification of the model was necessary. Combustion was initiated by diesel auto-ignition, and the products were solved with initial mass fractions of 0.01. The convection–diffusion relation shown in Eq. (1) was used to determine Y m , the mole fraction of species m, according to [38], where R is the production net rate and S is the formation rate. This equation provides a solution for N − 1 species, where N is the number of species in the liquid phase. (1) ∂ ρ Y m ∂ t + ∇ ρ υ Y M = − ∇ J m + R m + S m The model used to simulate injection was used for primary break-up, while the wave model was used for secondary break-up [39]. Pure diesel was applied as droplet particles. Multi-body and multi-dimensional collisions were based on a stochastic collision–coalescence model. The RNG k- ɛ model was used for in-cylinder turbulence simulation. The finite-rate/eddy-dissipation model was employed for combustion simulation. The reaction rates were controlled by turbulence, which required a single-step reaction mechanism [40]. All hydrogen was assumed to completely burn, producing water vapour,​ and the combustion products consisted of CO2, CO and H2O [41]. The direct injection diesel engine combustion simulation adopted the Hardenburg auto-ignition model due to the proven suitability of the model [42]. Eq. (2) describes the correlation involving the transport of species Y i g . (2) ∂ ρ Y i g ∂ t + ∇ . ( ρ ν Y i g ) = ∇ . μ t S c t ∇ Y i g + ρ S i g The ignition delay ( τ i d ) was calculated based on Eq. (3). (3) τ i d = C 1 + 0 . 22 S ¯ p 6 N exp E a 1 R T − 1 17 , 190 + 21 . 2 p − 12 . 4 e p In this equation, C1 = 0.36, and N, the engine speed, was set at 1500 rpm; the effective activation energy is E a , and the pressure exponent is ep. The other boundary condition was a compression ratio (CR) of 19.3. The wall initial temperature and cylinder pressure were set at 380 K and 1.0 bar, respectively. Wall temperature measurements were not included, based on a previous study [43]. Diesel at 341 K and 190 bar was injected through a 0.22 mm muzzle with a spray cone angle of 15°. The mass flow rate from the fuel injector was set at 3.85 kg/h. The start of injection (SOI) was at 13°CA BTDC, and injection was terminated at 0°CA TDC. Methane and hydrogen were port-injected, and the presence of these compounds in the intake air was defined by the species mass fraction. The CO and NO x emissions were based on the dissociation of carbon dioxide and the extended Zeldovich mechanism [44]. The equivalence ratios of the premixed air–gas fuel mixtures shown in Table 2 were determined from Eq. (4) based on previous literature [45] and used to compute the normalized energy content for all blends. (4) λ = m air ( m D . AFR D ( st ) + m G . AFR G ( st ) ) The normalized energy content was set to 1 for 100% diesel operation. The hydrogen specific energy was set at 80 MJ/kg, and the methane specific energy was 50 MJ/kg. Therefore, increasing the hydrogen content elevated the total energy content more significantly. The percent increase in injected energy content is depicted as normalized energy content in Fig. 1. The blending of gaseous fuels increases the energy content of the cylinder charge from 11% in the case of 40% methane to 42% with 40% hydrogen. A schematic diagram of the experimental engine setup that have been done in previous study [35] is shows in Fig. 2. The engine test was conducted on a single cylinder engine and was coupled with an Eddy current dynamometer. The KANE gas analyser were used to detect NOx and CO emission. The specification of the YANMAR L100AE-D engine and operation parameters employed in the simulation are shown in Table 3. The experiment was done for 60D-20H-20CH4 at 1500 rpm condition parameter for validation purpose. For the simulation, the combustion chamber geometry model consists of a bowl-in-piston with hemispherical groove on the piston only without any valves. The process of simulation is carried out by define the boundaries and the using the CFD moving mesh for the combustion analysis."
3,Reaction mechanism,"2.2 Reaction mechanism The combustion simulation was based on the eddy break-up (EBU) model. To simplify the large number of species and reactions in diesel combustion, a mechanism was devised according to the reduced alkane combustion mechanism of Jones and Lindstedt [46]. The diesel ( C 12 H23) combustion reactions are described by Eq. (5) through Eq. (8). (5) C 12 H 23 + 6 O 2 → 12 CO + 11 . 5 H 2 (6) C 12 H 23 + 12 H 2 → 12 CO + 23 . 5 H 2 (7) H 2 + 0 . 5 O 2 ↔ H 2 O (8) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 The methane reaction consists of three global reaction steps, assumed to be 100% methane oxidation [47]. (9) H 2 + 0 . 5 O 2 → H 2 O (10) CH 4 + 0 . 5 O 2 → CO + 2 H 2 (11) CO + 0 . 5 O 2 → C O 2 However, the hydrogen reaction consists of only one global reaction step [38]. (12) H 2 + 0 . 5 O 2 → H 2 O The mixture was assumed to obey the ideal gas law. The properties of each species were included in determining the thermal conductivity, viscosity and specific heat of the mixture as a function of temperature. Both local and instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium values were included to determine the mass fractions of combustion products. The equilibrium composition of the cylinder is highly dependent on pressure, temperature, and the equivalence ratio [48]. In this CFD calculation, the chemical species considered were O 2 , CO2, H 2 O, N 2 , H 2 , CO, NO x and 100% methane (CH4) [49]."
4,Grid dependency and simulation validation,"2.3 Grid dependency and simulation validation Initially, the simulations were performed with two mesh configurations – a coarse mesh with 5837 cells and a refined mesh with 11019 cells – as shown in Fig. 3. The cylinder pressure profiles with the two configurations shown in Fig. 4 showed no apparent advantage with the refined mesh, but the CPU cost is tripled. Therefore, the coarse mesh was adopted throughout modelling. Validation for tri-fuel injection was performed for the 60D-20H-20CH4 condition that was previously studied [33,35], and the results from the validation are compared with past work in Fig. 5. The comparison shows good agreement between the computational and experimental data. The highest discrepancy between the computed and experimental in-cylinder pressure was only 7.1%. The average variation over the range was less than 1% from the experimental data."
5,Results and discussion,"A DICI engine fuelled with blends of 60% diesel and various mixtures of methane and hydrogen totalling 40% was modelled and simulated using ANSYS FLUENT. The engine speed was set at 1500 rpm, while the equivalence ratio ranged between 0.833 and 0.941. The results obtained for the combustion and emission characteristics are presented in the forms of cylinder pressure, HRR, cylinder temperature, NO x emission and CO emission in a CA range of 340–420°CA"
6,In-cylinder pressure,"3.1 In-cylinder pressure The in-cylinder pressure at CA between 60° BTDC and 60° ATDC are shown in Figs. 6–8 for T i values of 303 K, 318 K and 348 K, respectively. Increasing T i resulted in an increased peak cylinder pressure. In the baseline operation with 100% diesel, the peak pressure was found to increase from 62 bar to 70 bar and 77 bar upon increasing the inlet temperature from 303 K to 318 K and 338 K, respectively. The presence on gaseous fuels in the blends clearly intensified the in-cylinder pressure. This change is mainly due to increased charge heating values in the presence of fuels containing higher energy – methane (50 MJ/kg) and hydrogen (80 MJ/kg) – as depicted in Fig. 1. Adding methane to the blend increased the cylinder pressure but with an extended ignition delay due to the slower methane flame speed. The peak cylinder pressure values for 60D-40CH4 were 78 bar, 84 bar and 100 bar for T i values of 303 K, 318 K and 338 K, respectively. However, as the hydrogen fraction in the blend increased, the ignition delay shortened, and the peak cylinder pressure sharply increased. The higher flame speed of hydrogen mitigates the slower burning of methane, and hydrogen has a higher specific energy content. Increasing the hydrogen fraction also increases the peak pressure. Maximum pressures were found with the 60D-40H blend at 130 bar, 137 bar and 144 bar at T i = 303 K, 318 K and 338 K, respectively. Fig. 9 summarizes the effects of the fuel blend and T i on the peak cylinder pressure. The increase in peak pressure was linearly proportional to the intake temperature and the hydrogen fraction in the fuel mix. The increase in peak pressure was between 92% and 108%, as shown for the case of T i = 338 K from 7.5 MPa (75 bar) to 14.4 MPa (144 bar) and for the case of T i = 303 K, from 6.1 MPa (61 bar) to 12.7 MPa (127 bar)."
7,Heat release rate,"3.2 Heat release rate The HRR is shown in Figs. 10–12 for operation with T i = 303 K, 318 K and 338 K, respectively. The maximum HRR is a complex function of T i and the gas fuel percentage in the blend as T i increases. Generally, the peak HRR values increased with increasing intake temperature. With a T i of 303 K, the peak HRR values were 45.8 bar, 75 bar, 105.5 bar, 240 bar, 336 bar and 345 bar as the blend progressed from baseline to 60D-40CH4 and finally 60D-40H. The CA location of these values was retarded at higher methane ratios, but the increase in hydrogen fraction advanced the CA of the peak HRR. However, with a T i of 318 K, at blends beyond a 20% hydrogen ratio, the peak HRR decreased and then increased with a retarded CA location, while the peak HRR ranged between 55.3 bar and 468 bar, a 26%–36% increase in the peak HRR compared to that obtained at a T i of 303 K. At a T i of 338 K, greater variation in peak HRR values and CA locations can be observed. The peak HRR started from 70.7 bar at baseline and peaked at 558.8 bar with 60D-28H-12CH4, a 61%–62% increase from the HRR obtained for T i = 303 K. The peak HRR CA location first held and then retarded at 367°CA, then advanced to 364°CA and 362°CA. The effects of methane and hydrogen are contradictory in terms of the time required to reach the peak HRR. At all intake temperatures, introducing methane into the blend increased the time to reach the peak HRR even though the maximum HRR increased. This delay was compensated by the addition of a hydrogen percentage to the blend. This linear-to-complex HRR behaviour can be attributed to the variation in cylinder charge energy content resulting from the variation in the equivalence ratio shown in Table 1, in addition to the increased blend calorific values as a result of the presence of hydrogen and methane, as shown in Fig. 1."
8,In-cylinder temperature,"3.3 In-cylinder temperature The in-cylinder temperature between 300°CA and 420°CA at three different T i values is shown in Figs. 13–15. Fig. 16 summarizes the in-cylinder peak temperature of every fuel blend. Similar to the observations of pressure behaviour, the software treats the combustion gas according to the ideal gas relation (PV = ZRT). The concern with respect to combustion temperature is NO x formation, which is significant at temperatures above 1600 °C (1873 K). This temperature was not exceeded in the baseline cases at any intake temperatures or with 60D-40CH4 blends except for T i = 338 K, at which any addition to gaseous fuel caused the peak cylinder temperature to exceed 1873 K, thus signifying NO x formation. With T i = 303 K, the minimum peak temperature was 1200 K, which was produced by baseline operation. Then, the temperature gradually increased with the presence of methane/hydrogen in the blend until the peak value reached 3050 K, an increase of 154%. The CA locations of the peak temperature were retarded by the presence of methane, but as the hydrogen fraction increased, the peak temperature occurrence advanced at approximately the same time at the baseline. With T i = 318 K, a linear increase in peak cylinder temperatures was observed from 1520 K at the baseline to the maximum of 3510 K with 60D-40H operation, with a 131% lower temperature increase than that in the case of T i = 303 K. At T i = 318 K, the peak temperature CA locations were advanced compared to the baseline locations in all blends containing hydrogen. With the highest T i of 338 K, the minimum and maximum peak temperatures were 1750 K and 3700 K, respectively, showing a 111% increase. Furthermore, all peak temperature CA locations were advanced with respect to the baseline case in the presence of gaseous fuels in the blend. The results showed that adding gaseous fuels resulted in an in-cylinder temperature increase above the threshold of NO x formation, as well as the advanced occurrence of peak temperature. The peak temperature increase was linear with respect to the hydrogen percentage in the blend and was proportional to the increase in T i , as depicted by Fig. 9. The in-cylinder temperature distribution at 360–380°CA during the expansion stroke with respect to different T i values for all blends is shown in Fig. 17. The profile clearly shows that increasing T i results in a higher overall temperature during the process and expedites ignition. Introducing methane and hydrogen into the blend further elevated the temperature, and a higher overall in-cylinder temperature was evident when the hydrogen percentage increased. The highest temperature was found with the D-28H-12CH4 blend. However, the temperature dropped as methane was removed from the blends."
9,NOx emissions,"3.4 NOx emissions The NO x emissions are heavily dependent on the in-cylinder temperature. The NO x emissions with T i = 303 K, 318 K and 338 K are shown in Figs. 17–19, respectively. The peak values across the entire blend spectrum are shown in Fig. 20. The NO x emissions with T i = 303 K for the baseline, 60D-40CH4 and 60D-28CH4-12H are all below a 0.0002 mass fraction, as shown in Fig. 17 (right). Significant increases to mass fraction values above 0.01 occur with a hydrogen content above 20%, and a peak mass fraction of 0.033 occurs with 60D-40H. When T i was 318 K, the peak NO x emissions for both the 12% and 20% CH4 blends increased above 0.001 to a 0.004 mass fraction. The remaining blends produced NO x at mass fractions between 0.028 and 0.04, proportional to the increase in hydrogen content. At the highest T i of 338 K, only the baseline case produced NO x below a 0.001 mass fraction, while the remaining blends produced mass fractions between 0.005 and 0.048. The increase was proportional to the hydrogen content. The increase in NO x emissions is largely a function of T i and the hydrogen content in the fuel blends due to the increase in the injected charge energy when methane and hydrogen are present. Higher Ti results to higher NOX emission which results the highest NOX emission belongs to 338 K, followed by 318 K and 303 K. The rate of percentage difference between NOx emission with different Ti is 28.5%. The contribution of methane to the increase in NO x is less significant than that of hydrogen because the specific energy content of methane is only 14% greater than that of diesel, while hydrogen is 172% more energetic. Furthermore, the flame speed of methane is less than that of diesel. Thus, the effects of methane on the combustion intensity, and thus the increase in pressure and temperature, are significantly less than those of hydrogen. Fig. 21 shows NOx emissions of various fuel blends at different temperature."
10,CO emissions,"3.5 CO emissions The CO emissions with three different T i values are shown in Figs. 22–24, while the peak values for all cases are summarized in Fig. 25. CO formation is a precursor of incomplete combustion attributed to poor mixing, slow flame speed and dissociation. The figures show that the presence of methane increased the CO peak value proportional to the percentage of methane in the fuel blends. For example, in Fig. 22, the CO mass fraction was 0.004 with diesel operation, but as soon as methane was introduced (60D-40CH4), the peak CO value sharply increased to 0.025. However, the peak values decreased as hydrogen was added, and the methane ratio gradually decreased. The peak CO values were then reduced to 0.024, 0.015, 0.013 and 0.006 as the methane content was reduced to 28%, 20%, 12% and 0%, respectively. Another observation is that CO is produced over a larger range of CAs as the methane fraction is reduced. The effects of increasing Ti derived from Figs. 23 and 24 show that the CO peak value increases with increasing intake temperature but the formation duration is reduced. The average of percentage difference of CO emission with different T i is 26.8%. These observations indicate that CO formation is affected by the presence of methane due to the slower flame speed of methane than diesel and hydrogen and the slower mixing time of gaseous fuel with air and liquid fuels. Adding hydrogen to the fuel blend compensates for this shift because hydrogen is a non-carbon fuel and has a significantly higher flame speed. From Fig. 25, the peak CO values first increase with methane addition but then gradually decrease with the further addition of hydrogen. However, even with a 40% hydrogen content, the CO peak values are higher than that of the baseline. This difference can be attributed to CO formation due to dissociation at high combustion temperatures."
11,Conclusion,"Dual-fuel operation of hydrogen–diesel or methane–diesel are the excellent ideas but tri-fuel operation in DICI engines with diesel, methane and hydrogen is more advantageous because the former compensates for disadvantages in terms of combustion stability and the emissions of carbon and NO x . The combustion and emission characteristics of a DICI engine fuelled with different blends of 60% diesel with methane–hydrogen at 40%–0%, 28%–12%, 20%–20%, 12%–28% and 0%–40% mass percentages were analysed. The results were presented in terms of the in-cylinder pressure, in-cylinder temperature, HRR and emissions of NO x and CO. Blending diesel with methane and hydrogen increased the injected charge energy by between 11% and 42%, while the equivalence ratio first increased at a higher methane content and then decreased as the hydrogen fraction increased. The peak in-cylinder pressure increased with increased T i and gaseous fuel addition to the blend. The effects of the presence of hydrogen on this increase were higher than those of methane due to the higher calorific value and faster flame speed of hydrogen, even with the variation in the resulting equivalence ratio. The effects of the mixture blend and T i on the in-cylinder temperature presented the same behaviour as the in-cylinder pressure. Thus, the HRR also increased with T i , the addition of gaseous fuels and the increase in hydrogen content. The HRR peak values increased and the occurrences advanced in most cases. The formation of NO x increased with increasing T i and hydrogen fraction because both of these changes increased the peak combustion temperature above the NO x formation threshold temperature. The formation of CO increased with the methane percentage in the blend, and the peak value increased with increasing T i . However, a positive effect of increasing T i is a reduction in the CO formation time. Increasing the hydrogen percentage reduced CO formation but not below the level obtained for pure diesel operation, which can be attributed to the dissociation at higher combustion temperatures with hydrogen. The benefits of diesel–methane–hydrogen can be easily discovered by balancing the blend ratio at the suitable initial condition to achieve a higher output power and lower emissions of NO x and CO."
