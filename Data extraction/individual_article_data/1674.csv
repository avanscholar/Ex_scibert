0,Introduction,"Current global technologies for energy production and supply rely mainly on fossil fuels causing rapid depletion of these resources and increasing carbon dioxide emissions as energy consumption continues to increase. The biological production of hydrogen, which is a renewable energy carrier, can mitigate this trend and lessen the concerns linked with fossil fuel use. Biohydrogen production methods are more sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and less energy intensive compared with current methods of energy production (Gomez-flores et al., 2015; Kapdan and Kargi, 2005; Lay, 2001). The main light-independent process for biohydrogen production is dark fermentation. Biomasses that are rich in carbohydrates are the most-suitable feedstocks for biohydrogen production using fermentative anaerobic bacteria (Chen et al., 2006; Ntaikou et al., 2010). The use of low-cost feedstock is necessary in creating a cost-effective technology. Lignocellulosic materials such as agricultural residues (e.g. corn stalks, corn cobs, sugar cane bagasse, rice straw), hardwood (e.g. poplar wood, aspen wood) and softwood (e.g. red cedar, red oak) are generally found in abundance as agricultural or industrial by-products with little or no commercial value (Cantarella et al., 2004; Costa Lopes et al., 2013; Du et al., 2010; Fenske et al., 1998; Lynd et al., 1996; Polman, 1994). In agriculture, most of these wastes are left unused on the fields after harvest, thus creating environmental problems and a waste of potential renewable resource (Pan et al., 2010). Carbohydrates in lignocellulosic biomass are usually complex and not just simple hexose or pentose sugars (Galbe and Zacchi, 2012). It is relatively difficult for microorganisms to degrade the cellulosic and hemicellulosic polymers of lignocellulosic materials to yield sugars. These complex compounds need to be broken down into simpler forms for easy conversion to hydrogen gas (Cao et al., 2010). In order to enhance the yield and rate of biohydrogen production, lignocellulosic biomass must therefore undergo pre-treatment. Several pre-treatment methods using steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), acid, alkali, liquid hot water and many others have been employed (Cantarella et al., 2004; Du et al., 2010; Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Acids, particularly dilute acid pre-treatment, have been widely used with respect to biohydrogen production as it is considered the easiest, most efficient, and cost-effective method that produces high sugar yields and suitably changes the structure of the substrate to facilitate fermentation (Cao et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2009; Mosier et al., 2005; Panagiotopoulos et al., 2009; Pattra et al., 2008). However, this process generates fermentation inhibitors such as furan derivatives (aldehydes including furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural), ketones, phenols (such as vanillin, syringaldeyde) and organic acids (such as acetic acid) (Allen et al., 2010; Klinke et al., 2004). The hemicellulosic fraction of lignocellulose undergoes hydrolysis at high temperatures and pressures; and in the presence of dilute acids, yield monomeric sugars (mainly pentoses) in a reaction known as the Maillard reaction (Cantarella et al., 2004; Navarro, 1994). Under these conditions, the inhibitor furfural, is released as a by-product when the pentose sugars undergo dehydration. This inhibitor has been shown to have toxic effects on cells causing damage by inhibiting enzymes produced by microorganisms during hydrolysis and fermentation of sugars resulting in low biohydrogen production rates and yields (Allen et al., 2010; Cantarella et al., 2004). Furfural also alters the growth of microorganisms by impeding enzymes responsible for fermentation, thus affecting their membrane integrity (Mills et al., 2009; Quéméneur et al., 2012). Due to these inhibitory effects, furfural is considered to be a limiting factor in the biological conversion of lignocellulosic materials. Microorganisms have the ability to minimize the effects of furfural as an inhibitor by metabolic switch between pathways where furfural is converted to less toxic compounds such as furfuryl alcohol or furoic acid, if its concentration does not exceed levels that the microorganisms can tolerate (Boopathy et al., 1993; Boyer et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2004, 2005). Hydrolysates can also be detoxified using charcoal, diethyl ether, ion exchange resin, activated carbon, Ca(OH)2 (overliming) or with yeasts in order to increase hydrogen yields (Mateo et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011). It is, however, important to determine the inhibition threshold levels of furfural prior to fermentation so as to maximize biohydrogen production rates and yields as well as reduce toxicity to tolerable levels in order to preserve microbial activity. The inhibitory effects of furfural on fermentative hydrogen production using mixed cultures have not been thoroughly studied. Literature on this subject are few in number with little or no data regarding furfural’s inhibitory concentrations (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Some studies have been done with furfural using pure substrates such as glucose (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015) and xylose (Quéméneur et al., 2012); real hydrolysates (Cantarella et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2010); and pure cultures (Cao et al., 2010; Monlau et al., 2013); and other studies have been carried out to ascertain the effects of pH, substrate concentration and other intermediate products like acetate, butyrate etc., (Ginkel et al., 2001; Khanal et al., 2004). The present study employs the use of a mix of pure sugars and volatile fatty acids as substrate, simulating the composition of a typical real waste hydrolysate at different S°/X° ratios. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to assess the impact of furfural on lignocellulosic hydrolysate using mixed cultures to evaluate hydrogen production potential and ascertain the threshold furfural concentrations that resulted in the maximum hydrogen production rates and yields."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate Mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge was collected from St. Marys Wastewater Treatment Plant, Ontario, Canada and preheated at 70°C for 30min prior to use so as to inactivate non-hydrogen producers (Hafez et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2014). The pH, total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 6.97, 16.2g/L and 12.2g/L respectively. Synthetic hydrolysate was prepared in the laboratory using substrate characteristics simulating the composition of a typical pretreated lignocellulosic hydrolysate. The substrate comprised mainly sugars and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and included (per liter of distilled water): arabinose, 5.9g; xylose, 50g; mannose, 0.3g; galactose, 2.5g; glucose, 6.7g; formate, 1.2g and acetate, 1.8g."
3,Batch setup,"2.2 Batch setup Experiments were conducted in batches using 250mL Wheaton glass serum bottles with working volumes of 200mL under anaerobic conditions. 40mL of seed was added per bottle and the volume of substrate (Vsubstrate) added to each bottle was calculated using the substrate-to-biomass ratio equation as described by Nasr et al. (2014). (1) S ° / X ° ( gCOD / gVSS ) = V substrate ∗ TCOD substrate V seed ∗ VSS seed where Vsubstrate and Vseed are the volumes of substrate and seed respectively in L, TCODsubstrate is the total chemical oxygen demand of the substrate in g/L and VSSseed is the volatile suspended solids content of the seed also in g/L. Four furfural concentrations (4, 2, 1, and 0.5g/L) were tested at S°/X° of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5gCODsubstrate/gVSSseed in triplicates. Batch controls consisted of substrate and seed sludge without furfural while blanks were run with seed sludge only. The composition of nutrient media added to each bottle in mg/L included: CaCl2, 140; MgCl2·6H2O, 160; MgSO4·7H2O, 160; Urea, 1500; Na2CO3, 200; KHCO3, 200; K2HPO4, 15; H3PO4, 500; trace metal solution (TMS), 500 (Hafez et al., 2010). The initial pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.5±0.04 using HCl but was not controlled during the experiment. Buffering capacity was however provided by adding 5g/L NaHCO3 to each bottle. Ten-mL samples were collected from each bottle for initial analysis before the bottles were purged with nitrogen gas to create an anaerobic condition. The batch was operated at a temperature of 37°C in a swirling shaker (MaxQ 4000 Thermo Scientific CA benchtop shaker) at a speed of 180rpm. At the end of the batch, final samples were taken for analysis."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Glass syringes in the range 5–100mL were used at regular intervals to release the gas in the bottles in order to equilibrate with ambient pressure (plunger displacement method) (Chen et al., 2006; Gupta et al., 2015). Hydrogen was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Model 310 SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA) complete with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve column (Mole sieve 5Å, mesh 80/100, 6ft×1/8 in). Argon gas was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min and the temperature of column and TCD were 90°C and 105°C respectively. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was measured using HACH methods and test kits (HACH DRB 200 COD reactor and HACH Odyssey DR 2800 spectrophotometer) (Gomez-flores et al., 2015; Nasr et al., 2014). TSS and VSS were analyzed using standard methods (APHA, 1998). Soluble samples (filtered through 0.45μm filter paper) were used to analyze monomeric sugars, VFAs and furfural using a Dionex IC20 Ion Chromatograph equipped with a refractive index detector (RID) (Perkin Elmer Series 200, PerkinElmer Instruments Inc., USA) and an Aminex® HPX-87H column (BIO-RAD laboratories, USA). The following parameters were used: pump flow rate – 0.6mL/min; mobile phase – 9mM H2SO4, column temperature- 30°C and injection volume of 0.5mL. Statistical analysis using a two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) with post-hoc tests were done with an IBM Corporation Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software."
5,Computational methods,"2.4 Computational methods 2.4.1 Gompertz model The kinetic parameters such as hydrogen production potential (R), hydrogen production rate (H) and lag phase (λ) were obtained at the various test conditions using the modified Gompertz model (Chen et al., 2006). (2) H ( t ) = H . exp - exp R max . e H ( λ - t ) + 1 where H (t) is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL) at time t; H is the hydrogen production potential (mL); Rmax is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); λ is the lag phase (h) and e is 2.71828. Maximum specific hydrogen production rates (max SHPR) in mL/gVSSinitial/h, were obtained by dividing Rmax values by the initial mass of seed added per bottle. These parameters (shown in Table 1 ) were estimated by minimizing the sum of square errors (SSE) between experimental and estimated modeled data carried out on Microsoft Excel. 2.4.2 COD mass balance COD mass balances were calculated based on initial and final TCOD values as well as an equivalent COD for hydrogen produced (8gCOD/gH2) using the following equation (Gupta et al., 2014). (3) COD mass balance ( % ) = TCOD H 2 + TCOD f TCOD i ∗ 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Biohydrogen production,"3.1 Biohydrogen production Batches were set up as detailed in Section 2.2 and run until the daily hydrogen production was less than 1% of the cumulative hydrogen volume, at which point the fermentation was assumed to be complete (Elbeshbishy et al., 2012). Figs. 1 and 2 present the cumulative hydrogen profiles plotted against time (h) at S°/X° 4 and 2 gCOD/gVSS and at S°/X° 1 and 0.5gCOD/gVSS respectively. Fig. 3 shows the cumulative hydrogen production (mL) and hydrogen yield (mlH2/gsugarsinitial) plotted against furfural concentration and S°/X°, after subtracting the volume of hydrogen produced from the blank. All values are averages of triplicate experiments. Upon examination of the hydrogen profiles at all furfural concentrations (0–4g/L), the S°/X° of 4gCOD/gVSS showed two lag phases which could possibly be due to sequential utilization of the substrate by the culture with the simpler sugars (pentoses) being degraded first and the more complex sugars (hexoses) being degraded much later after an adaptation period. This trend was not observed at other S°/X° potentially due to the much lower concentrations of sugars as compared with an S°/X° of 4gCOD/gVSS. At S°/X° of 4 and 2gCOD/gVSS, hydrogen production were higher at both 0.5g/L and 1g/L furfural than even the controls (without furfural) while at the lower S°/X° (1 and 0.5gCOD/gVSS), this trend occurred at only 0.5g/L furfural. It can also be observed that fermentation contact time decreased with decreasing S°/X° indicating that the higher the substrate-to-biomass ratio, the longer it took the microorganisms to degrade the substrate to produce hydrogen. Table 1 presents cumulative hydrogen (mL) and hydrogen yields calculated from cumulative hydrogen figures in molH2/molsugarsinitial. Hydrogen production correlated well with the modified Gompertz model with R2 >0.99. The overall maximum specific hydrogen production rate (MSHPR) of 28.2mL/gVSSinitial/h was observed at 1g/L furfural at an S°/X° of 2gCOD/gVSS. The least SHPR within each S°/X° corresponded to the least maximum hydrogen yield. The maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) for the controls averaged 7.25±0.8mL/h clearly emphasizing that the substrate (sugars) concentration were not limiting across the different S°/X° ratios. The least Rmax within each S°/X° was observed at 4g/L furfural. Lag phase increased on average with increasing furfural concentrations but was least at the furfural concentrations that gave the most yield across all S°/X°, i.e., S°/X° of 4gCOD/gVSS at 1g/L furfural which had the shortest lag phase (9.9h) also showed the overall maximum hydrogen production of 346mL. In general, the shorter the lag phase, the higher the hydrogen yield. There was no definite correlation or trend in Rmax and MSHPR within each S°/X° with respect to increasing furfural concentration. The overall maximum H2 yield of 1.18mol H2/mol sugars was observed at a furfural concentration of 1g/L. The least overall hydrogen yield of 0.08mol H2/mol sugars was observed at an S°/X° of 0.5gCOD/gVSS at 4g/L furfural. Four g/L was the most inhibitory furfural concentration at all S°/X° showing the lowest yields. Within each S°/X°, there was no uniform trend with respect to increasing or decreasing H2 yields whereas, in general, literature results show decreasing volumes of hydrogen produced with increasing furfural or inhibitor concentrations (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). It can however be established that at all S°/X°, furfural concentrations greater than 1g/L were definitely inhibitory as shown by the increase in lag phases and decrease in hydrogen yields."
8,Volatile fatty acids,"3.2 Volatile fatty acids Acetate (HAc) and butyrate (HBu) were the main VFAs observed at all conditions at the end of the batch. Table 2 shows the ratios of the sum of final total volatile fatty acids (TVFAf) and residual sugars (RS) to final soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCODf). Values ranged from 41% to 93% across all test conditions and were least at 4g/L furfural at all S°/X° indicating the difficulty in acidification in the presence of furfural at this concentration thus suggesting a shift in degradation pathways. Sugars were observed to be completely degraded at the lower S°/X° of 0.5 and 1gCOD/gVSS. It can be deduced that sugars were not completely degraded at the higher S°/X° ratios of 2 and 4gCOD/gVSS due to the higher concentration of substrate relative to biomass. VFAs contributed on average, at all experimental conditions, about 67% of the SCODf indicating that other intermediates such as lactate or alcohols, may have been produced. Neither methane, ethanol nor formate were observed in the biogas produced. Over 90% of the furfural was degraded after fermentation at all test conditions. The TVFAs did not clearly increase with an increase in furfural concentration across all S°/X° which is a similar trend to the hydrogen yield. However, over 98% degradation of sugars in all samples was observed. COD balance across all experimental conditions were closed at an average of 94±5% thus confirming the reliability of the data."
9,Impact of furfural,"3.3 Impact of furfural Nakhla et al. (1994) investigated the effect of different toxicant loading rates and biological solids retention time (SRT) on the treatment of phenolic wastes using the sequential batch reactor process. The aforementioned authors reported that high toxicant-to-biomass ratios at high wastage rates caused the system to fail and concluded that inhibition was more closely connected with the mass of toxicant-to-microbial solids ratio than with SRT. According to Nakhla et al. (2007), lower toxicant-to-biomass ratios affected less vulnerability to shock loadings of toxicants and inhibitory substances using a patented biological nutrient removal- liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed (BNR-LSCFB) system for waste water treatment. Jackowiak et al. (2011) mentioned that toxicant concentration, biomass concentration and bacteria acclimation are factors that impact the toxicity of a compound. It was also stated that the inhibitory effects of some toxicants are biomass-dependent (Azov and Goldman, 1982) and one of the ways in which inhibition can be reduced is to decrease the toxicant-to-biomass ratio of the system (Lange et al., 1989). It can therefore be observed that toxicant-to-biomass ratio is a well established parameter used in expressing the toxicity or inhibition of a compound. In the present study, a comparison between hydrogen yields and furfural concentrations was made by examining the initial gfurfural to final gVSS ratio at all experimental conditions. Ideally, the lower the gfurfural to gVSS (furfural-to-biomass (F/B)) ratio, the higher the hydrogen yield. A plot of hydrogen yield (molH2/molsugars) against gfurfuralinitial/gVSSfinal shown in Fig. 4 emphasizes the negative linear correlation observed with relatively high R2 values implying that the higher the F/B the lower the hydrogen yield. Also, irrespective of the S°/X°, pooled hydrogen yields data showed a negative linear correlation (R2 =0.78) to gfurfuralinitial/gsugarsinitial (Fig. 5 ), indicating that both parameters influence hydrogen production. A comparison of the results in the present study with similar batch literature studies (Table 3 ) shows that for each study using the same microbial culture, the lower the gfurfural/gsugarsinitial and gfurfural/gVSSinitial, the higher the hydrogen yield. Also, irrespective of the S°/X°, the hydrogen yields decreased with increasing furfural concentrations. Again, this is true in all cases except at the conditions in this study where hydrogen yields were enhanced. Monlau et al. (2013) reported that the hydrogen yield from glucose decreased from 1.83mol H2/molsugarinitial at 0.17g furfural/gVSSinitial and 0.01g furfural/gsugarinitial to 0mol H2/molsugarinitial at 0.69gfurfural/gVSSinitial and 0.031gfurfural/gsugarinitial despite a relatively constant S°/X° of about 21gsugars/gVSSinitial. The same trend was also observed by Siqueira and Reginatto (2015) despite operating at a lower S°/X° of 7.44gsugars/gVSSinitial. On the other hand, at the lower range of S°/X° values of 0.5–3.6gsugars/gVSSinitial used in this study, the hydrogen yields were relatively higher than yields from other studies carried out at about the same furfural concentration. Furthermore, as evident from the data in Table 3, lag phase generally increased with increasing furfural concentrations indicating the inhibitory effect of furfural. Both acetic and formic acids which were components of the substrate are inhibitory compounds (Cantarella et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2014; Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). It is possible that the synthetic hydrolysate in the presence of furfural and seed sludge used in this study, had an enhancory effect on hydrogen production at low furfural concentrations. In comparison to these results, a study by Cao et al. (2010) which examined hydrogen production and cell growth rate of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 (4%v/v) on acid pretreated corn stover hydrolysate in batches, showed that hydrogen production started to decrease significantly at 1g/L furfural (50.2% inhibition) with little or no hydrogen observed at 1.8g/L furfural. Another study by Nasr et al. (2014) showed that furfural concentrations of <1.09g/L had no impact on hydrogen production from various streams of pre-treated corn cobs using mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge. Batch tests using 40g/L glucose and mixed sludge were set up for fermentative hydrogen production in the presence of furfural (0.25–2g/L) and showed decreasing hydrogen yields with increasing furfural concentrations and no hydrogen was produced at 2g/L furfural (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Monlau et al. (2013) observed a similar trend but with no hydrogen production at 0.4g/L furfural from 5gVS/L glucose in batch tests using mixed cultures. Another batch study using anaerobic digester sludge (ADS) with 5g/L xylose as substrate, reported a 69% decrease in hydrogen yield upon addition of 1g/L furfural (Quéméneur et al., 2012). While generally, all the aforementioned studies observed furfural inhibition, the inhibition threshold levels varied due to changes in furfural-to-sugar and furfural-to-biomass ratios as explained above. Scrutiny of the data in Table 3 reveals that at any given S°/X°, the yields were high and close to optimum at or below furfural-to-sugar ratios of 0.23 and furfural-to-biomass ratios of 0.41. The observation that at the higher S°/X° ratios (4 and 2gCOD/gVSS), furfural enhanced hydrogen yields at 0.5g/L and 1g/L and at the lower S°/X°, yield was enhanced only at 0.5g/L furfural from their respective controls, can be explained using Eq. (4) which presents a thermodynamically favorable reaction proposed by Haroun et al. (2016) where furfural was broken down into acetic acid and hydrogen at low concentrations. (4) C 5 H 4 O 2 + 6 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + 3 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ G = - 152 kJ / mol In fermentation, acetic acid production is a hydrogen-producing pathway (Guo et al., 2010). This observation rationalizes the results obtained in this study as enhancement in hydrogen production and yields were observed at low concentrations of up to 1g/L furfural. Also, a confirmatory test using mesophilic seed only and 1g/L furfural without any substrate was tested and indeed hydrogen was produced thus confirming that mesophilic cultures were able to anaerobically degrade furfural. Liu et al. (2015) reported no hydrogen production at concentrations between 0 and 1g/L furfural but their findings with hydroxylmethyl furfural (HMF) are similar to those in this study. They observed a stimulatory effect on hydrogen production at HMF concentrations of up to 1g/L from steam-exploded corn stalk. They further explained that probably HMF affected the activity of seed sludge, and that the mechanism needs to be further studied."
10,Statistical analysis,"3.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data obtained at various S°/X° and furfural concentrations was performed. Treatment of the experimental results was based on the average of the triplicate cumulative hydrogen values and the two-way ANOVA at a 95% confidence level. The differences between test conditions were considered significant at P <0.05. Results determine whether the variables (S°/X° and furfural concentrations) and their interaction (SX∗Furfural) had statistically significant effects on hydrogen yield suggesting that S°/X° and furfural concentrations were dependent on each other. Results (data not shown) indicate a statistically significant interaction at p=0.000 (since p<0.05) at all S°/X° and furfural concentrations. Maximum hydrogen production rates (R) (mL/h) were analyzed and the same degree of significance was observed. Another test i.e. the Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test (a post-hoc test for multiple comparisons) was carried out following the ANOVA test in order to further investigate which pairs of S°/X° levels (and furfural concentrations) yielded significantly different cumulative hydrogen profiles by comparing two means (Abdi and Williams, 2010). Results (data also not shown) suggest that all pairs of furfural concentrations and S°/X° gave statistically significantly different cumulative hydrogen profiles (p-value<0.05). Multiple regression analysis using Microsoft Excel 2010 was also conducted in order to investigate the impact of gfurfural/gVSSfinal and gfurfural/gsugarsinitial (independent variables) on % inhibition of hydrogen production relative to the control (dependent variable) (data shown in Table 4 ). The 3D plot shown in Fig. 6 was developed using Sigmaplot 12.0 with data from these parameters. The independent variables were expressed in different units necessitating the use of standardized regression coefficients. Thus, the beta coefficient, measured in units of standard deviation, was used to interpret the regression model by revealing the sensitivity of the dependent variable to each of the independent variables (data shown in Table 5 ). Higher coefficient values indicate a greater impact on the dependent variable (Kim and Nakhla, 2009). The statistical relationship between the aforementioned variables are shown in Eq. (5) with an R2 of 0.9 and a 95% confidence level. (5) Y = 5.2 X + 17.2 Z where X=gfur/VSSfinal, Y=inhibition (%) and Z=gfur/gsugarsinitial. The beta coefficients were 0.44 and 0.58 for gfurfural/VSSfinal and gfurfural/gsugarsinitial respectively with positive values indicating a positive relationship with inhibition (%) thus confirming that both parameters affect inhibition. According to the beta coefficients, the impact of gfurfural/gsugarsinitial on inhibition (%) was greater than gfurfural/gVSSfinal."
11,Conclusions,"It can be concluded from this study that an S°/X° of 4gCOD/gVSS was the optimum substrate-to-biomass ratio, as it produced the highest hydrogen yields under the given test conditions. Hydrogen yields were enhanced at all S°/X° ratios tested at low furfural concentrations of ⩽1g/L. Furfural concentrations greater than the threshold concentration of 1g/L were inhibitory. Furfural-to-sugar and furfural-to-biomass ratios are important parameters that influence fermentative hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass, with gfurfural/gsugarsinitial showing a greater impact on the degree of inhibition of hydrogen production than gfurfural/gVSSfinal."
