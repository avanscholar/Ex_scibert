0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels as the traditional main energy source have been over exploited since the industrial revolution. The excessive consumption of fossil fuels leading to global warming have impelled the researchers from all over the world to look for other renewable clean energy [1]. Hydrogen as a clean energy has attracted great interest as a replacement for the traditional energy sources in view of its high heat conversion efficiency and zero carbon emission [2,3]. Hence, it is a promising alternative to solve the current energy crisis and environmental problems. Semiconductor-based photocatalytic production of hydrogen has been the hot subject of tremendous research, since the first discovery of photocatalytic water splitting by n-type TiO2 photo-electrodes in 1972 [4]. Till now, TiO2 has been an intensively investigated photocatalyst to produce hydrogen among a diversity of semiconductors because of its outstanding properties, including chemical stability, non-toxicity and abundant in resources [5]. However, two main limitations of TiO2, including wide band gap (3.2eV for anatase and 3.0eV for rutile) and rapid charge recombination rate, significantly restrict the performance of pure TiO2 [6,7]. Therefore, to date, many approaches have been invented in order to overcome these drawbacks, including metal or nonmetal doping [8–12], coupling with other semiconductors [13–15] and combination with carbon based materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene and graphene oxide (GO)) [16–18]. In particular, graphene/graphene derivatives (GO or other forms of functionalized graphene) based TiO2 composites have attracted an intensive amount of research interests from both energy generation and environmental remediation fields [19–26]. This is because graphene and its derivatives acquire promising properties, such as large specific surface area (theoretically 2600m2/g), fast charge transfer rate, high flexibility and chemical stability [27,28]. In view of these, the light absorption ability of graphene/GO based TiO2 composites can be enhanced due to the existence of graphene/GO sheets [18]. In addition, graphene/GO sheets can facilitate charge transfer and reduce recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, further improving the photocatalytic efficiency [17,29]. To date, there are a few graphene/GO–TiO2 composites have been prepared and applied in the phtotocatalytic hydrogen production field [17,18,30–33]. Zhang et al. synthesized graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites through a sol–gel method using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and GO as precursors [30]. They concluded that graphene/TiO2 composites with 5% graphene sheets exhibit the highest water splitting efficiency, which is much higher than that of P25. Choi and co-workers prepared GO–TiO2 composites by self-assembling P25 nanoparticles on GO sheets and investigated the effects of size of GO sheets on the hydrogen production activity [31]. They reported that the GO–TiO2 composites with small GO sheets could obtain better performance than that with large GO sheets because of enhanced interfacial charge transfer. Very recently, Yu's group investigated the synergetic effect of MoS2 and graphene sheets on the hydrogen production activity of TiO2 nanoparticles [17]. In their work, it has been demonstrated that TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite can achieve a high hydrogen evolution rate even without noble metal (Pt). However, the hydrogen production activities of graphene/GO–TiO2 composites in these reported results were only investigated under neutral pH. According to our previous experiences, graphene/GO–TiO2 composites would be destroyed under alkaline condition due to the damage of interaction between graphene/GO sheets and TiO2 [34,35]. This significantly hinders the application of graphene/GO–TiO2 composites in the basic condition. Hence, it is urgent but challenging to synthesize functionalized graphene/GO–TiO2 composites, which can tolerate different environment and can acquire efficient hydrogen production activity within a wide pH range. In this study, for the first time, we report the highly efficient hydrogen production activity of sulfonated graphene oxide (SG)–TiO2 composites under a wide pH range (from pH=3 to pH=11). SG–TiO2 composites were prepared by a step-wise method. Firstly, SG sheets were synthesized by introducing sulfonic acid groups (−SO3H) into GO sheets through sulfonation reaction. Then, SG–TiO2 composites were prepared via uniformly mixing SG sheets and TiO2 spheres on micro-scale under ultrasonication. The results show that SG–TiO2 composites exhibit significantly higher hydrogen evolution rate than P25 and pure TiO2 spheres under neutral pH. This is because of the outstanding properties of SG–TiO2 composites, including large specific surface area, enhanced light absorption and efficient charge separation. Particularly, SG–TiO2 composites can achieve a high hydrogen evolution rate under alkaline condition, while the hydrogen generation rate of GO–TiO2 was decreased significantly in basic solution. This can be attributed to the strong interaction between SG sheets and TiO2 spheres, endowing it a stable and efficient photocatalyst within a wide pH range. Hence, these novel SG–TiO2 composites can be promising candidates for clean energy production under different environmental condition."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 35%), concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), sodium 2-chloroethanesulfonate hydrate (ClCH2CH2SO3H), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethyl formamide (DMF) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Merck Ltd. In addition, natural graphite (SP1) was obtained from Bay Carbon Company (USA). All chemicals were used without further purification. Furthermore, deionized (DI) water was produced from Millipore Milli-Q water purification system."
3,Synthesis of GO and SG,"2.2 Synthesis of GO and SG GO sheets were prepared according to the modification of Hummer's method [36], and the procedure was reported in the previous work [37–39]. SG sheets were prepared by a sulfonation reaction [40]. Typically, 200mg of GO, 3g of ClCH2CH2SO3H and 1.6g of NaOH were added into 500mL of DI water. The mixture was put under ultrasonication condition for 3h and then 2mL of HNO3 was added into the mixture. Finally, the mixture was washed with ethanol for three times and put into vacuum drier for 2 days."
4,Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 sphere,"2.3 Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 sphere Hierarchical TiO2 spheres were prepared according to the slight modification of previous reported method [41]. In a typical process, 1mL of TBT was added the mixture of 15mL of DMF and 15mL of IPA drop by drop. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (volume: 45mL), which was then heated to 200°C and kept for 20h. The product was collected by centrifugation after the autoclave cooled to room temperature and followed by ethanol washing. Finally, the material was dried at 60°C for 24h and calcined at 450°C for 2h with a ramping rate of 5°C/min."
5,Synthesis of SG–TiO2 composites,"2.4 Synthesis of SG–TiO2 composites A number of SG–TiO2 composites were prepared by adjusting the mass ratio of SG to TiO2. Various amount of as-synthesized SG powder (0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, 3mg and 5mg) was well dissolved in 100mL of DI water. Then, 100mg of as-prepared hierarchical TiO2 sphere was added to the above SG solution, respectively. The mixture was put in the ultrasonic bath for 2h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and put into vacuum drier for further usage. The prepared samples were indicated as SG–TiO2-0.5, SG–TiO2-1, SG–TiO2-2, SG–TiO2-3 and SG–TiO2-5 according to the mass ratio of SG to TiO2."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Surface topography of GO and SG sheets was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, PSIA XE-150). The morphologies of hierarchical TiO2 sphere and SG–TiO2 composites were evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7600F). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of TiO2 and SG–TiO2 were acquired using a JEOL 2010-H microscope (TEM) operating at 200kV. The structure and crystal phase of GO, SG, TiO2 and SG–TiO2 were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000) with monochromated high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å) operated at 40kV and 30mA. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer GX FT-IR system by using compressed KBr disc technique. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done by using a Kratos Axis Ultra Spectrometer with a monochromic Al Kα source at 1486.7eV, with a voltage of 15kV and an emission current of 10mA. The binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by using carbonaceous C 1s line (284.8eV) as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on the spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301). Furthermore, the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) specific surface area of TiO2 and SG–TiO2 was determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) using the Micromeritics ASAP 2040 system. The pore size distribution is calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm according to the BJH model."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production under different pH,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen production under different pH The photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction was performed in a three-necked Pyrex flask (volume: 100mL) with the three openings of the flask were sealed by silicone rubber. 2 low-pressure UVP Pen-Ray mercury lamps (254nm, 5.4mWcm−2, USA) were used as UV light source and put 2cm beside the flask. To maintain a constant reactor temperature of 25°C, the flask was cooled by water under the bottom. 50mg of powdered photocatalyst was suspended in 10vol% methanol water mixture. A magnetic stirrer was placed at the bottom of the reactor to ensure homogeneity of the suspension during reaction. Prior to irradiation, the photocatalyst suspension was de-aerated thoroughly for 30min by nitrogen gas purging. Gas produced via the photocatalytic reaction was analyzed using an off-line TCD-type gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A, HP-PLOT MoleSieve/5A). The pH of the solution was adjusted with dilute NaOH and HCl solution."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Morphology and structure properties of SG–TiO2 composites,"3.1 Morphology and structure properties of SG–TiO2 composites Surface topography of GO sheets and SG sheets was well characterized by AFM, as presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 a shows the single layer and some overlap of GO sheets with the size around several micrometers. In addition, as seen in the inset of Fig. 1a, the thickness of GO sheet is about 0.93nm measured through two line scans, which is coordinated well with the reported thickness of single layer GO [31,37]. After sulfonation reaction, the size of GO sheets was significantly reduced. Fig. 1b shows that the size of SG sheets is around several hundred nanometers and the thickness is about 1.1nm which is a little larger than that of GO sheets. The increase of the thickness can be attributed to the introduction of sulfonic acid groups. In addition, the reduction in the size of the SG sheets is a key point in preparing SG–TiO2 composites. If the SG sheets are too large, they will fully wrap the TiO2 sphere, which reduces the penetration of light and the activity of TiO2. Fig. 2a and b are the FESEM images of unannealed TiO2 spheres. Fig. 2 a shows that the size of these hierarchical TiO2 spheres is uniform with the diameter of around 500nm. In addition, a closer observation indicates that these TiO2 spheres are actually assembled by thin two-dimensional (2D) sheets with the thickness of ca. 10nm, as seen in Fig. 2b. After heat treatment in air at 450°C for 2h, the morphology of TiO2 spheres has a remarkable change, as exhibited in Fig. 2c and d. The size of the annealed TiO2 spheres has no obvious shrinkage, while the void-free 2D sheets of unannealed sphere change to the porous structures which are in fact constructed by crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles. The formation of pores is because of the evaporation of the organic precursor. TEM images of unannealed and annealed TiO2 spheres (Fig. 2e, f and Fig. S1) further verified that the unannealed TiO2 spheres are constructed by ultra-thin 2D sheets, while annealed TiO2 spheres are composed of numerous nanoparticles. Fig. 2g is the HRTEM image taken from one nanoparticle of annealed TiO2 sphere. The distinctive lattice fringe of ca. 0.35nm can be assigned to the (101) crystal plane of the anatase TiO2, indicating that annealed TiO2 spheres are highly crystallized. The good crystalinity of the TiO2 spheres can enhance the charge transfer and photocatalytic activity [42,43]. Fig. 2h is the SAED pattern of the annealed TiO2 sphere and the diffuse ring pattern indicates that the TiO2 spheres are polycrystalline structure. The hierarchical SG–TiO2 composites were synthesized by ultrasonic mixing SG sheets with TiO2 spheres, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3a. Firstly, TiO2 spheres and SG sheets are well dispersed in water. Then, TiO2 spheres are combined with SG sheets to form SG–TiO2 composites under ultrasonication condition. Ultrasonication process can hinder the aggregation of SG sheets, which is a common problem for other synthetic methods, such as hydrothermal reaction. The single layer SG sheets can enhance the charge transfer rate between the TiO2 spheres and SG sheets, compared with the aggregated SG sheets. The morphology of the SG–TiO2 composites was well characterized by FESEM and TEM. Fig. 3 b shows that the TiO2 spheres were combined together by SG sheets and the sheets of TiO2 spheres become blurry due to the existence of SG sheets, as compared with the images of pure TiO2 spheres (Fig. 2c and d). TEM is a powerful technique to investigate the microstructure of graphene based composites. In Fig. 3c, one piece of SG sheets anchored on the edge of the TiO2 sphere can be clearly observed. The characterized wrinkles of SG sheets and the highly crystallized anatase TiO2 were indicated by white lines in the HRTEM image of Fig. 3d. According to the FESEM and TEM characterization, the hierarchical SG–TiO2 composites were successfully synthesized via ultrasonic mixing. The crystalline phases of GO, SG, TiO2 and SG–TiO2 composites were investigated by XRD. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized samples, including GO, SG, TiO2, SG–TiO2-0.5, SG–TiO2-1, SG–TiO2-2, SG–TiO2-3 and SG–TiO2-5. In comparison with GO, the peak of SG shifts from 12° to 10.6°. This can be owed to the introduction of sulfonic acid groups into the layers of GO sheets, which increases the interlayer distance [35]. As shown in Fig. 4 , TiO2 spheres and all SG–TiO2 composites show the remarkable diffraction peaks at 2θ of 25.3°, 38.2°, 48.1°, 53.5°, 55.6°, 62.7° and 75.0°, which can be indexed to the (101), (103), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (215) planes of the anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 21-1272). The as-synthesized samples were also characterized by FTIR. Fig. 5a shows the FTIR spectra of GO, SG, TiO2 and SG–TiO2-2 composites, respectively. In Fig. 5 a, the peaks of oxygen-containing functional groups of GO sheets are distinctly observed, including 1230cm−1 (phenolic groups), 1389cm−1 and 1726cm−1 (carboxylic groups) [44,45]. The broad band ranging from 3200cm−1 to 3600cm−1 is characterized H–O–H bending band of adsorbed water [46]. In addition, the broad band between 400cm−1 and 900cm−1 of TiO2 and SG–TiO2-2 can be assigned to the Ti–O band. Fig. 5b is the high magnification FTIR spectra of GO and SG. It can be clearly identified that the peak intensity of SG at 1230cm−1 is significantly reduced, while a small band at 1167cm−1 (sulfonic acid groups) appears [47], compared with the spectrum of GO. GO, SG and SG–TiO2-2 were further investigated by XPS spectra. Fig. 6a is the full-scan XPS spectra of GO, SG and SG–TiO2-2, respectively. Only Ti, C, O and S elements can be found in SG–TiO2-2 composites, indicating the high purity of as-synthesized SG–TiO2. Fig. 6 b shows the high resolution XPS spectra of S 2p from SG–TiO2-2 composites. The peak of S 2p at ca. 167eV confirms the successful combination of SG sheets with TiO2 spheres. Fig. 6c is the high resolution spectra of C 1s from GO, SG and SG–TiO2-2 from top to bottom. The intensity of C–O peak decreases remarkably from GO to SG because the C–O groups of GO have been partially converted into C–SO3H groups in the sulfonation reaction. The high resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p and O 2p from the SG–TiO2-2 composites are shown in Fig. S2. Hence, the results of FTIR and XPS spectra demonstrate the successful preparation of SG sheets and SG–TiO2 composites."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under neutral pH,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under neutral pH Fig. 7a and b shows the hydrogen production activities of a series of samples under UV light irradiation (254nm). In Fig. 7 a, it can be observed that pure TiO2 spheres and commercial P25 nanoparticles exhibit limited hydrogen evolution capacity. Only around 41μmol and 48μmol of H2 were produced by TiO2 spheres and P25 within 2h, respectively, because of rapid recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. However, a great enhancement of hydrogen production activity can be achieved when the TiO2 spheres are combined with SG sheets. About 193μmol of H2 was produced during 120min when only 0.5wt% of SG sheets were ultrasonic mixed with the TiO2 spheres. The initial increase of SG sheets results in the increasing of hydrogen evolution activity, as shown in Fig. 7a. The optimal hydrogen production activity was obtained when 2wt% of SG sheets were added, and ca. 530μmol of H2 was generated within 120min, which is more than 11 times higher than that of pure TiO2 spheres and P25. The hydrogen production activity was decreased when further increasing the amount of SG sheets. Only 137μmol of H2 was generated by SG–TiO2-5, as displayed in Fig. 7a. This can be explained by the shielding effects of SG sheets because too much SG sheets will block the penetration of UV light and prevent the reaction between photo-generated holes and the sacrificial agents [48]. The hydrogen production activity was further investigated by comparing the effects of different synthetic methods including mechanical grinding and ultrasonic mixing. In addition, the influences of pristine GO sheets and functionalized SG sheets were also examined. Fig. 7b shows that more than 1000μmol of H2 is generated by the SG–TiO2-2 composites (synthesized by ultrasonication), while only 210μmol of H2 is produced by the SG–TiO2-2 composites (synthesized by mechanical mixing) within 4h. The significant higher hydrogen evolution rate of ultrasonication prepared SG–TiO2 composites than mechanical synthesized composites can be attributed to the better interfacial contact between SG sheets and TiO2 spheres. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the SG sheets can uniformly grafted on the TiO2 spheres under ultrasonic mix, resulting in the enhanced interfacial adhesion, which can improve the efficiency of charge transfer [49]. GO–TiO2 (2wt% GO) shows comparable hydrogen evolution rate (245μmol/h) with that of SG–TiO2-2 (260μmol/h), as presented in Fig. 7b. Table S1 shows that the hydrogen evolution rate of SG–TiO2-2 is 260μmol/h, which is higher than that of SG-P25 (200μmol/h), SG–ZnO (156μmol/h), and slightly lower than that of visible-light responsed SG-CdS (285μmol/h). The apparent quantum efficiency of the photocatalyst can be calculated according to the reported equation [18]: QE [ % ] = number of reached electrons number of incidemt photons × 100 = number of evolved H2 molecules × 2 number of incidemt photons × 100 Hence, the quantum efficiencies of SG–TiO2-2, SG-P25, SG–ZnO and SG-CdS are 2.30%, 1.77%, 1.38% and 2.52%, respectively."
11,Mechanism,"3.3 Mechanism Fig. 8 illustrates the reasons of the high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of SG–TiO2-2. Fig. 8 a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of pure TiO2 spheres and SG–TiO2-2 composites, respectively. The BET surface area of SG–TiO2-2 is 91.25m2/g, which is larger than that of TiO2 spheres (75.36m2/g). In addition, the pore size distribution of TiO2 ranges from 1nm to 100nm with two major peaks at around 3nm and 30nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8a. The pore size distribution of SG–TiO2-2 is similar with that of TiO2 except that the second peak shifts from 30nm to 20nm due to the deposition of SG sheets. The large surface area with mesoporous structure is beneficial for photocatalytic activity [43]. Fig. 8b shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of pure TiO2 spheres and SG–TiO2-2, respectively. In comparison with the spectrum of TiO2, SG–TiO2-2 composites acquire stronger absorption in the whole wavelength range (300nm to 800nm). The enhanced absorption of light is crucial to achieve excellent hydrogen production activity [18]. The UV–vis absorption spectra was further converted into the equivalent absorption coefficient (Eq. (1)) by the Kubelka–Munk function [50]. (1) α = 1 − R 2 R αis optical absorption coefficient near the absorption edge for indirect interband transitions; R is the reflectance of the semiconductor, R =10−A, A is optical absorbance. (2) α h v = C 1 h v − E g 2 (3) h v = 1240 λ C 1 is absorption constant for an indirect transition; h v is photon energy; E g is indirect band gap energy (eV); λ is wavelength (nm). The straight line tangential to the vertical segment of the slope is extended to intersect the photon energy axis (X-axis) in obtaining E g value of the samples, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8b. Hence, the band gaps of TiO2 spheres and SG–TiO2-2 composite are 3.16eV and 3.02eV, respectively. The band gap of SG–TiO2-2 composite has a slightly red shift due to the presence of SG sheets. PL spectra of pure TiO2 spheres and SG–TiO2-2 were measured to investigate the charge separation process, as presented in Fig. 8c. Fig. 8c shows that the PL intensity of SG–TiO2-2 is significantly lower than that of TiO2, indicating that the charge recombination rate of SG–TiO2-2 is much slower than that of TiO2. This is because the photo-generated electrons can transfer from TiO2 to SG sheets quickly. The mechanism of hydrogen production activity of SG–TiO2 composites is schematically illustrated in Fig. 9. The electrons and holes of TiO2 are generated firstly under light irradiation. Subsequently, the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 can transfer to the SG sheets through the closely contacted interface. Finally, the photo-generated electrons react with protons to generate hydrogen, while the holes remaining in the valance band of TiO2 oxidize the sacrificial methanol. Hence, the outstanding hydrogen generation activity of SG–TiO2-2 can be attributed to (1) large specific surface area of mesoporous structure; (2) enhanced light scattering and absorption; and (3) anti-recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under acid and basic conditions,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under acid and basic conditions Considering the practical applicability of SG–TiO2 composites in the engineering fields, the hydrogen production activity of SG–TiO2 composites was investigated under different pH conditions. As shown in Fig. 10a, 653μmol of H2 was generated by SG–TiO2-2 within 2h under pH=3 (acidic condition). In addition, the inset of Fig. 10a shows that the calculated hydrogen evolution rate of SG–TiO2-2 is 326.5μmol/h, which is higher than that of SG–TiO2-2 (ca. 260μmol/h) under pH=7. The similar trends are also observed for the SG-P25 and GO–TiO2. The increase of the hydrogen generation rate under acidic condition (pH=3) can be attributed to more H+ ions existed in the solution. H+ ions have more chance to be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and the reduction rate of H+ to hydrogen by the photo-generated electrons will be increased [51]. Interestingly, a different phenomenon was observed when the photocatalysts worked under pH=11 (basic condition). Fig. 10b shows that SG–TiO2-2 and SG-P25 produce 404μmol and 302μmol of H2 during 2h, respectively. The average hydrogen evolution rates of SG–TiO2-2 and SG-P25 are 202μmol/h and 151μmol/h under pH=11, respectively, which are lower than that under pH=7. This is because less H+ ions can be reduced in the alkaline solution. Particularly, a distinctive curve of GO–TiO2 was obtained under pH=11, as seen in Fig. 10b. The hydrogen evolution rate of GO–TiO2 is significantly reduced under pH=11, and only 41μmol of H2 can be generated per hour, while GO–TiO2 shows a greatly higher hydrogen evolution rate (ca. 245μmol/h) under neutral pH. As shown in Fig. 7b, GO–TiO2 exhibits better hydrogen production activity than SG-P25 under pH=7. However, GO–TiO2 shows the lowest hydrogen evolution rate (41μmol/h) among three tested samples, even much lower than that of SG-P25, as seen in Fig. 9 b. According to our knowledge, no one reported such discovery, so the reason behind this specific behavior was investigated in our experiments. The morphology of SG–TiO2-2 and GO–TiO2 after hydrogen production under pH=11 was characterized by TEM, as shown in Fig. 11 and S3. Fig. 11 a shows the low magnification TEM image of SG–TiO2-2. It can be clearly observed that SG sheets are connected with TiO2 spheres after hydrogen production under pH=11. HRTEM image (Fig. 11b) of SG–TiO2-2 exhibits the characterized wrinkles of SG sheets and the clear lattice fringe of TiO2 spheres. Fig. S3 are the TEM images of GO–TiO2 after hydrogen generation under pH=11. Several dispersed TiO2 spheres can be seen in Fig. S3a. In addition, we cannot find the existence of GO sheets in Fig. S3a. Furthermore, one independent GO sheet can be observed in Fig. S3b, indicating that GO sheets cannot be grafted on the TiO2 spheres under alkaline condition. The detaching of GO sheets from GO–TiO2 composites is the main reason of the decrease of hydrogen evolution rate because the charge separation efficiency can be significantly reduced. In addition, the detached GO sheets can block the penetration and absorption of light, which further destroy the hydrogen production activity. The results indicate that the coordination bonds between the TiO2 and the sulfonic group of SG sheets can tolerate a wide pH range, while the bonds between the TiO2 and the carboxylic group of GO sheets can be damaged under basic condition. Hence, the SG–TiO2 composites are suitable for the practical clean energy production."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, SG–TiO2 composites were successfully synthesized and well characterized by FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, BET, UV–vis and PL. SG–TiO2 composites with the optimal amount of SG sheets (2%) achieve a hydrogen evolution rate of 260μmol/h, which is higher than standard P25 nanoparticles, pure TiO2 spheres and GO–TiO2 composites. The excellent hydrogen production activity of SG–TiO2 composites can be attributed to large specific surface area, enhanced light absorption and efficient charge separation. More importantly, SG–TiO2 composites show high hydrogen production efficiency within a wide pH range (from pH=3 to pH=11), compared with GO–TiO2 composites which loss photocatalytic activity dramatically under alkaline condition. This special property of SG–TiO2 composites can be owed to the strong interaction between SG sheets and TiO2 spheres. Hence, this study highlights that SG–TiO2 composite can be a stable and efficient photocatalyst for clean energy production under various pH conditions."
