0,Introduction,"Polymer nanocomposites are increasingly being researched and developed in recent decades. They are included in more applications in the modern technology and industry. This is due to their lower density, good flexibility, low cost, easy processing, light weight, good electrical properties, broad band and fast industrial processing (El-Gamal & El Sayed, 2019). The performance of nanocomposites depends on the properties of reinforcing nanoparticles such as size, aspect ratio, specific surface area, volume fraction used, compatibility with matrix, and their distribution and dispersion. Although long time has passed since the development of nanocomposites, but the proper distribution and dispersion of nanoparticles remain the main challenge to achieve more suitable and desirable properties (such as flame retardant, mechanical properties, barrier properties, thermal properties, etc.) than conventional composites even with less filler loading. Actually, high surface area leads to a change in the macromolecular state around the nanoparticles (e.g., combined concentration gradient, crystallization, altered mobility, etc.), which modifies the overall behavior of material (Bugnicourt, 2005). Polymer nanocomposites can be prepared by conventional wet and dry processes under adjusted conditions. Various methods, including intercalation of the polymers, in-situ polymerization, in situ melt blending, the direct combining of polymers and particulates, die synthesis and sol-gel process, have been used to synthesize polymer nanocomposites (Müller et al., 2017). Inorganic nanoparticles can improve optics, mechanic, density, electronic properties and thermal stability of polymer matrix, and this could make the way for more applications. Metal oxide nanoparticles show unique properties include high chemical stability, high thermal stability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility and high specific surface activity and therefore have many applications. For example, magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs) show applications in various fields such as electronics, optics, ceramics and act as excellent catalysts and adsorbents (Bdewi, Abdullah, Aziz, & Mutar, 2016; Camtakan, Erenturk, & Yusan, 2012). These NPs have received much attention due to their antibacterial properties and pollution removal. These NPs show good antibacterial activity due to their ability to produce reactive oxygen species and disrupt cell membranes. MgO NPs are synthesized by various methods that among them, sol-gel method, co-precipitation, and laser ablation are more common than other synthesis routs (Gharpure, Akash, & Ankamwar, 2020). Polymers are dominant and prevalent materials resulting from their simple process ability and low cost. However, polymers incorporated with nanoparticles have significant interest in recent decades because, combining the attractive functionalities of inorganic nanoparticles, and organic polymers have been expected to show synergistically improved properties (Bdewi et al., 2016). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a semi-crystalline hydrophilic polymer, has been widely used for synthesis of polymer nanocomposites due to its excellent characteristics such as water solubility, high transparency, and very high flexibility. Also, it is an environmentally green polymer because of its biodegradability and non-toxicity (Khanna et al., 2005; Rao et al., 2015). Also, PVA has carbon chain backbone with OH groups attached to carbons which can be a source of hydrogen bonding, Therefore, a lot of potential lies in exploring the characteristics of nanocomposites synthesized with PVA as a good host matrix. Also, by doping of filler into PVA matrix, this broad range of applications can be more extended (Bdewi et al., 2016). However, these properties are strongly susceptible on thermal and humidity which decreases the stability and durability of PVA polymer. Adding of nanofiller to polymer matrix has been proved to increase the mechanical properties, thermal stability and decrease the gas permeability and humidity. The literature survey inhibits that MgO nanoparticles is applied to enhance the thermal stability of polymer (Gandhi et al., 2011). Natural gums extracted from plants have many practical applications such as food additives and medicinal substances and stabilizing, dispersing, gelling, emulsifying, thickening, crosslinking, and coating agents. Natural biopolymers based on plant gums have already been used to prepare nanomaterials; for example, Arabic gum (AG) has been evaluated as a non-toxic phytochemical structure for the production of biocompatible gold nanoparticles that have diagnostic and therapeutic applications (Vellora Thekkae Padil, Nguyen, Ševců, & Černík, 2015). According to the previous research, the degree of swelling of PVA and AG hydrogels and the penetration of silver nanoparticles in a composite hydrogel depends on AG concentration. It has been reported that the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of AG and PVA interact with silver nanoparticles (Juby et al., 2012). It was also observed that the morphology of nanocomposites composed of PVA, AG and polycaprolactone improved by increasing PVA. Because PVA has many hydroxyl groups in the main chain structure, which can form hydrogen bonds and interact with AG to eliminate its intramolecular interactions and produce a smooth surface (Eghbalifam, Shojaosadati, Hashemi-Najafabadi, & Khorasani, 2020; Padil, Senan, Wacſawek, & Ŀerník, 2016). Also, it has been shown that PVA can be used as a modifier in improving the physical and mechanical properties of brittle AG polymer (Ibrahim, Ibrahim, & Farag, 2007). But thermal stability of PVA-AG biopolymer matrix is low and must improve with use of a nanofiller in the form of nanocomposite. Despite the small added ratio of the nanofiller, it could dramatically increase the optical absorption, thermal stability, electrical and structural properties of the polymer blends. In this present work, we synthesized novel PVA/AG/MgO bio-nanocomposite for the first time. The use of PVA-AG new biopolymer matrix and detailed discussion of the interactions between this matrix with MgO NPs and the influence of these components and their interactions on structural, thermal stability, optical absorption, crystalline properties of nanocomposite certainly represents the originality of this work compared with the previous literatures. In this study, we used MgO nanofiller to increase the thermal stability of polymer matrix. Influence of AG carbohydrate polymer on elimination of PVA intramolecular interactions, decreasing of the degree of PVA swelling and producing a smooth surface (nanocomposite sheets) was investigated by FESEM. Also, in this work, an easy synthetic route for MgO nanoparticles embedded in biopolymer matrix is described. The direct mixing approach, more comfortable and economic rout, has the advantage of milder conditions, easier work-up lower cost and more suitability without any special equipment such as high pressure and high temperature. The prepared nanocomposites can be used for many applications such as antibacterial agents and drug delivery."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO₃)2. 6H₂O),sodium hydroxide (NaOH), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purchased from merck. Arabic gum (AG) was provided by Norevo."
3,Synthesis of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs),"2.2 Synthesis of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs) The co-precipitation method was used to prepare MgO NPs. Initially, 0.18 M magnesium nitrate solution (0.4 g of Mg(NO₃)2. 6H₂O was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water) and 2 M sodium hydroxide solution (1/2 g of NaOH was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water) were prepared. The prepared solutions were stirred for 60 min by a magnetic stirrer at ambient temperature. Then, sodium hydroxide solution was added to the magnesium nitrate solution dropwise at ambient temperature. The resulting solution was then stirred for 60 min at 32 °C with a magnetic stirrer to form a white precipitate of magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2. The final precipitate formed was separated by filter paper and washed three times with distilled water to remove any impurities. Then, it was dried at 120 °C for 24 h in oven and the dried magnesium hydroxide precipitate was milled for 15 min by stainless steel balls with a diameter of 16 mm. Finally, dried magnesium hydroxide precipitate was calcined of environment temperature until 450 °C with a heating rate of 5° °C/min for 2 h to obtain white powder of magnesium oxide nanoparticles."
4,Preparation of nanocomposite,"2.3 Preparation of nanocomposite For the synthesis of polyvinyl alcohol/Arabic gum/magnesium oxide (PVA/AG/MgO) nanocomposite, at first, 0.22 g PVA, 0.22 g AG powder and 0.44 g MgO NPs powder were dissolved in 110 mL distilled water individually and were stirred separately with a magnetic stirrer for 60 min at ambient temperature. The three solutions were then dispersed by ultrasonic homogenizer for 15 min at 42 °C. In the next step, the PVA polymer solution was added dropwise to the AG solution to form a polymer blend solution. The MgO NPs solution was added dropwise to the polymer blend solution, and the solution was stirred for 60 min. After this time, the solution was dispersed by ultrasonic homogenizer for 15 min at 42 °C. Finally, the prepared nanocomposites were separated by centrifugation and were washed with distilled water for three times to remove the unreacted and residual species and then were put in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h for drying. The resulting dry sediment was separated from the container with a spatula and was milled to form powder. The flowchart of the nanocomposite synthesis method is presented in Fig. 1 ."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The properties of the synthesized nanocomposite and its components were evaluated using different techniques. Structural analysis or chemical properties of PVA and AG polymers, synthesized MgO NPs and final nanocomposites were investigated using Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) spectroscopy in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1 using 32 scans/sample Sample preparation for this test was performed using KBr petelets and were subjected to FTIR spectrometer (AVOAR model AVATAR made by Thermo company). Crystal size, structure and phase detection were performed by X-ray diffraction test (pw1730 model made by the PHILIPS company). For this purpose, the wavelength of the X-ray copper cathode lamp is 1.54056 Å, its voltage is 40 kV, and current is 30 mA. This wavelength was irradiated to the samples at different 2θ angles in the range between 20–80 degrees. By measuring the amount of X-ray scattering emitted for each sample, different 2θ angles at specific intensities are determined. By measuring the amount of X-ray scattering emitted for each sample, different angles 2θ at certain intensities are determined. Finally, the X-ray diffraction intensity curve is drawn in terms of angle 2θ at certain angles of the peaks corresponding to the distances between the crystal plates. From this method, the order of the crystal structure of the samples can be determined, and then the size of the formed crystal can be determined using the Debye Scherrer relation (Eq. 1). In this regard, D is the crystal size, K is the crystal shape constant (0.9) close to number one, λ is the size of the X-ray cathode lamp wavelength used, B is the peak width at half the maximum height in terms of radians and θ is diffraction angle of scattered X-ray by degree. (1) B=kλ/Lcos(θ) The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyze of nanocomposite was performed using a lab based SAXS setup and the beam diameter of the incident photon was 0.4 mm. The scattering wave vector (q) was equal to 4 π λ sin θ, where 2θ is the scattering angle in the range of 1−10° and λ = 1.54056 Å. usually, the scattering intensity I(q) can be expressed as: (2) I q = I 0 exp - R g 2 q 2 3 where I (0) is the scattering intensity as q is zero, and Rg is the gyration radius of the scatterers. Eq. (2) can be modified into the logarithmic shape as: (3) ln I q = - R g 2 q 2 3 + ln I 0 It can be result that ln(I(q)) and q2 have the linear relationship. The Rg can be determined from the slope of the line segments when q tends to zero (Wang, Wu, & Yin, 2017). Behavior of MgO NPs and synthesized nanocomposites against heat were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TA model Q600). In this test, 2.479 mg of the synthesized nanocomposite and 0.6999 mg of MgO NPs were placed under the atmosphere of argon at increasing rate of temperature of 5 °C/min in the temperature range of 25–700 °C. The frequency distribution of the elements in the composition of the synthesized nanocomposite was investigated using the X-ray surface elemental mapping test (X-Ray Map). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles and nanocomposites were studied by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, TESCAN MIRA3) with a working voltage of 30 kV. Before performing of SEM analysis, the surface of samples was coated with gold thin film. Also, particle size distribution histogram of the synthesized nanocomposite was prepared. Identification of constituent elements and their amounts for synthesized nanocomposites was performed by X-ray energy diffraction (EDS) spectroscopy (Broker model). This analysis was performed by a SAMX X-ray energy detector on FESEM. Structure and morphology of synthesized PVA/AG/MgO nanocomposites using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips CM120) at 120 kV were examined at different magnifications. UV–vis spectra of PVA, AG, MgO NPs, and synthesized nanocomposite were recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo model) in the range of 190−790 nm. Three replicate analysis were conducted for UV–vis and the result was reported as the average of three sets of values. Finally, the absorption spectra obtained from these components were studied and investigated."
6,Results and discussion,
7,FTIR analysis,"3.1 FTIR analysis The FTIR spectra of the nanocomposite and its components are shown in Fig. 2 . PVA is highly crystalline, while AG is naturally relatively crystalline. The PVA spectrum (Fig. 2a) indicates a broad absorption peak at 3200−3600 cm−1 and sharp peak at 1664 cm−1 related to stretching and bending vibrations of OH groups, respectively. Characteristic peaks observed at 2921, 1425, 1288 and 1073 cm−1 are attributed to stretching (CH), scissoring (CH2), stretching (COH) and stretching (CO), respectively (Kalantari, Mostafavi, Saleh, Soltantabar, & Webster, 2020; Sadeghi, Ghasemi, Kazemi, & Soleimani, 2012). Fig. 2b shows a broad absorption band at 3000−3500 cm−1 (peak at 3420 cm−1) showing the presence of OH groups in arabic gum. The presence of many hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and the possible hydrogen bonding between them has led to the widening of the peaks at 3400 cm−1. The band at 2922 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of CH. The vibration band at 1074 cm−1 assigned to starching vibration of COH in polysaccharide molecule. The bands observed at 1424 cm−1 corresponds to OH group bending of acid group and of band at 750 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of the pyranose rings in the polysaccharide. The spectrum of arabic gum shows a characteristic peak in the 1612 cm−1 due to the presence of CO stretching vibration of carboxylate groups and NH bending vibration. Arabic gum is composed of a small amount of high molecular weight protein and many low molecular weight polysaccharides. It seems that the absorption bands of glycoprotein groups be overlapped with polysaccharide bands (Abu-Dalo, Othman, & Al-Rawashdeh, 2012; Rao et al., 2010; Venkatesham, Ayodhya, Madhusudhan, & Veerabhadram, 2012). In the FTIR spectrum of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (Fig. 2c), the peak at 424 cm−1 is assigned to the bending vibration of MgO. The absorption peak observed at 868 cm−1 indicating formation of cubic magnesium oxide (Imani & Safaei, 2019). The broad band at 3427 cm−1 is also attributed to the stretching vibration of OH (physisorbed water) (Kandiban, Vigneshwaran, & Vetha Potheher, 2015). The sharp peak at 3716 cm−1 is due to the chemisorbed OH ions in magnesium hydroxide (Karthikeyan, Dhanapandian, & Manoharan, 2016). Additionally, the slight absorption band observed around 2922 cm−1 would correspond to in-phase and out-of-phase surface OH stretching (Somanathan, Krishna, Saravanan, Kumar, & Kumar, 2016). The absorption peaks at 1621 and 1428 cm−1 are attributed to bending and stretching vibration of water (Kumar, Sharma, & Kishore, 2013). The final nanocomposite spectrum (Fig. 2d) have the distinctive peaks of arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol, and magnesium oxide nanoparticles which confirms the optimal formation of the final nanocomposite. In the synthesized nanocomposite, the absorption peak of pure Mg-O (424 cm−1) shifted to higher wavelength (437 cm−1), indicating the interaction of OH and COOH groups of polymers with the MgO nanoparticles. In other words, this is due to formation of hydrogen bonding between the OH and COOH groups with MgO NPs that these groups get associated with surface of the MgO NPs (Juby et al., 2012). The intensity of characteristic bands of the blend biopolymer depends on the blend compositions. The bands seen in the spectrum of the nanocomposite proved the miscibility between PVA and AG in which OH band at 1664 cm-1 in pure PVA and COOH band at 1612 cm-1 in pure AG overlapped and shifted to 1670 cm-1 in nanocomposite indicating the presence of certain intermolecular interactions. The characteristic band at 2922 cm-1 in nanocomposite is related to CH2 stretching vibration indicating presence of polymer matrix. As AG mixed with PVA and MgO NPs, more hydroxyl groups are involved in hydrogen bonding, which led to further peak broadening and a slight change in the vibration frequency of CO polyvinyl alcohol from 1288 to 1302 cm−1, as was the case for AG from 1074 to 1100 cm−1. Also, this band may be overlapped with the vibration stretching of the OH- band for pure GA. Furthermore, the characteristic band at 1423 cm-1 (COOH stretching) in pure AG shifted to 1435 cm-1 due to interaction arabic gum with OH group of PVA and MgO nanoparticles (Juby et al., 2012; Nizam El-Din, Khafaga, & El-Naggar, 2015)."
8,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis Phase formation and crystallography of the PVA, AG and synthesized nanocomposite were investigated using XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 3 . XRD pattern of pure PVA (Fig. 3a) showed two definite peak for centralized orthorhombic lattice at angles 2θ = 12° and 21.45° which indicates the semi-crystalline nature of PVA. PVA is characterized by intense internal bonds and interchain hydrogen bonds. The results also showed the existence of a semi-crystalline phase for AG (Fig. 3b) (Liu et al., 2009). The XRD pattern of MgO NPs (Fig. 3c) was similar to the standard data (JCPDS JCPDS No.01-089-7746) related to the co-precipitation method (Kandiban et al., 2015). Miller indices (hkl)= (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222), at 2θ = 37.16, 42.96, 62.21, 74.74 and 78.66° were identified respectively (Kushwaha & Bagchi, 2018). The XRD pattern of MgO NPs showed the MgO cubic phase. The mean crystal size of MgO NPs was calculated to be 4 nm using the Scherer equation at maximum intensive peak (200). The presence of sharp peaks with broad width in the XRD spectrum of MgO samples confirms the formation of NPs. Also, the absence of additional peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the NPs indicates their high purity (Imani & Safaei, 2019). The XRD pattern of synthesized nanocomposite (Fig. 3d) showed a peak at 2θ = 20° demonstrating the crystallinity of PVA. The increase in the amorphous nature of compound indicates the interaction between AG and PVA chains during the formation of the nanocomposite. As compared with pure NPs, dispersion of NPs within the polymer matrix causes elimination of the peaks (the peaks at 2θ = 37.16, 74.7 and 78.66 related to planes (111), (311) and (222) were eliminated) or broadening of the peaks (the peaks at 2θ = 42.96 related to (200) plane was broad and d-space changed from 1388 to 696 Å), decreasing in intensity and shift of peaks to the left (the peaks at 2θ = 42.96 and 62.21 related to (200) and (220) were shifted to smaller angles) in the XRD of nanocomposite. These are due to formation of PVA and AG polymer networks, the interactions between PVA and MgO NPs, attachment of PVA or AG onto the surface of MgO NPs and the preferential orientation of the grains of MgO NPs in the nanocomposite structure, thereby leading to a decrease in crystallinity (Parwani, Bhatnagar, Bhatnagar, & Sharma, 2019; Rao et al., 2015)."
9,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal weighing and stability of nanocomposite and their component was determined by thermogravimetric analysis as shown in Fig. 4 . The analysis was performed in the presence of argon gas with a heating rate of 5 °C/min, in the temperature range from 25–700 °C. The weight loss observed for AG, PVA, nanocomposite and MgO NPs, up to 700 °C is 94.7, 96.5, 54.88 and 23.39 % respectively. The thermogram of nanocomposite showed a four step degradation process. The first stage of mass loss is related to remove of hydrogen-bounded water to the polysaccharide structures or adsorbed water starts at about 100 °C up to 250 °C. The backbone decomposition of PVA and AG is related to the second mass loss occurred between 250 and 300 °C. it has been shown that the PVA alone starts decomposing at about 280 ◦C (Khanna et al., 2005). The major weight loss (the third step) in the temperature range of 310–450 °C is due to decomposition of Mg (OH)2 and crystallization of magnesium oxide. The 29 % weight loss observed from 310 to 450 °C, which is in a good agreement with the theoretical value from Mg(OH)2 to MgO transformation (30.7 wt.%)(Karthikeyan et al., 2016). The last stage, which occurs at temperatures above 500 °C, is due to thermal degradation of the mineral byproducts (Guguldiken & Gercel, 2018). The increase in thermal stability of the nonocomposite compared to polymer components can be due to two reasons. MgO NPs have higher thermal stability as compared to the polymeric chains of the polymer matrix. therefore, the presence of MgO NPs in the system may make it more stable thermally. The other reason for this change could be the decreased movement of the polymeric chains on loading of MgO NPs, leading to the enhanced thermal stability. The MgO NPs interact with AG and PVA through the OH and COOH groups available in the polymeric chains. These interactions can cause to creation of some weak intermolecular cross-links between the polymeric chains, as a result restricting their movement. Finally, the decomposition process will be indicated down, and the degradation takes place at higher temperature in the presence of MgO NPs (Juby et al., 2012; Yu, Lin, Yeh, & Lin, 2003)."
10,X-ray map analysis,"3.4 X-ray map analysis The dispersion map of the elements on the surface of the synthesized nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 5 , indicates that how the elements such as calcium, carbon, magnesium and oxygen are dispersed. This results showed the proper dispersion of the constituents, especially optimal distribution of Mg in the final structure of the nanocomposite confirming the synthesis of the optimal nanocomposite."
11,SEM analysis,"3.5 SEM analysis The FESEM analysis of MgO NPs and nanocomposite are shown in the Fig. 6 . Fig. 6a and b, show morphology of NPs and nanocomposite at 200 nm magnification, respectively. According to Fig. 6a, it can be concluded that the approximate size of the NPs is between 25−40 nm and nearly most of NPs are spherical and highly agglomerated. This is due to small size of the NPs and the intensive increase in their specific surface area, resulting in unwanted cold sintering of the NPs. The FESEM image of nanocomposite (Fig. 6b) shows that the NPs are entirely coated with a mixture of PVA and AG polymers and NPs are deposited on the polymer matrix wall. The wall width of nanocomposite sheets containing nanoparticles is between 30−40 nm. Fig. 6c shows the size distribution histogram of synthesized nanoparticles that it indicates the size of NPs is between 25−40 nm. The identification of the constituent elements in the synthesized nanocomposite by EDS (Fig. 6d) showed that all the elements of raw materials are present in the nanocomposite containing carbon (C) with a weight percentage of 24.34, oxygen (O) with a weight percentage of 53.29, magnesium (Mg) with a weight percentage of 22.18 % and calcium (Ca) with a weight percentage of 0.19 % confirming the formation of the nanocomposite."
12,TEM analysis,"3.6 TEM analysis The TEM images of the PVA/AG/MgO nanocomposite in two magnifications, polymer matrix and size distribution histogram of nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7a, MgO NPs are dark spots that are less clearly visible in the image and tightly distributed in polymer matrix. Due to large volume, high surface area and entrapment of NPs inside the polymer wall, they are densely packed and agglomerated inside the polymer matrix and created a dark mass with light matrix. This uniform dark spots observed in the Fig. 7a indicates the optimal dispersion of MgO NPs in whole polymer matrix (Camargo, Satyanarayana, & Wypych, 2009). Fig. 7b show a polymer matrix chain that MgO NPs deposit on and around its surface. Fig. 7c show TEM image of polymer matrix that clearly indicate that the light background is related to the polymer matrix. Fig. 7d shows the size distribution histogram of nanocomposites in range between 20−90 nm corresponding to the TEM images. These results are different with size distribution of pure NPs in Fig. 6c that is due to intensive agglomeration of NPs in polymer matrix (Safaei et al., 2019)."
13,UV–vis analysis,"3.7 UV–vis analysis The absorption spectra of the nanocomposite and its components were investigated using UV–vis spectrophotometry in the range of 190−790 nm. The specific wavelength at which a molecule absorbs radiation depends on the strength of the electrons involved in its bonding. As shown in Fig. 8 , PVA, AG, MgO NPs, and synthesized nanocomposite have absorption peaks at maximum wavelength (λmax) 206, 195, 207, and 204 nm, respectively. In order to make the peaks clearer, an inset graph with focus on the 190−250 nm are shown in Fig. 8. The MgO NPs have broad absorption peak with low intensity at 207 nm indicates the formation of NPs with different sizes. The obtained results of UV–vis spectrum of MgO NPs matched with the FESEM analysis of these NPs. These data confirm the specific and quantum properties of NPs (Haghshenas, Amini, Bhatti, & Rahimi, 2016). In comparison to pure components, the absorption spectrum of nanocomposite showed increased intensity and maximum absorption wavelength shifted to 204 nm, indicating the synthesis of nanocomposites."
14,SAXS analysis,"3.8 SAXS analysis The SAXS curves of the nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 9 . It was observed that the scattering intensity decrease rapidly when the vector of scattering increases, and eventually tend to be stable state (Fig. 9a). The gyration radiuses of the scatters (i.e., Rg) and the thickness of the interphases between the Magnesium oxide NPs and polymer matrix (i.e., E) can be calculated of Porod curves (Figs. 9b and 9c) of the nanocomposite that are 30 and 6 nm, respectively. The relation between ln(I(q)) and q2 (Fig. 9b) isn’t linear and the obtained Rg is the average of gyration radiuses (Singh, 2013). Actually, The SAXS curves indicate a wide relative size distribution due to the polydipersity of nanoparticles and confirm those observed in the SEM and TEM images. Also, the high gyration radius indicates the aggregation of nanoparticles at nanocomposite. The NPs have high surface area and size small, as they are incorporated into the polymer matrix, the agglomeration happens easily. It should be noted that the Rg of the MgO NPs measured by SAXS porod curve are not exactly the same as those observed in the SEM and TEM images. The reason is that the SEM and TEM analysis just show a very small section of the nanocomposite, and can only explains the local dispersion of the NPs. while, the SAXS analysis shows the statistical result, and it shows the complete dispersion of the NPs. Also, due to high surface-active of the MgO nanoparticles, the polymer matrix molecules are simply attracted by them, making the NPs coated and anchored by the matrix chains and, simultaneous, the arrangement of the polymer chains around the MgO NPs may become more regular (Wang et al., 2017)."
15,Conclusions,"In this research, novel PVA/AG/MgO bio-nanocomposite was synthesized using the direct blending process. The obtained results of the present study are as follows: 1) The synthesized MgO NP are spherical in shape and have size distribution between 25−40 nm. 2) The MgO NPs are deposited and well distributed inside polymer matrix. 3) X-ray mapping analysis shows proper dispersion and distribution of components elements inside nanocomposite. 4) TGA analysis shows that adding of MgO NPs leads to increasing the thermal stability of polymer matrix at higher temperature. 5) The SAXS curves showed polydispersity of MgO nanoparticles and high aggregation of them in polymer matrix that confirmed SEM and TEM results."
