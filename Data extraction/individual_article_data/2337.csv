0,Introduction,"Renewable energy resources have attracted increasing attention because of the consumption of fossil fuels (Lin et al., 2008). From the perspective of economic development and ecological environment protection, hydrogen has been considered one of the most advantageous alternative source of energy because of its clean combustion product, namely, water (Nitsch et al., 1992). Microbial fermentation is a potentially important method for renewable hydrogen production that uses biomass as substrate. Firstly, the method is carbon neutral and requires less energy consumption as compared with other conventional hydrogen-producing methods, such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, gasification and water electrolysis (Jones, 2008; Angenent et al., 2004; Kothari et al., 2008; Holladay et al., 2009). Secondly, dark fermentation with biomass or carbohydrate-based substrates presents a more promising and feasible route for biological hydrogen production, thereby offering higher production efficiency, higher stability, simpler control requirements, lower operating costs and higher feasibility for industrialisation (Jayasinghearachchi et al., 2009). As a facultative anaerobe, Enterobacter aerogenes has high growth and hydrogen production rates, which have been widely studied in dark fermentation (Zhang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, for commercialisation in biological fermentative hydrogen production, its hydrogen yield needs to be further improved. The theoretical hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes is 4mol/molglucose (Zhang et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011). However, the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes is approximately 1mol/mol of glucose at pH of 6.0, which is considerably lower than the theoretical value (Tanisho, 1999; Yokoi et al., 1995; Tanisho et al., 1989; Converti and Perego, 2002; Zhang et al., 2011). Therefore, extensive research on E. aerogenes has been conducted to improve the hydrogen yield; thus far, a yield of 1.58molH2/mol glucose has been experimentally reached mainly by optimising the cultivation conditions (Tanisho et al., 1998). Several approaches, such as genetic engineering and metabolic engineering technologies for most promising micro-organisms, were recently conducted to enhance microbial hydrogen productivity (Rachman et al., 1997; Lu et al., 2008, 2011). However, the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes remains markedly lower than the theoretical hydrogen yield of 4mol/molglucose. Complex gene analysis of various bacteria and the specific methods for different bacteria present considerable limitations for further research. Microbial mutation breeding could obtain stable genetic mutant strains with improved target properties; this approach has been widely used in industrial fermentation (Shi and Wu, 2013). The application of mutation techniques to improve the productivity of hydrogen-producing bacteria is a promising research direction. The E. aerogenes AY-2 mutant was obtained by allyl alcohol and proton suicide methods; its hydrogen yield of 1.17molH2/mol glucose was higher by 109% than that of the wild strain HU-101 (Rachman et al., 1997). Lu et al. (2008) used He–Ne laser irradiation to improve the hydrogenase activity of the E. aerogenes HB-5M mutant, which had a hydrogen yield of 0.95molH2/mol glucose; the maximum specific rate of hydrogen production by the mutant was twice that of the wild strain W-23 (Lu et al., 2008). Numerous other positive mutants have been generated with atmospheric and room temperature plasma; the hydrogen yield of these mutants was approximately 1.134mol/mol glucose, which was an increase of 26.4% (Lu et al., 2011). Evidently, the mutation breeding method can improve the hydrogen production of E. aerogenes. However, the enhancement of hydrogen yield needs further study. Mutagenesis by γ-ray irradiation can cause morphological and biochemical changes in cells (Feng et al., 2015). A large number of free radicals generated by γ-rays in the cells attack the key functional genes and cause gene breakage and recombination because γ-rays interact with molecules and atoms, especially with water molecules (Kovacs and Keresztes, 2002). γ-rays possess better mutagenic ability and strong penetrability compared with other forms of radiation. Cheng et al. (2014) significantly increased the growth rate and lipid productivity of microalgae using γ-rays irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, studies concerning hydrogen-producing bacteria mutated by γ-ray irradiation have yet to be reported. A large number of samples are randomly selected to test the hydrogen yield in a batch experiment after irradiation to screen the positive mutant strains (Ren et al., 2006). It’s quite difficult to test each strain’s hydrogen yield or producing rate to screen the positive mutant strains because of tremendous bacteria strains. Although positive mutant strains could be obtained by large-scale experiments on selection and fermentation, this traditional method is time-consuming, inefficient and difficult to perform. To our best knowledge, no studies on E. aerogenes mutated by 60Co γ-rays to enhance hydrogen production have been reported in literature to date. γ-rays possess better mutagenic ability and strong penetrability compared with other forms of radiation. The mutation process of γ-ray irradiation has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost. The screened E. aerogenes mutant with high hydrogen productivity has the potential to be utilized on the biological hydrogen production through the anaerobic fermentation of biomass wastes, such as molasses wastewater and food waste in future industrial applications. This paper is intended to fill in this gap in the state of the art. Thus, the objectives of the present study are to: (1) Screen E. aerogenes positive mutants with improved hydrogen production using colour circles of acid by-products. (2) Improve hydrogenase activity and hydrogen production of E. aerogenes, and compare metabolic by-products of the mutant and wild strains. (3) Examine the hereditary stability of the screened E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and medium,"2.1 Bacterial strains and medium Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC13408 was purchased from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre. The Luria Bertani (LB) culture medium contained 5g/L yeast extract, 10g/L peptone and 10g/L NaCl. The solid LB medium also contained 20g/L agar."
3,Mutagenesis and selection of E. aerogenes,"2.2 Mutagenesis and selection of E. aerogenes 1mL of the overnight seed culture of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 was inoculated into 100mL of the LB medium. Batch cultivations were performed aerobically in a shaker incubator at 37°C and 180rpm for 6–8h until the cells reached the mid-log phase. The bacterial cell culture was centrifuged to prepare a bacterial suspension with normal saline. Six centrifuge tubes (5mL) with 1mL of bacterial suspension were immersed in ice water and irradiated with 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000Gy of 60Co γ-rays, respectively (Zhejiang Institute of Agriculture and Nuclear Application Technology, Zhejiang, China). All samples were immersed in ice water for 1–2h after irradiation to inhibit the activity of intracellular repair enzymes. A 0.1mL aliquot of each sample was diluted with equal amounts of LB medium. The diluted samples were evenly applied on the solid medium in an incubator (37°C) for 24h. The lethality percentage of E. aerogenes irradiated by different doses of 60Co γ-rays was calculated based on the following equation: (1) Lethality percentage = [ ( A - I ) / A ] × 100 % , where A is the total colony count of the sample without irradiation and I is the total colony count irradiated by 60Co γ-rays. All colony numbers were obtained by the CFU (colony-forming unit) method on solid medium. The irradiated samples of each bacterial suspension were respectively diluted and evenly applied on the screening medium. The screening medium contained 20g/L of glucose, 5g/L of yeast extract, 10g/L of peptone, 10g/L of NaCl, 20g/L of agar and 0.4g/L of bromcresol purple. Yeast, peptone and NaCl were same with the culture medium to help bacterial cells grow and reproduce. The screening medium was used for selecting positive mutants by hydrogen production. Glucose substrate was essential to provide suitable carbon source for hydrogen and metabolite production in dark fermentation. The colour of bromcresol purple will change from purple to yellow in acid condition. The size of the yellow circle visually shows the quantity of acid by fermentation, and then indirectly evaluates hydrogen productivity of strains. If one mutant is surrounded by larger yellow circle, it has a larger yield of acid by-products. It’s probable that the yield of acetic acid or butyric acid is positively correlated with the hydrogen yield of the mutant. Positive mutants can be screened based on sizes of yellow circles by the pH indicator. Several well-grown strains with larger yellow circles were selected from the screening medium in an incubator (37°C) after 12–24h. Sole cells of the mutant strains were selected with an inoculation loop and used to inoculate 100mL LB medium; these cells were cultured until the mid-log phase. The hydrogen yields of the selected mutants with larger yellow circles were verified by fermentative experiments to further screen the mutant with markedly improved hydrogen productivity. Eventually, a mutant E. aerogenes ZJU1 with a significantly increased hydrogen yield was obtained."
4,Hydrogen production by fermentation,"2.3 Hydrogen production by fermentation 1mL each of the overnight seed cultures of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 and E. aerogenes ZJU1 were respectively inoculated into 100mL of LB medium. Batch cultivations were performed for 6h at 37°C and 180rpm aerobically in an incubator shaker until the cells reached mid-log phase. Bacterial cells were added to 200mL of the fermentative medium, which contained 3g glucose and 0.03g FeCl2, with 1mL vitamin liquid and 1mL microelement liquid. The vitamin liquid contained 0.01g/L glutamic acid, 0.025g/L ascorbic acid, 0.025g/L riboflavin, 0.02g/L citric acid monohydrate, 0.01g/L folic acid, 0.01g/L p-aminobenzoic acid and 0.025g/L creatide. The microelement liquid contained 0.01g/L MnCl2, 0.05g/L ZnCl2, 0.01g/L H3BO3, 0.01g/L CaCl2, 0.01g/L Na2MoO4, 0.2g/L CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01g/L AlK(SO4)2 and 0.01g/L NiCl2·6H2O. Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in 350mL glass bottles in triplicate. Each bottle was purged with N2 gas for 10min to ensure an anaerobic environment. The pH value was adjusted to 6.0±0.2 by adding 6M NaOH every 12h during hydrogen fermentation. The fermentation temperature was maintained at 37°C in a thermostatic water bath."
5,Hydrogenase assay,"2.4 Hydrogenase assay 1mL of the fermentative liquid with actively-fermenting cells was collected from the wild-type E. aerogenes and E. aerogenes ZJU1 suspensions to quantify the hydrogenase activity. The culture was moved into a sealed 13mL vial, which was purged with N2 gas in advance. The cells were lysed with glass beads in 2mL of the anaerobic induction buffer and 200μl of the sodium–dithionite solution (Song et al., 2011). The vial was purged with N2 gas to ensure an anaerobic environment before 2mL of Na-dithionite-reduced methyl viologen (MV) buffer was added. The hydrogenase released from the lysed cells was used to produce H2 from the reduced MV. The amount of evolved H2 was used to evaluate the hydrogenase activity of both strains (Carrieri et al., 2008; Zorin, 1986; Peck and Gest, 1956)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The experiments were conducted in triplicates for all the conditions. The results were expressed as mean (±standard deviation). The optical density of wild and mutant E. aerogenes cells at 600nm (OD600) was measured on a spectrophotometer (Unico UV-2600, China). The biogas produced from batch experiments for hydrogen production was measured every 12h. The concentrations of H2 and CO2 were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) apparatus (Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The metabolic by-products mainly consisted of ethanol, acetate and butyrate. These by-products were determined by another GC apparatus (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionisation detector. Both measurements of biogas and metabolic by-products were both previously described in detail (Lin et al., 2015). The dynamic parameters of cumulative hydrogen yield were simulated by the modified Gompertz equation with Origin 8.0. (2) H = H m exp { - exp [ R m e / H m ( λ - t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative volume of hydrogen yield (mL), H m is the maximum hydrogen production potential (mL), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), e is 2.718, λ is the lag-phase time (h) and t is the incubation time (h). The overall volumetric hydrogen production rate (R overall) is defined in the following equation as an index for evaluating the performance of hydrogen production because both the rate and time delay were taken into consideration (Su et al., 2009). (3) R overall = H m / { [ ( H m / R m ) + λ ] V } where V represents the working volume of the culture."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Mutation and selection of mutants with improved hydrogen productivity,"3.1 Mutation and selection of mutants with improved hydrogen productivity After irradiation with 60Co γ-rays, the E. aerogenes cell suspension was diluted and evenly applied on the solid medium. Bacterial strains were cultivated in an incubator (37°C) for 24h. The lethality percentages of E. aerogenes irradiated by different doses of 60Co γ-rays are shown in Fig. 1 . More positive mutant strains were obtained when the radiation dose was below 400Gy. However, these positive mutants barely showed any improvements in the hydrogen productivity at lethality percentages of 40%–70%. As the dose was increased, the percentage of bacterial lethality was increased, whereas the positive mutation rate was decreased. More negative mutants but fewer positive mutants were obtained when the dose exceeded 800Gy (Shi and Wu, 2013). Therefore, the screening positive mutants with improved hydrogen yield is beneficial when the percentage of E. aerogenes lethality is approximately 80%–90%. The lethality rate of E. aerogenes irradiated by 60Co γ-rays was 84% at 600Gy. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 1, the irradiated cell suspension was diluted and evenly applied on the screening medium. Most of the strains were only 3–4mm, and the yellow circle diameters were 6–8mm. The well-grown mutant strains (5–6mm) with larger yellow circles (diameter: 8–12mm) of more fermentative acid by-products were selected. According to the hydrogen-producing equations of E. aerogenes (Eqs. (4) and (5)), acetic acid and butyric acid were also generated during hydrogen production (Hawkes et al., 2007). Theoretically, if the hydrogen yield were improved, the yield of acetic acid or butyric acid would also increase. Mutants with higher hydrogen productivity can be obtained by selecting for those with improved acid productivity based on the sizes of their coloured circles in the culture medium. Fermentative experiments verified the hydrogen productivity of these selected mutants that formed larger yellow circles. Eventually, the E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant was obtained; the hydrogen yield of this strain was significantly increased. (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 Growth of E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant and the wild cells was tested. 1mL culture of the wild and mutant were respectively inoculated into 100mL of the LB medium and the values of OD600 were set as 0 for the very low cell concentration. At first, E. aerogenes ZJU1 grew faster than the wild because of the larger size of mutant cell. After 3h, OD600 of the mutant and wild were 1.7 and 1.25, respectively, but the growth rate of the wild became faster. After 12h, OD600 of the mutant was 3.32, and that of the wild strain was 3.46. Eventually, the value of OD600 with E. aerogenes ZJU1 was slightly lower than that of the wild, and the little difference barely affected the hydrogen yield."
9,Hydrogenase activity,"3.2 Hydrogenase activity To elucidate the mutagenic mechanism of E. aerogenes irradiated by 60Co γ-rays, the hydrogenase activities of the wild and mutant strains were investigated. The hydrogenase activity is defined as the hydrogen yield from 1g cells in dry weight (DW) per hour. As shown in Fig. 2 , the hydrogenase activity of 157.4±8.9mLH2/(gDWh) with the E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant was higher by 75.3% than that of 89.8±7.5mLH2/(gDWh) with the wild strain. The hydrogenase activity of E. aerogenes was significantly improved by 60Co γ-ray irradiation. This improvement may be attributed to the 60Co γ-ray irradiation, which causes mutagenesis in the gene encoding enzymes, thereby increasing the active hydrogenase in cells."
10,Hydrogen productivity,"3.3 Hydrogen productivity To improve the hydrogen yield of both strains, 1% (w/v) malt extract and 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract were added to the initial fermentation medium (containing 1% glucose) for promoting cell growth and reproduction (Song et al., 2011). Fig. 3 shows the results of hydrogen production with both strains during fermentation. As shown in Fig.3a, the maximum specific rate of hydrogen production with the mutant strain E. aerogenes ZJU1 was 27.19±1.79mL/(L·h), which was significantly higher than that of the wild strain (19.33±0.81mL/(L·h)). Moreover, the peak for the mutant strain lasted longer to generate more hydrogen. As shown in Fig.3b, the cumulative hydrogen yield of 903.09±29.30mL with the mutant was higher by 81.8% than the yield of 496.74±20.65mL with the wild strain. The hydrogen yield increased from 1.32±0.06mol/mol glucose to 2.41±0.08mol/mol glucose after E. aerogenes was irradiated by 60Co γ-rays. The dynamic parameters of hydrogen production with the wild and mutant strains are shown in Table 1 . The R overall of E. aerogenes ZJU1 was 15.8mL/L/h, which increased by 71.7% compared with that of the wild type. The lag-phase time for wild E. aerogenes and E. aerogenes ZJU1 were 27.2 and 32.7h, respectively. Hydrogen is mainly produced by Enterobacter species via one of the following methods. First, the mixed acid fermentative pathway evolves hydrogen by formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) during formate decomposition (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001). Second, in the NADH pathway, hydrogen evolution occurs by hydrogenase via NADH oxidation (Tanisho et al., 1998). After irradiation of E. aerogenes by 60Co-γ-rays, the formate or NADH pathway was intensified to promote hydrogen production. More than ten generations of E. aerogenes ZJU1 were cultivated to evaluate the hereditary stability. 1mL bacterial cell (first-generation) culture was respectively inoculated into three bottles of 100mL LB medium. Batch cultivations were performed aerobically in a shaker incubator at 37°C and 180rpm for 6–8h until the cells reached the mid-log phase. Then, 6mL of bacterial cell culture was introduced in six tubes and preserved with record number (second-generation). The rest culture of E. aerogenes ZJU1 (second-generation) was used for fermentation to assess the hydrogen productivity. The third-generation of E. aerogenes ZJU1 would be obtained during next batch cultivations of second-generation. The process would be repeated until fermentation of E. aerogenes ZJU1 (tenth-generation) had been performed. As shown in Fig. 4 , the hydrogen yield of the mutant E. aerogenes ZJU1 was constant within ten subcultures. The hereditary stability of E. aerogenes ZJU1 for hydrogen productivity was maintained after ten subcultures. Therefore, a stable E. aerogenes mutant irradiated by 60Co γ-rays with high hydrogen production was obtained."
11,Metabolic by-products,"3.4 Metabolic by-products The metabolic by-products of both strains were measured every 12h during hydrogen fermentation. The by-products were mainly composed of acetate, butyrate and ethanol for both strains. As shown in Fig. 5 , changes in the yields of these liquid by-products were analysed during H2 fermentation. A comparison of the metabolites of both strains revealed that the final concentrations of acetate and butyrate were increased from the wild strain to the mutant strain, whereas that of the ethanol decreased. Final concentrations (mM) of acetate, butyrate and ethanol in the mutant strain were 23.63±0.57, 28.91±0.16 and 17.68±0.93, respectively, whereas those in the wild strain were 19.84±0.46, 12.01±0.0032 and 32.08±0.36, respectively. These changes in metabolites corresponded to the enhanced hydrogen productivity in the mutant strain. According to these metabolic pathways, the glucose substrate is degraded to pyruvate for ATP production, while NAD+ is reduced to NADH (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2012). Pyruvate is converted into acetyl coenzyme A and ferredoxin or formate, which could produce H2 (Cai et al., 2011). NADH is released as reducing equivalents during glycolysis. For continued glycolysis, NADH needs to be re-oxidised by producing H2, ethanol and organic acids. Competition was observed among H2, ethanol and butyrate production because these reactions consume 1, 2 and 2mol/mol of NADH, respectively. However, acetate production does not require NADH (Cheng et al., 2013). Two ethanol units or one butyrate unit can be produced from one glucose unit. Two ethanol units can consume four NADH units, whereas one butyrate unit only needs two NADH units. The wild strain produced less H2 because metabolism favours ethanol production to maintain the balance of reducing equivalents (Zhang et al., 2009). For the mutant strain, more NADH was used to produce H2 but less NADH was consumed to produce the by-products. More acetate and butyrate were produced compared with ethanol; thus, less NADH was required. The metabolism of E. aerogenes ZJU1 has changed after irradiation of 60Co γ-rays. These changes in metabolites correspond to the enhanced hydrogen productivity in the mutant strain."
12,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated that irradiation with 60Co γ-rays can alter the hydrogenase activity and metabolism of E. aerogenes. The E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant with larger yellow circles was screened. The hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes ZJU1 was 2.41mol/mol glucose, which was 81.8% higher than the wild strain. The hereditary stability of E. aerogenes ZJU1 for hydrogen productivity was maintained after ten subcultures. Genetic analyses will contribute to figuring out the key genes of E. aerogenes in hydrogen fermentation in future. It is promising to utilize the mutated E. aerogenes to facilitate fermentative hydrogen production from biomass waste in industrial applications."
