0,Introduction,"Efforts have to be put forth to avoid the climate change and ocean acidification as the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 greenhouse gas continue to rise [1]. Catalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is one of the important practical routes to reduce CO2 emissions while fossil fuels dominate the energy sector [2–4]. CO2 can be catalytically reduced by H2 to various products such as hydrocarbons, CO, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and alcohols in a homogeneous or heterogeneous way [1–3]. Although catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been studied extensively in the last decades [2], it still remains as a challenge to develop highly selective catalyst for large-scale commercialization because CO2 hydrogenation involves a complex reaction network which is restricted by thermodynamics and kinetics. Thermodynamics calculation of chemical reactions is helpful in understanding and predicting the complicated catalytic process [5–7]. It provides preliminary information in the chemical process, for instance, the thermodynamics stability of desired chemical species, the yield and selectivity of target product, the reaction heat as well as the impact of reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratio. The thermodynamics analysis is of benefit to tailor the reaction conditions, and thus improve the conversion of reactants and the selectivity toward the favorable products. Combination of thermodynamics calculation and experimental validation is a useful tool to understand the intrinsic process in CO2 hydrogenation reaction [8–11]. Gao et al. investigated the thermodynamics of CO2 methanation reaction and calculated the reaction heats and equilibrium constants of eighteen single CO2 direct hydrogenation reactions [8]. Xu et al. conducted a thermodynamics analysis of formic acid synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation [12]. Nonetheless, these works were limited to simple systems with only a few products. Therefore, a more comprehensive thermodynamics analysis is desirable toward CO2 hydrogenation. The Gibbs free energy minimization method is widely employed to deal with complicated reaction systems and obtain the corresponding equilibrium composition [6–8]. Based on the principle that the reaction system processes the minimum total Gibbs free energy at the equilibrium state, it is not necessary to know the accurate equilibrium constant of each reaction step for a multi-steps reaction system. The equilibrium distribution of the product mixture can be established by minimizing the Gibbs free energy function, which is subject to the mass balance constraints if only reactants and products are given in the first place. Herein, systematic thermodynamics analyses of CO2 hydrogenation reactions were conducted using the total Gibbs free energy minimization method. The products including carbon, carbon monoxide, carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid), aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde), alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanols and butanols), alkanes (methane, ethane, propane and butanes), alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and butenes), and alkynes (ethyne, propyne, and butynes) were considered (the isomers were also included if needed). In addition, for given product group, the relations between product distribution and reaction conditions (such as reactant compositions, temperature, and pressure) were also investigated. As the reaction kinetics and the transport phenomena were not involved in thermodynamics calculations, the practical reaction data was obtained on well-designed catalytic experiments. The satisfactory match between thermodynamics calculations and experimental results provided a clear picture on the entire reaction process toward CO2 hydrogenation reaction."
1,Calculation and experimental method,
2,Calculation method,"2.1 Calculation method The method was performed on the software ChemCAD (Chemstations, Inc. trail version 7.0). The detailed principles involved in the calculation can be found in the literature [8]. The K-value models and enthalpy models determined by the temperature and pressure ranges in the ChemCAD software are listed in Table S1 (see supporting information). The conversion, selectivity, and yield of species i were defined as follows, respectively: The conversion of speciesi : X i ( % ) = N i , in − N i , out N i , in × 100 % The selectivity of speciesi : S i ( % ) = j i N i , out − j i N i , in N C O 2 , in − N C O 2 , out × 100 % The yield of speciesi : Y i ( % ) = j i N i , out − j i N i , in N C O 2 , in × 100 % Among which, Ni, in and Ni, out are the molar flow rate of species i at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively, while ji is the number of carbon atoms in species i. It should be noted that as the isomers were considered in the calculation, the selectivity of the species with isomers is the total selectivity of all isomers and the method is also applied in the calculation of yield."
3,Experimental method,"2.2 Experimental method To validate the thermodynamics calculation results, catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 over 10wt% Cu/CeO2 and 10wt% Ni/CeO2 catalysts were carried out. It was reported that Cu is an effective catalyst in water–gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) [13,14]. Also, Ni catalysts (10wt% Ni/CeO2) have been attempted in CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 reaction (CO2 +4H2 ↔ xCH4 + yCO+ zH2O) by several groups [15–17]. In this work, both catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and the reactions were carried out in a fixed bed plug flow reactor. A low space velocity was used in order to reach the equilibrium state. Typically, 1.0g of catalyst diluted with 1.0g of SiC were loaded and pretreated under purified H2 at 400°C for 30min. The catalyst temperature was monitored by a K-type thermocouple positioned inside the catalyst bed. Flow of CO2 and H2 mixture gas with different ratios was controlled using mass flow controller (Alicat Scientific, Inc.) at a total flow rate of 100mL/min (standard temperature and pressure). The hourly gas space velocity (GSV) was 6000mL/g/h. The reaction temperature was 200–700°C at an interval of 50°C and the ramp rate was 5°C/min. The concentrations of CO, CO2, H2, CH4 and N2 in the inlet and outlet streams were measured by an on-line gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent Technologies) equipped with TCD and FID detector. CO2 was separated using a Hayesep Q column while CO, CH4 and N2 were separated by a Mol sieve 5A column. In the present work, we focus on the thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions, whereas the reaction kinetics is not considered. Indeed, in real CO2 conversion process, both thermodynamic reaction control and kinetic control play important roles in determining the composition of a product mixture. Thus, the catalyst morphology, activity and stability will affect the reaction selectivity and yield to some degree. However, the investigation on catalyst effect is out of the scope of this work, hence the detailed discussion is not involved."
4,Results and discussion,"Considering that the product mixture is usually obtained in a real catalytic process for CO2 hydrogenation, the products are divided into five groups: carbon monoxide and/or methane, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and hydrocarbons."
5,Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO and/or CH4,"3.1 Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO and/or CH4 Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO via reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS, CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O) has been recognized as one of the most promising processes for CO2 utilization because CO can be used in downstream Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) reaction and methanol synthesis, etc. The RWGS reaction is also gaining interests in the context of the human missions to Mars primarily for its potential to produce water and oxygen [18]. As shown in Table 1 , the RWGS reaction is endothermic and the Gibbs free energy change is positive at 1bar and 25°C. The equilibrium constant at this condition is extremely low (9.67×10−6). The RWGS reactions with different CO2/H2 ratios in the range of 2/1 to 1/10 are performed at 100–800°C and the corresponding equilibrium values are shown in Fig. 1(a). The effect of pressure can be ignored as the number of molecules does not change in this reaction, which is supported by the overlaps of curves with same CO2/H2 ratio but different pressure. However, temperature reveals a critical influence on the equilibrium CO yield (CO2 conversion). Within the temperature range, the equilibrium CO yield is increasing with temperature for any feed composition, due to the endothermic characteristics of the RWGS reaction. Moreover, a significant increase in the equilibrium yield of CO is observed with increasing initial H2 concentration in the feed. When the ratio of CO2/H2 is 1/1, the CO yield is obtained nearly 50% at 800°C and reaches 90% when the ratio changes to 1/10 under the same temperature. In order to verify the theoretical calculations, the catalytic testing is conducted on Cu/CeO2, which is a typical selective catalyst for WGS transformation [13,14] and is probably also active for RWGS reaction. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the comparison results are perfectly matched in the region of medium-high temperature, >350°C and >400°C under the ratio of CO2/H2 1/1 and 1/4, respectively, that is, reaction remains at the equilibrium state by the thermodynamics limitation, which agrees well with the standpoints from several catalyst systems reported before [19,20]. However, it cannot reach the equilibrium at relatively low reaction temperature (<350°C) due to the poor activity of the catalyst. Frequently, the RWGS reaction exists as a side reaction in CO2 methanation in both laboratory scale and industrial process, depending on the catalyst and operating parameters. The calculations based on the Gibbs free energy minimization method and catalytic testing over Ni/CeO2 was performed to represent the equilibrium values of CO2 methanation in the presence of CO as a byproduct. The reaction pressure and the CO2/H2 ratio in the feed are kept at 1bar and 1/4, respectively (shown in Fig. 1c and d). In accordance with the CO2 profile of single CO2 methanation reaction, the CO2 conversion decreases from 100 to 600°C, followed by steady increase at high temperatures for CO2 methanation in the presence of RWGS side reaction. The selectivity studies on CH4 and CO indicate that CH4 is the main product below 600°C; further increase in the temperature leads to the larger percentage of CO because the amount of CH4 produced reduces rapidly. The 100% selectivity to CO can be seen at 750°C, implying that the exothermic CO2-to-CH4 reaction dominates at the temperatures below 600°C, whereas the RWGS reaction is the predominate one above 600°C. Fig. 1(d) shows that the experiment data obtained on Ni/CeO2 catalyst perfectly fits the calculated values except the CO2 conversion at the temperature below 300°C, which is attributed to the poor activity of the catalyst under such a low temperature. The further investigation demonstrates that adding inert gas (N2) into the reactant stream slightly decreases the CO2 conversion and the CH4 selectivity, whereas it increases the selectivity of CO in the temperature range of 450–700°C (see Fig. S1 in supporting information). CO2 can be reduced to carbon according to the following reaction equation: CO2 +2H2 ↔C+2H2O. Table S2 listed the Gibbs energy, enthalpy changes as well as standard equilibrium constant of CO2 hydrogenation to carbon at 298K. The effects of temperature, pressure, H2/CO2 molar ratio were studied and the results are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that low temperature is favorable for the reduction of CO2 to carbon by H2. Increasing pressure will increase the conversion of CO2 since the number of total molecules in reaction is reducing. In addition, higher H2/CO2 ratio will also benefit the production of carbon. However, till now, there are still few reports on this reaction."
6,Hydrogenation of CO2 to carboxylic acids,"3.2 Hydrogenation of CO2 to carboxylic acids It has been reported that CO2 can be hydrogenated to carboxylic acids, like formic acid [21–23] and acetic acid [24] under certain conditions. Formic acid (HCOOH) has attracted tremendous attention as a safe and convenient hydrogen carrier in fuel cells designed for portable use [22]. As shown in Table 2 , the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid is an endothermic reaction with a ΔH Θ (298K) of 14.9kJ/mol and a ΔG Θ of 43.5kJ/mol at standard condition, as well as the equilibrium constant is very small, only 2.43×10−8 at 298K. However, with the increase of the number of the carbon atoms in carboxylic acids, the reaction process turns to exothermic and the Gibbs free energy turns to negative value. For example, for the CO2 to acetic acid conversion, ΔG Θ decreases to −21.6kJ/mol, which is thermodynamically more favorable than the formation of formic acid. Although the thermodynamics prefers the production of higher-carbon acids, it is difficult in the practical catalysis process due to the kinetic constraints in C–C coupling. Very recently, synthesis of acetic acid via methanol hydrocarboxylation with CO2 and H2 was reported [25]. For simple system of CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid, the effects of reaction temperature and pressure on CO2 conversion (same as HCOOH yield) were calculated with the aid of the Gibbs free energy minimization method, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The yield of HCOOH is very low (less than 0.01%) in a wide temperature (100–400°C) and pressure (1–300bar) range. Although the increasing of pressure and temperature can enhance the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH, the improvement is insignificant. In order to achieve a high yield of HCOOH, the addition of base species in the reaction system is one of the effective strategies [19]. For instance, introducing NH3 can greatly increase the equilibrium constant (see Table 2). Compared with the reaction to produce formic acid, the formation of acetic acid is much more thermodynamically favored with much high CO2 conversion under the same reaction conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, we consider a mixed products system, which contains formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid, and the selectivity of each product and CO2 conversion under different temperatures and pressures are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). It can be seen that the higher carbon acid possesses higher selectivity and propionic acid is the dominant product (selectivity >90%) under all reaction conditions, indicating that the thermodynamics prefers the formation of the acid with more carbon atoms. This is in accordance with the trends of the three single reactions. In addition, the product distributions vary little at different pressures and CO2/H2 molar ratios. However, in practical terms, suitable catalysts for the production of acetic acid or propionic acid are rarely reported and still need further investigations."
7,Hydrogenation of CO2 to aldehydes,"3.3 Hydrogenation of CO2 to aldehydes Table 3 reveals the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy changes and standard equilibrium constants for the hydrogenation of CO2 to aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde under standard condition. Only the formation of formaldehyde from CO2 hydrogenation has a positive ΔG Θ, whereas the formation processes of higher carbon aldehydes have much smaller values. Moreover, the value of ΔG Θ decreases with the increase of carbon numbers in the aldehydes, and consequently the thermodynamics tends to produce the aldehyde with higher carbon number rather than lower one. This is very similar with the case for CO2 hydrogenation to carboxylic acids. According to the thermodynamics calculations for hydrogenation of CO2 to formaldehyde, the CO2 equilibrium conversion increases monotonically when the reaction temperature or pressure rises, as shown in Fig. 3(a). However, the HCHO yield (CO2 conversion) is no more than 0.5% in the temperature range of 200–500°C and pressure range of 1–100bar, due to the very high and positive Gibbs free energy change value. Higher pressure and temperature will increase the conversion of CO2 to HCHO since the reaction is an endothermic process with reducing number of molecules. The selective formation of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide and hydrogen (CO2 +2H2 ↔HCHO+H2O) over PtCu/SiO2 was reported previously [26]. The experimental results at H2/CO2 molar ratio of 20/1 under 150°C and 6bar also showed a very low yield of HCHO (estimated to be ∼1.5×10−5) in CO2 hydrogenation process, which is consistent with our calculation results, due to the thermodynamic limitation. The single process of CO2 hydrogenation to acetaldehyde is thermodynamically more likely to occur as compared to formaldehyde production. Fig. 3(b) shows the equilibrium values and the effects of temperature and pressure on the CO2-to-acetaldehyde process. The results demonstrate that low temperature and high pressure are beneficial to enhance the reaction activity. When the temperature is as low as 200°C, the conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde can reach 20% and almost 100% under atmosphere pressure and 100bar, respectively. Nonetheless, three-carbon propionaldehyde is the main product under given reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), if we take a mixed products system including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde into account. In addition, reaction pressure and CO2/H2 molar ratio have little effects on the variation of product selectivity, since propionaldehyde is much more preferred thermodynamically compared with formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Therefore, from thermodynamic point of view, we expect that aldehyde molecules with longer carbon chains are more facile to be obtained from CO2 hydrogenation due to negative ΔG values. However, in the real catalysis process, it is difficult to complete the production of those high carbon aldehydes due to the kinetic limitations. Therefore, design of highly efficient catalysts to reach the equilibrium value is still a challenge."
8,Hydrogenation of CO2 to alcohols,"3.4 Hydrogenation of CO2 to alcohols Recently, the hydrogenation of CO2 to alcohols has attracted more attention since alcohols are good energy carriers [27–31]. As listed in Table 4 , CO2 can be hydrogenated to different alcohols like methanol, ethanol and higher alcohols. In these reactions, the synthesis of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation is the most direct route and widely investigated one for CO2 utilization because methanol can be used as fuel additive, fuel substitute and precursor to many commodity chemicals [28–30]. The hydrogenation process of CO2 to methanol has the ΔG Θ of 3.5kJ/mol, corresponding to an equilibrium constant of 2.45×10−1 at 298K (Table 4). Fig. 4 (a) gives the calculation profiles of CO2 conversion to methanol at different reaction temperatures and pressures. The equilibrium conversion of CO2 decreases regularly with increasing the temperature because of the exothermic property (ΔH Θ of −49.3kJ/mol). Higher pressure leads to higher CO2 conversion at the same reaction temperature as the reaction is a volume reducing reaction. Under the atmosphere condition, CO2 can be hardly converted (conversion <1%) in the whole temperature range. However, the CO2 conversion of ∼100% can be achieved under 50bar at 100°C and remained at up to 250°C under both the pressure of 200 and 300bar. From the thermodynamics analysis, low temperature and high pressure can significantly boost the methanol production. In a typical case of industrial synthesis, CO, H2 and a small amount of CO2 could be catalyzed to form methanol efficiently by a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst between 5 and 10MPa at 220–300°C [32,33]. In addition, it has been reported that outstanding one-pass CO2 conversion (>95%) and methanol selectivity (>98%) were accomplished under optimized reaction conditions (H2/CO2 >10/1, 360bar and 260°C) [34]. This is generally consistent with the calculated values in Fig. 4(a). For comparison, hydrogenation of CO to methanol was also calculated and revealed similar trends with CO2-to-methanol process, as given in Fig. S3. The formation of ethanol from CO2 hydrogenation is more favorable under same reaction conditions from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, and the calculation analysis results are shown in Fig. 4(b). The ethanol yield (CO2 conversion) of ∼85% can be obtained even at 100°C and 1bar, while ∼100% yield can be kept at a temperature as high as 300°C under reaction pressure of 300bar. If we consider methanol, ethanol, propanols, and butanols as the possible products in a single system, we can propose the product distributions in Fig. 4(c) (CO2/H2 ratio of 1/1 at 50bar) and Fig. 4(d) (CO2/H2 ratio of 1/5 at 200bar) according to the thermodynamics calculations. Butanol is the dominant product over a wide range of reaction conditions. A small amount of propanol (1%–5%) is yielded whereas the selectivity of methanol and ethanol is so small that it can be neglected. This trend is in accordance with Gibbs free energy change values in Table 4. The calculation results indicate that production of higher alcohol is more thermodynamically favorable. To our knowledge, dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) and CO are regarded as common byproducts in the process of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [22,25]. Although related thermodynamics investigations have been reported, their calculations were limited to binary product systems, i.e., CH3OH+CO or CH3OCH3 +CO [9]. Therefore, it is necessary to perform the thermodynamics study toward a more complicated ternary product system, which contains CH3OH, CO, and CH3OCH3. The calculation results are shown in Fig. 5. CO2 hydrogenation solely to CH3OCH3 was also calculated and given in Fig. S4. The curve of CO2 conversion to ternary products is a little different from that of single CO2-to-CH3OH process. As shown in Fig. 5(a), CO2 conversion decreases monotonously in the low temperature range and followed by slight increase at higher temperatures. Three reasons may account for such U-shaped curves. (1) The production of CH3OCH3 is an exothermic process, and plays a major role at lower temperature. (2) The RWGS reaction of CO2-to-CO prefers high temperature, which dominates the CO2 conversion over a high temperature range. (3) Though CH3OH selectivity reveals a volcano-shaped variation trend, it plays a little role in the entire process. Additionally the thermodynamics profiles toward such system can be verified by the selectivity of the products. In addition, we find that this process is sensitive to pressure. Particularly, a high pressure greatly accelerates the CO2 conversion and tends to enhance the selectivity for CH3OH and CH3OCH3 but not for CO (Fig. 5b–d). In Fig. 5(b) the maximum point of CH3OH selectivity moves to higher temperature direction with the increasing pressure, due to the joint effects that methanol formation is a volume reducing and exothermic reaction. A high CH3OCH3 selectivity can be obtained at low temperature and high pressure and kept in a wide temperature range (Fig. 5c). In order to reduce CO production, low temperature and high pressure are needed (Fig. 5d). CH3OH yield and CH3OCH3 yield are given in Fig. S5. Based on the above analyses, it is recommended that typical CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH process needs lower temperature (<300°C) and a relatively high pressure (>30bar)."
9,Hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons,"3.5 Hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons Heterogeneous catalytic CO2 conversion to value-added hydrocarbons has been widely studied in recent years [8,35–37]. Table 5 listed the Gibbs free energy, and enthalpy changes as well as standard equilibrium constants for hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons, like methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene. The ΔG Θ of the formation to CH4 is much smaller than the other reactions, which means CH4 is the most favorable product among all the hydrocarbons. The order of production preference for CO2-to-alkanes conversion in thermodynamics is CH4 >C2H6 >C3H8 >C4H10, as their ΔG Θ values increase along with the increasing of the carbon numbers. However, the opposite trend is observed for the production of alkenes and alkynes from CO2 hydrogenation based on the thermodynamics analyses. The effects of temperature (100–600°C) and pressure (1–100bar) on the conversion of CO2 to CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C2H2, and C3H4 in each single reaction were calculated, as shown in Fig. S6. It can be seen that CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C3H6 are more favorable to be obtained compared with C2H2 and C3H4 in thermodynamics. In the following parts, we will discuss the production of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes as well as their mixture, respectively. 3.5.1 CO2 hydrogenation to lower alkanes (CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10) CO2 can be hydrogenated to alkanes, such as CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10. If we consider all these products together in a system, at thermodynamically equilibrium state, CH4 is most selective with the high selectivity of 99% under various reaction conditions (CO2/H2 molar ratio from 1/1 to 1/5, pressure from 1 to 300bar, temperature range of 100–600°C, figures are not shown here) 3.5.2 CO2 hydrogenation to lighter alkenes C2H4, C3H6, and C4H8 The light alkenes are particularly ethylene (C2H4), propylene (C3H6), and butene (C4H8), and they are important intermediates in the manufacture of products such as plastics, solvents, paints, and medicines [38]. For a reaction system of CO2 hydrogenation to mixed products of C2H4, C3H6, and C4H8, the effects of temperature, pressure and CO2/H2 ratio on the equilibrium status were investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 6. C4H8 is the dominant product over others in the low temperature range; however, its selectivity gradually decreases with the increase of temperature. The temperature is the principal factor for C4H8 formation, which prefers a low reaction temperature. In contrast to C4H8, a high reaction temperature can facilitate the formation of C2H4 and thus increase the selectivity. C3H6 production is also sensitive to the reaction temperature. The relation between C3H6 selectivity and temperature displays a volcano-shaped curve under 1bar but linearity under 50bar. The pressure influences the product distributions for all three alkenes, especially a high pressure is beneficial to improve the formation of C4H8 and C3H6 but not C2H4. For instance, the selectivity to C4H8, C3H6 and C2H4 is varied from 2%, 15% and 83% under 1bar to 36%, 44% and 20% under 50bar, respectively, if the temperature is 600°C and the CO2/H2 ratio is 1:1 (Fig. 6a and b). In addition, it should be noted that the effect of CO2/H2 ratio on product selectivity is inappreciable. The conversion of CO2 comes from the cooperative effect of the formation processes of three kinds of alkenes, which is simultaneously affected by the temperature, pressure and CO2/H2 ratio as well. In particular, CO2 conversion tends to occur under an optimized reaction condition, which is a lower temperature, a lower CO2/H2 ratio and a higher pressure. 3.5.3 CO2 hydrogenation to lower alkynes (C2H2, C3H4, and C4H6) For a reaction system of CO2 hydrogenation to mixed products of C2H2, C3H4, and C4H6, the effects of temperature, pressure and CO2/H2 ratio on the equilibrium status were investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that C4H6 nearly achieves 100% selectivity during lower temperature range. Some C3H4 can be found at higher temperature. Pressure and the molar ratio of CO2/H2 have some slight effects on the conversion of CO2 and selectivity of the products. 3.5.4 CO2 hydrogenation to lower alkanes, alkenes and alkynes together The reaction system considering lower alkanes, alkenes and alkynes together was also calculated and the results reveal that CH4 selectivity is above 99% in a wide range of experimental conditions (pressure of 1–300bar, temperature range of 100–800°C, and CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1/1 to 1/6, figures are not shown here)."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we have conducted a systematic thermodynamics analysis toward the hydrogenation of CO2 to various kinds of products such as CO, hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, by employing the total Gibbs free energy minimization method. Based on the theoretical calculation results, the information of equilibrium state and the effect of reaction parameters on both reaction systems with single product and multiple products were clearly illustrated. Particularly, for individual RWGS reaction, the reduction of CO2 to CO needs a high temperature (>500°C) and H2/CO2 ratio to achieve a high conversion. Lower temperature (<500°C) will favor the production of CH4 if both CO and CH4 are considered as products. Direct CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid or formaldehyde is thermodynamically limited unless being disturbed by adding species to the system. According to our thermodynamic calculations, CO2 tends to convert to the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, alcohol, alkene and alkyne with higher carbon numbers (i.e., propionic acid, propionaldehyde, butanol, butene and butynein considered cases) at low temperature (e.g., <200°C) and high pressure (e.g., >10bar). However, it is worth to mention that these reactions are probably limited by kinetics in practice. Thus, designing highly efficient catalysts is critical for further CO2 conversion studies. As for the CO2 hydrogenation to alkanes, high H2/CO2 ratio in the feed, high pressure and low temperature are beneficial for the enhancement of CO2 conversion. Moreover, once CH4 is considered as a kind of product in the mixture of lower alkane, alkenes and alkynes, it will dominate over others, possessing the selectivity of above 99% under all reaction conditions. In addition, well-designed experiments were also conducted on both RWGS reaction and CO2 methanation reaction over Cu/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2 catalysts, respectively. The good match of the calculation results with the experiment data further proves that the Gibbs free energy minimization approach is significantly effective for the thermodynamics analysis of CO2 hydrogenation process. Therefore, this work provides a clear thermodynamic picture on the complicated CO2 conversion process, which is a good reference for the follow-up catalysis research in related areas."
