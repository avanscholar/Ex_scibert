0,Introduction,"Hydrogen fuel cell (FC) generated power by electrochemical oxidation of H2 over platinum based catalysts becomes very popular because it is highly efficient and leaves no carbon emissions behind. Hydrogen FC possessed a higher energy density compared to those storage batteries currently used in electric vehicles (EV), and its driving range was comparable to that of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles [1]. However, platinum and its relevant alloy anodes used in hydrogen FC were highly sensitive to CO poisoning [2]. Hence, the concentration of CO must be reduced to a trace level, e.g., 10 ppm or less for pure Pt anode, and 10–100 ppm or less for CO-tolerant alloy anodes [3–5]. H2-rich gas was primarily produced by steam reforming of hydrocarbons and subsequent water gas shift reactions (WGS). The reformate always contained approximately 0.5-1 vol% CO [6–7]. One of the most straightforward and cost effective methods for CO elimination was preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX) [8]. The catalysts used for PROX could be divided into two major categories, noble metal and transition metal systems. Ceria supported Au or Pt provided distinctive catalytic performance. However, the high cost, poor durability, and least resistance to CO, severely hindered their large-scale commercial applications [9]. Among the transition metal-based catalysts, CuO/CeO2 was the most widely reported catalysts for PROX [10–14]. The high performances of the CuO/CeO2 catalysts had been attributed mainly to the synergistic redox properties of the copper-ceria interfaces [13–14], as compared to other supports supported CuO x catalysts. Although, the CuO/CeO2 catalysts had been investigated for decades, there still exist several problems for commercial uses. Firstly, the reaction temperature is required to be higher than 100 °C to gain a 100% CO conversion. Secondly, the temperature range to achieve ~ 100% CO selectivity is very narrow. Thirdly, mechanism for selective oxidation is still not clear. For CO oxidation on CuO/CeO2 catalyst, it was general agreed that the reaction followed a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, of which the lattice oxygen participated in the catalytic reaction process [15–16]. Regarding the active sites, the highly dispersed CuO x [17–21], or the interface between highly dispersed CuO x and CeO2 {Cu[O x ]Ce} had been proposed [15,22–30]. However, only a few researches had focused on hydrogen oxidation. Gamarra et al. [31] observed that the reduced copper species appeared and increased along with the reaction by in-situ XAFS when the hydrogen began to be oxidized. Thus, they thought that the active site of H2oxidation could be related to the reduced copper species. Han et al. [32] reported that the reduction temperature for the structure [CuO x Ce] and the H2oxidation were the same, and they thought that CO or H2 oxidation shared identical active sites. Kydd et al. [33] held the view that the loss in carbonyl stabilization as a result of significant reduction to Cu0 allowed competitive adsorption between incoming CO and H2 for the active sites. Yang and co-workers [34] also showed that Cu0 is more active for H2 activation and oxidation. Pokrovski et al. [35] proposed that both the adsorption and dissociation of H2 took place on Cu0. Winkler and co-workers [36] had found out that the sticking coefficient of CO on Cu(111) was about five orders of magnitude higher than that of H2. Taking the above discussion and our group’s previous works on CO oxidation into consideration [37–42], in this paper we aimed at synthesizing more efficient CuO/CeO2 catalysts with high activity and selectivity toward preferential oxidation of CO in H2, and understanding the active sites for the oxidation of CO and H2, respectively. The results would be helpful for understanding the key factors that controlled the catalytic performance for PROX."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Ceria nanosheets with predominantly {110} planes were prepared by a hydrothermal method [43]. During the synthesis of CeO2(110), 1 mmol Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 40 ml distilled water, and then 1 ml NH3·H2O was added. Then the mixture was loaded into a Teflon-lined high-pressure autoclave. It was maintained at 220 °C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The obtained light yellow precipitates were separated by centrifuging, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, respectively. Then, the final products were dried in air at 60 °C for 12 h. The Cu/CeO2 was obtained by impregnating the synthesized CeO2(110) into a Cu(NO3)2 solution. The slurry was stirred and aged for three hours, then dried at 60 °C and calcined at 300 °C for two hours in a muffle furnace using 10 oC·min−1 ramp. The obtained catalysts with different Cu loadings were defined as the xwt% CuO/CeO2(110), where × stands for the different CuO loadings (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13)."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out on an ASAP 2020 instrument. Prior to the measurements, all samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 3 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was obtained from the adsorption data. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα (35 kV, 15 mA) source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a TECNAI F-20 with Schottky field emission filament operated at 200 kV and equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an Omicron Sphera II Hemispherical electron energy analyzer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) operated at 15 kV and 300 W. The base pressure of the systems was 5.0 × 10-9 mbar. The sample was pressed into a pellet, fixed to a stainless steel sample holder, and then transferred into the quasi in-situ reaction cell for treatment under various conditions that are comparable with the real reaction conditions. High-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering spectra (HS-LEIS) were obtained using an Ion-TOF Qtac100 instrument. In order to improve the sensitivity of the analysis, Neon was selected as the ion source with a kinetic energy of 5 keV, an ion flux of 400 pA⋅mm−2, and a spot size of 2 mm × 2 mm. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) were performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a ceramic reaction cell which allowed heating to 600 °C, and using CO as a probe. The reaction gas mixture consisted of 1% CO, 1% O2, 1 % N2, 40% H2, and 57% He, and the introducing flow rate was 50 ml·min−1. The catalysts were first pretreated at 300 °C in 20% O2/N2 for 1 h with a 10 oC·min−1 ramp, then cooled down to room temperature and purged with helium, and finally, the reaction gas was introduced. The experiments were carried out at RT after treating with reaction gas at 50, 100, and 250 °C for an hour, respectively. The surface under He was collected as a background spectrum. Then CO was dosed and the sample spectrum was collected. The CO adsorption spectrum is a difference of the sample spectrum in CO/He and the background spectrum in He."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test Catalyst performance was measured in a fixed bed reactor. 120 mg sample (40–60 mesh) was used for each test. The catalysts were pretreated with 20% O2/N2 at 300 °C or hydrogen at 150, 200, 250 °C respectively, for 1 h. The flow rate was controlled at 50 ml·min−1. The reaction gas consists of 1% CO, 1% O2, 1 % N2 (as an internal standard), 40% H2, and 57% He. The product was analyzed using an on-line GC equipped with a 5A molecular sieve packed column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using helium as the carrier. The CO conversion, O2 selectivity, and the rate of hydrogen oxidation were evaluated as follows: C O c o n v e r s i o n = C O i n - C O o u t C O i n × 100 % O 2 s e l e c t i v i t y = 0.5 ( [ C O ] i n - C O o u t ) [ O 2 ] i n - [ O 2 ] o u t × 100 % TOF = C × F / N Where [CO]in and [O2]in are the concentrations of CO and O2 in the reaction gas before reaction, [CO]out and [O2]out are those after reaction. The values were referred to the peak area of N2 by the relative correction factors between N2/CO and N2/O2. C stands for the conversion of H2 or CO. F is the molar flow rate of H2 or CO (mol/s). And N (mol) is the amount of copper in catalyst used."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization TEM image of the synthesized CeO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (a), which appears as a hexagonal shape with a size of about 20 nm. The interplanal spacings of about 0.31 nm, and the dihedral angle of about 70° were obtained from the HRTEM image in Fig. 1(b). The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) pattern of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is shown in Fig. 1(c). A commercial CeO2 sample with exposing {111} facets mainly was measured and compared in Fig. 1(d, e), which characteristic interplanal spacings is about 0.19 nm with a dihedral angle of about 60°. Moreover, the FFT pattern of SAED for the commercial CeO2 (Fig. 1(e)) is obviously different from that of the synthesized CeO2 (Fig. 1(c)). As compared to the reported FFT patterns of CeO2(110) [44] and CeO2(111) [45] (Fig. 1(f)), as well as the characteristic interplanal spacings and dihedral angles, it can be concluded that the synthesized CeO2 is exposed mainly {110} planes, consistent with the reported results used the similar synthesized method [43,46]. It is worth to mention, the interplanal distance of the {110} cannot be observed directly if the transmitted electrons are incident along the 〈110〉 direction, while the interplanal distances of {−111} (A1A7A4) and {1–11} (A6A7A4) planes can be obtained to be 0.313 nm and 0.315 nm, respectively (Fig. 1(g-j)), and the angle between {111} and {1–11} planes is 70.6°. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) exhibits the type IV isotherm plot. The type IV of the isotherm is a typical characterization of a mesoporous material (as shown in Fig. 2 (a)). The measured BET specific surface area is around 70 m2·g−1 for the CeO2(110) support, and without much change after loading 3 wt% CuO. The measured BET values are smaller than those of 80–120 m2/g reported previously [6], which could be due to the different particle sizes and morphology of CeO2. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2(b) show well crystalline CeO2. Two peaks at 2θ of 35.6° and 38.8° are found in XRD patterns as the loading of copper is higher than 5 wt%, which are characteristic diffraction peaks of CuO [47]. This means that copper oxide is well dispersed on the surface of CeO2(110) as the loading of copper is less than 5 wt%. No obvious CuO x clusters are observed in the TEM images for the low Cu loadings (Fig. 2(c,d)), consistent with the XRD results, and the morphology almost remains after reaction (Fig. 2(e)). These were also confirmed by EDX mappings of Cu and Ce (Fig. 2(f–h))."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic performances for the preferential oxidation of CO in H2 on the CuO/CeO2(110) catalysts with different copper loadings are shown in Fig. 2. CO conversion increases as the reaction temperature increases until achieving 100%, then decreases when further increasing the reaction temperature (Fig. 3 (a)). The decrease of the CO conversion at higher temperature should be due to the consumption of O2 for H2 oxidation, since the amount of O2 is limited. This could be understood more directly from the oxygen selectivity for CO oxidation which commences to decrease from 100% at a temperature higher than 100 °C (Fig. 3(b)). The catalytic activity increases significantly as loading Cu on CeO2(110), and achieves the best for a copper loading of 5 wt%. Further increasing the loading induces a slight decrease of the activity. Hydrogen oxidation initiates at about 100 °C for all the catalysts with different copper loadings, which also confirms a selectivity of 100% for CO below 100 °C. With such achievements, the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst was selected for further investigating."
8,Structure activity relationship,"3.3 Structure activity relationship The in-situ CO-DRIFTS (Fig. 4 ) was used to probe the surface copper species. Treating with pure H2 at 50 °C then introducing CO into the infrared in-situ reaction cell, a peak at 2116 cm−1 is observed, which could be assigned to the infrared absorption peak of COCu+ on the surface of catalyst [48–49]. When the temperature rises to 250 °C, a peak at 2090 cm−1 occurs, assigned to COCu0 species [50–51]. When treating with the reaction gas at different temperatures, a peak at 2116 cm−1 is observed and shifts from 2116 cm−1 to 2102 cm−1. The 2116 cm−1 peak could be assigned to COCu+, and the latter belongs to the surface defect sites of Cuδ+ [51]. Such observation indicates that CuO is reduced to Cu+ and Cu0. Then, quasi in-situ HS-LEIS and XPS were conducted to have a more comprehensive understanding of the dispersion and redox properties during the in-situ reaction processes. HS-LEIS can measure the composition of the topmost surface of a solid, possible of one surface atomic layer. The spectrum of the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst shows only Cu and Ce peaks (Fig. 5 (a)). Note that LEIS can only detect the surface element with a mass heavier than that of the incidence ion. Hence, oxygen can not be seen by using Ne+. The related ratio of Cu/Ce is used to represent the dispersion of copper species on the support surfaces. The LEIS spectra for the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst with different Ne+ etching time are displayed in Fig. 5(b). The initial Cu peak is apparent for the pre-oxidized catalyst. During the etching, the peak area of Cu drops sharply, which indicates that the CuO x species should be highly dispersed on the CeO2 surfaces. Note that the etching depth is estimated to be about 1 nm per twenty minutes giving by the Ne+ sputtering yield parameters from the instrument. The LEIS spectrum for the catalyst after treating with the reaction gas at 250 °C is very similar with that for the pre-oxidized one, as shown in Fig. 5(a), which indicate that the partial reduced copper species remains at a relative high dispersion. There is no obvious change of the XPS Ce 3d peaks up to 270 °C (Fig. 5(c)), indicating that the extent of the reduction of CeO2 is very little. By careful comparing the spectrum reduced at 270 °C and the one of pre-oxidation (the red dotted line), it can be seen slightly differences at the dashed line positions that corresponds to Ce3+ [52]. Such differences may be due to the presence of a very small amount of oxygen defects after reduction. XPS Cu 2p spectra for the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst treated in H2, CO and the reaction gas at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 6 . Both Cu LMM (AES) and Cu 2p features, especially the strong satellite peaks at ~ 942 eV [53], reveal Cu2+ being the main copper species for the catalyst treated in air at 300 °C. Upon exposing in H2 at 70 °C, Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+ as evidenced by the shift of the LMM peak from 917 eV to 915.5 eV, and the broaden and red-shift of the Cu 2p peak. Above 100 °C, part of the Cu+ is further reduced to Cu0, indicated by the shift of the LMM peak from 915.5 eV to 916.5 eV, and the Cu 2p3/2 peak from 933.8 eV to 932.4 eV. In contrast, the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by CO requires at least 50 °C higher than by H2, and could only partially be reduced to Cu0 even at 270 °C. These results are different from those reported for CuO x /Sm2O3 CeO2, where Cu2+ was proposed to be easier to be reduced to Cu0 by CO than by H2.[54] Such differences may be due to the different surface and interface structures, and different treating processes in the present XPS measurements and in regular TPR experiments [54]. However, treating the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst in the PROX reaction mixture at various temperatures (Fig. 6(c)) shows that the satellite peaks of Cu2+ weaken quickly, and become very weak at above 100 °C, accompanied by a significant shift of the Cu 2p3/2 from 933.8 eV to 932.4 eV. Moreover, the AES LMM features co-existing of Cu+ and Cu0 at the temperature range of 70–270 °C, which is also observed in DRIFT experiments (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that Cu+ species was stable under the PROX condition, and should be a key active site. After knowing the dynamic processes of the catalyst under the reaction condition, more detailed investigation of the catalytic performance of the 3 wt% CuO/CeO2(110) catalyst was conducted. For the pre-oxidized case, the 100% CO conversion occurs at about 110 °C during ramping up process, and still maintains 100% at 90 °C in the ramping down process, as seen in Fig. 7 (a, b). The activity curves of the temperature in the ramping up and down processes are not coincident, with the activity in the down process is obviously higher than that in the up process, while the selectivity in the cooling process is worse than that in the up process. Similar behaviors are observed for the catalyst pre-treated in H2 at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 7(c–d). Note that the activity only increases a little as increasing the pre-reducing temperature. Such comparisons reveal that Cu2+ or Cu0 is less active for CO oxidation, but existing Cu+ is more active. However, the selectivity for CO oxidation is lower initiated from the pre-reduced catalyst than the pre-oxidized one, suggesting that Cu0 is a more active site for H2 oxidation. The Arrhenius plots of H2 consumption rates for H2 oxidation and PROX, as well as for CO oxidation, are compared in Fig. 8 . Activation energies (Ea) of H2 oxidation for both in the PROX and hydrogen only are about 160 kJ·mol−1 at 110–120 °C, and the curves deviates obviously from the linear lines as the temperature further increases. It has been reported that the Cu2O/Cu interface can enhance H2 activation, leading to a higher H2 catalytic oxidation activity [55]. The above characterization results demonstrate that Cu2+ on the pre-oxidized catalysts is reduced to Cu+/Cu0, and Cu0 on the pre-reduced one is partially oxidized to Cu+/Cu0, under the PROX reaction condition. The obvious change of the activation energies for H2 oxidation in the Arrhenius plots should be resulted from the surface reconstruction forming different surface active sites. When the catalyst is treated with reaction gas at 250 °C, the activity for CO oxidation is greatly improved (Con. 100%, Sel. 99.8% at 90 °C). The overall performance, shown by a pink triangle in Fig. 7, is much better than those reported currently [16,56–61]. The temperature of 90 °C is critical for hydrogen fuel cell, since it is usually necessary to artificially introduce a certain amount of liquid water adhering to the proton exchange membrane to increase the conductivity of the battery. With such efficient catalysts, it can be directly coupled on the diffusion layer of the fuel cell, which not only reduces the volume of the entire device, but also directly generates water for the proton exchange membrane to increase the conductivity. Thus, this comes to a win–win situation. It is worth mentioning that the present preparation method of the catalysts is easy, and the yield of the CeO2(110) is quite high. Such high energy plane can increase the interaction between the copper species and ceria. Based on the above characterization results, the dispersion of the copper species on the outmost surface of the catalyst still remains at a relatively high percentage after the reaction gas treatment. However, the dispersion of copper species is different from that pre-oxidized by 20% O2/N2 at 300 °C. A majority of copper species on the surface of the catalysts is in a reduced state under the reaction condition. Both the XPS and IR results reveal that the amount of Cu+ significantly increases, consistent with those proposed in the literatures [62–64]. This is also benefit from the CeO2(110) surface, which has been found to bond copper species stronger than on the CeO2(111) surface.[65] The results demonstrate that the surface occurs a reconstruction, mainly from (Cu2+ O)Ce4+O2 or Cu0 n/Ce4+O2 to (Cu+ O)Ce4+O2, and lead to an increase in the interface between Cu+ and ceria under the reaction conditions, then consequently result in an improved activity for low temperature CO oxidation. Therefore, the active site of CO oxidation is considered to be the interface of (Cu+ O)Ce4+O2. Simultaneously, as the reaction temperature increases, the interface of (Cu0 Cu+ O)Ce4+O2 forms, which is more active for H2 oxidation than the (Cu+ O)Ce4+O2 does. The formation of (Cu0 Cu+ O)Ce4+O2 will suppress the oxidation of CO, but enhance the oxidation of H2, leading to a lower selectivity of CO oxidation. The activation energy required for hydrogen oxidation is relatively higher. The appearance of Cu+ Cu/CeO2 interface can be suppressed, as long as the surface reconstruction is controllably adjusted by controlling the reaction temperature. Thus, the consumption of hydrogen can be suppressed to a certain extent, which can not only minimize the impact of the discharging power of battery, but also maximize the use of hydrogen resource."
9,Conclusions,"A series of CuO x /CeO2(110) catalysts with Cu loadings of 1–13 wt% had been synthesized. The ceria support with predominantly high energy {110} plane effectively enhances the interaction between the CuO x clusters and ceria. The prepared CuO x /CeO2(110) catalysts possess a much higher performance for PROX, among which the 3 wt% one performed the best (Con. 100%, Sel. 99.8% at 90 °C). Depth profile using LEIS, as well as TEM and XRD, evidences that CuO x of the 3 wt% CuO x /CeO2(110) catalyst is highly dispersed on the surface with mainly two-dimensional clusters. Moreover, the activity is greatly improved after pre-treating with the reaction gas. Both XPS and CO-IR confirm existing mainly Cu+ under the reaction condition, regardless initiating from both the pre-oxidized and pre-reduced catalysts. While H2 reduction produces Cu0, which is easy to be oxidized to Cu+ as exposing to the CO/H2/O2/He mixture. The initiation of hydrogen oxidation starts at about 90 °C during PROX reaction, which concurrently appears with Cu0. Our results demonstrate that the efficient Cu based catalysts for PROX accounts for highly stable CeO2 supported Cu+ species."
