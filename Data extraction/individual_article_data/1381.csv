0,Introduction,"Ordered mesoporous materials are widely used as catalysts as well as supports, due to their uniform and well-ordered pore structures with high surface area [1–3]. The structure, composition, and pore size are easily controlled depending on the target catalytic applications. Nanocasting is a novel method to prepare mesoporous materials, in which the final morphologies of various transition metal oxides are determined by the internal pore structure of the template [4–6]. For example, when internal voids of the mesoporous silica SBA-15 with interconnected hexagonal pore structures are filled with cobalt nitrate precursor in solution, a replica Co3O4 with interconnected, hexagonally ordered wire-structures (p6mm) is generated by thermal anealing and subsequent removal of the silica mold [7,8]. When the template is changed to mesoporous silica KIT-6 with interconnected cubic pore structures, the Co3O4 replica with cubic pore structures (Ia3d) is produced instead. When the mesoporous oxides are further treated with hydrogen, reduced surfaces are provided with new species at different oxidation states [7,9]. Mesoporous cobalt oxides have been investigated as excellent catalysts for many reactions: oxidation of H2O, CH4, CO, and xylene [10–17]; oxygen evolution reaction [18–21]; desulfurization of H2S [22,23]; and hydrogenation of CO [24]. In a notable example, Gu et al. reported that ordered mesoporous CoO produced by H2 reduction of the mesoporous spinel Co3O4 exhibited unexpectedly high activity due to the presence of octahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in rock-salt CoO [13]. As a major product of biomass decomposition, furfural (FAL) requires further upgrading to produce more stable products such as gasoline/diesel pool or other useful chemicals [25–28]. To produce transportation fuels, there is a high demand for selective deoxygenation that preserves the CC bonds while breaking the CO bonds. From fundamental point of view, FAL hydrogenation has been widely exploited as a probe reaction, because of its distinct reaction pathways. FAL with both CC and CO double bonds is converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA), furan (FR), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methylfuran (MF), and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) over various novel metal catalysts, such as Pd, Ru, Cu, and their alloys with second transition metals [29–40]. The catalytic conversion and selectivity are strongly affected by the type of catalysts. Although many literatures reported effective catalysts for FAL hydrogenation, lowering the usage of precious metals and gaseous hydrogen is an important issue to be overcome for the commercialization of this process [31]. Here, we present highly ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide catalysts as strong candidates for noble metal-free catalytic FAL hydrogenation. Although the catalytic activity and selectivity are greatly changed by the surface environments, the active species on the surface of cobalt catalysts in the presence of mesoporous structures is still under investigation [41,42]. In this works, the impacts of the structure, porosity, and oxidation state of mesoporous cobalt oxides are investigated to identify catalytically active species for conversion of FAL hydrogenation. The surface structures and adsorption properties of these oxides after treatment in different reduction environments are clarified, by combining catalytic experiments with surface characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the mesoporous CoO catalyst with p6mm symmetry show the highest reaction rate among catalysts, the combined results demonstrate that CoO is a major active phase with a distinct product selectivity toward MF via selective hydrogenation of FAL to FA and subsequent hydrogenolysis to MF."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals used are reagent-grade. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98.0%), 1-butanol (anhydrous, 99.8%), poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) PEO20−PPO70−PEO20 (Pluronic P123), and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of SBA-15 and KIT-6 silicas Two types of mesoporous silicas, SBA-15 and KIT-6, are synthesized using TEOS as silica source and Pluronic P123 as a structure-directing agent [4–8,43–45]. For the synthesis of SBA-15, 16 g of Pluronic P123 is dissolved in 120 g of water and 480 g of 2 M HCl solution with stirring at 40 °C [43,44]. Then, 34 g of TEOS is added into that solution with stirring at 40 °C for 20 h. Afterwards, the mixture is aged at 80 °C overnight without stirring. The solid product is recovered, washed, and dried in an ambient environment. Calcination is carried out at 550 °C for 6 h. In the typical preparation of KIT-6, 27 g of P123 and 43.5 mL of concentrated HCl (37%) are dissolved in 980 mL of water in a polypropylene bottle, and 33.3 mL of n-butanol is added to the solution at 35 °C with vigorous stirring [45]. After 1 h, 58 g of TEOS is added to the solution, followed by stirring at this temperature for 24 h. The capped bottle is stored at 40 °C for another 24 h in an oven. The solid is filtered, dried at 90 °C overnight, and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. 2.2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous cobalt oxides Mesoporous cobalt oxides are prepared via the nanocasting approach using KIT-6 and SBA-15 [4–8]. Briefly, 24 mmol of cobalt nitrate is dissolved in 6 mL of deionized water. The cobalt precursor solution is mixed with 6 g of SBA-15 (or KIT-6) and 30 mL of toluene at 65 °C under stirring. Toluene is slowly evaporated and the remaining precipitate is dried at 60 °C overnight and then calcined at 300 °C for 5 h. The resulting solid is poured into 2 M aqueous NaOH solution and heated to 90 °C. The silica templates is dissolved into the NaOH solution, remaining a mesoporous Co3O4 (m-Co3O4) replica. After centrifugation and decanting the NaOH solution containing the silica residue, the purified m-Co3O4 is obtained. Washing of the m-Co3O4 is repeated with the NaOH solution and the final product is rinsed twice with water and dried at 50 °C. The catalyst samples prepared from SBA-15 and KIT-6 templates are termed m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d), respectively. The as-prepared m-Co3O4 is further reduced under H2 (4% H2 in Ar, flow rate = 100 mL‧min−1) at 350 or 500 °C for 1 h, and the obtained products are labelled as m-CoO(p6mm)-350, m-CoO(Ia3d)-350, m-Co(p6mm)-500, and m-Co(Ia3d)-500 according to the bulk crystal structure, space group, and reduction temperature."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of mesoporous cobalt oxide series are characterized by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method by nitrogen physisorption in a BEL SORP-max unit. Surface morphologies and structural information of the fresh and used catalysts are characterized by transmission election microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1400). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) using Cu Ka as radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is carried out on a K-alpha (ThermoFisher) system equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source. Temperature programmed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR) is carried out with an Auto ChemⅡ 2920 instrument (Micromeritics Instruments Co.). Prior to each TPR run, the catalyst is placed in a quartz reactor and pretreated in He flow at 30 mL min−1 and 100 °C for 30 min to purge any residual oxygen. After cooling the reactor to room temperature, the catalyst is then heated to 800 °C at a constant heating rate of 10 °C‧min−1 under 2% H2–He flow of 30 mL‧min−1. The hydrogen consumption is monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, Agilent 7820A). The amount of H2 consumed is determined by a series of CuO/SiO2 with different Cu loading as a reference. in situ powder XRD data are recorded on a SmartLab (Rigaku) X-ray diffractometer equipped with a D/teX Ultra 250 detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The samples are placed on a kanthal (FeCrAl) filament cavity, and then subjected to thermo-programmed reduction from 30 to 900 °C (heating rate of 5 °C‧min−1) under a flow of 4.0 vol.% H2 in Ar (30 mL‧min−1). At defined temperatures, the in situ diffractograms are recorded in the 2θ range from 10 to 80° with a step of 0.05° (step time of 2 s). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis is conducted at the beamline 6D of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in South Korea. The electron beam energy and current of the incident X-ray were 3.0 GeV and 300 mA, respectively. To filter the incident photon energy, a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator is used. The energy is detuned by 30% to remove high-order harmonics. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Co K-edge region are only obtained in transmission detection mode. Background removal and normalization of the XAS spectrum are done using IFEFFIT (Athena) software. For reference materials, Co3O4 and CoO are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99.99%) and metallic Co foil is used."
5,Catalytic FAL hydrogenation,"2.4 Catalytic FAL hydrogenation Catalytic reaction is carried out in a 100-mL stainless-steel high-pressure reactor (Parr 5500) containing 1 g of FAL (Acros, 99%), 5 mg of catalyst, and 20 mL of isopropanol (Aldrich, 99.5% anhydrous). The reactor is initially flushed and then pressurized with hydrogen to 20 bar. The reactor is heated to 180 °C and maintained for 5 h with stirring at 600 rpm. The liquid product is analyzed by a flame ionization detector equipped with a capillary column (DB-Wax, 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness) in gas chromatography (GC) [46]. The following program is repeated: hold at 50 °C at 3 min, heating to 50–100 °C at a rate of 10 °C‧min−1 and hold for 3 min, heating to 100–200 °C at a rate of 25 °C‧min−1 and hold for 3 min. To test the products, the following GC reference reagents are used: FA (Aldrich, 98%), THFA (Aldrich, 99%), FR (Aldrich, 99%), THF (Alfa Aesar, 99%), and MF (Aldrich, 99%). Cyclopentanol and FAL dimers are detected in small quantities as residual products. The product conversion and selectivity are calculated as follows: Conversion % = mol furfural consumed mol furfural fed × 100 Selectivity % = mol product forme mol furfural consumed × 100 The reaction rate of FAL hydrogenation is calculated by the mole of FAL converted per gram catalyst per hour. Three experiments are carried out for each catalyst and the mean value is presented together with the error bar."
6,Computational methods,"2.5 Computational methods All calculations are carried out in the framework of the spin-polarized DFT using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [47,48]. The exchange-correlation is considered by using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew‒Burke‒Ernzerhof (PBE). The cut-off energy for plane wave basis set is 400 eV. For all calculations, the (4 × 4) super-cell in the xy-direction is used for Co(111) and CoO(111) surfaces with four and seven atomic layers, respectively. The vacuum between slabs along the z-direction is set at a minimum of 12 Å to minimize interactions between the slabs and reduce the amount of calculation. The bottom two atomic layers of Co(111) and the bottom three atomic layers of CoO(111) are fixed to the corresponding bulk-optimized positions. The ionic positions and lattice parameters of all structures are relaxed until the force converges to below 0.01 eV‧Å−1. DFT plus Hubbard U method is used to address on-site Coulomb interaction [49]. Since the top Co layer in CoO(111) surface is abnormally reconstructed without U correction, the (DFT + U) method is necessary to obtain a normal structure for this surface. The U value is set to 3.5 eV for only Co atoms [46]. All calculations considered spin polarization. Co and CoO are set to ferromagnetic and type Ⅱ antiferromagnetic configurations, respectively [50]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural properties of mesoporous cobalt oxides,"3.1 Structural properties of mesoporous cobalt oxides Mesoporous cobalt oxides are prepared via the nanocasting approach using KIT-6 and SBA-15 [4–8]. The catalyst samples prepared from SBA-15 and KIT-6 templates are termed m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d), respectively. The XRD patterns and N2 adsorption-desorption curves of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) with different reduction temperatures are shown in Fig. 1 . Characteristic diffraction peaks of Co3O4 are clearly observed at 2θ = 19.0, 31.2, 38.5, 44.8, 59.3, and 65.2° in both m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) which correspond to (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) diffractions of spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS 42–1467), as shown in Fig. 1a and b. These results indicate that the cobalt precursor is converted completely into the crystalline spinel Co3O4 after calcination. After thermal reduction at 350 °C, the main peaks corresponding to rock salt CoO at 2θ = 36.5, 42.4, and 61.5° (JCPDS 78-0431) are observed for m-CoO(p6mm)-350 (Fig. 1a). In contrast, m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 in Fig. 1b shows not only crystalline CoO peaks but also peaks corresponding to metallic cobalt at 41.7, 44.7, 51.5, 47.5, and 75.9° (JCPDS 05-0727 and 15-0806). When the thermal reduction temperature is further increased to 500 °C, only characteristic Co peaks are clearly seen in both m-Co(p6mm)-500 and m-Co(Ia3d)-500, indicating that the Co3O4 is completely reduced to metallic Co. Low-angle XRD patterns of mesoporous cobalt oxide series as well as a silica template are also measured to confirm the ordered mesostructure (Fig. S1). The mesostructures of as-prepared cobalt oxides are characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. Fig. 1c and d show characteristic type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherms (IUPAC classification) [51,52]. The hysteresis curves demonstrate that the ordered mesoporous structure is maintained in all as-prepared catalysts, except the metallic Co after reduction at 500 °C which is consistent with the TEM observation (Fig. 2 ). The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the as-prepared catalysts are presented in Table 1 . The specific surface area of m-Co3O4(p6mm) (114 m2‧g−1) is higher than that of m-Co3O4(Ia3d) (69 m2‧g−1). Regardless of the pore structure, the surface area decreases at higher reduction temperatures. For instance, after thermal reduction at 350 °C, the surface areas of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 decrease to 73 and 48 m‧g−1, respectively. It is attributed to partial destruction of the mesostructure during the phase transformation from Co3O4 to CoO under H2 reduction conditions, which is also confirmed by XRD data as discussed above. After reduction at 500 °C, the surface area is further decreased to 7 m2‧g−1 for m-Co(p6mm)-500 and 3 m2‧g−1 for m-Co(Ia3d)-500, indicating that a significant portion of the pores have collapsed. The morphology of each cobalt oxide sample is characterized by TEM (Fig. 2). Highly ordered mesoporous Co3O4 structure is clearly observed in Fig. 2a, d, indicating that the original silica template determines the final structure of Co3O4 replicas. When SBA-15 with interconnected hexagonal pore structures is used as template, the Co3O4 replica also has interconnected, hexagonally ordered wire-structures (p6mm) (Fig. 2a). During the thermal reaction at 300 °C, the pores of mesoporous silicas are filled with cobalt precursors, resulting in crystalline Co3O4 replicas after removing the silica template. Likewise, when mesoporous silica KIT-6 with interconnected cubic pore structures is used, the Co3O4 replica with cubic pore structures (Ia3d) Co3O4 is obtained instead (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2b and e show that the original ordered mesoporous structures are still maintained after reduction at 350 °C, although the surface areas are decreased. However, this ordered mesostructure substantially collapses after reduction at 500 °C (Fig. 2c and f), which is in good agreement with the nitrogen adsorption analyses. Fig. 2g illustrates the overall preparation scheme through the nanocasting approach for the preparation of mesoporous Co3O4 and the CoO and Co catalysts, depending on the H2 reduction temperature and type of silica template. To further verify the crystalline phase in cobalt oxides after reduction at 350 and 500 °C, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are investigated (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3a and d show TEM images of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and m-CoO(Ia3d)-350, respectively. From the HR-TEM images in Fig. 3b and e, CoO is identified as the dominant crystalline phase with a distinct lattice spacing of 0.25 nm corresponding to the (111) plane. However, in m-CoO(Ia3d)-350, metallic Co is also found with a 0.22 nm lattice distance, corresponding to the Co (100) plane (Fig. 3e). The SAED patterns (Fig. 3c and f) indicate the existence of CoO in the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and both CoO and Co phases in the m-CoO(Ia3d)-350, in good agreement with XRD analysis. The HR-TEM images in Fig. S2 also confirm the presence of metallic Co with 0.22 nm of lattice spacing, corresponding to the Co (100) plane, as the main crystalline phase in both m-Co(p6mm)-500 and m-Co(Ia3d)-500 (Fig. S2b and S2d). However, the aggregated Co particles shown in Fig. S2b and d still contain a small fraction of CoO and Co3O4 phases, which are ascribed to the re-oxidation of surface metallic Co in air."
9,Chemical properties of mesoporous cobalt oxides,"3.2 Chemical properties of mesoporous cobalt oxides XPS analysis is carried out to investigate the surface composition and oxidation state of mesoporous cobalt oxides. Fig. 4 a and b show the Co 2p XPS spectra of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series reduced at different temperatures. The quantitative surface compositions in term of Co2+/Co3+ ratios are listed in Table 1. Without reduction, both m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) show the same portion of Co 2p3/2 peak at 779 eV and the broad Co 2p1/2 band at around 796 eV. After deconvolution, Co3+ and Co2+ are clearly identified at 779.4 and 781.0 eV, respectively, which correspond to the single Co3O4 in the literature (∼779.5 eV for Co3+ and ∼780.8 eV for Co2+) [53,54]. Two shake-up satellites (surface and bulk plasmon) of Co ions are also included, in addition to Co3+ and Co2+. The surface Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) are 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Upon reduction at 350 °C, there is a significant increase of Co2+ in m-CoO(p6mm)-350, while metallic Co (peak at 778.1 eV) as well as CoO are already formed in the m-CoO(Ia3d)-350. The surface Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 increased to 2.33 and 1.14, respectively. The relatively higher surface Co2+/Co3+ ratio of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 due to abundant CoO phases is also proven by XRD results. Even after reduction at 500 °C, representative Co3+ and Co2+ peaks still exist in addition to metallic Co in both m-Co(p6mm)-500 and m-Co(Ia3d)-500. It reveals that re-oxidation occurs on cobalt surface in air, which is consistent with HR-TEM results in Fig. S2. Based on these results, the m-Co3O4(p6mm) series exhibits higher structural durability and high tolerance against reduction than the m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series. While the high surface area of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 causes a dominant CoO phase after reduction at 350 °C, the m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 is further reduced after 350 °C to produce metallic Co due to its less robust structures. The behaviors of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series at different reduction temperatures are studied by H2-TPR (Fig. 4c and d). The reduction profile of mesoporous cobalt oxides is highly dependent on the grain size and crystallinity. Large particles of Co3O4 are usually reduced to metallic Co in a single step, while nanoparticles often undergo the two-step process of cubic spinel Co3O4 → rocksalt CoO → metallic Co (Co0) [24,55]. In Fig. 4c and d, mesoporous cobalt oxides start with a band in the range of 220 − 330 °C, which is ascribed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ (Co3O4 → CoO). The subsequent reduction shoulders in the temperature range of 330 − 700 °C represent the reduction of CoO to metallic Co. Additional strong bands at around 380 °C for m-Co3O4(p6mm) and 431 °C for m-Co3O4(Ia3d) originate from aggregated cobalt particles in the synthesized mesoporous Co3O4 [56]. The integrated band areas in these two regions agree with the calculated stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 (see Table S1). While the overall integrated areas indicate H2 consumption for the phase transformation, the m-Co3O4(p6mm) series need more H2 for the reduction, due to their higher structural durability than m-CoO(Ia3d). Moreover, the phase transition point of CoO to metallic Co in m-Co3O4(p6mm) during reduction is shifted toward much higher temperatures compared to the m-Co3O4(Ia3d), indicating that m-Co3O4(p6mm) is more resistant against reduction than m-Co3O4(Ia3d). Otherwise, m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 is more easily reduced than m-CoO(p6mm)-350 under the same reduction condition, which requires low H2 consumption in H2-TPR (Fig. 4c and d, Table S1). The integrated areas of H2 consumption as a function of temperature ranges are summarized in Table S1. The temperature-dependent reduction behaviors of mesoporous cobalt oxides are further validated by in situ XRD study (Fig. 5 ). XRD peaks of m-Co3O4(p6mm) (Fig. 5a) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) (Fig. 5b) are collected in a flow of 4.0 vol.% H2 in Ar (30 mL‧min−1) in the temperature ranges from 30 to 900 °C. In Fig. 5, the Co3O4 phase is observed in both samples until reduction at 350 °C, then the intensity of characteristic Co3O4 peaks decreases along with the appearance of the characteristic CoO phase. The intensity of CoO peak decreases progressively with the appearance of weak Co0 peak upon reduction at 550 °C. However, the CoO phase is completely reduced to metallic Co at above 600 °C in the m-Co3O4(Ia3d), while the m-Co3O4(p6mm) maintains the CoO phase up to 700 °C. It indicates that m-Co3O4(p6mm) is much more stable against reduction than m-Co3O4(Ia3d). To clarify the detailed atomic structure of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series at various reduction temperatures, XAS experiments were conducted. Fig. 6 presents the Co K-edge XANES spectra of m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series at different reduction temperatures. The reference spectra of Co3O4, CoO, and Co are also provided. Co K-edge XANES involves transitions from Co 1 s to Co 4p by having the mixed states with O 2p. These transitions are sensitive to the oxidation state of cobalt, and indicate the peak shift from CoO to Co3O4 with higher energy. To quantify the extent of cobalt reduction, the XANES spectrum is fitted with a linear combination of reference spectra (i.e., Co3O4, CoO, and Co) [57] and the results are presented in Fig. S3 and Table S2. According to the fitted data shown in Fig. 6, the Co in both m-Co(Ia3d)-500 and m-Co(p6mm)-500 is mostly in a metallic state (˜ 84%) with a small fraction of the CoO phase (˜16%), while m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) retain their original phase of spinel Co3O4 (˜100%). Interestingly, m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 and m-CoO(p6mm)-350 show a mixed phase of Co, CoO, and Co3O4. The results of the XANES study reveal that both m-Co3O4(p6mm) and m-Co3O4(Ia3d) are partially reduced at 350 °C and completely reduced at 500 °C, which is consistent with the XRD results. The overall characterization results, including XRD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR, XAS, and in situ XRD, demonstrate that m-CoO(p6mm)-350 has a dominant CoO phase while m-Co(p6mm)-500 contains metallic Co with a small portion of CoOx on the surfaces. In contrast, m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 possesses metallic Co as well as dominant CoO phase due to the significant reduction at 350 °C. In the case of m-Co(Ia3d)-500, the structure is fully reduced with very little remaining CoOx species."
10,Catalytic FAL hydrogenation reaction,"3.3 Catalytic FAL hydrogenation reaction Liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation reaction is carried out over the mesoporous cobalt oxides and their reduced catalysts. For the catalytic reaction, 1 g of FAL dissolved in isopropanol solvent in the presence of catalyst is pressurized by hydrogen gas (20 bar) at 180 °C for 1–5 h. The catalytic conversions, product yields and catalytic activities are shown in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table 2 . The conversion of FAL over the as-prepared m-Co3O4 remains very low (13–16%) with a low mass activity of 0.024 mol·h−1 g−1 (Entry 1 and 4). So, crystalline Co3O4 is not an efficient catalyst for FAL hydrogenation, in spite of its high surface area and well-ordered pore structures. With the knowledge that metallic Co would be a better catalyst than its oxides for hydrogenation reaction, the as-prepared m-Co3O4 is reduced under the flow of H2 (4% H2 in Ar) at 350 °C or 500 °C for 1 h, and CoO and Co phases are obtained as the respective major crystal structure, as discussed previously. Among the reduced catalysts, m-CoO samples reduced at 350 °C show higher catalytic activity than others (Fig. 7b). In particular, m-CoO(p6mm)-350 exhibits a higher conversion (41%) than m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 (33.6%). Its mass activity (0.51 mol‧h−1‧g−1, Entry 2) is 21 times higher than the original catalyst, m-Co3O4(p6mm), despite of the smaller surface area after the reduction. This value is also 1.6 times higher than m-CoO(Ia3d)-350 (0.314 mol‧h−1‧g−1, Entry 5). Further increase of the reduction temperature to 500 °C leads to a decreased activity, which is attributed to the seriously reduced surface area accompanied by the decreased CoO phase. We recall that the XPS results show that the overall surface Co2+/Co3+ molar ratios are much higher for the reduced catalysts derived from m-Co3O4(p6mm) than those from the m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series (see Table 1). These results demonstrate that the mesoporous structure is strongly affected by the reducibility of cobalt oxides, and the CoO species is more important than the specific surface area for the activity for FAL hydrogenation. The FAL conversion of the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 is also compared with supported cobalt catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation and reduction at 350 °C (Table S3). Co supported SBA-15 and activated carbon catalysts exhibit a conversion less than ˜20%. We investigated the reaction rate of supported cobalt catalysts in the literature for comparison. Audemar et al. carried out FAL hydrogenation over Co3O4/SBA-15 catalysts [42]. When Co3O4/SBA-15 was reduced by H2 at 150 °C, Co3O4 was reduced to CoO consistent with our result. They used an ethanol solvent and performed the reaction at 150 °C, but resulting reaction rates were lower than the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 catalyst. Similarly, Jiang et al. reported a nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials (CPNs) with supported Co nanoparticles (Co@CPNs) for catalytic FAL hydrogenation [38]. When preparing a series of Co/CPN and Co/C catalysts under different reaction conditions, the reaction rate of FAL hydrogenation was higher on Co/CPNs than Co/C. A comparison of reaction rate between mesoporous cobalt series and Co-supported catalysts is summarized in Table S3. Compared to the conventional Co-supported catalysts, the existing m-CoO(p6mm)-350 exhibits the highest reaction rate due to the abundant active species derived from the bulk mesoporous cobalt oxide. The influence of the catalyst loading on the product distribution is also investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 7c and summarized in Table S4. The FAL conversion over the unreduced m-Co3O4(p6mm) under pressurized hydrogen gas (20 bar) at 180 °C for 5 h shows very low activity (Fig. 7c). Overall, the cobalt-based catalysts produce FAL and MF via the hydrogenation as a major pathway, with less than 20% of FR produced via decarbonylation (Fig. 7a). When the amount of catalysts is increased, the total conversion over m-Co3O4(p6mm) also increases but without obvious selectivity change (FA and FR). On the contrary, the reduced catalysts of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and Co(p6mm)-500 not only exhibit very high activity upon increasing their loading but also high selectivity towards FA and MF (Fig. 7c). In particular, as the amount of catalyst is increased, a notable selectivity change toward MF is seen in only m-CoO(p6mm)-350 while maintaining 100% conversion. In our reaction conditions, FAL is converted to FA which is further transformed to MF with a small amount of THFA. In a previous study, Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation reaction showed high THFA selectivity, indicating that the produced FA was further converted to THFA instead of MF [46]. In contrast, here m-CoO(p6mm)-350 promotes FAL hydrogenolysis to produce mainly MF rather than THFA, together with a limited amount of FR. Nevertheless, the selectivity changes very little with increasing loading of m-Co(p6mm)-500 as the FAL conversion increases from 71 to 100% (Fig. 7c, right). Over m-Co(p6mm)-500, the major product is FA (50–65% yield) with FR and MF as secondary products (17–22%). These results prove that CoO promotes not only high FAL conversion but also distinct selectivity toward MF."
11,DFT calculations for the reaction pathway,"3.4 DFT calculations for the reaction pathway DFT calculations are carried out to understand the reaction mechanism as well as major surface species during the CoO- or Co-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation. Previous DFT studies on Pd showed that the flat configuration with the furan ring of FAL parallel to the Pd surface was the most stable type of adsorption [58]. On Cu, however, the most stable adsorption occurs when the molecular plane of FAL is perpendicular to the Cu surface in an “upright” configuration [59]. The configuration of adsorbed molecule on the catalyst surface affects the reaction activity and selectivity [60–62]. For example, when FAL is adsorbed perpendicularly on the Cu surface, selective production of FA is preferred with very low selectivity toward MF [59,60]. It is attributed to the inaccessibility of surface hydrogen atoms to the end group of FAL due to the perpendicular geometry. Since MF is one of the major products in the current study, the flat configuration, in which FAL is adsorbed via both the aromatic ring and aldehyde end group, is primarily considered. In Fig. 8 a–b, three different flat configurations of FAL adsorption on CoO(111) and Co(111) surfaces are suggested. The detailed properties of each one are shown in Fig. S4. Interestingly, although CoO(111) and Co(111) surfaces have the same Co configuration in the top outermost layer, the adsorption energy of FAL is more negative on CoO(111) than on Co(111) for all configurations, representing stronger adsorption of FAL on the former. The top Co2+ layer in CoO(111) accepts more electrons from the carbon atoms of FAL, resulting in stronger binding to the CoO(111) than the Co layer. Accordingly, the reaction probability of FAL on CoO(111) increases, which is consistent with the higher FAL conversion observed over m-CoO(p6mm)-350 than m-Co(p6mm)-500. To further understand the reaction pathways, we trace the selectivity as a function of reaction time over m-CoO(p6mm)-350. The catalytic results of FAL hydrogenation are depicted in Fig. 7d and summarized in Table S4. After 1 h, 75% of FAL is converted with 60% selectivity toward FA. After 3 h, FAL is completely converted while the selectivity for FA reaches the maximum value of 66%. It is confirmed that the first reaction intermediate on cobalt catalysts is FA. As the reaction proceeds, the selectivity toward MF and FR increases at the expense of FA (Fig. 7d). After 7 h, the selectivity of MF and FR further increases to 50 and 25%, respectively. The overall yield of THFA is very low (4% or less). Unlike the case of Pd, FAL is converted quickly to FA as a main intermediate over mesoporous cobalt or cobalt oxide catalysts, then FA is converted to MF via hydrogenolysis. A small yield of THFA indicates that there is only limited ring hydrogenation of FA to THFA over the cobalt series. Over the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 catalyst, there are two competitive reaction pathways for FAL hydrogenation: decarbonylation toward FR and aldehyde hydrogenation toward FA. The FA is further converted via either secondary hydrogenation to THFA or hydrogenolysis to MF (Fig. 7a). When abundant CoO sites are provided, selective hydrogenation of FAL to FA and the subsequent MF production are the main reaction route. The dissociation of H2 molecule is also calculated on two surfaces, CoO(111) and Co(111). Considering the bond lengths of HH in H2 and Co–Co in the outermost layer, there are three possible initial sites of H2 (ontop-ontop, bridge-bridge, and top-top; Fig. S5a). To compare the adsorption process of H2 on CoO(111) to Co(111), all three initial sites of H2 are considered in calculation with the same initial height (1.72 Å) on both surfaces. It is noteworthy that, for all H2 sites, H2 is adsorbed on Co(111) without HH dissociation with the reduced height (1.56 Å), whereas it is dissociated on CoO(111) except at the bridge-bridge initial position, and the produced H atoms are adsorbed on different fcc and hcp sites (Fig. S5b, c). The result suggests that unlike the Co(111) surface, the dissociative adsorption of H2 occurs spontaneously on CoO(111), and then H atoms easily migrate to FA molecules. Therefore, the collision frequency of H atom on CoO(111) is higher than on Co(111). These results is strongly related to the tendency of MF selectivity of the CoO(111). Considering the fact that hydrogenolysis of FA to MF occurs dominantly over CoO with high FAL conversion, we compare the adsorption of FA on CoO(111) and Co(111) surfaces, and the corresponding activation barrier of the conversion pathway from FA to MF. The conversion from FA to MF consists of two distinct steps: 1) detachment of 1OH group from FA (FAOH) and 2) attachment of H atom to CH2 at the end of the furan ring to form methyl group, CH3 [35]. The calculated results show that when a dissociated H atom (H*) approaches FAOH, it binds to CH2 without an activation barrier, and the C atom of CH2 is detached from metal surface (Figs. S6 and S7). Therefore, the first step (detachment of OH) is the rate determining step. According to the Arrhenius equation, k = Aexp[-E a/RT], the reaction rate is determined by the activation barrier (E a) and pre-exponential factor (A). Firstly, we focus on the bond length of COH in FA on either CoO or CO surface, since the bond length is correlated to bond strength and the propensity for bond breaking. The respective bond lengths of COH in FA adsorbed on Co (111) and CoO (111) are 1.409 and 1.414 Å (Fig. S5b, c), demonstrating that the OH group is more easily detached from FA on the CoO (111). As a result, the activation barrier for the first reaction step (detachment of the OH group) is lower on CoO (111) than on Co (111). Secondly, we consider the pre-exponential factor, which is proportional to the collision frequency and represents how often molecules collide to cause a reaction. Since the conversion from FA to MF occurs by hydrogenolysis of FA, the number of H* approaching FA at the surface becomes a key factor to determine the pre-exponential factor. The dissociation of H2 molecule and the collision frequency of H atom on CoO(111) are higher than on Co(111), and it can promote the conversion of FA to MF. Total energies of the adsorption systems with CoO(111) and Co(111) surfaces along with the reaction coordinate are calculated to identify how the conversion steps are stabilized by the intermediate. Fig. 8c shows three steps: the initial step adsorbed with FA (R1); the intermediate step adsorbed by dissociated FA, hydrogen, and hydroxyl species (R2); and the final step adsorbed by MF (R3). To compare the energy among the reaction steps, the adsorption components are set the same in all systems. The results indicate that both R2 and R3 are much more stabilized on CoO(111) than on Co(111). While R2 is stabilized by only −0.374 eV on Co (111), this value is as large as −1.888 eV on CoO(111). Although R3 is slightly unstable compared to R2 on both surfaces, CoO still makes R3 very stable by −1.473 eV, while Co stabilizes this step by only −0.076 eV compared to R1. It is concluded that CoO stabilizes both R2 and R3 compared to Co, due to the strong adsorption of terminal carbon and OH group on CoO(111) rather than on Co(111). This strong stabilization on CoO(111) compared to Co(111) further promotes the selective production of MF. In summary, distinct features of CoO(111) as compared to Co(111), the stronger binding energy of FAL, the longer COH bond length of FAL, and the higher dissociative adsorption of H2 molecules, lead to the selective production of MF with high activity."
12,Catalytic stability,"3.5 Catalytic stability The stability and recyclability of m-CoO(p6mm)-350 catalyst is tested by reusing the catalyst in more than 5 identical cycles of the reaction, as the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance. After each cycle, the catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, then washed with ethanol and dried in air at 100 °C for 2 h. Before the next run, hydrogen reduction is carried out. When the recycling test are carried out two different reaction conditions, the catalyst activity is not deteriorated by reuse several times (Fig. S8). We also carried out reusability tests with catalysts without H2 treatment. The fact that the reactivity of the re-used catalysts does not deteriorate several times shows that the H2 treatment is not critical, because sufficient hydrogen is supplied during the reaction. The TEM image (Fig. S9) reveals that both the spent m-CoO(p6mm)-350 and m-CoO (Ia3d)-350 catalysts maintain their original mesoporous structures. Although the activity is gradually decreased through the repeated reactions, the activity of the m-CoO(p6mm)-350 catalyst does not drop rapidly by maintaining the original morphology of the catalyst."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, we have prepared highly ordered mesoporous cobalt oxides through the nanocasting approach using silica templates with different pore structures (p6mm and la3d). Hydrogen treatment of the parent mesoporous cobalt oxides at 350 and 500 °C leads to the partial or complete reduction of Co3O4 to CoO or Co, and the formation of covered CoOx on Co by re-oxidation. These results are verified by in situ XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, XAS, and TEM analyses. In the liquid-phase hydrogenation of FAL, exceptionally high catalytic activity is achieved by m-CoO(p6mm)-350, because the mesoporous cobalt oxide reduced at 350 °C usually has higher activity than non-reduced catalysts and those reduced at 500 °C. As a result, compared with m-CoO(la3d)-350, m-CoO(p6mm)-350 exhibits higher FAL conversion and distinct selectivity toward MF. It is revealed that the m-Co3O4(p6mm) catalyst series also possesses higher structural durability and high tolerance against reduction than the m-Co3O4(Ia3d) series. The combined reaction and characterization results demonstrate that CoO is a major active phase for the FAL hydrogenation. DFT calculations further confirm that the stronger adsorption of FAL on CoO(111) than on Co(111) results in not only high FAL conversion but also distinct selectivity change toward MF. Because of the facile cleavage of C–OH bond of FA on CoO(111) compared to Co(111), the CoO sites can induce selective hydrogenation of FAL to FA and subsequent MF production. Considering the current trend to reduce the use of precious metals in catalysts, these mesoporous cobalt oxides can be a good candidate with low cost and high efficiency for biomass conversion, due to their high stability, recyclability, as well as outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity."
