0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promises an unprecedented class of liquid solar fuel and environmental-benign oxidant in a variety of chemical industries. The intriguing potential applications of H2O2 have motivated extensive efforts on pursuing efficient and inexpensive production of H2O2 [1–3]. The current synthesis of H2O2 at industrial scale is through energy-extensive anthraquinone oxidation/reduction process, which involves expensive palladium catalysts and generates substantial byproduct wastes [4]. Photocatalysis, which converts green solar energy into chemicals [5–8], is a promising and cost-effective route for synthesis of H2O2. In the past ~30 years, substantial efforts have aimed at achieving high-yield photocatalytic production of H2O2 [9–15], however, the efficiency is much less developed than that of other catalytic methods [16–20]. Water is commonly used as the raw material source for photocatalytic production of H2O2. In general, water is oxidized by photogenerated valence band hole, releasing free proton (Eq. (1)), and a two-electron reduction reaction (ORR) of O2 on conduction band produces H2O2 (Eq. (2)). (1) H 2 O + 2 h + → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + ( E = 1 . 23 V versus NHE ) (2) O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 O 2 ( E = 0 . 68 V versus NHE ) Much efforts have been devoted to improve the catalytic performance of water dominant system because of its practical significance under the principle of green process. In various catalytic reactions, water has been found to play critical roles like activating reactants [21] and protons transferring intermediates [22], however, the role of water in the catalytic reaction of H2O2 production is often neglected except for serving as the raw material. Sacrificial reagents such as alcohol, which is thermodynamically more oxidizable than water, are often added into the reaction environment to enhance the performance of this photocatalysis reaction [10,11,23–25]. Such molecular agents can be a proton resource and undoubtedly to boost the photocatalytic generation of H2O2. However, from a fundamental point, both water and alcohol contain protons, so the proton source [11,26] of photocatalytic generation of H2O2 involving with two protons is actually unclear. Besides, weak interactions like hydrogen-bonding effects between alcohol and water or other hydroxyl-like species may complicate the reaction of reduction of O2 to H2O2. Therefore, the ambiguous effects of water and alcohol in the photocatalytic production of H2O2 significantly limit our understanding and thus restrict further development of this field [27]. Semiconductor materials, such as TiO2 and BiVO4, have been extensively studied as catalysts on photocatalytic H2O2 generation [10,11,28–30]. However, the wide bandgap of TiO2 and BiVO4 limits their light absorption in a narrow region of the solar spectrum and the low capacity of H2O2 generation hinders its further application [9,30–32]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free polymeric semiconductor, which has recently attracted widespread attentions due to its earth-abundant material source, facile synthesis and excellent photocatalytic activity [13,33–36]. To promote the photocatalytic H2O2 production, various strategies such as introduction of defects [37–39], doping with hetero-atoms [25,40] and sensitization with other semiconductors [6,41–43] have been developed. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of this promising carbon material catalyst still lags far behind state-of-the-art catalysts [16,17,19,44,45]. Therefore, except for the improvement of catalyst, the role of water and alcohol played in this carbon nitride photocatalytic system need to be revealed for further development. In this work, we demonstrate trace water can drastically boost high-efficiency photocatalytic production of H2O2 using alkali-assisted C3N4 as photocatalyst in water/alcohol mixtures. By electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, the radical species generated during the photocatalytic process of H2O2 in the realistic heterogeneous conditions are identified. We find that in pure ethanol reaction conditions, O2 is mainly reduced to · OOH radical and possibly stabilized by ethanol through hydrogen bond, in which situation only minor H2O2 could be detected. When trace water is introduced into the reaction, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is triggered by water via providing and transferring indispensable free protons to completely consume · OOH radical and a record high H2O2 concentration of 113 mmol L−1 is achieved, which greatly exceeds those of the photocatalytic H2O2 production reported in literatures [6,11,37,39–42]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine (99%), Potassium hydroxide (95%), Potassium chloride (99.5%), Titanium potassium oxalate (AR) were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd and used without further treatment. Ethanol (superdry, water < 50 ppm) was bought from Meryer Co., Ltd. Deionized water was prepared by HHitch laboratory water purification system. Hydrogen peroxide (30 wt%) was bought from Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts Alkali-assisted C3N4 (a-C3N4) was synthesized by following procedure: 1.5 g of melamine, 0.4 g of potassium hydroxide and 6 g of potassium chloride were firstly grinded together, then the mixed powder was put into crucible with a cap and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.2 °C min−1. After heating process, the product was grinded into powder and treated with 1 L of deionized water for 3 h under ultrasound. Then the product was filtered and washed with deionized water for 5 times and dried at 60 °C in vacuum for further test. g-C3N4 was prepared according to the method reported in previous literatures [36,46]. 1.5 g of melamine was put into crucible with a cap and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.2 °C min−1. After heating process, the result product was grinded into powder. The purification process was the same as that of a-C3N4."
4,Characterization of photocatalysts,2.3 Characterization of photocatalysts Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S4700 scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai G2F30S-Twin transmission electron microscopy at 300 kV by drop casting the sample dispersions on carbon-coated Cu grids. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out on a Panalytical X-pert prousing diffractometer operating at 40 kV/40 mA using the Cu Kα line (λ = 1.5418 Å). FTIR spectra were recorded on Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS 50. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi. Diffuse reflectance UV/visible absorption spectra were obtained on a Cary Series UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The reference material of BaSO4 was used before the measurement. Photoluminescence spectra of the samples were measured by Edinburgh Instruments FLS9800 spectrophotometer.
5,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2O2 production The photocatalytic activity test was carried out in a top-irradiation reaction quartz vessel. 50 mg of catalyst dispersed in a mixture of deionized water and ethanol with a total volume of 100 mL. The mixture was firstly sonicated for 10 minutes, then it was exposed to visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) with a 300 W Xe lamp (Perfectlight PLS-SXE300D) under continuous O2 bubbling (10 mL min−1). For comparison of the effects of types of alcohol, 50 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of deionized water and different kinds of alcohol (methanol, ethanal, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, phenyl alcohol) with a 1:1 volume ratio of 100 mL total volume. Other process was the same as described above. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the photocatalyst was estimated using N ( H 2 O 2 ) = n ( H 2 O 2 ) × ( 6.022 × 10 23 ) AQY = 2 N ( H 2 O 2 ) Number of incident photons × 100 % Details about calculating number of incident photons lists in Supporting information."
6,Quantification of H2O2 concentration,"2.5 Quantification of H2O2 concentration The concentration of H2O2 was monitored by colorimetric method. Typically, during the photocatalytic reaction, 1 mL of the suspension was taken from the reactor at a given interval. Then the suspension was centrifuged to remove the catalyst. After that, 0.5 mL of the centrifuged solution was taken out and mixed with 2.5 mL of deionized water and 2 mL of titanium potassium oxalate solution (0.05 mol L−1). The concentration of H2O2 was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 400 nm on UV-vis spectra (SP-752PC Shanghai Spectrum). The H2O2 concentration was achieved by comparing the absorbance with the calibration curve (Fig. S1). For the samples containing high concentration of H2O2 (>10 mmol L−1), the samples were first diluted to less than 10 mmol L−1 with deionized water before measuring."
7,Electrochemical analysis,"2.6 Electrochemical analysis 50 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 400 μL of acetone and 100 μL of deionized water and sonicated for 1 h. Then the suspension was spined coating onto FTO glass at 100 °C. The photocurrent and Mott-Schottky plots were measured by the CHI 760D (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) electrochemical workstation at room temperature."
8,Electron paramagnetic resonance measurement,"2.7 Electron paramagnetic resonance measurement The EPR spectra were analyzed by Bruker cw-EPR spectrometer (A300) with g value obtained by following equation: g = 0.07145 × γ(MHz)/H(mT), where γ is the microwave frequency and H is the resonance magnetic field strength during measurement. Radicals were detected by EPR spin-trapping technique coupled with 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trap molecule. Generally, 0.1 mL reaction solution was adopted after 1 h irradiation and filtered to remove the catalyst, then the solution was mixed with 0.2 mL DMPO solution immediately. After shaking for 1 min, the mixture was injected into a capillary and tested at room temperature. The least-squares fittings of EPR spectra were performed using Easyspin [47] 5.2 with the garlic function [48]. The simulation parameters used for analysis are listed in the Table S1."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Structure properties of catalysts,"3.1 Structure properties of catalysts A modified graphitic carbon nitride with alkali assistance is used as photocatalyst in this work. The synthetic scheme of alkali-assisted C3N4 consists of two consecutive stages (Fig. 1 a). KOH and KCl with the molar ratio of 0.09:1 are introduced in the one-spot thermal polycondensation of melamine. After heating 4 h at 550 °C under the N2 flow, a yellow powder is generated after further purification and grind [36,46,49]. For simplicity, this alkali-assisted C3N4 sample is referred as a-C3N4. The a-C3N4 exhibits the same phase as g-C3N4 in the XRD pattern but with the intensity of (002) peak weakened and (100) peak disappeared, indicating smaller stacking distance and the incorporation of K ion among the tightly interlayer [36,50] (Fig. 1b and Fig. S2). The Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms the distribution of K ion within the a-C3N4 structure (Fig. S3). The modifications by KOH and KCl also decrease the terminal -NH2 group of pristine g-C3N4 and introduce new cyano groups [36,50] , which is evidenced by the FTIR measurements (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4). The surface states and compositions of a-C3N4 are further analyzed by XPS measurements (Fig. 1d, e). The obviously enhanced peak at 286.8 eV in C 1s spectra and shift of peak around 399.2 eV in N 1s spectra of a-C3N4 could be regarded as additional evidences of formation of cyano groups. Furthermore, the atomic ratios of N:C of a-C3N4 decrease compared to pristine g-C3N4 revealed by both XPS and elemental analysis (Table S2), indicating nitrogen vacancies are formed by alkali modification. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy reveals that both pristine g-C3N4 and a-C3N4 possess sheet like structures (Fig. S5)."
11,Performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production in different reaction conditions,"3.2 Performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production in different reaction conditions Alcohols are widespread used as sacrificial reagents in photocatalytic for H2O2 production [10,11,25]. Herein, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is performed in water/ethanol mixtures containing a-C3N4 as catalyst under continuous O2 bubbling at room temperature. 50 mg a-C3N4 catalyst is dispersed in water and ethanol solvent with respective molar ratio and the total volume of solvent is kept at 100 mL. Fig. 2 a demonstrates the concentration of H2O2 generated within 12 h reaction under different molar ratio of water. The variation tendency of H2O2 formed displays a volcanic curve within a wide window. The H2O2 concentration is firstly improved with the increasing molar ratio of water, then it reaches the plateau when water and ethanol are at almost equivalent states. After that, the amounts of H2O2 gradually decreases with further increase of water proportion (Fig. 2a). In pure water condition, the amount of H2O2 formed decreases to about 2.3 mmol L−1 (Fig. 2b), which is consistent with the values of literatures [6,12,14,51]. By optimizing the molar ratio of water in mixture solvents, the maximum concentration of H2O2 produced within 12 h reaction reaches to 60.5 mmol L−1, which is more than 60 times higher than that in pure ethanol condition, in which only ~0.9 mmol L−1 of H2O2 is generated. (Fig. 2b). In the initial stage of water ratio increase (blue dashed circle in Fig. 2a), when trace amount of water is added at molar ratio from 0.25% to 2.5%, the concentration of H2O2 formed in 12 h reaction is higher than that in only ethanol condition within the same reaction time (Fig. 2c). The results above suggest that trace water could trigger high efficiency photocatalytic H2O2 production. To validate the role of water mentioned above, a control experiment, i.e., addition of water into the reaction solution after photocatalytic reaction for 8 h with only ethanol as solvent at continuous O2 bubbling, is conducted (Fig. 2d). The H2O2 generation rate is 0.10 mmol L−1 h−1 with H2O2 concentration value of 0.8 mmol L−1 after initial 8 h reaction, then the rate rises to 8.0 mmol L−1 h−1 with almost 40 times higher of H2O2 concentration after next 4 h reaction once adding equivalent volume of water into the solution (Fig. 2d). On the other hand, when in the initial stage of ethanol ratio increase (Fig. S6), minor ethanol at ratio of 2.0% could enhance the photocatalytic performance of H2O2 production with an increase of 7~8 times than in pure water conditions (Fig. S6). Thus, it is safe to conclude that trace water could trigger and extremely boost high-efficiency photocatalytic production of H2O2."
12,EPR measurements of the reaction solutions,"3.3 EPR measurements of the reaction solutions For a deeper understanding, EPR measurements of the reaction solutions are conducted to classify roles of each components played in photocatalytic H2O2 reaction. Fig. 3 shows the possible radicals generated in different reaction conditions. In the reactions of best performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production, i.e., a mixture solution of water and ethanol containing a-C3N4 at O2 atmosphere, hydroxyl radical ( · OH ) and two types of ethanol-derived radicals— CH 3 C · HOH and CH 3 CO · —are detected (Fig. 3a and Table 1 ). The observed hydroxyl radical should originate from the reduction of H2O2 by conduction band of a-C3N4 (Eq. (3)) [52–55]. The CH 3 C · HOH radical is the inevitable intermediate when ethanol reacts with a hole (Eq. (4)) and finally converts to CH 3 CHO (Fig. S7), which could further react with a hole to form CH 3 CO · species [56]. Besides, the reaction of CH3CHO and the in-situ generated H2O2 could also contribute to the formation of CH 3 CO · species [57]. Acetaldehyde is the main product from alcohol and acetic acid is minor product. The accumulated acetaldehyde and acetic acid are quantified by Gas Chromatography. (Fig. S8). Quantitative detection results show the concentration of H2O2 was about 15% lower than the corresponding amounts of acetaldehyde and acetic acid, which could be attributed to H2O formation and the decomposition of H2O2. (3) H 2 O 2 + e - → · OH + OH - (4) CH 3 CH 2 OH + h + → CH 3 CH · OH + H + (5) O 2 + H + + e - → · OOH (6) · OOH + H + + e - → H 2 O 2 Hydroperoxyl radical ( · OOH ) is an essential radical species from one-electron reduction of O2 with one proton (Eq. (5)) for photocatalytic H2O2 formation [59] (Eq. (6)). However, in the established reaction conditions, · OOH radical could not be distinguished from the signals despite the high yields of H2O2 formation. This means the · OOH radical is probably exhausted rapidly once generated in solutions (details see below). When only water is used as the solvent, only · OH radical exists in the reaction solution and · O O H radical species is also not distinguished (Fig. 3b and Table 1). While in the reaction of using only ethanol as sole solvent, in which minor amount of H2O2 is generated, a great proportion of · O O H radical as well as other three types of radicals mentioned above are detected (Fig. 3c and Table 1). Although · O O H radical could be formed through one-electron reduction of O2 with one proton generated from (Eqs. (5) and (6)). However, bare H2O2 production in only ethanol condition means that further reaction of · O O H radical with another proton is inhibited (Eq. (6)). According to general chemistry knowledge, ethanol possesses extremely low ionization constant (10^−16) compared to that of water (10^−7), thus the transfer of protons in pure ethanol condition is prevented, which means that almost no free protons exist and could be transferred in the solutions for reaction with · OOH radical to generate H2O2. When water is involved in the reaction conditions (Fig. 3a, b), · OOH radical could be consumed with protons either transferred or ionized by water and finally converts to H2O2. To verify this assumption, the radicals in the control experiment are detected by EPR measurements. When adding water with a molar ratio of only 0.25%, the percentage of · OOH radical decrease to 29% compared to 50% in pure alcohol condition (Fig. S9 and Table S3). Meanwhile other radical signals are much similar to that of water/ethanol mixtures system. Further addition of water continuously reduces the percentage of · OOH radical until the · OOH radical disappeared at equivalent molar ratio of water (Fig. S10 and Table S4). This means that in the photocatalytic H2O2 generation reaction, water plays a vital role as a proton source and trace amounts of water is essential to trigger this reaction. On the other hand, although alcohol is a commonly used hole mediator, the less suited ionization constant makes it should be less consumed excessively. Considering graphitic carbon nitride could catalyze production of H2O through four-electron reduction of O2, it is inevitable to generate water molecule during the progress of reaction [37]. Therefore, even in only ethanol condition, H2O2 could still be produced but in a limited concentration. The relatively small percentage of · OH radical existed in pure ethanol solvent environment may result from decomposotion of H2O2 generated in the reaction [60]. The above results suggest that water and alcohol are the key parameters for achieving high-efficiency photosynthesis of H2O2, and oxygen is another crucial factor serving as oxidant. We carry out photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment with different atmosphere, i.e., O2, air and argon (Fig. S11). The H2O2 production decreased with oxygen supply decreased, and almost no H2O2 produced with no oxygen supply, i.e., in Ar condition. In the reaction conditions of water and ethanol mixture containing a-C3N4 under N2 atmosphere, i.e., without O2 bubbling, all four types of radicals mentioned above are detected (Fig. 3d and Table 1). Graphitic carbon nitride is a well-known promising catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting. So the oxidant source for generation of · OOH radical and H2O2 under the oxygen-free condition should come from the O2 derived sunlight-driven water splitting by a-C3N4. However, because of the low efficiency of overall water splitting and the existence of other half reaction—hydrogen evolution—under the established conditions, there is not sufficient O2 and protons for further generation of H2O2, leading to only ~0.3 mmol L−1 of H2O2 generation (Fig. 2b). We carry out experiments on the influence of radical scavenger agents to further verify the above results (Fig. S12). After adding 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl serving as ·O2 − scavenger in the reaction system, the H2O2 production did not decrease. This result indicates that there was no ·O2 − radical detected in our system. We choose the commonly-used AgNO3 as electron scavenger [18], sodium oxalate for hole scavenge and furfuryl alcohol for OH scavenger in photocatalytic H2O2 production. The addition of AgNO3 for electron scavenge totally prohibit the photocatalytic H2O2 production reaction. While the addition of furfuryl alcohol or sodium oxalate did not affect the photocatalytic H2O2 production obviously."
13,Improvement of charge separation,"3.4 Improvement of charge separation Except for the essential effects of water on high-efficiency photocatalysis of H2O2, the optical and electronic properties of a-C3N4 are also expected to influence the charge separation efficiency, which would contribute to photocatalytic production of H2O2. Fig. S13 displays the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and calculated band gaps of pristine g-C3N4 and a-C3N4. The a-C3N4 retains the spectra profile and has a similar narrow bandgap of 2.75 eV compared with pristine g-C3N4 (2.77 eV), which shows absorption in the visible-light region. Mott-Schottky plots of a-C3N4 reveal typical n-type character, as in the case for pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. S14). The valence band maximum calculated from XPS spectra is almost the same for both pristine g-C3N4 and a-C3N4 (≈2.09 eV). The contact potential difference between analyzer and the samples is estimated to be 1.85 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The same VB positions for pristine g-C3N4 and a-C3N4 mean that they could offer equal sufficient energy overpotential for water/alcohol oxidization [12,24] (Fig. S13). Thus the improvement of photocatalytic H2O2 production efficiency for a-C3N4 compared to pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 4 a) should come from better separation of photoexcited charge carriers of a-C3N4, which is the key challenge for photocatalytic performance [36,61]. In previous reports, modification of pristine g-C3N4 with alkali has been proved to be highly beneficial for the separation photoexcited charge carriers [36,46], which could be attributed to K atoms doping into the C3N4 interlayer and the structure change during modification [62]. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, a-C3N4 shows a much quenched PL emission compared to g-C3N4, indicating suppressed radiative recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pair. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy is further conducted to further confirm the charge carrier separation efficiency (Fig. 4b, inset). The transient PL decay curves of g-C3N4 and a-C3N4 can both be fitted by biexponential function. The longer lifetime of excited state a-C3N4 than g-C3N4 highlights the improved photoexcited charge carriers separation. In the results of transient photocurrent measurements, the current response of a-C3N4 is evidently higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, indicating enhanced mobility of charge carriers over a-C3N4 (Fig. 4c). Though the photoexcited charge separation efficiency is not as high as the photocatalytic performance, other factor, such as selectivity will also contribute to the high photocatalytic performance (Fig. S15). Furthermore, compared to pristine g-C3N4, the enhanced intensity of Lorentzian line of a-C3N4 revealed by EPR spectra demonstrates a higher concentration of the delocalized electrons on carbon atoms in the aromatic rings of a-C3N4 (Fig. 4d), which could facilitate the photo-generation of active radical species [63]. Previously, Fan Dong et.al. [55,62] have reported that K atoms, intercalated into the g-C3N4 interlayer via bridging the layers, could decrease the electronic localization and extend the π conjugated system enhancing the accumulation of the localized electrons and promoting the production of active radicals and oxidation capability. Overall, the high visible-light response, accelerated separation and transport kinetics of photoexcited charge carriers of a-C3N4 would be highly desirable for efficient photocatalytic activities of H2O2 production. The apparent quantum yield is estimated to be 15.6% indicating the excellent photoactivity. With optimization of amounts of catalyst and prolonged reaction time, the maximum concentration of H2O2 using a-C3N4 in water/ethanol mixture solvents reaches a record-high value of ~113 mmol L−1, which is nearly 50 times higher than using pristine g-C3N4 as catalyst under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 4a and Fig. S16). The performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production in this work is superior to those with other various photocatalysts reported in literatures (Table S5). The outstanding performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production indicates the critical role of water played in the photocatalytic H2O2 generation reaction. A proposed mechanism of photocatalytic production of H2O2 using a-C3N4 as catalyst under different solvent conditions is presented (Fig. 5 ). In the reaction system without water, ethanol prefers to react with hole to form ethanol-derived radicals and release a proton. On the conduction band, oxygen reacts with protons under excited conditions to form · OOH species. Due to low ionization constant of ethanol, almost no free protons exist in the solutions for further reaction with · OOH radical. Thus · OOH radical is probably stabilized by ethanol molecules through hydrogen bond and form a cage-analogous structure with · OOH radical locating in the center while hydrocarbon chain of ethanol coating outside. In this situation, the reaction of · OOH radical generation reaches equilibrium and merely H2O2 is generated. When trace water is introduced into this reaction, free protons could be provided and transferred in the solution due to the high ionization constant of water. Then · OOH radical would be consumed by the protons transferred by water to form H2O2. Once · OOH radical is consumed, the reaction balance of · OOH radical generation from alcohol is broken. Thus · OOH radical could be supplied by alcohol continuously to serve as a reservoir for high-efficiency production of H2O2. In this system, the role of water is to provide and transfer indispensable free protons to react with · OOH radical for photocatalytic generation of H2O2, while ethanol is to provide protons for generation of · OOH radical because of its more thermodynamically oxidization. In this respect, other types of alcohol could also have a similar effect as ethanol does (Fig. S17). The synergistic effects of trace water and ethanol contribute to the best performance of photocatalytic H2O2 production in the established conditions."
14,Conclusion,"Our work demonstrates trace water could trigger and lead to substantial improvement in the photocatalytic generation of H2O2 with alkali-assisted C3N4 as photocatalyst in water/alcohol mixture solvents and a record-high concentration of 113 mmol L−1 is achieved. Mechanism of photocatalytic production of H2O2 using a-C3N4 is proposed by identifying the radical species generated during the photocatalytic process of H2O2 in the realistic heterogeneous conditions. In only ethanol reaction environment, O2 is reduced to · OOH radical, which is possibly stabilized by ethanol through hydrogen bond and only minor H2O2 could be generated. When trace water is introduced into the reaction system, water could trigger photocatalytic production of H2O2 via providing and transferring indispensable free protons to completely consume · OOH radical. This implies that the enhancement of H2O2 generation relies on much better protons transfer by water and efficient further reactions with · OOH radical. At present, H2O2 has received great interests as an environmentally friendly oxidant and a new liquid solar fuel. Thus, the mechanism demonstrated in our work should inspire development of high efficiency catalytic production of H2O2 based on other useful catalysts and methods."
