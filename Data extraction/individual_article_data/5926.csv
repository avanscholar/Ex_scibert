0,Introduction,"Biodiesel has the potential to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and the dependence on foreign fuels; however, it still struggles to become competitive with fossil diesel fuels regarding the cost-effectiveness. The main reason for this is the high cost of refined vegetable oils currently used for the biodiesel production [1–3]. Conventional base catalytic processes used for biodiesel production cannot make use of feedstock with the presence of high amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water. These impurities react with catalysts and lead to side formation of soaps which reduce the yields and make the separation of biodiesel from glycerol difficult [4–6]. Therefore, not more than 0.5wt% FFAs and 0.06wt% water are allowed in feedstock in order to ensure high yields [7]. Processes with acid catalysts have higher tolerance to the level of FFAs in the feedstock, but they require very long reaction time to achieve high yields, and the feedstock oil and alcohol must be essentially anhydrous [8]. Transesterification in supercritical alcohol was investigated as an alternative to conventional biodiesel production methods [9–14]. Transesterification in supercritical alcohol is a reaction without the presence of a catalyst in the process. In this method the temperature and pressure of the reactants reach up to the critical temperature and pressure of the alcohol. In these conditions the dielectric constants of alcohols are significantly lower, and they approach the dielectric constants of non-polar substances such as fats and oils. This creates a predisposition to a single-phase system of oil and alcohol. In addition, ionic product of alcohol increases with increased pressure, thus it is assumed that alcohol in supercritical conditions is not only a reactant but also an acidic catalyst [15–17]. These characteristics of transesterification in supercritical conditions make it possible to use oils with high FFA content (up to 36wt%) at high conversion and reaction rates. Other advantages are good tolerance to water in feeds (up to 30wt%), without reducing yields and reaction rates [16], and simpler separation and purification steps of biodiesel due to absence of catalyst in the process [18]. There are many investigations on the supercritical transesterification process concerning reactivity and kinetics [3,19–22]. Besides technical aspects, economic feasibility is also of great importance for assessment of process viability. Economic feasibility of biodiesel production in supercritical conditions has been evaluated by several authors with varying results and often contradictory conclusions [23–25]. Marchetti et al. [24] claim that supercritical transesterification is not cost competitive due to relatively high investments and consumptions of energy and alcohol, whereas others argue that it can compete with the existing alkali and acid catalyzed homogenous processes [24,25]. These investigations have focused on transesterification in supercritical methanol and there is no research, to our knowledge, which compared the effects of different reaction conditions and different types of alcohol on the economic performance of the process. Furthermore, these estimations are mainly based on information obtained from a process simulator, which do not necessarily coincide with empirical results. The choice of alcohol would not just influence the performance of reaction, but the fuel properties as well. Several researchers have shown that usage of 1-propanol instead of methanol in the transesterification process can significantly lower the pour point and cold filter plugging point of biodiesel [26,27] and improve its performance in the winter period. The present work focuses on an economic evaluation of transesterification of rapeseed oil in supercritical alcohols (methanol, ethanol and propanol) using the experimental setups with batch regime. The effects of temperature, pressure, reaction time and type of alcohol on biodiesel yields and production costs were investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw material characterization,"2.1 Raw material characterization Cold-pressed oil of a Serbian oilseed rape (the Kata variety) was applied in the experiment. Kata is a winter oilseed rape from the “00” maturity group (low erucic acid and glucosinolates) which makes the oilcake suitable as animal feed. This is the first genotype of oilseed rape with high oleic acid content in oil in Serbia. Physical and chemical properties of the obtained oil are given in Table 1 . During the experiments, three different alcohols (methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol) were used. Characteristics of the used alcohols are given in Table 2 ."
3,Equipment and experimental procedure,"2.2 Equipment and experimental procedure Transesterification of rapeseed oil in different alcohols was carried out in a batch reactor (Anton Parr 4520). The reactor had a volume of 2dm3, with the possibility of mixing the oil and alcohol with an anchor stirrer. The reactor was also equipped with an electric heater, which allows heating the mass up to 350°C, Fig. 1 . Rapeseed oil was mixed in the reactor with alcohol (methanol, ethanol or 1-propanol) in a molar ratio of 1:42 and heated to temperatures of 250, 300 and 350°C. Previous researches suggest that in supercritical conditions maximum yields are reached at around 1:42 oil to alcohol molar ratio [12,20]. After reaching the desired temperature of the oil and alcohol mixture (within ±2°C), the reactor was flushed with nitrogen (99.8% purity, Messer) at constant pressure of 8.1, 10 and 12MPa. The reaction was conducted until the time when a decrease in the yield was observed, i.e. after the equilibrium was reached. The equilibrium is defined at the point where maximum yield is achieved in function of time for the particular combination of reaction temperature and pressure. After the specified reaction time, the mixture was cooled down to a temperature of about 150°C. After reaching this temperature, the unreacted alcohol was removed from the reaction vessel. Alcohol vapour in nitrogen flow was passed through a 3.5m long, water-cooled condensing column. After further cooling of the reaction mixture to a temperature of about 55°C, the reaction mixture was introduced into the separation vessel for ageing for 16h. After separation of raw biodiesel, the same was subjected to vacuum distillation to remove the residual alcohol. The experiment was designed as an incomplete three factor factorial design. Two factors, temperature and pressure, have three levels. The number of levels of the third factor, reaction time, varies depending on the time needed to achieve the equilibrium state for the particular combination of temperature and pressure (Table A.1). The experimental results were obtained by variation of transesterification conditions. For each of the combination of reaction time, pressure and temperature three replicates were done and the average yield was calculated. In all experiments the esters yield (EYield ) was calculated by the following equation: (1) E Yield = Amount of ester layer ( g ) · Purity of ester layer ( % ) Amount of edible oil, feedstock ( g ) ( % ) After decanting, all product samples were weighed and the amount of ester was identified. Yield was obtained as a function of purity of ester layer by involving the values of the ester amount and the amount of edible oil in (1). The obtained biodiesel was subjected to Gas chromatograph (GC) analysis to determine the content of fatty acid esters (FAE) (according to SRPS EN 14103). The used amount of electricity needed to heat the reaction mixture and to maintain the desired temperature in reactor was measured by an electricity counter (Tracon Electric TVO-F1-1)."
4,Statistical analysis,"2.3 Statistical analysis For each type of alcohol the effect of temperature, pressure, and time on the biodiesel yield was analyzed using linear multiple regression model. Standardized regression coefficients (or beta weights) are the most common measure of relative influence of predictors on a dependent variable. For the linear regression model with p predictor variables standardized coefficients can be expressed as: (2) b i ′ = s Y s X i · b i , ( i = 1 , … , p ) , where bi , (i =1,…, p) are the least squares estimates of regression coefficients, SY and SXi are sample estimates of standard deviations of variables Y and Xi , (i =1,…, p). It is important to note that standardized regression coefficients should be used to compare the effects of variables within equations. They can never be compared across samples or populations because the standardization is different for each group. The main focus of analysis is in obtaining relative importance as proportionate contribution of each predictor to coefficient of determination (R 2) considering both the unique contribution (direct effect) of each predictor by itself and its effect when it is combined with other predictors. Six different metrics for assessing relative importance of regressors in the linear regression models are given by Grömping [28]. In this analysis the squared standardized coefficient metrics (betasq) was applied. The least squares estimates of regression coefficients, estimates of coefficients standard errors, t-statistics for testing significance of the coefficients, standardized regression coefficients, R 2 and F-test were calculated using STATISTICA release 12 software [29]. The relaimpo package for program R 3.1.0 [30] was used for calculating the relative importance of independent variables and corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals."
5,Economic analysis,"2.4 Economic analysis Economic analysis was limited to the assessment of direct material and energy costs of supercritical transesterification. These costs include the costs of rapeseed oil, alcohol and energy consumed in the transesterification process. Other transesterification costs (e.g. direct labour costs, indirect costs) were assumed to be equal for the ethanol, methanol and 1-propanol based production process; thus, without affecting the results of the differential analysis. Direct transesterification costs were calculated based on the consumption of each material and energy used in the transesterification process and their respective wholesale prices. The quantity of material and energy inputs in the transesterification process was calculated for each of the 315 biodiesel production alternatives (105 combinations for each of the three alcohols; see Table A.1). Estimation of the quantity of rapeseed oil and energy consumed in the transesterification process was based on measured data (see Section 2.2 and Table A.1). The quantity of alcohol consumed in the transesterification process was assumed to be equal to the stoichiometric amount of alcohol which was calculated from the stoichiometric alcohol to oil ratio of 3:1 for the transesterification process. A tabular overview of material and energy inputs and outputs in the transesterification process, as well as the prices used for the calculation of direct costs is given in Table 3 . Since data on material and energy flows for the supercritical processes were taken from a laboratory-scale batch reactor, the estimated costs do not reflect the anticipated price of transesterification at an industrial-scale plant. However, the results may contribute to better understanding of the relative significance of different process conditions and alcohols on process economics."

7,The effect of alcohol and reaction variables on biodiesel yield,"3.1 The effect of alcohol and reaction variables on biodiesel yield This section presents the results of experiments conducted by varying different reaction parameters for each of the alcohols. Effects of temperature, pressure and type of alcohol (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol) on the biodiesel yields in the function of time are presented in Fig. 2 . The influence of reaction temperature, reaction time and pressure on biodiesel yield is discussed in the following subchapters. 3.1.1 Influence of temperature on yields Temperature has a crucial impact on biodiesel yield regardless of the type of alcohol used for the transesterification. The highest yield is achieved at the highest temperature and pressure. At higher temperature the equilibrium is achieved in shorter time. In the SCM (supercritical methanol) process the highest yield (93%) was achieved after 15min at highest temperature (350°C) and pressure (12MPa). At 300°C and 250°C, the highest yields were significantly lower (82.9% and 56.1%, respectively) and longer period was required for those yields to be achieved (25 and 50min, respectively). The highest yields in the SCE (supercritical ethanol) and the SCP (supercritical propanol) processes were also achieved at the highest reaction temperature and pressure. At 8MPa, when temperature increased from 250°C to 350°C the highest yields in the SCM, SCE and SCP processes increased by 63.6%, 63.9% and 73.9%, respectively, while the required time to achieve the equilibrium state decreased by 43.0%, 38.8% and 36.8%, respectively. These tendencies were noticed at other pressures (10 and 12MPa) as well. This indicates that in terms of yields temperature increase would relatively more benefit the processes with alcohols of higher molecular weight; while in terms of time to achieve the equilibrium state processes with alcohols of lower molecular weight benefit relatively more from the temperature increase. In general, the yield of alkyl esters increases as the reaction temperature increases, while at the same reaction temperature, alcohols with shorter alkyl chains give better conversion [36]. This might be due to the long chain alkyl group hindering the (–OH) group in alcohol from reacting with triglycerides to form fatty acid alkyl esters. Hence, SCM reaction has higher optimum yield of biodiesel compared to alcohol with longer alkyl chain [37]. Furthermore, increased temperature might contribute to decomposition of phase boundary formed between alcohol and triglyceride molecules, which results in higher FAME yield [38]. 3.1.2 Influence of time on yield The results confirmed reaction time as an important determinant of yields and reaction rates regardless of the type of alcohol used in the transesterification process. Generally, the speed of reaction is higher under supercritical conditions compared to transesterification in subcritical conditions. This is the result of the formation of single-phase system of oil-alcohol and decomposition of the hydrogen bonds due to the decrease in polarity of alcohol [39]. At 350°C and 12MPa, equilibrium states of SCM, SCE and SCP (highest yields: 93.0%, 91.9% and 91.1%) were achieved after 15, 20 and 25min, respectively. The diagram (Fig. 2) shows that during the first 25–30min the reaction was very fast at temperature range 300–350°C for all alcohols, except methanol, where the highest yield at 350°C was already achieved at the very beginning of the observed time range. These results are similar to the results obtained by other authors who indicated that the FAME yield increased progressively during the first 20min after which that increase was quite slow [16,39]. Some authors indicated that slowing down the reaction rate led to increased ester hydrolysis (reverse reaction of transesterification) due to their long exposure to higher temperatures and pressures which resulted in loss of esters [40,41]. After reaching the steady state, the rate constant of reversible reactions becomes higher, causing decrease in yield. He et al. [42] also noticed the increase of the esters of saturated fatty acids over the time of reaction, while unsaturated fatty acids participate in side reactions which reduce the yield during the prolonged exposure of the reactants to high temperatures. The same authors stated that the decomposition rate of unsaturated fatty acids with more double bonds was higher than the decomposition rate of unsaturated fatty acids with only one double bond. Increased temperatures would result in higher reaction speeds. The SCM process required the shortest time to achieve the equilibrium state. Supercritical methanol is more acidic than alcohols with higher molecular weights; therefore, it shows higher reactivity as alkylation agent [27]. The phenomenon can be explained with higher dipole moment of methyl alcohol in supercritical conditions compared to alcohols with higher molecular weights. Less reactivity of ethyl alcohol results in longer reaction time. Warabi et al. [26] explain the increase of the time required for reaching the steady state using ethanol and 1-propanol by the lower reactivity of saturated fatty acids with longer chain of alcohol species. 3.1.3 Influence of pressure on yield Increasing the pressure up to 12MPa would have a positive impact on reaction rate and FAE yields. Further increase in pressure would not affect the yields significantly since the maximum solubility of the alcohols in oil is already achieved [42]. The positive impact of increased pressure on biodiesel yields results from the higher molar density of alcohols at higher pressures, better solubility of alcohols in oil, as well as by slower splitting of molecules of fatty acids, especially of unsaturated ones. By increasing the pressure from 8 to 12MPa at 350°C, the yields of FAME, FAEE and FAPE increased by 10.6%, 25.4% and 29.9%, respectively, while the time required for achieving the equilibrium state shortened by 66.0%, 63.6% and 58.3%, respectively. This indicates that pressure has relatively higher impact on yields in case of alcohols with higher molecular weights."
8,Results of regression analysis,"3.2 Results of regression analysis The least squares estimates of regression coefficients, estimates of coefficients standard errors, t-statistics, corresponding p values and standardized regression coefficients are shown in Table 4 . The overall goodness of fit of the regression models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination, adjusted coefficient of determination and F-test. Based on the estimated models of FAME, FAEE and FAPE yield it can be concluded that all considered predictors have highly significant effect (p <0.01). The high values of R 2 and statistically highly significant F values indicate that applied multiple regression models adequately describe experimental data. For all types of alcohol, the values of standardized regression coefficients show that according to relative effect on biodiesel yield, in the first place is the temperature, followed by time and pressure. Relative contributions of individual variables in explaining dependent variables are shown in Fig. 3 , where 95% bootstrap confidence intervals are also presented. It can be noted that the rank of predictor importance is equal for each type of alcohol. Analysis of the magnitude of the estimates indicated that in the case of SCM process temperature was approximately 6.7 times as important as time, and time was approximately 1.8 times as important as pressure. In the case of SCE process temperature was approximately 3.6 times as important as time, and time was approximately 1.5 times as important as pressure. Finally, for the SCP process temperature was approximately 3.4 times as important as time, and time was approximately 1.5 times as important as pressure. Higher temperature to time ratio of SCM process compared to the SCE and SCP processes can be explained by the fact that methanol, as the alcohol with the smallest molecule, can simultaneously attack the alcohol groups in glycerol during the transesterification process. This phenomenon causes higher reaction rate and reduces the influence of time on transesterification [26,43]. Reaction time has relatively more influence on yields in case of alcohols with higher molecular weights (ethanol and 1-propanol). This can be explained with the decrease of dipole moment and corresponding decrease in acidity of the alcohol molecules with the increase of molecular chain. Small difference between the importance of reaction time for yields in SCE and SCP processes could be explained by smaller and smaller decrease of dipole moment and acidity of alcohols with higher molecular chain. By inserting a new methylene group in the molecule, the values of dipole moments as well as the values of the acidities approach to the same value, which can be regarded as their limit value. With the increase of molecular chain the influence of pressure on yields relatively increases. Pressure probably has more significant influence on the orientation of molecules with longer chains. There are opinions that the relative importance of pressure as a yield determinant decreases with the increase in the weight of the alcohol molecule [26], but this phenomenon was not observed either in this or in our previous study [44]."
9,Direct costs of transesterification,"3.3 Direct costs of transesterification Direct costs of producing 1kg of biodiesel depending on reaction conditions and type of alcohol in the transesterification process are shown in Fig. 4 . Based on these results some general observations can be made. The lowest direct costs were observed at the highest temperature and pressure. Direct costs increase with decrease in temperature and/or pressure, ceteris paribus. Relationship between reaction time and direct costs is not that straightforward. Increased reaction time had, to a certain point, positive impact on direct costs; beyond this point, direct costs showed tendency to increase. The choice of alcohol has crucial impact on process economics. Transesterification in supercritical methanol has the lowest direct costs, while transesterification in supercritical propanol has the highest direct costs (Fig. 4). This is primarily because of higher consumption of rapeseed oil per unit of biodiesel in the SCE and SCP processes, i.e. due to the relatively higher yield of FAME in the observed range of reaction conditions. In addition, transesterification in supercritical ethanol and propanol consumes more alcohol (on mass basis) and energy per unit of biodiesel produced. Comparative advantage of the SCM process is most apparent at shorter reaction times, while it decreases with the increase of reaction time (Fig. 4). This can be explained with the relatively higher speeds of reactions with methanol, thus the equilibrium is achieved in shorter time. Direct material and energy costs are lower for alcohols with lower molecular weights, and at higher temperatures and pressures. This indicates that biodiesel yield has a crucial impact on process economics. The functional relationship between biodiesel yields and direct costs of transesterification is shown in Fig. 5 . The functions were derived using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) [45]. Direct costs decrease with the increase in biodiesel yields and they are the lowest at the highest yields for each investigated alcohol (Fig. 5). A breakdown of the components of total direct costs in the equilibrium state explains this observation (Fig. 6 ). The largest proportion of direct cost is the cost of oil feedstock. Feedstock related costs are responsible for 90% of the costs associated with SCM process. As regards the SCE and SCP, the share of feedstock related costs are lower (83% and 76%, respectively) which can be explained with relatively higher costs of alcohols. Energy related costs are responsible for around 6% of direct transesterification costs, regardless of the type of alcohol used for transesterification. The overwhelming impact of yields on process economics may be explained with a relatively high price of oil feedstock (943 EUR/mt) assumed in this study. However, the results of sensitivity analysis show that even at a significantly lower feedstock prices this observation stands firm (Table 5 ). Even at 70% oil price reduction (approximately the level of waste vegetable oil price; 283 EUR/mt) the lowest production costs are achieved at the highest yields. In the SCM process, the lowest costs were obtained with variant 22 (350°C, 12MPa, 15min), while in the case of the SCE and SCP processes, this was with variants 23 (350°C, 12MPa, 20min) and 24 (350°C, 12MPa, 25min), respectively (Table 5)."
10,Conclusions,"• In the observed range of transesterification conditions, the SCM process yields, on average, more than the SCE and SCP processes. By increasing the chain length of the reacting alcohol, the dipole moment decreases and correspondingly decreases the acidity of the molecule. • Temperature has the highest influence on biodiesel yields, followed by reaction time and pressure, regardless of the type of alcohol used for transesterification. However, relative importance of these variables for the explanation of yields is different for the investigated alcohols. • The SCM process applies alcohol with the smallest molecule; thus, the influence of temperature is the most important, while the effect of relative response of time on transesterification is smaller. The reaction of methanol molecules can attack simultaneously the alcohol groups of glycerol bounded in fatty acid ester molecule, which causes an increase in the reaction rate, and indirectly reduces the relative importance of time for the reaction. • For alcohols with higher molecular weight, relative influence of pressure on yields is more pronounced, which could be explained by more significant influence of pressure on the orientation of molecules with longer chains. • The results of economic assessment have revealed that the SCM process has the lowest direct material and energy costs per unit of biodiesel produced. • The yield has overwhelming impact on process economics. Direct costs decrease with the increase in biodiesel yields and they are the lowest at the highest yields. This observation is valid even at very low prices of oil feedstock."
