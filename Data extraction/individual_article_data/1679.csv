0,Introduction,"The serious environmental consequences caused by the available fossil-based fuels and the demand for supply the appropriate levels of energy have been attracted the attention of many researchers around the world [1]. Numerous efforts have been performed for the finding of environmentally friendly, long lasting and sustainable energy sources. Although wind and solar energy seems to be great alternatives to fossil fuels, but wind and solar are not constant. Therefore, several energy storage systems which can help in stabilizing such oscillations are needed [2]. Various types of energy storage technologies have been adapted and evolved by energy storage industries for daily energy requirements, where the energy is stored so it can later be distributed through a network when required [3]. Hydrogen is recognized as a clean and safe renewable energy carrier, which is a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels [4]. However, one of the major impediments for realizing the hydrogen economy is to find a safe, reversible, effective and reasonable pathway to store and deliver hydrogen [5]. This is one of the most important technical priorities. Contrary the conventional hydrogen storage techniques which require high pressure and low temperature, solid-state hydrogen storage due to the fast kinetics, suitable thermodynamics, great storage capacity, long cycle life, lightweight and safety are noticed as a promising method [6]. Various storage media like carbonaceous materials [7], metal organic frameworks [8], metal alloys [9], boron nitride [10], mixed metal oxides [11], hydrides [12], etc. are developed to uptake hydrogen. Among these hosts, nanoscaled mixed metal oxides (MMOs) have demonstrated the structural, physical and chemical preferences for hydrogen storage [13]. The defects in the structure, variation in electronical states, and the existence of redox species can boost the hydrogen storage performance [14]. Furthermore, the presence of a series of active dangling bands on the surface of the host resulted in their tendency to bind with surrounding atoms to decline the surface energy. Nanoscaled materials can extend the active surface area and shorten transport channels for electrons and ions [15,16]. With the advent of solid-state materials in the field of energy storage, several attempts have been developed in order to improve the terms “thermodynamic” and “kinetic” of these materials such as nanoscale and (nano)composite formations [17]. Synthesis of nanomaterials can boost both thermodynamics and kinetics of the system owing to the effects of “boundary”, and “surface”. Nanoscaling can destabilized the thermodynamic through energy states. In the same vein, nanoscaling can affect kinetic against the process of diffusion and nucleation through grain boundaries [18]. Similarly, in nanocomposite systems, a cooperative interaction between domains can enhance hydrogen sorption kinetics and thermodynamics. This occurs among a series of reactions/interactions like nucleation, and diffusion [19]. These two crucial parameters are explained in terms of “stability” and “barrier” by emphasizing on the thermodynamic and kinetic factors such as formation enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S) (van’t Hoff equation), and activation energy (Ea) (Arrhenius equation) [20]. It is well known that metal molybdates represent remarkable catalytic activities and suitable electrochemical properties [21]. Double molybdate compounds with AB2(MoO4)4 composition, where A and B are bivalent metal cations and trivalent rare earth ions, respectively, are recently achieved interest owing to its proper physico-chemical stability, unique optical, and electrochemical properties. So far, double molybdate oxides have been applied in diverse systems like laser, light-emitting diode, up-conversion, solar cell, and hydrogen storage [22–24]. Hydrogen uptake by double molybdates cam be performed by incorporation of hydrogen protons in the vacancies and creation of OHˉ ion defects. In addition, the presence of redox species such as cerium (Ce), molybdenum (Mo), cobalt (Co), etc. ions can improve the hydrogen discharge capacity. With the advent of nanotechnology in 1955, systematic developments and uses of these materials have achieved a great interest [25]. It is known that the structure and morphology of the nanomaterials can directly reflect into the final properties of the product. Anisotropic nanoparticles and nanocrystals have a highly symmetrical structures, where the surface energies are almost regular [26]. The product of such structures is generally isotropic particles with truncated octahedron, icosahedron, regular decahedron, and Mark’s decahedron morphologies [27]. As mentioned, the shape and grain size have significant influence on the characteristics and the final applications of nanostructured materials. Therefore, different preparation methods have been applied to control the shape and grain size of nanoscale compounds. Solid-state reaction [28] and sol-gel methods [22] are examined for preparation of double molybdate materials. Combustion procedure is another reliable, affordable, quick and facile synthesis approach which can be used for controllable synthesis of nanomaterials [29]. In this study, a facile and green combustion method was performed for synthesis of truncated octahedron shaped CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals, for the first time. Various carbohydrates (glucose, maltose, starch) with different steric hindrance were applied as fuel, reductant and capping agent. In addition, the calcination temperature was altered in order to obtain a pure composition. Besides, as the significant novelty of this investigation, superior electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of the selected sample was examined."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and physical measurement,"2.1 Materials and physical measurement The Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)20.6 H2O, ≥ 98% pure), cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)30.6 H2O, ≥ 99% pure), ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O240.4 H2O, ≥ 99% pure), glucose (C6H12O6, 99.5% pure), maltose (C12H22O11, ≥99% pure), and starch (C6H10O5)n were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and were applied as-received without any further purification. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was analyzed by a Philips-X′pertpro diffractometer operated using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.5418 Å in the range of 10 ≤ 2θ ≤ 80 (scan rate = 0.05 2θ/s). Intended for the investigation of the size and shape of the nanocrystals, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, MIRA3) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was utilized. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the sample was obtained from a Philips EM208 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of sample was registered on Shimadzu Varian 4300 spectrophotometer in KBr pellets ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The N2 adsorption/desorption analysis (BET) was applied at −196 °C using an automated gas adsorption analyzer (Tristar 3000, Micromeritics). Pore size distribution was calculated by using desorption branch of the isotherm by the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method. Eventually, the electrochemical performances of the samples were evaluated primarily using a cyclic voltammogram (CV- using K3(Fe(CN)6)/K4(Fe(CN)6) in the 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, scan rate of 0.1 V−1) and then by using a chronopotentiometer. K3(Fe(CN)6)/K4(Fe(CN)6 is known as redox couple and is a well-characterized negatively charged inner sphere system which is sensitive to changes occurring at the electrode surface, allowing these changes to be interrogated. The system was adjusted in order to study the hydrogen storage ability of the sample in a standard three-electrode setup. In this electrochemical cell, platinum (Pt) was utilized as a counter electrode, Hg/HgO as a reference electrode, and a coated copper-sheet (surface area ~1 × 1 cm2) as a working electrode. This electrode was prepared by deposition of MMO samples on porous copper sheet from a well-dispersed MMO in absolute alcohol."
3,Synthesis procedures,"2.2 Synthesis procedures In this research, six compositions were proposed with fixed stoichiometric amounts of metal salts, various reductants (glucose, starch, maltose) and calcination temperatures (500, 700, 900 °C); a) without reductant – calcined at 500 °C, b) with glucose – calcined at 500 °C, c) with starch – calcined at 500 °C, d) with maltose – calcined at 500 °C, e) with maltose – calcined at 700 °C, and f) with maltose – calcined at 900 °C. These three reductants are known as green reagents and eco-friendly which acting as fuel, reducing and capping agent in chemical reactions [30,31]. When reducing agent reacts with oxidant, an exothermic reaction occurs, providing initial energy of reaction. Primarily, three reductants were used, and the calcination temperature was fixed at 500 °C. Based on the primary results (obtained from XRD and SEM), the calcination temperature was increased in order to obtained a pure sample with homogenous morphology. Nanosized cobalt cerium molybdate was synthesized by dissolving stoichiometric amount of Co2+ (1 mmol) and Ce3+ (2 mmol) primary sources in approximately 50 mL of deionized water. After the dissolution of metal ions, the fuel (glucose, maltose or starch) as the reductant was dissolved in the mixture, and the molar ratio of fuel to the total metal ions was fixed at 2:1. Then stoichiometric amount of Mo6+ (4 mmol) source was dissolved in distilled water, stirred at 80 °C for 10 min and added to the above container. The obtained solution was stirred vigorously and heated at 200 °C for 1 h. This temperature is known as autoignition temperature and required for providing enough activation energy. In this step, a self-propagating combustion reaction was occurred followed by large volume of reddish brown NO2 gases release and formation of fluffy shaped materials. Finally, these precursors were calcined at 700 ℃ for 3 h to achieve the final product. Fig. 1 represents the procedure pathways of this production. In order to study the effect of fuel type and calcination temperature on the particle size, Purity and morphology of the final product, several experiments were conducted."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structural and physical observations,"3.1 Structural and physical observations The crystal structure of the CoCe2(MoO4)4 - prepared without reductant, and in the presence of glucose, starch, fructose, and maltose - was identified by their respective XRD patterns ( Fig. 2). The sample without reductant was illustrated a series of small peaks (like noise). This pattern indicates that the CoCe2(MoO4)4 is not properly formed. In the presence of reductants, almost similar patterns were obtained, however, the diffractograms of the samples prepared in maltose, particularly given that at 500 and 700 °C are more intense, almost without any impurities. In these two patterns, a series of intense peaks at 2θ equal to 28.43°, 30.55°, 33.98°, 46.12°, 48.58°, 52.60°, and 63.12°. Since this structure is new, there is no any related JCPDS number. In general, the twofold molybdate with the common equation M-R2(MoO4)4 - where M, and R are metal (II) cations and rare earth (III) ions respectively - is one of the foremost critical families of molybdate based complex metal oxides. Average crystallite size (D) of the samples was calculated using well-known Scherrer equation [32]. The calculated results show that the D-factor for the optimum samples are obtained to be around 25 nm (maltose/500 °C) and 28 nm (maltose/700 °C). The surface morphology of the samples was observed based on their FESEM micrographs ( Fig. 3). The blank sample (without reductant) is composed of irregular-agglomerated particles (Fig. 3a). The surface morphology of the samples synthesized in glucose (Fig. 3b) and starch (Fig. 3c) are denser as compared to the blank samples, however, the particles are agglomerated. It seems, in these two samples, there are two phases; inorganic, and organic, i.e. the reaction pathways in not complete, most probably due to low temperature. Interestingly, the three samples synthesized in maltose at 500 °C (Fig. 3d), 700 °C (Fig. 3e), and 900 °C (Fig. 3f), show different morphologies, where the nanoparticles are formed in regular zones. This phenomenon is more obvious in the sample synthesized in maltose at 700 °C. In this sample, truncated octahedron morphology is formed which composed of several nanoparticles ( Fig. 4). In this morphology, the nanoparticles are located in the 14-faced Archimedean solid. It is reported that the truncated octahedron morphology possesses appropriate rate capacity and capacity retention [33]. In the similar vein, this sample was selected for further investigation. The monosaccharide (glucose), disaccharide (maltose) and polysaccharide (starch) are used as reducing agents. In the reaction profile of the samples, the surface of the products is covered by hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates, where hydrogen bonds are formed. The carbohydrates adsorbed on the surfaces of the products and prevented particles from agglomeration by steric hindrance mechanism. In the presence of glucose, the products are almost agglomerated with an irregular morphology. This phenomenon can be also observed in the absence of the saccharides (blank sample). More hydroxyl groups in the disaccharides can cause particles to be buried. In fact, the disaccharides play an important role in formation of the nanoparticles with unique structures [34]. As mentioned before, the number of functional groups particularly -OH, =O and -O- support the number of hydrogen bonding [35]. For instant, the monosaccharides like glucose form less hydrogen bond as compared to disaccharides like maltose. Based on the structure, maltose is formed from two units of glucose (α1 → α4) bonds, with many hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, starch or amylum is a carbohydrate consisting of many glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds which can cause the formation of large and heterogeneous particles [36]. The purity of the sample can be identified based on the elemental composition of the EDS. The EDS pattern of CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles ( Fig. 5a) consists only cobalt (Co), cerium (Ce), Molybdenium (Mo), and Oxygen (O), with elemental percentage of 5.86, 27.74, 39.05, and 27.35, respectively. In this pattern, several peaks are raised for Ce (Mα, Lβ1, Lβ2, Ly11, Ly1) and Co (Lα, Kα, Kβ), which imply multi-transitions from one energy state to another, whereas the heavier elements have more available electron shells. The theoretical elemental percentages were calculated to be around Co – 6.02, Ce – 28.63, Mo – 39.20, and O – 26.15. From experimental and theoretical observations, one can see that the experimental results are well-matched with theoretical calculations, where the ratio of Mo/O is around 1.5 in theoretical calculations, and ~1.4 in experimental results. This ratio confirms the formation of MoO4 [37]. In addition, the ratio of (Co+Ce)/(4Mo+16O) is calculated to be around 0.51 (experimental) and 0.53 (theoretical). The auxiliary arrangement of the test was moreover distinguished utilizing FTIR analysis (Fig. 5b). This spectrum consists of five intense bands which doled out at vibrational frequencies of 3433 cm−1, 1629 cm−1, 915 cm−1, 844 cm−1, 718 cm−1, 417 cm−1, and a small band at 570 cm−1. Two successive bands at 3433 cm−1, 1629 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration frequencies of ‒OH group. The vibration frequencies underneath 1000 cm−1 are related to metal-oxygen-metal and oxygen-metal-oxygen. For example, an absorption at 417 cm−1 regimes is corresponded to the ‒O‒Ce‒O‒ stretching vibrations, three absorptions at 915 cm−1 (‒Mo˭O), 844 and 718 cm−1 (‒ Mo-O‒Mo‒) are relegated to the MoO2 vibrations [38,39], and a small band at around 566 cm−1 is affiliated with Co‒O group [40]. HRTEM images of truncated octahedral CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals are presented in Fig. 5(c). The geometry pattern of the truncated octahedron can be clearly observed where homogeneously dispersed in cube-shape with an edge side length of around 50 nm. The nanosized particles are distributed on the surface of this side of the truncated octahedron. The results are in good agreement with our prediction from FESEM micrographs. High contrast (bright ↔ dark) implies highly crystalline and dense texture of the CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals. The HRTEM of the sample indicates the lattice fringes of around 0.310 nm. This could be assigned to the (1 1 2) planes of the tetragonal phase. The specific surface area and porosity are two critical points in solid-state energy storage systems [41]. The BET-BJH profile of the sample is presented in Fig. 6. Based on the IUPAC classification, the plot is close to type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop. The H3 hysteresis implies an aggregated medium, with slit-shaped pores and non-uniform size [42]. The BET specific surface area (Sa), total pore volume (Vtot.), and the average pore diameter (Dave.) of the sample was obtained to be around 4.14 m2/g, 0.017395 cm3/g, and 16.807 nm, respectively."
6,Electrochemical hydrogen storage,"3.2 Electrochemical hydrogen storage In electrochemical hydrogen storage setup, the adsorption and desorption behaviors are crucial in hydrogen evolution. Higher efficiency, and shorter refueling times are two major advantages of the electrochemical hydrogen storage systems based solid-state materials. In this section, an attempt has been developed to present the general electrochemical performance of the selected sample. Primarily, the neat electrochemical performance of the sample was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The fitting greatness of the current and a rectangular sort of voltammogram are two critical variables of a perfect capacitive object. Fig. 7(a) comprises the CVs of the CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals operated in an alkaline medium. Redox crest can be observed in the range of 0.2–0.6 V, representing the potential of the sample for oxidation and reduction. Interestingly, the CV of CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals implies a superior electrochemical activity as compared to glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The anodic peak current (Ipa) and the cathodic peak current (Ipc) of the sample are raised at around 50 and −49 µA. As mentioned before, the hydrogen storage properties of the sample were recorder in a three-electrodes electrochemical system (Fig. 7b). The selected sample with unique morphology shows an improved maximum discharge capacity of around 4750 mAh/g, comparable with reported hydrogen storage mixed metal oxides [43–45]. The discharge pattern shows potential plateaus due to the structural and physico-chemical properties of the sample [46]. Despite morphological and structural characteristics of the CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals, there are three metal sites which can boost hydrogen storage properties of the sample. It is known that in metal oxides, the hydrogen atoms can link on the surface by adsorption or penetrate inside (Fig. 7c). In addition, the presence of redox species can enhance the hydrogen storage performance of the sample. In between, molybdenum is more potential owing to its wide range of oxidation states and can adsorb hydrogen as Eq.1; CuCe2(Mo(y)O4)4 + xH2O + xe- ↔ CuCe2(Mo(y−1)O4)4─Hx + xOH- (1). Saldan et al. [47] reported that an enhanced hydrogen storage in the nanocomposites containing MoO3. In energy storage technologies, the capacity is directly related to discharge current [48]. Fig. 7(d) represents the first discharge capacities of CoCe2(MoO4)4 nanocrystals at 0.5 and 2 mA. The results are in a good agreement with our expectations, i.e. upon increasing the currents, the discharge capacities are enhanced; 0.5 mA (100 mAh/g) → 1 mA (250 mAh/g) → 2 mA (~500 mAh/g). Last but not the least, in the modern hydrogen storage technologies, novel materials are urgently required as an alternative to the present commercialized materials with enhanced properties. Metal oxides and mixed metal oxides having redox species, and morphological flexibility can be an appropriate alternative. In addition, the MMOs can easily linked with various organic and inorganic materials in order to form composite/hybrid."
7,Conclusions,"In this paper, an efficient catalyst (CoCe2(MoO4)4) based nanosized mixed metal oxides was successfully synthesized via combustion method. Structural evaluations were confirmed the pure composition, and crystalline nature of the samples synthesized in the present of reductant. Continuous morphological observation was affirmed the formation of truncated tetrahedron arrangement of the sample, which reduced in maltose at 700 °C. Based on these observations, this sample was selected for electrochemical analysis, and its ability to adsorb hydrogen. In an alkaline medium, the cyclic voltammogram of the sample was deduced the activity of the sample in an electrochemical setup. The hydrogen adsorption and desorption of the sample were examined in a three-electrode electrochemical system, where a superior hydrogen capacity was obtained at around 4750 mAh/g, corresponding to the hydrogen physisorption, and existence of the redox species. This study highlights a new class of material for efficient hydrogen storage, which is not listed in the US-department of energy (US-DOE)."
