0,Introduction,"As the most abundant and widely distributed fossil fuel on earth, coal accounts for 25% of the non-renewable energy consumption in the world (Ma et al., 2018). The production and consumption of coal in China, as the main producer and consumer of coal, account for 31% and 50.5% of those in the world, respectively (Li et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2020). The demand for this resource is increasingly growing, especially with the continuous developments in the economy and society; therefore, the exploitation and utilization of coal in China play a decisive role. However, the exploitation and utilization of coal also brings serious dust pollution to the surrounding environment. For example, the dust produced in the process of coal exploitation causes the frequent occurrence of pneumoconiosis in workers (Dang et al., 2017; Erol et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2018; Nie et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018c; Zhou et al., 2018); explosions even happen when the dust concentration is excessively high during excavation operations, thereby seriously threatening the safety of coal miners (Ni et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2009); road dust also can be generated during the transport of coal, which threatens the safety of roads and pedestrians (Bao et al., 2019; Işıklan et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2017); in addition, the gradual increase in the number of open mine yards also poses a serious risk to the air quality and resident health in the nearby cities (Cheng et al., 2016; Grincova et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2016; Organiscak and Randolph reed, 2004; Xie et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, dust prevention is of great importance in the exploitation, transport, and storage of coal. In order to solve the above problems, some physical and chemical dust prevention methods have been developed. Physical dust setting technologies mainly include spraying, injecting water on the coal seam, and using a water curtain for purification (Cai et al., 2020). These methods have the advantages of low cost and simple operation; however, the problems of short acting duration, poor wind erosion resistance, and waste of water resources also are present. Based on the above research findings, chemical dust suppressants have the merits of good dust-suppression effects while saving water resources, which have attracted wide attention from researchers (Shi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). However, with further research, defects in current chemical dust suppressants have also been considered. For example, waste chemicals from oil refinery were used as the wetting agent to suppress dust, but the agent showed poor adhesion capability and secondary dust was easily generated; the dust suppressants derived from water-adsorbing inorganic salts have been developed, but they harmed soil and plants and corroded the equipment; the byproducts of biodiesel production were used as the dust suppressant. Though the economic cost was largely reduced, the environmental friendliness and dust-suppression properties still needed improvement. (Alosmanov et al., 2015; Goodrich et al., 2009; Medeiros et al., 2012). Therefore, the development of environment-friendly and highly efficient dust suppressants is still a pressing problem in coal dust prevention field. Hydrogels have attracted a wide attention in the development of dust suppressants with high efficiency and remarkable environment friendliness, due to the potential advantages of good water retention and high consolidation efficiency. Single-network hydrogels have the advantages of high visco-elasticity and good water retention. However, due to the problems associated with their poor mechanical properties and non-uniform network structures, fractures easily occur under low stresses or strains. Thus, the shell formed by the gel-dust interaction is easily destroyed and shows poor dust solidification (Bao et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2017). Double-network hydrogels are formed by interpenetrating and cross-linking a rigid network and a flexible network with high viscoelasticity and good water retention. (Chen et al., 2012, 2015; Na, 2013). Moreover, the double-network structure ensures the mechanical strength and good tensile properties of the hydrogel. It overcomes the shortcomings of conventional single-network hydrogels with poor mechanical properties, and the tensile strength and compressive strength can reach up to the order of magnitude of MPA, which is Incomparable to those of single network hydrogels. Moreover, double-network hydrogels also have the advantages of good bio-compatibility and being environment-friendly. Pourjavadi et al. prepared the double-network hydrogel with good mechanical properties (tensile strength of 11.52 MPa), high bio-compatibility (with 327.49 ± 11.22% viability) and high chemical stability, and therefore, it became an ideal material for biological applications; Na prepared extremely high toughness double-network hydrogels (water content of about 90 wt%, compressive strength of 20–60 MPa, tensile strain of 1000–2000%) and discussed the processability and the applicability of double-network hydrogels as biomaterials and as conductive materials (Na, 2013; Pourjavadi et al., 2018). However, until now, research on the application of interpenetrating double-network hydrogels to the dust suppression in coal mines is still lacking. Based on the aforementioned review, this paper presents the idea of developing highly efficient and environment-friendly dust suppressants and uses the polymer poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), xanthan gum (XG) and acrylic acid (AA) to prepare an interpenetrating double-network hydrogel, and finally adds the appropriate amount of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) to enhance wettbbility. Among them, PVA has good hydrophilicity, film formation and degradation properties; XG is a natural, non-toxic and degradable polymer material; polyacrylic acid gel has good biocompatibility and contains a large number of hydrophilic carboxyl groups, which can interact with hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen bond network. Its monomer acrylic acid is harmless to the human body and can respond to changes in pH in the environment (Katzbauer, 1998; Qin YANG, 2018; Wen et al., 2020). The dust suppressant has a certain viscosity, can bond the dust together to prevent dust re-entrainment, and has the characteristics of moisture absorption and water retention, so that it can effectively play the role of wetting and covering. Finally, as the moisture evaporates, a hard consolidation layer will form on the surface of coal dust, which improves its ability to resist wind erosion. The dust suppressant has a good effect on coal dust control in the process of coal mining, transportation and storage, and improves the resource utilization rate of minerals."
1,Experimental materials and methods,
2,Experimental materials,"2.1 Experimental materials 1799-type poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), content ≥90.5%, analytically pure (AR grade); XG, USP grade; AA, molecular weight 72.00, content ≥ 99.5%, AR grade; Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), molecular weight 40.00, content ≥ 96.0%, AR grade; Ammonium persulfate (APS), molecular weight 228.20, content ≥ 98.0%, AR grade; Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), molecular weight 348.48, content ≥ 90.0%, AR grade. The coal sample was collected from the Er Lin Tu (ELT) coal mine in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and ground into 200mesh coal powder for further use. The basic properties of the coal sample are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Ration of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS and optimal process conditions,"2.2 Ration of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS and optimal process conditions A single factor test was used to investigate the preparation process of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS. The effects of the usage amounts of PVA, AA and XG, and the final reaction temperature on the viscosity, surface tension and compression strength of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS were studied, and the properties were comprehensively evaluated (Ding et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2019). The level of each factor can be seen in Table 2 . The detailed preparation steps were as follows: first, in an 85 °C water bath, PVA with the mass according to Table 2 was slowly and evenly added and dispersed into a 100 mL three-neck flask and stirred for 1.5 h at constant temperature. Secondly, the water bath was cooled to 75 °C, then XG with the mass according to Table 2 was added to the above solution slowly and evenly, and the dispersion was stirred for 1.5 h at constant temperature. Finally, the temperature was reduced to the temperature in Table 2. Under N2 protection, the corresponding amounts of AA and NaOH with neutralization of 70% were added. After 10min, 0.15 g of APS was added as the initiator, and the reaction was ended after 1 h. The hydrogel (PVA-XG-PAA) was obtained and diluted with water such that the solids content was 1%. To further enhance the wettability of the sample to coal dust, 0.25 vol% of the surfactants SDBS was added considering the compatibility among materials and surface tension (Shi et al., 2019). Then, the double-network hydrogel dust suppressant (PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS) was obtained. The viscosity of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS solution was measured by an NDJ-79 rotational viscometer (Jin et al., 2019). The surface tension of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS solution was measured by a JK99C automatic tension meter (Zhou et al., 2020). Meanwhile, 60 g of coal powder was weighed and placed in a cylindrical mold with a diameter of 5 cm, and 40 mL of the prepared PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was added. After the mixture was stirred uniformly, the mold was placed in a vacuum oven and dried continuously at 50 °C for 5 days. The dust suppressant-solidified coal dust pillars were obtained after demolding. An electronic universal testing machine was used for the standard uniaxial compression test on the coal dust pillars solidified with PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS (Mingyue et al., 2020). The viscosity, surface tension, and uniaxial compression test results of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS with various formulations were comprehensively evaluated, and the optimal preparation process was determined."
4,Characterizations of PVA-XG-PAA,"2.3 Characterizations of PVA-XG-PAA 2.3.1 Fourier infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurement XG, PVA, AA, and the PVA-XG-PAA prepared at the optimal conditions were dried in a 60 °C vacuum oven until their masses were constant. The dried samples were ground with a sand slurry and 200-mesh particles were obtained for measurement. Each of the samples was mixed with KBr, ground and pressed into flakes. The prepared sample was placed in the FTIR spectrometer (Nexus-870 US) for IR measurements. After measurement, the PeakFit and Omnic software packages were used to perform the peak splitting and marking analyses on the obtained spectra to study the changes in the functional groups during reaction process (Sun et al., 2020). 2.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 5–15 mg of the dried PAA gel (solid powder) and PVA-XG-PAA (solid powder) were weighed and placed in Thermoanalyzer (Setaram Labsys Evo, France) to test the thermal stability and thermal decomposition characteristics. The measurement parameters were set as follows: a heating rate of 10 °C/min, a nitrogen flowrate of 50 mL/min, and a temperature range of 30–800 °C (Zhang et al., 2018b)."
5,Dust-suppression performance characterization of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS,"2.4 Dust-suppression performance characterization of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurement 40 ± 0.05 g of coal powder was placed in plastic beakers with similar sizes (a diameter of 4.7 ± 0.01 cm). The prepared PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant, and SDBS surfactant (15±1 mL) were added into the plastic beakers and stirred using a glass rod. The plastic beakers were placed in a 60 °C vacuum oven and dried until the mass was stable. The solid content of each solution in the tests was around 1%wt. Meanwhile, PVA-XG-PAA was dried in a freeze dryer for 24 h. Finally, the completely dried samples were transferred into the Nova Nano SEM (FEI, USA) for imaging (Yan et al., 2020). 2.4.2 Wind erosion resistance test Stacked coal piles in open coal mines are easily affected by wind. Therefore, when used in coal piles, dust suppressants should be resistant to wind erosion which is favorable for dust solidification. In order to verify the practical solidifying effects of the dust suppressant, a small wind tunnel facility was used to perfrom wind erosion tests on coal piles treated by the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, a poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) hydrogel dust suppressant, and a SDBS surfactant solution, respectively. The coal powder used in the test was 45 ± 0.1 g bituminous coal with a diameter of 80–120mesh. The solid contents of the various solutions were all 1% wt and the total usage volume was 3 mL. The solutions were sprayed on the surface of the coal powder and subjected to measurements after natural drying for 36 h. The wind speeds over the different samples were set as 5 m/s, 7 m/s and 9 m/s and lasted for 30min. The masses of the coal piles were measured after each stage (Liu et al., 2017). 2.4.3 Water retention measurements The water retention of a dust suppressant is an important index for evaluating the dust-suppression performance and can ensure the good adhesion of the suppressant on the dust particles before solidifying and reduce damage due to wind erosion. Following procedures in literature (Zhang et al., 2018a), first, an appropriate amount (40 ± 0.05 g) of coal powder was placed in a culture dish (a diameter of 8 ± 0.1 cm). Second, SDBS surfactant, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant and PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS (10 ± 1 mL) were uniformly sprayed on the surface of the coal dust. The solid contents of the various solutions used were 1 wt%. After fully wetting the surface of the coal dust, the culture dish was placed in a programmable constant-temperature and constant-humidity test box at 25 °C. The relative humidity of the chamber was adjusted and maintained at 40%, 60% and 80% to simulate the night environment at an open coal mine. The samples were taken out after a certain period of time. The water retention of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was calculated by the evaporation rate of water per unit area of the coal powder. The calculation formula was as below: (1) E t = W 1 − W 2 A T where, E t denotes the liquid evaporation rate per unit area of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, g.m −2 . s −1 . W 1 denotes the coal powder mass after spraying PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS immediately, g. W 2 denotes the mass of the samples after taken from the test box each time, g. A denotes the area of culture dish, m 2 . T denotes the evaporation time, s. 2.4.4 Determination of degradation rate A glass plate sprayed with the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS (thickness less than 2 mm) was placed in the vacuum oven at 60 °C and dried until the mass was constant. Subsequently, the sample was removed, fully mixed with 300 g soil (a maximum particle size of 270 mm), and placed in a 1000 mL wide-mouth flask. The sample was placed in solid for 10 cycles (each cycle was 5 days) at room temperature (25 °C). The solidified film was removed from the wide-mouth flask after each cycle and dried until the mass was constant. The degradation rates of the solidified film with time were recorded (Mingyue et al., 2020). The program was repeated 3 times and the average value was calculated. The degradation rate after 10 cycles was calculated as below: (2) μ = M 0 − M 1 M 0 × 100 % where, M 0 is the initial mass of the dust suppressant, with units of mg. M 1 is the mass of the dust suppressant after a certain time, with units of mg, and μ is the degradation rate of dust suppressant."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Analysis of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS preparation process,"3.1 Analysis of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS preparation process Viscosity and surface tension are the main indexes for evaluating the performance of a dust suppressant. Owing to the thickening effects of PVA, XG and AA, as the usage amounts increased, the viscosity of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS increased accordingly (Fig. 1 (a,b) and c). However, the quantitative effects of the three components were different. When the added PVA mass increased from 1.1 g to 1.9 g, the added XG mass increased from 0.04 g to 0.12 g and the added AA mass increased from 4 g to 8 g, the viscosity of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS hydrogel increased by 33 mPa s, 26 mPa s and 49 mPa s, respectively. Therefore, the amount of XG was the main factor affecting the viscosity of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS. It can be seen from Fig. 1(d) that, as the temperature increased, the viscosity of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS increased to a certain value and then decreased. When the temperatures lower than 55 °C, the free radical activity increased as the temperature increased, and the reaction possibility between polymer molecules (PVA, XG and AA) and the reaction rate both increased, resulting in a gradual increase in the viscosity. When the temperature reached 55 °C, the viscosity reached a maximum value (45 mPa.s). However, when the temperature was higher than 55 °C, the excessively high temperature accelerated the decomposition of the initiator. The excessively fast decomposition resulted in incomplete reactions between the polymer molecules (PVA, XG and AA), which ultimately resulted in a poor network structure and reduction in viscosity. Compression strength is also a main testing index of the performance of dust suppressant. Fig. 2 (a–d) show the measured compression strengths. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that, as the PVA content increased, the compression strength of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS gradually increased and then tended to flatten. This flattening was because when excess PVA molecules were present, the functional groups formed by the self-overlapping and entangling chains existed independently, but did not interact with the hydrogen bonding of the XG, thus affecting the network structure of the final product and leading to the small variation in the product's compression strength. Considering that the excessively high viscosity of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could plug a water pipe and that the polymer was not easy to extrude, the optimal usage amount of PVA was determined to be 1.5 g by comprehensively analyzing the viscosity, surface tension, and compression strength of the resulting PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS. It can be seen from Fig. 2(b) that, with the increase in the amount of XG, the compressive strength increased to a certain value and then decreased. However, during the experiment, it was found that when the amount of xanthan gum exceeded 0.1 g, it cannot be completely dissolved, and part of the solid powder floated on the surface of the solution. The groups formed by self overlapping and winding of excess XG molecules will exist independently without hydrogen bond interaction with polyvinyl alcohol, which affects the network structure of the final product and led to the decrease of compressive strength. On the other hand, as the AA amount increased, the compression strength of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS gradually increased (Fig. 2(c)). However, due to the cost of AA, and the viscosity and surface tension of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, the optimal amount of AA was selected as 6 g. As the temperature is higher, it is favorable to reducing the activation energy required for the reaction and increasing the reaction rate between polymer molecules (PVA, XG, AA); when the temperature is too high, the free radical reaction rate is too fast and the acrylic acid cannot be fully polymerized, which reduces the average molecular weight of the polyacrylic acid chain and then affects the compressive strength of the final product. Therefore, the compressive strength of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS tends to increase when the temperature is lower than 55 °C, and to decrease when it is higher than 55 °C (Fig. 2(d)). The effects of temperature on viscosity and surface tension also show that 55 °C can maintain a medium hydrogel viscosity and a low surface tension. Therefore, we choose the best reaction temperature to be 55 °C. Based on the above results, the optimal process conditions for preparing PVA-XG-AA/SDBS were obtained as follows: the usage amounts of PVA, AA and XG were 1.5 g, 6 g and 0.1 g, respectively, and the reaction stabilization temperature was 55 °C. According to the measurement results, the viscosity of the formed PVA-XG-AA/SDBS was 45 mPa s; the surface tension was 31 mN/m, and the compression strength was 126 kPa. Compared with the hydrogel dust suppressants studied in the past, the dust suppressant has higher compressive strength, lower viscosity for spraying, and better surface tension, which satisfied the practical dust-suppression requirements in coal mines (Dang et al., 2017; Mingyue et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020)."
8,Characterization analysis of PVA-XG-AA,"3.2 Characterization analysis of PVA-XG-AA 3.2.1 FTIR spectra analysis In order to further verify the intermolecular interactions during the synthesis process of PVA-XG-PAA, the PVA-XG-AA prepared under the optimal process parameters was analyzed by FTIR and the result is shown in Fig. 3 . The region of 3600–3400 cm−1 was attributed to the –OH functional group stretching vibration. As shown in Fig. 3, the –OH group peaks existed at 3420 cm−1 of the PVA spectrum and at 3439 cm−1 in the XG spectrum. In PVA-XG-PAA, the –OH group showed the stretching vibration peak in the range of 3400–3600 cm−1, indicating the interaction between XG and PVA chains. The absorption peak in the XG spectrum at 1067.53 cm−1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of C–H. However, this peak was not found in the FTIR spectrum of the PVA-XG-PAA, indicating that XG had been grafted on to AA chain. The asymmetric C–O stretching vibration peak at 1046 cm−1 and the CH2 bending vibration peak at 846.73 cm−1 in the PVA spectrum could not be found in the FTIR spectrum of PVA-XG-PAA, indicating that the linear PVA chains were interpenetrated into the structure of the product. Thus, it can be seen that interactions among the three polymers of PVA, AA and XG occurred. 3.2.2 TGA analysis The thermal decomposition curves of the samples are shown in Fig. 4 , indicating the PAA and PVA-XG-AA showed similar weight losses during pyrolysis. In Fig. 4(a), PAA was in the dehydration stage between 30°C and 150 °C. The dehydration rate reached the maximum value at 88 °C with a mass loss of 10%. The weight loss during this stage was mainly attributed to the evaporation of free water and crystalline water. Between 150°C and 320 °C, the mass of PAA gradually decreased with a total weight loss of 29%, which was mainly due to the fact that the carboxyl groups in the polymer lose weight by the vaporization of the bound water connected in the form of hydrogen bonds. In the temperature region between 320°C and 500 °C, PAA showed the maximum weight loss stage. The weight loss rate reached the maximum value at 399 °C with a mass loss of 41%. This stage was mainly due to the weight loss of volatiles such as CO2 and H2O produced by the thermal decomposition of the carboxyl groups of PAA. When the temperature was over 500 °C, the TGA curve of PAA flattened tendency as the temperature increased, which mainly resulted from the decomposition and carbonization of the PAA carbon chains. In Fig. 4(b), PVA-XG-AA was in the dehydration stage from 30°C to 160 °C. When the temperature was 80 °C, the maximum dehydration rate was reached with a weight loss of 16%, slightly larger than that measured for the PAA, indicating that the water retention of PVA-XG-AA was better than PAA. Within the range of 150°C–290 °C, the weight loss of PVA-XG-AA was 12%. Within 290°C–550 °C, the PVA-XG-AA entered the maximum weight loss stage. The maximum weight loss rate was reached at 380 °C with a weight loss of 37%. The weight losses during these two stages were both lower than those of the PAA in the corresponding stages, and a large amount of substance remained after high-temperature pyrolysis. Therefore, compared with PAA, PVA-XG-AA had better thermal stability."
9,Analysis of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS dust-suppression performance,"3.3 Analysis of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS dust-suppression performance 3.3.1 SEM images Among them, (a) is the form of raw coal; (b) (c) shows the interaction between PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS and coal dust; (d) (e) is the external form of PVA-XG-PAA; (f) (g) shows the interaction between PAA and coal dust; (h) (i) is the external form of PAA. The gaps between the dust particles in the raw coal were large, and the particle distribution was relatively dispersed (Fig. 5 (a)). After spraying the coal with PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, it can be seen that the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS filled the gaps and the pores of coal dust particles and adhered to the coal dust surface (Fig. 5(c)). By tightly combining with the coal dust, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS formed a solidified film on the surface of coal sample (Fig. 5(b)). The results indicated that PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS showed a strong adhesion effect with the coal dust and could cover the surface to prevent the dispersion of the coal dust. Therefore, the coal dust particles were not easily blown away and the dust-suppression effects were realized. However, after spraying PAA, the coal dust pores were not filled well, and minimal PAA was adhered to the surface (Fig. 5(g)). The surface of the coal remained coarse, and the coal dust did not combine firmly (Fig. 5(f)). Therefore the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was better at solidifying the coal dust than PAA and better at preventing the diffusion of the coal dust. Fig. 5(d) shows the cross-section morphology of PVA-XG-PAA. It can be seen that the cross section contained incompletely closed porous structures, indicating the PVA-XG-PAA had a certain water absorption capacity. Fig. 5(h) shows the cross-section morphology of PAA. There were only a few incompletely closed porous structure and the pore size was small, indicating PAA had a poorer water absorption capacity than PVA-XG-PAA. Fig. 5(e) shows the surface morphology of the PVA-XG-PAA. There were many small bumps, indicating that the PVA-XG-PAA had a certain adhesive property. Meanwhile, there were almost no small bumps on the PAA surface, as shown in Fig. 5(i), which indicated that it had poorer adhesive properties than PVA-XG-PAA (Zhou et al., 2019). 3.3.2 Wind resistance properties Fig. 6 (b–d) shows the morphologies of the coal powder pile treated with PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant and SDBS surfactant, respectively after the wind erosion tests. It can be seen that the morphology of the coal powder pile treated by PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was relatively complete, and there were only few powdered particles overflowing from the cracks in the dust layer. However, the coal powder pile treated with the PAA hydrogel dust suppressant was largely damaged and lost after wind erosion. The coal powder pile treated by SDBS surfactant solution was lost completely in morphology after the wind erosion. Fig. 6(e) shows the residue weights of the coal powder piles treated by PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant and SDBS solution, respectively, after the different stages of the wind erosion test. It can be seen that under the strong wind (9 m/s) erosion conditions, PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS-treated coal powder loss still remained low (6.3%) because the PVA, XG, and PAA molecules in PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS formed a network structure via hydrogen bonding, thereby effectively enhancing the strength of the solidified dust layer. The coal powder treated with the PAA hydrogel dust suppressant showed a small mass loss (6.3% and 13.1%) under weak wind conditions (5 m/s and 7 m/s) and a larger mass loss (27%) under strong wind (9 m/s) erosion conditions, which was due to the lack of adhesion between the PAA and coal dust. The SDBS-treated coal powder pile lost 66.4% of its weight after the 5 m/s wind erosion for 30min and immediately lost 100% mass under the wind rate of 7 m/s, indicating that the conventional dust suppressants do not strongly bind to the coal dust. 3.3.3 Water retention Fig. 7 shows the water retention measurement results for the coal samples treated with the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant, and SDBS solution, espectively. It can be seen that within the first 12 h (a relative humidity was 40%), the evaporation rates of all the coal samples gradually reduced with increasing time. Among them, the evaporation rate of the coal sample using PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was the lowest, showing a 3.87% reduction compared with the sample using the SDBS surfactant. It can be seen from the morphology that the hard shell that formed on the surface of the coal powder continuously expanded until it covered the entire culture dish. This was because the coal structure had a certain hydrophobicity that could drive the water molecules to adhere. After the water evaporated, the surface of the coal powder was loose and the suppression effects were lost. Within the 12–24 h after the measurement (a relative humidity of 60%), the evaporation rates of the coal samples with added PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant, and SDBS surfactant reduced to 0.28%, 1.2% and 2.64%, respectively. Within the 24–36 h after the measurement (a relative humidity of 80%), the evaporation rates of the three coal samples did not changed significantly. After the measurements ended, the evaporation rates of the coal samples with added PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS, PAA hydrogel dust suppressant, and SDBS surfactant were 0.25%, 1.1% and 2.59%, respectively. Therefore, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS sample had the lowest evaporation rate under different humidity conditions and had the best water retention. 3.3.4 Bio-degradability Fig. 8 showed the degradation rate of the solidified PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS film over time. It can be seen from the figure that the degradation rate of the solidified film gradually increased with the time. At the 4th cycle, the degradation rate was 26.8%, while after the 8th cycle the rate was 34%. The degradation rate showed little change in the following cycles and was about 35% after the 10th cycle. During the degradation process, XG was first degraded by microbes. PVA could form peroxides by reacting with the metal salts in soil. The peroxides could damage the molecular chains and result in low molecular weight compounds, further forming polymers with low molecular weights. The microbes degraded the polymers into CO2 and H2O. The results indicated that the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could be degraded in soils, would not generate secondary pollution, and met the criteria for green development concepts. Therefore, PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS is an ideal environmental dust suppressant."
10,Synthesis and dust suppression-mechanisms of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS,"3.4 Synthesis and dust suppression-mechanisms of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS 3.4.1 Synthesis mechanism of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was mainly formed through hydrogen bonding interactions between the PVA, XG, and AA molecules. During the process of slowly and uniformly adding the PVA at a temperature of 85 °C, the flexible PVA molecules extended at the high temperature and uniformly dispersed in the solution (Fig. 9 (b)). Then, an appropriate amount of XG was added slowly and uniformly into the PVA solution and stirred at 75 °C, for 1.5 h. During this process, the flexible polymer chains (PVA) diffused into the structural polymer (XG), and the large numbers of –OH groups in the chemical structure of the two polymers underwent hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 9(d)), thereby forming the first network structure (Fig. 9(c)). Finally, the temperature was reduced to 55 °C and appropriate amounts of AA and NaOH with 70% neutralization were added under N2 protection. After 10min, 0.15 g of APS was added as the initiator, and PVA-XG-PAA was obtained after the reaction was complete in around 1 h. During this process, the AA added into the solution was uniformly dispersed into the first network structure. Then the added APS decomposed into free radicals with the applied heat, which initiated the polymerization of AA, and then the PAA chains were formed. The PAA chains continuously grew during the reaction process, successively penetrating the first layer network structure. The –COOH on the PAA chains interacted with the –OH groups on PVA and XG, forming the second layer of the network structure (Fig. 9(e)). Finally, an appropriate amount of water was added to the obtained PVA-XG-PAA to dilute the solid content to 1% and an appropriate amount of SDBS was added into the diluted solution. After slow stirring for 5min, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was obtained (Fig. 9(f)). 3.4.2 Dust-suppression mechanism of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS Fig. 10 (a) shows the raw coal sample and Fig. 10(b–c) shows the coal samples after adding water. It can be seen from Fig. 10(b–c) that after adding water to the raw coal, the water on the surface of coal dust mainly existed as surface-absorbed water and capillary water (a layer of gas film appeared between water and coal dust). Owing to the hydrophobic structure of coal dust, there was no adhesion between water and dust. Thus, water evaporation is fast after spraying, and water loses its dust-suppression effects. After PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was sprayed on the coal dust particles, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS ensured the wetting, penetration, and adhesion between the coal dust particles. The surfactant (SDBS) contained in PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS system enhanced the hydrophilicity and wettability of the surfaces of the coal dust particles; therefore, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could penetrate and fill the gaps between coal dust particles. The PVA, XG and AA components in the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS contained abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, which could have static electricity with the N-containing functional groups and hydrogen bonding interactions with the oxygen-containing functional groups in the coal. Therefore, PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could combine and solidify the coal dust and enhanced the particle agglomeration. Owing to the heat absorption by the external air, the water absorbed on the surface of coal dust gradually evaporated, thus continuously reducing water content. The hard solidified PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS layer finally formed could retain a certain amount of water, which could prevent the cracking of dried solidification layer, reduce the water evaporation rate, and enhance dust-suppression effect. Finally, the added PVA showed good hydrophilicity, film-forming properties, and degradability, and it has been widely applied in the printing, paper making, and bio-degradation fields. The added XG is a type of natural non-toxic polysaccharides, which is easy to be degraded. The polyacrylic acid gel has good biocompatibility and its monomer acrylic acid is harmless to the human body and can respond to changes in pH in the environment. Therefore, PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS showed the bio-degradable advantage and would not pollute environment, which conformed to concept of green development and was an ideal environment-friendly material."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, a highly efficient, environmentally friendly dust suppressant (PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS) with an interpenetrating double-network structure was prepared utilizing the hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA, XG, and AA polymers. The effects of the amounts of PVA, XG and AA as well as the reaction temperature on the viscosity, surface tension and compression strength of the resulting PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS were studied by single-factor test, and the process conditions were optimized. The detailed conclusions are as follows: 1. By a single-factor test, the effects of the added masses of PVA, XG and AA and the reaction temperature on the performance of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS were studied. The optimal parameters of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS were obtained as: 1.5 g PVA+0.1 g XG+6 g AA+0.15 g APS+0.25% SDBS; the reaction temperature was 55 °C. 2. The PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS was tested under the optimal parameters and the results showed good dust-suppression properties: surface tension of 30 mN/m, viscosity of 45 mPa s, and the compression strength of the dust suppressant solidified coal pillar reached 126 kPa, meaning the coal layer surface after spraying was not easily damaged. 3. According to the SEM images, after spraying, the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could completely fill the gaps between the coal dust particles and bind the dust particles together to form a high-strength solidified film. The resulting dense protective structure could effectively suppress the generation and diffusion of coal dust and achieve the ideal dust-suppression effect. 4. The performance analysis of the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS prepared under the optimal processing conditions indicated that the PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS could maintain its relatively complete morphology under a wind speed of 9 m/s and exhibit a good resistance to wind erosion. The degradation rate of PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS reached 34% after 8th cycles (40 days) of being buried in soil. The results indicated the non-toxic and non-hazardous PVA-XG-PAA/SDBS possessed a certain natural degradability, which conformed to the green development concept and showed good social and economic benefits."
