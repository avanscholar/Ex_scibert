0,Introduction,"Over the forecast decades biocompatible materials play a significant role in the field of biomedical application. The surface modified biomaterials on interaction with the eukaryotic cells enhance the blood compatibility, cell adhesion and cell proliferation [1,2]. For tissue regeneration, the natural and synthetic polymers have been extensively investigated. However, biomaterials derived from natural sources have greater advantages due to their inherent properties which include biological response to cell growth and biodegradation [3,4]. Since the biomaterials are extensively used for tissue engineering applications, it is necessary to study cell proliferative ability, cell adhesion, cytocompatibility properties etc. [5]. Biopolymers and their blends are most prominent materials to be used in the fabrication of tissue engineering composites. By blending and forming porous structures, films with preferred architectonics can be engineered and their mechanical properties can be modulated [6]. Biopolymers (chitosan, alginate, silk, collagen, etc.) are generally used for the fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds [7]. Recently, researchers have studied the fabrication of the biomaterials made up of natural and synthetic polymer using nanofiller as dopant (i.e., the particles having at least one dimension less than 100 nm) to improve the properties of manufactured products [8]. Polymer matrix filled with a range of nanomaterials such as nanospheres, nanotubes, nanoplatelets, etc. are becoming a right platform for tissue regenerative applications [9]. It is also being reported that, modification of biopolymer blend with nanoclay materials increases the mechanical strength of scaffolds and also improves the cell adhesion [10]. Chitosan and Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are natural biomaterials widely used in tissue engineering and biomedical field. Chitosan is composed of β-(1, 4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit) and it is a linear cationic polysaccharide [11,12]. It is derived from chitin and it dissolves completely in dilute acid (pH ˂ 6). However, the high charge density in dilute acid, allows forming ionic interactions between the films, scaffolds, fibres, etc. [13]. Chitosan has been extensively used in the biomedical field due to its high biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-immunogenicity and adsorption properties [14]. Chitosan has wide range of applications in cartilage repair (extracellular matrix), wound healing, tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, immunomodulation and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [15–17]. Halloysite nanotube (HNTs) (Al2Si2O5(OH)4.nH2O) is a naturally occurring aluminosilicate nanoclay biomaterial that can be mined from the natural deposits and amorphous allophone formed through long time weathering [18]. The most abundant HNTs (pure product in thousand tons) comes from the Northland (New Zealand) and Dragon Mine (USA) deposits. The geological condition of smaller scale supply of HNT in Europe, China, Turkey, and Australia [19]. HNTs are compatible in nature, non-toxic and cost effective [20,21]. HNTs can be found in various forms, depending on their origin, such as short tubes, large tubes, and spheroids [22]. HNTs are cylindrical tubes with an external surface composed of siloxane (Si-O-Si) groups, inner side and also the edges consist of Al-OH groups with length ranging 200 to 2000 nm, the outer and inner diameter lies in the range of 50–70 nm and 10–20 nm respectively [23,24]. The basal space (d001) for hydrated and dehydrated halloysite has 10 Ǻ and 7 Ǻ respectively. Due to the weak connection of the interlayer water, hydrated halloysite may be irreversibly converted into the dehydrated type by normally heating at 110 °C temperature [25]. HNTs outer and inner surfaces provide support for selective modification which helps in the uniform dispersion in the polar polymers such as epoxy, polyamides, polyethyleneimine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylates and biopolymers such as polysaccharides pectin, starch, and chitosan. HNTs also disperse uniform with medium and low polarity polymers such as polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and polypropylene [8,26,27]. HNTs are promising fillers for the manufacture of tissue-based scaffolds derived from biogenic and synthetic polymers [28]. HNTs, when incorporated onto the polymer matrix, will influence cell viability, proliferation, and adhesion [29]. HNTs are also used for drug delivery system [30,31]. The pectin matrix filled with HNTs for application in food packaging and also HNTs loaded with lysozyme and PCL have been used for antimicrobial packaging membrane [32]. In particular, HNTs doped with chitosan/gelatin/agarose porous scaffolds improve the cell proliferation [33]. Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic biomaterial used for tissue engineering and wound dressing [34]. It is a water-soluble, non-toxic polymer exhibiting a good mechanical strength, flexibility, and film-forming properties [35]. PVA is highly hydrophilic in nature due to which PVA based scaffolds or films exhibit poor cell adhesion property, which can be improved by reinforcing with HNTs [36]. In this work, surface functionalization of HNTs with chitosan to enhance the properties of HNTs. Further, these nanofiller was incorporated into the PVA matrix to render better dispersion of functionalized HNTs. PVA nanocomposite films were fabricated by using solution casting technique. The effects of different weight percent of HNTs on the functional and physicochemical properties of the developed films were determined in terms of thermal stability, mechanical properties, crystallinity, swelling ratio, and enzyme degradation. The fabricated films were further subjected to cell line studies for tissue engineering applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were received from Natural Nano Inc., USA (density 2.5 g/cm3). The tubular structure with outer and inner diameter was found to be 100–120 nm and 60–80 nm respectively, with lengths varying from 500 nm to 1.2 μm. Chitosan was supplied by Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. with degree of deacetylation 85%, viscosity 150–500 m. Pas. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [-CH2CHOH-]n with degree of hydrolysis 86.50–89.00 mol%, Molecular weight ~1,60,000, viscosity 27–33 cP was purchased from HiMedia, India. Remaining chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of the surface functionalization of halloysite nanotubes with chitosan HNTs functionalized with chitosan, by using the optimized procedure reported by M. Liu, et al., and S. Sheik et al., [37,38] with slight modifications. Before processing, the HNTs were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h in order to remove the moisture content. In a reflux condenser attached to a thermostatic bath at a steady temperature, the dried HNTs were later acylated using succinic anhydride in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) at 75 °C for 7 h. After acylation, the nanotube samples were washed with DMF followed by acetone wash at 55 °C for two to three times in order to remove unreacted anhydrides and then the samples were rinsed with distilled water and dried in an oven. The chitosan was eventually functionalized in acetic acid condition and the nanotubes were filtered and dried. The weight gain percentage of the nanotubes was calculated by the difference in the weight gain of the acylated and the functionalized HNTs, which was around 21%. 2.2.2 Functionalized HNTs reinforced nanocomposite films The functionalized powder (f-HNTs) was used for the preparation of films. The nanocomposite films were prepared by solution casting technique. Different weight percent of PVA solutions were prepared with constant stirring and functionalized powder was ultra-sonicated for 30 min, finally both the solutions were mixed and stirred for 8 h at room temperature. The solutions were ultra-sonicated for 30 min. to prevent agglomeration of functionalized nanotubes and to achieve uniform dispersion in the PVA matrix. Double distilled water was used as a solvent throughout the preparation of films. The solutions were poured into the petri-dish and dried in an oven at 50 °C. Then the films were peeled off from petri-dish and stored in desiccators until further use. The composition (w/w %) of nanocomposite films is as shown in Table 1 . 2.2.3 Characterization and measurements 2.2.3.1 Fourier transformer infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) The interaction among the films and the nanotubes was successfully examined with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectrometer (FTIR-ATR Prestige-21 Shimadzu, Japan). IR spectra of the samples were recorded in the wave number ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1. 2.2.4 Thermal analysis Both TGA and DSC data for prepared CT-f-HNTs/PVA films were recorded using Universal thermal analyser (SDT Q600-WATERS). Approximately about 6–8 mg of film samples were heated in an aluminium pan from room temperature to 800 °C, in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 10 °C/min. Crystallinity (%) of the polymer samples was calculated from following equation. (1) X c % = ∆ H m − ∆ H c ∆ H 0 m 1 − wt × 100 where ∆Hm = Melting enthalpy, ∆Hc = Crystallization enthalpy, ∆H0 m = Melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline sample (∆H0 m = 138.6 J g−1) and wt = weight fraction of the filler in the nanocomposites. 2.2.5 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis Powder XRD pattern was recorded for the nanocomposite film samples using Rigaku Mini Flex600 bench top. The radiation was generated from copper-ka (λ = 1.5406 A0) source at 40 kV and 35 mA was used to scan samples between 0° to 80° with a scan rate of 2°/min. The percentage of crystallinity and average crystallite size (Scherrer's equation) was calculated from WAXD data as follows, (2) Percentage crystallinity Xc % = Ac Ac + Aa × 100 (3) Crystallite size P = kλ βcosθ Percentage of crystallinity (Xc%) is measured as ratio of the crystalline area to the total area. Where, Ac = Area of crystalline phase, Aa = Area of amorphous phase. Xc% = Percentage of crystallinity, k = 0.9 is constant that is related to the shape of the crystal and the Miller index of the reflecting crystallographic planes and crystallite shape. θ is the Bragg's angle, λ = 1.5406 A0 wavelength of the X-ray radiation, and β is width at half maximum intensity of the reflection in radians. 2.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis The modification and dispersion of nanotubes in the matrix was examined using SEM (ZEISS-SIGMA) at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Prior to the analysis of the film, samples were sputter-coated with a 5 nm conductive layer of gold to avoid charging under high electron beam. The film samples were fixed and mounted on the conductive carbon tape. 2.2.7 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) The surface topography of the prepared samples was tested using AFM (Nanosurf Easy Scan2, FLEX-AXIOM AFM). The topographic images were captured under tapping mode in air and resonance frequency of 320 kHz was used for recording the surface topography and surface roughness of the nanocomposite films. 2.2.8 Mechanical properties Universal testing machine (UTM, LLOYD Instrument) was used to determine the mechanical properties. Tensile strength, Young's modulus and Elongation at break were measured according to the ASTM standard method D882-91. Test samples of size 2.5 cm width and 10 cm length were cut from the films. The test samples were stretched to a rate of cross-speed 5 mm/min at room temperature. The strain energy was calculated by following formula (K. J. Dusoe. et al.) [39]: (4) U = σ 2 2 E × V where, σ = stress, E = Young's Modulus and V = Volume of body. 2.2.9 Water contact angle To understand the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the film surface, contact angle measurements were conducted using contact angle analyser (SEO Phoenix). The measurements were conducted at ambient room temperature and the size of the drop was 7 μL with all measured probe liquids. Contact angle calculations were done using associated software. 2.2.10 Swelling ratio To measure the swelling behaviour of nanocomposite films, samples were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm size and then immersed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH-7.4) at 37 °C. The film samples were taken out at predetermined time intervals and the excess surface adhered water drops were removed by gently blotting the films with filter paper. Then the films were weighed immediately (Wd) and the swelling ratio was calculated by following formula: (5) SR % = W w − W d W w × 100 Here, SR is the degree of swelling ratio, and Ww and Wd represents the wet and dry weights of the films, respectively. 2.2.11 In-vitro enzymatic degradation The enzymatic degradation nature of the nanocomposite films was determined as a percentage of weight loss after incubation in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) in presence of lysozyme (egg albumen) for 21 days at 37 °C. The samples (1 cm × 1 cm) were immersed in the PBS containing enzyme lysozyme (1 mg/1 ml)l and the solution was changed at different intervals to ensure the complete removal of degraded or dissolved contents. At different intervals of time (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days), the samples were removed and dried for about 2 h at 50 °C. The percentage degradation was calculated by following equation: The dried samples were weighed as final weight after degradation (Wf), initial dry weight (Wi) and percentage degradation was calculated by following equation: (6) Percentage degradation % = W i − W f W i × 100 2.2.12 Assessment of cell proliferation 2.2.12.1 Cells and culture conditions Mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells were procured from National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune. They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic solution. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere and were used for the experiments at least after three consecutive passages. 2.2.12.2 Trypan blue dye exclusion assay for cell viability Cells were seeded onto 60 mm culture dishes at a seeding density of 25,000 cells/dish. After adherence, polymer nanocomposites were placed in the wells. 24 h post-incubation with test materials, cells were trypsinized. 10 μL of cell suspension was mixed with an equal amount of trypan blue dye and loaded onto haemocytometer. The number of viable cells was recorded. Percentage cell proliferation was assessed as a measure of the cell count. For assessing the cellular morphology and confluence, photomicrographs were captured using Zeiss Axiocam attached to an inverted microscope (CarlZeiss, Germany) from both treated as well as control groups. 2.2.12.3 Acridine orange-ethidium bromide (AO-EB) staining for cell viability and adhesion NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 24 well plates containing the test films at a seeding density of 10,000cells/well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 conditions for 24 h for cell adherence. Spent medium was removed and the cells were fixed using chilled methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and stained using AO-EB mixture (2 μg/mL; 1:1 ratio) at 37 °C for 15 min under dark conditions. Excess stain was removed using PBS wash, cells were overlaid with PBS and photomicrographs were captured under green and red channels using a fluorescence imager (ZOE, BioRad). 2.2.13 Hemocompatibility assay The hemolysis assay was performed for the nanocomposite films to know the percentage of hemolysis caused by films when they come in contact with fresh human blood sample. Around 5 ml blood sample was collected from healthy volunteers. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm at room temperature for about 10 min, then the supernatants i.e. plasma and leucocytes were carefully removed and packed red blood cell pellets was washed three times in sterilized physiological saline (0.9% NaCl). Then, the blood sample was washed and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm until the clear suspension was obtained. The films with the dimension of 1 cm × 1 cm were immersed in the normal saline and kept for incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. Then, 200 μl of the blood sample and 200 μl test sample was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Further, 4 ml of physiological saline was added to stop hemolysis, and these samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The complete hemolysis of RBC in distilled water and RBC without film samples in sterilized physiological saline were used as positive control and negative control respectively. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured with a UV–Visible spectrophotometer at 540 nm. The percentage of hemolysis was determined by the following equation. (7) Percentage of hemolysis % = Test sample abs − Negative control abs Positive control abs − Negative control abs × 100 2.2.14 Statistical analysis Data is implemented as Mean ± S.D. Measurements were carried out in triplicates. Using graph pad prism version 5.0 software a differentiation between groups was analysed. P < 0.05 has been accepted as statistically significant."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Fourier transformer infra-red spectroscopic (FT-IR) analysis,"3.1 Fourier transformer infra-red spectroscopic (FT-IR) analysis FT-IR analysis was carried out to confirm the structural changes like surface modification of Halloysite nanotubes by chitosan functionalization in the infrared region. FT-IR spectra of pure HNTs powder shows characteristic peaks around 3695 cm−1 and 3624 cm−1 which were attributed to the inner surface and inner Al-OH stretching [40]. The peaks observed at 1118 cm−1 and 999 cm−1 assigned for in-plane SiO stretching as well as OH deformation of inner hydroxyl groups at 904 cm−1, Si-O-Si symmetric stretching at 794 cm−1 and Si-O-Al perpendicular stretching at 748 cm−1 [41]. For the acylated HNTs, intense peak was observed at 1674 cm−1 is due to the CO stretching [42]. After chitosan functionalizing, the new peaks were observed at 3350 cm−1 and 3312 cm−1 attributed to OH and NH stretching as well as relative CO stretching at 1528 cm−1[43]. The HNTs characteristic peaks are not much changed compared with chitosan functionalized HNTs which indicates that there is no structural changes in the HNTs and the functionalization occurred on the surface of the HNTs as shown in the Fig. 1a. In the FT-IR spectra of pure PVA, a broad peak was observed at 3335 cm−1 due to non-bonded stretching OH group. The peak appeared at 2939 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1 were due to the CH broad alkyl stretching. The peak observed at 1716 cm−1 is attributed to CO stretching. The peaks recorded at 1431 cm−1 and 842 cm−1 are assigned to the CH bending vibration and CH rocking [44,45]. The absorption peaks at 1253 cm−1 and 1085 cm−1 is attributed to CC stretching and CO of PVA. After reinforcement of functionalized HNTs in PVA composite films, the reduction of the intensity of OH peaks was observed, which suggested that hydrogen bonding existed between O-H/N-H/C=O groups of the PVA and chitosan functionalized HNTs respectively (Fig. 1b). [46]. There was no prominent shift in the functional group of characteristic peaks."
6,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal stability and weight loss behaviour of HNTs, Ac-HNTs and CT-f-HNTs was evaluated using TGA. TGA curve for pure HNTs and Ac-HNTs showed two step degradation, the initial step occurred at 50–100 °C this could be due to the desorption of water and second step observed in the range 400–600 °C was due to dehydroxylation of structural Al-OH group [47]. The TGA curve for CT-f-HNTs showed three step degradation in comparison with HNTs and second step degradation around 100–400 °C due to the functionalization of chitosan. The weight loss of HNTs at 600 °C was 11.99%. The acylation step obtained the weight loss of 12.23% at 600 °C. After functionalization, the weight loss at 600 °C was found to be 22.05% as shown in the Fig. 2a. Similar results were reported by M. Liu, et al. [43] thus, it confirms the functionalization of chitosan on the surface of the HNTs. The thermogram of pure PVA films showed three step degradation. The first step degradation recorded at 80–150 °C with a weight loss of 7.02% could be due to removal of moisture from the sample. Followed by the first step the second step degradation showed major weight loss of 74.77% in the temperature range 250–400 °C due to the structural degradation followed by chain scissions in PVA. Further, third step degradation appears above 400 °C due to the decomposition of carbonaceous matter [48]. Because of the higher thermal stability of HNTs, even the addition of small amount of HNTs improves the thermal stability of nanocomposite films [49]. The second degradation step observed for 1 wt% showed weight loss of 70.37% at 250–400 °C which showed decreased weight loss compared to PVA. In addition, second degradation step observed for 2 wt% to 5 wt% showed weight loss of about 65.53–57.94% at 250–400 °C which showed further decrease in the weight loss as represented in Table 2a. Thus, degradation pattern observed with incorporation of chitosan functionalized HNTs showed improved thermal stability due to the barrier effect of inorganic filler and also due to interactions with HNTs and PVA matrix [50] as shown in the Fig. 2b."
7,Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis,"3.3 Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis DSC thermogram can be used to understand phase transitions in the nanocomposite films. Melting temperature, melting enthalpy (∆Hm) and crystallization enthalpy (∆Hc) are the parameters pertaining to the polymer, which indicates the nanofiller effect in the matrix. The melting temperature (Tm) for PVA was observed at 191 °C [51]. With the inclusion of nanofiller in the matrix, Tm increased marginally but no major changes were observed with an increase in the wt% of CT-f-HNTs [52]. The melting and crystallization enthalpy decreases with an increase in wt% of CT-f-HNTs as depicted in Fig. 2c and Table 2b [53]. The results obtained from the DSC thermogram may probably be attributed to the synergetic effect provided by the functional PVA groups and the nanoscale dimension of the functionalized HNTs. The percentage of the crystallinity was measured by enthalpy. The crystallinity percentage obtained for PVA was 18%. After nanofiller addition, crystallinity of films enhanced from 18.34% to 20.29% for 1 wt% to 5 wt% respectively. The obtained results indicate that, nanotubes act as nucleating agents and thereby increase the crystallinity. The DTG curves represent the degradation temperature of the peaks of the pristine PVA and its nanocomposite films [Fig. 2(d)]. The degradation temperature shifted to higher temperature compare to pristine PVA as represented in Table 2b."
8,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of pure HNTs. The observed peaks are indexed with the characteristic of halloysite peaks in JCPDS data (JCPDS 29-1487) [54]. The diffraction (2θ) peaks for HNTs were observed at 11.51° (001), 19.84° (100), 24.42° (002), 34.76° (110), 38.09° (003), 54.09° (210) and 62.32° (300). The diffraction peak at 11.51° (001) corresponds to layer spacing of 0.76 nm. After functionalizing, the diffraction peaks are not much altered, but due to the modification, a slight shift in the 2θ occurs. The diffraction 2θ peaks of CT-f-HNTs were observed at 12.25° (001) corresponding layer spacing decreases from 0.76 nm to 0.72 nm (Fig. 3a). Similar results were reported by P. Sun, et al. [47] this indicates that surface modification of HNTs with chitosan has occurred without changing its structure. The Fig. 3b depicts XRD pattern of pure PVA showing sharp and broad diffraction 2θ peak at 19.33°, a weak and low intensity diffraction (2θ) peak was observed at 22.15° and 40.0°. The peaks are the characteristic peaks of pure PVA which corresponds to the reflections of the (101), (200) and (111) planes of the monoclinic unit cell respectively, and also corresponds to semicrystalline nature of PVA [55]. After, reinforcing the functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix, the nanocomposite films showed relative shifts in the 2θ values and decrease in the intensity due to strong molecular interaction between the polymer chains and CT-f-HNTs. Further, the percentage of crystallinity obtained for PVA was found to be 53.78%. However, the crystallinity obtained for nanocomposite films of 1 wt% to 5 wt% was 57.24% to 71.02% as shown in the Table 3 . This indicated an increase in the percentage of crystallinity as the percentage of CT-f-HNTs increase due to interaction and molecular arrangement in the polymer chain. Nevertheless, percent crystallinity values found in XRD are much higher than that of DSC method. Observed lower crystallinity in DSC is probably due to the structural inhomogeneity caused by temperature or stress gradients during the thermal analysis. However, the trend is almost similar to that observed in XRD analysis."
9,Morphological analysis,"3.5 Morphological analysis 3.5.1 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) The phase morphology of pristine HNTs was observed through SEM images; HNTs have tubular structures of variable sizes in the bulk sample rather than the surface as indicated in the Fig. 4 . With addition of succinic anhydride, the surface of the HNTs showed more uniform dispersion due to small changes on the surface of HNTs. However, the structure was not much altered [56]. After functionalization with chitosan, the surface was aggregated due to an interfacial interaction among the chitosan and acylated HNTs. The results were observed and confirmed with EDS. The phase morphology of the nanocomposite films prepared was examined by FESEM with EDS to confirm the nanotube dispersion. The phase morphology of the pure PVA matrix showed smooth uniformity on the surface. Later, incorporation of functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix triggered the uniform dispersion of nanotubes in the matrix with smaller agglomeration during evaporation of the solvent through film [57]. The low wt% of functionalized HNTs loaded in the matrix revealed the uniform dispersion with individual HNTs and small aggregation in it. The 5 wt% of functionalized HNTs loaded in the matrix showed uniform dispersion with more agglomeration in it [38]. As the wt% percentage of CT-f-HNTs increase, the percentage of Al and Si increases which was confirmed through EDS. The nanotube dispersion in the matrix was obtained due to the strong interfacial interaction between functionalized HNTs and PVA. 3.5.2 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) Atomic force microscopy was performed to determine the surface topographic view of prepared polymer nanocomposite films. The three different shades were indicated in the AFM images: black area represents an amorphous phase; light and dark brown coloured areas referring to crystalline phases, white and yellow areas entirely and partially embedded HNTs are often aligned with the interfacial regions between functionalized HNTs and PVA matrices as seen in Fig. 5 . The pristine PVA matrix showed average roughness (Ra) and root mean square roughness (Rq) of 3.67 nm and 2.07 nm, respectively. Further, increasing the content of CT-f-HNTs from 1 to 5 wt%, surface roughness linearly increases with increase in the weight i.e. Ra from 3.67 nm to 25.0 nm and Rq from 2.07 nm to 18.9 nm respectively. This phenomenon could be due to the interaction between the functionalized HNTs and PVA matrix. Thus, overall surface roughness of nanocomposite increases compared to pristine PVA matrix [58]. The low content of CT-f-HNTs showed good dispersion in the PVA matrix due to less aggregation which was further supported by the surface roughness of nanocomposite film. At lower wt%, a more uniformity in HNTs dispersion and homogenous morphology was obtained due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between nanofiller and matrix [59,60]. AFM results were corroborated with the results of SEM."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.6 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of prepared polymer nanocomposite films were determined by using universal tensile machine. The mechanical behaviour of the PVA nanocomposites depends on the interfacial adhesion between the polymer matrix and incorporated nanofiller and also depends on uniform dispersion and distribution of nanofiller in the matrix [61]. The mechanical properties of the pristine PVA and nanocomposites reinforced with chitosan functionalized HNTs are presented in Fig. 6a. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of pristine PVA was observed at 11.501 ± 0.612 MPa and 93.432 ± 0.543 MPa respectively. Further, with the addition of chitosan functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix, both tensile strength and Young's modulus increased with increasing wt% of functionalized HNTs (Fig. 6b, c). The tensile strength and Young's modulus of 1 wt%–5 w% is displayed at 16.305 ± 0.416 MPa–18.212 ± 0.324 MPa and 101.578 ± 0.452 MPa–145.842 ± 0.327 MPa respectively. Compared to the neat PVA, it shows linear increase in the tensile strength and Young's modulus which is due to interfacial interaction (presence of –OH group) between the incorporated functionalized HNTs and PVA matrix [62]. However, on increasing the wt% of functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix, we achieved uniform distribution. Although, a small amount of aggregation was observed in the SEM images at a higher concentration. This aggregation was negligible because of uniform distribution which resulted in an effective transfer of load between polymer chains and nanofiller. The percentage elongation at break was enhanced compared with neat PVA and films were more flexible. It means added nanofiller significantly affect the elongation at break in the PVA matrix. The percent elongation at break was enhanced from PVA and it was surprisingly an advantageous trend observed without losing its ductile nature (Fig. 6d). The % E for PVA −39.77 ± 0.51%, 1 wt% −73.26 ± 0.32%, 3 wt% −58.368 ± 0.43% and 5 wt% −63.844 ± 0.16% respectively. Similar results were reported by H. Aloui, et al. which may be due to flexibility of the films [63]. The strain energy calculated was increased from PVA which could be cohesive in strength of the material and also depends on the ductility nature of the polymer [64]. The strain energy is nothing but the energy stored during the deformation processes in polymeric material under mechanical stress [39]. The strain energy obtained for PVA, 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% i.e. 11.130 × 108 J, 24.610 × 108 J, 17.339 × 108 J and 21.974 × 108 J respectively (Table 4 ). The results obtained for strain energy were correlated with %E in which the similar trends were observed for PVA and its nanocomposite films. Since, the prepared nanocomposite films have elongation feasibility and enhanced stored energy [65–67]. The results were in good agreement with SEM and AFM which revealed the uniform dispersion of nanofiller in the matrix due to the increased root mean square and average surface roughness."
11,Water contact angle,"3.7 Water contact angle The surface wettability of pristine PVA and its nanocomposite films were measured using water contact angle analyser in order to obtain the hydrophilic nature of the film surface. The water contact angle of pristine PVA and nanocomposite films is shown in the Fig. 7 . It is well-known that water contacts angle ˂90° means hydrophilic in nature and ˃90° means hydrophobic in nature [68]. Based on the literature review, pristine PVA is a highly water soluble polymer and has a very low water contact angle of 40.0° and is highly hydrophilic in nature. Further, addition of functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix has appreciable enhancement in the water contact angle from 46.1° (1 wt%) to 73.0° (5 wt%). This indicates that hydrophilic nature of film surface decreased due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between matrix and nanofiller [69]. The results were in good agreement with the swelling and AFM study, in which PVA showed higher swelling ratio and lower surface roughness (high hydrophilic in nature), while nanocomposite films showed lower swelling ratio and higher surface roughness (less hydrophilic in nature)."
12,Swelling ratio,"3.8 Swelling ratio In vitro study of swelling behaviour is a prospective evaluation for the biomaterial. Fig. 8 shows the swelling ratio of pure PVA and its nanocomposite films in PBS media at different time intervals [70]. At 30 min, the films showed swelling ratios (%) in the range of 336.0 ± 0.51–232.01 ± 0.96. With an increase in the time interval, all the nanocomposite films exhibited an increasing trend in the swelling ratio. The swelling ratio of pure PVA increased from 336.0 ± 0.51 for 30 min to 501.10 ± 0.28 for 180 min. The swelling ratio of the nanocomposite films decreased with increase in the weight percent of functionalized-HNTs, compared to pure PVA. The decrease in the swelling ratio might be due to physical interaction between filler (CT-f-HNTs) and matrix (PVA) because of the hydroxyl group interaction between them. Hydrogen bonds formed between the matrix and filler will prevent the buffer solution from destroying the hydrogen bonds and also HNTs form a nanocomposite denser network to block the swelling of the films due to appreciable influence of filler in the matrix [46]. Due to an increase in the surface roughness of the films, the swelling ratio showed a descending order. The hydrophilic nature of the nanocomposite films may lead to enhancement in the cell attachment and proliferation in the tissue regeneration process [60]."
13,Enzymatic degradation,"3.9 Enzymatic degradation In vitro, enzymatic degradation behaviour of pristine PVA and its nanocomposite films was investigated as a measure of weight loss in PBS in presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme enzyme over 21 days [71]. It is observed that the percentage of degradation of weight loss for all the films increased with an increase in time. Pure PVA exhibited weight loss (%) of about 3.64 ± 0.32 on 1st day. However, in the nanocomposite films, the percentage of weight loss slightly increased from 5.84 ± 0.14 to 9.28 ± 0.42 for 1 wt% to 5 wt% films at day 1. After the addition of chitosan functionalized halloysite nanotubes, the degradation process was accelerated as compared to pristine PVA. The degradation percentage in terms of weight loss increased from 1 wt% to 5 wt%. This is due to the presence of a hydrophilic nature of PVA as well as specific interaction between lysozyme and chitosan for enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosides bond cleavage [72]. It is also attributed to the primary degradation of the films because of the polymer chain breakage while HNTs did not completely degrade in PBS solution due to the enzymatic hydrolysis between PVA: Chitosan/HNTs. The nanocomposite films showed slightly higher degradation than pristine PVA [73]. The enzymatic degradation percentage of PVA on the 21st day was observed up to 33.33 ± 0.53 whereas 5 wt% nanocomposite films showed up to 49.59 ± 0.63 as depicted in Fig. 9 . The results were compared with swelling ratio, the hydrophilic nature of PVA showed a higher percentage of swelling that could be due to the high mobility of molecules. Overall, the enzymatic degradation for PVA observed was a lower degradation compared to nanocomposite films. Therefore, the films require a longer time for enzymatic degradation which can be placed perfectly in tissue engineering application."
14,Trypan blue dye exclusion assay for cell viability and proliferation,"3.10 Trypan blue dye exclusion assay for cell viability and proliferation The cell viability was determined using Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The assay is based on the principle that when cells are mixed with trypan blue, only dead cells take up the blue stain due to the ruptured cell membrane. Healthy and viable cells do not take up the dye and appear transparent, when viewed under the microscope [74]. Thus the viability of cells can be obtained. The cell counts of the NIH3T3 fibroblast cells treated with PVA and functionalized HNTs reinforced PVA films is represented in Table 5 . After incubation, the cells displayed spindle shaped morphology and proliferated quickly and grew into small colonies by fixing firmly to the film substrates. From the cell counts, it is evident that all concentrations of nanocomposite films promoted cell growth and proliferation, similar results were reported by W.Y. Zhou, et al., [36]. Only viable cells were observed in the control as well as film treated fibroblasts. The percentage of proliferation was found to be concentration dependent, with 5 wt% reinforced film showing the highest cell counts. The cells were viable in all the groups. Photomicrographs of the mouse fibroblasts growing on PVA and nanocomposite films of different concentrations are depicted in Fig. 10 . From the images, it is clear that the confluence of the cells was more in the film treated cells compared to PVA treated cells. The typical fibroblastic morphology of the cells indicated the cytocompatibility of the tested nanocomposite films. HNTs incorporated chitosan films increased the cell number and confluence, which appeared with longer filopodia in the presence of HNTs than on chitosan alone [75]. Therefore, the chitosan functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix enhances cell growth and are non-toxic. The results have collaborated with the AFM analysis. The increased surface roughness obtained for the films provides the cells with more surface area to bind to, and also encouraged cell growth compared to the comparatively smooth pristine film, similar results were reported by M. Liu, et al., [37]. The addition of HNTs into polymers such as PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) and chitosan showed biocompatibility effect of the polymers. From the obtained cell morphology result, one can conclude that the nanocomposite films of chitosan functionalized HNTs/PVA can be used in tissue engineering as supporting material. 3.10.1 Cell adhesion studies Biomaterials used for tissue engineering applications can promote cell adhesion, followed by cell proliferation [76]. Images of the NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells growing on the PVA as well as nanocomposite films are represented in the Fig. 11 . Cells were found to be viable as indicated by the green fluorescence. Cell adhesion plays a crucial role in the complex interaction of the cells and the regulation of certain physiological processes [77]. Fibroblasts displayed good cell adhesive and proliferative behaviour in all tested concentrations of nanocomposite films. No cells took up ethidium bromide stain (red channel), indicating the viable nature of the cells. The test films were found to promote cell adhesion compared to PVA. This could be attributed to PVA for poor cell attachment capacity due to its highly hydrophilic nature [78]. When PVA is incorporated with functionalized HNTs with a biopolymer such as chitosan, the interactions and spreading on the films enhanced, the reason is ascribed to the HNTs. Due to surface roughness of the film, the cells attached towards HNTs on a rough surface than a smooth surface [58]. The results confirmed the biocompatible nature and are directly affecting cellular behaviour in terms of adhesion and proliferation of nanocomposite films. Also it confirmed the ideal nature of the tested material in biomedical applications like tissue regeneration."
15,Hemocompatibility,"3.11 Hemocompatibility Hemolysis occurs due to the destruction of red blood cells, in which cells swell to critical bulk leading to the lysis of cell membrane. These broken red platelets can release adenosine diphosphate that raises the accumulation of blood platelets, which quickens the formation of coagulation and thrombus [79]. Since it is necessary to study the blood compatibility of the nanocomposite films based biomaterials, which is based on the specific contact between erythrocytes and red blood cells with the biomaterial surface. It is clear that red platelets hemolysis when interacting with water and when an incompatible substance interacts with these cells, and that issue escalates the hemolysis. Hemolysis assay was studied for PVA and nanocomposite films, with positive control and negative control. Positive and negative control used were distilled water and physiological saline. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of hemolysis of PVA and its nanocomposite film. According to national biological safety, hemolysis below 5% is considered as nonhemolytic [80,81]. In comparison with the pristine PVA film, all the nanocomposite film samples showed a lower percentage of hemolysis. The highest and lowest percentage of hemolysis was exhibited for PVA (3.607 ± 0.051) and 5 wt% (0.601 ± 0.012) respectively [82]. 5 wt% film was observed to be more compatible with blood cells then the remaining film samples. The results thus obtained showed hemolysis below 5% which does not damage the cell membrane and so the prepared films are suitable for hemocompatibility applications."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, it is a simple method for increasing HNTs bioactivity by functionalizing it with a natural polysaccharide like chitosan. The nanocomposite films were successfully prepared by the solution casting technique and characterized by different instrumental techniques. The study confirmed the chitosan functionalizing on the HNTs surface reinforced the PVA films. It was observed that with increase in the concentration of the functionalized HNTs, the uniform dispersion and also roughness of the films increased as revealed by the AFM and SEM studies. The mechanical and thermal properties were enhanced after the incorporation of functionalized HNTs in the PVA matrix. Through XRD, the degree of crystallinity of the films enhanced with the increase in the weight percent of the functionalized HNTs. Meanwhile, the results of contact angle analysis, swelling ratio and in vitro enzymatic degradation study assembled that, the films were hydrophilic in nature, exhibited decreased swelling ratio and improved with the addition of functionalized HNTs. Further, the films were tested for in vitro biocompatibility using mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. The results showed excellent proliferation and adhesion even at a low concentration of functionalized HNTs. Hemocompatibility assay demonstrated that all the films showed less than 5% hemolysis, indicating their compatibility with the biological systems. Thus the prepared films can be promising materials for biomedical applications with special emphasis on tissue engineering."
