0,Introduction,"1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is a chemical with a wide range of commercial applications, including biodegradable polyester materials, food additives, and raw material in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors (Sun et al., 2018). The earliest reference of 1,3-PD biosynthesis from glycerol (Gly) fermentation was made 140 years ago (Dietz and Zeng, 2014). In the current context, the production of 1,3-PD from Gly is linked to numerous advantages because a gallon of Gly is generated for every ten gallons of biodiesel produced (Crosse et al., 2020). As a result, rising biodiesel production makes market absorption of Gly impracticable (Crosse et al., 2020). On the other hand, the yearly price for 1,3-PD is expected to rise by up to 14% through 2027 (Zhu et al., 2021). Therefore, the redirection of Gly for 1,3-PD generation could add value to the biodiesel production chain. In dark fermentation systems, the microorganisms metabolize Gly through reductive and oxidative branches (Xiu et al., 2007). The energy produced in the oxidative pathway during the fermentation of Gly into acetic (AcH), butyric (BuH), and lactic (LaH) acids is expended on cell growth (Xiu et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2021). Also, reducing equivalents (named NADH2, NADH, or NADRed) formed on the oxidative pathway are applied in the biosynthesis of 1,3-PD in the reductive pathway (Zhu et al., 2021). The maximum 1,3-PD recovery from Gly (72%) is observed when AcH is formed as co-metabolite (Pflügl et al., 2012). Otherwise, when a co-substrate is applied to Gly fermentation, the Gly can skip oxidative and biomass formation branches and be redirected 100% for 1,3-PD production (see the metabolic pathway of co-fermentation in Fig. S1, Supplementary Material) (Xiu et al., 2007). Glucose, arabinose, xylose, and cactus cladode hydrolysate have all been used as co-substrates in 1,3-PD production studies (Pflügl et al., 2012; Vivek et al., 2018; Yun et al., 2021; de Santana et al., 2021). To date, however, sugarcane vinasse (SV) has not been used as a co-substrate in Gly fermentation for this purpose. The use of residues as co-substrates in Gly fermentation appears to be a cost-effective alternative, but it may introduce new issues for bioprocesses, such as microorganism selection (Sun et al., 2018). The biosynthesis of 1,3-PD has been performed mainly by pure cultures and co-cultures (Ainala et al., 2013; Pflügl et al., 2012; Vivek et al., 2016). Pure culture can increase production yields, but it raises procedure costs due to the necessity for sterilization (Ainala et al., 2013; Vivek et al., 2016). Besides, the fermentation of complex substrates requires the energy of different enzyme systems for their degradation. In this regard, mixed cultures can be a promising alternative to replacing pure culture because the joint effort of different microorganisms can increase the degradation of complex carbon sources, and no sterilization is required (Zhu et al., 2021). On the other hand, they may necessitate adjusting operating conditions (fermentation type, pH, and temperature) to increase 1,3-PD yields (Dahiya and Mohan, 2021; Veras et al., 2019). Among the types of fermentation (batch, fed-batch, and continuous), continuous fermentation with immobilized culture can result in greater productivity of 1,3-PD. Continuous fermentation in a high-rate reactor, such as an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR), can facilitate simultaneous production of 1,3-PD and hydrogen due to the excess of NADRed in volatile fatty acids (VFA) generation (Paranhos and Silva, 2020). However, the dismutation of glycerin in 1,3-PD and VFA should be maintained in equilibrium for maximum utilization of NADRed in 1,3-PD (Zhu et al., 2021). Therefore, the synthesis of VFA must be controlled by operating conditions, especially temperature, so as not to impair 1,3-PD yield. Despite mesophilic conditions were widely used for 1,3-PD production (Zhu et al., 2021), Sittijunda and Reungsang (2020) reported that thermophilic Gly fermentation by mixed culture in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor produced more 1,3-PD than the mesophilic one. Simões et al. (2021) reported the same pattern for Gly fermentation in AFBRs at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 40 kg COD m−3 day−1. Furthermore, mesophilic fermentation of SV leads to a significant generation of VFA (Bernal et al., 2021; Rego et al., 2020), which might lower the yield of 1,3-PD in co-fermentation with Gly. Conversely, thermophilic SV fermentation results in less acidification and high metabolite selectivity (Niz et al., 2019; Rego et al., 2020). By observing what has been discussed above, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of increased temperature in the (hyper) thermophilic range (55 °C, 60 °C, and 65 °C) in 1,3-PD production from the co-fermentation of SV and Gly in AFBRs with proportions equal to 75%Gly:25%SV, 50%Gly:50%SV, and 25%Gly:75%SV (on a COD basis). The fermentation was carried in a thermally pretreated mixed culture. The total concentration of co-substrates was fixed at 10 g COD L−1 to facilitate comparison with single fermentations of Gly and SV in AFBRs (Ramos and Silva, 2017, 2020; Paranhos and Silva, 2020; Simões et al., 2021). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) equal to 4 h was set to comply with the optimal OLR previously indicated in the single fermentation of SV and Gly (40–100 kg COD m−3 day−1) (Gallardo et al., 2014; Paranhos and Silva, 2020; Fuess et al., 2019; Ramos and Silva, 2020; Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2020). The research described here is one of the first to investigate the co-fermentation of SV and Gly."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reactors,"2.1 Reactors Three AFBRs were constructed with stainless steel with identical dimensions, that is, 149 cm of height and 3.6 cm of internal diameter (see the experimental apparatus in Fig. S2, Supplementary Material). Expanded clay with diameters varying from 2.8 to 3.35 mm was used to fill 0.60 L of the reactors' operational volume (1.55 L). By increasing the recirculation flow rate in the AFBRs to 58.8 L h−1, the expanded clay was fluidized in 1.3 times its minimum fluidization velocity (1.24 cm s−1)."
3,Co-substrates,"2.2 Co-substrates The pure Gly used as substrate was collected from the Biobrotas Oleoquímica industry (Brotas city, São Paulo state, Brazil) and presented 1.3 g COD g−1 Gly with Gly, ash, and sodium contents equal to 99.5%, 0.01%, and 0.001%, respectively. The pH value of a solution containing 10% w v−1 of Gly in distilled water was 7.5. The SV used as co-substrate in Gly fermentation was provided by the sugar and ethanol production plant São Martinho (Pradópolis city, São Paulo state, Brazil). The raw SV with a chemical oxygen demand equal to 29.5 ± 1.2 g L−1 consisted of (concentrations in g L−1): total carbohydrate (7.5 ± 1.8), Gly (0.8 ± 0.03), sulfate (1.9 ± 0.5), nitrogen (total Kjeldahl) (0.4 ± 0.05), lactate (1.6 ± 0.7), and volatile suspended solids (2.7 ± 0.5). The average pH values of SV samples were 4.6 ± 0.1."
4,Thermophilic inoculum,"2.3 Thermophilic inoculum The methanogenic sludge used in the start-up stage of the reactors was collected in a thermophilic UASB reactor destined for SV treatment in the São Martinho plant. To eliminate methanogenic archaea from the original sludge, it was subjected to heat shock treatment (Kim et al., 2006) followed by cooling at room temperature."
5,Operational conditions descriptions,"2.4 Operational conditions descriptions In the start-up and continuous mode operation stages, SV and Gly proportions were fixed in 75% Gly - 25% SV (R75%Gly:25%SV), 50% Gly - 50% SV (R50%Gly:50%SV), and 25% Gly - 75% SV (R25%Gly:75%SV) on a COD basis. The reactors were started by recirculating 8 L from feed tanks containing nutritional medium, inoculum (10% v v−1), SV, and Gly (total concentration of 10 g COD L−1). The AFBRs were operated in continuous mode after observing a reduction of 80% in the Gly and total carbohydrate contents in the start-up stage. In continuous mode operation, the total co-substrates concentrations in the feed tanks of R75%Gly:25%SV, R50%Gly:50%SV, and R25%Gly:75%SV were 10 g COD L−1. Furthermore, based on single-fermentations of Gly and SV (Paranhos and Silva, 2020; Ramos and Silva, 2020; Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2020), the OLR of 60 kg COD m−3 d−1 in the AFBRs was set by fixing the HRT at 4 h. Initially, the temperature was maintained at 55 °C by recirculating water from ultra-thermostatic baths in the reactors' outer jackets and internal coils. After verifying variations in the concentrations of liquid metabolites in the effluent samples of the reactors of less than 10% for ten consecutive days, changes in operational conditions were driven by increasing the temperature from 55 °C to 60 °C, and 65 °C in the three AFBRs. The continuous mode operation lasted 120 days for each reactor. Fig. 1 shows a flowchart that summarizes the operational conditions adopted and the sequence of data analysis in the Results and discussion section (Section 3)."
6,Physicochemical analysis,"2.5 Physicochemical analysis Analysis of gaseous effluents and liquid influents and effluents were carried daily during the continuous operation of R75%Gly:25%SV, R50%Gly:50%SV, and R25%Gly:75%SV. A fluid displacement technique was employed to verify the volume of biogas generated (Walker et al., 2009). In turn, the biogas produced was collected in a gastight syringe with a lock for examination of composition (hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide) by gas chromatography (Paranhos and Silva, 2020). The organic matter concentration (COD concentration) in the samples was verified using the closed reflux colorimetric method (APHA, 2005). Volatile suspended solids, total suspended solids, and pH were also analyzed according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). A colorimetric method was used to determine the Gly concentration (Bondioli and Bella, 2005). The total carbohydrate concentration (on a sucrose basis) was determined by applying a colorimetric method (Dubois et al., 1956). The soluble metabolite products concentrations, including 1,3-PD concentration, were measured by gas chromatography according to Paranhos and Silva (2018)."
7,Results and discussion,"Table 1 shows the fermentative performance indicators of R75%Gly:25%SV, R50%Gly:50%SV, and R25%Gly:75%SV at 55 °C, 60 °C, and 65 °C."
8,Co-substrates conversion in the AFBRs,"3.1 Co-substrates conversion in the AFBRs In the three AFBRs, the values of COD removal remained below 13%, which is consistent with dark fermentation systems. In Gly fermentation, COD removal values of 30% were reported (Nazareth et al., 2018). Similarly, COD removal efficiencies in SV fermentation remained between 5 and 23% (Bernal et al., 2021; Rego et al., 2020). The conversion of substrate into VFA and alcohols results in poor COD removals in dark fermentation. The reported COD removal values are attributed to hydrogen and carbon dioxide production and biomass formation, while the COD detected in the effluent samples is attributed to acids, alcohols, and unconverted substrates. The increase in operational temperature from 55 °C to 60 °C resulted in higher carbohydrate (from 39 to 49%) and Gly (from 5 to 22%) conversion efficiencies in R75%Gly:25%SV. However, both Gly and carbohydrate conversions were low at all temperatures applied in this reactor (Table 1). In contrast to R75%Gly:25%SV, thermophilic fermentation of Gly in an UASB reactor resulted in 95% conversion of this substrate (Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2020). This could be because Sittijunda and Reungsang (2020) added an external source of nitrogen (5.24 g L−1 of ammonium bicarbonate) to the medium containing 25 g L−1 of Gly. It is well understood that nitrogen is a critical macronutrient for microbial growth (Carosia et al., 2021). In addition, high concentrations of active biomass in the reactor are correlated to high substrate conversions (Bernal et al., 2021). In R75%Gly:25%SV, the addition of 25% SV resulted in a COD: nitrogen ratio of 295, which may have been insufficient to guarantee cell synthesis in this reactor. Therefore, the low concentration of active biomass may have resulted in low substrate conversion in R75%Gly:25%SV. Increasing temperature to 65 °C in R75%Gly:25%SV caused a reduction in conversion efficiencies to 20% (carbohydrate) and 4.5% (glycerin). Increased temperatures in the (hyper) thermophilic range are likely to reduce substrate conversion because high temperatures can cause cell protein denaturation and inactivate key enzymes for cell development (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Therefore, the low biomass concentration at a high temperature can result in low substrate conversion. The reduction of substrate conversion at 65 °C was also observed in R50%Gly:50%SV, and R25%Gly:75%SV (Table 1), corroborating the hypothesis of reduced biomass concentration at elevated temperature. The higher SV proportions in R50%Gly:50%SV and R25%Gly:75%SV are related to COD: nitrogen ratios equal to 147 and 98, respectively. While R50%Gly:50%SV had comparable carbohydrate conversion to R75%Gly:25%SV, the Gly conversion in R50%Gly:50%SV was higher than in R75%Gly:25%SV (Table 1), very likely due to the smaller COD: nitrogen ratio in R50%Gly:50%SV. The lower COD: nitrogen ratio in R25%Gly:75%SV may also be responsible for the significantly higher conversions of carbohydrates (51%) and especially glycerin (91%) regarding R50%Gly:50%SV and R25%Gly:75%SV at 55 °C (Table 1). Carbohydrate conversion in R25%Gly:75%SV at 55 °C remained within the range observed for SV fermentation as a single substrate in a thermophilic AFBR (55 °C) at OLR of 60 kg COD m−3 day−1 (50–66%) (Ramos and Silva, 2017, 2020; Santos et al., 2014). The behavior of reducing substrate conversion by increasing temperature in R25%Gly:75%SV (Table 1) was similar to that observed in an AFBR fed with SV, where carbohydrate conversion efficiency decreased from 66% at 55 °C to 51% at 65 °C (Ramos and Silva, 2017). A thermophilic anaerobic structured-bed reactor (55 °C) also presented higher carbohydrate conversion (51%) (Fuess et al., 2019) than the hyperthermophilic one (70 °C) (36%) (Niz et al., 2019) under similar operating conditions (~100 kg COD m−3 day−1). Niz et al. (2019) attributed this occurrence to a decrease in exopolymer production in a hyperthermophilic environment, resulting in the suspended growth of biomass. In AFBR, the growth of biomass in suspension can cause cells washout due to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the reactor and this may explain the lower carbohydrate conversions at 65 °C reported by Ramos and Silva (2017) and in R25%Gly:75%SV."
9,"1,3-PD and co-metabolites production","3.2 1,3-PD and co-metabolites production Fig. 2 shows the yield and productivity of 1,3-PD (a) and the co-metabolites produced (b) as a function of the temperature applied to the reactors. Table 2 shows reactions that are most likely to occur in glycerol and glucose fermentation. In R75%Gly:25%SV, 0.7 g L−1 of AcH, 0.3 g L−1 of BuH, and 0.2 g L−1 of propionic acid (PrH) were observed as predominant metabolites in effluent samples at 55 °C. Considering that the total carbohydrates in SV are mostly composed of sucrose (Godoi et al., 2019), only 0.2 g of sucrose L−1 and 0.5 g of Gly L−1 (COD basis) were converted to VFA, while 1.6 g of VFA L−1 (COD basis) was produced. The higher VFA production than carbohydrates and Gly consumption is because SV is composed of other biodegradable organic matter not counted as carbohydrates (Godoi et al., 2019). For example, Fuess et al. (2019) reported that microorganisms use the LaH present in SV as a substrate in low carbohydrate availability conditions. The absence of LaH in the effluent of SV-fed reactors was previously attributed to its conversion into AcH, BuH, and PrH (Bernal et al., 2021; Fuess et al., 2019; Rego et al., 2020). This assumption may also be made in the current study due to the absence of LaH in the AFBR effluent samples and the increase in VFA concentration with increasing SV percentage (Fig. 2b). Increasing temperature to 60 °C led to reductions in the BuH and PrH concentrations to undetectable values and the AcH concentration to 0.14 g L−1 in R75%Gly:25%SV, even with the increase in the conversion of co-substrates (Table 1). Substrate conversion at 60 °C (Table 1) was consistent with the quantity of AcH produced (Fig. 2b) because 1, 2 and 1 mol of AcH are produced per mole of Gly (Eq. (1)), glucose (Eq. (7)), and LaH (Eq. (10)) converted, respectively. Therefore, at 60 °C the carbohydrates and Gly were the main substrates for the generation of AcH and 1,3-PD. This was also probably due to the reduction in the active biomass concentration inside the reactor. The decrease in biomass concentration in R75%Gly:25%SV combined with a lower diversity of microorganisms (Rego et al., 2020) may limit the conversion of more complex substrates found in SV at 60 °C. The yields of 1,3-PD (Y1,3-PD) observed in R75%Gly:25%SV (0.49, 0.10, and 0.39 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly at 55 °C, 60 °C, and 65 °C, respectively) are comparable to those observed in the fermentation of Gly as a single substrate by mixed culture in continuous reactors such as the UASB (0.48 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) (Veras et al., 2019) and EGSB (0.47 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) (Gallardo et al., 2014). However, the Y1,3-PD values observed in R75%Gly:25%SV are lower than those reported for Gly fermentation with other co-substrates (Table 3 ) and Gly and SV fermentation in R50%Gly:50%SV and R25%Gly:75%SV. These Y1,3-PD values are a result of the low Gly conversion in this reactor. Although influent Gly concentration is not a critical factor in 1,3-PD production (Paranhos and Silva, 2020), high Gly conversions are related to high Y1,3-PD (Dahiya and Mohan, 2021). In R50%Gly:50%SV, the Y1,3-PD increased from 0.42 to 0.82 and 0.89 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly at 55 °C to 60 °C and 65 °C, respectively. The lower values of Y1,3-PD at 55 °C can be related to the higher molar fraction of BuH (42% of the VFA) than AcH (36%) in this operational condition. This occurs because a high NADRed: NADOx ratio is necessary for the Y1,3-PD maximization (Dahiya and Mohan, 2021). While the generation of AcH produces 3 mol of NADRed (Eq. (1)), generation of BuH (Eq. (3)), LaH (Eq. (4)), and EtOH (Eq. (5)) from pyruvate requires the oxidation of NADRed (Xiu et al., 2007). Therefore, the maximum Y1,3-PD from Gly fermentation as a single substrate (Eq. (6)) is observed when AcH is produced as a co-metabolite (2 mol of 1, 3-PD per mol of AcH) (Pflügl et al., 2012). Indeed, the AcH was the only VFA detected in the influent samples of R50%Gly:50%SV at 65 °C, condition with the highest Y1,3-PD (0.89 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly). The assumptions made for Gly fermentation can be extended to glucose fermentation because glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate connects the fermentation of both substrates (Yun et al., 2021). In this regard, one difference between the co-fermentation of SV (sucrose rich substrate further hydrolyzed to glucose) and Gly versus Gly as a single substrate is that the Gly in the co-fermentation can be used exclusively as a substrate for the generation of 1,3-PD. Meanwhile, the energy required for cell synthesis and NADRed can be obtained entirely from SV fermentation. Therefore, the formation of BuH is less desired than the formation of AcH when targeting 1,3-PD production (Xiu et al., 2007), but BuH generation in co-fermentation systems may not configure substrate competition for 1,3-PD generation. In R25%Gly:75%SV the concentration of BuH at 55 °C was similar to that observed in R50%Gly:50%SV (Fig. 2b). Still, the Y1,3-PD obtained in R25%Gly:75%SV (0.67 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) was superior to that obtained in R50%Gly:50%SV (0.42 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) at 55 °C. The higher Y1,3-PD in R25%Gly:75%SV at 55 °C is probably due to higher quantities of NADRed. However, increasing temperature in R25%Gly:75%SV to 65 °C resulted in a decrease in Y1,3-PD to 0.03 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly, correlating with an increase in BuH concentration to 0.8 g L−1 and a reduction in AcH concentration to 0.4 g L−1. The highest Y1,3-PD values in R50%Gly:50%SV were comparable to those observed in co-fermentations of Gly with glucose (Table 3), arabinose (0.88 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) (Vivek et al., 2018), and cactus cladode hydrolysate (0.91 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly) (de Santana et al., 2021). The high temperature in R50%Gly:50%SV may have created a favorable condition for the microbial consortium selection with the adequate synergic interaction for Gly conversion exclusively through the reductive branch, and formation of AcH as the only VFA in the fermentation of SV. One possible explanation is that the autochthonous microorganisms present in SV are adapted to high temperatures since stillage leaves the distillation process at ~90 °C (Santos et al., 2014; Lazaro et al., 2015). The acidification (Σ concentrations of VFA per total COD added) observed in R25%Gly:75%SV (14–23%) was comparable to that of an SV-fed anaerobic structured bed reactor operated in hyperthermophilic conditions (21%) (Niz et al., 2019). In addition, the acidification observed in R25%Gly:75%SV was superior to those of R50%Gly:50%SV (4–16%). Still, the performance of R50%Gly:50%SV regarding Y1,3-PD was better than the performance of R25%Gly:75%SV (Fig. 2a). Yun et al. (2021) performed co-fermentation of Gly (40 g L−1) and glucose (0–20 g L−1) by co-culture system of engineered Escherichia coli strain and observed that cell density increased continuously with increasing glucose concentration. However, for glucose concentrations above 10 g L−1, the 1,3-PD concentration decreased (Yun et al., 2021). As in the study by Yun et al. (2021), the higher concentration of the co-substrate in R25%Gly:75%SV led to lower Y1,3-PD compared to R50%Gly:50%SV. The NADOx regeneration is required to maximize the generation of 1,3-PD (Dahiya and Mohan, 2021). Therefore, the decrease of the Y1,3-PD in R25%Gly:75%SV could be due to an imbalance in the NADOx: NADRed ratio caused by the increased generation of NADRed by the oxidative branch in higher carbohydrate concentrations. In this case, regulation of the NADOx: NADRed ratio is obtained by the generation of less oxidized compounds from carbohydrate and Gly fermentation, such as the PrH (Bernal et al., 2021; Nazareth et al., 2018). In R25%Gly:75%SV, the BuH generation was predominant, reducing Y1,3-PD. At 65 °C in R25%Gly:75%SV, the molar fraction of BuH increased to 46%, whereas Y1,3-PD decreased to 0.03 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly. Besides alteration on soluble metabolic products profile, the redirection to the oxidative pathway can also be recognized by hydrogen generation (Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2020)."
10,Hydrogen production and overall performance,"3.3 Hydrogen production and overall performance Hydrogen was detected in the biogas of R75%Gly:25%SV, R50%Gly:50%SV, and R25%Gly:75%SV at 55 °C (Table 1). At 60 °C, hydrogen was observed in R75%Gly:25%SV and R25%Gly:75%SV. Further increase in temperature to 65 °C led to a reduction in the molar fraction of hydrogen in the biogas to undetectable values in all AFBRs. It is worth mentioning that methane was not detected as a biogas component in any operational condition, proving the effectiveness of heat treatment and pH control below 5.0 in suppressing methanogenic archaea. This is critical for 1,3-PD generation in mixed culture because the consumption of AcH for methane production could result in a shift of substrates to the oxidative pathway, resulting in decreased Y1,3-PD (Dahiya and Mohan, 2021). The highest values of hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield (YH2) in the AFBRs at 55 °C (Table 1) coincided with the highest total VFA concentration in the reactors (Fig. 2b). Also, higher YH2 occurred with lower Y1,3-PD at 55 °C because the hydrogen and 1,3-PD formation pathways compete (Gallardo et al., 2014). Each mole of 1,3-PD generated requires one mole of hydrogen (Paranhos and Silva, 2020) and high YH2 indicates the utilization of the substrates for BuH and AcH generation in the oxidative pathway (Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2020). Paranhos and Silva (2020) used a mesophilic AFBR for Gly fermentation as the only substrate and observed that in the operational condition where the Y1,3-PD was 0.53 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly, the YH2 was 0.02 mmol H2 g−1 COD. On the other hand, the condition that achieved a YH2 of 1.22 mmol H2 g−1 COD resulted in a Y1.3-PD of 0.19 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly (Paranhos and Silva, 2020). Sittijunda and Reungsang (2020) reported the possibility of obtaining high simultaneous values of Y1,3-PD and YH2 in a thermophilic UASB reactor (55 °C) fed with Gly (25 g L−1) due to the redirection of the regenerated NADOx in the production of hydrogen. The simultaneous production of hydrogen and 1,3-PD is possible when the generation of both AcH and BuH occurs (Dietz and Zeng, 2014). The YH2 in R25%Gly:75%SV was higher than that in R50%Gly:50%SV due to higher acidification and simultaneous formation of AcH and BuH in R25%Gly:75%SV. At 60 °C in R25%Gly:75%SV, the substrate was converted to 0.7 g L−1 of AcH and 0.2 g L−1 of BuH. This resulted in YH2 and Y1,3-PD of 0.70 mmol H2 g−1 COD and 0.63 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly, respectively. Besides, the co-fermentation of Gly and SV in R25%Gly:75%SV resulted in higher Y1,3-PD and YH2 than those found by Paranhos and Silva (2020) (Table 4 ). On the other hand, the NADRed obtained in the oxidative pathway in R50%Gly:50%SV were entirely transferred to 1.3-PD synthesis at 60 °C, yielding 0.85 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly in this reactor. The performance of R75%Gly:25%SV regarding hydrogen production was similar to that observed for mesophilic Gly fermentation (Table 4). However, the YH2 found by Sittijunda and Reungsang (2020) in the single fermentation of Gly in thermophilic UASB was 28-fold higher than that observed in R75%Gly:25%SV. Additionally, Y1,3-PD values in R75%Gly:25%SV were lower than those observed in R50%Gly:50%SV and R25%Gly:75%SV. Therefore, in general, the addition of 25% SV in 75% Gly (COD basis) resulted in poor hydrogen and 1,3-PD production performance. The HPR values observed in R25%Gly:75%SV (2.90 L H2 d−1 L−1) are comparable to those observed in SV fermentation in anaerobic structured bed reactors (2.07 and 0.54 L H2 d−1 L−1) (Fuess et al., 2019; Niz et al., 2019) and expanded granular sludge bed reactor (4.36 L H2 d−1 L−1) (Bernal et al., 2021). However, the fermentation of SV as a single substrate in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic AFBR achieved values of YH2 higher than those observed in R25%Gly:75%SV (Table 4). The lower YH2 values in R25%Gly:75%SV concerning the single fermentation of SV in AFBR are because of a Y1,3-PD equal to 0.67 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly at 55 °C. To accomplish simultaneous 1,3-PD and hydrogen synthesis, 75% SV and 25% Gly must be co-fermented at 55 °C and 60 °C. The absence of hydrogen in R50%Gly:50%SV at 60 °C and 65 °C is justified by the high Y1,3-PD on these conditions (0.85–0.89 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly, respectively). Y1,3-PD in R50%Gly:50%SV was superior to the maximum theoretical Y1,3-PD (0.72 mol 1,3-PD mol−1 Gly) from single fermentation of Gly when only AcH is produced in the oxidative branch (Gallardo et al., 2014). Therefore, the addition of 50% SV and 50% Gly (COD basis) probably provides ideal conditions for synergic regulation of microorganisms and enables the recovery of 1,3-PD from Gly. In short, the poor hydrogen and 1,3-PD production performance in the addition of 25% SV in 75% Gly (COD basis) was may due to insufficient nutritional balance in the system (COD: nitrogen ratio of 295). Conversely, COD: nitrogen ratios in the additions of 50% SV in 50% Gly (147) and of 25% SV in 75% Gly (98) lead to satisfactory fermentative performances. Therefore, the glycerol influenced the fermentative performances in nutritionally balanced systems. VFA buildup occurred at low glycerol concentrations (25% Gly), stimulating both hydrogen and 1,3-PD productions. The efficient formation of 1,3-PD by the addition of 50% SV in 50% Gly indicated that this proportion was more adequate for the synthesis of this metabolite. Future research should focus on i) increase the productivity of 1,3-PD from Gly and SV as co-substrates; ii) develop strategies for extract 1,3-PD from liquid mediums; iii) treat the acidogenic effluent from Gly and SV fermentation to recover methane."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, SV proved to be a suitable co-substrate for improving 1,3-PD production from Gly. At a total co-substrate concentration fixed at 10 g COD L−1, a higher proportion of Gly (75%Gly:25%SV) led to low 1,3-PD productivity at all temperatures (55 °C, 60 °C, and 65 °C). A low proportion of Gly (25%Gly:75%SV) favored the simultaneous production of 1,3-PD and hydrogen in thermophilic conditions. The best results of Y1.3-PD (0.89 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly), higher than the theoretical Y1,3-PD for Gly single-fermentation (0.70 mol 1.3-PD mol−1 Gly), were observed in equal proportions of Gly and SV (55%Gly:50%SV) in hyperthermophilic condition."
