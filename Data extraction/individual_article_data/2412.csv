0,Introduction,"Lowering the bioprocess cost and improving the energy recovery efficiency are very important for industrial production of biological hydrogen from biomass wastes. Therefore, to improve biological hydrogen productivity, much work has been carried out, such as optimization of process parameters, alteration of key affecting factors and manipulation of enzymes related with the hydrogen production [1,2]. Most previous studies on the improvement of biological hydrogen production were carried out under strict anaerobic conditions. But recently, some researches showed that under microaerophilic conditions, hydrogen-producing strains could get higher hydrogen yield than that under strict anaerobic conditions. The hydrogen productivity of thermophilic Thermotoga neapolitana is higher under microaerophilic conditions than that under strict anaerobic conditions [3,4]. Chen et al. also showed that the maximum hydrogen yield of Klebsiella pneumoniae under microaerophilic conditions was high as 2.34 times as that under anaerobic conditions by stoichiometric analysis [5]. Compared with the strict anaerobic conditions, due to the limited oxygen concentration under microaerophilic conditions, the increased TCA cycle activity results in an increased production rate of reduced electron carriers (NADH or FADH), and more ATP are produced in the respiratory chain [5,6]. In principle, the essence of bacterial hydrogen evolution is a route of releasing the redundant electrons or energy formed in the metabolic oxidations, through the catalysis of hydrogenases [7,8]. It is well known that in the presence of oxygen or under aerobic conditions, 1mol of glucose could produce 36mol or 38mol of ATP theoretically, but in the absence of oxygen or under anaerobic condition, 1mol of glucose could produce 2mol of ATP in theory. More energy could be produced in aerobic state than that in anaerobic state. Under microaerophilic conditions, by consumption of limited oxygen, the energy can be rapidly produced and accumulated in glucose metabolism, and part of them are used for cellular aerobic activities. However, after limited oxygen is rapidly exhausted, the cell enters into the anaerobic state, and part of residual rapidly accumulated energy in the presence of oxygen may be used for more anaerobic hydrogen production. Many bacteria can conserve and release energy in the form of polyphosphates (polyP) by switching of aerobic and anaerobic conditions [9,10]. The related reversible reaction is as follows: nATP+P n ↔ nADP+polyP n+1 In this reaction, the key enzyme is polyphosphate kinase (PPK). Under aerobic conditions, polyP is synthetized by PPK from ATP and phosphates, and the energy is conserved in the form of polyP. However, under anaerobic conditions, PPK can transfer the terminal phosphate of polyP into ADP, and form ATP in a reversible reaction [11–13]. If we can express PPK in hydrogen-producing strains, switching of aerobic and anaerobic conditions will help to conserve and release energy via synthesis and degradation of polyP. Therefore, improvement of bacterial hydrogen production can be expected by microaerophilic cultivation and PPK overexpression. There are two direct routes contributing to the hydrogen production of E. aerogenes, including formate pathway and NADH pathway [14]. The formate pathway is generally of importance, since the formate produced from glucose by the anaerobic metabolism can always be quickly transformed to hydrogen by formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). The FHL complex reportedly consists of formate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, and electron transfer mediators. Transcription of the FHL complex is under the control of several genes, including fhlA and hycA, which codes for the FHL activator protein FHLA and the FHL repressor protein HYCA, respectively. In the NADH pathway, NADH as the precursor involved in the hydrogen production, presumably through the ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase and the ferredoxin hydrogenase [15]. All of these above stated enzymes or proteins were closely related with the hydrogen metabolism, and limited the hydrogen production. Up to now, most studies about the genetic engineering of hydrogen-producing strains were based on the local regulation of related enzymes or proteins in formate pathway or NADH pathway. However, few studies were from the view of global energy regulation. The essence of bacterial hydrogen evolution is a route of releasing the redundant electrons or energy formed in the metabolic oxidations. If we can control the cellular energy metabolism, it may regulate the hydrogen metabolism. Many bacteria can conserve and release energy by PPK system. PPK might be only a subordination factor for hydrogen production, but in our studies, regulation of PPK was only a method for regulating cellular energy level. We assumed that, if regulation of PPK could affect the cellular energy level and further improve the hydrogen production, it would demonstrate that global energy regulation was effective for the improvement of the hydrogen metabolism. Of the hydrogen-producting bacteria, Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly called Aerobacter aerogenes) is a very useful hydrogen producer, which has higher hydrogen evolution rate and exhibits uninhibited growth in an atmosphere of 100% H2 [16,17]. It is a facultative anaerobe, so it could grow under either aerobic or strict anaerobic conditions. Additionally, some former researches have showed that it possessed the PPK system for the accumulation and degradation of polyP [18–20]. Based on the characteristics above, E. aerogenes was a good target for investigating effects of more accumulated energy in the form of polyP on the hydrogen metabolism, by changing aerobic environment to anaerobic one. In this study, we chose E. aerogenes IAM1183 as the model strain. At first, we tried to overexpress the ppk gene encoding PPK into E. aerogenes, to strengthen the PPK reaction for conservation and release of energy via synthesis and degradation of polyP. Secondly, we studied effects of different microaerophilic conditions with different initial oxygen concentrations on cell growth and hydrogen production of wild E. aerogenes strain and PPK-overexpressing strain, using NaH2PO4 as phosphate sources. Then, intracellular ATP level and cellular metabolism were further analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strain and medium,"2.1 Bacterial strain and medium E. aerogenes IAM1183 (Table 1 ) purchased from Institute of Applied Microorganisms (IAM) of the University of Tokyo, Japan, was used in this study. The basic culture medium (1l) consisted of glucose 10.0g, tryptone 5.0g, (NH4)2SO4 2.0g and MgSO4 0.2g [21,22]. 100mM of monophosphate (NaH2PO4, Pi) as phosphate sources was added into the basic culture medium. All chemicals used were of analytical grade, and sterilized individually by autoclave. The initial pH value of medium was controlled at 6.0 by addition of NaOH or HCl."
3,Microaerophilic fermentation for hydrogen production,"2.2 Microaerophilic fermentation for hydrogen production 20ml of culture medium was put into the serum bottle (70ml of total volume). When the cultivated bacterial cells reached 1.0 in terms of optical density at 600nm (OD600), 1ml of culture as inoculum was transferred into the serum bottle. At first, the serum bottle was air-sealed with butyl rubber stopper and degassed with 100% of aseptic nitrogen for 5min. Next, 0ml, 2ml, 5ml, 10ml and 15ml of gas was taken out by a aseptic syringe with a needle, and then 0ml, 2ml, 5ml, 10ml and 15ml of aseptic air (21% (v/v) of oxygen) were injected, respectively. At last, the volume fraction of oxygen in the bottles reached 0%, 0.8%, 2.1%, 4.1% and 6.0% respectively. The cultivation was performed at 37°C and 170rpm for 17h."
4,Overexpression of PPK,"2.3 Overexpression of PPK The E.coli K12 W3110 ppk gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an upstream primer P1F containing a BamHI site and a downstream primer P1R containing a PstI site as shown in Table 2 [23]. The amplified 2.1kb DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and PstI, and introduced into BamHI–PstI sites in pMCL plasmid, to form pMCK (Table 1). Then pMCK was transformed into E. aerogenes IAM1183 according to the protocol established in our previous study [24]. For the expression of the inserted ppk gene driven by the lac promoter, IPTG was added to give a final concentration of 0.5mM. Restriction and other DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Co. Ltd."
5,Assay of enzyme activity,"2.4 Assay of enzyme activity E. aerogenes IAM1183 harboring the pMCK plasmid was cultivated in LB medium with 100μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C, and at the beginning of the cultivation, IPTG was added to induce the expression of the inserted ppk gene. After 8h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a buffer of 50mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1mM EDTA. A cell free extract was prepared by ultrasonication. The enzyme activity was measured as follows: the reaction mixture (1.0ml) contained 50mM Tris–HCl(pH 7.8), 10mM MgCl2, 100mM (NH4)2SO4, 10mM ADP, and polyP (150mM as phosphate). The reaction was started by addition of cell free extract, incubated at 37°C, and stopped by addition of 0.1ml of 0.2N acetate. The amount of ATP generated in the reaction solution was measured by a bioluminescence method [25]. One unit of PPK was defined as the amount producing 1nmol of ATP from ADP per minute under these conditions."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods OD660 was measured by using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV757CRT, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument CO., Ltd., China). The dry cell weight (DCW) was then calculated by the equation of dry cell weight (g/l)=0.132×OD600. The pH values were measured by pH meter (MODEL 828, ORION, United States). Hydrogen was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC112A, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m×3mm (i.d.) stainless-steel column packed with TDX-01 (80–100 mesh). The temperatures of injector, detector and column were kept at 120°C, 120°C, and 80°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10ml/min. The concentrations of individual organic acids and alcohols in metabolites were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu 10A) equipped with a RID detector and a Shimadzu SCR-102H column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. HClO4 of 5mM was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1ml/min. The concentration of reducing sugar was measured by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) colorimetry [26]. ATP concentration in the cells was determined by using a bioluminescence method [25]. A luminometric method based on the luciferin–luciferase reaction was used to quantify ATP by using an ATP assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The bioluminescence was measured by a luminometer (LUMI-COUNTER 700; Microtec NITI-ON, Chiba, Japan)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of PPK overexpression on cell growth and glucose consumption,"3.1 Effects of PPK overexpression on cell growth and glucose consumption The ppk gene expressed in E. aerogenes was driven by the lac promoter in pMCK plasmid. Specific activities of PPK in E. aerogenes without and with overexpression of ppk gene were assayed. Compared with the control (pMCL) (827.0±1.5U/g DCW), E. aerogenes with ppk overexpression (pMCK) exhibited higher PPK activity (3265.3±4.2U/g DCW), which indicated the successful expression of PPK in E. aerogenes. Under different microaerophilic conditions with different initial oxygen concentrations, cell growth and glucose consumption of wild and PPK-overexpressing E. aerogenes were assayed after 17h of cultivation in the batch mode, as shown in Table 3 . For E. aerogenes, 17h of batch cultivation time were enough and proper to reach the stationary phase of cellular activities [14,27,28]. When the initial oxygen volume fraction was 0.8%, after 17h of cultivation, the cell growth of wild strain and PPK-overexpressing strain reached respective maximum values, which were respective 0.202±0.002gDCW/l and 0.217±0.003gDCW/l. The glucose consumption of wild strain had the same change trends with the cell growth. When the initial oxygen volume fraction was 0.8%, the glucose consumption amount of the wild strain was maximum 5.904±0.020g/l. For PPK-overexpressing strain, when the initial oxygen volume fraction was 0.8% and 2.1%, the glucose consumption almost reach the same maximum value (≈6.072±0.028g/l). However, the cell growth and the glucose consumption decreased after the oxygen volume fraction was more than 2.1%. It may be attributed to the fast accumulation of cellular metabolites in the presence of more oxygen, which were harmful for cellular activities. As shown in Table 3, whatever the initial oxygen concentrations were, compared with the wild strain, PPK-overexpressing strain showed improvement of cell growth and glucose consumption. Successful overexpression of PPK enabled cells to accumulate more energy in form of polyP during the oxygen consumption. Then when cells entered into the anaerobic state, the accumulated energy could be released for cellular activities. Therefore, under microaerophilic conditions, PPK-overexpressing strain showed better cell growth and consumption of carbon sources than the wild strain."
9,Hydrogen production by wild strain under different microaerophilic conditions,"3.2 Hydrogen production by wild strain under different microaerophilic conditions Under different microaerophilic conditions, the hydrogen productivity of wild E. aerogenes were assayed as shown in Table 3. Three important parameters, hydrogen volumetric production amount per liter of culture, hydrogen production per cell and hydrogen yield per mol consumed glucose, were used for examining the cellular hydrogen productivity. When the initial oxygen volume fraction was 0.8%, these three parameters mentioned above all reached the maximum values, which were 1.132±0.022l/l, 5.609±0.046l/g and 1.412±0.023mol/mol respectively. These results demonstrated that consumption of the limited 0.8% of oxygen made the cell fast produce a certain amount of more energy, then part of these fast produced energy promoted more hydrogen production after the oxygen exhausted. In previous other studies, the hydrogen productivity of thermophilic T. neapolitana was higher under microaerophilic conditions than that under strict anaerobic conditions [3,4]. However, for E. aerogenes, when the oxygen concentration was more than 0.8%, the hydrogen production decreased, presumably due to the accumulation of too much metabolites which inhibited the hydrogen production. There was a balance between the promotion action of fast produced energy on the hydrogen production and the inhibition action of much more accumulated metabolites on the hydrogen production. The balance point was a proper initial oxygen concentration. For the wild strain of E. aerogenes, 1mol of glucose can always produce around 1mol of hydrogen by optimizing the cultivation conditions in batch anaerobic fermentations [16], which is far less than the theoretical hydrogen yield of facultative anaerobes (2mol H2 per mol consumed glucose) [29]. In principle, the essence of bacterial hydrogen evolution is a route of releasing the redundant electrons or energy formed in the metabolic oxidations. In order to increase the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes, we tried to make cells accumulate more energy and make more energy used for the hydrogen production. By relying on originally present PPK system, addition of phosphate sources and optimization of oxygen concentration, the wild strain could produce about 1.412mol H2 per mol consumed glucose, which is still less than the theoretical hydrogen yield under anaerobic conditions (2mol H2 per mol consumed glucose). The result demonstrated that the originally present PPK system was not good enough. Therefore, we should try to overexpress the PPK system and produce more energy for more hydrogen production."
10,Effects of PPK overexpression on the hydrogen production under different microaerophilic conditions,"3.3 Effects of PPK overexpression on the hydrogen production under different microaerophilic conditions In the presence of limited oxygen, by PPK overexpression, more energy were conserved in forms of polyP. After the oxygen was exhausted, cell automatically entered into the anaerobic environment, and the energy in polyP were released by PPK action for affecting cellular activities, including the cell growth and the glucose consumption, as shown in Table 3. Accordingly, the hydrogen production was also further affected. As shown in Table 3, when the initial volume fraction of oxygen was 0.8%, the wild strain (control, pMCL) reached the maximum glucose consumption (5.904±0.020g/l), hydrogen production per liter of culture (1.132±0.022l/l), hydrogen production per cell (5.609±0.046l/g) and hydrogen yield per mol consumed glucose (1.412±0.023mol/mol). However, when the initial volume fraction of oxygen was 2.1%, PPK-overexpressing strain reached the maximum glucose consumption (6.072±0.028g/l), hydrogen production per liter of culture (1.240±0.025l/l), hydrogen production per cell (5.809±0.096l/g) and hydrogen yield per mol consumed glucose (1.504±0.037mol/mol), which increased by respective 2.8%, 9.5%, 3.6% and 6.5%, compared to that of control. Although the increase ratios were not great after PPK overexpression, results have further proved that under microaerophilic conditions, global energy regulation was effective for the improvement of the hydrogen metabolism. Somewhat differently, when the initial volume fraction of oxygen was 0.8%, the wild strain reached maximum hydrogen productivity, but when the initial volume fraction of oxygen was higher 2.1%, the PPK-overexpressing strain reached maximum hydrogen productivity. These results showed that higher PPK activities enabled the cells to fast utilize more oxygen and accumulate more ATP than the wild strain. The fast accumulated more energy promoted more hydrogen production by PPK-overexpressing strain. Additionally, PPK does not directly involve in the hydrogen production. In fact, in our results, PPK activity had no clear or direct relation with the hydrogen production. Overexpression of PPK could greatly adjust cellular global energy level. Then the changed cellular energy made the whole substrate metabolism and energy metabolism redistributed. Hydrogen production is only one part of cellular metabolism. Because of complexity of cellular metabolic networks, so it is very hard to get a relation between the hydrogen production and PPK activity. Compared with the wild strain in the strict anaerobic conditions (0% of oxygen), with PPK overexpression and initial 2.1% of oxygen, the hydrogen production per liter of culture, the hydrogen production per cell and the hydrogen yield per mol glucose increased by 20.1%, 12.3% and 10.8%, respectively. The residual cellular ATP level was further measured. After 17h of cultivation, the residual ATP content of strict anaerobic cultivated wild strain was 154.8±2.6nmol/g-DCW. However, when the initial oxygen volume fraction was 2.1%, after 17h of cultivation, PPK-overexpressing strain showed 725.8±6.9nmol/g-DCW of the residual ATP content, which further demonstrated that expression of PPK could allow the cells to conserve more energy in aerobic environment and release the accumulated energy in anaerobic environment. Therefore, in the presence of phosphates, we could express PPK in the hydrogen-producing strain for conserving and releasing the energy via synthesis and degradation of polyP by switching of aerobic and anaerobic environments, which eventually affected the hydrogen metabolism."
11,Effects of PPK overexpression on cellular metabolism,"3.4 Effects of PPK overexpression on cellular metabolism After 17h of cultivation, under different microaerophilic conditions, the cell all produced the hydrogen as shown in Table 3, which showed that cells finally all entered into the anaerobic environment. The major organic metabolic products from the greatest to the smallest, were detected to be lactate, acetate, ethanol, 2,3-butanediol and succinate. No formate was detected, which showed that formate was used up quickly for the hydrogen production [14]. Based on metabolic products, cellular metabolism was further analyzed. Formate pathway and NADH pathway were two main metabolic pathways for the hydrogen production [30–32]. As shown in Fig. 1(a and b), when the initial oxygen concentration were 0.8% and 2.1% respectively, the total hydrogen yield of wild strain and PPK-overexpressing strain reached the maximum values, respectively. Because with the increase of initial oxygen concentration, the hydrogen yield through the formate pathway decreased gradually, so the increase of total hydrogen yield was attributed to the increase of NADH pathway for the hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 1(a and b). Compared with the wild strain under strict anaerobic conditions, in the presence of limited oxygen (2.1%) and by PPK overexpression, the hydrogen production in NADH pathway increased by 62.3%. For the wild strain (Fig. 1(a)), when the initial oxygen concentration was 0.8%, compared with the strict anaerobic state, the increase of oxygen caused increase of NADH supply, which promoted the hydrogen yield through NADH pathway. But if the oxygen concentration was higher than 0.8%, more carbon flux flowed into TCA cycle to form CO2, and accordingly less carbon flux flowed into the formate pathway for the hydrogen production. Moreover, more NADH was consumed by oxidative phosphorylation, which finally caused the decrease of hydrogen yield through NADH pathway. There was a turning point, which was an appropriate initial oxygen concentration. For the PPK-overexpressing strain, the turning point was delayed to 2.1% of oxygen concentration. In other words, the overexpression of PPK could better use the NADH from the consumption of oxygen. NADH as cellular typical reducing substances, its excess could promote the hydrogen production. Van Veen et al. have reported that high polyP contents of cells can maintain a high ATP level and membrane potential during the anaerobic cultivation [33]. Hydrogen production by E. aerogenes is closely dependent upon the extracellular and intracellular redox states [17,31]. Therefore, under proper microaerophilic conditions, with the overexpression of PPK, E. aerogenes could exhaust the limited oxygen and accumulated ATP to form polyP quickly, which caused more reductive membrane potential. After the cells entered into the anaerobic state, the accumulated energy and more reductive membrane potential thus promoted the hydrogen production. The change of cellular oxidation state reflected the change of cellular metabolism [34]. More reductive oxidation states imply an excess of reducing power inside the cells, contributing to the enhanced hydrogen production from the NADH pathway [31]. In order to calculate the oxidation state balance, oxidation states of C, H and O were taken as 0, −0.5 and +1, respectively, so the oxidation state of a molecule with a formula of C x H y O z can be expressed as z −0.5y [34]. As shown in the Fig. 2(a and b), when the initial oxygen concentrations were 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively, the oxidation states of the wild strain and the PPK-overexpressed strain were the most reductive. The results of the oxidation state balance further demonstrated that, the PPK expression adjusted the cellular redox states and enabled more electrons to flow into the hydrogen production by NADH pathway, under proper microaerophilic conditions. Although the total hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes was improved by PPK overexpression under microaerophilic conditions, it was still less than its theoretical yield. Chen et al. carried out a theoretical stoichiometric analysis of hydrogen-producing strains [5]. The maximum yield of hydrogen on glucose by K. pneumoniae under anaerobic conditions is estimated to be 2.86mol/mol. However, the ability of K. pneumoniae to produce hydrogen will presumably increased drastically under microaerophilic conditions, and the maximum hydrogen yield on glucose is calculated as 6.68mol/mol (high as 2.34 times as that under anaerobic conditions) at a special case, i.e. all pyruvate enters into TCA cycle, only about a half of NADH2 or FADH2 generated in glucose metabolism is oxidized by oxygen to produce ATP in respiratory chain, and no redundant biomass is formed. Therefore, it is possible to further improve the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes under microaerophilic conditions by regulating the cellular metabolism, such as TCA cycle, the cellular oxidative phosphorylation and so on, which need further studies."
12,Conclusion,"Using E. aerogenes IAM1183 as the model strain, we studied effects of different microaerophilic conditions on cell growth, glucose concentration and hydrogen production of wild E. aerogenes strain and PPK-overexpressing strain. Also, cellular metabolism was further analyzed. (1) Compared with the control (pMCL), the ppk gene was overexpressed successfully in E. aerogenes. With the overexpression of PPK and different microaerophilic condition, cell growth, glucose consumption and hydrogen production were better than that of the wild strain. (2) When the initial oxygen concentration were 0.8% and 2.1% respectively, cell growth, glucose consumption and hydrogen production of wild E. aerogenes strain and PPK-overexpressing strain reached the maximum values, respectively. (3) The increase of the total hydrogen yield was attributed to the increase of NADH pathway for the hydrogen production. Also, the result of more negative cellular oxidation state balance demonstrated that, under proper microaerophilic conditions, cellular PPK expression adjusted cellular oxidation states and made more electrons flow into the hydrogen production by NADH pathway."
