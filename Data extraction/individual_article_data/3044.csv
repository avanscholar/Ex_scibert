0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant applied in several important processes, for instance pulp and paper bleaching, water-cleaning, disinfection and industrial synthesis of consumer goods [1,2]. At present, H2O2 is manufactured almost exclusively through the anthraquinone process in centralized reactors, where it is often concentrated up to 70wt% to reduce costs [3]. However, as typical end-users require concentrations of 2–8wt% [2], local production by means of a less energy demanding synthetic technology is desirable [4]. Electrochemical reactors represent an attractive alternative for the production of H2O2 via O2 reduction on-site. Intensive research has been carried out over recent years both in alkaline [5,6] and acidic medium [7–9]. However, as H2O2 degradation can be base catalysed, more promising is the synthesis in acidic medium [10]. In acid, H2O2 is synthesized from O2 and protons in a 2-electron ORR pathway (O2(g) +2H+ (aq) +2e− →H2O2(aq)) [11], which has a standard potential of 0.69V [12]. The well-developed technology of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) could be directly utilized for eventual H2O2 production and collection of electrical current on a larger scale. Noble metals such as Pt and Pd are the most promising PEM-FC catalysts, due to their high stability at potentials of operational interest in acidic environments [12]. However, both tend to reduce O2 to H2O in a 4-electron pathway with high faradaic efficiencies [11]. Recently, the addition of mercury to Pt or Pd led to the discovery of unprecedentedly active electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, which was ascribed to the synergetic presence of two metals with different oxygen binding energies [8,13]. However, the toxicity of Hg might ultimately limit the application of these alloys. Au and Au-Pd catalysts were shown to have the lowest overpotential besides Hg-based catalysts [8]. In addition, Au and Pd are safe and, due to their high dissolution onset-potential, are also promising candidates in acidic media [14]. In recent years, AuPd nanoparticles supported on carbon and oxide materials have been extensively studied as heterogeneous catalysts for direct H2O2 synthesis from molecular H2 and O2 [15]. Pd binds oxygen intermediates strongly and has a low ORR overpotential similar to Pt [16]. Au shows remarkable variation in kinetics and mechanism of the ORR varying between 2- and 4-electrons processes, depending on support, crystallographic orientation, size and pH [17–19]. Such behavior is common to all electrodes that interact weakly with O2 (i.e. Au, Ag, Hg) [17,20]. The alloy of Au and Pd, has been shown to influence activity and selectivity for the ORR [7,21,22]. Jirkovsky et al. studied the influence of carbon supported Au-Pd catalysts (Pd<50%) and showed that the addition of a small fraction (8%) of Pd leads to an increase in H2O2 selectivity compared to pure Au [7]. This was attributed to the ensemble (or geometric) effect caused by the presence of finely dispersed Pd in Au, influencing the O2 adsorption on the catalyst surface [23]. Erikson et al. studied the ORR behavior of Au-Pd electrodeposited catalysts with higher Pd% (only Pd>50%) however particle size distributions were variable between samples [22]. In this context, we studied the performance of colloidal AuPd nanoparticles immobilized directly onto an electrode over a wide range between pure Au and Pd (Au, Au9Pd, Au3Pd, AuPd, AuPd3, Pd) and with controlled particle size distributions around 3–4nm (statistical size from TEM micrographs). In particular, we present their ORR activity, H2O2 selectivity and the PROR in an acidic environment with the rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE). Finally, potentiostatic production of H2O2 (2 and 30min) provides us additional information on the catalyst behavior in real systems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization For the preparation of Au-Pd nanoparticles a colloidal synthesis method described elsewhere was followed [24]. An aqueous solution (800ml, HPLC grade water) containing metal precursors in the desired ratio was prepared from stock solutions of PdCl2 (6mgPd ml−1, Sigma Aldrich, Reagent Plus® 99%) and HAuCl4·3H2O (12.5mgAu ml−1 Sigma Aldrich,Au assay ⩾49.0%) with a total metal content of 20mg metal in 800ml. Separately aqueous solutions of NaBH4 (Sigma Aldrich, 0.1M) and Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (1wt% aqueous solution, Sigma Aldrich, MW=10000, 80% hydrolyzed) were also prepared. PVA addition to the metal solution (PVA/(Au+Pd) (w/w)=1.2) was followed by addition of a freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 (0.1M, NaBH4/(Au+Pd) (mol/mol)=5) to form a dark-brown sol which is generated in 30min. The obtained solutions were finally concentrated using a rotary evaporator to 0.1mgmetal ml−1. For examination by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), to determine the particle size distributions, a JEOL 2200FS TEM operating at 200kV was used. The prepared solutions were dispersed onto a lacey carbon film supported by a gold TEM grid and then subjected to bright field contrast. The Au:Pd molar ratios were measured by ICP-MS (NexION 300X, Perkin Elmer) by dissolving the AuPd samples in boiling aqua regia (4ml solution, Merck Suprapur acids). XPS measurements were performed applying a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV) operating at 15kV and 25W (Quantera II, Physical Electronics, Chanhassen). Analysis of the spectra was carried out using Casa XPS (http://www.casaxps.com/)."
3,Electrochemical characterization,"2.2 Electrochemical characterization All electrochemical results were obtained via thin-film technique either on a rotating disc electrode (RDE, Ar background and PROR) or rotating ring–disc electrode (RRDE) method. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (≈24°C) in a three electrode Teflon cell and potentials refers to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), measured prior to experiments. Mirror polished poly-Pt, poly-Au, poly-Pd (5mm, MaTeck) and Au-Pd catalysts (10μgmetal cm−2) on glassy carbon (GC) with an area of 0.196cm2 were alternated as working electrodes. Both the counter electrode, a graphite rod, and the reference electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (Metrohm), were separated by a Nafion membrane (Tschurl modification). Potentiostat (Gamry Reference 600) and rotator (MSR Pine Rotator System) were controlled with a Gamry V6 Software. The supporting electrolyte was gas (Ar or O2) purged 0.1M HClO4, prepared by dilution of concentrated perchloric acid (Suprapur®, Merck) in ultrapure water (PureLab Plus system, Elga, 18MΩcm). For PROR, 10mM H2O2 (AnalaR NORMAPUR) were added to the Ar purged electrolyte. More details about the single electrochemical method are available in the SI."
4,Results and discussion,
5,TEM and surface characterization,"3.1 TEM and surface characterization The Au-Pd nanoparticles (Au, Au9Pd, Au3Pd, AuPd, AuPd3, Pd) were prepared through a sol-immobilization method yielding the presence of a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, as recently described [24]. The average particle size and size distribution are estimated statistically from bright field STEM micrographs (Figs.1 a and b and S1.1–5). The sizes are summarized in Table 1 along with the Au:Pd molar ratios estimated with ICP-MS and XPS (Fig.1c). XPS spectra (Fig.1c) show a shift in Au 4f photoelectron peak towards lower binding energies once Pd is present, which is a typical feature observed for Au-Pd alloys [25]. The molar ration of the Au9Pd estimated by XPS differs slightly from the value obtained via ICPMS. For low Pd content the estimation of the molar ratio with XPS is less accurate owing to direct overlap between Pd(3d) and Au(4d) peaks. The shape of the initial Ar background cyclic voltammograms (CVs) (Fig.1d and as reference poly-Au and poly-Pd electrodes in Figs. S2.1–2) are related to the surface state and composition. The upper potential limit (UPL) of 1.6 VRHE is chosen in order to measure the Au oxide (denoted as Au-O due to lack of information about stoichiometry) reduction peak which is only distinguishable with high UPLs [26]. Typical features of Au and Pd vary with the composition. Hydrogen under potential deposition (HUPD) is only present in samples with high Pd content (from 1:1M ratio Au:Pd onwards). Furthermore, two peaks in the HUPD are observed for AuPd3 and Pd in accordance with previous literature [27]. Proceeding anodically, the onset potential for the Pd oxide (Pd-O is used as exact composition is not known) and Au-O formation are around 0.7 VRHE and 1.3 VRHE respectively. The cathodic scan is dominated by two main features, namely Au-O and Pd-O reductions. For pure Pd and Au catalysts the maxima of the respective reduction peak were measured at 0.6 VRHE and 1.1 VRHE. The presence of one or two reduction peaks reflects the composition: (i) for low Pd content (Au9Pd) only the Au-O reduction is visible (as in [7]), whereas (ii) for high Pd content (AuPd3) only the Pd-O reduction is present (as in [28]); (iii) for intermediate compositions (Au3Pd and AuPd), instead, two peaks are observed. Interestingly, the Pd-O peak position shifts significantly when Pd is mixed to Au. Such a shift has been attributed to alloying [7,22,28] and was exploited by Rand and Woods to define the surface composition based on a linear dependence with the reduction potential [29]. However, this approach was shown to be limited only to high Pd content (>40%) [28,30] and for Au-Pd non-polarized to HUPD where H absorption might take place [28]. Even though quantification is difficult, the position and the associated charges are good indicators of surface composition changes. Note, that also potential cycling might cause minor changes in surface composition due to metal segregation [21]."
6,Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR),"3.2 Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) The ORR on Au-Pd nanoparticles is studied with the RRDE (calibration in Figs. S3.1–2) with simultaneous H2O2 monitoring at the ring during the ORR. From the detected currents, disc (Id) and ring (Ir), the H2O2 selectivity (SH2O2) is derived. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 (Au and Pd polycrystals are reported in Figs. S4.1–4). The ORR data collected at the disc (Id in Fig.2a) show at a glance, how the composition significantly affects the ORR onset potentials: from 0.4 VRHE for Au it shifts positively, until 0.9 VRHE for Pd. The theoretical diffusion limited currents (dashed lines in Fig.2a) calculated from the Levich equation [31] suggest a mechanism change from a 2- (dominant H2O2 production) to a 4-electrons process with increasing Pd content. The presence of H2O2 is confirmed by the Ir profiles (Fig.2b), corresponding to H2O2 oxidation (H2O2 →O2 +2H+ +2e−). The total H2O2 current (Iper) can be estimated from correcting Ir by the collection efficiency N and compared to Id (Fig. S4.5). As observed from the Id and the Ir, H2O2 production is considerably influenced by composition. In particular, the highest Ir is measured for pure Au (∼0.32mAcmgeo −2 @0.1 VRHE) and the lowest for Pd (<0.05mAcmgeo −2). Interestingly, for low Pd contents (Au, Au9Pd, Au3Pd) the onset potentials at the ring and the disc coincide, while for the remaining composition (AuPd, AuPd3, Pd) the Ir onset potential remains constant at a value close to the standard potential (0.69V). Note that, in a 2-electron process the peak of the volcano plot coincides with the standard potential. Thus, a catalyst for the H2O2 production can have zero overpotential [32]. Tentatively, the lack of overpotential can explain the fact that the Ir onset potential for active catalysts coincide. Interestingly, for AuPd3 and Pd an Ir peak is observed at low potential (<0.2–0.3 VRHE) where Pd is covered with hydrogen. This is well known also for Pt-based catalysts [33]. As Ir, the SH2O2 (Fig.2c) decreases with Pd content from a SH2O2,max of ∼95% to less than 10% for pure Au and Pd respectively. As also observed elsewhere, both SH2O2 and Ir exhibit a maximum [7,8,13]. Tentatively, this can be attributed to a mechanism change with increasing overpotential. As for the onset-potential also the maxima of Ir and SH2O2 are shifting similarly with the composition (Fig.2d). The high SH2O2 of Au is confirmed also with poly-Au (see Fig. S4.4). Both show similar onset potentials and SH2O2 around 95–98%. In a recent publication on carbon supported Au-Pd catalysts, Jirkovsky et al. observed a SH2O2 enhancement for low Pd concentration (<15%) with a maximum for 8% Pd [7], whose SH2O2 approached 95%. This was attributed to geometric effect due the presence of single Pd atoms surrounded by Au. Our Au9Pd does not show improvement in terms of SH2O2 compared to the pure Au sample, whose SH2O2 is already approaching 95%. The influence of the support and of isolated Pd needs to be further addressed in future studies. Indeed, first principles calculation suggests an influence on SH2O2 due to geometric effect [34], that could correspond to a shift in onset potential while maintaining a high SH2O2."
7,Peroxide Reduction and Oxidation Reaction (PROR),"3.3 Peroxide Reduction and Oxidation Reaction (PROR) Once produced, H2O2 can “degrade” through: (i) electrochemical peroxide reduction (PRR) (H2O2 +2e− +2H+ →2H2O), (ii) electrochemical peroxide oxidation (POR) (H2O2 →O2 +2e− +2H+) and (iii) chemical disproportionation (2H2O2 →2H2O+O2). The latter is influenced by the reaction environment, whereas the others are mainly related to the catalyst surface and presence of impurities [35,36]. It is therefore of utmost importance to answer the question of whether the produced H2O2 would be further reduced in a fuel cell at operational potentials, dominated by ORR. PROR was studied in Ar-saturated 0.1M HClO4 containing 10mM of H2O2 (Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, the polarization curves match around 0.8 VRHE. At such potential, the dominating reaction (PRR to POR) changes with the surface state (reduced to oxidized), as observed for poly-Pt [36]. The Pd oxidation onset is ∼0.7 VRHE, which is indeed when the PRR current starts to decrease (see also poly-Pd in Fig. S5.1). Inactive metals for ORR are also less active for PRR: an increase in Au content corresponds to a proportional decrease in both ORR (Fig. 2) and PRR (Fig. 3). This trend is also confirmed by previous literature on co-electrodeposited Au-Pd [22,37]. Already at 10% Pd content an undesired (even though limited) increase in the H2O2 reduction current was observed. As Au is selective and not active for the PRR, it can be indicated as the best candidate for applications that require high SH2O2."
8,Potentiostatic H2O2 production,"3.4 Potentiostatic H2O2 production To finally bridge the gap between “real application” and our fundamental studies we need to understand how the catalysts behave during continuous H2O2 production. RRDE data (Figs. 4 and S6.1) during 2min potentiostatic condition (potential of Ir,max for each composition) confirms the activity and SH2O2 trend observed in the previous sections. Interestingly, the Ir (and thus SH2O2) slightly increases with time for Pd rich catalysts (AuPd3, Pd). This is even more evident during the 30min measurements (see Fig. S6.1) and can be tentatively attributed to the presence of either impurities or spectator species that initially poison active sites favoring the H2O2 production, as observed for Pt [38]. Such spectator species can be easily removed with a simple CV [13]; indeed, the ORR behavior before and after the measurement is not affected (see Fig. S6.2). The productivity (Table 2 ) of the catalyst after 2 and 30min is determined from the POR limiting current on Pt (see calibration in Fig. S6.3). In line with the high SH2O2 and low PRR activity of Au, its productivity is the highest. Thus, the measurement on Au was extended to 1 and 2h yielding 12.3 and 22.9molgmetal −1 cmgeo −2. With increasing Pd content, the SH2O2 decreases and PRR activity increases, resulting in a proportional productivity decrease. Despite the low productivity expected for 4-electron catalysts with low SH2O2 as Pd, it yields ∼2.40molgmetal −1 cmgeo −2 after 30min. This can be again attributed to a poisoning of the active sites for complete reduction, favoring a 2-electron process."
9,Conclusions,"A set of Au-Pd nanocatalysts are synthesized as model catalysts to study the electrocatalytic behavior for H2O2 synthesis from fundamental perspectives and for continuous H2O2 production. The ORR and the PROR behavior are significantly affected by the composition: upon an increase the Au content we observe an increase in Ir and SH2O2, whereas the onset is shifting to lower potentials. The SH2O2 of Au is the highest (95%) at the price of low activity. Previous theoretical studies as well as experimental works suggest that geometrical effects (triggered by the presence of atomically dispersed Pd in Au) might enhance the activity while maintaining high SH2O2, which is however not observed in this work. For Au9Pd and Au3Pd, the activity is indeed higher (i.e. H2O2 formation onset potential is already close to nominal for Au3Pd), but the SH2O2 decreases while remaining relatively high (between 60 and 80%). With an eye on applications, these compositions might still be interesting where a compromise between SH2O2 and energy output is allowed, as the typical end-user requires H2O2 concentration in the range 2–8wt%. On the other hand, if high H2O2 concentration and high SH2O2 is required, pure Au would potentially be the catalyst of choice, as the productivity during a potentiostatic measurement indicates (highest productivity that steadily increases up to 2h). Our observations on a spectrum of compositions between elements with contrasting O2 adsorption energy can be extended to other alloys with similar characteristic. The fundamental studies help to forecast the ORR behavior and reaction selectivity for potential applications. Furthermore, future investigations on fuel cells, on the stability of catalysts, as well as on the effect of support are of particular importance to understand how these catalysts will perform in real applications."
