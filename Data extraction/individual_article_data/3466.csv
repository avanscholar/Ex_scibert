0,Introduction,"Cleaner production is defined by the United Nations Environment Programme [1] as the continuous application of an integrated preventive environmental strategy to processes, products, and services to increase overall efficiency, and reduce risks to humans and the environment. For production processes, cleaner production results from one or a combination of approaches for conserving raw materials, water and energy; eliminating toxic and dangerous raw materials and reducing the quantity and toxicity of all emissions and wastes at source during the production process. Hydrogen peroxide is considered to be a green oxidant since its decomposition only generates water and oxygen. It is widely used in the pulp and paper, textile, chemical synthesis and environmental protection industries etc. [2,3]. Currently the industrial production method of hydrogen peroxide is the AO process, which was commercialized by DuPont in 1953. In 2003, global capacity (excluding China) reached 2.74 million metric tons (mt)/year [4] in 100% hydrogen peroxide (the listed capacity for China in [4] was only 110,000mt/year, which was much lower than the real capacity shown below). China began to produce hydrogen peroxide in the 1950s by the electrolysis method. The development of the hydrogen peroxide industry in the 1980s entered a new era when the industrial AO process was successfully developed by the Liming Research Institute of Chemical Industry (LRICI) [5] and was transferred to companies in China. The trend of the hydrogen peroxide capacity in China in the past decade is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the hydrogen peroxide capacity increased from 119,000mt/year in 1994 to 670,000mt/year (including 40,000mt/year in Taiwan) in 2004 with annual rate of increase as high as 19%. This indicates that China has become the world's largest hydrogen peroxide producer [6]. When the AO process was first commercialized in China, it was far from cleaner: the consumption of raw materials, water, and energy was high. Low boiling point, highly water-soluble and toxic solvents were used and large amounts of by-products and wastes were generated. With continuous technological improvements and process innovation, the hydrogen peroxide production process in China is becoming cleaner and cleaner. It was recently certified by State Economic and Trading Commission (SETC) of China as a cleaner production technology for priority industries in China [7]. This paper discusses the pathway toward the cleaner production of the hydrogen peroxide industry in China from the viewpoint of process development and design."
1,Brief introduction of AO process in China,"The chemical principle and schematic diagram of a typical AO process developed by LRICI are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. The compound, 2-ethyl anthraquinone (EAQ, 1) is dissolved in a solvent mixture of alkyl-aromatics and long chain alcohol or phosphate to form a solution (called working solution, flowrate: several tens m3/h to several hundreds m3/h) and then hydrogenated by the catalyst (Raney-Ni or Pd/Al2O3) in the hydrogenation step under mild reaction conditions (temperature: 40–80°C, pressure: several MPa) to form anthrahydroquinone (EH2AQ, 2), which is then oxidized by compressed air in the oxidation step (temperature: <60°C, pressure: several MPa) to generate hydrogen peroxide and to regenerate EAQ. During this process, small amounts of EH2AQ can be further hydrogenated to form mainly 2-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-anthrahydroquinone (H4EH2AQ, 4, which can also be oxidized to generate hydrogen peroxide and to regenerate H4EAQ, 3) and some by-products (referred to as degradation products). The generated hydrogen peroxide is extracted by deionized water from the working solution in the extraction step to produce crude hydrogen peroxide, which can be further treated in the purification and concentration steps under vacuum to produce final hydrogen peroxide products (27.5–70% in concentration). The working solution from the extraction step is treated in a post-treatment step to regenerate the degradations and is then circulated back to the hydrogenation step to start the next cycle of production. The process with Raney-Ni as the hydrogenation catalyst is hereinafter referred to as AO–Ni process, while the process with Pd/Al2O3 is referred to as AO–Pd process."
2,Toward cleaner production of hydrogen peroxide,
3,To reduce the consumption of raw materials,"3.1 To reduce the consumption of raw materials 3.1.1 The development of catalyst and reactor [8] The Raney-Ni catalyst used in AO–Ni process is prepared from aluminum–nickel alloy. The catalyst size is small in order to be properly suspended in the stirring vessel (hydrogenation reactor). The filtration system must be carefully designed and installed to prevent catalyst leakage and to meet the requirement of continuous operation. This catalyst should also be stored in a solvent to prevent it from self-ignition in air before being added to the reactor. Raney-Ni catalyst has high activity and relatively low selectivity. Therefore AO–Ni process cannot be operated at high hydrogenation extent (anthraquinone being hydrogenated/total anthraquinone in working solution). Otherwise the consumption of EAQ will be higher. To solve this problem, Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was developed by LRICI. This new catalyst has both high activity and high selectivity allowing higher hydrogenation extent with lower EAQ consumption. Another advantage of this new catalyst is that it can be easily regenerated inside the reactor when it gradually loses its activity. After regeneration, the catalytic activity is fully recovered with similar or even higher selectivity. This ensures the lower consumption of catalyst. With the successful application of the new Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the complicated three-phase stirring vessel was replaced by a three-phase fixed bed reactor. This new reactor features a simple structure that is easy to scale-up and operate. Currently, the capacity of a single AO–Pd process plant can reach over 40,000mt/year. After being commercialized, the AO–Pd process quickly replaced the AO–Ni process and became the dominating technology for producing hydrogen peroxide. At the end of last century about 65% of hydrogen peroxide was produced by AO–Pd process; at present over 90% of hydrogen peroxide is produced by AO–Pd process in China. 3.1.2 The replacement of solvents [8,9] The solvents used in the AO process are a mixture of non-polar and polar solvents. The non-polar solvent is used to dissolve anthraquinone; it is usually alkyl-aromatics. The polar solvent used to dissolve anthrahydroquinone is usually either hydroterpineol (HT) or trioctyl phosphate (TOP). When the AO process was first developed in China, benzene was used as the non-polar solvent. Because of its low boiling point and high solubility in water as shown in Table 1, the consumption of aromatics was very high, even over 25kg/t of 100% hydrogen peroxide [10]. Its toxicity is also relatively high. As soon as high boiling point, low water-soluble and low toxic C9–C10 aromatics were available, research was conducted to use them to replace benzene. At present, C9–C10 aromatics are the only non-polar solvents used in AO process. Hydroterpineol (HT) is used in AO–Ni process, while trioctyl phosphate (TOP) is used in AO–Pd process. The advantages of TOP over HT are also shown in Table 1: (1) higher boiling point and lower viscosity; and (2) lower solubility in water. TOP also has a higher capacity for dissolving anthrahydroquinone (AHQ) and a higher partition coefficient in the extraction operation under the optimal solvent ratio. Therefore, the consumption of TOP in AO–Pd process is less than 50% of HT in AO–Ni process. Currently, most hydrogen peroxide plants use TOP as the polar solvent. The replacement of benzene with C9–C10 aromatics and HT with TOP led to the improvement of product quality, especially the organic impurities in hydrogen peroxide that were dramatically decreased from 500–1000ppm (as total organic carbon, TOC) to less than 200ppm. 3.1.3 The recovery of solvents from vent gas The vent gas from the oxidation step usually contained about 1% (v/v) solvents. An integrated expansion-refrigeration and activated carbon adsorption method was used to recover both energy and solvents. A typical treatment result is shown in Table 2 [11]. As can be seen from Table 2 most of the solvents could be recovered with this treatment method and the organic content in vent gases could meet the requirement of China National Standard for Waste Gas Emission. 3.1.4 The regeneration of degradations [12] Because of the complication of the organic reaction, side reactions will inevitably take place during the hydrogenation and oxidation steps resulting in the degradation of EAQ and H4EAQ. This causes the loss of active anthraquinone, increases the density and viscosity of the working solution, and increases the water content in the working solution. These side effects can result in abnormal operation of the plants. An effective way to reduce the content of degradation is to regenerate them. The experimental results revealed that alkali alumina had a strong ability to regenerate degradations back to active anthraquinone; it is now used as an online regeneration agent. However, even with online regeneration, the working solution still contains degradations after a certain period of operation. Therefore, a certain amount of the working solution should be withdrawn from the plant and be treated with different methods as shown in Table 3."
4,To reduce the consumption of energy,"3.2 To reduce the consumption of energy 3.2.1 New purification and concentration process Gelbein [13] pointed out that the primary steam consumption in the AO process was in the purification and concentration steps. Much effort had been made to reduce steam consumption and to improve operation safety. The conventional method to purify and concentrate hydrogen peroxide in China is illustrated in Fig. 4 [14]: the crude hydrogen peroxide was almost totally evaporated in the primary evaporator; the primary residue was diluted by deionized water and then entered the secondary evaporator for further evaporation. The evaporated hydrogen peroxide entered the distillation column to produce the final product. The drawbacks of this method are: (1) the energy consumption was high since almost whole crude hydrogen peroxide solution was evaporated; (2) there were safety issues in the secondary evaporator due to high concentrations of impurities in the residue; and (3) the final product yield was only 95–97%. Therefore, research was conducted to overcome these drawbacks. The newly developed process shown in Fig. 5 had the following advantages [15]: (1) integrated adsorption, ion-exchange, and filtration were used to pre-purify the crude hydrogen peroxide; (2) the pre-purified hydrogen peroxide was only partially evaporated in the evaporator to eliminate the potential decomposition of hydrogen peroxide; the residue was the concentrated product (which accounts for about 70–80% of total product); the evaporated hydrogen peroxide entered the distillation column to obtain the high quality product; and (3) the steam consumption was less than half of that of the conventional process and the product yield was over 99%. In a typical run, 3032.8kg crude hydrogen peroxide (30.7%) was pumped directly into filter (3) at the flowrate of 330L/h; it then entered the adsorption column (4) and pre-heater (5) and evaporator (6) under the operational pressure of about 9kPa. The evaporation ratio was controlled at about 51%. The product obtained at the bottom of separator (7) was 1602.0kg (50.3% in hydrogen peroxide); the high quality product obtained at the bottom of distillation column (8) was 244.8kg (50.0% in hydrogen peroxide). The total yield of this process was 99.7%. 3.2.2 The application of DCS and variable-speed pump [16,17] In the middle of 1990s, distributed control systems (DCS) and variable-speed pumps were successfully applied in hydrogen peroxide plants. The usage of these new technologies greatly improved the operational stability, plant safety and reduced the energy consumption for the driving system."
5,To reduce the emission of wastes [8],"3.3 To reduce the emission of wastes [8] 3.3.1 The treatment of waste gas The only waste gas in AO process is from the oxidation step. The treatment of it was discussed in Section 3.1.3. 3.3.2 The treatment of wastewater A certain amount of wastewater can be generated in the AO process. It mainly contains small amounts of solvents, EAQ and its derivatives, and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation and concentration steps. This wastewater can be treated by the so-called Fenton method. Since hydrogen peroxide already exists in the wastewater, only a small amount of ferrous salt is needed to perform the Fenton reaction. Experimental studies [18] showed that under optimized treatment conditions, the COD and TOC contents of treated wastewater were reduced to <100mg/L and <60mg/L, respectively, which meets the requirement of China National Standard for Wastewater Discharge. This treatment method was successfully applied in all hydrogen peroxide plants. 3.3.3 The treatment of solid wastes The solid wastes generated in AO process are used catalyst and alumina. The waste catalyst in the AO–Ni process can be used to produce nickel salt after proper treatment. The alumina and Pd/Al2O3 are all porous; they can adsorb as high as 30–40% of their own weight of working solution. Before being withdrawn from the equipment, they are treated with a suitable method to recover the working solution. Then waste catalyst can be sent to the precious metal factories to recover palladium and aluminum can be sent to aluminum factories for recycling."
6,Conclusions,"The hydrogen peroxide industry in China experienced the shift from the AO–Ni process to the AO–Pd process in the last 20 years with the successful development of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and with other technological improvements and innovations. The total production capacity has been increased from 119,000mt/year to 670,000mt/year in a decade. At present, the AO–Pd process is the dominant technology for producing hydrogen peroxide in China with the maximum capacity for a single plant being over 40,000mt/year. The process improvements and innovations reflect the pathways toward cleaner production of hydrogen peroxide in China: the development of new Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with both high activity and high selectivity; the usage of high boiling point, low water-soluble and low toxicity solvents; the development of new energy-saving, highly efficient concentration and purification processes; the regeneration of degradations; the recovery of solvents from vent gas and the proper treatment of wastes. At the end of last century, this technology was listed by State Economic and Trading Commission (SETC) as a cleaner production technology for priority industries in China. One should clearly understand that although the current AO–Pd process for producing hydrogen peroxide is considered to be a cleaner production technology in China, it is far from green in view of the green chemistry concept. The most promising technology in the future will be direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen without using anthraquinone as the reaction carrier."
