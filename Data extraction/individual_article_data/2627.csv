0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) reactions depending on solar energy conversion from water was considered to be a promising strategy to alleviate the dual pressure of fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution [1–3]. A series of researches and modifications, till now, had been made around metal oxides [4], metal sulfides [5], polymers [6], and organic frameworks [7,8] in reported literatures, which significantly promoted the advance of PHE reactions. However, largely restricted by the inefficiency of photo-generated carrier separation and transfer, most of the active sites in composite catalysts still remained in a state of inactivation to reduce protons from water [9,10] and the PHE performance was hard to live up to expectations with sustained stability. In particular, the hydrogen bubbling phenomenon that observed directly by naked eyes was even fewer in this field [11–13], indicating an actual drawback in the way to obtain highly efficient PHE performance. Therefore, it was of practical significance to develop valuably long-term catalysts with superior activity and stability in evolving bubbled hydrogen from water to drive the sustainable utilization of green energy. It was believed that an ideal catalyst of ZnIn2S4 was adapted for triggering PHE reactions due to its suitable band alignment and satisfactorily negative potential for reducing protons from water [14,15], totally meaning a latent material that was likely to make a breakthrough in achieving robust PHE. At present, most of the reported morphology of ZnIn2S4 were nanotubes [16], nanowires [17], solid microspheres [18], and self-assembly thin layers [19], in which those with loose structure tended to expose more active sites and exhibited higher activity than that of solid morphology toward hydrogen generation. Hence, the purposeful creation of hollow structured ZnIn2S4 with loose sites exposed as much as possible could provide infinite possibilities for the enhancement of PHE activity. Throughout the literatures, however, the directional synthesis of hollow ZnIn2S4-based catalysts with robust PHE performance under simulated and real sunlight irradiation had not been covered yet. In recent years, with large specific surface area and rich pore distribution, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) represented excellent characteristic in many fields, such as gas storage [20], chemical species separation [21], drug delivery [22], sensors [23], biomedical imaging [24] and photocatalysis [25]. To overcome the low efficiency of PHE reactions, some directive works had involved MOFs as trap sites or co-catalysts after coupling with semiconductor materials, and the intimate contact interface largely favored the charge separation and transfer, all leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance [26,27]. Moreover, the organic ligand of the frameworks had also been confirmed to promote the light absorption and boost charge transfer for enhancing photocatalytic activity [28]. In addition to the above advantages, particularly, MOFs also could be picked to be substrate templates for the synthesis of hollow frame materials in some occasions [29,30], because the outline of MOFs was relatively easy to be maintained, possibly providing a feasible routine for the construction of regularly hollow structured ZnIn2S4 composites. Inspired by this idea, the regular MIL-68 (In) rods, one category of In-MOFs was pertinently brought forward in this work through a solvothermal method by coordinating In3+ ions with organic ligand 2-aminoterephthalic acid. More importantly, relying on the template modelling of MIL-68 (In) rods, a robust hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by embedded metal-organic-framework-layers (ZnIn2S4-MOFL) with loose structure exposed was subtly fabricated via a facilely one-step hydrothermal coating protocol, consequently resulting in a highly efficient photocatalyst for PHE reactions. Characterization and DFT results fully indicated that the synthesized ZnIn2S4-MOFL effectively drove the separation of photo-generated chargers, leading to an extraordinarily high photocatalytic bubbling hydrogen production performance both in simulated and real sunlight irradiation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In(NO3)3∙4.5H2O and 2-aminoterephthalic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O) were purchased from Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Thioacetamide (TAA), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), glycerol, chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6∙6H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized (DI) water and absolute alcohol were used as received without further purification."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of MIL-68(In) precursors In a typical method, 0.598 g of In(NO3)3∙4.5H2O and 0.234 g of 2-aminoterephthalic acid were together added into 20 mL of DMF and stirred vigorously for 3 h at room temperature, and the mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 125 °C for 10 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the fresh yellow solid products were filtered and washed three times with alcohol, yielding targeted MIL-68 (In) samples. Finally, the In-MOF samples could be used after overnight drying in vacuum. 2.2.2 Synthesis of pristine ZnIn2S4 The synthesis process was completed under simple hydrothermal conditions. In detail, 0.0816 g of ZnCl2, 0.1758 g of InCl3·4H2O and 0.09 g of TAA were all dissolved in 8 mL of water and 2 mL of glycerol and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 90 min. The collected samples (18 mg) were washed and then dried in vacuum oven. 2.2.3 One-step synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by metal-organic-framework-layers The above synthesized MIL-68 (In) precursor was used to achieve the one-step in situ synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by metal-organic-framework-layers, and the resulted composites were abbreviated as ZnIn2S4-MOFL. In detail, a certain amount of MIL-68 (In) (4.5, 9, 18, 36, 72 mg) was firstly dispersed in 8 mL of water and 2 mL of glycerol with ultrasound for 15 min and kept stirring for another 15 min in a flask. After totally being dispersed, 0.0816 g of ZnCl2, 0.1758 g of InCl3·4H2O and 0.09 g of TAA were sequentially added into the above dispersion and stirred vigorously for 30 min to prepare the different component catalysts, which were donated as MIL-68 (In): ZnIn2S4 = 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 and 4:1). Afterwards, the mixture was placed and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C with the agitator rate fixed at 300 rpm. After suffering mild agitation for 90 min, the resulting products were collected by centrifuging, washing and drying in vacuum overnight, finally yielding the ZnIn2S4-MOFL photocatalysts. 2.2.4 Synthesis of metal-organic-framework-layers The procedure followed the above synthetic ZnIn2S4-MOFL method, without the addition of related ZnCl2, InCl3·4H2O and TAA reagents. 2.2.5 Two-step synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by metal-organic-framework-layers The pre-obtained metal-organic-framework-layer powders were firstly dispersed in 8 mL of water and 2 mL of glycerol, followed with the addition of same amount of ZnCl2, InCl3·4H2O and TAA reagents. The next steps were similar to the previous one-step synthesis of ZnIn2S4-MOFL. The prepared composites with two-step synthesis methods were briefly donated as T-ZnIn2S4-MOFL."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystal structures of all samples were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D2, Bruker Corp., Germany). The morphologies of the samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom Prox, Netherlands) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI). The optical properties were recorded using an ultraviolet/visible diffuse-reflectance spectrometer (Lambda 650S, PERKIN ELMER) equipped with an integration sphere. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet iS10 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). The surface chemical state and composition of the samples were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5300) with Mg Kα radiation and all binding energies were calibrated to the contaminated C 1s peak (284.6 eV). The specific surface area (SBET) was estimated on a Micromeritics Tristar 3020 surface area analyzer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument (FLS1000) at room temperature with a xenon lamp as excitation source. For steady PL, the excitation wavelength was set at 350 nm, while for time resolved transient fluorescence (TRTF) spectra, the average lifetime (Ave. τ) of samples was calculated according to the formula τ = A 1 ∙ τ 1 2 + A 2 ∙ τ 2 2 A 1 ∙ τ 1 + A 2 ∙ τ 2 (Ai was the PL intensity and τi represented the fitting lifetime). The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were collected on the Bruker A300. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using 400WB AVANCE III model."
5,Photoelectrochemical test,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical test The working photoelectrodes were prepared as follows: 2 mg powders of photocatalysts were dispersed in a mixed solution containing 800 μL of deionized water, 150 μL of ethanol and 50 μL of Nafion with ultrasound for 30 min. The mixed solution was then dropped and dried several times on FTO substrate. The photocurrent response curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plots were all accomplished in an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI760E, China) using three electrode system, in which a Pt slice, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and the prepared photoelectrode were used as counter electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as light sources and 0.1 M of Na2SO4 aqueous solution was chosen as the electrolytes. The Mott-Schottky measurement of all samples was conducted in a potential range from -1.0 V to 0.5 V under a frequency of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 kHz."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution measurement,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution measurement The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) was initiated in a closed container connecting to a gas circulation externally. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp (Intensity: 262 mW/cm2, Perfect Light, Beijing Co., China) and the reaction temperature was controlled at 20 °C by circulating cooling water. In detail, 5 mg of synthesized photocatalyst, as well as 28 μL of chloroplatinic acid (1 mg/mL) were together added to 100 mL of deionized water containing Na2S·9H2O (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) as sacrificial agents. After dispersing for 30 min, the composite dispersion was transferred to a quartz reactor and evacuated by a vacuum pump. The hydrogen was sampled by extracting gases every 60 min and monitored using a gas chromatograph fitted with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of PHE reactions were measured using different monochromatic light filter (320, 350, 400, 420, 450 nm) and the AQEs were calculated according to the following equation: AQEs % = 2 × number of evolved H 2 molecules number of incident photons × 100 % = 2 × n H 2 × N A × h × c S × P × t × λ × 100 % Where nH2 was the amount of H2 molecules, NA was Avogadro constant, h was the Planck constant, c was the speed of light, S was the irradiation area, P was the intensity of irradiation light, t was the photoreaction time, and λ represented the wavelength of monochromatic light."
7,Theoretical calculation details,"2.6 Theoretical calculation details All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out within the periodic plane wave framework as implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [31]. The electron-ion interaction was represented by the projector augmented wave (PAW), and the kinetic energy cutoff of plane wave was set as 400 eV. The PBE functional was utilized for geometry optimization [32,33], and the geometry convergence criterion was set as 0.08 eV/Å for the maximal component of force. The gamma-centered (3 × 2 × 1) k-point mesh was utilized to calculate the energy and electronic structures. Since PBE functional significantly underestimates the bandgap, the structure optimized with PBE was further recomputed using the hybrid functional HSE06. The ZnIn2S4 was a crystal with a layered structure, where ZnIn2S4 sheets were stacked along [001] direction. As a result, no covalent bonds, i.e., Zn-S or In-S bond was broken when cleaving the (001) surface."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Formation mechanism of synthesized photocatalyst,"3.1 Formation mechanism of synthesized photocatalyst The conception of synthesized catalysts was briefly illustrated in Scheme 1 . The MIL-68(In) formed by the coordination of metal indium cations with organic ligands exhibited loose and porous structure. After mixing with Zn2+, In3+ and S2− in a one-step hydrothermal environment (step 1), both the outer surface and inner pore structure of MIL-68(In) would be dispersed with aggregated three ions and water molecules. However, due to the instability of metal organic framework active plane to water and the oriented evolution of solid rod MOF to hollow tubular superstructures that had been reported [34], the invasion of mixed three ions and water molecules, together, would cause the disintegration of solid structure from the inside, leading to a faster inner destruction rate of MIL-68(In). Besides, the formation of hollow tubular superstructures could be ascribed to the Ostwald ripening, which could coarsen the individual MOF building units, thus resulting in a channel architecture [35]. And the water molecule, acting as competing ligands might help to limit the effect of Ostwald ripening in the collapsed process to form hollow tubular structure of MOF layer. While prolonging the reaction time, the continuous collapses of internal structure of MIL-68(In) remained and the interfacial formation of Zn-In-S was gradually strengthened at the same time (step 2), inducing the initial appearance of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 crystals that modified by embedded metal-organic-framework-layers (ZnIn2S4-MOFL). When the reaction came to the final stage (step 3), the corrosion of three ions and water molecules to MIL-68(In) from inside still tended to be unequal in comparison with that of the marginal part until the hollow structure reached the thermodynamic equilibrium state, yielding the ultimately stable metal-organic-framework-layers at this synthetic condition. Along with this process, the interfacial growth of crystal ZnIn2S4 on the outer surface of metal-organic-framework-layers proceeded synchronously. The dynamic process between the inhomogeneity of internal and external corrosion of MIL-68(In) and the keeping adhesion of ZnIn2S4 crystal on the outer edge, eventually contributed to the one-step in-situ synthesis of ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalysts."
10,Morphology and structure of photocatalyst,"3.2 Morphology and structure of photocatalyst The morphologies of MIL-68(In), ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites are orderly shown in Fig. 1 . It is observed that the solid rod structure of MIL-68(In) with a diameter of 500 nm freely distributed according to Fig. 1(a-b) and an agglomerated state of pristine ZnIn2S4 without regular distribution has been confirmed in Fig. 1(c-d). After suffering the one-step hydrothermal treatment, the surface of ZnIn2S4-MOFL turns rough and covers with layers of flocculent coating as shown in Fig. 1(e), which is totally different from the smooth surface of pristine MIL-68(In) in appearance. Interestingly, a hollow tubular structure of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composite is evidently revealed by TEM analysis as shown in Figs. 1(f) and S1, verifying the formation mechanism as discussed in Scheme 1. Additionally, the enlarged TEM image in Fig. 1(g) further indicates the tubular composition of ZnIn2S4-MOFL with a diameter of 650 nm and the lattice spacing of 0.32 nm marked in Fig. 1(h) could attribute to the (102) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, illustrating a successful synthesis of ZnIn2S4 nanocrystals on the outer surface. To prove the existence of metal-organic-framework-layers (MOFL) in ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalysts, the HRTEM image is analyzed as shown in Fig. 1(i), and the clear and blurry lattice space could be assigned to the crystal plane of ZnIn2S4 and poor crystallinity of MOFL, respectively [36]. Moreover, the mapping profiles are sequentially displayed in Fig. 1(j–o), and the elemental distribution patterns further approve the synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalysts. To prove that the coating of ZnIn2S4 on MIL-68(In) could cause a hollow tubular catalyst, the morphology changes induced by an increased mass ratio of MIL-68(In) to ZnIn2S4 from 2:1 to 4:1 proportionally, were characterized as shown in Fig. S2. There was no doubt that the increased proportion of MIL-68(In) would also lead a coating of crystal ZnIn2S4 on the surface without changing the special hollow tubular shape, indeed demonstrating a controllable strategy for the synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL. The formation mechanism of one-step synthesized hollow structure was then followed to be investigated. On one hand, the dynamically time-dependent formation of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL was recorded by observing samples in different reaction times as shown in Fig. 2 . In general, the solid structure of MIL-68(In) gradually disappeared from inside and the hollow tubular outline became more obvious. It was noted that within the first 10 min’ reaction, the solid structure was not destroyed, but the initial formation of ZnIn2S4 on the surface started, maintaining the basic outline for the synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL. When being lasted to 15−20 min, the reaction mainly included the intensified internal corrosion of MIL-68(In) and strengthened crystallization of ZnIn2S4 on outer hollow structure. XRD patterns (Fig. S3) also proved the almost disappeared diffraction peak of MIL-68(In) at this stage. The remaining processes from 40 to 80 min were the perfection of hollow tubular structure and the epitaxial growth of ZnIn2S4. Basically, it could be considered that the whole required reaction time for synthesizing ZnIn2S4-MOFL was about 80 min. According to the above analysis, it was also probable that the internal corrosion of MIL-68(In) and external crystal growth of ZnIn2S4 to form this particular hollow tubular structure of ZnIn2S4-MOFL proceeded in a parallel way. On the other hand, the one-step strategy was separated into two steps for clarifying the synthetic process of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL. Firstly, the detailed effect of water molecules and reagents on the solid rod of MIL-68(In) at heated 80 °C were investigated as shown in Fig. 3 (a–l). Results indicated that it was the pure water molecules that induced the formation of hollow tubular structure and the layer of MOF would not be reduced with prolonging the reaction time to 180 min, about 2 times longer than the real synthesis procedure. While separately putting MOF in TAA, InCl3 and ZnCl2 solution, the hollow tubular structure was totally remained, comparatively indicating a stable state of MOFL in the one-step synthesis of ZnIn2S4-MOFL. To explain the coordination bond between metal and ligand was initially broken in the core rather than on the surface, the crystal growth characteristics of MIL-68(In) precursor was then responsible. As illustrated in Fig. S4, MIL-68(In) tended to grow in the vertical direction along the cross-section with a high speed rather than expanded the width in the solvothermal conditions with DMF as solvent, meaning the outer MOF layer was a finally long-range ordered structure that extruded by the central crystal growth, which was relatively solid and strong in comparison with the central parts. Besides, this unique structure with protruding ends in MIL-68(In) had also been confirmed in reported literatures [37,38]. Herein, the vertical direction of the cross-section was more active and vulnerable when encountered external factors, such as water and other reagents. However, it had to point out that the collapsed crystal structure was caused by reagents, not by water molecules, as proved by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3(m)), where the dotted line still distinguished some diffraction signals of In-MOF, further illustrating the existence of MOFL. The three emerged peaks, additionally, might be ascribed to the formation of InxSy and residual InCl3, ZnCl2. Moreover, using the pre-prepared MOFL as templates with two-step methods, the coating of ZnIn2S4 along the outer tube wall of MOFL could still be clearly observed as shown in Fig. 3(n–q), proving the feasible routine for the preparation of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by embedded metal-organic-framework-layers. Based on the understanding of the formation of hollow tubular structure, the physical and chemical properties of the ZnIn2S4-MOFL with different component ratios were then explored. To determine the crystal phase and chemical structure information, the XRD patterns, FTIR spectra, specific surface area, pore size distribution, UV–vis/DRS spectra and tauc plots of (αhν)1/2 vs photon energy of various proportion of ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalysts were correspondingly presented in Fig. 4 . The diffraction peak appeared at 21.6 °, 27.7 ° and 47.2 ° could be attributed to the (006), (102), (110) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS card no. 65-2023) [39], respectively. When referred to MIL-68(In), the diffraction peaks were well consistent with that reported in the literatures [40,41], however, it was unapparent in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites when the additive amount was less than 1:1. Till the ratio increased to 2:1, the characteristic diffraction peak of MIL-68(In) began to appear and the strongest diffraction signal could be presented if the proportion reached 4:1 as shown in Fig. 4(a). Similar results were confirmed by FTIR spectra that aimed to reveal the surface functional groups as shown in Fig. 4(b). In general, with the increase of loading amount, the characteristic peak of MIL-68(In) gradually appeared. In specifically, the peaks at 3420 cm−1 in all samples could be associated to the stretching vibration of HOH groups of adsorbed water molecules [42]. In addition, the characteristic peak at 1615 cm−1 both in pristine ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-MOFL could be related to the absorbed hydroxyl groups [43]. Moreover, the functional groups within the region of 1195−995 cm−1 were enlarged to observe the detailed information, in which the peaks at 1160 and 1098 cm−1 were possibly ascribed to the C–H in-plane bending in benzenoid ring and CO stretching vibration [44,45], confirming the preservation of organic ligands. The peaks occurred at 1044 cm−1 could be corresponding to NH out‐of‐plane bending [46], which might be caused by the residual TAA in the as-obtained catalysts. Therefore, the XRD patterns, as well as the FTIR results all indicated a successful synthesis of ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalysts. The significantly changed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (SBET) and pore size distribution of different catalysts could provide supplemental evidence for the successful synthesis of hollow tubular ZnIn2S4-MOFL as shown in Fig. 4(c-d). With the increased contents of MIL-68(In), the SBET value of synthesized composites enlarged markedly and the highest SBET value of 197 m2/g was obtained when the mass ratio was set at 1:1. Though unobvious changes of pore diameter were observed, the dramatically increased pore volume to ∼3.7 cm3/g of ZnIn2S4-MOFL (1:1) was distinctive, consisting with the enlarged SBET results. In summary, the enlarged SBET and pore volume values of ZnIn2S4-MOFL could increase the contact surface with water molecules and expose more active sites for enhancing PHE activities [47]. The light absorption capacity of ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalyst was also an important factor to determine the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. It was acknowledged that ZnIn2S4 played as a fundamental substrate for the trigger of PHE reactions. However, the pristine ZnIn2S4 owned weaker light absorption capacity and limited range in contrast with that of MIL-68(In) as shown in Fig. 4(e). Therefore, the synthesis of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composite alleviated the restricted light absorption capacity of ZnIn2S4 and extended the light absorption range. Additionally, the band gaps (Eg ) of MIL-68(In) and ZnIn2S4 were calculated to be 1.52 and 2.47 eV according to the Kubelka-Munk conversion as shown in Fig. 4(f)."
11,XPS and 13C solid-state NMR analysis,"3.3 XPS and 13C solid-state NMR analysis To determine the elemental composition and surface chemical states of various photocatalysts, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments was carried out and results were shown in Fig. 5 . The XPS survey spectra revealed the existence of major In element in MIL-68(In) and Zn, In, S elements in ZnIn2S4 samples. All above elements were observed in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites as shown in Fig. 5(a). The high resolution XPS spectra of In 3d in different samples were analyzed in Fig. 5(b). The binding energy located at 445.0 and 452.6 eV were ascribed to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 in MIL-68(In). For pristine ZnIn2S4, the signal peaks with binding energies of 444.8 and 452.4 eV were assigned to +3 state of In cation. While coupling with In-MOF precursor, a slightly increased binding energy of In 3d at 444.9 and 452.5 eV was found in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites comparing with that of pristine ZnIn2S4. Moreover, the high resolution XPS spectra of S 2p in Fig. 5(c) confirmed the formation of ZnIn2S4, in which the peaks appeared approximately at 161.9 and 162.9 eV could be attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2− anions. It was noted that the binding energies of S 2p had shifted to a higher position toward 162.1 and 163.1 eV in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites, suggesting a closely interfacial connection between MIL-68(In) and ZnIn2S4 [48]. According to Fig. 5(d), the high resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p in ZnIn2S4 could be resolved into two peaks at 1021.5 and 1044.5 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2. However, the opposite binding energy shift of Zn 2p in the two samples was discovered. Specifically, the Zn 2p in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites moved to a lower binding energy at 1021.3 eV, about 0.2 eV differences in comparison with that of pristine ZnIn2S4, further indicating a strong interaction between MIL-68(In) and ZnIn2S4. The phenomenon of opposite binding energy shift would induce charge transfer between the two components of ZnIn2S4 and MOFL, which facilitated charge transfer in photocatalytic reactions [49,50]. In attempt to locate the traces of metal-organic-framework-layers, the solid-state 13C NMR spectra of pristine In-MOF and MOFL were also analyzed as shown in Fig. 5(e). The several peak shifts as marked with numbers corresponded well to the organic ligand in pristine MOF samples [51,52], while the emerged peak at around 163 ppm might be caused by the unremoved DMF in material synthesis. The solely prepared MOFL basically retained the chemical shift signal in comparison with that of In-MOF, further proved the crystal integrity of MOFL in water. The stable organic MOFL could act as inner substrate for the outer growth of inorganic ZnIn2S4, together forming the ZnIn2S4-MOFL photocatalysts as had already been proved according to Fig. 1(i)."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance of MIL-68(In), ZnIn2S4 and different proportions of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites were estimated under light irradiation using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agent. PHE results (Fig. 6 (a-b)) showed that the single component of MIL-68(In) displayed a negligible PHE reaction. Similar results were also observed using pristine ZnIn2S4, which exhibited a rate of 1.90 mmol/g/h toward hydrogen evolution. The inactive PHE reactions of pure photocatalyst were largely caused by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and hole pairs [53]. While a significant enhancement of PHE activity was achieved using ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites and the component ratio of single catalyst had a remarkable impact on its PHE performance. The PHE rates of different In-MOF to ZnIn2S4 composites (1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1) were 5.6, 8.9, 28.2, 17.8, 6.3 mmol/g/h, respectively. The emerging 28.2 mmol/g/h was the highest reported value in recent works as summarized in Table S1 and also advanced than the two-step synthesized T-ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalyst with same component ratio (Fig. S5). Moreover, the bubbling hydrogen phenomenon of ZnIn2S4-MOFL with light on and off was directly recorded with a camera as shown in the Movie (supported information), fully demonstrating a robust PHE performance of synthesized photocatalysts under light irradiation. Besides, the robust PHE rates slightly decreased after suffering successive five cycles without any addition of hole scavengers (Fig. 6(c)), all indicating that the ZnIn2S4-MOFL maintained a good stability for efficient hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) were well in accordance with light absorption capacity as shown in Fig. 6(d) and the AQEs surprisingly reached 22.67 % at 350 nm monochromatic light. After recycling, the retention of hollow tubular structure and unobvious XRD changes further proved the good stability as shown in Fig. 6(e, g). Meanwhile, the photo-deposited Pt nanoparticles could also be found in the marginal part of ZnIn2S4-MOFL (Fig. 6(f)). To reveal the PHE activity over ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites in real sunlight irradiation, the arrangement of photocatalytic device was, therefore, exposed to real environmental conditions (Fig. S6). PHE results showed that a stable increasing of hydrogen was generated with time prolonged, the hydrogen production can be up to 28.56 mmol/g within 5 h (9:00−14:00) under relatively concentrated real sunlight irradiation as shown in Fig. 6(h) and the hydrogen bubbles still could be recorded (Movie, Fig. S7)."
13,Investigation of charge transfer efficiency,"3.5 Investigation of charge transfer efficiency To get more insights into the charge separation efficiency of various photocatalysts, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterizations were carried out and results were accordingly illustrated in Fig. 7 . A dramatically decreased steady-state PL spectra of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites was displayed in Fig. 7(a), indicating the more effective suppression of recombination of photo-generated carriers comparing to ZnIn2S4 [54]. Meanwhile, the time-resolved transient PL spectra of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites, as shown in Fig. 7(b), presented a prolonged average lifetime (11.84 ns) than that of ZnIn2S4 (1.47 ns), providing an evidence for the robust PHE performance [55]. Moreover, the highest transient photocurrent response (Fig. 7(c)) and the smallest high-frequency semicircle Nyquist plot in electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. 7(d)) all suggested the effectively promoted charge separation and transfer efficiency of ZnIn2S4-MOFL [56,57]. All the above summarized PEC results revealed the inhibited recombination and fast transfer of photogenerated carriers in ZnIn2S4-MOFL composite, which were responsible for the robust PHE reactions. Additionally, the EPR signals of electron generation using TEMPO as trapping agent over ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-MOFL under dark and light irradiation were presented in Fig. 7(e-f). It could be found that the TEMPO signal intensity of all samples in dark exhibited the same one, while under simulated light irradiation, the signal over ZnIn2S4-MOFL was much weaker than that of pure ZnIn2S4, illustrating that more TEMPO were reduced to TEMPOH by the photogenerated electrons in ZnIn2S4-MOFL [58]. In other words, the capability for inducing photogenerated electrons on ZnIn2S4-MOFL was significantly increased in comparison with pristine ZnIn2S4, in line with the enhancement of the PHE reactions."
14,Photocatalytic mechanism and DFT calculation,"3.6 Photocatalytic mechanism and DFT calculation Based on the band gap of ZnIn2S4 (2.47 eV) that obtained by Kubelka-Munk conversion, the conduction band (CB) of ZnIn2S4, therefore, was further determined depending on Mott-Schottky plots to clarify the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism. The CB of ZnIn2S4 was predicted to be −0.64 V with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference as shown in Fig. 8 (a). Generally, a 0.24 V difference between SCE and normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) was reported [59], thus it could be deduced that the accurate CB of ZnIn2S4 was about −0.40 V. Besides, the VB of MOFL was calculated at 2.56 V on the basis of ENHE /V = Φ +2.5 eV − 4.44 (ENHE : potential of normal hydrogen electrode and Φ of 4.5 eV: the electron work function of the analyzer) as illustrated in Fig. 8(b). Combining with the obtained band gap (Fig. S8), the schematic band position of MOFL and ZnIn2S4 were consequently marked in Fig. 8(c) to propose a Z-scheme working system. There was no doubt that the type-II transfer model of carriers would not happen probably in this photocatalytic system, as the conduction band of MOFL (0.74 V) failed to satisfy the proton reduction process. The unchanged EPR signals of photo-induced electrons before and after light irradiation over pristine MOFL (Fig. S9) also proved the above conclusion, that was, if electrons flowed from ZnIn2S4 to MOFL and holes transferred from MOFL to ZnIn2S4, then it was impossible for the gathered electrons on MOFL to be used for generating hydrogen at all and there would not have the bubbling photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance over ZnIn2S4-MOFL catalyst. Additionally, Fig. 7(e-f) had already confirmed the signal of photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic reactions. Considering the hollow tubular structure of ZnIn2S4-MOFL composites, the closely interfacial connection between ZnIn2S4 and MOFL would further advance the transfer and recombination of electrons generated on CB of MOFL and hole pairs produced on VB of ZnIn2S4, leaving the photogenerated electrons on CB of ZnIn2S4 to participate in PHE reactions with Pt assisted and holes to be sacrificed on the VB of MOFL as shown in Fig. 8(d). Because of the destruction of the long-range ordered structure in MOFL and the rich metal indium sources from inorganic ZnIn2S4 in the ZnIn2S4-MOFL composite, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation were simplified at this stage and the organic ligand C6H3NH2(COOH)2 was fixed on the surface of ZnIn2S4 to investigate the promoted transfer of photo-induced electrons, and the theoretical calculation results were exhibited in Fig. 8(e-f). In detail, the density of states (DOS) of ZnIn2S4 (001) surface and that with C6H3NH2(COOH)2 were plotted in Fig. 8(e). For the clean ZnIn2S4 (001) surface, the DOS showed that the surface was metallic. For comparison, we also calculated the DOS for bulk ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 8(f)), and found that it was a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.7 eV. This result indicated the existed surface states on the ZnIn2S4 (001), which could act as the recombination center for photoinduced carriers [60,61]. With the anchored adsorption of C6H3NH2(COOH)2, the intensity of DOS around the Fermi level decreased (see the arrow in Fig. 8(e)), which indicated the suppressed recombination of charge carriers and benefited the performance of PHE reactions."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, this work reported hollow tubular ZnIn2S4 modified by embedded metal-organic-framework-layers with In-MOF as precursor through a facile hydrothermal method. The optimally bubbling PHE performance on ZnIn2S4-MOFL reached 28.2 mmol/g/h, almost 14.8 times higher than that of pristine ZnIn2S4 under simulated sunlight irradiation. Moreover, the highest AQEs values of 22.67 % under monochromatic light (350 nm), as well as the efficient hydrogen generation rate (28.56 mmol/g) under real sunlight irradiation for long time all illustrated the robust PHE reactions of ZnIn2S4-MOFL with superior stability. Additionally, the decreased density of states (DOS) of ZnIn2S4 after adsorbing organic ligands of metal-organic-framework-layers, proving by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, significantly suppressed the recombination of charge carriers and was responsible for the extraordinarily high PHE performance."
