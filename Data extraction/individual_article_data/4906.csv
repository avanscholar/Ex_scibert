0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the problem of energy shortage is becoming critical. Photocatalytic water splitting can provide a green way to produce H2 and relieve the energy shortage crisis [1–9]. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) produced using organic linkers (i.e., multidentate ligands) and metal-based nodes, are attracting tremendous interests as promising alternative photocatalysts [10–19]. It has been believed that the photocatalytic activities of MOFs arise from the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) process [20], but our previous study [21] demonstrated that ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) process can provide a new pathway of the electron transfer leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. The structural and functional tunability of MOFs enables preparing MOFs comprising more than one linker. Such MOFs have been reported to display improved photocatalytic activities. The MOF, UiO-66, is based on the organic linker benzene dicarboxylates (bdc). Maligal-Ganesh and co-workers [22] prepared samples of UiO-66 by replacing some bdc either with bdc-NH2 (i.e., bdc with electron-donating substituent NH2) or bdc-X (i.e., bdc with electron-withdrawing group X = F, Cl or Br) and determined an improved photocatalytic activity for alcohol oxidation. Another MOF, Ti-based MIL-125, is also based on bdc. Mellot-Draznieks and co-workers [23] prepared samples of MIL-125 based on both bdc and bdc-NH2 and determined that the highest photocatalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation was obtained with the bdc-NH2 to bdc ratio of 50%. The MOF, UiO-67, is based on the organic linker bpdc (i.e., the dianion of biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid). The organic linker bpydc (i.e., the dianion of 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid) is often used as a ligand to anchor various catalytic active metals/metal complexes in MOFs [24]. In several studies, bpydc was incorporated into UiO-67 to attach complexes of Re, Ru, Rh, Pt or Pd to UiO-67 [25–28]. The resulting UiO-67 materials were found to display efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, water oxidation or other catalytic activities [29,30]. In a similar manner, complexes of Cu, Co or Mn can be incorporated into UiO-67 [31–33]. In general, the transition metal complexes incorporated into MOFs act as active sites for photocatalytic activities via the LMCT process. So far as we know, only a few studies have examined the interaction between different linkers in MOFs and energy transfer between them leading to photocatalytic activities [25,32,34–36]. It is known that Ce can promote energy transfer due to its low-lying empty 4f orbitals and act as active sites for H2 evolution [37–42]. In this work, we introduced Ce4+ into UiO-67 to form UiO-67-Ce by replacing some bpdc of UiO-67 with bpydc-Ce (namely, a complex formed by bpydc coordinated with Ce4+) and demonstrated that the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is greatly enhanced over UiO-67-Ce than UiO-67. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of Ce weakens the LMCT process and opens up a new energy transfer channel from bpdc to bpydc-Ce. Additionally, the introduction of Ce not only promotes the energy transfer but also acts as active sites for H2 evolution."

3,Synthesis of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce,"2.2 Synthesis of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce 2.2.1 UiO-67 ZrCl4 (0.120 g, 0.514 mmol), C6H5COOH (1.256 g, 10.29 mmol, for pore-making) and HCl (0.36 g, 10 mmol, to inhibit the hydrolysis of absolute ZrCl4) were mixed in 20 mL DMF. Then H2bpdc (0.114 g, 0.469 mmol) was added to the above clear solution. After stirring for 10 min at room temperature, the precursor solution was introduced into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, a white solid was obtained. The solid was washed with DMF and suspended in DMF at room temperature for 12 h. Then the solid was recovered by filtration and suspended in methyl alcohol (CH3OH) at room temperature for another 12 h. Finally, the obtained solid was washed with ethanol and dried under reduced pressure for further use. 2.2.2 UiO-67-Ce Ceric ammonium nitrate (0.274 g, 0.5 mmol) and H2bpydc (0.122 g, 0.5 mmol) were mixed in 120 mL CH3OH. After stirring for 2 d at room temperature, the solid of H2bpydc-Ce was obtained. ZrCl4 (0.120 g, 0.514 mmol), C6H5COOH (1.256 g, 10.29 mmol) and HCl (0.36 g, 10 mmol) were mixed in 20 mL DMF. After stirring to the clear solution, H2bpdc (0.113 g, 0.465 mmol) and H2bpydc-Ce (25 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added (Scheme 1 ). Then after stirring for 10 min at room temperature, the precursor solution was introduced into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, a white solid was obtained. The solid was washed with DMF and suspended in DMF at room temperature for 12 h. Then the solid was recovered by filtration and suspended in methyl alcohol at room temperature for another 12 h. The obtained particles were washed with ethanol and dried under reduced pressure for further use."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement of the as-prepared sample was performed on an X-ray powder diffraction (Bruker AXS D8). Elementary composition of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce was performed on Elementar (Vario EL CUBE). A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer was applied to measure the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples at liquid nitrogen temperature. Before the measurement of BET surface area, the as-prepared samples were pretreated at 150 °C under vacuum for 8 h. The morphology of the samples and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was determined by Optima 2100DV: UiO-67-Ce powders before and after hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were acid digested into transparent solution. The concentration of Zr and Ce were determined to be 395.444/227.083 and 12.049/6.865 mg/L, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was characterized on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer and C 1s (284.6 eV) was used to calibrate the peak positions. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker ALPHA-T spectrometer with KBr pellets. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) was performed on a Shimadzu UV 2550 recording spectrophotometer, which was equipped with an integrating sphere and BaSO4 was used as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on an F-4500 FL Spectrophotometer. The size measurement was carried out using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method with a Malvern instrument. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed on a Bruker A300 spectrometer with a microwave power of 8 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and modulation amplitude of up to 5 G, in aqueous CH3OH solutions 77 K. Steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectra were carried out on an Edinburgh FLS980 high sensitivity fluorescence spectrometer. The setup for femtosecond transient absorption (TA) is based on a regenerative amplified Ti: sapphire laser system from HARPIA (800 nm, 1 kHz repetition rate), nonlinear frequency mixing techniques and the transient absorption spectrometer (Keramiku 2B, LT-10233). The 800 nm output pulse from the regenerative amplifier was split into two parts. The transmitted part was used to pump an Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA). The reflected 800 nm beam was split again into two parts. One part was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into a 2 mm thick sapphire window to generate a white light continuum (WLC) from 420 to 800 nm used as the probe beam."
5,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction Photocatalytic HER was carried out in a top-irradiation vessel connected to a glass-enclosed gas circulation system. In a typical procedure, 25 mg of catalyst was suspended in 50 mL aqueous solution (water/CH3OH = 4/1, volume ratio) with constant stirring. The pH value used for photocatalytic HER was ∼4.85. Before photocatalytic reactions, the suspension was exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. The reaction temperature was maintained at 15 °C. Light source, Xe lamp (300 W, 18 A). The amount of H2 evolved was determined by using a gas chromatograph (Shiweipx GC-7806), Ar as carrier gas."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce, presented in Fig. 1 a, are in good agreement with the simulated UiO-67 and those reported previously [28,30,43,44]. UiO-67-Ce displays almost similar peaks to UiO-67, indicating that UiO-67-Ce and UiO-67 have the same framework structure. The three sharp peaks at 5.62° (1 1 1), 6.46° (0 0 2) and 9.18° (0 2 2) for the synthesized samples indicated that they were highly crystalline. Besides, the peaks at 11.33°, 13.06°, 23.59°, 30.26° and 37.06° are the diffraction of (1 1 3), (0 0 4), (1 1 5), (2 2 4) and (1 3 7) crystal planes of UiO-67. The analysis of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. 1b) shows a smaller BET surface area for UiO-67-Ce (1,545 m2/g) than for UiO-67 (1,638 m2/g), which is due to the incorporation of Ce [28]. The SEM images of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce display the same morphology (Fig. 1c, d), namely, cubic particles with the size of ∼100 nm. This demonstrates that the incorporation of Ce causes almost no change in the particle size and morphology of UiO-67. Besides, the atom compositions (in atomic %) of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce were determined by both EDS and elemental analyses. The results are as follows (the numbers in the parentheses are theoretical values). For UiO-67, Zr: 3.36 (3.45), C: 48.24 (48.28), H: 30.08 (29.88), O: 18.32 (18.39). For UiO-67-Ce, Zr: 3.32, C: 48.29, H: 29.89, O: 18.30, N: 0.132, Ce: 0.066. Therefore, the chemical formulas for the UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce samples are Zr6O4(OH)4(bpdc)6 and Zr6O4(OH)4(bpdc)5.88(bpydc-Ce)0.12, respectively. So, the replacement ratio of bpydc is 2%. The presence of Ce in UiO-67-Ce was confirmed by XPS measurement (Fig. 2 ). The Ce 3d peak at 877.8 eV can be assigned to Ce4+ [45–47]. The observed Ce 3d peak was really weak, showing very few loading amounts of Ce ions. The N 1s XPS peaks of UiO-67-Ce at 398.8 and 401.9 eV are assigned to the N–C and N–Ce bonds of bpydc-Ce [48,49], respectively (Fig. S1a, b online). Besides, the Zr 3d peaks are at the same position for both UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce (Fig. S1c online). These results suggest that Ce4+ ions are coordinated to the N of the pyridine ring linker rather than to the carboxylate oxygen or just adsorbed on UiO-67. The EDS analysis suggests that the Zr to Ce atom ratio is 1:0.02 (Fig. S2 online), showing a small amount of bpydc-Ce was incorporated. However, the Ce content in UiO-67-Ce does not increase if further increasing the content of bpydc-Ce during the synthesis process of UiO-67-Ce. The reason is most likely that more bpydc-Ce would destroy the framework structure of UiO-67. The content of Ce and Zr in UiO-67-Ce were also measured by ICP-MS. The Ce/Zr atom ratio was 0.018, which was consistent with the EDS data. The FT-IR spectra of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce are shown in Fig. 3 . Upon introducing bpydc-Ce, the majority of peaks remain the same while minor differences can be observed between the spectra of UiO-67-Ce and UiO-67. One peak of UiO-67 at 1,418 cm−1 (the C–C stretching vibrations of the benzene ring and pyridine ring) moves to 1,413 cm−1 in UiO-67-Ce. The reason is that Ce–N bond formation would weaken the C–C bond in bpydc as a consequence of electron transfer from N to Ce, suggesting the presence of bpydc-Ce in UiO-67-Ce. Furthermore, the single peak of UiO-67 at 1,700 cm−1 splits into two peaks in UiO-67-Ce. This is attributed to the presence of the CN bonds in the pyridine ring in bpydc-Ce [50–52]."
8,Photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic activities over UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce were checked in terms of HER from water (Fig. 4 ). UiO-67-Ce exhibits much higher HER rate than UiO-67 does. The HER rate over UiO-67-Ce is 269.6 μmol/(g h), more than 10 times higher than that over UiO-67 (26.78 μmol/(g h) under the same experiment conditions). Both of them have no photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under visible light (λ > 400 nm). In addition, UiO-67-Ce MOF outperforms the previously reported Zr-based MOF photocatalysts in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction [51,53,54]. All of the above confirms that the introduction of bpydc-Ce into UiO-67 can greatly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. The Ce/Zr atom ratio was also determined after the photocatalytic reaction by ICP-MS, and the value is 0.019, which is consistent with the value before the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, no Ce ions can be detected in the supernatant after photocatalytic reaction. This result suggests that UiO-67-Ce is stable during the photocatalytic process. Furthermore, the H2 evolution rate over UiO-67-Ce under UV/Vis irradiation decreased after 6 h. This suggests a decrease in the relative stability (Fig. S3a online). And the incorporation of Ce4+ does not affect the stability of UiO-67 (Fig. S3b online). The structure and physical properties of the UiO-67-Ce particles were checked after 12 h of photocatalytic H2 evolution to uncover the reason for the activity decrease. As shown in Fig. S4a (online), the intensity of the XRD peaks decrease suggesting the decrease of crystallinity, which is the most likely induced by the collapse of the framework structure during the longtime photocatalytic reaction. The SEM images (Fig. S4b, c online) suggest that the morphologies of UiO-67-Ce change after photocatalytic reaction, namely, the cubic particles with a size of ∼100 nm become irregular larger particles with a size range of 100–600 nm. These results show that the framework structure of UiO-67-Ce was collapsed and destroyed during the photocatalytic process, which is the main reason for the observation that the H2 evolution decreases after 6 h. We speculate that the framework structure of UiO-67-Ce was collapsed and destroyed due to the attack of the strong HO− nucleophile in water and the continuous mechanical stirring during the longtime photocatalytic reaction [11]. The photocatalytic activities over bpydc and bpydc-Ce were checked to verify the effect of Ce on the HER (Fig. S5 online). The analysis demonstrated that bpydc leads to no H2 production, but bpydc-Ce to an increasing amount of H2 production over time. It suggests that Ce4+ acts as the active site for the hydrogen evolution [41,42]. Nevertheless, the HER rate over bpydc-Ce is 2.95 μmol/(g h) far less than that over UiO-67-Ce. This demonstrates the superiority of MOFs in photocatalytic activity, which prevents the chromophores from aggregation and consequently suppresses the self-quenching and deleterious attenuation of exciton lifetimes [55]. In addition, the photocatalytic activity for the sample without Ce, UiO-67-Y (the same ligand ratio of bpdc to bpydc as UiO-67-Ce but without Ce), was also investigated. As presented in Fig. S6 (online), UiO-67-Y shows a slight increase in the activity compared with UiO-67, but still much worse than that of UiO-67-Ce. This result indicates that the Ce incorporation plays a more important role in improving the photocatalytic activity than the bpydc ligand. Besides that, the photocatalytic activity of UiO-67 was also investigated with the presence of equal amount of Ce to UiO-67-Ce, (1) directly mixing UiO-67 and ceric ammonium nitrate in methanol for 24 h at R.T. and (2) heating the UiO-67 and ceric ammonium nitrate mixture at 120 °C for 24 h in DMF before isolation. For either case, the sample displays lower activity than UiO-67, implying the essential role of bpydc in helping Ce ions incorporated into UiO-67 for improving the photocatalytic activity (Fig. S7 online). The SEM and DLS results show that the as-prepared UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce samples display almost the same size (100 nm) and aggregation (450 nm) in aqueous solutions (Fig. S8 and Table S1 online). Thus, the impact of the aggregation on the catalytic activity can be excluded."
9,Exploration of possible mechanism,"3.3 Exploration of possible mechanism We further explored the effect of bpydc-Ce on the photophysical properties. Fig. 5 a compares the UV/Vis light absorption of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce. UiO-67-Ce displays a slight blue shift in the absorption edge (365 nm) and a greatly increased absorption intensity in the UV region, compared with UiO-67, due to the coordination of bpydc-Ce with Zr. Band gaps of UiO-67 before and after Ce loading are 3.02 and 3.39 eV. The DRS spectra in Fig. S9a (online) suggests that the ligand bpydc-Ce displays a much stronger intensity in the UV region than bpdc does, which is due to the larger absorption coefficient of bipyridine [56]. But if Ce as metal nodes of MOFs connected with the carboxylate oxygen in bpydc, such as MOF Ce-UiO-66-bpydc (a MOF constructed with Ce metal nodes and bpydc organic ligands) [57], the absorption edge will have a large red shift than bpydc (Fig. S10 online). This can also be the evidence that Ce coordinates to the N atoms in bpydc linkers rather than replace the positions of zirconium atoms connected with carboxylate in UiO-67. The excited state properties of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce were also investigated by PL spectra (Fig. 5b). Two emission peaks at 398 and 467 nm are observed for UiO-67-Ce, which are similar to that of bpydc-Ce (Fig. S9b online), implying that the emission of bpydc-Ce dominates over the radiative decay, although the concentration of bpydc-Ce is very low and the emission of bpdc observed in UiO-67 is almost quenched for UiO-67-Ce. In addition, UiO-67-Ce displays a much weaker peak than does UiO-67, suggesting that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs separate more efficiently in UiO-67-Ce than that in UiO-67, which agrees well with the observation that the H2 evolution rate is much higher over UiO-67-Ce than that over UiO-67. To further verify the electron transfer channel in UiO-67-Ce, the EPR spectra were carried out (Fig. 6 a). An EPR signal is detected for both UiO-67-Ce and UiO-67 with the g-value of about 2.002, which is attributed to the formation of Zr3+ due to the reported LMCT process [54]. However, the Zr3+ signal is much weaker in UiO-67-Ce than UiO-67 under the same experiment conditions. Besides, no Zr3+ EPR signal was detected in the dark over UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce (Fig. S11 online). This phenomenon suggests that the LMCT process happened with the presence of UV/Vis illumination is weakened in UiO-67-Ce due to the presence of bpydc-Ce. We assume that the presence of bpydc-Ce in UiO-67-Ce opens up a new energy transfer channel, i.e., from excited bpdc to bpydc-Ce, which is a competing process to the LMCT. Considering the fact that the emission spectrum of bpdc displays a good overlap with the absorption spectrum of bpydc-Ce (Fig. S12 online) and the distance between bpdc and bpydc is less than ∼ 7.88 Å, it is most likely that the Förster energy transfer occurs from the excited bpdc to bpydc-Ce [29,36,50,58,59]. To prove this possibility, we prepared mixtures of UiO-67 with bpdc, bpydc or bpydc-Ce, and studied their emission (excited at 300 nm) for fluorescence quenching effect. The concentration of bpdc, bpydc and bpydc-Ce are the same, that is, 0.2 mmol/L. Fig. 6b shows that the emission intensity of UiO-67 + bpdc is a slightly higher than UiO-67, while that of UiO-67 is greatly suppressed with the presence of bpydc and even more for bpydc-Ce. The PL and EPR results indicate that energy transfer occurs between bpdc and bpydc-Ce in UiO-67-Ce. The energy transfer process occurred in UiO-67-Ce MOF is confirmed by time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 7 ). The decay of the excited state of UiO-67-Ce is much faster than that of UiO-67, while the average lifetime is 6.56 and 2.92 ns for UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce, respectively. The reduction of the fluorescence lifetime of UiO-67 in the presence of bpydc-Ce means the occurrence of energy transfer from bpdc to bpydc-Ce, in addition to the fluorescence back to the ground state of bpdc. This result indicates an evident energy transfer between bpdc and bpydc-Ce. The TA spectra of UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce MOFs at different delay times after 300 nm excitation are compared in Fig. 8 . The TA spectra of UiO-67 exhibits negative ground state bleach (GSB) signal at ∼425 nm, which overlaps with a broad positive excited state absorption (ESA) signal from 505 to 750 nm. In contrast, the initiative ESA amplitude is blue-shifted in UiO-67-Ce, leaving a somewhat long-lived GSB signal compared to that of UiO-67. The GSB of UiO-67-Ce is blue-shifted (by ∼56 nm) compared to that of UiO-67 (at ∼369 nm), which is consistent with the result of DRS. There is a small sharp peak at 579 nm in both UiO-67 and UiO-67-Ce, which is assigned to the intrinsic ESA of Zr-moiety in MOFs. For UiO-67, after a sufficiently long delay time, the transient signal at 579 nm becomes strongly negative, indicating the occurrence of the electron transfer from ligands bpdc to the Zr metal nodes of UiO-67 during the TA spectra study. However, the corresponding peak in UiO-67-Ce becomes weak and remains positive after a sufficiently long delay time, which is consistent with the result of EPR, and the ESA decay and GSB recovery occur simultaneously [60–63]. This spectroscopic feature further confirms the existence of the energy transfer between bpdc and bpydc-Ce, inhibiting the electron transfer from bpdc to Zr in UiO-67-Ce. Based on the above discussions, a photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution of UiO-67-Ce can be proposed as illustrated in Scheme 2 . For UiO-67, the UV/Vis illumination induces the electron transfer from the excited bpdc to the zirconium-oxo cluster (LMCT process), resulting in the formation of Zr3+. For UiO-67-Ce, the introduction of bpydc-Ce weakens the LMCT process and promotes the energy transfer from excited bpdc to bpydc-Ce."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, Ce4+ was incorporated into UiO-67 containing bpydc as a mixed linker, based on the previous research [24,28,31–33]. The obtained UiO-67-Ce displays a much higher photocatalytic HER efficiency than UiO-67. The time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectra, transient absorption spectra and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra suggest that the presence of bpydc-Ce provides an alternative energy transfer channel [42,58,59] between bpdc and bpydc-Ce. This new energy transfer channel not only suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes but also weakens the well-accepted LMCT process in UiO-67 [20,54], both of which are responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity of UiO-67-Ce. This work provides an alternative approach to improve the photocatalytic activities of MOFs, in addition to a deep understanding of the interaction between different linkers in MOFs comprising more than one linker."
