0,Introduction,"The push towards sustainable chemistry grows day-by-day. One such strategy is through the transformation of bio-renewable feedstocks, especially with regards to the production of value-added chemicals derived from lignocellulosic biomass wastes. Pyrolysis of the hemicellulose component from such biomass generates various oxygenates—one such molecule is furfural [1,2]. More specifically, furfural is the product of direct dehydration of C5 sugars [3–6] and is used effectively as an extractant to remove aromatic components from lubricants and diesel fuel [7]. It also has a role in the polymer industry as it can readily undergo acetalization and participate in various condensation reactions [7,8]. Moreover, it is also used as an agricultural fungicide [6,7]. Currently, the majority of furfural produced worldwide (∼60 %) is hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol (Scheme 1 ) [4,6], a key intermediate for the manufacture of many fine chemicals and essential industrial compounds, such as adhesives, lubricants, and corrosion resistant coatings [4,5,6,9–11]. The present industrial scale hydrogenation is a relatively small scale and hazardous process, using a copper chromite catalyst. Although providing a moderate activity and relatively high selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol, it requires harsh reaction conditions to be effective (∼200 °C and ∼30 bar) [4,12]. Over time the catalyst degrades and Cr(VI) is formed, causing both a hazard to workers and environmental danger, since the disposal of this substance is problematic and landfill is prohibited [13,14]. An array of alternative metal catalysts have been used in the literature for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in both the liquid and vapour phase, examples being: Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, Ir and Ru [10,15–22]. Pt has been shown previously to be highly active and selective at low reaction temperatures under a headspace hydrogen atmosphere in the liquid phase [16]. Additionally, Pt is also effective for the hydrogenation of furfural in the vapour phase and also under Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions on Pt(111) [23,24]. More recently, we have studied the formation of copper-based catalysts ranging from nanoparticles to small clusters and isolated Cu species supported on nanophased alumina in the catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. These catalysts were synthesized via a wet impregnation method using various copper precursors at two different loadings [8]. A high Cu loading led to the formation of well-defined nanoparticles, while a lower loading formed a highly dispersed phase consisting mostly of atomic and dimeric Cu species on Al2O3. The catalytic reaction was found to be structure sensitive, promoting decarbonylation reactions with a low Cu loading [8]. Previously, bimetallic catalysts (two different metals, which can either be miscible or immiscible, represented as a bulk alloy) [25] have been exploited for the hydrogenation of furfural. Some of these binary alloy systems consist of PtSn, PtGe, RhSn, NiSn, CuCo, PdCu, PdAg and PdRh [11,21,26–29]. However, the majority of alloy research does not consider the reduction of precious metal content, purely an alloy effect promoted by relatively high loadings of both metals, creating a difference in reaction selectivity [27,28,30–32]. It has been shown over recent years, that by depositing isolated catalytic entities on the surface of a metal nanoparticle, the properties of the parent particle can be enhanced dramatically via hydrogen spillover [33]. Isolated atomic entities on a host nanoparticle may provide reaction rate improvements as well as changes to product selectivities. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of precious metal dilution, in this case Pt, with a metal that is both cheap and not catalytically effective by itself at modest loadings. Cu as a catalyst for the reaction has only been found to be highly effective in the form of copper chromite, which (as outlined above) there is an urgent need to replace. However, in this form Cu has shown excellent selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol but also deactivation over time especially when used in the Cu/Cr2O3 form on an industrial scale [34]. Precious metals have been investigated in the literature, but not found practical application [23,35]. The motivation for this study is to combine the Cu and Pt synergistically, providing high activities and selectivities toward useful products such as furfuryl alcohol from the furfural hydrogenation reaction, but without the expense of a high loaded precious metal catalyst. Previously PdCu nanoparticles have been shown to increase furfural conversion and selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol compared to monometallic Pd which is known for being unselective [15]. Across a number of studies, the reaction parameters used accommodate both high temperatures (80−160 °C) and high metal loadings, with only minor Pd dilutions taking place (5 wt%→ 3 wt%). It was found that by alloying Cu with Pd, a significant decrease in tetrahydrofuran production took place [30,36,37]. PtNi is another alloy system that has been explored recently that has shown that Ni shifts the selectivity towards C=C hydrogenation, favouring tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [38]. This is due to an alteration in the furfural adsorption profile, Wu and co-workers show that furfural adsorbs to the surface via a planer motif on Ni sites [38]. In the present paper the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural is studied using bimetallic PtCu nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3 at varying Pt:Cu molar ratios to demonstrate the effect of precious metal dilution and the promotional effect induced by Pt on a relatively inactive metal component, Cu. Our previous work found that there was a mild particle-support interaction when depositing Pt on γ-Al2O3 which lead to a tight particle size distribution [15]. It has been shown previously that Pt nanoparticles of ∼4 nm are optimal for the production of furfuryl alcohol [39]. Additionally, γ-Al2O3 is known to be mildly acidic, Lewis acidity gas been found to be beneficial for hydrogenation reactions [40]. This work will probe the synergistic effects of Pt and Cu in an alloyed state, scrutinizing a potentially more active/selective catalytic species PtxCu1-x, through hydrogen spillover caused by the hydrogen activating metal, Pt [41,42]. Additionally, to investigate the effect of Cu on the selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction. Finally, low dilution of Pt in Cu (as much as 1:20 atomic fraction, where galvanostatic replacement targets obtaining surface Pt atoms) is investigated, limiting wasted precious metal in the form of buried platinum atoms."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis 2.1.1 Monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles Colloidal Pt, Cu and PtCu nanoparticles were synthesized using a similar method to that we have employed previously [16]. To ensure bimetallic particles, subtle modifications were made to allow for a slow addition of the metal precursor solution. Varying molar ratios of H2PtCl6.3H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9 %) and Cu(NO3)2 (Acros, 99 %) were added to a 9:2 ratio of ethylene glycol and water in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (40,000 MW, Alfa Aesar) and briefly sonicated until fully dissolved. This was followed by dropwise addition into a warm ethylene glycol solution (140 °C) containing NaOH (1 mL, 1 M) via syringe pump (World Precision Instruments, AL-4000 Programmable Syringe Pump) at 5 mL h−1. Slowly, the colour of the solution turned from light brown to black for Pt and PtCu solutions, whereas the Cu solution changed from a light blue to brown. After full addition of the metal solution, the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 20 min and then cooled to room temperature. Nanoparticles were isolated by the addition of acetone (three times the reaction volume) followed by subsequent centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, three times. The nanoparticles were then suspended in ethanol and supported on γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar 99.5 %, 32–40 m2 g−1). The support was not pretreated prior to nanoparticle deposition. Catalysts were dried under vacuo and then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The monometallic and bimetallic powders of nominal Pt:Cu molar ratios 50:50 and 25:75 were transferred to a muffle furnace and heated at 3 °C min−1 in static air to 300 °C for 4 h to remove excess synthetic agents. Table 1 shows that although these intended nominal molar ratios were not achieved, the as synthesized 38:62 and 18:82 M ratio catalysts cover a reasonably broad compositional range for catalyst testing. 2.1.2 Ultra dilute alloy An atom efficient catalyst was synthesized by adopting a galvanic replacement method previously reported by Lucci et al. [43]. Initially, a monometallic 1% Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was generated by the same process described above, but following calcination in air, the powder was reduced under H2 flow at 300 °C for 3 h. The resulting material, ∼1 g, was immediately added to 50 mL of HCl (2 mM) while under nitrogen protection. Galvanic replacement, the process where surface host atoms are replaced with a different metal, in this case Pt, was completed under constant stirring and refluxing at 100 °C where a low concentration of H2PtCl6.3H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9 %) in H2O was added to the mixture. After 20 min, the resulting material was separated via centrifuged (4000 rpm, 10 min), washed multiple times with deionized water (∼300 mL) and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts All samples were analysed using a Cs aberration-corrected JEOL 2100-F microscope at 200 kV, a HAADF detector and Gatan Ultrascan 4000 bright field camera operated by Digital Micrograph software. Further image analysis was carried out using ImageJ 1.52a software. Samples were dispersed in methanol and deposited on 300-mesh carbon-supported nickel grids and dried under ambient conditions. Metal contents were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7400 Duo, after microwave digestion of the samples in 5 mL HNO3 (Fisher, 70 %) and 100 mg NH4F (Sigma Aldrich, ≥98.0 %) at 190 °C (CEM–MARS microwave reactor) followed by dilution in 10 % aqueous HNO3. BET surface areas were determined via N2 physisorption using a Quantachrome Nova 1200. Samples were degassed at 120 °C for 1 h prior to analysis by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectra were acquired on a Kratos AXIS HSi spectrometer equipped with a charge neutralizer and dual anode, where an Al Kα excitation source (1486.7 eV), with energies referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV, samples were mounted onto carbon tape. Spectral fitting was performed using CasaXPS version 2.3.15 using a Shirley background where surface atomic compositions were calculated via correction for the appropriate instrument response factors. Powder X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer Cu Kα1,2 radiation (40 mA and 40 kV, 0.02 mm Ni Kβ filter and 2.5 ° Soller slits). Diffractograms were collected in the Bragg-Brentano geometry with a step scan of 0.02° (1 s per step) and the samples were top-loaded into PMMA specimen holders. Subsequent peak assignment was based on the ICDD’s PDF-2 2012 & ICSD databases. PXRD derived particle sizes were estimated using the Scherrer equation based on the FWHM of the (111) metallic reflection using a Gaussian fit and shape factor of 0.9. Pt dispersions were measured via CO pulse chemisorption on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 system. Samples were reduced at 300 °C under flowing hydrogen (20 mL min−1) for 1 h before room temperature analysis; this reduction protocol is identical to that employed for in situ pre-treatment prior to catalyst testing. A CO:Pt surface stoichiometry of 0.68 was assumed, since the formation of a fully saturated monolayer is energetically unfavorable as CO binds in an atop morphology, under the measurement conditions employed [44]. It is assumed CO binds only to the Pt under the conditions employed. Equations S1 and S2 in the supplementary information were used to estimate both the particle size (in the case of pure Pt) and surface Pt dispersion (for all samples containing sufficient platinum to measure)."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing In situ reduction and catalysis was carried out in a HEL multi-reactor high pressure platform (3 × 50 mL autoclaves). The catalyst of mass ∼30 mg was heated under flowing H2 to 300 °C at 5 °C min−1 and held for 0.5 h. This temperature was used as it is known that CuO will reduce in the temperature range 200–300 °C [45–47]. Upon cooling under flowing H2, the autoclaves were purged and sealed with He to limit catalyst oxidation. While He was flowing, the reaction mixture consisting of methanol, (10 mL, Fisher Scientific, 99.99 %) furfural (16.5 μL, 0.02 M, Sigma Aldrich) and internal standard, decane (38 μL, 0.02 M, Sigma Aldrich) was injected into each reactor. The mixture was allowed to degas for a period of 10 min before pressurizing under H2 (1.5, 10 and 20 bar, BOC, 99.995 %) and heating to 50 °C (stirring at 600 rpm). The reaction was continued for 7 h and sampled periodically by slowly depressurizing to atmospheric pressure and then re-pressurizing with H2. Initial rate measurements were taken in quick succession from as low as 10 min after the start of the reactions until the first hour and subsequent samples were removed until the 7 h time point. Reaction samples were analysed offline on a Bruker Scion 456-GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and fitted with a Zebron ZB-5 (5%-phenyl-95 %-dimethylpolysiloxane) capillary column. All peaks observed were validated by reference standards generated for the GC calibration."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 shows a summary of the characterization results for all the catalysts used in this work, including metal loading as determined by ICP-OES, overall BET surface area, particle sizing by PXRD, TEM and CO chemisorption, surface metal ratios from XPS and finally Pt dispersion. Particle sizes obtained by TEM and PXRD for the Cu100 catalysts are in good agreement to each other. For the Pt100 although PXRD could not be used, particle size can additionally be estimated from CO chemisorption and this was in reasonable agreement with the TEM derived size. The equations used to calculate dispersion and particle size from CO titrations are shown in the supplementary information (Equation S1 and S2). Representative TEM images for the bimetallic and UDA catalysts with accompanying particle size histograms are shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S2). ICP-OES of the bimetallic catalysts found that there were decreases in Pt content, as expected, compared to the Pt100 catalyst. BET surface area measurements show that all the catalysts are broadly similar (Table 1). Surface metal compositions as determined by XPS were in agreement with bulk molar ratios determined by ICP-OES of Pt and Cu for the Pt18Cu82 and Pt38Cu62 samples, confirming the surface layers of the as reduced catalysts have the same composition as the bulk average. In contrast, the Pt1Cu20 sample shows enrichment at the surface with a Pt:Cu ratio of relative 1:6 compared to 1:20 in the bulk. This is consistent with the preparation method using galvanostatic replacement of surface atoms. CO-titration derived Pt dispersion shows that as the Pt content is decreased, the overall dispersion and effectively the amount of surface Pt appears to increase slightly from 13.4 % (Pt100), to 20.1 % (Pt38Cu62) and 29.4 % (Pt18Cu82). However, it must be born in mind the surface stoichiometry of CO:Pt may increase beyond 2/3 (assumed in the dispersion calculation) for Pt atoms sited in a copper surface, so given the XPS shows no substantive change in surface composition from the bulk, this finding should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the absence of a dramatic change in the Pt dispersion measurements for the alloys does show there is no substantial core-shell type effect and the Pt distribution appears roughly homogeneous – a conclusion further supported by the PXRD data presented later on. Both PXRD derived sizes and TEM data broadly agree and show the Pt38Cu62 and Pt18Cu82 alloys were similar in size to each other and the pure Cu particles. Fig. 1 shows PXRD diffractograms of the materials after calcination (Fig. 1a) and after reduction (Fig. 1b). Unassigned reflections correspond to trace amounts of δ-Al2O3 impurities in the Al2O3 support. It should be noted that both the Pt (111) and (200) reflections, expected at 39.8° and 47.4° 2-theta respectively, are unfortunately obscured by the Al2O3 support. However, for pure copper the (111) reflection is expected at 43.3°, and thus readily visible. After calcination, the only reflections seen are those due to the Al2O3 support. This is likely due to the copper component being oxidized and either amorphous or again obscured by the Al2O3 support. There has been no discernible modification to the γ-Al2O3 (for example, spinel formation) upon heating of the samples. Note, there is no Pt1Cu20 calcined sample due to Pt being introduced after the Cu/Al2O3 was reduced. After reduction, a clear additional reflection is seen in each of the patterns from all the Cu containing samples, shifting to lower 2-theta values with increasing Pt content. Fig. 1c shows the variation in the position of this reflection as a function of Pt fraction, as compared to the positions expected in a uniform bulk alloy based on Vegard’s law. The Cu100, Pt1Cu20 (which is almost pure copper) and Pt18Cu82 lie on precisely the expected line for bulk alloys, with the Pt38Cu62 sample suggesting the diffracting component has a slightly lower than expected Pt content (likely indicative of some slight Pt segregation – either in separate particles of via intraparticle separation such as core-shell formation). However, overall the PXRD data clearly point to the formation of well-mixed alloys in these samples. Representative TEM images of the reduced monometallic Pt100/γ-Al2O3 and Cu100/γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2 a and b respectively. It is worth noting that due to the different Z-contrast between the heavier Pt and the lighter Cu, the nanoparticles in the two cases appear differently under the electron beam. Pt with an atomic number of 78 appears with far greater contrast compared to Cu, which has an atomic number of 29 [48]. Consequently, these small copper particles can only be seen successfully at higher resolution as individual particles in bright field mode. Size distribution histograms, presented as insets in Fig. 2a and b, show an average particle size and distribution of 4.4 ± 0.8 nm for the monometallic Pt catalyst and 6.4 ± 1.6 nm for the monometallic Cu catalyst. The narrow distribution observed in the case of Pt indicates that the nanoparticles are relatively homogenous in size and that they are thermally stable during calcination and reduction. In the case of Cu (Fig. 2b) the nanoparticles are marginally larger and have a slightly broader distribution. TEM supported by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out on the bimetallic alloy particles. Fig. S1 shows a typical image of a singular Pt38Cu62 particle where there is a random dispersion of Cu (yellow) and Pt (blue), no areas of high concentration of a specific metal are evident. The atomic ratio of Cu and Pt for this particle was found to be 48:52. Other regions scanned showed similar atomic ratios, which were also accompanied by some particles with a slightly greater Cu content than Pt (consistent with the bulk ratio determined by ICP-OES). The maximum Cu content for a single bimetallic particle seen was ∼70 %. There were no particles observed to be rich in Pt, indicating the segregation noted above is probably due to intraparticle segregation, although more detailed investigation is outside the scope of the present work. The key point is that the microscopy is consistent with other techniques in demonstrating unambigously the reduced samples used for catalysis contain intimately mixed alloys with a local composition similar to that obtained by bulk elemental analysis of the sample. For the Pt1Cu20 UDA sample, STEM HAADF images in Fig. 3 (Bright (a,c) and Dark field (b,d)) were obtained. Due to the much higher atomic number of Pt, it is expected to show as a much brighter contribution than Cu in the (HAADF) dark-field images (b and d) (expected Rutherford scattering ratio ∼7:1). The first observation is there is a not a distinctly brighter region of the particle, implying the Pt is not significantly segregated into a cluster, but likely well-dispersed. It is an instructive thought experiment to consider the numbers of Pt vs Cu atoms being viewed. For instance, for the particle shown in Fig. 3d on the small tail of the size distribution (for ease of imaging, about 3 nm). Assuming a spherical particle this can be expected to have of order 1200 atoms in total, with less than 60 Pt atoms. Assuming a surface thickness similar to a close-packed crystalline layer, around 460 of the atoms are at the surface. Even if all the Pt is at the surface, 88 % of the surface atoms are Cu. The particle being viewed is probably around 10–20 atoms deep at the center (depending on assumptions made about shape and orientation). The key point is the concentration of Pt in this sample is so low, even if Pt may be at the surface it isn’t a thin layer, and when viewed in transmission so few Pt atoms are present that a “bright-halo” around the edge of the particle is not expected, as seen for example in the surface segregation of Pt in PtCo nanoparticles [49]. The primary point is that in the case of Pt1Cu20 catalyst significant Pt clustering or segregation could not be observed although the presence of small clusters cannot be excluded. XP spectra of the reduced samples are shown in Fig. 4 . The Cu100 and Pt100 catalysts align well with reported reference data for Cu and Pt metallic foils. The addition of Pt to Cu in all cases (Pt38Cu62, Pt18Cu82 and Pt1Cu20) results in a shift of the Cu 2p to slightly lower binding energy and the Pt 4d to slightly higher binding energy, indicative of electron transfer from Pt to Cu. While this is the reverse of what would be expected in the bulk from their Pauling electronegativities of 2.28 and 1.90 for Pt and Cu, respectively, XPS is dominated by the surface and electronegativities are known to differ within a few layers of the surface as a result of both different orbital involvement at an interface and differing surface atom densities due to lattice mismatching between two metals, as seen for overlayers of one metal on another [50]. This has specifically been seen for the case of a Cu adlayer on Pt(111), where the Cu core-level binding energy decreased by 0.27 eV [51]. The negative shifts seen in the Cu 2p level indicate a Pt-induced increase in the Cu electron population. For example, the atomic Cu 3d94s2 to Cu 3d104s1 rehybridization is expected to give negative shifts in the binding energy for both core and d-valence levels while the Pt 5d96s1 to Pt 5d86s2 rehybridization will result in positive shifts. Thus, the primary charge transfer mechanism involves the Cu s,p electron donation, Pt d back donation [52–54]. Similar shifts are seen for other PtCu bimetallic samples [55–58]. It should be noted the signal for Pt 4d is weaker than Pt 4f that would typically be used for such characterization, but the latter could not be separated from the alumina support contribution in that region. The XP spectra also point to the absence of CuO in all the samples studied, which would be expected to be accompanied by satellites in the Cu 2p spectra between the Cu 2p spin-orbit pair and a higher Cu 2p binding energy. In all cases attempts to fit the spectra did not justify more than one component being present, as might reasonably be expected for reduced samples."
7,Catalyst reactivity,"3.2 Catalyst reactivity The supported monometallic reference catalysts Cu100 and Pt100, along with the three bimetallic compositions, Pt38Cu62, Pt18Cu82 and Pt1Cu20 were tested under batch conditions at three hydrogen pressures (1.5, 10 and 20 bar), using temperature and solvent reaction environments optimized previously [16]. Fig. 5 shows the reaction profiles as a function of time for the three pressures, as well as the platinum mass normalized initial rates for all samples. By normalizing for Pt mass, the effect of Pt dilution on the catalytic activity of PtCu alloys can be observed, especially for the case of Pt1Cu20 where the effect of atomic Pt on a host Cu nanoparticle is scrutinised. Clearly, Pt (black) outperforms Cu (green) by about 1 order of magnitude at all pressures, as expected. This is highlighted in more detail in Fig. S3. The overall furfural conversions taken at 7 h and reaction selectivities are presented in Fig. 6 . Additionally, post reaction catalysts were reclaimed and digested to assess stability to leaching/loss of metal via ICP-OES, this found that there were no substantial losses, as shown in Table S1. For Pt100, the reaction is near fully selective to furfural hydrogenation, with limited (<1%) presence of furan in the products. Furan is thought to be formed via a decarbonylation pathway and may be indicative of Pt deactivation via CO blocking active sites, especially for Pt(111) [16,59,60]. Additionally, due to the use of previously optimized solvent and temperature conditions, no solvent coupled products were detected, a common issue with liquid phase furfural transformations [16,27]. However, as the pressure used increases to 20 bar and almost complete conversion is reached, there is a very low concentration (∼0.2 % selectivity) of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) produced due to C=C hydrogenation (Scheme 1). This is a very modest amount of THFA compared to reactions in the literature using Pd [30]. In contrast the Cu100 catalyst formed furan as the major product when operating at 1.5 bar and in discernible quantities at higher pressures. There are selectivity differences to our previous work due to the different preparation methods for Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, although interestingly a very similar overall activity is observed at 1.5 bar H2 [8]. For the alloy samples Pt38Cu62 and Pt18Cu82, the high conversion of Pt100 is mostly preserved, dropping only slightly at the lowest pressure, although on dilution to 18 % Pt, the selectivity at lower pressures starts to decrease with the production of furan (similar to pure copper). It is likely that hydrogenation over these samples proceeds via a spillover pathway, whereby the hydrogen dissociates at Pt sites and spills over onto nearby copper sites, where furfural can be absorbed and hydrogenated without the need for Pt [42,61]. A drop in furfural conversion is shown for the alloy catalysts at 20 bar which is attributed to a surface saturation of H2. As previously shown in our work on a model Pt(111) surface, furfural adsorption can be restricted by H2 crowding decreasing catalyst turnover [23]. Note, the alloys Pt38Cu62 and Pt18Cu82 produced a slightly larger THFA selectivity than Pt on its own, 0.9 % and 0.8 %, respectively when operating at 20 bar. This increase in selectivity is a far milder effect than previously shown for PtNi alloys which has been found to drive to reaction towards THFA formation [38]. For the UDA catalyst Pt1Cu20, at 10 and 20 bar the high conversion is maintained, but it exhibits only very low activity at 1.5 bar. From the reaction profiles in Fig. 5b and 5c, the Pt1Cu20 sample exhibits a clear induction period (∼0.7 h at 20 bar, 2 h at 10 bar) under conditions where it is active. After this induction period, it exhibits a rate per platinum atom higher than any other catalyst including Pt100 (Fig. 5d), and remains strikingly selective to the desired furfuryl alcohol product. Speculatively, the induction could result from a number of possibilities. The first is the reduction of a small quantity of surface copper oxide, however, given the in situ reduction employed before reaction and the lack of evidence for copper oxides this can be reasonably discounted. A second alternative is hydrogen-induced migration of Pt to the surface. This process, where individual Pt atoms that possess a higher surface energy than the Cu host migrate up through the bulk to the surface in the presence of H2 has been reported previously [62]. Theoretical work supports Pt being more stable in the bulk than on the surface in the absence of any external stimuli (e.g. hydrogen pressure), showing that the surface energy per atom in a (111) array is ∼0.70 eV for Cu vs ∼1.0 eV for Pt (which remains higher even accounting for the slightly larger size of the Pt) [63,64]. However, the presence of a significant Pt enrichment at the surface by XPS in the ‘as reduced’ sample (also consistent with the fact the sample was prepared by ‘surface displacement’) suggests surface migration alone is also unlikely to account for the induction. A third possibility is the formation of appropriate ensembles on the surface may be necessary – the cluster size needed for hydrogen activation has been investigated by Gates and co-workers [65] as well as Cao et al. [66] for bimetallics, including PtCu, and those in a small size (∼1.5 nm) by Chandler and co-workers [67]. They proposed the need for a minimum surface Pt ensemble to activate hydrogen in the PtCu catalyzed toluene reduction. In the present work the substantial dilution of Pt affords the same low probability of surface platinum ensembles occurring at random – but such clustering could be induced by hydrogen. Further work is needed to investigate such effects, but the presence of this induction process is an interesting aside. A second important observation is the absolute rates of conversion (not just the Pt normalized rate), appear higher with Pt1Cu20 than for the pure Pt catalyst (note the steep rise after induction, Fig. 5b and c). It is possible that the presence of Pt even at this dilution—which for a 6 nm particle corresponds to at most ∼20 % of the surface atoms—still alters the adsorption strength or geometry. The adsorption energies of furfural on Cu(111) and Pt(111) are predicted to be quite different, 0.47 eV and 1.07 eV, respectively [68], and differences in furfural’s adsorption geometry are known to effect reactivity [23,35,69]. For Cu this involves the interaction of the lone pair on the furfural molecule with the Cu(111) surface, resulting in a perpendicular η1(O)-aldehyde conformation, opposed to the parallel η2(C, O)-aldehyde conformation for Pt. This conformation is preferred due to the repulsion of the aromatic furan ring from the closely-packed Cu(111) surface which was assumed by Sitthisa et al. to arise from the overlap of the antibonding orbitals of the furan ring and the 3d band of the Cu surface atoms [70]. While Cu surfaces can facilely adsorb furfural, reaction progression can be hampered by a large activation barrier for hydrogen dissociative adsorption [33]. In contrast, the presence of Pt in the UDA catalyst can facilitate hydrogen dissociative adsorption and spillover onto the Cu as it has been seen for similar systems [33,71–74]. Through this work a route to bridge model catalytic systems and real world catalysts can be found for an ultra-dilute Pt species. The adsorbed hydrogen preferentially interacts with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl [70]. It is important to note that the filled d-valence band of Cu leads to an unfavorable interaction with the furanic ring of furfural caused by the repulsion between the occupied furfural π orbitals. Thus, the interaction of furfural on Cu via η1 (O) or η2 (C,O) configuration is enhanced, which results in activation of CO bond favoring CO hydrogenation. As a result, it is also likely (based on the low selectivity to furan) that there may be inhibition of CO poisoning afforded by the copper matrix, as has been reported for ‘single atom alloy’ catalysts [59,75,76]. Overall however, the critical point is the comparison (Fig. 5d) of activity normalized to Pt amount, which clearly shows ultra-dilute catalysts have the potential to enable us to efficiently use the scarce resource of precious metals in a way that isn’t achieved by near stoichiometric alloys and outperforms (very significantly under some conditions) the platinum efficiency of the pure Pt catalyst."
8,Conclusions,"PtCu bimetallic alloy catalysts, including an “Ultra-Dilute” Alloy (UDA, 1:20 atomic ratio) catalyst all exhibit higher reactivity for furfural hydrogenation than pure copper. The UDA catalyst at 10 and 20 bar is nearly as selective as pure Pt, but (after a brief induction period) exhibits much higher per platinum atom activities, making better use of scarce precious metal resources. The surface metal compositions determined by XPS compared well with ICP-OES analysis of the metal ratios present and the synthesis method used, and PXRD shows the catalysts broadly follow the expected trend for their alloy compositions. XPS additionally demonstrated an electronic interaction occurred in all three alloy samples, demonstrated by shifts in the Cu 2p and correspondingly in the Pt 4d indicating Pt→Cu electron transfer had occurred. As the best operating reaction conditions for this system are still relatively mild in comparison with those seen for the industrial copper chromite standard (typically >200 °C, ∼30 bar), and these materials make more efficient use of scarce Pt than other precious metal catalysts reported, the data has shown that PtxCu(1-x) bimetallic catalysts, especially at high Pt dilution, are a promising, green and environmentally friendly alternative in the push to switch to bio-renewable chemical feedstocks."
