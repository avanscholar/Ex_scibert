0,Introduction,"In the context of environmental pollution, abuse of natural resources, deletion of fossil energy and greenhouse effect, the conversion of renewable resources into value-added chemicals have received widespread attention [1]. Photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen driven by renewable energy is a good method of solar energy conversion [2,3]. The slow kinetics of water oxidation reaction requires higher overpotential, which leads to low energy conversion efficiency. Compared with oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution is considered to have more economic value [4,5]. In order to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production, hole sacrifice agents (such as triethanolamine, lactic acid) are commonly used in photocatalytic water reduction systems. However, the use of hole sacrificial agent will reduce the economic efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and cause environmental pollution. A good solution is to replace the hole sacrifice agent with organic compounds to produce high value-added products while achieving hydrogen [6–9]. Benzyl alcohol is one of the simplest and most basic alcohol compounds in organic compounds. The benzaldehyde and benzoic acid produced by oxidation of benzyl alcohol are essential industrial raw materials, as well as important intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and pesticides [10]. Compared with traditional organic synthesis method, photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with the production of hydrogen has important industrial significance [11]. Therefore, it is still very desirable to develop a recyclable and efficient photocatalytic double-optimal system for photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with hydrogen evolution [12,13]. In the reports on photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, there are different opinions on the active substances produced during the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde [14–17]. Researchers often use acetonitrile (CH3CN), benzotrifluoride (BTF) and other organic solvents as reaction media to dissolve more oxygen, which can effectively generate •OH, •O2 –, •HO2 or H2O2 to promote the oxidation of benzyl alcohol [18]. The mechanism is usually explained as the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol under the co-oxidation of •O2 – and holes. In recent years, although there have been many reports on the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with hydrogen evolution in the water solvent under Ar atmosphere [18,19], the mechanism of the reaction process is quite different. For example, Zhang and coworkers used g-C3N4 nanosheet as catalyst to photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water, and concluded that the hydrogen comes from the oxidation dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol [20]. Hao et. al. used ZnS-NixSy to selectively oxidize benzyl alcohols coupled with H2 evolution in anaerobic water, they speculated that the protons shed from alcohol and water were reduced to H2, but this conclusion had not been proved experimentally [18]. Zhong and coworkers used ZnIn2S4 nanosheet as photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water, and the results showed that H2 is actually derived from water splitting instead of benzyl alcohol [19]. Therefore, it is still controversial whether hydrogen is produced by oxidative dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol or hydrogen ions in water. At present, the catalysts that have been reported for photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol are: CdS@MoS2 [21], Ni/CdS [14], Ni/ZnCdS [16], ZnS-NixSy [18], mixed-phase CdS [15], CdS-MIL-125(Ti) [22], etc. It can be seen that CdS is widely used as photocatalyst due to its good visible light response and narrow band gap [23]. However, the rapid recombination of photo-generated carriers and photo-corrosion problems seriously hinder its application. Moreover, CdS is prone to serious agglomeration in the solvent, which leads to a significant decrease of its surface active sites. Therefore, a variety of methods have been used to modify CdS, such as doping with transition metals or MOFs to improve the light absorption and the life of photogenerated carrier. Our group reported that the transition metal Ni has relatively excellent performance for photocatalytic water splitting [2]. As mentioned in the above literature, Ni also has a good oxidation effect on benzyl alcohol. Therefore, modification of CdS with Ni is a good way to obtain high efficiency photocatalyst. Based on the strategy of one-step formation of hexagonal CdS(CdS(H)) and cubic CdS(CdS(C)) by introducing Cu-BDC in the CdS synthesis process [24,25]. Herein, Ni-BTC was introduced into the synthesis process of CdS, and the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composites were synthesized according to the similar Ksp value of NiS and CdS. In this method, CdS intergrowth homojunction consisting of zincblende (ZB) nanoparticles and wurtzite (WZ) microrods was synthesized [24,26–28]. The interfacial connected by chemical bonds exhibit superior charge separation performance for efficient photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, and the conversion of benzyl alcohol can reach 99.0%, the yield of benzaldehyde and hydrogen are 90.2% and 2.891 mmoL·g−1·h−1, respectively. In addition, it is of great significance to explore the reaction mechanism through the capture of reaction intermediates. At present, mass spectrometry detection is a commonly used method by labelling hydrogen using isotopes. However, the mass charge of H2 and D2 is relatively small, which will cause errors in the detection process [29]. In this study, D2O was used instead of H2O to label the hydrogen element in the reaction solvent. Since the hydrogen produced by photocatalysis can reduce styrene, the source of hydrogen and the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol were determined by measuring the mass to charge ratio of the reduced phenylethane product."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Structural characterization of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC,"2.1 Structural characterization of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC In this work, pure CdS was synthesized by hydrothermal method, and as can be seen from Fig. 1 a that the obtained CdS belongs to cubic crystal phase zinc blende CdS(ZB) (PDF #89–0440). The XRD characteristic peaks of 26.45°, 30.64°, 43.88°, 51.97° are well matched with the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal faces of CdS(ZB). A series of composite materials were synthesized by adding different amounts of Ni-BTC in the synthesis process of CdS, and labeled as CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 1a, the crystalline phase of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC gradually transformation from cubic to hexagonal with the increase of Ni-BTC content. The peaks of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC located at 24.92° (100), 26.65° (002), 28.32° (101), 43.90° (110), 52.10° (112) can be attributed to hexagonal CdS(WZ) (PDF#80–0006) [25]. After vulcanization, the structure of Ni-BTC was partially destroyed, but two peaks of Ni-BTC at 9.18° and 12.52° could still be observed (Fig. 1b). Significantly, XRD shows that CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composites have both cubic and hexagonal CdS crystal phase structure. CdS(ZB) and CdS(WB) give rise to an atomically connected junction through intergrowth. The interfacial connection through chemical bonds is expected to exhibit superior charge separation performance for efficient photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. XPS was used to analyze the surface composition and chemical valence state of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC. The full spectrum of XPS shown in Fig. 2 a exhibits that CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC contains elements of Cd, C, S, O and Ni. The presence of Cd2+ is demonstrated by peaks at 405.8 eV and 412.6 eV (Fig. 2b), which correspond to Cd 3d5/2, and Cd 3d3/2, respectively [30]. The Fig. 2c shows S 2p1/2 (163.7 eV) and S 2p3/2 (162.5 eV) of S2- in CdS [31]. As reported in the literature, CdS(ZB) and CdS(WZ) have similar XPS spectra, but the slight shift of XPS peaks to higher binding energies in CdS(WZ) clearly clarifies the structure deviation at the lattice level. The XPS peaks of Cd and S elements in CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composites were compared with the synthesized CdS(ZB) (Fig. S1) and the literature results, respectively [26]. It is found that the Cd 3d and S 2p spectra of the composite move towards the direction of high binding energy [26], suggesting that there may be an interaction between CdS(ZB) and CdS(WZ) in the composite. In C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 2d), there are two symmetrical peaks at 285.5 and 288.9 eV corresponding to the C-N and C-O functional groups, respectively [32]. The O 1 s spectra are shown in Fig. 2e, and the main peaks occurred around 531.8 eV and 533.0 eV are assigned to lattice oxygen and C-O functional group, respectively [33]. The existence of C and O elements proves the existence of BTC in the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC. The cure-fitting analysis of Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2f) shows the presence of Ni2+ species, which can be respectively confirmed by the B.E. of 856.3, 861.2, 864.5, 874.1, 879.7 eV, and it is in good agreement with the literatures [34–37]. The peaks located at 856.3 and 861.2 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p3/2 satellite signal appears at 864.5 eV, and the peaks of Ni 2p1/2 can be found in 874.1 and 879.7 eV [38–40]. XPS results further demonstrate the synthesis of composite materials and there may be interactions between CdS(ZB) and CdS(WZ) [30]. The common morphology of CdS includes 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional structures [41], which depend on synthesis conditions, such as precursor, reaction temperature, reaction time, and solvent [42]. The SEM image of Ni-BTC is shown in Fig. 3 a, which appears as irregular blocks [43]. It can be seen from Fig. 3b that the synthesized CdS(ZB) is a spherical material with a size of about 50 nm. When Ni-BTC was added in the synthesis process of CdS, two kinds of morphologies appear in the composite material (Fig. 3c, d). Ni-BTC has no obvious morphology in Fig. 3c, d, and the residual Ni-BTC crystals may be uniformly mixed in the composite material. SEM mapping images (Fig. S2) show that Ni, Cd and S are uniformly distributed on the surface of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC. The addition of Ni-BTC will affect the formation process of CdS. When Ni-BTC was added to the CdS synthesis process, orange-yellow CdS precipitates were formed at first. Then the framework structure of Ni-BTC was destroyed by sulfide to produce black NiS precipitate, only part of the original Ni-BTC was maintained. The S ion in NiS will be slowly snatched by the Cd ions in the solution to form CdS precipitate with a lower solubility product constant. The color of reaction solution will change from black to orange-yellow after reacting for 1 h and 24 h (Fig. S3). It shows that as the reaction time increases, the formed CdS precipitates will slowly grow on the original CdS nanoparticles, and finally form CdS nano-rods [44]. The morphologic transformation from nanoparticles to nanorods induced by crystal growth will lead to the formation of intergrowth homojunction between zincblende (ZB) nanoparticles and wurtzite (WZ) microbars [26]. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were also analyzed by TEM. There are large numbers of spherical CdS overlapped with rod-shaped CdS (Fig. 3e). From the Fig. 3f can be learned that the lattice distance of 0.291 nm corresponds to the (200) plane of cubic zincblende CdS, and 0.315 nm lattice fringe belongs to the (101) plane of hexagonal wurtzite CdS. The TEM results are matching well with the above XRD and SEM results."
3,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity 2.2.1 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and hydrogen evolution In order to study the photocatalytic performance of the composite, Ni-BTC, CdS(ZB) and a series of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC were used as photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and simultaneous hydrogen evolution. It was found that CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-3 has the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance (Fig. 4 a) when benzyl alcohol was added into the photocatalytic water decomposition system. Based on these conditions, the influence of other conditions on the photocatalytic performance was further studied. Second, the reaction solvent was screened. The photocatalytic performance of hydrogen production and benzyl alcohol oxidation was compared with different rations of water and acetonitrile as the reaction solvent (Fig. 4b). It can be seen from Fig. 4b that the water is the best solvent for benzyl alcohol oxidation and hydrogen production. Next the relationship between the molar content of benzyl alcohol and hydrogen production was investigated. It is worth noting that the hydrogen production is proportional to the molar ration of benzyl alcohol, but hydrogen production begins to decrease when the benzyl alcohol content reaches 100 mM, as shown in the Fig. 4c. It may be that too much benzyl alcohol is adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, which will slow down the desorption process of the product and reduce the reaction rate [45]. After optimizing the conditions, it was found that using CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-3 as catalyst, adding 10 mM benzyl alcohol into H2O, the conversion of benzyl alcohol can reach 99.0%, the yield of benzaldehyde is 90.2%, and the yield of hydrogen is 2.891 mmoL·g−1·h−1. A comparison between this work and the reported results of photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation were summarized in Table 1 . From the table it can be seen the reaction time used in this experiment is short, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol is up to 99.0%, the selectivity of benzaldehyde is reach to 90.2%, and the simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and hydrogen production are realized. More importantly, this study explores in detail the source of hydrogen compared to most of the literature [45]. Recycling tests were carried out to explore the stability of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite. After five cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC photocatalyst decreased slightly (Fig. 4d), indicating good recycling stability. The XRD pattern of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite material after cycling shows that the characteristic peak intensity of Ni-BTC decreases (Fig. S4), which may be one of the reasons for the decrease of catalytic performance. The light absorption capacity of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite was investigated by UV–vis DRS. As can be seen from Fig. 5 a that the light absorption threshold of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite is 200–550 nm, which shows a blueshift compared with pure CdS [53]. The absorbance of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC decreased with the increase of Ni-BTC content, which may be due to the fact that CdS is the main light-absorbing material in Cd(ZB)/Cd(WZ)/Ni-BTC [54]. It can be seen from DRS diagram (Fig. 5b) that the introduction of Ni-BTC changes the band gap of the material. The band-gap energy can be estimated from the tangents intercept of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC (Table 2 ). The corresponding bandgaps (Eg) of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC were further calculated by the equation (1): (αhν)n = A(hν-Eg) (1) A: the proportional constant, hν: photon energy, Eg: the corresponding bandgaps, α: optical absorption coefficient, n: equals 2. As shown in Fig. 5b, the addition of Ni-BTC can narrow the forbidden band width compared with the pure CdS(ZB). Ai et al. reported a CuS/CdS(H)/CdS(C) composite material [25], which is closely related to the present experiment. The contents of nickel in the catalysts with different ratios were determined by ICP-OES, and it was found that the nickel content increased from 4.96 wt% in CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-1 to 12.29 wt% in CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-5 (Table 2). The nickel content in these catalysts gradually increases with the addition of Ni-BTC increasing. The band gap of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-3 is the narrowest compared with other catalysts. It can be judged that a tight contact junction may be formed between CdS(ZB) and CdS(WZ) to reduce the band gap width. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves and pore diameter distribution curves of CdS, Ni-BTC, and CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC were studied. The hysteresis loop of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC is the H-3 type (Fig. 5c) [30]. The specific surface area of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-3 was calculated to be 67.779 m2/g, which is higher than that of Ni-BTC but slight lower than CdS(ZB). This result may be caused by the formation of different crystalline CdS and destruction of part of the Ni-BTC structure [55]. It is worth noting that CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC-3 shows a larger porosity and more mesoporous structures than CdS and Ni-BTC (Fig. 5d). The large specific surface area and the better pore structure can improve the mass transfer and promote contact between the reactants and the catalytic active sites [56]. These advantages may facilitate the electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst and accelerate the separation of electrons and holes, thus improving the catalytic performance. 2.2.2 The photoelectron chemical properties of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC PL spectroscopy was used to analyze the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The decrease of PL intensity means that the surface charge recombination is inhibited, and the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is enhanced. As shown in Fig. 6 a that with the addition of Ni-BTC, the maximum excitation wavelength of CdS changed from 540.6 nm to 553.6 nm, but the light intensity decrease. The improvement of separation efficiency is mainly due to the formation of hexagonal CdS(WZ) and cubic CdS(ZB) mixed phase, which can form a coherent homogeneous junction to accelerate the electron hole transfer and separation at the interface, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6b shows that the fluorescence lifetime of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC is higher than that of CdS(ZB), which is 1.97 ns and 1.66 ns, respectively. Photoelectric experiments were performed to further verify the electron hole transfer. The synthesized CdS nanoparticles and nanorods will form heterojunctions to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes, prolong the stability of the photocurrent and increase the intensity of photocurrent (Fig. 6c). EIS was used to study the resistance value of semiconductor material as working electrode in the electrolyte solution. Fig. 6d shows that the EIS Nyquist radius of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC is significantly smaller than that of pure CdS(ZB). Therefore, the photoelectric experiment result proves that the catalytic effect of composite catalyst is better than that of CdS(ZB) because of the CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC has a smaller resistance and faster transmission speed."
4,The mechanism of benzyl alcohol photocatalytic oxidation,"2.3 The mechanism of benzyl alcohol photocatalytic oxidation 2.3.1 Radical trapping experiment It is well known that photocatalytic oxidation reaction is a free radical reaction. The free radicals that may exist in this reaction include •OH, •O2 – and oxidative reducing substance h+, e-. In order to verify the reaction mechanism, the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in the presence of different radical scavengers. The tertiary butanol (TBA), 1,4–benzoquinone (BQ) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were selected as scavenging agents to capture the corresponding active species (•OH, •O2 –, h+), which would be beneficial to study the reaction mechanism. Fig. 7 a shows that after adding TBA, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol is 94.5%, the yield of benzaldehyde is 85.3%, and the yield of hydrogen is 2.7 mmoL·g−1·h−1. After adding 10 mM BQ in the reaction, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol reduced to 42.7%, and the yield of benzaldehyde is only 30.9%, and no hydrogen was detected. When the addition amount of benzoquinone was increased from 10 mM to 20 mM, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol and the yield of benzaldehyde also increased to 62.1% and 48.7% respectively (Fig. 7b). After using TEOA as free radical trapping agent, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol is 30.1%, the yield of benzaldehyde is 22.1%, and the yield of hydrogen is 0.20 mmoL·g−1·h−1. It is concluded that •O2 – and h+ play an important role in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and hydrogen production [15], and the influence of •OH radicals is almost negligible. The •O2 – may come from oxygen dissolved in an aqueous solution, so it is very important to verify the existence of dissolved oxygen to explore the reaction mechanism. 2.3.2 Dissolved oxygen exploration experiment Under oxygen and argon atmospheres, water was used as a solvent to compare the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol, the yield of benzaldehyde and the yield of hydrogen. It can be seen from Table 3 b that the benzyl alcohol can not be oxidized in an oxygen atmosphere without light. The conversion of benzyl alcohol is only 35.8% in oxygen atmosphere under light condition, and no hydrogen is produced (Table 3c). Compared with the argon atmosphere (Table 3a), the yield of benzaldehyde and the volume of produced hydrogen are significantly different. It can be inferred that the •O2 – oxidizes benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde is not the main mechanism for this reaction (Scheme 1 ). In the next step, the oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol in water will be further discussed through the source of H2. 2.3.3 Hydrogen source verification 2.3.3.1 Analysis of 1,4-Benzoquinone (BQ) reduction products The reaction solution with BQ as •O2 – scavenger in benzyl alcohol system was detected. The 1,4-hydroquinone, a reduction product of BQ, was found in the reaction solution, and the BQ may acts as an electronic sacrificial agent [57]. D2O was used instead of H2O as the reaction solvent, the reaction solution was extracted with DCM and analyzed by GC/MS. The molecular ion peak of 1,4–hydroquinone standard solution in H2O is m/z = 110 (Fig. 8 d). When D2O was used as solvent, the molecular ion peak of the 1,4–hydroquinone standard solution is m/z = 111 (Fig. 8b). The results indicate that deuterated 1,4-hydroquinone is present in the BQ reduction product. The source of hydrogen will be further verified by hydrogenation reduction experiments of styrene. 2.3.3.2 Styrene hydrogenation reduction experiment The detail hydrogenation experimental process of styrene was shown in Supplementary Information. Using D2O as the reaction solvent, the produced hydrogen was introduced into the styrene reaction tube with a double-ended needle. Four products may be produced by the hydrogenation of an alkene (Scheme 2 ), and the yield of phenylethane is calculated to be 78.1% by HPLC–PDA quantitatively. GC/MS was used to analyze other reduction products of styrene to prove the source of hydrogen. When the yield of phenylethane was analyzed by HPLC-PDA, trace amounts of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde were found, which indicates that benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde would enter the upper gas in the process of magnet stirring. The styrene and phenylethane were separated by GC/MS in sim mode, and phenylethane was analyzed by scan mode. Phenylethane in the sample was scanned at m/z 60 ∼ 120 under the condition that the standard material was completely separated. The loss of a CH3 radical appears to be prevalent so that the [M−CH3] molecular ion peak (m/z = 91) of phenylethane standard solution occupies the whole spectrum (Fig. 8c). Therefore, deuterated phenylethane can be determined in the hydrogenation reduction product. The hydrogenation reduction products of styrene with D2O as the reaction solvent are shown in Fig. 8a. In Fig. 8a, the product of styrene reduced by H2 is A (m/z = 91), and the product of styrene reduced by D2 is C (m/z = 92). Due to the low content of HD [29], B (m/z = 91) is styrene reduction product by hydrogen from the benzyl alcohol and D (m/z = 92) is styrene reduction product by hydrogen produced in D2O. According to the relative intensity of the styrene molecular ion peak, the ratio of hydrogen protons in the benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation and D2O was estimated to be 41.6% and 58.4%, respectively (Table 4 ). There are two sources of H2, one is that the H+ in water is reduced by electrons to form H2, and the other is the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form H2. Based on the above results, the mechanism of photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation and simultaneous hydrogen evolution was proposed (Scheme 3 ). In the beginning, benzyl alcohol and water are adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. Subsequently, upon visible light irradiation, the holes generated in CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC are able to oxidize the C-OH group in benzyl alcohol and dehydrogenate to benzaldehyde. Finally, both the benzaldehyde and hydrogen are detached from the catalyst surface. At the same time, the electronic generated in CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC are able to reduce the hydrogen protons of H2O. Firstly, H+ gains electrons to generate H, and absorbs on the catalyst surface, OH– is divorced from catalyst. The electrons then reduce a H+ from another H2O to generate H, and finally detaches from the surface of the catalyst to from H2. According to above results, it can be confirmed that the H is come from both water and benzyl alcohol in the reaction. It can be inferred from Table 4 that during the photocatalytic process, the contribution rate of holes is 41.6% and the contribution rate of electrons is 58.4%. Photogenerated carriers can be quickly transferred to the surface of benzyl alcohol for REDOX reaction owe to the good charge separation performance of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC. The structure of intergrowth homojunction can effectively promote the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to produce H2 (Fig. 9 ), Kubelka-Munk transformed reflectance spectra and Mott-Schottky plots were used to obtain the conduction band (CB) of the composite material, and it is −0.26 eV (Fig. S5) [58]. Porous network structure of Ni-BTC efficient transfer the holes from CdS surface to benzyl alcohol, further accelerate the oxidation process of benzyl alcohol [59–61]. Furthermore, the transition metal Ni has been reported also play an important role in activating the C-H bond [62]. As a result, the above factors may be responsible for the greatly enhanced photocatalytic oxidation activity of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC."
5,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a method for the synthesis of CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite was proposed. It was found that the introduction of Ni-BTC has a significant effect on the morphology and structure of CdS, and the composite containing cubic crystal phase CdS(ZB) and hexagonal crystal phase CdS(WZ) were prepared. CdS(ZB)/CdS(WZ)/Ni-BTC composite exhibits excellent photostability and photocatalytic activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and has high H2 evolution rate. The source of hydrogen was verified by hydrogenation experiment of styrene with D2O instead of H2O. It was found that the hydrogen comes from both benzyl alcohol and water, and the contribution rate of holes and electrons is 41.6% and 58.4%, respectively. The present study provides the feasibility of employing MOFs to ameliorate the photocatalytic performance of CdS, and the synthesis strategy can provide reference for the design of novel photocatalytic system for selective benzyl alcohol oxidation coupled with hydrogen evolution in green aqueous solution."
