0,Introduction,"Researchers have focused on the development of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) because of their high efficiency and fuel flexibility [1]. In recent years, a variety of SOFC structures have been reported in literature, of which tube types and flat plate types are the most widely studied cell structure [2–4]. Different types of cell structures require different manufacturing methods, and a flat plate cell has been extensively investigated because of its simplicity and low cost. To date, a few fabrication processes, e.g., dry pressing, tape casting, and tape calendering, have been invented to prepare flat plate ceramics [5–7]. Among them, tape casting and tape calendering can produce flat and large-area ceramics. These can subsequently be used for the fabrication of all kinds of electronic devices, such as multilayer ceramic capacitors and electronic ceramics. However, in some cases, organic solvents have to be selected, which is regarded to be toxic and costly [8,9]. With the current emphasis on green chemistry, environmental protection is of great concern. Fortunately, Moreno et al. [10] successfully fabricated a highly dense 8YSZ electrolyte through aqueous tape casting. They produced a flat and dense 8YSZ electrolyte by aqueous tape casting, followed by a warming pressing processing or calendering. It has also been reported that a translucent Al2O3 ceramic was achieved by this method, and by adding 10 vol% PVA this ceramic attained the highest transmittance [11]. An inorganic solvent (water) was used as the solvent in these two studies, which reduced potential environmental pollution. Tape calendering, as a traditional ceramic fabrication technology, is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 [12]. Tape calendering is a process of dispersing the ceramic powder into an organic vehicle system consisting of binders, plasticizers, and solvent to form a plastic mass, which is then sheeted into a film in a two-roll mill. Tape calendering is therefore considered to be an efficient technique that allows the binder and plasticizer to wrap the powder particles uniformly. For tape casting, binder, plasticizer, solvent, and ceramic powders are required to be pre-mixed to form a slurry, usually with the help of a dispersant. It often has a low powder content in order to achieve a slurry with a low viscosity. To form a tape, such slurries are cast on a bench by the relative movement between a ‘doctor blade’ and a support. The thickness of the green tape can be adjusted by the height of the blade. Tape casting is a desirable approach for the fabrication of a thin sheet with a typical thickness of 100–300 μm [13]. In comparison with tape casting, tape calendering can be used to fabricate sheets with a thickness of 250–2500 μm as a higher powder content can be obtained. It has been widely used in the industrial application of ceramics, fuel cells, and other products [14]. Tape calendering offers the advantage of a simple fabrication process, inexpensive equipment, high production efficiency, and a homogeneous tape with superior properties. Organic solvent-based tape calendering has been developed to prepare the ceramic electrolyte for fuel cells. D. Medvedev et al. [15,16] produced 35–500 μm thick BaCeO3-based electrolytes for the proton ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) using the tape calendering method with a mixture of organic solvent of gasoline and acetone. This demonstrates that tape calendering is an effective strategy for preparing PCFCs, allowing the formation of a dense electrolyte with an acceptable electrochemical performance. Similar to aqueous tape casting, tape calendering can also use water as a solvent, and be called aqueous tape calendering. Although there are some studies on SOFCs prepared by aqueous tape calendaring, the researchers mainly focused on the study of the sintering process and the fundamental performances of the tapes [17,18]. The first report on aqueous tape calendering can date back to 1993 [19]. Han et al. [18] prepared the green tape of a NiO-YSZ composite anode for SOFCs using aqueous tape calendaring and investigated its sintering properties. A Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) support layer with a thickness of 0.6 mm was achieved by the tape calendering approach and its conductivities was investigated [17]. In contrast, not much attention has been made about the tape calendering process as such. In order to explore the tape calendering, it is necessary to choose suitable binders and plasticizers [20]. Acrylic emulsions [21,22], polyacrylic acid [23], and cellulose [24] are several commonly used binders. Among them, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), as an aqueous binder, provides sufficient strength to green tapes, thereby, frequently used as a binder for aqueous tape casting [11]. Generally, when PVA is employed as the binder, the plasticizers are glycerol or polyethylene glycol (PEG), which are essential materials for obtaining superior plasticity and manipulable green tape [25,26]. Besides, compared with PEG 1000 and PEG 10000, low molecular weight PEG has a better plasticizing effect [27]. In the polymer field, research on the effects of different plasticizers on the mechanical properties of the PVA films through tensile experiments is a standard method [28]. Unfortunately, few researchers have adopted it in the process of producing SOFCs. In this study, for the first time, we propose to employ the mechanical properties of the PVA film with different plasticizer types to optimize the tape calendering formula. PVA is used as the binder for aqueous tape calendering, and the plasticizers are a single plasticizer (glycerol, PEG 200 or PEG 400), or double plasticizers (a combination of any two of glycerol, PEG 200, and PEG 400) or triple plasticizers. YSZ sheets are fabricated using an optimized PVA content and a suitable ratio of PVA to plasticizer."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material A commercially YSZ ceramic powder, 8 mol% Y2O3 stable ZrO2 (Jiaozuo Weina Technology Co., Ltd), was used as the raw material. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd, (CH2CHOH)n) was used as the binder. Glycerol (Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd, C3H5(OH)3) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG 200, PEG 400, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, H(OCH2CH2)nOH) were used as the plasticizer."
3,Test on mechanical properties of PVA film,"2.2 Test on mechanical properties of PVA film The PVA film made from a PVA solution was prepared for the measurement of its mechanical properties. The PVA solution with PVA binder, water, and plasticizers was prepared. Firstly, Glycerin, PEG 200, PEG 400, deionized water, and PVA were weighed and placed in a beaker according to the weight ratios in Table 1 . And then the beaker was kept in the oven at 80 °C for 12 h. After being taken out from the oven, the beaker was heated on a heating magnetic stirrer until PVA and plasticizers are being completely dissolved. It was cooled down to room temperature and adjusted to obtain a 20 wt% PVA solution with different plasticizers. The as-prepared PVA solution was coated on glass plates and dried to produce a PVA film at room temperature. Then the PVA film was cut into 10 mm × 100 mm long strips and left to dry at room temperature for about 24 h. All experiments were carried out at room temperature and in ambient humidity. At least three strips for each component were collected to get an average value for the final result, which may make the data more reliable. The electronic universal testing machine (SANS CMT 5205) was employed to measure the tensile strength and the elongation at break of the PVA film. The crosshead speed of the testing machine was 100 mm/min."
4,Tape calendering,"2.3 Tape calendering The PVA solution was prepared for tape calendaring with a slightly different amount of PVA compared to the PVA solution for mechanical property measurement because an appropriate power content was required to prepare a flexible green tape. Firstly, a 25 wt% PVA aqueous solution was prepared in order to increase the powder content. Secondly, various amounts of plasticizers (based on the mechanical properties experiments indicated above) were added into the PVA solution with a different quality of PVA for the tape calendering application. Finally, YSZ powder was mixed with the above solution, and then a 0.7 mm thick YSZ green tape was produced on a two-roll tape calendering machine. A 10 mm × 10 mm green tape was cut for the property measurement."
5,TG analysis,"2.4 TG analysis A thermogravimetric analysis (STA409PC, NETZSCH, Germany) was performed on the green tape to obtain a thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) curve, and the precise temperature scheme was used in the specific de-binding process."
6,Other characterizations,"2.5 Other characterizations The as-prepared green tape was sintered at 1400–1500 °C for 5 h. The Archimedes method was adopted to measure the density of the YSZ tapes. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, VGEA3, Tscan) was adopted to observe the morphology of the samples. Prior to observation, the tapes were coated with a layer of gold under a vacuum condition. High-resolution images of the surface and the cross-section at different magnifications were obtained by adopting secondary electron imaging (SEI). The conductivity of the sintered YSZ sheet was measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method on a Solartron 1260 A electrochemical working station and compared with the dry-pressed YSZ sheet."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Mechanical properties of PVA film,"3.1 Mechanical properties of PVA film 3.1.1 A single plasticizer The mechanical properties of PVA films were tested under different ratios of PVA to a single plasticizer of glycerol, PEG 200, or PEG 400. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the PVA film with different amounts of glycerol, PEG 200, or PEG 400 are shown in Fig. 1. The tensile strength of the PVA film decreases as the content of each plasticizer increases, which is consistent with that described in literature [29]. This might be due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between plasticizer and PVA [30], resulting in a decline of strength. The content of various plasticizers has a significant influence on the elongation at break of the PVA film as well. The elongation at break reaches the maximum values of 749.29% and 749.45% when the ratio of PEG 200 to PVA is 1.4 (Fig. 2 (a) ), and PEG 400/PVA is 1.2 (Fig. 2 (b)). The elongation at break of the PVA film with glycerol as the plasticizer generates the highest value of 758.37% when the ratio of glycerol to PVA is 1.4 (Fig. 2 (c)). Jiang et al. [31,32] found that the elongation at break was 428% when 10 wt% CaCl2 and 20 wt% glycerol were added into the starch-PVA film, whereas that value was only 6.43% without any additives. The remarkable increase in the elongation at break may suggest that additives such as plasticizer or water have an effect on the elongation at break of the PVA film. Water has been reported to be a suitable plasticizer for PVA [25]. Fig. 2 (d) shows the elongation at break of the PVA film with these three kinds of plasticizers. It can be seen that the effects of three types of plasticizers on the elongation at break of PVA films are similar, and they all reach a maximum value when a ratio of plasticizer to PVA is in the range 1.2–1.4. 3.1.2 Double plasticizers We investigated the mechanical properties of the PVA film in the presence of double plasticizers. Fig. 3 shows the mechanical properties of PVA film when any two of glycerol, PEG 200, or PEG 400 are combined as the plasticizer by varying the content of each plasticizer (Table 1). The tensile strength of the PVA film with double plasticizers shows a linear trend with the content of plasticizers, which is consistent with the result in Fig. 2. When the ratio of plasticizer (glycerol and PEG 200) to PVA is 1.5, the elongation at break reaches 773.26% (Fig. 3 (a)), which is slightly better than that of a single glycerol plasticizer. The enhanced mechanical property might be related to the optimal plasticity with two or more plasticizers as the plasticizer can get into places between the binder molecules [33]. The maximum elongation at the break of the PVA film is 737.74% when both PEG 400 and glycerol act as the plasticizer (Fig. 3 (b)). In PVA/plasticizer systems, hydrogen bonding occurs between PVA macromolecules, between PVA and plasticizer, as well as between plasticizer molecules [34]. Small-molecule plasticizers are more likely to enter PVA molecules and destroy their intermolecular interactions, and have a better plasticizing effect [35]. Therefore, the plasticizing effect of two plasticizers with glycerol (molecular weight 92) will be better than that of PEG 200 (molecular weight 200) and PEG 400 (molecular weight 400) as the plasticizer. Therefore, the plasticizing effect of the plasticizer with glycerol having low molecular weight will be better than that of PEG 200 and PEG 400 as the plasticizer [33,34]. The plasticizing effect becomes more significant when both PEG 200 and PEG 400 are used as the plasticizer. PEG 200 and PEG 400 have the same molecular structure, which makes it easier to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between these two plasticizers. The density of the hydroxyl groups of the plasticizer results in a reduction in the plasticizing effect [33]. Therefore, the elongation at break of the PVA film with PEG 200 and PEG 400 as the plasticizer produces the smallest value of the systems with double plasticizer, which is 718.60% (Fig. 3 (c)). We also found that the double plasticizer with glycerol had an excellent effect on the overall flexibility, as shown in Fig. 3 (d). 3.1.3 Triple plasticizers The property of PVA film with triple plasticizers was investigated as well, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 (a) represents the mechanical properties of PVA film with glycerol, PEG 200, and PEG 400 as a triple plasticizer. The ratio of PVA to plasticizer is shown in Table 1. When the ratio of plasticizer to PVA is 1, the elongation at break reaches a maximum of 828.26%, consistent with the effects with the effect mentioned above, that two or more plasticizers can enhance the plasticity of the film. The improved property of PVA film with three plasticizers might be because the plasticizer occupies different spaces in the binder chains, and can achieve a better plasticizing effect by the addition of two or more plasticizers [33,36]. It might be because the small amount of molecular glycerol with a low glass transition temperature (190K [37]) lay outside the crystal layers of PVA, while PEG 200 and PEG 400 with a higher glass transition temperature (223K [38] and 203K [39], respectively) lay inside the crystal layers. Therefore, the synergistic effect of these three plasticizers appears to decrease the interactions in PVA [29,30]. This weakened interaction may be responsible for the decrease in the structural regularity and crystallinity, followed by an increase in the plasticizing performance. The maximum elongation values at the break of PVA film with an optimized content of a single plasticizer, double or triple plasticizers, were obtained. The result can be found in Fig. 4 (b). It can be seen from Fig. 4 (c) that the PVA film has the preferable elongation at break with a relatively low content of plasticizer content when triple plasticizers are added, compared to the values using a single plasticizer or double plasticizers, which can effectively improve the plasticity of the PVA and the solid content of the slurry during tape calendering. Therefore, when employing PVA as a binder, a combination of glycerol, PEG 200, and PEG 400 is a suitable choice. In this study, we add triple plasticizers into the PVA solution for the tape calendering processing has not been reported elsewhere."
9,TG analysis,"3.2 TG analysis Fig. 5 (a) shows the TG/DTG curve of the green tape, which is the process of dehydration between 70 and 110 °C. Subsequently, organics begins to decompose at around 190 °C, and the peaks of PVA and polyethylene glycol decomposition occurs at 235.4 °C and 264.6 °C. Most organic decomposes at around 280 °C, and all organic decomposes at about 490 °C. The properties of ceramic green tapes are completely affected by the temperature and time of de-binding in the process of thermal treatment. Based on this, the scheme of thermal treatment temperature is illustrated in Fig. 5 (b)."
10,PVA content,"3.3 PVA content Fig. 6 demonstrates SEM images of the YSZ sheets prepared with different amounts of PVA. In this study, 7 wt% PVA is the lowest amount being used for an operational process of tape calendaring. The SEM images show that the YSZ sheet with 7 wt% (Fig. 6 (a)) or 8 wt% PVA (Fig. 6 (b)) is very dense and has fewer pores compared to those with higher PVA contents (Fig. (c)–(e)). Fig. 6 (f) and Table 2 show the relative density and shrinkage of YSZ with different PVA contents at a sintering temperature of 1400 °C. When the PVA content is 7 wt% and 8 wt%, the relative density of YSZ can reach 98.3% and 98.0%, (Fig. 6 (f)). This is consistent with the results of the YSZ prepared by the tape casting method with a relative density of 98.5% when a composite aqueous binder of 7% PVA-B1070 was used in literature [40]. Moreover, the shrinkage in the length and thickness direction is relatively uniform, and both can reach 19–20%, which is in line with the shrinkage rate of the afore-mentioned YSZ materials [41]. The density (97.0%) of the YSZ sheet with 9 wt% is still acceptable. However, when the PVA content increases to 10 wt% (Fig. 6 (d)), there are more large-closed pores, and the overall number of pores increases as well. It seems that there is a suitable amount of PVA to achieve a reasonable density because the relative density begins to decline sharply, and the closed pores begin to increase gradually at a higher PVA content. No open pores were found in such a YSZ ceramic sheet. At a PVA content of 11 wt%, the relative density could only reach 93.4%, and the closed porosity reached 6.6%. Baquero [42] and Wu et al. [43] used a relatively high content of PVA 10 wt% or 9 wt% as a binder in the tape casting method, and the relative densities of YSZ were 94.5% and 95%, respectively, much lower than the relative density of YSZ when 7% PVA was employed in other instances, probably relating to an excessive amount of PVA. The above report is generally in agreement with the results of this study. It should, however, be noted that the shrinkage of the YSZ sintered body also increases with the PVA content due to the reduced amount of powder at a higher PVA content. The results indicate that 7 wt% or 8 wt% is appropriate in the tape calendering process in this study."
11,Sintering temperature,"3.4 Sintering temperature The relative density of YSZ sintered at 1400 °C, 1450 °C, and 1500 °C by the addition of 7 wt% PVA is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The relative density of YSZ can reach 98.3%, 98.7%, and 98.8%, respectively, and no significant difference is observed. It can also be seen from Table 3 that the shrinkage rates are all about 19%, and the shrinkage in the thickness, length, and width directions is homogenous. However, it is found in the SEM images (Fig. 7) of the YSZ surface that the grains grow gradually with the increase of temperature, and the size of grain boundaries increases as well. The SEM images show that 1400 °C is probably adequate to get a suitable YSZ sheet by the tape calendering method."
12,Comparison with dry pressing,"3.5 Comparison with dry pressing The tape calendered YSZ sheet is compared with that obtained by dry pressing, and the SEM images are shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the surface micrograph and the cross-section of the tape calendered YSZ and Fig. 8(c) and (d) show the surface micrograph and the cross-section of the dry pressed YSZ. The tape calendered and dry pressed YSZ were sintered at 1400 °C and 1500 °C, respectively. It can be seen that the grains of the tape calendered YSZ is uniform (Fig. 8 (a)), and the grains of dry pressed YSZ are larger and uneven (Fig. 8 (c)). Moreover, the cross-section of YSZ of the two methods in Fig. 8 (b) and (d) reveals that the tape calendered YSZ has fewer pores in comparison with the dry pressed YSZ. The microstructure of YSZ prepared by tape calendering is much preferable to that by dry pressing, and the sintering temperature of YSZ can be lower than that needed by dry pressing."
13,Conductivity,"3.6 Conductivity YSZ fabricated by dry pressing and tape calendering were sintered at 1500 °C and 1400 °C for 5 h, respectively, and their conductivity was measured at different temperatures. The results are illustrated in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9 (a), the conductivity of tape calendered YSZ at a lower sintering temperature shows no significant difference from that of dry pressed YSZ, which is 0.043 S cm−1 and 0.044 S cm−1 at 800 °C, respectively. These conductivity values are close to that of the YSZ powder from Tosoh (TZ-8Y, 0.05 S cm−1 at 800 °C) [44], and greater than that reported by wang et al. (0.027 S cm−1 at 800 °C) [45]. The activation energy (Ea) in Fig. 9 (b) is obtained from the slope of the Arrhenius plot, displaying a similar value of 1.37 eV for the tape calendered YSZ and 1.36 eV for the dry pressed YSZ. The above results further illustrate that tape calendered is a suitable method to fabricate a YSZ sheet with superior properties. Moreover, tape calendering can effectively reduce the sintering temperature and save energy consumption."
14,Conclusion,"To summarize, we applied a conventional method of mechanical properties in the polymer filed to an aqueous tape calendering process. The most superior elongations at break of 758.37% with a ratio of PEG 400 to PVA of 1:1.4, 773.26% with a ratio of glycerol and PEG 200 to PVA of 1:1.5, and 828.26% with a ratio of glycerol, PEG 200 and PEG 400 to PVA of 1:1 were obtained through the mechanical properties of the PVA films with single, double, and triple plasticizers. Based on the optimized plasticizer types of a combination of glycerol and PEG200 and PEG400, and the best ratio of 1:1 of the above plasticizer to PVA, a YSZ sheet was successfully fabricated by tape calendering. The content of PVA is optimized to be 7 wt%-8 wt% to achieve a dense and defect-free YSZ sheet. Furthermore, the optimized PVA content is selected to be 7 wt%, and the most favorable sintering temperature is 1400 °C for 5 h. After sintering, the sintered bodies displayed significant shrinkage, with the shrinkage being 19.69%. The density of YSZ reached over 98.3% after sintered at 1400 °C, and the conductivity of YSZ was 0.043 S cm−1. SEM characterization indicated that there were no visible defects after a series of parameters are optimized."
