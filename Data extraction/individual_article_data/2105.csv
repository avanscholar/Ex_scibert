0,Introduction,"Fresh bananas (Musa acuminate) are considered to be a great health-beneficial food as they contain nutritional values and antioxidant compounds such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene, dopamine, and gallocatechin (Someya, Yoshiki, & Okubo, 2002). Nevertheless, the banana is a kind of climacteric fruits, which is highly perishable and have short shelf-life because of the physical and biological deterioration after harvesting (Bhande, Ravindra, & Goswami, 2008). It was reported that living cells of post-harvest climacteric fruits respire continuously by using oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere and releasing carbon dioxide, mainly contributing to the deterioration of harvested fruits. The respiration of post-harvest bananas may result in the increase in ion leakage, weight loss, sugar levels, color change and loss in firmness and turgor, that negatively impacts on consumer acceptability (Thakur et al., 2019). It is thus of paramount importance to develop efficient and safe postharvest technologies to better preserve overall fresh banana during storage period for commercial purpose. Many attempts were employed to retard the banana ripening during storage period such as storing at low temperature (Peroni-Okita et al., 2013), using chemical treatments including nitrous oxide (Palomer, Roig-Villanova, Grima-Calvo, & Vendrell, 2005), salicylic acid (Srivastava & Dwivedi, 2000), 1-methylcyclopropene (Jiang, Joyce, & MacNish, 1999), and coatings (Soradech, Nunthanid, Limmatvapirat, & Luangtana-anan, 2017). However, harvested bananas stored at low temperature may fail to meet the commercial demand because they are highly susceptible to chilling injury as exposing to the temperature below 13 ℃ (Huang, Jian, Jiang, Duan, & Qu, 2016). The utilization of chemicals in the preservation of postharvest bananas is warned for consumer healthy due to their potential toxicity. For instance, the megaloblastic bone-marrow disease and neural symptoms were the consequence from the expose to high nitrous oxide concentration in long-term (Weimann, 2003). Consumers should be informed on salicylism when concentration of salicylate in blood over than 35 mg/dL may cause nausea delirium, psychosis symptoms and even death (Madan & Levitt, 2014; Thakur et al., 2019). Coatings are considered to be viable method for the purpose of delaying banana ripening, water loss and deterioration (Jongsri, Wangsomboondee, Rojsitthisak, & Seraypheap, 2016). Reportedly, the coating may generate modified atmosphere surrounding the fruit and act as a barrier layer to gas exchange (O2, CO2, and C2H4), leading to a decrease in respiration rate (Kumari, Mahajan, Joshi, & Gupta, 2017). Furthermore, degradable coatings are also favor for postharvest technology because of the reduction in environment pollution. Fruit coatings may made from natural materials such as polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins (Lacroix & Vu, 2013). Recently, the introduction of nanoparticles such as ZnO (La et al., 2021; Li et al., 2019; Meindrawan, Suyatma, Wardana, & Pamela, 2018) and Au (Chowdhury, Teoh, Ong, Rafflisman Zaidi, & Mah, 2020) in polysaccharide-based coatings was investigated with the aim of enhancing antibacterial activity. Similarly, silvers nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been considered as an outstanding additional active ingredient to combine into food packaging materials because of its antibacterial activity and great thermal stability (Shankar & Rhim, 2017). A small amount of silver nanoparticles were found having positive effect on human being’s health (Yu, Yin, & Liu, 2013). There is growing interest in the incorporation of active silver nanoparticles into biodegradable polymers for food packaging application such as chitosan (Kadam, Momin, Palamthodi, & Lele, 2019; Mironenko, Modin, Sergeev, Voznesenskiy, & Bratskaya, 2014; Salari, Sowti Khiabani, Rezaei Mokarram, Ghanbarzadeh, & Samadi Kafil, 2018), carrageenan (Roy, Shankar, & Rhim, 2019), agar (Shankar & Rhim, 2015), gelatin (Kanmani & Rhim, 2014), poly(vinyl alcohol) (Sarwar, Niazi, Jahan, Ahmad, & Hussain, 2018; Wang et al., 2020). Nevertheless, only few researches on a perfect combination of silver nanoparticles with polymers for food packaging application were reported. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), albeit a synthetic polymer, has been recognized as great candidate for food packaging field on the ground of its biodegradability, nontoxicity, good film-forming ability, transparency, and gas barrier (Chen et al., 2018; Stroescu, Stoica-Guzun, & Jipa, 2013). However, the drawback of PVOH is good affinity toward water due to hydrogen interactions between hydroxyl groups in the polymer chains and water molecules, which limited its application in food packaging area as surface hydrophilicity may facilitate the growth of bacteria (Esener, Bol, Kossen, & Roels, 1981; Yang et al., 2016). To address the above issues, the plethora of efficient approaches to decrease the affinity of PVOH to water have been reported including physically cross-linking processes, namely ultraviolet irradiation (Miranda, Gonçalves, & Amorim, 2001), electron beam irradiation (El-Mohdy, 2007), and heat treatment (Kokabi, Sirousazar, & Hassan, 2007). The water-resistance was also achieved by chemically cross-linking hydroxyl groups of PVOH with chemical agents, such as cinnamaldehyde (Gao & Yang, 2017), glutaraldehyde (Gao & Yang, 2017; Ghemati & Aliouche, 2014), glyoxal (Zhang, Zhu, & Edgren, 2010), boric acid (Miyazaki et al., 2010), and clay (Chenwei et al., 2018). In our previous report (Hoang et al., 2020), we successfully modified PVOH with two polysaccharides such agar and maltodextrin which exhibited a significant improvement in hydrophobicity of PVOH. Herein, in the present work, we utilized active nanocomposite coating developed from the combination of AgNPs in polymer blend consisting of PVOH, agar, maltodextrin for prolonging the shelf life of harvested banana (Musa acuminate). The physical and biological properties of active nanocomposite films prepared from coating solution were evaluated before coating around bananas. A further investigation was to extend the shelf life of bananas at 25 ℃ for 5 days by using PVOH/agar/maltodextrin/AgNPs nanocomposite coating through the pressurized spraying method. The appearance evaluation and changes in physicochemical properties including respiration rate, weight loss, firmness, titratable acidity, total soluble sugar, total soluble sugar, and solution pH in fruits during storage were also investigated in details."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly (vinyl alcohol) (87 %–89 % hydrolyzed) with Mw ∼ 160,000 Da and and Maltodextrin GRM1249 with DE of 20, were supplied by HiMedia (India). Agarose power ((C6H10O5)n was acquired from Van Water & Rogers (French). Silver nanopowder was procured by Sigma-Aldrich (US). All other materials, including glycerol (HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, 99 %), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99 %), and acetic acid (CH3COOH, 98 %) were used without further purification. Tested bacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus NRRL B-313 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-409 were provided by the Institute of Tropical Biology - Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (Vietnam)."
3,Preparation of nanocomposite film,"2.2 Preparation of nanocomposite film Before utilizing coating solution for banana (Musa acuminate) preservation, solid films with the same formulation of nanocomposite coating were obtained from casting solution on the polypropylene molds to characterize their structural, morphological, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties, which cannot be measured separately from fruit surface coated. Based on preliminary assays, PVOH/agar/maltodextrin matrix incorporated with appropriate amount of AgNPs was applied for coating. PVOH/agar/maltodextrin/AgNPs nanocomposite films were fabricated through the facile solution casting method. Initially, the multi-polymer solution was prepared following weight ratio of PVOH/agar/maltodextrin as 3:1:1. Glycerol (30 %w based on total weight of PVOH, agar, and maltodextrin) used as plasticizer, was added into as-prepared solution. The resulting solution was then stirred for 1 h at room temperature (27 ℃) before centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 1 min to remove bubbles. Subsequently, the dispersion of AgNPs at different contents (0.2 % w/w, 0.4 % w/w, and 0.6 % w/w of PVOH) in plasticized and centrifuged solution was obtained by using high-intensity ultrasonic equipment at 60 ℃ for 30 min. The film-forming solution was then cast on the polypropylene molds (20 cm × 20 cm) and further dried at 45 ℃ for 48 h. The dried nanocomposite films were peeled off and stabilized at 25 ℃ for 24 h prior to characterization. The PVOH/agar/maltodextrin film was remarked as PAM and the nanocomposite films were referred as PAM-0.2AgNPs, PAM-0.4AgNPs, and PAM-0.6AgNPs with incorporated AgNPs content at 0.2 %, 0.4 %, and 0.6 % w/w, respectively."
4,Characterization of nanocomposite film,"2.3 Characterization of nanocomposite film The mechanical property of nanocomposite films was measured following ASTM D882–02 standard using Universal Testing Machine (Yang Yi Technology Co., Taiwan). The 25 mm × 100 mm samples were tested under conditions as follows: load cell of 1 kN, gauge length of 50 mm, and a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break were obtained from the average value of least 5 specimens for each composition. The surface morphology of nanocomposite films was observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a JSM-IT200 Scanning Electron Microscope equipment (JEOL Ltd., Japan) and field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) using Hitachi UHR FE-SEM SU8000 (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan). The element composition on the nanocomposite film surface was determined by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy on Oxford instrument (Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis, France). The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the nanocomposite films was recorded on JASCO FT/IR-6000 spectrometer paired ATR PRO ONE (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Japan) with the wavelength range of 4000–500 cm–1. The contact angle was measured using Theta Optical Goniometer (KSV Instrument, USA) to determine the surface hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nanocomposite films was determined on a D2 PHASER - X-ray Diffraction equipment (Bruker Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) using Cu-K as radiation source. The thickness of nanocomposite films was determined due to the measurement on ten randomly selected points using digital micrometer (0.001 mm, Mitutoyo, Japan). The color of nanocomposite films and color development of banana peel during storage period were measured on Minolta CR 400 colorimeter (Konica Minolta, Japan) with a white standard color plate (L* = 93.70; a* = −0.46; b* = 3.56) as a background for color measurement. Average Hunter color values (L, a, and b) were recorded from five readings from each composition. The total color difference of films (ΔE) was calculated by following equation: (1) ΔE = (ΔL2 + Δa2 + Δb2)1/2 w here ΔL, Δa, and Δb are respectively for the difference between each color value of standard plate and film sample."
5,Application of nanocomposite on areca banana preservation,"2.4 Application of nanocomposite on areca banana preservation Maturity bananas (Musa acuminate) were collected from local fruit store in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Areca bananas with initial selection based on their uniform size, weight, and maturity were pre-treated by washing with distilled water and then blow-drying at room temperature (27 ℃). The 90 fruits obtained from the same batch with the same maturity were separated into three random lots including control (no-coating), PAM coating, and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating with 5 replications for each treatment. Banana fruits were coated with PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs solution by using the pressurized spraying method at 0.2 MPa. They were then blow-dried for 20 min and stored at 25 ℃. Changes in appearance and physicochemical properties of coated and uncoated fruits were daily measured for 5 days. 2.4.1 Titratable acidity Titratable acidity (TA) of all banana samples was determined using titration method well-described by P. Jongsri et al. (Jongsri et al., 2016) with some modification. Firstly, 10 g of sliced banana pulp was crushed and homogenized with 100 mL of distillated water by vortex for 1 min. Subsequently, 10 mL of the mixture was added with 1 % phenolphthalein indicator and titrated with 0.1 N NaOH. The end point was determined by color change of indicator. The TA (%) was expressed in the percentage of maleic acid as follows: (2) T i t r a t a b l e a c i d i t y ( % ) = V N a O H m L × C N a O H ) N × 0,067 × 100 10 g where VNaOH and CN(NaOH) are the volume and the molarity of NaOH solution, respectively, and 0.067 is the conversion factor for maleic acid. 2.4.2 Determination of pH The pH of all banana samples obtained from uncoated control, fruits coated with PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs solution was determined using digital pH meter (InoLab pH 7110-1AA112, Germany). The measurement was run in five replications for each treatment. 2.4.3 Total soluble sugar The total soluble solids of all banana samples were measured using hand refractometer (ATAGO PR-32α, Japan) and expressed in Brix˚ software. The experiments were taken at 25 ℃ and replicated in five replications for each treatment. 2.4.4 Weight loss Weight loss of bananas with and without coating was evaluated using a digital balance. Fruits were weighed at the beginning of storage at 25 ℃ and remarked as mo . During storage, fruits were daily weighed and noted as mi . The experiments were run in five replications in each treatment. The weight loss (%) was calculated as follows: (3) W e i g h t l o s s % = ( m o - m i ) m o × 100 2.4.5 Firmness The firmness (kg/cm2) was determined using hand-held penetrometer (Model GY-3, Taiwan). The firmness measurements were replicated in five times for each treatment. 2.4.6 Respiration rate The respiration rate of bananas with and without coating was measured using GS6000 Headspace Analysers (Systech Illinois, USA). Fruits were initially weighed and placed in 1 L jars fitted with a rubber septum at 25 ℃ for 4 h according to the preliminary assessment. The concentration of produced carbon dioxide was recorded after 4 h of incubation. The respiration rate was expressed in mg CO2/kg/h. The measurements were replicated in five times for each treatment. 2.4.7 Statistical analyses Research data were expressed in the mean and standard deviation. The significant difference between control and treated samples was also tested using Statgraphics 20 statistical software (Statpoint Technologies, Inc., Warrenton, VA, USA) with p-value <0.05."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of nanocomposite film,"3.1 Characterization of nanocomposite film 3.1.1 Visual appearance and color of film Flexible, smooth, and compact films without any apparent cracks or defects were produced from mixture solution of PVOH, agar, and maltodextrin loaded and un-loaded with AgNPs after drying as observed in Table 1 . Visually, PAM film presents colorless appearance meanwhile films loaded with AgNPs turn light yellow to dark brown. The apparent color of nanocomposite films was due to the dispersion of AgNPs in polymeric blend and significantly influenced by AgNPs content. A good dispersion of AgNPs is observed in PAM film containing 0.2 %w – 0.4 %w AgNPs while loaded 0.6 % w/w AgNPs generates inhomogeneous color with different bright-dark fields on the film surface. It can be seen that all films exhibit good transparence as texts under films are clearly viewed. Furthermore, the surface color of nanocomposite films was also affirmed by L, a, b and total color difference (ΔE) measurement. L value significantly decreases whereas a and b values considerably increase compared to that of unmodified PAM film, implying that the lightness of nanocomposite films decreases along with increase in redness and yellowness after the introduction of AgNPs. The total color difference (ΔE) of films increases dramatically from 3.66 ± 0.03 for unloaded PAM film to 53.52 ± 1.23, 69.37 ± 1.11, 68.22 ± 0.54, respectively for nanocomposite films containing 0.2 %, 0.4 %, and 0.6 % w/w AgNPs. These results are good consistence with visual observation of those samples. Similar finding was observed in nanocomposite films based on PVOH-nanocellulose incorporated with AgNPs with apparent yellowish-brown color (Wang et al., 2020). Kanmani and Rhim (2014) reported a similar result for gelatin film loaded AgNPs which exhibited an increase in ΔE (2.1–61.4). And similarly, in another study, the starch/PVOH/AgNPs nanocomposite films were also found in a yellow to brownish appearance (Cano, Cháfer, Chiralt, & González-Martínez, 2016). 3.1.2 Surface morphology, element composition analyses and optical properties Fig. 1 a–d illustrates the surface morphology of films at micro level. PAM film appears in smooth and compact surface without apparent pores, cavity, and bubble. This is an evidence for good compatibility and integrity between components in film formulation made from PVOH, agar, and maltodextrin. After AgNPs loading, the surface of the nanocomposite films become rough and wrinkled. The formation of wrinkled hard surfaces may be resulted from well-dispersed silver nanoparticles embedded in polymeric network. This is undoubtedly observed in PAM film containing 0.4 %w AgNPs at high resolution (Fig. 1e) as silver nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed on film surface. These findings are in line with the EDX result (Fig. 1f) which reveals the presence of Ag element besides C and O elements on the surface of 0.4 % w/w AgNPs loaded nanocomposite film. Similar observations were reported for presence of AgNPs on the surface of PVA/nanocellulose film (Sarwar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020) The existence of AgNPs in nanocomposite films is also pronouncedly evidenced from UV–vis spectra (Supplementary Fig. S1). PAM film did not show any light adsorption peak in UV–vis region ranged from 200 nm to 800 nm. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite films reveal the light adsorption peak around 430 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance of AgNPs (Kanmani & Rhim, 2014; Khan, Kumar, & Kumar, 2020; Shankar & Rhim, 2017), indicating the presence of AgNPs in resulting film which is in accordance with FE-SEM and EDX results. It can be observed that the SPR becomes intense with increasing AgNPs concentration. Notably, SPR peak shifts slightly from 428 nm to 432 nm as AgNPs content increases up to 0.6 % w/w, which is likely due to the aggregation of AgNPs at high content (Kanmani & Rhim, 2014; Khan et al., 2020). In brief, the obtained results indicated that the AgNPs were efficiently loaded into PAM matrix and the aggregation of AgNPs may occur at high loading concentration. 3.1.3 ATR-FTIR and XRD Fig. 2 demonstrates the ATR-FTIR spectra of PVOH, PAM and PAM loaded with AgNPs. The characteristic peaks of control PVOH film are observed around at around 3277 cm−1 (assigned to OH stretching vibration) and the stretch of CO bond at the region of 1092 cm−1-1030 cm-1 (Liu, Wang, Lan, & Qin, 2019). Meanwhile, the absorption peak at 2940 cm−1 corresponds to the stretch of CH vibration; 1659 cm −1 belongs to the benzene skeleton CO stretching vibration and 1254 cm−1 is related to CHOH flexing vibration (Lan, Zhang, Ahmed, Qin, & Liu, 2019). The CO stretching vibration in the residual acetate groups coming from partial hydrolysis of PVOH, is identified at 1719 cm−1 while the absorption peaks at 1429 cm−1 and 1361 cm−1 are respectively attributed to the flexion of OH groups and CH deformation vibration (Bryaskova, Pencheva, Kale, Lad, & Kantardjiev, 2010). The addition of agar and maltodextrin exerted notable changes in characteristic absorption bands of PVOH. For example, significant decrease in the peak width at 3277 cm−1 (assigned to the stretch of OH bond) and 1254 cm−1 (related to the flexion of CHOH group) is observed. Interestingly, a pronounced peak shift from 1092 cm−1 to 1030 cm−1 (corresponding to CO stretching vibration), was much likely resulted from the formation of hydrogen bonds between OH groups of PVOH, agar and maltodextrin (Madera-Santana, Robledo, & Freile-Pelegrín, 2011). The physical interaction among components (PVOH, agar, maltodextrin, glycerol) fomulated in polymer blend is expected to improve the hydrophilic nature of PVOH and maintain the integrity of blend film as applied in aqueous media. Meanwhile all the infrared spectra of PAM containing AgNPs exhibit no significant difference compared to PAM film, implying that no chemical interaction among PVOH, agar, maltodextrin, and AgNPs was formed. These results are similar with what were observed in PVOH/nanocellulose (Wang et al., 2020), agar/lignin (Salari et al., 2018), and chitosan/cellulose blends incorporated with AgNPs. However, an evolution of peak intensity of 1659 cm−1 in nanocomposite films was much likely due to the van der Waals interaction between AgNPs and polymer chains (Roy et al., 2019). XRD patterns of control PVOH, PAM, and PAM loaded with AgNPs are observed in Supplementary Fig. S2. In case of neat PVOH, the diffraction peak at 19.1 ° is considered as an evidence for semi-crystalline structure of PVOH owing to intramolecular hydrogen bonding among their OH groups (Pandit, Mazumdar, Imtiyaz, Rizvi, & Ahmad, 2019; Sarwar et al., 2018). New diffraction peak at 22.2 ° appears in film made from PVOH, agar and maltodextrin, likely because of the appearance of inhomogeneous strains in the polymeric structure. This inhomogeneity may be ascribed to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen interactions among functional groups of PVOH, agar, and maltodextrin which hindered and disturbed the intramolecular hydrogen interactions in PVOH chains. After AgNPs loading, the intensity of diffraction peak at 22.2 ° significantly decreases observed in PAM loaded with 0.2 % w/w AgNPs and become indiscernible at incoporated 0.4 %–0.6 % w/w AgNPs concentration. The reduction may be attributed to the intercalation of AgNPs hindering the intermolecular interaction between PVOH, agar, and maltodextrin. Furthermore, the absence of diffaction peaks of AgNPs in the X-ray pattern of nanocomposite films possibly suggests the superposition of all components in film formulation (Sarwar et al., 2018). It can be seen that the characteristic diffraction peak of PVOH still is retained in all diffraction patterns after the addition of agar, maltodextrin and silver nanoparticles. Similar observation was reported for the crystalline structure perpetuation of PVOH after the addition of nancoellulose and AgNPs (Sarwar et al., 2018). 3.1.4 Film thickness and mechanical properties Film thickness of control and nanocomposite samples were controlled by taking equal volume in film preparation to ensure ignorable variation. It can be seen from Table 2 the film thickness is insignificantly affected by the introduction of silver nanoparticles. The thickness behavior is in accordance with previous reports on agar/AgNPs (Rhim, Wang, & Hong, 2013) and chitosan/cellulose/AgNPs films (Salari et al., 2018). The mechanical behavior was evaluated by determination of tensile strength (Ts), elongation at break (Eb), and Young’s modulus (Ym). As observed from Table 2, the mechanical values including Ts, Ym, and Eb of PAM film, are recorded at 9.31 MPa, 20.11 MPa, and 102.86 %, respectively. The decrease in Ts and Ym is observed when the amount of AgNPs in polymeric matrix increases from 0.2 % - 0.4 % w/w. These results are much likely due to the decrease in the intra- and inter-molecular interaction between polymeric chains and discontinuity of polymeric network upon the intercalation of AgNPs that decrease the resistance to fracture of nanocomposite film. Similar behaviors were observed in the gelatin (Kanmani & Rhim, 2014) and agar (Shankar & Rhim, 2015) film loaded with AgNPs which caused the reduction in continuity and adhesion of polymeric chains. However, a slight increase of Ts of sample at 0.6 % w/w AgNPs content is still unclear. This is possibly resulted from the aggregation of AgNPs at high concentration because of hydrophilic polymer and hydrophobic AgNPs (Nur Amila Najwa, Mat Yusoff, & Nur Hanani, 2020). The Eb value of nanocomposite behaves in the contrasting trend with Ts and Ym as these surge with increasing AgNPs concentration. The increase in Eb may be due to a high compatibility between nanofiller and polymer matrix. These similar tendency of the change in mechanical property were found in other studies for carrageenan-AgNPs and PVOH-starch-AgNPs samples (Roy et al., 2019). The increment in the elongation at break of PAM-0.4AgNPs nanocomposite film up to 195 %, is considered as an important merit of the incorporation of AgNPs for the improvement of mobility and flexibility of resulting films. 3.1.5 Contact angle The hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface of nanocomposite films was determined by contact angle (CA) measurement (Supplementary Fig. S3). The higher CA suggests more hydrophobic surface and in contrast, the film surface becomes more hydrophilic at lower CA. Reportedly, the CA was directly measured between the baseline of the drop and the tangent at the drop boundary (Fisher, 1979). The rough or hetegeneous surfaces of substrate significantly affected the contact point at three-phase contact line because they were related to various processes such as moistening, spreading, and wetting (Hebbar, Isloor, & Ismail, 2017). In general, all films exhibit a gradual decrease in CA as a function of time and hydrophilic nature evidenced by CA value lower than 65 ° (Vogler, 1998). For control PVOH film, the CA value is recorded at 45 ° for first seconds and gradually decreased to 25 ° after 14 s exposure. The addition of maltodextrin alone did not improve hydrophilic character of PVOH film meanwhile PA film exhibits considerable increase in CA as compared to control PVOH film. Interestingly, both agar and maltodextrin applied in PVOH film significantly enhance the hydrophobicity of blend film when highest CA value is observed at around 50 ° after 14 s exposure. Inclusion of 0.2 % w/w AgNPs revealed the decrease in CA and further decreased with increasing AgNPs concentration up to 0.6 % w/w. The decrease in CA much likely due to the surface roughness of nanocomposite films increased after increasing AgNPs concentration as observed in SEM images. Similar behavior was observed after loading AgNPs into carrageenan film (Roy et al., 2019). Furthermore, the film surface becomes wetter with inclusion of AgNPs likely resulting from the decrease in intermolecular interaction among polymers and thus induced a reduction of surface tension of film surface (Orsuwan, Shankar, Wang, Sothornvit, & Rhim, 2016; Yoksan & Chirachanchai, 2010). 3.1.6 Antibacterial properties Antibacterial activity is considered to be equally important property for food packaging application. Herein, the inhibitory efficiency of films against E. coli and S. aureus is evaluated through the diameter of zone of inhibition as observed Fig. 3 . It is found that no bactericidal action against Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) occurred for PAM film, demonstrated by the zone of inhibition near around zero (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, the film formulations made from PMA and AgNPs reveal outstanding antibacterial activity against both E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. In general, the films loading AgNPs are more susceptible for E. coli bacteria as compared to S. aureus ones. Similar behavior was observed in agar (Ghosh et al., 2010) and chitosan/starch films loaded with AgNPs (Yoksan & Chirachanchai, 2010). This behavior may come from the difference of chemical structure and bacterial cell wall structure between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. As previously reported, Gram-positive bacteria possessed a thick peptidoglycan layer (20 nm–80 nm) and multiplex cell wall structure that negatively affected the penetration of AgNPs into bacterial cell (Salari et al., 2018; Shankar & Rhim, 2017). Meanwhile, thinner peptidoglycan layer (7 nm–8 nm) in Gram- negative strains facilitated silver nanoparticles to permeate easily. Although, exact antimicrobial mechanism of AgNPs’ has been not well-understood, many mechanism models were proposed. It was reported that AgNPs may accumulate at cell membrane because of their surface chemistry and loss of bacterial membrane’s integrity resulting in cellular death (Sondi & Salopek-Sondi, 2004). Another acceptable mechanism was due to generation of reactive oxygen species caused by the AgNPs as microbial cells suffer high oxidative stress leading to the cellular inactivation (Asharani, Low, Mun, Hande, & Valiyaveettil, 2009; Le Ouay & Stellacci, 2015). Besides, the antibacterial efficiency is significantly influenced by loaded AgNPs content into nanocomposite films. The appropriate AgNPs content loaded in nanocomposite films from 0.2 %w to 0.4 %w, results in increasing antibacterial activity from 16 mm to 19 mm against E. coli and from 13 mm to 15 mm for S. aureus. However, the bacterial inhibition slightly decreases with further increasing the AgNPs concentration, much likely due to the aggregation of AgNPs as corroborated by the red shift in UV–vis spectra that induced the reduction of exposed surface area and thus slower release of AgNPs in bacterial cell (Das & Das, 2019; Zawadzka et al., 2014). In brief, the nanocomposite films including AgNPs with great antibacterial activity hold promising potential in food packaging application."
8,Preservation of areca banana,"3.2 Preservation of areca banana 3.2.1 Sensory evaluation and color values Banana (Musa acuminate) is well known as abundant source of health-beneficial ingredients including vitamins and antioxidant compounds but it is prone to physical and chemical deterioration during contribution and storage (Amini Khoozani, Birch, & Bekhit, 2019). Herein, areca bananas were coated by PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs solution with desire to extend their shelf life. The appearance of areca banana with and without coating at 1st, 2nd, 3th, 4th, and 5th day is observed in Fig. 4 . All bananas initially appear in yellow color and unblemished surface. However, they are prone to decay with increasing storage period, as evidenced by the formation of black spots and brown pigments on the surface. In general, the uncoated areca bananas exhibit rapid deterioration as compared to others with coating. It can be evidenced by the fact that the appearance of black spots on uncoated banana is observed within day 2 meanwhile coated bananas with PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs did not appear any black spots or brown pigment. The higher protection of surface coatings toward water vapor and the postpone in the respiration rate of bananas resulted in the decrease of the aging of the bananas. Reportedly, the formation of brown pigment was because of polyphenol oxidase which changes in phenol to quinine, and polymerization resulting in the increase in macromolecules (Thomas, 2016). The appearance of bananas with PAM-0.2AgNPs coating was better than that of fruits with PAM coating and without coating. It can be pronouncedly seen that PAM-0.2AgNPs coating provides best preservation for banana as slight changes were observed on the visual appearance of banana after 5th day of storage meanwhile uncoated fruits became partially rotten. The key element contributing to good protection of PAM-0.2AgNPs coating might come from the antibacterial activity of this film coating, which reduced banana deterioration during the ripening process. Similar findings were observed on bananas coated with PVOH-Glyoxal-AuNPs (Chowdhury et al., 2020) and quaternized chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose (Hu, Wang, & Wang, 2016) which have the shelf life up to 5 days with acceptable appearance. The color change on banana peel was also confirmed by lightness (L-value), redness (a-value), yellowness (b-value) measurement as seen in Table 3 . The difference in L, a, b values was agreement with the change in visual observation. The uncoated bananas exhibit significant increase in lightness (70.87–73.16) and yellowness (53.93–55.61) after 3 day of storage due to their ripping; however, these extremely decreased at day 5 because of the appearance of black spots and brown pigment. Similarly, the L-value and b-value for bananas with PAM coating and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating slightly increased after 3 day storage and those values insignificantly reduced at day 5, indicating slow deterioration of banana with coating. In general, the bananas coated with PAM-0.2AgNPs exhibited best protection as evidenced by highest L-value and b-value at the end of storage period. 3.2.2 CO2 production The respiration of banana is evaluated by the production of CO2 (mg/kg/h), an extremely crucial parameter for harvested climacteric fruits because the respiratory metabolism not only drives metabolic reactions by providing required energy but also consumes substrates (like carbohydrates). The CO2 production considerably decreases within first 3 days and 4 days for uncoated bananas and bananas with PAM coating, respectively, but that then raise further till day 5 (Table 4 ). Meanwhile the bananas with PAM-0.2AgNPs coating offer a gradual decrease in the production of carbon dioxide during the storage period. Interestingly, the PAM-0.2AgNPs coating presents lower production of CO2 in fruit during the whole storage period as compared to that in fruits with no-coating and PAM coating. For instance, the CO2 production after 5 days of storage is observed at 190.18 mgCO2/kg/h, 194.10 mgCO2/kg/h, and 105.30 mgCO2/kg/h, respectively, for fruits with no-coating, PAM coating and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating. These results showed that coating treatment with PAM-0.2AgNPs could decrease the respiration rate and thus delay fruit ripening. Early report showed the loading of AgNPs into hydrophilic polymers can diminish oxygen transport through resulting films (Lazić et al., 2020), which might have been explained for slower respiration rate of bananas coated with PAM-0.2AgNPs as compared to fruit without coating and with PAM coating. 3.2.3 Weight loss and firmness The weight loss is one of the most crucial parameters predicting the deterioration in postharvest fruits caused by the loss of water which resulted from the respiration and transpiration during storage (Díaz-Pérez, 2019). The weight loss of bananas with and without coating is presented in Fig. 5 a. In general, the weight loss of all bananas gradually increases with increasing storage period. It can be seen that uncoated bananas exhibited rapid weight loss after day 2 and reaches 9% at the end of storage. Meanwhile the weight loss was retarded for coated bananas during storage period. These results suggest that surface coatings may reduce water losses due to the modification of internal atmosphere and the block of the pores on skin (Ergun, Sargent, Fox, Crane, & Huber, 2005). Similar findings were observed in previous reports on the bananas coated with shellac/gelatin composite coating (Soradech et al., 2017), cellulose nanomaterials based coating (Deng, Jung, Simonsen, & Zhao, 2017), and soybean protein isolate-cinnamaldehyde/zinc oxide bionanocomposite coating (Li et al., 2019). It can be clearly observed that no significant difference in weight loss is observed between bananas coated with PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs in 4 days storage. Pinzon et al. (2020) reported that chemical interaction between compounds in film coating could reduce water vapor permeability and limit water loss. However, herein, no chemical interaction formed between PAM and AgNPs as demonstrated in ATR-FTIR analysis, may lead to similar water loss in fruits coated with PAM and PAM-0.2AgNPs in first section of storage process. At the end of day 5, the weight loss of postharvest bananas with no-coating, PAM coating, and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating was found at 9 %, 6.5 %, and 6 %, respectively. This showed that the PAM-0.2AgNPs coating provided the most efficient preservation performance for bananas during the storage as compared to fruits with no-coating and PAM coating. The firmness is an important factor in fresh bananas for remarkable purpose because softening remarkably affects economic losses due to the reduction in transportability, storage time and postharvest shelf-life. In ripening progress, besides the loss of cell turgor, the depolymerization of the matrix glycans and pectins, and the loss of neutral sugars from the pectin lateral chains occurred in the cell wall and the pectin-rich layer biding with cell walls, contributing to the decrease in fruit firmness (Alos, Rodrigo, & Zacarias, 2019). In case of banana, the activity of cell wall-degrading enzymes such as pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, and cellulose mainly contributed to the decrease in pulp firmness (Ruiz-May & Rose, 2013). Furthermore, the degradation of starch consisted of unripe fruit pulps results in banana’s softening (Yahia & ArmandoCarrillo-López, 2019). Herein, it is found that the firmness of all bananas gradually declined as the storage period increased (Fig. 5b). The uncoated bananas present a significant reduction in firmness (2.7 kg/cm2–1 kg/cm2) after 5 day storage which is good correlation with weight loss. The firmness of bananas coated with PAM coating and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating slowly decreases during storage period. This is due to the fact that the coating may restrict metabolic and gas exchange (CO2 and O2), leading to the efficiency of enzymatic reactions and softening. The activity of the enzymes may be suppressed in coated bananas due to the low internal O2 level (Li et al., 2019). At the end of the storage period, the firmness of bananas with no-coating, PAM coating, and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating was respectively recorded at 1.75 kg/cm2, 1.25 kg/cm2, and 1 kg/cm2. It can be clearly found that PAM-0.2AgNPs coating brought about beneficial effect on the preservation of postharvest bananas. 3.2.4 Titratable acidity, pH, and total soluble sugar Titratable acidity (TA) of bananas (Musa acuminate) with and without coating after 5 day storage is displayed in Fig. 6 a. In general, the total acidity of all bananas gradually decreased in the whole storage period. The loss of an acidity during ripening occurred on the account of decarboxylation of tricarboxylates to produce dicarboxylates (malate and oxaloacetate) which are then decarboxylated to generate phosphoenolpyruvate and activate gluconeogenesis, resulting in the degradation of organic acids (Sweetman, Deluc, Cramer, Ford, & Soole, 2009). The uncoated bananas exhibit a decrease in TA to higher extent as compared to bananas with coatings. This was explained due to the fact that surface coating may induce a decline in fruit respiration rate and thus hinder the consumption of TA (Xu, Qin, & Ren, 2018). The PAM-0.2AgNPs coating provides best beneficial effect on the preservation of harvested bananas as evidenced by the slowest decrease in TA. The downward trend in TA was consistent with color, weight loss and firmness analyses. The pH of bananas with no-coating, PAM coating, and PAM-0.2AgNPs coating is shown in Fig. 6b. It can be pronouncedly observed that solution pH of all banana pulps gradually increases during the storage period, which is in accordance with downward trend in TA. The bananas coated with PAM-0.2AgNPs nanocomposite film exhibited a slower increase in pH as compared to bananas with no-coating and PAM coating. These phenomena indicate the protective efficiency of PAM-0.2AgNPs coating in delaying the banana ripening. The total soluble sugar (TSS) of bananas with and without treatment was evaluated during storage as observed in Fig. 6c. In general, the TSS percentage of all bananas gradually increased as increasing storage period. The upward trend is observed in %TSS of postharvest bananas due to the hydrolysis of starch to sugars such as glucose, sucrose, and fructose (Yahia & ArmandoCarrillo-López, 2019). The highest %TSS was reported for uncoated bananas during the storage period from 20 % to 28 %. The bananas with PAM coating offer lower increase in %TSS as compared to control samples and %TSS is lowest in fruits coated with PAM-0.2AgNPs on day 5. It is worthy to suggest that surface coatings may reduce respiratory rate and thus allow to decrease the hydrolysis of starch. The increase in %TSS is consistent with the change in color, firmness, weight loss, and total acidity of bananas. These outcomes indicate that PAM-0.2AgNPs coating provided the most efficient protection to harvested bananas during the whole storage period."
9,Conclusion,"In present work, the nanocomposite coating prepared from the polymer blend of PVOH, agar and maltodextrin combined with silver nanoparticles could decrease the respiration rate in bananas (Musa acuminate) and delay the their ripening. This is also suported from the reduction in the weight loss, acidity loss, pH, total soluble solids, and softening of bananas with the coating during storage period. The sensory evalution and nutrition analayses suggest that bananas coated with PAM-0.2AgNPs may extend their shelf life for 5 days at 25 ℃. Furthermore, the nanocomposite film study exhibited that the addition of AgNPs ehanced the antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus bateria and improved the plasticity of resulting film. These findings indicate that the as-developed PVOH/agar/maltodextrin/AgNPs nanocomposite coating offers a great potential in preservation technologies for postharvest agri-products, preventing distribution and storage problem of tropical commodities."
