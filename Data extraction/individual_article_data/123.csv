0,Introduction,"With the popular demand and rapid development of clean energy, hydrogen energy has drawn many attentions. Hydrogen energy can be applied in many fields, such as synthetic ammonia, power generation, petroleum refining. Recently, research on in-situ hydrogen production technology, which is suitable for portable and miniaturized mobile devices, has become a hot spot [1,2]. Discharge plasma technology can be initiated under normal temperature and pressure, and the response of starting and stopping is fast. Meanwhile, many active species are generated with the plasma initiation that can achieve rapid decomposition of the materials [3,4]. The lowest energy consumption of hydrogen production by discharge plasma can be achieved 0.08 kWh/m3H2 in the existing work [5] that is better than most methods of hydrogen production such as water electrolysis. Therefore, discharge plasma technology is considered to be a potential method for efficient hydrogen production. Especially hydrogen produced from liquid raw materials by discharge plasma, it is equivalent to storing hydrogen in a liquid and releasing it immediately by discharge plasma as needed. Liquid raw materials of hydrogen production mainly include petroleum hydrocarbons [6–8], water [9], alcohols [10,11], biomass energy [12,13], and some other organic compounds (such as benzene, toluene) [14–16]. Among these materials, alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol show great potential in hydrogen production. The discharge form of hydrogen produced from liquid raw materials mainly contains in-liquid discharge, bubble discharge, and spray discharge. The similar classification of discharge plasma can be found in other work [17,18]. Lian H et al. [19] sprayed the evaporated methanol into gas-phase gliding arc region for hydrogen production. Coupled with two-stage catalysts, a high hydrogen selectivity of 99% and a low energy consumption of 0.22 kWh/m3H2 were obtained. Thagard S M et al. [20] applied nitrogen to bubble in methanol solution for hydrogen production by electrical discharge. The energy consumption and percentage concentration of hydrogen can reach 20 kWh/m3H2, 4%, respectively. Sun B et al. [21] used in-liquid microwave discharge reforming ethanol/water mixtures for hydrogen production that a considerable hydrogen flow rate of 13 L/min was achieved. In this work, hydrogen produced from ethanol/water mixtures by in-liquid pulsed discharge is investigated. The concentration of the ethanol/water mixtures is 50 vol% because the previous studies have proved that the flow rate of hydrogen is higher at the concentration [22]. The effects of electrode configurations and solution pH on hydrogen production are particularly analyzed. In addition, considering the strong lights can be emitted in the process of in-liquid discharge, so the effect of commercial TiO2 addition on hydrogen production is also researched."
1,Experimental setup and methods,"In this work, two kinds of electrode configurations were tested for hydrogen production by pulsed discharge in 50% ethanol/water mixtures, including multi-needle and needle-plate as shown in Fig. 1 . The structures of multi-needle contain needle-needle, needle-2 needles, needle-4 needles, needle-8 needles, needle-12 needles, needle-24 needles and all the needles were shaped to have a sharp tip with a radius of curvature of approximately 0.2 mm. All the electrodes are made of stainless steel. The single needle electrode was connected to high positive potential, while the plate and multi-needle electrodes were grounded. The plasma reactor about 400 cm3 was powered by a high voltage power supply (DGM-60, Dalian Power Supply Technology) equipped with a maximum allowable voltage of 60 kV and frequency of 300 Hz. An oscilloscope (TDS2024B, Tektronix) with a high voltage probe (P6015A, Tektronix) and a current probe (2878, Pearson Electronics) was used to analyze the variation of voltage and current in the discharge circuit. A rotor flow meter (LZB-3, Zhengxing) was used to measure the flow rate of gas production. The mass spectrometry (HALO201, Hiden) and gas chromatography (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU) were used to make qualitative and quantitative analysis of gas production. The optical emission spectra (OES) analysis used to detect free radicals generated during discharge was executed by a multi-channel spectrum analyzer (PMA-11, Hamamatsu Photonics). The conductivity and pH of ethanol solution were detected by a conductivity meter (PHSJ-3F, Leici) and a pH meter (DDSJ-308F, Leici) respectively. Acidity is adjusted by sulfuric acid, alkalinity is adjusted by sodium hydroxide and the solution conductivity is adjusted by sodium sulfate. The detailed flow chart can be found in the previous work [22]. According to product analysis, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C, CH3OH and some macromolecular organics can be found after discharge [23]. Meanwhile, considering the strong light emission during the discharge process, the commercial TiO2 catalyst (P25, Degussa) was used to further increase the hydrogen yield. The calculation methods of some main parameters are listed as below. (1) ω H 2 = V H 2 V total gas (2) ω H 2 = V H 2 V total gas (3) W = ∫ v ( t ) i ( t ) d t (4) ω = 50 W ⋅ f 3 Q H 2 (5) η = W 1 2 C U 2 where Q H2 refers to the flow rate of hydrogen (mL/min), Q total gas refers to the flow rate of total gas (mL/min), ω H2 refers to the percentage concentration of hydrogen (%), V H2 and V total gas refer to the volume of hydrogen and total gas respectively detected by GC (mL), W refers to energy of single pulsed discharge (J), v(t) and i(t) refer to voltage and current respectively, both of them are in the function of time acquired by oscilloscope, ω refers to energy consumption of hydrogen production (kWh/m3H2), and f refers to the discharge frequency (Hz), η refers to the energy efficiency of the reactor (%), C refers to the chargeable capacitor of the power supply (3.3 nf), U refers to the peak voltage (kV)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,The effect of solution pH,"3.1 The effect of solution pH The solution pH cannot only determine discharge characteristics but also affect plasma chemical reactions [24]. The study found that different solution pH leads to different discharge inception voltage as shown in Table 1 . It is mainly due to the variation of solution conductivity. When the conductivity of the solution increases, the plasma initiation becomes difficult due to the existence of ion current. However, when the solution pH is 11 (the conductivity is about 17.7 μS/cm), the corona discharge inception voltage is lower than pH = 7 (the conductivity is about 1.4 μS/cm). It means that the initial increase in the conductivity of the solution is conducive to corona discharge, but continuous increase can inhibit the occurrence of corona discharge. While, the spark discharge initiation is strictly related to conductivity. The increase in solution conductivity makes spark discharge initiation difficult. This is why the higher or lower solution pH is not adopted in the process of discharge. A similar conclusion can be found in the Bruggeman P’s work [25]. They analyzed the effects of pH at constant conductivities and the results found that the voltage drop depends on conductivity rather than pH. The effect of solution pH on hydrogen production was carried out by needle-needle configuration with the electrode distance of 15 mm. The research found that spark discharge is more beneficial to hydrogen production. At peak voltage of 30 kV, discharge in the ethanol/water mixtures with pH = 11 obtains a higher flow rate of hydrogen. While, higher percentage concentration of hydrogen is acquired with solution pH = 3. Fig. 2 (a) shows the effect of solution pH on the flow rate of hydrogen with needle-needle configuration. When the peak voltage is 24 kV, the type of discharge with solution pH = 7 is spark discharge, while the discharge type is corona discharge with solution pH = 3 or pH = 11. Thus, the flow rate of hydrogen with solution pH = 7 is much higher than pH = 3 or pH = 11. With the increase of peak voltage, the discharge type changes to spark discharge with solution pH = 3 or pH = 11. It leads to the narrowing gap in the flow rate of hydrogen compared with solution pH = 7. At the peak voltage of 30 kV, the flow rate of hydrogen with solution pH = 11 is higher than pH = 7. It may be due to the involvement of OH− in the reaction. As equation (6) shows, OH− loses its electrons generating water, which can be directly decomposed into hydrogen or react with high-energy electrons producing ·H thereby generating hydrogen at high input energy. (6) 4 OH − − 4 e − → 2 H 2 O + O 2 (7) 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 The effect of solution pH on the percentage concentration of hydrogen is shown in Fig. 2 (b). As the peak voltage is lower than 26 kV, the plasma formed in ethanol/water mixtures with solution pH = 3 is corona discharge but spark discharge with solution pH = 7. Therefore, the percentage concentration of hydrogen with solution pH = 7 is a little higher than pH = 3. When spark discharge is formed in the solution with pH = 3, the percentage concentration of hydrogen increases rapidly that is higher than solution pH = 7. It should be attributed to H+ participating in the reaction to generate hydrogen as shown in equation (7). Compared with solution pH = 7 and pH = 3, the percentage concentration of hydrogen with solution pH = 11 is the lowest under the same discharge conditions. It not only relates to the high solution conductivity, but also be owing to the reaction of OH−. As equation (6) shows, discharge in the solution with OH− can generate O2, which can reduce the concentration of H2. With gas chromatography analysis, it was found that the oxygen content increased significantly with OH− participation. This phenomenon was not found in acidic or neutral ethanol solution. In order to confirm that the H+ or OH− can participate in the reaction under different solution pH, the characteristics of discharge and hydrogen production were studied in 50% ethanol/water mixtures whose pH is 7 but the conductivity is similar to pH = 3 or pH = 11. The solution conductivity was adjusted by sodium sulfate. The characteristic of hydrogen production is shown in Table 2 . With the same solution pH, both flow rate and percentage concentration of hydrogen decrease with the increase of conductivity. However, the change trend is different as the solution pH is varied. With the same conductivity, the ethanol solution with pH = 3 has higher percentage concentration and flow rate of hydrogen compared with the solution pH = 7. It is in line with the hypothesis that H+ participate in the reaction. Meanwhile, with the same conductivity, the ethanol solution with pH = 11 has higher flow rate but lower percentage concentration of hydrogen compared with the solution pH = 7. This is most likely due to the increase in H2 and O2 caused by the involvement of OH− when the solution is alkaline. Further verification experiments were executed by OES analysis. Fig. 3 shows the OES results of discharge in different types of ethanol solution. The black body radiation produced by the spark discharge makes the OES diagnosis appear as a wide-range continuous spectrum, and Hα (n = 3→n = 2), O ((3p5P) →(3s5S0)) can be easily observed. As Fig. 3 (a) shows, the intensity of each spectral line decreases with the increase of conductivity with the same solution pH. It confirms why the increase in conductivity decreases the hydrogen production. Fig. 3 (b) shows the spectrum of discharge in ethanol solution with different pH. Although the solution conductivities of pH = 3, pH = 11 are 69.1 μS/cm, 17.7 μS/cm, respectively, the results of OES diagnosis are different from Fig. 3 (a). The Hα spectral line of solution pH = 3 presents a high intensity. It illustrates that free radicals of ·H can be greatly generated leading to produce hydrogen. Thus, the percentage concentration of hydrogen is higher with solution pH = 3. The intensities of spectral lines Hα and O are higher as the solution pH = 11. It is well known that free radical ·H is beneficial to hydrogen production and free radical ·O is great for oxygen production. This is why the flow rate of hydrogen is higher with solution pH = 11 but the percentage concentration of hydrogen is lower due to the increase in oxygen."
4,The effect of electrode configurations,"3.2 The effect of electrode configurations The influence of electrode configurations on the flow rate of hydrogen was investigated as shown in Fig. 4 . The hydrogen production capacity of multi-needle and needle-plate configurations was analyzed. The results show that the needle-12 needles configuration presents a better effect on hydrogen production. While the traditional needle-plate and needle-needle configurations are not good for hydrogen production. In order to clarify why the needle-12 needles configuration is more suitable for hydrogen production, the discharge characteristics of different configurations were studied in this section. Take needle-8 needles and needle-12 needles for example, the V–I oscillograms of single pulsed discharge are shown in Fig. 5 . When the spark discharge is formed, the dielectric layer is broken down and the resistance instantly becomes zero, leading to generate a strong current. As Fig. 5 (a) shows, the duration ‘a’ is the librating time, which is associated with the capacitance and inductance in the loop, and the point ‘A’ is the peak current. The data of discharge characteristics from Fig. 5 are summarized in Table 3 . The librating time of needle-12 needles is shorter than needle-8 needles. It means that the loss of reactive power is less with needle-12 needles configuration. Meanwhile, the peak current, the energy of single pulsed discharge and energy efficiency are all higher with needle-12 needles, which is proved to be more conducive to matching with the power supply. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of current of these two configurations is basically the same that means the current density with these two configurations is close. Further researches concern about OES diagnosis of discharge with different electrode configurations. As Fig. 6 shows, the light intensity of the spectrum with the needle-12 needles configuration is higher than the needle-8 needles. It illustrates that more high-energy electrons and free radicals are generated with the needle-12 needles configuration. It does good to ethanol/water molecules decomposition and hydrogen production. The similar analysis and results can be found in the previous work [26,27]."
5,The effect of TiO2 addition,"3.3 The effect of TiO2 addition In-liquid spark discharge can radiate strong lights, which are suitable for combining photocatalysts in the application process. In this section, in-liquid discharge plasma cooperated with photocatalysis was researched by commercial TiO2 addition. The needle-plate configuration was used for generating discharge plasma. The TiO2 in powder form was pre-mixed in the solution by ultrasonic concussion for 1 h. During the discharge process, the TiO2 can be still continuously stirred by the strong shock waves generated from in-liquid discharge plasma. Therefore, it can be ensured that the TiO2 powder is uniformly dispersed in the solution before and after the discharge. The photos of ethanol/water mixtures with TiO2 powder can be found in supplementary material. The effects of TiO2 addition with different concentration on hydrogen production is presented in Fig. 7 . As the concentration of TiO2 is 4 mg/L, both the flow rate and the percentage concentration of hydrogen significantly increase compared with no TiO2 addition. It is mainly owing to the formation of the hole (h+) and the electron (e−) with the TiO2 addition. The hole can accelerate ethanol/water molecules decomposition and the electron can promote the generation of ·H thereby increasing hydrogen production [28]. However, the growth trend of hydrogen yield decreases rapidly when the concentration of TiO2 continues to be increased. It may be due to the turbid solution made the light transmittance poor when the concentration of TiO2 is too high, and the light emitted from the discharge cannot be fully used to generate active species reacted with ethanol/water molecules. The assumption is confirmed by the research of light emission generated by in-liquid discharge plasma with different concentration of TiO2 addition. As Fig. 8 shows, the light generated by the in-liquid discharge covers the regions of ultraviolet and visible lights, and the intensity of the light emission with 4 mg/L TiO2 is higher than that of 12 mg/L TiO2. It is consistent with the law of hydrogen production shown in Fig. 7. Considering the spectrometer probe is outside the reactor, the high concentration of TiO2 can hinder the light propagation leading to the decrease of light intensity. Therefore, it is conceivable that the light emitted from the discharge channel in the center of the reactor is difficult to effectively propagate to a far position in the reactor with a high TiO2 concentration. It makes the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions unable to fully proceed at this position, which in turn reduces the hydrogen production rate. Therefore, although the addition of photocatalyst is great for the increase in hydrogen production, it is still necessary to strictly control the concentration of the catalyst to achieve more effective improvement."
6,The comparison of different methods,"3.4 The comparison of different methods Hydrogen production by discharge plasma has become a research hotspot in recent years. Especially discharge plasma in alcohols has great potential in on-board hydrogen production. The main plasma initiation methods can be divided into in-liquid discharge (LD), bubble discharge (BD), spray discharge (SD). The bubble discharge means discharge in liquid with external bubble injection. The spray discharge is generated in gas phase and the alcohols is evaporated or carried by carrier gas into the discharge area. As shown in Table 4 , both in-liquid discharge and spray discharge show great performance on hydrogen production. Compared with pray discharge, in-liquid discharge does not require carrier gas or heating to bring alcohols into the discharge reaction zone thereby reducing the operating costs. Meanwhile, in-liquid discharge cannot mix the produced gas with the raw materials, that it brings convenience to separation and analysis. Among several plasma types of in-liquid discharge, pulsed discharge performs better in energy consumption and percentage concentration of H2. It should be owing to the relatively high peak current density, high production efficiency of active species and low discharge frequency [29,30]. It is true that compared with microwave discharge, pulsed discharge has a gap in the flow rate of H2. Thus, in-liquid pulsed discharge combined with other methods (such as photocatalysis) to synergize hydrogen production is a direction for the development of this method."
7,Conclusions,"Committed to the research of in-situ hydrogen production, this work studied the characteristics of hydrogen produced by in-liquid discharge from ethanol/water mixtures. The effects of electrode configurations, solution pH, commercial TiO2 addition on hydrogen production and the comparison of various methods of hydrogen production by discharge plasma from alcohols were emphatically discussed. The main conclusions are as below. 1. The solution pH can determine the solution conductivity thereby affecting the discharge characteristics such as the inception voltage. Besides, the solution pH can also affect the plasma chemical reaction. The acidity is conducive to increasing the percentage concentration of hydrogen, and the alkalinity is great for improving the flow rate of hydrogen at high voltage. 2. Different discharge configurations show different discharge characteristics in librating time, peak current, energy of single discharge and energy efficiency. Among several configuration, the needle-12 needles configuration shows better performance on energy efficiency and hydrogen production capacity. 3. With TiO2 addition, hydrogen yield can be increased owing to the efficient utilization of the strong lights emitted from in-liquid discharge. However, an excessively high concentration of TiO2 can affect the light transmission leading to low growth in hydrogen production. 4. In-liquid discharge for hydrogen production shows a better performance on energy consumption (this work is about 0.5 kWh/m3H2). Besides, in-liquid discharge does not require carrier gas or heating to bring liquid materials into the discharge reaction zone thereby reducing the operating costs. Therefore, in-liquid discharge has great potential in hydrogen production, especially combined with photocatalysis."
