0,Introduction,"Energy consumption is rising rapidly across the globe following the economic growth and considerable increase in population. Despite growing concerns about the accelerating depletion of resources (especially fossil fuels) and environmental degradation, fossil fuels are still the major source of energy (Díez-Ramírez et al., 2017; Wood and Roelich, 2019). In this regard, syngas energy emerges as assuring renewable energy to replace fossil fuels as energy supply via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), particularly syngas transformation to essential and clean fuels, such as synthetic gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. Indeed, syngas production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks has lately emerged as a feasible and sustainable energy source since this approach is widely considered as carbon neutral. Apparently, considerable interest was devoted to CO2 conversion for the generation of syngas or known as dry reforming, since this approach effectively utilized the undesirable CO2 greenhouse gas (Wei et al., 2021; Ravanchi and Sahebdelffar, 2021). Indeed, this approach minimized the concern related to process safety issues that normally arise in conventional techniques for generating syngas, such as steam reforming and partial oxidation. Ethylene glycol (EG) is one of the biomass-derived feedstocks, which is considered as the simplest polyol with a carbon to oxygen ratio of 1:1. It has been recently explored as a promising source for hydrogen and syngas generation through steam reforming/aqueous reforming C 2 H 6 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 5 H 2 + 2 C O 2 , Δ H 298 K = 91 k J m o l − 1 due to mild toxicity, non-volatility, non-flammability, and excellent compatibility with recent storage and transportation infrastructure (Rebsdat and Mayer, 2000). Indeed, EG can be acquired from renewable biomass, sugars, as well as sugar-alcohols (Davda et al., 2003; Blanc et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2017). This high availability of EG sources makes it an adequate and sustainable feedstock for syngas production via CO2 conversion C 2 H 6 O 2 + C O 2 → 3 C O + 2 H 2 + H 2 O , Δ G r x n = − 0.57 T r x n + 229.43 k J m o l − 1 . Due to the lack of available literature related to Ethylene Glycol-CO2 conversion (EGCC), it is desirable to conduct research to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of this new and promising route in syngas production. Additionally, it is recommended to further examine this promising route for fulfilling the gap associated with reaction mechanisms, possible side reactions, and optimum condition of EGCC before further finding the appropriate design of catalyst for EGCC. The ultimate challenges for syngas production are designing catalysts with excellent conversion, selectivity, and stability. Extensive works have been conducted using noble metal catalysts in hydrocarbon reforming owing to their superb intrinsic attributes and performance (Davda et al., 2003). Izquierdo et al. (2014) examine steam reforming of EG over Rh-based catalysts in microreactors with steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 4.0, temperature range of 898−998 K. They achieved complete conversion of EG over the catalyst with 2.5 % and 5 wt.% of Rh along with the lowest selectivity towards CH4 and generation of by-products. Nevertheless, noble metals are expensive owing to their limited resources which results in industrial applications on these metals are not feasible and economical. Therefore, catalysts based on the transition metals, such as Co-based, have been recommended as the best candidates due to their promising conversions compared to noble metals (Bac et al., 2019). Additionally, Co is considered a favourable transition metal for steam reforming (Duan and Senkan, 2005) and CO2 reforming processes (Horlyck et al., 2019). Besides, Co catalysts have been extensively evaluated in ethanol reforming, which has a similar structure to EG (Bayram et al., 2011; Dobosz et al., 2018; Fayaz et al., 2018; Lovón et al., 2012; Passos et al., 2014). In another study, Haga et al. (1997) found that Co/Al2O3 demonstrated the highest selectivity to H2 by suppressing CO methanation and ethanol decomposition side reactions (Haga et al., 1997). Therefore, Co/Al2O3 catalyst would induce similar catalytic performance in EGCC. Nonetheless, Co-based catalysts are susceptible to severe deactivation resulted from carbon formation (Sohn and Ozkan, 2016). For the purpose of addressing this challenge, the incorporation of a second metal as a promoter seems to be an interesting and potential approach to attenuate carbon deposition on the Co-based catalyst, thus enhancing activity for EGCC. Indeed, for the first time in EGCC exploration, the incorporation of the rare-earth promoter (i.e., lanthanum, La) is evaluated to test its impact on EGCC performance. Lanthanum oxide, La2O3 has been widely used as a promoter owing to its favorable properties that improved the quantity of surface oxygen and basic properties of the catalyst, hence enhanced the EGCC activity (Abdulrasheed et al., 2020; Osorio-Vargas et al., 2016). Indeed, the capability of La2O3 to adsorb acidic CO2 due to the strong basic properties leads to the intermediate La2O2CO3 carbonate formation over the catalyst surface, which further controls the rate of carbon accumulation (Abdulrasheed et al., 2020; Osorio-Vargas et al., 2016; Kok et al., 2011). In conjunction with the notable development of catalysts for syngas generation, the intention of this research is to evaluate La promoter loadings (1, 3, and 5%) impacts toward the properties and catalytic performance of 10%Co/Al2O3 for syngas production via EGCC. The selection of Al2O3 as the supporting material was due to its ability to stabilize cobalt clusters, thereby preventing active metal sintering (Li et al., 2020). Notably, to our knowledge, only aqueous phase reforming (Davda et al., 2003) and steam reforming (Larimi and Khorashesh, 2018) processes of EG were explored in the literature. Our previous works successfully conducted the first EGCC tests over Ni/Al2O3 (Bahari et al., 2018) and Ce-Co/Al2O3 (Jun et al., 2018) catalysts, in which great catalytic activity was attained during the evaluation. Therefore, this study proposes the employment of La2O3 as a promoter over Co/Al2O3 catalyst in EGCC since La2O3 provides huge advantages as reported in the literature. Interestingly, there is no effort yet being executed to examine the effect of La2O3-promoter over Co/Al2O3 catalyst towards EGCC application. The addition of La2O3-promoter is expected could effectively enhance the EGCC activity as well as minimize the amount of carbon deposited."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 10%Co/Al2O3 was generated via the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method, while β%La-10%Co/Al2O3 (β = 1%, 3%, and 5%) catalysts were prepared using the sequential IWI method. 10 wt.% Co loading was chosen according to the previous studies (Sukri et al., 2018; Fayaz et al., 2016; Nagaoka et al., 2002) that reported the optimal Co loading was at 10 wt.%. Indeed, the high Co content resulted in the agglomeration of Co species and formed large particle sizes, which led to the growth of carbon on the catalyst's surface and lowered the catalytic reforming (Sukri et al., 2018). For promoter loading, 1−5 wt.% loading was applied owing to excellent catalytic performance as well as a lower rate of carbon deposition was reported by Fayaz et al. (2016) and Siew et al. (2015). Therefore the 1−5 wt.% was applied as the promoter loading range for elucidating the effect of promoter loading and finding the optimal amount of promoter. Al2O3 support was firstly calcined about 5 h at 1023 K to prevent any physical changes during EGCC owing to thermal effect. Then, calcined support was impregnated with the required amount of Co(NO3)2.6H2O through BÜCHI Rotavapor R-200 unit about 2 h at 333 K and consequently dried overnight at the same temperature. The solid underwent calcination about 5 h at 1023 K to yield 10%Co/γ-Al2O3. For La-promoted catalysts, a measured quantity of La(NO3)3.6H2O was employed for impregnation on the as-prepared 10%Co/Al2O3 using the aforementioned procedure."
3,Characterization method,"2.2 Characterization method The textural characterization was determined using a Micromeritics Tristar II 2020 V1.04 unit at 77 K. The undesired moisture and adsorbed molecules on samples were eliminated by flowing N2 at 573 K for 1 h. Pore volume and pore diameter were computed according to the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) desorption isotherm, while Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was calculated based on the adsorption isotherm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern within 2θ = 3° to 80°, 1° min−1 scan rate, and 0.02° step size was attained via Rigaku Miniflex II unit, equipped by Cu target (λ = 1.5418 Å). The system settings were I =15 mA and V =30 kV. The XRD results were analyzed using Match! Version 2.3.3 software and compared with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles were acquired through Micromeritics AutoChem II-2920 chemisorption unit. The samples inside quartz U-tube were pre-treated at 373 K about 30 min with He gas (50 mL min−1), followed by a reduction up to 1173 K with 10 %H2/Ar (50 mL min−1). The samples were preserved at 1173 K for 30 min and then quenched to ambient temperature. The JASCO NRS-3100 unit (power <5 mW, λ = 785 nm) was utilized for attaining the Raman spectrum. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired via EM-002B TEM (V =200 kV) and Hitachi Tabletop Microscope TM3030Plus equipment, respectively. Prior to TEM analysis, a small amount of ethanol was added to the samples. Then, the resulting mixture was placed on a Cu-microgrid and mounted onto the TEM sample holder. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles for unpromoted and La-promoted catalysts after EGCC were attained via TA Instrument (TGA Q500). The samples were heated from ambient temperature to 373 K in a flow of 20 % O2/N2 mixture (100 mL min−1). The samples were further kept at a constant temperature for 30 min in similar gas compositions to completely gasify the deposited carbon before cooling down to room temperature."
4,EGCC test,"2.3 EGCC test The EGCC experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 . EGCC tests were executed in a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor for 8 h at atmospheric pressure, and a temperature of 998 K. Quartz wool was utilized to support 0.1 g of catalyst. The catalyst was pre-treated for 2 h in 50 % H2/N2 (60 ml min−1) at 1023 K, followed by purging for 30 min using N2 stream. The EG was preheated to turn into vapor before being mixed with N2 and CO2 streams. The overall flowrate utilized in the EGCC test was 70 ml min−1 (molar ratio of C2H6O2:CO2:N2 = 1:1:3), and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was retained at approximately 42 L gcat −1 h−1. Agilent 6890 Series Gas Chromatography (GC) unit fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was utilized for determining the gaseous composition collected from the outlet of the reactor. The performance for EGCC was evaluated based on conversion (Xi ; i: C2H6O2 or CO2) and yields, Y as computed in Eqs. (1)–(4). The atomic H balance computed in Eq. (1) was applied for estimating EG conversion to gaseous products, whilst F i n and F o u t representing inlet and outlet molar flow rates, respectively.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Co/Al2O3 and La-promoted characterization,"3.1 Co/Al2O3 and La-promoted characterization Fig. 2 displays the XRD patterns of fresh unpromoted and La-promoted Co/Al2O3. The La2O3 phase (JCPDS No. 83-1355) at 2θ = 29.87° and 53.42° was not detected on all La-promoted catalysts (Yang et al., 2010). The absence of the La2O3 phase could be due to the well-dispersed La2O3 particles, which were outside the detection limit (Yang et al., 2010). The estimated Co3O4 particle size for each catalyst (cf. Table 1 ) was computed by referring Scherrer equation (Patterson, 1939). Notably, the La incorporation significantly lessened the Co3O4 crystallite size of 10%Co/Al2O3 from 21.4 nm to 9.8 nm with 3%La loading. This could be explained through the dilution effect of La2O3 particles, where these particles acted as spacers to segregate Co3O4 particles as well as prevented from undergoing unnecessary growing resulted by high calcination temperature (Araujo et al., 2008; Montini et al., 2010). Quindimil et al. (2018) also noticed that Ni crystallize size was reduced after incorporation with different loadings of La promoter (5, 10, and 15 wt%) over Ni/Na-BETA zeolite catalyst. The authors also explained that the impregnation of La promoter effectively worked as a thermal stabilizer for Ni particles, thus resulting in the improvement of Ni dispersion (Quindimil et al., 2018). The N2 physisorption results for fresh unpromoted and La-promoted are recorded in Table 1. An insignificant decrease in pore volume was observed with La promoter addition, suggesting that the La promoter was finely distributed on the catalyst surface and prevented any undesirable damage towards the pore structure. This result was in agreement with BJH pore size distribution curves as depicted in Fig. 3 , for which the introduction of La did not alter the shape of the pore size distribution curves. Interestingly, between the BET surface areas of La-promoted catalysts, 3%La had the largest surface area compared with other La loadings. This result could be due to the smaller size of Co3O4 for 3%La in comparison with other catalysts. The decrement of BET surface area for 5% promoter loading compared to 3% owing to the high diffusion competition among the La2O3 promoter and Co3O4 in an excess La2O3 environment. This condition slightly affected the dispersion quality of Co3O4 on the surface of the support, hence contributing to metal agglomeration and blocking the pores of the support. Indeed, the larger size of Co particles for 5% promoter loading compared to 3% proved the metal agglomeration on the support. This postulation was in agreement with Díez-Ramírez et al. (2017), concluding that the larger size of Co particles, the lesser the surface area of the catalyst obtained (Díez-Ramírez et al., 2017). Additionally, H2-TPR profiles of unpromoted, 1%La, 3%La, and 5%La-promoted catalysts are plotted in Fig. 4 . The La-promoted catalysts experienced slight temperature shifts to lower reaction temperature regions for both deconvoluted peaks of P1 and P2, except for 5%La-10%Co/Al2O3. This observation implies that increasing La-loadings between 1% to 3% can lower the reduction temperature of Co3O4 to metallic Co. Besides, all the La-promoted catalysts had higher P3 peaks. These could be due to the decrease in Co3O4 crystallite size, which increased the degree of metal-support interaction, thus yielding a greater amount of CoAl2O4 (Kung, 1982; Reynoso et al., 2018; Srisawad et al., 2012). Meng et al. (2017) reported a similar observation in TPR results during the incorporation of La promoter on Al2O3 supported Ni catalysts. As reported, reduction peaks shifted to the lower temperature, resulting from the enhancement in Ni particle insulation and dispersion by La addition (Meng et al., 2017). In fact, the improvement in catalyst reducibility, which results from promoter incorporation, can positively boost the oxygen vacancies and ease the CO2 dissociation, thus enhancing catalytic activity (Moghaddam et al., 2018). Fig. 5 shows the Raman analyses of fresh unpromoted, 1%La, 3%La, and 5%La-promoted catalysts. All catalysts possessed similar Raman peaks corresponding to A1g (684 cm−1), F2g (612 cm−1), F2g (518 cm−1), Eg (478 cm−1), and F2g (196 cm−1) modes of the crystalline Co3O4 phase. These Raman peaks were in agreement with the literature (Ferencz et al., 2018). The Raman peak of about 684 cm−1 is ascribed with CoO6 octahedral, while the Raman peak of 196 cm−1 is ascribed to CoO4 tetrahedral (Edla et al., 2014; Jiang and Li, 2007). The existence of these two bands shows that the Co3O4 phase can be formed in both octahedral and tetrahedral positions. For La-promoted 10 %Co/Al2O3 catalysts, the Raman bands related to La2O3 phase (105 cm−1, 192 cm−1, and 409 cm−1) were not detected (Chan and Bell, 1984). The absence of La2O3-related Raman bands could be due to the small La2O3 crystallite size with low Raman reflection. However, 3%La-10%Co/Al2O3 showed lower intensity for all characteristics of Co3O4 peaks compared with other La loadings. The possible reason could be due to the enhancement of the Co3O4 dispersion on catalyst surface with La promotion, leading to the lower intensity of Co3O4 phase in Raman spectra (Zhang et al., 2018)."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 6 (a) shows the C2H6O2 and CO2 conversions of unpromoted and La-promoted catalysts at stoichiometric feed and T = 998 K. Generally, each EGCC run was carried out three times, and the error bars provided in Fig. 6 were calculated as the standard error of the mean. Among the promoter loadings, 3%La-10%Co/Al2O3 appeared as the optimal loading with C2H6O2 conversion of 77.6 %, while 5%La-10%Co/Al2O3 had the highest CO2 conversion of 48.4 %. An increase in CO2 conversion with La promoter loading due to the alkaline characteristic of La2O3, which increased the CO2 adsorption and created a dynamic equilibrium among coke accumulation and gasification (refer Eqs. (5) and (6)) (Shafiqah et al., 2019; Hou et al., 2015). (5) L a 2 O 3 + C O 2 → L a 2 O 2 C O 3 (6) L a 2 O 2 C O 3 + C → L a 2 O 3 + 2 C O Besides, according to Fig. 6(b), the 3 wt.%La content appears as the ideal promoter loading based on the performance of H2 and CO yields. The decreasing trend in catalytic activity was experienced with the employment of promoter loading beyond 3 wt.% because the active surface areas had been covered by the excessive amount of promoter. This is shown by the reduction in surface area as well as total pore volume (cf. Table 1). Indeed, the decrement noticed after the incorporation of the promoter loading beyond 3 wt.% linked to the excessive amount of promoter was coherent with the previous works (Bahari et al., 2021). Fig. 6(c) shows that the H2/CO ratios were acquired within 0.9–1.0, which is at the range of optimal feed composition for manufacturing oxygenated chemicals and higher hydrocarbons for FTS (Vo et al., 2013). The positive enhancement in catalytic performance after the incorporation of La promoter was in agreement with previous findings accomplished by Siew et al. (2014) and Yu et al. (2012) during glycerol- and methane-CO2 reforming, respectively. They also reached the conclusion that the rise in catalytic activities was credited to the enhancement in metal dispersion, basic properties, and carbon resistance with La addition (Siew et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2012). Throughout this study, the plausible reactions during EGCC over La-Co/Al2O3 catalyst could be elucidated, as seen in Fig. 7 . This new approach for syngas production is an endothermic reaction that generates only hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and water (R1) if both C2H6O2 and CO2 react in the most optimum way. Indeed, EG decomposition, as expressed in R2, also favors the production of syngas. Acetaldehyde could be formed via EG dehydrogenation (cf. R3) and further utilized in Acetaldehyde-CO2 conversion (cf. R4) or acetaldehyde decomposition (cf. R5). Methane could be generated through acetaldehyde decomposition (R5) and methanation of either CO2 or CO (cf. R6 and R7). Syngas, again, could be favorably produced through endothermic methane-CO2 conversion (cf. R8) if CH4 efficiently reacts with CO2. However, at lower temperatures, the amount of H2 generated could be higher than CO since CO was further reacted with water via exothermic water gas shift reaction (R9). Carbon could possibly be generated through the decomposition of methane (R10), Boudouard (R11), or reduction of either CO2 (R12) or CO (R13). Apart from that, the formation of ethylene from EG could also lead to the increment of carbon formation during the reaction (cf. Eqs. (7) and (8)). (7) C 2 H 6 O 2 + H 2 → C 2 H 4 + 2 H 2 O (8) C 2 H 4 → p o l y m e r s → 2 C + 2 H 2 Apparently, the syngas ratio attained during EGCC could be varied depending on all aforementioned side reactions. Indeed, it is necessary to employ an adequate amount of CO2 through the system for attaining desired syngas ratio along with minimalizing the occurrence of side reactions, which favors the formation of carbon."
8,Post-characterization,"3.3 Post-characterization The post-characterization of the selected spent 3%La-promoted and unpromoted catalysts after EGCC at F C O 2 = F C 2 H 6 O 2 = 1, and T =998 K was carried out using SEM, HRTEM, and TPO. Fig. 8 shows the SEM images of the spent 3%La-promoted and unpromoted catalysts. As illustrated, the surface of the spent unpromoted catalyst was mostly covered with whisker-like carbon. However, the surface of 3%La-promoted catalyst was partially covered with whisker-like carbon mostly due to the positive role of La2O3, which facilitated the removal of carbon from the catalyst surface. This was supported by a group of researchers who found that the La inclusion improved the reforming stability by forming La2O2CO3, which actively gasified the carbon accumulations (Fatsikostas et al., 2002; Fatsikostas and Verykios, 2004). The HRTEM images of spent catalysts are displayed in Fig. 9 . The particle size of the Co metal was larger in the unpromoted catalyst than the La-promoted catalyst. Yu et al. (2012) clarified that the smaller Co particles size of spent La-promoted catalysts implied that the La promoter slightly improved the homogeneous distribution of Co particle on the support surface (Fayaz et al., 2019). The carbon formation for both catalysts included graphitic carbon and carbon nanotube, but the unpromoted catalyst seemed to have more graphitic carbon coverage than the La-promoted catalyst. The identification of carbon nanotube coincided with the observation in SEM analysis (Fig. 8). Besides that, the formation of graphitic carbon seemed to gather mostly on areas with more cobalt metal particles. The less intense color for the HRTEM image of 3%La-10%Co/Al2O3 may suggest that the carbon formation is less severe as a result of the La2O3 promoter alleviating the carbon formation. Fig. 10 displays the weight drop percentage of spent catalysts acquired from TPO analysis. The weight drop was recorded for both spent catalysts within oxidation temperature of 748 K–873 K. The unpromoted catalyst accumulated higher carbon content (96.6 %) than that of 3%La-promoted catalyst (82.0 %). This proved that the 3%La-10%Co/Al2O3 had better catalytic stability in terms of carbon resistance. The lower amount of carbon accumulated was induced by the capability of La2O3 to form La2O2CO3 intermediate, which can react with carbon to facilitate carbon removal (Fayaz et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2013). In fact, this improvement in carbon removal was concurred by findings by Siew et al. (2014) during the investigation of the La loading effect toward the properties and catalytic performance of Ni over Al2O3-support catalyst (Siew et al., 2014). The authors justified that the alkaline properties of the La metal promoter minimized the acidity of the catalyst, thus lessening the carbon deposited during the reaction. Fig. 11 visualizes the correlation of La content (0%, 1%, 3%, and 5%) on the properties and catalytic activity of the La-promoted Co/Al2O3 catalysts. The smaller crystallite size of Co was recorded at 3% La, resulting in excellent EGCC performance. The smaller crystallite size of Ni at 3% La was induced by effective dilution and isolation of La2O3, which enhanced Co particles' dispersion and avoided Co particles' agglomeration. These properties significantly improved the catalyst's reducibility, positively boosted the catalytic activity, and attained the optimum value for EG conversion, H2 yield, and CO yield, as presented in Fig. 11. Apart from that, the smallest crystallite size of Co at 3% La managed to reduce the amount of the accumulated carbon compared to the unpromoted catalyst, in agreement with the TPO analysis. This finding was due to the capability of La2O3 to form La2O2CO3 intermediate specifically for carbon gasification. Throughout the present work, EGCC reforming over 10%Co/Al2O3 can be considered a promising route in syngas production along with other common dry reforming routes such as methane, glycerol, and ethanol. Indeed, the employment of La as the promoter for 10%Co/Al2O3 catalyst proving the capability of this metal oxide in enhancing EGCC catalytic activity and carbon resistance. Nevertheless, this promising route still not practicable for industrial since there is limited knowledge regarding the reaction mechanisms, possible side reactions, and optimum condition of EGCC. Indeed, the various types of catalysts should be extensively tested on EGCC in order to identify the best catalysts that favour high EGCC activity and stability, as well as high resistance to carbon deposition. Thus, it is recommended to further examine the aspects mentioned above to fulfill the gap related to EGCC reforming."
9,Conclusion,"Co/Al2O3 catalysts with 1, 3, and 5 wt% La promoter loadings were characterized and evaluated for EGCC with F C O 2 = F C 2 H 6 O 2 and T = 998 K. The BET surface area was found significantly decreased for 1% and 5% La promoter loadings, attributed to the large Co3O4 crystallite size and low dispersion compared with the 3% La promoter. The H2-TPR result revealed that the inclusion of 1% and 3% La improved catalyst reducibility by shifting the reduction peaks to lower temperature regions, whereas strong Co-Al support interaction was attained at 5% promoter loading. In the performance tests, the optimum La loading was achieved at 3% owing to the excellent catalytic properties (smaller metal particle size, lower reduction temperature of the metal, and homogeneous metal distribution) and activity (C2H6O2 conversion = 77.6 %, CO2 conversion = 43.1 %, H2 yield = 75.3 %, and CO yield = 76.8 %). The post-reaction characterization done on the spent catalyst identified carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphitic carbon as the main carbon sources of deactivation of catalysts. The TPO results showed that the carbon content for 3%La-10%Co/Al2O3 was lesser than the 10%Co/Al2O3 catalyst accredited to the ability of La in alleviating the carbon formation. The introduction of La promoter on the Co catalysts could be a valuable approach for this new syngas synthesis route, especially with a loading of 3 wt.%. The introduction of 3 wt.% La effectively improved the catalyst properties and boosted the catalytic performance."
