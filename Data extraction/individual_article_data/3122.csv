0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are the main source of energy for the world population, and it is estimated that by 2040, the total energy use will increase by approximately 40% [1]. Such increasing of energy demand is leading to fast environmental deterioration. Moreover, high consumption of fossil fuels leads to rising CO2 concentration, which largely contributes to climate change and global warming [2]. Therefore, researchers are paying much attention to replace fossil fuels with the alternative sources of energy that can sustain in future demand and could be beneficial for the environment. Renewable energy sources including biofuels, biohydrogen, and bioethanol have recently received much attention from academic community as they have the potential to enhance the environmental quality along with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Among them, hydrogen can be promisingly considered as a cleaner energy since it has an energy density of about 122 kJ/g [3,4]. Hydrogen (H2), as a clean energy source carrier for the future, produces 122 kJ/g energy, which is 2.75 times higher than the hydrocarbon fuels [5]. This makes it economically viable and leads to a sustainable energy source for the future [6]. As an “industrial gas,” hydrogen serves as a big global business with strong fundamentals. H2 was a market of about USD 155 billion in 2017 and, according to predictions, it will rapidly grow by 2020 [7]. Currently, hydrogen is produced using natural gasification (48%), coal gasification (18%), bio-oil (30%), water electrolysis (4%), steam reforming processes, etc. [8]. But those processes require high energy input and use of non-renewable energy sources, which also causes greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, to produce sustainable and cleaner fuel, the biological methods of hydrogen production are recommended. Recently, biohydrogen production from different carbohydrate-rich biomass and various organic wastes has received considerable attention. Generally, a vast amount of lignocellulosic biomass disposed of agriculture waste, forestry, and municipal sources can be used as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production [9]. Hydrogen can be produced using two methods: fermentation (dark or light-induced) and photolysis processes. Dark fermentation is considered as the most economically applicable due to its high H2 yield; it is also able to significantly increase the microbial growth rate in comparison with other biological methods such as photo fermentation [10]. The net energy ratio of fermentation to steam methane reforming is about 1.9:0.64 [11]. Dark fermentation generates anaerobic conditions in which the hydrogen-producing microorganisms are able to break down the carbohydrate-rich substrates through the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme. As a result, organic acids and alcohols will be produced while disposing of excess electrons in the form of H2 [12]. The promising candidates for hydrogen production via fermentation are facultative and obligate anaerobes. For example, anaerobic microorganisms such as Clostridium butyricum, Thermoanerobacterium, and thermosacchrolyticum species produce hydrogen by utilizing the hydrogen molecules to their metabolisms. During the metabolic process, the protons reduce while there would be no availability of extra external electron acceptors, which helps to increase the yield of hydrogen molecules [13]. To date, microbial hydrogen production has been studied under mesophilic to thermophilic temperature ranges (37 °C to 65 °C) using pure and mixed cultures [11,14,15], and the strain selection is based upon the required bioreactor conditions and the feedstock/substrate complexity [14,16]. Nearly 70% of the current studies are based on the mesophilic microbial utilization and yet at the laboratory scales. Recently, the focus has shifted to the thermophiles that have been found capable of producing higher hydrogen yields compared to the mesophiles [17]. This superiority is due to the easier electron transfer in the absence of light and radiative energy transfer, leading to simpler substrate transformation and utilization [18]. Hyperthermophiles growing at temperatures above 80 °C are among the interest of many scholars. This is because hyperthermophilic fermentation at elevated temperatures can reduce the pretreatment processes and avoid any contaminations during the process [19]. There has been an increasing number of research articles published with respect to mesophile/thermophiles and utilization of different biomass. But to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a lack of materials available on the hyperthermophiles and their ability towards producing H2 is not clear. It thus makes it vital to provide an extended synopsis on biohydrogen production with the emphasis on hyperthermophiles, the challenges, and the prospects for its development. Therefore, this research reviews the recent progress and new advancements in biohydrogen production from hyperthermophiles with a specific approach towards Thermotogales species. It also discusses the aspects that influence the biochemical pathways in fermentation and thermophilic H2 production. The critical discussion on the hydrogenic hyperthermophilic bacteria is emphasized followed by its genetic modifications and challenges associated to realize its sustainability. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and extended insight into a) the biochemical pathway of fermentation, b) the thermodynamics of thermophilic hydrogen production, c) the importance of cellulosic feedstock in hydrogen production, d) the mechanism of hyperthermophilic bacterial species belonging to thermothogales family, e) the genetic modifications of Thermotoga, f) an integrative approach for higher H2 yield, and g) the challenges and perspectives."
1,Microbiology and biochemical pathway of fermentation,"Studying the biochemical and biological process during anaerobic fermentation is essential as it outlines the pathways of hydrogen production and it will ease to understand the process involved. Additionally, better recognizing the biochemical process will make it easier to have possible future modifications aiming to enhance H2 production. Biochemical and microbial fermentation pathways have been described earlier by Pandey [20]. Different groups of bacteria and their enzyme associates are involved in converting the organic compounds to hydrogen production. Among them, hydrogenases are the main catalytic enzymes that regulate hydrogen metabolism. The two basic hydrogenases, i.e., [FeFe]-hydrogenase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase, are phylogenetically different with different active sites and catalyze the reversible reaction: 2 H + + 2 e − − ↔ H 2 . Several authors have investigated that [FeFe]-hydrogenases are more active compared with [NiFe]-hydrogenases, through oxidation of molecular hydrogen and are usually sensitive to oxygen [21,22]. During metabolic pathways, different types of electron carriers are utilized by hydrogenases and then reduced during the oxidation process. These carriers are NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), and ferredoxin [23]. Fig. 1 shows the fermentation of glucose by means of anaerobic bacteria for the purpose of H2 production, as a model substrate. Initially, glucose converts to pyruvate that is known as glycolytic pathways. In this process, ATP is generated from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) along with reduced form of NADH [24]. Based on different environmental conditions or different types of microorganisms pathway, pyruvate can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA and formate [25]. This process may further lead to the production of H2 and CO2. In the presence of complex carbohydrates, the fermentation process may result in a wide range of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by-products. The most common VFAs are acetate and butyrate. However, different parameters may influence the microbial community during the process. For example, physical properties in the bioreactors such as substrate loading rate, pH, temperature, and different substrate type can influence the fermentation process [26]. Theoretically, the hydrogen yield for the degradation of hexose by fermentation could reach 12 molH2/mol hexoses (Eq. (1)). In most fermentation processes, only a portion of the substrate is utilized efficiently for H2 production, and the rest of the biomass may follow different biochemical pathways without producing hydrogen [27]. In a favourable metabolic pathway towards acetic acid production, the stoichiometric yield of H2 is 4 mol for a mole of glucose (544 mL H2/g hexose at 25 °C) (Eq (2)). In contrast, when butyric acid is the final product, the yield of H2 is 2 mol for a mole of glucose (272 mL H2/g hexose at 25 °C) (Eq. (3)) [28]. When the final products are acetic, propionic and butyric acids, methanol, butanol or acetone, a lower amount of hydrogen is produced through the fermentation process. In practice, hydrogen production is associated with butyrate and ethanol production (Eqs. (3) and (4)), which further reduces the hydrogen yield [29]. (1) C6H12O6 + 6H2O → 12H2 + 6 CO2 ΔG0’ = −215.67 kJ/mol (2) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2 CH3COOH + 4H2 + 2 CO2 ΔG0’ = −261.46 kJ/mol (3) C6H12O6 → CH3(CH2)2COOH + 2H2 + 2 CO2 (4) C6H12O6 → 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 CO2 The yield of hydrogen production differs upon different factors. Therefore, designing the right process to achieve maximum yield is challenging. In this regard, a number of researchers have attempted to optimize the fermentation process to obtain the yield close to a theoretical maximum [30]."
2,Cellulosic feedstock for hydrogen production,"Cellulose-based biomass can be used as a resourceful renewable source for sustainable hydrogen production. Different plant and agricultural residuals such as grass, wood stalks, chips, straws, and forest residues are the commonly-used biomass. The above-mentioned materials and some other items used for the same purposes are among the most abundant raw materials. It is estimated their annual yields can exceed 220 billion tons worldwide, which is equivalent to 60–80 billion tons of crude oil [32]. Thus, cellulose-based biomass is considered as the fourth largest source of energy (with potential of being used as a fuel source) after coal, natural gas, and petroleum. This type of biomass can produce 14% of the world’s energy supply [13] through various ways such as biomass gasification, catalytic production of diesel fuels and value-added chemicals, and fermentative production of ethanol, methane, hydrogen, etc. [33]. Cellulose (30–70%), hemicelluloses (15–30%), and lignin (10–25%) are three main compounds of cellulose-based biomass, while its specific composition may vary in different plant species [34]. A complex network structure in the cell structure of the plats is associated with the hard binding of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the cell wall. In this network, cellulose and lignin are connected by hemicellulose that is, in turn, covalently bounded with lignin through the lignin-carbohydrate complex [35]. Lignin has a cross-linked network hydrophobic structure which makes it resistant to easily biodegrade in nature. Thus, it is considered as the main obstacle for lignocellulosic substances and their fermentation process towards H2 production. Prior to the fermentation process, several pretreatment methods may apply to remove the impurities of lignin-based biomass through physical, chemical, or biological methods. This will increase the digestibility of the cellulose-based biomass. Additionally, during the pretreatment process, cellulose structure reduces crystallinity while the surface area increases, which results in the increase of biodegradability of cellulose-based biomass [36]. To select the most efficient method, a comprehensive study is required on the physical and chemical nature of the biomass prior to further optimizing the process of achieving maximum reducing sugars [37]. In this regard, the effect of different pretreatments related to the fermentation inhibitors on the heteropolymeric structure of lignocellulose complex with respect to the H2 production was examined by authors in Ref. [32]. Physical pretreatments, e.g., grinding pretreatment of wheat straw, have been reported as effective methods to increase the H2 yield (3.4–15.3 mL/g TS to 20–35 mL/g TS) [38]. In another study, enhanced hydrogen production from the sugar-beet pulp was studied using thermal, alkaline, or microwave as a preferred pretreatment method [39]. The application of thermophilic bacteria could result in higher H2 production from cellulosic biomass. This is because at higher temperature, substrate conversion is higher, too, which results in higher H2 yields compared with the mesophilic bacteria. However, due to the slower proliferation, thermophilic bacteria have a lower volumetric hydrogen production rates compared to mesophilic bacteria [40]. In a study conducted by Kim et al. [41], co-culture of bacteria of three bacteria, i.e., Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Enterobacter cloacae, and Clostridium sp, was applied to the sewage sludge without any pretreatment process prior to fermentation. The results showed that the activity of bacteria was higher at 55 °C resembled thermophilic conditions, resulting in hydrogen yields of 15.4 mol H2/kg cellulose. In addition, in the presence of extreme thermophiles such as Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, the higher H2 production rate was reported, which resulted in effective degradation of lignocellulosic biomass [42]. However, the degree of conversion may vary while degrading the biomass using extreme thermophiles [43]. For example, while using C. saccharolyticus to utilize the switchgrass only 1.28 g/dm3 of substrate out of 30 g/dm3 is converted into the final product [44]. Table 1 shows the biohydrogen production of different substrates showing the effect of the reaction parameters with respect to hydrogen yield production. According to Table 1, reactions having neutral pH in the range of 6–7 are able to produce a higher amount of hydrogen compared with the inoculums having pH in the range of 4–5."
3,Thermodynamics involved in thermophilic hydrogen production,"Thermodynamics involved in the fermentation process is strongly associated with the amount of hydrogen generation. Different studies on the fermentation process confirm that, under optimal conditions with low partial pressure, oxidation of glucose results in the maximum production of H2 (4 molecules of hydrogen per molecule of hexose), in addition to acetate and CO2 [52]. Fermentative H2 is produced through Embden-Meyerhof catabolic pathway, which reduces equivalents in the NADH forms. This mechanism either follows the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (dehydrogenase reaction) or the pathway towards reduced ferredoxin (Fd) (pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase). The midpoint redox potentials of NAD+/NADH and oxidized ferredoxin/reduced ferredoxin are −320 and −398 mV, respectively. Recycling of these electron carriers can be accomplished through various reactions such as lactate production by reduction of pyruvate to NADH. The possibility of these reaction occurrence is determined by the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0′) model [56]. Thermodynamically, under a standard condition, while the midpoint redox potential of H+/H2 is −414 mV, the reaction becomes unfavorable for releasing the protons (H+). Therefore, ethanol and lactate by-products will be desired to be produced by ferredoxin (Fd). To keep the metabolism continued, generation of NADH and reduced ferredoxin are necessary for all fermentative hydrogen microbes. One of the main advantages of using a thermophilic bacterium is that they are able to utilize different cellulosic substrates and result in high hydrogen yields [57]. According to Zhang et al. [58], with the use of sugar substance at thermophilic temperature, the hydrogen yield increases from 8.78 to 9.90 mmol H2/g. This is because normally the production of lactic acid and ethanol decreases in thermophilic conditions, which results in high hydrogen production. Fig. 2 presents the glycolysis showing the Embden-Meyerhof pathway in thermophilic species. During the process, NADH and reduced ferredoxin are produced in the system. The reverse reaction (i.e., reoxidation of reduced ferredoxin) will take place through two different enzymes. Either catalyzed by an H2-producing membrane-bound NiFe hydrogenase or by a cytoplasmic monomeric Fe-only hydrogenase. The reducing equivalents are transferred from NADH to ferredoxin through NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Nfo) [59]. This pathway has been recognized in several thermophilic hydrogen producers. Therefore, these Nfo-encoding gene clusters can be an important factor for high yield hydrogen. Moreover, facing low or high hydrogen partial pressure will affect the sustainable production of NADH or the reaction through hydrogen production [60]. Fig. 2 shows the typical electron and carbon flow during the fermentation at low and high H2. Seven enzymes involved in the process are depicted in Fig. 2. As presented in this figure, although some thermophilic microorganisms such as T. maritima use the Embden–Meyerhof pathway for glycolysis as stated above, recycling of the reducing equivalents seems to be different from other species. It was found that Fe-only hydrogenase uses the reducing equivalents from both NADH and reduced ferredoxin in a 1:1 ratio to produce hydrogen in the system [31]. Fig. 2 also explains how this so-called bifurcating enzyme apparently utilizes exergonic oxidation of ferredoxin to resolve the unfavorable NADH oxidation [31]. T. maritima strain uses Fd:NADH oxidoreductase to provide the bifurcating hydrogenase; meanwhile, it maintains the 1:1 ratio between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADH (Eq. (5)) [61]. More importantly, the 1:1 ratio of Fd:NADH will not be disturbed by high hydrogen partial pressure, and the system will naturally produce lactate as the final product.

4,Hyperthermophilic bacteria,"Thermophilic bacteria, which belong to the archaeal and bacterial domains, can produce higher H2 volumes [52] compared to mesophiles [63]. The fermentation process of hyperthermophilic bacteria at high temperatures brings several advantages. For instance, due to the elevated temperature, there would be less chance of contamination by other microorganisms [52,64] and better pathogenic destruction [65] during the process. Additionally, it can benefit the process with a higher reaction rate, lower viscosity, and better medium mixing [66]. Moreover, sensibility to react in high H2 partial pressure is lesser compared to mesophiles [67]. Apart from the beneficial points above, bacterial growth coupled with the metabolism of H2 production may differ in presence of different feedstocks [68]. Thermotogales, referring to a type of hyperthermophile bacteria, have been considered as a preferred option for biofuel production and industrial purposes as they can produce high H2 yields (1.5–3.85 mol H2 mol−1 hexoses) from various cellulosic waste materials [69]. To obtain the optimized yield of hydrogen from biomass, anaerobic extreme thermophiles such as thermotoga spp. are the preferred options. This is because extreme thermophile bacteria produce a yield of 83–100%, which is the maximum theoretical value (4 mol hydrogen/mol glucose). Remember that H2 production also depends on many factors such as substrate concentration, immobilized cells, anaerobic conditions, etc. Interesting findings are available on different factors producing H2 such as the glycerol concentration, composition of culture medium, pH, temperature, etc. [70]."
5,Thermothogales sp,"5.1 Thermothogales sp Thermothogales roots to extreme hyperthermophiles with having the ability to grow at temperature ≥80 °C are able to utilize a wide range of sugar compounds and ferment them into acetate, CO2, and H2. Among thermotogales, Thermotoga species are gram-negative bacteria which are mainly fermentative anaerobes having optimal growing temperature in the range of 75–80 °C and mainly found in geothermally heated sediment areas [71]. Although Thermotoga spp. consist of large groups of hydrolysis enzymes that are suitable for biomass fermentation, the application of these species to the degradation of cellulosic compounds is limited, which can be attributed to the lack of exoglucanases [72]. The evolutionary history of thermotogales species was demonstrated using the Maximum Likelihood method following the Tamura-Nei model [73]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−3639.2987) is shown in Fig. 3 . The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa are clustered together is noted next to the branches. Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms were applied to investigating its pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL). Then, the topology was selected based on the superior log-likelihood value. The analysis involved 11 nucleotide sequences belonging to thermotoga species. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd + Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1446 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA6 software [74]. As presented in the phylogenetic tree of thermotogals, T. maritima and T. naepolitina are two close species with 96% similarity in their strain sequence. In recent years, Thermotoga maritima (optimum growth at 80 °C) is the type strain that has been a more focus of interest among researchers. T. maritima was chosen for its considerable potential to produce hydrogen from simple and complex carbohydrates. The strain has 7% of the predicted coding sequences in its genome [75] for the metabolism of monosaccharides and polysaccharides [76,77]. Recently, pure cultures of T. maritima have been considered as a favourable option for hydrogen production due to the ability to utilize simple and complex carbohydrates [78,79]. 5.1.1 T. maritima Thermotoga maritima belonging to the order of thermotogales are among hyperthermophilic organisms. T. maritima is a gram-negative rod-shaped non-sporulating bacterium, which is among the first discovered bacteria in the sediment of a marine geothermal area near Vulcano, Italy with the ideal temperature of 80 °C (176 °F). T. maritima catabolizes sugars and polymers as an anaerobic fermentative organism and produces by-products such as H2 and carbon dioxide. H2 produced by T. maritima is considered as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels. This is because of the ability of this bacteria to successfully metabolize cellulose and xylan. Additionally, this species produces energy during anaerobic respiration by reducing Fe (III) metabolite. Due to only recently-increased interest in biohydrogen production using T. maritima, there are few studies available examining different aspects such as the medium composition and concentration that affect the hydrogen production (see Table 2 ). For example, the growth of T. maritima might be influenced by the type of reactor during the experiment on H2 production. Maru et al. [80] studied the biohydrogen production on the fermentation of glycerol using T. maritima (DSM 3109) strain by means of two different reactors: batch and chemostat. The authors reported that maximum hydrogen production was obtained in the batch reactor (2.84 hydrogens per glycerol) compared to the chemostat reactor (2.41 mol/glycerol). Apart from the reactor type, the initial pH of 7–7.5 and a yeast extract concentration of 2 g/L will proportionally affect the batch cultivations for optimal H2 production. Several researchers reported that T. maritima is unable to grow on glycerol. However, later some other researchers would culture the bacteria on glycerol as an option to the carbon source of the medium. Maru et al. [80] reported that the growth of the bacteria on glycerol is highly dependent on its initial concentration. This is because glycerol can inhibit the growth of bacterial cells. Increasing the glycerol initial concentration to 210 mM results in an incomplete substrate consumption and low H2 production rates [80]. This could be due to the accumulation of acetic acid as an end product during the fermentation process, which leads to the inhibition of bacterial cell growth. The authors reported that improving the medium by adjusting the initial pH to 8.5 could also result in the effective growth of bacteria in the presence of glycerol. Moreover, further modification with NaCl concentration (10 g/L) and Ni+2 can enhance the hydrogenases process. Apart from the above-mentioned elements, sparging with N2 also could improve hydrogen production up to 2.8 mol H2/mol glycerol, which is comparable with results obtained by Ngo et al. [81] who reported a value of 1.23 mol H2/mol glycerol under non-N2-sparged conditions. Saidi et al. [82] introduced the C:N ratio as one of the factors affecting H2 production. According to their findings, cumulative H2 production increases from 109 mmol/L (C:N 47) to 176 mmol/L reaching H2 yield of 3.87 mol H2 mol−1 hexose, while the C:N ratio was 12. The effect of the C:N ratio on hydrogen generation could be due to the production of lactate as the final product during the fermentation process of T. maritima. Lactate production may vary from trace amounts to levels resembling that of acetate [83]. Verhaart et al. [84] stated that although acetate production inhibits the production of hydrogen, using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) enzymes can help in proton production leads to enhanced H2 generation. Till recent days, yeast has been considered as the best organic nitrogen source that can be added to any media for hydrogen production. However, in a study conducted by Saidi et al. [82], the presence of fish protein hydrolysates was considered an important source of nitrogen which can be used in the mixture, instead of yeast, for efficient hydrogen production. Authors reported relatively higher H2 productivity (24.6 mmol h−1 L−1) compared with the substrate including yeast (7.3 mmol h−1 L−1). Moreover, the supply of NH4Cl and cysteine HCl in the growth medium would further improve T. maritima growth and H2 production kinetics (24.6 mmol h−1 L−1) [82]. Cysteine HCl mainly acts as a reducing compound [85]; it can reduce the redox potential (Eh) rapidly in the culture medium up to 350 mV as anaerobic conditions stablish in the system. This condition could induce the metabolic activity initiation of T. maritima. Additional sulfured compounds, such as methionine, thiosulfate, dimethyl sulphide, and cysteine are able to decrease the inhibition of H2, which results in increased cellular growth [86]. This is because the presence of elemental sulfur, and glucose as a source of energy, can significantly enhance the growth of bacteria. In this regard, an effective medium culture is required for the maximum growth ability of T. maritima and enhanced H2 production. Jiang et al. [87] introduced a modified medium culture called TMB medium (T. maritima basal medium) for optimal growth of T. maritima. The authors considered the optimal concertation of NaCL (27 g/L), yeast extract (4 g/L), and reducing solution containing 200 L including NaOH (0.2 M); 2.5g Na2S. 9H2O; and 2.5g cysteine HCL. H2O. In some studies, co-culture of bacterial groups has been investigated. For instance, it has been reported that the co-culture of C. bescii and C. saccharolyticus can obtain the maximum H2 production rate as 98.3 ± 6.9 L−1 kg−1 (VS). Abreu et al. [88] observed that merely presence of T. maritima cannot guarantee the achievement of an improved hydrogen production. While the use of co-culture consortia of extreme thermophiles namely T. maritima and C. saccharolyticus has resulted in a significant increase of H2 production. In the Abreu et al.‘s study, a significant improvement of H2 production was obtained by the utilization of co-culture of these extremophiles with the use of xylose and cellobiose as substrate by 71 and 60 mmol h−1 L−1 for T. maritima and C. saccharolyticus, respectively. However, while evaluating the H2 production from green waste, the authors observed that the presence of T. maritima did not lead to the hydrogen production. In other words, H2 production was similar when using the co-culture of T. maritima and C. saccharolyticus compared with individual culture of C. saccharolyticus. To date, T. maritima has been hardly reported as a successful candidate for biodegradation of lignocellulose material and biohydrogen production. This could be due to its less hydrogen production despite its high hydrogen yield. 5.1.2 T. Neapolitina T. maritima and T. neapolitana are two closely-related species [89]. Thermotoga neapolitana is also a hyperthermophilic organism that grows on a wide range of substrates such as glycerol, glucose, xylose, starch, etc. [52] with an excessive potential for H2 production through fermentation [90]. This microorganism has fast growth kinetics [68], oxygen tolerance [52], and low contamination risks [91]. Few studies have reported the successful production of hydrogen using T. neapolitana (Table 2). Ngo et al. [92] observed that a very strong metabolism rate occurred in bacterial cells within the initial 15 h (1.42 0.07 g DCW L−1) of cultivation of T. neapolitana using pure sugar such as xylose. The authors stated that 90% of the xylose substrate was consumed within 24 h, showing a concentration of 0.59 0.03 g/L. In another report, while studying the usage of pure glycerol or glycerol waste, the lignocellulosic material, Miscanthus, and pure sugars (glucose/xylose) were studied regarding their effect on hydrogen production by T. neapolitana [93]. It was found that the biomass density, substrate consumption rate, and H2 production of the bacteria were higher in Miscanthus hydrolysate (showing 12.6 mmol h−1 L−1) than the rest. Production of hydrogen in hydrolyzed Miscanthus in comparison with the pure sugars could be due to the nutrient supplementation from the hydrolysate sample [93]. To obtain the optimized fermentation process, which can further help to be used in industrial scale, it is vital to provide a model and calibrate it. The most Gompertz empirical model, which is based on time series points, has been used to model the fermentation processes. Pradhan et al. [68] developed a kinetic model for H2 production using a pure culture bacterium and modelled it in a mathematical way accordingly. Molasses and cheese whey resulted in a high H2 production rate showing 1.7 mmolH2 L-/medium 1 h−1 and 0.94 mmol H2 L/medium 1 h−1, respectively [94]. Results of Cappelletti et al. [94] showed that H2 production was higher on the molasses than on the cheese whey, whereas the highest H2/substrate yields were similar for both of the substrates (2.95 molH2 mol-monosaccharide consumed 1 on the molasses and 2.50 mol H2 mol−1 monosaccharide consumed on the cheese whey). In a study by Erikson et al. [95], H2 production on glucose, xylose, arabinose, and glycerol was obtained with co-culture of Thermotoga maritima and T. neapolitana. 2.7–3.8 mol-1 sugar released in the media shows that the bacteria are able to metabolize all sugars during the hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the authors reported an interesting result on the basis of using glycerol as a substrate. According to the authors, thermotoga species will not grow or produce any hydrogen if glycerol is solely supplemented as a carbon source. Additionally, if glycerol is supplemented simultaneously with one or more sugar species, thermotoga species will be able to take up the rest of the sugars while leaving glycerol untouched. This is in accordance with the results obtained by Ngo et al. [92], where H2 production increased after 6 h, and showed a noticeable decline within 24 h, with glycerol used as the substrate. Moreover, D’Ippolito et al. [96] stated that T. neapolitana cannot grow in the absence of yeast extract and tryptone (YET). This confirms the importance of the availability of primary substrates for sustaining the initial growth. Frascari [97] used a co-fed mixture of molasses and cheese whey for H2 production at 77 °C using T. neapolitana. Based on their results, whey produced significantly higher amount of H2 and H2/substrate yields compared to the single-substrate tests. In a recent study conducted by Okonkwo et al. [98], the H2 production by co-cultivation of T. neapolitana and C. saccharolyticus showed an increased rate of H2 production and yield rate as a synthetic co-culture under optimized conditions. The H2 production showed 2.8 ± 0.09 mol H2/mol glucose more than the monoculture reported, which was due to the fast degradation of glucose in co-culture with T. neapolitana. Conversion of glucose to lactic acid instead of acetic acid under capnophilic lactic fermentation (CLF) conditions increases the H2 production [99]. To accelerate the fermentation process and increase the H2 production, Dreschkeet et al. [100] used high initial biomass concentrations (from 0.46 to 1.74 g cell dry weight/L) of Thermotoga neapolitana. The authors reported that the four-fold increase in biomass concentration would lead to the consumption of 5 g/L of glucose within 3 h with a maximum of 654 (±30) mL h−1 L−1 H2 production, which was 50% faster. The H2 production rate and H2 yield can also be improved if the pH of the culture is maintained at 7.5. As a result, acetic acid production from both hexose (glucose and sucrose) and pentose (xylose) will be higher than in non-pH-controlled batch cultures [92]. Overall, Ngo et al. [92] reported that high H2 yield in a 3-L reactor could be achieved if pH is fixed at 7 and stirring speed at 400 rpm. Remember that stirring factor can also influence the speed of hydrogen production [101]. D’Ippolito et al. [96] reported that anaerobic growth of T. neapolitana to hydrogen production is strongly affected by pH buffering, culture/headspace volume ratio, stirring, and N2 sparging. The authors reported a maximum hydrogen yield of 3.85 mol H2/mol glucose and production rate of 51 ml L−1 h−1ml/l/h during their study. Pre-treatment of the biomass prior to the degradation process will affect bacterial growth and consequently hydrogen production. Ngo et al. [81] reported that pretreated glycerol waste produced 1.97H2, showing 0.09 mol-H2 mol−1 glycerol consumed after 56 h of cultivation. The culture medium consisted of 5.0 g/L of pretreated glycerol waste and 2.0 g/L of yeast extract in different concentrations of NaCl. The authors reported that both H2 production and glycerol utilization were in their highest values at the NaCl concentration of 20 g/L. Similar results were obtained by Nguyen et al. [78] where NaCl concentration of 20 g/L was reported being optimal for H2 production by T. neapolitana with glucose as the carbon source. Apart from the substrate variability, there are few inhibitory factors that can reduce the hydrogen production. For example, the excess amount of H2 is one of the important elements that inhibits hydrogen production. Therefore, the most suitable amount of H2 needs to be determined to be applied to the reactor [97]. D’Ippolito et al. [96] stated two factors that reduce the hydrogen yield: 1) Reducing the availability of pyruvate and NADH for the hydrogenases by production of lactate and alanine, 2) Losses of glucose in the medium after conversion to fructose. However, interesting results have been reported with respect to the sister species, i.e., T. maritima, in which hydrogen production is not affected by defiance of NADH production. This is because T. maritima species belong to a novel class of hydrogenase with the simultaneous presence of NADH and reduced ferredoxin for efficient hydrogen production [102]. It has been proposed that the presence of bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase will lead to the exergonic oxidation of ferredoxin (midpoint potential, 453 mV), which drives the unfavorable oxidation of NADH (E0 320 mV) to produce H2 (E0 420 mV). Most of the H2-producing anaerobic bacteria are known to contain homologs of the trimeric bifurcating enzyme. A better perspective of H2 production during anaerobic conditions can be explained through the discovery of bifurcating hydrogenase [102]. 5.1.3 Pseudothermotoga sp Bhandari and Gupta [103] proposed reclassification of the genus Thermotoga. Accordingly, the former genus Thermotoga should retain only the species Thermotoga maritima, Thermotoga neapolitana, and Thermotoga petrophila, while the other Thermotoga species such as Thermotoga lettingae, Thermotoga thermarum, Thermotoga elfii, Thermotoga subterranea, and Thermotoga hypogea need to be classified as a new genus called Pseudothermotoga spp. However, there are only a few studies reported on pseudothermotoga species regarding their usage in hydrogen production and most of the studies are rather old and scares. This could be due to the less ability of hydrogen production of these bacteria. However, the preliminary results obtained from Pseudothermotoga sp. helped to enhance the hydrogen production obtained by T. maritima and T. neopolitina, in recent years. For example, in the study reported by Van Niel et al. [104] on properties of hydrogen production using T. elfii, the authors reported that the strain was dependent on the yeast extract as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy, regardless of other amino acids and vitamins. This information was further used by scholars to improve the H2 production of T. maritima/T. neopolitina. They also suggested that tripton is the preferred form of amino acids by T. elfii for higher hydrogen production. Miscanthus, as lignocellulosic biomass, was used to produce hydrogen using T. elfii [105]. The authors determined different pretreatment of Miscanthus for hydrogen production. They concluded that xylan solubilization increases when Miscanthus is ground into smaller particles. The authors also concluded that NaOH pretreatment along with the extrusion of the biomass (<1 mm) is able to de-lignify the component for more than 75% and T. elfii could convert 33% of biomass into monosaccharides and produce high amount of hydrogen."
6,Genetic modifications of thermotoga,"Hydrogen production theough the biological means has recently received immense attention; it is clearly revealed by the high number of research articles published during the last decade. However, lack of efficiency is still the main weakness of microbial H2 production. A theoretical stoichiometric amount of H2 from glucose is possible due to the presence of metabolic pathways (e.g., the oxidative pentose 4 phosphate pathway) in organisms. However, only limited information is available on the pathways exceeding the yield of 4 mol of H2 per mol of glucose [111]. It is expected that such theoretical high-yielding pathways would compete with the growth yield. Growth de-coupled production approaches have, therefore, been suggested for increasing the efficiency in biohydrogen production [112]. Near theoretical production of H2 by T maritima has tempted researchers to explore the role of different metabolic pathways involved in the catabolism of various sugar compounds. However, it is only possible by manipulating the microorganism at a genetic level. To this end, Nelson et al. [113] first reported genome sequence of T. maritima, which cemented it as a model hyperthermophile. Soon after, an attempt was made to transform T. maritima and T. neapolitana with antibiotic resistance to kanamycin using plasmid from thermotoga strain RQ7, but plasmid lost even with continued selective pressure. The first successful transformation of T. maritima and T sp. RQ7 was reported in 2012 by Han et al. [114]; the transformation was successful with E. coli shuttle vector conferring kanamycin resistance. This transformation paved the way for further R&D in hyperthermophilic Thermotoga for the purpose of optimizing H2 production. To achieve maximum H2 production from Thermotoga sp., the strain must be able to degrade lignocellulosic structural components: cellulose and hemicellulose. The capability of Thermotoga sp. is limited to degrading cellulose owing to lack of exoglucanases [115,116]. Xu et al. [117] addressed this deficiency by cloning cellulase genes Csac 1076 (celA) and Csac 1078 (celB) from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus to T. sp., RQ2 for heterologous overexpression. Later, three recombinant enzymes were successfully expressed in DH5α and RQ2. Though cellulase activities were lost after three consecutive transfers, the study showed that cellulose could be effectively degraded by genetic manipulation in Thermotoga species, thereby enhancing the biohydrogen production. Another important aspect is the thermostability of recombinant enzymes in the genetic engineering of hyperthermophilic thermotoga. T. maritima ferments a range of sugars to form acetate, carbon dioxide, traces of lactate, with near theoretic yields of hydrogen (H2). It is well known that catabolism of arabinose (a pentose sugar) depends on the interaction of the pentose phosphate pathway with the Embden-Myerhoff and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. However, studies are deficient regarding the effect of pathway elimination on the production of molecular H2 production, which is due to lack of genetic methods to create targeted mutants. Recently, White et al. [118] conducted a study to elaborate the role of araA (encoding arabinose isomerase) in the production of H2 by homologous chromosomal recombination. The authors found a direct impact of pentose consumption on H2 yield by comparing both wild and mutant strains. In another study, Singh et al. [119] studied the mechanism controlling the energy management of these metabolic pathways. They blocked the lactate production by transient gene inactivation, and explored that mutant cell line resulted in H2 even higher than the physiological limit of H2 formation. Bioinformatics tools are being used to study the biology systems of microorganisms that will further improve our understanding of the genetic makeup of microorganisms and further revolutionize microbial genetic engineering. Nogales et al. [111] carried out an in silico study on T. maritima and the metabolism and identified suitable carbon sources to enhance H2 production. The authors obtained an interesting result, showing 20% increase of H2 production in silico knock out strains. Therefore, authors further designed a novel synthetic oxidative module that connected the cellular NADPH and ferredoxin pools by inserting into the model NADPH-ferredoxin reductase. Combining this novel module with the knockout strain design, in silico approach, resulted in 125% increase in H2 production. This study could serve as an outline for future research in the metabolic engineering field. There is a limited number of research data available on genetic manipulation of hyperthermophilic thermotoga. However, owing to higher H2 potential by genetic modification, research efforts in this line are increasing."
7,Challenges and perspectives,"Biohydrogen production considers as an environmentally feasible alternative source to fossil fuels. However, biohydrogen production from biomass is in its preliminary stages due to the unsolved challenges during the fermentation process. One of the main challenges in this process is to attain maximum hydrogen productivity as well as high yield. Therefore, producing biohydrogen at the industry level while being economically viable has not been achieved yet. Another major challenge is hard-cell structure of some biomass such as lignocellulosic substances, which requires pretreatment prior to degradation process, results in low hydrogen production [120]. As a result, hyperthermophiles have been recently among the bacteria with a high attractiveness to many industries such as food processes and paper industries due to their capability to produce a high amount of hydrogen [121]. The enzymes extracted from these extremophilic bacteria are more stable and viable to be applied to agriculture and industrial purposes [122]. To optimize the fermentation process, further research is required for a better understanding of the role of biohydrogen pathway of hyperthermothogales and its inhibitors during the process. For example, lignocellulosic biomass, which is largely available in the environment, is a promising natural feedstock. Recently, a number of scholars have been focused on the use of lignocellulose waste as the second-generation biofuels [123]. However, utilizing such waste requires pretreatments with harsh chemicals and/or hydrothermal methods, which finally results in extensive energy consumption. Additionally, using excessive chemicals may have an adverse effect on the effective growth of these microbes in the media and relatively on its hydrogen production [124]. Most importantly, pretreatment processes require high costs, around 40% of the total processing, which can significantly affect the economical approach of biomass conversion towards value-added products [125]. Thus, a significant challenge of using lignocellulosic substances is to produce efficient biohydrogen with no need for further pretreatment to achieve the goal of sustainable green industrial scalable. Application of thermostable enzymes such as xylanases is one of the main interests among industrial applications for deconstruction of biomass such as lignocellulosic to convert into biofuel production [126]. These thermostable enzymes are able to survive at high temperatures, which offers several advantages such as their stability against denaturing conditions and extended reaction times [127]. Concerning maximum utilization of the biowaste, as well as maximum energy recovery, is equally vital. Liu et al. [128] reported that applying the second step of methanogenesis generates biohythane that is a combination of hydrogen (about 10–25%) and methane. Biohythane is considered as another important fuel source for future [26]. Abreu et al. [88] produced biohythane using garden waste (GW), containing 15% hydrogen. The authors stated that the maximum energy of 22 MJ kg−1VS can be recovered by this application. Moreover, authors concluded that fermentation of extremophilic bacteria, together with the methanogenic process, could be a promising strategy towards biohythane production, recovering energy from complex biomass sources."
8,Conclusion,"Biomass is considered as the largest source of energy in the word, accounting for 39% of the primary energy consumption in the developing countries. The increased interest in biological hydrogen production using various biomass indicates an exciting area of developed technology for hydrogen generation. In this review, the authors gathered information on the current status of biohydrogen production, hydrogen pathway, and its mechanisms using different species of thermotogales, which can help researchers and industrial stakeholders to effectively apply Themotogales sp to conversion of biomass to H2. The last few decades of research on thermophilic biohydrogen producers have given deep insights into their physiology and intricate metabolism. Hydrogen production by thermophilic fermentation has advantages over other methods. Among different thermotoga species, T. maritima and T. neopolitina serve further the hydrogen production as they can utilize different cellulosic substrates. This is due to different biochemical fermentative pathways that influence the biohydrogen production to the production of high H2 yield. Thermothoga maritima is a gram-negative bacterium with a special cell wall composed of lipo-polysaccharides; this special characteristic often avoids releasing the cellulosic enzymes in the waste biomass so that is can be degraded appropriately. On the other hand, hyperthermophile bacteria such as T. maritima possess thermostable enzymes that can effectively degrade biomass into valuable products such as biofuels. Cellulose-based biomass can be used as a resourceful renewable source for sustainable hydrogen production and the application of thermophilic bacteria could result in higher H2 production from cellulosic biomass. This review suggests that biological hydrogen production process is the best platform to achieve industrial-scale green development, and unfolding the central metabolic process of microbes during anaerobic fermentation is necessary as it outlines the pathways of hydrogen production and it makes it easier to understand the process involved. Significant improvements can be expected through the development of genetically engineered thermophilic fermentative microorganism, advanced bioreactor designing, etc., which ultimately succeeds the sustainable hydrogen production at a commercial level. However, the majority of the current challenges can only be overcome through intensive cross-disciplinary collaboration, which ensures essential synergies for the development of a commercial thermophilic H2 production process. And probably the economic feasibility outcomes may properly indicate that thermophilic biological H2 production best fits into a bio-refinery process."
