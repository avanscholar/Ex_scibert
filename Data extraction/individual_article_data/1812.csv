0,Introduction,"Technological civilization needs more and more energy, particularly in emerging and developing countries. Fossil resources, such as coal, natural gas and hydrocarbons, are the main primary sources, but their amount is limited and they will be exhausted in a few decades. Furthermore they are the main contribution to the emission of carbon dioxide mainly responsible for climate change. The development of clean power sources and the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases have led to many investigations on Low Temperature Fuel Cells, such as the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), fed either with pure hydrogen [1] or with other fuels, particularly low weight liquid organic compounds, such as formic acid [2,3], methanol [4] or ethanol [5]. However the electrocatalytic oxidation of these compounds in a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell (DOFC), such as the Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell (DFAFC) [2,3], the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) [4] or the Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell (DEFC), experiences overvoltages much larger than those encountered in a Hydrogen Fuel Cell [5]. This is due to the complexity of reactions mechanisms leading to electrical performances one order of magnitude smaller than those of the hydrogen/oxygen PEMFC (e.g. Pmax ≈ 0.35 W cm−2 for the DMFC and Pmax ≈ 0.1 W cm−2 for the DEFC vs. Pmax ≈ 1 to 2 W cm−2 for the H2/O2 PEMFC). Thus an alternative approach is to use molecular hydrogen as an energy source and energy carrier, which strongly limits the production of greenhouse gases, depending on the primary sources used for its fabrication. With renewable energy sources, such as nuclear power, hydroelectric power, wind, solar and tidal power, the production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is the most developed process, leading to high purity hydrogen, suitable to feed low temperature Fuel Cells [1]. But due to the high overvoltages encountered in water electrolysis, particularly at the catalytic anode, where oxygen evolution does occur, the production cost is actually not competitive with the main production processes (methane steam reforming, partial oxidation, auto thermal reforming) from natural gas and hydrocarbons [6]. This is because the energy needed to produce 1 kg of hydrogen is much greater than the theoretical energy (33 kWh kg−1 or 3 kWh/Nm3 under standard conditions), reaching more than 50 kWh kg−1 (corresponding to about 4.5 kWh/Nm3), i.e. an energy efficiency lower than 66%. Conversely, electrochemical reforming, consisting in the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrogen containing compounds at the anodic side of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (PEMEC), can produce very pure gaseous hydrogen by reducing, at the cathodic side, the protons which cross-over the membrane [7]. More importantly, this process can occur under mild experimental conditions, such as ambient temperature and pressure. This is a very promising approach, since the theoretical cell voltage (around a few tens mV) for the electrolysis of these compounds is lower than the theoretical cell voltage of water electrolysis (1.23 V under standard conditions). Several organic compounds can be considered as hydrogen sources, such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, sugars, etc., e.g. formic acid [8,9], methanol [10–12], ethanol [13,14], glycerol [15,16], and glucose [16]. Although the electrochemical decomposition reaction of these compounds displays a low cell voltage (under standard conditions), larger cell voltages are usually experienced under working conditions, due to the high anodic overvoltages encountered in their electrochemical oxidation. To overcome these difficulties, which appear both in a DOFC or in a PEMEC, a right choice of suitable anode electrocatalysts is essential, namely PdAu electrodes for formic acid electro-oxidation [9], PtRu based electrodes for methanol oxidation [17] or PtSn based electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation [5]. For methanol oxidation, PtRu electrocatalysts, with a Pt to Ru atomic ratio of 1 to 1, was claimed to be the best electrocatalysts at room temperature [18], but fundamental studies, carried out in our group, shown that an atomic ratio of 4 Pt to 1 Ru led to optimized results both in a three-electrode electrochemical cell –see Fig. 4 in Section 2.3– and in a elementary DMFC –see Fig. 10 in Section 3.2. Thus the right choice of suitable catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of these compounds, both in a DOFC or in a PEMEC, is based on a detailed study of the reaction mechanisms in relation with their electrocatalytic activity and their atomic structure. In the following review paper we will first present the basic principles of the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid and methanol in acidic medium, whose reaction mechanisms were thoroughly investigated by Andrzej Więckowski [19]. Then electricity production by their electro-oxidation in a DOFC [20] will be discussed, and finally hydrogen production by their electrochemical reforming will be presented [21]."
1,Principle of the electrocatalytic oxidation of oxygenated organic compounds,
2,Thermodynamics and kinetics of the electro-oxidation reaction,"2.1 Thermodynamics and kinetics of the electro-oxidation reaction A detailed knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrocatalytic oxidation of a given oxygenated organic compound, CxHyOz, is essential to consider both for its use as a fuel in a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell (DOFC), such as a PEMFC, or as a hydrogen source for clean hydrogen production in an electrolysis Cell, such as a PEMEC (Fig. 1 ). The complete electrocatalytic oxidation of an organic compound, CxHyOz, in the anodic compartment of an electrochemical device (fuel cell or electrolysis cell) working in acidic medium is performed with a suitable electrocatalyst, which is specific of the considered compound, leading to carbon dioxide and protons in a complete oxidation process, according to reaction (1): (1) C x H y O z + 2 x − z H 2 O → x CO 2 + n H + + e − anodic reaction with n = 4× + y - 2 z the number of exchanged electrons. In the cathodic compartment of the fuel cell oxygen is reduced to water, reaction (2a): (2a) O 2 + 4 H + + e − → 2 H 2 O cathodic reaction whereas in the cathodic compartment of the electrolysis cell the protons produced at the anode cross-over the proton exchange membrane, and are reduced to molecular hydrogen at a convenient catalyst by electrons arriving from the external circuit according to reaction (2b): (2b) n H + + e − → n / 2 H 2 cathodic reaction The electrical balance between reactions (1) and (2a) leads to the following overall reaction in a DOFC: (3a) C x H y O z + n / 4 O 2 → x CO 2 + y / 2 H 2 O overall reaction corresponding to the electrochemical combustion of the organic compound in the fuel cell. On the other hand the electrical balance between reactions (1) and (2b) leads to the following overall reaction in a PEMEC: (3b) C x H y O z + 2 x − z H 2 O → x CO 2 + n / 2 H 2 overall reaction Reaction (3b) corresponds to the electrochemical reforming of CxHyOz producing hydrogen and carbon dioxide by its complete oxidation in the electrolysis cell. Knowing the thermodynamic data associated with the enthalpy of formation ΔH i 0 and Gibbs free energy ΔG i 0 of the compounds involved (CxHyOz, H2O and CO2) one may calculate the enthalpy change and Gibbs energy change of reactions (3a) and (3b), as follows: (4a) ΔH FC 0 = x Δ H C O 2 0 + y / 2 Δ H H 2 O 0 − Δ H f 0 (5a) ΔG FC 0 = x Δ G C O 2 0 + y / 2 Δ G H 2 O 0 − Δ G f 0 for the fuel cell reaction (3a) and: (4b) ΔH EC 0 = x Δ H C O 2 0 − 2 x − z Δ H H 2 O 0 − Δ H f 0 (5b) ΔG EC 0 = x Δ G C O 2 0 − 2 x − z Δ G H 2 O 0 − Δ G f 0 for the electrolysis reaction (3b), where ΔH f 0andΔG f 0 are the enthalpy and Gibbs energy of formation of the organic compound CxHyOz under standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions (298.15 K and 1 bar). One may calculate the electromotive force (EMF) of the fuel cell, E FC , and the cell voltage of the electrolysis cell, U cell , together with the total (electric and thermal) energy needed, Δh, per mole of H2 produced by the electrochemical decomposition of the involved compound, as follows: (6a) E FC 0 = − ΔG FC 0 nF = − x Δ G C O 2 0 + y / 2 Δ G H 2 O 0 − Δ G f 0 / nF (6b) U cell 0 = + ΔG EC 0 nF = + x Δ G C O 2 0 − 2 x − z Δ G H 2 O 0 − Δ G f 0 / nF (6c) Δh 0 = ΔH EC 0 / n 2 The following relation between U cell and E FC may be derived as follows: U cell 0 = + ΔG EC 0 nF = + x Δ G C O 2 0 − 2 x − z Δ G H 2 O 0 − Δ G f 0 / nF = ΔG FC 0 nF − Δ G H 2 O 0 2 F i.e. (6d) U cell 0 = E H 2 FC 0 − E FC 0 The corresponding data for the electro-oxidation of hydrogen, formic acid and methanol under STP conditions, are given in Table 1 . This table shows clearly that for the organic compounds considered here the theoretical total energy Δh 0 necessary to produce one mole of hydrogen by their electrochemical dissociation under standard conditions is much lower than that for water electrolysis, e.g. close to 9 times lower for HCOOH and at least 6 times lower for CH3OH. Moreover, the theoretical electrical energy, which is proportional to the cell voltage - see Eq. (12) in Section 4 - is at least several times lower than that for water dissociation, or even negative, e.g. for HCOOH dissociation, which means that it is a spontaneous electrochemical process although the total energy ΔH EC 0 is positive due to a larger positive reversible heat transfer TΔS associated with the entropy change. However, the kinetics of the anodic reactions involved in both processes, i.e. water oxidation in the water electrolysis process or the electrocatalytic oxidation of the organic compound in the electrochemical reforming process, is relatively slow leading to high anodic overpotentials, and thus to higher cell voltages at the relatively high current density (over 1 A cm−2) required for a high production rate of hydrogen (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 gives the current density, j = I/S = nF v/S = nF vi, where I is the current intensity, S the electrode surface area, v and vi the reaction rate and the intrinsic rate, respectively, as a function of the electrode potential E i(j) vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) taken as reference, for the different electrochemical processes involved. When taking into account the charge transfer overpotentials η act, the concentration overpotentials η conc and the ohmic drop R e j associated with the cell resistance R e, the cell voltage vs. current density curves, U cell(j), of an elementary cell, can be expressed as follows: (7) U cell j = E a + j – E c − j + R e ∣ j ∣ = U cell 0 ± η a act j + η a conc j + η c act j + η c conc j + R e ∣ j ∣ where the “+”sign stands for the electrolysis cell and the “- ” sign for the fuel cell, respectively. In these equations U cell(0) = E eq is the equilibrium cell voltage i.e. the cell voltage at zero current, η i is the overpotential defined as the deviation of the electrode potential E i(j) under working conditions from its equilibrium value, i.e. η i = E i(j) - E ieq(0), and the subscripts “a” and “c” refer to the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. Thus U cell(j) can be express as follows: U cell(j) = U rev(0) ± η loss, where η loss = Σ|η i | + R e |j| and U rev(0) = E eq . Therefore the challenge to decrease the overvoltages, i.e. to increase the Electro-Motive Force (EMF) of the Fuel Cell E FC or to decrease the cell voltage U cell of the electrolyzer, is to develop new electrocatalysts able to activate the electrochemical reactions involved. These catalysts are specific of the electrochemical reactions and compounds involved. Thus a detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism is a key point to determine the rate determining step and to find suitable electrocatalysts able to increase the rate of this step. Many “ex situ” and “in situ” physical methods were developed for that purpose among them “in situ” radiochemical methods were early considered by Andrzej Więckowski [22] and later on NMR Spectroscopy [23] and NMR coupled to IR Reflectance Spectroscopy [24]."
3,Reaction mechanisms of the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid,"2.2 Reaction mechanisms of the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid The electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid, in acidic medium, has been thoroughly investigated both from a fundamental aspect [25] and for application either to the Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell (DFAFC) [2,3,26] or to hydrogen production by its electrochemical reforming [8,9]. The oxidation reaction mechanisms are very well known involving two parallel pathways for the electro-oxidation of formic acid into CO2 [25–30], both pathways leading to the exchange of 2 electrons per formic acid molecule. For example, with Pt-based catalysts the “direct pathway” (dehydrogenation reaction), gives CO2 directly without the formation of an adsorbed carbon monoxide species: (8) Pt + HCOOH → Pt + CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − whereas the “indirect pathway” (dehydration reaction) involves the intermediate formation of CO, which acts as a poisoning species of Pt-based electrocatalysts, but CO can be further oxidized to CO2 at higher potentials: (8a) Pt + HCOOH → Pt − CO + H 2 O (8b) Pt + H 2 O → Pt − OH + H + + e − (8c) Pt − CO + Pt − OH → 2 Pt + CO 2 + H + + e − where Pt represents a platinum catalytic site. Since the formation of OH species on Pt does occur from 0.6 V vs. the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE), the addition to Pt of a more oxidizable metal M (Ru, Mo, Mn, Sn, etc.) will enhance the rates of steps (8b) and (8c) at lower potentials, as follows: (8d) M + H 2 O → M − OH + H + + e − (8e) Pt − CO + M − OH → Pt + M + CO 2 + H + + e − Both reaction mechanisms correspond to the overall reaction: (8) Pt + HCOOH → Pt + CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − Similar mechanisms, particularly the direct pathway, were also observed on palladium-based catalysts [31,32], e. g. Lu et al. showed that the addition of palladium to platinum led to enhance the direct reaction pathway [31]. More recent studies have suggested that palladium and particularly palladium-based alloys have enhanced activity compared to platinum for the electro-oxidation reaction of formic acid due to the lesser formation of CO poisonous species [33–35]. In order to choose suitable anode catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid, cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a three-electrode cell with several Pd-based electrodes in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution containing 0.01 M HCOOH (Fig. 3 ). The presence of Pd in binary electrocatalysts allows to decrease or even to suppress the formation of CO poisoning species for pure Pd catalysts [33–35]. Thus the overvoltage of HCOOH oxidation is decreased so that the current-density curves are shifted negatively towards low electrode potential and the overall reaction proceeds mainly through the direct pathway – see Eq.(8). PdAu or PdPt alloys with a low content of Au or Pt (atomic ratios <20%) display a good electrocatalytic activity, in agreement with the results obtained at low overpotentials with a PtPd catalyst in a DFAFC as shown by Rice et al. [32], and with different PdAu catalysts in a classical electrochemical cell by Zhang et al. [36]. The voltammograms of Pd0.9Au0.1/C and Pd0.8Pt0.2/C catalysts display the forward and backward sweeps remarkably quasi-superimposed (Fig. 3). This indicates that these catalytic surfaces are less sensitive to poisoning by adsorbed CO species resulting from the dissociative chemisorption of formic acid (Eq.(8a)). The electrocatalytic behavior of Pd0.8Pt0.2/C is particularly interesting since the oxidation of formic acid begins at electrode potentials as low as 0.1 V vs. RHE, leading to a peak current density of 12 mA cm−2 at 0.28 V. Similarly the Pd0.9Au0.1/C catalyst gives maximum current densities of about 11 mA cm−2 at 0.32 V vs. RHE."
4,Reaction mechanisms of the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol,"2.3 Reaction mechanisms of the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol The mechanism of the electro-oxidation of methanol on platinum in acidic medium was thoroughly established, mainly after the identification of both reactive intermediates and poisoning species either by electrochemical methods [37–40] or spectroscopic methods [41,42]. The complete oxidation reaction in acid medium to reject the produced CO2 is: (9) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − In the first steps methanol is dissociatively adsorbed at Pt-based catalysts by cleavage of CH bonds leading to the so-called formyl-like species –(CHO)ads, according to the following steps: (9a) Pt + CH 3 OH → Pt − CH 3 OH ads → Pt − CHO ads + 3 H + + 3 e − From this species, different steps can occur, but with platinum, the dissociation of –(CHO)ads gives rapidly adsorbed CO, which is responsible for the electrode poisoning. This is the explanation of the rather poor performance of Pt catalysts, due to the relatively high potential necessary to remove such CO species by their electro-oxidation. The kinetics of the further desorption and oxidation of –(CHO)ads into the reaction products is the key point of the mechanism, leading to the complete oxidation of methanol. The usual path is the formation of COads: (9b) Pt − CHO ads → Pt − CO ads + H + + e − followed by its oxidation to CO2 – see Eq. (9h) below, which is the rate determining step. An alternative path to the spontaneous formation of the poisoning species (Eq. 9b), is the oxidation of -CHOads species, with OHads species coming from the dissociation of water according to the following reactions: (9c) Pt + H 2 O → Pt − OH ads + H + + e − (9d) Pt − CHO ads + Pt − OH ads → 2 Pt + CO 2 + 2 H + + 2e − One parallel surface reaction, leading to adsorbed formate, has also been observed: (9e) Pt − CHO ads + Pt − OH ads → Pt + Pt − COOH ads + H + + e − then leading by further oxidation to the formation of carbon dioxide: (9f) Pt − COOH ads → Pt + CO 2 + H + + e − On the other hand, adsorbed CO can be oxidized through the reactions: (9g) Pt − CO ads + Pt − OH ads ↔ Pt + Pt − COOH ads followed by reaction (9f), or through the following reaction: (9h) Pt − CO ads + Pt − OH ads → 2 Pt + CO 2 + H + + e − This mechanism takes into account the formation of all the products as detected by Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (EMIRS or FTIRS) [41–44], radiochemical method [45] and liquid or gas chromatography [46]: formaldehyde through step (9a), formic acid through steps (9e) or (9g) and CO2 through steps (9d), (9f) or (9h). Thus, the crucial point is to determine how the -(CHO)ads intermediate species can be oxidized to CO2 through various steps, as schematically summarized in Scheme 1 . This scheme shows clearly that desorption and oxidation of the formyl species can follow different pathways through competitive reactions. This scheme summarizes the main problems and challenges to improve the kinetics of the electro-oxidation of methanol. To lower the potential at which dissociation of water begins [47], a number of bimetallic and trimetallic Pt-based catalysts containing more easily oxidizable metals (Ru, Mo, Sn, Fe, Ni, etc.) have been investigated [48–50]. With PtRu catalysts, which are the best Pt-based catalysts for methanol oxidation [44,50–53], it appears clearly from the literature, and this was fully confirmed by IR reflectance spectroscopic studies, that the presence of adsorbed -(OH)ads on ruthenium sites at low potentials leads to the oxidation of adsorbed CO at potentials much lower than those encountered on pure platinum. It is also probable that the -(CHO)ads species can be oxidized directly to carbon dioxide, without the formation of adsorbed CO poisoning species – see Eq. (9d) [44]. At Pt1−x Ru x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) electrodes the following steps of methanol oxidation can be postulated (bifunctional mechanism [54]), as follows: • Activation of the methanol molecule by Pt: (9i) Pt + CH 3 OH → Pt − CH 3 O ads + H + + e − (9j) Pt − CH 3 O ads → Pt − CHO ads + 2 H + + 2 e − (9b) Pt − CHO ads → Pt − CO ads + H + + e − • Activation of the water molecule either by Pt or by Ru: (9c) Pt + H 2 O → Pt − OH ads + H + + e − (9k) Ru + H 2 O → Ru − OH ads + H + + e − • Surface reactions between the adsorbed species: (9d) Pt − CHO ads + Pt − OH ads → CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − + 2 Pt (9l) Pt − CHO ads + Ru − OH ads → CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − + Pt + Ru (9h) Pt − CO ads + Pt − OH ads → CO 2 + H + + e − + 2 Pt (9m) Pt − CO ads + Ru − OH ads → CO 2 + H + + e − + Pt + Ru The activity of several bimetallic PtRu electrocatalysts with different composition for methanol oxidation was recorded at room temperature as a function of the atomic composition (Fig. 4 ) [53]. Fig. 4 shows clearly that the best composition of PtRu electrocatalysts is Pt0.8Ru0.2 as confirmed by recording the electromotive force and the power density vs. current density of a DMFC using these electrocatalysts at the methanol anode (See Fig. 10 in Section 3.2). This can be interpreted by considering the number of Pt sites involved in the dissociative chemisorption of methanol leading to COads (4 sites) vs. the number of Ru sites to dissociate water into OHads (1 site) necessary to remove COads by its oxidation in CO2."
5,Electricity production in a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell,"The need for power sources with greater performance than lithium batteries has increased as a result of the rapid growth of the portable electronics market, particularly the Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell (DFAFC) and the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) [55,56]."
6,Direct formic acid fuel cell,"3.1 Direct formic acid fuel cell The DFAFC appears to be very attractive for providing higher power densities needs. With the advantages of high electromotive force, limited fuel crossover, and high practical power densities at low temperature, DFAFC are very promising power sources for portable electronics. The electrochemical reactions involved in a DFAFC are the following: (8) HCOOH → CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − anodic reaction with E 0 a = − 0.17 V vs . SHE (2a) ½ O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 O cathodic reaction with E 0 c = 1.23 V vs . SHE (3c) HCOOH + ½ O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O overall reaction with E 0 = E 0 c − E 0 a = 1.40 V Formic acid exhibits a smaller crossover through Nafion® membrane than methanol [57,58], allowing the use of highly concentrated fuel solutions and thinner membranes in DFAFCs. DFAFCs also have an electromotive force (EMF), as calculated from the Gibbs free energy change (see Table 1 in Section 2.1), which is higher than that of either hydrogen or direct methanol fuel cells. The theoretical energy efficiency under standard reversible conditions is given by: (10a) ε rev = ∆ G 0 ∆ H 0 = 270 254 = 1.063 ≈ 106 % which is higher than unity since the entropic heat (ΔQrev = TΔS > 0) is directly transferred to the cell. Under usual operating conditions at a cell voltage E(j) = 0.5 V, the energy efficiency will be come: εcell = εrev×εE = 1.063 × (0.5/1.4) = 0.379 ≈ 38%, where εE = E(j)/E0 = 0.5/1.4 = 0.357 is the voltage efficiency. The major disadvantage of formic acid as a fuel is its volumetric energy density, which is only 2.00 kWh (dm3)−1, i.e. much lower than that of methanol (6.1 kWh kg−1 or 4.82 kWh (dm3)−1. However, this disadvantage can be compensated by using higher concentrations of formic acid (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5A shows the effect of formic acid concentration on the cell polarization curves. There is a relatively small reactivity of 2 M formic acid solution. The cell activity increases with feed concentration until 15 M beyond which the entire cell polarization curve profile drops greatly. At fuel feed concentrations at and below 10 M, there is a mass transport limitation in the supply of formic acid to the anode, as seen by the limiting current at lower cell voltages. A key feature is the relatively high Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) of the cell, i.e. 0.72 V. Fig. 5B shows that the power density vs. current density plot goes through a maximum of 50 mW cm−2 at a concentration of around 12 M HCOOH. The effect of HCOOH concentration (between 1 and 22 M) on the current density at 0.4 V is plotted in Fig. 6 , showing a maximum current density of 120 mA cm−2 for 15 M. Fig. 7 : Cell voltage vs. current density curves on a per membrane surface area basis (A) and a per total catalyst weight basis (B) of a direct formic acid fuel cell with various Pd anode catalysts operating in dry air at 30 °C with 5 M HCOOH. After [33]. Figs. 7 (A and B) shows the performance of different Pd-based anode catalysts in a real fuel cell calculated on either a geometrical active surface area basis or on a Pd weight basis. The Sigma-Alrich Pd black gives the best overall performance, whereas the 20 wt% PdAu on carbon and the 40 wt% Pd on carbon display similar performance and the 20 wt% Pd/C performs slightly lower than the other two carbon-supported catalysts [33]. Fig. 8(A) and (B) give the corresponding power density vs. current density plots. The high surface area Sigma-Aldrich Pd black shows the highest maximum power density of 260 mW cm−2 and is able to provide this at the highest current density of all the catalysts on a geometrical active surface area basis. Fig. 8(B) shows that the 20 wt% PdAu catalyst is the most efficient with a power density of 135 mW mg−1 at the highest current density on a Pd catalyst weight basis. Palladium-based electrocatalysts have been confirmed to be the most efficient ones for the DFAFC since they prevent the formation of adsorbed CO poisonous species conversely to what encountered with Pt catalysts [56]."
7,Direct methanol fuel cell,"3.2 Direct methanol fuel cell The electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol has gained much interest over a number of years because it is the simplest alcohol which can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide in a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell [18,59,60], thus providing the maximum energy densities (6.09 kWh kg−1 or 4.82 kWh dm−3) by its complete electro-oxidation [46]. The great advantage of a DMFC is that methanol is a liquid fuel, thus more easily handled and stored than hydrogen. Methanol is produced in great quantity from natural gas (NG) by steam methane reforming (SMR) at a relatively low cost (~ 0.2 US$ l−1). The development of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) led to a great simplification of the fuel cell by developing a DOFC avoiding the use of a reformate gas with a low concentration of CO (< 10 ppm, otherwise it may strongly poison the platinum-based electrode catalysts used). Due to system simplicity, DMFCs are particularly efficient power sources for portable electronics (cell phones, laptop computers, cam recorders, etc.) and for small size applications (micro power sources, power sources for the soldier, propulsion of small devices, e.g. golf carts, drones, etc.). A DMFC consists of two electrodes, a catalytic methanol anode, and a catalytic oxygen cathode, separated by an ionic conductor, preferably an acid electrolyte, such as a PEM, for rejecting the carbon dioxide produced. Great progress was recently made by feeding methanol directly to the anodic compartment of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), in which the protonic membrane, e.g. Nafion®, plays both the role of an acidic electrolyte and of a separator between the two electrode compartments (Fig. 9 ). This technology has the added advantage of thin elementary cells and hence of compact stacks. The electrochemical oxidation of methanol occurs on the anode electrocatalyst (e.g. dispersed platinum-based catalysts), which constitutes the negative pole of the cell: (9) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − anodic reaction with E 0 a = 0.016 V vs . SHE whereas the electrochemical reduction of oxygen occurs at the cathode (also containing a platinum based catalyst) which constitutes the positive pole of the cell: (2a) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 O cathodic reaction with E 0 c = 1.23 V vs . SHE leading to the overall chemical reaction: (3d) CH 3 OH + 3 / 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O overall reaction with E 0 = E 0 c − E 0 a = 1.21 V The thermodynamic data and reaction mechanisms were previously discussed (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3) The main features of the DMFC are its high specific energy (Ws) and high volume energy density (Wel), the values of which are calculated as follows: (11) W s = − ∆ G 0 3600 x M = 702 x 10 3 3600 x 0.032 = 6.09 ≈ 6.1 kWhr kg − 1 and Wel = Ws×ρ = 4.82 kWhr dm−3, where M = 0.032 kg is the molar weight of methanol and ρ = 0.7914 kg dm−3 its density. Under standard reversible conditions (25 °C), the theoretical energy efficiency is very high: (10b) ε rev = W e − ∆ H 0 = nF E 0 − ∆ H 0 = ∆ G 0 ∆ H 0 = 702 726 = 96.7 % It is considerably higher than that of a H2/O2 fuel cell (i.e. 83%). However under usual operating conditions, at a current density j, the electrode potentials deviate from their equilibrium values due to large overpotentials, ηi, at both electrodes and an additional loss due to the cell resistance Re (arising mainly from the proton conducting membrane). Thus the energy efficiency will be decreased proportionally to the so-called voltage efficiency: ε E = E j / E 0 where E(j) is the cell voltage under working conditions. For a DMFC working at 200 mA cm−2 and 0.5 V (e.g. with a PtRu anode), this ratio will be: ε E = 0.5 / 1.21 = 41.3 % and the overall efficiency of the fuel cell will be: ε cell = ε rev × ε E = 0.967 × 0.413 ≈ 40 % assuming a Coulombic efficiency of 100%, i.e. the total combustion of methanol to CO2. The electrical characteristic of a DMFC depends strongly on the nature and structure of the anode catalysts. PtRu nanoparticle catalysts dispersed on an electron conductive substrate, such as a Vulcan XC-72R carbon powder, have been recognized to give the best results, because Ru is able to suppress poisoning effect on Pt by surface oxidation of the strongly adsorbed CO, as confirmed recently [61]. The bimetallic composition is particularly important and the optimum atomic composition was found to be 20% Ru vs. 80% Pt, i.e. an atomic ratio Pt:Ru close to 4:1, as illustrated in Fig. 10 [62]."
8,Hydrogen production by the electrochemical decomposition of low weight oxygenated organic compounds,
9,General considerations,"4.1 General considerations Instead of water several organic compounds, such as carboxylic acids, e.g. formic acid, or low weight alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, have been considered as convenient sources for the production of clean hydrogen by their electrocatalytic oxidation in a PEMEC. This is a very challenging approach since the cell voltage U cell(j)) under working conditions (e.g. j ≈ 1 A cm−2) is of the order of 0.5–1.0 V, which is much smaller than that of water electrolysis (1.6 to 2.0 V). Thus the electrical energy used will be at least 2 to 4 times smaller than that of water splitting according to the following relation giving the energy consumed to produce 1 Nm3 of hydrogen [63], which is directly proportional to U cell(j), according to Eq.(12): (12) W e in kWh / N m 3 = n ~ F 3600 V mol × 1 0 3 U cell j = 2.191 U cell j ≈ 2.2 U cell j where ñ = 2 is the number of Faraday per mole of hydrogen produced and Vmol = 24.465 10−3 m3 mol−1 is the molar volume of an ideal gas at a temperature of 25 °C under a pressure of 1 atm., i.e. 101.325 kPa (normal conditions for gaseous species). On the other hand, the rate of hydrogen produced can be evaluated by measuring the volume of evolved hydrogen, V H2, which is a linear function of electrolysis time Δt and current intensity I, i.e. of the quantity of electricity involved Δq = I Δt, as derived from the Faraday's law, giving the rate of hydrogen evolution [63]: (13) d V H2 / d t = V mol d N H2 / d t = V mol I / ñ F (13a) d V H2 / d t = V mol I / 2F x 60 = 7.607 I in cm 3 min − 1 where N H2 is the number of hydrogen mole, F = 96,485C per mole of electron is the Faraday constant and I is the current intensity. The quantity of hydrogen produced after a given electrolysis time (e.g. Δt = 15 min) at a given temperature, when a quasi-stationary state is reached, can be obtained by integration of Eq.(13), i.e.: (13b) V H2 = V mol I Δ t / 2F = 24.465 10 − 3 I 60 × 15 / 2 × 96 485 = 114.1 x I in cm 3 at 25 ° C (13c) or V H2 = 119.8 x I cm 3 at 40 ° C and V H2 = 131.3 x I cm 3 at 70 ° C taking into account the hydrogen molar volume at 40 °C or 70 °C (dilatation of an ideal gas). The energy efficiency ε cell of an electrolysis cell can be defined as the ratio between the theoretical amount of total energy W t (at j = 0) = ΔH EC required to decompose the organic compound CxHyOz with the production of (n/2 = 2× + y/2 - z) moles of hydrogen, according to the overall Eq.(3b), and the real amount of energy W r (at j ≠ 0) used [64], i.e.: (14) ε EC = W t j = 0 W r j ≠ 0 = Δ H EC j = 0 Δ H EC j ≠ 0 = Δ H EC j = 0 Δ H EC j = 0 + nF η loss with W r = ΔH EC + nFη loss where η loss = Σ|η i| + R e|I| = U cell - U rev represents the energy losses due to internal dissipation via the charge transfer overvoltages Σ|η i| and the ohmic drop R e I. First of all the oxidation of formic acid, which is easily catalytically decomposed into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, is presented as a convincing proof of concept. Then the example of methanol for its great industrial interest will be given since it is produced at a low cost from natural gas. Furthermore it can be completely decomposed into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, so that it is an excellent liquid storage of hydrogen."
10,Electrochemical decomposition of formic acid,"4.2 Electrochemical decomposition of formic acid For producing hydrogen by electrochemical reforming, formic acid is fed to the anodic compartment of a PEMEC, where its oxidation produces carbon dioxide and protons, i.e.: (8) HCOOH → CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − Then the protons cross-over the protonic membrane and reach the cathodic compartment, where they are reduced to hydrogen according to reaction (2b). This corresponds to the electrochemical reforming of formic acid into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, according to the overall reaction: (15) HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 This decomposition reaction need external energy (ΔH +0 > 0 - see Table 1 in Section 2.1), coming from the external electrical power source and of the surrounding heat, but in the case of formic acid the decomposition is spontaneous, since ΔG +0 < 0. The corresponding theoretical cell voltage, under standard conditions, can be calculated from ΔG +0 , i.e. U 0 cell = (ΔG +0 - ΔG -o )/2F = E a + − E c − ≈ E a + because E c 0 ≈ 0 for the cathode in contact with evolving hydrogen under atmospheric pressure, so that U 0 cell ≈ ΔG +0/2F = − 33 103 / 2F ≈ − 0.17 V. Thus assuming that some extra thermal energy is transferred from the surrounding (whose temperature can be controlled by a thermostat or a heat exchanger) to the electrolysis cell through the reversible heat transfer ΔQ rev = TΔS, the decomposition reaction of formic acid is a spontaneous process. However the relatively slow kinetics of the anodic reaction leads to high anodic overpotentials at high current densities (over 1 A cm−2) necessary for high hydrogen production rates, what corresponds to relatively high cell voltages and to high electrical energy consumption – see Eq. (12). In order to reduce the cell voltage to acceptable values (e.g. U cell < 0.9 V corresponding to an electrical energy used We < 1.0 kWh (Nm3)−1 – see Table 2 – , new electrocatalysts have been developed, such as Pt-based catalysts [32] or Pd-based catalysts which have been recognized to be very active for the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid [9,31,33–35]. In order to choose the most suitable anode catalysts for the electro-oxidation of formic acid, cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a three-electrode cell with several Pd-based electrodes in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution containing 0.01 M HCOOH (see Fig. 3 in Section 2.2). Therefore long-term electrolyses of formic acid were carried out at a constant controlled current intensity (0.2 to 1 A, e.g. a current density from 40 to 200 mA cm−2 for a 5 cm2 surface area electrolysis cell) with several Pd-based electrocatalysts (Pd0.8Au0.2/C, Pd0.9Au0.1/C and Pd0.8Pt0.2/C). The cell voltage, U cell at a fixed current intensity, was recorded as a function of time (Fig. 11a) for 5 M HCOOH and of the current density after 30 min electrolysis for the oxidation at 25 °C of (2 M, 5 M and 10 M) formic acid (Fig. 11b) In all experiments the measured volume of hydrogen is a linear function of time (Fig. 12 ) and of the current intensity I (Fig. 13 ), according to Eq. (13b). Fig. 13 summarizes all the results obtained with the 3 electrocatalysts (Pd0.8Au0.2/C, Pd0.9Au0.1/C and Pd0.8Pt0.2/C) investigated. This shows clearly that the volume of evolved hydrogen does not depend on HCOOH concentration, or on the nature of the electrode catalyst. The experimental results, V H2(30′) for 30 min electrolysis, are compared to the theoretical values calculated from the Faraday law –see Eq. (13b)–, showing a very good agreement in all experiments, but with experimental values slightly higher, which may come from the room temperature a little bit higher than 25 °C. This positive deviation in the measured volume of evolved hydrogen could also be due to resistive heating in the cell during long term electrolysis leading to an increase of the temperature of the exhaust gas [9]. For all experiments the electrical energy needed to produce one Nm3 of hydrogen was also evaluated, since it is only a function of the cell voltage U cell , according to Eq.(12). Table 2 summarizes the results obtained for a Pd0.8Au0.2/C catalyst at 25 °C with [HCOOH] = 5 M, giving the measured cell voltage, U cell, and the electrical energy needed, W e, both at the beginning of the electrolysis experiment and after 30 min electrolysis. In all the results obtained the amount of electrical energy is below 1.8 kWh (Nm3)−1 (for U cell < 0.8 V, i.e. I < 1 A), which is at least 2 to 3 times lower than the energy consumed in water electrolysis. The energy efficiency coefficient of an electrolysis cell fed with 5 M HCOOH at 25 °C working at I = 600 mA and at a cell voltage U cell = 0.384 V leading to an energy loss nFη loss = nF (U cell - U rev) = 2 × 96.485 (0.384-(−0.17)) = 106.9 kJ mole−1and a decomposition reaction enthalpy ΔH EC = 31.5 kJ (see Table 2) would be: ε EC = Δ H EC Δ H EC + nF η loss = 31.5 31.5 + 106.9 = 0.228 ≈ 23 %"
11,Electrochemical decomposition of methanol,"4.3 Electrochemical decomposition of methanol Most of the previous studies on the electrochemical decomposition of methanol concerned the production of pure hydrogen by electrolysis [10,11,65–67] focusing on the effect of MeOH concentration (1 to 18 M) and temperature (30 to 90 °C) on the rate of hydrogen evolution. None of these studies, except the work of Cloutier and Wilkinson [12] and that of Sapountzi et al. [68], by introducing a reference electrode in a dual-chamber electrolysis cell, did investigate the kinetics of methanol oxidation under electrolysis conditions. If most of these studies used a Nafion® 117 membrane, a PtRu anode and a Pt cathode to realize the Membrane-Electrode Assembly (MEA), they did not correlate clearly the hydrogen evolution rate with the current intensity flowing through the electrolysis cell as well as with the methanol concentration and cell temperature. The principle of the electrochemical decomposition of methanol in a PEMEC involves its electrocatalytic oxidation similarly to what occurs at the anode of a DMFC [17]. In the anodic compartment, i.e. the positive pole of the electrolysis cell, methanol is oxidized on the PtRu catalyst, producing carbon dioxide and protons, according to reaction (9): (9) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − anodic reaction Then the protons, after crossing-over the protonic membrane, reach the cathodic compartment, i.e. the negative pole of the electrolysis cell, where they are reduced to molecular hydrogen according to reaction (2b) – see Section 2.1: This corresponds to the overall electrochemical decomposition of methanol into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, according to reaction (16): (16) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 This reaction is similar to methanol steam reforming, but it can occur at room temperature instead of elevated temperatures (200 to 400 °C) for methanol reforming [69,70]. Before proceeding the electrochemical reforming of methanol it is important to know the behavior of PtRu catalysts which were recognized to be the most active electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation since the addition of Ru to Pt allows the removal of the poisoning intermediate by its oxidation at lower potentials (Section 2.3). This can be done by recording CO stripping voltammograms (Fig. 14 ) of both pristine CO and adsorbed CO from methanol decomposition [71]. Quasi-stationary polarization curves were recorded at a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1 and several temperatures (25 to 85 °C) in a PEMEC, consisting of a DMFC Hardware with a Pt/C negative electrode and a PtRu (1/1 atomic ratio)/C positive electrode of 5 cm2 surface area separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, fed with 1 M methanol added to the supporting electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4). These curves are shown in Fig. 15 for a cathodic limit of 0.2 V vs. RHE and an anodic limit of 0.8 V in order to prevent Ru dissolution from the PtRu anode. The general shape of these curves is similar to that of the voltammograms recorded in a three-electrode electrochemical cell for a PtRu dispersed electrode [53]. The electrolysis was performed in a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) hardware used as a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (PEMEC) [63]. The Pt/C hydrogen electrode of the DMFC served as a reference electrode, so that it was possible to analyze the kinetics of methanol oxidation at a catalytic Pt-Ru/C anode with the data extracted from the cell voltage vs. current intensity corrected from ohmic losses. Electrolyses of several methanol solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 10 M were carried out in the DMFC hardware at different temperatures from 25 °C to 85 °C and at several constant controlled current densities from j = 1 to 100 mA cm−2. In each case the cell voltage U cell and the volume of evolved hydrogen were recorded as a function of electrolysis time (t = 0 to 20 min). The steady state is usually reached after between 10 and 20 min of electrolysis. The polarization curves as a function of current density, U cell = f(j), taken when the steady state was reached after 20 min of electrolysis at a given current intensity I, are summarized in Fig. 16 for the different methanol concentrations and working temperatures. These curves are relatively independent of methanol concentration (except for 0.1 M which is not given in Fig. 16), at a given temperature, but the polarization curves depend greatly on the cell temperature for a given methanol concentration. These polarization curves are similar to those encountered in the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol on a PtRu electrode in a DMFC [50]. The hydrogen evolution rate was determined by measuring the volume of evolved hydrogen as a function of time at several current intensities (I = 1 to 500 mA) during the electrolysis of different concentrations of methanol (0.5 to 10 M). In all experiments the measured volume of hydrogen is a linear function of the electrolysis time Δt (Fig. 17(a)) and of the current intensity I (Fig. 17(b)), showing clearly that the volume of evolved hydrogen does not depend on the methanol concentration, nor on the cell temperature, nor on the nature of the anode catalyst, but only on the quantity of electricity involved, Δq = I Δt, as a linear function according to Eq.(13b). The 3 plots in Fig. 17(a), obtained at 50 mA are quite superimposed, in accordance with the Faraday's law. Tables 3 and 4 give the experimental volume of evolved hydrogen, the measured cell voltage U cell, the experimental cell resistance R exp, the cell voltage corrected from ohmic losses and the electrical energy W e needed to produce one Nm3 of hydrogen after 20 min. of electrolysis, according to Eq.(12), as a function of methanol concentration (Table 3) and of cell temperature (Table 4). As observed in Fig. 17(b) and in Tables 3 and 4, the volume of hydrogen evolved after 20 min of electrolysis only depends on the current intensity irrespective of methanol concentration, working temperature, cell voltage, and nature of the anode catalyst. But the electrical energy consumed depends greatly on the working temperature and on the nature of the anode catalyst, since it is related to the cell voltage, i.e. to the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. In all the results obtained the amount of electrical energy used to produce clean hydrogen by the electrochemical decomposition of methanol is below 1.2 kWh (Nm3)−1, since the corrected cell voltage is below 0.55 V, which is at least 3 to 4 times lower than the energy consumed for water electrolysis. As an example [63] the energy efficiency coefficient of an electrolysis cell fed with methanol at 70 °C working at I = 500 mA and at a corrected cell voltage U cell = 0.488 V leading to an energy loss nF η loss = nF (U cell - U rev) = 6 × 96.485 (0.488–0.016) = 273.2 kJ and for a decomposition reaction enthalpy ΔH EC = 129.5 kJ would be: ε EC = Δ H EC Δ H EC + nF η loss = 129.5 129.5 + 273 .2 = 0.321 ≈ 32 % This energy efficiency coefficient is about one half of that of a water electrolysis cell working at U cell = 1.9 V and at 70 °C, i.e. ε EC H 2 O = 1.19 1.9 ≈ 63 % ."
12,Conclusions,"The electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid and methanol has been the subject of many investigations since nearly fifty years both at the fundamental and application levels. These two compounds can be used either in a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell to produce electrical energy or in a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell to produce clean hydrogen by their electrochemical reforming. The knowledge of the reaction mechanisms of their oxidation on specific and suitable noble metal catalysts is a key-point since the anodic electrochemical reactions involved in both processes are exactly the same and are activated by the same specific electrocatalysts, e.g. Pdbased catalysts for formic acid and Pt-Ru based catalysts for methanol. The investigation of reaction mechanisms needs to use complementary physical methods such as electrochemical methods (voltammetry, chronoamperometry, etc.) coupled with physicochemical methods (radiochemical, in situ Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy) and analytical methods (on line gas or liquid chromatography). Then Direct Oxidation Fuel Cells are described presenting their advantages and drawbacks. DFAFC has a high theoretical open circuit voltage (OCV = 1.40 V) due to its negative standard potential (−0.17 V). With Pd-based catalysts the oxidation of formic acid undergoes the dehydrogenation process leading directly to CO2, thus avoiding the formation of adsorbed -CO intermediates which poison the catalytic sites. DMFC needs more sophisticated electrocatalysts due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism which involves breaking of the CH bond in the -CH3 moiety which may produce the irreversible formation of adsorbed -CO intermediate. Thus the oxidation of adsorbed –CO species needs Pt-based electrocatalysts containing more easily oxidizable metals, e.g. Ru which is particularly active. Both DOFC with optimized anode catalysts reach relatively good performances with power density at 0.5 V of the order of 200 mW cm−2 for the DFAFC and 350 mW cm−2 for the DMFC, but with similar energy efficiency of about 40%. These performances are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the hydrogen/oxygen PEMFC giving Pmax ≈ 1 to 2 W cm−2 and energy efficiency of around 60% at a cell voltage of 0.75 V. On the other hand, the feasibility of the production of clean hydrogen by the electrochemical reforming of formic acid and methanol in a PEMEC has been demonstrated with the following important features: a) the quantity of hydrogen produced only depends linearly on the quantity of electricity involved, Δq = I Δt, i.e. on the electrolysis time Δt and the current intensity I, irrespective of the nature of the organic compound, of its concentration, of the electrode potential, of the electrocatalyst nature and structure and of the working temperature. b) conversely the energy consumption W e, which is proportional to the cell voltage U cell(I), depends greatly on the nature of the organic compound and its electrochemical reactivity, on the nature, composition and structure of the electrocatalyst and on the working temperature (electrochemical and thermal activations). The following important points have been underlined: - the favourable thermodynamic characteristics of the electrochemical decomposition of formic acid and methanol give very low cell voltages under standard conditions, e.g. U 0 HCOOH = − 0.17 V and U 0 MeOH = 0.016 V, compared to that of water (U 0 H2O = 1.23 V) – see Table 1 in Section 2.1. - in most cases the electrochemical reforming of these organic compounds inside a PEM electrolyser occurs at cell voltages U cell < 1 V, i.e. with an electric energy W e < 2 kWh (Nm3H2)−1 lower than those of water electrolysis (1.5 V < U cell < 2 V, leading to W e ≈ 4 to 6 kWh (Nm3H2)−1), allowing to reduce greatly, at least by a factor of 2 to 4, the electrical energy consumed. - the energy efficiency, εEC, is of the order of 23% for formic acid and 32% for methanol, which is about one third to one half of that of water electrolysis (εEC ≈ 60 to 70%). - depending on the organic compound considered the nature, structure and composition of the electrocatalyst is of prime importance to reduce the overpotential of the oxidation reaction and thus to decrease the cell voltage under working conditions, e.g. Pd0.8Au0.2/C for formic acid and Pt0.8Ru0.2/C for methanol. - the development of more active and stable electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reforming of organic compounds is required to decrease further the anodic overpotential of the oxidation reaction. The best approach to meet this challenge is to acquire a detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism, particularly the identification of the rate determining step (rds), the rate of which must be increased through the development of new electrocatalysts. A final conclusion is that any organic compound will lead to similar results, since the rate of hydrogen evolution only depends on ñ = 2, the average number of Faradays per mole of hydrogen involved in the overall process. Thus the most interesting organic compounds will be those experiencing a lower cell voltage for their electrochemical decomposition and a high yield of hydrogen produced, which requires a right choice of the best efficient electrocatalyst leading to the lowest overpotential at the highest current intensity, i.e. a high activity, and to the most complete oxidation reaction to CO2 if possible, i.e. a high selectivity, under the working conditions of the electrolysis process."
