0,Introduction,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been being one of the most actively investigated materials in many fields due to their outstanding chemical and physical properties, since the first discovery by Iijima et al. in 1991 [1,2]. Many reliable techniques such as arc-discharge [3], laser evaporation [4], and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [5] have been employed to produce good-quality CNTs in large quantities. Recently, it was proposed that methane catalytic decomposition (MCD) might be the most efficient way for CNT synthesis because of advantages such as low cost, mild preparation conditions and easy control [6,7]. In particular, the most attractive merit of this process is that COx-free hydrogen is obtained without any additional purification steps, which is then suitable as the fuel for fuel cells. To obtain high methane decomposition rates at a relatively low temperature, the use of active catalysts is required [8]. Most of the active components in these catalysts applied for MCD are transition metals such as Ni, Fe and Co [8–10]. Among them, Ni is employed widely to promote the growth of the deposited CNTs during the MCD reaction, due to the outstanding catalytic activity and high CNT yield [8,11]. It was found that both the reaction and catalyst reduction conditions had major influences on the reaction behavior and on the morphology of the CNTs over alumina-supported nickel aerogel catalyst prepared by the sol–gel method [7]. Venugopal et al. [11] reported that the catalytic activity and lifetime of Ni/SiO2 catalysts strongly depended on Ni loading. It is known that the activity and the lifetime of Ni catalysts are also sensitive to the textural properties of their supports [12]. However, most of the past efforts are focused on the CNTs deposition through methane decomposition over powder catalysts. Growth of CNTs on three-dimensional (3D) substrates, such as foam and mesh, is still challenging [13]. Metal foams, as structured catalyst supports, have been well established in a number of important catalytic applications [14,15]. High porosity (low bulk density) of metal foams can minimize pressure drop and assure low heat capacity, providing a good resistance to the rapid transients and changes of operating conditions [15]. In addition, metals have high thermal conductivity, leading to a rapid heat transfer. Thus, the use of Ni foam offers interesting possibilities for simultaneous production of uniform nickel foam supported CNTs and COx-free hydrogen through the MCD reaction. The CNTs formation on the surface of Ni foam may cause potential problems such as structure collapse of Ni foam and increase of pressure drop [13]. Nevertheless, the Ni foam supported CNTs can be produced directly without the difficulties associated with high pressure drop and low thermal conductivity in the application of CNTs as catalyst support. The structural robustness of nickel foam supported CNTs composite and the pressure drop across catalyst bed also can be acceptable, as the amount of carbon deposition is not too much. In this study, Ni metal foam wash-coated with SiO2 was employed as the structural support for Ni catalysts in the MCD reaction. To obtain a uniform dispersion of active sites and alleviate the surface break-up of Ni foam, the active Ni for CNT growth was dispersed on the SiO2 transition layer. The preparation parameters including reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and Ni loading, on the catalytic properties and the morphologies of the as-prepared CNTs were investigated in detail. The aim was to optimize conditions for a simultaneous production of uniform nickel foam supported CNTs and COx-free hydrogen through MCD reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation In this study, nickel foams with 110 PPI (pores per inch) and porosity greater than 95%, purchased from Shenzhen Hanbo Co. Ltd.,were used. Prior to catalyst preparation, the Ni foams were cleaned with distilled water and alcohol. Ni foam supported Ni catalysts were synthesized according to the following procedure: (1) Ni foams (30 mm × 30 mm × 2 mm) were immersed into a SiO2 colloidal suspension which was prepared by refluxing a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate, alcohol and distilled water (volume ratio: 10:40:50); (2) the wash-coated foams were sufficiently dried at 100 °C followed by calcination at 450 °C for 1 h. The ratio of SiO2 (in weight) to Ni-foam (in volume) was approximately 0.018 g/cm3 by repeating the immersion–drying–calcination process; (3) the SiO2 wash-coated foams were impregnated with a solution of Ni(NO3)2 to achieve the desired Ni concentration, based on the amount of SiO2 coating. Unless otherwise specified, the Ni loading in the catalysts was fixed at 20 wt.%; (4) the catalysts were dried at 100 °C and then calcined at 400 °C for 2 h."
3,Catalytic performance testing,"2.2 Catalytic performance testing All MCD tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz tube reactor with dimensions of 30 mm × 400 mm × 2 mm (d × l × t) heated by an electric furnace. The Ni foam supported Ni catalyst of 300 mg was packed in the reactor. Prior to the CNTs growth process, the samples were reduced at 500 °C for 1 h at a H2 flow rate of 50 ml/min. After reduction, the reactor was purged with nitrogen, and then heated up to 650 °C. Subsequently, pure methane gas with 30 ml/min flow rate was introduced into the reactor and the reaction was maintained for about 10 h. The composition of the gaseous products out of the reactor was analyzed with an online HP 4890 gas chromatograph (GC). The growth rate of carbon was determined from the following equation by assuming that one CH4 molecule decompose into one C atom and two H2 molecules [11]. (1) Rate = F out (H2)/2 (mol/h) The amount of carbon produced during time on stream was therefore calculated by integrating Eq. (1) with respect to reaction time. F out (H2) (mol/h) is the production rate of H2 during the deposition-growth process of carbon."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh catalysts and used samples were acquired in a rotation anode X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Germany) equipped with a graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation. The working voltage and working current were kept at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The XRD patterns were recorded in a 2θ range of 10°–90° at a scan rate of 2°/min. The mean crystallite size, D, was calculated from the peak using the Scherrer formula: (2) D = 0.89λ/βcosθ where λ is the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation (0.154 nm), β is the peak width at half height of diffraction peak (2θ = 44.2°), θ is the Bragg angle. The morphologies of the catalysts and deposited CNTs were investigated by a 1530VP scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 20 kV operating voltage. TEM images were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai 12) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. To prepare the TEM sample, the Ni foam supported CNTs was first immersed into HNO3 (5 M) to separate CNTs from Ni foam. Then, several drops of the obtained suspension containing nanostructured carbons were ultrasound-dispersed in ethanol and then mounted on a Cu-grid supported carbon-film. Raman spectroscopy was performed in a wave number range of 100–3500 cm−1 using a LabRam HR with an Ar-ion laser at 532 nm."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the fresh Ni foam, the wash-coated Ni foam and the catalyst after Ni loading. Fig. 1a shows the typical porous structure of the Ni foam, where no impurity is observed on the surface. The Ni foam surface was completely covered by a uniform coating after the wash-coating with SiO2 colloidal suspension (Fig. 1b). After reduction at 500 °C, it was found that the Ni catalyst was almost uniformly dispersed on the SiO2 wash-coated Ni foam (Fig. 1c). The XRD patterns of the Ni foam supported Ni catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The reflections at 2θ = 44.2°, 51.7°, and 76.4°, are attributed to metallic nickel in the fresh catalyst [16], indicating that the Ni species was completely reduced to metallic Ni during the pretreatment of the catalyst. After reactions at 650 and 750 °C, the appearance of a weak reflection at 2θ = 26.7° suggests the formation of carbon in the MCD reaction [11]. The variation in the intensity of the graphite peak clearly reveals that the amount of carbon formed on the nickel foam increased, as reaction temperature increased [13,17]. It is clearly observed that the peaks of Ni catalyst became more intense at higher reaction temperatures. The sizes of Ni crystallites calculated from the peaks at 2θ = 44.2°of the XRD patterns by the Scherrer equation are presented in Table 1 . The average Ni crystallite size was about 23 nm for the fresh catalyst. However, the average Ni crystallite size increased significantly after 2 h reaction at all temperatures. In particular, the Ni crystallite size increased from 25 to 32 nm with increasing reaction temperature from 550 to 750 °C."
7,Methane catalytic decomposition on nickel foam supported Ni catalysts,"3.2 Methane catalytic decomposition on nickel foam supported Ni catalysts In the MCD reaction, the detailed process for the formation of carbon on Ni-based catalysts is generally described as a tip-growth mechanism [18–20], including the following steps: (1) the methane is broken down on the surface of active Ni phases of the catalyst through a gradual dehydrogenation process, producing carbon and hydrogen atoms; (2) some carbon atoms spread over the surface of Ni and move toward the metal–support interface, while some carbon atoms may dissolve into bulk Ni to form NixCy metastable solid solution as an intermediate which may decompose into Ni and C at the interface between the Ni catalyst and the support, where carbon atoms are combined to form nanotubes by a precipitation–nucleation–crystallization process; (3) as the reaction proceeds, more carbon atoms are released into the catalyst–support interface that allows carbon nanotubes to continuously grow, and leaves a Ni particle on the tip of the CNTs. In this mechanism, the CNT diameters are considered to be approximately the same as the size of the active Ni on the catalysts [11,21]. A dispersion of Ni with uniform size was observed in the prepared catalyst (Fig. 1c), which is the key for the synthesis of CNTs with a narrow size (diameter) distribution. 3.2.1 Influence of reaction temperature Experiments were carried out at three different reaction temperatures of 550, 650 and 750 °C on the Ni foam supported Ni catalyst, while the WHSV was maintained at 6 L g−1 cat h−1. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases was the highest at the beginning of the reaction, then gradually decreased and became stable finally. No obvious decrease of hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases is observed after 2 h reaction for all the samples. Compared with the results that the lifetime of Ni/SiO2 catalyst in fixed-bed is less than 5 h generally [11,22,23], the Ni foam supported Ni catalysts present a much higher catalytic stability. The formation rate of surface carbon is inherently much higher than the rate of carbon removal from the active surface in the MCD initial stage due to the clean exposed Ni surface in methane gas, resulting in the accumulation of surface carbons which could encapsulate the active site of the catalyst and therefore inhibited the further reaction between Ni particles and methane [19,23,24]. Therefore, the relatively rapid deactivation of catalytic activity during the first 120 min of reaction was observed. With increasing reaction temperature from 550 to 750 °C, the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases increased significantly during the total testing process. Fig. 3(b) presents the effect of reaction temperature on the yield of CNTs. At 550 °C, the yield is about 36 molC mol−1 Ni h−1. With increasing reaction temperature up to 750 °C, the yield increases dramatically to 86 molC mol−1 Ni h−1. Therefore, a significant increase in both hydrogen concentration and yield of CNTs was obtained with increasing reaction temperature from 550 to 750 °C. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the Ni foam supported CNTs produced after reactions at different operating conditions. The reaction temperature significantly influenced the morphologies and sizes of the CNTs (Fig. 4(a–c)). At a low reaction temperature (550 °C), the foam surface is covered with a relatively uniform layer of CNTs. The length is very short, which indicates that the growth rate of CNTs was very low. With increasing reaction temperature up to 650 °C, the CNT length increased significantly. The CNTs with much greater lengths were produced at 750 °C. The diameter distribution statistics, based on careful measurement of CNTs from their sufficiently enlarged SEM images (Fig. 4), is shown in Fig. 5 . The relatively uniform characters in diameter are shown for the CNTs prepared at 550 and 650 °C, respectively. The diameter of CNTs increased from 24 to 28 nm with increasing reaction temperature from 550 to 650 °C. At 750 °C, the CNT diameter distribution broadens abruptly. The CNTs with diameters ranging from 15 to 50 nm were obtained. This clearly indicates that the diameter distribution of CNTs gets wider with increasing growth temperature. It is well known that methane decomposition is an endothermic process which favors high temperature reaction [11]. Increasing reaction temperature would result in a significant increase in both hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases and yield of CNTs. The CNT length also increased with increasing reaction temperature, because of a higher CNT growth rate at higher reaction temperature [25]. The fine Ni crystallites supersaturated with carbon partially melted and coalesced in a quasi-liquid state, and then agglomerated to form larger Ni crystallites in the MCD process [23,26]. As shown in Table 1, the average crystallite size of Ni catalysts increases with increasing reaction temperature from 550 to 750 °C, due to the coarsening of Ni crystallites. Larger Ni crystallites were generated in the catalyst used at higher temperature. Therefore, the diameter of the as-formed CNTs became larger, as reaction temperature increased. Chen et al. [27] reported that the Ni particles in a quasi-liquid state were easily broken into many finer particles at a high reaction temperature. This may be the reason why a broad diameter distribution was shown for the CNTs produced at 750 °C. In the case of the catalyst with 20 wt% Ni loading, the CNTs with relative uniform diameter were formed at relatively low reaction temperatures (550 and 650 °C). Therefore, in order to produce the CNTs with narrow diameter distribution and acceptable hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases simultaneously, 650 °C was considered to be an optimum reaction temperature. 3.2.2 Influence of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) Fig. 6 shows the influences of weight hourly space velocity on (a) hydrogen concentration and (b) CNT yield, at 650 °C, over Ni foam supported Ni catalysts. At a low WHSV of 1 L g−1 cat h−1, the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases was about 9.2 vol%. With increasing WHSV to 12 L g−1 cat h−1, the hydrogen concentration decreased to about 1.0%. A longer residence of methane on the catalyst surface is beneficial to enhance the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases [6]. However, the CNT yield increases relatively slowly with increasing WHSV (Fig. 6(b)). The CNT yield increases from 52 to 63 molC mol−1 Ni h−1 with increasing space velocity from 1 to 12 L g−1 cat h−1. The space velocity has a greater effect on hydrogen concentration than on the yield of CNTs. As WHSV decreases, the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases, which is a measure of hydrogen partial pressure along the catalyst bed, increases greatly. Hydrogen partial pressure plays an important role in the production of CNTs from metal catalysts and their morphologies [28,29]. For the formation of CNTs, a high supersaturation is required for carbon atoms to nucleate. At lower hydrogen partial pressure, the so-called carbon affinity is higher, suggesting that more CNTs nucleated [20]. The CNT yield increases with decreasing hydrogen partial pressure. Thus, more CNTs were synthesized at higher space velocities. On the other hand, H2 might serve to keep the exposed Ni particle surface on the tip of the CNTs through the gasification of encapsulated carbon, which enhanced the growth process of CNTs [18,19]. CNTs with larger lengths were formed at a lower space velocity of 1 L g−1 cat h−1 (Fig. 4b) compared with 6 L g−1 cat h−1 (Fig. 4d). However, there are no significant differences in the diameters of the CNTs processed at these two different space velocities (Fig. 5(b and d)), because the diameter of the as-formed CNTs only depended on the particle size of the active Ni catalyst. Therefore, a weight hourly space velocity of 1 L g−1 cat h−1 is proposed in order to achieve a higher hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases. 3.2.3 Influence of Ni loading Fig. 7 shows the influence of Ni loading on (a) hydrogen concentration and (b) CNT yield over the Ni catalysts supported by nickel foam, at 650 °C with a WHSV of 1 L g−1 cat h−1. The catalytic performance of the Ni catalysts supported by Ni foam for methane decomposition strongly depends on Ni loading, which is also discussed in previous reports [11,30]. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases increases significantly as Ni loading increases from 10 to 50 wt%. The maximum initial hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases over the catalyst with 50 wt% Ni loading is about 29.5%. However, a rapid decrease in the yield of CNTs with an increase of Ni loading is observed, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The CNT yields are about 60 and 46 molC mol−1 Ni h−1, respectively, for the catalysts with 10 and 20 wt % Ni loadings. As Ni loading increases to 35 wt %, the CNT yield decreases to 26 molC mol−1 Ni h−1. The lowest CNT yield (about 19 molC mol−1 Ni h−1) is exhibited for the catalyst with 50 wt % Ni loading. Therefore, a compromise and balance between hydrogen concentration and CNT yield has to be considered when adjusting Ni loading. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the SEM images and diameter distributions of the CNTs after 2 h reaction at 650 °C using the Ni catalysts with different Ni loadings, respectively. The morphologies of CNTs are affected significantly by Ni loading. It was found that the CNT lengths increase significantly with increasing Ni loading. The as-formed CNTs exhibit a very uniform range of diameters for the samples with 10 and 20 wt % Ni loadings. The diameter increased from 22 to 28 nm with increasing Ni content from 10 to 20 wt %. However, with increasing Ni loading up to 35 wt %, the diameter of CNTs became larger with a relatively broad diameter distribution ranging from 20 to 46 nm. The broadest diameter distribution ranging from 20 to 65 nm is shown at 50 wt% Ni loading. These results suggest that the diameter of the as-prepared CNTs increased, and their diameter distribution became broader, as Ni loading increased. When Ni loading increased, the reaction rate increased, due to an increase in the available active Ni sites [28]. As a result, the hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases increased undoubtedly with increasing Ni loading. However, the increase of hydrogen partial pressure along the catalyst bed resulted in a rapid decrease of CNT yield. The CNT lengths increased significantly with increasing Ni loading, because the growth process of CNTs was enhanced at higher hydrogen partial pressure. The agglomeration of the Ni particles saturated with carbon was likely promoted with increasing Ni content in the catalysts [26]. The average particle size of Ni would be expected to be larger, under the same operating conditions, for the catalyst with a higher Ni content. Hence, the diameter of the prepared CNTs increases with increasing Ni loading. The appearance of some CNTs with smaller diameter can be ascribed to the cracking of the larger Ni particles in a quasi-liquid state. As justified in our study, the CNTs with a broad diameter distribution were formed in the catalysts with higher Ni content. For the catalyst with 20 wt% Ni loading, relatively uniform CNTs were obtained with acceptable levels of hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases. By optimizing experimental parameters, in summary, our results suggest that nickel foam supported CNTs with relatively uniform size (diameter) and high hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases can be obtained simultaneously by using the catalyst with 20 wt% Ni content at a reaction temperature of 650 °C and a WHSV of 1 L g−1 cat h−1. The as-formed CNTs under these conditions were further investigated to understand their structural characteristics by using TEM and Raman spectroscopy."
8,Structural characterization of CNTs,"3.3 Structural characterization of CNTs Fig. 10 shows a TEM image of this sample. The typical morphologies of CNTs are observed [31]. The outer diameters of CNTs are about 26–30 nm, which is well consistent with the SEM result (Fig. 5). Three types of CNTs were observed at least: (a) CNTs with Ni particle on tip; (b) CNTs with open end but without Ni particle on tip; (c). CNTs with closed end but without Ni particle on tip. Fig. 11 shows the Raman analysis of the as-formed CNTs, two peaks at 1577 and 1347 cm−1 are observed. The former is attributed to the tangential C–C stretching mode (G band) of carbon material with a sp2 orbital structure, while the latter, to the amorphous mode (D band) [6,32]. The I G/I D ratio can be used to assess the degree of graphitization (amorphization) of the CNTs [13]. The I G/I D ratio of peak areas was calculated to be 0.58 by using Lorentzian profiles as the simplest fits, which suggests that the CNTs exhibit a high degree of amorphization under the applied synthetic conditions. Generally, CNTs can be divided into 3 categories (Single-wall CNTs, Double-wall CNTs and Multi-wall CNTs). The characteristic peaks corresponding to the radial breathing modes (RBMs) of single-wall CNTs and/or double-wall CNTs at wave-numbers below 400 cm−1 were not observed in the spectrum [6,25,33], indicating that in our study the multi-wall CNTs (MCNTs) were obtained."
9,Conclusions,"This study has demonstrated the use of Ni catalysts supported on nickel foam for catalytic decomposition of methane (MCD) to co-produce hydrogen and nickel foam supported CNTs. All the prepared catalysts presented a high catalytic stability under experimental conditions. Uniformly dispersed Ni catalysts supported on SiO2 wash-coated Ni foams were synthesized, which is the key to the production of CNTs with a narrow diameter distribution. The MCD performance and the morphologies of the as-prepared CNTs were affected by reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity and Ni loading. High reaction temperature, low WHSV, and high Ni loading resulted in a high hydrogen concentration in the outlet gases. The diameter of the CNTs formed at 650 °C was relatively uniform, for the catalysts with Ni loading less than 20 wt %. However, the diameter distribution of the prepared CNTs broaden with increasing reaction temperature and Ni loading, due to the agglomeration and cracking of Ni particles, which might be easily broken into finer particles with different sizes during the MCD reaction. No significant differences in the CNT diameters were observed by changing WHSV. To produce uniform nickel foam supported CNTs and high concentrations of hydrogen, the catalyst with 20 wt% Ni content is recommended under optimized operating temperature of 650 °C and WHSV of 1 L g−1 cat h−1. TEM and Raman analysis indicates that the as-formed CNTs are multi-wall CNTs (MCNTs) with a high degree of amorphization, composed of three types at least."
