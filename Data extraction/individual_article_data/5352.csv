0,Introduction,"Agarwood is an aromatic-resin-filled wood that is widely used as a digestive, sedative, and anti-emetic in traditional Chinese medicines, and as incense and perfume in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Japan. It is derived from the stems, branches, and roots of Aquilaria spp. trees upon mechanically injury, chemical induction, or fungal infection (Okudera and Ito, 2009; Kumeta and Ito, 2010). In the natural environment, agarwood formation occurs slowly and the yield is low. The immense value and rarity of agarwood have led to indiscriminate cutting of trees and overharvesting, resulting in the depletion of forest resources (Soehartono et al., 2000). In recent years, Aquilaria trees have been widely planted in Southeast Asia to conserve the natural populations and increase agarwood supply. Aquilaria sinensis (Lour) Gilg is the sole legal plant resource for agarwood production in China (Uddin et al., 2008; Persoon et al., 2008). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of agarwood formation is crucial for improving agarwood-inducing technology and agarwood quality. Sesquiterpenes, secondary metabolites with antimicrobial and anti-disease activities, are one of the major components of agarwood (Chen et al., 2011). Sesquiterpene content has typically been regarded as an important criterion for the evaluation of agarwood quality (Ishihara et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2012). Studies have shown that accumulation of agarwood sesquiterpenes occurs in healthy A. sinensis trees subjected to injury and is mediated by multiple signal molecules, such as H2O2, JA, and SA (Kumeta and Ito, 2010; Xu et al., 2016). Therefore, elucidating the signal transduction mechanisms of agarwood sesquiterpenes and cross-talk between wound signaling pathways will provide new insights into the complex and dynamic processes underlying wound-induced agarwood sesquiterpene biosynthesis. H2O2, a primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, plays an integral role in the regulation of numerous biological processes such as growth, development, and responses to biotic and/or abiotic stimuli in plants (Apel et al., 2004; Mittler et al., 2004). In response to wound stress, H2O2 is not only used directly as an antimicrobial agent but also as a signaling molecule for inducing the formation of secondary metabolites. It has been confirmed that H2O2 can induce capsidiol biosynthesis in tobacco (Perrone et al., 2003), phenolic accumulation in carrots (Jacobo-Velázquez et al., 2011), and β-coumaroyloctopamine synthesis in potato tubers (Matsuda et al., 2001). In addition to H2O2, other signaling molecule such as SA, JA, and ET are also recognized as key players in the regulation of plant defense responses against various abiotic and biotic stimuli (Fujita et al., 2006; Van der Fits et al., 2000). ET has been reported to mediate wound responses and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Cucurbita, carrot, and tomato (Watanabe et al., 2001; O’Donnell et al., 1996; Song et al., 2006). JA and SA have been considered as alternatives to treatments for mechanical wounding, as they induce terpene biosynthesis in several plants. For instance, MeJA was able to markedly induce the expression of sesquiterpene synthase 3 (TPS3) and the release of more than 10 sesquiterpenes in rice (Cheng et al., 2007). Exogenous JA treatments can promote the expression of enzymes involved in the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway, consequently leading to increased artemisinin accumulation in A. annua (Maes et al., 2011). Similarly, exogenous application of JA or SA has been shown to activate parthenolide biosynthesis in Tanacetum parthenium (Majdi et al., 2015). Recent studies have confirmed that H2O2, JA, and SA are produced in response to wound stress, and the application of exogenous H2O2, JA and SA can induce agarwood sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. sinensis (Zhang et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2014b; Xu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015). However, the underlying cross-talk mechanisms modulating the wound response remain unknown. In A. sinensis, the sensing of wound stress initiates several complex signaling pathways. Some external factors activate secondary signaling molecules such as Ca+, H2O2, and inositol phosphate as well as the activation of kinase cascades. Previous studies have indicated that wound stress, including that from mechanical injury, chemical induction, or insect infestation, can induce H2O2 and, JA and SA accumulation, thereby promoting sesquiterpene biosynthesis (Xu et al., 2016). To determine the underlying mechanism of the H2O2 signaling pathway, the concentrations of JA, SA, and ET, as well as the gene expression levels of the related synthases were measured after application of H2O2 and AsA in wounded stems. The results indicated that H2O2 burst parallels ET signaling activation and further triggers JA and SA accumulation during which it mediates sesquiterpene synthases gene transcription and agarwood sesquiterpene biosynthesis. This process is an important molecular regulative mechanism of agarwood formation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant material and treatments,"2.1 Plant material and treatments Three-year-old A. sinensis saplings were grown in Yanfeng County, Haikou City, Hainan Province, China, and identified by Prof. Jian-He Wei. The saplings were approximately 1.5 m in height and grew well. The diameter of lateral stems selected was 1.2 ± 0.2 cm. The treatment of exogenous H2O2 and AsA was performed referring to Zhang et al. (2014a, 2014b). On a sunny day, the stems were cut with scissors and the one-cm-long stems at the apical end of the cut stems were directly immersed in 1 mM H2O2 and 0.1 mM AsA, respectively. The H2O2 and AsA were absorbed into the stem’s xylem cells by transpiration pull. After 2 h, the pretreated stems were exposed in air with discarding H2O2 and AsA solution, or with distilled water for the control condition. Two-cm-long samples were collected from the apical end of each treated stem, and one-cm-long stems at the apical end of the cut stem immersed in liquid were discarded. Samples were rapidly immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for experiments."
3,Determination of H2O2 content in stem extracts,"2.2 Determination of H2O2 content in stem extracts H2O2 from stems was extracted and measured according to a previously described method (Zhang et al., 2014b). H2O2 Assay Kit was purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). The experiments were carried out according the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, the samples were ground in lysis buffer and centrifuged to obtain the supernatants. Test tubes containing 50 μl of supernatants and 100 μl of test solutions were placed at 30 °C for 30 min and measured immediately with a universal microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go, Thermo) at a wavelength of 560 nm. Absorbance values were calibrated to a standard curve generated with known concentrations of H2O2."
4,Extraction and measurement of phytohormones,"2.3 Extraction and measurement of phytohormones Crude phytohormones were extracted by ultrasonic technology. The stems with different treatments were ground into a fine powder with liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extract buffer. JA was extracted in 80% methyl alcohol containing 1% PVPP. After ultrasound in ice for 30 min, the extracts were kept overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, dried by vacuum freeze drier (Minivac Beta, Gene Company Limited), and dissolved in 50 ul sample diluents of Elisa Detection Kit (Ruiqi biology, Shanghai China). The powder used to extract SA and ET was homogenized in 90% methyl alcohol and diethyl ether, respectively. Then, the extracts were ultrasonically extracted for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was also dried and dissolved in 50 ul sample diluents. The measurement of JA, SA, and ET was conducted using Elisa Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. JA, SA, and ET in the samples were determined by double antibody sandwich method. Briefly, purified antibodies were coated with microporous plates to form solid-phase antibodies. When JA, SA, and ET were added to the microporous plate, they assembled with HRP-labeled antibodies to form the antibody complex of antigen-enzyme-labeled antibodies. After washing, the substrate TMB was added. Catalyzed by HRP enzyme, TMB was transformed into blue, and the mixture gradually turned yellow under the action of acid. The color depth was positively correlated with JA, SA, and ET content in samples. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a universal microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go, Thermo). The absorbance of pure JA, SA, and ET acted as the standard to calculate sample concentrations (Tanaka et al., 1979; Deng et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016). All experiments were repeated three times, such that there were three independent repetitions of each biological experiment."
5,Real-time quantitative RT–PCR expression analysis,"2.4 Real-time quantitative RT–PCR expression analysis Total RNA was isolated from three-year-old A. sinensis stems using EASYspin Plus Plant RNA Rapid Extraction Kit (Beijing, China) with an on-column DNA digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using TransScript One step gDNA remove and c-DNA synthesis Supermix kit (Transgene, China). RT–PCR was performed on Bio-Rad IQ-5 Real-Time System. A fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) gene was amplified as an internal control (Gao et al., 2012). Amplification of the target genes was monitored during every cycle via SYBR-green ﬂuorescence. Relative quantitation of each target gene expression level was performed using the comparative Ct method (Livak et al., 2001). All experiments were repeated three times, such that there were three independent repetitions of each biological experiment. The primers used are listed in Table 1 ."
6,Detection of sesquiterpene components,"2.5 Detection of sesquiterpene components Frozen samples were ground to powder in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle. Then, 0.5 g powder was accurately weighed and homogenized in 5 ml diethyl ether. After ultrasonic extraction in ice for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. Precipitation was resuspended in diethyl ether, and was ultrasonic extracted by two times. The supernatants collected from three extractions were merged and dried under nitrogen, then dissolved in 1 mL diethyl ether. The crude extracts were filtered through 0.45-um membrane for further analysis. GC–MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 A equipped with a HP-5MS 5% Phenyl Silox capillary column (internal diameter, 30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm), and a Varian 300 mass spectrometer with an ion-trap detector in full-scan mode under election impact ionization (70 eV). The injections were performed in splitless mode at 240 °C and column temperature was initially held at 60 °C for 2 min, then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 4 °C min−1. The carrier gas was helium, and the ﬂow rate was 1 mL/min. Identifications of sesquiterpene compounds were based on an inhouse library of reference mass spectra built up from standard compounds and agarwood of known composition (Chen et al., 2011)."
7,Results,
8,The burst of H2O2 in wounded A. sinensis,"3.1 The burst of H2O2 in wounded A. sinensis H2O2 acts as an important post-wounding signal to induce sesquiterpene accumulation in A. sinensis (Zhang et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). To investigate the involvement of H2O2 signaling transduction, the stems of actively growing saplings of A. sinensis were pruned. The concentration of H2O2 in wounded stems pre-treated with distilled water, H2O2, or AsA was measured after air exposure. H2O2 concentration began to increase at 0.5 h and reached the first peak at 1 h. Subsequently, it decreased to initial level and elevated again after 2 h. At 6 h, H2O2 production raised up to the second peak which was 34 times higher than the initial concentration. After 24 h of exposure to air, the H2O2 concentration declined to its lowest level, where it remained with a slight diurnal oscillation throughout the remaining measurement time, but there were no changes in the healthy stems (Fig. 1 ). Endogenous H2O2 concentrations were obviously increased by application of absorbed H2O2, and maintained a higher level even after 12 h, while inhibited by exogenous AsA (Fig. 1). These results demonstrated that mechanical injury led the burst of endogenous H2O2 rapidly showing two oscillations, and exogenous H2O2 application further caused the accumulation of endogenous H2O2."
9,H2O2 upregulates sesquiterpene synthase expression to promote sesquiterpene biosynthesis in wounded A. sinensis,"3.2 H2O2 upregulates sesquiterpene synthase expression to promote sesquiterpene biosynthesis in wounded A. sinensis The GC–MS detected volatiles emitted from treated A. sinensis stems. It was revealed that the volatiles of treated stems contained various sesquiterpenes, whereas these were not detected in healthy stems (no data). The peak areas indicated relative contents in wounded samples, with distilled-water-pretreated samples weighing 2.7145, and 9.3099 in the H2O2-pretreated samples, increased more than three-fold. In the AsA-pretreated samples, the value was 1.2572, decreasing more than two-fold (Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). These data clearly demonstrated that H2O2 could promote sesquiterpene production significantly, which was inhibited by AsA. It is implied that H2O2 is an important signaling molecule during wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Sesquiterpene synthase is the important catalytic enzyme for sesquiterpene biosynthesis (Nagegowda et al., 2010). To investigate the mechanism by which H2O2 induces sesquiterpene production, the expression of AsTPS10, AsTPS16, and AsTPS19, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene in the early stage of response to wound stress (Lv et al., 2017), was measured in healthy, distilled-water-, H2O2- and AsA-pretreated wound stems. It was showed that expression levels of AsTPS10, AsTPS16, and AsTPS19 were elevated to 295-, 368-, and 67-fold in samples after wound treatments compared with healthy samples, respectively. Treatment with H2O2 increase expression of AsTPS10, AsTPS16, and AsTPS19, and the relative expression levels increased by 649-, 847-, and 202-fold respectively. In addition, the application of AsA could inhibit the expression of AsTPS10, AsTPS16, and AsTPS19, the relative expression levels were 152, 116, and 35, respectively, which were inferior to those in wounded samples (Fig. 3 A–C). These results indicated that the presence of H2O2 favored the expression of AsTPS10, AsTPS16, and AsTPS19 at early stages of the wounded stress response. Combined with the data of sesquiterpene biosynthesis, H2O2 appears to be an indispensable signaling molecule that induces sesquiterpene synthase transcript to catalyze the formation of sesquiterpene."
10,H2O2 induces the production of JA and SA in the process of wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis,"3.3 H2O2 induces the production of JA and SA in the process of wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis Some signaling molecules such as JA and SA have been reported to mediate stress responses in plants, and they can be activated by H2O2 (O’Donnell et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 2001). To further explore how H2O2 transmits signaling and promotes sesquiterpene biosynthesis, we focused on the phytohormones that mediate the wound stress response and measured the concentration of JA and SA in healthy, distilled-water-, H2O2-, and AsA-pretreated wound samples. In A. sinensis, JA and SA concentration significantly increased in response to wound stress (Fig. 4 A–B). Compared with distilled-water-pretreated wound stems, the concentration of JA and SA were elevated in wound samples of exogenous H2O2 application. Meanwhile, the lower JA and SA contents were detected in exogenous AsA-pretreated wound samples (Fig. 4A–B), which suggested that the presence of H2O2 could up-regulate JA and SA concentrations to promote sesquiterpene biosynthesis in wounded A. sinensis. The related synthases of phytohormones are the most immediate catalytic action for phytohormone biosynthesis in plants, and the catalytic activity is always associated with gene expression levels. To investigate how H2O2 modulates the JA and SA biosynthesis, the transcript levels of AsLOX, AsAOC, and AsAOS, which are the main enzymes regulating JA synthesis (Xu et al., 2016), were determined by qRT-PCR. Consistent with JA concentration, AsLOX, AsAOC, and AsAOS expression levels were evidently up-regulated in wound-treated stems. The use of H2O2 generated a significant effect on the relative expression of AsLOX, AsAOC, and AsAOS, and the relative expression levels were inhibited by AsA (Fig. 4C–E). These indicated a positive regulation of H2O2 over AsLOX, AsAOC, and AsAOS to promote JA biosynthesis. Isochorismate synthase (ICS) has a primordial role in the regulation of SA synthesis (Wildermuth et al., 2001). Analysis of AsICS expression levels revealed that AsICS obviously responded to wound induction, which would be elevated in the presencet of H2O2 and be reduced in the absence of H2O2 quenched by AsA (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the expression levels of JA and SA related synthase are similar to JA and SA concentreation, as shown in Fig. 4A–B, suggesting that H2O2 accumulation in wounded A. sinensis activates AsLOX, AsAOC, AsAOS, and AsICS gene expression to promote JA and SA accumulation."
11,"H2O2 has no effect on concentration of ET, an important signaling hormone in the response to wound stress in A. sinensis","3.4 H2O2 has no effect on concentration of ET, an important signaling hormone in the response to wound stress in A. sinensis Similar to JA and SA, ET is an important signaling hormone that induces secondary metabolites biosynthesis under abiotic stress (O’Donnell et al., 1996; Xia et al., 2015; Steffens, 2014). To further determine signaling networks of H2O2 regulating sesquiterpene biosynthesis, ET acting as a stress signal was measured in treated samples. In A. sinensis, wound stress could cause ET production to increase, rising to levels twice as high as those of healthy samples. Furthermore, the measurement of ET contents in wound samples by pretreatment of H2O2 or AsA found that ET contents barely change compared with those in distilled-water-pretreated samples (Fig. 5 A), which suggested that accumulated H2O2 had no effect on ET concentrations, though ET responds to wound stress in A.sinensis. To further verify the above conclusion, we subjected wounded stems to distilled-water, H2O2-, and AsA-treatment to evaluate the expression levels of genes involved in the ET biosynthesis, including 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synethetase (AsACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (AsACO) (Keunen et al., 2016). Based on the results obtained, expression of AsACS and AsACO increased after wound treatment, with expression levels increasing 35- and 8-fold, respectively. Similar to the results of ET production, AsACS and AsACO gene expression levels were not affected by elevated or reduced H2O2 (Fig. 5B, C). These results further imply that ET signaling responded to wound stress at early stages of wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis but is independent of H2O2 signaling."
12,H2O2 and ET production may occur simultaneously before JA and SA accumulation as two parallel pathways,"3.5 H2O2 and ET production may occur simultaneously before JA and SA accumulation as two parallel pathways It has been confirmed that H2O2 plays an important role in inducing JA and SA accumulation but has no effects on ET signaling during wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. sinensis. To further investigate the relationship of stress signaling molecules, the concentrations of H2O2, ET, JA, and SA were measured and compared with each other in the early stages of wound induction. As shown in Fig. 6 , production of H2O2 and ET began to increase in 0.5 h after pruning, while JA and SA maintained the initial concentration. Subsequently, H2O2 concentration increased, reaching its first peak at 1 h, and ET production reached its maximum at 2 h whereas the JA and SA concentration both began to elevate at 1 h and reached their peak at 6 h. JA and SA responded to wound induction later than H2O2 and ET, suggesting that H2O2 and ET production occurred simultaneously in response to wound stress, before JA and SA function."
13,Discussion,"A. sinensis is a scarce resource in China for agarwood production due to mechanical injury, chemical wounds, or fungal infection. When A. sinensis trees are wounded by external stimuli, system signaling is activated, which in turn regulates the defense response to promote the synthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes and chromones. As an important signaling molecule, H2O2 is involved in plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and/or abiotic stress (Mittler et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2015), especially in the induction of secondary metabolite biosynthesis to enhance plant resistance (Perrone et al., 2003; Jacobo-Velázquez et al., 2011; Matsuda et al., 2001). In this study, we found that H2O2 levels rapidly increased when A. sinensis was injured by pruning (Fig. 1), and the elevated H2O2 upregulated the production of agarwood sesquiterpenes (Fig. 2, Table 2). Correspondingly, the gene expression levels of three main sesquiterpene synthases were upregulated by elevated H2O2, and inhibited by reduced H2O2, in wounded A. sinensis trees (Fig. 3A–C). These results are identical to those from previous studies, suggesting that H2O2 plays a crucial role in inducing sesquiterpene production in wounded A. sinensis trees (Zhang et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2014b; Xu et al., 2016). However, the molecular mechanism of H2O2 regulation in agarwood production remains unclear. Plants use various signaling mechanisms derived from hormonal regulations to combat stress. Phytohormones, such as JA, SA, and ET have been reported to regulate the protective responses against abiotic stress via different pathways of H2O2-induced signaling (Saxena et al., 2016). JA is a key signaling molecule for inducing secondary metabolite biosynthesis against external stimuli (Cheng et al., 2007; Maes et al., 2011). Previous studies have reported that JA is a crucial signal transducer that mediates transcription factor AsMYC2 to induce AsASS1 expression, thereby promoting sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. sinensis (Xu et al., 2016, 2017). The present study provides evidence that accumulation of H2O2 during the early phase of wound responses is important in the upregulation of JA biosynthesis and transcription of JA-related synthases (Fig. 4A, C–E), which agrees with the mechanism of H2O2-activated JA signaling in wounded tomato (Song et al., 2006). Taken together, these results demonstrate that H2O2 induces JA accumulation to promote sesquiterpene production, thus, elucidating the role of H2O2 in the regulation process. SA acts as an indispensable signaling molecule involved in multiple physiological processes (Mou et al., 2003). Numerous studies have confirmed that SA regulates the redox balance and protects plants from oxidative damage (Larkindale and Knight, 2002; Scott et al., 2004). In A. sinensis, mechanical injury triggers H2O2 burst in cells, which may disrupt the redox balance, resulting in cell death. SA may sense the H2O2 level, and is rapidly mobilized for signal delivery. Congruent with our hypothesis, the SA concentration was found to be increased in the signaling pathway of H2O2-regulated wound-induced sesquiterpene formation (Fig. 4B). Correspondingly, the expression levels of the primary gene involved in SA biosynthesis (AsICS), was up-regulated in wounded A. sinensis trees, which was further enhanced by exogenous H2O2 application and reduced by AsA treatment (Fig. 4F). These results confirmed that SA was activated by accumulated H2O2 for modulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis. However, the interaction between H2O2 and SA is complex (Han et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2007). Elucidating the mechanism of interaction between H2O2 and SA during wound-induced sesquiterpene formation requires further research. ET has been shown to mediate the wound-induced synthesis of plant secondary metabolites in plants such as tomato and Cucurbita (O’Donnell et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 2001). Congruent with this, we found that ET acts as a vital signaling molecule, and its levels were elevated rapidly when A. sinensis was wounded (Fig. 5A). Previous studies have confirmed that H2O2 mediates a variety of ET-induced responses in plants (Desikan et al., 2006). However, the increased or decreased levels of H2O2 had no effects on the ET concentrations in the course of wound-induced sesquiterpene synthesis (Fig. 5A–C). This suggests that H2O2 and ET are involved in parallel signaling pathways in response to mechanical injury. In fact, it has been shown that when wounding occurs in carrots, H2O2 and ET production occurs simultaneously, and accumulation of ET could work in conjunction with JA, preventing an excessive accumulation of H2O2 (Jacobo-Velázquez et al., 2011; Song et al., 2006). Thereby, the regulatory relationship between H2O2 and ET in wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis may be similar to the one observed in carrots. Furthermore, we compared trends of change in H2O2, JA, SA, and ET concentrations during the early stages of wound induction (Fig. 6). The results provide strong evidence for the hypothesis, as the increase in H2O2 and ET synthesis preceded that of SA and JA generation, suggesting that H2O2 and ET were the parallel and immediate response signals, involved in the subsequent activation JA and SA. As studies have shown previously, high concentrations of H2O2 lead to toxicity and even lethality in cells (Mittler et al., 2004). The regulatory mechanism mediated by JA, SA, and ET may act in combination with antioxidant enzymes to prevent the excessive accumulation of H2O2 during the defense response. The detailed cross-talk among H2O2, JA, SA, and ET that regulates the wound response in plants has been rarely reported, as it is a complicated mechanism that requires further research."
14,Conclusion,"This investigation suggests that sesquiterpene production is dependent on the elevated levels of H2O2. Thus, the experiments herein have identified H2O2 as a crucial signal transducer to activate JA and SA production, which further induces sesquiterpene biosynthesis. ET, an important wound response signal, is activated at the same time as H2O2 and prior to JA and SA (Fig. 7 ). The information provides a new understanding of signaling regulation networks of wound-induced agarwood production, and information generated in this investigation opens the possibility of envisaging strategies to manipulate the production of agarwood with a wide range of applications."
