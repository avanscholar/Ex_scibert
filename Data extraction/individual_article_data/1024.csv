0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is recognized as the fuel in the near future which can substitute the exploitation of non-renewable energy resources [1,2]. Clean and abundant solar energy to H2 using photocatalytic water splitting is considered a promising environment benign pathway that can undertake serious energy-related issues. The need for self-disinfected and self-cleaned hygienic surfaces and safe water is also of cardinal importance in this epoch of rapid industrialization and urbanization. All these are well addressed by semiconductor photocatalysts, of which titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising candidate and is extensively investigated for green H2 production and environmental remediation [3–5]. However efficiency of a semiconductor-based photocatalytic process depends on a number of factors including crystal structure, morphology, exposed facets, band gap, crystal defects, efficient charge separation and utilisation [6]. Morphology engineering leading to selective exposure of high and low energy facets in TiO2 is an effective strategy to enhance the photoactivity and recombination time in semiconductor nanomaterials [7]. The difference in surface energies between different facets of TiO2 spatially attracts and separates photogenerated exciton pairs. It is demonstrated theoretically that surface energies γ for {001}, {010}/{100} and {101} facets of anatase TiO2 are 0.90 J/m2, 0.53 J/m2 and 0.44 J/m2, respectively [8,9]. This difference in surface energy is due to the variation in band structures and band edges of different facets, as high energy facets are always ended up with high energy 5-coordinated Ti atoms [10]. On excitation the photogenerated holes gets attracted to high energy facets, while electrons to low energy facets, leading to spatial separation of charge carriers at the surface heterojunction of TiO2. This further facilitates the oxidation-reduction half cycles to occur locally and simultaneously at the two surfaces. The separation of photogenerated exciton pairs, their migration and spatially separated enrichment at the photocatalyst surface is often challenging to utilise them both in photocatalytic self-cleaning and H2 production. Photogenerated holes are more favourable for a material to exhibit superhydrophilic self-cleaning property. Holes, when migrated to the surface, can react with the surface oxygen atoms of TiO2 forming oxygen vacancies, concurrently the hydroxyl radicals formed by the oxidation pathway of photocatalysis can bond to these vacancies thereby increasing the affinity of photocatalyst's surface to water [11,12]. Whereas electron enrichment at the surface of TiO2 favours photocatalytic water spitting by the reduction of aqueous H+ ions through reductive half cycle to form H2 [13,14]. In order to achieve enhanced solar-driven H2 production and self-cleaning property, engineering of band gap and improved visible light absorption are crucial. Hence, to address these limitations in TiO2, various strategies such as doping [14–16] and self-doping [17], defect engineering [18], heterojunction formation [19–22], dye sensitization [23],etc. Are adopted. Amongst them, developing heterojunctions from multiple semiconductor components are promising, mainly because of its high stability in harsh environments, easy processability and reusability. The hybridization of two-dimensional materials such as Graphene with semiconductors is considered as an ideal method to integrate the essential attributes of both the components. Graphene exhibits high thermal conductivity (5,000 W/m/K), high mobility of charge carriers (2,00,000 cm2/V/s), high surface area (>2,600 m2/g) and electrical conductivity [24,25]. Besides, graphene oxide (graphene precursor in wet chemical approach) contains profound but tunable oxygen containing functional groups which can act as supporting pillars to nanoparticles during the synthesis of hybrid system [26]. An electron transfer pathway can be established between graphene and TiO2 which can greatly reduce recombination in the semiconductor thereby enhancing photoresponsivity [27]. Also, the greater surface area of graphene enhances more active sites in the hybrid system. Hybrids of P25 nanoparticles with GO and rGO for H2 production are already reported. Fang et al. reported the synthesis of P25-rGO (20%) composite using methanol (20% v/v) as a sacrificial agent [28].In another study, similar composite was studied using 0.5 wt% Pt and 25% methanol (v/v) as cocatalysts and sacrificial agent respectively [29]. Similarly, Zhang et al. reported the use of 0.1 M Na2S and 0.04 M Na2SO3 for H2 production experiment and found 2 wt% graphene loaded TiO2 composite as the optimum material [30].In an attempt of self doping Ti3+ on TiO2-graphene hybrid, the H2 evolution efficiency of the samples was evaluated using Pt as a co-catalyst. The results showed significant enhancement (almost twice) compared to the control P25 samples [31]. Herein, we report a morphology dependent spatial separation of charge carriers in TiO2 and its graphene hybrids synthesised by a simple tailor-made hydrothermal modified sol-gel method. TiO2/graphene hybrids were synthesised at different weight percentages of GO (graphene oxide) where TiO2 is in situ grown with the simultaneous reduction of GO to rGO (reduced graphene oxide sheets). The hybrid samples were studied for its photocatalytic H2 generation, photodegradation both in UV and visible light, and photoinduced superhydrophilicity. The spatial charge separation of photogenerated electron-hole pair in TiO2 is achieved by exposed crystal facets with different surface potentials. Fabrication of high energy {010}/{100} and {001} facets of TiO2 favoured self-cleaning behaviour to the hybrid samples, while optimum percentage of high energy facets with low energy {101} facet favoured H2 production. Further it is demonstrated that just with 0.1% w/w of graphene loading resulted in excellent enhancement of photoactivity in the hybrid samples, through the establishment of chemical linkage between {010} facet of TiO2 and graphene layers."

2,Synthesis of TiO2 and TiO2/rGO hybrids,"2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 and TiO2/rGO hybrids A hydrothermal modified sol-gel method is adopted for the synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystalsand its graphene hybrids. Typically, Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was added to a solution of Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) under N2 atmosphere [32]. Using glacial acetic acid (AA), the pH of the solution is maintained at 3. Precipitation of TiO2 starts when de-ionized water is added after 1 h. After 24 h continuous stirring, the solution was transferred to a 200 mL stainless steel autoclave with Teflon lining and was kept at 180 °C for 12 h. The molar ratios of TTIP/CTAB/IPA/AA/H2O of Pristine TiO2 turn to be 1/0.5/7.4/0.63/22. For TiO2/rGO hybrids, GO was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of TTIP, and the same synthesis procedure stated above is adopted. GO was initially synthesised by modified Hummers’ method using KMnO4 and Conc. H2SO4 as the oxidizing agents and used after acid washing. GO was added at different weight percentages (0.05w/w, 0.1w/w and 0.3w/w) in relative to the TiO2 grown in situ. The hybrids are named accordingly as 0.05%GT, 0.1%GT, and 0.3%GT. The synthesis of Pristine TiO2 and its 0.1 wt% hybrid with GO was altered with reducing the molar proportion of water by half (molar ratio of TTIP/CTAB/IPA/AA/H2O changes to 1/0.5/7.4/0.63/11) and is named respectively as TiO2(0.5) and 0.1%GT (0.5)."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations To understand the morphology and structure of these samples prepared, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) (JOEL JEM-2100) studies were carried out at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. Crystallographic phase, purity and size of the synthesised samples are studied by PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (0.154028 nm) at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in 2θ ranging from 5° to 80°. The elemental composition of the samples was studied by XPS from the changes of C1s, O1s and Ti2p binding energies, using a PHI 5,000 Versaprobe Scanning Esca Micropore with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. A PerkinElmer Lambda 365 double beam UV–Vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere is used to obtain solid-state UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) at room temperature in air over the range 200–800 nm. Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired from a confocal micro-PL/Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Lab RAM HR) at 514 nm and 340 nm excitations, respectively. The lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers in the samples were determined from Time-resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) curves using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. A 340 nm laser source was used to excite the samples and the decay transients were observed at 420 nm using Horiba Yvon single photon counting system. Avatar 370 spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, U.S.) was used to record FTIR spectra. Elemental composition and chemical nature of samples were studied from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using PHI 5,000 VersaProbe II, USA. Survey scan is undergone with an X-ray source of pass energy of 187.8 eV and power 50 W, while core level spectra of Ti2p, O1s and C1s were recorded using 46.95 eV pass energy. The electrical properties were determined by Hall Effect measurements using van der Pauw sample configuration and under a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T. Photoinduced superhydrophilic properties of the samples (1 mg/mL of sample in 2-propanol is spin coated on glass substrate for 9 layers) were determined from a contact angle goniometer (Rame Hart 590) by finding its water contact angle (WCA) in dark and after 15 min UV irradiation at 365 nm. Transmittance spectra of the spin coated samples were obtained from PerkinElmer Lambda 365 UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer."
4,Photoconductivity measurements,"2.3 Photoconductivity measurements Solid-state photoconductivity measurements of the samples were done for the samples coated on FTO plates (1 × 1 cm2). The schematic of the device structure adopted is shown as Fig. S1 of Supplementary Information. Prior to sample coating, an FTO plate is isolated using a non-conducting gap introduced by controlled Zn/HCl etching. As-synthesised samples (5 mg) dispersed in isopropanol (1 mL) was spin coated over the isolated FTO plate. A two-electrode system was employed to connect the FTO substrate to a nanovoltmeter (Keithley nanovoltmeter 2,400 SMU) which applies a constant bias of 2 V and simultaneously measures current against time. The photocurrent measurements were carried out under solar light illumination with consecutive light on-off cycles, which directly reflect the photoconductivity measurements of the samples in solid-state."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation The photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were performed in a stainless-steel batch reactor of volume 230 mL with a quartz window on the top of the reactor. The reactor is designed with an inlet to feed reactants and nitrogen gas, while an outlet was used to collect the liquid and gaseous samples at various reaction time intervals. The reactor was endowed with simulated solar light irradiation using an ozone free Xenon lamp (Power input: 300 W). The H2 generation study was conducted using a constant catalyst concentration of 0.5 g/L and using glycerol as a sacrificial agent (10% v/v). For every run, 115 mL of double distilled water was used with constant catalyst dosage with calculated sacrificial agent. The resulting suspension has been fed into the batch reactor under constant magnetic stirring. The hydrogen generated after each run was measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent) equipped with Thermal conductivity detector (TCD), Flame ionization detector (FID) using argon as a carrier gas and Carboxen 1000 packed column."
6,Results and discussion,"Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals and its hybrids with different weight percentages of graphene were synthesised by a hydrothermal modified sol-gel method driven at low temperature. CTAB acts as the capping agent to TiO2 during its crystal growth. Hence the crystalline features, morphology, exposed percentage of high and low energy crystal facets is highly determined according to the relative concentration of CTAB with that of TiO2 precursor and solvent [32]. Moreover, in order to tune the wettability of TiO2, excess amount of H2O is also introduced to this tailor-made synthesis protocol to gamer the hydrophilic behaviour. GO is fed to the reaction medium prior to the addition of TiO2 precursor and acts as the nucleating centres for TiO2 which is later reduced to rGO (graphene) during the hydrothermal treatment. Photoinduced wettability is the important criterion for a semiconductor to be of superhydrophilic self-cleaning material. Synthesised TiO2 nanocrystals and its graphene hybrids displayed interesting superhydrophilic behaviour under light illumination. Glass substrates coated with Pristine TiO2 and its hybrids were both hydrophilic in nature and were superhydrophilic within a very short time span of UV irradiation (See Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 of supporting information). Water contact angle measurements were < 5° for every TiO2/rGO hybrids within 15 min of UV irradiation, especially for 0.1%GT as it attained extreme photo-wettability with WCA of ~ 0° within 10 min irradiation and with repeatability. Superior wettability of the hybrids is due to morphology and facet dependent effective charge separation in TiO2 on photoexcitation, efficient charge transport to the active sites with the support of graphene sheets and finally utilisation of these charge carriers in superhydrophilic photocatalytic mechanisms. Furthermore, the fabricated films showed transparency of greater than 90% in the visible region (Fig. S3) ensuring the potential of the material to find application as transparent self-cleaning coatings. The as-synthesised samples were first analyzed for its crystalline phase and purity by XRD (Fig. 2 ). The diffractions of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) planes of anatase TiO2 is being characterized by the peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.1°, 53.8°, 55.1°, and 62.7°, respectively (ICDD card no. 83–2243). These peaks are well pronounced in XRD patterns of every hybrid confirming the anatase phase of TiO2. From the characteristic (001) reflection of GO at 2θ = 10.4°, the interlayer distance calculated is ~0.84 nm, which has increased from 0.34 nm calculated in graphite (2θ = 26°). This suggests that by Hummer's method, most of the graphite is oxidized by the introduction of oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxide [33] (affirmed from FTIR spectra of GO, Fig. S4). In the hybrids, (001) reflection of GO has disappeared from 10.4°, instead is shielded with (101) reflection of TiO2 at 25.3°. All these interpret that hydrothermal treatment reduces GO in situ to rGO, with simultaneous in situ growth of TiO2 nanocrystals. Fig. S5shows the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2/rGO hybrids and Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals. All samples showed typical intense absorption in the UV region of the spectra (with an absorbance peak at ca. 330 nm and an absorption edge near 400 nm) corresponding to the phonon-assisted indirect transition in TiO2 [34]. Alternatively, TiO2/rGO hybrids show visible light absorption (>400 nm). Similarly, as the amount of graphene incorporated in the hybrid increases, the absorption in the visible region also increases, while that of Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals remains deprived. Bandgaps (Eg) of the samples were determined from the x-intercept of the tangent extrapolated from the linear regime of Kubelka-Munk transformed diffuse reflectance spectra. It is observed that Eg of all hybrids gets reduced, relative to pristine TiO2. This is because of the incorporation of graphene, which results in the introduction of intermediate energy levels within the bandgap of TiO2. To study the local structure of TiO2 and TiO2/rGO hybrids, the samples were investigated using Raman spectra (Fig. 3 ). The four characteristic bands identified at 145 cm−1 (Eg), 398 cm−1 (B1g), 517 cm−1 (A1g), and 640 cm−1 (E1g) are congruous with the anatase phase of TiO2 [35,36]. In addition, two typical bands centred at 1,350 cm−1 and 1,585 cm−1 are present in all hybrids relating to D band (disorder band) and G band (tangential vibration band) of graphene, attributing its successful incorporation into the hybrids [37,38]. Degree of disorder or relative concentration of sp3 hybridized defects with that of sp2 hybridized graphene domains can be identified from the intensity ratios between D and G bands (I D /I G ). The defect density in hydrothermally synthesised TiO2/rGO hybrids is found to increase, as I D /I G ratio increase from 1.2 in GO to 1.4 in 0.1%GT, 1.8 in 0.05% GT and 1.9 in 0.3% GT. As the GO is reduced to rGO during the hydrothermal treatment to re-establish its sp2 domains, the defects are increased slightly, mainly due to the formation of chemical linkage between TiO2 and graphene layers [39]. The oxygen containing functional groups of GO had itself acted as the nucleation sites for the growth of TiO2 [40]. Furthermore, D band of graphene is noticeably shifted in hybrids which is due to the localized tensile strains induced in graphene by the TiO2 in contact [41]. The efficiency of a photocatalyst is highly determined by its competence in the separation of photogenerated exciton pairs and their migration to active sites of reaction, in relative to electron-hole recombination at the surface and in the bulk of the catalyst. The efficient charge separation in TiO2/rGO hybrids is supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectra shown in Fig. 4 a. PL of Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals shows broad and direct band-band emission with a peak centred at ~540 nm which corresponds to the reverse deactivation of photogenerated charge carriers on recombination. The addition of graphene to TiO2 results in a significant quenching of the PL intensity. The π–π stacking of the graphene sheets acts as a great electron transfer pathway for the excited electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, thereby favouring separation of photogenerated charge carriers [26]. Particularly, greater the percentage of graphene in the hybrid, greater is the recombination dampened. As from PL quenching, 0.3%GT is expected to have high photoactivity than 0.1%GT. Consequently, in order to further understand the interfacial charge transfer dynamics in the hybrids, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) obtained from TCSPC technique is deployed. TRPL decay curves (Fig. 4b) obtained on dispersing samples in water and excited by 340 nm laser pulse and emission was monitored at 420 nm. Each TRPL curve is fitted using a tri-exponential function (Equation (1)), (1) t = y 0 + A 1 exp ( − t τ 1 ) + A 2 exp ( − t τ 2 ) + A 3 exp ( − t τ 3 ) where, τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 are the lifetimes, y 0 is the baseline correction, and A 1 , A 2 , A 3 are the pre-exponential factors. This indicates the contribution of three lifetime components to the charge carrier dynamics of the synthesised samples. The average lifetime ‹τ› is calculated from Equation (2). (2) ⟨ τ ⟩ = ∑ i = 1 n A i τ i 2 A i τ i The fitting parameters and average lifetime for the samples are shown in Table 1 . The average lifetime ⟨ τ ⟩ in Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals is 2.8 ns and is lower than any of hybrids. ⟨ τ ⟩ of 0.05%GT, 0.1%GT and 0.3%GT respectively are 3.6 ns, 6.3 ns and 5.6 ns This reveals that 0.1%GT is having high interfacial carrier dynamics than relative to other variants, and thus will have superior photoactivity. Graphene oxide in 0.1% w/w might have anchored well with in situ - growing TiO2 nanocrystals in 0.1%GT. Thus, the photoexcited electrons on carried over from the conduction band of TiO2 to graphene find a long carrier pathway in 0.1%GT. Even though recombination is greatly quenched in 0.3%GT (as from PL), the photoelectrons on extraction to graphene find a shorter carrier pathway may be due to aggregation of graphene layers (in relative to that in 0.1%GT). Undoubtedly, 0.1%GT with higher carrier lifetime can exhibit higher photocatalytic activity when compared with other hybrid variants. This is further evident from the superior photodegradation of an organic dye by 0.1%GT than 0.3%GT or 0.05%GT (see Fig. S6 and the corresponding discussion), and also from the fastest photoinduced superhydrophilic conversion of films coated with 0.1%GT as discussed earlier. Therefore 0.1%GT which has greater interfacial charge separation and reduced recombination among the hybrids, and it is studied further in detail for its morphology, chemical structure and bond formation. The morphology and the nanostructure of 0.1w/w TiO2/graphene hybrid are further studied and compared with TiO2 by TEM analysis. The as-synthesised Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals have shared cuboidal and ellipsoidal morphologies exposing larger percentage of high energy facets [32]. The morphology of TiO2 is similar in the case of 0.1%GT as well (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6). The HRTEM images show lattice fringes with d spacings of 3.5 Å in cuboidal nanocrystals indexed to (101) plane of anatase TiO2. A similar d spacing of 3.5 Å inclined at an angle of 90° to (101) plane can be indexed to ( 1 ¯ 01) plane, such that the nanocrystal is faced with {010} crystal facet, with {001} and {100} facets forming the lateral sides [50–52]. The edge to the top {010} facet is marked with d spacings of 2.4 Å that can be indexed to (004) planes of exposed {001} facet [53]. The ellipsoidal nanocrystals are indexed with d spacings of 2.4 Å and 3.5 Å at angle 21° to each other, corresponding to (001) and (101) planes respectively (Fig. S7). This affirms that both nanocuboids and nanoellipsoids are [001]-elongated anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposed with high energy {010}, {100} and {001} facets. For nanoellipsoids, a small percentage of eight low energy {101} facets are exposed at the slanting lateral sides. CTAB displays a crucial role in stabilizing these high energy facets of TiO2. As graphene act as heterogeneous nucleating sites due to its strong interfacial interaction [54], TiO2 nanocuboids and ellipsoids are densely deposited onto the graphene sheets. Almost, whole of the graphene layers are fully covered by TiO2 as graphene in the system is only 0.1 w/w. Inorder to identify the formation of potential reactive species and their role in superhydrophilic self-cleaning mechanisms, photocatalytic dye degradation with 0.1%GT were performed in the presence of isopropanol (IPA), benzoquinone (BZQ) and disodium EDTA (EDTA-2Na) as the scavengers for hydroxyl (•OH) radicals, superoxide (•O2¯) radicals and holes (h+), respectively (Fig. S8 and the corresponding discussion). The kinetic rate constant decreased from 0.059 min−1 (without scavengers) to 0.0006 min−1 and 0.003 min−1 respectively with IPA and BZQ. It is thus contemplated from the study that the predominant photogenerated active species during photocatalysis are •OH and •O2¯, among which the most active being •OH. Based on the aforementioned observations, the photocatalytic self-cleaning mechanism for the synthesised TiO2/rGO hybrid is postulated. On photoexcitation, electrons (e¯) in the valence band (VB) of TiO2 get excited to conduction band (CB) leaving behind h+. The principal active species •OH are formed by oxidizing surface adsorbed H2O molecules by the valence band h+. The presence of graphene can ensure abstract of electrons from the CB of TiO2 by the established chemical bonding and hence an efficient charge separation and charge migration. At the surface, •O2¯ radicals are formed by the reduction of molecular oxygen. The reactive oxygen species degrades organic dye molecules by rupturing its chemical structure and finally decomposing to CO2 and H2O. Meanwhile, h+ and •OH being crucial in enhancing photoinduced hydrophilicity diffuses to the surface and gets trapped at the sites of lattice oxygen [12]. This weakens Ti–O linkage and establishes new hydroxyl linkage between TiO2 and water molecules, thus achieving superwettability to the surface. The content of water in the reaction medium plays a key role in determining the morphology of the nanocrystals, and its photoactivity [32].As reported in our previous study, parent TiO2 and its 0.1% w/w sample are synthesised by typically reducing the quantity of water by half in the reaction medium with the molar proportions of TTIP/CTAB/IPA/AA/H2O being 1/0.5/7.4/0.63/11 (named TiO2(0.5) and 0.1%GT (0.5) respectively for pristine and hybrid sample) [55]. These samples are compared for their photocatalytic self-cleaning performance with that of parent Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals and its 0.1%GT.The kinetic rate constant for dye degradation was k = 0.009 min−1 for TiO2(0.5) nanocrystals and k = 0.024 min−1 for 0.1%GT (0.5) samples (less than 0.1%GT with k = 0.059 min−1), while the photoinduced wettability was ~5° within 15 min of UV irradiation (Fig. 6 d and e). Both TiO2(0.5) and 0.1%GT (0.5) samples had only TiO2 ellipsoids exposing high energy {010}/{100} and {001} facets along with low energy {101} facets (Fig. 6c). Thus, it is further established that presence of percentage of high energy facets in Pristine TiO2 nanocrsytals and 0.1%GT hybrid favors its superior self-cleaning mechanisms. Since, the holes being the primary active species are more attracted to the high energy facets and hence facilitates the formation of •OH radicals for photodegradation of organic molecules and for attaining superhydrophilicity. To investigate on the chemical interaction between TiO2 and rGO, FT-IR spectra were recorded (Figs. S3a and S9) for 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5) hybrids and compared with theparent TiO2 samples and GO. For pure TiO2 nanocrystals, the characteristic IR vibrations are below 900 cm−1 corresponding to Ti–O–Ti vibrations, whereas the broad peak centred at 3420 cm−1relating to O–H stretching vibrations of the surface hydroxyl groups [42]. Both 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5) show broadened peak up to 1200 cm−1 within the lower frequency region which can be attributed due to the formation of new chemical bonds between TiO2 and the oxygen functionalities of rGO sheets. The probable chemical bonds can be Ti–O–C or Ti–C bonds. Also, FTIR curve of GO shows characteristics peaks of –COOH groups (CO stretching vibrations) at 1720 cm−1, carboxy (C–O) at 1388 cm−1, epoxy (C–O) at 1144 cm−1, alkoxy (C–O) at 1057 cm−1, as reported elsewhere [33]. All these peaks are weakened when hybridized with TiO2 again supporting that GO is reduced to rGO during the hydrothermal treatment. In order to investigate the chemical interaction and bond formation between TiO2 and graphene layers, XPS analysis was carried out. Fig. 7 A shows the survey scan for GO, TiO2(0.5), 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5), which shows that the hybrid only consists of C, Ti and O without any detectable impurities. Fig. 7B displays the high-resolution spectra of C 1s peaks of GO, 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5). An abundance of oxygen functionalities on the surface of GO can be confirmed from the deconvolution peaks of C 1s spectrum of GO (Fig. 7B(a)). The peaks centred at binding energies 284.6 eV, 286.7 eV and 288.2 eV can be assigned to the sp2 carbons (CC) of hybridized graphitic carbon skeleton and to the oxygen functionalities over the GO surface, i.e., C–O–C of epoxy group or C–OH of hydroxyl group and CO of carboxyl group, respectively [43,44]. The deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum of 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5) (Fig. 7B (b) and (c)) displays that the intensity of the sp2 carbon at 284.8 eV enhances. Whereas, the weakening of peaks corresponding to C–O–C and CO group in C1s XPS spectrum of 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5) (Fig. 7B (b) and (c)) affirms that these oxygen functionalities are reduced inrGO under high temperature and pressure generated during the hydrothermal treatment, which is consistent with the FT-IR results. Also, these residual oxygen functionalities in the hybrid are reflected as increased ID/IG ratio in previously discussed Raman spectra. The high resolution spectrum of the Ti 2p peaks of TiO2(0.5), 0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5) are illustrated in Fig. 7C. Two prominent peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were observed for all the samples, which indicates the presence of Ti in +4 state. The doublet splitting energy of 5.7 eV also remained consistent for all the 3 samples [45]. The peaks at 458.4 eV and 464.4 eV corresponding to the Ti in +4 state in TiO2(0.5) sample displays a slight shift in higher binding energy for both the hybrid samples [46–48]. This strongly affirms that a chemical binding has been established between TiO2 and rGO sheets during the hydrothermal treatment which could highly benefit the interfacial charge transport during photoexcitation of TiO2. Hence, reflected in the superior photoinduced superhydrophilicity of graphene hybrids compared to their parent TiO2 samples. Moreover, Fig. 7D displays the high-resolution O 1s of TiO2(0.5), GO and 0.1%GT (0.5). The deconvolution of the O 1s of TiO2(0.5) (Fig. 7D (a)) displaying peaks at 529.6 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen of titania (O–Ti+4), while the small peaks above 531 eV were ascribed to the adsorbed oxygen and the hydroxyl radicals [19,49].As evident in Ti 2p spectra, the hybrid sample (Fig. 7D (c)) displayed a similar shift for the Ti–O bond to higher binding energy, which again reaffirm the positive linkage of the reduced graphene sheets with the titania. The O 1s of the GO sample (Fig. 7D (b)) displayed a prominent peak at 530.4 eV which is ascribed to the C–OH of hydroxyl group and CO of carboxyl group, respectively [43,44]. The peak intensities of the oxygenated carbon species display a sharp decline in the hybrid samples, which confers to the reduction of GO to the formation of rGO. Finally, photocatalytic efficiency of the optimized TiO2/graphene hybrids (0.1%GT and 0.1%GT (0.5)) and bare parent samples (Pristine TiO2 and TiO2(0.5)) were studied for their application in photocatalytic hydrogen generation (see Fig. 8). Photocatalytic water splitting and photo reforming are two vital and competitive process in the chemical conversion of solar energy to H2 fuel. The use of sacrificial agent can hence aid in the process of water splitting by reacting with photogenerated holes on the catalyst surface and undergoes oxidation, concurrently with the production of H+ ions. Simultaneously, the electrons generated on the catalyst surface react with H+ ions to produce hydrogen. Fig. 8shows the cumulative amount of hydrogen generated when TiO2 nanocrystals and their corresponding 0.1% w/w hybrid is photo-excited in the presence of glycerol (10% v/v). The hydrogen production rate of the photocatalysts followed the order 0.1%GT (0.5) > 0.1%GT > TiO2(0.5) > Pristine TiO2. The 0.1%GT (0.5) exhibited H2 production as high as 18,266.6 μL/gm/L/hr under solar light irradiation, as compared to 14,006.1 μL/gm/L/hr of H2 produced by its parent TiO2(0.5) sample. Also, with regard to Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals (12,911.6 μL/gm/L/hr), 0.1%GT showed a greater H2 production (13967.1 μL/gm/L/hr). It is hence evident that the interfacial charge carrier dynamics between the TiO2 and graphene always favours the photocatalytic H2 production. It is also noteworthy that H2 production is greatly influenced by morphology and exposed crystal facets. We had previously reported morphology engineering of TiO2(0.5) by altering acidic pH conditions (pH changed between 3.5 and 2.5) [32]. When synthesised at pH 3.5, TiO2 nanocrystals acquired spherical morphology, and at pH 2.5, nanocrystals were of truncated octahedral bipyramidal geometry. Both these morphologies lacked high energy facets where the spatial separation of charge carriers is impeded and hence resulted in reduced H2 production than for TiO2(0.5) (Fig. S10). Earlier literature of titania nanoparticles hybrids with rGO or GO displayed impressive photocatalytic results compared to their parent samples. A summarized glance of the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency of titania hybrids with GO and rGO using different sacrificial agents is provided in Table S1. Thus, structural modifications, self doping and even the use of different varieties of sacrificial agents and co-catalysts did contribute to the enhanced H2 production output. Nevertheless, the enhanced surface area by incorporation of graphene rendered enough lifetime for the photogenerated charge carriers to evade recombination and further participate in the photocatalytic process. It is clear from the aforementioned results and discussions that 0.1%GT (0.1%w/w graphene hybrid of Pristine TiO2) showed excellent photocatalytic self-cleaning activity while 0.1%GT (0.5) (hybrid of TiO2(0.5) nanocrystals) showed superior H2 production. The difference in performance of these two photocatalytic applications can be explained with regard to their morphological structure of TiO2 nanoparticles and spatial separation of charge carriers caused by the exposed percentage of high energy facets (Fig. 9 ). It was reported that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanoparticles is strongly facet dependent due to the differences in the surface potentials between different facets. {001}, {010} or {100} high energy facets in anatase TiO2 are attractive to holes due to their high surface potential, while low energy {101} facet is attractive to electrons [53,56–58]. Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals in 0.1%GT with shared cuboidal and ellipsoidal morphology are largely exposing high energy facets. Thus, at TiO2 surface, holes are preferably more attracted and available when compared to electrons, which is more advantageous in imparting superhydrophilic self-cleaning behaviour to the hybrid. Whilst, 0.1%GT (0.5) and TiO2(0.5) being comprised of optimum percentages of both high and low energy facets. Thus electrons and holes are equally and spatially separated at the surface of TiO2. As electrons are the active species required for H2 production, comparatively 0.1%GT (0.5) has more of spatially separated photoelectrons available at the surface of TiO2. The electrons being available at TiO2 surface can participate directly in H2 production. Photogenerated electrons are also abstracted and conducted by π-π conjugation of graphene. These electrons also undergo reduction half cycles of photocatalysis to generate H2 or superoxide radicals (O2 •¯). Hence it is concluded that more electrons available at TiO2 surface in 0.1%GT (0.5) is reflected as its superior H2 production with respect to 0.1%GT. Thus, engineered morphology can effectively tune the nature of photocatalytic performance of TiO2. To support the proposed mechanism of charge separation in morphology engineered Pristine TiO2 and TiO2(0.5) samples and their 0.1% w/w graphene hybrids, photoresponsive nature of these samples were investigated. Fig. 10 displays photocurrent response I-t curves of samples measured under Xe lamp irradiation and across a constant bias of 2 V. All samples show a stable and reproducible photocurrent response for consecutive on-off cycles of light illumination. It is very prominent from the results that hybrids show an enhanced photoresponse than that of parent TiO2 which is due to the presence of conducting graphene layers. Even the presence of 0.1% w/w of graphene to TiO2 greatly reflected in more than two-fold increase in photocurrent. Moreover, the decay response for TiO2(0.5) and its hybrid is comparatively slower than that of Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals and its hybrid, which can be explained in terms of their morphologies. 0.1%GT (0.5) and TiO2(0.5) having wholly nanoellipsoids have optimum percentage of high energy and low energy facets making electrons and holes equally available at the crystal surface. Whereas, 0.1%GT and Pristine TiO2 nanocrystals have shared morphology of nanocuboids and nanoellipsoids, for which holes are preferably attracted to all three high energy {010}/{100} and {001} facets of nanocuboids. Upon switching-off light, the spatially separated electrons and holes are comparatively more in 0.1%GT (0.5) and TiO2(0.5) and find more time to decay by their recombination. Aforesaid again supported by the study of electrical properties by Hall Effect measurements of sample films. The principle of Hall Effect is that under the effect of an applied magnetic field B → z and an electric current I → x to a thin semiconductor sample plate, a distortion in the magnetic field of charge carriers occurs leading to the separation of negatively charged electrons to one side of the sample plate and positively charged holes to the other side (Fig. S11). This leads to the generation of Hall voltage, v → y . Both TiO2 and its hybrids are found to be of N-type semiconductor. Table 2 shows the electrical measurements done both in dark and in presence of light. Resistivity decreased for all samples in presence of light which again reflects the photoresponsive nature of the samples. Resistivity is also lower for the hybrid when compared with parent TiO2, which is due to the presence of graphene counterpart. Carrier density of the samples is in the order of 109 to 1012 cm−3 and shows an increase for bare TiO2 samples in presence of light. While the reduction in carrier density for 0.1% w/w TiO2/graphene hybrids under light illumination can be related with the interfacial charge transfer to graphene from TiO2. Moreover, carrier density is more reduced for 0.1%GT (0.5) than in 0.1%GT, which postulates that the electrons are more transferred to graphene layers in 0.1%GT (0.5) than being in the bulk of TiO2 which is due to the characteristics of its optimum percentage of exposed high energy and low energy facets. Thus, morphological engineering of TiO2 in its graphene hybrids greatly influenced its performance in different photocatalytic applications."
7,Conclusions,"In conclusion, morphology engineered TiO2 nanocrystals and their graphene hybrids were successfully synthesised by a simple hydrothermal modified sol-gel method at 180 °C. The hybrids had densely populated anatase TiO2 over graphene layers with strong Ti–C chemical bond which is confirmed by XPS and FTIR. The difference in morphology of TiO2 greatly reflected in their reactivity towards different photocatalytic applications. TiO2 with nanoellipsoidal morphology had superior hydrogen production as high as 18,266.6 μL/gm/L/hr under solar light irradiation. This is due to the optimum percentage of high energy and low energy facets, and so electrons and holes are equally available at TiO2 surface. While the hybrid with shared morphology of nanocuboids and nanoellipsoids for TiO2 showed comparatively lesser H2 production (13,967.1 μL/gm/L/hr). This hybrid had relatively more of high energy facets exposed, to which holes are more attracted and thus had superior superhydrophilicity. Moreover, all TiO2/rGO hybrids showed enhanced hydrogen production and self-cleaning activity in the visible region compared to their parent TiO2 samples."
