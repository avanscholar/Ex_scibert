0,Introduction,"Society relies heavily on energy sources in their daily lives, especially for the transportation of goods, services, and people. For several decades, energy has come from fuels derived from petroleum, but as a non-renewable resource, there is a need to find alternatives. It well known that ethanol is widely used as an alternative to gasoline [1]. However, ethanol has a much lower energy density (only 21MJ/L versus about 32MJ/L for gasoline), a high hygroscopicity and a higher volatility than gasoline [2,3]. A different alternative are pentanol isomers, due to their low affinity for water and an energy density of about 28MJ/L, still less than that of gasoline but better than ethanol, fitting well into the current transportation infrastructure [2]. Furan and its derivatives, which can be extracted from lignocellulosic biomass, produce tetrahydrofuran (THF), methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), and dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) with catalytic dehydrogenation; these compounds can be used as fuels. 2-methylfuran (2-MF) is a five-member aromatic heterocyclic molecule of the furan family, with one of the electron lone pairs of the oxygen atom delocalized over the π-system in the ring. The 2-MF can be produced by selective hydrogenation of furfural, which is in turn available on an industrial scale by the hydrolysis–dehydration of the hemicellulose part of agriculture wastes and forest residues [4,5]. Different authors have reported the catalytic hydrogenation of 2-MF with different catalysts. Clauss used Rh–Sn/SiO2 and Ag/SiO2 as catalysts for gas phase hydrogenation of furfural having as intermediate the 2-MF and reported that these catalysts suppress the formation of 1-pentanol and 1,5-pentanediol, with very low selectivity for these alcohols [6]. Aliaga et al. showed the 2-MF hydrogenation on Pt nanoparticles and presented over the catalyst bind through heterocyclic π-cloud in a nearly flat configuration; this allows ring opening, leading to the formation of pentanol isomers. The reaction was carried out in a closed chamber at high pressure of hydrogen (10Torr); the selectivity to 1-pentanol was 98% at 40°C, and the selectivity to 2-pentanol was 43% at 95°C [7]. Biswas et al. reported a Cu/Cr/Ni/Zn/Fe catalyst reduced in hydrogen at 340°C into a continuous reactor and performed the hydrogenation of 2-MF obtaining a selectivity of 25% for 2-pentanol at 200°C, but decreased to 10% at 250°C [8]. Hailong et al. used a CuO-Mg3AlOx (30% wt. Cu) catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol, having 2-MF as intermediate. They reported a 18% of selectivity to 1-pentanol in a closed chamber reactor, at high pressure of 6MPa of hydrogen [9]. In this work, the 2-MF molecule will be used as feed of the catalytic reactor. Pd has been used as a promising catalyst metal due to its relative stability in air environment and easy recycle. Palladium also readily adsorbs the furan ring due to a strong interaction between the metal and the π bonds in the molecule [8,10–12]. In other hand, bimetallic catalysts often exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to their individual metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes. It has been shown that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical for their catalytic properties [13]. The effect of the addition of a second metal can be classified into three main categories: (i) increasing the catalytic activity, (ii) modifying the selectivity and (iii) improving catalyst stability [14]. Metals are generally deposited as oxides, or as a mixture of metals, which in turn promote hydrogenation. In the hydrogenation of furfural, Sitthisa et al. proved that addition of Fe to Ni as catalysts, supresses decarboxylation and promotes hydrogenation of the carbonyl group (at low temperatures) and hydrogenolysis of CO (at high temperature); an important finding was the stability of η2-(C, O), which can be easily hydrogenated [12]. Chen et al. reported the formation of an atomic alloy of Pd and Co as bimetallic catalyst by identification of interplanar distances measured in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, that slightly exceeded the corresponding values of planes of pure Pd [15]. Other works report different synthesized bimetallic catalysts that are analyzed by elemental analysis to obtain the molar relation of a possible alloy [16–19]. Chen et al. synthesized Pt-Fe alloy nanoparticles to be used as catalyst; the alloy phase was confirmed by annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) images and the diffractogram. The peak positions for the disordered alloy phase was according to Powder Diffraction File (PDF) No. 030659122.H [20]. Wang et al. studied Pt3Co alloy supported on carbon as catalyst by ADF-STEM image and an electron spot diffractogram and comparing with the PDF No. 04-004-5243 [21]. In this work, the interplanar distance analysis of HRTEM images is presented, in comparison to the Patron Diffraction Files (PDF), in order to identify the presence of a real alloy compound as catalytic site. If a synthesized bimetallic catalyst presents competitive catalytic activity, it is important to demonstrate the formation of a true bimetallic catalyst. The objective of this research was to prepare and characterize new bimetallic Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts, to be applied in the hydrogenation of 2-MF for the selective formation of pentanol species. The conversion of 2-MF was compared over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, both supported on γ-alumina. It is interesting to show the presence of an alloy compound in a catalyst in the HRTEM images that cause a positive effect in the rise of selectivity to form alcohol products. As mentioned before, an important group of hydrogenation products are the alcohols, which can be considered as biofuels."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The monometallic Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3 and Fe/Al2O3 and the bimetallic Pd-Fe/Al2O3 Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method with 0.5% wt of each metal as loading from aqueous solutions of the corresponding metal precursors such as Pd(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 (Sigma Aldrich) to synthesize the Pd and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts, and the precursors H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 37.5% of Pt) and FeCl2·4H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) for the rest of catalysts. Commercial γ-alumina (CATALOX® SBa-200) was added and used as support, which has a specific surface area of 244.15m2/g. A solution with the support was stirred for 24h. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 80°C and calcined at 620°C. The monometallic catalyst with 0.5% wt. of Fe, 0.5% wt. of Pd and 0.5% wt. of Pt were labeled as Fe/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 respectively. The bimetallic catalysts with 0.5% wt. of Pd and 0.5% wt. of Fe, and with 0.5% wt. of Pt and 0.5% wt. of Fe were labeled as Pd-Fe/Al2O3 and Pt-Fe/Al2O3, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Thermal analysis To study their thermal behavior, catalyst samples prepared and dried at 80°C were studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both analyses were carried out by a differential/thermogravimetric thermal analyzer TA instruments SDT 2960. Experiments were performed under the following conditions: from room temperature to 1000°C, heating rate of 5°C/min, and a flow of 100mL/min extra dry air. 2.2.2 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) For each TPR measurement, 40mg of catalyst were placed in a quartz tube, heated at 30°C/min under a 20mL/min He flow up to 500°C, and held at that temperature for 1h. The sample was then cooled down to 25°C and exposed to a 20mL/min stream of 5% H2/Ar; it was later heated at 5°C/min up to 1000°C. Hydrogen consumption was monitored online by a TCD detector. 2.2.3 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The metal morphology and size over surface was observed using a FEI Titan G2 30–800 transmission electron microscope with high-resolution."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements Reactions were carried out in a tubular flow reactor with atmospheric outlet. The pelletized and sieved catalyst (size 250–355μm) was placed at the center of a quartz tube reactor, between two layers of quartz wool, installed vertically inside an electric furnace. Before the reaction, the catalyst was pre-reduced under a flow of H2 ((60mL/min), Airgas 99.99%) for 1h at 450°C. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled down to reaction temperature. Three different reaction temperatures were used (100, 150 and 200°C) and the feed was introduced continuously via a syringe pump (Cole Palmer). All lines at the inlet and outlet of the reactor were kept heated at 100°C in order to keep all compounds in the vapor phase. The products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Agilent model 6890) using a ZB-WAX capillary column and an FID detector. 150mg of catalyst was used for each run, injecting liquid flows of 0.5mL/h into a hydrogen stream."
5,Results,
6,Thermal analysis,"3.1 Thermal analysis Fig. 1 A shows the TGA and DTA for Fe/Al2O3 (prepared with the iron chloride salt) and Pt/Al2O3 (0.5% wt.) monometallic catalysts and Pt-Fe/Al2O3 (0.5% wt.) bimetallic catalyst. Four mass loss stages are observed for Fe/Al2O3, with the first step between 30 and 80°C (6% mass loss), the second from 80 to 260°C (4.5% mass loss), the third from 260 to 470°C (3.5% mass loss), and the fourth from 470 to 1000°C (2.5% mass loss). Two endothermic processes are observed at 40 and 240°C, which can be attributed to physisorbed and chemisorbed water, as well as the formation of iron oxides [22]. According to references, the possible Fe species present (iron hydroxides such as γ-FeOOH, prior to calcining) decompose between 220 and 280°C, depending on the heating rate, which is then followed by the formation of γ-Fe2O3. Between 450 and 500°C the transformation of γ-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3 occurs [23,24]. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst showed three mass loss steps, the first one between 25 and 70°C (10% mass loss), the second from 70 to 610°C (7.1% mass loss), and the third from 610 to 1000°C (1.8% mass loss). In the DTA results, three endothermic signals are also observed, at 51, 160 and 600°C. Radivojević, et al., studied the decomposition temperatures of precursor salts (H6PtCl6·6H2O) used for synthesis of catalysts doped with Pt by the TGA/DTA technique and they reported the following reactions: (1) 25–280°C H2PtCl6·6H2O→PtCl4 +2HCl+6H2O (2) 350–350°C PtCl4 →PtCl2 +Cl2 (3) 350–530°C PtCl2 →Pt+Cl2 They also mention that after impregnation with this salt, the following complexes are formed on the surface of the support: [PtIVCl(6-x)(H2O)x](2−x)− (x=0,1,2), (PtIVCl6)2−, Pt(OH)xCly (x=1, 2, y=4, 5), PtOxCly, PtCl2 and PtCl4); when alumina is used, the PtOxCly species are predominant due to the acidity of this support [25]. Therefore, mass loss in the first zone of this endothermic process may be due to the loss of the physisorbed water, while for the second zone more water is lost and formation of gaseous HCl and Cl2 takes place due to decomposition of the precursor salt. In the third zone, mass loss occurs due to structural reorganization of the alumina support and formation of Pt complexes [26–28]. For the 0.5% Pt-Fe/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, a thermogravimetric behavior similar to that of Pt/Al2O3 is observed. Three mass loss steps are shown, with the first one from 25 to 68°C (7.5% weight loss), the second one from 68 to 589°C (8.8% mass loss), and the third one from 589 to 1000°C (2.1% mass loss). Two endothermic DTA peaks at 48 and 151°C were also identified, and are attributed to physisorbed water and decomposition of precursor salts. Unlike Fe/Al2O3, the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst does not show the endothermic peak at 240°C (characteristic of the γ-Fe2O3 formation), nor the exothermic signal at 430°C (attributed to the conversion of γ-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3). However, the endothermic peak at 151°C in the bimetallic catalyst is more pronounced than for Pt/Al2O3; this can be due to formation of Fe oxides occuring at a lower temperature when Pt is present. In general, all catalytic systems studied showed thermal changes up to approximately 600°C, which allowed to fix the optimum calcination temperature during the synthesis. Therefore, the species present on the surface of alumina after calcination are Fe oxides and Pt oxychlorinated complexes. Fig. 1B shows TGA and DTA results for Fe/Al2O3 (prepared with the iron nitrate salt) Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. In all of them, a mass loss of around 150°C was observed, which corresponds with physisorbed water [9], with a 11% mass loss for monometallic catalysts (Fe and Pd), and an 8% mass loss for the bimetallic catalyst. This process is observed in DTA at around 80°C for the three catalysts. The monometallic iron catalyst presents an endothermic signal at 240°C, with a mass loss of 5.11%; this can be attributed to the decomposition of nitrate ions, which has been previously reported in the range of 200–330°C [3,8]. The decomposition of γ-FeOOH species at this temperature has also been reported, followed with formation of γ-Fe2O3 [23]. The bimetallic catalyst presents different behavior until approximately 250°C compared with the monometallic catalysts; the iron-palladium combination began to give evidence of formation of new chemical species (compounds) not present in monometallic samples. After 250°C, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 present almost the same mass loss behavior, with a very wide peak in DTA from 250 to 750°C. The maximums (exothermic) for Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 are at 505 and 517°C, respectively, with another endothermic peak at 836 and 916°C, respectively. These thermal events can be related to the formation of PdO and PdO decomposition to elemental Pd respectively [29,30]. The bimetallic catalyst maintains a slightly decreasing mass loss slope from 700 to 1000°C; the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst shows a similar behavior, with only a small positive slope from 850 to 1000°C. A convenient temperature of calcination for the three type of catalysts is 620°C, mainly due to the thermal events of interaction seen in the bimetallic sample. TGA and DTA results are useful because the calcination temperatures were obtained and in this analysis it was found the first findings of the forming of bimetallic compounds to cause new catalytic sites."
7,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"3.2 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles for alumina and all the catalysts, both monometallic and bimetallic. As observed, there was no reduction peak for γ-Al2O3. The Fe/Al2O3 catalyst presents a broad peak from 440 to 650°C with a maximum at 580°C and another more pronounced reduction peak from 860 to 990°C with a maximum at 922°C. The first signal can be attributed to the reduction reaction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, while the second may be explained as a reduction of Fe2O3 into FeO and Fe [31–33]; the first reduction signal is an evidence of iron oxide interaction with the support (alumina). The Pt/Al2O3 sample presents a single reduction peak at 427°C; this can be attributed to the reduction of oxy or hydroxychlorinated species (from the platinum precursor) to elemental Pt [34–37]. For the bimetallic Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, a small peak at 230°C is observed, along with a second, broader and less intense peak with a maximum at 450°C (a temperature similar to the peak observed for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst). Small shoulders appear at 350 and 385°C. It has been previously reported that when the Fe load is less than or equal to Pt, most of the iron species are in contact with the Pt species, which allows the reduction of iron oxides to a lower required temperature than when Pt is not present [38]. The first peak and the mentioned shoulders are attributed to Pt-Fe oxide species reduction. It is important to mention that for the bimetallic catalysts, electron transfer can exist [14,39]; therefore, Pt may donate electrons to Fe, reducing it to Fe+2 while Pt is oxidized. After being reduced, the alloy is finally formed [40–42]. The TPR profile for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst presents a small negative peak at 29°C attributed to an increase of molecular hydrogen due to decomposition of β-PdH phase, which is formed by Pd0 species trapped in the bulk of support, by H2 diffusion from the Pd crystallites, which are in turn easily reduced to elemental Pd during the TPR preparation of samples [15,18]. An intense reduction peak at 220°C corresponds with reduction of PdO particles weakly interacting with alumina and dispersed over the support; a second, less intense and broader signal at 370°C indicates reduction of PdO species strongly interacting with the alumina. Lower reduction temperatures have been previously found for palladium oxides [19], but the evidence of this work reveals small particles (maybe nanoparticles) very well dispersed and strong interaction with the support [21]. The bimetallic catalyst (Pd-Fe/Al2O3) shows the same reductions signals of the monometallic catalyst (except for the negative peak), but at lower temperatures. Two peaks are observed, an intense signal at 200°C along with a less intense, broader peak (but shorter than Pd/Al2O3) at 360°C and a barely detectable broad peak at 500°C. Pd promotes the reduction of Fe before of reduction process (calcination treatment), reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Fe2+ is then reduced at low temperature, in reductive conditions, by the presence of Pd. When Fe is present in a greater load, the presence of particles that are not in contact with the Pd is observed, thus reducing these particles is not promoted before the reduction process. So during reducing process Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+at high temperatures and then to Fe° [43]. The behavior of TPR profile of bimetallic sample with lower temperatures reveals a presence of alloy of Fe and Pd. The formation of bimetallic compound can be deduced by the last results, but HRTEM characterization confirmed this finding, as discussed later in this work."
8,Catalytic activity tests,"3.3 Catalytic activity tests Fig. 3 shows the conversion as a function of temperature for Fe, Pt, Pt-Fe, Pd and Pd-Fe catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 (pre-reduced at 450°C) for the hydrogenation of 2-MF. The monometallic Fe/Al2O3 catalyst showed absence of catalytic activity at the three tested temperatures. For the monometallic Pt catalyst (Pt/Al2O3), conversions at 100 and 150°C were almost zero, but an increase to up to 18.6% conversion is observed at 200°C. As previously shown in the TPR tests, reduction events for both monometallic Fe and Pt catalysts were not complete at the pre-reduction temperature (450°C). Therefore, metallic oxide species were still present in the catalysts, which can be responsible for low activity at 200°C. However, the selectivity for alcohols at the reaction temperature of 200°C, using the catalysts previously reduced at 450°C, is very competitive when compared with other works [8]. Both the bimetallic Pt-Fe/Al2O3 and the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts presented significant conversion only at the highest temperature tested (200°C), from which the conversion achieved by the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was the highest (18.6%). This shows that the combination with iron affected the catalytic activity of platinum. It is possible that the formation of Fe oxides at lower temperatures (even in presence of Pt), as the thermal characterizations showed, promoted the presence of elemental platinum, along with a combination of less active, temperature-persistent Pt and Fe oxides. It was also observed in Fig. 2 that the monometallic Pt catalyst showed a reduction signal maximum at a lower temperature (427°C) than the corresponding signal for the bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst (450°C). Therefore, while for the monometallic Pt catalyst some metal oxides could be present, it is possible that more Pt could be reduced to the more active, elemental Pt0 at the pre-reduction temperature (compared with the bimetallic catalyst), explaining the increase in catalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In order to compare the catalytic results, the next reaction rate values were obtained. For the monometallic Pt catalyst, -r'A =25.27mol/s-gcat. For the monometallic Pd catalyst, -r'A =6.87mol/s-gcat. Finally, for the bimetallic catalysts Pt-Fe and Pd-Fe, reaction rate values were -r'A =11.71mol/s-gcat and 42.21mol/s-gcat, respectively. These values were obtained at a temperature of 200°C, using the next equation: -r'A = FA0*x/W, where FA0 is the inlet molar flow of 2-MF, x is conversion, and W is the weight of catalyst. Also the Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated at the same conditions, as TOF = -r'A/S, where S is the number of active sites, for monometallic Pt and Pd catalyst were 9.86×105 s−1 and 1.46×105 s−1, respectively; and for bimetallic catalysts Pt-Fe and Pd-Fe were 4.56×105 s−1 and 2.69×106 s−1, respectively. The S was estimated from the experimental initial amount of metal in the catalyst (obtained from atomic absorption spectrometry) and the final alloy phase observed for each catalyst via TEM micrographs. As it can be seen the TOF for the bimetallic Pd-Fe catalyst is the highest. The monometallic palladium (Pd/Al2O3) catalyst presented the best catalytic activity of all catalysts at the lowest temperature (100°C), with 23.4% of conversion. This catalyst continues with the best performance also at 150°C, but its catalytic activity drastically decreases up to 5% conversion at the highest reaction temperature (200°C). This can be explained due to a deposition of carbon for early decarboxylation reaction of 2-MF, which in turn covers the hydrogenation catalytic sites of the monometallic Pd catalyst [44]. The same Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was tested from 100 to 200°C, at the time of use was enough to decrease the activity. The bimetallic Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst presented a different behavior compared with the monometallic Pd catalyst; the conversion increases constantly as a function of temperature. At the highest temperature for this experiment, the bimetallic Pd-Fe catalyst showed the highest conversion of 2-MF (31.15%). This is similar to previous works for hydrogenation of 2-MF, such as that reported by Zhu et al. [45], who observed a conversion of 33.3% when operating a continuous catalytic reactor at 220°C and atmospheric pressure, with a commercial Cu-Zn catalyst. Table 1 resumes conversion and yield data for all catalysts evaluated in this work, with the exception of the monometallic Fe catalysts, which showed abscence of catalytic activity at the reaction temperatures. Fig. 4 shows the product selectivity for the Pt, Pt-Fe, Pd and Pd-Fe catalysts on Al2O3. Both the monometallic and bimetallic Pt catalysts form the same type of products: pentene, 2-pentanone, 1-pentanol and 2-pentanol. The production of both alcohol species is very low and the catalyst of pure platinum (Pt/Al2O3) denotes a very high selectivity for pentene. The 2-MF molecule, according to its structure, is adsorbed on the surface of the Pt catalysts in two different ways: in a planar form through the CC groups of the furan ring, or vertically through the oxygen of the COC group of the furan ring [10]. Delbecq and Sautet, in 1995, suggested that the adsorption competitiveness is due to the radial expansion of d orbital of the active metal [46]. According to Vetere, et al., the Pt has this property showing repulsion to the CC functional groups of the furan ring; therefore the 2-MF molecule is adsorbed vertically by the interaction of the Pt with the oxygen atom from the ring and the repulsion that exists with the rest of the molecule [10]. Fig. 4c and d present the selectivity of formed products for the monometallic and bimetallic palladium catalysts, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3. It is very interesting that both catalysts yield the same type of products (though with different distributions): 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), pentene, pentanal, 2-pentanone, 2 butanone and the alcohols 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 1-butanol. In both catalysts, MTHF showed higher selectivity at low temperatures, but it fell to almost zero when the temperature was increased to 200°C. MTHF is considered an intermediate to form the rest of the products. It is notable the higher selectivity observed on the formation of 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 1-butanol for Pd-Fe/Al2O3 compared with the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The total selectivity of the alcohols for the bimetallic Pd catalyst was 39.15% at 200°C and 27.67% for the monometallic Pd catalyst, considering a higher conversion with the bimetallic catalyst. 2-butanone was formed with very low selectivity (less than 1%) at all temperatures. The formation of MTHF at low temperatures when Pd catalysts were used indicates that 2-MF is adsorbed in a different way compared with the Pt catalysts. Vorotnikov et al. studied the adsorption of 2-MF on a surface of Pd (111), which has a face-centered cubic structure (FCC). They found that the most favorable adsorption of the molecule is flat, with the furan ring centered at the FCC hollow site and the methyl group tilted away from the molecular plane to preserve the sp 3 hybridization [47]. This observation justifies the first step of the mechanism for hydrodeoxygenation of 2-MF, which will be discussed thoroughly in the next section."
9,Proposal of the mechanism to form the products of Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.4 Proposal of the mechanism to form the products of Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts According to the presented results, a mechanism for hydrodeoxygenation of 2-MF to form the observed reaction products using the bimetallic Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst is presented as theoretical proposal in Fig. 5 . The first step involves adsorption of the reactants over the catalyst surface, in which case hydrogen readily dissociates in two hydrogen atoms, which later transfer to the CC double bond due to the partially-filled outer layers (d and f) of Pd [48]. The 2-MF adsorption over the catalyst surface is represented as occurring over the flat molecule, with the methyl substituent moving away, as stated before. Biswas et al. suggested 2-MF adsorbs via the double bonds, which promotes first the hydrogenation of the CC bonds and afterwards, an opening of the 5-membered ring [8]. While hydrogenation of the double bonds may proceed simultaneously, in Fig. 5B–F this process is represented in two steps to have an easier understanding. Hydrogenation of 2-MF produces 2-MTHF, which is in equilibrium with its adsorbed and desorbed states (steps G and H). In order to open the ring, MTHF is adsorbed via the oxygen atom (step H), and an SN1 attack from a hydrogen atom on the more substituted carbon is observed (step I). After this, the oxygen attacks a hydrogen atom left over the surface, which leads to the formation of 1-pentanol [49], which in turn is in equilibrium between its adsorbed and desorbed phases (steps K and L). After the bonding of pentanol with the catalyst surface (step M), the reaction proceeds in two different ways. If an active catalyst surface site attacks a hydrogen atom β to the hydroxyl group, the electrons forming the previous CH bond migrate to form a new CC double bond which in turn promote the cleavage of the CO bond, with OH as the leaving group and forming 1-pentene (steps N and O). However, if the active site attacks a hydrogen atom α to the hydroxyl group, the higher electronegativity of the O atom attracts the electrons, forming a CO double bond and promoting the cleavage of the OH bond and the liberation of a whole hydrogen molecule (step P). A pentanal molecule is formed in this process, which is in equilibrium between its adsorbed and desorbed phases (steps Q and R). Although pentanal formation from 1-pentanol may seem unlikely given the reductant conditions, Oyama et al. have confirmed this reaction sequence, attributing it to an abundance of active surface sites due to a low hydrogen content which promotes incomplete occupation by the hydrogen species, while for higher pressures (5atm), the surface is more fully occupied with adsorbed species, and pentanal formation is observed before 1-pentanol [50]. Attack from an hydroxyl group present from the alumina surface to the carbon atom α to the carbonyl group of pentanal promotes simultaneous decarbonylation and hydroxylation, forming butanol as the final product and carbon monoxide as side product (steps S and T) [33]."
10,High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),"3.5 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) The Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst presented the best conversion at 200°C and the highest selectivity to form alcohols at the same condition. In order to know more about the surface of this catalyst, HRTEM was applied to analyze and explain the significant performance of Pd-Fe/Al2O3. Fig. 6 presents the HRTEM image of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, where a group of four nanoparticles (indicated as A, B, C and D) with different morphology and arrange of atomic planes is observed. Perpendicular lines were drawn (cyan color) to calculate the interplanar distances (IDs) in the micrographs; the average measure was compared with the PDF to identify the crystalline phase observed in the nanoparticle. In zone A, the average measure of the IDs was 0.2801±0.0030nm and matched the (200) plane according to the PDF 04-005-475 for a O4Pd3.5 crystalline phase, which indicates the sample was not completely reduced. For zone B the ID measure was 0.2261±0.0050nm and matched the (111) plane according to the PDF 04-001-7354 for a FePd3 crystalline phase [51]; this confirms the formation of a bimetallic Pd-Fe alloy. According with information of the PDF, an iron atom is located in the six corners of the cubic lattice and three palladium atoms are in the six faces of the cube. The planar packing fraction (PPF) for the face centered cubic (111) plane is 0.906, which means there is a very high density of atoms for an exposed plane. In zone C, the identified crystalline phases were magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) iron oxides; the observed ID of 0.2578±0.0035nm were matched with the (311) plane according to the PDF 880866 for magnetite, and with the (311) plane according to the PDF 240081 for maghemite. A Pd crystalline phase was identified in zone D, where the ID was calculated as 0.24004±0.0025nm, which matches with the (111) plane according the PDF 01-087-0637. The presence of the bimetallic alloy of FePd3 may produce a greater attraction of 2-MF and H2 than monometallic palladium particles present in the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. One effect of having a bimetallic Pd alloy with a second metal such as Fe or Co as a catalytic site is to have a higher electron density on palladium atoms, which is likely due to incomplete filling of the valence shell of the second metal and to electron transfer to unoccupied Pd orbitals [44]. In the other hand, Jinfan Yang et al., reported that the presence of iron species leads to a decrease of chemically accessible Pd sites on the surface of a Pd/SiO2 catalyst; nevertheless, the Pd-Fe alloy cause a synergism effect favouring performance of a bimetallic Pd-FeO/SiO2 catalyst [52]. This synergism effect is due to the electronic structure of the surface d-band in alloy sites of bimetallic catalysts, which makes them more active than monometallic catalysts [53]. Other works mention that bimetallic alloys of Pd with other metals such as Re or Cu promote an increased activation of H2 on the catalyst surface compared with pure palladium catalysts [53,54]."
11,Conclusion,"Pt/Al2O3, Pt-Fe/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized with low metal weight percentage (0.5%) on alumina and reduced at 450°C, and nanoparticles around 5nm of size were obtained. The thermal analyses reveled a strong interaction of Pt and Pd with the Fe in the bimetallic formulations. A possible bimetallic compound formation was confirmed with TPR. The Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts performance for 2-MF hydrogenation at 200°C was very low and the formed products were not of interest to be used as direct biofuel application (pentene). In contrast, the Pd/Al2O3, Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts presented a better performance, with both an increased conversion and the formation of more valuable products. Pd-Fe/Al2O3 presented the highest conversion, with production of diverse alcohols such 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 1-butanol, which can be considered as a good blend to be used as biofuel. A mechanism to form the obtained products with the bimetallic catalyst of Pd and Fe was also presented. The HRTEM image analysis revealed the formation of FePd3 nanoparticles, which was related with the good hydrogenation efficiency in the surface reaction presented for the bimetallic Pd-Fe catalyst."
