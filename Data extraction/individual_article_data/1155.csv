0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of the population, global energy consumption is increasing commensurately. Lignocellulosic biomass is the world's largest and one of the most promising alternative feedstock for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel/ biogasoline and biochemicals like cellulosic bioethanol and biobutanol [1,2]. Lignocellulose is a structural part of the plant cell wall and mainly composed of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Lignin is a heterogeneous aromatic polymer synthesized from coniferyl, p-coumaryl, and sinapyl alcohols. The resulting recalcitrant polymer protects cellulose from biodegradation [1,2]. Thus, lignin degradation has become a key goal in recent years to improve the use of lignocellulosic biomass for industrial purposes. Despite the recalcitrance, many organisms such as bacteria and fungi are able to degrade the lignin and lignin-related compounds such as veratryl alcohol, guaiacol, syringol, syringaldehyde, etc. [3–5]. Fungal systems have been extensively studied for lignin degradation and they have different types of oxidative enzymes such as lignin peroxidases (LiP), manganese peroxidases (MnP), versatile peroxidases (VP), and laccases that can efficiently oxidize the lignin polymer but are limited to industrial biotechnology [6,7]. In comparison to fungal enzymes, bacterial enzymes are less widely investigated and characterized in terms of lignin degradation. Some earlier published studies showed that some bacterial enzymes such as the so-called ALiP from Streptomyces viridisporus T7A, MnP from Pseudomonas putida GB-1, and putative laccases and peroxidases from Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 are involved in lignin degradation [8,9]. Additionally, DyPs (Dye-decolorizing peroxidases), a new family of heme peroxidase, have been identified in a variety of bacteria and fungi [10,11]. DyPs received considerable attention as they have the ability to oxidize various types of dyes like Reactive Blue 19, Reactive Black 5, Methyl violet, Malachite green, ABTS, and Azure B, etc., as well as lignin-related model compounds such as veratryl alcohol, guaiacol, syringol, syringaldehyde, etc., and wheat straw lignocellulose [3,12–14]. DyPs differ substantially from well-known heme peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase and class II peroxidase regarding primary sequence, tertiary structures, catalytic residues, and substrate specificity [15,16]. According to the reports, heme peroxidases have three different substrate-binding sites, i.e., γ-edge and δ-edge of heme and surface-exposed tyrosine/tryptophan residue [5,17–19]. The δ-edge is on the heme distal side, where the electron and protons can transfer directly from the substrates to the heme [4,17]. The γ-edge is close to the heme propionate group, which allows the substrate to interact with heme through the network of hydrogen-bonds [4,18]. However, the surface-exposed substrate-interaction site based on Tyr/ Trp residues is on the surface of protein with the shortest distance from heme. The surface-exposed Tyr/Trp can withdraw the electrons from substrates and transfer them to heme via Long-range electron transfer (LRET) pathway [19]. However, the substrate-binding sites in bacterial DyPs are still unexplored and need to be determined. In our previous study, we have determined the crystal structure of BsDyP from Bacillus subtilis in complex with HEPES and proposed two substrate-binding sites [12]. In the present study, BsDyP was characterized to elucidate a third binding site for small substrates such as veratryl alcohol (VA), 2,6–dimethoxyphenol (DMP), and guaiacol. The crystal structure of VA bound BsDyP structure was determined at 2.1 Å. The kinetic study was performed with phenolic (DMP and guaiacol) and non-phenolic (VA) lignin model compounds. Subsequently, the binding affinities of substrates to BsDyP were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, computational approaches such as molecular docking and dynamics studies were utilized to examine the binding of phenolic compounds in the VA-bound active site. Outcome from the in silico studies revealed that the binding of compounds with BsDyP improves the stability of protein-ligand complexes. The current study presented here describes a substrate-binding site in BsDyP of class A-type Dye-decolorizing peroxidase and its biochemical characterization towards phenolic and non-phenolic substrates."
1,Material and methods,"Chemicals were acquired either from Sigma, Merck-Millipore, Fluka, Hi-media, or Bio-Rad; molecular biology enzymes from New England Biolabs (NEB); chromatography media and columns from GE Healthcare; B. subtilis strain was obtained from MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh, India; while Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5α and BL21 (DE3) strains and cloning & expression plasmids from Novagen (USA)."
2,Purification of BsDyP,"2.1 Purification of BsDyP The formerly cloned BsDyP was expressed and purified, as mentioned previously [12]. Briefly, the recombinant enzyme was over-expressed using 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), an inducer in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Additionally, hemin was added to support heme incorporation into the protein. For protein purification, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd., Daventry, England) at 20 kpsi pressure. Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was performed to purify the soluble recombinant protein from cell debris with a stepwise gradient of imidazole in lysis buffer. The fractions containing purified recombinant protein were concentrated up to 15 mg/ml using an Amicon 10 kDa Millipore filter, and the purity of enzyme was assessed by examining the Reinheitszahl value (Rz)."
3,Crystallization of BsDyP and data collection,"2.2 Crystallization of BsDyP and data collection The BsDyP protein was concentrated up to 15 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and 200 mM NaCl. The crystallization experiments were carried out using sitting drop diffusion method in a 96-well plate at 293 K. The BsDyP protein was crystallized by mixing protein solution and the reservoir solution (25% 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0)) in 1:1 ratio. To prepare the complex, crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 5 mM VA for 15 min and then flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction images were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. The data were processed and scaled using the autoprocessing suites of synchrotron beamlines, including XDS and AIMLESS [20,21]. The data quality was evaluated using PHENIX.XTRIAGE and data collection parameters are mentioned in Table 1 ."
4,Structure determination and refinement,"2.3 Structure determination and refinement The initial phases of BsDyP were acquired by a molecular replacement with MOLREP of CCP4i suite using a single chain coordinates of DyP from B. subtilis (PDB ID: 6KMM) as a template [22]. The refinement was done using REFMAC5 of the CCP4i suite and iterative model building was done using COOT followed by adding ligands and solvent [22,23]. The quality of the final refined model was validated with MolProbity. Furthermore, the final structure was examined and figures were generated using PyMOL [24]. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. CAVER version 3.0.3 was used to calculate the dimensions of the distal channel [25]. In addition, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed with homologs structures of DyP using Clustal omega and analyzed using EsPript3 [26,27]."
5,Optimum pH determination and steady-state kinetics,"2.4 Optimum pH determination and steady-state kinetics Enzyme activity of BsDyP against different substrates such as VA, DMP, and guaiacol, was measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by observing the changes in the absorbance at their specific wavelength. The assay reaction consisted of 50 mM of buffer, 0.7 mM H2O2, various substrates concentrations, and protein. The optimum pH of BsDyP for the oxidation of substrates was assessed at different pH of buffers such as glycine-HCl (pH 2.0), sodium citrate (pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0), sodium phosphate (pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0), and bicine (pH 9.0). The addition of H2O2 initiated the reactions and all reactions were carried out in triplicates. In a similar way, controls were performed without protein, H2O2, and both. The oxidation of each substrate was determined and the pH that permitted maximum activity was considered to be 100%. Steady-state experiments were carried out at different concentrations of substrates with a fixed concentration of H2O2 and protein. The oxidation of VA, DMP, and guaiacol were assayed at pH 4.0 and monitored by the formation of products at their specific wavelengths using their molar absorbance: VA (veratraldehyde formation, ε310 = 9300 M−1 cm−1), DMP (dimeric quinone derivate formation, ε469 = 27,500 M−1 cm−1); guaiacol (tetraguaiacol formation, ε470 = 26,600 M−1 cm−1). By means of non-linear regression, the obtained data were fitted into the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the kinetic parameters."
6,Binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),"2.5 Binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) The isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to determine the binding affinity of BsDyP with different substrates (VA, DMP, and guaiacol) using MicroCal-iTC200 instrument (GE Healthcare). All titrations were conducted in the sodium citrate buffer of pH 4.0 with 100 mM NaCl at 25 °C. The titrations were carried out by injecting a series of ligands solution (0.5 μl for the first injection followed by 16 injections of 2.2 μl) into the 50 μM protein with a 150 s interval time between two injections. The data were analyzed using program Origin software Version 5.0 (Malvern). The binding stoichiometry (n), the association constant (K a), the enthalpy change (ΔH), and the entropy change (ΔS) were derived from the fitted curve. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was calculated by the following equation: (1) ∆ G = − Rtln K a = ∆ H − T ∆ S where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔS is the entropy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, and T is the temperature (298 K)."
7,Circular dichroism (CD) studies,"2.6 Circular dichroism (CD) studies CD spectroscopy was carried out using JASCO J-Model-1500 spectrophotometer integrated with a Peltier temperature control device. The far-UV CD spectra were obtained in the range of 200–250 nm using a quartz cuvette with a light path of 1 mm. The concentration of BsDyP was kept at 0.8 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 containing 100 mM NaCl. All substrates (VA, DMP, and guaiacol) were also prepared in the same buffer. The effect of pH on the conformation of BsDyP was studied using buffers of different pH (citrate buffer for pH 4.0, phosphate buffer for pH 7.0, and bicine buffer for pH 9.0). Additionally, the conformational changes in BsDyP due to the presence of substrates were examined at pH 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0. Three parallel scans were recorded for each reaction, and then the final averaged spectrum was used for analysis. The experimental results were corrected by deducting the control data collected under the same conditions but without protein. The outcomes of all examined data were represented as MRE [θ] in deg.cm2.dmol−1, which is determined by the equation. (2) θ mrw , λ = θ λ × MRW / 10 × p × c where, θ λ is the observed ellipticity (mdeg) at wavelength λ, MRW is the mean residue weight (Molecular weight of protein in Da/no. of residues −1), p is the path length (cm), and c is the concentration (g/ml)."
8,Molecular docking studies,"2.7 Molecular docking studies The docking study of BsDyP with different substrates (VA, DMP, and guaiacol) was performed by using AutoDock Tools [28]. The chain C of BsDyP structure complexed with VA was considered as a receptor protein and prepared by the addition of hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges (9.752) using AutoDock MGL Tools [28]. Polar hydrogen atoms and Gasteiger charges were added on VA, DMP, and guaiacol. Receptor protein and ligand were converted into .pdbqt format. The molecular grid was created on the nearby residues of the bound VA using AutoGrid4. The grid box dimensions were 40 × 40 × 40 Å, with a default space value of 0.375. Total one hundred conformations for each substrate were generated using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm and each conformation was analyzed using PyMOL, as done by Dhankhar et al. [29]. Based on the binding energy and interactions, the best conformation was selected and figures were prepared using PyMOL and Maestro (53, Schrödinger Release 2017–4: Maestro, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017) [24]."
9,Molecular dynamics,"2.8 Molecular dynamics The molecular dynamics simulation of BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand(s) complex was done using pmemd with AMBER ff14SB force field in AMBER package at different pH (4.0, 7.0, and 9.0) [30]. The protonation states of the BsDyP residues were computed by the H++ server (http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/) at three different pH (4.0, 7.0, and 9.0) and the resulted protein was used for molecular simulation [31]. In Amber Tools19, antechamber and parmchk2 were used to generate the parameters and topology files of ligands (VA, DMP, and guaiacol) [32,33]. The antechamber module was used to calculate the AM1-BCC charges and GAFF force field parameters of the ligands. The systems were solvated in the TIP3P water model in a cubic box of volume (635,456.847 A3) using the Tleap module. The minimum distance between box and closest atom of the protein is 10 Å and counter ions (Cl−) was added to neutralize the system. The systems were energy minimized with steepest descent algorithm for 10,000 cycles along with position restraints of kcal−1 Å−2. The minimized systems were heated gradually from 0 K to 300 K in 500 ps. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to calculate electrostatic interactions [34]. Langevin thermostat was used to regulate the temperature during molecular dynamics [35]. The systems were equilibrated for 500 ps followed by 2 ns at NPT without restraints. The final molecular dynamics were run for 100 ns and the coordinates were generated at every 10 ps. The molecular dynamics trajectories were analyzed using cpptraj and VMD [36]."
10,Results and discussion,"Over the past few years, dye decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) have gained considerable attention in the field of bioremediation, because of its oxidizing property towards xenobiotics like dyes (azo and anthraquinone) and phenolic compounds such as guaiacol and DMP [37,38]. Certain DyP-type peroxidase oxidizes the lignin model compounds such as veratryl alcohol and guaiacyl-glycerol-β-guaiacyl-ether [37–39]. However, in bacterial DyPs, the binding site of small substrate molecules has yet to be examined. Our previous study reveals two potential substrate-binding sites, namely as γ-edge and exposed Tyr/Trp residues for the bulky substrates in B. subtilis DyP (BsDyP) [12]. However, our present study provides insight into the binding and interactions of small molecules such as VA, DMP, and guaiacol in DyP structure."
11,Purification of BsDyP,"3.1 Purification of BsDyP The recombinant protein, BsDyP with N-terminal 6xHis-tag, was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with a stepwise gradient of imidazole in the purification buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the molecular weight and purity of the purified protein. Fig. S1 showed a single band of ~41 kDa size of protein, consistent with the estimated value. The Reinheitszahl value (Rz) of pure BsDyP protein was found to be 1.86, similar to our earlier reported value [12]."
12,Overall structure,"3.2 Overall structure The complex structure of BsDyP with VA was determined at 2.1 Å resolution and data was indexed in the P1 space group. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a single chain coordinates of BsDyP-HEPES bound structure (PDB ID: 6KMM) as a search model. The resulting BsDyP-VA model was refined to a Rcryst and Rfree to 18.5 and 24.9%, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are represented in Table 1. The complex structure of BsDyP with VA contains six molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are arranged as a trimer of a dimer. The superposition of one subunit with another demonstrates that all six subunits are identical with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values less than 0.23 Å over 320 Cα atoms. The overall structural organization and arrangement of heme surrounding conserved residues are same as the previously reported [12]. Each monomer of BsDyP structure comprises 9 β-strands and 15 α-helices with ferredoxin-like folds, similar to other DyP structures [40]. The BsDyP monomer subunit is formed by N- and C-terminal domains and harbors a heme in the C-terminal domain that is surrounded by conserved residues Asp187, His273, and Arg286, as mentioned in the previous paper [12]."
13,Substrate binding site,"3.3 Substrate binding site In our previous study, the crystal structure of HEPES bound BsDyP described the two potential substrate-binding sites. Here, the complex crystal structure of BsDyP-VA divulged that the VA molecule is bound close to the δ-edge of heme in subunits C and E. Of these, subunit C was considered for further analysis of BsDyP active site (Fig. 1a and b), whereas the subunits A, B, D, and F, have weak electron density to model the VA molecule at the same position. Consequently, water molecules were substituted instead of the VA molecule in these four subunits. In addition to present complex structure of BsDyP with VA, the structure of other heme peroxidases, e.g., unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) has been reported with VA, bound at the distal side of heme [41]. Besides UPO, different types of heme peroxidases viz. cytochrome c peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, GcoA were available in a complex form with small aromatic compounds at the distal heme side [18,40,42,43]. Furthermore, visual examination of our VA-bound BsDyP structure revealed that amino acids Asp187, Arg286, and Arg288, along with water molecules (W812, W813, and W903), stabilized VA at the active site of BsDyP through a hydrogen bond network, as shown in Fig. 1c. The other VA vicinity amino acids, His20, Leu170, Pro179, Gly188, Asn191, and Arg287, are involved in hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1d). The structural comparison of BsDyP-VA-bound subunit with BsDyP-HEPES subunit revealed that VA binding does not lead to substantial structural rearrangements in the surrounding amino acids, as shown in Fig. S2. The residues, His20, Leu170, Pro179, Asp187, Gly188, Asn191, Arg286, Arg287, and Arg288, are found in 4 Å vicinity of VA (Fig. 1d). It is to be noted that, Asp187, Gly188, and Arg286 are conserved in all classes of DyPs, while Leu170, Pro179, and Arg287 are conserved in only class A-type (Fig. 1e). The aforementioned heme peroxidases also have a channel enclosing a similar type of binding site, which is perpendicular to distal side of the heme. However, the width of this channel varies with the enzyme. Moreover, this distal channel has been reported in all classes of DyPs that enables the binding of the substrate from where electron or proton can transfer to heme [4,5,44]. The bottleneck radius of this distal heme access channel in BsDyP is 1.4 Å (calculated by CAVER), while in class C and D-type DyP structures (PDB ID: 5C2I, 4UZI, 6FSK), it is in the range of 1.49–1.85 Å. The analysis demonstrates that BsDyP provides ample space to bind VA and other small substrates (DMP and guaiacol) within their heme chambers. Overall, these findings from complex crystal structure highlight the third substrate-binding site, i.e., δ-edge of heme."
14,Optimum pH determination and steady-state kinetics,"3.4 Optimum pH determination and steady-state kinetics Furthermore, the pH dependence on BsDyP activity depicted the optimum pH for the oxidation of phenolic compounds (DMP and guaiacol) and non-phenolic compound (VA) (Fig. 2a). The results revealed that the optimum pH is 4.0 for the enzyme's maximum activity towards phenolic compounds (DMP and guaiacol) and non-phenolic compound (VA), although the enzyme is active in a wide range of pH from pH 2.0 to pH 9.0, as shown in Fig. 2a. The BsDyP retained 40% and 10.9% of peak activity to oxidize VA at pH 2.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. For the oxidation of DMP, the enzyme retained only 10.4% and 3.8% of its activity at pH 2.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. In guaiacol oxidation, the enzyme retained 23.7% and 13.8% of its activity at pH 2.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. Likewise, similar and acidic pH was reported for guaiacol oxidation by DyP from Escherichia coli O157 and slightly more acidic by some other DyPs. While for the oxidation of DMP, pH 4.5 was reported as the optimizing pH in DyP from Auricularia auricula-judae and Exidia glandulosa, and more acidic pH in DyP from Bjerkandera adusta [4,38]. Acidic pH optima were reported for VA oxidation by DyP from A. auricula-judae and Exidia glandulosa, as well as by other peroxidases (LiP, VP, and MnP) [38,45,46]. Moreover, the catalytic properties demonstrate that BsDyP shows the comparable catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) for DMP, guaiacol, and VA by following the order: VA > guaiacol >DMP (Table 2 and Fig. 2b, c, and d). The Michaelis constant (Km) for VA, DMP, and guaiacol was found to be 6.51 × 10−5 M, 8.08 × 10−5 M, and 7.68 × 10−5 M, respectively. The k cat values of BsDyP for VA, DMP, and guaiacol were 0.065 s−1, 0.069 s−1, and 0.069 s−1, respectively. The resulting catalytic efficiency showed that DMP and guaiacol, which serve as classical peroxidase substrates, are oxidized by BsDyP. The observed activity is comparative to VcDyP and myoglobin but lower than DyPs [4,47,48]. Likewise, BsDyP possesses activity to oxidize the VA, but lower than fungal DyPs except for DyP from Geotrichum candidum [47–49]. Overall, our biochemical investigation indicates that the BsDyP is able to oxidize the phenolic compounds (DMP and guaiacol) and non-phenolic compound (VA) although with low efficiency."
15,Binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry,"3.5 Binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed to study the binding interaction between BsDyP and different compounds (VA, DMP, and guaiacol). Fig. 3a, b, and c, represent the binding isotherm of VA, DMP, and guaiacol binding to BsDyP at 25 °C. Further, thermodynamics parameters, including entropy, enthalpy, association constant, and binding stoichiometry, were directly estimated by fitting the titration curves. Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) can be calculated according to the equation ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. Table 3 showed that the interaction of VA, DMP, and guaiacol to BsDyP occurred with Kd values of 55.8, 78.7, and 71.4 μM, respectively. Our results demonstrated that all the compounds have similar binding enthalpy (ΔH) and also have no major changes in the entropy of binding (ΔS). The association constant (Ka) suggests the moderate binding affinity of VA, DMP, and guaiacol to BsDyP. The ITC data supports our kinetic results and indicates that the binding of all compounds to BsDyP is a spontaneous and favorable reaction."
16,Circular dichroism studies,"3.6 Circular dichroism studies Conformational changes in the secondary structure of BsDyP induced by the binding of substrates were assessed at pH 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0 by far-UV CD spectra, as shown in Fig. S3a. Analysis of spectra illustrates that alkaline and acidic pH have no measurable impact on the secondary structure content and spectra of BsDyP. Furthermore, the substrates binding at pH 4.0 and 7.0 have induced minor changes in helical content of BsDyP by increasing the signals at both minima, 210 and 220 nm (Fig. S3b and c). Although binding of the substrate at pH 4.0, also resulting in the shift of maxima peak, i.e., around 197 nm. While the substrates binding at pH 9.0 in Fig. S3d brought some changes in the signals of around 210 nm minima, which leads to no significant conformational changes in BsDyP. The results indicate that the binding of substrates leads to conformational changes in the secondary structure of BsDyP and supports the biochemical activity at pH 4.0."
17,Molecular docking,"3.7 Molecular docking The molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding of DMP and guaiacol at the active site of BsDyP where VA was observed in the crystal structure. The VA was re-docked in the active site, i.e., δ-edge of heme using AutoDock Tools and resulting in a binding affinity of −4.4 kcal/mol. The docking of DMP and guaiacol into the VA-binding site of BsDyP reveals that both DMP and guaiacol are nicely mapped on VA of the crystal structure with comparable binding energy, as enlisted in Table S1, which is consistent with results of ITC. The analysis of VA binding mode into the active site (δ-edge) of BsDyP reveals that amino acid residues (Asp187, Arg286, and Ala288) are contributed to the formation of three hydrogen bonds with VA. Moreover, BsDyP-VA complex is also stabilized by π-π stacked and π-alkyl bonds with His20 and Pro179, respectively (Fig. 1d). The interaction analysis of DMP discloses the binding energy of −3.7 kcal/mol and displayed two hydrogen bonds with Arg286 and Ala288 and one π-alkyl bond with Pro179 (Fig. 4a and c). On the analysis of BsDyP-guaiacol complex, it is found that guaiacol has shown comparable binding affinity (−4.0 kcal/mol) and showed two hydrogen bonds with Asp187 and Asn191 (Fig. 4b). Further analysis showed that Arg287 and Ala288 residues are involved in the formation of π-alkyl bonds and His20 contributed to π-π T-shaped bond formation (Fig. 4d). Comprehensively, our finding suggested that δ-edge of heme is the substrate-binding site for small compounds similar to VA."
18,Molecular dynamics,"3.8 Molecular dynamics Molecular dynamics was performed to determine the variation at atomistic level in BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes. The molecular dynamics of BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol were carried out at pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 9.0 for 100 ns. Several different molecular dynamics analysis, such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bond numbers, were analyzed to assess the stability of BsDyP-ligand complex at different pH. The RMSD was generated to determine the atomistic dynamics movements and conformational variations of Cα backbone atoms of BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand complex. The RMSD plots for BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol, as shown in Fig. 5 . BsDyP-Native is stable from pH 4.0 to pH 9.0, but it is least stable at pH 9.0, as shown in Fig. 5a. From Fig. 5b, c, and d, it can be clearly seen that BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes are stable at acidic as well as basic pH. However, BsDyP-ligand complexes are more stable at pH 4.0 as compared to pH 7.0 and pH 9.0. At pH 4.0, the average RMSD of BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complex is 2.10 ± 0.31, 2.11 ± 0.22, 2.08 ± 0.24, and 2.05 ± 0.26 Å, respectively. While the average RMSD of BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes at pH 7.0 is in the range of 2.36 ± 0.18 to 2.68 ± 0.18 Å, as shown in Table S2. The average RMSD results indicate that the binding of VA, DMP, and guaiacol at the active site of BsDyP is stable and formed a higher stable BsDyP-ligand(s) complex than BsDyP-Native. RMSD results indicate that BsDyP protein is stable at different pH, i.e., pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 9.0. Further, RMSD results reveal that BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes are more stable at pH 4.0. The radius of gyration was calculated to determine the compactness of BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes. It is already known that stably folded proteins exhibit a lesser Rg, an indication of compactness and dynamics stability. The Rg results showed that BsDyP-Native is least stable at pH 9.0 as compared to pH 4.0 and pH 7.0, as shown in Fig. 5e. The binding of ligands with BsDyP results in the formation of compact and stable BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0, as shown in Fig. 5f, g, and h. However, BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes are well stable at pH 4.0 as compared to pH 7.0 and pH 9.0, as shown in Fig. 5f, g, and h and Table S2. Therefore, Rg results illustrated that binding of VA, DMP, and guaiacol with BsDyP results in the formation of more stable BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes at pH 4.0 than pH 7.0 and pH 9.0. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of protein is the surface area of protein covered by solvent, which can directly assess the compactness of the protein. The SASA plots of BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes are shown in Fig. 5i–l. Our results indicate that BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes are more compact as compared to BsDyP-Native (Fig. 5i, j, k, and l and Table S2). The average SASA values of BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes are in the range of 16,186.22 ± 79.82 and 15,649.24 ± 101.12 Å2 (Table S2). The SASA results affirmed that BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes are more stable and compact at pH 4.0 than pH 7.0 and pH 9.0. Hydrogen bond numbers were determined to assess the stability of BsDyP-Native and BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes during the molecular simulation. The intra hydrogen bond plots of BsDyP-Native, BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complex are shown in Fig. 5m–p. BsDyP-ligand(s) complex sustained a high number of hydrogen bonds at pH 4.0 compared to pH 7.0 and pH 9.0. The average number of hydrogen bonds of BsDyP-Native at pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 9.0 are 348.55 ± 8.64, 343.49 ± 8.73, and 329.63 ± 8.79, respectively. BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes exhibit a higher average number of hydrogen bonds at pH 4.0 in the range of 357.71 ± 10.37 to 360.74 ± 8.45 than pH 7.0 (353.28 ± 8.92 to 356.10 ± 8.73) and pH 9.0 (344.07 ± 9.04 to 346.46 ± 9.51) (Table S2). Hydrogen bonding results confirmed that the binding of ligands to BsDyP forms the highest stable BsDyP-ligand(s) complexes. Further, the stabilities of BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complex were investigated by measuring distances between the center of mass (CoM) of substrates (VA, DMP, and guaiacol) with Asp187, a key residue of BsDyP. Over the simulation of 100 ns, all substrate distances were constants to Asp187 of BsDyP, as shown in Fig. S4. The average CoM distance between VA, DMP, and guaiacol to Asp187 were 5.34 ± 0.04, 6.25 ± 0.03, and 5.02 ± 0.05 Å. The study of ligand interactions with protein from coordinates generated at the different time intervals of molecular dynamics is an important and widely used approach to assess the stability of protein-ligand complexes [50–53]. We have retrieved the molecular dynamics trajectories of BsDyP-VA, BsDyP-DMP, and BsDyP-guaiacol complexes at the regular time intervals (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ns), as shown in Fig. S5. The snapshots results displayed that substrates had stable interactions at the active site of BsDyP and formed stable BsDyP-substrate(s) complexes."
19,Conclusions,"In this study, the complexed crystal structure of DyP was crystallized and analyzed. Our biochemical and biophysical investigation reveals the ability of BsDyP for the oxidation of phenolic compounds (DMP and guaiacol) as well as non-phenolic compound (VA), although the oxidation efficiency is low as compared to other peroxidases. Together, structural, biochemical, and computational work inferred that a third substrate-binding site at the δ-edge of heme in BsDyP accommodating the above substrates (phenolic and non-phenolic) for oxidation. We hypothesize that the utility of BsDyP for various types of substrates can be further extended by protein engineering."
