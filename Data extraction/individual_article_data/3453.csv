0,Introduction,"It is estimated that for each ton of processed cassava, up to three hundred liters of liquid effluent are produced, and up to 20 m³ for each ton of starch produced (Chavalparit and Ongwandee, 2009). The cassava wastewater is a residue rich in carbohydrates and is therefore characterized as a substrate with high potential for organic production of hydrogen (Torres et al., 2017). The presence of various nutrients in this effluent, such as nitrogen and phosphorus enhance their potential as a substrate in fermentation processes. On the other hand, this waste can cause serious environmental damage if they are not treated before disposal (Lucas et al., 2015; Kummer et al., 2016), such as contamination and eutrophication of water bodies, in addition to soil poisoning. It has a biochemical oxygen demand of 25000–50000 mg/L and high concentration cyanogenic glycosides (approximately 400 mg/L) that can be hydrolyzed to cyanide in liquid waste (FAO, 2011; Kaewkannetra et al., 2009). In this perspective, anaerobic biodigestion has been widely used in the treatment of various organic wastes, combining reductions in the pollution load of effluents with the recovery of bioenergy through the production of hydrogen and biomethane (Palma et al., 2018). Countries in increasing economic and energy expansion have substantially increased their biodiesel production, principally encouraged by the creation of specific legislations (Cremonez et al., 2015). In the biodiesel production process, 10 kg of glycerol is produced for every 100 kg of biofuel (Hazimah et al., 2003). Pure and refined glycerol has lots of industrial applications in the food, paints and dyes, cosmetics and medicines sectors, although, crude glycerol from biodiesel production contains many impurities such as water, catalysts, alcohol, fatty acids and soaps, that make it an environmentally liability and difficult it application (Santibañez et al., 2011; Yazdani and Gonzalez 2007; López et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2012). In addition to its high calorific value, glycerol has the advantages of being highly digestible and easily stored for long periods (Serrano et al., 2014). Seeking for a higher energy yield in anaerobic digestion, many researchers have added the residual glycerol as additive to the substrate, having as results a considerable increases in the volume of biogas produced (Astals et al., 2013; Martín et al., 2013; Athanasoulia et al., 2014; Nartker et al., 2014; Rivero et al., 2014; Serrano et al., 2014; Heydt et al., 2015; Cremonez et al., 2016). Moreover there is a growing search for new inocula capable of metabolizing the substrate in high volumes of hydrogen gas, being the cost and its availability for large-scale application the main factors that should be considered in this search (Gomes et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2017; Estevam et al., 2018). Studies that involve the biodigestion of cassava wastewater generally employ as inoculum the sludge from industrial lagoons used in the treatment of fecal effluents (Nartker et al., 2014; Gomes et al., 2015). The advantage is that its microorganisms are already adapted to the environment (Gomes et al., 2016). Aiming at hydrogen production, some authors have been using sludge from wastewater treatment (Rosa et al., 2014b; Silva et al., 2018) and reach good results. The use of swine wastewater as inoculum has already been used in some studies aiming at the production of methane by anaerobic biodigestion (Cremonez et al., 2016; De Rossi et al., 2017); however, few studies that used this inoculum for the production of hydrogen was found in the literature (Wagner et al., 2009 ). Swine wastewater has great potential as inoculum since it can contain a consortium of microorganisms, both strict and tolerant anaerobes (Sinha and Pandey, 2011), in addition to being generated in large quantities in Brazil, in particular in the western region of Paraná (Coimbra-Araújo et al., 2014). Another interesting characteristic of the swine wastewater treatment sludge is that microorganisms present in this sludge are affected by the cyanide in the manipueira, besides to being able to metabolize it (Glanpracha and Annachhatre, 2016). Thus, the objective of this work was to maximize the production of hydrogen from the anaerobic biodigestion of the cassava wastewater with additions of glycerol, using inoculum from swine wastewater."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrate for biodigestion,"2.1 Substrate for biodigestion In the conduction of this study, we used residual glycerol and cassava as substrate for the anaerobic digestion. The glycerol was collected at the Federal University of Paraná - Sector Palotina - and comes from the production of biodiesel with residual oil from the cooking of food by homogeneous alkaline catalysis. This raw material presents residues such as sodium hydroxide and methanol, which ultimately make its reuse unfeasible and turn glycerol into an environmental stalemate if discarded incorrectly. Methanol is toxic to a large part of the process microorganisms, so before allocating glycerol to the assays, it was subjected to heating under temperature of 85 °c for removal of all the alcohol present in the sample. The cassava wastewater comes from a cassava processing industry located in the municipality of Terra Roxa - PR, Brazil. The inoculum used in the reactors was obtained from a Canadian model biodigester operating with liquid waste from a swine farm, with capacity for 900 animals, located in the municipality of Palotina-PR, Brazil. The inoculum was subjected to heat treatment of 100 °C for a period of 30 min, as recommended track by Chang et al. (2011) and Pendyala et al. (2012). The thermal pretreatment is the most used technology for the treatment of mixed microflora when you have interest in hydrogen-producing acidogenic bacteria (Wong et al., 2014; Zumar Bundhoo et al., 2015)."
3,Biodigesters,"2.2 Biodigesters The biodigesters were made of polyethylene terephthalate material with dimensions of 40 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter, with a total volume of 2.00 L. The useful volume stipulated for the development of the experiment was 1.6 L, maintaining a dead volume of 20% of the reactor, avoiding a possible foam formation or pressure to cause backflow at the gas collection outlet. The gasometers were made using the same material as the reactors, with dimensions of 30 cm in height by 8 cm in diameter, presenting a useful volume of approximately 1.50 L. These gasometers were immersed in a seal of saline acid solution of sodium chloride and sulfuric acid in order to prevent the escape of the gas produced, besides preventing the dissolution of carbon dioxide present in biogas."
4,Biodigesters for destructive samples,"2.3 Biodigesters for destructive samples To follow the initial degradation profile of the substrates, replicas of the biodigesters used for hydrogen production were made, but with a total volume of 0.30 L, containing samples of more inoculum substrate, the same proportions of the previous reactors and with 20% of dead volume, thus presenting useful volume of 0.24 L. These reactors contained a gas outlet hose immersed in an aqueous solution where the generated gas bubbles so that oxygen does not enter the system. Both the biodigesters used in the hydrogen production experiments and the replicas used to obtain the destructive samples were placed in a controlled temperature oven according to the experimental design and with a variation of ±1.0 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The hydraulic retention time used was 90 h, based on the period when biogas production ceased."
5,Experimental design for the study of hydrogen production,"2.4 Experimental design for the study of hydrogen production To determine the optimal conditions for hydrogen production by considering the volumetric ratio of cassava wastewater and glycerol, and the temperature, a factorial design 32 was performed using the Software Statistica v. 7.0. The sum of the components of the mixture was always equal to 1, or 100%, with the percentage of the cassava wastewater varying from 95 to 99% and the percentages of residual glycerol from 1 to 5%. Three repetitions were also performed at the central point. These concentration limits were defined based on the results found in the literature for the use of glycerol as an additive in biodigestion processes (Nartker et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2018; Astals et al., 2013; Serrano et al., 2014; Athanasoulia et al., 2014). On the other hand, the temperature, one of the parameters that most affect the biodigestion process, varied from 37 to 43 °C, comprising temperatures in the mesophilic and thermophilic range. In addition to these treatments, the manipulator was biodigested without adding residual glycerol at the same temperatures defined in the design. The volume of hydrogen produced, the concentration of hydrogen, the kinetic parameters of biodigestion (total volume of hydrogen, time of duration of the lag phase and maximum specific speed), and the percentages of initial content removal of total reducing sugar (TRS), total solids (TS) content and volatile solids (VS) content, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were evaluated through the experimental planning. After analyzing the response variables obtained experimentally, we used the adjustment tool “desirability” of the Statistica 7.0 software to obtain the temperature and percentage of glycerol in order to obtain the highest production of hydrogen. Once the optimized conditions were obtained, tests were performed in triplicate in order to compare the experimental results with those predicted by the model."
6,Microbiological characterization of the inoculum,"2.5 Microbiological characterization of the inoculum The isolation of microorganisms was directed to those that are anaerobes and mesophilic. Thus, 200 μL of the inoculum were inoculated in a test tube containing 10 mL of medium LB (Luria Bertani) liquid and incubated in anaerobiosis jar for 48 h at 35 °C in an oven BOD for the enrichment of the sample and selection of microorganisms tolerant to anaerobiosis. From this cultivation, isolated colonies were transferred through a microbiological handle for Petri plates containing LB agar medium. The plates were incubated in anaerobic jar for 48 h at 35 °C. After cultivation, isolated colonies were purified by the technique of exhaustion in plaques in LB agar medium for 48 h at 35 °C. From the isolated colonies, bacteria were grown in LB liquid medium, again for 24 h at 35 °C and subjected to DNA extraction. For the molecular analysis, 1.5 mL of bacterial cultures were grown to stationary phase and centrifuged for 4 min at 12,000×g, at room temperature. The precipitate of cells obtained was used for the extraction of total DNA Wizard (Promega®) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. After extraction, the DNA was quantified by electrophoresis in agarose gel by comparison with 5 μL (1 μg) of 100 bp DNA ladder pattern. The PCR for partial amplification of 16S rRNA gene, was performed with the universal primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT), which proved to be useful in establishing phylogenetic relationships among species of Eubacteria (Weisburg et al., 1991). The reaction conditions were one step at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s for denaturing, 51 °C for 40 s for annealing of primers and 72 °C for 1 min for the extension, as well as a final step for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR reaction with a final volume of 30 μL was performed in a Thermocycler SimpliAmp Applied Biosystems brand®. The quantities of reagents used in PCR were those recommended by the manufacturer of the enzyme Taq DNA polymerase and are represented below: 3 μL of Buffer 10 × 1 μl of solution of dNTP (10 mM each base), 0.5 μL of MgCl2+ (25 mM), 1 μL of each of the two primers (10 mM), 0.5 μL of Taq DNA Polymerase (5 U/μL), 3 μL of DNA (10 ng/μL) and ultrapure water to complete the final volume. The confirmation of the gene amplification occurred through the presence of a band of 1500 pb in 1% agarose gel prepared with TBE 1X. The PCR product was purified using methodology with PEG 8000 and prepared for sending to company specialized in automated DNA sequencing, using the direct primer (F). The sequences were analyzed with the algorithm nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) at the site of the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) to find similar sequences. The sequences selected in BLAST were used for the alignment and editing the bases sequenced incorrectly. After editing, sequences were analyzed again in BLAST for molecular identification of the isolated species."
7,Physico-chemical analysis of substrates and effluents from biodigesters,"2.6 Physico-chemical analysis of substrates and effluents from biodigesters The physical-chemical analyses of the biodigester substrates were conducted according to the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA; AWWA; WEF, 1995), and the initial content of total reducing sugar (TRS), total solids (TS) content and volatile solids (VS) content, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were evaluated, as well as their removal. All analyses were performed in triplicate. The volume of biogas generated in the biodigesters was quantified by measuring the vertical displacement of the gasometers and subsequent correction for Normal Temperature and Pressure Conditions (NTP). The determination of the hydrogen content and volume was determined by collections in 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, and the weighted average was calculated. Gas chromatography was used to determine the composition of the biogas and the volume of hydrogen produced. A Shimadzu® 2010 system was employed, equipped with Carboxen™-1010 Capillary portion GC column, using argon as a gas transporter. The temperature of the injector was adjusted to 200 °C and the detection was performed in a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at a temperature of 230 °C (Penteado et al., 2013). The efficiency of the conversion of organic matter into hydrogen was calculated through the ratio between the volume of hydrogen produced and the removal of COD at the end of the biodigestion process. The quantification of the organic acids in the liquid phase (acetic, butyric, propionic, formic and lactic) was performed varying the concentration of glycerol in the temperature of 40 °C because it resulted in higher hydrogen production. The analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a Shimadzu® system equipped with Aminex® HP-87H column and UV detector with SPD-20A diode arrangement in wavelength of 208 nm. The mobile phase was composed of acidified ultrapure water with 0.005 M (Penteado et al., 2013; Lazaro et al., 2012)."
8,Study of hydrogen production kinetics,"2.7 Study of hydrogen production kinetics The nonlinear Gompertz model (Equation (1)) was adjusted to the kinetics of hydrogen production. This model has been used repeatedly to describe the kinetics of biogas production in processes of anaerobic biodigestion (Donoso-Bravo et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012 Parameswaran and Rittmann, 2012), and recently also used to describe the kinetics of hydrogen production (Silva et al., 2018). (1) M ( t ) = A e x p [ − e x p ( μ m a x A e ( λ − t ) + 1 ) ] Where: M(t) - the volume of biogas (mL) produced over time t (h); A – maximum biogas volume (mL); μ m a x - maximum specific speed (mL.h−1); λ – lag phase duration (h)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of inoculum and substrate,"3.1 Characterization of inoculum and substrate Table 1 shows the results of the initial characterization of the substrates and inoculum used in the experiments. The pH of the cassava wastewater, the main component of the tested mixtures, presented values that indicate acidity of the reaction medium, and it was considered appropriate for digestion focused on the production of hydrogen. The pH values in the range of 5–6 are considered by Guo et al. (2010) to be ideal to avoid the methanogenic phase and increase the generation of hydrogen. Values in this same range were used by Silva et al. (2018) in the production of hydrogen from food residues, sewage sludge and glycerol in a two-phase reactor, in these case, the pH adjustment was necessary. Both the cassava wastewater and the glycerol are liquid effluents that contain chemical structures of easy access and degradation to the acidogenic microorganisms in their composition. They also present a high percentage of volatile solids among the total fraction of solids (93.6% and 90.3%, respectively). These characteristics are adequate because they favor the access of microorganisms and enzymes hydrolases to organic compounds and rapid degradation of these compounds into volatile acids. The low value of the parameter Chemical Oxygen Demand of the handler makes the additive glycerol extremely important because it ensures carbohydrates to surprise the deficiency of this component in the cassava wastewater. Another factor that makes the addition of glycerol important to the process is that the presence of this compound alters the metabolic pathways of some microorganisms, consequently affecting the volatile acid profile and hydrogen yields produced. Regarding the microbiological characterization of the inoculum, four species of distinct bacteria were isolated. After DNA extraction, it was possible to amplify the 16S gene. The amplified fragments were approximately 1500 bp of length, and sequences ranging from 878 to 889 bp were obtained. The sequence revealed that one of the bacteria is part of the subgroup of Bacillus subtilis, with 100% identity with B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. velezensis and B. siamensis. While the other belongs to the Bacillus cereus subgroup, presenting 100% identity with B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis. Species in this group were found in mixed sludge from a biogas plant in a study by Ghosh et al. (2015). Bacillus subtilis have good adaptability and rapid spread (Yang et al., 2017) being widely used for their wide capacity to metabolize large amounts of substrates and produce a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes (Patel et al., 2011). Work carried out by Eder et al. (2020) performed the comparison of hydrogen production by digesting vinasse using Bacillus cereus in isolation and in consortium, obtaining positive results. Interesting results were also observed by Patel et al. (2014), showing that Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Bacillus cereus co-cultures were more efficient in the production of hydrogen than the use of isolated cultures. These Bacillus species have the ability to compete with other microorganisms to produce bioactive molecules, such as acyl-Homoserine lactonases, which ultimately contributes to their survival, when mixed cultures are used in the treatment of organic effluents, producing organic acids during their metabolism, with the release or consumption of hydrogen (kumar et al., 2015). The organic reactions of acid formation occurring in the process (glicose degradation) is described in the reactions (1) acetic acid; (2) butyric acid; (3 and 4) propionic acid (Cremonez et al., 2019). (1) C6H12O6 + H2O → 2CH3COOH + CO2 + 4H2 (2) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 (3) C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O (4) C3H6O3 + H2 → CH3CH2COOH + H2O Been identified yet, with 100% of identity, a kind of genus Brevundimonas and may be B. naejangsanensis or B. diminuta. Were found reports of production of hydrogen using the species b. limited by perform the fermentation in consortium with bacteria of the genus Bacillus (Bao et al., 2013). Been identified also the species Bacillus licheniformis (100% identity), bacteria that have been used as inoculum in isolated form for the production of hydrogen by anaerobic biodigestion, having been shown a potential inoculum for hydrogen industrial production (Srivastava et al., 2017). Although a characterized sludge was used at the beginning of the process, changes in the composition and predominance of the consortium of microorganisms can occur during the digestion process, principally because the sludge and substrate have different origins. Sinha and Pandey (2011) affirm that diversity in biomass allows greater efficiency in the production of H2 when compared to pure cultures. Rosa et al. (2014a), comparing the effect of UASB reactor inoculum for the treatment of swine waste and the same model used in the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse waste for digesting liquid residues from starch factories, found that both inocula showed satisfactory results in hydrogen production, although the best performance is observed for the inoculum of birds. A work by Glanpracha and Annachhatre (2016) performing the co-digestion of swine wastewater with cassava pulp, concluded that the studied residues can be efficiently digested without the inhibitory effect of cyanide present in the cassava pulp. Studies by Jiang et al. (2017) and Jiang et al. (2018), digesting cassava residues with mixed inoculants from a sewage treatment plant also showed positive results without inhibitions. Regarding possible inhibitions caused by residual glycerol, Astals et al. (2012) concluded that in digestion of swine wastewater with the addition of glycerol, the co-substrate has no negative impact on the quality of digestion, whereas glycerol provides several nutrients from soluble carbohydrates. Astals et al. (2013) obtained an increase in the specific production of biogas of up to 180% by adding up to 3% of glycerol in swine wastewater digesters."
11,Kinetics and hydrogen production,"3.2 Kinetics and hydrogen production The factor design used in this study resulted in 9 treatments of different compositions, including a triplicate repetition of the central point (treatment 5). The value of Snedecor’s F-distribution at a 5% probability level for this planning is 4.95. The results obtained for the volume and concentration of hydrogen produced, as well as the kinetic parameters obtained through the Gompertz equation, are presented in Table 2 . Regarding the adjustment of the Gompertz model to the experimental data, all treatments obtained an R2 value higher than 0.99. G-glycerol, T-temperature, C- volume concentration, V- hydrogen volume. Values with (∗) are averages followed by their respective standard deviations. In general, all treatments with added glycerol obtained increases in hydrogen production, the same behavior was verified by Silva et al. (2018) in a mixture of food waste and glycerol and sewage sludge as inoculum. Considering the treatment with higher volumetric production of this gas, treatment 5, the volume produced was 4.5 times that obtained at the same temperature but without the addition of glycerol. Considering the volume of residues used in the experiments, the hydrogen production varied between 168.0 and 864.6 mLH2/Lresidue. As previously cited, glycerol’s contribution to the increase in hydrogen production is mainly due to the alteration of metabolic pathways that induce butyric acid production, and consequently generate hydrogen in its reaction. The largest volumes of hydrogen were obtained using temperatures of up to 40 °C, however, the shortest duration times of the lag phase were observed in the treatments performed at 43 °C. Regarding the concentration of this component in biogas, the best results were verified at lower temperatures, and the experiments carried out at 37 °C were the ones that obtained the highest percentages. Fig. 2 shows the response surfaces for parameters: hydrogen production (2a); hydrogen concentration (2b); maximum specific speed (2c); and lag phase duration time (2d). The maximum concentration of hydrogen obtained was 46.3% in treatment 4, which contained 3% residual glycerol; however, this increase in concentration by adding glycerol was lower than the one reported by Silva et al. (2018), where concentrations of 56.4 and 54% were obtained by adding 1 and 3% of glycerol in a mixture of food waste and sewage sludge. Cremonez et al. (2016) when performing biogas production using a polymer based on cassava fecula, glycerol and wastewater inoculum from swine farming, achieved the highest methane production when using 1% glycerol as additive. At higher concentrations of glycerol (3 and 5%) there was an accumulation of volatile acids in the reactor with the consequent reduction of the pH, ceasing the biodigestion process. All results showed a decrease when the temperature increased above 41 °C. Mu et al. (2006) observed that the microbial growth rate while digesting glucose-rich substrates, increased when the temperature was modified from 33 °C to 41 °C; a similar trend is observed in the specific production of hydrogen, which, at higher temperatures, began to decrease sharply. The reduction in productivity may be a result of the denaturation of microbial enzymes, causing the death of microorganisms (Arimi et al., 2015). In support of these findings, Roy et al., (2012) state that high temperatures provide low yield in hydrogen production when compared to mesophilic phases because few species of microorganisms have the capacity to produce in thermophilic conditions. Acidogenic bacteria present rapid adaptation when compared to methanogenic microorganisms. All lag phase times (37 °C, 40 °C and 43 °C) have been less than 20 h since the beginning of the process (Fig. 3 a, b and 3c). This ensures the high activity of microorganisms, which can result in high hydrogen production even on the first day of digestion. The end of the process in 50 h is also due to the characteristic of the waste used in the current research. The handler is a residue that presents simple composition, high content of volatile solids and reducing sugars such as starch, making its assimilation by microbial cells and conversion into volatile acids easier. Despite the stabilization of the process in approximately two days of biodigestion, the consumption time of acids and production and biogas obtained in this work is much longer than other studies found in the literature. Mu et al. (2006) achieved the end of hydrogen production, performing glucose digestion in mesophilic phase, before 15 h of digestion. Wang et al. (2017), analyzing corn starch effluents, using mixed culture and operating temperature of 37 °C, had the stabilization of acumulated production in less than 30 h of digestion. Similar values were obtained in other studies that employed more complex compounds as substrate, such as lignocellulosic materials. Akobi et al. (2016) obtained stabilization in the stained production of hydrogen by digesting hydrolysates obtained from wood biomass in different stages in approximately 50 h of digestion. Kannah et al. (2018), performing rice straw digestion, obtained a latency phase time of 12 h. Also, the gas production yield increased until achieving stabilization on the fifth day of digestion. In turn, Faber and Ferreira-Leitão (2016), optimizing hydrogen production using residual glycerol from biodiesel production, obtained maximum yield after 20 h of incubation. Many studies aimed at producing hydrogen by anaerobic digestion are carried out in continuous processes. These schemes have the advantage of increasing the efficiency of digestion rates and biogas production, reducing hydraulic retention times (HRT). In the work of Dinesh et al., (2018), a literature review was performed on the various aspects of hydrogen production, quoting studies with HRTs that ranged from 1.3 to 9 days. On the other hand, the review study carried out by Arimi et al. (2015) presents a study of cases where the HRT are less than 1 h."
12,Volatile acidity behavior and organic load of effluents,"3.3 Volatile acidity behavior and organic load of effluents The production of volatile acids is an important indicator that should be followed to understand the biochemical routes and efficiency of the anaerobic digestion process. From Fig. 4 , it is possible to visualize the behavior of the generation of volatile acids in the reactors from the analysis of the destructive samples in 06, 12, 24 and 48 h of digestion. In reactors without the addition of glycerol and with the addition of 1%, the consumption of lactic acid and increasing production of formic acid are shown in the first 24 h. The propionic acid is a precursor of lactic acid, which indicates overload in the system despite its reaction to generate molecular hydrogen (Zhang et al., 2003). It happens because, in addition to the degradation of the butyric acid, it is necessary to convert the propionic acid generated into acetic acid to obtain the final product of the digestion of the acidogenic phase. Below can be viewed the volatile acid conversion reactions in the anaerobic digestion process. (2) CH3COOH → CH4 + CO2 (3) CH3CH2COOH + 4H2O → 2CH3COOH + 3H2 + 2CO2 (4) 2CH3CHOHCOOH + 2H2O → CH3COOH + CH3CH2COOH + H2 + CO2 Where: (1) conversion of acetic acid; (2) Conversion of propionic acid; (3) Conversion of lactic acid. From the data analyzed, for the treatments of higher concentrations of glycerol (3% and 5%), high propionic and butyric acid production is observed, with extremely high values until the end of the first day of digestion, decreasing considerably after 48 h. Acetic acid levels are also visualized in more significant proportions in these treatments. Some studies express that high levels of propionic and butyric acids are positively related to hydrogen production, in addition to inhibiting the development of methanogenic cultures, which would eventually consume molecular hydrogen to generate methane (Yokoi et al., 1998; Mamimin et al., 2017; Zhipeng et al., 2018). Thus, the high concentrations of propionic and butyric acids are directly related to the fact that the highest molecular hydrogen production was found in treatments with higher glycerol additions. The formation of acetic acid in these treatments is also related to the generation of molecular hydrogen. This acid is produced mainly from the reaction of propionic acid consumption, and the profile of the treatments shows that the concentration of acetic acid is increased by reducing the concentration of propionic acid. The high concentration of acids in the treatment of higher glycerol addition is also correlated with their easy absorption by bacterial cells. Glycerol is capable of entering cells through passive transport, and most of these processes occur at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Manish and Banerjee, 2008; Lo et al., 2013). The high concentration of volatile acids and the absence of the methanogenic phase in the process indicate little efficiency in the treatment of effluents, which was corroborated by the low removals of TRS, COD, TS, VS and COD conversion in hydrogen, which are also contained in Fig. 5-A, 5-B, 5- C, 5-D and 5- E respectively. A B RTRS = − 227.6 + 4.2 T–0.1 T2 + 15.7 G −0.2 G2 – 0.1 TG R2 = 0.88Fcalculated = 9,10 RCOD = −43.9 + 21.3 T–4.1 T + 3.5 G∗ - 0.1G2∗R2 = 0.99Fcalculated = 119,26 C D RTS = −84.2 + 16.3 T–1.4 T2 + 6.02 G∗ - 0.1 G2∗ - 0.2 TG R2 = 0.94Fcalculated = 18.29 RVS = −2.8 - 0.8 G −0.4 G2+ 4.2 T - 0.1T2 - 0.1 GT R2 = 0.97Fcalculated = 42.60 E Conversion = −1660.5–104.5 G∗ + 9.6 G2∗+ 98.4 T–1.3 T2 + 0.7 G TR2 = 0.96 Fcalculado = 30.45 Varied results of solids removal and biogas production are reported in literature, even for identical concentrations of glycerol addition. Discretants responses between studies may be associated with the development of work with mixed glasses from reactors of the most diverse effluent rather than using pure and isolated crops. With the addition of 1% of glycerol in the handler, the removal rates of TRS were very close to those obtained by Torres et al. (2017) when submitting the handler to the process of biodigestion, the removal of carbohydrates was between 91 and 94%. Overall, it was found that the addition of glycerol provided a reduction in the percentages of organic load removal, while the temperature did not significantly affect the effluent treatment at a 5% probability level. This effect caused by glycerol can be related to its high carbon content, which once added to the handler, even at low concentrations, increases the solids and COD content of the mixture. The values achieved are lower than those verified by Larsen et al. (2013), who obtained removals of 75, 81 and 98% of VS, TS and COD respectively, by adding 2% of glycerol to the cassava wastewater using sludge as inoculum of an anaerobic lagoon from the cassava starch industry’s treatment system. However, the values obtained by these same authors fell to 68 and 72% to VS and TS when 3% glycerol was added, which corroborates the trend of a decrease in the removal of an organic load as the concentration of glycerol increases. To obtain these removal values, Larsen et al. (2013) used a hydraulic retention time of 5 days and obtained biogas containing 48% of methane, which justifies the higher solids removal values, considering that in the methanogenic phase there is the consumption of organic acids produced. These values also justify the lower efficiencies in the conversion of organic load into hydrogen verified in this study, since during its production the conversion of sugars present in the handle and glycerol into organic acids must have occurred. Thus, the organic load removals verified in this work imply the need for subsequent complementary treatment for carbon removal. A methanogenic reactor is indicated for the consumption of the high load of volatile acids present in the effluent."
13,Hydrogen production under optimized conditions,"3.4 Hydrogen production under optimized conditions From the results of the statistical analysis and the mathematical model for the quantity of hydrogen produced (volume), the optimal conditions of temperature and concentration of glycerol were obtained in order to reach the maximum volume of hydrogen, with an ideal temperature of 38.5 °C and a concentration of 4% of glycerol. Table 3 contains the answers predicted by the models when using these optimized conditions in the biodigestion process, as well as the results obtained in the tests performed in triplicate in these conditions. Considering the standard deviation of the experimental results, all the values predicted by the mathematical model are in the range of the experimental values, with the exception of the maximum specific velocity which, although very close, presented in practice a value higher than the predicted one. These favorable results testify the high fit to the experimental data validating the empirical model. Concerning the 38.5 °C value for optimum temperature, most acidogenic bacteria have optimum productivity at temperatures between 30 °C and 40 °C. It is still considered that at temperatures between 39 and 41 °C optimum growth rates of biomass and specific production of hydrogen may occur, though decreasing at higher temperatures (Mu et al., 2006; Park et al., 2010; Arimi et al., 2015). About the concentration of added glycerol (4%), concentrations higher than 5% directly affect hydrogen production. Chaudary (2010) states in research, using as microorganism Escherichia coli and concentrations of 10, 2.5 and 5.0% of glycerol, that very high concentration of this compound affects the process and decrease its yield. The same was proven by Chookaew et al., (2014), testing concentrations of 1–3% of glycerol in a UASB reactor. The work of Faber and Ferreira-Leitão (2016), aimed at maximizing hydrogen production from the use of glycerol, reached the best results when the lowest concentration of glycerol tested in his research (0.05%) was applied. Work of Sittijunda and Reungsang (2012), state that for glycerol digestion and mixed culture sludge, the concentration of 2.2% was the one that provided the maximum production of hydrogen."
14,Conclusion,"The mixtures of cassava wastewaters and residual glycerol showed great potential for degradation via anaerobic biodigestion, using as inoculum wastewater from pig farming, and the high production of hydrogen demonstrates the potential of using this biofuel production process on a larger scale from agro-industrial waste with the addition of residual glycerol. Wastewater inoculum from swine farming revealing contained bacteria from the genus Brevundimonas, from subgroup Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus, and from species Bacillus licheniformis. From the experimental design that considered the variables temperature and ratio (mass or volumetric) it was possible to determine the optimal conditions for hydrogen production (38.5 °C and 4% of glycerol); The microorganisms identified in the inoculum of the acidogenic reactor have great potential for molecular hydrogen production. Besides, the conditions used in the experiments fit the optimal values for their growth and development, even in mixed culture. The high concentration of volatile acids and organic load in the effluent obtained suggests the possibility of studying the anaerobic biodigestion of these residues in acid and methanogenic phase reactors physically separated and connected in series."
