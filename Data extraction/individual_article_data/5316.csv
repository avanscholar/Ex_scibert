0,Introduction,"The rise in energy requirement, the decrease of oil reserves, the increase in oil prices, and air pollution problems related to the use of fossil fuels has increased the interest in alternative and clean fuels. Diesel engines are commonly used in many different industries because of their high efficiency [1]. Using bio-based fuel in diesel engines is an effective technique for decreasing emissions [2]. Alcohol fuels can contribute to reducing diesel exhaust emissions and the oil dependency [3]. Alcohols are suitable diesel additives because of their liquid nature and high oxygen content [4]. Among the alcohols, low carbon alcohols (containing three or fewer carbon atoms), such as methanol and ethanol, as a diesel fuel blend have received great interest due to their advanced production technologies and high oxygen content [5,6], which can effectively improve combustion characteristics and reduce the exhaust emissions [7]. However, the low cetane number, the high latent vaporization heat, and stability and miscibility problems greatly limit the use of low carbon alcohols as alternative fuels for diesel engines [8]. High carbon alcohols containing four or more carbons may provide additional advantages as diesel fuel additives compared to low carbon alcohols. They have higher cetane number and heating value than low carbon alcohols. They can also be blended with diesel fuel even at large mixing ratios because of their better miscibility. In addition, the less hygroscopic nature of high carbon alcohols facilitates storage and transport [8]. The effects of various low and high carbon alcohol-diesel blends on the combustion behavior, engine performance, and exhaust emissions of the compression ignition engines will be discussed below. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is the most commonly used alcohol due to being renewable and having high oxygen content as diesel fuel additive. The high oxygen content of ethanol improves combustion and reduces emissions [9]. However, ethanol requires more precautions in preparing ethanol-diesel blends because its flash point is much lower compared to diesel fuels [3]. Since the evaporation temperature of ethanol is about 2–3 times lower than the diesel fuel, mixing of diesel fuel with ethanol can advance the start of fuel evaporation, which accelerates the preparation of a mixture of air and fuel. A number of experimental studies have been carried out on ethanol used in diesel engines. Rakopoulos et al. [10] studied the use of ethanol-diesel blends (E5, E10, E15) in direct injection diesel engine at 2000 rpm under four different loads. CO and smoke emissions notably decreased, while NOx slightly decreased with the use of blends. On the other hand, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased slightly as the ethanol increased in the blends. Labeckas et al. [11] have reported that the ethanol addition reduces smoke, CO, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions because of the higher oxygen mass content and the lower carbon-hydrogen ratio (C/H) of ethanol. Ajav et al. [12] investigated the effects of ethanol additives to diesel fuel (E5, E10, E15, and E20) in a diesel engine at a constant speed and reported that the use of ethanol blends increased BSFC while NOx and CO were reduced significantly without any important reduction in power. In the literature, there are studies in which methanol (CH3OH) is used as an alternative fuel additive for diesel engines, although not as much as ethanol [13–15]. Methanol can be produced at low cost from petroleum-based fuels or coal but has limited miscibility in diesel fuel [9]. However, ethanol is more advantageous than methanol since it is renewable (bio-ethanol) and more highly miscible with diesel fuel [9]. Sayin [16] conducted an experimental research to compare the use of methanol blends (M5, M10), ethanol blends (E5, E10) and diesel fuel in a direct injection diesel engine under constant torque at different engine speeds. The use of alcohol decreased CO, HC and smoke emissions while increased NOx. BSFC of methanol blends increased more than that of ethanol blends. BTE decreased with the addition of the alcohols and the lowest value of BTE was reached with M10. As reported in the literature, a larger range of flammability, lower viscosity, significant oxygen content, and higher latent heat of vaporization of methanol can be seen as an advantage as regards faster combustion, lower NOx, and smoke emissions [17,18]. The fuel properties of the four carbon alcohol butanol (C4H9OH) are more similar to petroleum-based fuels. Butanol has some advantages over other alcohols as an alternative fuel for diesel engines because of its higher cetane number, higher miscibility, and lower vapor pressure. In addition, butanol has higher energy content and less corrosivity. For this reason, butanol is considered to be a more suitable ingredient for use as a diesel fuel additive [4]. Butanol is also a renewable biomass-based fuel such as ethanol. Butanol production from biomass is predominantly the tendency to produce the straight chain molecule normal butanol. Because of its lower volatility, higher heating value, and higher viscosity and like properties, butanol is considered as very promising alcohol fuel for diesel engines compared to ethanol and methanol. For this reason, studies on butanol have recently become popular. The studies on the diesel engines fueled with butanol-diesel blends indicated that lower exhaust emissions can be achieved without significant changes in engine performance [19,20]. Kumar et al. [4] reported that the addition of butanol to diesel fuel reduces smoke density and CO emissions and increases NOx emissions, but reduces NOx emissions when the amount of butanol in the fuel blend increases. Rakopoulos et al. [21] investigated the effects of butanol-diesel blends on the emission and performance of direct-injection diesel engines at different loads. They reported that butanol-diesel fuel blends significantly reduced smoke emissions, resulting in a slight reduction in NOx and CO emissions. Dogan [22] explored the performance and exhaust emissions of the fuel blends prepared by mixing 5% and 10% of butanol with diesel fuel on the four-stroke, single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine under constant engine speed at different loads. It has been found that as the content of butanol increases in the fuel blend, exhaust gas temperature, NOx, smoke opacity and CO emissions decrease while BSFC and BTE increase slightly. As mentioned above, many studies have been conducted on diesel engines to investigate the exhaust emissions and engine performance of various alcohol-diesel blends. However, studies on the combustion behavior of alcohol fuels are rather limited compared to performance and emission studies in the literature. For a comprehensive fuel analysis, it is necessary to simultaneously analyze and compare the effects of various lower and higher alcohol blends on the combustion behavior, engine performance, and exhaust emissions of diesel engines. The main objective of this experimental study is to simultaneously and systematically examine the effect of lower and higher alcohol blends on combustion, performance, and exhaust emission characteristics. For this purpose, the experiments related to combustion behavior, engine performance, and exhaust emission characteristics of a direct-injection single-cylinder diesel engine were performed at 1500 rpm at different engine loads using various alcohol blends obtained by mixing 10% butanol, ethanol, and methanol with diesel fuel. These alcohol blends were then compared with each other and with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The results show that alcohol addition to diesel fuel generally reduces the exhaust emissions without seriously affecting diesel engine performance and the higher alcohol butanol has the potential to overcome problems encountered in the use of ethanol and methanol."
1,Materials and methods,"In this study ethanol, methanol, and butanol blends and petroleum-based diesel fuel were used in order to understand the effect of different alcohol additions on combustion behavior, engine performance, and exhaust emissions. Diesel fuel called D100 was used to obtain reference data. Then butanol, ethanol, and methanol were mixed with the diesel fuel in 10 wt% proportion and called B10, E10, and M10 respectively. Table 1 shows the basic properties of these fuels. In spite of the high oxygen content of the alcohols, the alcohol proportion in the test blends was chosen 10 wt%, which is the optimum mixture ratio, in order to minimize the poor combustion characteristics due to low cetane number and heating value of the alcohols. The problem of phase separation has been encountered in the use of methanol-diesel fuel blends. However, pure ethanol and butanol can be easily blended with diesel fuel at room temperature [23,24]. Nevertheless, a magnetic stirrer was used in the fuel tank as a precaution to prevent any phase separation during all tests. Thus, no phase separation was observed during the experiments. The tests were carried out without any modification on the engine and under variable engine loads of 2.5 Nm, 5 Nm, 7.5 Nm, and 10 Nm at the engine speed of 1500 rpm which is the lowest speed the engine can run stable at full load. Prepared blends were tested under the same condition for comparison with petroleum-based diesel fuel. Fig. 1 indicates a schematic diagram of the engine test rig. The engine tests were performed on an air-cooled, naturally-aspirated, direct injection, and single-cylinder diesel engine. Table 2 gives the main characteristics of this engine. Kemsan brand DC dynamometer (15 kW at 3000 rpm) was used to load the engine. The engine torque was obtained using a Kistler brand 4550A model torque meter. A Kistler 2614B model encoder was coupled to the crank shaft in order to collect crank angle, top dead center and speed of the engine. A3 Kistler 6052C brand piezoelectric pressure sensor and 5064 charge amplifier were used for measuring the cylinder pressure. Fuel line pressure was measured using a Kistler 4065B piezoresistive sensor coupled to a 4665 amplifier which connected to the fuel line with 6533A clamp adaptor. The cylinder pressure and fuel line pressure were recorded at a resolution of 0.1 degrees crank angle. All the signals were recorded using a Kistler KiBox data collection system. The heat release rate (HRR) and maximum heat release rate (HRRmax), maximum cylinder pressure (CPmax) and its location (ACPmax) and angles of start and end of combustion were calculated by KiBox Cockpit software. The HRR was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) dQ d θ = k k - 1 p dV d θ + 1 k - 1 V dp d θ The calculation of the HRR is carried out without taking into account the wall heat losses. In Eq. (1), Q is heat energy, θ is crank angle, p is cylinder pressure, V is cylinder volume, and k is the constant polytropic exponent. In this work, k was taken as 1.37. The start of combustion (SOC) and the end of combustion (EOC) are corresponding to 5% and 90% of total heat release, respectively. The combustion duration (CD) is the difference between SOC and EOC. The start of injection (SOI) is defined as the crank angle degree at which the fuel injector tester reaches the injector opening pressure determined as 207 bar. The ignition delay (ID) is the period interval from the SOI to the SOC. BSFC and BTE are calculated by the following equations: (2) BSFC = m ̇ f · 10 6 P e (3) BTE = 3600 BSFC · LHV · 100 where m ̇ f is the fuel mass flow rate, LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel, Pe is the brake power, which is calculated from engine brake torque obtained from the torque meter. Emissions were measured by a Mobydick 5000 Kombi exhaust gas analyser and opacimeter. Table 3 indicates the measurement accuracy of these devices and relative uncertainty values for CO, NOx and smoke emissions. The measurement accuracy of the equipment used and the uncertainty analysis of the values obtained are important facts for each test [23]. As the engine run under different conditions and under calibrated devices, the uncertainty analyses were performed throughout the entire study using the linear approximation method. For precision measurement, the emission data were recorded at least five times and taken their average to draw the graph."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Injection characteristics,"3.1 Injection characteristics The start of injection, influenced by the changes in physical properties of fuels such as the density, viscosity, and compressibility, affects the combustion characteristics, performance and exhaust emissions of the engine [24]. The changings in the fuel injection timing change the ignition delay, cylinder pressure, and heat release rate. Table 4 shows the injection and combustion behaviors of all fuels for different engine loads. The higher viscosity and lower compressibility of the fuels lead to a faster pressure rise in the fuel line and an earlier SOI [25]. Since the fuel line pressure decreases with increasing engine load, SOI starts later at higher load for all fuels as seen in Table 4. The injection of B10 starts earlier by an average of 0.2 °CA compared to the other fuels for all engine loads due to the high viscosity of the higher alcohol butanol. After B10, in accordance with the viscosity of the fuels, D100, E10, and M10 start injection respectively."
4,Ignition delay,"3.2 Ignition delay Ignition delay is one of the most significant parameters, which affects the combustion characteristics, performance, and emissions of compression ignition engine. It is affected by the chemical and physical properties of the fuels [26]. Among them, cetane number, viscosity, and oxygen content of fuel are the most significant parameters influencing the ignition delay. The numerical values of ignition delay of alcohol blends and diesel fuel versus engine loads are given in Table 4. The results show that cetane number, viscosity, and oxygen content of fuel have a significant effect on the ignition delay as expected. The higher cetane number usually causes the shorter ignition delay. Also, increasing the engine load causes the shorter ignition delay for all fuels because of the increasing in gas temperature in the cylinder [17]. Since alcohol addition reduces the cetane number of the fuel, alcohol blends have a longer ignition delay than D100. Among the alcohol fuels, although higher alcohol butanol has a higher cetane number than lower alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, B10 has higher ignition delay than E10 and M10. This is because butanol has higher kinematic viscosity and lower oxygen content than ethanol and methanol. The high viscosity increases the ignition delay because it worsens the fuel atomization and evaporation as well as the mixing with air. In addition, the higher oxygen content of the fuel improves the combustion process. Although the methanol has a lower cetane number than other two alcohols, M10 has a lower ignition delay compared to E10 and B10. This is because methanol has a high oxygen content and low kinematic viscosity."
5,Combustion analysis,"3.3 Combustion analysis The combustion characteristics such as cylinder pressure and HRR are the most significant parameters affecting the engine performance and exhaust emissions. These parameters are influenced by the heating value of the fuel. In this section, the change in the combustion behaviors of various alcohol blends will be discussed and interpreted. 3.3.1 Cylinder pressure The variations of cylinder pressure and HRR of the alcohol blends and D100 according to crank angle under different loads at 1500 rpm are seen in Fig. 2 . In addition, numerical values of CPmax and ACPmax are shown in Table 2. As it is observed from the results, the combustion of alcohol blends starts later and ignition delay of alcohol blends is longer than D100 because of the low cetane number of the alcohol fuels. The peak cylinder pressure of the alcohol blends are higher and their locations are earlier than D100 for all loads because of the high oxygen content of alcohols and the rapid combustion of the fuel accumulated in the combustion chamber at the ignition delay duration. Similar results were reported in Refs [27,28]. Also, the cylinder pressure increases and reaches its maximum value later at high engine loads for all fuels because the amount of the fuel injected into the cylinder increases with the engine load. When the alcohol blends are compared among themselves, it is observed that the cylinder peak pressure of the high carbon alcohol blend B10 is higher than low carbon alcohol blends (E10 and M10) at low engine loads. The difference in peak pressures decreases with increasing load and it shows almost the same value as 83.4 bar for all alcohol blends at 10 Nm. 3.3.2 Heat release rate The heat release rates of the diesel fuel and the alcohol blends under different loads and at the constant engine speed (1500 rpm) are seen in Fig. 2. Also, numerical values of HRRmax are viewed in Table 4. As seen from the Fig. 2, the HRR of the alcohol blends is higher than D100 due to the longer ignition delay and excessive oxygen content of the alcohols. This is seen more obviously at high engine loads. The HRRmax of all alcohol blends are greater compared to D100 about 15% at 7.5 Nm and all alcohol blends have a similar trend. Since cetane number of alcohols is lower than diesel fuel, combustion starts later and ignition delay lasts longer for the alcohol blends. Because of the rapid combustion of the fuel accumulated in the combustion chamber at the ignition delay duration and high oxygen content of alcohols, HRRmax of the alcohol blends are higher and reach the maximum value later than D100 for all engine loads. Although alcohols have a low heating value, HRRmax of the alcohol blends are higher than D100. The reason is that the oxygen content of the alcohols is higher. These results are supported by previous studies [28,29]."
6,Engine performance,"3.4 Engine performance In this section, BSFC and BTE will be discussed as the engine performance parameters for each type of fuel. 3.4.1 BSFC The variation of the BSFC and BTE according to the engine load at the constant speed (1500 rpm) is given in Fig. 3 . As expected, the BSFC increases with the addition of alcohols due to the decreased energy content. Because the heating value of the fuels plays an important role in increasing or decreasing the BSFC. When using fuels with a lower heating value such as alcohol blends, more fuel must be injected to achieve a similar power output. Among the alcohol blends, the B10 has the lowest BSFC since it has the highest LHV, while the M10 with the lowest LHV has the highest BSFC. In addition, since the cetane number of the alcohols is lower, the ignition delay period of the alcohol blends increases and thus BSFC increases. Similar results were reported in Refs. [30–34]. As the engine load increases, the BSFC value of all tested fuels decreases. This decline in the BSFC can be explained as follows: the increased brake power ratio is higher than that of the fuel consumption as the engine load increases in accordance with the Ref. [35]. 3.4.2 BTE BTE is a demonstration of the ability of the combustion of the fuel and is a useful means for assessing how efficiently the energy in the fuel is converted to mechanical output [35]. The brake thermal efficiency versus engine load at the constant engine speed (1500 rpm) is given in Fig. 3. BTE is a function of BSFC and heating value of a fuel. D100 has the highest BTE because of the lowest BSFC. B10, E10, and M10 follow the D100 respectively in accordance with the BSFC values. Similar results were obtained by Al Hasan et al. [36]. They have reported a general decline in BTE with isobutanol/diesel fuel blends. Sayın et al. have indicated that methanol-diesel fuel blends caused a very slight decrease in BTE compared to diesel fuel. Karabektas et al. [37] have reported that the isobutanol/diesel fuel blends (up to 20% of isobutanol) cause a decrease in BTE. However, some other researchers have indicated that ethanol/diesel fuel blends cause an increase in BTE [7,38]. Lebedevas et al. [39] noted a slight increase in BTE when the biobutanol/diesel fuel blend (30% of biobutanol) was used. It is also observed that BTE curves follow a similar trend and reach the maximum value at 7.5 Nm for all tested fuels however there was a slight decrease at 10 Nm."
7,Emissions,"3.5 Emissions In this section, the effect of the alcohol additions to diesel fuels on the NOx, smoke and CO emissions was investigated at the different engine loads. The alcohol addition causes a slight increase in NOx emissions while causing a reduction in smoke and CO emissions. 3.5.1 NOx The NOx formation is generally dependent on the in-cylinder temperature, the oxygen concentration and the gas residence time it takes for the reaction to take place [35]. The NOx emission characteristics of fuel blends at different engine loads are seen in the Fig. 4 . The results show that the NOx emissions of alcohol blends were not so stable (slightly higher or slightly lower for different blends) compared with that of the diesel fuel. The addition of alcohol to diesel fuel at loads of 2.5 and 5 Nm has no significant effect on NOx emissions but causes a slight increase in loads of 7.5 and 10 Nm due to the lower cetane number. The lower cetane number of the alcohol blends increases the ignition delay, which increases the maximum cylinder pressure due to the rapid combustion of the accumulated fuel. Higher maximum cylinder pressures result in higher maximum temperatures and consequently increases NOx emissions. The alcohols contain more oxygen than diesel fuel, which also increases the maximum temperature in the cylinder [35]. In addition, shorter combustion duration of alcohol blends causes to decrease the time for cooling, which leads to higher NOx emission [40]. Although the alcohols contain higher oxygen and their cetane number is lower than diesel fuel, the NOx emissions of the alcohol blends do not change much at low loads. This is because of the reduction in the end of the combustion temperature due to the evaporative cooling effect of the alcohols. The increase in cylinder temperature with increasing load compensates the alcohol cooling effect and its oxygen content becomes more effective, resulting in increased NOx formation. These results are generally quite similar to the literature [34,16,41]. The NOx formation also increases with the increasing of engine load up to 7.5 Nm due to the increase in the injection quantity, but decreases again at 10 Nm. The reasons for this decline for all test fuels are the decrease in volumetric efficiency at 10 Nm and the deterioration of the fuel atomization resulting in the decrease in HRRmax and EOC temperature. Similar results were reported in Refs [42,43]. 3.5.2 Smoke The formation of the smoke emission depends on the engine condition, the type of combustion chamber and the physic-chemical properties of the fuel [41]. The smoke emission occurs at the oxygen deficiency. The oxygen deficiency can be seen locally in the combustion chamber and increases with decreasing air/fuel ratio [34]. The smoke emission characteristics of the fuels at different engine loads are seen in the Fig. 5 . The alcohol addition to diesel fuel reduces the smoke emissions at all engine loads because of the high oxygen mass content and lower C/H of the alcohol fuels. The high oxygen mass content of the alcohols improves the combustion and prevents the smoke formation in the exhaust gas. Also, high viscosity and density deteriorate fuel atomization and combustion. Among the alcohol blends, B10 has the highest smoke emissions since the butanol has the higher carbon content, density, and viscosity as well as lower oxygen content than the other two alcohols. These results are similar to other studies in Refs. [32,33,42]. Alcohol blends seem to be more effective in reducing smoke emissions at high loads compared to low loads. Because the air/fuel ratio is lower at higher engine loads, thus the oxygen availability of the alcohol blends can have a more positive effect on the smoke emissions. This result is supported by other studies [21,43]. NOx and smoke in diesel engines are known to be the two most important emissions that are difficult to control simultaneously. The results of this study show that smoke emissions are drastically reduced by the addition of the alcohol in the diesel fuel and thus can be focused more on the controlling of the NOx emissions. For this reason, the addition of oxygenated fuel to diesel fuel seems to be a good choice in diesel engines, to reduce the use of the expensive after-treatment system [44,45]. 3.5.3 CO The main parameters affecting CO emission formation are air/fuel ratio, fuel type, combustion chamber shape, fuel atomization rate, injection pressure and timing as well as engine load and speed. However, the most effective of these parameters is the air/fuel ratio [46]. The variation of CO emissions of the alcohol blends and D100 at different engine loads is presented in Fig. 6 . Since adequate oxygen distribution and high temperature in the combustion chamber cause a reduction in the formation of CO emissions, the addition of alcohol with high oxygen content leads to a reduction in the formation of CO. Another reason for the lower CO emissions of alcohol blends is the fact that the alcohol blends have a lower C/H ratio than D100. E10 has higher CO emissions than the other two alcohol blends because the high evaporation heat of the ethanol reduces the combustion temperature of the cylinder. Similar findings were obtained in Refs. [33,47]. In addition, the increase in the engine load leads to rich operating conditions in the combustion chamber and causes an increase in CO emissions because of the large injection quantity. However, at low loads, the fuel lean cylinder environment absorbs the heat from the combustion products thus reducing the temperature causing the CO oxidation to slow down."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, the effect of the various low and high carbon alcohols addition in diesel fuel on combustion, performance, and exhaust emission characteristics of a single-cylinder diesel engine was investigated at different loads. The alcohols used in this study have a higher oxygen content and a lower cetane number than D100. Also, they have lower viscosity except for butanol. These fuel properties have a significant impact on combustion behavior, engine performance, and exhaust emission characteristics. The following conclusions can be obtained from this study: 1. The peak cylinder pressures of the alcohol blends are higher and their locations are earlier than D100 for all engine loads. 2. The maximum heat release rates of the alcohol blends are higher than the diesel fuel because of the longer ignition delay and excessive oxygen content of alcohols. 3. Petroleum-based diesel fuel has the lowest BSFC and the highest BTE compared to alcohol blends for all engine loads because of the high heating value. B10, E10, and M10 follow D100 respectively in accordance with the heating values of fuels. 4. Alcohol addition causes a slight increase in NOx emissions while causing a reduction in smoke and CO emissions. 5. The higher alcohol butanol has the potential to overcome problems encountered in the use of lower alcohols such as ethanol and methanol. 6. As a general result of this study, it can be said that the alcohol blends reduce the engine emissions without seriously affecting engine performance. The addition of alcohol to diesel fuel allows for a greater focus on control of NOx emissions, especially since it significantly reduces smoke emissions. Because, in diesel engines, NOx and smoke are known to be the two most important emissions that are difficult to control simultaneously. For this reason, the addition of oxygenated fuel to diesel fuel seems to be a good choice in diesel engines, to reduce the use of the expensive after-treatment system."
