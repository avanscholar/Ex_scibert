0,Introduction,"Development of substitutable energy is a crucial issue for handling the energy crisis that is resulted from the rapid depletion of fossil fuel [1]. As a popular bio-refinery technology, bio-ethanol production from biomass substrates has been extensively investigated and practiced [2–5]. Compared to ethanol, butanol is more promising because of the higher energy content, lower volatility, and less hygroscopicity and explosibility [6,7]. The similar octane value and energy content between butanol and gasoline allows the current petrol engines to use butanol as the fuel without upgradation [8,9]. Butanol is also widely used in various industries as an important chemical predecessor [10]. Therefore, butanol production via microbial fermentation processes has attracted an increasing interest all around the world because of its sustainability and environmental benefits [11]. Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation by Clostridium species has been regarded as a carbon–neutral process for bio-butanol production [12]. As another green energy with zero carbon emissions in combustion, the accompanied H2 production in the ABE fermentation has also attracted an extensive attention [13]. Thus, it is of significance to improve the energy recovery efficiency of the bio-refinery process. However, most of the researches focused on the production of either butanol or H2 in the last decade [14,15]. The co-production of butanol and H2 was rarely evaluated due to the competition for reducing equivalents between the formation of butanol and H2 in ABE fermentation [12,16]. It is known that the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in ABE fermentation plays a critical role in manipulating the profile of products [17]. Many researches have focused on the alteration of NADH/NAD+ ratio in Clostridia to improve the production of butanol or H2 in ABE fermentation [18–20]. It has been reported that the continuous electron supply to a cathodic electro-fermentation (CEF) system could increase NADH/NAD+ ratio in vivo, which resulted in an obvious increase of butanol production with a decreased acetone production [21]. Recently, CEF has emerged as a feasible tool for altering the NADH/NAD+ ratio in vivo and/or providing extra electrons to fermentative microorganisms by polarized electrode, resulting in the enhanced formation of reduced products [22,23]. In the last decade, CEF has been extensively investigated for the production of value-added chemicals, e.g. butyric acid, butanol and H2 [24–26]. It has also been reported that electron mediators (EMs) such as neutral red (NR), benzyl viologen (BV), methyl viologen (MV) are able to manipulate electrons distribution between H2 and NADH pool in Clostridia, resulting in more carbon flux diverted to reduced products formation [21,27]. NR has been demonstrated to be effective in diverting carbon flow towards butanol formation in a CEF system of Clostridium pasteurianum [19]. In the previous study, the feasibility of CEF system in enhancing the co-production of butanol and H2 was evaluated by Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 [13]. Performed at the cathode potential of -0.75 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with 20 g/L glucose and 0.50 mmol/L NR in the cathode chamber, the specific production of butanol and H2 from glucose averaged 0.30 g/g and 206.53 mL/g, 172.7% and 71.4% higher than that in the open circuit system, respectively. Carbon balance and electron balance in the CEF system revealed that the polarized electrode had resulted in a feasible oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) for H2 formation, while the additional NR had induced more carbon source and electrons to the formation of butanol. However, it is still unknown whether the -0.75 V cathode potential, 20 g/L glucose and 0.50 mmol/L NR are the most favorable ones for the co-production of butanol and H2 in the CEF system. It is known that ABE fermentation of Clostridia is a biphasic process, i.e. acidogenesis and solventogenesis [8]. As the crucial intermediate, acetic acid and butyric acid produced in the acidogenesis would be assimilated to forming butanol in the solventogenesis. Because the re-assimilation of acetic acid in ABE fermentation would result in more acetone produced, more studies have focused on the re-assimilation of butyric acid to enhance the butanol formation of Clostridia [28,29]. Various researches have validated that additional butyric acid could significantly enhance the production and yield of butanol in ABE fermentation [10,29,30]. Obviously, exogenous butyric acid is another crucial factor in improving the performance of CEF in the co-production of butanol and H2. Considering the fact that optimization of ABE fermentation in CEF system was rarely reported for the co-production of butanol and H2, a series of CEF processes were conducted by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 to find the most favorable cathode potential, NR dosage, glucose concentration and exogenous butyric acid concentration in sequence. The energy recovery efficiencies under the conditions were also analyzed to identify the most favorable parameters for the co-production of butanol and H2 in CEF system. The research work presents a novel approach to manipulating the microbial metabolism and harvesting butanol and H2 in ABE fermentation."
1,Method and materials,
2,Microorganism and medium,"2.1 Microorganism and medium The microorganism used for ABE fermentation in the present research was C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 which was purchased from China general microbiological culture center [13]. The strain was initially cultivated with 10 g/L glucose for about 24 h at 37 ± 1°C and 130 ± 2 rpm. The fermented broth was then collected and stored at 4°C as inoculum. P2 medium was chosen for the ABE fermentation, which was composed of 1 L deionized water with 20 g glucose, 3 g yeast extract, 0.5 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g KH2PO4, 0.001 g p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.001 g thiamine, 0.0001 g biotin, 0.2 g MgSO4 7H2O, 0.01 g MnSO4 4H2O, 0.01 g FeSO4 7H2O, and 0.01 g NaCl [10]. The medium was prepared as reported previously [13]."
3,Construction of CEF systems,"2.2 Construction of CEF systems All of the CEF systems in the present research were constructed with the same two-chamber H-Type reactors according to the previous study [13]. Each of the two chambers was made of borosilicate glasses with a working volume and total volume of 100 mL and 150 mL, respectively. The anode chamber and cathode chamber in each CEF system were separated by Nafion® 117 proton exchange membrane (PEM) with an effective area of 5.3 cm2. The PEM permits the migration of H+ between the two chambers. Pretreatment of PEM followed the previous study [31]. Graphite felt (4 × 3 cm) served as electrode was fixed by titanium wire (ɸ 2 mm, 2 mm diameter, BeiLong metal, China). Ag/AgCl (+199 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) electrode was used as the reference electrode, which was saturated in cathode chamber. At the beginning of each batch test, the cathode chamber was filled with 100 mL inoculated P2 medium for ABE fermentation, while the anode chamber was filled with 100 mL 200 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] as electron donor. The constant cathode potential was maintained by a multichannel potentiostat (CHI1000C, CHI instruments, China)."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Though the performance of a fermentation process could be affected by various factors, cathode potential [32], NR dosage [33,34], glucose concentration [32] and exogenous butyric acid addition [29,35] have been identified as the prominent ones affecting the co-production efficiency of butanol and hydrogen in ABE fermentation processes. Thus, a sequential optimization strategy was employed herein to enhance the energy recovery of ABE fermentation in CEF system. The optimization of cathode potential, NR dosage, glucose concentration and exogenous butyric acid concentration in CEF system was carried out progressively as shown as Fig. 1 . Effect of cathode potential on the co-production of butanol and H2 production was firstly investigated in the presence of 20 g/L glucose and 0.50 mmol/L NR, with CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4 referring to the applied potential of -0.45, -0.60, -0.75 and -0.90 V (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively. With the favorable cathode potential (-0.60 V), another four CEF systems named CEF-B1, CEF-B2, CEF-B3 and CEF-B4 was then conducted with the NR dosage of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mmol/L, respectively, with the same glucose of 20 g/L to identify the optimal NR concentration for the co-production of butanol and H2. Furtherly, the effect of glucose concentration was evaluated by the CEF systems of CEF-C1, CEF-C2, CEF-C3, CEF-C4 and CEF-C5 at the favorable cathode potential (-0.60 V) and NR dosage (0.50 mmol/L), in which 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 g/L glucose was loaded respectively. Finally, more six CEF systems marked as CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4, CEF-D5 and CEF-D6 were constructed to test the exogenous butyric acid of 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00 and 6.00 g/L, respectively, at the identified favorable cathode potential (-0.60 V), NR dosage (0.50 mmol/L) and glucose (30 g/L) (Fig. 1). Inoculated with the same inoculum of 5% (v/v), all of the CEF systems were incubated for 5 days at 37 ± 1°C and 130 ± 2 rpm with an initial pH around 6.5. Each batch test was carried out in duplicate. The biogas produced in each of the CEF systems was collected into an evacuated gasbag. During the ABE fermentation processes, mixtures in each of cathode chambers were sampled daily for the detection of aqueous products (acetone, butanol, acetic acid and butyric acid), pH, bacterial concentration and glucose concentration, respectively. Both measurement of biogas volume and determination of the components (H2 and CO2) were conducted by the end of fermentation."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods pH of liquid samples was measured by a pH meter (FE28-Bio, Mettler Toledo). Bacterial concentration was evaluated in terms of optical density at the wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) on a spectrophotometer machine (UV-2401PC, SHIMADZU, Japan). Glucose concentration was determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid colorimetric (DNS) method [36]. To determine the aqueous products, the sampled broth was firstly centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 3 min to obtain the supernatant. The aqueous components in the supernatant were then measured using a gas chromatography (SP-6890, Shandong Lunan Instrument Factory, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 m FFAP capillary column (i.d. 0.32 mm, SHIMADZU, Japan). The biogas collected in each gasbag was measured by a 100 mL airtight syringe at atmospheric pressure. H2 and CO2 in the biogas were determined by another gas chromatography (SP-6800A, Shandong Lunan Instrument Factory, China) which was equipped with thermal conductivity detector and 2 m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (60/80 mesh, Lanzhou ZhongKeKaiDi Chemical Newtech Co., Ltd, China) [35]. NADH, total amount of NAD+ and NADH were extracted with NADH/NAD+ Assay Kit (S0175, Beyotime Biotechnology, China) and then measured for the calculation of NADH/NAD+ ratio at the wavelength of 450 nm by an ELISA Microplate Reader (ELX800, BioTek, USA). Electric current in the circuit was recorded every minute by a multichannel potentiostat (CHI1000C, CHI instruments, China). The transferred charge (Q) and electrically converted NADH (NADHCEF) in the CEF systems were calculated with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively [32]. (1) Q = ∫ 0 t I dt (2) NADH CEF = Q 2 × F where, I and t are the electric current (A) in the CEFs and the duration time of fermentation, respectively; F is the Faraday constant number (96485 C/mol); coefficient 2 means 2 mol e- needed for generating 1 mol NADH. In the ABE fermentation with glucose as the sole carbon source, the butanol production and hydrogen production were determined in terms of the grames of butanol produced via per liter medium (g/L) and the liters of hydrogen produced via per liter medium (L/L), respectively. The butanol yield (g/g-glucose) and H2 yield (mL/g-glucose) in the ABE fermentation were calculated based on Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively. The butanol selectivity (%) referred to the mass percent of butanol in the total solvents produced as expressed as Eq. (5). (3) Butanol yield via glucose = Butanol produced (g/L) Glucose consumed (g/L) (4) Hydrogen yield via glucose = Hydrogen produced (L/L) Glucose consumed (g/L) × 1000 (5) Butanol selectivity = Butanol produced (g/L) Solvents produced in total (g/L) × 100 In the ABE fermentation with glucose and butyric acid as co-substrates, the butanol yield based on the consumption of glucose (g/g-glucose) and carbon source in consumed co-substrates (glucose and butyric acid) (mol/mol-C) were calculated according to Eq. (3) and Eq. (6), respectively. Because no hydrogen would be produced during the conversion of the re-assimilated butyric acid, H2 yield (mL/g-glucose) was also calculated based on Eq. (4). (6) Butanol yield via co - substrates = Moles of carbon in the butanol produced (mol/L) Moles of carbon in the co - substrates consumed (mol/L) (7) ER = Butanol produced g / L × E bu tan o l + Hydrogen produced L / L V m L / mol × M hydrogen × E hydrogen (8) ERE = ER ( kJ / L ) ∑ ( Consumed substrate × E substrate ) ( kJ / L ) × 100 Vm is the volume of 1 mol H2 (22.40 L/mol); Mhydrogen is the molecular weight of H2 (2 g/mol); Ebutanol and Ehydrogen is the energy content of 1 g butanol (36.12 kJ/g) and 1 g H2 (142 kJ/g), respectively. Esubstrate is the energy content of each 1 g consumed substrate (15.56 kJ/g for Eglucose and 24.76 kJ/g for Ebutyric acid )."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of cathode potential on the ABE fermentation,"3.1 Effect of cathode potential on the ABE fermentation Though the effectiveness of CEF system in improving butanol production has been confirmed, the applied cathode potentials varied wildly [21,24,32,38]. In view of the positive effect of NR on the performance of CEF system [13], four groups of CEF systems (CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4) were constructed by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in the presence of 20 g/L glucose and 0.50 mmol/L NR, which was conducted at the cathode potential of -0.45, -0.60, -0.75 and -0.90 V, respectively. The results as illustrated in Fig. 2 A showed that glucose in the CEF systems was almost consumed in the first three days of fermentation, except the CEF-A4 with the cathode potential of -0.90 V. By the end of fermentation on the 5th day, 18.52 ± 0.37, 21.39 ± 0.33, 19.11 ± 0.16 and 5.86 ± 0.34 g/L glucose had been utilized in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4, respectively. Meanwhile, a biomass of 2.07 ± 0.14, 1.86 ± 0.00, 1.78 ± 0.02 and 0.13 ± 0.01 in terms of OD600 was obtained in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3, and CEF-A4, respectively (Fig. 2B). The least glucose consumption and biomass formation in CEF-A4 indicated that the metabolism of C. beijerinckii was seriously inhibited by the cathode potential as low as -0.90 V. Though slightly less in biomass formation than that at -0.45 V (CEF-A1), the consumed glucose at -0.60 V (CEF-A2) was the most among the four CEF systems. As it has been reported that extra electrons would induce higher NADH level in vivo, which was beneficial for the formation of reduced chemicals with the inhibition of biomass synthesis [39]. More consumed glucose with less biomass in the CEF-A2 system indicated that more carbon source had been used for the formation of butanol rather than biomass. Fig. 2C showed that the butanol production in the CEF-A2 reached 6.09 ± 0.52 g/L, obviously higher than that of 4.37 ± 0.30 and 5.31 ± 0.60 g/L in the CEF-A1 and CEF-A3, respectively. The butanol yield in the CEF-A2 was counted to 0.29 ± 0.03 g/g (0.71 ± 0.07 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) which was also the highest among the four CEF systems (Fig. 2D). Though acetone as the main byproduct of ABE fermentation in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2 and CEF-A3 were different from each other (1.50 ± 0.28, 2.02 ± 0.21 and 1.83 ± 0.14 g/L, respectively) (Fig. S1), the butanol selectivity in the three CEF systems were almost equal to each other with the value of 75.01 ± 1.61%, 75.09 ± 0.37% and 74.33 ± 0.69%, respectively, due to the low production of acetone (Fig. 2D). Along with the degradation of glucose (Fig. 2A) and the formation of butanol (Fig. 2C), H2 was also formed in the four CEF systems (Fig. 2E). As shown as Fig. 2E, by the end of fermentation, about 2.59 ± 0.19 L/L H2 was produced in the CEF-A1 with the cathode potential of -0.45 V. When the cathode potential was decreased to -0.60 V and -0.75 V, H2 production was increased to 3.12 ± 0.21 L/L and 3.43 ± 0.23 L/L in the CEF-A2 and CEF-A3, respectively. With the decreasing cathode potential, H2 yield in the three CEF systems was also progressively increased from 139.92 ± 12.91 mL/g to 145.79 ± 12.01 mL/g and then to 179.22 ± 10.60 mL/g. The results indicated that a cathode potential higher than -0.75 V had a significant effect on the H2 production of CEF. However, the H2 production and yield was only 0.04 ± 0.00 L/L and 5.98 ± 0.40 mL/g, respectively, in the CEF-A4 system with the lowest cathode potential of -0.90 V (Fig. 2E), resulted in the lowest glucose consumption (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the energy recovery efficiency in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4, ER and ERE in each of the four CEF systems were calculated, respectively, with the results illustrated in Table 1 . Both the CEF-A2, CEF-A3 systems achieved highest ERE (77.97 ± 7.58% and 79.09 ± 6.90%) with no statistical difference (p > 0.05). The highest ER of 259.32 ± 21.27 kJ/L in the CEF-A2 system indicating that -0.60 V cathode potential was optimal for the co-production of butanol and H2. To understand the effect of cathode potential on the energy recovery efficiency in the CEF systems, generated electric current along with the fermentation process of CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4 was also recorded by a multichannel potentiostat. As shown in Fig. 2F, the maximum electric current obtained in the fermentation process of CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4 was around 0.15, 0.42, 0.37 and 0.15 mA, respectively. According to Eq. (1), the transferred electrons were counted up to 43.49, 116.23, 101.71 and 46.71C in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4, respectively, by the end of fermentation. The most effective electron transfer in the CEF-A2 should have contributed to the variation of NADH/NAD+ ratio in C. beijerinckii, resulting in the highest ER and ERE (Table 1). It has been known that the end-products profile of microorganism can be affected by NADH/NAD+ ratio in vivo [40]. And the cathode in CEF system can provide extra electrons to microorganism, which are then converted to NADH to promote the formation of reduced products (e.g. butanol and H2) [22,41,42]. The NADH/NAD+ ratio was measured along with the ABE fermentation process of the CEF-A1, CEF-A2 and CEF-A3, while with an open circuit (OC) system as a control. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the NADH/NAD+ ratio by the end of the 1st day was found to be 0.49 ± 0.03, 0.54 ± 0.01 and 0.52 ± 0.03 in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2 and CEF-A3, respectively, all of which were significantly higher than that of 0.22 ± 0.01 in the OC system. The improved NADH/NAD+ ratio would definitely stimulate the ABE fermentation changed from acidogenesis to solventogenesis, resulting in a continuous formation of butanol [8]. By the 2nd day, all of the NADH/NAD+ ratios in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2 and CEF-A3 were obviously decreased, indicating a quick consumption of NADH. Since the 3rd day, an obvious higher NADH/NAD+ ratio was observed in the CEF-A2, resulted in the more electrons from cathode. According to the Eq. (2), the moles of NADH resulted in the transferred charges in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2, CEF-A3 and CEF-A4 was as low as 2.25 × 10-4, 6.02 × 10-4, 5.27 × 10-4 and 2.42 × 10-4 mol, respectively. Obviously, the enhanced co-production of butanol and H2 (Fig. 2D and E) in the CEF-A1, CEF-A2 and CEF-A3 should not be attributed to the direct use of the transferred electrons for butanol formation, but to the manipulation of NADH/NAD+ ratio which would further stimulate the co-production of butanol and H2 [38]. Above all, -0.6 V was the most favorable cathode potential for the co-production of butanol and H2 in the CEF of C. beijerinckii."
8,Effect of NR concentration on the ABE fermentation,"3.2 Effect of NR concentration on the ABE fermentation NR is known as a typical EM to affect the electrochemical environment of CEF system and inherent the metabolism of microbial fermentation [33,34]. Though the previous research has confirmed the effectiveness of NR in enhancing the co-production of butanol and H2 in CEF system [13], further studies would be needed to reveal the optimal dosage of NR in view of the fact that an excessive NR will result in less butanol and H2 production due to the toxicity to microorganism [43]. Herein, another four CEF systems, i.e. CEF-B1, CEF-B2, CEF-B3 and CEF-B4 were conducted with the NR dosage of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mmol/L, respectively, with the same glucose of 20 g/L and the identified favorable cathode potential of -0.60 V. As shown as Fig. 4 , NR dosage had an obviously effect on the microbial growth, glucose utilization and the production of butanol and H2. In the CEF-B1 and CEF-B2 with the NR dosage of 0.25 and 0.50 mmol/L, the obtained biomass and glucose consumption by the end of fermentation were not significantly affected (Fig. 4A). Though the glucose consumption in the CEF-B1 and CEF-B2 was almost the same (20.35 ± 0.63 and 20.76 ± 0.74 g/L, respectively), the obtained biomass (OD600) of 1.99 ± 0.04 in the CEF-B2 was slightly less than that of 2.12 ± 0.06 in the CEF-B1. With the more glucose consumption and less biomass, the production and yield of butanol in the CEF-B2 reached 5.91 ± 0.35 g/L and 0.29 ± 0.02 g/g (0.71 ± 0.05 mol-butanol/mol-glucose), respectively, which were the highest ones among the four CEF systems (Fig. 4B). The butanol selectivity of 81.58 ± 0.38% in the CEF-B2 was also the highest among the four CEF systems (Fig. 4B, referred to Fig. S2 for the data of acetone). On the contrary, the production and yield of H2 in the CEF-B2 averaged 3.03 ± 0.27 L/L and 145.96 ± 13.40 mL/g, obviously lower than that of 3.34 ± 0.31 L/L and 164.65 ± 20.54 mL/g in the CEF-B1, respectively (Fig. 4C). The decreased H2 production resulted in more NADH used for butanol formation due to the competition for NADH between H2 production and butanol production pathway in ABE fermentation [16,21,27]. When the NR dosage was further increased to 0.75 and 1.00 mmol/L in the CEF-B3 and CEF-B4, respectively, performance of the CEF system got worse and worse (Fig. 4. Be the end of fermentation, the glucose consumption of 19.49 ± 1.09 g/L in the CEF-B3 was very near to the highest 20.76 ± 0.74 g/L in the CEF-B2, but the OD600 in the CEF-B3 was remarkably decreased to 1.49 ± 0.10 (Fig. 4A). When the NR dosage was further increased to 1.00 mmol/L in the CEF-B4, the glucose consumption and OD600 in the CEF-B4 was decreased to 16.69 ± 0.51 g/L and 1.37 ± 0.09, respectively. Previous report showed NR dosage more than 0.05 mmol/L would evidently inhibit the metabolism of microorganism [43]. Herein, the metabolism of C. beijerinckii was observably restricted by the NR dosage more than 0.75 mmol/L which was much higher than similar report. It was probably due to the stabilized fermentation environment induced by the cathode potential [42]. Due to the increased toxicity along with the NR dosage increased from 0.75 to 1.00 mmol/L, the production and yield of butanol was further decreased from 4.73 ± 0.31 g/L and 0.24 ± 0.03 g/g (0.58 ± 0.07 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) in the CEF-B3 to 3.41 ± 0.29 g/L and 0.21 ± 0.02 g/g (0.51 ± 0.05 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) in the CEF-B4, respectively (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the production and yield of H2 was decreased from 1.83 ± 0.19 L/L and 93.84 ± 4.59 mL/g to 0.91 ± 0.11 L/L and 54.56 ± 7.94 mL/g (Fig. 4C). Though 0.50 mmol/L had identified as the most favorable NR dosage for butanol formation in the CEF of C. beijerinckii, a negative correlation was found between the H2 formation and NR dosage. It is well known that the production of H2 and butanol would compete for the electron generated in Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway [16]. With more electrons induced to the formation of butanol, less H2 will certainly be produced by C. beijerinckii. The highest ER and ERE of 252.04 ± 16.17 kJ/L and 77.93 ± 4.86% obtained in the CEF-B2 (Table 1) further confirmed that the most favorable NR dosage for the co-production of butanol and H2 in the CEF of C. beijerinckii was 0.50 mmol/L."
9,Effect of glucose concentration on the ABE fermentation,"3.3 Effect of glucose concentration on the ABE fermentation As available substrate has been considered as another crucial factor affecting the performance of bacterial fermentation [32], initial glucose concentration of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 g/L was employed in CEF-C1, CEF-C2, CEF-C3, CEF-C4 and CEF-C5, respectively, to find the optimal substrate concentration for the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii in CEF system. The results showed that the glucose of 10 and 20 g/L in the CEF-C1 and CEF-C2 was almost consumed (8.74 ± 0.54 g/L and 19.27 ± 0.40 g/L) with the obtained OD600 of 1.32 ± 0.16 and 1.99 ± 0.28, respectively, by the end of fermentation (Fig. 5 A). Though the glucose consumption was increased to 21.4 ± 1.08 and 22.61 ± 0.83 g/L with the increased OD600 of 2.27 ± 0.17 and 2.26 ± 0.13 in the CEF-C3 and CEF-C4, respectively, more and more glucose was remained by the end of fermentation. When the initial glucose was further increased to 50 g/L, the glucose consumption in the CEF-C5 was only 24.15 ± 0.86 g/L with the OD600 as low as 1.33 ± 0.14. Similar research reported initial glucose concentration higher than 120 g/L would inhibit the microbial growth [32]. However, the present research observed an obvious lower inhibitory load of glucose. Along with the initial glucose increased from 10 g/L to 30 g/L, the production of butanol in the CEF-C1 and CEF-C3 was significantly increased from 2.56 ± 0.17 g/L to 6.40 ± 0.19 g/L, respectively (Fig. 5B). When the initial glucose concentration was further increased to 40 and 50 g/L, butanol production was slightly decreased to 6.21 ± 0.30 g/L and 5.88 ± 0.29 g/L in the CEF-C4 and CEF-C5, respectively. Butanol selectivity in the CEF-C1, CEF-C2, CEF-C3, CEF-C4 and CEF-C5 varied between 72.06 ± 2.97% (CEF-C4) and 79.18 ± 1.39% (CEF-C2) (referred to Fig. S3 for the data of acetone), with the butanol yield ranged from 0.24 ± 0.01 g/g (0.58 ± 0.02 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) to 0.30 ± 0.01 g/g (0.73 ± 0.02 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) (Fig. 5B). The results indicated that 30 g/L was the most favorable initial glucose concentration for butanol formation in the present CEF system. Different from the butanol production, H2 production and yield were progressively enhanced from 0.59 ± 0.07 L/L and 65.87 ± 11.75 mL/g in CEF-C1 to 3.91 ± 0.35 L/L and 162.43 ± 20.30 mL/g in CEF-C5, respectively (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the highest ER and ERE of 271.12 ± 7.13 kJ/L and 77.08 ± 0.82% were still obtained in the CEF-C3 (Table 1), indicating again that the initial glucose of 30 g/L was suitable for the co-production of butanol and H2 in the CEF of C. beijerinckii."
10,Effect of exogenous butyric acid on the ABE fermentation,"3.4 Effect of exogenous butyric acid on the ABE fermentation It is known that exogenous butyric acid can be transformed to butanol with the sequential catalysis of CoA-transferase, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase and butanol dehydrogenase in the solventogenesis phase of ABE fermentation process [8]. While exogenous butyric acid has been reported as the co-substrate of glucose to improve the butanol production of Clostridia [10,29,30]. On the other hand, NADH is needed by the formation of butanol in the ABE fermentation process of Clostridia [8]. And the redox state (NADH/NAD+ ratio) and energy level (ATP availability) in clostridia would be altered with the extra electrons derived from cathode in a CEF system, which would result in a higher up-taken rate of exogenous butyric acid [23,42]. To further enhance the butanol production in the present CEF systems, exogenous butyric acid of about 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00 and 6.00 g/L was loaded into the CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4, CEF-D5 and CEF-D6, respectively, in the present of 30 g/L glucose and 0.50 mmol/L NR. The six CEF systems were all conducted at the same favorable cathode potential of -0.60 V with the results illustrated in Fig. 6 . As shown as Fig. 6A, glucose as the main substrate was gradually consumed with the CEF processes of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. By the end of fermentation, a glucose consumption of 21.31 ± 1.47, 25.50 ± 0.34, 27.37 ± 0.89, 26.79 ± 0.72, 27.66 ± 0.86 and 10.49 ± 0.69 g/L was observed in the CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4, CEF-D5 and CEF-D6, respectively (Table 2). Previous research reported that addition of butyric acid would provide enhanced buffering capacity of the medium and trigger a metabolic shift from acetogenesis to solventogenesis during ABE fermentation. Such effect of additional butyric acid aided the growth of C. beijerinckii by preventing extremely acidic conditions and sustain the continuous consumption of glucose resulting higher utilization rate of glucose [29]. It was also found that the glucose consumption rates in the CEF systems with the additional butyric acid (Fig. 6A) were slower than those without exogenous butyric acid (Fig. 2A). It was reported that high level of undissociated butyric acid before the exponential phase of fermentation would prolong the lag phase [30,44]. The glucose consumption (Fig. 6A) and biomass accumulation (Fig. 6B) herein also validated that exogenous butyric acid functioned as an inhibitor to the growth of C. beijerinckii. The growth of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in the CEF systems had also been affected by the exogenous butyric acid (Fig. 6B). With the additional butyric acid of about 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00 g/L, the maximum biomass accumulation in the CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4, and CEF-D5 were all achieved on the second day of the fermentation processes, with the OD600 of 2.21 ± 0.06, 2.21 ± 0.07, 2.11 ± 0.11, 1.93 ± 0.06 and 1.59 ± 0.05, respectively. The decreasing trend of microbial growth with the increasing exogenous butyric acid in the five CEF systems possibly because of the increased formation of solvents which had restricted the growth of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 [44]. By the end of fermentation, the OD600 in the five CEF systems decreased to 2.10 ± 0.03, 1.75 ± 0.17, 1.47 ± 0.08, 1.31 ± 0.03 and 0.98 ± 0.08, respectively. With the exogenous butyric acid of 6.00 g/L (Fig. 6B), the microbial growth was dramatically inhibited with the maximum and final OD600 as low as 0.66 ± 0.08 and 0.60 ± 0.08 in the CEF-D6. The obviously inhibited growth of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was also due to the autolysis and spore formation in the adverse environmental stress that had been resulted in the massive butyric acid and the increased solvents [44–46]. Consistent with the previous studies [10], the exogenous butyric acid had enhanced the utilization of glucose and butanol production in the present CEF systems. As illustrated in Fig. 6C, a butanol production of 6.54 ± 0.38, 9.76 ± 0.63, 10.85 ± 0.45, 10.67 ± 0.70 and 10.55 ± 0.66 g/L was obtained in the CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4 and CEF-D5 with the exogenous butyric acid of about 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00 g/L, respectively, by the end of fermentation. The obtained butanol yield in the five CEF systems (Fig. 6D) was 0.31 ± 0.00, 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.40 ± 0.00, 0.40 ± 0.04 and 0.38 ± 0.04 g-butanol/g-glucose (0.49 ± 0.01, 0.57 ± 0.05, 0.60 ± 0.01 and 0.56 ± 0.05 mol-C/mol-C), respectively. With the acetone production ranged from 1.99 ± 0.14 to 2.53 ± 0.23 g/L (Fig. S4), the butanol selectivity in the five CEF systems was counted to 76.66 ± 2.30%, 79.37 ± 2.54%, 82.26 ± 0.57%, 82.27 ± 0.26% and 82.00 ± 2.30%, respectively (Fig. 6D). Because the solvents more than 10 g/L could evidently inhibit microbial growth [44], an observable decrease in biomass (OD600) (Fig. 6B) was observed along with the massive accumulation of butanol in the four CEF systems (Fig. 6C). However, when the exogenous butyric acid was further increased to 6.00 g/L in the CEF-D6, few butanol was produced due to the toxicity of the excess exogenous butyric acid to C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 [28,44]. Though having been reported as the co-substrate of glucose to enhance butanol production of clostridia, the identified feasible exogenous butyric acid was not more than 5.00 g/L [28–30]. Nevertheless, an excellent butanol production as high as 10.55 ± 0.66 g/L was also obtained in the present CEF system with the exogenous butyric acid of about 5.00 g/L. The enhanced tolerance of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 to the exogenous butyric acid should be contributed to the altered NADH/NAD+ ratio and the improved ATP availability due to the extra electrons from the cathode [23], which had resulted in (i) the adaption of the bacterium to the stress of butyric acid [22,42], and (ii) the enhanced assimilation of exogenous butyric acid in the solventogenesis phase of ABE fermentation [13,24,34,47]. The results illustrated in Fig. 6E presented that the favorable exogenous butyric acid was about 2.00 g/L (CEF-D2) or 3.00 g/L (CEF-D3) to produce H2. The H2 production and yield in the CEF-D2 reached 4.29 ± 0.31 L/L and 168.23 ± 13.55 mL/g, both of which were very similar to that of 4.33 ± 0.40 L/L and 161.69 ± 19.28 mL/g in the CEF-D3, respectively. Though the glucose was also completely consumed in the CEF-D4 (about 4.00 g/L) and CEF-D5 (about 5.00 g/L) (Fig. 6A), the H2 production decreased to 3.45 ± 0.26 and 3.51 ± 0.33 L/L with the H2 yield of 129.07 ± 13.17 and 127.15 ± 15.90 mL/g, respectively. Distinct decrease of the exogenous butyric acid was mainly observed in the first two days in the six CEF processes (Fig. 6F). As shown as Fig. 6F, the loaded exogenous butyric acid in the CEF-D1, CEF-D2, CEF-D3, CEF-D4 and CEF-D5 was determined as 0.96 ± 0.06, 2.52 ± 0.12, 3.39 ± 0.20, 4.08 ± 0.09 and 4.80 ± 0.13 g/L, respectively. And the residual butyric acid in the five CEF systems by the end of fermentation was averaged 0.53 ± 0.06, 0.81 ± 0.07, 1.16 ± 0.09, 1.14 ± 0.08 and 1.90 ± 0.16 g/L, respectively. The results suggested most of the loaded exogenous butyric acid in the five CEF processes had been assimilated by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, which had contributed to the improved butanol production in the systems (Fig. 6C and D). Butanol production enhanced by the re-assimilation of butyric acid in ABE fermentation was also confirmed by the previously researches [24,32]. In addition, supplementation of butyric acid would be re-assimilated by C. beijerinckii and converted to butyl-CoA, followed by the enhanced butanol production in the presence of NADH, resulting the higher butanol selectivity [29]. Though assimilation of exogenous butyric acid was also observed in the first day, the butyric acid in the CEF-D6 was obviously increased from the initial 5.74 ± 0.38 g/L to 7.46 ± 0.46 g/L with the butanol production as low as 0.16 ± 0.01 g/L by the end of fermentation (Fig. 6F). Obviously, the butyric acid concentration as high as 5.74 ± 0.38 g/L had led to a high level un-dissociated butyric acid, resulting in a bad restriction to the growth (Fig. 6B) and metabolism (Fig. 6A, C, E and F) of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 [44]. Also, both ER and ERE were significantly improved regarding to the assimilation of exogenous butyric acid. As shown in the Table 1, the highest ER of 446.90 ± 21.39 kJ/L and ERE of 95.85 ± 1.62% coming to the CEF-D3 indicated that the exogenous butyric acid of about 3.00 g/L was more conducive to the co-production of butanol and H2 in the CEF system. It has been reported that the production of butanol would compete for electrons with the formation of H2 in traditional ABE fermentation, which lead to the low co-production efficiency of butanol and H2 [34,48]. However, both production of butanol and H2 were significantly improved in the present CEF system. With the most favorable cathode potential of -0.60 V, NR dosage of 0.50 mmol/L, initial glucose of 30 g/L and exogenous butyric acid concentration of about 3.00 g/L, the excellent production of 10.85 ± 0.45 g/L butanol and 4.33 ± 0.40 L/L H2 was obtained in the CEF-D3 system (Fig. 6). The results confirmed that the co-production of butanol and H2 could be simultaneously enhanced by the extra electrons derived from cathode in CEF system [41]."
11,Efficiency evaluation of the CEF process,"3.5 Efficiency evaluation of the CEF process It is well known that metabolic flux distribution between the oxidative and reductive pathway can be regulated by NADH/NAD+ ratio to maintain redox balance in the fermentation processes of bacteria [47,49]. But an unbalanced fermentation can be realized in CEF processes with the variation of NADH/NAD+ ratio induced by the extra electrons from cathode [22,23,42,50]. As shown in Fig. 7 , the additional electrons from cathode varied the intercellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, resulting the enhanced co-production of butanol and hydrogen. The regulated NADH/NAD+ ratio would further affect the gene expression and enzyme synthesis involved in the fermentation, resulting in the variation of products profiles [51]. The unbalanced fermentation process allows CEF processes to surmount the theoretical redox balance and improve the yield and selectivity of target products such as alcohols and H2 [41,52]. To evaluate the energy recovery efficiency of the present CEF process in the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, the production of butanol and H2 in the ABE fermentation of clostridia reported in last five years were summarized in Table 3 , with the present results as a comparison. The research on strain C. beijerinckii F-6 showed that a butanol titer as high as 10.66 g/L could be obtained in the presence of 60 g/L glucose as the sole substrate [37]. The butanol selectivity<66.4% resulted in a butanol yield as low as 0.22 g/g-glucose (0.54 mol-butanol/mol-glucose). Combined with the H2 yield of 99.57 mL/g-glucose, the ERE in the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii F-6 achieved 59.13%. Stein and coworkers evaluated the effect of exogenous butyric acid on the ABE fermentation of C. acetobutylicum DSMZ 792 using glucose as the main substrate [53]. The research revealed that 2.00 g/L exogenous butyric acid had reduced the H2 yield from 246.15 mL/g-glucose (without exogenous butyric acid) to 185.42 mL/g-glucose, without obvious change in the butanol yield of 0.17 g/g-glucose (0.42 mol-C/mol-C). As a result, the ERE in the ABE fermentation was decreased from 59.38% to<54.50%. He and coworkers reported a 10.50 g/L butanol with the yield of 0.25 g/g-glucose (0.61 mol-butanol/mol-glucose) in a NR-mediated CEF system (-0.70 V vs Ag/AgCl) fed with 50 g/L glucose as the sole substrate [21]. However, the ERE was only 62.08% due to the low H2 yield of 50.24 mL/g-glucose. In our previous research, a NR-mediated CEF system (-0.75 V vs Ag/AgCl) was also constructed for the co-production of butanol and H2 by the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 [13]. In the presence of 20 g/L glucose as the sole substrate and 0.50 mmol/L NR as EM, the yield of butanol and H2 reached 0.30 g/g-glucose and 206.53 mL/g, respectively, with the ERE as high as 87.47%."
12,Conclusion,"In the present research, a cathodic electro-fermentation process of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was optimized to improve the co-production of butanol and H2. The favorable conditions for the cathodic electro-fermentation process were as follows: -0.60 V (vs Ag/AgCl) cathode potential, 0.50 mmol/L neutral red, 30 g/L initial glucose and 3.00 g/L exogenous butyric acid. Under the optimal condition, the production of butanol and H2 reached 10.85 ± 0.45 g/L and 4.33 ± 0.40 L/L in the CEF system, with the yield as high as 0.40 g/g-glucose (0.60 mol/mol-C) and 161.69 mL/g, respectively. The ER and ERE were remarkably improved to 446.90 ± 21.39 kJ/L-medium and 95.85 ± 1.62%, respectively. Though the findings have demonstrated the optimized CEF process an effective approach to manipulating the microbial metabolism of Clostridia for enhancing the co-production of butanol and H2, performance of the bio-refinery process in the ABE fermentation with lignocellulosic biomass as primary materials should be further evaluated for future applications."
