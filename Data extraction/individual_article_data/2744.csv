0,Introduction,"Hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] popularly known as HAp is a calcium phosphate-based ceramic material which naturally occurs in rocks and mammalian hard tissues (Chattanathan et al., 2013). The stoichiometric ratio (Ca/P) of HAp is 1.67 (Miculescu et al., 2017; Manoj et al., 2016). This material has been known to have chemical similarities to mammalian bones therefore applied as osteoclasts, dental fabrications, and other biomedical materials (Figueiredo et al., 2010; Manoj et al., 2015). In the field of industrial catalysis, HAp serve as a good material due to its very wide surface area. Also, the stoichiometry of HAp can be modified with other elements to make it Ca-deficient hence very active for catalytical processes (Mori et al., 2002). Non-stoichiometric HAp or Ca-deficient HAp is catalytically active therefore used for alcohol elimination reactions (Kibby and Hall, 1973), Michael addition reactions (Zahouily et al., 2003), CO oxidation processes (Domínguez et al., 2009), etc. An important area of hydroxyapatite application is the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants particularly the removal of industrial dyes from wastewater. Dyes used in industrial processes such as manufacturing of cosmetics, leather processing, fabrics and textiles production, etc., results in environmental pollution. It sometimes become extremely difficult to remove dyes in environment matrices because their degradation is affected by some factors such as pH, light, concentration, etc. Their removal from industrial effluents or the environment requires an efficient but cheap catalyst. Researchers tend to use Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) to remove wide range of pollutants from environmental matrices due to the efficiency of the process. AOPs are some of the effective techniques that generate highly reactive species such as •OH, •O2 −, •OOH, etc. that help in the degradation of pollutant dyes. Examples of AOPs are ozonation, Fenton process (Miao et al., 2020), electrochemical oxidation (Lu et al., 2020), activated persulphate oxidation (He et al., 2020), heterogenous photocatalysis (Murcia et al., 2020), UV/H2O2 processes (AlHamedi et al., 2009). The use of HAp coupled with metal or metal oxides and pure or single-phase HAp for wastewater remediation is on the rise due to the cheap nature of this catalyst and the acceptable removal efficiencies that comes with its usage (Manoj et al., 2019). Though pure HAp is known to have catalytic/photocatalytic potential (Reeta Mary et al., 2018), efficiencies achieved with pure HAp is not very high as compared to doped HAp or multicomponent mixtures of HAp. This could be explained as the lesser number of active sites available in unadulterated HAp. However, with the introduction of a metal or metal oxide into the lattice of HAp, the photocatalytic efficiency simultaneously increases (Mishra et al., 2019; Monfort et al. Plesch). Insertion of metals into HAp lattice by doping, composite formation or complex formation enhances light absorption in the UV region. This provides the prepared catalyst with a suitable bandgap energy that encourages the easy generation of electron-hole pairs (e− - h+) for pollutant degradation and prevents the recombination of electron holes to sustain pollutants removal. Though there is difficulty in preparing HAp-based nanomaterials without surfactants or capping agents, we successfully achieved a surfactant-free hydrothermally synthesized nanomixture by introducing precursors of aluminum, tin and titanium into HAp lattice to form zero-dimensional ternary metal oxides cooperating with one-dimensional Hydroxyapatite nanorods (HAp-TiO2- SnO2–Al2O3). The 1-D HAp nanorods acted as the holding material for 0-D metal oxides. Titanium oxide (TiO2), tin oxide (SnO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been successfully employed as photocatalysts for degradation of different kind of dyes (Feng et al., 2016). It is due to their unique physicochemical properties like large surface to volume ratio, cations with empty orbitals and charge deficient anions (Gangwar et al., 2016). We took advantage of the cheapness of HAp production therefore added low concentrations of relatively expensive metal precursors to form a new kind of nanostructured mixture without surfactants/templates. In this way, an overall cheap but efficient nanophotocatalyst was produced for wastewater treatment and for alternative hydrogen gas production. To the best of our knowledge and literature survey, this is the first report on the development of this kind of catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Calcium acetate monohydrate (∼98%), Ammonium phosphate dibasic (∼99%), Tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate (∼99%), and Aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate (∼99%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd., China. Titanium (IV) chloride solution was purchased from Shanghai RichJoint Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Rhodamine B of analytical grade and 30% wt. liquid Ammonia were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis route,"2.2 Synthesis route 3.5233 g of calcium acetate monohydrate was dissolved into 20 mL of distilled water and stirred for 15 min at moderate speed to form a 1 M solution. 1.7696 g of ammonium phosphate dibasic was weighed into 20 mL of distilled water and then stirred moderately for 15 min to form 0.67 M solution. pH of the prepared ammonium phosphate dibasic solution was adjusted between 10 and 10.5 using 30 % wt. liquid ammonia amid continuous stirring. Ammonium phosphate dibasic solution was then added drop wisely into the calcium precursor solution. This addition was done slowly within the time range of 30 min to form a homogeneous mixture. pH of the formed mixture was again raised to about 10.5 using 30 % wt NH3. 0.3 M of Ti, Sn and Al precursors solution were added carefully into the above-mentioned mixture and stirred for 20 min. Afterwards, the obtained final mixture was transferred into Teflon mediated stainless steel autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 24 h in a hot air oven. White colored precipitates from the hydrothermal treatment was then washed with distilled water 4 to 5 times and dried for 24 h. The dried precipitates were ground evenly, coded as Hydroxyapatite Nano Mixture (HNM), then stored for characterization studies. Small portion of the as-synthesized powder was calcined at 600 °C for 1 h for evaluating the differences in structural properties between the as-synthesized and calcined samples. The schematic diagram for the preparation procedure is shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization of HNM and catalytic studies,"2.3 Characterization of HNM and catalytic studies 2.3.1 Characterization of HNM Morphological images of HNM were captured through field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) coupled with EDX spectrometer (MERLIN Compact, ZEISS, GEMINI), and transmission electron microscope (Philips, Technai 12). X-Ray diffraction crystallography of HNM was recorded using XRD-6000 SHIMADZU diffractometer with Cu Kα (0.15406 nm) radiation. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy studies were conducted using Renishaw Laser Raman Spectrometer with 532 nm laser and Agilent Cary FTIR spectrometer. XPS spectra were recorded using Thermo Scientific (ESCALAB 250Xi) instrument with Al-Kα. BELSORP-max was utilized to investigate specific surface area (SSA), pore volume and pore diameter of the prepared HNM according to N2 adsorption-desorption principle. The band gap of the prepared nanomaterials was measured using UV–Vis spectra recorded on UV-2550 UV–Vis SHIMADZU spectrophotometer. 2.3.2 Photocatalytic studies The photodegradation potential of the synthesized nanomixture (HAp-TiO2-SnO2-Al2O3) was assessed by testing the nanoparticles under UV-irradiation using Rhodamine B dye solution as synthetic wastewater (model pollutant). The as-synthesized HNM sample was used for all photocatalytic experiments. Reaction conditions such as RhB concentration (5 ppm and 20 ppm), pH (3,7, and 12.5) of the dye solution and amount of catalyst (25 mg, 50 mg) were varied to obtain an optimum environmental remediation condition. pH of the pollutant dye solution was modified using dilute amounts of HCl and NaOH. In a typical experiment, 25 mg/50 mg of HNM was dispersed into six different transparent beakers containing 5 ppm RhB solution. The solution was stirred devoid of sunlight to ascertain adsorption/desorption equilibrium between HNM and RhB dye molecules for 1 h. The reaction medium was irradiated with a 300 W Xenon UV source (λ max = 365 nm). The light was supplied with 700 mA current at voltage 3.5–3.8. Samples were collected every 15 min for most part of the experiment, filtered using a syringe filter to avoid catalyst material from entering the cuvette. The same experimental procedure was repeated using 20 ppm of RhB solution. The absorbance of each solution was measured using UV–Vis Spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan) at 554 nm. 2.3.3 Hydrogen evolution using HNM 50 mg of HNM was dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10% (V/V triethanoamine. 100 μL of chloroplatinic acid aqueous solution (H2PtCl66H2O, 0.04 g mL−1) was added to the solution, and stirred for 30 min H2PtCl66H2O was used as a precursor for Pt; a co-catalyst for H2 evolution. After the system was evacuated, a 300 W Xenon light source (400 nm cut filter) was used to illuminate the system, 3% (w/w) of Pt in-situ light was then deposited on the catalyst surface. Automatic analysis of hydrogen gas produced online was obtained by gas chromatography (TCD detector, N2 as carrier gas) for every 20 min for 1 h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural analysis of HNM,"3.1 Structural analysis of HNM 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction crystallography of HNM X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography of as-prepared HNM as shown in Fig. 2 reveals crystalline form of HAp that corresponds to hexagonal phase with JCPDS card number 09–0432 of space group P63/mm (176). Very strong diffraction peaks occurred at 31.77 ° , 32.19 ° and 32.90 ° . There were also moderate diffraction peaks at 22.90 ° , 25.35 ° , and 28.96 ° al l which are for HAp. Diffraction peaks occurred for Ti, Sn, and Al but the metals have been converted to their corresponding oxide form owing to the aqueous reaction medium and changes in pH which could be ascribed to 30 % wt NH3 used. For alumina (Al2O3), diffraction peaks occurred at 40.23 ° , 46.94 ° , 49.35 ° , and 57.91 ° in alignment with JCPDS # 10–0414; Titanate (TiO2) peaks occurred at 39.82 ° and 53.99 ° also in agreement with JCPDS # 21–1236; Stannate (SnO2) has a peak occurring at 33.89 ° that represents Cassirite and corresponds to JCPDS file number 41–1445. HAp peaks for the sample calcined at 600 ° C for 1 h occurred at 25.35 ° , 25.88 ° , 31.77 ° , 32.19 ° of which the latter two peaks are most intense with JCPDS card number 09–0432. Metal oxide peaks also occurred in the calcined sample but the peak intensities are depressed and slightly shifted (Fig. 2). Generally, unadulterated HAp peaks appear sharper and more defined than shown in this research. HAp peak intensities from Fig. 2 (both calcined and as-synthesized) decreased because of the presence of TiO2, SnO2, and Al2O3 which means that the metal oxides entered into HAp matrix/lattice. This observation is made in other research works (Huang et al., 2011). This is further confirmed from the differences in calculated lattice parameters of HNM (Table 1 ). The average crystallite sizes were calculated according to Debye Scherrer’s formula for both as-synthesized and calcined samples. The as-synthesized sample has an average crystallite size of 12.53 nm while the calcined one has an average crystallite size of 14.94 nm. 3.1.2 Raman spectroscopy of HNM The samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy to determine the bending or stretching of OH and (PO4 3−) bonds in the crystal structure. Since there is the possibility of metal or metal oxides existing in the synthesized HAp, bands corresponding to alumina, stannate, and titanate were also observed (Fig. 3 ). According to G. Herzberg, a free phosphate ion has four Raman-active modes mostly assigned as ν1 (980 cm−1), ν2 (363 cm−1), ν3 (1082 cm−1), and ν4 (514 cm−1) (Herzberg, 1945). These peaks are observed for HNM, but slightly shifted due to the presence of metal ions (Shea et al., 1974). The peak at 960 cm−1 for the as-synthesized HNM clearly indicates the symmetric stretching mode (ν1) of the phosphate group PO4 3− and crystalline nature of HAp in HNM. At 480 cm−1, a very strong/well-defined symmetric bending mode (ν2) of the phosphate ions was observed. The lower peak at 1080 cm−1 is ascribed to the asymmetric stretching mode (ν3) of PO4 3− groups. The band at 540 cm−1 represents the bending mode (ν4) of the phosphate group. According to the group theory, there are 15 types of lattice vibration mode for rutile SnO2 of which only A1g, B1g, B2g, Eg are Raman active (Xiong et al., 1997; Scott, 1970). The Raman shift represented by a slightly broad peak at higher wavenumber 800 cm−1 represents B2g mode of nano tin oxide. From the Raman spectra, the shift observed at 150 cm−1 is assignable to the anatase form of TiO2 (Priyanka et al., 2014). The peaks for amorphous alumina are mostly situated in between the range 700–1000 cm−1. Since, the alumina formed is in the nano range, two sharp peaks located at (1460-1525 cm−1) represents shifts corresponding to alumina. For the calcined HNM, the lower and shifted peak at 950 cm−1 is assignable to symmetric stretching mode (ν1) of the phosphate group. There is a very strong symmetric bending mode (ν2) of the phosphate group which is shown at around 480 cm−1. An asymmetric stretching mode (ν3) at 1080 cm−1 of PO4 3− is very evident. Also, there is a Raman peak represented at 560 cm−1 which is ascribed to bending mode (ν4) of the phosphate group. The slightly broadened peak near 650 cm−1 in both spectrums (as-synthesized and calcined) could be attributed to (OH−) liberation in the lattice structure (Shea et al., 1974). The slight Raman shift denoted by the peak at almost 790 cm−1 represents nano stannic oxide. This is in accordance with the B2g mode of nano SnO2 (Katiyar et al., 1971). After heat treatment (calcination), the peak at 150 cm−1 for the as-synthesized sample diminished significantly. This could be due to the formation of a new form of TiO2 (rutile). Most peaks are significantly shifted due to the presence of ternary metal oxides in the nanomixture. 3.1.3 FTIR analysis of HNM FTIR analysis was also performed to strengthen the structural study of HNM. The spectra shown in Fig. 4 revealed peaks that describe the bonding nature in the nanomixture within wavenumber 400 to 4000 cm−1. The peak at 1400 cm−1 represents atmospheric CO2 absorbed during the course of reaction (Cheng et al., 1998). However, calcination at 600 °C decreased the carbonate bond significantly. CO2 been a gas is almost completely driven out during calcination. Two peaks located at 3140 and 3470 cm−1 could be ascribed to the hydroxyl (OH) groups in the HAp nanostructure. Metal-oxygen bonding peaks at 560, 1580 and 1670 cm−1 are assignable to Sn–O, Al–O and Ti–O vibrations respectively. These peaks describe the metal oxides infused into HAp nanostructure and are responsible for the slight shifts of major and known bands of phosphate and hydroxyl groups of HAp. The remaining peaks at 480, 605, 620, 960, 1040, and 1100 cm−1 are attributed to the bending and stretching modes of phosphate groups. ν2 bending vibrations at 480, ν4 triply degenerate bending mode of PO4 at 605 and 620, ν1 asymmetric stretching of (PO4 3−) bonds at 960, and ν3 triply degenerate asymmetric stretching mode of P–O bonds at 1040 and 1100 cm−1. Most of these peaks are slightly shifted and suppressed in the calcined HAp nanomixture. 3.1.4 XPS analysis of HNM X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy spectra was used to define the atomic valence state and possible chemical bonds that exist in the HAp-TiO2-SnO2-Al2O3 nanomixture as shown in Fig. 5 . The peak located at 73.84 eV for Al 2p is assignable to Al–O–Al. Ti spectra line consisting of two main peaks due to spin orbital splitting located at 458.18 eV for 2P3/2 and 463.78 eV for 2P1/2 represents the oxides of Ti. The splitting of Ti 2 P doublet is 5.7 eV (Reddy et al., 2001). For Tin, split orbital spectra line 3d5/2 positioned at 486.23 eV and 3d3/2 at 494.65 eV with a split doublet energy of 8.5 eV represent the Sn–O–Sn bonds of stannate (Szuber et al., 2001). The converted cations help to increase the charge carrier potential of HNM thereby enhancing catalytic potential. Ca spectra has two peaks located at 350.34 eV for Ca 2P1/2 and 346.81 eV for Ca 2P3/2. The splitting of Ca 2 P orbital is 3.5 eV. These peak positions of Ca 2p clearly indicates hydroxyapatite formation rather than calcium oxide or other calcium phosphate forms. A peak at 133.04 eV represents (P 2p) phosphate group of HAp and oxygen O1s peak observed at 530.74 eV. We therefore concluded that the added elements exist as oxides in the prepared HNM."
7,Morphological and surface analysis of HNM,"3.2 Morphological and surface analysis of HNM 3.2.1 FESEM, TEM and EDS of HNM The morphological features of the prepared HNM was captured through FESEM and TEM. FESEM image of as-synthesized HNM is shown in Fig. 6 a which reveal rod-like particles are present in the sample. In order to confirm the rod morphology of the prepared HNM, TEM was performed. The TEM images (Fig. 6b and c) revealed rod morphology of HAp and the average size was found to be below 50 nm. However, slight agglomeration was observed which is due to Ostwald ripening (Nguyen and Kim, 2016). Ostwald ripening of the metal oxides is due to their high solubility and surface energy. This causes smaller metal oxides to redissolve and grow into bigger particles shown as distributed clusters within HAp nanorods. The average size of these particles is below 10 nm. HAp growth in solution could be explained by Orientated attachment mechanism. HAp nanorods could be seen as having a common crystallographic alignment if not all for most particles (Fig. 6c) (Penn and Banfield, 1999). The prepared HNM looked very pure devoid of other forms of calcium such as tricalciumphosphates (β-TCP), calcium oxide, etc. This result is in strong agreement with X-ray diffraction crystallography which indicated crystalline form of HAp. Fig. 6a1, b1 & c1 show FESEM and TEM images of calcined HNM. These figures reveal that the calcined sample is also composed of nanorods of HAp with metal oxides (TiO2–SnO2–Al2O3). Here, the rods are elongated and randomly distributed with slight structural distortion due to calcination. Average size of the HAp nanorods are below 50 nm and the metal oxides also existed as particles with size below 10 nm. There is no significant change observed between the as-prepared and calcined HNM. EDS spectra of the as-prepared and calcined HNM is given in. Fig. 6d & d1. The spectra confirm the existence of HAp components (Ca, P, O) and elements Ti, Sn and Al. Moreover, there are no other peaks in the spectra which confirm that there are no impurities in the prepared HNM. 3.2.2 BET-BJH analysis of HNM The Specific surface area (SSA) was determined by the BET method. The pore volume and pore size distributions were obtained through BJH method. The analysis was carried out over nitrogen gas at 77.0 K. Both samples exhibit type IV isotherm according to IUPAC rule with H3 type hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 7 a and b. Mostly, the type IV isotherm is likened to solids with micro and mesopores. Powders with type IV isotherms also exhibit capillary condensation due to adsorption between gas molecules used in the experiment and the adsorbent. Since capillary condensation occurred, the adsorption path will definitely be different from desorption path which will result in the formation of loops called Hysteresis loop which are of four kinds: H1, H2, H3, and H4. From these isotherms, the H3 hysteresis loop has been observed for all two samples analyzed (as-synthesized and calcined). The metal oxides may have provided an additional specific surface area to the various particles of the overall nanomixture. SSA closed up after calcination because of expansion due to heat. After expansion, the surfaces of adjacent particles stuck together therefore a reduction in SSA of the calcined sample. While the particles expand, their mean pore diameter also increases. The BET specific surface area (SSA) of HNM seem to decrease after calcination. Table 2 summarizes the data from BET-BJH analysis."
8,Optical analysis of HNM,"3.3 Optical analysis of HNM The optical properties of the synthesized HAp-TiO2-SnO2-Al2O3 nanomixture were studied by UV–Vis spectrophotometry. Tauc plot was used to estimate the optical band gap for both as-synthesized and calcined samples (Fig. 8a1 & a2). The optical band gap was obtained by plotting a graph of ( α h v )2 against ( h v ) in the high absorption region assuming HNM is semiconductor with direct band gap energy. Taking α as the coefficient of absorbance and h v as incident photonic energy. The linear portion of the graph was extended to touch the h v axis to estimate the band gap (Eg) of HNM. The optical band gap for the synthesized HNM was 3.25 eV and 3.26 eV for the calcined sample. According to literature survey, pure/non-photocatalytic HAp has a band gap (Eg) of around 5 eV in the Ultraviolet C region. However, this value decreases once photocatalytic materials (metal/metal oxides) are introduced into the crystal structure or when HAp is combusted at higher temperatures (∼1000 °C ) which could lead to oxygen deficiency in the phosphate groups hence further reduction of Eg to around 3.45 eV in the Ultraviolet A region (Bystrov et al., 2016). In this work, three different photocatalytic metal oxides have been introduced into HAp lattice hence the reduction in value from 5 eV to 3.25 eV and 3.26 eV respectively. The absorption edge gap was observed around 390 nm for the as-synthesized HNM and at almost 400 nm for calcined HNM. (Fig. 8b1 & b2). Anmin et al. indicated that pure HAp absorption edge gap is around 230 nm (Hu et al., 2007). This value is typically for insulators meaning the catalytic/photocatalytic efficiency will be very little. In our study, there is a shift from 230 nm to 390 nm for the as-synthesized sample and 400 nm for the calcined sample. These shifts occur a little into the UV region for HNM due to photocatalytic metal oxides (TiO2–SnO2–Al2O3)."
9,Photocatalytic studies,"3.4 Photocatalytic studies 3.4.1 Photocatalytic activity of HNM against RhB Photodegradation experiments were conducted using 5 ppm and 20 ppm of RhB solution at various pH (3, 7 and 12.5) conditions under UV irradiation at room temperature. The efficiency ( η ) of RhB removal by HNM was calculated using the formula: (1) η = ( Ci − Cf Ci × 100 ) % where, Ci is taken as the initial concentration of RhB solution, Cf as the concentration at any time, and concentration of the dye solution at different reaction times was evaluated from Beer-Lamberts law where the maximum Absorbance (λ max) is proportional to concentration (Parnis and Oldham, 2013). Photocatalytic reaction kinetics was analyzed using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model (Cui et al., 2013). (2) r i = − dC i dt = kKC i 1 + kKC i In this model, k is the reaction rate constant and K is the adsorption coefficient of the dye to the catalyst. When Ci is small (Ci < 10−3 M), kKCi ≪ 1 then equation (2) can be simplified to a pseudo-first-order equation: (3) r i = − dC i dt = kKC i Integrating (3) gives the following relationship: (4) ln ( C i C f ) = k obs t A plot of ln ( C i C f ) or -ln ( C f C i ) against irradiation (t) time yields the slope (kobs) which is the degradation rate constant of the photocatalytic process. The absorption spectrum of RhB shown in Figs. 9 and 11 indicated the intensity of the peaks gradually depresses. This concludes that the model pollutant dye is been removed from solution with increasing UV irradiation time. The highest peak at 554 nm was chosen to calculate degradation percentage of RhB. Rhodamine B is of heterocyclic xanthene family and has two important functional groups (chromophores and auxochromes) in its structure. The chromophores are light absorbing groups responsible for the deep pink color and auxochromes (-NR, –COOH) have shifting effect on the chromophore peaks (Thi et al., 2018). The impact of shifting effect is very low which is clearly observed in Figs. 9 and 11. Meanwhile, the absorption peaks intensity for CN, CC at 554 and 542 nm decreased with continuous irradiation. The gradual decrease of these absorption peaks reflects the removal of chromophores in RhB molecular structure. This confirms the effectiveness of the prepared HNM. The plot of ln ( C i C f ) against irradiation time (t) shows the rate of photodegradation efficiency between HNM and RhB followed a pseudo first order kinetics. The catalyst proved to be very effective in acidic medium (pH 3) where about 97% of dye was degraded within 30 min with a fast reaction rate 0.06178 min−1 using 5 ppm RhB and 50 mg of HNM (Fig. 10 b, b1). Conducting the same experiment with a higher concentration of RhB (20 ppm) yielded 98% degradation of RhB within 90 min at the same reaction conditions (50 mg HNM, pH 3) Fig. 12c1 , c2. The experiments conducted in basic medium (pH 12.5) also has better performance than the neutral condition (pH 7) as shown in Fig. 12b1 & b2 and Fig. 10b & b1. RhB removal is not entirely due to UV irradiation; percentages of RhB was adsorbed within 60 min in the dark. However, in some cases, dark adsorption is negligible; RhB adsorption in the dark is less at neutral pH condition. In acidic conditions (pH 3.0), dark adsorption is noticeable. The summary of various reaction conditions, measured degradation percentage, calculated degradation rate constants of all the experiments is given in Table 3 . From the details of Table 3, it is concluded that the prepared new kind of HAp based nanomixture has greater catalytic potential to degrade dye molecules. 3.4.2 Influence of photocatalyst loading Keeping other reaction conditions (pH, RhB concentration) the same while increasing catalyst loading yielded increased removal efficiencies in all respective pH media. For example, 5 ppm of RhB at pH 3 yielded a removal efficiency of 96.83% within 45 min of UV irradiation with rate constant (kobs) 0.04527 min−1 when HNM loading was 25 mg. Increasing HNM loading to 50 mg resulted in a removal efficiency of 97.26% within 30 min of UV irradiation with rate constant (kobs) 0.06178 min−1. This means total time required for optimum degradation reduced with increasing catalyst loading while degradation rate constant and efficiency increased. Similar observations were made using RhB at pH 7 and 12.5 while keeping other reaction conditions the same. This could be explained as the increase in active metal oxide sites that generate enough radicals to degrade RhB. 3.4.3 Influence of dye concentration The degradation of RhB in aqueous medium is greatly affected by the concentration of dye used. The highest degradation efficiencies and fastest degradation rates were all obtained at lower concentrations (5 ppm) of RhB. However, an increase in concentration to 20 ppm saw dips in value of degradation efficiencies and reaction rates. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ●O2 − and ●OH play an important role in organic cationic dye removal (Kondamareddy et al., 2018). Increasing RhB concentration results in the coverage of active sites of HNM catalyst. This decreases the formation of ROS hence a reduction in catalytic activity. Also, it takes much time for UV light to initiate photochemical reaction at higher RhB concentration. 3.4.4 Influence of pH of synthetic wastewater (RhB solution) The image in Fig. 13 depicts how the pH of synthetic wastewater influenced degradation of RhB. For the same amount of catalyst and RhB concentration, removal efficiencies were higher for pH 3.0 followed by pH 12.5 then very low for pH 7.0. For example, with 50 mg of HNM catalyst and 45 min of UV irradiation, 89.43% of RhB was removed at pH 3.0 while only 35.69% and 24.17% was removed for pH 12.5 and 7.0 respectively at the same time interval (Fig. 12 c1, b1 and a1). Addition of acid (dil. HCl) to RhB favors the formation of excess ●OH which leads to better oxidation/reduction reactions compared to pH 7.0 and 12.5 (Wang et al., 2014). HAp also has very lower solubility at neutral pH (Piccirillo and PM, 2017) therefore not enough radicals were produced in presence of the metal oxides at pH 7.0 as compared to pH 12.5 hence lesser degradation observed in neutral pH than basic condition. 3.4.5 Possible photodegradation mechanism of RhB by HNM The nanomixture acts better as an inorganic semiconductor than just a bioceramic catalyst material because hydroxyapatite plays a dual role. HAp acted as a heterogeneous photocatalyst as well as serve as a support for holding the incorporated metal oxides (TiO2–SnO2–Al2O3). The higher surface to volume ratio, improved specific surface area and mesoporous structure of HNM play a pivotal role in attaining a better degradation efficiency. In addition, HAp also has higher adsorption potential; this draws the model pollutant (RhB) towards highly active sites (TiO2–SnO2– Al2O3) to initiate photodegradation reaction (Piccirillo et al., 2017). After irradiation with energy (hν) greater or equal to band gap energy (3.25 eV) as confirmed from UV–Vis of the powdered sample, the metal oxides (MOs) promote electrons from the valence band into the conduction band hence create electron-hole pairs, the electrons (e−) combine with oxygen to form ●O2 −, the holes combine with H2O to form ●OH and H+ radicals (Fig. 14 ). These radicals further combine to produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ●OH, HO2 −●. HAp nanorods also act as a photocatalyst; in HAp, the ejected electrons come from PO4 3− groups. The radicals produced from e−/h+ reactions produce subsequent actives species (●OH, ●O2 −, and HO2 −●) which then attack RhB according to the reactions: (5) M O s + h v → e − + h + (6) H A p + h v → e − + h + (7) e − + O 2 → · O 2 − (8) h + + H 2 O → · O H + H + (9) · O 2 − + H + → H 2 − · (10) · O 2 − / · O H / H O 2 − · + R h B → ( C O 2 , H 2 O , a n d min e r a l b y p r o d u c t s ) 3.4.6 Benchmarking HNM photocatalytic performance with different forms of HAp-based catalysts Other researchers studied the possibility of using HAp-based catalysts for removing dyes in environmental samples. A comparison between HNM and other HAp-based catalysts is given in Table 4 . This benchmarking indicates that the type of substitutions in HAp crystal lattice and the reaction conditions during photocatalytic removal of the pollutants (dyes) influence resultant final efficiencies. This comparison therefore establishes HNM as a viable catalyst for industrial dye degradation. 3.4.7 Hydrogen evolution performance of HNM In the current experiment, there was no observed hydrogen gas evolved in the absence of 300 W Xenon light source, the experiment conducted with light irradiation yielded 27.524 μmol g−1 of H2 under 20 min. The next 20 min of light irradiation resulted in the production of 56.922 μmol g−1 of H2. For the third 20 min of experiment, 45.005 μmol g−1 (Fig. 15 a). Cumulatively, a total of 129.44 μmol g−1 of H2 was measured over a time course of 1 h (Fig. 15b). The excellent adsorption–desorption potential of HNM that lead to H2 production could be ascribed to the higher surface to volume ratio and the SSA confirmed through BET analysis. Also, the various metal oxide networks in HNM crystal structure (Ti–O–Ca, Sn–O–Ca, and Al–O–Ca) enhanced photocatalytic ability under light irradiation. However, further study is needed to enhance the amount of hydrogen production via water splitting. This can be done by changing various reaction parameters such as concentration of HNM, temperature, pH, light source, etc. and experimental conditions such as concentration of metal precursors in HNM preparation. 3.4.8 Benchmarking HNM hydrogen evolution performance with different forms of HAp-based catalysts After years of trying out carbon nitride as a suitable catalyst for hydrogen gas production by water splitting (Wang et al., 2009), attempts of using HAp-based catalysts also gained momentum during the last few decades. Though pure HAp is not very catalytic, introducing photocatalytic metals into HAp crystal structure also yield close results (Rojas-Trigos et al., 2019). Comparisons drawn from other works together with the current study is summarized in Table 5 below. This confirms HNM as a potential catalyst that can be exploited for hydrogen evolution reactions."
10,Conclusions,"A relatively cheap but efficient nanomixture of zero-dimensional ternary metal oxides (TiO2–SnO2–Al2O3) cooperating with one-dimensional hydroxyapatite (HAp-TiO2-SnO2-Al2O3) was successfully prepared through hydrothermal method without surfactants or structural directing agents. The average size of the nanorods and metal oxide particles was found to be below 50 nm and 10 nm respectively. XPS analysis confirmed the metal oxides were successfully trussed with HAp in the form of oxides. The prepared HNM is mesoporous in nature with mean pore diameter 11.55 nm and SSA of 112.08 m2 g−1. The excellent arrangement of metal oxide particles in HNM structure provides an overall band gap energy of 3.25 eV which is convenient for catalytical processes. Whereas reported unadulterated Hydroxyapatites could not yield very high degradation efficiencies within short time interval, the incorporation of the oxide forms of Ti, Sn, and Al expediates the disintegration of Rhodamine B into CO2, H2O and mineral byproducts under UV irradiation. Variations in performance of the catalyst was found to be greatly reliant on pH of reaction medium and the amount of catalyst used. For treating synthetic wastewater containing RhB, the catalyst works best in acidic medium where nearly 98% removal efficiency was achieved with 5 ppm of dye within 30 min. Raising RhB concentration to 20 ppm yielded almost the same results under 90 min of UV irradiation. 129.44 μmol g−1 of hydrogen was produced via water splitting within 60 min of light irradiation when alternative uses of HNM was explored. The observations and results of the present study suggested that it is possible to produce HNM on industrial scale for wastewater treatment and for hydrogen gas production."
