0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols is an alternative fuel to improve the octane number of gasoline and is recognized as a promising route for the production of clean fuels and petrochemical feed stocks from coal, natural gas, and hydrocarbon wastes via gasification [1,2]. Alkali-modified molybdenum catalysts in oxide and sulfide forms can be used for the synthesis of higher alcohols [3]. The sulfide form of these catalysts are more promising because of their excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning and high activity for water–gas shift reaction, as well as high tolerance to coke build up. This saves the cost of ultra-desulfurization for feed gas and water separation [4,5]. The control of product selectivity is of major interest because an Anderson–Schulz–Flory polymerisation process describes the product distribution over these catalysts [6]. For higher alcohols synthesis, CO should be activated both dissociatively and non-dissociatively on the catalyst sites [7]. Depending on the reaction conditions, the status of the rhodium species, and the properties of alkali promoters and supports, the rhodium species in catalysts is capable of catalyzing dissociation, insertion, and hydrogenation of CO [8,9]. The high cost of Rh and its low reactivity towards the formation of higher alcohols hinder its commercial utilization. Suitable supports and promoters enhance the reactivity of Rh towards the higher alcohol synthesis reaction [10,11]. Luo et al. [12] and Ojeda et al. [13] concluded that Rh-based catalysts favor high selectivity towards C2-oxygenates. Sudhakar et al. [14] reported that the CO hydrogenation rate and the formation of oxygenates increased by incorporating molybdenum in Rh/Al2O3. Li et al. [15] reported that rhodium incorporation into the Mo-K/Al2O3 catalysts increased the selectivity to the formation of C2+ alcohols, due to the co-existence of cationic and metallic rhodium species stabilized by the interaction of rhodium with the molybdenum species. This may be due to the addition of rhodium to the alkali-promoted molybdenum-sulfided catalysts, which significantly modified the coordination status of the molybdenum atoms in the catalysts [16]. Matsumoto et al. [17] tested the effect of Rh addition on the Ir-Mo/SiO2 catalysts and found that incorporating Rh increases both the activity and the selectivity towards the formation of oxygenates. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have well-defined hollow interiors and display exceptionally high mechanical strength, thermal stability, and electrical conductivity [18,19]. Their unique characteristics, such as resistance to acidic or basic media, inert graphitic surface, appropriate pore-size distribution, and nano-sized channels make them a promising support for various catalytic applications [20,21]. Yin et al. [22] showed that the Ru catalyst supported on MWCNTs exhibits the highest conversion of NH3 for the generation of CO x -free H2 compared to those supported on various oxides and activated carbon. Tavasoli et al. [23] found that CO conversion and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis rate were higher on Co catalysts supported on MWCNTs than that supported on alumina as MWCNTs aided the uniform dispersion of Co metal clusters on the support. The 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K MWCNT-supported catalyst outperformed over the investigative range of Mo (10–20wt%) and K (3–9wt%) [24]. In the present study, a series of Rh (0, 1, 1.5, and 2wt%)-promoted alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts (15wt% Mo and 9wt% K) supported on MWCNTs were prepared by sequential pore volume impregnation. The prepared catalysts were characterized using different techniques in oxide and sulfide states. The effects of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on the catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis were studied. In order to study the interaction effects of Rh metal with alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts, a catalyst is prepared using 1.5wt% of Rh on MWCNT support."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of MWCNT-supported catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of MWCNT-supported catalysts 2.1.1 Rh promoted Mo-K/MWCNT MWCNT (purity>95%) obtained from M.K. Nano, Canada were used as supports for the preparation of the catalysts. Prior to impregnation, the supports were treated with 30% HNO3 reflux at 100°C overnight, washed with distilled water several times, and dried at 120°C for 6h. The oxide samples were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (Sigma–Aldrich), potassium carbonate (Aldrich), and rhodium chloride hydrate (Aldrich) as precursors for Mo, K, and Rh, respectively. At the first step, the supports were impregnated with an aqueous solution of K2CO3, followed by drying at 120°C for 2h, and stabilized in an argon flow of 50ml/min at 300°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 4h. It was further impregnated with aqueous solutions containing the required amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24 and RhCl3, followed by drying at 120°C for 2h and stabilized in an argon flow of 50ml/min at 450°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 12h. The sulfide samples were obtained by heat-treating the oxide precursors in a flow of 10mol% H2S in H2 gas at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min for 4h."
3,Rh/MWCNT,2.2 Rh/MWCNT The MWCNT support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of RhCl3. It was dried at 120°C for 2h and stabilized in an argon flow of 50ml/min at 450°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 12h.
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The contents of Mo and Rh of the oxide catalysts were determined using a Perkin-Elmer ELAN 5000 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) instrument. The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of oxide samples were measured by N2-physisorption at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Approximately 0.2g of sample was used for each analysis. The moisture and other adsorbed gases present in the sample were removed before analysis by degassing the sample at 200°C for 2h under 66.7Pa (500mmHg). The sample was then evacuated at 2.67Pa (20μmHg) before N2 adsorption. A Perkin-Elmer thermogravimetric (TG) differential thermal analyzer (DTA) was used to measure weight changes of the sample when heated under a flow of argon (flow rate of 40ml/min) at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis patterns of oxide and sulfide forms of samples were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffraction instrument with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1541nm). Each sample was scanned at a rate of 0.05°/s, with 2θ varying from 10° to 80°. In order to obtain the XRD patterns in sulfided form, the catalysts were first sulfided for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min, using a gaseous mixture containing 10mol% H2S in H2 at a flow rate of 50ml/min. After sulfidation, the catalysts were cooled to room temperature in a flow of He and the sample was transferred to sample holders under protection of He. The morphology of the oxide samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM investigations were carried out using a Philips CM20 (100kV) transmission electron microscope equipped with a NARON energy-dispersive spectrometer with a germanium detector. The inner diameters, wall thicknesses, and length of carbon nanotubes, as well as the sizes of the catalyst particles, were measured by digital micrograph software (version 3.6.5, Gatan Inc.). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the catalysts were performed to study the reducibility of the metal oxides in the catalysts. For each analysis, approximately 0.2g of sample was used, which was first purged in a flow of argon at 170°C to remove traces of water and then cooled to 40°C. The TPR of each sample was performed using a 3.1% H2 in He stream at a flow rate of 30ml/min at atmospheric pressure, using a CHEMBET 3000 TPD-TPR analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, heating at a linearly programmed rate of 10°C/min up to 800°C. Carbon monoxide is used as a probe molecule in order to determine the number of accessible surface metal atoms present on sulfided catalysts. The CO uptake (μmol/gofcat.) measured from CO chemisorption is equivalent to the number of active metal atoms that are accessible to the reactant molecules. Metal dispersion is defined as the ratio of CO uptake to the theoretical number of Rh and Mo metal atoms ((μmol/gofcat.) present in the sample. The stoichiometric coefficient (CO to metal ratio) of 1 was used and the extent of reduction was assumed to be 100% in metal dispersion calculations. The carbon monoxide uptake on the sulfided catalysts was measured using the Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. Prior to the CO chemisorption measurement, 0.2g of sample was sulfided in situ using 10mol% H2S in H2 at 400°C for 4h. The sample was then evacuated at 120°C until the static pressure remained less than 6.6×10−4 Pa. Chemisorption was performed by passing pulses of CO over the sample to measure the total gas uptake at 35°C. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO is an efficient tool to monitor the changes of Mo-related active species, due to Rh addition. The sulfided catalysts were subjected to DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed CO in a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum GX instrument equipped with a DTGS detector and a KBr beam splitter. Approximately 10mg of powdered oxide sample was placed in the sample cup inside a Spectrotech diffuse reflectance in situ cell, equipped with ZnSe windows and a thermocouple, allowing direct measurement of the sample surface temperature. Spectra for each experiment were averaged over 64 scans in the region 3000–1000cm−1 with a nominal 4cm−1 resolution. Prior to CO adsorption, the catalyst was sulfided using 10mol% H2S in H2 (50ml/min) at 375°C for 4h. After sulfidation, the flow was switched to He (50ml/min) and the temperature was decreased to 30°C, and a background spectrum was recorded. CO adsorption was carried out at 30°C by introducing pure CO (30ml/min) into the sample cell for 30min. After adsorption, the system was purged with He (50ml/min) for 30min to remove the physisorbed CO molecules, and the spectra were collected under He flow."
5,Catalytic studies,"2.4 Catalytic studies A single-pass tubular downflow fixed-bed reactor of 450-mm length and 22-mm inside diameter made of inconel tube, was used to perform higher alcohol synthesis reactions (HAS). The reactor was packed with 2g of catalyst diluted with 12ml of 90 mesh size silicon carbide and housed in an electric furnace controlled by a temperature controller. The reactor was pressurized to 3.44MPa (500psig) with He. The Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts with or without Rh promoters were sulfided and reduced in situ for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min, using a gas mixture containing 10mol% H2S in H2 and flow rate of 50ml/min. The Rh/MWCNT catalyst was reduced with pure H2 for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min and flow rate of 50ml/min. The temperature was then lowered to the reaction temperature and the system was pressurized to the reaction conditions. The feed gas mixture CO (45mol%), H2 (45mol%), and Ar (10mol%) was passed through mass flow controllers. The HAS reaction was carried out at steady-state under the reaction conditions of 300–340°C, 5.51 (800psig) to 9.65MPa (1400psig), and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kgofcatalyst) over a period of 24h. The product gas was cooled to 0°C and separated into gas and liquid phases at the reaction pressure. The CO conversion and other gaseous products were monitored with a time interval of 1h. The liquid products were collected at the end of the reaction and analyzed with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The volume and weight of liquid products were measured to check the mass balance. The gaseous products were analyzed online on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph through a sampling valve. Using Ar as an internal standard, the CO conversion was calculated and the overall mass balance of the reaction was determined. The experiments were repeated at least twice to check reproducibility and to confirm that the results obtained were within the experimental error of ±2.5%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Elemental analysis and textural characteristics The elemental compositions of stabilized catalysts are given in Table 1 , along with the targeted compositions. These results indicate that most of the precursors are deposited on the support during the incipient wetness impregnation. The measured compositions are slightly below the corresponding targeted values, which may result from the hygroscopic nature of precursors. Table 1 shows the textural characteristics of all the stabilized catalysts. The surface area and pore volume of all the catalysts were much lower than the pure support. The BET surface area of the Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst was 96m2/g. When Rh loading on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo, 9wt% K catalyst was increased from 1 to 2wt%, a decrease in BET surface area from 80 to 69m2/g was observed, confirming that the pore blockage increased with Rh loadings. 3.1.2 Bulk phase identification The XRD patterns of the catalysts in oxidized and sulfided form were measured and are shown as Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. The most probable phases in the samples were detected using the JCPDS chemical spectra data bank. The results of the possible crystal phases for the oxidized and sulfided samples with their corresponding reflection planes are given in Table 2 . 3.1.2.1 Oxidized form The peak at 2θ value of 26.6° is due to the reflection of graphite phase of MWCNTs [25]. The characteristic reflections corresponding to the crystalline structure of MoO3 are observed at a 2θ value of 40.2° [26]. Several kinds of K-Mo-O mixed phases exist in oxidized form of catalysts. The peaks at 2θ values of 19.4°, 28.5°, 29.8°, and 30.9° correspond to the characteristic reflections of the K2Mo2O7 phase [27]. Other K-Mo-O phases, such as KMo4O6 (2θ =37.1°) and K2Mo7O20 (2θ =53.8°) also exist. For the Rh species, no peaks are detected from the XRD spectra of the catalysts in the oxide form, indicating good dispersion of those species on the catalyst. 3.1.2.2 Sulfided form The various diffraction peaks observed in the XRD patterns of oxide samples are completely removed after sulfidation, and the new diffraction peaks with less diffraction intensity representing different sulfide species appeared. This confirmed that newly formed active phases during the sulfidation step are well dispersed on the MWCNT supports. The reflections of MoS2 crystallites are observed at 2θ values of 14.6°, 33.4°, 40.9° and 58.9° [28]. The peaks at 2θ values 28.7° are due to the characteristic reflections of the K-Mo-S species, which represents KMo3S3 [29]. 3.1.3 Transmission electron microscopy The TEM images of 1.5wt% Rh-promoted Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts were recorded, and the representative image as shown in Fig. 3 was selected from several micrographs. No amorphous carbon or other impurities in and around the tubes are observed, claiming its advantage to be used as catalyst support. The walls are well structured, with thickness ranges from 3 to 8nm, indicating that MWCNTs are multi-walled in nature and the length of the tubes are between 200 and 400nm. Most of the nanotube caps are found to be open and the pore diameter ranges from 5 to 10nm. The metal particles are well dispersed inside and outside of the tube walls and the particle sizes are in the range of 3–4nm. 3.1.4 Reducibility studies Two main reduction peaks are observed in the TPR studies of the K-promoted Mo-based catalysts, the low temperature reduction peak appearing around 519°C and the high temperature peak around 787°C. The reduction of octahedral-coordinated Mo (Mo6+) species takes place at low temperatures, followed by the reduction of tetrahedral-coordinated Mo (Mo4+) species to a lower oxidation state [30]. The TPR profiles of the Rh-promoted Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts are represented in Fig. 4 . When 1wt% Rh was introduced on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalyst, the low temperature reduction peak significantly shifted from 519 to 392°C, whereas, the high temperature reduction peak shifted from 787 to 733°C. This explains that the reduction behavior of alkali-modified Mo catalysts was greatly improved by Rh promotion due to the possible interaction between Rh and Mo metal species [31]. A small peak was noted on the Rh-promoted catalyst at a lower temperature in the range of 150–225°C due to the reduction of rhodium species [15]. However, with increased Rh content from 1 to 2wt%, the low temperature reduction peak shifted from 392 to 408°C and the peak intensity was increased due to increased H2 consumption. It can be interfered from the results that the dispersion of Rh and Mo metals species were improved at higher Rh content favoring the formation of smaller particles, resulted due to strong interaction between Rh and Mo. 3.1.5 CO chemisorption Table 1 gives the results of CO uptake (μmol/gofcat.), and % dispersion of metals measured from CO chemisorption of the sulfided catalysts. The CO uptake increased by 24.5% when the catalyst with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K supported on the MWCNT was promoted with 1wt% Rh. With the addition of Rh, the active sites on the support that adsorb CO were increased, which is indicated by large CO uptake. Hence it is expected that the Rh promotion enhanced the CO hydrogenation capability of the MWCNT-supported Mo-K catalysts. The metal dispersion increased from 35.2% to 41.8% when the Rh metal content on the Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst was increased from 1 to 2wt%, resulting in the formation of more active sites for higher alcohol synthesis reactions at higher Rh loadings. 3.1.6 DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed CO over sulfided catalysts The effect of wt% of Rh on the metal interactions between Rh and Mo over sulfided Mo-K/MWCNTs catalysts was studied using DRIFTS after CO adsorption (Fig. 5 ). The intensity of the peaks were observed to be weak on the catalyst with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K supported on the MWCNTs compared to those with Rh promoted catalysts. The sample promoted with 1wt% Rh on Mo-K/MWCNTs showed relatively weak bands in the range of 2195–2130cm−1, strong bands with maxima at 2110, 2095, and 2065cm−1, a band with maxima around 2045, 2025, and 2010cm−1, and a weak broad band at around 1980cm−1. The characteristic bands in the range of 2195–2130cm−1 are assigned to the adsorption of CO on Rh n+ sites, resulting from chloride precursors. Zafeiratos et al. [32] observed the formation of cationic Pt n+ sites in the range of 2184–2120cm−1 over the Pt-Mo catalyst supported on titania. The intensity of these bands increased with an increase in wt% of Rh. The CO adsorption bands of un-promoted partially reduced Mo5+ species are observed in the range of 2110–2065cm−1 on all the Rh-promoted catalysts [33]. The characteristic bands due to the linear adsorption of CO at Rh0 sites on the catalyst with 1wt% Rh were observed at around 2045, 2025, and 2010cm−1. The broad band at around 1980cm−1 on the catalyst with 1wt% Rh represents the formation of partially reduced Mo species. An increase in intensity of these peaks and a shift to lower wave numbers were observed on the catalyst with 1.5wt% Rh. These results combined with H2-TPR and CO chemisorption results indicates that a strong electronic interaction occurs between Rh and Mo, leading to the formation of a Rh-Mo mixed phase on the MWCNTs-supported catalyst with 15wt% Mo and 9wt%K, promoted with 1.5wt% Rh. The new peak at around 1845cm−1, due to bridging carbonyls strongly perturbed by potassium, was observed on the catalyst with 2wt% Rh [34]. These bands may correspond to the formation of isolated sites and are not very coverage dependent [35]."
8,Catalytic studies,"3.2 Catalytic studies The catalyst activity studies towards higher alcohol synthesis reaction were carried out under similar conditions at 320°C, 8.27MPa (1200psig), 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kgofcatalyst), and H2 to CO molar ratio of 1. Fig. 6 gives the results of the % CO conversion as time on stream during the higher alcohol synthesis reaction over MWCNT-supported catalysts with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K, promoted with varying loadings of Rh (0, 1, 1.5, and 2wt%). The Rh-promoted MoS2-K/MWCNT catalysts are quite stable after the first 9h of time on stream. The Rh/MWCNT exhibited the % CO conversion of 6.4% and the catalyst is quiet stable during the 24h reaction time. The catalytic activity and product selectivity data were calculated after an induction period of 15h. Table 3 gives the activity and selectivity of the catalysts towards higher alcohols synthesis reactions. CO conversion increased linearly as a function of Rh loading on MoS2-K/MWCNT, from 27% for the un-promoted catalyst to 45% for the catalyst having 2wt% Rh. The total alcohols STY of 0.131g/(gofcat./h) was observed on the 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalyst supported on MWCNTs. With the incorporation of 1wt% Rh, the total alcohols STY increases to 0.181g/(gofcat./h). This might be due to the synergic interaction of the rhodium with the molybdenum species that improves the formation of the catalytically active surfaces or sites [15]. The activity of the catalysts for the formation of alcohols reached a maximum value of 0.211g/(gofcat./h) on the catalyst with 1.5wt% and decreased to 0.205g/(gofcat./h), over the catalyst with 2wt% Rh content. The hydrocarbon formation rate increased monotonically from 0.316 to 0.354g/(gofcat.)/h and the percentage of CO2 produced varied from 31% to 37%, with an increase in Rh content from 1 to 2wt%. The methanol selectivity decreased monotonically from 12% to 4%, with an increase in Rh content from 0 to 2wt%. Of the Rh loadings investigated, the catalyst with 1.5wt% Rh on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K resulted in maximum selectivities of 30%, 16%, and 25% towards total alcohols, ethanol, and higher alcohols, respectively. Defining the structural property relationships by linking the results of characterization with catalytic testing, Rh promotion facilitates the interaction between Rh- and K-modified Mo species after sulfidation and reduction, leading to a decrease in the size of the molybdenum species by increasing the percentage dispersion of particles. As seen in Fig. 7 , the molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol increases linearly as a function of wt% of Rh. The following linear equations were simulated for (1) the % CO conversion and (2) the molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol as a function of wt% of Rh: (1) Y = 8.6229 X + 27.274 R 2 = 0.9994 (2) Y = 1.6286 X + 0.3929 R 2 = 0.9953 where, X is the wt% of Rh on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalysts after sulfidation, and Y is the molar ratio of C2+OH/C1OH. The individual distribution of alcohols over the 1.5wt% Rh-promoted Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst is depicted in Fig. 8 as an Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) plot. A large deviation from the ideal ASF distribution for methanol, which deviated lower and ethanol, which deviated higher, is observed. The chain growth probability is calculated to be 0.46, assuming a linear distribution of alcohols. This confirms that the addition of Rh promoters to alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts increases the reaction rate towards the formation of higher alcohols, with ethanol as a dominant product, by accelerating the CO insertion mechanism during the C1 to C2 homologation step [36]. Fig. 9 represents the molar percentage distribution of alcohols obtained over the 1.5wt% Rh-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst. The methanol and ethanol molar percentages of 18% and 53%, respectively, were observed for the Rh-promoted catalyst. Alcohols up to octanol, with some traces of nonanol and decanol, were obtained over this catalyst. This confirms that Rh not only promotes the activity and selectivity toward higher alcohols (particularly ethyl alcohol), but also propagates the chain growth mechanism leading to the formation of higher alcohols. The Rh/MWCNT catalyst showed very little activity compared to the Rh promoted MoS2-K/MWCNT. The liquid products consisted of ethanol as major alcohol together with methanol, n-propanol and traces of n-butanol. Other C2-oxygenates such as acetaldehyde and acetic acid are also observed in the liquid products obtained over this catalyst. The total alcohols and hydrocarbons space time yield of 0.011 and 0.027g/(gofcat.)/h was obtained with this catalyst. From these results, it can be concluded that the activity of promoted Rh-Mo-K catalysts supported on MWCNTs is due to the synergistic effect of Rh and Mo, leading to the formation of Rh-Mo mixed phase [31]. The Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst promoted with 1.5wt% Rh was used to study the temperature effects on higher alcohols synthesis in the range of 300–340°C. The reactions were performed under similar conditions at 8.27MPa (1200psig) and 33.6m3 (STP)/h/(kgofcatalyst), and results are given in Table 4 . The percentage CO conversion and hydrocarbon space time yield increased monotonically with increasing temperature. The total alcohol space time yield of 0.244g/(gofcat./h) was at 330°C maximum. When the temperature was raised beyond 330°C, the maximum yield of alcohol was not consistent with CO conversion due to the high selectivities to hydrocarbon production and the WGS reaction. The maximum total alcohol and higher alcohol selectivities of 33% and 29%, respectively were observed over the catalyst promoted with 1.5wt% Rh. With increasing temperature, the methanol selectivity decreased monotonically, and the molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol increased significantly, confirming the increased promotional ability of Rh towards selective formation of higher alcohols at higher temperatures [37]. To investigate pressure effects, reaction pressures were varied in the range of 5.52–9.65MPa (800–1400psig) over 1.5wt% Rh-promoted Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts at 320°C and 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kgofcatalyst). Table 5 shows that increasing the pressure results in a monotonic increase in CO conversion, total alcohol formation rate, hydrocarbon formation rate, and WGS reaction rate. Increasing the pressure also increases the selectivity of methanol, higher alcohols, and the molar ratio C2+OH/C1OH. The highest total alcohol space time yield of 0.226g/(gofcat.)/h was obtained at 9.65MPa. Table 6 compares the activities of sulfided 1.5wt% Rh promoted 15wt% Mo, 9wt% K (catalyst C) supported on MWCNT with those given in the literature. The catalyst with highest activity from each work was selected for comparison purpose. Ir modified Rh-Mo/SiO2 (catalyst A) was not sulfided prior to the reaction. This table indicates that the sulfided Rh-Mo-K catalysts supported on MWCNT perform much better compared to those in the literature."
9,Conclusions,"Highly dispersed MWCNT-supported MoS2 catalysts with Rh promoters were prepared from oxide precursors. XRD revealed that many kinds of K-Mo-O mixed phases exist in oxidized form of catalysts, whereas, sulfidation improved the dispersion of these active phases on the MWCNT supports. From the TEM images, it was found that metal species were uniformly distributed inside and outside of the tubes, with particle sizes in the range of 3–4nm. DRIFT spectroscopy of absorbed CO was used to study the nature of active species in the sulfided form of catalysts and a band at 1980cm−1. This indicated the formation of Rh-Mo-S phase, which was responsible for formation of higher alcohols. The catalyst with 1.5wt% Rh loading performed better among the Rh-promoted catalysts and showed the highest total alcohol yield of 0.211g/(gofcat./h), ethanol selectivity of 16%, and higher alcohols selectivity of 25% at 320°C and 8.27MPa. The molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol increased significantly with increases in both temperature and pressure from 300 to 340°C and 5.52 to 9.65MPa, respectively."
