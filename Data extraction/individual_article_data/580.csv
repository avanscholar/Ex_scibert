0,Introduction,"In recent years, hydrogen energy is taken for a clean and efficient energy [1,2], which can replace the fossil energy that causes bad influence on the resource and climate [3,4]. However, the novel energy storage systems require further exploration due to their intermittent characters of the solar illumination [5]. Although the photocatalysis becomes a good approach to obtain continuable hydrogen energy [6,7], the progress of designing efficient and stable materials remains a huge challenge [8,9]. To date, a lot of efficient photocatalysts are generally adopted in water splitting [10]. For example, nonporous FePS3 nanosheets were designed for producing hydrogen with a rate of 305.6 μmol h−1 g-1, maintaining structural stability after 56 h continuous reactions [11]. And then, partial iron substituted hierarchically hollow VOOH nanostructures were synthesized for electrocatalytic water splitting [12]. Furthermore, CdS and MnS were assembled into Z-scheme photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light, demonstrating an H2 evolution rate of 1595 μmol h−1 g−1 [13]. Also, photocatalytic water splitting was realized by uniform CdS nanorods coated with ultrathin NiOOH without adopting any hole sacrificial agents [14]. Currently, all-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have caused wide concern due to the superiorities of high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility [15,16] and relatively narrow band gap energy [17]. Interestingly, CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite quantum dots (QDs) [18] and CsPbBrCl2/g-C3N4 type II heterojunction [19] presented photocatalytic properties for degradation of organic waste water under light illumination. Afterwards, cobalt doped CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs [20], CsPbBr3 QDs/UiO-66(NH2) [21] and CsPbBr3/MXene nanosheets [22] were also prepared for CO2 reduction, which indicated efficient photocatalytic activity in the nonaqueous media due to the inherent instability [23]. What’s more, the researchers found that CsPbBr3-xIx loaded with Pt [24], CsPbBr3 QDs protected by surface ligands [15], CsPbBr3 QDs encapsulated by graphite sheet [5], organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites optimized by silicon [25] and MAPbBr1-xIx/Pt powder [26] can be applied to the hydrogen evolution in water splitting. Based on the above research, we can learn that CsPbX3 perovskite NCs possess photocatalytic performance. However, we find that these materials are not stable and there is little study on their direct applications in water splitting. It’s worth noting that, study has shown that zinc ions doping can indeed affect the properties of perovskite [27], such as reducing non-radiative recombination, improving the defects, crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), adjusting the band gap and band edge positions, also enhancing chemical stability, efficient charge transport, light-harvesting ability, photocurrent, carrier lifetime [28–33] and photocatalytic activity [34]. At the same time, many strategies such as modifications of ligands [35,36], encapsulation in polymers to prepare films [37–40], protection media of silica [41–46], TiO2 [47] and glass matrix [48–50] have also been adopted to improve the stability of CsPbX3 perovskite NCs. Inorganic oxide glass is a new and effective method to protect the CsPbX3 perovskite NCs, while organic materials are easily depleted by natural weathering and the mesoporous materials are also not stabilized for a long time. Therefore, CsPbX3 perovskite NCs can exhibit tremendous advantages with the protection of glass. But less study corresponding to photocatalysis has been made by using CsPbX3 perovskite NCs glass powder. Herein, we have successfully adopted a strategy of in situ crystallization in borosilicate glass and obtained divalent metal Zn2+ ions doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite NCs glass. Additionally, the designed glass was ground into powder to explore the performance in optics and photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. Compared with CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite NCs glass powder, proper Zn2+ ions doping increased the luminous intensity, regulated the potential and improved the electron transfer efficiency. With the aid of robust inorganic glass matrix, powder with superior water stability and cycle usability was used to drive water splitting reactions for 100 h, showing the hydrogen production rate was 485.67 μmol g−1 occurred at 60 h. It can be revealed that the powder of Zn2+ ions doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite NCs glass owns prominent performance and promising potential in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,"Fabrication of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) perovskite NCs glass and powder","2.1 Fabrication of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) perovskite NCs glass and powder CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, where x is the ratio of the number of moles of Zn2+ to the total moles of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, x values refer to the synthesis conditions) perovskite NCs glass samples were designed by means of melting-quenching and in situ crystallization. In this work, the glass matrix was designed with molar compositions of 45.8 % SiO2 -43.2 % B2O3 -11 % MgO, and the embedded perovskite related components were Cs2CO3 -PbCl2- PbBr2- NaCl- NaBr- ZnBr2 and the theoretical concentration of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ was 5.4 % molar. The raw materials were accurate weighed and well mixed, and melted in alumina crucible at 1200 ℃ for 15 min. Then, the melt was poured into a preheated mold to form a glass block, annealed it in a muffle furnace at 420 ℃ to release internal stress and obtained the precursor glass. Afterwards, the precursor glass was cut into slices, the perovskite NCs glass was designed through heating treatment in muffle at 500 ℃ for 10 h. And then the prepared specimens were ground into powder by mortar for 5 min and the ball grinder for 11 h, respectively."
3,Characterizations of photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of photocatalysts Crystalline structure of obtained CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) perovskite NCs glass powder was analyzed by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipped with Cu Ka radiation at emission current of 40 mA and accelerating voltage of 40 mV for 2θ between 10° and 50°. Microstructural observation of perovskite NCs glass powder was determined by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and EDS elements mapping images were evaluated to illustrate the morphology and elemental analysis of the samples. Photoluminescence was montored by a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluromax-4 P Spectrofluorometer and UV–vis absorption spectra were carried out by using UV–vis Spectrometer of PerkinElmer Lambda 750. Time-resolved PL decay spectrum was measured by a spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh, FLS920). XPS spectra were observed by an Axi DLD spectrometer with a monochromator and excitation source of Al Kα. The positions of valence band were also derived from the valency band of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experiment of hydrogen production was performed by a gas chromatography-linked photocatalytic hydrogen production system. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas sorptometry was carried out by the Physical Adsorption Apparatus (ASAP2020)."
4,Photocatalysis experiments and analysis,"2.3 Photocatalysis experiments and analysis The photocatalytic experiment was performed in a cylindrical glass reactor equipped with cooling bath, and the reaction was performed by gas-circulating closed system. A photocatalyst (0.5 g) was added into ultrapure water (45 mL) with the presence of sacrificial agent (NaS2 0.7 g + Na2SO3 6.4 g). Prior to photocatalytic run, residual gas in the system was degassed by evacuation to ensure vacuum environment, and the 300 W xenon lamp acted as the source of radiation to illuminate the photocatalyst. In order to disperse photocatalyst and rapidly remove the gas produced from the photocatalyst, stirring with a magnet rotator at 500 rpm during reaction was essential. The hydrogen produced in reactor was analyzed by a gas chromatograph directly connected to the reaction system, which can directly detect the yield of hydrogen production. All the measurements of photocatalytic hydrogen production were operated at room temperature and ambient environment."
5,Electrochemistry measurement,"2.4 Electrochemistry measurement Standard three-electrode cell was adopted to explore the electrochemical properties of the photocatalyst. CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 and CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: 0.25 Zn2+ perovskite NCs glass powder was served as the working electrodes: 10 mg of photocatalyst powder was ground into slurry-like material with the aid of 20 μl polytetrafluoroethylene in a small agate mortar and the mixture was dispersed into 1 mL ethyl alcohol. Furthermore, the slurry was spread uniformly on the nickel foam, and the prepared electrode was heated in the oven to remove the ethyl alcohol. Platinum wire was used for the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode. The image of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was operated on a voltage of 0.4 V at a frequency ranging from 100 KHz to 0.01 KHz at room temperature. The electrochemical measurement was performed at neutral environment of 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4. Mott-Schottky plots were carried on a electrochemical workstation to record the flat band potentials (Efb)."
6,Results and discussion,"As shown in Fig. 1 (a) upper image, the glass network is composed of bridging oxygen bonds and non-bridging oxygen bonds, Na+, Cs+, Pb2+, Cl−, Br− and Zn2+ ions of precursor glass are relatively dispersed in the Si-O tetrahedral network structure. The first case, perovskite NCs will be precipitated in the gap of bridging oxygen bands after heat treatment, and Na2O is existed in the glass matrix. Also, perovskite NCs are well protected with the help of glass. As we all know, Na2O is identified as the network destructor oxide, implying that the effect of Na2O is to form break points in the network. The second case is presented in the lower image of Fig. 1(a), Si–O bonds are strong, can capture the oxygen of Na2O to formulate free oxygen, and Si-O bridging oxygen bonds will break into more non-bridging oxygen bonds and produce narrow glass passageways. And then more perovskite NCs will be precipitated in the gap of non-bridging oxygen bonds, and electrons and holes can be transferred through the narrow glass channels to drive photocatalysis. Therefore, perovskite NCs coexist in the gap of both bridging oxygen bonds and non-bridging oxygen bonds, showing an equilibrium state between being protected by bridging oxygen bonds and being released by non-bridging oxygen bonds. What’s more, the free Na+ ions called ionic conductors [51] carry positive charge in the matrix, which can carry the electrons produced from perovskite NCs for rapid transfer, sequentially, the electrons and holes separation of perovskite NCs will be further promoted. Furthermore, the perovskite NCs glass is ground into powder for achieving the breakdown of the glass network structure and exposing more activation sites. Also, sacrificial agent act as an electron donor to consume the valence band holes, allowing the rapid separation of electrons and holes. The schematic mechanism of H2 generation via water splitting is demonstrated in Fig. 1(b). Zn2+-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 is excited by photons with energy greater than or equal to band gap width (Eg) under illumination, photogenerated electrons migrate from the valence band to the conduction band, simultaneously, holes remain in the valence band [52]. Significantly, when the edge of the conduction band is more negative than the H+ to H2 reduction potential (EH+/H2 = 0 V) and the edge of the valence band is more positive than the H2O to O2 oxidation potential (EO2/H2O = 1.23 V), photo-generated electrons possess the capacity of H+ reduction and sacrificial agent (Na2S and Na2SO3) are combined with holes to oxidize O2− and then generate oxidative product [53]. What’s more, we find that the band gap width of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) perovskite NCs is larger than the thermodynamic requirement of 1.23 eV, which means the band gap width can span the redox potential of H2O. The compositions adjustment of glass and the components of perovskite-related resources are crucial factors to influence the crystallization of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.35) perovskite. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), a series of transparent Zn2+ ions doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite NCs glass samples were successfully prepared after heat treatment at 500 ℃ for 10 h. Afterwards, Fig. 2(b) showed the NCs glass powder ground by hand grinding method for further characterization and photocatalytic applications. XRD patterns detected in Fig. 2(c) exhibited the crystalline structure, distinguishable diffraction peaks between standard cards of PDF＃54-0752 (CsPbBr3) and PDF＃18-0366 (CsPbCl3), suggesting that CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) perovskite NCs were successfully crystallized and precipitated in the precursor glass, good crystallinity expressed fewer recombination sites to reduce charge recombination [54]. Fig S1 and Photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 2(d) signified the fluorescence intensity was markedly enhanced after Zn2+ ions doping compared with pure CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite NCs, the red shift of emission peaks with increasing Zn2+ content was due to lattice expansion [32]. Also when the doping amount was 0.25, the fluorescence intensity was the strongest. This was because the proper Zn2+ ions doping effectively suppressed the non-radiative process of PL [55]. Moreover, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in Fig. S2 was 5.11, 17.54, 14.22 and 10.55 for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5), respectively. Based on the phenomenon appeared in PL spectra, the microstructure of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25) NCs glass powder was investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Figs. 3 and S3, respectively. In Figs. 3(a) and S3(a), the NCs (dark) circled by red dotted lines were clearly discovered and evenly distributed in the glass matrix (bright) in TEM images with low distinguishability, indicating the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25) NCs were crystalline and integrated in glass matrix. The components and the molar content of the glass matrix remained consistent during the preparation process, the NCs were spherical because the glass matrix blocked the formation of its cubic phase. Lattice fringes were distinctly resolved in the HRTEM micrograph, and the fringe spacing was 0.281 nm for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: 0.25Zn2+ NCs in Fig. 3(b) and 0.235 nm for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs in Fig. S3(b), showing the interstitial sites of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs lattice were inserted by Zn2+ ions resulting in lattice expansion of the perovskite [28]. In addition, the network structure and preparation process of glass were complicated, it’s difficult for zinc ions to completely enter the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs lattice in glass. During the melting of glass, ions will migrate in all directions, except for the zinc ions entering the lattice, zinc ions will exist in the glass matrix to passivate the surface defects of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs resulting in decreasing non-radiative recombination probability, thereby increasing the photoluminescence quantum yield, charge carrier lifetime and carrier transportation. This conclusion was consistent with the previous reported [28,32]. All of the elements (Cs, Pb, Cl, Br, Zn) were displayed in the in Fig. 3(c–h) and S3(c–h), indicating that all of the elements were homogeneously distributed in the NCs. What’s more, we carried Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) measurements on CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass powder to investigate the morphological characteristics. It can be seen from Fig. S4(a) and the elemental analysis in Fig. S4(b–f) of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: 0.25Zn2+ NCs that the perovskite NCs were also widely distributed on the surface of glass powder. As shown in Table S1, we also analyzed the molar content of Cl, Br Pb, Cs, Zn elements from XPS results for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+(x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) NCs glass powder. In addition, characteristic signals for Cs 3d were discovered in Fig. S5(a), the peaks located at 738.6 eV, 724.65 eV were consistent with Cs 3d3/2, Cs 3d5/2. And the Pb 4f peaks in Fig. S5(b) can be fitted into Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f2/7 with the binding energy of 143.2 eV and 138.41 eV. In Fig. S5(c), the doublet signals at 200.1 eV and 198.1 eV were corresponding to Cl 2p1/2 and Cl 2p3/2, respectively. The binding energies of peaks of Br 3d3/2, Br 3d5/2 was individually at 69.3 eV, 68.2 eV in Fig. S5(d), respectively. Also, Fig S6 showed the signal of the Zn2+ of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: 0.25Zn2+. The Gibbs free energy of directly split water into hydrogen and oxygen is 237 KJ∙mol−1, meaning this progress isn’t thermodynamically spontaneous and is difficult to realize [56]. Fortunately, recent photocatalytic advancement based on the strategy of doping, surface chemical states and particle size has received wide attention [57]. And then, we focused for the first time on the effects of photocatalytic performance on perovskite NCs glass powder between hand grinding method and mechanical ball grinding method. Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) gas sorptometry was explored to measure the porous natures of glass powder. As presented in Fig. 4 (a), the results showed the specific surface area of photocatalyst prepared by hand grinding method was 1.31 m2 g−1. And the H2 evolution rate CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) NCs glass powder in Fig. 4(b) was 110.45 μmol g−1, 150 μmol g−1, 140.7 μmol g−1, and 70.62 μmol g−1, respectively. The optimal H2 production performance was occurred at the 0.25 doping amount. Then, we adopted mechanical ball grinding method to obtain uniform CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass powder, and the photocatalytic performance and cyclic stability of the powder were further investigated. Compared with hand grinding method, the specific surface area of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass optimized by ball grinding method for 11 h was increased to 2.53 m2 g−1 in Fig. 4(c), and the hydrogen production in Fig. 4(d) cycle 1 was increased to 290.67 μmol g−1 after 9 h, which was much higher than previously reported of 127.04 μmol g−1 [58]. After cycle 1, we didn’t employ any treatment for the samples and continuously drove the water splitting reactions for another 2 cycles. And the H2 evolution rate was 280.56 μmol g−1 and 275.56 μmol g−1 in Fig. 4(d) cycle 2 and 3, respectively. The results showing that NCs were effectively protected in the robust inorganic glass matrix, so that the hydrolytic reactions can be maintained for a long time. Sequentially, Fig. 5 (a) showed that the corresponding absorption edges of treated CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) NCs glass powder owned an obvious tendency of red shift from 480 nm to 500 nm with a change of 20 nm in the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, which was owing to lattice expansion. Despite great progress of photocatalyst has been made, many applications are hampered because of their wide band gap [59], whereas those with smaller band gaps can more effectively harvest solar energy [57]. And Fig. 5(c) demonstrated the result as a function of the photon energy acquired via the absorption coefficient curve, the Eg values were the intersection point between the tangent line and wavelength-axis of the fitting curve [57], showing the modulated Eg values of the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn2+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5) NCs glass powder were achieved from 2.5 eV to 2.42 eV with the concentration of Zn2+ ions, smaller band gaps with Zn2+ doping signified more effective solar energy capture [57], and the thermodynamic barrier of photocatalytic reactions was decreased. And based on the above photocatalytic performance, we took CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn (x = 0, 0.25) glass powder as key research object. The EVB were directly obtained by the intersection of the tangent and the x-coordinate at 0 eV or so based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), which were 2.2 eV for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs glass powder and 1.97 eV for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass powder, and ECB were calculated to be −0.3 and −0.5 by formula of E CB = E VB − E g , respectively. The results further demonstrated that CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs with 0.25Zn2+ doping glass powder owned more negative ECB than the H+ to H2 reduction potential (EH+/H2 = 0 V) and was more suitable for overall water splitting than pure CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs. Because zinc ions can passivate defects of perovskites NCs, the electron and hole mobilities were enhanced with the increasing addition of zinc ions [28]. Fig. 6 (a) more vividly showed the positions of band gap and band edges. It can be noticed that the bad gap, the positions of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) can be adjusted by proper Zn2+ ions doping, which was beneficial to better match the decomposition voltage of water. The decay curves exhibited in Fig. 6(b) were double-exponential in nature, and their fitting parameters were shown in Table 1 . Due to their non-single-exponential feature, the decay traces can be fitted by a biexponential Eq. (1). Accordingly, the average lifetime was calculated according to the Eqs. (2) and (3). (1) I ( τ ) = A 1 exp ( − t / t 1 ) + A 2 exp ( − t / t 2 ) (2) A 1 = t 1 t 1 + t 2 , A 2 = t 2 t 1 + t 2 (3) τ = A 1 t 1 2 + A 2 t 2 2 A 1 t 1 + A 2 t 2 The average lifetime (τ) was first increased from 58.9 ns to 74.26 ns with the concentration of Zn2+ from 0 to 0.25, the increased long-lifetime was due to the reduction of surface defects and decrease of photogenic carriers recombination. And τ then decreased to 58.46 ns and 48.09 ns with the concentration of Zn2+ from 0.35 to 0.5. However, with the increased concentration of Zn2+ ions, the increased trap states and the recombination of photogenic carriers in the bulk of the photocatalyst resulted in the short lifetime [6,31]. Therefore, increasing the lifetime can indeed induce the increased separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs [60], which was consistent with the above trend of photocatalytic hydrogen production. In Fig. 6(c), photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) was subsequently performed, in which the transfer resistance at the relative low-frequency range was gradually changed from 1000 Ω to 2010.2 Ω to 5100 Ω with the concentration of Zn2+ ions. Compared with CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ glass powder, it can be concluded that the proper Zn2+ ions doping will increase the photocurrent generation and can be beneficial to the increment of charge transfer efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the positive slope in the Mott-Schottky plot demonstrate the samples were n-type semiconductors. The carrier donor density (Nd) of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:xZn (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5) can be determined by equation N d = ( 2 ε r ε 0 e ) d C − 2 d V − 1 , and the corresponding Nd values were 0.17323 × 1011 cm−3, 0.3686 × 1011 cm−3 and 0.24646 × 1011 cm−3, respectively. According to the above results, the proper Zn2+ ions doping can significantly increase the carrier concentration [19]. It’s well known to all that CsPbX3 perovskite NCs are vulnerability to water, heat and light, therefore, various methods have been adopted to enhance the stability. Alternatively, inorganic glass is supposed to the robust host to protect the CsPbX3 NCs. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the stability of the pure CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs colloid and CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass was recorded in water. XRD pattern in Fig. 7(b) and PL spectrum in Fig. 7(c) further testified the successful preparation of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs colloid. In Fig. 7(a), the prepared CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs colloid was placed in water for 30 min and subsequently no luminescence occurred under UV-light. Comparatively, the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass still contained the original brightness in water for 3 days, indicating that the glass encapsulation could effectively prevent the direct contaction of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs with water. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7(d), no appreciable H2 production can be detected in the presence of the pure CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs colloid. Fortunately, the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5: 0.25Zn2+ NCs glass powder was used to continuously drive water splitting reactions for 100 h, the maximum hydrogen production was 485.67 μmol g−1 occurred at 60 h. Obviously, the water stability can be greatly enhanced due to the protection of inorganic host. We also compared the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen on the previous prepared catalysts and our work as presented in Table S2. It is worth mentioning that the perovskite NCs glass powder can be directly applied to hydrogen production, showing outstanding catalytic activity. And the hydrogen production capacity is expected to be further improved through composite structure and modification."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, divalent metal Zn2+ ions doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 NCs glass was successfully prepared by situ crystallization in borosilicate glass. The powder samples showed satisfied optical properties attribute to the exciton recombination radiation. Due to the proper Zn2+ ions doping, the absorption edges shifted from 480 nm to 500 nm and the values of band gap width can be modulated from 2.5 eV to 2.42 eV, which promoted the ability of light absorption and decreased the thermodynamic barrier of photocatalytic reactions. Compared with hand grinding method, ball grinding method can improve the specific surface area from 1.31m2 g−1 to 2.53 m2 g−1. When the doping amount of Zn2+ ions was 0.25 and the powder was prepared by ball grinding method for 11 h, the optimal H2 production performance can reach to 290.67 μmol g-1. Owing to the protection of the glass matrix, the powder with preferable water stability and cycle usability can continuously drive water splitting reactions, showing the maximum H2 evolution rate can up to 485.67 μmol g-1. It’s further anticipated that CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:0.25Zn2+ NCs glass powder will have a great potential in water splitting reactions, structure engineering (ions doped) and external decoration (mechanical ball grinding method) can be two effective tactics to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of water splitting."
