0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is already a fuel of choice because of its high energy content, which is a guarantee for future environmentally clean transport (Pachapur et al., 2015). Biohydrogen production via photo-fermentation stands out as it shows some crucial advantages, for example, high substrate conversion efficiency, simple operation, and widespread utilization of organic waste (Silva et al., 2017). Although lignocellulosic biomasses has been explored as suitable substrates for biohydrogen production, its rigid structure needs to be broken firstly by pretreatment before energy conversion step therefore could increase the overall cost (Sarma et al., 2017). Hence, exploration of cost-effective approaches become to be a key factor for bioenergy recovery from lignocellulosic biomasses in order to achieve sustainable production (Njakou and Blumberga, 2011). Up to now, a series of researches have enhanced the hydrogen yield by adding another waste steam to the substrate system (Kanchanasuta and Sillaparassamee, 2017; Yang and Wang, 2019; Zahedi et al., 2016), or adopting mixed culture (Abo-hashesh et al., 2011; Yilmazer et al., 2016), appending chemicals (Budiman and Wu, 2018), controlling process (Jiang et al., 2020a; Machado et al., 2018), optimal designing bioreactor (Kayahan et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2017). Among these strategies, established co-substrate system via mixing different substrate is outstanding due to its capacity to improve the nutrient balance and synchronously treat different waste streams in a single process (Júnnior and Lopes, 2017). Arundo donax L. (Giant reed) has recently been proposed as an energy crop for bioenergy production because of low costs for its cultivation, low environmental impacts, high biomass yield, and capacity to grow in a different kind of environment (Lemões et al., 2018). Plenty of carbohydrates of the Arundo donax L. can be a lucrative fermentable substrate for bioenergy production, which will be economically sound and sustainable (Ge et al., 2016). Glycerol generated during the transesterification of vegetable oil (Silva et al., 2017), algae lipids (Li et al., 2020a, 2020b) and animal fats (Jyoti et al., 2014) for biodiesel production is recognized as waste steam enclosed with a disposal cost (Fountoulakis and Manios, 2009). The characteristics of readily digestion (approximately 100%) (Heyndrickx et al., 1991), high energy content (19.0 MJ/kg for pure glycerol, 25.3 MJ/kg for crude glycerol) (Sarma et al., 2012), and minimized disposal cost for the biodiesel industry (Fountoulakis and Manios, 2009) make glycerol an ideal substrate or co-substrate for biofuel (such as biogas and biohydrogen) production. Therefore, several researches have inversgated the effects of glycerol as a sole substrate (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009) or co-substrate (Pike and Sojka, 1975) on photosynthetic hydrogen production. Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, the reports for the effects of glycerol addition on photo-fermentative hydrogen production with Arundo donax L. are limited. Furthermore, the medium redox potential (Eh), C/N ratio, and organic acid accumulation have close relationship with bacteria growth and hydrogen evolution during the photo-fermentation process, which are influenced by the specific components of the co-substrate system (Haron et al., 2018; Poladyan et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). Therefore, new insights into the correlation between photo-fermentative hydrogen production performance and these factors (initial features such as the medium redox potential (Eh), C/N ratio, solid/liquid ratio, and substrate mixing proportion and final features such as Eh, pH, ethanol, and organic acids) due to glycerol addition would help in understanding the efficient approach for hydrogen yield improvement. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of glycerol addition as a co-substrate on (1) hydrogen production, hydrogen production rate; (2) components changes of liquid medium during the photo-fermentation process with Arundo donax L. Furthermore, the correlation between hydrogen yield improvement and co-substrate utilization of glycerol and Arundo donax L. was also assessed by employing box plot analysis, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and Pearson’s correlation analysis."
1,Methods and materials,
2,Feedstock and bacteria,"2.1 Feedstock and bacteria Arundo donax L. was purchased from Sheqi, Nanyang, Henan, China. After air-dried, it was ground to through a 60-mesh sieve and then stored in room temperature without air before use. The contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin of Arundo donax L. were 33.7%, 30.1%, and 10.1%, respectively. Additionally, the contents of C, H, O, N, and S of Arundo donax L. were 41.4%, 5.7%, 46.8%, 0.85%, and 0.34%, respectively. The photosynthetic hydrogen production bacteria employed for the co-substrate utilization system was HAU-M1, provided by Henan Agricultural University, the detail of the bacteria can be found in our previous paper (Jiang et al., 2016b)."
3,Photo-fermentative hydrogen production,"2.2 Photo-fermentative hydrogen production Different grams of glycerol and Arundo donax L. were respectively added into a 200-mL reactor to achieve a total weight of 5 g. After that, about 1 g of HAU-M1 bacteria, 20 FPU/g solid of cellulase (Novozymes, Bagsværd, Denmark), and 150 mL hydrogen production medium (0.4 g/L of NH4Cl, 0.5 g/L of K2HPO4, 0.2 g/L of MgCl2, 0.1 g/L of yeast extract, 2 g/L of NaCl, and 3.5 g/ L of sodium glutamate) was added to the reactor to set up photo-fermentation. The concentrations of the glycerol in the loaded reactors were 0 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L, 20 g/L, and 30 g/L, respectively, corresponding to Arundo donax L./glycerol ratios of 1:0, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 0:1 (m/m), and corresponding to C/N ratios of 48.7, 32.9, 25.1, 17.2, and 1.4. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0. After sealing with a rubber stopper, the reactor was incubated in a 30 ± 1 °C incubator with a 2000 Lux illumination for 72 h. A 500-mL Tedlar gas bag (Hede Technology LTD., Dalian, China) was connected to the outlet for gas collection, and the volume and compound of the gas were determined every 12 h. All experiments were carried out three times."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis The cumulative hydrogen yields of co-substrate utilization systems were fitted according to a modified Gompertz model (Eq. (1)). This equation has been widely utilized to simulate gas production data (Dareioti et al., 2014). Hydrogen production rate (HPR) was calculated based on Eq. (2), which was obtained by obtaining the derivative of Eq. (1) (Li et al., 2018). (1) P H 2 t = P max e x p - e x p r m e P max λ - t + 1 (2) V H 2 t = d P H 2 ( t ) dt = r m e x p 2 + r m e P max λ - t - e x p r m e P max λ - t + 1 where P H 2 ( t ) is cumulative hydrogen yield, mL/g substrate; Pmax is the maximum potential of hydrogen yield, mL/g substrate; r m is the maximum hydrogen production rate, mL/g substrate/h; λ is lag time of photo-fermentation, h; t is photo-fermentative time; e is 2.718."
5,Analysis methods,"2.4 Analysis methods Totoal solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) of samples and pH of liquid medium were measured on basis of Standard Methods Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). The contents of C, H, N, and S were tested by using an elemental analyzer (Vario EL/cube, Germany), and the O content was calculated by subtracting the contents of C, H, S, and ash from 100 (Jiang et al., 2020b). The light intensity was measured with a digital illuminance meter (tes-1332, Taishi Electronic Industry Co., Ltd.). The volume of gas was tested by using a 60-mL sterile syringe, the hydrogen content and corresponding accumulative hydrogen production were determined by using a gas chromatograph (6820 gc-14b, Agilent Technology, USA) equipped with a 5A molecular sieve packed column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The flow rate of carrier gas (N2) was 45 mL/min. The detector, column oven, and injection port temperatures were respectively set at 150 °C, 80 °C, and 100 °C. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced during the photo-fermentation were measured by gas chromatography (Agilent, HP 7890B) equipped with a 30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm HP-5 ms Ultra Inert column, and a flame ionization detector (FID). The flow rate of carrier gas (N2) was 30 mL/min. The column oven temperature was initially set at 40 °C for 4 min and then maintained at 150 °C for 5 min after increasing by a rate of 10 °C/min. The detector and injector temperatures were respectively set at 300 °C and 40 °C. Total sugar yield was tested according to the dinitro salicylic (DNS) colorimetric method (Adney and Baker, 1996)."
6,Statistical analysis,2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical significance was carried out by analyzing variance (ANOVA) (α = 0.05) with softwares of Mintab 17 and OriginPro 9.1. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was carried out by using software of XLSTAT 2020.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Correlation between glycerol additions and hydrogen production,"3.1 Correlation between glycerol additions and hydrogen production The effect of glycerol additions on hydrogen yield and specific hydrogen production rate (HPR) is shown in Fig. 1 . The hydrogen yield of mono-substrate system of Arundo donax L. was 20.1 mL/g substrate, corresponding to Arundo donax L./glycerol ratio of 1, C/N ratio of 48.7, Eh of 16 mV and solid/liquid ratio of 0.03, respectively (Fig. 1a). The result of yield was lower than that reported by Zhang et al. (2020) due to its 2-fold high cellulase dosage leading to relative higher hydrogen yield from Arundo donax L.. However, when the co-substrate utilization system contained only glycerol, a 12.4 mL/g substrate of hydrogen yield was observed, contributing a C/N ratio of 1.4 to the system, which was too low for photosynthetic bacteria to generate hydrogen efficiently during photo-fermentation (Xia et al., 2014). Therefore, mixing glycerol with Arundo donax L. to establish a co-substrate utilization system would adjust the C/N ratio for efficient hydrogen production. After adding different grams of glycerol to substrate system of Arundo donax L., the hydrogen yields were essentially increased compared to mono-substrate systems of Arundo donax L. or glycerol (Fig. 1a). The maximum hydrogen yield of 79.2 mL/g substrate was observed when both the loading concentrations of glycerol and Arundo donax L. were 15 g/L (C/N ratio of 25.1), which was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced (up to 294%) in comparison with mono-substrate system of Arundo donax L. (Fig. 1a). The increment of hydrogen yield in this study was higher than the maximum increment (109%) by glycerol addition in hydrogen production of food waste in literature (Silva et al., 2017). Also, hydrogen yields of glycerol additions of 20 g/L and 10 g/L were respectively 40.6%, and 64.5% that obtained in glycerol addition of 15 g/L (Fig. 1a). Hence, hydrogen yield via photo-fermentation can be enhanced by appropriate mix proportions of glycerol and Arundo donax L. (lower than 1:1 in this study), but further improved glycerol to Arundo donax L. ratio conversely reduced the hydrogen yield (Fig. 1a). The enhanced hydrogen production via co-substrate utilization of glycerol and Arundo donax L. might be attributed to the disposing of excess electrons derived from glycerol via photoreduction of CO2 by the co-substrate system leading to a higher energy conversion efficiency (Koku et al., 2002). Pike and Sojka (1975) also pointed out that another carbon source such as malate addition did promote the consumption of glycerol by the purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides since malate might act as a ‘latent’ source of CO2 . Another reason might be explained that the C/N ratio (25.1), initial Eh (57 mV), and solid/liquid ratio (1/68) due to 15 g/L glycerol addition were appropriate for efficient photo-fermentative hydrogen production, thereby, the highest hydrogen yield. Moreover, the lag phase of hydrogen production was delayed from 17.9 h to 37.6 h when the glycerol proportion was increased from 0% to 100%, which means glycerol addition cannot shorten the lag phase (Table 1 ). While different result was reported by Silva et al. (2017), in which glycerol addition reduced the lag phase of hydrogen production of food waste via dark-fermentation. The reason might be explained by the different microorganism present in the two fermentative configurations. Mixing glycerol with Arundo donax L. improved the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) compared to sole glycerol or Arundo donax L. during the photo-fermentation processes (Fig. 1b and Table 1). The maximum HPR of mono-substrate system of Arundo donax L. (0.79 mL/g substrate/h) was respectively 64.2%, 19.3%, and 65.8% of those obtained in glycerol additions of 10 g/L, 15 g/L, and 20 g/L (Fig. 1b and Table 1). And the maximum HPR of the mono-substrate system of glycerol was 0.28 mL/g substrate/h, which was lower than those of other additions (Fig. 1b). The result further indicated that co-substrate utilization of glycerol and Arundo donax L. did enhance the performance of photo-fermentative hydrogen production. Moreover, glycerol addition of 15 g/L achieved the highest HPR of 4.1 mL/g substrate/h at 30.6 h, while the peaking time of glycerol additions of 10 g/L and 20 g/L were 28.8 h and 41.7 h, respectively (Fig. 1b and Table 1). Further compared the maximum HPR obtained in this study to those obtained in other studies adding glycerol as a supplementary for hydrogen production. The maximum HPR (20.5 mL/h) in this study was higher than that (2.5 mL/h) of 5% glycerol addition in food waste (Silva et al., 2017), although it is lower than that (35.3 mL/h) of 1% glycerol addition in organic waste (Fountoulakis and Manios, 2009)."
9,Effect of glycerol additions on pH and medium redox potential (Eh),"3.2 Effect of glycerol additions on pH and medium redox potential (Eh) Fig. 2 shows the effect of glycerol additions on pH values and medium redox potential (Eh). Sugar contents of different glycerol additions during the photo-fermentation were not shown as the values were around 0. The pH values of different glycerol additions decreased to a range of 5.77–6.55 in 12 h, except for the glycerol addition of 30 g/L, which got a slight increase (up to 7.05) (Fig. 2a). After 12 h, the pH values of all the glycerol additions decreased to a range of 5.43–6.13 and then maintained stable until the termination of photo-fermentation (Fig. 2a). Similar results were also observed by our previous studies (Jiang et al., 2020b, 2016b). Additionally, the overall pH values of glycerol addition of 15 g/L were higher than glycerol additions of 10 g/L and 20 g/L, which was consistent with the results of hydrogen yields shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2a). That might because the lower hydrogen yield and imbalance of NADH2/NAD+ ratio were accompanied by the pH value drop in the course of fermentation (Kanchanasuta and Sillaparassamee, 2017). However, higher overall pH value was observed in glycerol addition of 30 g/L even though the hydrogen yield was the lowest among different mix proportions, which proved to us that glycerol can be utilized as an alternative pH-adjust matter for keeping the pH conditions during the photo-fermentation process (Kanchanasuta and Sillaparassamee, 2017). The medium redox potential (Eh) plays a key role in affecting the biological system and is related to reducing and oxidizing all kinds of compounds during the photo-fermentation process (Sargsyan et al., 2015). All glycerol addition systems were reduction state as the Eh were negative, which were required for bacterial anaerobic growth (Fig. 2b). Eh of all the glycerol addition systems gradually decreased to a range of −442 to −334 mV in 48 h, indicating enhancement of reduction condition for hydrogen generation (Fig. 2b). After that, Eh instead increased until the end of photo-fermentation, which might be due to the hydrogen upset in the systems. The results were similar to the reported study, in which Eh showed the similar trend of this study (Sargsyan et al., 2015). It was also found that the overall Eh level after 12 h had a negative correlation with glycerol concentration since glycerol possessed a high reduction state leading to a relatively low Eh during the photo-fermentation process (Heyndrickx et al., 1991). Therefore, although glycerol addition of 15 g/L achieved the maximum hydrogen yield, its Eh value retained at a middle level after 12 h as present in Fig. 2b."
10,Correlation between glycerol additions and soluble metabolite products,"3.3 Correlation between glycerol additions and soluble metabolite products Alcohols and organic acids (for instance, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) are accompanied by hydrogen generation during the photo-fermentation, which were also correlated with the fermentation performance (Im et al., 2019). And the effect of glycerol additions on main metabolites and box plot analysis of metabolites at termination are present in Fig. 3 . In cases of lower glycerol concentration studies (glycerol additions of 0 g/L and 10 g/L), the concentrations of main metabolites during photo-fermentation processes were almost under 10 mM, and addition of glycerol as co-substrate lead to higher propionic acid concentration during the photo-fermentation process and higher acetic acid concentration at the termination of the photo-fermentation process in comparison with no glycerol addition (Fig. 3a, b, and f). The reason for higher acetic acid observed might be due to the decomposition of glycerol to acetic acid ( C 3 H 8 O 3 + H 2 O → CH 3 C O O H + CO 2 + 3 H 2 ) with a higher hydrogen yield (Sarma et al., 2012). There was a dramatic increase in ethanol concentration in the system when the proportion of glycerol increased from 1/3 to 1(Fig. 3b and c). While the maximum ethanol concentration of 43.9 mM was obtained in the mono-substrate system of glycerol even though its hydrogen yield was the lowest, because pure glycerol is more reduced than cell material, and there was no oxidized compounded served as an electron acceptor to dispose of the excess electrons, leading to a lower cell growth rate and followed with lower hydrogen yield (Fig. 3e) (Koku et al., 2002; Pike and Sojka, 1975). In cases of higher glycerol concentration studies (glycerol additions of 15 g/L, 20 g/L and 30 g/L), it was found that higher glycerol concentration present in the system would result in higher propionic acid which was accompanied with decreased hydrogen generation (Fig. 3c–e). That might be due to that higher glycerol stimulated the metabolic way to the propionic formation as this reason was known as a hydrogen consumption process, thereby lower hydrogen yield was obtained (Sarma et al., 2017). The final concentrations of ethanol in the system of glycerol addition of 15 g/L was 34.6 mM, which corresponded to the highest hydrogen yield of 79.2 mL/g substrate, followed by glycerol additions of 20 g/L and 10 g/L whose ethanol concentration were 27.2 mM and 9.8 mM, respectively, which accompanied with hydrogen yields of 51.1 mL/g substrate and 32.1 mL/g substrate, respectively (Fig. 3). The results illustrated that the enhanced hydrogen yield might be attributed be the decomposition of glycerol to ethanol with additional hydrogen yield gain ( C 3 H 8 O 3 → C 2 H 6 O + CO 2 + H 2 ) (Sarma et al., 2012). The box plot analysis revealed that the distribution of ethanol concentration of different glycerol addition systems at the termination of photo-fermentation was dispersive, meaning a significant difference in ethanol concentration among different co-substrate utilization systems (Fig. 3f). Besides, it was also found that the ethanol concentration at the termination of photo-fermentation was proportional to hydrogen production in the co-substrate utilization systems (Fig. 3b–d, and f). However, the terminal concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid did not show a significant difference among different glycerol additions (Fig. 3f). These results further indicated that the enhanced hydrogen yield of co-substrate utilization might be due to the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen along the pathway of ethanol generation. As a consequence, both glycerol and Arundo donax L. additions of 15 g/L (mix proportion of 1:1) was considered to be the most suitable mix proportion for the co-substrate utilization system with a reasonable metabolic pathway stimulated by the collaboration of co-substrate and hydrogen production bacteria."
11,Correlation analysis,"3.4 Correlation analysis The relationship between hydrogen production (including yield, the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) and peaking time) and initial features (glycerol additions, C/N ratio, initial Eh, and solid/liquid ratio) and final features (pH, Eh, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol) of co-substrate utilization systems were evaluated by using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and is present in Fig. 4 . Under both initial and final situations, the peaking time had negative relationship with hydrogen yield and the maximum HPR, while the latter two factors had positive relationship, suggesting yield improvement was coincident with enhancement of the maximum HPR (Fig. 4). Initial Eh due to glycerol addition had strongest correlation with both hydrogen yield and the HPR, indicating it played a key role on yield improvement since its variations might cause considerably yield changes (Fig. 4a). Glycerol additions as well as C/N ratio and solid/liquid ratio acted as negative roles in hydrogen yield improvement, meaning immoderate addition of glycerol would result in unbefitting C/N ratio and solid/liquid ratio, thereby, declined hydrogen yield (Fig. 4a). This result was consistent with the conclusion in Section 3.1. For the final situation, all the objects positively correlated with hydrogen yield and the maximum HPR except for propionic acid since it was obtuse with the two vectors, indicating the propionic acid played a negative role in hydrogen yield and the maximum HPR (Fig. 4b). However, it was interesting to find that propionic acid was positively correlated with the peaking time of hydrogen production (Fig. 4b). Eh had the strongest reaction when hydrogen yield and the maximum HPR changed followed by ethanol as their projection distances to the two vectors were shorter than those of other objects (exclude propionic acid), which suggested that these two objects had close relationship with yield improvement derived from co-substrate utilization of glycerol and Arundo donax L. (Fig. 4b). Pearson’s correlation analysis was further carried out to check the relation between initial features (Arundo donax L./glycerol ratio, C/N ratio, initial Eh, and solid/liquid ratio) and final features (pH, Eh, ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) due to glycerol additions and is shown in Fig. 5 . Arundo donax L./glycerol ratio had the strongest correlation (correlation distances were 1) with final features due to their dominant position in co-substrate utilization system, which showed negative correlation with all final features except for final Eh (Fig. 5). This found was in complete agreement with the result of Section 3.2. In addition, it was interesting to find that the initial features of C/N ratio, Eh, and solid/liquid ratio due to glycerol addition had the weakest correlation with final acetic acid concentration since the correlation distances were the shortest compared to other final features, but had the strongest correlations with final Eh (Fig. 5). The reason for the weakest correlation might be due to the slightly different of final acetic acid concentrations under different glycerol additions. Moreover, similar correlation distance was observed between initial C/N ratio and solid/liquid ratio (Fig. 5). We claimed the comparative positions of these two features in co-substrate utilization system."
12,Conclusions,"Established co-substrate utilization system by mixing glycerol with Arundo donax L. can enhance the hydrogen production via photo-fermentation. The increase in the additions of glycerol from 0 g/L to 15 g/L lead to considerably higher hydrogen production, while further increasing to 30 g/L did not unceasingly improve hydrogen generation. The maximum hydrogen yield of 79.2 mL/g substrate was achieved from glycerol addition system of 15 g/L (glycerol: Arundo donax L. of 1:1). Initial and final medium redox potential (Eh) had the strongest relationship with hydrogen yield improvement based on CCA. Additionally, Arundo donax L./glycerol ratio played a key role during the photo-fermentation process according to the Pearson’s correlation analysis."
