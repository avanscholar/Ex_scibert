0,Introduction,"As a carbon-free and high-density energy carrier, hydrogen is one of the most promising candidates to solve the energy crisis and problems involving environmental pollution [1–3]. Hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting has recently attracted increasing attention due to its high efficiency and eco-friendliness [4–6]. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), one of the half reactions of electrochemical water splitting, requires efficient catalysts to accelerate the slow kinetics at the electrodes [7,8]. Platinum (Pt) and Pt-based materials have been widely recognized as state-of-art electrocatalysts for the HER [9–11]. However, the low abundance and high cost of Pt restrict its use in large-scale industrial applications [12–14]. Hence, exploitation of low-cost and earth-abundant HER catalysts is a key challenge for hydrogen production. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), one of the competitive replacements for Pt, has been widely explored due to its unique physical, optical, and electrical properties [15,16]. Great efforts have been focused on improving the catalytic performance of MoS2. To date, various strategies have been investigated to engineer nanostructured MoS2 catalysts, including nanoparticles [17,18], nanowires [19,20], nanotubes [21,22], and thin films [23–25], to create abundant active sites. Nevertheless, due to the limitation of the reaction rate on the basal plane, the performance of MoS2 catalysts for the HER is still unsatisfactory [26–28]. Recently, it has been found that core–shell nanostructures combining MoS2 with other transition-metal chalcogenides (Co9S8, Ni3S2, Pd16S7, and so on) can strengthen the electron transfer between two phases through nanointerfaces, and that the created nanointerfaces can also increase the number of exposed edge sites [29–37]. Core shell structures are considered an effective strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2-based materials [38–40]. However, due to their unsatisfactory electrocatalytic activity, the design of new core–shell systems, facile synthesis strategies, and an understanding of the influences of core–shell structures on electrocatalytic activity are necessary. Herein, we report a one-dimensional, space-confined, solid-phase strategy for the growth of Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell heterostructures by combining electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition methods. The Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell nanocrystals were synthesized in situ on carbon nanofibers (Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs) by an S vapor graphitization process. By changing the mass ratio of the Cu and Mo precursors, the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs displayed different MoS2 shell numbers. We experimentally determined the effects of the thickness of the MoS2 shell on its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic and alkaline solutions. When the mass ratio is 3:1, the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs show the fewest MoS2 shells, each with 1–2 layers, and exhibit the best HER performance among all the as-prepared samples. The Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs with 1–2 layer MoS2 shells exhibit excellent activity with overpotentials of 116 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 114 mV in 1 M KOH (10 mA cm−2). The nanointerfaces between the Cu9S5 and MoS2 phases can increase the surface area and enhance the electron density of the material, leading to the acceleration of hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper chloride (CuCl2, 98%), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%), and poly(vinyl alcohol) powder (PVA, 88% hydrolyzed, Mw = 88,000) were all purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Sublimed sulfur (99.5%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q) was used throughout all experiments. All reagents were used as received without any further purification."
3,Preparation of the Cu-Mo precursor PVA nanofiber membrane,"2.2 Preparation of the Cu-Mo precursor PVA nanofiber membrane In a typical procedure, 2 g of PVA powder were dissolved in 18 mL of ultrapure water and then vigorously stirred for 2 h at 80 °C to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then, 0.2 g of CuCl2 and 0.2 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were added to the PVA solution. After vigorously stirring for several hours, the resulting solution was transferred to a syringe with a needle diameter of 0.7 mm. The syringe was placed in an electrospinning machine, and the needle was connected to a high voltage of 18 kV. The metal roller was connected to a low voltage of 1 kV. The distance from the needle to the metal roller was 15 cm, and the flow rate of the PVA solution was 0.2 mL h−1 at ambient temperature. After 15 h, the as-obtained Cu-Mo precursor PVA nanofiber membrane was dried at 80 °C overnight to remove the residual moisture."
4,Preparation of the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs membrane,"2.3 Preparation of the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs membrane The Cu9S5@MoS2/CNF membrane was prepared in a home-built chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. The as-prepared Cu-Mo precursor PVA nanofiber membrane was placed in an alumina boat at the center of the heating furnace, and sulfur powder was placed in another alumina boat at the front of the gas flow. The precursor membrane was heated to 200 °C under an air atmosphere and held at temperature for 3 h. Then, the membrane was heated to 400 °C while the sulfur powder was concurrently heated to 250 °C and held at temperature for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. Subsequently, the membrane was heated to 900 °C, which was maintained for 3 h. All the heating rates were 5 °C min−1. After the heating process, the membrane was naturally cooled to room temperature. The Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs were obtained after graphitization. To investigate the influence of the thickness of MoS2 shells on electrocatalytic activity, different mass ratios (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) of CuCl2 and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were used in the synthesis process, and the obtained products were denoted as Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3, respectively. In addition, MoS2/CNFs and Cu9S5/CNFs were prepared as controls using the procedure with only CuCl2 or (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 prepared at different graphitization temperatures (800 °C, 900 °C, and 1000 °C) were synthesized in the same way, marked as Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-800, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-900, and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1000."
5,Materials characterizations,"2.4 Materials characterizations To investigate the morphologies and structures of the as-prepared samples, a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM HITACHI S-4800, Japan) was used with an acceleration voltage of 3 kV, and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100 plus, Japan) was used with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. STEM mapping and line-scan energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs were performed using a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, Tecnai G2 F30S-Twin, Philips-FEI) at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The crystal structures of the samples were determined using a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument with Cu-Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) in the scan range of 5–90°. The surface elemental compositions of the samples were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis supra) with an aluminum (mono) Kα source (1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were collected using a confocal Raman microscope with 532 nm laser excitation. The mass concentration of Cu and Mo in the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with an ICAP-7400 spectrometer. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out on a Bruker E580 spectrometer; the microwave frequency was kept in the range between 9.8591 and 9.8599 GHz (X-band), and the microwave power was maintained at ~20 mW."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical experiments were performed with a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode system at room temperature. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a graphite rod were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. After calcination, the as-prepared, self-supported electrospinning membranes were cut into appropriate rectangles and used directly as the working electrode. The electrochemical performance of all the as-prepared samples was measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH solutions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was executed at open circuit voltages from 10-2 Hz to 105 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained in the non-Faradaic regions, −0.1 V to 0.1 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and −1.0 V to −0.8 V in 1 M KOH solution. Long-term activity was analyzed via chronoamperometry measurements. All potentials were calculated relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation (ERHE = ESCE + 0.059pH + 0.244)."
7,Results and discussion,"In a typical synthesis procedure, the Cu and Mo precursors within the PVA nanofibers were first prepared by the electrospinning process. Then, Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell nanocrystals were formed in situ on electrospun carbon nanofibers (Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs) via the S vapor-assisted graphitization process illustrated in Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 shows the morphologies and structures of the obtained Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs. Fig. 2a indicates that large amounts of Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals grew uniformly on the CNFs, and the average size of the Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals was approximately 69 nm (Fig. S1). In addition, the randomly assembled CNFs show diameters in the range of 200–350 nm, resulting in three-dimensional (3D) porous structures. Compared to the nanoparticle and nanoplate morphologies of individual Cu9S5/CNFs (Fig. S2) and MoS2/CNFs (Fig. S3), the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs hybrid clearly exhibits a core–shell structure (Fig. 2b and c). As shown in the STEM-EDX mapping images in Fig. 2d–h, the elements C, Cu, Mo, and S are evenly distributed. Notably, Cu is mainly distributed inside the Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystal, while Mo and S are dispersed throughout the entire nanocrystal, indicating that Cu9S5 forms the cores and MoS2 forms the shells. As shown in Fig. 2i, the high-magnification TEM image displays a typical core–shell structure of Cu9S5@MoS2 grown on the CNFs, and the MoS2 shell exhibits a multilayer structure. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2j) clearly reveals two distinct phases of hexagonal Cu9S5 and layered MoS2. The Cu9S5 core shows visible lattice distances of 2.18 Å and 2.69 Å, corresponding to the (1016) and (1010) high-index planes of the hexagonal Cu9S5 phase, respectively. In addition, the MoS2 shells display an interplanar spacing of 6.35 Å, corresponding to the (002) plane of the layered MoS2 phase. The spacing of the layered MoS2 is slightly larger than that of bulk MoS2 (6.1 Å), which is attributed to the lattice strains induced by the epitaxial growth of the lattice-mismatched structure when the MoS2 shells are grown on the compressible Cu9S5 core [41,42]. The HRTEM results indicate that Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals exhibit a well-defined core–shell structure, which is consistent with the TEM and STEM results. Furthermore, the Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell nanostructure offers distinct nanointerfaces of Cu-S-Mo, which could strengthen the electron transfer between Cu and Mo atoms, thus leading to an increase in electrocatalytic activity [29,34]. As shown in Fig. 2k, the line-scan energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra of the Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystal also confirm the good distribution of Cu, Mo, and S. Mo and S both exist throughout the structure. Cu, however, mainly exists in the center area, suggesting that the Cu9S5 core is coated by the MoS2 shell. Notably, the Cu signal is relatively weak, while the Mo and S signals are strong, which could be attributed to the shielding effect of the MoS2 shell. In addition, the number of MoS2 shells in Cu9S5@MoS2 can be controlled by adjusting the mass ratios of the Cu and Mo precursors. Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 with different MoS2 shell numbers, in which the total mass of the precursors was 0.4 g, and the mass ratios of Cu to Mo were 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, respectively. Fig. 3a–c and Fig. S4 clearly show that the CNFs serve as substrates and nanoreactors for the confined growth of Cu9S5@MoS2 by annealing the precursor under Ar and S vapor atmospheres. In addition, with increasing Cu content, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 exhibit a smaller size and an increased number of Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals due to the promotion of nucleation sites. The number of MoS2 shell layers of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 ranges from 5 to 8 (5–8 L). Moreover, as the mass ratio of the Cu to Mo precursors increases, the MoS2 shell layer numbers of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 decrease to 2–5 L and 1–2 L, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3g–i and Fig. S5. The thickness of the MoS2 shell decreases accordingly. The loading amounts of metal Cu and Mo were determined by ICP-OES (Table S1), and the results correspond to the original mass ratio of Cu and Mo precursors. The crystallinity and phase structures of the as-prepared samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As presented in Fig. S6, the individual MoS2/CNFs exhibit only one small peak with 2θ at 14.4° and two broad peaks at approximately 25° and 50°, which can be ascribed to the (002) plane of the 2H MoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 37–1492) and graphite carbon. Fig. 4 a shows the XRD pattern of individual Cu9S5/CNFs and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs with different mass ratios of Cu and Mo precursors, which are accompanied by different numbers of MoS2 layers (5–8 L, 2–5 L, and 1–2 L). It can be clearly seen that the main diffraction peaks of Cu9S5/CNFs, located at 28.0°, 32.5°, 39.2°, 46.3°, and 54.8°, can be assigned to the (0015), (1010), (1016), (110), and (205) planes of the hexagonally structured Cu9S5 phase (JCPDS No.47–1748). Compared to individual Cu9S5/CNFs, the diffraction peaks of Cu9S5 in Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs shift to a higher 2θ degree, which is attributed to the compression of the Cu9S5 crystal lattice by the outer MoS2 shells, resulting in a decrease in the Cu9S5 crystal lattice constant [43]. Furthermore, with a greater number of MoS2 shells, the shift of the Cu9S5 diffraction peaks of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 (5–8 L) is larger than that of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 (1–2 L). In addition, the intensity of the Cu9S5 peaks increases, while the intensity of the MoS2 peaks decreases, with a decreasing number of MoS2 shells. The results demonstrate the structural evolution of the Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell heterostructure caused by adjusting the mass ratios of Cu and Mo precursors. To further investigate the surface chemical states of Cu, Mo, and S in Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out. Fig. S7 shows a survey XPS spectrum of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs, in which C, O, S, Cu, and Mo signals can be clearly observed. The Cu 2p high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 are shown in Fig. 4b. As control, the Cu 2p XPS of Cu9S5/CNFs, Mo 3d XPS spectra of MoS2/CNFs and S 2p XPS spectra of Cu9S5/CNFs and MoS2/CNFs were shown in Figs. S8–S11. When the number amount of MoS2 is 5–8 L, the Cu 2p spectrum of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 can be deconvoluted into two pairs of spin–orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites (indicated as Sat.). The two pairs of doublets at 933.5 and 932.4 eV and 954.3 and 952.3 eV can be attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of Cu2+ and [Cu0 + Cu1+], respectively [44,45]. For the Mo 3d spectrum shown in Fig. 4c, two distinct peaks located at 229.3 and 232.8 eV can be assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, corresponding to the oxidation state of Mo4+. In addition, the peaks with binding energies (BEs) at 226.6 and 235.7 eV are consistent with the S 2s and Mo6+ ions [46,47]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the high-resolution XPS spectra of S 2p can be deconvoluted into seven characteristic peaks. The peaks with BEs at 162.5 and 164.3 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of the Mo-S bonds in MoS2. The peaks located at 161.6 and 163.5 eV belong to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of the Cu-S bonds in Cu9S5, respectively. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of BEs located at 165.2 eV and 168.6 and 169.8 eV are attributed to S2- and SO4 2-, respectively [48,49]. Notably, compared with those of multilayer Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, the Cu 2p and S 2s peaks in the XPS spectra of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3, which possess fewer MoS2 shell layers, both shift towards lower BEs, and the Mo 3d shifts to higher BEs, suggesting a strong coupling interaction between Cu9S5 and MoS2 through their Cu-S-Mo nanointerfaces [43,50]. Therefore, the XRD and XPS results illustrate the interaction between two phases in the core–shell structures. Raman spectra were also obtained to investigate the chemical environment. As shown in Fig. 4e, two distinct Raman peaks at approximately 1340 and 1590 cm−1 correspond to the D band and G band [51], which are ascribed to the defects of carbon and graphitic carbon in the CNFs, respectively. Compared to the pure Cu9S5/CNFs and MoS2/CNFs in Fig. S12, the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs with different mass ratios display similar intensity ratios (ID/IG), as they have the same graphitization temperature and similar structures. Furthermore, three sharp peaks emerged in the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs. The Raman peaks located at 387.2 and 412.4 cm−1 are assigned to the E2g and A1g modes of MoS2 [38,52]. In addition, the presence of the Cu-S stretching vibration at 474.3 cm−1 strongly suggests the existence of Cu9S5 [53], indicating the successful synthesis of Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell heterostructures. The electrocatalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts for the HER was tested with a standard three-electrode system in both 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0) and 1 M KOH (pH = 14). Fig. 5 a shows the polarization curves of pure Cu9S5/CNFs, MoS2/CNFs, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs with different numbers of MoS2 shells in 0.5 M H2SO4. As control, as shown in Fig. S13, the CNFs exhibit poor HER and only obtained 4.2 and 4.3 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 400 mV in alkaline and acid condition, respectively, suggesting the weak HER activity. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, pure Cu9S5/CNFs and MoS2/CNFs need overpotentials of 294 mV and 307 mV, respectively. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 (1–2 L) exhibits excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2, owing to the synergistic effect between the Cu9S5 core and MoS2 shell. In addition, intercalating Cu9S5 into the layered MoS2 material could increase the interlayer coupling, which determines the efficiency of electron transfer between the MoS2 layers [54,55], thus increasing the electrocatalytic performance by lowering the potential barrier. However, with a greater number of MoS2 shells, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 display inferior HER activity. When the number of MoS2 shells increases to 2–5 L, the overpotential of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 increases to 235 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, in which the number of MoS2 shells is 5–8 L, shows an overpotential of 281 mV (10 mA cm−2). Previous studies have indicated that the electrocatalytic reaction mainly occurs on the outermost layer of the MoS2 film [39,56]. Thus, electrons have to transfer into the outermost layer from the glassy carbon electrode to drive the reaction. Furthermore, potential barriers exist in the interlayer gap of MoS2 [53,57]; hence, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, with more MoS2 shell layers, will consume more energy to overcome the barriers, resulting in poor HER activity. Because of the influence of H2 bubbles generated during the hydrogen evolution process, the LSV curves show many fluctuations. In addition, the developed materials exhibit a negative current at a potential of 0 V versus RHE, which is attributed to the background of carbon nanofibers and the electric double layer capacitance of the materials [34,58]. In addition, Fig. 5b shows that Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 also display larger Tafel slopes than Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3. To further understand the electrocatalytic kinetics during the HER process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S14, the Nyquist plots of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 have a smaller charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of 6.5 Ω as compared to those of Cu9S5/CNFs (9.5 Ω) and MoS2/CNFs (137.3 Ω), indicating fast electron transfer for enhancing the catalytic activity. In addition, with an increasing number of MoS2 shells, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1 exhibit larger Rct values of 12.8 Ω and 19.8 Ω, respectively. Moreover, the stability of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 was investigated using the chronoamperometry method at a constant overpotential of 110 mV. As shown in Fig. 5d, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 exhibits superior durability with only a small deterioration in current density after a continuous electrocatalysis process for 20 h. In addition, the HER activities of the as-prepared electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5e, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 displays outstanding alkline HER performance with an overpotential of 114 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is better than those of pure Cu9S5/CNFs (135 mV) and MoS2/CNFs (294 mV) because of the synergistic effect of the materials. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-2 and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1, meanwhile show inferior HER activities with overpotentials of 202 mV 220 mV, respectively. This is mainly caused by the “screening effect” of excess MoS2 shells, which form many potential barriers. The results of the Tafel slopes and EIS plots shown in Fig. 5f and g also suggest that Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 has the best HER performance; that is, HER performance is best when the number of MoS2 shells in Cu9S5@MoS2 is 1–2 L. As shown in Fig. 5h, the i-t test of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 in the alkaline medium demonstrates that it has superior durability. The typical serrated shape described in the stability test contributes to the accumulation and release of H2 bubbles. Figs. S15–17 display the SEM and TEM images of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 after the stability test in acidic and alkaline media (20 h). The morphologies of Cu9S5@MoS2 remain basically unaltered, with only a small amount of core–shell nanostructure aggregation and shedding. In addition, as shown in Fig. S18, the XRD pattern of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 after the 20 h i-t test in 0.5 M H2SO4 suggests that the crystallinity and phase structures of Cu9S5 and MoS2 remained intact. A long-term stability test of approximately 120 h is displayed in Figs. S19 and S20, where it can be seen that the current density of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 remained at approximately 53.7% and 54.5% in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. A comparison of the overpotentials at 20 mA cm−2 is shown in Fig. 5i. Among all the as-prepared electrocatalysts, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 exhibits the best HER activity in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 was estimated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was calculated by collecting the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the non-Faradaic region at different scan rates. Fig. S21 shows the LSV curves normalized by ECSA of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3, Cu9S5/CNFs and MoS2/CNFs in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 both exhibit the best HER current density of 0.16 and 0.14 mA cm−2 (ECSA) at overpotential of 200 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH solution, respectively, suggesting the best intrinsic HER activity of core shell structures. Moreover, to explore the effect of annealing temperature on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the material, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 was calcined at different temperatures of 800 °C, 900 °C, and 1000 °C. As shown in Fig. 6 , the general size of the Cu9S5@MoS2 nanostructure increased with increasing annealing temperature. Notably, some holes exist on the carbon nanofibers of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1000 due to the migration of Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals at high temperatures. The XRD patterns of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S22. The intensity of the diffraction peaks for Cu9S5@MoS2 increased with increasing annealing temperature, demonstrating that high temperatures would lead to an increased size and better crystallinity of Cu9S5@MoS2 crystals. In addition, the ratio of ID/IG decreased from 0.99 to 0.87 when the annealing temperature reached 1000 °C (Fig. S23), indicating a high degree of graphitization for Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1000. The HER performance of Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-800, Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-900, and Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-1000 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH solution are shown in Fig. 7 . Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-900 exhibits the best HER activity. The crystallinity and graphitization will lead to enhanced catalytic performance with increased annealing temperature. However, excessive temperature can result in the migration and aggregation of the Cu9S5@MoS2 nanocrystals, thus leading to poor catalytic performance. Thus, the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs should be calcined at the ideal temperature of 900 °C, and the Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-900 exhibits the best HER performance in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH solution. The excellent and stable HER performances of the self-supported Cu9S5@MoS2/CNF-3 electrocatalyst under both acidic and alkaline conditions are attributed to the following factors. First, the carbon nanofibers, acting as both reactors and hosts, can not only prevent the aggregation of Cu9S5@MoS2 but also serve as carriers to accelerate the transformation of electrons. The three-dimensional networks with porous structures of carbon nanofibers can increase electrolyte contact and benefit the release of hydrogen on catalyst surfaces. Second, the synergistic effects between the Cu9S5 core and the MoS2 shell in the Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell nanostructure play a crucial role in the HER process. The Cu9S5 encapsulated in the MoS2 shells could increase the number of catalytic active sites. Furthermore, the nanointerface between the Cu9S5 core and the MoS2 shell can influence the charge transformation between Cu and Mo through the S atoms, which can significantly promote HER activity. Third, the electron spin resonance (ESR, Fig. S24) spectrum for Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3 indicates that S vacancies exist in Cu9S5@MoS2, which contributes to Mo-S dangling bonding [59]. The nanointerface of Cu-S-Mo presents more edges and abundant S vacancies, leading to the enhancement of HER activity."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, we synthesized a Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell heterostructure through the combination of electrospinning technology and a chemical vapor deposition method via an in situ S vapor-assisted strategy. Compared to the general synthesis of MoS2-based core–shell heterostructures [60–63], the thickness of the MoS2 shells for the Cu9S5@MoS2 core–shell structure in this work can be adjusted by changing the mass ratio of the Cu and Mo precursors. The number of MoS2 shells can directly influence the HER activity. Cu9S5@MoS2/CNFs-3, with the fewest MoS2 layers, exhibits superior HER performance with overpotentials of 116 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 114 mV in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Such excellent activity is ascribed to the synergistic effects of Cu9S5 and MoS2 and the formation of a Cu-S-Mo nanointerface. However, an excessive number of MoS2 shells can result in a decrease in HER performance due to the high energy barriers of electron transferring to the outer layer. The nanointerfaces between the Cu9S5 and MoS2 phases can increase the surface area and enhance the electron density, leading to the acceleration of hydrogen evolution. This work provides a facile strategy to develop unique and controllable core–shell structures in one-dimensional nanostructures. This structure can be applied in water splitting, fuel cells, and other energy storage and conversion fields."
