0,Introduction,"Mixtures of water with short chain alcohols are widely used both in pure science and in chemical engineering applications as solvents in synthetic, separation, and biochemical processes, [1–4] and are of great relevance in a number of relatively distant fields from atmospheric chemistry [5] to anesthesia [6,7]. Small alcohols, consisting of a hydrophylic hydroxyl and an apolar hydrocarbon group, are the simplest examples of amphiphilic molecules and exhibit, although in a considerably weaker form, the characteristic behavior of conventional surfactants from bulk phase self-association [8–11] to surface adsorption [12–15]. Indeed, while their hydrophilic hydroxyl groups can easily replace the OH groups of the water molecules in their hydrogen bonding network, the alkyl chains give rise to hydrophobic hydration and to the occurrence of microheterogeneties [10,16,17] in such mixtures. In particular, it was shown that, in a certain composition range, aqueous mixtures of the smallest alcohols, i.e., methanol and ethanol, are characterized by a bi-percolating structure of the two components. [9,11] With increasing alkyl chain length, this microscopic separation gradually turns to partial miscibility and then to immiscibility with water [18]. Further, besides varying the alkyl chain length, changing the composition of the mixture can also bring an additional complexity in the properties of such mixtures. Thus, the peculiar balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions results in a non-linear behavior of several properties, such as the viscosity [19–24], surface tension, [25] excess volume [26–28], or ultrasonic attenuation coefficient [28,29] in the aqueous mixtures of small alcohols. The seek of a thorough understanding of these properties at the molecular level triggered a number of studies involving both a broad range of experimental methods, including infrared (IR) [16,30], Raman [31–33], dielectric relaxation [28,29], x-ray absorption [34] and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies [35], as well as x-ray [36–38] and neutron diffraction [8,9,11,39], and also computer simulation [10,17,40–51]. The above discussed structural peculiarities of alcohol-water mixtures are intimately related to their thermodynamic properties. Since some of these thermodynamic properties were considerably earlier accessible by experimental methods than structural features, they were the subject of a number of studies in the second half of the past century. In their pioneering work, Franks and Ives suggested that, at room temperature, the entropy dominates the energy-entropy balance and the overall deviation from the ideal behavior of these mixtures [52]. They interpreted the occurrence of the minimum in the enthalpy of mixing in water rich compositions, reported by Lama and Lu [26], in terms of a possible stereo-chemically sensitive effect [52]. Marongiu et al. found that the enthalpy of mixing of alcohol-water mixtures is strongly affected by the geometry and number of alkyl groups as well as by the position of the hydroxyl group [53].This conclusion was later supported by the work of Marcus, who analyzed the structure enhancement of water in water-rich binary mixtures involving a large number of solutes including alcohols [54]. Similarly to structural investigations, experimental data can be well complemented by computer simulation results also in the respect of thermodynamic changes. However, in spite of the plethora of computer simulation studies of the structural features of alcohol-water mixtures, the thermodynamic changes accompanying the mixing of these components have scarcely been addressed [49,50]. Here we present a systematic investigation of the dependence of such changes on the size and branching of the alkyl chain as well as on the composition of the system. For this purpose, we calculate the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, and entropy of mixing of alcohol and water for the eight smallest monovalent alcohols, namely methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, s-butanol, and t-butanol, in the entire composition range (or, in the case of isobutanol and s-butanol, in the composition range of their miscibility with water). The schematic structure of the eight alcohol molecules considered are shown in Fig. 1 . To make our conclusions independent from the particular potential models chosen, we have repeated the entire set of calculations three times, using two force fields for alcohols and three conventional potential models of water. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The applied methods and performed calculations are described in Section 2, while the obtained results are presented and discussed in detail in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, the main conclusions of this study are summarized."
1,Computational details,
2,Calculation of the changes of extensive thermodynamic quantities upon mixing,"2.1 Calculation of the changes of extensive thermodynamic quantities upon mixing The change of a general extensive quantity, denoted here by E, occurring upon mixing two neat liquid phases, E mix, can be calculated considering the following thermodynamic cycle [55] (see Fig. 2 ). First, the two neat liquids, denoted by I and II, are isochorically brought to the ideal gas state. This step is accompanied by –x I E I and –x II E II changes of our extensive quantity in the respective systems, where x I and x II are the mole fractions of the respective components. Then, the two neat systems are mixed in the ideal gas state. This step is accompanied by the ideal mixing term of the extensive quantity in question, E id. Finally, the ideal gas mixture is brought back isochorically to the liquid state, while the change of the extensive quantity is E I+II. Thus, E mix can be given as (1) E mix = E I + II - x I E I - x II E II + E id . If the extensive quantity in question is the potential energy (U), Helmholtz free energy (F), or entropy (S), the ideal term can be given as (2) U id = 0 , (3) F id = R T ( x I ln x I + x II ln x II ) , and (4) S id = - R ( x I ln x I + x II ln x II ) , respectively, where T is the temperature and R is the gas constant. Considering that the potential energy of the ideal gas is zero by definition, U I, U II, and U I+II are simply the energies of the respective liquid phases, and can thus be obtained from a single computer simulation each. The free energy terms F I, F II, and F I+II can be determined [56–59] by the method of thermodynamic integration (TI) [60,61], as detailed in the following sub-section. Finally, once the corresponding energy and free energy terms are known, the values of S I, S II, and S I+II can simply be obtained considering the basic thermodynamic relation (5) S = U - A T . In should finally be noted for completeness that the above thermodynamic cycle (Fig. 2) should, in principle, also contain the step in which the volume (V) of the ideal gas mixture is brought from that of the sum of the two neat systems to that of the mixture. This step still corresponds to no change of the energy (as it is done in the ideal gas state), but it is accompanied by the free energy change of RT[(x I V I + x II V II)/V I+II]. However, considering that the first and last steps of the cycle correspond to isochoric processes, and hence V I, V II, and V I+II are the molar volumes of the respective liquids, this free energy term (and, consequently, also the corresponding entropy term of –R[(x I V I + x II V II)/V I+II]) are several orders of magnitude smaller than F mix and S mix, respectively, and also considerably smaller than the typical numerical uncertainty of the computed values of these quantities, and are thus negligible."
3,Thermodynamic integration,"2.2 Thermodynamic integration In the method of thermodynamic integration [60,61], the free energy difference between states α and β is calculated as an integral along a fictitious path, described by the coupling parameter λ, that connects continuously the two states of interest as (6) Δ F = F β - F α = ∫ 0 1 ∂ F ( λ ) ∂ λ d λ in such a way that λ = 0 in state α, while λ = 1 in state β. Considering that (7) F = - k B T ln Q and (8) Q = ∫ exp ( - U / k B T ) d r N , where Q stands for the configurational part of the canonical partition function (configurational integral), k B is the Boltzmann constant, and r N denotes the 3N position coordinates of the N particles, the integrand of Eq. (6) can be rewritten as (9) ∂ F ( λ ) ∂ λ = - k B T Q ( λ ) ∂ Q ( λ ) ∂ λ = ∫ ∂ U ( λ ) ∂ λ exp ( - U ( λ ) / k B T ) d r N ∫ exp ( - U ( λ ) / k B T ) d r N = ∂ U ( λ ) ∂ λ λ , where the brackets <…>λ denote ensemble averaging at the given λ value. The evaluation of this ensemble average requires the definition of the continuous path connecting the states of interest, α and β. Conventionally, this path is chosen to be a fourth order polynomial for U(λ), i.e., (10) U ( λ ) = λ 4 U β + ( 1 - λ ) 4 U α , where the use of 4 in the exponent is dictated by the fact that, at least for systems of pairwise additive potential energy, where the leading term in the pair potential decays with r –12, smaller exponents would result in divergence of the integrand at the λ = 0 end of the integral [60]. If state α is chosen to be the ideal gas, Eq. (10) simplifies to U(λ) = λ4 U β and, hence, considering also Eq. (9), Eq. (6) can be rewritten as (11) Δ F = ∫ 0 1 ∂ U ( λ ) ∂ λ λ d λ = ∫ 0 1 4 λ 3 U β λ d λ . To evaluate the ensemble average in Eq. (11), <U β>λ, Monte Carlo simulation has to be performed at the given value of λ. However, the Boltzmann factor occurring in Eq. (9), evaluated in each simulation step, can be rewritten as (12) exp - U ( λ ) / k B T = exp - λ 4 U β / k B T = exp - U β / k B ( T / λ 4 ) = exp - U β / k B T ∗ , where T* = T/λ4. In other words, the simulation performed at the real temperature of interest, T, with the potential function U(λ) is equivalent with that performed at the virtual temperature, T*, using the full potential function U β [56]. In this approach, the ideal gas state is considered to be that of infinite kinetic energy (i.e., infinite temperature) rather than that of zero potential energy, and it is approached by the increase of T* up to infinity rather than the decrease of U to zero along the coupling parameter λ. Having this method in hand, the F I, F II, and F I+II free energy values, corresponding to the first and last steps of the thermodynamic cycle shown in Fig. 2, can simply be calculated by performing Monte Carlo simulations at several virtual temperatures (λ values), determining thus the integrand of Eq. (11). Here we have employed six virtual temperatures, corresponding to the λ values of 1, 0.953089, 0.769235, 0.5, 0.230765, and 0.046911, fitted a fourth order polynomial to the obtained 4λ3<U β>λ vs. λ data, and integrated the fitted polynomial analytically. The last five of the λ values used correspond to the 5-point Gaussian quadrature [62], while the λ value of 1, corresponding to the real temperature of interest, T, has been used to evaluate also U I, U II, and U I+II. The use of a 5-point quadrature is rationalized by the earlier claim of Resat and Mezei that using additional λ points would not lead to a considerable change of the calculated free energy value [63]. The calculated 4λ3<U β>λ vs. λ data points, along with the fourth order polynomials fitted to them, are shown in Fig. 3 for mixtures of water with methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol at selected compositions, as obtained with one of the potential model combinations considered."
4,Monte Carlo simulations,"2.3 Monte Carlo simulations To evaluate the integrand of Eq. (11), Monte Carlo simulations of the mixtures of water with methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, s-butanol, and t-butanol have been performed in the canonical (N,V,T) ensemble at the aforementioned six virtual temperatures corresponding to the real temperature of interest of 298 K. The cubic basic simulation box has contained 1000 molecules in every case; the length of its edge has always been set in accordance with the experimental density of the system simulated [19,20,23,24,64–66]. The edge length values used in the simulations are collected in Table 1 . Besides the neat systems, mixtures corresponding to the alcohol mole fraction (x alc) values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 (i.e., number of alcohol molecules of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 in the basic box) have been simulated for all alcohols considered, with the exception of isobutanol and s-butanol, which are immiscible with water in the x alc ranges of 0.023–0.548 and 0.051–0.524, respectively [18]. It should be noted that butanol is not miscible with water either between the x alc values of 0.019 and 0.488 [18], however, experimental density values are also available in this composition range, i.e., for metastable butanol-water mixtures [65]. In order to check the possible model dependence of the results and to avoid interpreting occurrent artifacts of a particular model, we have repeated all simulations using two different potentials for describing the alcohol molecules, namely the CHARMM [67] and the all-atom OPLS [68,69] force fields, the latter being complemented by the torsional terms proposed by Simond et al. [70] whenever needed. Further, the CHARMM simulations have been repeated with two water models, i.e., TIP3P [71] (supposed to be compatible with the CHARMM force field) and SPC/E [72]. In the simulations performed with the OPLS force field, the OPLS-compatible TIP4P water model [71] has been used. Thus, all simulations have been repeated with three potential model combinations, referred to here as CHARMM-TIP3P, CHARMM-SPC/E, and OPLS-TIP4P, respectively, which makes the total number of simulations performed in this study more than 1100. All potential models used are pairwise additive, i.e., the intermolecular term of the potential energy is calculated as the sum of the contributions of all molecule pairs, while the interaction energy of a molecule pair is the sum of the Lennard-Jones and charge-charge Coulomb contributions of all pairs of their interaction sites. In the simulations, all interactions have been truncated to zero beyond the group-based cut-off distance of 12.5 Å. The long range part of the electrostatic interaction has been accounted for by means of the reaction field correction method [73–75] under conducting boundary conditions. All three water models considered are rigid; further, the bond lengths and bond angles of the alcohol molecules have also been kept unchanged in the simulations. The intramolecular term of the potential energy has thus resulted from the torsional rotations of the alcohol molecules. It should be emphasized that while the OPLS force field aims at describing the intramolecular energies of the individual molecules by describing the underlying physical phenomenon, the intramolecular term of the CHARMM force field has no physical meaning itself, only its difference between two states is of physical relevance. However, this feature of the CHARMM model does not affect the free energy, energy, and entropy of mixing values to be calculated, as they correspond to the difference of the respective quantities in the neat systems and in the mixture (see Fig. 2). The simulations have been performed by the program MMC [76]. In each Monte Carlo step, either a randomly chosen molecule has been randomly translated and rotated by no more than 0.25 Å and 10°, respectively, or a randomly picked torsional angle of an alcohol molecule has been randomly altered. Alcohol molecules have been chosen both for displacement and torsional moves in a shuffled cyclic order [77]. Torsional rotations have been attempted according to the extension biased scheme [78]. Trial moves have been accepted with probabilities not smaller than 0.1 in every case. The simulations of each system have been done in the order of increasing virtual temperatures (i.e., decreasing λ). Simulations performed at the real temperature of interest of 298 K (i.e., at λ = 1) have been started from a random configuration of the molecules, and the final configuration resulted from each simulation has been used as the starting configuration of that at the next virtual temperature. Systems have been equilibrated at each virtual temperature in a 2 × 108 Monte Carlo steps long run. Then, in the production stage, the ensemble average of the potential energy, to be used in Eq. (11), has been evaluated over 5 × 108 equilibrium configurations. Equilibrium snapshots of the equimolar methanol–water mixture are shown in Fig. 4 as obtained with the CHARMM-SPC/E and OPLS-TIP4P model combinations."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Helmholtz free energy, energy, and entropy","3.1 Helmholtz free energy, energy, and entropy The intermolecular part of the Helmholtz free energy, energy and entropy of the various alcohol-water mixtures simulated (relative to their ideal gas state) are shown in Figs. 5–7 , respectively, as obtained with the three model combinations considered. It should be emphasized again that, in the CHARMM force field, the intramolecular term of the energy itself has no physical relevance, only its difference between two states bears a physical meaning. On the other hand, in the case of the OPLS force field, both the intramolecular and the intermolecular term are of real physical meaning, as they supposed to account for the respective energy terms. Thus, for completeness, in the case of the OPLS-TIP4P model combination, the full Helmholtz free energy, energy and entropy of the systems simulated as well as their intramolecular terms are shown in Fig. S1 of the supplementary material. As is seen from Fig. 5, the free energy of the mixtures typically increases with increasing x alc values, but with decreasing slope and, in the case of larger alcohols, it might even go through a maximum. In the case of the CHARMM-TIP3P model combination, this maximum occurs around the equimolar composition (for butanol and t-butanol), while with the other two model combinations it is located around the alcohol mole fraction range of 0.8–0.9 whenever it exists. The only exception in this respect is methanol, for which the F(x alc) data is almost linear with all model combinations considered. The observed composition dependence of the free energy is clearly dominated by that of the entropy. Indeed, while the composition dependence of the energy is usually rather close to linearity, especially for larger alcohols (see Fig. 6), the entropy exhibits a marked minimum as the function of the alcohol mole fraction in almost every case (Fig. 7). This finding indicates that the addition of either of the two components to the neat liquid of the other one or to mixtures having the other component in large excess results in a clear ordering of the system, reflected in the decrease of the entropy. In the case of adding alcohol to neat water or water-rich mixtures, this entropy decrease can be attributed to the increasing importance of hydrophobic hydration [79,80], i.e., the structural ordering of the water molecules at the vicinity of the apolar groups in order to maintain as many of their hydrogen bonds as possible [81]. On the other hand, the addition of water to neat alcohols or alcohol-rich mixtures increases the extent of hydrogen bonding of the alcohols, leading thus also to their ordering by providing additional H atoms to be accepted in hydrogen bonds. Similar behaviour was recently observed for the aqueous mixtures of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [82]. Consistently with this explanation, the alcohol-induced entropy decrease in water-rich mixtures is stronger for larger alcohols, having larger apolar groups, while the water-induced entropy decrease at large x alc values is stronger for smaller alcohols, in which the density of the polar groups, and hence that of the H-bonds is larger. It is also seen that the Helmholtz free energy, energy, and entropy values of the neat alcohols decrease, in general, with increasing size and, to a lesser extent, also with decreasing branching of the alcohol molecule with all model combinations considered. The experimental energy values of neat alcohols [83], obtained from the heat of vaporization (ΔH vap) data as U ≈ –ΔH vap + RT assuming that (i) the molar volume of the liquid phase is negligible with respect to that of the vapour, and (ii) the vapour phase behaves as an ideal gas, also support this finding. These values are compared with the data obtained from the simulations with the CHARMM and OPLS force fields in Table 2 . As is seen, among the two force fields, CHARMM performs clearly better in this respect than OPLS. Thus, while the CHARMM model can always reproduce the experimental value rather accurately (the mean and maximum deviation being about 3% and 4.5%, respectively), the OPLS results deviate noticeably more, i.e., by about 6.5%, on average, from the experimental data. This deviation is particularly strong in the cases of propanol and isobutanol, for which the OPLS model underestimates the magnitude of the internal energy by about 10% and 17%, respectively."
7,Thermodynamics of mixing,"3.2 Thermodynamics of mixing The Helmholtz free energy, energy and entropy of mixing obtained in the different systems simulated with the three model combinations considered are shown in Figs. 8–10 , respectively. Comparisons of these results with existing experimental data are shown in Figs. S2–S7 of the supplementary material. The model combinations considered can, in general, reasonably well reproduce the experimental data, the deviation being always below 1 kJ/mol, 0.7 kJ/mol, and 2.5 J/mol K for the free energy, energy and entropy of mixing, respectively. In this respect, the model combinations involving the CHARMM force field perform somewhat better, in general, than OPLS-TIP4P, and among the model combinations involving the CHARMM force field CHARMM-TIP3P is slightly better than CHARMM-SPC/E. It should be emphasized that here we are interested in the trends of how these thermodynamic functions change with the structure of the alkyl chain and the composition rather than their exact numerical values. In this respect, the results are satisfactory as all model combinations reproduce the experimental trends reasonably well. As is seen from Fig. 8, all model combinations result in negative free energy of mixing values for the methanol–water and ethanol–water mixtures, and the OPLS-TIP4P combination also for the propanol-water mixture in the entire composition range, while for the larger alcohols the F mix(x alc) curve exhibits a positive loop at low, and a negative loop at high x alc values. This means that, according to these models, larger alcohols exhibit only partial miscibility with water, and the miscibility gap occurs at low alcohol mole fractions. In this respect, the OPLS force field performs better than CHARMM, as it also reproduces the full miscibility of propanol with water, and for isopropanol, the calculated F mix(x alc) curve does not exceed zero beyond the numerical uncertainty of the calculations. Further, in the case of the model combinations that involve the CHARMM force field the one employing the TIP3P water model, supposed to be compatible with the CHARMM force field, performs slightly better than that using SPC/E, as it results in somewhat lower F mix values at fixed compositions, and the F mix(x alc) curves become negative at somewhat lower alcohol mole fractions than with the SPC/E water model. Although these results are still not in a full accordance with the experimental data (as propanol, isopropanol, and t-butanol are also fully miscible with water), they reproduce again the qualitative trends well. Namely, with increasing size and decreasing branching, alcohols become partially miscible with water, and the immiscibility region indeed occurs at water-rich compositions. In particular, butanol, isobutanol, and s-butanol are not miscible with water between the x ac values of 0.02–0.05 and about 0.5 [18]. Further, the thermodynamic driving force of the immiscibility of these models is very weak; the F mix values never exceed 0.5 kJ/mol for t-butanol and about 0.2 kJ/mol for propanol and isopropanol when using the CHARMM-TIP3P model combination, and for t-butanol they remain below 0.3 kJ/mol with the OPLS force field. For comparison, the average kinetic energy of the molecules along one single degree of freedom, RT/2, being 1.24 kJ/mol at this temperature, is almost an order of magnitude larger than these values, as seen from Fig. 8. As is also seen from Fig. 8, larger alcohols and, among the alcohols of the same size, more linear, less branching ones correspond to higher F mix values than smaller or more branching ones in the entire composition range, and this difference is more pronounced at low x alc values. To better demonstrate this behaviour, we have also plotted the ΔF mix values, calculated with both the CHARMM-TIP3P and the OPLS-TIP4P model combinations, as a function of x alc for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and t-butanol in Fig. 11 , where Δ F mix ( x alc ) = F mix alc ( x alc ) - F mix BuOH ( x alc ) , while F mix alc and F mix BuOH stand for the free energy of mixing values of the alcohol in question and of butanol, respectively. This finding can be rationalized by considering that the – both energetically and entropically – unfavourable contacts between the water molecules and the apolar groups of the alcohols increase both with increasing size of the apolar group, and, for apolar groups of the same size, also with their increasing surface area, this latter quantity being larger for less spherical, i.e., less branching groups. As is evident from Figs. 8 and 11, among these two factors the first one is more important, although the effect of the addition of a new CH2 group to the apolar tail on F mix clearly decreases with increasing length of the apolar chain. The effect of the increasing size and surface area of the apolar group on the thermodynamics of mixing can be further analyzed by considering the energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy of mixing. The energy of mixing data (Fig. 9) clearly show the opposite trend than F mix(x alc) in every case, suggesting that the observed behaviour is dominated by the change of the entropy. Although the energy of mixing is still negative for methanol and ethanol in the entire composition range with all model combinations considered, in contrast with F mix, the slope of its decrease is larger at low than at high x alc values. The importance of this difference, being more pronounced for ethanol than methanol, becomes apparent when considering larger alcohols. In these systems, the U mix(x alc) data exhibit a negative loop at low alcohol mole fractions, where F mix is positive, and a positive loop at large x alc values, where F mix becomes negative. Thus, in water-rich mixtures of larger alcohols, the energy loss attributed to the occurrence of water-apolar contacts is overcompensated by the stronger H-bonds formed by the unlike than the like molecule pairs [40,47] (although this effect depends also on the particular water model used), while in alcohol-rich mixtures the former factor dominates. The reason for this behaviour is twofold. First, in water-rich mixtures the hydrophobic groups are effectively expelled from the water molecules, making them form small self-aggregates, giving rise to a microheterogeneous structure [8–11], while in alcohol-rich mixtures the water molecules are inevitably surrounded by apolar groups. Second, the energy gain attributed to the formation of H-bonds by unlike rather than like molecule pairs comes from the fact that alcohol molecules gain more energy than water molecules lose upon this change. In other words, water-water H-bonds are, on average, stronger, while alcohol-alcohol H-bonds are weaker than those between an alcohol and a water molecule, and the latter difference is larger than the former one [47]. As a consequence, this energy gain is relatively stronger in water-rich than in alcohol-rich systems. The dependence of the entropy of mixing on the composition and the type of the alcohol considered (Fig. 10), on the other hand, exhibits the same trend as that of F mix. Thus, apart from methanol, S mix is negative in water-rich mixtures, and becomes positive for all alcohols considered at high x alc values. However, as is also evident, the entropy of mixing is always considerably smaller than the term corresponding to the ideal mixing. In other words, the entropy term corresponding to the interaction of the unlike molecules is always negative, and hence impedes the mixing of the two liquids. This entropy loss is attributed (i) to hydrophobic hydration, i.e., the orientational ordering of the water molecules around the apolar groups [79–81] (in water-rich systems), and (ii) to the ordering of the alcohols through the increase of the extent of their H-bonding by the presence of the water molecules, which can donate 2 rather than only 1 bonding H atoms (in alcohol-rich systems). Among these two factors, the first one (which also increases with the size of the apolar group) turns out to be more important, while the second one (which is largely independent from the size of the hydrophobic tail) can be overcompensated by the entropy term of the ideal mixing, i.e., by the trivial fact that unlike molecules prefer to be mixed with, rather than separated from each other. This difference, resulting in the observed negative-positive loop pattern of the S mix(x alc) data, is responsible for the characteristic positive–negative loop pattern of the free energy of mixing curves, where the first, positive loop is markedly size dependent and, ultimately, for the decreasing miscibility of the alcohols with water with their increasing size, in particular, at water-rich compositions."
8,Summary and conclusions,"In this paper, we have calculated the Helmholtz free energy, energy and entropy of mixing of small monovalent alcohols and water in the entire composition range by means of thermodynamic integration to systematically analyze the effect of the size and shape of the alkyl chain as well as of the composition on the thermodynamics of mixing. In order to draw conclusions that are independent from the particular model used, all calculations have been repeated with three different force field combinations. The obtained results are, in general, in a satisfactory agreement with existing experimental data, in particular, in the respect of the general trends, being in the focus of our interest here. Among the two force fields, CHARMM has turned out to be considerably better in reproducing the internal energy (or heat of evaporation) of neat alcohols (see Table 2), and also in reproducing experimental thermodynamics of mixing data (see Figs. S2–S7 of the supplementary material). Further, among the two water models considered in combination with the CHARMM force field, TIP3P performs slightly better in this respect than SPC/E. On the other hand, OPLS, unlike CHARMM, reproduces the full miscibility of propanol with water. However, this latter finding might well be the consequence of fortuitous cancellation of errors, as the experimental internal energy of propanol is reproduced by the OPLS model even worse, i.e., with a deviation of about 10%, than that of the majority of other alcohols. Our most important conclusion is that the thermodynamics of mixing of alcohols and water is primarily governed by the entropic term. Thus, the addition of either of the two components to the mixture containing the other component in a large excess results in a clear entropy decrease, although for different reasons at the two ends of the composition range. Thus, in water-rich systems, the addition of alcohols leads to the ordering of the water molecules through hydrophobic hydration [79,80] of the apolar tails. Consistently with this explanation, this entropy decrease is larger for alcohols bearing larger tails. Although the addition of alcohols at this end of the composition range also leads to a slight decrease of the energy, among these two opposite factors, the entropy decrease clearly dominates for larger alcohols. As a consequence, the decrease of the free energy of mixing with increasing alcohol mole fraction becomes smaller, and even turns to an increase with increasing size and, among alcohols of the same size, also with decreasing branching (i.e., increasing surface area) of the apolar group. As a consequence, larger and less branching alcohols are only partially miscible with water, with a miscibility gap occurring at water-rich compositions. In alcohol-rich mixtures, on the other hand, the addition of water induces an additional ordering of the alcohol molecules by providing additional H atoms to be accepted in hydrogen bonds, and therefore by increasing the number of H-bonds the alcohol molecules are involved in. This ordering is largely independent from the apolar group, and it is small enough to be overcompensated by the entropy term of ideal mixing. As a consequence, the entropy of mixing is positive at the alcohol-rich end of the composition range. Further, this entropic gain is larger than the energy loss due to the occurrence of water-apolar contacts in such systems. As a consequence, the free energy of mixing in alcohol-rich mixtures is negative, and it exhibits a considerably weaker dependence on the apolar group here than in water-rich mixtures."
