0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as an important raw material, is widely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and bulk chemicals such as methanol and ammonia. Furthermore, it is considered as an environmentally friendly and efficient energy carrier and can be combined with fuel cells for electricity generation, which will lead to a substantial increase in hydrogen demand [1]. Thus, the source or production of hydrogen has become very important. Currently hydrogen mainly comes from the reforming reactions of natural gas, petroleum and coal, which will cause the shortage of fossil fuels and the deterioration of ecological environment. In this situation, hydrogen production from renewable biomass has gotten more and more attention in recent years. Steam reforming (SR) of bio-oil derived by fast pyrolysis of biomass has been one of the most reasonable and promising approaches for hydrogen generation [2]. Bio-oil is a complex oxygenated mixture of compounds, which include acids, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, alcohols, ethers, esters, sugars, etc. [3,4]. Studies on hydrogen production via steam reforming of bio-oil has previously been carried out by some researchers [5–9]. However, steam reforming of different model compounds is essential to make a thorough inquiry for establishing structure activity correlations of an effective catalyst and exploring the reforming reaction mechanisms [10–13]. Thermodynamic and experimental researches on hydrogen generation by steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds such as acetic acid, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethyl acetate, glucose and phenol have been extensively carried out by many authors [14–19]. However, few studies on steam reforming of hydroxyacetone (acetol) as one of the most representative ketones have been performed. Previous researches in hydroxyacetone steam reforming were carried out by many researchers [20–24]. They principally focused on catalyst development and the effects of different variables (reaction temperature, steam to carbon molar ratio, catalyst weight/hydroxyacetone flow rate ratio, nickel content in the catalyst, etc.) on hydrogen generation. However, the maximum hydrogen concentration in the product gas by hydroxyacetone SR was less than 70%, which was far below hydrogen purities required by fuel cells and the high content of CO2 and CO had a detrimental impact upon fuel cells efficiency and caused reforming catalysts poisoning [25]. From the point of view of fuel cell applications, high purities of hydrogen is required for the low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and alkaline fuel cell (AFC) and the CO content in product gas should be less than 10 ppm [26]. In order to significantly improve the hydrogen concentration and reduce the content of impurities such as CO, CO2 and CH4 in the product gas, the method of sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) was put forward [27–30], which combines both SR and in-situ CO2 separation. In this method, there are CO2 adsorbents (e.g. calcium oxide) for CO2 removal from the gas mixture and the catalysts (e.g. noble metal-based and nickel-based catalysts) for steam reforming reaction. Steam reforming reaction and CO2 separation occur simultaneously, and thus CO2 removal from the gas phase will promote the equilibrium towards the generation of hydrogen. Up to now, many researchers have successfully applied the SESR approach in hydrogen production from methane, glycerol, methanol, ethanol and butanol et al. [31–35]. To our best knowledge, this approach has not yet to be applied in hydrogen generation from hydroxyacetone. This research hence seeks to explore whether SESR can promote the hydrogen production capacity from hydroxyacetone from a thermodynamic perspective. A detailed and comprehensive reaction thermodynamic analysis of hydroxyacetone SESR for hydrogen production is necessary to provide appropriate operating parameters to maximize the production of hydrogen and inhibit the formation of byproducts to the greatest extent possible, which has the general guiding significance for further experimental work. In this study we firstly investigate the thermodynamic properties of hydroxyacetone SESR for hydrogen production. In this paper, the chemical thermodynamics of sorption enhanced steam reforming of hydroxyacetone for hydrogen production were investigated and contrasted with hydroxyacetone steam reforming. The effects of temperature, water to hydroxyacetone molar ratio (WHMR), pressure, and calcium oxide to hydroxyacetone molar ratio (CHMR) on hydrogen production and the formation of by-products were examined by the Gibbs free energy minimization principle. The related reactions on the basis of hydrogen generation and their contribution to hydrogen sensitivity were studied by response reactions (RERs) method."
1,Methodology,"The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were carried out through two methods: stoichiometric method and non stoichiometric method. The former approach is based on the equilibrium constants of chemical reactions, so it needs the exact knowledge of the chemical reactions involved in a reacting system. This makes it difficult to study coke formation during the hydroxyacetone reforming process. The latter approach is based on the direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy and needs no knowledge of the chemical reactions involved in a system, which has been successfully applied for reacting systems with multiple species and phases [36–38]. The related reactions on the basis of hydrogen generation and their contribution to hydrogen sensitivity were studied by response reactions (RERs) method. The RERs method has already been successfully applied in the chemical thermodynamics studies by Fishtik et al. [39,40]. The total Gibbs free energy G t for a reacting system is expressed by Eq. (1). (1) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i ¯ = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i 0 + R T ∑ i = 1 N n i ln f i ˆ f i 0 where G i ¯ is the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species i, n i is the moles of species i, μ i is the chemical potential of species i, G i 0 is the standard Gibbs free energy of species i, R is the molar gas constant, T is the system temperature, P is the system pressure, f i ˆ is the fugacity of species i and f i 0 is the standard-state fugacity of species i in a reacting system. For the reaction equilibria in gas phase, f i ˆ = φ i ˆ y i P , f i 0 = P 0 , and Δ G i 0 = Δ G f i 0 . The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be given by Eqs. (2) and (3) by applying the Lagrange's undetermined multiplier principle. (2) Δ G f i 0 + R T ln φ i ˆ y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (3) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln φ i ˆ y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 where Δ G f i 0 is the standard Gibbs function of formation of species i, P 0 is the pressure of 101.3 kPa in the standard state, φ i ˆ is the fugacity coefficient of species i, y i is the gas phase mole fraction, λ k is the Lagrange multiplier and a i k is the number of atoms of the kth element present in each molecule of species i and A k is the total mass of kth element in the feed. With the constraints of elemental balances: (4) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = A k When solid coke is considered in the system, the Gibbs-energy of coke is expressed by Eq. (5) with the vapor–solid phase equilibrium and the minimum Gibbs free energy of the total system can be given by Eq. (6) by applying the Lagrange's undetermined multiplier principle. (5) G ¯ C ( g ) = G ¯ C ( s ) = G C ( s ) ≅ Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 (6) ∑ i = 1 N − 1 n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln φ i ˆ y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) + n C Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 The primary species involved in hydroxyacetone steam reforming are hydroxyacetone, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane, methanol, formaldehyde, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, glycerol, acrolein, butanol, methyl ethyl ketone, allyl alcohol, and coke. Calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate were also involved when calcium oxide was used as a CO2 sorbent. The chemical thermodynamic analysis can provide appropriate operating parameters to maximize the production of hydrogen and inhibit the formation of byproducts to the greatest extent possible, which has the general guiding significance for further experimental work."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Chemical reactions involved in hydroxyacetone SESR,"3.1 Chemical reactions involved in hydroxyacetone SESR The chemical reactions involved in the hydroxyacetone SESR process are quite complex and can be described by R1–R19 given in Table 1 . Hydroxyacetone steam reforming reaction can be described by R1. Hydroxyacetone can dehydrate to acrolein and decompose to CO2 and H2 by R2 and R3, respectively. The formation of hydrogen may come from hydroxyacetone steam reforming (R1), water gas shift reaction (R6), methane steam/dry reforming (R7–R9) and coke gasification (R17), etc. Coke formation may be attributed to CH4 decomposition (R4), Boudouard reaction (R5) and carbon oxides reduction reactions (R14 and R15). The other possible reactions such as the methanation reactions (R10-R13) and reverse water gas shift reaction (R16) also occur in hydroxyacetone SESR. In addition, when hydroxyacetone steam reforming is coupled with in situ CO2 capture using calcium oxide as a CO2 sorbent, the carbonation reaction (R18) can take place. It is noteworthy that calcium oxide reacts with steam to form calcium hydroxide under high pressure through R19. The calcium hydroxide generated can also capture CO2 to form calcium carbonate by R20. Hydrogen may come from different reaction pathways on the basis of the above discussion. In order to maximize hydrogen production, it is crucial to supply enough steam and minimize hydroxyacetone dehydration and decomposition under appropriate reaction conditions."
4,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production Figs. 1 and 2 show the concentration of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 on a dry basis as a function of temperature and WHMR in SR and SESR, respectively. In the conventional SR process, the H2 concentration first increases significantly, before reaching a maximum and then decreases slightly with increasing temperature from 200 to 1200 °C (see Fig. 1(a)). When the WHMR is less than 8, the dependence of hydrogen concentration on WHMR is apparent. However, when WHMR is greater than 8, the influence of WHMR on hydrogen concentration is not obvious. Although high WHMR is helpful to improve the reforming performance, higher WHMR requires higher steam volumetric flow and greater input heat duty due to higher vaporization energy [41]. From the point of view of both hydrogen production and energy consumption, the optimal condition is a WHMR of 8 at 650 °C and atmospheric pressure in SR and the corresponding maximum hydrogen concentration is 65.4%. The thermodynamic analysis on the basis of RERs method can provide in-depth exploration into the SR process. The chemical reactions which significantly influenced hydrogen generation and their contribution to hydrogen sensitivity were studied by RERs approach. The main chemical reactions which have a noble impact on hydrogen sensitivity are the four RERs shown in Table 2 . The contributions of the four RERs on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 3 . As indicated, hydrogen is mainly derived from the two chemical reactions: R6 water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and R7 methane steam reforming reaction (MSRR). The relative fraction of MSRR in the four RERs decreases with the rise of temperature while that of WGSR shows the opposite trend. When the temperature is lower than 550 °C, MSRR contributes more than WGSR to hydrogen production and at higher temperature WGSR comes into predominance. This may be attributed to the relative amount of methane and carbon monoxide produced in the hydroxyacetone SR process, in which more methane is generated below 400 °C and more carbon monoxide is produced above 700 °C (see Fig. 1). Therefore MSRR determines hydrogen production at low temperatures whereas hydrogen generation is governed by WGSR at high temperatures. The greatest hydrogen content on a dry basis from hydroxyacetone steam reforming is only 70% based on the thermodynamic analysis. This is far below hydrogen purities required by fuel cells, especially for PEMFC [42]. In the situation, the concept of SESR was proposed to obtain high-purity hydrogen. When hydroxyacetone steam reforming is coupled with in situ CO2 capture using calcium oxide as a CO2 sorbent, the carbonation reaction can take place and the heat generated can promote the steam reforming reaction towards the generation of hydrogen, which is favor for the increase in the hydrogen production efficiency. Fig. 2(a) depicts the H2 concentrations as a function of temperature and WHMR in SESR. For a given WHMR, the concentration of H2 produced from SESR increases significantly with the rise of reaction temperature, before plateauing and subsequently decreasing. The significant increase of H2 concentration at low temperatures is a result of comprehensive effect of the thermal decomposition and steam reforming of hydroxyacetone, MSRR, WGSR, hydrogenation and methanation reactions, etc. When the temperature exceeds 650 °C, the H2 concentration decreases with increasing temperature. This could be attributed to the deactivation of the calcium oxide adsorbent. Another possible and reasonable reason is that high temperature is not conducive to the proceeding of WGSR towards hydrogen generation [27,43], which can be evidenced by the increase of CO and H2O yield in the reaction system above 650 °C. For a given reaction temperature, the H2 content in the SESR process increases with the increase of WHMR. It is obvious that the higher the WHMR is, the greater the hydrogen concentration is for a given reaction temperature. When WHMR is less than 8, the dependence of H2 concentration on WHMR is apparent. But for WHMR greater than 8, the H2 concentration changes little. Due to the possible obstacles of high WHMRs, the optimal condition is a WHMR of 8 at around 550 °C for hydroxyacetone SESR in terms of both hydrogen production and energy consumption. Another advantage of SESR is that high-purity hydrogen can be obtained. When WHMR is greater than 8, hydrogen purities are over 99% in the temperature range of 500–550 °C with a CHMR of 6 and almost no CO2 or CO is generated with very small amounts of methane. The influence of pressure on the H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations in SR and SESR is shown in Fig. 4 . In the SR process, the H2 and CO concentrations decrease, while the CO2 and CH4 concentrations increase with increasing pressure. In comparison with the results in SR, the H2 and CH4 concentrations show the similar tendency, but the H2 concentration is far higher and the CH4 concentration is much lower in SESR. The CO and CO2 concentrations in SESR are very low and close to 0. It can be concluded that low pressure is more favorable for the H2 formation and the maximum H2 content is achieved at atmosphere pressure. The sorbent-to-fuel molar ratio has an impact on hydrogen content in product gas. In order to determine its influence on gas composition, the CHMR is varied from 0 to 10 at 550 °C, the WHMR of 8 and 1 bar. The predicted H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations as a function of CHMR are displayed in Fig. 5 . As the CHMR increases from 0 to 4, the H2 concentration sharply rises from 59.5% to 98.1%. Afterwards, the H2 concentration remains relatively steady with the further increase of CHMR. The CO and CO2 concentrations show the opposite change trend to the H2 concentration. The CH4 concentration increases slightly with increasing CHMR to reach a maximum at the CHMR of 1.0 and decreases significantly with the further increase in the CHMR below 4. When the CHMR is higher than 6, the CH4 concentration is very low and close to 0. In view of the above discussion, the CHMR of 6 should be the optimal value for energy savings by minimizing the amount of calcium oxide and maintaining maximum hydrogen content and effective the capture of carbon dioxide. It can be concluded that the optimal condition is the WHMR of 8, the CHMR of 6 and 550 °C at 1 bar for the SESR process in terms of both hydrogen production and energy consumption, under which the H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations on a dry basis are 99.08%, 0.07%, 0.13% and 0.72%."
5,Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production,"3.3 Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production Oxygenated compounds such as CO and CO2 are considered as impurities because they do not compete against H2 [44]. Figs. 1(b) and 2(b) describe the CO concentration as a function of temperature and WHMR at atmospheric pressure in SR and SESR, respectively. For a given WHMR, the CO concentration increases monotonously with increasing temperatures from 200 to 1200 °C in both SR and SESR, suggesting that high temperature is not favorable for the conversion of CO. This may be ascribed to the exothermicity of WGSR. However, the CO concentration decreases monotonously with increasing WHMR from 0 to 10 in both SR and SESR. After careful comparison, it can be observed that the CO concentration values in SESR are lower than those in SR throughout the whole temperature range, indicating that the addition of CaO can inhibit the formation of CO and promote hydrogen production. The variation of CO2 concentration with temperature shows great difference in SR and SESR (see Figs. 1(c) and 2(c)). In the SR process, the CO2 concentration always decreases with the rise of temperature. For a given temperature above 550 °C, a higher WHMR is more favorable for the production of CO2. As WGSR tends to dominate in determining hydrogen production from steam reforming of hydroxyacetone above 650 °C, removal of CO2 would promote the reaction towards the generation of hydrogen. In the SESR process, calcium oxide can react with carbon dioxide and forms calcium carbonate. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the CO2 concentration is very low and close to 0 below 550 °C regardless of the WHMRs. Afterwards, when the temperature increases, the CO2 concentration increases violently to reach a maximum at around 950 °C for a given WHMR (>1). This can be ascribe to the calcium oxide deactivation at high temperatures, which is a common phenomenon reported previously by some researchers [45,46]. Finally, the CO2 concentration decreases slightly with a further increase in temperature. For a given temperature, the CO2 concentration always increases with the increase of WHMR in SESR."
6,Methane production,"3.4 Methane production For hydrogen production, methane is not a desirable product as its production competes with hydrogen generation [40]. Figs. 1(d) and 2(d) depicts the CH4 concentration versus temperature and WHMR in SR and SESR, respectively. The CH4 concentration decreases with increasing temperatures in both SR and SESR. When the temperature exceeds 800 °C, the CH4 content is very low and close to 0, suggesting that the generation of CH4 is almost entirely inhibited at high temperatures. For a given temperature, the equilibrium concentration of CH4 from SR and SESR always decreases with the increase of WHMR, indicating that high WHMR can inhibit the formation of CH4. It is also noted that when the WHMR is higher than 6, the concentration of CH4 from SESR is lower than that from SR below 600 °C. This is mainly because calcium oxide reacts more easily with CO2 to form calcium carbonate and promotes the reaction R7 equilibrium towards the positive direction, leading to relatively low CH4 concentration. However, there are similar CH4 concentrations in both SR and SESR above 700 °C."
7,Coke formation,"3.5 Coke formation The coke formed during catalytic SR of hydroxyacetone could result in the poisoning or deactivation of reforming catalysts, leading to low durability and activity. Thus the avoidance or inhibition of coke formation is very important in SR. As can be seen from Fig. 6 , high WHMR has a detrimental effect on coke formation in both SR and SESR. When the WHMR is higher than 8, the formation of coke is almost entirely inhibited or avoided in the whole temperature range considered here. Obviously, high WHMR is unfavorable for coke formation. In the SR process, the coke yield decreases with the rise of temperature for a given WHMR (<8). The maximum amount of coke is ca. 2.07 mol per mol hydroxyacetone which is obtained at 200 °C and WHMR = 0. In comparison with SR, SESR has the advantage of almost complete inhibition of coke formation in the temperature range of 200–1200 °C for WHMR ≥ 3, indicating that the addition of calcium oxide could inhibit coke formation."
8,Other thermodynamically possible products,"3.6 Other thermodynamically possible products Apart from those species mentioned above, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane, methanol, formaldehyde, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, glycerol, acrolein, butanol, methyl ethyl ketone and allyl alcohol are also considered in this study. These products appear in the temperature range of 200–1200 °C for SR and SESR, however, their concentrations are very low and approach zero."
9,Conclusions,"The chemical thermodynamics of sorption enhanced steam reforming of hydroxyacetone for hydrogen production were investigated and contrasted with hydroxyacetone steam reforming. The effects of temperature, water to hydroxyacetone molar ratio, pressure, and calcium oxide to hydroxyacetone molar ratio on hydrogen production and the formation of by-products were studied. Hydrogen was mainly derived from methane steam reforming reaction and water gas shift reaction. The former reaction determines hydrogen production below 550 °C whereas hydrogen generation is governed by the latter one at high temperatures. In SESR, hydrogen purities are over 99% in 525–550 °C with a WHMR greater than 8 and a CHMR of 6. The optimum temperature for SESR is approximately 125 °C lower than that for SR. High pressure is not favorable for hydrogen production. The effects of temperature and WHMR on the SESR process were very significant. With increasing temperature, H2 and CO2 concentration increased until a peak temperature and there was a declining trend with a further increase in temperature. The CO concentration increased with temperature whereas the CH4 concentration decreased. By increasing WHMR, hydrogen and CO2 concentration could be increased along with a reduction in CO and CH4 concentration. In comparison with SR, SESR has the advantage of almost complete inhibition of coke formation in 200–1200 °C for WHMR ≥ 3."
