0,Introduction,"The development of food packaging films based on biopolymers (e.g. polysaccharides, proteins and lipids) has received increasing attention in recent years [1]. These biopolymer-based packaging films are biodegradable and renewable, which is advantageous to environmental protection. Among several biopolymers, locust bean gum (LBG) is a plant-derived heterogeneous polysaccharide composed by β-(1→4)-linked D-mannopyranosyl backbone with D-galactopyranosyl side branches attached via α-(l–6) linkage [2]. LBG is normally isolated from the endosperm of carob bean (Ceratonia siliqua L.) by hot water extraction and ethanol/isopropanol precipitation. LBG is a suitable matrix for packaging film production due to its superior biodegradable and film-forming properties [3]. LBG-based packaging films act not only as the semi-permeable barriers towards moisture and gases but also as the carriers of bioactive substances, such as antibiotics, bacteriocins, plant extracts and essential oils [4]. Nonetheless, single LBG films cannot meet the practical application requirements because of their high water sensitivity and low mechanical property. It has been demonstrated that the D-galactopyranosyl side branches can produce strong synergistic interaction with other polymers [4]. Thus, the blend of LBG with other polymers is a feasible way to offset the drawbacks of pure LBG films [5–7]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a biodegradable and nontoxic polymer, is a suitable synergistic agent for LBG films [8]. In this context, packaging films developed by blending LBG with PVA showed improved mechanical and barrier properties as compared with single LBG films [9]. Recently, the research of food packaging films has been extended from traditional packaging to smart packaging fields. Smart packaging techniques including gas detectors, pH indicators and humidity/temperature sensors can provide consumers with information about the quality and the storage conditions of food [10]. Among different smart packaging techniques, pH indicators are normally prepared by embedding pigments in biopolymer-based matrix [10,11]. These pigment-embedded films are normally color changeable when external acid-base status changes, thereby presenting a real-time visual sign in response to the changes of food quality and storage conditions [12]. Till now, both synthetic and natural pigments have been added into biopolymer-based matrix to develop smart packaging films [10]. However, synthetic pigments (e.g. methyl red and bromothymol blue) are carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic substances that have potential risks to human health [13]. Therefore, researchers tend to use natural pigments, such as anthocyanins, betaines, brazilin, carotenoids, chlorophylls, curcumin and quercetin, in smart packaging films [14]. Betacyanins, one type of water-soluble natural pigments belonging to betalains, are widely distributed in the plant order Caryophyllales [15]. Betacyanins are pH-sensitive substances, showing stable red-violet color at acidic and neutral conditions whereas brown/yellow color at alkaline conditions. The color changes of betacyanins from red-violet to brown/yellow are associated with the degradation of betacyanins into betalamic acid [16]. Notably, the spoilage of protein-rich food (e.g. meat and seafood) is normally associated with the elevation of food pH status [17]. Therefore, the pH-sensitivity of betacyanins is beneficial to indicate the freshness/spoilage extent of protein-rich food in real-time. Till now, betacyanins isolated from different plants including pitaya [18,19], cactus pear [20,21], vegetable amaranth [22,23], beetroot [24–26] and globe amaranth [26] have been incorporated into different biopolymer-based matrix to develop smart packaging films. These betacyanins-rich smart packaging films are sensitive to acid-base conditions and thus have wide applications in indicating the freshness of milk [18], shrimp [19,21,22,26] and beef [24]. However, studies on the development of smart packaging films by using betacyanins from other plant sources are very limited. Cockscomb (Celosia cristata L.), an edible and ornamental plant, belongs to the Amarantheceae family of the Caryophyllales order [27]. Cockscomb is widely planted in subtropical and temperate zones of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia [28]. The red-violet colored flower of cockscomb contains a large quantity of betacyanins that are mainly composed of amaranthine and isoamaranthine [29,30]. Apart from coloring attributes, betacyanins isolated from cockscomb flower also show strong antioxidant activity [30]. Therefore, betacyanins from cockscomb flower have potential to be used in smart packaging films. However, no study has been conducted on the development of smart packaging films by using betacyanins from cockscomb flower. In this study, we extracted betacyanins from cockscomb flower and then prepared smart packaging films by incorporating cockscomb flower extract into LBG/PVA blend. The effect of cockscomb flower extract content (4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt%) on the structural, physical and functional properties of LBG/PVA films was investigated. Meanwhile, the films were used to indicate the freshness/spoilage extent of shrimp."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Died cockscomb (C. cristata L.) flower used for the extraction of betacyanins was purchased from the local market (Yangzhou, China). Macro-porous resin AB-8 (particle diameter: 0.3–1.25 mm and average pore diameter: 13–14 nm) used for the purification of betacyanins was obtained from Donghong Chemical Co. (Zibo, China). LBG (average molecular weight: 310 kDa), PVA (polymerization degree: ~1750), glycerol, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co. (Shanghai, China). Other reagents used were of analytical grade."
3,Extraction of betalains,"2.2 Extraction of betalains Based on the method of Yao et al. [21], dried cockscomb flower (1000 g) was crushed and extracted in 5000 mL of 80% ethanol solution at 4 °C overnight. After that, the extract solution was obtained by first filtration with 100 mesh sieve and then centrifugation at 10000 g for 30 min. Then, the supernatant was loaded onto the column of macro-porous resin AB-8 that was sequentially eluted with deionized water and 80% ethanol solution. The 80% ethanol solution eluted fraction was rich in betacyanins and was collected, concentrated and finally lyophilized to obtain cockscomb flower extract. The yield of cockscomb flower extract was 2.29 mg/g dried flower."
4,Characterization of cockscomb flower extract,"2.3 Characterization of cockscomb flower extract The total betacyanin content in cockscomb flower extract was determined by the method of Qin et al. [19] and expressed as mg betanin equivalents per g dried extract. The pH-sensitivity of cockscomb flower extract was recorded by dissolving 1 mg extract in 10 mL buffer solutions (pH 3−12) at 25 °C for 2 h. Afterwards, the visible absorption spectra of extract buffer solutions were recorded by ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, USA) from 400 to 700 nm [31]."
5,Preparation of films,"2.4 Preparation of films Films were prepared according to the method of Matar and Andac [9] with some modifications. Briefly, 1.6% LBG solution was prepared by dissolving LBG in deionized water at 100 °C for 2 h. Meanwhile, 4% PVA solution was prepared by dissolving PVA in deionized water at 85 °C for 2 h. Afterwards, 200 mL LBG solution was blended with 40 mL PVA solution by continuously stirring at 80 °C for 2 h. After LBG/PVA blend was cooled to 40 °C, 1.2 g glycerol (25 wt% on the basis of film matrix) and different contents of cockscomb flower extract (0 wt%, 4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt% on the basis of film matrix) were added into the blend. The obtained film-forming solutions were degassed, cast in Plexiglas moulds (24 cm × 24 cm) and dried at 30 °C for 48 h to yield films. LBG/PVA films containing 0 wt%, 4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt% cockscomb flower extract were named as LP, LPC-4, LPC-8 and LPC-12 films, respectively. All the films were conditioned in a desiccator with 50% relative humidity (RH) at 25 °C for 48 h before testing."
6,Structural characterization of films,"2.5 Structural characterization of films Film sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen to fracture, and then mounted on an aluminum stub. After sputtered with gold under vacuum, the cross-section of film was observed by a scanning electron microscopy (GeminiSEM 300, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 2 kV and 1200× magnification. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of film was performed on a spectrophotometer (Varian 670, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) at attenuated total reflection model and 4000–400 cm−1. X-ray diffractogram (XRD) analysis of film was performed on a diffractometer (AXS D8 Advance, Bruker Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) with Ni-filtered CuKa radiation at 5−75° (2θ)."
7,Determination of the physical property of films,"2.6 Determination of the physical property of films 2.6.1 Colors Color values of film including L*, a* and b* were determined by a colorimeter (SC-80C, Kangguang Instrument Co., Beijing, China) using a white standard plate as background. Three replicates were performed for each kind of film. The total color difference (ΔE) of film was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) ∆ E = L s − L ∗ 2 + a s − a ∗ 2 + b s − b ∗ 2 where L s, a s and b s are the color parameters of white standard plate. 2.6.2 Light transmittance Light transmittance was determined by scanning film sample (4 cm × 1 cm) from 200 to 800 nm with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, USA). 2.6.3 Thickness The thickness of film was measured at ten randomly selected locations on each film by a micrometer (Mitutoyo No. 293-766, Tester Sangyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) with accuracy of 0.001 mm. 2.6.4 Water vapor permeability (WVP) The WVP of film was determined by the method of Yong et al. [32]. Briefly, film sample (6 cm × 6 cm) was sealed on a centrifuge tube containing 45 g fully dried silica gel. The centrifuge tube was placed in a desiccator at 25 °C with 100% RH and the weight gain of film sample was weighed every 24 h for 7 consecutive days. Three replicates were performed for each kind of film. WVP was calculated by Eq. (2): (2) WVP = W × x t × A × ∆ P where W is the weight gain of film sample (g), x is film thickness (m), t is time (s), A is the permeation area of film sample (m2), and ΔP is saturated vapor pressure at 25 °C. 2.6.5 Mechanical property The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of film sample (6 cm × 1 cm) was determined by a texture analyzer (TMS-Pro, Food Technology Co., Sterling, USA) at 25 °C with 50% RH. The film sample had grip separation of 4 cm and deformation speed of 1 mm/s [19]. Six replicates were performed for each kind of film. TS and EAB were calculated by Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. (3) TS = F x × W (4) EAB = ∆ L L 0 × 100 where F is the stress of film at break (N), x is film thickness (mm), and W is film width (mm); ΔL and L 0 are the elongated and original lengths (mm) of film sample, respectively."
8,Determination of the functional property of films,"2.7 Determination of the functional property of films 2.7.1 Antioxidant activity The antioxidant ability of film was evaluated by DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays [33]. Three replicates were performed for each kind of film. For DPPH radical scavenging assay, different amounts of film sample (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mg) were immersed in 4 mL of 100 μmol/L DPPH methanol solution at 25 °C for 1 h in the dark. Then, film sample was taken out and the rest solution was measured at 517 nm. For ABTS radical scavenging assay, different amounts of film sample (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mg) were immersed in 4 mL ABTS radical solution with absorbance of about 0.7 at 734 nm. After reaction at 25 °C for 30 min, film sample was taken out and the rest solution was measured at 734 nm. 2.7.2 pH-sensitivity The pH-sensitivity of film was determined by soaking film sample (2 cm × 2 cm) in 10 mL different buffer solutions (pH 3–12) at 25 °C for 1 min. After that, film sample was taken out and the film color was recorded [32]. 2.7.3 Ammonia-sensitivity The ammonia-sensitivity of film was determined by attaching film sample (2 cm × 2 cm) to the headspace of Petri dish (diameter: 9 cm and height: 1 cm) containing 15 mL of 2 mol/L ammonia solution. After exposing film sample in ammonia atmosphere at 25 °C for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min, the color of film sample was recorded [21]."
9,Application of films as shrimp freshness indicators,"2.8 Application of films as shrimp freshness indicators To applied film as shrimp freshness indicator, film sample (3 cm × 1 cm) was stuck to the headspace of a polypropylene box (diameter: 12 cm and height: 4 cm). Shrimp (80 g) was carefully placed in the box without directly contacting with film sample. After shrimp was stored at 20 °C for 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 h, the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) level of shrimp was measured by a Kjeldahl distillation apparatus (K9860, Jinan Hanon Instruments Co., Jinan, China) and the color of film was simultaneously recorded [19]. Three replicates were performed for each kind of film."
10,Statistical analysis,2.9 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software based on Duncan test and one-way analysis of variance. The significant level of p < 0.05 was selected.
11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of cockscomb flower extract,"3.1 Characterization of cockscomb flower extract Total betacyanin content in cockscomb flower extract was 20.59 mg betanin equivalents/g dried extract. Cai et al. [34] extracted betacyanins from seven Amaranthus family and found the total betacyanin content of Amaranthus plants ranged from 15.4 to 46.9 mg betanin equivalents/g dried extract. Thus, our results suggested cockscomb flower was a good source of betacyanins. The color and visible absorption spectrum of cockscomb flower extract changed in different buffer solutions (Fig. 1 ). The extract solution presented red color when the pH of solution was between 3 and 8. At pH 9, the extract solution turned reddish-purple. At higher pH values (10−12), the extract solution became light brown and yellow. Cai et al. [35] documented betacyanins were much stable at acidic conditions and easily degraded into yellow colored betalamic acid and colorless cyclo-Dopa-5-O-(malonyl)-β-glucoside at alkaline conditions. The maximum visible absorption peak of cockscomb flower extract solution appeared at 538 nm, corresponding to the characteristic absorption band of betacyanins [21]. The maximum absorption band intensity of cockscomb flower extract solution slightly increased from pH 3 to pH 7 and rapidly increased at pH 8. At pH 9−12, the maximum absorption band of extract solution gradually decreased and shifted to higher wavelengths. The changes in the visible absorption spectrum of cockscomb flower extract at different pH values were associated with the degradation of betacyanins [19]. Other researchers also found the color and visible absorption spectrum of betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21], vegetable amaranth [23] and beetroot extract [24] changed in different buffer solutions."
13,SEM images,"3.2 SEM images The cross-sections of LP and LPC films are shown in Fig. 2 . LP film presented a heterogeneous cross-section with obvious phase separation. Nonetheless, LP film was compact without any pores. The similar phenomenon was observed by Ma et al. [36] in tara gum/PVA blend film. The heterogeneous morphology of LP film was caused by the low immiscibility between LBG and PVA. Thus, obvious phase separation was observed in LP film. As compared with LP film, LPC-4 and LPC-8 films showed more homogeneous morphologies, indicating 4 wt% and 8 wt% of cockscomb flower extract significantly elevated the immiscibility between LBG and PVA. This results suggested 4 wt% and 8 wt% of cockscomb flower extract was compatible with LBG/PVA blend. However, 12 wt% of cockscomb flower extract formed agglomeration and reduced the homogeneity of film. As a result, LPC-12 film showed a heterogeneous cross-section. Above results demonstrated the homogeneity of the film was greatly affected by the content of cockscomb flower extract. Similarly, Yao et al. [21] found the homogeneity of quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA film was improved by 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 3 wt% of betacyanins-rich cactus pear extract. However, Qin et al. [19] documented the low immiscibility between starch and PVA was not significantly elevated by 0.25 wt%, 0.50 wt% and 1.00 wt% of betacyanins-rich pitaya extract, which was probably due to the low content of pitaya extract."
14,FT-IR spectra,"3.3 FT-IR spectra The FT-IR spectra of LP and LPC films are shown in Fig. 3 . LP film exhibited a strong and broad band around 3280 cm−1, corresponding to O−H stretching vibration of LBG and PVA. The bands at 2933 cm−1 corresponded to C−H stretching vibration of LBG and CH2 stretching vibration of PVA [36]. The bands at 1648 cm−1 and 1413 cm−1 were associated with bound water and CH2 bending vibration of PVA, respectively [3,21]. The bands between 1026 and 1145 cm−1 were assigned to C−O stretching vibration of LBG and PVA. The similar FT-IR spectrum of LP film was reported by Matar and Andac [9]. LPC films showed some differences in the FT-IR spectra. After adding cockscomb flower extract, the O−H stretching vibration band shifted to higher wavenumbers (3283−3294 cm−1). This indicated cockscomb flower extract affected the hydrogen bonding system of LP film. After adding cockscomb flower extract, the C−H/CH2 stretching vibration band, bound water band and C−O stretching vibration band shifted to lower wavenumbers at 2926−2929 cm−1, 1631−1643 cm−1 and 1021−1022 cm−1, respectively. Above results revealed betacyanins from cockscomb flower extract interacted with LBG/PVA blend through hydrogen bonds. The molecular interactions between cockscomb flower betacyanins and LBG/PVA blend are presented in Fig. 4 . Other researchers also observed betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21], vegetable amaranth extract [22] and beetroot extract [24] made the bands of polymer-based films shift."
15,XRD patterns,"3.4 XRD patterns The XRD patterns of LP and LPC films are shown in Fig. 5 . LP film exhibited a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.8°, corresponding to the high crystalline nature of PVA [9]. LP film also presented some small diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.98°, 11.4° and 17.2°, which were attributed to the low crystalline nature of LBG [3]. However, after adding cockscomb flower extract, the crystalline degree of LP film slightly decreased. This was because cockscomb flower extract was well dispersed in film matrix (Fig. 2) and established interactions with LBG/PVA blend (Fig. 4). As a result, the interactions between LBG and PVA were reduced by cockscomb flower extract and LPC films showed lower crystalline degrees than LP film. Recently, Matar and Andac [9] also found the crystalline degree of LP film remarkably decreased after adding silver nanoparticles, which was because silver nanoparticles formed strong interactions with LBG/PVA blend. Similarly, Qin et al. [19] observed the crystalline degree of starch/PVA film decreased after the addition of betacyanins-rich pitaya extract. However, Vargas et al. [25] and Yao et al. [21] documented the addition of betacyanins-rich cactus pear extract and beetroot extract increased the crystalline degree of polymer-based films. This suggested the XRD patterns of betacyanins-rich films could be related to the source of betacyanins."
16,Colors,"3.5 Colors The colors of LP and LPC films are shown in Fig. 6A. LP film was colorless whereas LPC films were reddish-purple. The color of LPC films deepened when cockscomb flower extract content increased from 4 wt% to 12 wt%. In addition, cockscomb flower extract was evenly distributed in film matrix and thus LPC films showed uniform colors. As shown in Table 1 , the L* values of LPC films were much lower than LP film. However, the a* and ΔE values of LPC films were much higher than LP film, confirming LPC films had higher redness degrees and LPC films were more colored than LP film. The similar colors were observed in quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films [21] and alginate/starch/beetroot extract films [26]. However, Qin et al. [19] and Hu et al. [22] found starch/PVA/pitaya extract films and quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films were pink. Above results suggested the color of betacyanins-rich films could be related to the source of betacyanins."
17,Light transmittance,"3.6 Light transmittance The light transmittance of LP and LPC films, reflecting the light barrier property of the films, is shown in Fig. 6B. LP film showed light transmittance below 60%, which was consistent with the light transmittance of tara gum/PVA film [36]. Ma et al. [36] also found the light transmittance of tara gum/PVA film was lower than that of single tara gum film and PVA film, which was attributed to the low immiscibility between LBG and PVA. Notably, the addition of cockscomb flower extract made the light transmittance of the film decreased. Moreover, the light transmittance of LPC films gradually decreased when cockscomb flower extract content increased from 4 wt% to 12 wt%. In the visible light range, the transmittance of LPC films significantly decreased at about 540 nm, which was attributed to the strong absorption of cockscomb flower betacyanins (Fig. 1B). Above results suggested the light barrier property of the films was greatly elevated by cockscomb flower extract that was rich in betacyanins. The chromophores in betacyanins, such as C=C, C=N and C=O, had strong UV-vis light absorption ability [19]. Several researchers also found the light barrier property of the films was enhanced by betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21], vegetable amaranth extract [22] and beetroot extract [24]."
18,Thicknesses,"3.7 Thicknesses As shown in Table 2 , LP film and LPC film showed similar thicknesses, ranging from 0.079 to 0.081 mm. This indicated the addition of 4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt% of cockscomb flower extract did not significantly change the thickness of film. Although the total mass in the film increased after adding cockscomb flower extract, the film thickness was almost unchanged. This was because cockscomb flower extract was evenly distributed in film matrix and improved the immiscibility between LBG and PVA (Fig. 2). As a result, the compactness of the film was elevated by cockscomb flower extract. Other researchers also found the addition of 1 wt%−3 wt% of cactus pear extract [21] and 0.25 wt%−1 wt% of pitaya extract [19] had little impact on the thickness of the film. However, Hu et al. [22] documented the addition of 5 wt%−15 wt% of vegetable amaranth extract [22] significantly increased the thickness of quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin film."
19,WVP,"3.8 WVP The WVP of LP and LPC films, reflecting the moisture barrier property of the films, is shown in Table 2. LP film had the WVP of 12.51 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1, which was close to the WVP of tara gum/PVA film [36]. The addition of 4 wt% and 8 wt% of cockscomb flower extract significantly reduced the WVP of film to 11.65 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 and 10.34 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1, respectively. This was because 4 wt% and 8 wt% of cockscomb flower extract made the film become uniform and compact (Fig. 2). However, when the content of cockscomb flower extract increased to 12 wt%, the WVP of film increased to 12.43 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1. This was because the excessive content of cockscomb flower extract could form agglomeration and reduced the homogeneity and compactness of film (Fig. 2). Several previous studies reported the addition of low content of betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21], vegetable amaranth extract [22] and beetroot extract [24] was benefit to reduce the WVP of film. The WVP of LPC films was lower than that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films (from 26.4 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 to 31.6 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1) [22] and starch/PVA/pitaya extract films (from 24.8 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 to 28.8 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1) [19]. Besides, the WVP of LPC films was similar with that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films (from 12.5 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 to 13.8 × 10−11 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1) [21]. This indicated LPC films had strong moisture barrier property."
20,Mechanical properties,"3.9 Mechanical properties The TS and EAB of LP and LPC films are summarized in Table 2. The TS and EAB of LP film were 20.88 MPa and 29.65%, respectively. Ma et al. [36] revealed tara gum/PVA film showed higher TS but lower EAB than single tara gum film and PVA film, which was because tara gum and PVA formed strong hydrogen bonds during film-forming process. As compared with LP film, LPC-8 and LPC-12 films had higher TS. Moreover, LPC-8 film showed the highest TS (23.63 MPa) among all the films, which was due to the uniform and compact morphology of LPC-8 film (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with WVP measurement that LPC-8 film had the lowest WVP. However, LPC-12 film, due to its less uniform and compact morphology, showed lower TS (22.42 MPa) than LPC-8 film. Similarly, several researchers documented the TS of film first increased and then decreased when the content of betacyanins-rich cactus pear extract [21], vegetable amaranth extract [22] and beetroot extract [24] increased. The TS of LPC films was lower than that of starch/PVA/pitaya extract films (from 30.8 to 35.1 MPa) [19] but higher than that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films (from 15.8 to 18.5 MPa) [21] and quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films (from 9.3 to 14.3 MPa) [22]. Notably, the EAB of LPC film gradually increased from 31.8% to 41.1% when cockscomb flower extract content increased from 4 wt% to 12 wt%. This indicated cockscomb flower extract had some plastic effect on the film, which was because cockscomb flower extract reduced the interactions between LBG and PVA and facilitated the movement of polymeric chains. Similar enhancements of EAB were observed in starch/PVA/pitaya extract films [19], quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films [21] and quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films [22]. The EAB of LPC films was lower than that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films (from 71.5% to 88.8%) [22] but higher than that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films (from 16.8% to 27.3%) [21]. The EAB of LPC films was similar with that of starch/PVA/pitaya extract films (from 39.6% to 42.0%) [19]. Therefore, our results suggested LPC films had good mechanical properties."
21,Antioxidant activity,"3.10 Antioxidant activity DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays were used to measure the antioxidant activity of the films. As shown in Fig. 7 , LP films had the lowest DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities. However, the addition of 4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt% of cockscomb flower extract significantly increased the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of the film in dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of LPC films increased when cockscomb flower extract content increased from 4 wt% to 12 wt%. The DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of LPC-12 film at 5 mg/mL reached 79.54% and 98.70%, respectively. This suggested the elevated film antioxidant activity was due to the action of cockscomb flower extract, which was rich in betacyanins with hydrogen-atom donating capacity [15]. Up to now, several researchers demonstrated the addition of betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [20,21], vegetable amaranth extract [22,23] and beetroot extract [26] increased the antioxidant activity of films. Notably, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of LPC films was higher than that of starch/PVA/pitaya extract films [19] and quaternary ammonium chitosan/PVA/cactus pear extract films [21]. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of LPC films was slightly lower than that of quaternary ammonium chitosan/fish gelatin/vegetable amaranth extract films [22]. Our results suggested LPC films had potential to be used as antioxidant packaging materials in food industry."
22,pH-sensitivity and ammonia-sensitivity,"3.11 pH-sensitivity and ammonia-sensitivity The pH-sensitivity of LPC films is shown in Fig. 8A. Since betacyanins-rich cockscomb flower extract was pH-sensitive (Fig. 1A), LPC films showed different colors at different buffer solutions. LPC films exhibited stable reddish-purple colors at pH 3−8 and turned light brown or light purple at pH 9−12. The color changes of LPC films were related to the structural degradation of betacyanins in alkaline solutions [19]. Due to different betacyanin contents in LPC films, the color changing profiles of LPC films were somewhat different. Our results were in agreement with Guo et al. [24] who also observed the color of pectin/beetroot extract films changed from red to purple, brown and yellow when pH value increased. The ammonia-sensitivity of LPC films is shown in Fig. 8B. The reddish-purple color of LPC films gradually faded within 60 min, which was because volatile ammonia created an alkaline micro-environment in the films and made betacyanins degrade into betalamic acid and cyclo-Dopa-5-O-(malonyl)-β-glucoside [19]. The similar phenomena were reported in the films containing betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21] and vegetable amaranth extract [22]. Recently, Vargas et al. [25] also found alginate/starch films containing beetroot extract showed color changes when the films were exposed to five different synthetic amines, i.e., ammonia, cadaverine, pyridine, tyramine and triehlamine. The pH-sensitivity and ammonia-sensitivity of LPC films were especially useful to indicate the freshness of protein-rich food."
23,Application films in indicating shrimp freshness,"3.12 Application films in indicating shrimp freshness Shrimp is a highly perishable product due to the combined actions of microorganisms and endogenous enzymes, resulting in the release of volatile nitrogen compounds [37]. TVB-N is often used as a biomarker of shrimp spoilage [38]. Chinese Standard GB 2733–2015 stipulates the TVB-N upper limit of edible shrimp is 20 mg/100 g. In this study, we used LPC films to indicate the freshness/spoilage degree of shrimp by attaching LPC films to the headspace of container. As shown in Table 3 , the TVB-N level of shrimp gradually increased from 7.01 mg/100 g to 50.24 mg/100 g within 48 h at 20 °C. The TVB-N level of shrimp exceeded the upper limit of edible shrimp at 24 h. At this moment, visible color changes from reddish-purple to brown/yellow were noted for LPC films. This indicated LPC films were suitable to indicate the freshness of shrimp. In several previous studies, researchers also documented the films containing betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [19], cactus pear extract [21] and vegetable amaranth extract [22] were useful to indicate shrimp freshness. Meanwhile, some researchers found the films containing betacyanins-rich pitaya extract [18], vegetable amaranth extract [23] and beetroot extract [24] were suitable to indicate the freshness of other food, such as milk, chicken, fish and beef."
24,Conclusion,"Smart packaging films were successfully developed based on LBG, PVA and betacyanins-rich cockscomb flower extract. Cockscomb flower extract had a profound effect on the structural, physical and functional properties of LBG/PVA blend films. The addition of cockscomb flower extract improved the homogeneity, EAB and antioxidant activity of film, however, reduced the light transmittance of film. Amongst LPC films, LPC-8 film had the highest water vapor barrier ability and TS whereas LPC-12 film had the highest light barrier ability and antioxidant activity. Due to pH-sensitive and ammonia-sensitivity, LPC films effectively indicated the freshness of shrimp."
