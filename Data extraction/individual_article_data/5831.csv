0,Introduction,"Gold is the noblest metal and does not adsorb most molecules from the gas phase [1]. Therefore, gold as bulk metal is known to be rather inactive in heterogeneously catalysed reactions, whereas highly dispersed gold particles in the size range between 1 and 10nm supported on different oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZrO2) show surprisingly high activities in some reactions important to the chemical industry and environmental catalysis. The oxidation of carbon monoxide at low temperatures is mainly used as model reaction to study the unusual properties of gold catalysts [2–4]. Unfortunately, focussing on oxidation reactions masked the capabilities of gold in hydrogenation reactions. Therefore, to evaluate the catalytic potential of gold, other chemical reactions and in particular those which also allow to control the selectivity have to be considered. In this contribution, the hydrogenation reactions discussed here are those where gold has been demonstrated to have potential advantages with respect to, at first, selectivity, and then activity. Reactions over such gold catalysts are considered which contain only gold as basis element (supported monometallic gold catalysts) or where the structural and catalytic properties of gold were modified by a second metal (bimetallic catalysts). This, for example, excludes hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions over bimetallic catalysts containing gold as second metal (e.g. as Pd–Au alloys), which can of course influence the activity and selectivity of Group VIII metals. At first, results of theoretical studies and reliable experimental information concerning the adsorption and activation of hydrogen are highlighted."
1,Hydrogen adsorption on gold surfaces and supported gold catalysts,"When using gold catalysts to convert unsaturated organic molecules with molecular hydrogen the question arises, in contrast to the well-established chemisorption and hydrogenation properties of Group VIII–X metals, why gold is active in hydrogenations at all? Of course, adsorption of the organic molecule is necessary via a functional group (e.g. CC, CO) on active sites of small gold particles itself or at the metal-support [5] or perimeter interface [6]. The second part of this question concerns a preliminary for a heterogeneous catalysed hydrogenation, namely how the hydrogen molecule is activated/dissociated on gold catalysts. It is, in general, well known, that adsorption of molecular hydrogen does not occur on (clean) gold surfaces, keeping in mind that this hypothesis concerns certainly the properties of bulk gold. However, there is a lack of information concerning quantitative data of the adsorption of hydrogen on gold surfaces and supported gold catalysts. The reactivity of small unsupported (gas phase) Au clusters towards D2 does not only depend strongly on the size, but also on the cluster charge state [7]. Deuterium is readily adsorbed on cationic gold clusters of less than 16 atoms. Recently, it has been shown by Varganov et al. [8], who studied the reactions between neutral and negatively charged gold clusters with molecular hydrogen using density functional theory, second-order pertubation theory and coupled cluster methods that one and even two H2 molecules are easily bound to neutral Au2 and Au3 clusters with binding energies of 0.55 and 0.71eV, respectively. On the other hand, the activation energies for dissociatively adsorbed H2 on these clusters are 1.10 and 0.59eV. It was found that negatively charged gold clusters do not bind molecular hydrogen, whereas H2 dissociation can occur with activation energies of 0.93eV for Au2 − and 1.39eV for Au3 − clusters. DFT calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies of H2 dissociation on Au (111) illustrated that the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate are the most important factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate–gold interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation [1]. Dissociative chemisorption on a seven atom gold cluster was found to be endothermic by about 138kJmol−1 with a barrier of about 188kJmol−1, whereas molecular desorption was estimated to be in the order of 50kJmol−1 [9]. By investigating the influence of thin gold film surface nanostructure on chemisorption of hydrogen on unsintered gold films at 78K, Stobinski et al. [10–13] have reported that H2 chemisorption occurs only on Au surface atoms of low coordination number forming AuH2 complexes. This suggests a dependence of the chemisorption process on the increasing amount of corners and edges for decreasing gold particle sizes, i.e., a Au-particle size dependence. In the case of gold films on W (100), a linear decrease in the amount of adsorbed hydrogen at 300K was observed for increasing Au loadings up to one monolayer using thermal desorption spectroscopy [14]. Atomic hydrogen, obtained during thermal dissociation on a hot tungsten filament [12] or supplied to the gold surface by diffusing them through a Pd–Ag alloy membrane on which a gold layer was electropolated [15,16] does adsorb on gold films at low temperature. At high coverages of H on the gold surface, hydrogen atoms can be incorporated easily into the subsurface of thin Au films at 78K [13]. Hydrogen chemisorption on supported gold catalysts is occasionally reported in a very few studies, while sometimes it was not observed at all [5,17,18]. In fact, no measurable H2 adsorption was observed on silica and titania supported gold catalysts at either 298 or 473K with exception of a low-temperature-reduced 2.3wt.% Au/TiO2 catalyst for which a very low uptake was observed [5]. Measurements of (irreversible) hydrogen adsorption at 273K over 20.5g of 10 wt.% Au/Al2O3 catalyst in a closed gas circulating system gave a molar H2/Au ratio of 0.14 [19]. Hydrogen activation probably occurs via gold atomically dissolved (“solid solution”) or condensed in very small, flat clusters of a few gold atoms present in Al2O3-, MgO- and SiO2-supported gold catalysts beside a gold particulate phase [20]. The molecular hydrogen adsorption on small gold clusters is very different from that of molecular oxygen [21,22]. Because atomic oxygen readily adsorbs on gold and is reactive to molecular hydrogen from the gas phase, hydrogen activation could proceed by this mechanism. Results of Naito and Tanimoto [23] of the effect of oxygen addition (16O2–18O2) on H2–D2 exchange over Au/SiO2 catalysts with very low metal loading (0.025wt.%) indicated that oxygen molecules are not dissociatively chemisorbed on the gold surface at 423K but behave as a peroxo-like adsorbed species, which enhances the dissociation of hydrogen molecules. It was speculated that similar peroxo-like surface structures responsible for hydrogen activation might be formed on highly dispersed gold surfaces through the interaction with oxygen of the catalyst support. The contribution of the oxide support or oxygen-related surface species which play a significant role by providing a source of atomic hydrogen to the gold surface is one of the most significant features to arise from these studies [23,24]."
2,Hydrogenation reactions studied using gold catalysts,"The literature till the 1960s indicates that gold seems to be very popular for being catalytically inert in hydrogenation [25]. During the following decades most of the work involved mainly the adsorption/activation of hydrogen and hydrogen exchange on gold surfaces, as shown in the previous section, and the hydrogenation of relatively simple molecules, such as CO, CO2, alkenes and alkadienes. Only a very limited number of publications concern the selective hydrogenation of complex organic molecules with more than one unsaturated group to reactions products, which are of interest for the chemical industry. As it was recognized that gold can be prepared as nanoparticles on oxidic supports by wet-chemical techniques, such as deposition–precipitation or coprecipitation methods [26], a breakthrough came in heterogeneously catalysed hydrogenations using multifunctional organic compounds (e.g. α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones) as educts. In Table 1 , a comprehensive overview of the hydrogenation reactions studied together with the gold catalysts used is given considering the literature up to September 2004. It is apparent from the cited reports that supported gold catalysts have in some cases superior prospects for employing them in industrial catalysis. Beside the partial hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene [19,27] and 1,3-butadiene to butenes [24,28,29], the main advantage of gold catalysts is their ability to selectively catalyse the hydrogenation of the CO group of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes producing allyl-type unsaturated alcohols [30–43]. In this field, attempts of our group to identify the active sites of supported gold catalysts, favoring the adsorption and hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, were successful and the influence of the real structure of the catalyst on the hydrogenation properties was estimated. Both approaches are highlighted in the next section."
3,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes over supported gold catalysts","The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols is of both commercial relevance (e.g. in fine chemical and pharmaceutical intermediate production [64]) and specific scientific interest [65]. Note that thermodynamics favors hydrogenation of the CC over the CO group (stronger negative free reaction enthalpy of 35kJmol−1), and for kinetic reasons the CC bond is more reactive than the CO group. Thus, in the presence of most of conventional monometallic hydrogenation catalysts, based on Pt, Rh or Pd on silica and alumina as supports, lower α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein and crotonaldehyde are hydrogenated predominantly to the saturated aldehydes, and only to a minor extent to unsaturated alcohols [65–67]. Therefore, it is desirable to find catalysts, which are able to control the intramolecular selectivity by hydrogenating preferentially the CO group, while keeping the olefinic double bond intact. In our group, the hydrogenation of acrolein (Fig. 1 ) on supported gold catalysts has been used as test reaction to study several aspects of structure sensitivity, i.e., a dependence of activity and selectivity on the size and morphology of gold particles [30–36]. Because of the lack of space-filling substituents (e.g. methyl, phenyl) at the CC group acrolein is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is most difficult to hydrogenate to the unsaturated alcohol (allyl alcohol). The latter must be the criterion for the evaluation of the unusual properties of gold as hydrogenation catalyst. Moreover, from an industrial point of view allyl alcohol is much more important for the chemical industry (e.g. used for glycerol synthesis, allyl ester, epoxidation [64]) than, for example, crotyl alcohol which can be obtained by selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over supported gold catalysts [38–41]. However, it must be kept in mind that in the case of crotonaldehyde (or higher α,β-unsaturated aldehydes), the selectivities reported do not represent the intrinsic selectivity of gold because a methyl (or phenyl) group as substituent on the CC double bond contributes to the overall selectivity by steric repulsion of the olefinic group changing the adsorption configuration of the aldehyde as shown by a number of experimental data and theoretical calculations [65–69]. This is obvious from Table 2 where the hydrogenation of acrolein and crotonaldehyde over a Au/SiO2 catalyst (d Au =3.9±2.3nm, prepared by incipient wetness [30,31]) are compared. Also, in the case of Au/TiO2 catalysts prepared by deposition–precipitation methods the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol was decreased from a level of 60–70% when using crotonaldehyde [38] to 30% in the case of acrolein [70]. Beside gold on oxide supports, also silver catalysts, are the only candidates, which convert acrolein to allyl alcohol with selectivities one order of magnitude higher than Group VIII hydrogenation catalysts [71,72]. It is interesting to note that the adsorption of acrolein on both metals (polycrystalline gold, Au (111), evaporated silver films) was studied by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) showing a coverage-dependent discrete adsorption geometry [73,74]. It can be concluded that the adsorbate interacts with the metal surface through the oxygen atom of the CO group coordinated to a positively charged surface site (kinks, steps). However, it has not yet been possible to identify the catalytic phenomena in hydrogenation reactions associated with the size and the morphology of supported gold particles. Therefore, extensive reaction studies coupled with in-depth catalyst characterization were undertaken by our group to focus on the problem of structure-sensitivity and gaining more knowledge of how the unique catalytic behavior of gold can be controlled by the nanostructure of the catalyst [32,34–36]. Beside a dependence of the size of the gold particles on the kind of support, the latter has an influence on the degree of rounding of the particles. Fig. 2 shows representative gold particles of nearly the same sizes on different supports (SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, ZnO) after a pretreatment in hydrogen at 573K. On SiO2 and TiO2, the particles are nearly spherical, whereas on the other supports extended facets of the gold surface are visible, in particular for Au/ZnO [36]. Structure-sensitivity may have its core in the ability of nanostructured matter to occur in metastable non-equilibrium structures, for example as coordinatively unsaturated sites (e.g. edges, kinks) induced by rough surfaces, as matter with lattice strain or multiple-twinned particles (MTPs) [75]. The question arises how the hydrogenation properties of gold catalysts are influenced by these nanoscale properties of gold. To answer this question, we focussed our work at first on the influence of the geometrical configuration of the supported gold nanoparticles, namely the occurrence of MTPs and the degree of rounding exhibiting the real structure (Fig. 3 ). Significant differences between the Au/ZrO2 samples prepared by deposition–precipitation at different pH values were found. By correlating the HRTEM and catalytic results, it was shown that higher amount of MTPs resulted in a lowering of selectivity to the desired product allyl alcohol (Table 3 ), and also the turnover frequency (TOF) was decreased [34]. Therefore, the main demand for the catalyst synthesis is that supported gold catalysts with single crystalline gold particles must be prepared to obtain higher selectivities to the unsaturated alcohol. The increase of TOF for Au/TiO2 compared to Au/ZrO2 is attributed to more rounded gold particles, accompanied by a higher relative amount of low-coordinated surface sites [34]. After the finding that the hydrogenation of acrolein preferentially occurs on single crystalline particles rather than on multiply twinned ones, in the next step of our investigation a new approach was applied to distinguish different features of the gold particle morphology. By means of HRTEM, the crystal structure of individual gold particles prepared on ZnO (S BET =15m2 g−1) was investigated [35]. Most particles (d Au =9.0±0.3nm) were single crystalline and practically no MTPs were found. This is an important result because elucidation of the active site issue cannot be simply done by varying the size of gold particles, since the effects of faceting and multiply twinned particles may interfere in other supported gold nanoparticle systems. In the next step, modification of the gold particle surface by indium has been used to vary the active site characteristics of a suitable catalyst. By detailed HRTEM image analysis, the lattice spacings of these bimetallic Au–In particles perpendicular to the outer surface were measured. Since there were distinct contrast differences between both metals due to the atomic number difference, it was possible to distinguish for each atomic layer between both In- and Au-containing phases. There is clear evidence of the formation of a separate indium phase exhibiting a lattice distance close to the (101) distance of tetragonal indium. Furthermore, HRTEM imaging revealed clearly a selective decoration of gold particle faces has been observed, leaving edges free (Fig. 4 ). Statistical evaluation of appearance of indium on the cubooctahedral gold surfaces was undertaken which supports the selective face decoration by the second metal. EDX analysis revealed a homogeneous distribution of indium on the gold particles and no monometallic indium deposits on the support were found. With the bimetallic Au–In/ZnO catalyst, the desired allyl alcohol is the main product formed with a selectivity of 63% (at T =593K and p total =2MPa). Note that the Au–In system is the first example showing the important impact of a second metal for tuning the selectivity of a gold catalyst in selective hydrogenation of functional groups. The level of selectivity obtained with Au–In/ZnO is one order of magnitude higher compared with conventional mono- and bimetallic catalysts for acrolein hydrogenation [65,66] and comparable to our best catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of acrolein to allyl alcohol, Ag–In/SiO2 [76,77]. From the experimentally proven correlation between surface structure and catalytic behavior, the edges of single crystalline gold particles (“edgy catalyst” [78]) have been identified as active sites for the preferred CO hydrogenation [35]. A further example for the importance of gold as hydrogenation catalyst was illustrated by comparing gold with platinum, both supported on zirconia, in acrolein hydrogenation [30,31]. Preliminary hydrogenation experiments showed that over Pt/ZrO2 the selectivity to allyl alcohol was always very low (ca. 2%). In order to ensure that this was not due to the high catalyst activity (acrolein conversion of 43% at 473K) and the related secondary reactions of allyl alcohol according to Fig. 1, the modified space time ( W / F Ac 0 ) was varied in such a way that a comparison of selectivities for the catalysts Au/ZrO2 and Pt/ZrO2 was possible with almost the same acrolein conversion. Even under these experimental conditions, propanal was the main product with Pt (S >90%). Selectivity to allyl alcohol was only 3.9%, i.e., only one-tenth of the selectivity obtained with Au/ZrO2. This finding clearly indicates that gold catalysts are more efficient than platinum catalysts in acrolein hydrogenation. If the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde as educt is changed from acrolein to, for example, crotonaldehyde, then monometallic Pt catalysts (e.g. Pt/ZnO [79]) can also exhibit high selectivity towards the allylic alcohol. However, in that case, as noted above, the increased selectivity is due to the additional steric effect of the methyl group and cannot be ascribed to the catalyst properties alone."
4,Conclusions,"In reactions exhibiting a selectivity problem, e.g. hydrogenation of two CC bonds or CC versus CO groups, the advantage of gold catalysts is the preferred hydrogenation of one of these groups leading to monoenes (also by selective CC hydrogenation), unsaturated alcohols and unsaturated ketones as reaction products important to the chemical industry. In-depth characterization of gold hydrogenation catalysts clearly shows that elucidation of the active site issue and the observed structure-sensitivity cannot be simply undertaken by varying the size of gold particles because the latter may interfere with the portion of multiply twinned particles (MTPs) and the degree of particle rounding. Because a large portion of MTPs gave low allyl alcohol selectivity (product of CO group hydrogenation) in acrolein hydrogenation, catalysts with single crystalline gold particles must be prepared by appropriate synthesis methods. However, what are the preparative factors, which control the ratio between gold surface atoms on edges and corners versus those on flat surfaces or the portion of MTPs? The important impact of an appropriate pretreatment in H2 controlling the surface structure, and thus, the catalytic properties was shown by the drastic influence of the prolonged reduction time (Table 3) which favors the formation of multiple-twinned gold particles non-selective for CO group hydrogenation [34]. This approach shows that in the case of hydrogenations over gold catalysts, the mechanism of catalysis are more complicated than assuming a simple geometric model (gold particle size) or perimeter-interface model, which is suggested to be the active site in CO oxidation [6]. The modification of gold particles by a second metal (indium) was not only a suitable tool to increase the intramolecular selectivity, but was also essential to identify the active sites for this hydrogenation reaction. No direct evidence has yet been demonstrated whether hydrogen is dissociatively or molecular adsorbed, whether subsurface hydrogen (in analogy to subsurface oxygen in oxidation catalysis) plays a role as indicated at higher coverages [13], and thus, what the active sites for hydrogen activation are. On carbon (type: Black Pearls, Cabot GmbH) supported gold nanoparticles (d Au =3.7±1.4nm), the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen was definitively zero [80]. At present, experimental results indicate, as shown in Section 2, that H2 chemisorption occurs only on Au surface atoms of coordinatively unsaturated sites. Since the adsorption capability of hydrogen on (clean) gold surfaces is limited, the application of hydrogen chemisorption measurements is difficult on gold catalysts, and thus, remains an advanced task. Furthermore, it has to be considered that also surface strain that can be induced in small, thin gold particles by supports [81] may be responsible for the activation of hydrogen and the hydrogenation properties of supported gold catalysts. In the case of oxygen adsorption and activation on gold nanoparticles, their greater reactivity was attributed to a higher step density and a greater amount of surface strain [82]. These factors have to be elucidated in the future with the help of gold model catalysts, in situ techniques (e.g. XAS, XPS [83]) and theory, giving rise to a deeper insight into kinetics and mechanism of gold-catalysed hydrogenations as a key toward future applications."
