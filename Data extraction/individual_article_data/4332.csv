0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising energy carriers because it is energetically dense, clean-burning and is sustainable since it can be produced from renewable sources. Among the various kinds of H2-producing biotechnology, dark fermentation using anaerobic microbial communities is particularly attractive for its ability to produce H2 at high rates and at a low cost from complex and unsterilized substrates such as solid waste-derived carbon sources [1–3]. Despite significant advances in research on dark fermentation, its commercial development has been substantially limited by certain major challenges. These include the use of renewable sources for H2 production, i.e. from pretreated biomass, and the improvement of H2 production yields through the development of optimal control of mixed-culture fermentation [4–6]. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable resource worldwide representing an attractive, low-cost feedstock for H2 production. Lignocellulosic biomass contains variable amounts of cellulose (a glucose polymer), hemicellulose (a hexose/pentose heteropolymer with xylose as the major constituent) and lignin (an aromatic organic polymer intertwined amongst cellulosic and hemicellulosic compounds). Recently, H2 production by dark fermentation from lignocellulosic residues has been shown in mesophilic and thermophilic mixed cultures [6–11]. Due to the complex structure of lignocellulosic materials, pretreatment processes are nevertheless required prior to dark fermentation. Such processes make the main constituents, cellulose and hemicellulose, more accessible to the enzymes that convert carbohydrate polymers into monosaccharides such as glucose or xylose [8,12,13]. The pretreatment methods used to improve dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass are classified into four groups: physical (e.g. mechanical disruption), chemical (e.g. alkali, dilute acid), thermal (e.g. steam explosion) and biological (e.g. lignin degradation by white rot fungi) [8,9,13,14]. The existing pretreatment processes for lignocellulosic biomass have a major drawback: the lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts, other than monosaccharides, which reduce the fermentability of the hydrolyzates obtained. Indeed, a broad range of compounds generated during hydrolysis has been previously identified as inhibitors of microbial growth as well as their metabolism, i.e. ethanol fermentation [15–18]. Three groups of inhibitors have been distinguished: organic acids such as acetate generated from hemicellulose degradation; furan derivatives from sugar degradation such as furfural or 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF); and phenolic monomers such as vanillin or syringaldehyde derived from lignin microbial alteration [6,15,19]. These inhibitors can affect microbial growth with three distinct modes of action: undissociated weak organic acids penetrate microbial cells and decrease the intracellular pH, furfural derivatives interfere with glycotic and/or fermentative enzymes, while macromolecules and phenolic compounds are damaging the microbial cellular membranes [15,19]. Clostridial species are generally found as the most abundant bacterial genus in H2-producing mixed cultures [5,20–22]. In fact, the common use of heat-shock pretreatment of the inoculum leads not only to the removal of H2-consumers, i.e. methanogens, but also to the selection of sporulating anaerobic H2-producing bacteria, particularly Clostridium spp. Clostridial species are metabolically versatile and degrade a wide range of organic materials including carbohydrates, organic acids, alcohols and aromatic compounds [23]. In contrast to ethanologenic microorganisms (e.g. Saccharomyces spp.), carboxylic acids such as acetate have not been reported to significantly inhibit the growth of clostridial species and/or H2 production [24,25]. To date, the impact of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds on mixed-culture fermentative H2 production has not been investigated. Inhibitory concentrations are quite specific to each microorganism, but, generally, 1gL−1 can be considered as the concentration at which a significant impact can be observed on the growth of different types of microorganisms (i.e. yeast or bacteria) and on their H2 or ethanol production [16,17,25]. Moreover, a concentration of 1gL−1 corresponds to an intermediate concentration found in hydrolyzates generated from lignocellulosic biomass after standard pretreatment using dilute sulfuric acid and at high temperature. Furfural and HMF, for instance, have been retrieved at concentrations less than or equal to 0.1gL−1 for wheat straw [26], about 1gL−1 for corn stalks or cobs [26] or greater than 2gL−1 for softwood [27,28]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on the performance of fermentative H2 production processes of seven different molecules: furan derivatives (i.e. furfural and HMF), phenolic compounds (i.e. phenol, syringaldehyde and vanillin) and lignins (i.e. kraft and organosolv lignins), presenting different molecular weights at a common concentration of 1gL−1. The metabolic routes and the bacterial communities involved were also assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen production in batch tests,"2.1 Hydrogen production in batch tests The H2 production experiments were carried out in 500mL glass bottles under batch conditions. An anaerobically digested sludge pretreated by heat shock (90°C, 10min) was used as inoculum. Two milliliters of this inoculum (final concentration of 250mg-CODL−1) were inoculated into the culture media (final working volume of 200mL) containing 40mM of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, 5gL−1 of xylose and/or 1gL−1 of the following individual lignocellulose-derived compounds (Table 1 ): furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), vanillin, syringaldehyde, phenol, kraft lignin, organosolv lignin. The initial pH was adjusted to 5.5 using NaOH (1M). All batch tests were performed in triplicate. After inoculation, each bottle was flushed with nitrogen for 5min to create anaerobic conditions. The bottles were then capped with a rubber stopper and incubated at 37°C for 50 days. Two milliliters of the mixed cultures were periodically collected and then centrifuged (20,000g, 10min). The supernatants and the pellets were stored at −20°C, the supernatants for further chemical analysis and the pellets for DNA extraction."
3,"Chemical data analysis (biogas, metabolic byproducts)","2.2 Chemical data analysis (biogas, metabolic byproducts) Biogas volume was periodically measured using an acidified water displacement method. Biogas composition (CH4, CO2, H2 and N2) was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Clarus 280, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a HayeSep Q column and a molecular sieve. Operating conditions were as follows: the carrier gas was argon at a pressure of 102kPa and a flow rate of 4.5mLmin−1; temperature of the injector and the detector was fixed at 150°C. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) composition in the liquid phase, i.e. acetic (C2), propionic (C3), butyric and iso-butyric (C4 and iC4), valeric and iso-valeric (C5 and iC5) and caproic (C6) acids were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC-3900, Varian) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The concentrations of xylose and non-VFA metabolic byproducts such as organic acids (lactate), ethanol or acetone were measured by HPLC analysis and refractometric detection (Waters R410). The components were separated in an Aminex HPX-87H, 300×7.8mm column (Biorad). The eluant corresponded to 0.005M H2SO4. The column temperature was maintained at 35°C and the flow rate at 0.4mL.min−1. To determine H2 production parameters after the addition of lignocellulose-derived compounds (Table 1), the cumulative H2 production (H) data for each inhibitor was fitted to a modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)), as previously described by Quéméneur et al. [22]. (1) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where P is the maximum cumulative H2 production (mLH2 L−1), R m is the maximum H2 production rate (mLH2 L−1 day−1), λ is the lag-phase time (day), t is the incubation time (day) and e is exp(1). The cumulative H2 production was expressed in mL per L of culture taking into account the variations in volume due to gas and liquid sampling. The values of P, R m and λ were estimated using a non-linear regression algorithm developed with Matlab software (version 6.5, MathWorks®). The H2 production yield was calculated by dividing the maximum H2 production (P) by the molar amount of xylose consumed."
4,DNA extraction and PCR amplification,"2.3 DNA extraction and PCR amplification For each experiment, molecular analyses of the bacterial communities were carried out at the maximum H2 production time (P). Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from cell pellets (1ml of culture) using the Qiagen DNA stool mini kit. The amount and purity of DNA in the extracts were measured by spectrophotometry (Infinite NanoQuant M200, Tecan). The 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the universal primers W49 (5′-ACGGTCCAGACTCCTACGGG-3′, Escherichia coli position F331) [29] and 5′-fluorescein phosphoramidite-labeled W104 (5′-TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′, E. coli position R533) [29]. Each PCR mixture (50μL) contained 1× Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase buffer, 200μM of each dNTP, 130ng of each primer, 0.5U of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 5ng of genomic DNA. Reactions were done in a Mastercycler thermal cycler (Eppendorf). The 16S rRNA genes were amplified as follows: 94°C for 2min, followed by 25 cycles performed at 94°C for 30s, 61°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10min. The Clostridium genus was specifically analyzed by nested PCR using a bacterial-domain forward primer W18 (5′-GAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′, E. coli position F9) [30] and a Clostridium-specific reverse primer W109 (5′-CCCTTTACACCCAGTAA-3′, E. coli position R561) [31]. For cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA genes from the control culture, fragments of about 500bp were amplified using forward primer W18 and reverse primer W31 (5′-TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′, E. coli position R500), as described above, except that primer hybridization at 50°C and an extension time of 1min were applied. The size of PCR products was determined by 2% gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide."
5,CE-SSCP electrophoresis and statistical analysis,"2.4 CE-SSCP electrophoresis and statistical analysis One microliter of the appropriate dilution of PCR products was mixed with 18.8μL of formamide and 0.2μL of internal standard GeneScan ROX (Applied Biosystems). Samples were heat-denatured at 95°C for 5min and immediately re-cooled in ice. CE-SSCP electrophoresis was performed in an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with 50cm-long capillary tubes filled with a non-denaturing 5.6% conformation analysis polymer (Applied Biosystems). Samples were eluted at 12kV and 32°C for either 30min (for 16S rRNA gene) or 45min (for hydA gene). The CE-SSCP profiles were aligned with the internal standard to take into account inter-sample electrophoretic variability. The CE-SSCP profiles were normalized using the StatFingerprints library [32] from R version 2.9.2 [33] in accordance with standard procedure [34]. The genetic distances between bacterial communities were assessed using Euclidean distances. The effect of the inhibitors on the structure of bacterial communities was investigated with a multivariate analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) [35] and genetic distances between samples were displayed using principal component analysis (PCA). ANOSIM gave a statistic R, ranging from 0 (dissimilar groups) to 1 (similar groups). The linear correlation between the PCA ordination of the bacterial communities and key environmental parameters was investigated using the envfit and ordisurf functions of the vegan library [36]. The statistical significances were tested by Monte Carlo randomization."
6,Assignation of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences in mixed cultures,"2.5 Assignation of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences in mixed cultures The PCR products obtained from the control mixed cultures were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The PCR-CE-SSCP profile of the PCR product of each clone, after amplification with plasmid-targeted primers T7 and P13, was compared with the mixed-culture profiles for peak assignation. The cloned inserts were then sent for sequencing (MilleGen Company, Toulouse, France). To determine the identity percentage, the 16S rRNA sequences of the clones were aligned with reference sequences retrieved from the Genbank database using the CLUSTALW program [37] and further refined manually using the BioEdit program [38]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were deposited in the Genbank database under the accession numbers JN116427–JN116431."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of inhibitor type on overall hydrogen production performance,"3.1 Effect of inhibitor type on overall hydrogen production performance Throughout the batch experiments, only H2 and CO2 were observed as gaseous products. No CH4 was detected in the gas phase, indicating that the methanogenic activity was efficiently suppressed after heat-shock treatment of the inoculum. No gas was produced from the inhibitor compounds when added as sole carbon source (without xylose) at a concentration of 1gL−1. In the control cultures, H2 production started after 3.2 (±1.3) days and went on increasing for 50 days, attaining an H2 yield of 1.67 (±0.10)molH2 molxylose −1 (Table 2 ). This H2 yield was consistent with previously reported yields obtained from xylose with mesophilic or thermophilic fermentative mixed cultures [39–41]. Whatever the lignocellulose-derived compounds added, a significant inhibition of H2 production performances was observed in terms of lag phase, H2 yield and maximum H2 production. These results suggest that different inhibitory effects occurred according to the nature of the compounds: furan derivatives, phenolic compounds or lignins (Table 2). The addition of furan derivatives (furfural and HMF) led to the highest inhibition of H2 production, with a dramatic drop in H2 yields which decreased to 0.45 (±0.10)molH2 molxylose −1 (Fig. 1 ). Furan derivatives have been previously reported to disturb the membrane integrity of diverse microorganisms [19]. Nevertheless, both furfural and HMF (at 1gL−1) have been reported to stimulate the growth of Clostridium beijerinckii BA101 as well as the production of acetone–butanol–ethanol through non-H2-producing pathways [24]. Despite having different characteristics (e.g. molecular mass), no significant difference was found between the H2 yield and maximum production for the cultures with furan derivatives added. Nonetheless, the lag phase in furfural-added cultures was twice as long as in HMF-added cultures: respectively, 18.5 and 9.9 days. This result can be explained by the lower molecular weight of furfural compared to HMF (Table 1). Indeed, the diffusion rate into the cell should be higher for furfural than HMF which may explain the longer time needed for microbial acclimation to furfural. In previous inhibition studies, furfural has been identified as being a more efficient inhibitor than HMF of the growth of ethanol-producing yeasts [17]. In contrast, Cao et al. [25] reported a higher decrease in H2 yield of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 with HMF (50.2%) than with furfural (17.9%) at an initial concentration of 1gL−1. The addition of phenolic compounds (phenol, syringaldehyde and vanillin) clearly had less impact on the H2 yields than the furan derivatives (1.33 vs. 0.45molH2 molxylose −1, respectively) (Fig. 1). The highest H2 production (1045±26.6mLL−1) and the shortest lag-phase time (8.1±2.6 days) were observed with syringaldehyde (Table 2). In contrast, the longest lag-phase time (22.2±1.2 days) was observed when phenol was added. As found in the cultures with furan derivatives added, these differences in lag phase could be explained by the intrinsic ability of these compounds to penetrate cell membranes: the higher the molecular mass, the slower was the introduction into a cell and the shorter the lag phase. After this acclimation period, which varied depending upon the type of phenolic compound (phenol, syringaldehyde and vanillin), no significant difference in H2 yield was observed between the assays (Fig. 1). Phenolic compounds are widely known to be toxic to microbial cells because they increase membrane fluidity, which affects membrane permeability, and, consequently, induce a longer acclimation of mixed cultures [15,19]. Our results were in agreement with the findings of Tai et al. [42] who observed significant inhibition of cell metabolism of Clostridium butyricum at phenol concentrations higher than 1gL−1. In addition, no co-degradation phenomenon was detected with C. butyricum in pure cultures at phenol concentrations higher than 0.6gL−1 [42], as also shown in our study. Ezeji et al. [24] reported a higher inhibition of C. beijerinckii cell growth by phenol than by syringaldehyde (at a concentration of 1gL−1). Contrary to our findings, Cao et al. [25] showed that vanillin at a concentration ranging between 0 and 2gL−1 caused no severe inhibition of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 for H2 production. In the case of an increase of syringaldehyde at 1gL−1, the same authors indicated a reduction of H2 production of 54.3% compared to 23.1% for our mixed cultures. This result indicated that our mixed-culture inoculum had a higher tolerance to syringaldehyde. Lignins largely contributed to the decrease in H2 production and yield, which can be explained by their physicochemical properties, e.g. hydrophobicity, ramification, and methoxylation. Indeed, lignins can form lignin–carbohydrate complexes with xylose and, thus, contribute to decreasing substrate availability in the medium. The differences in H2 yield between the lignins tested could be explained by different sorption capacity or different release of phenolic compounds due to partial lignin microbial alteration. Contrary to furan derivatives and phenol compounds, lignins only slightly affected the lag phase (Table 2). Lignin is a complex chemical compound with a high molecular weight. Consequently, this result is consistent with those obtained with furan derivatives and phenol compounds, i.e. the lag phase decreased with increasing molecular weight. All these results together establish a linear negative correlation between the lag phase and the monomer molecular mass of each inhibitor (Pearson’s product–moment correlation r =−0.852, p <0.001) (Fig. 2 ). For lignin-added cultures, the molecular weight considered was the weight of the monomer, suggesting that the inhibitory impact was due to monomers that can be released and not to polymers."
9,Effect of the type of inhibitor on the fermentative routes,"3.2 Effect of the type of inhibitor on the fermentative routes Fig. 3 shows the distributions of soluble metabolites concomitant to H2 production in mixed cultures. In the control, the major VFAs were acetate (33.3%), butyrate (49.7%), caproate (6.0%), propionate (10.5%) and valerate (0.5%), with butyrate as the main component. Similar distribution of metabolic products was detected in anaerobic mixed cultures, dominated by clostridial species, with xylose at 20gL−1 as sole carbon source [43]. In the cultures supplemented with furan derivatives, metabolite distribution was similar to that of the control cultures. Indeed, a similar butyrate/acetate ratio was found compared to the control cultures (on average 1.35 vs. 1.49, respectively) (Table 2). However, the addition of furan derivatives led to the highest valerate levels (Fig. 3). Valerate might be formed through metabolic pathways requiring H2 as electron donor and with the consumption of propionate and CO2, in accordance with the lower H2 yields observed [44]. In the cultures supplemented with phenolic compounds, significant differences in metabolic patterns were observed with all three compounds: phenol, vanillin and syringaldehyde (Fig. 3). Among them, the least efficient phenol culture was characterized by the highest butyrate/acetate ratio (Table 2), which was related to the lowest acetate levels. This result suggests that phenolic compounds interfered differently with the bacterial community structure (Fig. 4 ) and/or with the activities of key enzymes involved in acetate and butyrate formation. In the cultures supplemented with lignin, the decrease in butyrate content was associated with the lowest butyrate/acetate ratio and was concomitant with the formation of caproate. Consequently, among the various possible metabolic pathways, caproate was most likely produced directly from butyrate, H2 and CO2 [45]. An increase in caproate content with substantial H2 consumption was also reported in a previous study performed with disaccharides in batch cultures [22]. Interestingly, the low H2 production occurring in these cultures was concomitant with the highest propionate levels (Fig. 3). Propionate production is known to have a negative effect on the efficiency of H2 production. Cheng et al. [46] reported a negative correlation between propionate and H2 yield in starch-fed mixed cultures. Zhang et al. [47] observed that an increase of the H2 yield was concomitant with a decrease in propionate production. Whatever the mixed culture, the detection of high levels of acetate and butyrate suggested that H2 was produced during acetate–butyrate fermentation. The butyrate/acetate ratio can be used as an indicator for monitoring H2 production in dark fermentation process [46,48]. However, during our experiments, no correlation was observed between H2 production yield and the molar acetate/butyrate ratios (Pearson’s r =0.467, p >0.05) (Table 2). Nevertheless, a positive correlation was observed between the H2 and butyrate production (Pearson’s r =0.838, p <0.001), indicating that the butyrate content was directly linked to H2 production, whereas acetate content resulted not only from the acetate pathway but also from the homoacetogenesis (recombination of H2 and CO2) occurring in mixed cultures [49]."
10,Effect of the type of inhibitor on bacterial communities,"3.3 Effect of the type of inhibitor on bacterial communities Fig. 4 presents the averaged 16S rRNA gene-based CE-SSCP fingerprinting profiles of the mixed cultures according to the presence of different inhibitors and obtained at the maximum H2 production time. The addition of an inhibitor had a significant effect on the bacterial community structures (ANOSIM R =0.51, p <0.005). The differences in CE-SSCP profiles were mostly related to the variation in the abundance ratio between clostridial and non-clostridial species (represented in the left-hand and right-hand part of the CE-SSCP, respectively). Nevertheless, clostridial species always remained the dominant bacteria in all of the samples analyzed. On average, the clostridial species represented 70.7% of the bacterial community compared to only 29.2% for non-clostridial species (Fig. 4). Cultures with phenol added, which presented the longest lag phase, were characterized by the highest proportion of clostridial species (85.8%), mainly represented by Clostridium beijerinkii. In contrast, cultures with lignin added showed the lowest proportion of clostridial species (58.1%) associated with the shortest lag phase. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compare the genetic distance of the species found in the mixed cultures at the time of maximum H2 production according to the experimental conditions [20–22] (Fig. 5A). The PCA showed no clustering of samples according to the type of inhibitor (while remaining significant, p <0.001). Interestingly, changes in the lag-phase (p <0.001) and in the maximal H2 production (p <0.025) were significantly correlated with the genetic distance between samples (Fig. 5A). This result indicates that the genetic differences between the bacterial populations were linked to the metabolic activity. Fig. 5B highlighted the covariation of the lag phase (larger rings corresponded to samples with larger values) and the genetic distance (according to the physical distance between samples on the biplot). Interestingly, such linear covariation is consistent with the linear negative correlation observed between the lag phase and the monomer molecular mass of inhibitors (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the initial impact of inhibitors on bacterial cells is predominant in the selection of microorganisms. Whatever the inhibitor tested, the CE-SSCP profiles were dominated by C. beijerinkii (peak 1), known to be an efficient H2 producer [50, 51]. This species was less sensitive to inhibitors than other clostridial and non-clostridial bacteria in our study. This result is consistent with that from Ezeji et al. [24] who reported high resistance of C. beijerinkii to furan derivatives and phenolic compounds in pure cultures. Here, similar results were obtained in mixed culture with other species in competition, suggesting C. beijerinkii as an ideal candidate for H2 production from hydrolyzates of lignocellulosic biomass. The bacterial community of the control cultures was dominated by three clostridial species: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinkii and Clostridium cellulosi (Fig. 4). Changes in the bacterial community due to the addition of an inhibitor was associated with the decrease in the relative abundance of the clostridial species represented by peaks 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 4). Such species were likely to have been the support of H2 production from xylose. Indeed, C. acetobutylicum (peak 2) and C. pasteurianum (peak 4) are known as highly efficient H2 producers [52,53]. Consequently, the decrease in their relative abundance in mixed cultures would directly affect H2 production. Recently, C. cellulosi (peak 3) has been reported as potentially favoring H2 production by breaking down complex organic compounds [54]. But C. cellulosi is a non-H2-producer and should therefore be considered as a substrate competitor. In lignin-added cultures, C. cellulosi could also be potentially involved in the partial breaking down of lignin which might give rise to phenolic compounds (e.g. syringaldehyde, vanillin) and thus decreased the H2 yield, as previously suggested. Interestingly, the same dominant H2-producing clostridial species were found in both the control cultures and those supplemented with organosolv lignin, suggesting that non-clostridial species (shown in the right-hand part of the CE-SSCP profiles) negatively affected the H2 production by direct and/or indirect interaction: substrate competition, inhibitor excretion and/or H2 consumption. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as Sporolactobacillus spp. (peak 5), have been reported to decrease H2 content in mixed cultures due to their inhibitory effect caused by excreted bacteriocins which have an adverse effect on H2-producing bacteria [54,55]. Lactate formation is also known to be unfavorable to H2 production [3]. However, no lactate was detected in our cultures. Since propionate accumulated, other bacterial species such as Clostridium spp. (e.g. Clostridium novyi, Clostridium propionicum) or Propionibacterium spp., which could have coexisted with LAB in our mixed cultures, might have converted lactate to propionate [56] and thus contributed to reducing the H2 yield. Finally, the composition of the bacterial communities examined in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies carried out in dark fermentation systems [20–22,40,46,53,57]. For example, Fang et al. [57] showed that 69.1% of the clones were affiliated to four clostridial species and 13.5% were affiliated to Sporolactobacillus racemicus in the granular sludge of a H2-producing bioreactor using sucrose as substrate. In addition, clostridial species have been reported to be responsible for H2 production via the acetate/butyrate-type fermentation [20–22]. Other fermentative pathways (e.g. propionate, lactate or caproate fermentations) which reduce the H2 yield can be carried out either by clostridia themselves or by other non-clostridial species competing in mixed cultures. Nevertheless, further research is still required to determine the exact role of non-dominant and non-clostridial species in the improvement or the alteration of H2 production performances in such fermentative mixed cultures [53,54]."
11,Conclusions,"The results of this study reveal that lignocellulose-derived compounds, i.e. furan derivatives, phenol compounds or lignins, inhibit the H2 production performance of mixed cultures. All the compounds tested were unable to support fermentative H2 production by mixed cultures in the absence of an additional carbon source. Among the inhibitors tested, phenol compounds were found to have less impact on H2 production from xylose. Strong inhibition of H2 production was observed in the presence of furan derivatives and lignins. A negative correlation was observed between the lag phase and the molecular weight of the inhibitors. Although the major VFAs in the soluble fraction were acetate and butyrate, significant changes in metabolic profiles were observed, depending on the inhibitor. Based on 16S rDNA analysis, clostridial species were found to be the dominant species in the mixed cultures whatever the inhibitor supplemented. C. beijerinkii was found to be more resistant to inhibitors, making it the ideal candidate for H2 production from hydrolyzates from lignocellulosic biomass. However, the relative abundance of some efficient H2-producers such as C. acetobutylicum and C. pasteurianum was dramatically affected by the addition of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds. To conclude, our results indicate that fermentative H2 production by mixed cultures is significantly inhibited by lignocellulose-derived compounds. At all events, the efficiency of fermentative H2-producing bioprocesses will also remain dependant on the efficacy of delignification and depolymerization processes in reducing the levels of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds."
