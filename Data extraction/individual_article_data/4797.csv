0,Introduction,"There are many volatile compounds in human breath that can be used to detect compounds present in the blood which are related to the health of the subject [1–3]. Breath sampling is a very appealing method because it is non-invasive and it can be completed rapidly with high accuracy. One of the most well-known applications of breath sampling is the breath alcohol sensing devices used for the determination of sobriety/inebriation, commonly referred to as a breathalyzer [3–9]. In these devices, the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) in a subject’s exhaled breath is determined and can be related to the ethanol concentration in blood, through the known volume ratio of 1:2100 [10]. The fuel cell-based breath alcohol sensor (BrAS) is the most commonly employed portable device. However, there are many other types of sensors systems, including solid-state sensing [3,6], infrared spectrometry [6,11], biosensors [6,12], gas chromatography [6,13], multi-sensor array (semiconductors and infrared devices) [14–18] and colorimetry [19] can be also used to measure BrAC. However, many of these devices are less portable and/or more expensive than the cell-based BrAS. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle when a subject has a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above a critical value. For example, the Criminal Code of Canada (Section 235) states that it is a criminal offence to operate a vehicle with a BAC greater than 0.08 g/dL, which is equivalent to 80 mg of ethanol per 100 mL of blood [4]. Most jurisdictions within Canada also forbid driving at lower BAC (e.g. 0.05 g/dL), and many new drivers are not permitted any alcohol in their system at all. To enforce these laws, law enforcement agencies typically employ a fuel cell-based BrAS for road side screening. Fuel cell-based BrAS detects ethanol electrochemically. The cell is essentially a modified version of a direct ethanol fuel cell, where a fixed volume of breath is injected into the anode compartment of the cell. If ethanol is present, it will be oxidized with a corresponding reduction of oxygen (from air) occurring at the cathode. The current or charge produced is directly proportional to the BrAC enabling the determination of BAC. The cell design employs a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabricated from a porous polyvinyl chloride membrane that is filled with H2SO4 (aq) [20,21] and two electrodes. Each electrode contains a large amounts of Pt black catalyst (7–14 mg/cm2) held together with a Teflon binder. Studies in our group have indicated that the Pt utilization is very low in the commercial sensors [4,7]. The sensor MEAs share many of the same basic characteristics of MEA used for power generation. Innovation in the power-generating fuel cell industry over the last couple of decades has resulted in a substantial decrease in required Pt loadings without sacrificing performance. For example, numerous studies have shown that Pt loading can be extremely reduced to ∼ 0.5 mg/cm2 or less with using carbon supported Pt nanoparticles [22–33]. Furthermore, Pt-alloy catalysts such those made with Ru, Sn, Mo, Mn, Cu or Ni [25,31–42] have been shown to have enhanced activity towards both anodic and cathodic fuel cell reaction. Despite these advances in power-generating fuel cell technology, very few of these advances have even been evaluated for BrAS applications. Recently, we have shown that carbon supported Pt electrocatalysts (Pt/C) can be used to replace high loadings of Pt black in commercial BrAS [4]. The BrAS assembled using Pt/C has illustrated raw sensitivity factors similar to the commercial sensor despite using 97% less Pt [4]. Recent work from Modjtahedi et al has found that a linear sensing response can be achieved with as little as 0.03 mg/cm2 of Pt, though a significant reduction in sensitivity factor does occur [30]. Additional studies from our group have shown how refining the MEA composition can influence sensor reliability under dry condition [43,44]. Those studies have demonstrated the viability of adapting power generating fuel cell advances towards ethanol sensing. The next evolution in this would be to employ alloy electrocatalysts to improve the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) kinetics at the anode. Ethanol oxidation can occur via multiple pathways: (1) CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + 2e− + 2H+ (2) CH3CH2OH + H2O → CH3CO2H + 4e− + 4H+ (3) CH3CH2OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 12e− + 12H+ In the case of the ethanol sensor, the first two reactions are believed to be the dominant reactions. These reactions correspond to incomplete oxidation of ethanol. Since the sensor measures current (or charge), increasing the current produced by a fixed amount of ethanol would lead to greater sensitivity. Thus, one would expect that any catalyst that favour the last reaction, one that produces 12 electrons per ethanol molecule, would be more sensitive. However, Pickup’s group has demonstrated that for power generating fuel cells, the maximum CO2 production does not correspond with maximum performance below 100 °C, since that reaction (Eq. (3)) is slower than the 2 or 4 electrode steps (Eqs. (1) and (2)) [45,46]. Pt-Sn has been perhaps the most well studied alloy catalyst for EOR, with the most active phase believed to be Pt3Sn [29,47–50]. Our group has had better success with Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu catalysts for EOR oxidation, demonstrating about 3-times the Pt mass-specific EOR activity of Pt/C [33,39,42,51]. One key advantage of these alloy catalyst is significantly lower Pt-contents in the alloy. This, along with reduced metal loadings has the potential benefit of cost savings in the devices. Furthermore, the co-catalyst may improve the electrode’s tolerance to atmospheric contaminants (e.g. CO). In this paper, we have examined the behavior of BrAS devices constructed using in-house synthesized Pt-Mn/C and Pt-Cu/C alloy catalysts at the anode. We have compared their sensing properties to similar sensors fabricated from commercially available Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C electrocatalysts. These catalysts were selected based on previous demonstration of high EOR activity in liquid phase. Our hypothesis is that EOR activity in the liquid phase will translate to greater sensing of ethanol in the vapour phase. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Pt-alloy catalysts being utilized in a BrAS configuration. The influence of catalyst composition on sensor response and stability was evaluated."
1,Methods and materials,
2,Electrocatalysts,"2.1 Electrocatalysts The synthetic methods used to prepare the carbon supported Pt0.25Mn0.75 and Pt0.25Cu0.75 alloys are described in detail elsewhere, and are briefly described here [33,39,42]. Vulcan XC72R carbon black (Cabot Corp.) was used as the carbon support in all cases. Metal precursors were H2PtCl6.H2O (Aldrich), MnCl2.4H2O (Aldrich), and CuCl2.2H2O (Aldrich). Pt-Mn/C was prepared via an aqueous impregnation method. The required amounts of metal salts and carbon where dispersed in a beaker at room temperature while maintaining a pH of 3. Trisodium citrate (SC) (Aldrich) was added to the solution to control particle size and improve dispersion on the carbon support. NaBH4 was subsequently added and the mixture was left to stir overnight. The resulting powder was filtered and washed with isopropanol alcohol (IPA), acetone, and deionized water, and finally dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Pt-Cu/C was prepared via a microwave assisted polyol method. Each metal precursors and Vulcan carbon were mixed with ethylene glycol (Aldrich) using a mechanical stirrer. The solution pH was adjusted to pH 9, after which it was sonicated for 45 min to achieve a uniform suspension. The suspension was placed into a microwave oven (SANYO - 2450 MHz) and heated for 8 min and then left to cool down under continues mechanical stirring. The final product was collected via suction filtration, and washed with copious amounts of IPA, acetone, and deionized water, and finally dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Both Pt-Mn/C and Pt-Cu/C were heated treated to create catalysts more active towards the EOR. This is primarily due to the formation of more uniform alloys phases at higher temperatures. Each sample was heat treated in quartz tube under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 °C using a Barnstead Thermolyne tube furnace. The period of heat treatment was kept constant (1 h) for all the samples. This heat treatment procedure was determined to be optimal in our previous studies [33,39,42]. After heat treatment, the samples were cooled down under a constant flow of nitrogen gas and were preserved inside the furnace until room temperature was reached. These samples are hereafter referred to as “Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT”. Two carbon support commercial samples with 20 wt% metal loading, Pt/C (Premetek Co.) and Pt3Sn/C (Premetek Co.), were studied and compared to the samples made in-house."
3,Sensor electrodes and MEA fabrication,"2.2 Sensor electrodes and MEA fabrication Fuel cell electrodes were prepared from catalyst inks, which were produced by mixing the appropriate amounts of catalyst powder, 5 wt% Nafion solution (Dupont), water and IPA. The volumetric ratio of water/IPA was 50% and the ratio of solution to catalyst powder for producing ink was kept constant for all samples. The mixture was thoroughly mixed and then sonicated for 45 min. The ink was mechanically stirred overnight to produce a uniform mixture and the ink was further sonicated for 45 min before spray deposited using an airbrush onto carbon paper (Toray TPGH-090, 10% wet-proofing) as a gas diffusion layer. The electrodes were dried for 30 min at room temperature and then at 80 °C overnight. Electrode had a Nafion loading of 30 wt% in all cases. The total metal loading of the catalyst layer was kept similar at ca. 0.4 mg/cm2. MEAs were prepared by hot-pressing (150 kg/cm2 at 130 °C for 120 s) two 4-cm2 electrodes across a Nafion 115 membrane (Ion Power). All MEAs employed a cathode electrode fabricated from 20 wt% Pt/C powder, which had a Pt loading of 0.43 ± 0.05 mg/cm2. MEAs were prepared with anode electrodes fabricated from the various electrocatalysts described above. The total metal loading of anode electrodes was as follows: (a) Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT with 0.41 mg/cm2 (b) Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT with 0.31 mg/cm2 and (c) Pt3Sn/C with 0.33 mg/cm2 metal loading."
4,Three-electrode cell measurements,"2.3 Three-electrode cell measurements All electrochemical measurements were made using a Solartron 1470E multichannel potentiostat coupled to 1260 frequency response analyzer. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using the Multistat software made by Scribner Associates. The electrochemical activity of each catalyst was first assessed in three electrode electrochemical cell was also studied after applying a thin layer of the catalyst on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. The catalyst inks were produced by mixing 10 mg of the catalyst with 100 μL Nafion solution (5 wt% in alcohols, Dupont) and a 400 μL of a 50:50 mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. A uniform suspension was achieved after sonicating for 45 min. A 2 μL droplet of the well-dispersed catalyst ink was deposited onto a clean and polished GC electrode (diam = 3 mm, CH instruments) and dried in the air at room temperature prior to electrochemical tests. The working electrode was placed in a cell containing a solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.1 M ethanol. The cell was also equipped with a Pt wire counter and a double-junction Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This reference electrode as calibrated against the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and all potentials in this work have been corrected to the NHE scale. The solution was sparged with N2 for 10 min to remove any residual oxygen before linear sweep voltammetry measurements were performed."
5,Sensor cell measurements,"2.4 Sensor cell measurements Sensors were evaluated using our custom-built sensor test stand and fuel cell, which is shown in Fig. 1 . The structure and optimization of the sensor prototype, breath simulator, and test stand operation are described in detail elsewhere [4], but will be briefly described here. Each MEA was assembled into a 4 cm2 test cell that has controllable gas ports for both anode and cathode that enables both sensing and electrochemical diagnostic configurations. For sensing measurements, the anode side of the cell was interfaced to the breath simulator system. The cathode side of the cell (always Pt/C) was exposed to ambient air. Tests were made using a fixed resistor load of 200 Ω across the cell with current flow monitored by the potentiostat. The temperature of the aqueous ethanol solution kept constant at 34 °C to simulate typical human expired breath [4,10]. In order to obtain calibration curves for different samples, the concentration of ethanol was varied between 0 and 0.18 g/dL by adding the proper amount of ethanol solution (95%) to the simulated breath. A DC rotary pump (Parker CTS Diaphragm Pump, Model Number E155-11-050) was used for the ethanol injection to the cell which was connected to the breath simulator. The pump was connected to a 5 V DC power supply to keep the flow rate constant for all readings (145 mL/min). The injections were controlled with electronic timers (Omega TRFP240AC). Nitrogen gas with (99.998%) was used as a carrier gas to eliminate any contribution from oxygen or other contaminations to the sensor readings. Two different testing protocols were used to investigate sensor performance, which are described in the next section. Additional electrochemical tests were performed by reconfiguring the cell into diagnostic mode, which is described in detail elsewhere [4]. Briefly, this involves changing the anode (working electrode) gas feed to humidified nitrogen while the cathode gas feed was changed to humidified hydrogen that enabled it to serve as both a NHE reference and counter electrode. Diagnostic cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were made in this cell configuration. CVs were acquired at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in order to determine the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The ECSA values were calculated by determining the charge under the hydrogen desorption peaks, using the conversion factor of 210 μC/cm2 Pt. EIS measurements were made over a frequency range of 100 kHz – 0.1 Hz at a DC bias potential of 0.360 V vs. NHE (double layer region in CVs) and analyzed via the transmission line model [52]. 2.4.1 Calibration curves and 7-day sensing tests This set of tests were performed in the sensor configuration, where the pump was triggered to operate for 10 s via the electronic timer to simulate a breath injection and the current transient was recorded. A minimum of four breath injections were made at each concentration (0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.18 g/dL). The resting time between injections was 10 min. From every set of 4 injections, last three were used for analysis. The charge for each injection was calculated by finding the area under the peaks in current versus time (I-t) diagrams. This test was repeated continuously for 7 days. A recovery protocol was applied to the cell every day before running the sensing test in order to ensure hydrogenation was constant at the start of each day and also to removing any poising species from previous tests [4]. In this protocol, the cell was placed in the diagnostic configuration and CVs were performed at scan rate of 100 mV/s for 10 cycles. At this point, diagnostics CVs and EIS measurements were acquired. Diagnostic CVs were acquired at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in order to determine ECSA. EIS measurements were made over a frequency range of 100 kHz – 0.1 Hz at a DC bias potential of 0.360 V vs. NHE (double layer region in CVs). The variation in CV and EIS response was tracked over the course of the 7 days experiment. 2.4.2 Sensing tests at constant concentration In this set of experiments, a protocol similar to that described in Section 2.4.1 was used with some modifications. The injection and resting time was kept same but the ethanol concentration was not changed during these tests. A single ethanol concentration of 0.06 g/dL was used for all samples. The testing time was ∼8 h and repeated for 7 days. The ethanol solution was replaced every 4 h to minimize the effect of ethanol depletion/evaporation. This test aimed to study the fluctuations and potential errors that could happen in single concentration readings over time. The recovery protocol was also used at the beginning of every day as explained in Section 2.4.1."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization Our primary studies have confirmed the incorporation of Mn, Cu and Sn atoms in the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt structure. The peak positions were shifted to higher angles for Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu alloys and moved to lower angle for Pt-Sn alloy due to the lattice parameter changes (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the heat treatment at 700 °C changed the fcc crystalline structure to the PtMn intermetallic phase with a tetragonal structure for the Pt-Mn sample and for the Pt-Cu sample, the fcc structure was transformed to mixture of the PtCu and PtCu3 intermetallic phases with trigonal and simple cubic structures, respectively [33,39,42]. The particle size distribution diagrams along with the TEM images of Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu alloys before and after heat treatment are illustrated in Fig. S1. The composition and average particle size for the samples made in-house are also shown in Table 1 . Our previous studies have indicated that the heat treatment and the formation of intermetallic phases dramatically improved the ethanol oxidation activity of the Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu samples despite the particle growth [33,39,42] which was attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the Pt-rich surface, the formation of different crystalline facets and less susceptibility to the CO poisoning."
8,EOR activity in a three-electrode cell,"3.2 EOR activity in a three-electrode cell The ethanol oxidation activity of these four samples were measured using a three-electrode electrochemical cell and compared in Fig. 3 . The results indicate that the both alloy catalysts had greater EOR activity than the commercial samples, with the Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT showing the highest activity among all samples. Based on these solution measurements, we would expect this Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT catalyst to be the most active in a BrAS device, which are described in the next section."
9,Electrochemical responses of MEAs,"3.3 Electrochemical responses of MEAs 3.3.1 Commercial catalysts Fig. 4 shows the CVs recorded for Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C-based MEAs before the ethanol sensing tests were started at the beginning of each day. All recorded CVs showed the common Pt CV shape. The CV behavior for Pt catalysts has been studied extensively by many authors [53–57]. The hydrogen desorption peak at low potential was used to calculate ECSA, which are reported in Table 2 . The MEA produced with Pt/C showed higher ECSA due to higher Pt loading and the calculated ECSA is in good agreement with the values reported in other articles [58,59]. This shows that the catalyst layer on carbon paper was fabricated with high quality and the cell was assembled in good working condition. The ECSA for Pt/C increased slightly after the first day of tests, after which it remained fairly stable for the remaining 6 days of operation. However, the ECSA recorded for Pt3Sn/C changed more radically over the course of the experiment; increasing to a maximum of almost double the initial value. After day 4, ECSA decreased slightly which is an indication of degradation in this sample. The ECSA change was seen for Pt3Sn/C after the first day of experiment, could be due to the removal of Sn oxide which exposed a greater amount of clean Pt surface to the humidified gas. Following that, the degradation of catalysts layers in the course of the 7-day tests caused reduction in ECSA as well as oxidation potential. The EIS profile of the MEA made with Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C are also shown in Fig. 5 as both Nyquist and capacitance plots. Additional representation of this EIS data can be found in the supplemental information (Fig. S2). The DC bias potential of 0.360 V vs. NHE is in the double layer region [60–62] (black star on CVs) since such that pseudo-capacitance from surface redox processes on Pt do not contribute to the EIS response [52,58,59,63,64]. Thus, the EIS response should only consist of the electrode capacitive and the ionic and electronic resistance in the catalyst layer, which can be interpreted through the finite transmission line model developed by Pickup’s group [65]. The Nyquist plots displayed the expected shape for porous electrodes [52,59,63,66]. A Warburg-like response was observed in the high to moderate frequency region, after which the plot tilts vertical at lower frequencies. This is due to the capacitive response of the electrode, which is better seen in the capacitance plots (−1/ωZ” vs. Z’). The projection of the Warburg length onto the real impedance ( Z ' ) axis is proportional to the total catalyst layer resistance ( R ∑ / 3 ), where R ∑ corresponds to the sum of ionic ( R i o n i c ) and electronic resistance ( R e l e c t ) in the catalyst layer [52]. The electronic resistance in these electrodes is negligible; therefore, it is safe to assume that R ∑ is controlled by ionic resistance in the catalyst layer. Over the course of the 7 days of testing there is a slight reduction in Rionic and increase in the limiting capacitance, which is indicative of improved hydration of the catalysts layer over course of the measurements. [52,58,59,63,64]. In general, the EIS analysis indicates that the electrochemical properties these of catalysts layer were essentially steady over the course of 7 days. 3.3.2 Pt-Mn/C and Pt-Cu/C catalysts Fig. 6 shows CVs of the electrodes produced by Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT. These CVs showed a somewhat different shape compared to the commercial samples. In both samples, the intensity of the Pt oxide reduction peak at ∼ 0.8 V vs. NHE was reduced but new peak was appeared at lower potential (∼ 0.4 V vs. NHE) after the first day. The peak at lower potential became more significant due to the quinone formation which was caused by exposing higher number of carbon particles along with removing the metal oxides and the ionomer hydration. The intensities of these two peaks were almost unchanged during the next days. The ECSA estimated for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT was higher than Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT which could be due to the differences in surface composition and methods used to produce these samples. The ECSA calculated for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT decreased continuously over the course of the 7-day experiment. The ECSA of Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT fluctuated during the course of the 7 days of testing and decreased toward to the end of the experiment. However, the ECSA changes for these two samples were not as significant as the Pt3Sn/C sample. The EIS data obtained for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-HT are also shown in Fig. 7 as both Nyquist and capacitance plots. Similar to the other MEAs, the resistance in the catalyst layer was slightly reduced after the first day, after which it remained relatively stable for the next 6 days. Likewise, the limiting capacitance was reasonably stable for these two samples as well. These diagnostic results show that quality MEAs were produced. Although there were some differences in the electrochemical responses of different samples, the overall behavior of the samples and their stability were not altered significantly during the 7-day sensing test. Thus, the sensitivity and sensing response of devices fabricated using these MEA should only depend on the activity and selectivity of the samples toward ethanol oxidation. This is investigated in the next section."
10,Sensing properties of the MEAs,"3.4 Sensing properties of the MEAs 3.4.1 Commercial catalysts In order to produce accurate and reliable sensors, it is essential to identify the most active and sensitive catalyst with reproducible and accurate BrAC readings. Therefore, the sensing properties of different samples was examined and compared using the sensor prototype and breath simulator (Fig. 1) which was built in our lab [4]. Fig. 8 a and b shows the calibration curve for ethanol sensing using the Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C MEAs. These samples showed linear responses to an increase in the concentration of ethanol even at very high concentration. The slope of each diagram indicates the sensitivity of the sample at a specific day. Sensitivity (the slope of calibration curve) was determined from linear fit to each set of data. The sensitivities and the R2 values of the fitting curves are also reported in Table 2. Comparison between the R2 values for the commercial catalysts showed that the linearity of the sensing responses for Pt/C was slightly better. In addition, the limit of detection (LOD) was very close for these two commercial samples 0.002 g/dL for Pt/C and 0.005 g/dL for Pt3Sn/C. LOD can be calculated from standard deviation in the response from the blank solution without ethanol using the following formula: (4) BACLOD (g/dL) = (3 × SDQ,blank)/(sensitivity factor) Where 3 × SD Q,blank represents the signal that exceeds the response of the blank (BAC = 0) by 3-times the standard deviation in the blank signal. These results and the error bars in Fig. 8 shows that error in measuring BAC could be slightly higher utilizing the Pt3Sn/C sample, but the errors at concentration lower than 0.12 g/dL were comparable. Fig. 8c and d plots the variation in sensitivity for each MEA over the course of the 7-days of testing. The sensitivity of the commercial samples changed slightly over the course of the 7-day sensing tests but still, there is a great reproducibility in the sensitivity. Specifically, Pt3Sn/C showed higher reproducibility during the 7-day tests. Although CVs and the EIS studies showed that there were some changes in the electrochemical behavior of Pt3Sn/C during these 7 days, the sensitivity for Pt3Sn/C was very reproducible. The reproducibility of the sensitivity is directly related to the poisoning of the catalyst layer in the course of sensing process. It has been shown in our lab that the sensitivity of the samples poisoned by the ethanol oxidation can be recovered by cleaning cycles in the absence of ethanol [4] which was utilized every day before each test. Therefore, the recovery of the Pt3Sn/C sensitivity was better than Pt/C. Previous studies [29,50] have shown that Sn as co-catalyst could improve the electrode’s tolerance to atmospheric contaminants especially to CO poisoning. In addition, Fig. 8c and d indicates that the sensitivity of Pt3Sn/C was higher than Pt/C which illustrates that utilization of Pt was better in the Pt3Sn/C sample or that a greater number of electron were produced. The sensing responses for the Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C samples at 0.06 g/dL for the first day are presented in Fig. 9 a and b. The peaks recorded for these samples were very sharp which indicates a fast response of these catalysts to the ethanol injection. The intensity of the peaks recorded for these samples were close but the charge calculated for the peaks was different. Therefore, the higher sensitivity of Pt3Sn/C could be due to changes in the mechanism of ethanol oxidation and production of more electrons per mole of ethanol, resistivity toward poisoning and/or better recovery after the sensing test. 3.4.2 Pt-Mn/C and Pt-Cu/C catalysts Our primary studies showed that the ethanol oxidation activity and sensitivity of heat treated Pt-Mn/C-SC and Pt-Cu/C-POL samples were far better than untreated samples. Therefore, we have focused only on the heat-treated samples. Fig. 10 a, and b displays the calibration curves for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT. The sensitivity determined from Fig. 10a and b and presented in Table 3 . The sensitivity of Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT are compared in Fig. 10c and d. The Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT samples showed a very linear behavior in responses to the ethanol sensing. The R2 values was close to 1 which shows that the linear plot fitted very well to the sensing data. The sensitivity of Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT was higher than Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT, but the sensitivity for both samples was highly reproducible in the course of 7-day. These results show that the recovery of sensitivity was good for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT and recovery protocol was also successful for these samples. The only exception for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT sample was the result achieved at the second day. This most likely caused by the drying of MEA overnight (which was later rehydrated with further operation). The EIS analysis also confirms that at the second day, the resistivity of MEA was also increased. However, even dryness of MEA did not affect the linearity of sensing response for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT. The sensitivity of Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT was higher than the Pt/C sample but decreased during the course of the 7-day sensing test. This could be due to dissolution of Cu from alloyed particles and deposition of bulk Cu in the catalyst layer which was blocking the accessing routes to catalyst particles. Although we have shown that the dissolution of Cu in the heat treated samples was reduced [42], these results indicates that the sensitivity of the Pt-Cu samples are vulnerable to decay during long periods of operation. In addition, LOD calculated for these samples were reasonably low, 0.007 g/dL for Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and 0.002 g/dL for Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT. The LOD values are significantly lower than the range breathalyzers devices are designed to detect (0.03–0.18 mg/dL). The sensing responses of Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT at 0.06 g/dL for the first day are illustrated in Fig. 9c and d. This figure shows that the intensity and sharpness of the Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT sensing responses were considerably higher than Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT responses. These results confirmed the results was reported previously using the half-cell measurements [33,42] and are compiled in Table 1. However, Pt3Sn/C had better performance in the fuel cell sensor assembly than expected based on the trend of activity in the three-electrode measurements in solution. This may be due to some mechanistic differences between solution and gas phase ethanol oxidation. However, this really should not be too surprising given the fact that the Pt-Sn catalyst system [29,67] is well known to be a good EOR catalyst. There is still debate in the literature about how the alloying elements such as Sn, Mn and Cu could improve catalytic activity, but past studies have suggested that a few key factors are involved. These factors include the electronic effect on the surface Pt atoms, surface defects and/or changes in Pt–Pt interatomic distance [29,68–71]. The geometrical shape and morphology of the particles is also an important factor [72]. The intensity of Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT responses were very close to the commercial sample; However, the charge calculated under the peaks were between that obtained for Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C. Therefore, the highest charge toward ethanol sensing was seen for Pt3Sn/C and the lowest one was related to Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT. It should be noted here that the Pt loading for the samples prepared in-house was much less than commercial samples. There was a small amount of variation fluctuation in the sensitivity of each MEA over the course of the 7 days. The most likely cause of this was variation in hydration of the MEA over the course of the 7 days. Our previous studies [20,43] have shown that Nafion membranes are more susceptible to changes in water retention in variable humidity conditions compared to acid-loaded polyvinyl chloride membranes which is used in commercial sensor devices. Nevertheless, the fluctuations are consistent with those observed for Pt/C MEAs with almost double the Pt loadings [4,43]. The mean sensitivity and platinum mass-normalized sensitivity of different samples during the course of 7-day measurements are demonstrated in Fig. 11 . The highest sensitivity was recorded for Pt3Sn/C and the highest mass-normalized sensitivity was determined for Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT. These results indicate that the utilization of Pt was the best for Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT and it was the most active samples which was produced in this study toward the ethanol sensing. However, the sensitivity of this sample decreased overtime and further research in order to improve its stability is necessary. In addition, the sensitivity data for the commercial sensor is shown in Fig. 11 for further comparison which have been measured previously by our group [4]. The raw sensitivity of the alloys developed in-house were close to or better than the commercial sensor. The mass-normalized sensitivity of the in-house samples indicates that the utilization of Pt was significantly better than that of the commercial cell. Furthermore, the results illustrate that Pt-alloy catalysts are a viable alternate to Pt black, which could reduce the Pt content along with preserving or further improving the sensitivity of the commercial alcohol sensors. Our study shows that the Pt loading could be reduced from 7 to 14 mg/cm2 to less than 0.4 mg/cm2 which could considerably reduce the cost of commercial sensors [28,73]. 3.4.3 Sensing behavior of different samples in single concentration The calibration of alcohol breath sensors in the industry is usually done with single reading at specific concentration. Therefore, it is important to study the response of sensors to a single concentration over a prolonged period of time. In this section, the samples were exposed to the 0.06 g/dL concentration of ethanol for ca. 8 h every day in the course of 7 days. The first four readings at beginning of each day were used as a comparison. The results of the single concentration readings are shown in Fig. 12 . The charge densities, which were measured on different days, varied over the course of the 7 days, as did the standard deviation in the measurements. Higher variations in the charge densities were observed for the Pt/C and Pt-Mn/C-SC-HT samples. The Pt3Sn/C and Pt-Cu/C-POL-HT samples showed the higher mean charge intensities at this concentration compared to other samples. Based on these results, it may be prudent for more frequent calibration for the commercial sensors and perhaps even a multi-point calibration."
11,Conclusion,"In this research, the alcohol sensing of the commercial Pt/C and Pt3Sn/C samples and the Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu catalysts produced in-house were studied and the variation of sensitivity over time was compared. In general, sensing behavior correlated well with solution cell predictions, which is to be a simple and effective pre-screening tool for catalysts. The voltammetric and EIS studies were shown that catalyst layers and MEAs were prepared with good quality. There were some changes in the ECSA values and the ionic resistance of the catalyst layers in the course of 7 days of testing. These changes were less pronounced for Pt/C and the heat-treated Pt-Cu and Pt-Mn catalysts. Considering the commercial samples tested in this study, Pt3Sn/C showed the highest sensitivity but with slightly higher standard deviation. Moreover, the sensitivity factor of the heat-treated Pt-Mn showed higher reproducibility over time compared to the heat-treated Pt-Cu while the heat-treated Pt-Cu and Pt3Sn/C showed less deviation in single concentration measurements. Single concentration readings also showed that without a proper recovery procedure, the accuracy of single readings could be reduced over time and more frequent calibration and perhaps even a multi-point calibration is necessary for the commercial sensors. However, the highest mass normalized sensitivity among all samples was belonged to the Pt-Cu samples produced by polyol method and heat treated at 700 °C. These results dictated that alloying of Pt with Cu or Mn or Sn and using a proper production method combined with optimum heat treatment would improve the utilization of Pt and improve sensitivity of alcohol sensors. Finally, it can be concluded that the heat-treated Pt-Mn and Pt-Cu samples could be used as an alternative to replace Pt black in commercial sensors which would dramatically decrease the Pt loading. This could reduce the price and increase the sensitivity of commercial alcohol sensors."
