0,Introduction,"The utilization of fossil fuels has resulted in a serious impact on global warming and environment pollution. Meanwhile, hydrogen is recognized as the most promising alternative to fossil fuels because of its cleanness, high energy density and recycling [1–4]. Among the methods for hydrogen production, biological fermentation by anaerobic bacteria or photosynthetic bacteria to convert organic substrate into hydrogen is more and more popular, because this method is environmentally friendly and able to utilize the organic waste to eliminate the pollution [5–7]. Acidogenic bacteria could produce hydrogen by dark fermentation, while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols [8]. These soluble metabolites can be further utilized to produce hydrogen via photo fermentation by photosynthetic bacteria at the existence of light [1,6,9]. Therefore, the combination of dark and photo fermentation could achieve a theoretically maximum HY of 12molH2/mol hexose [2]. Recently, this method has been used to enhance hydrogen production from sucrose and glucose [2,10]. However, one of the most critical issues for commercial application of biohydrogen is the high cost. Sucrose and glucose are expensive for commercialization of biohydrogen production. Starch is the second most abundant organic compound on earth [11] and could act as the effective low-cost substrate for biohydrogen production. In addition, there is not much research and information found in previous literatures about combining dark and photo fermentation to enhance hydrogen production with cassava starch as substrate [12]. In this study, cassava starch was used as substrate for hydrogen production by the combination of dark and photo fermentation. Firstly, raw starch, gelatinized starch and enzymatic hydrolyzed starch with α-amylase and glucoamylase were used for hydrogen production respectively. And different HYs, HPRs, delay times, the composition of soluble metabolites and ratios of acetate/butyrate were observed and compared. The soluble metabolites in dark fermentation (mainly acetate and butyrate) were used to produce more hydrogen in photo fermentation after being diluted into optimal concentration."

3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design The dark fermentation was performed in 300ml transfusion bottles in batch tests. 25ml pre-cultured activated sludge was added into each bottle mixed with 225ml HM. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0±0.02 with 1M NaOH solution, and N2 was introduced into the bottle for 20min to keep anaerobic environment. Bottles were sealed with rubber stopples and kept under a mesophilic condition of 35°C. 1l unidirectional gas gathering containers were used to collect and measure the biogas production. In pretreatments, raw cassava starch was firstly gelatinized at 112°C for 15min, or added in α-amylase and glucoamylase successively for enzymatic hydrolysis for 2h and 16h respectively before fermentation. The liquid of the dark fermentation residual, which mainly contained acetate and butyrate, was collected after being centrifuged for 30min at 4800rpm and filtrated. The residual was diluted according to the optimal concentration (OC) in the experiments, or made no changes if the concentrations of organic acids were lower than OC, then added in 25ml 10× BMPF, adjusted to initial pH 7.0±0.02 and sterilized in the autoclave. N2 was also introduced to keep anaerobic environment. Bottles were sealed with rubber stopples and kept in the microcomputer illuminated incubation at 30±0.5°C with an intensity of 200W/m2 (about 6000lx). The gas collection was the same as that in the dark fermentation. At the end of the experiments, the residual organic acids were measured."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The amount of biogas produced in each experiment was periodically measured using a glass syringe with linear graduation. The composition of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (sp 3400, China, 5A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 50, 50 and 100°C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of the VFAs and alcohols were also detected by GC using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 2m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60mesh). The operation temperatures for the injection port, the oven and the FID were 200, 240 and 280°C, respectively. The carrier gas was also helium at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The pH value was adjusted with 1M HCl or 1M NaOH solution to obtain the desired initial pH."
5,Kinetic parameters model and date analysis,"2.4 Kinetic parameters model and date analysis The cumulative hydrogen production in the batch experiments was described by the modified Gompertz equation [2] to obtain the kinetic parameters more accurately: (1) H = H m exp { − exp [ R m e H m ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H represents the cumulative volume of hydrogen production (ml), H m is the hydrogen production potential (ml), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h), e is 2.718, λ is the lag-phase time (h), and t is incubation time (h). The values of H m, R m and λ for each batch experiment were determined by best fitting the hydrogen production data for Eq. (1) using the Matlab 7.5. Overall volumetric hydrogen production rate (R overall) is a performance index that takes into account both the rate and time delay for hydrogen production. The R overall is defined by the following expression: (2) R overall = H m ( H m / R m ) + λ · 1 V where V denotes working volume of the culture [11]. The hydrogen amount in all the batch experiments was calculated according to the biogas amount produced from 250ml medium and its hydrogen composition, besides modified in the normal temperature and air pressure. The hydrogen yield (ml/g starch) was calculated by dividing hydrogen production (ml) by the initial starch amount (g). All the data (including cumulative hydrogen production, HY and VFAs concentration) were the average from triplicate experiments."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production in dark fermentation,"3.1 Hydrogen production in dark fermentation In this work, research efforts are devoted to pretreating cassava starch and combining dark and photo fermentation to improve the hydrogen production. In dark fermentation, the starch concentration was from 10g/l to 25g/l at interval of 5g/l. The substrates were different concentrations of raw starch, gelatinized starch and enzymatic hydrolyzed starch for fermentation in batch tests. The curves for hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 1 . And the kinetic parameters fitted from Eq. (1) are shown in Table 1 . In batch tests with different substrates, accumulated hydrogen production increases with the increment of starch concentration. After gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis, hydrogen production increases for all different concentrations of starch (Fig. 1). The fermentation time has certain relations with substrate concentration. Higher concentration of substrate needs more fermentation time. In this study, the fermentation time for raw cassava starch is 75–110h. After gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis, the pretreated starch only needs 44–68h for fermentation, which greatly decreases. And this is very favorable for saving work time and experimental costs. Of the parameters in Table 1, the H m for all different concentrations increases after gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis. The R overall increases with the increase of starch concentration, and the maximum value for raw starch is 72.5ml/l/h, which increases to 146.2ml/l/h and 229.3ml/l/h respectively after gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis. Besides, after two methods of pretreatment, the delay time (λ) decreases from 11h to about 8h and 5h respectively. All these improvements may attribute to the pretreatments, because gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis can convert part of raw starch into dextrin, oligosaccharide and glucose, which are more easily utilized by anaerobic bacteria for hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield comparison for different concentrations of raw starch, gelatinized starch and hydrolyzed starch is shown in Fig. 2 . The HYs (mlH2/g starch) of raw cassava starch decrease with the increase of the substrate concentration, which are 240.4, 223.3, 217.7 and 207.7 respectively when substrate concentrations (g/l) are 10, 15, 20 and 25. After raw starch is heated for gelatinization, the HY has the similar decline trend with that of raw starch. But the yields increase to 258.5, 252.1, 243.5 and 230.8mlH2/g starch respectively. This indicates that gelatinized starch is more propitious for hydrogen production in dark fermentation. The HYs of enzymatic hydrolyzed starch increase significantly, especially for the relatively high concentration of substrate, which are 260.1, 264.5, 270.6 and 276.1mlH2/g starch respectively. It is worth to mention that this trend of hydrogen yield is different from the former one. Probably it is because α-amylase only can decompose starch into dextrin and oligosaccharide, which still can't be utilized by anaerobic bacteria adequately. This effect is similar to the gelatinization. And when the dextrin and oligosaccharide are converted into glucose by glucoamylase in the next step, the substrate could be utilized for hydrogen production more completely. Therefore, higher concentration of starch can be converted into more glucose. And then hydrogen yields increase correspondingly. All data indicate that enzymatic hydrolyzed starch is more appropriate than raw and gelatinized starch to be used as substrate in dark fermentation. Therefore, its soluble metabolite products (SMPs) were chosen as substrate in photo fermentation. And the main components are shown in Table 2 . In dark fermentation, the abundance and composition of soluble metabolites can closely reflect the performance of hydrogen production [11]. From stoichiometric Eqs. (3) and (4), production of 1mol acetate or butyrate is accompanied by the production of 2mol hydrogen [15]. Of soluble metabolites, acetate/butyrate is frequently used to indicate the assessing hydrogen yield. In general, a higher acetate/butyrate ratio is theoretically favorable for attaining a higher yield [11], since complete conversion of 1mol hexose into acetate yields 4mol hydrogen (Eq. (3)), while only 2mol hydrogen is formed when butyrate is the end product as indicated in Eq. (4) [15]. On the other hand, production of alcohol is considered unfavorable to hydrogen formation since alcohol is a kind of more reduced product, thereby consuming a large amount of free electrons that can be used to form hydrogen [1]. In Table 2, the total SMP amount of the hydrolyzed starch increases with the starch concentration, of which acetate and butyrate account for 96.4–98.4%. And the percentage also increases with starch concentration. Meanwhile, alcohol, which is unfavorable to hydrogen production, only accounts for 0.35–0.70% of SMP. All of these guarantee this research could obtain a high HY of 9.8–10.4mmolH2/g COD (Table 1). In Wang's similar research [11], the maximum HY of raw cassava starch and hydrolyzed starch in dark fermentation is 4.43 and 5.94mmolH2/g COD respectively. In this study, raw starch is firstly hydrolyzed into dextrin by α-amylase, and then converted into glucose by glucoamylase. The second step is quite important because it guarantees that the starch could be more adequately utilized, which didn't exist in Wang's study. Therefore the HY of this study increases to 11.61–12.33mmolH2/g starch (Table 1), which is much higher than the results reported previously (4.0–9.47mmolH2/g starch) [16–19]. In Table 2, the acetate/butyrate increases with substrate concentration, ranging from 13.6% to 22.3% (wt%), which is consistent with the HY trend in Table 1. (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2"
8,Hydrogen production in photo fermentation,"3.2 Hydrogen production in photo fermentation Acetate and butyrate derived from soluble metabolites of dark fermentation can be effectively converted into hydrogen by R. palustris [20]. So to find the optimal concentration of VFAs is crucial to improve the HY. When the acetate concentration is lower than 15mM, it mainly contributes to cell growth of the bacteria, associated with a small quantity of hydrogen production [10]. On the other hand, substrate inhibition may occur in the presence of high concentration of acetate. It is found in this study that 20mM acetate is the optimal concentration for hydrogen production, which is consistent with the reported result [9]. Likewise, at optimal concentration of 15mM butyrate, the HY is 4.8molH2/mol butyrate, which is 29.7% higher than Fang's 3.7mol/mol [8]. Since butyrate accounted for most part of the SMP and acetate was less than 20mM after dilution, the residuals from dark fermentation were diluted based on a butyrate concentration of 15mM and then used for photo fermentation. Meanwhile, the inhibition effect of NH4 + concentration to the crucial nitrogenase is greatly weakened [2]. The residuals of hydrolyzed starch in dark fermentation were used for hydrogen production in photo fermentation as shown in Table 3 , in which the experimental conditions corresponded to those in Table 2. The HYs are in the range of 126.1–131.9mlH2/g starch, which decrease with the increase of SMP in Table 2. This may attribute to the inhibition of the accumulation and interaction of alcohol, propionate, valerate and caproate, which only exist a little in the SMP. The R overall and λ are in the range of 7.0–7.6ml/l/h and 42–49.6h respectively, which both increase with the VFAs concentration in Table 2. The acetate and butyrate are almost utilized completely in photo fermentation, with a very little found in the soluble metabolites (Table 3). The utilization ratios reach 74.6–89.3% and 95.6–98.5% respectively. By combining dark and photo fermentation, hydrogen yield from cassava starch increases from original 9.3–10.7mmolH2/g starch (Table 1) to 17.5–18.0mmolH2/g starch (Tables 1 and 3), improved by 63.1–93.7%. This result is much higher than those already reported (4.0–9.47mmolH2/g starch) in the literatures [11,16–19]."
9,Energy conversion,"3.3 Energy conversion The traditional equations for dark fermentations are shown as Eqs. (3) and (4), in which part of starch is converted into VFAs besides hydrogen. However, VFAs can be further utilized to produce hydrogen in photo fermentation as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6). So the total reaction of dark and photo fermentation can be described as Eq. (7). The heat values of C6H12O6 and H2 are 2888kJ/mol and 242kJ/mol respectively. Therefore, only taking the heat value of substrates into account, the combination could dramatically improve the maximum theoretical energy conversion from original 242×4/2888×100%=33.5% to (12×242)/2888×100%=100.6%, because the bacteria can decompose and convert H2O with the heat value of zero into H2 fuel in biological metabolism. In these experiments, the actual energy conversion efficiencies increase from 17.5–18.6% in the dark fermentation to 26.4–27.1% in the two-phase dark and photo fermentation, as shown in Table 4 . (5) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 6 H 2 O → Light 4 CO 2 + 10 H 2 (6) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → Light 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 However, lamplight with intensity of 200W/m2 was used in photo fermentation. The effective light intercepting area of every bottle is 6.12×10−3 m2, and the fermentation proceeded for 90–115h. So the light energy inputted into the system is 200×(6.12×10−3)×(90–115×3600)/1000=396.58–506.74KJ. The heat value of hydrogen obtained from the two phases system ranges from 10.59 to 27.16KJ. Taking the heat value of utilized starch (40.11–100.28KJ) and the light energy into account, the energy conversion of the whole system for 10–25g/l starch is 6.04%, 5.81%, 4.56% and 4.46% respectively, which decreases with the increasing raw starch concentration. This result is much higher than the energy conversion efficiency of 1.93% reported by Chen [20], in which acetate was used for hydrogen production by R. palustris WP3-5 in photo fermentation. Even though, the energy conversion efficiency of researches on hydrogen production with light is still extremely low. There are still many efforts needed to be devoted into the research of shortening photo fermentation time and enhancing the energy conversion."
10,Conclusions,"Combining dark and photo fermentation to improve hydrogen production from cassava starch is feasible. In dark fermentation, when cassava starch is used for hydrogen production after gelatinization and enzymatic hydrolysis with α-amylase and glucoamylase, the maximum HY (mlH2/g starch) increases from 240.4 to 258.5 and 276.1 respectively, and the maximum HPR (mlH2/l/h) increases from 84.4 to 172 and 262.4 respectively. Meanwhile, the delay time (λ) and fermentation time dramatically decrease, which can greatly enhance the efficiency and performance of the combination system. The metabolites in dark fermentation, which are mainly acetate and butyrate, are used as substrate in photo fermentation. The maximum HY and HPR are 131.9mlH2/g starch and 16.4mlH2/l/h, and the highest utilization ratios for each are 89.3% and 98.5% respectively. By the combination of dark and photo fermentation, the maximum HY from cassava starch dramatically increases to 402.3mlH2/g starch from original 240.4mlH2/g starch only in dark fermentation, and the energy conversion efficiency also increases to 26.4–27.1% from original 17.5–18.6%. If taken into account the light energy used in the photo fermentation, energy conversion for the whole system is in the range of 4.46–6.04%. In summary, the cassava starch used in this combination system is cheap, available and widely distributed in the world, and the simple pretreatments and combination can dramatically enhance the hydrogen yield and energy conversion. All these indicate that the combination system has good potential for commercial application. However, how to further improve the hydrogen yield, substrate and energy conversion, as well as the application in other substrates (such as cellulose) needs to be further studied."
